<p><i>There came to him an image of man's whole life upon the earth. It
seemed to him that all man's life was like a tiny spurt of flame that
blazed out briefly in an illimitable and terrifying darkness, and that
all man's grandeur, tragic dignity, his heroic glory, came from the
brevity and smallness of this flame. He knew his life was little and
would be extinguished, and that only darkness was immense and
everlasting. And he knew that he would die with defiance on his lips,
and that the shout of his denial would ring with the last pulsing of
his heart into the maw of all-engulfing night.</i></p>

<h2><a name="chapter1-01"></a>1. The Drunken Beggar on Horseback</h2>

<p>It was the hour of twilight on a soft spring day towards the end of
April in the year of Our Lord 1929, and George Webber leaned his elbows
on the sill of his back window and looked out at what he could see of
New York. His eye took in the towering mass of the new hospital at the
end of the block, its upper floors set back in terraces, the soaring
walls salmon coloured in the evening light. This side of the hospital,
and directly opposite, was the lower structure of the annexe, where the
nurses and the waitresses lived. In the rest of the block half a dozen
old brick houses, squeezed together in a solid row, leaned wearily
against each other and showed their backsides to him.</p>

<p>The air was strangely quiet. All the noises of the city were muted
here into a distant hum, so unceasing that it seemed to belong to
silence. Suddenly, through the open windows at the front of the house
came the raucous splutter of a truck starting up at the loading
platform of the warehouse across the street. The heavy motor warmed up
with a full-throated roar, then there was a grinding clash of gears,
and George felt the old house tremble under him as the truck swung out
into the street and thundered off. The noise receded, grew fainter,
then faded into the general hum, and all was quiet as before.</p>

<p>As George leaned looking out of his back window a nameless happiness
welled within, him and he shouted over to the waitresses in the
hospital annexe, who were ironing out as usual their two pairs of
drawers and their flimsy little dresses. He heard, as from a great
distance, the faint shouts of children playing in the streets, and,
near at hand, the low voices of the people in the houses. He watched
the cool, steep shadows, and saw how the evening light was moving in
the little squares of yards, each of which had in it something
intimate, familiar, and revealing--a patch of earth in which a pretty
woman had been setting out flowers, working earnestly for hours and
wearing a big straw hat and canvas gloves; a little plot of new-sown
grass, solemnly watered every evening by a man with a square red face
and a bald head; a little shed or playhouse or workshop for some
business man's spare-time hobby; or a gay-painted table, some easy
lounging chairs, and a huge bright-striped garden parasol to cover it,
and a good-looking girl who had been sitting there all afternoon
reading, with a coat thrown over her shoulders and a tall drink at her
side.</p>

<p>Through some enchantment of the quiet and the westering light and
the smell of April in the air, it seemed to George that he knew these
people all around him. He loved this old house on Twelfth Street, its
red brick walls, its rooms of noble height and spaciousness, its old
dark woods and floors that creaked; and in the magic of the moment it
seemed to be enriched and given a profound and lonely dignity by all
the human beings it had sheltered in its ninety years. The house became
like a living presence. Every object seemed to have an animate vitality
of its own--walls, rooms, chairs, tables, even a half-wet bath towel
hanging from the shower ring above the tub, a coat thrown down upon a
chair, and his papers, manuscripts, and books scattered about the room
in wild confusion.</p>

<p>The simple joy he felt at being once more a part of such familiar
things also contained an element of strangeness and unreality. With a
sharp stab of wonder he reminded himself, as he had done a hundred
times in the last few weeks, that he had really come home again--home
to America, home to Manhattan's swarming rock, and home again to love;
and his happiness was faintly edged with guilt when he remembered that
less than a year before he had gone abroad in anger and despair,
seeking to escape what now he had returned to.</p>

<p>In his bitter resolution of that spring a year ago, he had wanted
most of all to get away from the woman he loved. Esther Jack was much
older than he, married and living with her husband and grown daughter.
But she had given George her love, and given it so deeply, so
exclusively, that he had come to feel himself caught as in a trap. It
was from that that he had wanted to escape--that and the shameful
memory of their savage quarrels, and a growing madness in himself which
had increased in violence as she had tried to hold him. So he had
finally left her and fled to Europe. He had gone away to forget her,
only to find that he could not; he had done nothing but think of her
all the time. The memory of her rosy, jolly face, her essential
goodness, her sure and certain talent, and all the hours that they had
spent together returned to torture him with new desire and longing for
her.</p>

<p>Thus, fleeing from a love that still pursued him, he had become a
wanderer in strange countries. He had travelled through England,
France, and Germany, had seen countless new sights and people,
and--cursing, whoring, drinking, brawling his way across the
continent--had had his head bashed in, some teeth knocked out, and his
nose broken in a beer-hall fight. And then, in the solitude of
convalescence in a Munich hospital, lying in bed upon his back with his
ruined face turned upwards towards the ceiling, he had had nothing else
to do but think. There, at last, he had learned a little sense. There
his madness had gone out of him, and for the first time in many years
he had felt at peace within himself.</p>

<p>For he had learned some of the things that every man must find out
for himself, and he had found out about them as one has to find
out--through error and through trial, through fantasy and illusion,
through falsehood and his own damn foolishness, through being mistaken
and wrong and an idiot and egotistical and aspiring and hopeful and
believing and confused. As he lay there in the hospital he had gone
back over his life, and, bit by bit, had extracted from it some of the
hard lessons of experience. Each thing he learned was so simple and
obvious, once he grasped it, that he wondered why he had not always
known it. All together, they wove into a kind of leading thread,
trailing backwards through his past, and out into the future. And he
thought that now, perhaps, he could begin to shape his life to mastery,
for he felt a sense of new direction deep within him, but whither it
would take him he could not say.</p>

<p>And what had he learned? A philosopher would not think it much,
perhaps, yet in a simple human way it was a good deal. Just by living,
by making the thousand little daily choices that his whole complex of
heredity, environment, conscious thought, and deep emotion had driven
him to make, and by taking the consequences, he had learned that he
could not eat his cake and have it, too. He had learned that-in spite
of his strange body, so much off scale that it had often made him think
himself a creature set apart, he was still the son and brother of all
men living. He had learned that he could not devour the earth, that he
must know and accept his limitations. He realised that much of his
torment of the years past had been self-inflicted, and an inevitable
part of growing up. And, most important of all for one who had taken so
long to grow up, he thought be had learned not to be the slave of his
emotions.</p>

<p>Most of the trouble he had brought upon himself, he saw, had come
from leaping down the throat of things. Very well, he would look before
he leaped hereafter. The trick was to get his reason and his emotions
pulling together in double harness, instead of letting them fly off in
opposite directions, tearing him apart between them. He would try to
give his head command and see what happened: then if head said,
"Leap!"--he'd leap with all his heart.</p>

<p>And that was where Esther came in, for he had really not meant to
come back to her. His head had told him it was better to let their
affair end as it had ended. But no sooner had he arrived in New York
than his heart told him to call her up--and he had done it. Then they
had met again, and after that things followed their own course.</p>

<p>So here he was, back with Esther--the one thing he had once been
sure would never happen. Yes, and very happy to be back. That was the
queerest part of it. It seemed, perversely, that he ought to be unhappy
to be doing what his reason had told him not to do. But he was not. And
that was why, as he leaned there musing on his window-sill while the
last light faded and the April night came on, a subtle worm was gnawing
at his conscience and he wondered darkly at how great a lag there was
between his thinking and his actions.</p>

<p>He was twenty-eight years old now, and wise enough to know that
there are sometimes reasons of which the reason knows nothing, and that
the emotional pattern of one's life, formed and set by years of living,
is not to be discarded quite as easily as one may throw away a battered
hat or worn-out shoe. Well, he was not the first man to be caught on
the horns of this dilemma. Had not even the philosophers themselves
been similarly caught? Yes--and then written sage words about it:</p>

<p>"A foolish consistency," Emerson had said, "is the hobgoblin of
little minds."</p>

<p>And great Goethe, accepting the inevitable truth that human growth
does not proceed in a straight line to its goal, had compared the
development and progress of mankind to the reelings of a drunken beggar
on horseback.</p>

<p>What was important, perhaps, was not that the beggar was drunk and
reeling, but that he was mounted on his horse, and, however unsteadily,
was going somewhere.</p>

<p>This thought was comforting to George, and he pondered it for some
time, yet it did not altogether remove the edge of guilt that faintly
tinged his contentment. There was still a possible flaw in the
argument: His inconsistency in coming back-to Esther--was it wise or
foolish?...Must the beggar on horseback for ever reel?</p>

<p>Esther awoke as quick and sudden as a bird. She lay upon her back
and stared up at the ceiling straight and wide. This was her body and
her flesh, she was alive and ready in a moment.</p>

<p>She thought at once of George. Their reunion had been a joyous
re-discovery of love, and all things were made new again. They had
taken up the broken fragments of their life and joined them together
with all the intensity and beauty that they had known in the best days
before he went away. The madness that bad nearly wrecked them both had
now gone out of him entirely. He was' still full of his, unpredictable
moods and fancies, but she had not seen a trace of the old black fury
that used to make him lash about and beat his knuckles bloody against
the wall. Since he returned he had seemed quieter, surer, in better
control of himself, and in everything he did he acted as if he wanted
to show her that he loved her. She had never known such perfect
happiness. Life was good.</p>

<p>Outside, on Park Avenue, the people had begun to move along the
pavements once more, the streets of the city began to fill and thicken.
Upon the table by her bed the little dock ticked eagerly its pulse of
time as if it hurried forward for ever like a child towards some
imagined joy, and a clock struck slowly in the house with a measured,
solemn chime. The morning sun steeped each object in her room with
casual light, and in her heart she said, "It is now."</p>

<p>Nora brought coffee and hot rolls, and Esther read the paper. She
read the gossip of the theatre, and she read the names of the cast that
had been engaged for the new German play that the Community Guild was
going to do in the autumn, and she read that "Miss Esther Jack has been
engaged to design the show". She laughed because they called her
"Miss", and because she could see the horrified look on <i>his</i> face
when he read it, and because she remembered his expression when the
little tailor thought she was his wife, and because it gave her so much
pleasure to see her name in the paper--"Miss Esther Jack, whose work
has won her recognition as one of the foremost modern designers."</p>

<p>She was feeling gay and happy and pleased with herself, so she put
the paper in her bag, together with some other clippings she had saved,
and took them with her when she went down-town to Twelfth Street for
her daily visit to George. She handed them to him, and sat opposite to
watch his face as he read them. She remembered all the things they had
written about her work:</p>

<p>"...subtle, searching, and hushed, with a wry and rueful humour of
its own..."</p>

<p>"...made these old eyes shine by its deft, sure touch of whimsey as
nothing else in this prodigal season of dramatic husks has done..."</p>

<p>"...the gay insouciance of her unmannered settings, touched with
those qualities which we have come to expect in all her ardent services
to that sometimes too ungrateful jade, the drama..."</p>

<p>"...the excellent fooling that is implicit in these droll sets,
elvishly sly, mocking, and, need we add or make apology for adding,
expert?..."</p>

<p>She could hardly keep from laughing at the scornful twist of his
mouth and the mocking tone of his comment as he bit off the
phrases.</p>

<p>"'Elvishly sly!' Now isn't that too God-damned delightful!" he said
with mincing precision. "'Made these old eyes shine!' Why, the quaint
little bastard!...'That sometimes too ungrateful jade!' Oh, deary me,
now!...'And need we add--!' I am swooning, sweetheart: pass the
garlic!"</p>

<p>He threw the papers on the floor with an air of disgust and turned
to her with a look of mock sternness that crinkled the corners of his
eyes.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "do I get fed, or must I starve here while you
wallow in this bilge?"</p>

<p>She could control herself no longer and shrieked with glee. "I
didn't do it!" she gasped. "I didn't write it! I can't help it if they
write like that! Isn't it awful?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and you hate it, don't you?" he said. "You lap it up! You arc
sitting there licking your lips over it now, gloating on it, and on my
hunger! Don't you know, woman, that I haven't had a bite to eat all
day? Do I get fed, or not? Will you put your deft whimsey in a
steak?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. "Would you like a steak?"</p>

<p>"Will you make these old eyes shine with a chop and a delicate
dressing of young onions?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. "Yes."</p>

<p>He came over and put his arms about her, his eyes searching hers in
a look of love and hunger. "Will you make me one of your causes that is
subtle, searching, and hushed?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. "Whatever you like, I will make it for you."</p>

<p>"Why will you make it for me?" he asked.</p>

<p>It was like a ritual that both of them knew, and they fastened upon
each word and answer because they were so eager to hear it from each
other.</p>

<p>"Because I love you. Because I want to feed you and to love
you."</p>

<p>"Will it be good?" he said.</p>

<p>"It will be so good that there will be no words to tell its
goodness," she said. "It will be good because I am so good and
beautiful, and because I can do everything better than any other woman
you will ever know, and because I love you with all my heart and soul,
and want to be a part of you."</p>

<p>"Will this great love get into the food you cook for me?"</p>

<p>"It will be in every morsel that you eat. It will feed your hunger
as you've never been fed before. It will be like a living miracle, and
will make you better and richer as long as you live. You will never
forget it. It will be a glory and a triumph."</p>

<p>"Then this will be such food as no one ever ate before," he said.
"Yes," she said.-"It will be."</p>

<p>And it was so. There was never anything like it in the world before.
April had come back again.</p>

<p>So now they were together. But things were not quite the same
between them as they had once been. Even on the surface they were
different. No longer now for them was there a single tenement and
dwelling place. From the first day of his return he had flatly refused
to go back to the house on Waverly Place which the two of them had
previously shared for work and love and living. Instead, he had taken
these two large rooms on Twelfth Street, which occupied the whole
second floor of the house and could be made into one enormous room by
opening the sliding doors between them. There was also a tiny kitchen,
just big enough to turn around in. The whole arrangement suited George
perfectly because it gave him both space and privacy. Here Esther could
come and go as she liked; here they could be alone together whenever
they wished; here they could feed at the heart of love.</p>

<p>The most important thing about it, however, was that this was his
place, not <i>theirs</i>, and that fact re-established their relations
on a different level. Henceforth he was determined not to let his life
and love be one. She had her world of the theatre and of her rich
friends which he did not want to belong to, and he had his world of
writing which he would have to manage alone. He would keep love a thing
apart, and safeguard to himself the mastery of his life, his separate
soul, his own integrity.</p>

<p>Would she accept this compromise? Would she take his love, but leave
him free to live his life and do his work? That was the way he told her
it must be, and she said yes, she understood. But could she do it? Was
it in a woman's nature to be content with all that a man could give
her, and not for ever want what was not his to give? Already there were
little portents that made him begin to doubt it.</p>

<p>One morning when she came to see him and was telling him with spirit
and great good humour about a little comedy she had witnessed in the
street, suddenly she stopped short in the middle of it, a cloud passed
over her face, her eyes became troubled, and she turned to him and
said:</p>

<p>"You do love me, don't you, George?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "Of course. You know I do."</p>

<p>"Will you never leave me again?" she asked, a little breathless.
"Will you go on loving me for ever?"</p>

<p>Her abrupt change of mood and her easy assumption that he or any
human being could honestly pledge himself to anyone or anything for
ever struck him as ludicrous, and he laughed.</p>

<p>She made an impatient gesture with her hand. "Don't laugh, George,"
she said. "I need to know. Tell me. Will you go on loving me for
ever?"</p>

<p>Her seriousness, and the impossibility of giving her an answer
annoyed him now, and he rose from his chair, stared down blankly at her
for a moment, and then began pacing back and forth across the room. He
paused once or twice and turned to her as if to speak, but, finding it
hard to say what he wanted to say, he resumed his nervous pacing.</p>

<p>Esther followed him with her eyes; their expression betraying her
mixed feelings, in which amusement and exasperation were giving way to
alarm.</p>

<p>"What have I done now?" she thought. "God, was there ever anybody
like him! You never can tell what he'll do! All I did was ask him a
simple question and he acts like this! Still, it's better than the way
he used to act. He used to blow up and call me vile names. Now he just
stews in his own juice and I can't tell what he's thinking. Look at
him--pacing like a wild animal in a cage, like a temperamental and
introspective monkey!"</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, in moments of excitement George did look rather
like a monkey. Barrel-chested, with broad, heavy shoulders, he walked
with a slight stoop, letting his arms swing loosely, and they were so
long that they dangled almost to the knees, the big hands and spatulate
fingers curving deeply in like paws. His head, set down solidly upon a
short neck, was carried somewhat forward with a thrusting movement, so
that his whole figure had a prowling and half-crouching posture. He
looked even shorter than he was, for, although he was an inch or two
above the middle height, around five feet nine or ten, his legs were
not quite proportionate to the upper part of his body. Moreover, his
features were small--somewhat pug-nosed, the eyes set very deep in
beneath heavy brows, the forehead rather low, the hair beginning not
far above the brows. And when he was agitated or interested in
something, he had the trick of peering upward with a kind of packed
attentiveness, and this, together with his general posture, the head
thrust forward, the body prowling downwards, gave him a distinctly
simian appearance. It was easy to see why some of his friends called
him Monk.</p>

<p>Esther watched him a minute or two, feeling disappointed and hurt
that he had not answered her. He stopped by the front window and stood
looking out, and she went over to him and quietly put her arm through
his. She saw the vein swell in his temple, and knew there was no use in
speaking.</p>

<p>Outside, the little Jewish tailors were coming from the office of
their union next door and were standing in the street. They were pale,
dirty, and greasy, and very much alive. They shouted and gesticulated
at one another, they stroked each other gently on the cheek in mounting
fury, saying tenderly in a throttled voice: "Nah! Nah! Nah!" Then,
still smiling in their rage, they began to slap each other gently in
the face with itching finger-tips. At length they screamed and dealt
each other stinging slaps. Others cursed and shouted, some laughed, and
a few said nothing, but stood darkly, sombrely apart, feeding upon
their entrails.</p>

<p>Then the young Irish cops charged in among them. There was something
bought and corrupt about their look. They had brutal and brainless
faces, full of pride. Their jaws were loose and coarse, they chewed gum
constantly as they shoved and thrust their way along, and they kept
saying:</p>

<p>"Break it up, now! Break it up! All right! Keep movin'!"</p>

<p>The motors roared by like projectiles, and people were passing along
the pavement. There were the faces George and Esther had never seen
before, and there were the faces they had always seen, everywhere:
always different, they never changed; they welled up from the
sourceless springs of life with unending fecundity, with limitless
variety, with incessant movement, and with the monotony of everlasting
repetition. There were the three girl-friends who pass along the
streets of life for ever. One had a cruel and sensual face, she wore
glasses, and her mouth was hard and vulgar. Another had the great nose
and the little bony features of a rat. The face of the third was full
and loose, jeering with fat rouged lips and oily volutes of the
nostrils. And when they laughed, there was no warmth or joy in the
sound: high, shrill, ugly, and hysterical, their laughter only asked
the earth to notice them.</p>

<p>In the street the children played. They were dark and strong and
violent, aping talk and toughness from their elders. They leaped on one
another and hurled the weakest to the pavement. The policemen herded
the noisy little tailors along before them, and they went away. The sky
was blue and young and vital, there were no clouds in it; the trees
were budding into leaf; the sunlight fell into the street, upon all the
people there, with an innocent and fearless life.</p>

<p>Esther glanced at George and saw his face grow twisted as he looked.
He wanted to say to her that we are all savage, foolish, violent, and
mistaken; that, full of our fear and confusion, we walk in ignorance
upon the living and beautiful earth, breathing young, vital air and
bathing in the light of morning, seeing it not because of the murder in
our hearts.</p>

<p>But he did not say these things. Wearily he turned away from the
window.</p>

<p>"There's for ever," he said. "There's your for ever."</p>

<h2><a name="chapter1-02"></a>2. Fame's First Wooing</h2>

<p>In spite of the colourings of guilt that often tinged his brighter
moods, George was happier than he had ever been. There can be no doubt
about that. He exulted in the fact. The old madness had gone out of
him, and for long stretches at a time he was now buoyed up by the
glorious belief--not by any means a new one with him, though it was
much stronger now than it had ever been before--that he was at last in
triumphant control of his destiny. From his early childhood, when he
was living like an orphan with his Joyner relatives back in Libya Hill,
he had dreamed that one day he would go to New York and there find love
and fame and fortune. For several years New York had been the place
that he called home, and love was his already; and now he felt, with
the assurance of deep conviction, that the time for fame and fortune
was at hand.</p>

<p>Anyone is happy who confidently awaits the fulfilment of his highest
dreams, and in that way George Was happy. And, like most of us when
things are going well, he took the credit wholly to himself. It was not
chance or luck or any blind confluence of events that had produced the
change in his spirits: his contentment and sense of mastery were the
reward of his own singular and peculiar merit, and no more than his
just due. Nevertheless fortune had played a central part in his
transformation. A most incredible thing had happened.</p>

<p>He had been back in New York only a few days when Lulu Scudder, the
literary agent, telephoned him in great excitement. The publishing
house of James Rodney &amp; Co. was interested in his manuscript, and
Foxhall Edwards, the distinguished editor of this great house, wanted
to talk to him about it. Of course, you couldn't tell about these
things, but it was always a good idea to strike while the iron was hot.
Could he go over right away to see Edwards?</p>

<p>As he made his way uptown George told himself that it was silly to
be excited, that probably nothing would come of it. Hadn't one
publisher already turned the book down, saying that it was no novel?
That publisher had even written---and the words of his rejection had
seared themselves in. George's brain--"The novel form is not adapted to
such talents, as you have." And it was still the same manuscript. Not a
line of it had been changed, not a word cut, in spite of hints from
Esther and Miss Scudder that it was too long for any publisher to
handle. He had stubbornly refused to alter it, insisting that it would
have to be printed as it was or not at all. And he had left the
manuscript with Miss Scudder and gone away to Europe, convinced that
her efforts to find a publisher would prove futile.</p>

<p>All the time he was abroad it had nauseated him to think of his
manuscript, of the years of work and sleepless nights, he had put into
it, and of the high hopes that bad sustained him through it; and he had
tried, not to think of it, convinced now that it was no good, that he
himself was no good, and that all his hot ambitions and his dreams of
fame were the vapourings of a shoddy aesthete without talent. In this,
he told himself, he was just like most of the other piddling
instructors at the School for Utility Cultures, from which he had fled,
and to which he would return to resume his classes in English
composition when his leave of absence expired. They talked for ever
about the great books they were writing, or were going to write,
because, like him, they needed so desperately to find some avenue of
escape from the dreary round of teaching, reading themes, grading
papers, and trying to strike a spark in minds that had no flint in
them. He had stayed in Europe almost nine months, and no word had come
from Miss Scudder, so he had felt confirmed in all his darkest
forebodings.</p>

<p>But now she said the Rodney people were interested. Well, they had
taken their time about it. And what did "interested" mean? Very likely
they would tell him they had detected in the book some slight traces of
a talent which, with careful nursing, could be schooled to produce, in
time, a publishable book. He had heard that publishers sometimes had a
weather eye for this sort of thing and that they would often string an
aspiring author along for years, giving him just the necessary degree,
of encouragement to keep him from abandoning hope altogether and to
make him think that they had faith in his great future if only he would
go on writing book after rejected book until he "found himself". Well,
he'd show them that he was not their fool! Not by so much as a flicker
of an eyelash would he betray his disappointment, and he would commit
himself to nothing!</p>

<p>If the traffic policeman on the corner noticed a strange young man
in front of the office of James Rodney &amp; Co. that morning, he would
never have guessed at the core of firm resolution with which this young
man had tried to steel himself for the interview that lay before him.
If the policeman saw him at all, he probably observed him with
misgiving, wondering whether he ought not to intervene to prevent the
commission of a felony, or at any rate whether he ought not to speak to
the young man and hold him in conversation until the ambulance could
arrive and take him to Bellevue for observation.</p>

<p>For, as the young man approached the building at a rapid, loping
stride, a stern scowl upon his face and his lips set in a grim line, he
had hardly crossed the street and set his foot upon the kerb before the
publisher's building when his step faltered, he stopped and looked
about him as if not knowing what to do, and then, in evident confusion,
forced himself to go on. 'But now his movements were uncertain; as if
his legs obeyed his will with great reluctance. He lunged ahead, then
stopped, then lunged again and made for the door, only to halt again in
a paroxysm of indecision as he came up to it. He stood there facing the
door for a moment, clenching and unclenching his hands, then looked
about him quickly, suspiciously, as though he expected to find somebody
watching him. At last, with a slight shudder of resolution, he thrust
his hands deep into his pockets, turned deliberately, and walked on
past the door.</p>

<p>And now he moved slowly, the line of his mouth set grimmer than
before, and his head was carried stiffly forward from the shoulders as
if he were trying to hold himself to the course he had decided upon by
focusing on some distant object straight before him. But all the while,
as he went along before the entrance and the show windows filled with
books which flanked it on both sides, he peered sharply out of the
corner of his eye like a spy who had to find out what was going on
inside the building without letting the passers-by observe his
interest. He walked to the end of the block and turned about and then
came back, and again as he passed in front of the publishing house he
kept his face fixed straight ahead and looked stealthily out of the
corner of his eye. For fifteen or twenty minutes he repeated this
strange manoeuvred, and each time as he approached the door he-would
hesitate and half turn as if about to enter, and then abruptly go on as
before.</p>

<p>Finally, as he came abreast of the entrance for perhaps the fiftieth
time, he quickened his stride and seized the door-knob--but at once, as
though it had given him an electric shock, he snatched his hand away
and backed off, and stood on the kerb looking up at the house of James
Rodney &amp; Co. For several minutes more he stood there, shifting
uneasily on his feet and watching all the upper windows as for a sign.
Then, suddenly, his jaw muscles tightened, he stuck out his under lip
in desperate resolve, and he bolted across the pavement, hurled himself
against the door, and disappeared inside.</p>

<p>An hour later, if the policeman was still on duty at the corner, he
was no doubt as puzzled and mystified as before by the young man's
behaviour as he emerged from the building. He came out slowly, walking
mechanically, a dazed look on his face, and in one of his hands, which
dangled loosely at his sides, he held a crumpled slip of yellow paper.
He emerged from the office of James Rodney &amp; Co. like a man walking
in a trance. With the slow and thoughtless movements of an automaton,
he turned his steps uptown, and, still with the rapt and dazed look
upon his face, he headed north and disappeared into the crowd..</p>

<p>It was, late afternoon and the shadows were slanting swiftly
eastwards when George Webber came to his senses somewhere in the wilds
of the upper Bronx. How he got there he never knew. All he could
remember was that suddenly he felt hungry and stopped and looked about
him and realized where he was. His dazed look gave way to one of
amazement and incredulity, and his mouth began W stretch in a broad
grin. In his hand he still held the rectangular slip of crisp yellow
paper, and slowly he smoothed out the wrinkles and examined it
carefully.</p>

<p>It was a cheque for five hundred dollars. His book bad been
accepted, and this was an advance against his royalties.</p>

<p>So he was happier than he had ever been in all his life. Fame, at
last, was knocking at his door and wooing him with her sweet
blandishments, and he lived in a kind of glorious delirium. The next
weeks and months were filled with the excitement of the impending
event. The book would not be published till the autumn, but meanwhile
there was much work to do. Foxhall Edwards had made some suggestions
for cutting and revising the manuscript, and, although George at first
objected, he surprised himself in the end by agreeing with Edwards, and
he undertook to do what Edwards wanted.</p>

<p>George had called his novel, <i>Home to Our Mountains</i>, and in it
he had packed everything he knew about his home town in Old Catawba and
the people there. He had distilled every line of it out of his own
experience of life. And, now that the issue was decided, he sometimes
trembled when he thought that it would be only a matter of months
before the whole world knew what he had written. He loathed the thought
of giving pain to anyone, and that he might do so had never occurred to
him till now. But now it was out of his hands, and he began to feel
uneasy. Of course it was fiction, but it was made as all honest fiction
must be, from the stuff of human life. Some people might recognize
themselves, and be offended, and then what would he do? Would he have
to go around in smoked glasses and false whiskers? He comforted himself
with the hope that his characterisations were not so true as, in
another mood, he liked to think they, were, and he thought that perhaps
no one would notice anything.</p>

<p><i>Rodney's Magazine</i>, too, had become interested in the young
author and was going to publish a story, a chapter from the book, in
their next number. This news added immensely to his excitement. He was
eager to see his name in print, and in the happy interval of expectancy
he felt like a kind of universal Don Juan, for he literally loved
everybody--his fellow instructors at the school, his drab students, the
little shopkeepers in all the stores, even the nameless hordes that
thronged the streets. Rodney's, of course, was the greatest and the
finest publishing house in all the world, and Foxhall Edwards was the
greatest editor and the finest man that ever was. George had liked him
instinctively from the first, and now, like an old and intimate friend,
he was calling him Fox. George knew that Fox believed in him, and the
editor's faith and confidence, coming as it had come, at a time when
George had given up all hope, restored his self-respect and charged him
with energy for new work.</p>

<p>Already his next novel was begun and was beginning to take shape
within him. He would soon have to get it out of him. He dreaded the
prospect of buckling down in earnest to write it, for he knew the agony
of it. It was like demoniacal possession, driving him with an alien
force much greater than his own. While the fury of creation was upon
him, it meant sixty cigarettes a day, twenty cups of coffee, meals
snatched anyhow and anywhere and at whatever time of day or night he
happened to remember he was hungry. It meant sleeplessness, and miles
of walking to bring on the physical fatigue without which he could not
sleep, then nightmares, nerves, and exhaustion in the morning. As he
said to Fox:</p>

<p>"There are better ways to write a book, but this, God help me, is
mine, and you'll have to learn to put up with it."</p>

<p>When <i>Rodney's Magazine</i> came out with the story, George fully
expected convulsions of the earth, falling meteors, suspension of
traffic in the streets, and a general strike. But nothing happened. A
few of his friends mentioned it, but that was all. For several days he
felt let down, but then his common sense reassured him that people
couldn't really tell much about a new author from a short piece in a
magazine. The book would show them who he was and what he could do. It
would be different then. He could afford to wait a little longer for
the fame which he was certain would soon be his.</p>

<p>It was not until later, after the first excitement had worn off and
George had become accustomed to the novelty of being an author whose
book was actually going to be published, that he began to learn a
little about the unknown world of publishing and the people who inhabit
it--and not till then did he begin to understand and appreciate the
teal quality of Fox Edwards. And it was through Otto Hauser--so much
like Fox in his essential integrity, so sharply contrasted to him in
other respects--that George got his first real insight into the
character of his editor.</p>

<p>Hausa Was a reader at Rodney's, and probably the best publisher's
reader in America. He might have been a publisher's editor--a rare and
good one--had he been driven forward by ambition, enthusiasm, daring,
tenacious resolution, and that eagerness to seek and find the best
which a great editor must have. But Hauser was content to spend his
days reading ridiculous manuscripts written by ridiculous people on all
sorts of ridiculous subjects "The Breast Stroke," "Rock Gardens for
Everybody," "The Life and Times of Lydia Pinkham," "The New Age of
Plenty"--and once in a while something that had the fire of passion,
the spark of genius, the glow of truth.</p>

<p>Otto Hauser lived in a tiny apartment near First Avenue, and he
invited George to drop in one evening. George went, and they spent the
evening talking. After that he returned again and again because he
liked Otto, and also because he was puzzled by the contradictions of
his qualities, especially by something aloof, impersonal, and
withdrawing in his nature which seemed so out of place beside the clear
and positive elements in his character.</p>

<p>Otto did all the housekeeping himself. He had tried having cleaning
women in from time to time, but eventually he had dispensed entirely
with their services. 'They were not clean and tidy enough to suit him,
and their casual and haphazard disarrangements of objects that had been
placed exactly where he wanted them annoyed his order-loving soul. He
hated clutter. He had only a few books--a shelf or two--most of them
the latest publications of the house of Rodney, and a few volumes sent
him by other publishers. Usually he gave his books away as soon as he
finished reading them because he hated clutter, and books made clutter.
Sometimes he wondered if he didn't hate books, too. Certainly he didn't
like to have many of them around: the sight of them irritated him.</p>

<p>George found him a curious enigma. Otto Hauser was possessed of
remarkable gifts, yet he was almost wholly lacking in those qualities
which cause a man to "get on" in the world. In fact, he didn't want to
"get on". He had a horror of "getting on", of going any further than he
bad already gone. He wanted to be a publisher's reader, and nothing
more. At James Rodney &amp; Co. he did the work they put into his
hands. He did punctiliously what he was required to do. He gave his
word, when he was asked to give it, with the complete integrity of his
quiet soul, the unerring rightness of his judgment, the utter finality
of his Germanic spirit. But beyond that he would not go.</p>

<p>When one of the editors at Rodney's, of whom there were several
besides Foxhall Edwards, asked Hauser for his opinion, the ensuing
conversation would go something like this:</p>

<p>"You have read the manuscript?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Hauser, "I have read it."</p>

<p>"What did you think of it?"</p>

<p>"I thought it was without merit."</p>

<p>"Then you do not recommend its publication?"</p>

<p>"No, I do not think it is worth publishing."</p>

<p>Or:</p>

<p>"Did you read that manuscript?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Hauser would say. "I read it."</p>

<p>"Well, what did you think of it? (Confound it, can't the fellow say
what he thinks without having to be asked all the timer)"</p>

<p>"I think it is a work of genius."</p>

<p>Incredulously: "You <i>do!</i>"</p>

<p>"I do, yes. To my mind there is no question about it."</p>

<p>"But look here, Hauser--" excitedly--"if what you say is true, this
boy--the fellow who wrote it--why, he's just a kid--no one ever heard
of him before--comes from somewhere out West--Nebraska, Iowa, one of
those places--never been anywhere, apparently--if what you say is true,
we've made a discovery!"</p>

<p>"I suppose you have. Yes. The book is a work of genius."</p>

<p>"But--(Damn it all, what's wrong with the man anyway? Here he makes
a discovery like this--an astounding statement of this sort--and shows
no more enthusiasm than if he were discussing a cabbage head!)--but,
see here, then! You--you mean there's something wrong with it?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't think there's anything wrong with it. I think it is a
magnificent piece of writing."</p>

<p>"But--(Good Lord, the fellow is a queer fish!)--but you mean to say
that--that perhaps it's not suitable for publication in its present
form?"</p>

<p>"No. I think it's eminently publishable."</p>

<p>"But it's overwritten, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> overwritten. Yes."</p>

<p>"I thought so, too," said the editor shrewdly. "Of course, the
fellow shows he knows very little about writing. He doesn't know how he
does it, he repeats himself continually, he is childish and exuberant
and extravagant, and he does ten times too much of everything.. We have
a hundred other writers who know more about writing than he does."</p>

<p>"I suppose we have, yes," Hauser agreed. "Nevertheless, he is a man
of genius, and they are not. His, book is a work of genius, and theirs
are not."</p>

<p>"Then you think we ought to publish him?"</p>

<p>"I think so, yes."</p>

<p>"But--(Ah, here's the catch, maybe--the thing he's holding back
on!)--but you think this is all he has to say?--that he's written
himself out in this one book?--that he'll never be able to write
another?"</p>

<p>"No. I think nothing of the sort. I can't say, of course. They may
kill him, as they often do----"</p>

<p>"(God, what a gloomy Gus the fellow is!)"</p>

<p>"--but on the basis of this book, I should say there's no danger of
his running dry. He should have fifty books in him."</p>

<p>"But--(Good Lord! What <i>is</i> the catch?)--but then you mean you
don't think it's time for such a book as this in America yet?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't mean that. I think it <i>is</i> time."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because it has happened. Iris always time when it happens."</p>

<p>"But some of our best critics say it's not time."</p>

<p>"I know they do. However, they are wrong. It is simply not their
time, that's all."</p>

<p>"How do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean, their time is critic's time. The book is creator's time.
The two times are not the same."</p>

<p>"You think, then, that the critics are behind the time?"</p>

<p>"They are behind creator's time, yes."</p>

<p>"Then they may not see this book as the work of genius which you say
it is. Do you think they will?"</p>

<p>"I can't say. Perhaps not. However, it doesn't matter."</p>

<p>"Doesn't <i>matter!</i> Why, what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean that the thing is good, and cannot be destroyed. Therefore
it doesn't matter what anyone says."</p>

<p>"Then--Good Lord, Hauser!--if what you say is true, we've made a
great discovery!"</p>

<p>"I think you have. Yes."</p>

<p>"But--but--is that <i>all</i> you have to say?"</p>

<p>"I think so, yes. What else <i>is</i> there to say?"</p>

<p>Baffled: "Nothing--only, I should think <i>you</i> would be excited
about it!" Then, completely defeated and resigned: "Oh, <i>all</i>
right! <i>All</i> right, Hauser! Thanks very much!"</p>

<p>The people at Rodney's couldn't understand it. They didn't know what
to make of it. Finally, they had given up trying, all except Fox
Edwards--and Fox would never give up trying to understand anything. Fox
still came by Hauser's office--his little cell--and looked in on him.
Fox's old grey hat would be pushed back on his head, for he never took
it off when he worked, and there would be a look of troubled wonder in
his sea-pale eyes as he bent over and stooped and craned and stared at
Hauser, as if he were regarding for the first time some fantastic
monster from the marine jungles of the ocean. Then he would turn and
walk away, hands hanging to his coat lapels, and in his eyes there
would be a look of utter astonishment.</p>

<p>Fox couldn't understand it yet. As for Hauser himself, he had no
answers, nothing to tell them.</p>

<p>It was not until George Webber had become well acquainted with both
men that be began to penetrate the mystery. Foxhall Edwards and Otto
Hauser--to know them both, to see them working in the same office, each
in his own way, was to understand them both as perhaps neither could
have been understood completely by himself. Each man, by being what he
was, revealed to George the secret springs of character which had made
the two of them so much alike--and so utterly different.</p>

<p>There may have been a time when an intense and steady flame had been
alive in the quiet depths of Otto Hauser's spirit. But that was before
he knew what it was like to be a great editor. Now he had seen it for
himself, and he wanted none of it. For ten years he had watched Fox
Edwards, and he well knew what was needed: the pure flame living in the
midst of darkness; the constant, quiet, and relentless effort of the
will to accomplish what the pure flame burned for, what the spirit
knew; the unspoken agony of that constant effort as it fought to win
through to its clear purpose and somehow to subdue the world's blind
and brutal force of ignorance, hostility, prejudice, and intolerance
which were opposed to it--the fools of age, the fools of prudery, the
fools of genteelness, fogyism, and nice-Nellyism, the fools of bigotry,
Philistinism, jealousy, and envy, and, worst of all, the utter, sheer
damn fools of nature!</p>

<p>Oh, to burn so, so to be consumed, exhausted, spent by the passion
of this constant flame! And for what? For <i>what?</i> And <i>why?</i>
Because some obscure kid from Tennessee, some tenant farmer's son from
Georgia, or some country doctor's boy in North Dakota--untitled,
unpedigreed, unhallowed by fools' standards--had been touched with
genius, and so had striven to give a tongue to the high passion of his
loneliness, to wrest from his locked spirit his soul's language and a
portion of the tongue of his unuttered brothers, to find a channel in
the blind immensity of this harsh land for the pent tides of his
creation, and to make, perhaps, in this howling wilderness of life some
carving and some dwelling of his own--all this before the world's
fool-bigotry, fool-ignorance, fool-cowardice, fool-faddism,
fool-mockery, fool-stylism, and fool-hatred for anyone who was not
corrupted, beaten, and a fool had either quenched the hot, burning
passion with ridicule, contempt, denial, and oblivion, or else
corrupted the strong will with the pollutions of fool-success. It was
for this that such as Fox must burn and suffer--to keep that flame' of
agony alive in the spirit of some inspired and stricken boy until the
world of fools had taken it into their custody, and betrayed it!</p>

<p>Otto Hauser had seen it all.</p>

<p>And in the end what was the reward for such a one as Fox? To achieve
the lonely and unhoped-for victories one by one, and to see the very
fools who had denied them acclaim them as their own. To lapse again to
search, to silence, and to waiting while fools greedily pocketed as
their own the coin of one man's spirit, proudly hailed as their
discovery the treasure of another's exploration, loudly celebrated
their own vision as they took unto themselves the fulfilment of
another's prophecy. Ah, the heart must break at last--the heart of Fox,
as well as the heart of genius, the lost boy; the frail, small heart of
man must falter, stop at last from beating; but the heart of folly
would beat on for ever.</p>

<p>So Otto Hauser would have none of it. He would grow hot over
nothing. He would try to see the truth for himself, and let it go at
that.</p>

<p>This was Otto Hauser as George came to know him. In the confidence
of friendship Otto held up a mirror to his own soul, affording a clear,
unposed reflection of his quiet, unassuming, and baffling integrity;
but in the same mirror he also revealed, without quite being aware of
it, the stronger and more shining image of Fox Edwards.</p>

<p>George knew how fortunate he was to have as his editor a man like
Fox. And as time went on, and his respect and admiration for the older
man warmed to deep affection, he realized that Fox had become for him
much more than editor and friend. Little by little it seemed to George
that he had found in Fox the father he had lost and had long been
looking for. And so it was that Fox became a second father to him--the
father of his spirit.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="chapter1-03"></a>3. The Microscopic Gentleman from
Japan</h2>

<p>In the old house where George lived that year Mr. Katamoto occupied
the ground floor just below him, and in a little while they got to know
each other very well. It might be said that their friendship began in
mystification and went on to a state of security and staunch
understanding.</p>

<p>Not that Mr. Katamoto ever forgave George when he erred. He was
always instantly ready to inform him that he had taken a false step
again (the word is used advisedly), but he was so infinitely patient,
so unflaggingly hopeful of George's improvement, so unfailingly
good-natured and courteous, that no one could possibly have been angry
or failed to try to mend his ways. What saved the situation was
Katamoto's gleeful, childlike sense of humour. He was one of those
microscopic gentlemen from Japan, scarcely five feet tall, thin and
very wiry in his build, and George's barrel chest, broad shoulders,
long, dangling arms, and large feet seemed to inspire his comic
risibilities from the beginning. The first time they met, as they were
just passing each other in the hall, Katamoto began to giggle when he
saw George coming; and as they came abreast, the little man flashed a
great expanse of gleaming teeth, wagged a finger roguishly, and
said:</p>

<p>"Tramp-ling! Tramp-ling!"</p>

<p>For several days, whenever they passed each other in the hall, this
same performance was repeated. George thought the words were very
mysterious, and at first could not fathom their recondite meaning or
understand why the sound of them was enough to set Katamoto off in a
paroxysm of mirth. And yet when he would utter them and George would
look at him in a surprised, inquiring kind of way, Katamoto would bend
double with convulsive laughter and would stamp at the floor like a
child with a tiny foot, shrieking hysterically! "Yis--yis--yis! You are
tramp-ling!"--after which he would flee away.</p>

<p>George inferred that these mysterious references to "tramp-ling"
which always set Katamoto off in such a fit of laughter had something
to do with the bigness of his feet, for Katamoto would look at them
quickly and slyly as he passed, and then giggle. However, a fuller
explanation was soon provided. Katamoto came upstairs one afternoon and
knocked at George's door. When it was opened, he giggled and flashed
his teeth and looked somewhat embarrassed.. After a moment, with
evident hesitancy, he grinned painfully and said:</p>

<p>"If you ple-e-eze, sir! Will you--have some tea--with me--yis?" He
spoke the words very slowly, with a deliberate formality, after which
he flashed a quick, eager, and ingratiating smile.</p>

<p>George told him he would be glad to, and got his coat and started
downstairs with him. Katamoto padded swiftly on ahead, his little feet
shod in felt slippers that made no sound. Half-way down the stairs, as
if the noise of George's heavy tread had touched his funny-bone again,
Katamoto stopped quickly, turned and pointed at George's feet, and
giggled coyly: "Tramp-ling! You are trampling!" Then he turned and
fairly fled away down the stairs and down the hall, shrieking like a
gleeful child. He waited at the door to usher his guest in, introduced
him to the slender, agile little Japanese girl who seemed to stay there
all the time, and finally brought George back into his studio and
served him tea.</p>

<p>It was an amazing place. Katamoto bad redecorated the fine old rooms
and fitted them up according to the whims of his curious taste. The big
back room was very crowded, intricate, and partitioned off into several
small compartments with beautiful Japanese screens. He had also
constructed a flight of stairs and a balcony that extended around three
sides of the room, and on this balcony George could see a couch. The
room was crowded with tiny chairs and tables, and there was an
opulent-looking sofa and cushions. There were a great many small carved
objects and bric-&agrave;-brac, and a strong smell of incense.</p>

<p>The centre of the room, however, had been left entirely bare save
for a big strip of spattered canvas and an enormous plaster figure.
George gathered that he did a thriving business turning out sculptures
for expensive speak-easies, or immense fifteen-foot statues of native
politicians which were to decorate public squares in little towns, or
in the state capitals of Arkansas, Nebraska, Iowa, and Wyoming. Where
and how he had learned this curious profession George never found out,
but he had mastered it with true Japanese fidelity, and so well that
his products were apparently in greater demand than those of American
sculptors. In spite of his small size and fragile build, the man was a
dynamo of energy and could perform the labours of a Titan. God knows
how he did it--where he found the strength.</p>

<p>George asked a question about the big plaster cast in the centre of
the room, and Katamoto took him over and showed it to him, remarking as
he pointed to the creature's huge feet:</p>

<p>"He is--like you!...He is tramp-ling!...Yis!...He is
tramp-ling!"</p>

<p>Then he took George up the stairs on to the balcony, which George
dutifully admired.</p>

<p>"Yis?--You like?" He smiled at George eagerly, a little doubtfully,
then pointed at his couch and said: "I sleep here!" Then he pointed to
the ceiling, which was so low that George had to stoop. "You sleep
there?" said Katamoto eagerly.</p>

<p>George nodded.</p>

<p>Katamoto went on again with a quick smile, but with embarrassed
hesitancy and a painful difficulty in his tone that had not been there
before:</p>

<p>"I here," he said, pointing, "you there--yis?"</p>

<p>He looked at George almost pleadingly, a little desperately--and
suddenly George began to catch on.</p>

<p>"Oh! You mean I am right above you--" Katamoto nodded with instant
relief--"and sometimes when I stay up late you hear me?"</p>

<p>"Yis! Yis!" He kept nodding his head vigorously. "Sometimes--" he
smiled a little painfully--"sometimes--you will be tramp-ling!" He
shook his finger at George with coy reproof and giggled.</p>

<p>"I'm awfully sorry," George said. "Of course, I didn't know you
slept so near--so near the ceiling. When I work late I pace the floor.
It's a bad habit. I'll do what I can to stop it."</p>

<p>"Oh, no-o!" he cried, genuinely distressed. "I not want--how you say
it?--change your life!...If you ple-e-ese, sir! Just little thing--not
wear shoes at night!" He pointed at his own small felt-shod feet and
smiled up at George hopefully. "You like slippers yis?" And he smiled
persuasively again.</p>

<p>After that, of course, George wore slippers. But sometimes he would
forget, and the next morning Katamoto would be rapping at his door
again. He was never angry, he was always patient and good-humoured, he
was always beautifully courteous--but he would always call George to
account. "You were tramp-ling!" he would cry. "Last
night--again--tramp-ling!" And George would tell him he was sorry and
would try not to do it again, and Katamoto would go away giggling,
pausing to turn and wag his finger roguishly and call out once more,
"Tramp-ling!"--after which he would flee downstairs, shrieking with
laughter.</p>

<p>They were good friends.</p>

<p>In the months that followed, again and again George would come in
the house to find the hall below full of sweating, panting movers, over
whom Katamoto, covered from head to foot with clots and lumps of
plaster, would hover prayerfully and with a fearful, pleading grin lest
they mar his work, twisting his small hands together convulsively,
aiding the work along by slight shudders, quick darts of breathless
terror, writhing and shrinking movements of the body, and saying all
the while with an elaborate, strained, and beseeching courtesy:</p>

<p>"Now, if--<i>you</i>--gentleman--a
little!...<i>You</i>...yis--yis--yis-s!" with a convulsive grin.
"<i>Oh-h-h</i>! Yis--yis-s! If you <i>ple-e-ese</i>, sir!...If you
would down--a little--yis-s!--yis-s!--yis-s!" he hissed softly with
that prayerful and pleading grin.</p>

<p>And the movers would carry out of the house and stow into their van
the enormous piecemeal fragments of some North Dakota Pericles, whose
size was so great that one wondered how this dapper, fragile little man
could possibly have fashioned such a leviathan.</p>

<p>Then the movers would depart, and for a space Mr. Katamoto would
loaf and invite his soul. He would come out in the backyard with his
girl, the slender, agile little Japanese--who looked as, if she had
some Italian blood in her as well--and for hours at a time they would
play at handball. Mr. Katamoto would knock the ball up against the
projecting brick wall of the house next door, and every time he scored
a point he would scream with laughter, clapping his small hands
together, bending over weakly and pressing his hand against his
stomach, and staggering about with delight and merriment. Choking with
laughter, he would cry out in a high, delirious voice as rapidly as he
could:</p>

<p>"Yis, yis, yis! Yis, yis, yis! Yis, yis, yis!"</p>

<p>Then he would catch sight of George looking at him from the window,
and this would set him off again, for he would wag his finger and
fairly scream:</p>

<p>"You were tramp-ling!...Yis, yis, yis!...Last night--again
tramp-ling!"</p>

<p>This would reduce him to such a paroxysm of mirth that he would
stagger across the court and lean against the wall, all caved in,
holding his narrow stomach and shrieking faintly.</p>

<p>It was now the full height of steaming summer, and one day early in
August George came home to find the movers in the house again. This
time it was obvious that a work of more than usual magnitude was in
transit. Mr. Katamoto, spattered with plaster, was of course hovering
about in the hall, grinning nervously and fluttering prayerfully around
the husky truckmen. As George came in, two of the men were backing
slowly down the hall, carrying between them an immense head,
monstrously jowled and set in an expression of farseeing statesmanship.
A moment later three more men backed out of the studio, panting and
cursing as they grunted painfully around the flowing fragment of a long
frock coat and the vested splendour of a bulging belly. The first pair
had now gone back in the studio, and when they came out again they were
staggering beneath the trousered shank of a mighty leg and a booted
Atlantean hoof, and as they passed, one of the other men, now returning
for more of the statesman's parts, pressed himself against the wall to
let them by and said:</p>

<p>"Jesus! If the son-of-a-bitch stepped on you with that foot, he
wouldn't leave a grease spot, would he, Joe?"</p>

<p>The last piece of all was an immense fragment of the Solon's arm and
fist, with one huge forefinger pointed upwards in an attitude of solemn
objurgation and avowal.</p>

<p>That figure was Katamoto's masterpiece; and George felt as he saw it
pass that the enormous upraised finger was the summit of his art and
the consummation of his life: Certainly it was the apple of his eye.
George had never seen him before in such a state of extreme agitation.
He fairly prayed above the sweating men: It was obvious that the coarse
indelicacy of their touch made him shudder. The grin was frozen on his
face in an expression of congealed terror. He writhed, he wriggled, he
wrung his little hands, he crooned to them. And if anything had
happened to that fat, pointed finger, George felt sure that he would
have dropped dead on the spot.</p>

<p>At length, however, they got everything stowed away in their big van
without mishap and drove off with their Ozymandias, leaving Mr.
Katamoto, frail, haggard, and utterly exhausted, looking at the kerb.
He came back into the house and saw George standing there and smiled
wanly at him.</p>

<p>"Tramp-ling," he said feebly, and shook his finger, and for the
first time there was no mirth or energy in him.</p>

<p>George had never seen him tired before. It had never occurred to him
that he could get tired. The little man had always been so full of
inexhaustible life. And now, somehow, George felt an unaccountable
sadness to see him so weary and so strangely grey. Katamoto was silent
for a moment, and then he lifted his face and said, almost tonelessly,
yet with a shade of wistful eagerness:</p>

<p>"You see statue--yis?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Kato, I saw it."</p>

<p>"And you like?"</p>

<p>"Yes, very much."</p>

<p>"And--" he giggled a little and made a shaking movement with his
hands--"you see foot?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I sink," he said, "he will be tramp-ling--yis?"--and he made
laughing sound.</p>

<p>"He ought to," George said, "with a hoof like that. It's almost as
big as mine," he added, as an afterthought.</p>

<p>Katamoto seemed delighted with this observation, for he laughed
shrilly and said: "Yis! Yis!"--nodding his head emphatically. He was
silent for another moment, then hesitantly, but with an eagerness that
he could not conceal, he said:</p>

<p>"And you see finger?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Kato."</p>

<p>"And you like?"--quickly, earnestly.</p>

<p>"Very much."</p>

<p>"Big finger--yis?"--with a note of rising triumph in his "Very big,
Kato."</p>

<p>"And <i>pointing</i>--yis?" he said ecstatically, grinning from ear
to ear and pointing his own small finger heavenward.</p>

<p>"Yes, pointing."</p>

<p>He sighed contentedly. "Well, zen," he said, with the appeased' air
of a child, "I'm glad you like."</p>

<p>For a week or so after that George did not see Katamoto again or
even think of him. This was the vacation period at the School for
Utility Cultures, and George was devoting every minute of his time, day
and, night, to a fury of new writing. Then one afternoon; a long
passage completed and the almost illegible pages of his swift scrawl
tossed in a careless heap upon the floor, he sat relaxed, looking out
of his back window, and suddenly he thought of Katamoto again. He
remembered that he had not seen him recently, and it seemed strange
that he had not even heard the familiar thud of the little ball against
the wall outside or the sound of his high, shrill laughter. This
realisation, with its sense of loss, so troubled him that he went
downstairs immediately and pressed Katamoto's bell.</p>

<p>There was no answer. All was silent. He waited, and no one came.
Then he went down to the basement and found the janitor and spoke to
him. He said that Mr. Katamoto had been ill, No, it was not serious, he
thought, but the doctor had advised a rest, a brief period of
relaxation from his exhausting labours, and had sent him for care and
observation to the near-by hospital.</p>

<p>George meant to go to see him, but he was busy with his writing and
kept putting it off. Then one morning, some ten days later, coming back
home after breakfast in a restaurant, he found a moving van backed up
before the house. Katamoto's door was open, and when he looked inside
the moving people had already stripped the apartment almost bare. In
the centre of the once fantastic room, now empty, where Katamoto had
performed his prodigies of work, stood a young Japanese, an
acquaintance of the sculptor, whom George had seen there several times
before. He was supervising the removal of the last furnishings.</p>

<p>The young Japanese looked up quickly, politely, with a toothy grin
of frozen courtesy as George came in. He did not speak until George
asked him how Mr. Katamoto was. And then, with the same toothy, frozen
grin upon his face, the same impenetrable courtesy, he said that Mr.
Katamoto was dead.</p>

<p>George was shocked, and stood there for a moment, knowing there was
nothing more to say, and yet feeling somehow, as people always feel on
these occasions, that there was something that, he <i>ought</i> to say.
He looked at the young Japanese and started to speak, and found himself
looking into the inscrutable, polite, untelling eyes of Asia.</p>

<p>So he said nothing more. He just thanked the young man and went
out.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="chapter1-04"></a>4. Some Things Will Never Change</h2>

<p>Out of his front windows George could see nothing except the sombre
bulk of the warehouse across the street. It was an old building, with a
bleak and ugly front of rusty, indurated brown and a harsh webbing of
fire-escapes, and across the whole width of the facade stretched a
battered wooden sign on which, in faded letters, one could make out the
name--"The Security Distributing Corp." George did not know what a
distributing corporation was, but every day since he had come into this
street to live, enormous motor-vans had driven up before this dingy
building and had backed snugly against the worn plankings of the
loading platform, which ended with a sharp, sheared emptiness four feet
above the pavement. The drivers and their helpers would leap from their
seats, and instantly the quiet depths of the old building would burst
into a furious energy of work, and the air would be filled with harsh
cries:</p>

<p>"Back it up, deh! Back it up! Cuh-<i>mahn</i>! Cuh-<i>mahn</i>!
Givvus a hand, youse guys! Hey-y! <i>You!</i>"</p>

<p>They looked at one another with hard faces of smiling derision,
quietly saying "Jesus!" out of the corners of their mouths. Surly, they
stood upon their rights, defending truculently the narrow frontier of
their duty:</p>

<p>"Wadda I care where it goes! Dat's yoeh look-out! Wat t'hell's it
got to do wit <i>me?</i>"</p>

<p>They worked with speed and power and splendid aptness, furiously,
unamiably, with high, exacerbated voices, spurred and goaded by their
harsh unrest.</p>

<p>The city was their stony-hearted mother, and from her breast they
had drawn a bitter nurture. Born to brick and asphalt, to crowded
tenements and swarming streets, stunned into sleep as children beneath
the sudden slamming racket of the elevated trains, taught to fight, to
menace, and to struggle in a world of savage violence and incessant
din, they had had the city's qualities stamped into their flesh and
movements, distilled through all their tissues, etched with the city's
acid into their tongue and brain and vision. Their faces were tough and
seamed, the skin thick, dry, without a hue of freshness or of colour.
Their pulse beat with the furious rhythm of the city's stroke: ready in
an instant with a curse, metallic clangours sounded from their twisted
lips, and their hearts were filled with a dark, immense, and secret
pride.</p>

<p>Their souls were like the asphalt visages of city streets. Each day
the violent colours of a thousand new sensations swept across them, and
each day all sound and sight and fury were erased from their unyielding
surfaces. Ten thousand furious days had passed about them, and they had
no memory. They lived like creatures born full-grown into present time,
shedding the whole accumulation of the past with every breath, and all
their lives were written in the passing of each actual moment.</p>

<p>And they were sure and certain, for ever wrong, but always
confident. They had no hesitation, they confessed no ignorance or
error, and they knew no doubts. They began each morning with a gibe, a
shout, an oath of hard impatience, eager for the tumult of the day. At
noon they sat strongly in their seats and, through fumes of oil and hot
machinery, addressed their curses to the public at the tricks and
strategies of cunning rivals, the tyranny of the police, the stupidity
of pedestrians, and the errors of less skilful men than they. Each day
they faced the perils of the streets with hearts as calm as if they
were alone upon a country road. Each day, with minds untroubled, they
embarked upon adventures from which the bravest men bred in the
wilderness would have recoiled in terror and desolation.</p>

<p>In the raw days of early spring they had worn shirts of thick black
wool and leather jackets, but now, in summer, their arms were naked,
tattooed, brown, and lean with the play of whipcord muscles. The power
and precision with which they worked stirred in George a deep emotion
of respect, and also touched him with humility. For whenever he saw it,
his own life, with its conflicting desires, its uncertain projects and
designs, its labours begun in hope and so often ended in incompletion,
by comparison with the lives of these men who, had learned to use their
strength and talents perfectly, seemed faltering, blind, and
baffled.</p>

<p>At night, too, five times a week, the mighty vans would line up at
the kerb in an immense and waiting caravan. They were covered now with
great tarpaulins, small green lamps were burning on each side, and the
drivers, their faces faintly lit with the glowing points of cigarettes,
would be talking quietly in the shadows of their huge machines. Once
George had asked one of the drivers the destination of these nightly
journeys, and the man had told him that they went to Philadelphia, and
would return again by morning.</p>

<p>The sight of these great vans at night, sombre, silent, yet alive
with powerful expectancy as their drivers waited for the word to start,
gave George a sense of mystery and joy. These men were part of that
great company who love the night, and he felt a bond of union with
them. For he had always loved the night more dearly than the day, and
the energies of his life had risen to their greatest strength in the
secret and exultant heart of darkness.</p>

<p>He knew the joys and labours of such men as these. He could see the
shadowy procession of their vans lumbering through the sleeping towns,
and feel the darkness, the cool fragrance of the country, on his face.
He could see the drivers hunched behind the wheels, their senses all
alert in the lilac dark, their eyes fixed hard upon the road to curtain
off the loneliness of the land at night. And he knew the places where
they stopped to eat, the little all-night lunch-rooms warm with greasy
light, now empty save for the dozing authority of the aproned Greek
behind the counter, and now filled with the heavy shuffle of the
drivers' feet, the hard and casual intrusions of their voices.</p>

<p>They came in, flung themselves upon the row of stools, and gave
their orders. And as they waited, their hunger drawn into sharp focus
by the male smells of boiling coffee, frying eggs and onions, and
sizzling hamburgers, they took the pungent, priceless, and uncostly
solace of a cigarette, lit between cupped hand and strong-seamed mouth,
drawn deep and then exhaled in slow fumes from the nostrils. They
poured great gobs and gluts of thick tomato ketchup on their
hamburgers, tore with blackened fingers at the slabs of fragrant bread,
and ate with jungle lust, thrusting at plate and cup with quick and
savage gulpings.</p>

<p>Oh, he was with them, of them, for them, blood brother of their joy
and hunger to the last hard swallow, the last deep, ease of sated
bellies, the last slow coil of blue expiring from their grateful lungs.
Their lives seemed glorious to him in the magic dark of summer. They
swept cleanly through the night into the first light and bird song of
the morning, into the morning of new joy upon the earth; and as he
thought of this it seemed to him that the secret, wild, and lonely
heart of man was young and living in the darkness, and could never
die.</p>

<hr align="center" width="15%">
<p>Before him, all that summer of 1929, in the broad window of the
warehouse, a man sat at a desk and looked out into the street, in a
posture that never changed. George saw him there whenever he glanced
across, yet he never saw him do anything but look out of the window
with a fixed, abstracted stare. At first the man had been such an
unobtrusive part of his surroundings that he had seemed to fade into'
them, and had gone almost unnoticed. Then Esther, having observed him
there, pointed to him one day and said merrily:</p>

<p>"There's our friend in the Distributing Corp again! What do you
suppose he distributes? I've never seen him do anything! Have you
noticed him--hah?" she cried eagerly. "God! It's the strangest thing I
ever saw!" She laughed richly, made a shrug of bewildered protest, and,
after a moment, said with serious wonder: "Isn't it queer? What do you
suppose a man like that can do? What do you suppose he's thinking
of?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," George said indifferently. "Of nothing, I
suppose."</p>

<p>Then they forgot the man and turned to talk of other things, yet
from that moment the man's singular presence was pricked out in
George's mind and he began to watch him with hypnotic fascination,
puzzled by the mystery of his immobility and his stare.</p>

<p>And after that, as soon as Esther came in every day, she would
glance across the street and cry out in a jolly voice which had in it
the note of affectionate satisfaction and assurance that people have
when they see some familiar and expected object:</p>

<p>"Well, I see our old friend, The Distributing Corp, is still looking
out of his window! I wonder what he's thinking of to-day."</p>

<p>She would turn away, laughing. Then, for a moment, with her
childlike fascination for words and rhythms, she gravely meditated
their strange beat, silently framing and pronouncing with her lips a
series of meaningless sounds--"Corp-Borp-Forp-Dorp-Torp"--and at length
singing out in a gleeful chant, and with an air of triumphant
discovery:</p>

<blockquote>"The Distributing Corp, the Distributing Corp,<br>
He sits all day and he does no Worp!"</blockquote>

<p>George protested that her rhyme made no sense, but she threw back
her encrimsoned face and screamed with laughter.</p>

<p>But after a while they stopped laughing about the man. For, obscure
as his employment seemed, incredible and comical as his indolence had
been when they first noticed it, there came to be something impressive,
immense, and formidable in the quality of that fixed stare. Day by day,
a thronging traffic of life and business passed before him in the
street; day by day, the great vans came, the drivers, handlers, and
packers swarmed before his eyes, filling, the air with their oaths and
cries, irritably intent upon their labour but the man in the window
never looked at them, never gave any, sign that he heard them, never
seemed to be aware of their existence--he just sat there and looked
out, his eyes fixed in an abstracted stare.</p>

<p>In the course of George Webber's life, many things of no great
importance in themselves had become deeply embedded in his memory,
stuck there like burs in a scottie's tail; and always they were little
things which, in an instant of clear perception, had riven his heart
with some poignant flash of meaning. Thus he remembered, and would
remember for ever, the sight of Esther's radiant, earnest face when,
unexpectedly one night, he caught sight of it as it flamed and
'vanished in a crowd of grey, faceless faces in Times Square. So, too,
he remembered two deaf mutes he had seen talking on their fingers in a
subway train; and a ringing peal of children's laughter in a desolate
street at sunset; and the waitresses in their dingy little rooms across
the backyard, washing, ironing, and rewashing day after day the few
adornments of their shabby finery, in endless preparations for a
visitor who never came.</p>

<p>And now, to his store of treasured trivia was added the memory of
this man's face--thick, white, expressionless, set in its stolid and
sorrowful stare. Immutable, calm, impassive, it became for him the
symbol of a kind of permanence in the rush and sweep of chaos in the
city, where all things come and go and pass and are so soon forgotten.
For, day after day, as he watched the man and tried to penetrate his
mystery, at last it seemed to him that he had found the answer.</p>

<p>And after that, in later years, whenever he remembered the man's
face, the time was fixed at the end of a day in late summer.
Without-violence or heat, the last rays of the sun fell on the warm
brick of the building and painted it with a sad, unearthly light. In
the window the man sat, always looking out. He never wavered in his
gaze, his eyes were calm and sorrowful, and on his face was legible the
exile of an imprisoned spirit.</p>

<p>That man's face became for him the face of. Darkness and of Time. It
never spoke, and yet it had a voice--a voice that seemed to have the
whole earth in it. It was the voice of evening and of night, and in it
were the blended tongues of all those men who have passed through the
heat and fury of the day, and who now lean quietly upon the sills of
evening. In it was the whole vast hush and weariness that comes upon
the city at the hour of dusk, when the chaos of another day is ended,
and when everything--streets, buildings, and eight million
people--breathe slowly, with a tired and sorrowful joy. And in that
single tongueless voice was the knowledge of all their tongues.</p>

<p>"Child, child," it said, "have patience and belief, for life is many
days, and each present hour will pass away. Son, son, you have been mad
and drunken, furious and wild, filled with hatred and despair, and all
the dark confusions of the soul--but so have we. You found the earth
too great for your one life, you found your brain and sinew smaller
than the hunger and desire that fed on them--but it has been this way
with all men. You have stumbled on in darkness, you have been pulled in
opposite directions, you have faltered, you have missed the way--but,
child, this is the chronicle of the earth. And now, because you have
known madness and despair, and because you will grow desperate again
before you come to evening, we who have stormed the ramparts of the
furious earth and been hurled back, we who have been maddened by the
unknowable and bitter mystery of love, we who have hungered after fame
and savoured all of life, the tumult, pain, and frenzy, and now sit
quietly by our windows watching all that henceforth never more shall
touch us--we call upon you to take heart, for we can swear to you that
these things pass.</p>

<p>"We have outlived the shift and glitter of so many fashions, we have
seen so many things that come and go, so many words forgotten, so many
flames that flared and were destroyed; yet we know now we are strangers
whose footfalls have not left a print upon the endless streets of life.
We shall not go into the dark again, nor suffer madness, nor admit
despair: we have built a wall about us now. We shall not hear the docks
of time strike out on foreign air, nor wake at morning in some alien
land to think of home: our wandering is over, and our hunger fed. 0
brother, son, and comrade, because we have lived so long and seen so
much, we are content to make our own a few things now, letting millions
pass.</p>

<p>"Some things will never change. Some things will always be the same.
Lean down your ear upon the earth, and listen.</p>

<p>"The voice of forest water in the night, a woman's laughter in the
dark, the clean, hard rattle of raked gravel, the cricketing stitch of
midday in hot meadows, the delicate web of children's voices in bright
air--these things will never change.</p>

<p>"The glitter of sunlight on roughened water, the glory of the stars,
the innocence of morning, the smell of the sea in harbours, the
feathery blur and smoky buddings of young boughs, and something there
that comes and goes and never can be captured, the thorn of spring, the
sharp and tongueless cry--these things will always be the same.</p>

<p>"All things belonging to the earth will never change--the leaf, the
blade, the flower, the wind that cries and sleeps and wakes again, the
trees whose stiff arms clash and tremble in the dark, and the dust of
lovers long since buried in the earth--all things proceeding from the
earth to seasons, all things that lapse and change and come again upon
the earth--these things will always be the same, for they come up from
the earth that never changes, they go back into the earth that lasts
for ever. Only the earth endures, but it endures for ever.</p>

<p>"The tarantula, the adder, and the asp will also never change. Pain
and death will always be the same. But under the pavements trembling
like a pulse, under the buildings trembling like a cry, under the waste
of time, under the hoof of the beast above the broken bones of cities,
there will be something growing like a flower, something bursting from
the earth again, for ever deathless, faithful, coming into life again
like April."</p>

<h2><a name="chapter1-05"></a>5. The Hidden Terror</h2>

<p>Hand looked at the yellow envelope curiously and turned it over and
over in his hand. It gave him a feeling of uneasiness and suppressed
excitement to see his name through the transparent front. He was not
used to receiving telegrams. Instinctively he delayed opening it
because he dreaded what it might contain. Some forgotten incident in
his childhood made him associate telegrams with bad news. Who could
have sent it? And what could it be about? Well, open it, you fool, and
find out!</p>

<p>He ripped off the flap and took out the message. He read it quickly,
first glancing at the signature. It was from his Uncle Mark Joyner:</p>

<p>"YOUR AUNT MAW DIED LAST NIGHT STOP FUNERAL THURSDAY IN LIBYA HILL
STOP COME HOME IF YOU CAN."</p>

<p>That was all. No explanation of what she had died of. Old age, most
likely. Nothing else could have killed her. She hadn't been sick or'
they would have let him know before this.</p>

<p>The news shook him profoundly. But it was not grief he felt so much
as a deep sense of loss, almost impersonal in its quality--a sense of
loss and unbelief such as one might feel to discover suddenly that some
great force 'in nature had ceased to operate. He couldn't take it in.
Ever since his mother had died when he was only eight years old, Aunt
Maw had been the most solid and permanent fixture in his boy's
universe. She was a spinster, the older sister of his mother and of his
Uncle Mark, and she had taken charge of him and brought him up with all
the inflexible zeal of her puritanical nature. She had done her best to
make a Joyner of him and a credit to the narrow, provincial, mountain
clan to which she belonged.-In this she had failed, and his defection
from the ways of Joyner righteousness had caused her deep pain. He had
known this for a long time; but now he realised, too, more clearly than
he had, ever done before, that she had never faltered in her duty to
him as she saw it. As he thought about her life the felt an
inexpressible pity for her, and a surge of tenderness and affection
almost choked him.</p>

<p>As far back as he could remember, Aunt Maw had seemed to him an
ageless crone, as old as God. He could still hear her voice--that
croaking monotone which had gone on and on in endless stories of her
past, peopling his childhood world with the whole host of Joyners dead
and buried in the hills of Zebulon in ancient days before the Civil
War. And almost every tale she had told him was a chronicle of
sickness, death, and sorrow. She had known about all the Joyners for
the last hundred years, and whether they had died of consumption,
typhoid fever, pneumonia, meningitis, or pellagra, and she had relived
each incident in their lives with an air of croaking relish. From her
he had got a picture of his mountain kinsmen that was constantly dark
with the terrors of misery and sudden death, a picture made ghostly at
frequent intervals by supernatural revelations. The Joyners, so she
thought, had been endowed with occult powers by the Almighty, and weft
for ever popping up on country roads and speaking to people as they
passed, only to have it turn out later that they had been fifty miles
away at the time. They were for ever hearing voices and receiving
premonitions. If a neighbour died suddenly, the Joyners would flock
from miles around 'to sit up with the corpse, and in the flickering
light of pine logs on the hearth they would talk unceasingly through
the night, their droning voices punctuated by the crumbling of the ash
as they told how they had received intimations of the impending death a
week before it happened.</p>

<p>This was the image of the Joyner world which Aunt Maw's tireless
memories had built up in the mind and spirit of the boy. And he had
felt somehow that although other men would live their day and die, the
Joyners were a race apart, not subject to this law. They fed on death
and were triumphant over it, and the Joyners would go on for ever. But
now Aunt Maw the oldest and most death-triumphant Joyner of them all,
was dead...</p>

<p>The funeral was to be on Thursday. This was Tuesday. If he took the
train to-day, he would arrive to-morrow. He knew that all the Joyners
from the hills of Zebulon County in Old Catawba would be gathering even
now to hold their tribal rites of death and sorrow, and if he got there
so soon he would not be able to escape the horror of their brooding
talk. It would be better to wait a day and turn up just before the
funeral.</p>

<p>It was now early September. The new term at the School for Utility
Cultures would not begin until after the middle of the month, George
had not been back to Libya Hill in several years, and he thought he
might remain a week or so to see the town again. But he dreaded the
prospect of staying with his Joyner relatives, especially at a time
like this. Then he remembered Randy Shepperton, who lived next door.
Mr. and Mrs. Shepperton were both dead now, and the older girl had
married and moved away. Randy had a good job in the town and lived on
in the family place with his sister Margaret, who kept house for him.
Perhaps they could put him up. They would understand his feelings. So
he sent a telegram to Randy, asking for his hospitality, and telling
what train he would arrive on.</p>

<p>By the next afternoon, when George went to Pennsylvania Station to
catch his train, he had recovered from the first shock of Aunt Maw's
death. The human mind is a fearful instrument of adaptation, and in
nothing is this more clearly shown than in its mysterious powers of
resilience, self-protection, and self-healing. Unless an event
completely shatters the order of one's life, the mind, if it has youth
and health and time enough, accepts the inevitable and gets itself
ready for the next happening like a grimly dutiful American tourist
who, on arriving at a new town, looks around him, takes his bearings,
and says, "Well, where do I go from here?" So it was with George. The
prospect of the funeral filled him with dread, but that was still a day
off; meanwhile he had a long train ride ahead of him, and he pushed his
sombre feelings into the background and allowed himself to savour
freely the eager excitement which any journey by train always gave
him.</p>

<p>The station, as he entered it, was murmurous with the immense and
distant sound of time. Great slant beams of mottled light fell
ponderously athwart the station's floor, and the calm voice of time
hovered along the walls and ceiling of that mighty room, distilled out
of the voices and movements of the people who swarmed beneath. It had
the murmur of a distant sea, the languorous lapse and flow of waters on
a beach. It was elemental, detached, indifferent to the lives of men.
They contributed to it as drops of rain contribute to a river that
draws its flood and movement majestically from great depths, out of
purple hills at evening.</p>

<p>Few buildings are vast enough to hold the sound of time, and now it
seemed to George that there was a superb fitness in the fact that the
one which held it better than all others should be a railway station.
For here, as nowhere else on earth, men were brought together for a
moment at the beginning or end of their innumerable journeys, here one
saw their greetings and farewells, here, in a single instant, one got
the entire picture of the human destiny. Men came and went, they passed
and vanished, and all were moving through the moments of their lives to
death, all made small tickings in the sound of time--but the voice of
time remained aloof and unperturbed, a drowsy and eternal murmur below
the immense and distant roof.</p>

<p>Each man and woman was full of his own journey. He had one way to
go, one end to reach, through all the shifting complexities of the
crowd. For each it was his journey, and he cared nothing about the
journeys of the others. Here, as George waited, was a traveller who was
afraid that he would miss his train. He was excited, his movements were
feverish and abrupt, he shouted to his porter, he went to the window to
buy his ticket, he had to wait in line, he fairly pranced with
nervousness and kept looking at the clock. Then his wife came quickly
towards him over the polished floor. When she was still some distance
off, she shouted:</p>

<p>"Have you got the tickets? We haven't much time! We'll miss the
train!"</p>

<p>"Don't I know it?" he shouted back in an annoyed tone. "I'm doing
the best I can!"' Then he added bitterly and loudly: "We may make it if
this man in front of me ever gets done buying his ticket!"</p>

<p>The man in front turned on him menacingly. "Now wait a minute,
<i>wait</i> a minute!" he said. "You're not the only one who has to
make a train, you know! I was here before you were! You'll have to wait
your turn like everybody else!"</p>

<p>A quarrel now developed between them. The other travellers who were
waiting for their tickets grew angry and began to mutter. The ticket
agent drummed impatiently on his window and peered out at them with a
sour visage. Finally some young tough down the line called out in tones
of whining irritation:</p>

<p>"Aw, take it outside f' Chris' sake! Give the rest of us a chance!
You guys are holdin' up the line!"</p>

<p>At last the man got his tickets and rushed towards his porter, hot
and excited. The negro waited suave and smiling, full of easy
reassurance:</p>

<p>"You folks don't need to hurry now. You got lotsa time to make that
train. It ain't goin' away without you."</p>

<p>Who were these travellers for whom time lay coiled in delicate
twists of blue steel wire in each man's pocket? Here were a few of
them: a homesick nigger going back to Georgia; a rich young man from an
estate on the Hudson who was going to visit his mother in Washington; a
district superintendent, and three of his agents, of a farm machinery
company, who had been attending a convention of district leaders in the
city; the president of a bank in an Old Catawba town which was
tottering on the edge of ruin, who had come desperately, accompanied by
two local politicians, to petition New York bankers for a loan; a Greek
with tan shoes, a cardboard valise; a swarthy face, and eyes glittering
with mistrust, who had peered in through the ticket seller's window,
saying: "How mucha you want to go to Pittsburgh, eh?"; an effeminate
young man from one of the city universities who was going to make his
weekly lecture on the arts of the theatre to a club of ladies in
Trenton, New Jersey; a lady poetess from a town in Indiana who had been
to New York for her yearly spree of "bohemianism"; a prize-fighter and
his manager on their way to a fight in St. Louis; some Princeton boys
just back from a summer in Europe, on their way home for a short visit
before returning to college; a private soldier in the United States
army, with the cheap, tough, and slovenly appearance of a private
soldier in the United States army; the president of a state university
in the Middle West who had just made an eloquent appeal for funds to
the New York alumni; a young married couple from Mississippi, with
everything new--new clothes, new baggage--and a shy, hostile, and
bewildered look; two little Filipinos, brown as berries and with the
delicate bones of birds, dressed with the foppish perfection of
manikins; women from the suburban towns of New Jersey who had come to
the city to shop; women and girls from small towns in the South and
West, who had come for holidays, sprees, or visits; the managers and
agents of clothing stores in little towns all over the country who had
come to the city to buy new styles and fashions; New Yorkers of a
certain class, flashily dressed, sensual, and with a high, hard finish,
knowing and assured, on their way to vacations in Atlantic City; jaded,
faded, bedraggled women, scolding and jerking viciously at the puny
arms of dirty children; swarthy, scowling, and dominant-looking Italian
men with their dark, greasy, and flabby-looking women, sullen but
submissive both to lust and beatings; and smartly-dressed American
women, obedient to neither bed nor whip, who had assertive, harsh
voices, bold glances, and the good figures but not the living curves,
either of body or of spirit, of love, lust, tenderness, or any female
fullness of the earth whatever.</p>

<p>There were all sorts and conditions of men and travellers: poor
people with the hard, sterile faces of all New Jerseys of the flesh and
spirit; shabby and beaten-looking devils with cheap suitcases
containing a tie, a collar, and a shirt, who had a look of having
dropped for ever off of passing trains into the dirty cinders of new
towns and the hope of some new fortune; the shabby floaters and
drifters of the nation; suave, wealthy, and experienced people who had
been too far, too often, on too many costly trains and ships, and who
never looked out of windows any more; old men and women from the
country on first visits to their children in the city, who looked about
them constantly and suspiciously with the quick eyes of birds and
animals, alert, mistrustful, and afraid. There were people who saw
everything, and people who saw nothing; people who were weary, sullen,
sour, and people who laughed, shouted, and were exultant with the
thrill of the voyage; people who thrust and jostled, and people who
stood quietly and watched and waited; people with amused, superior
looks, and people who glared and bristled pugnaciously. Young, old,
rich, poor, Jews, Gentiles, Negroes, Italians, Greeks, Americans--they
were all there in the station, their infinitely varied destinies
suddenly harmonised and given a moment of intense and sombre meaning as
they were gathered into the murmurous, all-taking unity of time.</p>

<p>George had a berth in car K19. It was not really different in any
respect from any other pullman car, yet for George it had a very
special quality and meaning. For every day K19 bound together two
points upon the continent--the great city and the small town of Libya
Hill where he had been born, eight hundred miles away. It left New York
at one-thirty-five each afternoon, and it arrived in Libya Hill at
eleven-twenty the next morning.</p>

<p>The moment he entered the pullman he was transported instantly from
the vast allness of general humanity in the station into the familiar
geography of his home town. One might have been away for years and
never have seen 'an old familiar face; one might have wandered to the
far ends of the earth; one might have got with child a mandrake root,
or heard mermaids singing, or known the words and music of what songs
the Sirens sang; one might have lived and worked alone for ages in the
canyons of Manhattan until the very memory of home was lost and far as
in a dream: yet the moment that he entered K19 it all came back again,
his feet touched earth, and he was home.</p>

<p>It was uncanny. And what was most wonderful and mysterious about it
was that one could come here to this appointed meeting each day at
thirty-five minutes after one o'clock, one could come here through the
humming traffic of the city to the gigantic portals of the mighty
station, one could walk through the concourse for ever swarming with
its bustle of arrival and departure, one could traverse the great
expanses of the station, peopled with Everybody and haunted by the
voice of time--and then, down those steep stairs, there in the tunnel's
depth, underneath this hive-like universe of life, waiting in its
proper place, no whit different outwardly from all its other grimy
brethren, was K19.</p>

<p>The beaming porter took his bag with a cheerful greeting: "Yes, suh,
Mistah Webbah! Glad to see you, suh! Comin' down to see de folks?"</p>

<p>And as they made their way down the green aisle to his seat, George
told him that he was going home to his aunt's funeral. Instantly the
negro's smile was blotted out, and his face took on an expression of
deep solemnity and respect.</p>

<p>"I'se sorry to hear dat, Mistah Webbah," he said, shaking his head.
"Yes, suh, I'se pow'ful sorry to hear you say dat."</p>

<p>Even before these words, were out of mind, another voice from the
seat behind was raised in greeting, and George did not have to turn to
know who it was. It was Sol Isaacs, of The Toggery, and George knew
that he had been up to the city on a buying trip, a pilgrimage that he
made four times a year. Somehow the knowledge of this commercial
punctuality warmed the young man's heart, as did the friendly
beak-nosed face, the gaudy shirt, the bright neck-tie, and the dapper
smartness of the light grey suit--for Sol was what is known as "a
snappy dresser".</p>

<p>George looked around him now to see if there were any others that he
knew. Yes, there was the tall, spare, brittle, sandy-complexioned
figure of the banker, Jarvis Riggs, and on the seat opposite, engaged
in conversation with him, were two other local dignitaries. He
recognized the round-featured, weak amiability of the Mayor, Baxter
Kennedy; and, sprawled beside him, his long, heavy shanks thrust out
into the aisle, the bald crown of his head with its tonsured fringe of
black hair thrown back against the top of the seat, his loose-jowled
face hanging heavy as he talked, was the large, well-oiled beefiness of
Pa on Flack, who manipulated the politics of Libya Hill and was called
"Parson" because he never missed a prayer-meeting at the Campbellite
Church. They were talking earnestly and loudly, and George could
overhear fragments of their conversation:</p>

<p>"Market Street--oh, give me Market Street any day!"</p>

<p>"Gay Rudd is asking two thousand a front foot for his. He'll get it,
too. I wouldn't take a cent less than twenty-five, and I'm not selling
anyway."</p>

<p>"You mark my word, she'll go to three before another year is out!
And that's not Al! That's only the beginning!"</p>

<p>Could this be Libya Hill that they were talking about? It didn't
sound at all like the sleepy little mountain town he had known all his
life. He rose from his seat and went over to the group.</p>

<p>"Why, hello, Webber! Hello, son!" Parson Flack screwed up his face
into something that was meant for an ingratiating smile and showed his
big yellow teeth. "Glad to see you. How are you, son?"</p>

<p>George shook hands all round and stood beside them a moment.</p>

<p>"We heard you speaking to the porter when you came in," said the
Mayor, with a look of solemn commiseration on his weak face. "Sorry,
son. We didn't know about it. We've been away a week. Happen
suddenly?...Yes, yes, of course. Well, your aunt was pretty old. Got to
expect that sort of thing at her time of life. She was a good woman, a
good woman. Sorry, son, that such a sad occasion brings you home."</p>

<p>There was a short silence after this, as if the others wished it
understood that the Mayor had voiced their sentiments, too. Then, this
mark of respect to the dead being accomplished, Jarvis Riggs spoke up
heartily:</p>

<p>"You ought to stay around a while, Webber. You wouldn't know the
town. Things are booming down our way. Why, only the other day Mack
Judson paid three hundred thousand for the Draper Block. The building
is a dump, of course--what he paid for was the land. That's five
thousand a foot. Pretty good for Libya Hill, eh? The Reeves estate has
bought up all the land on Parker Street below Parker Hill. They're
going to build the whole thing up with business property. That's the
way it is all over town. Within a few years Libya Hill is going to be
the largest and most beautiful city in the state. You mark my
words."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Parson Flack, nodding his head ponderously, knowingly,
"and I hear they've been trying to buy your uncle's property on South
Main Street, there at the corner of the Square. A syndicate wants to
tear down the hardware store and put up a big hotel. Your uncle
wouldn't sell. He's smart."</p>

<p>George returned to his seat feeling confused and bewildered. He was
going back home for the first time in several years, and he wanted to
see the town as he remembered it. Evidently he would find it
considerably changed. But what was this that was happening to it? He
couldn't make it out. It disturbed him vaguely, as one is always
disturbed and shaken by the sudden realisation of Time's changes in
something that one has known all one's life.</p>

<p>The train had hurtled like a projectile through its tube beneath the
Hudson River to emerge in the dazzling sunlight of a September
afternoon, and now it was racing across the flat desolation of the
Jersey meadows. George sat by the window and saw the smouldering dumps,
the bogs, the blackened factories slide past, and felt that one of the
most wonderful things in the world is the experience of being on a
train. It is so different from watching a train go by. To anyone
outside, a speeding train is a thunderbolt of driving rods, a hot hiss
of steam, a blurred flash of coaches, a wall of movement and of noise,
a shriek, a wail, and then just emptiness and absence, with a feeling
of "There goes everybody!" without knowing who anybody is. And all of a
sudden the watcher feels the vastness and loneliness of America, and
the nothingness of all those little lives burled past upon the
immensity of the continent. But if one is <i>inside</i> the train,
everything is different. The train itself is a miracle of man's
handiwork, and everything about it is eloquent of human purpose and
direction. One feels the brakes go on when the train is coming to a
river, and one knows that the old gloved hand of cunning is at the
throttle. One's own sense of manhood and of mastery is heightened by
being on a train. And all the other people, how real they are! One sees
the fat black porter with his ivory teeth and the great swollen gland
on the back of his neck, and one warms with friendship for him. One
looks at all the pretty girls with a sharpened eye and an awakened
pulse. One observes all the other passengers with lively interest, and
feels that he has known them for ever. In the morning most of them will
be gone out of his life; some will drop out silently at night through
the dark, drugged snoring of the sleepers; but now all are caught upon
the wing and held for a moment in the peculiar intimacy of this
pullman-car which has become their common home for a night.</p>

<p>Two travelling salesmen have struck up a chance acquaintance in the
smoking-room, entering immediately the vast confraternity of their
trade, and in a moment they are laying out the continent as familiarly
as if it were their own backyard. They tell about running into
So-and-So in St. Paul last July, and----</p>

<p>"Who do you suppose I met coming out of Brown's Hotel in Denver just
a week ago?"</p>

<p>"You don't mean it! I haven't seen old Joe in years!"</p>

<p>"And Jim Withers--they've transferred him to the Atlanta
office!"</p>

<p>"Going to New Orleans?"</p>

<p>"No, I'll make it this trip. I was there in May."</p>

<p>With such talk as this one grows instantly familiar. One enters
naturally into the lives of all these people, caught here for just a
night and hurtled down together across the continent at sixty miles an
hour, and one becomes a member of the whole huge family of the
earth.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is our strange and haunting paradox here in
America--that we are fixed and certain only when we are in movement. At
any rate, that is how it seemed to young George Webber, who was never
so assured of his purpose as when he was going somewhere on a train.
And he never had the sense of home so much as when he felt that he was
going there. It was only when he got there that his homelessness
began.</p>

<p>At the far end of the car a man stood up and started back down the
aisle towards the washroom. He walked with a slight limp and leaned
upon a cane, and with his free hand he held on to the backs of the
seats to brace himself against the lurching of the train. As he came
abreast of George, who sat there gazing out the window, the man stopped
abruptly. A strong, good-natured voice, warm, easy, bantering,
unafraid, unchanged--exactly as it was when it was fourteen years of
age--broke like a flood of living light upon his consciousness:</p>

<p>"Well I'll be dogged! Hi, there, Monkus! Where you goin'?"</p>

<p>At the sound of the old jesting nickname George looked up quickly.
It was Nebraska Crane. The square, freckled, sunburned visage had the
same humorous friendliness it had always had, and the tar-black
Cherokee eyes looked out with the same straight, deadly fearlessness.
The big brown paw came out and they clasped each other firmly. And,
instantly, it was like coming home to a strong and friendly place. In
another moment they were seated together, talking with the familiarity
of people whom no gulf of years and distance could alter or
separate.</p>

<p>George had seen Nebraska Crane only once in all the years since he
himself had first left Libya Hill and gone away to college. But he had
not lost sight of him. Nobody had lost sight of Nebraska Crane. That
wiry, fearless little figure of the Cherokee boy who used to comedown
the hill on Locust Street with the bat slung over his shoulder and the
well-oiled fielder's mitt protruding from his hip-pocket had been
prophetic of a greater destiny, for Nebraska had become a professional
baseball player, he had crashed into the big leagues, and his name had
been emblazoned in the papers every day.</p>

<p>The newspapers had had a lot to do with his seeing Nebraska that
other time. It was in August 1925, just after George had returned to
New York from his first trip abroad. That very night, in fact, a little
before midnight, as he was seated in a Childs Restaurant with smoking
wheatcakes, coffee, and an ink-fresh copy of next morning's
<i>Herald-Tribune</i> before him, the headline jumped out at him:
"Crane Slams Another Homer". He read the account of the game eagerly,
and felt a strong desire to see Nebraska again and to get back in his
blood once more the honest tang of America. Acting on a sudden impulse,
he decided to call him up. Sure enough, his name was in the book, with
an address way up in the Bronx. He gave the number and waited. A man's
voice answered the phone, but at first he didn't recognise it.</p>

<p>"Hello!...Hello!...Is Mr. Crane there?...Is that you, Bras?"</p>

<p>"Hello." Nebraska's voice was hesitant, slow, a little hostile,
touched with the caution and suspicion of mountain people when speaking
to a stranger. "Who is that?...Who?...Is that <i>you</i>,
Monk?"--suddenly and quickly, as he recognised who it was. "Well I'll
be dogged!" he cried. His tone was delighted, astounded, warm with
friendly greeting now, and had the somewhat high and faintly howling
quality that mountain people's voices often have when they are talking
to someone over the telephone: the tone was full, sonorous,
countrified, and a little puzzled, as if he were yelling to someone on
an adjoining mountain peak on a gusty day in autumn when the wind was
thrashing through the trees. "Where'd you come from? How the hell are
you, boy?" he yelled before George could answer. "Where you been all
this time, anyway?"</p>

<p>"I've been in Europe. I just got back this morning."</p>

<p>"Well I'll be dogged!"--still astounded, delighted, full of howling
friendliness. "When am I gonna see you? How about comin' to the game
to-morrow? I'll fix you up. And say," he went on rapidly, "if you can
stick aroun' after the game, I'll take you home to meet the wife and
kid. How about it?"</p>

<p>So it was agreed. George went to the game and saw Nebraska knock
another home run, but he remembered best what happened afterwards. When
the player had had his shower and had dressed, the two friends left the
ball park, and as they went out a crowd of young boys who had been
waiting at the gate rushed upon them. They were those dark-faced,
dark-eyed, dark-haired little urchins who spring up like dragon seed
from the grim pavements of New York, but in whose tough little faces
and raucous voices there still remains, curiously, the innocence and
faith of children everywhere.</p>

<p>"It's Bras!" the children cried. "Hi, Bras! Hey, Bras!" In a moment
they were pressing round him in a swarming horde, deafening the ears
with their shrill cries, begging, shouting, tugging at his sleeves,
doing everything they could to attract his attention, holding dirty
little scraps of paper towards him, stubs of pencils, battered little
note-books, asking him to sign his autograph.</p>

<p>He behaved with the spontaneous warmth and kindliness of his
character. He scrawled his name out rapidly on a dozen grimy bits of
paper, skilfully working his way along through the yelling, pushing,
jumping group, and all the time keeping up a rapid fire of banter,
badinage, and good-natured reproof:</p>

<p>"All right--give it here, then!...Why don't you fellahs pick on
somebody else once in a while?...Say, boy!" he said suddenly, turning
to look down at one unfortunate child, and pointing an accusing finger
at him--"What you doin' aroun' here again, to-day? I signed my name fer
you at least a dozen times!"</p>

<p>"No sir, Misteh Crane!" the urchin earnestly replied. "Honest--not
me!"</p>

<p>"Ain't that right?" Nebraska said, appealing to the other children.
"Don't this boy keep comin' back here every day?"</p>

<p>They grinned, delighted at the chagrin of their fellow petitioner.
"Dat's right, Misteh Crane! Dat guy's got a whole book wit' nuttin' but
yoeh name in it!"</p>

<p>"Ah-h!" the victim cried, and turned upon his betrayers bitterly.
"What youse guys tryin' to do--get wise or somep'n? Honest, Misteh
Crane!"--he looked up earnestly again at Nebraska--"Don't believe 'em!
I jest want yoeh ottygraph! Please, Misteh Crane, it'll only take a
minute!"</p>

<p>For a moment more Nebraska stood looking down at the child with an
expression of mock sternness; at last he took the outstretched
note-book, rapidly scratched his name across a page, and handed it
back. And as he did so, he put his big paw on the urchin's head and
gave it a clumsy pat; then, gently and playfully, he shoved it from
him, and walked off down the street.</p>

<p>The apartment where Nebraska lived was like a hundred thousand
others in the Bronx. The ugly yellow brick building had a false front,
with meaningless little turrets at the corners of the roof, and a
general air of spurious luxury about it. The rooms were rather small
and cramped, and were made even more so by the heavy, over-stuffed
Grand Rapids furniture. The walls of the living-room, painted a
mottled, rusty cream, were bare except for a couple of sentimental
coloured prints, while the place of honour over the mantel was reserved
for an enlarged and garishly tinted photograph of Nebraska's little son
at the age of two, looking straight and solemnly out at all comers from
a gilded oval frame.</p>

<p>Myrtle, Nebraska's wife, was small and plump, and pretty in a
doll-like way. Her corn-silk hair was frizzled in a halo about her
face, and her chubby features were heavily accented by rouge and
lipstick. But she was simple and natural in her talk and bearing, and
George liked her at once. She welcomed him with a warm and friendly
smile and said she had heard a lot about him.</p>

<p>They all sat down. The child, who was three or four years old by
this time, and who had been shy, holding on to his mother's dress and
peeping out from behind her, now ran across the room to his father and
began climbing all over him. Nebraska and Myrtle asked George a lot of
questions about himself, what he had been doing, where he had been, and
especially what countries he had visited in Europe. They seemed to
think of Europe as a place so far away that anyone who had actually
been there was touched with an unbelievable aura of strangeness and
romance.</p>

<p>"Whereall did you go over there, anyway?" asked Nebraska.</p>

<p>"Oh, everywhere, Bras," George said--"France, England, Holland,
Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Italy--all over the place."</p>

<p>"Well I'll be dogged!"--in frank astonishment. "You sure do git
aroun', don't you?"</p>

<p>"Not the way <i>you</i> do, Bras. You're travelling most of the
time."</p>

<p>"<i>Who--me?</i> Oh, hell, I don't git anywhere--just the same ole
places. Chicago, St. Looie, Philly--I seen 'em all so often I could
find my way blindfolded!" He waved them aside with a gesture of his
hand. Then, suddenly, he looked at George as though he were just seeing
him for the first time, and he reached over and slapped him on the knee
and exclaimed: "Well I'll be dogged! Hot+ you doin', anyway,
Monkus?"</p>

<p>"Oh, can't complain. How about you? But I don't need to ask that.
I've been reading all about you in the papers."</p>

<p>"Yes, Monkus," he said. "I been havin' a good year. But, boy!"--he
shook his head suddenly and grinned--"Do the ole dogs feel it!" He was
silent a moment, then he went on quietly:</p>

<p>"I been up here since 1919--that's seven years, and it's a long time
in this game. Not many of 'em stay much longer. When you been shaggin'
flies as long as that you may lose count, but you don't need to
count--your legs'll tell you."</p>

<p>"But, good Lord, Bras, <i>you're</i> all right! Why, the way you got
around out there to-day you looked like a colt!"</p>

<p>"Yeah," Nebraska said, "maybe I <i>looked</i> like a colt, but I
felt like a plough horse." He fell silent again, then he tapped his
friend gently on the knee with his brown hand and said abruptly: "No,
Monkus. When you been in this business as long as I have, you know
it."</p>

<p>"Oh, come on, Bras, quit your kidding!" said George, remembering
that the player was only two years older than himself. "You're still a
young man. Why, you're only twenty-seven!"</p>

<p>"Sure, sure," Nebraska answered quietly. "But it's like I say. You
cain't stay in this business much longer than I have. Of course, Cobb
an' Speaker an' a few like that--they was up here a long time. But
eight years is about the average, an' I been here seven already. So if
I can hang on a few years more, I won't have no kick to make...Hell!"
he said in a moment, with the old hearty ring in his voice, "I ain't
got no kick to make, no-way. If I got my release to-morrow, I'd still
feel I done all right...Ain't that so, Buzz?" he cried genially to the
child, who had settled down on his knee, at the same time seizing the
boy and cradling him comfortably in his strong arm. "Ole Bras has done
all right, ain't he?"</p>

<p>"That's the way me an' Bras feel about it," remarked Myrtle, who
during this conversation had been rocking back and forth, placidly
ruminating on a wad of gum. "Along there last year it looked once or
twice as if Bras might git traded. He said to me one day before the
game, 'Well, ole lady, if I don't git some hits to-day somethin' tells
me you an' me is goin' to take a trip.' So I says, 'Trip where?' An' he
says, 'I don't know, but they're goin' to sell me down the river if I
don't git goin', an' somethin' tells me it's now or never!' So I just
looks at him," continued Myrtle placidly, "an' I says, 'Well, what do
you want me to do? Do you want me to come to-day or not?' You know,
gener'ly, Bras won't let me come when he ain't hittin'--he says it's
bad luck. But he just looks at me a minute, an' I can see him sort of
studyin' it over, an' all of a sudden he makes up his mind an' says,
'Yes, come on if you want to; I couldn't have no more bad luck than I
been havin', no-way, an' maybe it's come time fer things to change, so
you come on.' Well, I went--an' I don't know whether I brought him luck
or not, but somethin' did," said Myrtle, rocking in her chair
complacently.</p>

<p>"Dogged if she didn't!" Nebraska chuckled. "I got three hits out of
four times up that day, an' two of 'em was home runs!"</p>

<p>"Yeah," Myrtle agreed, "an' that Philadelphia fast-ball thrower was
throwin' 'em, too."</p>

<p>"He sure was!" said Nebraska.</p>

<p>"I know," went on Myrtle, chewing placidly, "because I heard some of
the boys say later that it was like he was throwin' 'em up there from
out of the bleachers, with all them men in shirt-sleeves right behind
him, an' the boys said half the time they couldn't even see the ball.
But Bras must of saw it--or been lucky--because he hit two home runs
off of him, an' that pitcher didn't like it, either. The second one
Bras got, he went stompin' an' tearin' around out there like a wild
bull. He sure did look mad," said Myrtle in her customary placid
tone.</p>

<p>"Maddest man I ever seen!" Nebraska cried delightedly. "I thought he
was goin' to dig a hole plumb through to China...But that's the way it
was. She's right about it. That was the day I got goin'. I know one of
the boys said to me later, 'Bras,' he says, 'we all thought you was
goin' to take a ride, but you sure dug in, didn't you?' That's the way
it is in this game. I seen Babe Ruth go fer weeks when he couldn't hit
a balloon, an' all of a sudden he lams into it. Seems like he just
cain't miss from then on."</p>

<p>All this had happened four years ago. Now the two friends had met
again, and were seated side by side in the speeding train, talking and
catching up on one another. When George explained the reason for his
going home, Nebraska turned to him with open-mouthed astonishment,
genuine concern written in the frown upon his brown and homely
face.</p>

<p>"Well, what d'you know about that!" he said. "I sure am sorry,
Monk." He was silent while he thought about it, and embarrassed, not
knowing what to say. Then, after a moment: "Gee!"--he shook his
head--"your aunt was one swell cook! I never will fergit it! Remember
how she used to feed us kids--every danged one of us in the whole
neighbourhood?" He paused, then grinned up shyly at his friend: "I sure
wish I had a fistful of them good ole cookies of hers right this
minute!"</p>

<p>Nebraska's right ankle was taped and bandaged; a heavy cane rested
between his knees. George asked him what had happened.</p>

<p>"I pulled a tendon," Nebraska said, "an' got laid off. So I thought
I might as well run down an' see the folks. Myrtle, she couldn't
come--the kid's got to git ready fer school."</p>

<p>"How are they?" George asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, fine, fine. All wool an' a yard wide, both of 'em!" He was
silent for a moment, then he looked at his friend with a tolerant
Cherokee grin and said: "But I'm crackin' up, Monkus. Guess I cain't
stan' the gaff much more."</p>

<p>Nebraska was only thirty-one now, and George was incredulous.
Nebraska smiled good-naturedly again:</p>

<p>"That's an ole man in baseball, Monk. I went up when I was
twenty-one. I been aroun' a long time."</p>

<p>The quiet resignation of the player touched his friend with sadness.
It was hard and painful for him to face the fact that this strong and
fearless creature, who had stood in his life always for courage and for
victory, should now be speaking with such ready acceptance of
defeat.</p>

<p>"But, Bras," he protested, "you've been hitting just as well this
season as you ever did! I've read about you in the papers, and the
reporters have all said the same thing."</p>

<p>"Oh, I can still hit 'em," Nebraska quietly agreed. "It ain't the
hittin' that bothers me. That's the last thing you lose, anyway.
Leastways, it's goin' to be that way with me, an' I talked to other
fellahs who said it was that way with them." After a pause he went on
in a low tone: "If this ole leg heals up in time, I'll go on back an'
git in the game again an' finish out the season. An' if I'm lucky,
maybe they'll keep me on a couple more years, because they know I can
still hit. But, hell," he added quietly, "they know I'm through. They
already got me all tied up with string."</p>

<p>As Nebraska talked, George saw that the Cherokee in him was the same
now as it had been when he was a boy. His cheerful fatalism had always
been the source of his great strength and courage. That was why he had
never been afraid of anything, not even death. But, seeing the look of
regret on George's face, Nebraska smiled again and went on lightly:</p>

<p>"That's the way it is, Monk. You're good up there as long as you're
good. After that they sell you down the river. Hell, I ain't kickin'. I
been lucky. I had ten years of it already, an' that's more than most.
An' I been in three World's Serious. If I can hold on fer another year
or two--if they don't let me go or trade me--I think maybe we'll be in
again. Me an' Myrtle has figgered it all out. I had to help her people
some, an' I bought a farm fer Mama an' the Ole Man--that's where they
always wanted to be. An' I got three hundred acres of my own in
Zebulon--all paid fer, too!--an' if I git a good price this year fer my
tobacco, I Stan' to clear two thousand dollars. So if I can git two
years more in the League an' one more good World's Serious, why"--he
turned his square face towards his friend and grinned his brown and
freckled grin, just as he used to as a boy--"we'll be all set."</p>

<p>"And--you mean you'll be satisfied?"</p>

<p>"Huh? Satisfied?" Nebraska turned to him with a puzzled look. "How
do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean after all you've seen and done, Bras--the big cities and the
crowds, and all the people shouting--and the newspapers, and the
headlines, and the World's Series--and--and--the first of March, and
St. Petersburg, and meeting all the fellows again, and spring
training----"</p>

<p>Nebraska groaned.</p>

<p>"Why, what's the matter?"</p>

<p>"Spring trainin'."</p>

<p>"You mean you don't like it?"</p>

<p>"Like it! Them first three weeks is just plain hell. It ain't bad
when you're a kid. You don't put on much weight durin' the winter, an'
when you come down in the spring it only takes a few days to loosen up
an' git the kinks out. In two weeks' time you're loose as ashes. But
wait till you been aroun' as long as I have!" He laughed loudly and
shook his head. "Boy! The first time you go after a grounder you can
hear your joints creak. After a while you begin to limber up--you work
into it an' git the soreness out of your muscles. By the time the
season starts, along in April, you feel pretty good. By May you're
goin' like a house a-fire, an' you tell yourself you're good as you
ever was. You're still goin' strong along in June. An' then you hit
July, an' you git them double-headers in St. Looie! Boy, oh boy!" Again
he shook his head and laughed, baring big square teeth. "Monkus," he
said quietly, turning to his companion, and now his face was serious
and he had his black Indian look--"you ever been in St. Looie in
July?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"All right, then," he said very softly and scornfully. "An' you
ain't played <i>ball</i> there in July. You come up to bat with sweat
bustin' from your ears. You step up an' look out there to where the
pitcher ought to be, an' you see four of him. The crowd in the
bleachers is out there roastin' in their shirt-sleeves, an' when the
pitcher throws the ball it just comes from nowheres--it comes right out
of all them shirt-sleeves in the bleachers. It's on top of you before
you know it. Well, anyway, you dig in an' git a toe-hold, take your
cut, an' maybe you connect. You straighten out a fast one. It's good
fer two bases if you hustle. In the old days you could've made it
standin' up. But now--boy!" He shook his head slowly. "You cain't tell
me nothin' about that ball park in St. Looie in July! They got it all
growed out in grass in April, but after July first"--he gave a short
laugh--"hell!--it's paved with concrete! An' when you git to first,
them dogs is sayin', 'Boy, let's stay here!' But you gotta keep on
goin'--you know the manager is watchin' you--you're gonna ketch hell if
you don't take that extra base, it may mean the game. An' the boys up
in the press-box, they got their eyes glued on you, too--they've begun
to say old Crane is playin' on a dime--an' you're thinkin' about next
year an' maybe gittin' in another Serious--an' you hope to God you
don't git traded to St. Looie. So you take it on the lam, you slide
into second like the Twentieth Century comin' into the Chicago
yards--an' when you git up an' feel yourself all over to see if any of
your parts is missin', you gotta listen to one of that second baseman's
wisecracks: 'What's the hurry, Bras? Afraid you'll be late fer the
Veterans' Reunion?'"</p>

<p>"I begin to see what you mean, all right," said George.</p>

<p>"See what I mean? Why, say! One day this season I ast one of the
boys what month it was, an' when he told me it was just the middle of
July, I says to him: 'July, hell! If it ain't September I'll eat your
hat!' 'Go ahead, then,' he says, 'an' eat it, because it ain't
September, Bras--it's July.' 'Well,' I says, 'they must be havin' sixty
days a month this year--it's the longest damn July I ever felt!' An'
lemme tell you, I didn't miss it fer, either--I'll be dogged if I did!
When you git old in this business, it may be only July, but you think
it's September." He was silent for a moment. "But they'll keep you in
there, gener'ly, as long as you can hit. If you can smack that ole
apple, they'll send you out there if they've got to use glue to keep
you from fallin' apart. So maybe I'll git in another year or two if I'm
lucky. So long's I can hit 'em, maybe they'll keep sendin' me out there
till all the other players has to grunt every time ole Bras goes after
a ground ball!" He laughed. "I ain't that bad yet, but soon's I am, I'm
through."</p>

<p>"You won't mind it, then, when you have to quit?"</p>

<p>He didn't answer at once. He sat there looking out the window at the
factory-blighted landscape of New Jersey. Then he laughed a little
wearily:</p>

<p>"Boy, this may be a ride on the train to you, but to me--say!--I
covered this stretch so often that I can tell you what telephone post
we're passin' without even lookin' out the window. Why, hell yes!"--he
laughed loudly now, in the old infectious way--"I used to have 'em
numbered--now I got 'em <i>named!</i>"</p>

<p>"And you think you can get used to spending all your time out on the
farm in Zebulon?"</p>

<p>"Git used to it?" In Nebraska's voice there was now the same note of
scornful protest that it had when he was a boy, and for a moment he
turned and looked at his friend with an expression of astonished
disgust. "Why, what are you talkin' about? That's the greatest life in
the world!"</p>

<p>"And your father? How is he, Bras?"</p>

<p>The player grinned and shook his head: "Oh, the Ole Man's happy as a
possum. He's doin' what he wanted to do all his life."</p>

<p>"And is he well?"</p>

<p>"If he felt any better he'd have to go to bed. Strong as a bull,"
said Nebraska proudly. "He could wrastle a bear right now an' bite his
nose off! Why, hell yes!" the player went on with an air of
conviction--"he could take any two men I know to-day an' throw 'em over
his shoulder!"</p>

<p>"Bras, do you remember when you and I were kids and your father was
on the police force, how he used to wrestle all those professionals
that came to town? There were some good ones, too!"</p>

<p>"You're damn right there was!" said the player, nodding his head.
"Tom Anderson, who used to be South Atlantic champion, an' that fellah
Petersen--do you remember him?"</p>

<p>"Sure. They called him the Bone-Crushing Swede--he used to come
there all the time."</p>

<p>"Yeah, that's him. He used to wrastle all over the country--he was
way up there, one of the best in the business. The Ole Man wrastled him
three times, an' throwed him once, too!"</p>

<p>"And that big fellow they called the Strangler Turk----"</p>

<p>"Yeah, an' he was good, too! Only he wasn't no Turk--he only called
hisself one. The Ole Man told me he was some kind of Polack or Bohunk
from the steel mills out in Pennsylvania, an' that's how he got so
strong."</p>

<p>"And the Jersey Giant----"</p>

<p>"Yeah----"</p>

<p>"And Cyclone Finnegan----"</p>

<p>"Yeah----"</p>

<p>"And Bull Dakota--and Texas Jim Ryan--and the Masked Marvel? Do you
remember the Masked Marvel?"</p>

<p>"Yeah--only there was a whole lot of them--guys cruisin' all over
the country callin' theirselves the Masked Marvel. The Ole Man wrastled
two of 'em. Only the real Masked Marvel never came to town. The Ole Man
told me there was a real Masked Marvel, but he-was too damn good, I
guess, to come to Libya Hill."</p>

<p>"Do you remember the night, Bras, up at the old City Auditorium,
when your father was wrestling one of these Masked Marvels, and we were
there in the front row rooting for him, and he got a strangle hold on
this fellow with the mask, and the mask came off--and the fellow wasn't
the Masked Marvel at all, but only that Greek who used to work all
night at the Bijou Caf&eacute; for Ladies and Gents down by the
depot?"</p>

<p>"Yeah--haw-haw!" Nebraska threw back his head and laughed loudly.
"I'd clean fergot that damn Greek, but that's who it was! The whole
crowd hollered frame-up an' tried to git their money back--I'll swear,
Monk! I'm glad to see you!" He put his big brown hand on his
companion's knee. "It don't seem no time, does it? It all comes
back!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Bras"--for a moment George looked out at the flashing
landscape with a feeling of sadness and wonder in his heart--"it all
comes back."</p>

<p>George sat by the window and watched the stifled land stroke past
him. It was unseasonably hot for September, there had been no rain for
weeks, and all afternoon the contours of the eastern seaboard faded
away into the weary hazes of the heat. The soil was parched and dusty,
and under a glazed and burning sky coarse yellow grasses and the
withered stalks of weeds simmered and flashed beside the tracks. The
whole continent seemed to be gasping for its breath. In the hot green
depths of the train a powder of fine cinders beat in through the meshes
of the screens, and during the pauses at stations the little fans at
both ends of the car hummed monotonously, with a sound that seemed to
be the voice of the heat itself. During these intervals when the train
stood still, enormous engines steamed slowly by on adjacent tracks, or
stood panting, passive as great cats, and their engineers wiped wads of
blackened waste across their grimy faces, while the passengers fanned
feebly with sheaves of languid paper or sat in soaked and sweltering
dejection.</p>

<p>For a long time George sat alone beside his window. His eyes took in
every detail of the changing scene, but his thoughts were turned
inward, absorbed in recollections which his meeting with Nebraska Crane
had brought alive again. The great train pounded down across New
Jersey, across Pennsylvania, across the tip of Delaware, and into
Maryland. The unfolding panorama of the land was itself like a sequence
on the scroll of time. George felt lost and a little sick. His talk
with his boyhood friend had driven him back across the years. The
changes in Nebraska and his quiet acceptance of defeat had added an
undertone of sadness to the vague, uneasy sense of foreboding which he
had got from his conversation with the banker, the politician, and the
Mayor.</p>

<p>At Baltimore, when the train slowed to a stop in the gloom beneath
the station, he caught a-momentary glimpse of a face on the platform as
it slid past his window. All that he could see was a blur of thin,
white features and a sunken mouth, but at the corners of the mouth he
thought he also caught the shadow of a smile--faint, evil, ghostly--and
at sight of it a sudden and unreasoning terror seized him. Could that
be Judge Rumford Bland?</p>

<p>As the train started up again and passed through the tunnel on the
other side of the city, a blind man appeared at the rear of the car.
The other people were talking, reading, or dozing, and the blind man
came in so quietly that none of them noticed him enter. He took the
first seat at the end and sat down. When the train emerged into the
waning sunlight of this September day, George looked round and saw him
sitting there. He just sat quietly, gripping a heavy walnut
walking-stick with a frail hand, the sightless eyes fixed in vacancy,
the thin and sunken face listening with that terrible intent stillness
that only the blind know, and around the mouth hovered that faint
suggestion of a smile, which, hardly perceptible though it was, had in
it a kind of terrible vitality and the mercurial attractiveness of a
ruined angel. It was Judge Rumford Bland!</p>

<p>George had not seen him in fifteen years. At that time he was not
blind, but already his eyes were beginning to fail. George remembered
him as he was then, and remembered, too, how the sight of the man,
frequently to be seen prowling the empty streets of the night when all
other life was sleeping and the town was dead, had struck a nameless
terror into his boy's heart. Even then, before blindness had come upon
him, some nocturnal urge had made him seek deserted pavements beneath
the blank and sterile corner lights, past windows that were always
dark, past doors that were for ever locked.</p>

<p>He came from an old and distinguished family, and, like all his male
ancestors for one hundred years or more, he had been trained in the
profession of the law. For a single term he had been a police-court
magistrate, and from then on was known as "Judge" Bland. But he had
fallen grievously from the high estate his family held. During the
period of George Webber's boyhood he still professed to be a lawyer. He
had a shabby office in a disreputable old building which he owned, and
his name was on the door as an attorney, but his living was earned by
other and more devious means. Indeed, his legal skill and knowledge had
been used more for the purpose of circumventing the law and defeating
justice than in maintaining them. Practically all his "business" was
derived from the negro population of the town, and of this business the
principal item was usury.</p>

<p>On the Square, in his ramshackle two-storey building of rusty brick,
was "the store". It was a second-hand furniture store, and it occupied
the ground floor and basement of the building. It was, of course,
nothing but a blind for his illegal transactions with the negroes. A
hasty and appalled inspection of the mountainous heap of ill-smelling
junk which it contained would have been enough to convince one that if
the owner had to depend on the sale of his stock he would have to close
his doors within a month. It was incredible. In the dirty window was a
pool table, taken as brutal tribute from some negro billiard parlour.
But what a pool table! Surely it had not a fellow in all the relics in
the land. Its surface was full of lumps and dents and ridges. Not a
pocket remained without a hole in the bottom big enough to drop a
baseball through. The green cloth-covering had worn through or become
unfixed in a dozen places. The edges of the table and the cloth itself
were seared and burnt with the marks of innumerable cigarettes. Yet
this dilapidated object was by all odds the most grandiose adornment of
the whole store.</p>

<p>As one peered back into the gloom of the interior he became aware of
the most fantastic collection of nigger junk that was ever brought
together in one place. On the street floor as well as in the basement
it was piled up to the ceiling, and all jumbled together as if some
gigantic steam-shovel had opened its jaws and dumped everything just as
it was. There were broken-down rocking-chairs, bureaus with cracked
mirrors and no bottoms in the drawers, tables with one, two, or three
of their legs missing, rusty old kitchen stoves with burnt-out grates
and elbows of sooty pipe, blackened frying pans encased in the grease
of years, flat irons, chipped plates and bowls and pitchers, washtubs,
chamber-pots, and a thousand other objects, all worn out, cracked, and
broken.</p>

<p>What, then, was the purpose of this store, since it was filled with
objects of so little value that even the poorest negroes could get
slight use from them? The purpose, and the way Judge Rumford Bland used
it, was quite simple:</p>

<p>A negro in trouble, in immediate need of money to pay a police-court
fine, a doctor's bill, or some urgent debt, would come to see Judge
Bland. Sometimes he needed as little as five or ten dollars,
occasionally as much as fifty dollars, but usually it was less than
that. Judge Bland would then demand to know what security he had. The
negro, of course, had none, save perhaps a few personal possessions and
some wretched little furniture--a bed, a chair, a table, a kitchen
stove. Judge Bland would send his collector, bulldog, and chief
lieutenant--a ferret-faced man named Clyde Beals--to inspect these
miserable possessions, and if he thought the junk important enough to
its owner to justify the loan, he would advance the money, extracting
from it, however, the first instalment of his interest.</p>

<p>From this point on, the game was plainly and flagrantly usurious.
The interest was payable weekly, every Saturday night. On a ten-dollar
loan Judge Bland extracted interest of fifty cents a week; on a
twenty-dollar loan, interest of a dollar a week; and so on. That is why
the amount of the loans was rarely as much as fifty dollars. Not only
were the contents of most negro shacks less than that, but to pay two
dollars and a half in weekly interest was beyond the capacity of most
negroes, whose wage, if they were men, might not be more than five or
six dollars a week, and if they were women--cooks or house-servants in
the town--might be only three or four dollars. Enough had to be left
them for a bare existence or it was no game. The purpose and skill of
the game came in lending the negro a sum of money somewhat greater than
his weekly wage and his consequent ability to pay back, but also a sum
whose weekly interest was within the range of his small income.</p>

<p>Judge Bland had on his books the names of negroes who had paid him
fifty cents or a dollar a week over a period of years, on an original
loan of ten or twenty dollars. Many of these poor and ignorant people
were unable to comprehend what had happened to them. They could only
feel mournfully, dumbly, with the slave-like submissiveness of their
whole training and conditioning, that at some time in the distant past
they had got their money, spent it, and had their fling, and that now
they must pay perpetual tribute for that privilege. Such men and women
as these would come to that dim-lit place of filth and misery on
Saturday night, and there the Judge himself, black-frocked,
white-shirted, beneath one dingy, fly-specked bulb, would hold his
private court:</p>

<p>"What's wrong, Carrie? You're two weeks behind in your payments. Is
fifty cents all you got this week?"</p>

<p>"It doan seem lak it was three weeks. Musta slipped up somewheres in
my countin'."</p>

<p>"You didn't slip up. It's three weeks. You owe a dollar fifty. Is
this all you got?"</p>

<p>With sullen apology: "Yassuh."</p>

<p>"When will you have the rest of it?"</p>

<p>"Dey's a fellah who say he gonna give me----"</p>

<p>"Never mind about that. Are you going to keep up your payments after
this or not?"</p>

<p>"Dat's whut Ah wuz sayin'. Jus' as soon as Monday come, an' dat
fellah----"</p>

<p>Harshly: "Who you working for now?"</p>

<p>"Doctah Hollandah----"</p>

<p>"You cooking for him?"</p>

<p>Sullenly, with unfathomable negro mournfulness: "Yassuh."</p>

<p>"How much is he paying you?"</p>

<p>"Three dollahs."</p>

<p>"And you mean you can't keep up? You can't pay fifty cents a
week?"</p>

<p>Still sullen, dark, and mournful, as doubtful and confused as jungle
depths of Africa: "Doan know...Seem lak a long time since Ah started
payin' up----"</p>

<p>Harshly, cold as poison, quick as a striking snake: "You've never
started paying up. You've paid nothing. You're only paying interest,
and behind in that."</p>

<p>And still doubtfully, in black confusion, fumbling and fingering and
bringing forth at last a wad of greasy little receipts from the
battered purse: "Doan know, seem lak Ah got enough of dese to've paid
dat ten dollahs up long ago. How much longer does Ah have to keep on
payin'?"</p>

<p>"Till you've got ten dollars...All right, Carrie: here's your
receipt. You bring that extra dollar in next week."</p>

<p>Others, a little more intelligent than Carrie, would comprehend more
dearly what had happened to them, but would continue to pay because
they were unable to get together at one time enough money to release
them from their bondage. A few would have energy and power enough to
save their pennies until at last they were able to buy back their
freedom. Still others, after paying week by week and month by month,
would just give up in despair and would pay no more. Then, of course,
Clyde Beals was on them like a vulture. He nagged, he wheedled, and he
threatened; and if, finally, he saw that he could get no more money
from them, he took their household furniture. Hence the chaotic pile of
malodorous junk which filled the shop.</p>

<p>Why, it may be asked, in a practice that was so flagrantly, nakedly,
and unashamedly usurious as this, did Judge Rumford Bland not come into
collision with the law? Did the police not know from what sources, and
in what ways, his income was derived?</p>

<p>They knew perfectly. The very store in which this miserable business
was carried on was within twenty yards of the City Hall, and within
fifty feet of the side entrance to the town calaboose, up whose stone
steps many of these same negroes had time and again been hauled and
mauled and hurled into a cell. The practice, criminal though it was,
was a common one, winked at by the local authorities, and but one of
many similar practices by which unscrupulous white men all over the
South feathered their own nests at the expense of an oppressed and
ignorant people. The fact that such usury was practised chiefly against
"a bunch of niggers" to a large degree condoned and pardoned it in the
eyes of the law.</p>

<p>Moreover, Judge Rumford Bland knew that the people with whom he
dealt would not inform on him. He knew that the negro stood in awe of
the complex mystery of the law, of which he understood little or
nothing, or in terror of its brutal force. The law for him was largely
a matter of the police, and the police was a white man in a uniform,
who had the power and authority to arrest him, to beat him with his
fist or with a club, to shoot him with a gun, and to lock him up in a
small, dark cell. It was not likely, therefore, that any negro would
take his troubles to the police. He was not aware that he had any
rights as a citizen, and that Judge Rumford Bland had violated those
rights; or, if he was aware of rights, however vaguely, he was not
likely to ask for their protection by a group of men at whose hands he
had known only assault, arrest, and imprisonment.</p>

<p>Above the shambles of the nigger junk, upon the second floor, were
Judge Bland's offices. A wooden stairway, worn by the tread of
clay-booted time, and a hand-rail, loose as an old tooth, smooth,
besweated by the touch of many a black palm, led up to a dark hallway.
Here, in Stygian gloom, one heard the punctual monotone of a single and
regularly repeated small drop of water dripping somewhere in the rear,
and caught the overpowering smell of the tin urinal. Opening off of
this hall-way was the glazed glass of the office door, which bore the
legend in black paint, partly flaked off:</p>

<blockquote>RUMFORD BLAND<br>
ATTORNEY AT LAW</blockquote>

<p>Within, the front room was furnished with such lumber as lawyers
use. The floor was bare, there were two roll-top desks, black with age,
two bookcases with glass doors, filled with battered volumes of old
pigskin brown, a spittoon, brass-bodied and capacious, swimming with
tobacco juice, a couple of ancient swivel chairs, and a few other
nondescript straight-backed chairs for visitors to sit and creak in. On
the walls were several faded diplomas--Pine Rock College, Bachelor of
Arts; The University of Old Catawba, Doctor of Laws; and a certificate
of The Old Catawba Bar Association. Behind was another room with
nothing in it but some more bookcases full of heavy tomes in musty calf
bindings, a few chairs, and against the wall a plush sofa--the room, it
was whispered, "where Bland took his women". Out front, in the windows
that looked on the Square, their glass unwashed and specked with the
ghosts of flies that died when Gettysburg was young, were two old,
frayed, mottled-yellow window shades, themselves as old as Garfield,
and still faintly marked with the distinguished names of "Kennedy and
Bland". The Kennedy of that old law firm had been the father of Baxter
Kennedy, the Mayor, and his partner, old General Bland, had been
Rumford's father. Both bad been dead for years, but no one had bothered
to change the lettering.</p>

<p>Such were the premises of Judge Rumford Bland as George Webber
remembered them. Judge Rumford Bland--"bondsman", "furniture dealer",
usurious lender to the blacks. Judge Rumford Bland--son of a brigadier
of infantry, C.S.A., member of the bar, wearer of immaculate white and
broadcloth black.</p>

<p>What had happened to this man that had so corrupted and perverted
his life from its true and honourable direction? No one knew. There was
no question that he possessed remarkable gifts. In his boyhood George
had heard the more reputable attorneys of the town admit that few of
them would have been Judge Bland's match in skill and ability had he
chosen to use his talents in an honest way.</p>

<p>But he was stained with evil. There was something genuinely old and
corrupt at the sources of his life and spirit. It had got into his
blood, his bone, his flesh. It was palpable in the touch of his thin,
frail hand when he greeted you, it was present in the deadly weariness
of his tone of voice, in the dead-white texture of his emaciated face,
in his lank and lustreless auburn hair, and, most of all, in his sunken
mouth, around which there hovered constantly the ghost of a smile. It
could only be called the ghost of a smile, and yet, really, it was no
smile at all. It was, if anything, only a shadow at the corners of the
mouth. When one looked closely, it was gone. But one knew that it was
always there--lewd, evil, mocking, horribly corrupt, and suggesting a
limitless vitality akin to the humour of death, which welled up from
some secret spring in his dark soul.</p>

<p>In his early manhood Judge Bland had married a beautiful but
dissolute woman, whom he shortly divorced. The utter cynicism that
marked his attitude towards women was perhaps partly traceable to this
source. Ever since his divorce he had lived alone with his mother, a
stately, white-haired lady to whom he rendered at all times a faithful,
solicitous, exquisitely kind and gentle duty. Some people suspected
that this filial devotion was tinged with irony and contemptuous
resignation, but certainly the old lady herself had no cause to think
so. She occupied a pleasant old house, surrounded with every comfort,
and if she ever guessed by what dark means her luxuries had been
assured, she never spoke of it to her son. As for women generally,
Judge Bland divided them brutally into two groups--the mothers and the
prostitutes--and, aside from the single exception in his own home, his
sole interest was in the second division.</p>

<p>He had begun to go blind several years before George left Libya
Hill, and the thin, white face, with its shadowy smile, had been given
a sinister enhancement by the dark spectacles which he then wore. He
was under treatment at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, and
made trips there at intervals of six weeks, but his vision was growing
steadily worse, and the doctors had already told him that his condition
was practically hopeless. The malady that was destroying his sight had
been brought on by a loathsome disease which he thought had been
checked long since, and which he frankly admitted had been engendered
in his eyes.</p>

<p>In spite of all these sinister and revolting facts of character, of
spirit, and of person, Judge Bland, astonishing as it may seem, had
always been an enormously attractive figure. Everyone who met him knew
at once that the man was bad. No, "bad" is not the word for it.
Everyone knew that he was evil--genuinely, unfathomably evil--and evil
of this sort has a grandeur about it not unlike the grandeur of supreme
goodness. And indeed, there was goodness in him that had never
altogether died. In his single term upon the bench as a police-court
magistrate, it was universally agreed that Judge Bland had been fair
and wise in his disposal of swift justice. Whatever it was that had
made this fact possible--and no one pretended to understand it--the
aura of it still clung to him. And it was for just this reason that
people who met him were instantly, even if they fought against it,
captivated, drawn close to him, somehow made to like him. At the very
moment that they met him, and felt the force of death and evil working
in him, they also felt--oh, call it the phantom, the radiance, the lost
soul, of an enormous virtue. And with the recognition of that quality
came the sudden stab of overwhelming regret, the feeling of "What a
loss! What a shame!" And yet no one could say why.</p>

<p>As the early dusk of approaching autumn settled swiftly down, the
train sped southward towards Virginia. George sat by the window
watching the dark shapes of trees flash by, and thought back over all
that he had ever known about Judge Rumford Bland. The loathing and
terror and mysterious attraction which the man had always had for him
were now so great that he felt he could not sit alone there any longer.
Midway in the car the other people from Libya Hill had gathered
together in a noisy huddle. Jarvis Riggs, Mayor Kennedy, and Sol Isaacs
were sitting down or sprawling on the arms of the seats, and Parson
Flack was standing in the aisle, leaning over earnestly as he talked,
with arms outstretched on the backs of the two seats that enclosed the
group. In the centre of this huddle, the focus of all their attention,
was Nebraska Crane. They had caught him as he went by, and now they had
him cornered.</p>

<p>George rose and went over to join them, and as he did so he glanced
again in the direction of Judge Bland. He was dressed with
old-fashioned fastidiousness, just as he had always dressed, in
loose-fitting garments of plain and heavy black, a starched white
shirt, a low collar and a black string neck-tie, and a wide-brimmed
Panama hat which he had not removed. Beneath the brim of the hat his
once auburn hair was now a dead, and lifeless white. This and the
sightless eyes were the only changes in him. Otherwise he looked just
as he had looked fifteen years ago. He had not stirred since he came
in. Ha sat upright, leaning a little forward on his cane, his blindly
staring eyes fixed before him, his white and sunken face held in an
attitude of intense, listening stillness.</p>

<p>As George joined the group in the middle of the car, they were
excitedly discussing property values--all of them, that is, except
Nebraska Crane. Parson Flack would bend over earnestly, showing his big
teeth in a smile and tell about some recent deal, and what a certain
piece of land had sold for--"Right out there on Charles Street, not far
from where you used to live, Bras!" To each of these new marvels the
player's response was the same:</p>

<p>"Well I'll be dogged!" he said, astounded. "What d'you know about
that!"</p>

<p>The banker now leaned forward and tapped Nebraska confidentially on
the knee. He talked to him persuasively, in friendly wise, urging him
to invest his savings in the real estate speculations of the town. He
brought up all his heaviest artillery of logic and mathematics, drawing
forth his pencil and note-book to figure out just how much a given sum
of money could be increased if it was shrewdly invested now in this or
that piece of property, and then sold when the time was right.</p>

<p>"You can't go wrong!" said Jarvis Riggs, a little feverishly. "The
town is bound to grow. Why, Libya Hill is only at the beginning of its
development. You bring your money back home, my boy, and let it go to
work for you! You'll see!"</p>

<p>This went on for some time. But in the face of all their urgings
Nebraska remained his characteristic self. He was respectful and
good-natured, but a little dubious, and fundamentally stubborn.</p>

<p>"I already got me a farm out in Zebulon," he said, and,
grinning--"It's paid fer, too! When I git through playin' baseball, I'm
comin' back an' settle down out there an' farm it. It's three hundred
acres of the purtiest bottom land you ever seen. That's all I want. I
couldn't use no more."</p>

<p>As Nebraska talked to them in his simple, homely way, he spoke as a
man of the earth for whom the future opened up serenely, an
independent, stubborn man who knew what he wanted, a man who was firmly
rooted, established, secure against calamity and want. He was
completely detached from the fever of the times--from the fever of the
boom-mad town as well as from the larger fever of the nation. The
others talked incessantly about land, but George saw that Nebraska
Crane was the only one who still conceived of the land as a place on
which to live, and of living on the land as a way of life.</p>

<p>At last Nebraska detached himself from the group and said he was
going back to take a smoke. George started to follow him. As he passed
down the aisle behind his friend and came abreast of the last seat,
suddenly a quiet, toneless voice said:</p>

<p>"Good evening, Webber."</p>

<p>He stopped and spun round. The blind man was seated there before
him. He had almost forgotten about him. The blind man had not moved as
he spoke. He was still leaning a little forward on his cane, his thin,
white face held straight before him as if he were still listening for
something. George felt now, as he had always felt, the strange
fascination in that evil shadow of a smile that hovered about the
corners of the blind man's mouth. He paused, then said:</p>

<p>"Judge Bland."</p>

<p>"Sit down, son." And like a child under the spell of the Pied Piper,
he sat down. "Let the dead bury their dead. Come sit among the
blind."</p>

<p>The words were uttered tonelessly, yet their cruel and lifeless
contempt penetrated nakedly throughout the car. The other men stopped
talking and turned as if they had received an electric shock. George
did not know what to say; in the embarrassment of the moment he blurted
out:</p>

<p>"I--I--there are a lot of people on the train from home. I--I've
been talking to them--Mayor Kennedy, and----"</p>

<p>The blind man, never moving, in his terrible toneless voice that
carried to all ears, broke in:</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. As eminent a set of sons-of-bitches as were ever
gathered together in the narrow confines of a single pullman-car."</p>

<p>The whole car listened in an appalled silence. The group in the
middle looked at one another with fear in their eyes, and in a moment
they began 'talking feverishly again.</p>

<p>"I hear you were in France again last year," the voice now said.
"And did you find the French whores any different from the homegrown
variety?"</p>

<p>The naked words, with their toneless evil, pierced through the car
like a flash of sheer terror. All conversation stopped. Everyone was
stunned, frozen into immobility.</p>

<p>"You'll find there's not much difference," Judge Bland observed
calmly and in the same tone. "Syphilis makes the whole world kin. And
if you want to lose your eyesight, you can do it in this great
democracy as well as anywhere on earth."</p>

<p>The whole car was as quiet as death. In another moment the stunned
faces turned towards one another, and the men began to talk in furtive
whispers.</p>

<p>Through all of this the expression on that white and sunken face had
never altered, and the shadow of that ghostly smile still lingered
around the mouth. But now, low and casually, he said to the young
man:</p>

<p>"How are you, son? I'm glad to see you." And in that simple phrase,
spoken by the blind man, there was the suggestion of a devilish humour,
although his expression did not change a bit.</p>

<p>"You--you've been in Baltimore, Judge Bland?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I still come up to Hopkins now and then. It does no good, of
course. You see, son," the tone was low and friendly now, "I've gone
completely blind since I last saw you."</p>

<p>"I didn't know. But you don't mean that you----"</p>

<p>"Oh, utterly! Utterly!" replied Judge Bland, and all at once he
threw his sightless face up and laughed with sardonic glee, displaying
blackened rims of teeth, as if the joke was too good to be kept. "My
dear boy, I assure you that I am utterly blind. I can no longer
distinguish one of our most prominent local bastards two feet
off--<i>Now, Jarvis</i>!" he suddenly cried out in a chiding voice in
the direction of the unfortunate Riggs, who had loudly resumed his
discussion of property values--"you <i>know</i> that's not true! Why,
man, I can tell by the look in your eyes that you're lying!" And again
he lifted his face and was shaken by devilish, quiet laughter. "Excuse
the interruption, son," he went on. "I believe the subject of our
discourse was bastardy. Why, can you believe it?"--he leaned forward
again his long fingers playing gently on the polished ridges of his
stick--"where bastardy is concerned, I find I can no longer trust my
eyes at all. I rely exclusively on the sense of smell. And"--for the
first time his face was sunken deliberately in weariness and
disgust--"it is enough. A sense of smell is all you need." Abruptly
changing now, he said: "How are the folks?"</p>

<p>"Why--Aunt Maw's dead. I--I'm going home to the funeral."</p>

<p>"Dead, is she?"</p>

<p>That was all he said. None of the usual civilities, no expression of
polite regret, just that and nothing more. Then, after a moment:</p>

<p>"So you're going down to bury her." It was a statement, and he said
it reflectively, as though meditating upon it; then--"And do you think
you can go home again?"</p>

<p>George was a little startled and puzzled: "Why--I don't understand.
How do you mean, Judge Bland?"</p>

<p>There was another flare of that secret, evil laughter. "I mean, do
you think you can really go <i>home</i> again?" Then, sharp, cold,
peremptory--"Now answer me! Do you think you can?"</p>

<p>"Why--why yes! Why--" the young man was desperate, almost frightened
now, and, earnestly, beseechingly, he said--"why look here, Judge
Bland--I haven't done anything--honestly I haven't!"</p>

<p>Again the low, demonic laughter: "You're <i>sure</i>?"</p>

<p>Frantic now with the old terror which the man had always inspired in
him as a boy: "Why--why of course I'm sure! Look here, Judge Bland--in
the name of God, what have I done?" He thought desperately of a dozen
wild, fantastic things, feeling a sickening and overwhelming
consciousness of guilt, without knowing why. He thought: "Has he heard
about my book? Does he know I wrote about the town? Is that what he
means?"</p>

<p>The blind man cackled thinly to himself, enjoying with evil
tenderness his little cat's play with the young man: "The guilty fleeth
where no man pursueth. Is that it, son?"</p>

<p>Frankly distracted: "Why--why--I'm not guilty!" Angrily: "Why damn
it, I'm not guilty of anything!" Passionately, excitedly: "I can hold
up my head with any man! I can look the whole damn world in the eye! I
make no apologies to----"</p>

<p>He stopped short, seeing the evil ghost-shadow of a smile at the
corners of the blind man's mouth. "That disease!" he thought--"the
thing that ruined his eyes--maybe--maybe--why, yes--the man is crazy!"
Then he spoke, slowly, simply:</p>

<p>"Judge Bland." He rose from the seat. "Good-bye, Judge Bland." The
smile still played about the blind man's mouth, but he answered with a
new note of kindness in his voice:</p>

<p>"Good-bye, son." There was a barely perceptible pause. "But don't
forget I tried to warn you."</p>

<hr align="center" width="15%">
<p>George walked quickly away with thudding heart and trembling limbs.
What <i>had</i> Judge Bland meant when he asked, "Do you think you can
go home again?" And what had been the meaning of that evil, silent,
mocking laughter? What had he heard? What did he know? And these
others--did they know, too?</p>

<p>He soon learned that his fear and panic in the blind man's presence
were shared by all the people in the car. Even the passengers who had,
never seen Judge Bland before had heard his naked, brutal words, and
they were now horrified by the sight of him. As for the rest, the men
from Libya Hill, this feeling was greatly enhanced, sharpened by all
that they knew of him. He had pursued his life among them with insolent
shamelessness. Though he still masked in all the outward aspects of
respectability, he was in total disrepute, and yet he met the opinion
of the town with such cold and poisonous contempt that everyone held
him in a kind of terrified respect. As for Parson Flack, Jarvis Riggs,
and Mayor Kennedy, they were afraid of him because his blind eyes saw
straight through them. His sudden appearance in the car, where none had
expected to meet him, had aroused in all of them a sense of stark,
underlying terror.</p>

<p>As George went into the washroom suddenly, be came upon the Mayor
cleaning his false teeth in the basin. The man's plump face, which
George had always known in the guise of cheerful, hearty amiability,
was all caved in. Hearing a sound behind him, the Mayor turned upon the
newcomer. For a moment there was nothing but nameless fright in his
weak brown eyes. He mumbled frantically, incoherently, holding his
false teeth in his trembling fingers. Like a man who did not know what
he was doing, he brandished them in a grotesque yet terrible gesture
indicative of--God knows what!--but despair and terror were both in it.
Then he put the teeth into his mouth again, smiled feebly, and muttered
apologetically, with some counterfeit of his usual geniality:</p>

<p>"Ho, ho!--well, son! You caught me that time, all right! A man can't
talk without his teeth!"</p>

<p>The same thing was now apparent everywhere. George saw it in the
look of an eye, the movement of a hand, the give-away expression of a
face in repose. The merchant, Sol Isaacs, took him aside and
whispered:</p>

<p>"Have you heard what they're saying about the bank?" He looked
around quickly and checked himself, as if afraid of the furtive sound
of his own voice. "Oh, everything's O.K.! Sure it is! They just went a
little too fast there for a while! Things are rather quiet right
now--but they'll pick up!"</p>

<p>Among all of them there was the same kind of talk that George had
heard before. "It's worth all of that," they told each other eagerly.
"It'll bring twice as much in a year's time." They caught him by the
lapel in the most friendly and hearty fashion and said he ought to
settle down in Libya Hill and stay for good--"Greatest place on earth,
you know!" They made their usual assured pronouncements upon finance,
banking, market trends, and property values. But George sensed now that
down below all this was just utter, naked, frantic terror--the terror
of men who know that they are ruined and are afraid to admit it, even
to themselves.</p>

<p>It was after midnight, and the great train was rushing south across
Virginia in the moonlight. The people in the little towns lay in their
beds and heard the mournful whistle, then the sudden roar as the train
went through, and they turned over restlessly and dreamed of fair and
distant cities.</p>

<p>In K19 most of the passengers had retired to their berths. Nebraska
Crane had turned in early, but George was still up, and so, too, were
the banker, the Mayor, and the political boss. Crass, world-weary,
unimaginative fellows that they were, they were nevertheless too
excited by something of the small boy in them that had never died to go
to bed at their usual hour aboard a train, and were now drawn together
for companionship in the smoke-fogged washroom. Behind the green
curtains the complex of male voices rose and fell in talk as they told
their endless washroom stories. Quietly, furtively, with sly delight,
they began to recall unsavoury anecdotes remembered from the open and
shameless life of Judge Rumford Bland, and at the end of each recital
there would be a choking burst of strong laughter.</p>

<p>When the laughter and the slapping of thighs subsided, Parson Flack
leaned forward again, eager to tell another. In a voice that was
subdued, confidential, almost conspiratorial, he began:</p>

<p>"And do you remember the time that he----?"</p>

<p>Swiftly the curtain was drawn aside, all heads jerked up, and Judge
Bland entered.</p>

<p>"Now, Parson"--said he in a chiding voice--"remember what?" Before
the blind, cold stare of that emaciated face the seated men were
silent. Something stronger than fear was in their eyes.</p>

<p>"Remember <i>what?</i>" he said again, a trifle harshly. He stood
before them erect and fragile, both hands balanced on the head of the
cane which he held anchored to the floor in front of him. He turned to
Jarvis Riggs: "Remember when you established what you boasted was 'the
fastest-growing bank in all the state'--and weren't too particular what
it grew on?" He turned back to Parson Flack: "Remember when one of 'the
boys', as you like to call them--you always look out for 'the boys',
don't you, Parson?--remember when one of 'the boys' borrowed money from
'the fastest-growing bank' to buy two hundred acres on that hill across
the river?"--he turned to the Mayor--"and sold the land to the town for
a new cemetery?...Though why," he turned his face to Parson Flack
again, "the dead should have to go so far to bury their dead I do not
know!"</p>

<p>He paused impressively, like a country lawyer getting ready to
launch his peroration to a jury.</p>

<p>"Remember <i>what?</i>"--the voice rose suddenly, high and sharp.
"Do I remember, Parson, how you've run the town through all these
years? Do I remember what a good thing you've made of politics? You've
never aspired to public office, have you, Parson? Oh, no--you're much
too modest. But you know how to pick the public-spirited citizens who
do aspire, and whose great hearts pant with eagerness to serve their
fellow men! Ah, yes. It's a very nice little private business, isn't
it, Parson? And all 'the boys' are stockholders and get their cut of
the profits--is that the way of it, Parson?...Remember <i>what?</i>" he
cried again. "Do I remember now the broken fragments of a town that
waits and fears and schemes to put off the day of its impending ruin?
Why, Parson, yes--I can remember all these things. And yet I had no
part in them, for, after all, I am a humble man. Oh"--with a
deprecating nod--" a little nigger squeezing here and there, a little
income out of Niggertown, a few illegal lendings, a comfortable
practice in small usury--yet my wants were few, my tastes were very
simple. I was always satisfied with, say, a modest five per cent a
week. So I am not in the big money, Parson. I remember many things, but
I see now I have spent my substance, wasted all my talents in riotous
living--while pious Puritans have virtuously betrayed their town and
given their whole-souled services to the ruin of their fellow men."</p>

<p>Again there was an ominous pause, and when he went on his voice was
low, almost casual in its toneless irony:</p>

<p>"I am afraid I have been at best a giddy fellow, Parson, and that my
old age will be spent in memories of trivial things--of various merry
widows who came to town, of poker chips, racehorses, cards, and
rattling dice, of bourbon, Scotch, and rye--all the forms of
hellishness that saintly fellows, Parson, who go to prayer-meeting
every week, know nothing of. So I suppose I'll warm my old age with the
memories of my own sinfulness--and be buried at last, like all good men
and true, among more public benefactors in the town's expensive
graveyard on the hill...But I also remember other things, Parson. So
can you. And maybe in my humble sphere I, too, have served a
purpose--of being the wild oat of more worthy citizens."</p>

<p>They sat in utter silence, their frightened, guilty eyes all riveted
upon his face, and each man felt as if those cold, unseeing eyes had
looked straight through him. For a moment more Judge Bland just stood
there, and, slowly, without a change of muscle in the blankness of his
face, the ghostly smile began to hover like a shadow at the corners of
his sunken mouth.</p>

<p>"Good evening, gentlemen," he said. He turned, and with his
walking-stick he caught and held the curtain to one side. "I'll be
seeing you."</p>

<p>All through the night George lay in his dark berth and watched the
old earth of Virginia as it stroked past him in the dream-haunted
silence of the moon. Field and hill and gulch and stream and wood
again, the everlasting earth, the huge illimitable earth of America,
kept stroking past him in the steep silence of the moon.</p>

<p>All through the ghostly stillness of the land, the train made on for
ever its tremendous noise, fused of a thousand sounds, and they called
back to him forgotten memories: old songs, old faces, old memories, and
all strange, wordless, and unspoken things men know and live and feel,
and never find a language for--the legend of dark time, the sad brevity
of their days, the unknowable but haunting miracle of life itself. He
heard again, as he had heard throughout his childhood, the pounding
wheel, the tolling bell, the whistle-wail, and he remembered how these
sounds, coming to him from the river's edge in the little town of his
boyhood, had always evoked for him their tongueless prophecy of wild
and secret joy, their glorious promises of new lands, morning, and a
shining city. But now the lonely cry of the great train was speaking to
him with an equal strangeness of return. For he was going home
again.</p>

<p>The undertone of terror with which he had gone to bed, the sadness
of the foreshadowed changes in the town, the sombre prospect of the
funeral to-morrow, all combined to make him dread his homecoming, which
so many times in the years since he had been away he had looked forward
to some day with hope and exultation. It was all so different from what
he thought it would be. He was still only an obscure instructor at one
of the universities in the city, his book was not yet published, he was
not by any standard which his native town could know--"successful", "a
success". And as he thought of it, he realised that, almost more than
anything, he feared the sharp, appraising eye, the worldly judgments,
of that little town.</p>

<p>He thought of all his years away from home, the years of wandering
in many lands and cities. He remembered how many times he had thought
of home with such an intensity of passion that he could close his eyes
and see the scheme of every street, and every house upon each street,
and the faces of the people, as well as recall the countless things
that they had said and the densely-woven fabric of all their histories.
To-morrow he would see it all again, and he almost wished he had not
come. It would have been easy to plead the excuse of work and other
duty. And it was silly, anyhow, to feel as he did about the place.</p>

<p>But why had he always felt so strongly the magnetic pull of home,
why had he thought so much about it and remembered it with such blazing
accuracy, if it did not matter, and if this little town, and the
immortal hills around it, was not the only home he had on earth? He did
not know. All that he knew was that the years flow by like water, and
that one day men come home again.</p>

<p>The train rushed onward through the moonlit land.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="chapter1-06"></a>6. The Home-coming</h2>

<p>When he looked from the windows of the train next morning the hills
were there. They towered immense and magical into the blue weather, and
suddenly the coolness was there, the winy sparkle of the air, and the
shining brightness. Above him loomed huge shapes, the dense massed
green of the wilderness, the cloven cuts' and gulches of the mountain
passes, the dizzy steepness, with the sudden drops below. He could see
the little huts stuck to the edge of bank and hollow, toy-small, far
below him in the gorges. The everlasting stillness of the earth now met
the intimate, toiling slowness of the train as it climbed up round the
sinuous curves, and he had an instant sense of something refound that
he had always known--something far, near, strange, and so familiar--and
it seemed to him that he had never left the hills, and all that had
passed in the years between was like a dream.</p>

<p>At last the train came sweeping down the long sloping bend into the
station, But even before it had come to a full halt George had been
watching out of the windows and had seen Randy Shepperton and his
sister Margaret waiting for him on the platform. Randy, tall and
athletic-looking, was teetering restlessly from one foot to another as
his glance went back and forth along the windows of the train in search
of him. Margaret's strong, big-boned figure was planted solidly, her
hands clasped loosely across her waist, and her eyes were darting from
car to car with swift intensity. And as George swung down from the
steps of the pullman and, valise in hand, strode towards the platform
across the rock ballast of the roadbed and the gleaming rails, he knew
instantly, with that intuitive feeling of strangeness and recognition;
just what they would say to him at the moment of their meeting.</p>

<p>Now they had seen him. He saw Margaret speak excitedly to her
brother and motion towards his approaching figure. And now Randy was
coming on the run, his broad hand extended in a gesture of welcome, his
rich tenor shouting greetings as he came:</p>

<p>"How are you, boy?" he shouted. "Put it there!" he cried heartily as
he came up, and vigorously wrung him by the hand. "Glad to see you,
Monk!"</p>

<p>Still shouting greetings, he reached over and attempted to take the
valise. The inevitable argument, vehement, good-natured, and
protesting, began immediately, and in another moment Randy was in
triumphant possession and the two were walking together towards the
platform, Randy saying scornfully all the time in answer to the other's
protests:</p>

<p>"Oh, for God's sake, forget about it! I'll let you do as much for me
when I come up to the Big Town to visit you!...Here's Margaret!" he
said as they reached the platform. "I know she'll be glad to see
you!"</p>

<p>She was waiting for him with a broad smile on her homely face. They
had grown up together as next-door neighbours, and were almost like
brother and sister. As a matter of fact, when George had been ten and
Margaret twelve, they had had one of those idyllic romances of
childhood in which each pledged eternal devotion to the other and took
it for granted that they would marry when they grew up. But the years
had changed all that. He had gone away, and she had taken charge of
Randy when her parents died; she now kept house for him, and had never
married. As he saw her standing there with the warm smile on her face,
and with something vaguely spinsterish in her look in spite of her
large, full-breasted figure and her general air of hearty good nature,
he felt a sudden stirring of pity and old affection for her.</p>

<p>"Hello, Margaret!" he said, somewhat thickly and excitedly. "How are
you, Margaret?"</p>

<p>They shook hands, and he planted a clumsy kiss on her face. Then,
blushing with pleasure, she stepped back a pace and regarded him with
the half bantering expression she had used so often as a child.</p>

<p>"Well, well, well!" she said. "You haven't changed much, George! A
little stouter, maybe, but I reckon I'd have known you!"</p>

<p>They spoke now quietly about Aunt Maw and about the funeral, saying
the strained and awkward things that people always say when they talk
of death. Then, this duty done, there was a little pause before they
resumed their natural selves once more.</p>

<p>The two men looked at each other and grinned. When they had been
boys together Randy had seemed to George more like Mercutio than
anybody he had ever known. He had had a small, lean head, well shaped,
set closely with blond hair; he had been quick as a flash, light, wiry,
active, with a wonderful natural grace in everything he did; his mind
and spirit had been cleat, exuberant, incisive, tempered like a fine
Toledo blade. In college, too, he had been the same: he had not only
done well in his classes, but had distinguished himself as a swimmer
and as quarter-back on the football team.</p>

<p>But now something caught in George's throat as he looked at him and
saw what time had done. Randy's lean, thin face was deeply furrowed,
and the years had left a grey deposit at his temples. His hair was
thinning back on both sides of the forehead, and there were little
webbings of fine wrinkles at the corners of the eyes. It saddened
George and somehow made him feel a bit ashamed to see how old and worn
he looked. But the thing he noticed most was the expression in Randy's
eyes. Where they had once been clear and had looked out on the world
with a sharp and level gaze, they were now troubled, and haunted by
some deep preoccupation which he could not quite shake off even in the
manifest joy he felt at seeing his old friend again.</p>

<p>While they stood there, Jarvis Riggs, Parson Flack, and the Mayor
came slowly down the platform talking earnestly to one of the leading
real estate operators of the town, who had come down to meet them.
Randy saw them and, still grinning, he winked at George and prodded him
in the ribs.</p>

<p>"Oh, you'll get it now!" he cried in his old extravagant way. "At
all hours, from daybreak to three o'clock in the morning--no holds
barred! They'll be waiting for you when you get there!" he
chortled.</p>

<p>"Who?" said George.</p>

<p>"Haw-w!" Randy laughed. "Why, I'll bet they're all lined up there on
the front porch right now, in a reception committee to greet you and to
cut your throat, every damned mountain grill of a real estate man in
town! Old Horse-face Barnes, Skin-'em-alive Mack Judson, Skunk-eye Tim
Wagner, The Demon. Promoter, and Old Squeeze-your-heart's-blood Simms,
The Widder and Orphan Man from Arkansas--they're all there!" he said
gloatingly. "She told them you're a prospect, and they're waiting for
you! It's your turn now!" he yelled. "She told them that you're on the
way, and they're drawing lots right now to see which one gets your
shirt and which one takes the pants and B.V.D.s! Haw-w!"--and he poked
his friend in the ribs again.</p>

<p>"They'll get nothing out of me," George said, laughing, "for I
haven't got it to begin with.</p>

<p>"That doesn't matter!" Randy yelled. "If you've got an extra collar
button, they'll take that as the first instalment, and then--haw-w!
they'll collect your cuff-links, socks, and your suspenders in easy
payments as the years roll on!"</p>

<p>He stood there laughing at the astounded look on his friend's face.
Then, seeing his sister's reproving eye, he suddenly prodded her in the
ribs, at which she shrieked in a vexed manner and slapped at his
hand.</p>

<p>"I'll vow, Randy!" she cried fretfully. "What on earth's the matter
with you? Why, you act like a regular idiot! I'll vow you do!"</p>

<p>"Haw-w!" he yelled again. Then, more soberly, but still grinning: "I
guess we'll have to sleep you out over the garage, Monk, old boy. Dave
Merrit's in town, and he's got the spare room." There was a slight note
of deference in his voice as he mentioned Merrit's name, but he went on
lightly: "Or if you like--haw-w!--there's a nice room at Mrs. Charles
Montgomery Hopper's, and she'd be glad to have you!"</p>

<p>George looked rather uncomfortable at the mention of Mrs. Charles
Montgomery Hopper. She was a worthy lady and he remembered her well,
but he didn't want to stay at her boarding-house. Margaret saw his
expression and laughed:</p>

<p>"Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! You see what you're in for, don't you? The
prodigal comes home and we give him his choice of Mrs. Hopper or the
garage! Now is that life or not?"</p>

<p>"I don't mind a bit," protested George. "I think the garage is
swell. And besides"--they all grinned at each other again with the
affection of people who know each other so well that they are long past
knowledge--"if I get to helling around at night, I won't feel that I'm
disturbing you when I come in...But who is Mr. Merrit, anyway?"</p>

<p>"Why," Randy answered, and now he had an air of measuring his words
with thoughtful deliberation, "he--he's the Company's man--my boss, you
know. He travels around to all the branches to check up and see that
everything's O.K. He's a fine fellow. You'll like him," said Randy
seriously. "We've told him all about you and he wants to meet you."</p>

<p>"And we knew you wouldn't mind," Margaret said. "You know, it's
business, he's with the Company, and of course it's good policy to be
as nice to him as we can." But then, because such designing was really
alien to her hospitable and whole-hearted spirit, she added: "Mr.
Merrit is all right. I like him. We're glad to have him, anyway."</p>

<p>"Dave's a fine fellow," Randy repeated. "And I know he wants to see
you...Well," he said, and the preoccupied look was in his eyes again,
"if we're all ready, let's get going. I'm due back at the office now.
Merrit's there, of course. Suppose I run you out to the house and drop
you, then I'll see you later."</p>

<p>This was agreed upon. Randy grinned once more--a little nervously,
George thought--and picked up the valise and started rapidly across the
station platform towards his car, which was parked at the kerb.</p>

<p>At the funeral that afternoon the little frame house which old
Lafayette Joyner--Aunt Maw's father, and George Webber's
grandfather--had built with his own hands years ago looked just as it
had always looked when George had lived there as a boy. Nothing about
it had been changed. Yet it seemed smaller, meaner, more shabby than he
remembered it. It was set some distance back from the street, between
the Shepperton house on one side and the big brick house in which his
Uncle Mark Joyner lived on the other. The street was lined with cars,
many of them old and decrepit and covered with the red clay of the
hills. In the yard in front of the house many men stood solemnly
knotted in little groups, talking quietly, their bare heads and stiff
Sunday clothes of austere black giving them an air of self-conscious
shyness and restraint.</p>

<p>Inside, the little rooms were jammed with people, and the hush of
death was on the gathering, broken now and then by muffled coughs and
by stifled sobs and sniffles. Many of them were Joyners, who for three
days had been coming in from the hills--old men and women with the
marks of toil and pain upon their faces, cousins, in-laws, distant
relatives of Aunt Maw. George had never seen some of them before, but
they all bore the seal of the Joyner clan upon them, the look of
haunting sorrow and something about the thin line of the lips that
proclaimed their grim triumph in the presence of death.</p>

<p>In the tiny front room, where on wintry nights Aunt Maw had always
sat by the light of a kerosene lamp before a flickering fire, telling
the boy her endless stories of death and sorrow, she now lay in her
black coffin, the top and front of which were open to display as much
of her as possible to the general view. And instantly, as George
entered, he knew that one of her main obsessions in life had been
victorious over death. A spinster and a virgin all her years, she had
always had a horrible fear that, somehow, some day, some man would see
her body. As she grew older her thoughts had been more and more
preoccupied with death, and with her morbid shame lest someone see her
in the state of nature after she was dead. For this reason she had a
horror of undertakers, and had made her brother, Mark, and his wife,
Mag, solemnly promise that no man would see her unclothed corpse, that
her laying out would be done by women, and, above all else, that she
was not to be embalmed. By now she had been dead three days--three days
of long hot sun and sultriness--and it seemed to George a grim but
fitting ending that the last memory he would have of that little house,
which in his childhood had been so filled with the stench of
death-in-life, should now be the stench of death itself.</p>

<p>Mark Joyner shook hands cordially with his nephew and said he was
glad he had been able to come down. His manner was simple, dignified,
and reserved, eloquently expressive of quiet grief, for he had always
been genuinely fond of his older sister. But Mag, his wife, who for
fifty years had carried on a nagging, internecine warfare with Aunt
Maw, had appointed herself chief mourner and was obviously enjoying the
role. During the interminable service, when the Baptist minister in his
twanging, nasal voice recited his long eulogy and went back over the
events of Aunt Maw's life, Mag would break forth now and then in fits
of loud weeping and would ostentatiously throw back her heavy black
veil and swab vigorously with her handkerchief at her red and swollen
eyes.</p>

<p>The minister, with the unconscious callousness of
self-righteousness, rehearsed again the story of the family scandal. He
told how George Webber's father had abandoned his wife, Amelia Joyner,
to live in open shame with another woman, and how Amelia had shortly,
afterwards "died of a broken heart". He told how "Brother Mark Joyner
and his God-fearing wife, Sister Maggie Joyner," had been filled with
righteous wrath and had gone to court and wrested the motherless boy
from the sinful keeping of his father; and how "this good woman who now
lies dead before us" had taken charge of her sister's son and brought
him up in a Christian home. And he said be was glad to see that the
young man who had been the recipient of this dutiful charity had come
home again to pay his last debt of gratitude at the bier of the one to
whom he owed so much.</p>

<p>Throughout all this Mag continued to choke and sputter with
histrionic sorrow, and George sat there biting his lips, his eyes fixed
on the floor, perspiration streaming from him, his jaws clenched hard,
his face purple with shame and anger and nausea.</p>

<p>The afternoon wore on, and at last the service was over. People
began to issue from the house, and the procession formed for the long,
slow ride to the cemetery. With immense relief George escaped from the
immediate family group and went over to Margaret Shepperton, and the
two of them took possession of one of the limousines that had been
hired for the occasion.</p>

<p>Just as the car was about to drive off and take its place in the
line, a woman opened the door and got in with them. She was Mrs. Delia
Flood, an old friend of Aunt Maw's. George had known her all his
life.</p>

<p>"Why, hello there, young man," she said to George as she climbed in
and sat down beside him "This would've been a proud day for your Aunt
Maw if she could've known you'd come all the way back home to be here
at her funeral. She thought the world of you, boy." She nodded
absent-mindedly to Margaret. "I saw you had an empty place here, so I
said, 'It's a pity to let it go to waste. Hop right in,' I said. 'Don't
stand on ceremony. It might as well be you,' I said, 'as the next
fellow.'"</p>

<p>Mrs. Delia Flood was a childless widow well past middle age, short,
sturdy, and physically stolid, with jet black hair and small, piercing
brown eyes, and a tongue that was never still. She would fasten upon
anyone she could catch and corner, and would talk on and on in a steady
monotone that had neither beginning nor end. She was a woman of
property, and her favourite topic of conversation was real estate. In
fact, long before the present era of speculation and sky-rocketing
prices, she had had a mania for buying and selling land, and was a
shrewd judge of values. With some sixth sense she had always known what
direction the development of the growing town was likely to take, and
when things happened as she predicted, it was usually found that she
had bought up choice sites which she was able to sell for much more
than she had paid for them. She lived simply and frugally, but she was
generally believed to be well off.</p>

<p>For a little while Mrs. Flood sat in contemplative silence. But as
the procession moved off and slowly made its way through the streets of
the town, she began to glance sharply out of the windows on both sides,
and before long, without any preliminary, she launched forth in a
commentary on the history of every piece of property they passed. It
was constant, panoramic, and exhaustive. She talked incessantly,
gesturing briefly and casually with her hand, only pausing from time to
time to nod deliberately to herself in a movement of strong
affirmation.</p>

<p>"You see, don't you?" she said, nodding to herself with conviction,
tranquilly indifferent whether they listened or not so long as the
puppets of an audience were before her. "You see what they're goin' to
do here, don't you? Why, Fred Barnes, Roy Simms, and Mack Judson--all
that crowd--why, yes--here!--say!"--she cried, frowning
meditatively--"wasn't I reading it? Didn't it all come out in the
paper--why, here, you know, a week or two ago--how they proposed to
tear down that whole block of buildings there and were goin' to put up
the finest garage in this part of the country? Oh, it will take up the
whole block, you know, with a fine eight-storey building over it, and
storage space upstairs for more cars, and doctors' offices--why,
yes!--they're even thinkin' of puttin' in a roof garden and a big
restaurant on top. The whole thing will cost 'em over half a million
dollars before they're done with it--oh, paid two thousand dollars a
foot for every inch of it!" she cried. "But pshaw! Why those are Main
Street prices--you can get business property up in the centre of town
for <i>that!</i> I could've told 'em--but hm!"--with a scornful little
tremor of the head--"they didn't want it anywhere but here--no, sir!
They'll be lucky if they get out with their skins!"</p>

<p>George and Margaret offered no comment, but Mrs. Flood appeared not
to notice, and as the procession crossed the bridge and turned into
Preston Avenue she went on:</p>

<p>"See that house and lot over there! I paid twenty-five thousand for
it two years ago, and now it's worth fifty thousand if it's worth a
penny. Yes, and I'll get it, too. But pshaw! See here!"--she shook her
head emphatically. "They couldn't pull a trick like that on <i>me!</i>
I saw what he was up to! Yes! Didn't Mack Judson come to me? Didn't he
try to trade with me? Oh, here along, you know, the first part of last
April," she said impatiently, with a dismissing gesture of her hand, as
if all this must be perfectly clear to everyone. "All that crowd that's
in with him--they were behind him--I could see it plain as day. Says:
'I'll tell you what I'll do. We know you're a good trader, we respect
your judgment, and we want you in,' he says, 'and just to have you with
us, why, I'll trade you three fine lots I own up there on Pinecrest
Road in Ridgewood for that house and lot of yours on Preston Avenue.'
Says: 'You won't have to put up a cent. Just to get you in with us I'll
make you an even swap!' 'Well,' I said, 'that's mighty fine of you,
Mack, and I appreciate the compliment. If you want that house and lot
on Preston Avenue,' I said, 'why, I reckon I can let you have it. You
know my price,' I said. 'It's fifty thousand. What are those lots in
Ridgewood worth?'--came right out and asked him, you know. 'Why,' he
says, 'it's hard to say. I don't know just exactly what they are
worth,' he says. 'The property up there is goin' up all the time.' I
looked him straight in the eye and said to him: 'Well, Mack, I know
what those lots <i>are</i> worth, and they're not worth what you paid
for 'em. The town's movin' the other way. So if you want my house and
lot,' I said, 'just bring me the cash and you can have it. But I won't
swap with you.' That's exactly what I told him, and of course that was
the end of it. He's never mentioned it again. Oh, yes, I saw what he
was up to, all right."</p>

<p>Nearing the cemetery, the line of cars passed a place where an
unpaved clay road went upwards among fields towards some lonely pines.
The dirt road, at the point where it joined the main highway, was
flanked by two portalled shapes of hewn granite blocks set there like
markers of a splendid city yet unbuilt which would rise grandly from
the hills that swept back into the green wilderness from the river. But
now this ornate entrance and a large billboard planted in the field
were the only evidences of what was yet to be. Mrs. Flood saw the
sign.</p>

<p>"Hah? What's that?" she cried out in a sharply startled tone. "What
does it say there?"</p>

<p>They all craned their necks to see it as they passed, and George
read aloud the legend on the sign:</p>

<blockquote>RIVERCREST<br>
DEDICATED TO ALL THE PEOPLE<br>
OF THIS SECTION AND TO THE GLORY<br>
OF THE GREATER CITY THEY WILL BUILD</blockquote>

<p>Mrs. Flood took in the words with obvious satisfaction. "Ah-hah!"
she said, nodding her head slowly, with deliberate agreement. "That's
just exactly it!"</p>

<p>Margaret nudged George and whispered in his ear:</p>

<p>"Dedicated!" she muttered scornfully--then, with mincing refinement:
"Now ain't that nice? Dedicated to cutting your throat and bleeding you
white of every nickel that you've got!"</p>

<p>They were now entering the cemetery, and the procession wound slowly
in along a circling road and at length came to a halt near the rounded
crest of the hill below the Joyner burial plot. At one corner of the
plot a tall locust tree was growing, and beneath its shade all the
Joyners had been buried. There was the family monument--a square,
massive chunk of grey, metallic granite, brilliantly burnished, with
"JOYNER" in raised letters upon its shining surface. On the ends were
inscriptions for old Lafayette and his wife, with their names and
dates; and, grouped about them, in parallel rows set on the gentle
slope, were the graves of Lafayette's children. All these had smaller
individual monuments, and on each of these, below the name and dates of
birth and death, was some little elegiac poem carved in a Bowing
script.</p>

<p>At one side of the burial plot the new-dug grave gaped darkly in the
raw earth, and beside it was a mound of loose yellow clay. Ranged above
it on the hill were several rows of folding chairs. Towards these the
people, who were now getting out of the cars, began to move.</p>

<p>Mark and Mag and various other Joyners took the front rows, and
George and Margaret, with Mrs. Flood still close beside them, found
chairs at the back. Other people--friends, distant relatives, and mere
acquaintances--stood in groups behind.</p>

<p>The lot looked out across a mile or two of deep, dense green, the
wooded slopes and hollows that receded towards the winding river, and
straight across beyond the river was the central business part of town.
The spires and buildings, the old ones as well as some splendid new
ones--hotels, office buildings, garages, churches, and the scaffolding
and concrete of new construction which exploded from the familiar
design with glittering violence--were plainly visible. It was a fine
view.</p>

<p>While the people took their places and waited for the pallbearers to
perform their last slow and heavy service up the final ascent of the
hill, Mrs. Flood sat with her hands folded in her lap and gazed out
over the town. Then she began shaking her head thoughtfully, her lips
pursed in deprecation and regret, and in a low voice, as if she were
talking to herself, she said:</p>

<p>"Hm! Hm! Hm! Too bad, too bad, too bad!"</p>

<p>"What's that, Mrs. Flood?" Margaret leaned over and whispered.
"What's too bad?"</p>

<p>"Why, that they should ever have chosen such a place as this for the
cemetery," she said regretfully. She had lowered her voice to a stage
whisper, and those round her could hear everything she said. "Why, as I
told Frank Candler just the other day, they've gone and deliberately
given away the two best building sites in town to the niggers and the
dead people! That's just exactly what they've done! I've always said as
much--that the two finest building sites in town for natural beauty are
Niggertown and Highview Cemetery. I could've told 'em that long years
ago--they should've known it themselves if any of 'em could have seen
an inch beyond his nose--that some day the town would grow up and this
would be valuable property! Why, why on earth! When they were lookin'
for a cemetery site--why on earth didn't they think of findin' one up
there on Buxton Hill, say, where you get a beautiful view, and where
land is not so valuable? But this!" she whispered loudly. "This, by
rights, is building property! People could have fine homes here! And as
for the niggers, I've always said that they'd have been better off if
they'd been put down there on those old flats in the depot section. Now
it's too late, of course--nothin' can be done--but it was certainly a
serious mistake!" she whispered, and shook her head. "I've always known
it!"</p>

<p>"Well, I guess you're right," Margaret whispered in reply. "I never
thought of it before, but I guess you're right." And she nudged George
with her elbow.</p>

<p>The pallbearers had set the coffin in its place, and the minister
now began to read the brief and movingly solemn commitment service.
Slowly the coffin was lowered in its grave. And as the black lid
disappeared from sight George felt such a stab of wordless pain and
grief as he had never known. But he knew even as he felt it that it
wasn't sorrow for Aunt Maw. It was an aching pity for himself and for
all men living, and in it was the knowledge of the briefness of man's
days, and the smallness of his life, and the certain dark that comes
too swiftly and that has no end. And he felt, too, more personally, now
with Aunt Maw gone and no one left in all his family who was close to
him, that one whole cycle of time had closed for him. He thought of the
future opening blankly up before him, and for a moment he had an acute
sense of terror and despair like that of a lost child, for he felt now
that the last tie that had bound him to, his native earth was severed,
and he saw himself as a creature homeless, uprooted, and alone, with no
door to enter, no place to call his own, in all the vast desolation of
the planet.</p>

<p>The people had now begun to move away and to walk back slowly
towards their cars. The Joyners, however, kept their seats until the
last spadeful of earth was heaped and patted into place. Then they
arose, their duty done. Some of them just stood there now, talking
quietly in their drawling voices, while others sauntered among the
tombstones, bending over to read the inscriptions and straightening up
to recall and tell each other some forgotten incident in the life of
some forgotten Joyner. At last they, too, began to drift away.</p>

<p>George did not want to go back with them and be forced to hear the
shreds of Aunt Maw's life torn apart and pieced together again, so he
linked his arm through Margaret's and led her over the brow of the hill
to the other side. For a little while they stood in the slanting light,
silent, their faces to the west, and watched the great ball of the sun
sink down behind the rim of distant mountains. And the majestic beauty
of the spectacle, together with the woman's quiet presence there beside
him, brought calm and peace to the young man's troubled spirit.</p>

<p>When they came back, the cemetery appeared to be deserted. But as
they approached the Joyner plot they saw that Mrs. Delia Flood was
still waiting for them. They had forgotten her, and realised now that
she could not go without them, for there was only one car on the
gravelled roadway below and the hired chauffeur was slumped behind his
wheel, asleep. In the fast-failing light Mrs. Flood was wandering among
the graves, stopping now and then to stoop and peer closely at an
inscription on a stone. Then she would stand there meditatively and
look out across the town, where the first lights were already beginning
to wink on. She turned to them casually when they came up, as though
she had taken no notice of their absence, and spoke to them in her
curious fragmentary way, plucking the words right out of the middle of
her thoughts.</p>

<p>"Why, to think," she said reflectively, "that he would go and move
her! To think that any man could be so hard-hearted! Oh!" she shuddered
with a brief convulsive pucker of revulsion. "It makes my blood run
cold to think of it--and everybody told him so!--they told him so at
the time--to think he would have no more mercy in him than to go and
move her from the place where she lay buried!"</p>

<p>"Who was that, Mrs. Flood?" George said absently. "Move who?"</p>

<p>"Why, Amelia, of course--your <i>mother</i>, child!" she said
impatiently, and gestured briefly towards the weather-rusted stone.</p>

<p>He bent forward and read again the familiar inscription:</p>

<blockquote>Amelia Webber, n&eacute;e Joyner</blockquote>

<p>and below her dates the carved verse:</p>

<blockquote>Still is the voice we knew so well,<br>
Vanished the face we love,<br>
Flown her spirit pure to dwell<br>
With angels up above.<br>
Ours is the sorrow, ours the pain,<br>
And ours the joy alone<br>
To clasp her in our arms again<br>
In Heaven, by God's throne.</blockquote>

<p>"That's the thing that started all this movin'!" Mrs. Flood was
saying. "Nobody'd ever have thought of comin' here if it hadn't been
for Amelia! And here," she cried fretfully, "the woman had been dead
and in her grave more than a year when he gets this notion in his head
he's got to move her--and you couldn't reason with him! Why, your
uncle, Mark Joyner--that's who it was! You couldn't argue with him!"
she cried with vehement surprise. "Why, yes, of course! It was back
there at the time they were havin' all that trouble with your father,
child. He'd left Amelia and gone to live with that other woman--but I
<i>will</i> say this for him!" and she nodded her head with
determination. "When Amelia died, John Webber did the decent thing and
buried her himself--claimed her as his wife and buried her! He'd bought
a plot in the old cemetery, and that's where he put her. But then, more
than a year afterwards--<i>you</i> know, child--when Mark Joyner had
that trouble with your father about who was to bring you up--yes, and
took it to the courts and won!--why, that's when it was that Mark took
it in his head to move Amelia. Said he wouldn't let a sister of his lie
in Webber earth! He already had this plot, of course, way over here on
this hill where nobody'd ever thought of goin'. It was just a little
private buryin' ground, then--a few families used it, that was
all."</p>

<p>She paused and looked out thoughtfully over the town, then after a
moment she went on:</p>

<p>"Your Aunt Maw, she tried to talk to Mark about it, but it was like
talkin' to a stone wall. She told me all about it at the time. But no,
sir!" she shook her head with a movement of strong decision. "He'd made
up his mind and he wouldn't budge from it an inch! 'But see here,
Mark,' she said. 'The thing's not right! Amelia ought to stay where
she's buried!' She didn't like the looks of it, you know. 'Even the
dead have got their rights,' she said. 'Where the tree falls, there let
it lie!'--that's what she told him. But no! He wouldn't listen--you
couldn't talk to him. He says: 'I'll move her if it's the last thing I
ever live to do! I'll move her if I have to dig her up myself and carry
the coffin on my back all the way to the top of that hill across the
river! That's where she's goin',' he says, 'and you needn't argue any
more!' Well, your Aunt Maw saw then that he had his mind made up and
that it wouldn't do any good to talk to him about it. But oh! an awful
mistake! an <i>awful</i> mistake!" she muttered, shaking her head
slowly. "All that movin' and expense for nothin'! If he felt that way,
he should've brought her over here in the first place, when she died!
But I guess it was the lawsuit and all the bad blood it stirred up that
made him feel that way," she now said tranquilly..."And that's the
reason all these other people are buried here"--she made a sweeping
gesture with her arm--"that's what started it, all right! Why, of
course! When the old cemetery got filled up and they had to look round
for a new site--why, one of those fellows in Parson Flack's gang at
City Hall, he remembered the rumpus about Amelia and thought of all
these empty acres way out here beside the old buryin' ground. He found
he could buy 'em cheap, and that's what he did. That's exactly how it
was," she said. "But I've always regretted it. I was against it from
the start."</p>

<p>She fell silent again, and stood looking with solemn-eyed memory at
the weather-rusted stone.</p>

<p>"Well, as I say, then," she went on calmly, "when your Aunt Maw saw
he had his mind made up and that there was no use to try to change
him--well, she went out to the old cemetery the day they moved her, and
she asked me to go with her, you know. Oh, it was one of those raw,
windy days you get in March! The very kind of day Amelia died on. And
old Mrs. Wrenn and Amy Williamson--they had both been good friends of
Amelia's--of course they went along, too. And, of course, when we got
there, they were curious--they wanted to have a look, you know," she
said calmly, mentioning this grisly desire with no surprise whatever.
"And they tried to get me to look at it, too. Your Aunt Maw got so sick
that Mark had to take her home in the carriage, but I stood my ground.
'No,' I said, 'you go on and satisfy your curiosity if that's what you
want to do, but I won't look at it!' I said, 'I'd rather remember her
the way she was.' Well, sir, they went ahead and did it then. They got
old Prove--you know, he was that old nigger man that worked for
Mark--they got him to open up the coffin, and I turned my back and
walked away a little piece until they got through lookin'," she said
tranquilly. "And pretty soon I heard 'em comin'. Well, I turned round
and looked at 'em, and let me tell you somethin'," she said gravely,
"their faces were a study! Oh, they turned pale and they trembled!
'Well, are you satisfied?' I said. 'Did you find what you were lookin'
for?' 'Oh-h! says old Mrs. Wrenn, pale as a ghost, shakin' and wringin'
her hands, you know. 'Oh, Delia!' she says, 'it was awful! I'm sorry
that I looked!' she says. 'Ah-ha!' I said. 'What did I tell you? You
see, don't you?' And she says: 'Oh-h, it was all gone!--all gone!--all
rotted away to nothin' so you couldn't recognise her! The face was all
gone until you could see the teeth! And the nails had all grown out
long! But Delia!' she says, 'the hair!--the hair! Oh, I tell you what;'
she says, 'the hair was beautiful! It had grown out until it covered
everything--the finest head of hair I ever saw on anyone! But the rest
of it--oh, I'm sorry that I looked!' she says. 'Well, I thought so! I
thought so!' I said. 'I knew you'd be sorry, so I wouldn't look!'...But
that's the way it was, all right," she concluded with the quiet
satisfaction of omniscience.</p>

<p>Through this recital George and Margaret had stood transfixed, a
look of horror on their faces, but Mrs. Flood did not notice them. She
stood now looking down at Amelia's tombstone, her lips puckered
thoughtfully, and after a little while she said:</p>

<p>"I don't know <i>when</i> I've thought of Amelia and John
Webber--both of 'em dead and in their graves through all these years.
She lies here, and he's all alone in his own lot over there on the
other side of town, and that old trouble that they had seems very far
away. You know," she said, looking up and speaking with a tone of deep
conviction, "I believe that they have joined each other and are
reconciled and happy. I believe I'll meet them some day in a Higher
Sphere, along with all my other friends--all happy, and all leading a
new life."</p>

<p>She was silent for a moment, and then, with a movement of strong
decision, she turned away and looked out towards the town, where the
lights were now burning hard and bright and steady in the dusk.</p>

<p>"Come, now!" she cried briskly and cheerfully. "It's time we were
goin' home! It's gettin' dark!"</p>

<p>The three of them walked in silence down the slope towards the
waiting car. As they came up to it and were about to get in, Mrs. Flood
stopped and laid her hand on George's shoulder in a warm and easy
gesture.</p>

<p>"Young man," she said, "I've been a long time livin' on this earth,
and as the fellow says, the world do move! You've got your life ahead
of you, and lots to learn and many things to do--but let me tell you
somethin', boy!" and all at once she looked at him in a straight and
deadly fashion. "Go out and see the world and get your fill of
wanderin'," she cried, "and then come back and tell me if you've found
a better place than home! I've seen great changes in my time, and I'll
see more before I die. There are great things yet in store for
us--great progress, great inventions--it will all come true. Perhaps
I'll not live to see it, but you will! We've got a fine town here, and
fine people to make it go--and we're not done yet. I've seen it all
grow up out of a country village--and some day we will have a great
city here."</p>

<p>She waited an instant as if she expected him to answer and
corroborate her judgment, and when he merely nodded to show that he had
heard her, she took it for agreement and went on:</p>

<p>"Your Aunt Maw always hoped that you'd come home again. And you
<i>will!</i>" she said. "There's no better or more beautiful place on
earth than in these mountains--and some day you'll come home again to
stay."</p>

<h2><a name="chapter1-07"></a>7. Boom Town</h2>

<p>During the week that followed Aunt Maw's funeral George renewed his
acquaintance with his home town, and it was a disconcerting experience.
The sleepy little mountain village in which he had grown up--for it had
been hardly more than that then--was now changed almost beyond
recognition. The very streets that he had known so well, and had
remembered through the years in their familiar aspect of
early-afternoon emptiness and drowsy lethargy, were now foaming with
life, crowded with expensive traffic, filled with new faces he had
never seen before. Occasionally he saw somebody that he knew, and in
the strangeness of it all they seemed to him like lights shining in the
darkness of a lonely coast.</p>

<p>But what he noticed chiefly--and once he observed it he began
watching for it, and it was always there--was the look on the people's
faces. It puzzled him, and frightened him, and when he tried to find a
word to describe it, the only thing he could think of was--madness. The
nervous, excited glitter in the eyes seemed to belong to nothing else
but madness. The faces of natives and strangers alike appeared to be
animated by some secret and unholy glee. And their bodies, as they
darted, dodged, and thrust their way along, seemed to have a kind of
leaping energy as if some powerful drug was driving them on. They gave
him the impression of an entire population that was drunk--drunk with
an intoxication which never made them weary, dead, or sodden, and which
never wore of, but which incited them constantly to new efforts of
leaping and thrusting exuberance.</p>

<p>The people he had known all his life cried out to him along the
streets, seizing his hand and shaking it, and saying: "Hi, there, boy!
Glad to see you home again! Going to be with us for a while now? Good!
I'll be seeing you! I've got to go on now--got to meet a fellow down
the street to sign some papers! Good to see you, boy!" Then, having
uttered this tempestuous greeting without a pause and without the loss
of a stride, pulling and dragging him along with them 'as they wrung
his hand, they vanished.</p>

<p>On all sides he heard talk, talk, talk--terrific and incessant. And
the tumult of voices was united in variations of a single
chorus--speculation and real estate. People were gathered in earnestly
chattering groups before the drug-stores, before the post office,
before the Court House and the City Hall. They hurried along the
pavements talking together with passionate absorption, bestowing
half-abstracted nods of greeting from time to time on passing
acquaintances.</p>

<p>The real estate men were everywhere. Their motors and buses roared
through the streets of the town and out into the country, carrying
crowds of prospective clients. One could see them on the porches of
houses unfolding blueprints and prospectuses as they shouted
enticements and promises of sudden wealth into the ears of deaf old
women. Everyone was fair game for them--the lame, the halt, and the
blind, Civil War veterans or their decrepit pensioned widows, as well
as high school boys and girls, negro truck drivers, soda jerkers,
elevator boys, and bootblacks.</p>

<p>Everyone bought real estate; and everyone was "a real estate man"
either in name or practice. The barbers, the lawyers, the grocers, the
butchers, the builders, the clothiers--all were engaged now in this
single interest and obsession. And there seemed to be only one rule,
universal and infallible--to buy, always to buy, to pay whatever price
was asked, and to sell again within two days at any price one chose to
fix. It was fantastic. Along all the streets in town the ownership of
the land was constantly changing; and when the supply of streets was
exhausted, new streets were feverishly created in the surrounding
wilderness; and even before these streets were paved or a house had
been built upon them, the land was being sold, and then resold, by the
acre, by the lot, by the foot, for hundreds of thousands of
dollars.</p>

<p>A spirit of drunken waste and wild destructiveness was everywhere
apparent. The fairest places in the town were being mutilated at untold
cost. In the centre of town there had been a beautiful green opulent
with rich lawns and lordly trees, with beds of flowers and banks of
honeysuckle, and on top of it there had been an immense, rambling, old
wooden hotel. From its windows one could look out upon the vast
panorama of mountain ranges in the smoky distance.</p>

<p>George could remember its wide porches and comfortable rockers, its
innumerable eaves and gables, its labyrinth of wings and corridors, its
great parlours and their thick red carpets, and the lobby with its old
red leather chairs, hollowed and shaped by the backs of men, and its
smell of tobacco and its iced tinkle of tall drinks. It had a splendid
dining-room filled with laughter and quiet voices, where expert negroes
in white jackets bent and scraped and chuckled over the jokes of the
rich men from the North as with prayerful grace they served them
delicious foods out of old silver dishes. George could remember, too,
the smiles and the tender beauty of the rich men's wives and daughters.
As a boy he had been touched with the unutterable mystery of all these
things, for these wealthy travellers had come great distances and had
somehow brought with them an evocation of the whole golden and
unvisited world, with its fabulous cities and its promise of glory,
fame, and love.</p>

<p>It had been one of the pleasantest places in the town, but now it
was gone. An army of men and shovels had advanced upon this beautiful
green hill and had levelled it down to an ugly flat of clay, and had
paved it with a desolate horror of white concrete, and had built stores
and garages and office buildings and parking spaces--all raw and
new--and were now putting up a new hotel beneath the very spot where
the old one had stood. It was to be a structure of sixteen storeys, of
steel and concrete and pressed brick. It was being stamped out of the
same mould, as if by some gigantic biscuit-cutter of hotels, that had
produced a thousand others like it all over the country. And, to give a
sumptuous--if spurious--distinction to its patterned uniformity, it was
to be called The Libya-Ritz.</p>

<p>One day George ran into Sam Pennock, a boyhood friend and a
classmate at Pine Rock College. Sam came down the busy street swiftly
at his anxious, lunging stride, and immediately, without a word of
greeting, he broke hoarsely into the abrupt and fragmentary manner of
speaking that had always been characteristic of him, but that now
seemed more feverish than ever:</p>

<p>"When did you get here?...How long are you going to stay?...What do
you think of the way things look here?" Then, without waiting for an
answer, he demanded with brusque, challenging, and almost impatient
scornfulness: "Well, what do you intend to do--be a
two-thousand-dollar-a-year school-teacher all your life?"</p>

<p>The contemptuous tone, with its implication of superiority--an
implication he had noticed before in the attitude of these people, big
with their inflated sense of wealth and achievement--stung George to
retort sharply:</p>

<p>"There are worse things than teaching school! Being a paper
millionaire is one of them! As for the two thousand dollars a year, you
really get it, Sam! It's not real estate money, it's money you can
spend. You can buy a ham sandwich with it."</p>

<p>Sam laughed. "You're right!" he said. "I don't blame you. It's the
truth!" He began to shake his head slowly. "Lord, Lord!" he said.
"They've all gone clean out of their heads here...Never saw anything
like it in my life...Why, they're all crazy-as a loon!" he exclaimed.
"You can't talk to them...You can't reason with them...They won't
listen to you...They're getting prices for property here that you
couldn't get' in New York."</p>

<p>"Are they <i>getting</i> it?"</p>

<p>"Well," he said, with a falsetto laugh, "they get the first five
hundred dollars...You pay the next five hundred thousand on time."</p>

<p>"How much time?"</p>

<p>"God!" he said. "I don't know...All you want, I reckon...For
ever!...It doesn't matter...You sell it next day for a million."</p>

<p>"On time?"</p>

<p>"That's it!" he cried, laughing. "You make half a million just like
that."</p>

<p>"On time?"</p>

<p>"You've got it!" said Sam. "On time...God! Crazy, crazy, crazy," he
kept laughing and shaking his head. "That's the way they make it."</p>

<p>"Are you making it, too?"</p>

<p>At once his manner became feverishly earnest: "Why, it's the
damnedest thing you ever heard of!" he said. "I'm raking it in hand
over fist!...Made three hundred thousand dollars in the last two
months...Why, it's the truth!...Made a trade yesterday and turned round
and sold the lot again not two hours later...Fifty thousand dollars
just like that!" he snapped his fingers. "Does your uncle want to sell
that house on Locust Street where your Aunt Maw lived?...Have you
talked to him about it?...Would he consider an offer?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so, if he gets enough."</p>

<p>"How much does be want?" he demanded impatiently. "Would he take a
hundred thousand?"</p>

<p>"Could you get it for him?"</p>

<p>"I could get it within twenty-four hours," he said. "I know a man
who'd snap it up in five minutes...I tell you what I'll do, Monk, if
you persuade him to sell--I'll split the commission with you...I'll
give you five thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"All right, Sam, it's a go. Could you let me have fifty cents on
account?"</p>

<p>"Do you think he'll sell?" he asked eagerly.</p>

<p>"Really, I don't know, but I doubt it. That place was my
grandfather's. It's been in the family a long time. I imagine he'll
want to keep it."</p>

<p>"Keep it! What's the sense in keeping it?...Now's the time when
things are at the peak. He'll never get a better offer!"</p>

<p>"I know, but he's expecting to strike oil out in the backyard any
time now," said George with a laugh.</p>

<p>At this moment there was a disturbance among the tides of traffic in
the street. A magnificent car detached itself from the stream of
humbler vehicles and moved in swiftly to the kerb, where it came to a
smooth stop--a glitter of nickel, glass, and burnished steel. From it a
gaudily attired creature stepped down to the pavement with an air of
princely indolence, tucked a light Malacca cane carelessly under its
right armpit, and slowly and fastidiously withdrew from its nicotined
fingers a pair of lemon-coloured gloves, at the same time saying to the
liveried chauffeur:</p>

<p>"You may go, James. Call for me again in hal-luf an houah!" The
creature's face was thin and sunken. Its complexion was a deathly
sallow--all except the nose, which was bulbous and glowed a brilliant
red, showing an intricate network of enlarged purple veins. Its
toothless jaws were equipped with such an enormous set of glittering
false teeth that the lips could not cover them, and they grinned at the
world with the prognathous bleakness of a skeleton. The whole figure,
although heavy and shambling, had the tottering appearance which
suggested a stupendous debauchery. It moved forward with its false,
bleak grin, leaning heavily upon the stick, and suddenly George
recognised that native ruin which had been known to him since childhood
as Tim Wagner.</p>

<p>J. Timothy Wagner--the "J" was a recent and completely arbitrary
addition of his own, appropriated, no doubt, to fit his ideas of
personal grandeur, and to match the eminent position in the town's
affairs to which he had belatedly risen--was the black sheep of one of
the old, established families in the community. At the time George
Webber was a boy, Tim Wagner had been for so long the product of
complete disillusion that there was no longer any vestige of respect
attached to him.</p>

<p>He had been pre-eminently the town sot. His title to this office was
unquestioned. In this capacity he was even held in a kind of affection.
His exploits were notorious, the subjects of a hundred stories. One
night, for example, the loafers in McCormack's pharmacy had seen Tim
swallow something and then shudder convulsively. This process was
repeated several times, until the curiosity of the loafers was aroused.
They began to observe him furtively but closely, and in a few minutes
Tim thrust out his hand slyly, fumbled round in the gold-fish bowl, and
withdrew his hand with a wriggling little shape between his fingers.
Then the quick swallow and the convulsive shudder were repeated.</p>

<p>He had inherited two fortunes before his twenty-fifth year and had
run through them both. Hilarious stories were told of Tim's celebrated
pleasure tour upon the inheritance of the second fortune. He had
chartered a private car, stocked it plentifully with liquor, and
selected as his travelling companions the most notorious sots,
vagabonds, and tramps the community could furnish. The debauch had
lasted eight months. This party of itinerant bacchuses had made a tour
of the entire country. They had exploded their empty flasks against the
ramparts of the Rocky Mountains, tossed their empty kegs into San
Francisco Bay, strewn the plains with their beer bottles. At last the
party had achieved a condition of exhausted satiety in the nation's
capital, where Tim, with what was left of his inheritance, had engaged
an entire floor at one of the leading hotels. Then, one by one, the
exhausted wanderers had drifted back to town, bringing tales of
bacchanalian orgies that had not been equalled since the days of the
Roman emperors, and leaving Tim finally in solitary possession of the
wreckage of empty suites.</p>

<p>From that time on he had slipped rapidly into a state of perpetual
sottishness. Even then, however, he had retained the traces of an
attractive and engaging personality. Everyone had had a tolerant and
unspoken affection for him. Save for the harm he did himself, Tim was
an inoffensive and good-natured creature.</p>

<p>His figure on the streets of the town at night had been a familiar
one. From sunset on, he might be found almost anywhere. It was easy to
tell what progressive state of intoxication he had reached simply by
observing his method of locomotion. No one ever saw him stagger. He did
not weave drunkenly along the pavement. Rather, when he approached the
saturation point, he walked very straight, very rapidly, but with funny
little short steps. As he walked he kept his face partly lowered,
glancing quickly and comically from side to side, with little
possumlike looks. If he approached complete paralysis, he just stood
quietly and leaned against something--a lamppost or a door-way or the
side of a building or the front of the drugstore. Here he would remain
for hours in a state of solemn immobility, broken only by an occasional
belch. His face, already grown thin and flabby-jowled, with its flaming
beacon of a nose, would at these times be composed in an expression of
drunken gravity, and his whole condition would be characterised by a
remarkable alertness, perceptiveness, and control. He rarely
degenerated into complete collapse. Almost always he could respond
instantly and briskly to a word of greeting.</p>

<p>Even the police had had a benevolent regard for him, and they had
exercised a friendly guardianship over him. Through long experience and
observation, every policeman on the force was thoroughly acquainted
with Tim's symptoms. They could tell at a glance just what degree of
intoxication he had reached, and if they thought he had crossed the
final border line and that his collapse in door-way or gutter was
imminent, they would take charge of him, speaking to him kindly, but
with a stern warning:</p>

<p>"Tim, if you're on the streets again to-night, we're going to lock
you up. Now you go on home and go to bed."</p>

<p>To this Tim would nod briskly, with instant and amiable agreement:
"Yes, sir, yes, sir. Just what I was going to do, Captain Crane, when
you spoke to me. Going home right this minute. Yes, sir."</p>

<p>With these words he would start off briskly across the street, his
legs making their little fast, short steps and his eyes darting
comically from side to side, until he had vanished round the corner.
Within ten or fifteen minutes, however, he might be seen again, easing
his way along cautiously in the dark shadow of a building, creeping up
to the corner, and peeking round with a sly look on his face to see if
any of the watchdogs of the law were in sight.</p>

<p>As time went on and his life lapsed more and more into total
vagabondage, one of his wealthy aunts, in the hope that some employment
might partially retrieve him, had given him the use of a vacant lot
behind some buildings in the business section of the town, a short
half-block from Main Street. The motor-car had now come in sufficient
numbers to make parking laws important, and Tim was allowed by his aunt
to use this lot as parking space for cars and to keep the money thus
obtained. In this employment he succeeded far better than anyone
expected. He had little to do except stay on the premises, and this was
not difficult for him so long as he was plentifully supplied with corn
whisky.</p>

<p>During this period of his life some canvassers at a local election,
had looked for Tim to enrol him in the interest of their candidate, but
they had been unable to find out where he lived. He had not; lived, of
course, with any member of his family for years, and investigation
failed to disclose that he had a room anywhere. The question then began
to go round: "Where does Tim Wagner live? Where does he sleep?" No one
could find out. And Tim's own answers, when pressed for information,
were slyly evasive.</p>

<p>One day, however, the answer came to light. The motor-car had come,
and come so thoroughly that people were even getting buried by
motor-car. The day of the horse-drawn hearse had passed for ever.
Accordingly, one of the local undertaking firms had told Tim he could
have their old horse-drawn hearse if he would only take it off their
premises. Tim had accepted the macabre gift and had parked the hearse
in his lot. One day when Tim was absent the canvassers came back again,
still persistent in their efforts to learn his address so they could
enrol him. They noticed the old hearse, and, seeing that its raven
curtains were so closely drawn that the interior was hidden from view,
they decided to investigate. Cautiously they opened the doors of the
hearse. A cot was inside. There was even a chair. It was completely
furnished as a small but adequate bedroom.</p>

<p>So at last his secret had been found out. Henceforth all the town
knew where he lived.</p>

<p>That was Tim Wagner as George had known him fifteen years ago. Since
then he had been so constantly steeped in alcohol that his progressive
disintegration had been marked, and he had lately adopted the fantastic
trappings of a clown of royalty. Everyone knew all about him, and
yet--the fact was incredible!--Tim Wagner had now become the supreme
embodiment of the town's extravagant folly. For, as gamblers will stake
a fortune on some moment's whimsey of belief, thrusting their money
into a stranger's hand and bidding him to play with it because the
colour of his hair is lucky, or as racetrack men will rub the hump upon
a cripple's back to bring them luck, so the people of the town now
listened prayerfully to every word Tim Wagner uttered. They sought his
opinion in all their speculations, and acted instantly on this
suggestions. He had become--in what way and for what reason no one
knew--the high priest and prophet of this insanity of waste.</p>

<p>They knew that he was diseased and broken, that his wits were always
addled now with alcohol, but they used him as men once used divining
rods. They deferred to him as Russian peasants once deferred to the
village idiot. They now believed with an absolute and unquestioning
faith that some power of intuition in him made all his judgments
infallible.</p>

<p>It was this creature who had just alighted at the kerb a little
beyond George Webber and Sam Pennock, full of drunken majesty and
bleary-eyed foppishness. Sam turned to him with a movement of feverish
eagerness, saying to George abruptly:</p>

<p>"Wait a minute! I've got to speak to Tim Wagner about something!
Wait till I come back!"</p>

<p>George watched the scene with amazement. Tim Wagner, still drawing
the gloves off of his fingers with an expression of bored casualness,
walked slowly over towards the entrance of McCormack's drug-store--no
longer were his steps short and quick, for he leaned heavily on his
cane--while Sam, in an attitude of obsequious entreaty, kept at his
elbow, bending his tall form towards him and hoarsely pouring out a
torrent of questions:</p>

<p>"...Property in West Libya...Seventy-five thousand dollars...Option
expires to-morrow at noon...Joe Ingram has the piece above mine...Won't
sell...Holding for hundred fifty...Mine's the best location...But Fred
Bynum says too far from main road...What do you think, Tim?...Is it
worth it?"</p>

<p>During the course of this torrential appeal Tim Wagner did not even
turn to look at his petitioner. He gave no evidence whatever that he
heard what Sam was saying. Instead, he stopped, thrust his gloves into
his pocket, cast, his eyes round slyly in a series of quick glances,
and suddenly began to root into himself violently with a clutching
hand. Then he straightened up like a man just coming out of a trance,
and seemed to become aware for the first time that Sam was waiting.</p>

<p>"What's that? What did you say, Sam?" he said rapidly. "How much did
they offer you for it? Don't sell, don't sell!" he said suddenly and
with great emphasis. "Now's the time to buy, not to sell. The trend is
upwards. Buy! Buy! Don't take it. Don't sell. That's my advice!"</p>

<p>"I'm not selling, Tim," Sam cried excitedly. "I'm thinking of
buying."</p>

<p>"Oh--yes, yes, yes!" Tim muttered rapidly. "I see, I see." He turned
now for the first time and fixed his eyes upon his questioner. "Where
did you say it was?" he demanded sharply. "Deepwood? Good! Good! Can't
go wrong! Buy! Buy!"</p>

<p>He started to walk away into the drug-store, and the lounging idlers
moved aside deferentially to let him pass. Sam rushed after him
frantically and caught him by the arm, shouting:</p>

<p>"No, no, Tim! It's not Deepwood! It's the other way...I've been
telling you...It's West Libya!"</p>

<p>"What's that?" Tim cried sharply. "West Libya? Why didn't you say
so? That's different. Buy! Buy! Can't go wrong! Whole town's moving in
that direction. Values double out there in six months. How much do they
want?"</p>

<p>"Seventy-five thousand," Sam panted. "Option expires tomorrow...Five
yeas to pay it up."</p>

<p>"Buy! Buy!" Tim barked, and walked off into the drug-store.</p>

<p>Sam strode back towards George, his eyes blazing with
excitement.</p>

<p>"Did you hear him? Did you hear what he said?" he demanded hoarsely.
"You heard him, didn't you?...Best damned judge of real estate that
ever lived...Never known to make a mistake!...'Buy! Buy! Will double in
value in six months!'...You were standing right here"--he said hoarsely
and accusingly, glaring at George--"you heard what he said, didn't
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I heard him."</p>

<p>Sam glanced wildly about him, passed his hand nervously through his
hair several times, and then said, sighing heavily and shaking his head
in wonder:</p>

<p>"Seventy-five thousand dollars' profit in one deal!...Never heard
anything like it in my...life! Lord, Lord!" he cried. "What are we
coming to?"</p>

<p>Somehow the news had got round that George had written a book and
that it would soon be published. The editor of the local paper heard of
it and sent a reporter to interview him, and printed a story about
it.</p>

<p>"So you've written a book?" said the reporter. "What kind of a book
is it? What's it about?"</p>

<p>"Why--I--I hardly know how to tell you," George stammered. "It--it's
a novel----"</p>

<p>"A Southern novel? Anything to do with this part of the
country?"</p>

<p>"Well--yes--that is--it's about the South, all right--about an Old
Catawba family--but----"</p>

<blockquote>LOCAL BOY WRITES ROMANCE OF THE OLD SOUTH<br>
<br>


<p>George Webber, son of the late John Webber and nephew of Mark
Joyner, local hardware merchant, has written a novel with a Libya Hill
background which the New York house of James Rodney &amp; Co. will
publish this autumn.<br>
<br>
</p>

<p>When interviewed last night, the young author stated that his book
was a romance of the Old South, centring about the history of a
distinguished antebellum family of this region. The people of Libya
Hill and environs will await the publication of the book with special
interest, not only because many of them will remember the author, who
was born and brought up here, but also because that stirring period of
Old Catawba's past has never before been accorded its rightful place of
honour in the annals of Southern literature.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"We understand you have travelled a great deal since you left home.
Been to Europe several times?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have."</p>

<p>"In your opinion, how does this section of the country compare with
other places you have seen?"</p>

<p>"Why--why--er--why <i>good!</i>...I mean, <i>fine!</i> That
is----"</p>

<blockquote>LOCAL PARADISE COMPARES FAVOURABLY<br>
<br>


<p>In answer to the reporter's question as to how this part of the
country compared to other places he had seen, the former Libya man
declared:<br>
<br>
</p>

<p>"There is no place I have ever visited--and my travels have taken me
to England, Germany, Scotland, Ireland, Wales, Norway, Denmark, Sweden,
to say nothing of the south of France, the Italian Riviera, and the
Swiss Alps--which can compare in beauty with the setting of my native
town.<br>
<br>
</p>

<p>"We have here," he said enthusiastically, "a veritable Paradise of
Nature. Air, climate, scenery, water, natural beauty, all conspire to
make this section the most ideal place in the whole world to live."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"Did you ever think of coming back here to live?"</p>

<p>"Well--yes--I <i>have</i> thought of it--but--you see----"</p>

<blockquote>WILL SETTLE AND BUILD HERE<br>
<br>


<p>When questioned as to his future plans, the author said:<br>
<br>
</p>

<p>"For years, my dearest hope and chief ambition has been that one day
I should be able to come back here to live. One who has ever known the
magic of these hills cannot forget them. I hope, therefore, that the
time is not far distant when I may return for good.<br>
<br>
</p>

<p>"Here, I feel, as nowhere else," the author continued wistfully,
"that I will be able to and the inspiration that I must have to do my
work. Scenically, climatically, geographically, and in every other way,
the logical spot for a modern renaissance is right here among these
hills. There is no reason why, in ten years' time, this community
should not be a great artistic colony, drawing to it the great artists,
the music and the beauty lovers, of the whole world, as Salzburg does
now. The Rhododendron Festival is already a step in the right
direction.<br>
<br>
</p>

<p>"It shall be a part of my purpose from now on," the earnest young
author added, "to do everything in my power to further this great
cause, and to urge all my writing and artistic friends to settle hereto
make Libya Hill the place it ought to be--The Athens of America."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"Do you intend to write another book?"</p>

<p>"Yes--that is--I hope so. In fact--"</p>

<p>"Would you care to say anything about it?"</p>

<p>"Well--I don't know--it's pretty hard to say----"</p>

<p>"Come on, son, don't be bashful. We're all your home folks
here...Now, take Longfellow. <i>There</i> was a great writer! You know
what a young fellow with your ability ought to do? He ought to come
back here and do for this section what Longfellow did for New
England..."</p>

<blockquote>PLANS NATIVE SAGA<br>
<br>


<p>When pressed for details about the literary work he hopes to do
hereafter, the author became quite explicit:<br>
<br>
</p>

<p>"I want to return here," he said, "and commemorate the life,
history, and development of Western Catawba in a series of poetic
legends comparable to those with which the poet Longfellow commemorated
the life of the Acadians and the folklore of the New England
countryside. What I have in mind is a trilogy that will begin with the
early settlement of the region by the first pioneers, among them my own
forebears, and will trace the steady progress of Libya Hill from its
founding and the coming of the railroad right down to its present
international prominence and the proud place it occupies to-day as 'The
Gem City of the Hills'."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>George writhed and swore when he read the article. There was hardly
an accurate statement in it. He felt angry and sheepish and guilty all
at the same time.</p>

<p>He sat down and wrote a scathing letter to the paper, but when he
had finished he tore it up. After all, what good would it do? The
reporter had spun his story out of nothing more substantial than his
victim's friendly tones and gestures, a few words and phrases which he
had blurted out in his confusion, and, above all, his reticence to talk
about his work; yet the fellow had obviously been so steeped in the
booster spirit that he had been able to concoct this elaborate
fantasy--probably without quite knowing that it was a fantasy.</p>

<p>Then, too, he reflected, people would take an emphatic denial of the
statements that had been attributed to him as evidence that he was a
sorehead, full of conceit about his book. You couldn't undo the effect
of a thing like this with a simple negative. If he gave the lie to all
that gush, everybody would say he was attacking the town and turning
against those who had nurtured him. Better let bad enough alone.</p>

<p>So he did nothing about it. And after that, strangely enough, it
seemed to George that the attitude of people changed towards him. Not
that they had been unfriendly before. It was only that he now felt they
approved of him. This in itself gave him a quiet sense of
accomplishment, as if the stamp of business confirmation had been put
upon him.</p>

<p>Like all Americans, George had been amorous of material success, so
it made him happy now to know that the people of his home town believed
he had got it, or at any rate was at last on the highroad to it. One
thing about the whole affair was most fortunate. The publisher who had
accepted his book had an old and much respected name; people knew the
name, and would meet him on the street and wring his hand and say:</p>

<p>"So your book is going to be published by James Rodney &amp;
Co.?"</p>

<p>That simple question, asked with advance knowledge of the fact, had
a wonderful sound. It had a ring, not only of congratulation that his
book was being published, but also of implication that the
distinguished house of Rodney had been fortunate to secure it. That was
the way it sounded, and it was probably also the way it was meant. He
had the feeling, therefore, that in the eyes of his own people he had
"arrived". He was no longer a queer young fellow who had consumed his
substance in the deluded hope that he was--oh, loaded word!--"a
writer". He <i>was</i> a writer. He was not only a writer, but a writer
who was about to be published, and by the ancient and honourable James
Rodney &amp; Co.</p>

<p>There is something good in the way people welcome success, or
anything--no matter what--that is stamped with the markings of success.
It is not an ugly thing, really. People love success because to most of
them it means happiness, and, whatever form it takes, it is the image
of what they, in their hearts, would like to be. This is more true in
America than anywhere else. People put this label on the image of their
heart's desire because they have never had an image of another kind of
happiness. So, essentially, this love of success is not a bad thing,
but a good thing. It calls forth a general and noble response, even
though the response may also be mixed with self-interest. People are
happy for <i>your</i> happiness because they want so much to be happy
themselves. Therefore it's a good thing. The idea behind it is good,
anyhow. The only trouble with it is that the direction is
misplaced.</p>

<p>That was the way it seemed to George. He had gone through a long and
severe period of probation, and now he was approved. It made him very
happy. There is nothing in the world that will take the chip off of
one's shoulder like a feeling of success. The chip was off now, and
George didn't want to fight anybody. For the first time he felt that it
was good to be home again.</p>

<p>Not that he did not have his apprehensions. He knew what he had
written about the people and the life of his home town. He knew, too,
that he had written about them with a nakedness and directness which,
up to that time, had been rare in American fiction. He wondered how
they would take it. Even when people congratulated him about the book
he could not altogether escape a feeling of uneasiness, for he was
afraid of what they would say and think after the book came out and
they had read it.</p>

<p>These apprehensions took violent possession of him one night in a
most vivid and horrible dream. He thought he was running and stumbling
over the blasted heath of some foreign land, fleeing in terror from he
knew not what. All that he knew was that he was filled with a nameless
shame. It was wordless, and as shapeless as a smothering fog, yet his
whole mind and soul shrank back in an agony of revulsion and
self-contempt. So overwhelming was his sense of loathing and guilt that
he coveted the place of murderers on whom the world had visited the
fierceness of its wrath. He envied the whole list of those criminals
who had reaped the sentence of mankind's dishonour--the thief, the
liar, the trickster, the outlaw, and the traitor--men whose names were
anathema and were spoken with a curse, but which <i>were</i> spoken;
for <i>he</i> had committed a crime for which there was no name,
<i>he</i> was putrescent with a taint for which there was neither
comprehension nor cure, he was rotten with a vileness of corruption
that placed him equally beyond salvation or vengeance, remote alike
from pity, love, and hatred, and unworthy of a curse. Thus he fled
across the immeasurable and barren heath beneath a burning sky, an
exile in the centre of a planetary vacancy which, like his own shameful
self, had no place either among things living or among things dead, and
in which there was neither vengeance of lightning nor mercy of burial;
for in all that limitless horizon there was no shade or shelter, no
curve or bend, no hill or tree or hollow: there was only one vast,
naked eye--searing and inscrutable--from which there was no escape, and
which bathed his defenceless soul in its fathomless depths of
shame.</p>

<p>And then, with bright and sharp intensity, the dream changed, and
suddenly he found himself among the scenes and faces he had known long
ago. He was a traveller who had returned after many years of wandering
to the place he had known in his childhood. The sense of his dreadful
but nameless corruption still hung ominously above him as he entered
the streets of the town again, and he knew that he had returned to the
springs of innocence and health from whence he came, and by which he
would be saved.</p>

<p>But as he came into the town he became aware that the knowledge of
his guilt was everywhere about him. He saw the men and women he had
known in childhood, the boys with whom he had gone to school, the girls
he had taken to dances. They were engaged in all their varied
activities of life and business, and they showed their friendship
towards one another, but when he approached and offered his hand in
greeting they looked at him with blank stares, and in their gaze there
was no love, hatred, pity, loathing, or any feeling whatsoever. Their
faces, which had been full of friendliness and affection when they
spoke to one another, went dead; they gave no sign of recognition or of
greeting; they answered him briefly in toneless voices, giving him what
information he asked, and repulsed every effort he made towards a
resumption of old friendship with the annihilation of silence and that
blank and level stare. They did not laugh or mock or nudge or whisper
when he passed; they only waited and were still, as if they wanted but
one thing--that he should depart out of their sight.</p>

<p>He walked on through the old familiar streets, past houses and
places that lived again for him as if he had never left them, and by
people who grew still and waited until he had gone, and the knowledge
of wordless guilt was rooted in his soul. He knew that he was
obliterated from their lives more completely than if he had died, and
he felt that he was now lost to all men.</p>

<p>Presently he had left the town, and was again upon the blasted
heath, and he was fleeing across it beneath the pitiless sky where
flamed the naked eye that pierced him with its unutterable weight of
shame.</p>

<h2><a name="chapter1-08"></a>8. The Company</h2>

<p>George considered himself lucky to have the little room over the
Shepperton garage. He was also glad that his visit had overlapped that
of Mr. David Merrit, and that Mr. Merrit had been allowed to enjoy
undisturbed the greater comfort of the Shepperton guest room, for Mr.
Merrit had filled him with a pleasant glow at their first meeting. He
was a ruddy, plump, well-kept man of forty-five or so, always ready
with a joke and immensely agreeable, with pockets bulging with savoury
cigars which he handed out to people on the slightest provocation.
Randy had spoken of him as "the Company's man," and, although George
did not know what the duties of a "Company's man" were, Mr. Merrit made
them seem very pleasant.</p>

<p>George knew, of course, that Mr. Merrit was Randy's boss, and he
learned that Mr. Merrit was in the habit of coming to town every two or
three months. He would arrive like a benevolent, pink-cheeked Santa
Claus, making his jolly little jokes, passing out his fat cigars,
putting his arm round people's shoulders, and, in general, making
everyone feel good. As he said himself:</p>

<p>"I've got to turn up now and then just to see that the boys are
behaving themselves, and not taking in any wooden nickels."</p>

<p>Here he winked at George in such a comical way that all of them had
to grin. Then he gave George a big cigar.</p>

<p>His functions seemed to be ambassadorial. He was always taking Randy
and the salesmen of the Company out to lunch or dinner, and, save for
brief visits to the office, he seemed to spend most of his time
inaugurating an era of good feeling and high living. He would go around
town and meet everybody, slapping people on the back and calling them
by their first names, and for a week after he had left the business men
of Libya Hill would still be smoking his cigars. When he came to town
he always stayed "out of the house", and one knew that Margaret would
prepare her best meals for him, and that there would be some good
drinks. Mr. Merrit supplied the drinks himself, for he always brought
along a plentiful store of expensive beverages. George could see at
their first meeting that he was the kind of man who exudes an aura of
good fellowship, and that was why it was so pleasant to have Mr. Merrit
staying in the house.</p>

<p>Mr. Merrit was not only a nice fellow. He was also "with the
Company", and George soon realised that "the Company" was a vital and
mysterious force in all their lives. Randy had gone with it as soon as
he left college. He had been sent to the main office, up North
somewhere, and had been put through a course of training. Then he had
come back South and had worked his way up from salesman to district
agent--an important member of the sales organisation.</p>

<p>"The Company", "district agent", "the sales
organisation"--mysterious titles all of them, but most comforting.
During the week George was in Libya Hill with Randy and Margaret, Mr.
Merrit was usually on hand at meal times, and at night he would sit out
on the front porch with them and carry on in his jolly way, joking and
laughing and giving them all a good time. Sometimes he would talk shop
with Randy, telling stories about the Company and about his own
experiences in the organisation, and before long George began to pick
up a pretty good idea of what it was all about.</p>

<p>The Federal Weight, Scales, and Computing Company was a far-flung
empire which had a superficial aspect of great complexity, but in its
essence it was really beautifully simple. Its heart and soul--indeed,
its very life--was its sales organisation.</p>

<p>The entire country was divided into districts, and over each
district an agent was appointed. This agent, in turn, employed salesmen
to cover the various portions of his district. Each district also had
an "office man" to attend to any business that might come up while the
agent and his salesmen were away, and a "repair man" whose duty it was
to overhaul damaged or broken-down machines. Together, these comprised
the agency, and the country was so divided that there was, on the
average, an agency for every unit of half a million people in the total
population. Thus there were two hundred and sixty or seventy agencies
through the nation, and the agents with their salesmen made up a
working force of from twelve to fifteen hundred men.</p>

<p>The higher purposes of this industrial empire, which the employees
almost never referred to by name, as who should speak of the deity with
coarse directness, but always with a just perceptible lowering and
huskiness of the voice as "the Company"--these higher purposes were
also beautifully simple. They were summed up in the famous utterance of
the Great Man himself, Mr. Paul S. Appleton, III, who invariably
repeated it every year as a peroration to his hour-long address before
the assembled members of the sales organisation at their national
convention. Standing before them at the close of each year's session,
he would sweep his arm in a gesture of magnificent command towards an
enormous map of the United States of America that covered the whole
wall behind him, and say:</p>

<p>"There's your market! Go out and sell them!"</p>

<p>What could be simpler and more beautiful than this? What could more
eloquently indicate that mighty sweep of the imagination which has been
celebrated in the annals of modern business under the name of "vision"?
The words had the spacious scope and austere directness that have
characterised the utterances of great leaders in every epoch of man's
history. It is Napoleon speaking to his troops in Egypt: "Soldiers,
from the summit of yonder pyramids, forty centuries look down upon
you." It is Captain Perry: "We have met the enemy, and they are ours."
It is Dewey at Manila Bay: "You may fire when ready, Gridley." It is
Grant before Spottsylvania Court House: "I propose to fight it out on
this line, if it takes all summer."</p>

<p>So when Mr. Paul S. Appleton, III, waved his arm at the wall and
said: "There's your market! Go out and sell them!"--the assembled
captains, lieutenants, and privates in the ranks of his sales
organisation knew that there were still giants in the earth, and that
the age of romance was not dead.</p>

<p>True, there had once been a time when the aspirations of the Company
had been more limited. That was when the founder of the institution,
the grandfather of Mr. Paul S. Appleton, III, had expressed his modest
hopes by saying: "I should like to see one of my machines in every
store, shop, or business that needs one, and that can afford to pay for
one." But the self-denying restrictions implicit in the founder's
statement had long since become so out of date as to seem utterly
mid-Victorian. Mr. David Merrit admitted it himself. Much as he hated
to speak ill of any man, and especially the founder of the Company, he
had to confess that by the standards of 1929 the old gentleman had
lacked vision.</p>

<p>"That's old stuff now," said Mr. Merrit, shaking his head and
winking at George, as though to take the curse off of his treason to
the founder by making a joke of it. "We've gone way beyond that!" he
exclaimed with pardonable pride. "Why, if we waited nowadays to sell a
machine to someone who <i>needs</i> one, we'd get nowhere." He was
nodding now at Randy, and speaking with the seriousness of deep
conviction. "We don't wait until he <i>needs</i> one. If he says he's
getting along all right without one, we make him buy one anyhow. We
make him see the need, don't we, Randy? In other words, we
<i>create</i> the need."</p>

<p>This, as Mr. Merrit went on to explain, was what is known in more
technical phrase as "creative salesmanship" or "creating the market".
And this poetic conception was the inspired work of one man--none other
than the present head of the Company, Mr. Paul S. Appleton, III,
himself. The idea had come to him in a single blinding flash, born
full-blown like Pallas Athene from the head of Zeus, and Mr. Merrit
still remembered the momentous occasion as vividly as if it had been
only yesterday. It was at one of the meetings of the assembled
parliaments of the Company that Mr. Appleton, soaring in an impassioned
flight of oratory, became so intoxicated with the grandeur of his own
vision that he stopped abruptly in the middle of a sentence and stood
there as one entranced, gazing out dreamily into the unknown vistas of
magic Canaan; and when he at last went on again, it was in a voice
surcharged with quivering emotion:</p>

<p>"My friends," he said, "the possibilities of the market, now that we
see how to create it, are practically unlimited!" Here he was silent
for a moment, and Mr. Merrit said that the Great Man actually paled and
seemed to stagger as he tried to speak, and that his voice faltered and
sank to an almost inaudible whisper, as if he himself could hardly
comprehend the magnitude of his own conception. "My friends"--he
muttered thickly, and was seen to clutch the rostrum for support--"my
friends--seen properly"--he whispered, and moistened his dry
lips--"seen properly--the market we shall create being what it is"--his
voice grew stronger, and the clarion words now rang forth--"there is no
reason why one of our machines should not be in the possession of every
man, woman, and child in the United\ States!" Then came the grand,
familiar gesture to the map: "There's your market, boys! Go out and
sell them!"</p>

<p>Henceforth this vision became the stone on which Mr. Paul S.
Appleton, III, erected the magnificent edifice of the true church and
living faith which was called "the Company". And in the service of this
vision Mr. Appleton built up an organisation which worked with the
beautiful precision of a locomotive piston. Over the salesman was the
agent, and over the agent was the district supervisor, and over the
district supervisor was the district manager, and over the district
manager was the general manager, and over the general manager was--if
not God himself, then the next thing to it, for the agents and salesmen
referred to him in tones of proper reverence as "P. S. A."</p>

<p>Mr. Appleton also invented a special Company Heaven known as the
Hundred Club. Its membership was headed by P. S. A., and all the ranks
of the sales organisation were eligible, down to the humblest salesman.
The Hundred Club was a social order, but it was also a good deal more
than that. Each agent and salesman had a "quota"--that is to say, a
certain amount of business which was assigned to him as the normal
average of his district and capacity. A man's quota differed from
another's according to the size of his territory, its wealth, and his
own experience and ability. One man's quota would be sixty, another's
eighty, another's ninety or one hundred, and if he was a district
agent, his quota would be higher than that of a mere salesman. Each
man, however, no matter how small or how large his quota might be, was
eligible for membership in the Hundred Club, the only restriction being
that he must average one hundred per cent of his quota. If he averaged
more--if he got, say, one hundred and twenty per cent of his
quota--there were appropriate honours and rewards, not only social but
financial as well. One could be either high up or low down in the
Hundred Club, for it had almost as many degrees of merit as the Masonic
order.</p>

<p>The unit of the quota system was "the point", and a point was forty
dollars' worth of business. So if a salesman had a quota of eighty,
this meant that he had to sell the products of the Federal Weight,
Scales, and Computing Company to the amount of at least $3200 every
month, or almost $40,000 a year. The rewards were high. A salesman's
commission was from fifteen to twenty per cent of his sales; an agent's
from, twenty to twenty-five per cent. Beyond this there were bonuses to
be earned by achieving or surpassing his quota. Thus it was possible
for an ordinary salesman in an average district to earn from $6,000 to
$8,000 a year, while an agent could earn from $12,000 to $15,000, and
even more if his district was an exceptionally good one.</p>

<p>So much for the rewards of Mr. Appleton's Heaven. But what would
Heaven be if there were no Hell? So Mr. Appleton was forced by the
logic of the situation to invent a Hell, too. Once a man's quota was
fixed at any given point, the Company never reduced it. Moreover, if a
salesman's quota was eighty points and he achieved it during the year,
he must be prepared at the beginning of the new year to find that his
quota had been increased to ninety points. One had to go onwards and
upwards constantly, and the race was to the swift.</p>

<p>While it was quite true that membership in the Hundred Club was not
compulsory, it was also true that Mr. Paul S. Appleton, III, was a
theologian who, like Calvin, knew how to combine free will and
predestination. If one did not belong to the Hundred Club, the time was
not far distant when one would not belong to Mr. Appleton. Not to
belong to it was, for agent or salesman, the equivalent of living on
the other side of the railroad tracks. If one failed of admission to
the Company Heaven, or if one dropped out, his fellows would begin to
ask guardedly: "Where's Joe Klutz these days?" The answers would be
vague, and in the course of time Joe Klutz would be spoken of no more.
He would fade into oblivion. He was "no longer with the Company".</p>

<p>Mr. Paul S. Appleton, III, never had but the one revelation--the one
which Mr. Merrit so movingly described--but that was enough, and he
never let its glories and allurements grow dim. Four times a year, at
the beginning of each quarter, he would call his general manager before
him and say: "What's the matter, Elmer? You're not getting the
business! The market is <i>there!</i> You know what you can do about
it--or else...!" Thereupon the general manager would summon the
district managers one by one and repeat to them the words and manner of
P. S. A., and the district managers would reenact the scene before each
of the district supervisors, who would duplicate it to the agents, who
would pass it on to the salesmen, who, since they had no one below
them, would "get out and hustle--or else!" This was called "keeping up
the morale of the organisation."</p>

<p>As Mr. David Merrit sat on the front porch and told of his many
experiences with the Company, his words conveyed to George Webber a
great deal more than he actually said. For his talk went on and on in
its vein of mellow reminiscence, and Mr. Merrit made his little jokes
and puffed contentedly at one of his own cigars, and everything he said
carried an overtone of "What a fine and wonderful thing it is to be
connected with the Company!"</p>

<p>He told, for example, about the splendid occasion every year when
all the members of the Hundred Club were brought together for what was
known as "The Week of Play". This was a magnificent annual outing
conducted "at the Company's expense". The meeting place might be in
Philadelphia or Washington, or in the tropic opulence of Los Angeles or
Miami, or it might be on board a chartered ship--one of the small but
luxurious twenty-thousand-tonners that ply the transatlantic
routes--bound to Bermuda or Havana. Wherever it was, the Hundred Club
was given a free sweep. If the journey was by sea, the ship was
theirs--for a week. All the liquor in the world was theirs, if they
could drink it--and Bermuda's coral isles, or the unlicensed privilege
of gay Havana. For that one week everything on earth that money could
buy was at the command of the members of the Hundred Club, everything
was done on the grand scale, and the Company--the immortal, paternal,
and great-hearted Company--"paid for everything".</p>

<p>But as Mr. Merrit painted his glowing picture of the fun they had on
these occasions, George Webber saw quite another image. It was an image
of twelve or fifteen hundred men--for on these pilgrimages, by general
consent, women (or, at any rate, wives) were debarred--twelve or
fifteen hundred men, Americans, most of them in their middle years,
exhausted, overwrought, their nerves frayed down and stretched to the
breaking point, met from all quarters of the continent "at the
Company's expense" for one brief, wild, gaudy week of riot. And George
thought grimly what this tragic spectacle of business men at play meant
in terms of the entire scheme of things and the plan of life that had
produced it. He began to understand, too, the changes which time had
brought about in Randy.</p>

<p>The last day of his week in Libya Hill, George had gone to the
station to buy his return ticket and he stopped in at Randy's office a
little before one o'clock to go home to lunch with him. The outer
salesroom, with its shining stock of scales and computing machines
imposingly arrayed on walnut pedestals, was deserted, so he sat down to
wait. On one wall hung a gigantic coloured poster. "August Was the Best
Month in Federal History," it read. "<i>Make September a Better
One</i>! The Market's There, Mr. Agent. The Rest Is Up to You!"</p>

<p>Behind the salesroom was a little partitioned Space which served
Randy as an office. As George waited, gradually he became aware of
mysterious sounds emanating from beyond the partition. First there was
the rustle of heavy paper, as if the pages of a ledger were being
turned, and occasionally there would be a quick murmur of hushed
voices, confidential, ominous, interspersed with grunts and
half-suppressed exclamations. Then all at once there were two loud
bangs, as of a large ledger being slammed shut and thrown upon a desk
or table, and after a moment's silence the voices rose louder,
distinct, plainly audible. Instantly he recognised Randy's voice--low,
grave, hesitant, and deeply troubled. The other voice he had never
heard before.</p>

<p>But as he listened to that voice he began to tremble and grow white
about the lips. For its very tone was a foul insult to human life, an
ugly sneer whipped across the face of decent humanity, and as he
realised that that voice, these words, were being used against his
friend, he had a sudden blind feeling of murder in his heart. And what
was so perplexing and so troubling was that this devil's voice had in
it as well a curiously familiar note, as of someone he had known.</p>

<p>Then it came to him in a flash--it was Merrit speaking! The owner of
that voice, incredible as it seemed, was none other than that plump,
well-kept, jolly-looking man who had always been so full of hearty
cheerfulness and good spirits every time he had seen him.</p>

<p>Now, behind that little partition of glazed glass and varnished
wood, this man's voice had suddenly become fiendish. It was
inconceivable, and as George listened he grew sick, as one does in some
awful nightmare when he visions someone he knows doing some perverse
and abominable act. But what was most dreadful of all was Randy's
voice, humble, low, submissive, modestly entreating. Merrit's voice
would cut across the air like a gob of rasping phlegm, and then Randy's
voice--gentle, hesitant, deeply troubled--would come in from time to
time in answer.</p>

<p>"Well, what's the matter? Don't you want the job?"</p>

<p>"Why--why, yes, you know I do, Dave--haw-w"--and Randy's voice
lifted a little in a troubled and protesting laugh.</p>

<p>"What's the matter that you're not getting the business?"
"Why--haw-w!"--again the little laugh, embarrassed and troubled--"I
<i>thought</i> I was----"</p>

<p>"Well, you're not!" that rasping voice cut in like a knife. "This
district ought to deliver thirty per cent more business than you're
getting from it, and the Company is going to have it, too--or else! You
deliver or you go right out on your can! See? The Company doesn't give
a damn about you! It's after the business! You've been around a long
time, but you don't mean a damn bit more to the Company than anybody
else! And you know what's happened to a lot of other guys who got to
feeling they were too big for their job--don't you?"</p>

<p>"Why--why, yes, Dave--but--haw-w!" the little laugh
again"--but--honestly, I never thought----"</p>

<p>"We don't give a damn what you never thought!" the brutal voice
ripped in. "I've given you fair warning now! You get the business or
out you go!"</p>

<p>The glazed glass door burst open violently and Merrit came striding
out of the little partitioned office. When he saw George, he looked
startled. Then he was instantly transformed. His plump and ruddy face
became wreathed in smiles, and he cried out in a hearty tone:</p>

<p>"Well, well, well Look who's here! If it's not the old boy
himself!"</p>

<p>Randy had followed him out, and Merrit now turned and winked
humorously at him, in the manner of a man who is carrying on a little
bantering byplay:</p>

<p>"Randy," he said, "I believe George gets better looking from day to
day. Has he broken any hearts yet?"</p>

<p>Randy tried to smile, grey-faced and haggardly.</p>

<p>"I bet you're burning them up in the Big Town," said Merrit, turning
back to George. "And, say, I read that piece in the paper about your
book. Great stuff, son! We're all proud of you!"</p>

<p>He gave George a hearty slap on the back and turned away with an air
of jaunty readiness, picked up his hat, and said cheerfully:</p>

<p>"Well, what d'ya say, folks? What about one of Margaret's famous
meals, out at the old homestead? Well, you can't hurt my feelings. I'm
ready if you are. Let's go!"</p>

<p>And, smiling, ruddy, plump, cheerful, a perverted picture of amiable
good will to all the world, he sauntered through the door. For a moment
the two old friends just stood there looking at each other, white and
haggard, with a bewildered expression in their eyes. In Randy's eyes
there was also a look of shame. With that instinct for loyalty which
was one of the roots of his soul, he said:</p>

<p>"Dave's a good fellow...You--you see, he's got to do these
things...He--he's with the Company."</p>

<p>George didn't say anything. For as Randy spoke, and George
remembered all that Merrit had told him about the Company, a terrific
picture flashed through his, mind. It was a picture he had seen in a
gallery somewhere, portraying a long line of men stretching from the
Great Pyramid to the very portals of great Pharaoh's house, and great
Pharaoh stood with a thonged whip in his hand and applied it
unmercifully to the bare back and shoulders of the man in front of him,
who was great Pharaoh's chief overseer, and in the hand of the overseer
was a whip of many tails which he unstintedly applied to the quivering
back of the wretch before him, who was the chief overseer's chief
lieutenant, and in the lieutenant's hand a whip of rawhide which he
laid vigourously on the quailing body of his head sergeant, and in the
sergeant's hand a wicked flail with which he belaboured a whole company
of groaning corporals, and in the hands of every corporal a knotted
lash with which to whack a whole regiment of slaves, who pulled and
hauled and bore burdens and toiled and sweated and built the towering
structure of the pyramid.</p>

<p>So George didn't say anything. He couldn't. He had just found out
something about life that he had not known before.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="chapter1-09"></a>9. The City of Lost Men</h2>

<p>Late that afternoon George asked Margaret to go with him to the
cemetery, so she borrowed Randy's car and drove him out. On the way
they stopped at a florist's and bought some chrysanthemums, which
George placed on Aunt Maw's grave. There had been a heavy rain during
the week and the new-made mound had sunk an inch or two, leaving a
jagged crack round its edges.</p>

<p>As he laid the flowers on the damp, raw earth, suddenly it struck
him as strange that he should be doing it. He was not a sentimental
person, and for a moment it puzzled him that he should be making this
gesture. He hadn't planned to do it. He had simply seen the florist's
window as they drove along and, without thinking, had stopped and got
the flowers, and now there they were.</p>

<p>Then he realised why he had done it--and why he had wanted to come
back to the cemetery at all. This visit to Libya Hill, which he had
dreamed about so many times as his home-coming, and which had not
turned out in any way as he had thought it would be, was really his
leave-taking, his farewell. The last tie that had bound him to his
native earth was severed, and he was going out from here to make a life
for himself as each man must--alone.</p>

<p>And now, once again, the dusk was falling in this place, and in the
valley below the lights were beginning to come on in the town. With
Margaret at his side, he stood there and looked down upon it, and she
seemed to understand his feelings, for she was quiet and said nothing.
Then, in a low voice, George began to speak to her. He needed to tell
someone all that he had thought and felt during his week at borne.
Randy was not available, and Margaret was the only one left to whom he
could talk. She listened without interruption as he spoke about his
book and his hopes for it, telling her as well as he could what kind of
book it was, and how much he feared that the town would not like it.
She pressed his arm reassuringly, and the gesture was more eloquent
than any words could be.</p>

<p>He did not say anything about Randy and Merrit. There was no need to
alarm her unduly, no sense in robbing her of that security which is so
fundamental to a woman's peace and happiness. Sufficient unto the
day...</p>

<p>But he spoke at length about the town itself, telling her all that
he had seen of its speculative madness, and how it had impressed him.
What did the future hold for that place and its people? They were
always talking of the better life that lay ahead of them and of the
greater city they would build, but to George it seemed that in all such
talk there was evidence of a strange and savage hunger that drove them
on, and that there was a desperate quality in it, as though what they
really hungered for was ruin and death. It seemed to him that they
<i>were</i> ruined, and that even when they laughed and shouted and
smote each other on the back, the knowledge of their ruin was in
them.</p>

<p>They had squandered fabulous sums in meaningless streets and
bridges. They had torn down ancient buildings and erected new ones
large enough to take care of a city of half a million people. They had
levelled hills and bored through mountains, making magnificent tunnels
paved with double roadways and glittering with shining tiles--tunnels
which leaped out on the other side into Arcadian wilderness. They had
flung away the earnings of a lifetime, and mortgaged those of a
generation to come. They had ruined their city, and in doing so had
ruined themselves, their children, and their children's children.</p>

<p>Already the town had passed from their possession. They no longer
owned it. It was mortgaged under a debt of fifty million dollars, owned
by bonding companies in the North. The very streets they walked on had
been sold beneath their feet. They signed their names to papers calling
for the payment of fabulous sums, and resold their land the next day to
other madmen who signed away their lives with the same careless
magnificence. On paper, their profits were enormous, but their "boom"
was already over and they would not see it. They were staggering
beneath obligations to pay which none of them could meet--and still
they bought.</p>

<p>And when they had exhausted all their possibilities of ruin and
extravagance that the town could offer, they had rushed out into the
wilderness, into the lyrical immensities of wild earth where there was
land enough for all men living, and they had staked off little plots
and wedges in the hills as one might try to stake a picket fence out in
the middle of the ocean. They had given fancy names to all these
foolish enterprises--"Wild Boulders"--"Shady Acres"--"Eagle's Crest".
They had set prices on these sites of forest, field, and tangled
undergrowth that might have bought a mountain, and made charts and
drawings showing populous communities of shops, houses, streets, roads,
and clubs in regions where there was no road, no street, no house, and
which could not be reached in any way save by a band of resolute
pioneers armed with axes. These places were to be transformed into
idyllic colonies for artists and writers and critics; and there were
colonies as well for preachers, doctors, actors, dancers, golf players,
and retired locomotive engineers. There were colonies for everyone,
and, what is more, they sold the lots--to one another!</p>

<p>But under all this flash and play of great endeavour, the paucity of
their designs and the starved meagreness of their lives were already
apparent. The better life which they talked about resolved itself into
a few sterile and baffled gestures. All they really did for themselves
was to build uglier and more expensive homes, and buy new cars, and
join a country club. And they did all this with a frenzied haste,
because--it seemed to George--they were looking for food to feed their
hunger and had not found it.</p>

<p>As he stood upon the hill and looked out on the scene that spread
below him in the gathering darkness, with its pattern of lights to mark
the streets and the creeping pin-pricks of the thronging traffic, he
remembered the barren night-time streets of the town he had known so
well in his boyhood. Their dreary and unpeopled desolation had burned
its acid print upon his memory. Bare and deserted by ten o'clock at
night, those streets had been an aching monotony, a weariness of hard
lights and empty pavements, a frozen torpor broken only occasionally by
the footfalls of some prowler--some desperate, famished, lonely man who
hoped past hope and past belief for some haven of comfort, warmth, and
love there in the wilderness, for the sudden opening of a magic door
into some secret, rich, and more abundant life. There had been many
such, but they had never found what they were searching for. They had
been dying in the darkness--without a goal, a certain purpose, or a
door.</p>

<p>And that, it seemed to George, was the way the thing had come. That
was the way it had happened. Yes, it was there--on many a night long
past and wearily accomplished, in ten thousand little towns and in ten
million barren streets where all the passion, hope, and hunger of the
famished men beat like a great pulse through the fields of darkness--it
was there and nowhere else that all this madness had been brewed.</p>

<p>As he remembered the bleak, deserted streets of night which he had
known here fifteen years before, he thought again of Judge Rumford
Bland, whose solitary figure ranging restlessly through the sleeping
town had been so familiar to him and had struck such terror in his
heart. Perhaps he was the key to this whole tragedy. Perhaps Rumford
Bland had sought his life in darkness not because of something evil in
him--though certainly there was evil there--but because of something
good that had not died. Something in the man had always fought against
the dullness of provincial life, against is predudice, its caution, its
smugness, its sterility, and its lack of joy. He had looked for
something better in the night, for a place of warmth and fellowship, a
moment of dark mystery, the thrill of imminent and unknown adventure,
the excitement of the hunt, pursuit, perhaps the capture, and then the
fulfilment of desire. Was it possible that in the blind man whose whole
life had become such a miracle of open shamelessness, there had once
been a warmth and an energy that had sought for an enhancement of the
town's cold values, and for a joy and a beauty that were not there, but
that lived in himself alone? Could that be what had wrecked him? Was he
one of the lost men--lost, really, only because the town itself was
lost, because his gifts had been rejected, his energies unused, the
shoulder of his strength finding no work to bend to--because what he
had had to give of hope, intelligence, curiosity, and warmth had found
no place there, and so were lost?</p>

<p>Yes, the same thing that explained the plight the town had come to
might also explain Judge Rumford Bland. What was it he had said on the
train: "Do you think you can 'go home again?" And: "Don't forget I
tried to warn you." Was this, then, what he had meant? If so, George
understood him now.</p>

<p>Around them in the cemetery as George thought these things and spoke
of them, the air brooded with a lazy, drowsy warmth. There was the last
evening cry of robins, and the thrumming bullet noises in undergrowth
and leaf, and broken sounds from far away--a voice in the wind, a boy's
shout, the barking of a dog, the tinkle of a cowbell. There was the
fragrance of intoxicating odours--the resinous smell of pine, and the
smells of grass and warm sweet clover. All this was just as it had
always been. But the town of his childhood, with its quiet streets and
the old houses which had been almost obscured below the leafy spread of
trees, was changed past recognition, scarred now with hard patches of
bright concrete and raw dumps of new construction. It looked like a
battlefield, cratered and shell torn with savage explosions of brick,
cement, and harsh new stucco-And in the interspaces only the embowered
remnants of the old and pleasant town remained--timid, retreating,
overwhelmed--to remind one of the liquid leather shuffle in the quiet
streets at noon when the men came home to lunch, and of laughter and
low voices in the leafy rustle of the night. For this was lost!</p>

<p>An old and tragic light was shining faintly on the time-enchanted
hills. George thought of Mrs. Delia Flood, and what she had said of
Aunt Maw's hope that some day he'd come home again to stay.. And as he
stood there with Margaret quietly by his side the old and tragic light
of fading day shone faintly on their faces, and all at once it seemed
to him that they were fixed there like a prophecy with the hills and
river all round them, and that there was something lost, intolerable,
foretold and come to pass, something like old time and destiny--some
magic that he could not say.</p>

<p>Down by the river's edge, in darkness now, he heard the bell, the
whistle, and the pounding wheel of the night express coming into town,
there to pause for half an hour and then resume its northward journey.
It swept away from them, leaving the lonely thunder of its echoes in
the hills and the flame-flare of its open firebox for a moment, and
then just heavy wheels and rumbling cars as the great train pounded on
the rails across the river--and, finally, nothing but the silence it
had left behind. Then, farther off and almost lost in the traffic of
the town, he heard again and for the last time its wailing cry, and it
brought to him once more, as it had done for ever in his childhood, its
wild and secret exultation, its pain of going, and its triumphant
promise of morning, new lands, and a shining city. And something in his
heart was saying, like a demon's whisper that spoke of flight and
darkness: "Soon! Soon! Soon!"</p>

<p>Then they got in the car and drove rapidly away from the great hill
of the dead, the woman towards the certitude of lights, the people, and
the town; the man towards the train, the city, and the unknown
future.</p>

<h2><a name="book2"></a>BOOK II - THE WORLD THAT JACK BUILT</h2>

<p><i>Back in New York the autumn term at the School for Utility
cultures had begun, and George Webber took up again the old routine of
academic chores. He hated teaching worse than ever, and found that even
in his classes he was thinking about his new book and looking forward
eagerly to his free hours when he could work upon it. It was hardly
more than just begun, but for some reason the writing was going well,
and George knew from past experience that he'd better take advantage of
every moment while the frenzy of creation was upon him. He felt, too,
almost desperately, that he ought to get as much of the new book
written as he could before the first was published. That event, at once
so desired and dreaded, now loomed before him imminently. He hoped the
critics would be kind, or at least would treat his novel with respect.
Fox Edwards said it ought to have a good critical reception, but that
you couldn't tell anything about sales: better not think too much about
it.</i></p>

<p><i>George was seeing Esther Jack every day, just as always, but in
his excitement over the approaching publication of Home to Our
Mountains and his feverish absorption in the new writing he was doing,
she no longer occupied the forefront of his thoughts and feelings. She
was aware of this and resented it, as women always do. Perhaps that's
why she invited him to the party, believing that in such a setting she
would seem more desirable to him and that thus she could recapture the
major share of his attention. At any rate, she did invite him. It was
to be an elaborate affair. Her family and all her richest and most
brilliant friends were to be there, and she begged him to come.</i></p>

<p><i>He refused. He told her he had his work to do. He said he had his
world and she had hers, and the two could never be the same. He
reminded her of their compromise. He repeated that he did not want to
belong to her world, that he had seen enough of it already, and that if
she insisted on trying to absorb him in her life she was going to
destroy the foundation on which their whole relationship had rested
since he had come back to her.</i></p>

<p><i>But she kept after him and brushed his arguments aside.
"Sometimes you sound just like a fool, George!" she said impatiently.
"Once you get an idea in your head, you cling to it in the face of
reason itself Really, you ought to go out more. You spend too much time
cooped up here in your rooms," she said. "It's unhealthy! And how can
you expect to be a writer if you don't take part in the life round you?
I know what I'm talking about," she said, her face flushed with eager
seriousness. "And, besides, what has all this nonsense about your world
and my world got to do with us? Words, words, words! Stop being silly,
and listen to me. I don't ask much of you. Do as I say this once, just
to please me."</i></p>

<p><i>In the end she beat him down and he yielded. "All right," he
muttered at last, defeated, without enthusiasm. "I'll go."</i></p>

<p><i>So September slid into October, and now the day of the great
party had dawned. Later, as George looked back upon it, the date took
on an ominous significance, for the brilliant party was staged exactly
a week before the thunderous crash in the Stock Market which marked the
end of an era.</i></p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="chapter2-10"></a>10. Jack at Morn</h2>

<p>At seven twenty-eight Mr. Frederic Jack awoke and began to come
alive with all his might. He sat up and yawned strongly, stretching his
arms and at the same time bending his slumber-swollen face into the
plump muscle-hammock of his right shoulder, a movement coy and
cuddlesome. "Eee-a-a-a-ach!" He stretched deliciously out of thick,
rubbery sleep, and for a moment he sat heavily upright rubbing at his
eyes with the clenched backs of his fingers. Then he flung off the
covers with one determined motion and swung to the floor. His toes
groped blindly in soft grey carpet stuff, smooth as felt, for his
heelless slippers of red Russian leather. These found and slipped into,
he padded noiselessly across the carpet to the window and stood,
yawning and stretching again, as he looked out with sleepy satisfaction
at a fine, crisp morning. Instantly he knew that it was October 17th,
1929, and the day of the party. Mr. Jack liked parties. Nine floors
below him the cross street lay gulched in steep morning shadow, bluish,
barren, cleanly ready for the day. A truck roared past with a solid
rattling heaviness. An ash-can was banged on the pavement with an
abrupt slamming racket. Upon the pavement a little figure of a man,
foreshortened from above and covered by its drab cone of grey, bobbed
swiftly along, turned the corner into Park Avenue, and was gone,
heading southward towards work.</p>

<p>Below Mr. Frederick Jack the cross street was a narrow bluish lane
between sheer cliffs of solid masonry, but to the west the morning
sunlight, golden, young, immensely strong and delicate, cut with
sculptured sharpness at the walls of towering buildings. It shone with
an unearthly rose-golden glow upon the upper tiers and summits of
soaring structures whose lower depths were still sunk in shadow. It
rested without violence or heat upon retreating pyramids of steel and
stone, fumed at their peaks with fading wisps of smoke. It was
reflected with dazzling brilliance from the panes of innumerable lofty
windows, and it made the wall surfaces of harsh white-yellow brick look
soft and warm, the colour of rose petals.</p>

<p>Among the man-made peaks that stood silhouetted against the sky in
this early sun were great hotels and clubs and office buildings bare of
life. Mr. Jack could look straight into high office suites ready for
their work: the morning light shaped patterns out of pale-hued desks
and swivel-chairs of maple, and it burnished flimsy partition woods and
thick glazed doors. The offices stood silent, empty, sterile, but they
also seemed to have a kind of lonely expectation of the life that soon
would well up swiftly from the streets to fill and use them. In the
eerie light, with the cross street still bare of traffic and the office
buildings empty, suddenly it seemed to Mr. Jack as if all life had been
driven or extinguished from the city and as if those soaring obelisks
were all that remained of a civilization that had been fabulous and
legendary.</p>

<p>With a shrug of impatience he shook off the moment's aberration and
peered down into the street again. It was empty as before, but already
along Park Avenue the bright-hued cabs were drilling past the
intersection like beetles in flight, most of them headed downtown in
the direction of Grand Central Station. And everywhere, through that
shining, living light, he could sense the slow-mounting roar of another
furious day beginning. He stood there by his window, a man-mite poised
high in the air upon a shelf of masonry, the miracle of God, a plump
atom of triumphant man's flesh, founded upon a rock of luxury at the
centre of the earth's densest web--but it was as the Prince of Atoms
that he stood there and surveyed the scene, for he had bought the
privileges of space, silence, light, and steel-walled security out of
chaos with the ransom of an emperor, and he exulted in the price he
paid for them. This grain of living dust had seen the countless insane
accidents of shape and movement that daily passed the little window of
his eye, but he felt no doubt or fear. He was not appalled.</p>

<p>Another man, looking out upon the city in its early-morning
nakedness, might have thought its forms inhuman, monstrous, and
Assyrian in their insolence. But not Mr. Frederick Jack. Indeed, if all
those towers had been the monuments of his own special triumph, his
pride and confidence and sense of ownership could hardly have been
greater than they were. "My city," he thought. "Mine." It filled his
heart with certitude and joy because he had learned, like many other
men, to see, to marvel, to accept, and not to ask disturbing questions.
In that arrogant boast of steel and stone he saw a permanence surviving
every danger, an answer, crushing and conclusive, to every doubt.</p>

<p>He liked what was solid, rich, and spacious, made to last. He liked
the feeling of security and power that great buildings gave him. He
liked especially the thick walls and floors of this apartment house.
The boards neither creaked nor sagged when he walked across them; they
were as solid as if they had been hewn in one single block from the
heart of a gigantic oak. All this, he felt, was as it should be.</p>

<p>He was a man who liked order in everything. The rising tide of
traffic which now began to stream below him in the streets was
therefore pleasing to him. Even in the thrust and jostle of the crowd
his soul rejoiced, for he saw order everywhere. It was order that made
the millions swarm at morning to their work in little cells, and swarm
again at evening from their work to other little cells. It was an order
as inevitable as the seasons, and in it Mr. Jack read the same harmony
and permanence which he saw in the entire visible universe round
him.</p>

<p>Mr. Jack turned and glanced about his room. It was a spacious
chamber, twenty feet each way and twelve feet high, and in these noble
proportions was written quietly a message of luxurious wellbeing and
assurance. In the exact centre of the wall that faced the door stood
his bed, a chaste four-poster of the Revolutionary period, and beside
it a little table holding a small clock, a few books, and a lamp. In
the centre of another wall was an antique chest of drawers, and
tastefully arranged about the room were a gate-legged table, with a row
of books and the latest magazines upon it, two fine old Windsor chairs,
and a comfortable, well-padded east chair. Several charming French
prints hung on the walls. On the floor was a thick and heavy carpet of
dull grey. These were all the furnishings. The total effect was one of
modest and almost austere simplicity, subtly combined with a sense of
spaciousness, wealth, and power.</p>

<p>The owner of this room read its message with pleasure, and turned
once more to the open window. With fingers pressed against his swelling
breast, he breathed in a deep draught of the fresh, living air of
morning. It was laden with the thrilling compost of the city, a
fragrance delicately blended of many things. There was, strangely, the
smell of earth, moist and somehow flowerful, tinged faintly with the
salt reek of tidal waters and the fresh river smell, rank and a little
rotten, and spiced among these odours was the sultry aroma of strong
boiling coffee. This incense-laden air carried a tonic threat of
conflict and of danger, and a leaping, winelike prophecy of power,
wealth, and love. Mr. Jack breathed in this vital ether slowly, with
heady joy, sensing again the unknown menace and delight it always
brought to him.</p>

<p>All at once a trembling, faint and instant, passed in the earth
below him. He paused, frowning, and an old unquiet feeling to which he
could not give a name stirred in his heart. He did not like things to
shake and tremble. When he had first come here to live and had awaked
at morning thinking he felt a slight vibration in the massive walls
around him, a tremor so brief and distant that he could not be certain
of it, he had asked a few questions of the doorman who stood at the
Park Avenue entrance of the building. The man told him that the great
apartment house had been built across two depths of railway tunnels,
and that all Mr. Jack had felt was the vibration that came from the
passing of a train deep in the bowels of the earth. The man assured him
that it was all quite safe, that the very trembling in the walls, in
fact, was just another proof of safety.</p>

<p>Still, Mr. Jack did not like it. The news disturbed him vaguely. He
would have liked it better if the building had been anchored upon the
solid rock. So now, as he felt the slight tremor in the walls once
more, he paused, frowned, and waited till it stopped. Then he
smiled.</p>

<p>"Great trains pass under me," he thought. "Morning, bright morning,
and still they come--all the boys who have dreamed dreams in the little
towns. They come for ever to the city. Yes, even now they pass below
me, wild with joy, mad with hope, drunk with their thoughts of victory.
For what? For what? Glory, huge profits, and a girl! All of them come
looking for the same magic wand. Power. Power. Power."</p>

<p>Thoroughly awake now, Mr. Jack closed the window and moved briskly
across his chamber to the bathroom.' He liked lavish plumbing, thick
with creamy porcelain and polished silver fixtures. For a moment he
stood before the deep wash-basin with bared lips, looking at himself in
the mirror, and regarding with considerable satisfaction the health and
soundness of his strong front teeth. Then he brushed them earnestly
with stiff, hard bristles and two inches of firm, thick paste, turning
his head from side to side round the brush and glaring at his image in
the glass until he foamed agreeably at the mouth with a lather that
tasted of fresh mint. This done, he spat it out and let running water
wash it down the drain, and then he rinsed his mouth and throat with
gently biting antiseptic.</p>

<p>He liked the tidy, crowded array of lotions, cream, unguents,
bottles, tubes, jars, brushes, and shaving implements that covered the
shelf of thick blue glass above the basin. He lathered his face heavily
with a large silver-handled shaving-brush, rubbing the lather in with
firm finger-tips, brushing and stroking till his jaws were covered with
a smooth, thick layer of warm shaving cream. Then he took the razor in
his hand and opened it. He used a straight razor, and he always kept it
in excellent condition. At the crucial moment, just before the first
long downward stroke, he flourished slightly forward with his plump
arms and shoulders, raising the glittering blade aloft in one firm
hand, his legs widened stockily, crouching gently at the knees, his
lathered face craned carefully to one side and upwards, and his eyes
rolled towards the ceiling, as if he were getting braced and ready
beneath a heavy burden. Then, holding one cheek delicately between two
arched fingers, he advanced deliberately upon it with the gleaming
blade. He grunted gently, with satisfaction, at the termination of the
stroke. The blade had mown smoothly, leaving a perfect swath of pink,
clean flesh across his face from cheek to jowl. He exulted in the
slight tug and rasping pull of wiry stubble against the deadly
sharpness of the razor, and in the relentless sweep and triumph of the
steel.</p>

<p>And while he shaved Mr. Jack occupied his mind with pleasant
thoughts of all the good things in his life.</p>

<p>He thought about his clothes. Elegant in dress, always excellently
correct, he wore fresh garments every day. No cotton touched him. He
bought underclothes of the finest silk, and he had more than forty
suits from London. Every morning he examined his wardrobe studiously,
choosing with care and with a good eye for harmony the shoes, socks,
shirt, and necktie he would wear, and before he selected a suit he was
sometimes lost in thought for several minutes. He loved to open wide
the door of his great closet and see his suits hanging there in rows in
all their groomed and regimented elegance. He liked the strong, clean
smell of honest cloth, and in those forty several shapes and colours he
saw as many pleasing reflections and variations of his own character.
They filled him, as did everything about him, with a sense of morning
confidence, joy, and vigour.</p>

<p>For breakfast he would have orange juice, two leghorn eggs, soft
boiled, two slices of crisp, thin toast, and tasty little segments of
pink Praguer ham, which looked so pretty on fresh parsley sprigs. And
he would have coffee, strong coffee, cup after cup of it. So fortified,
he would face the world with cheerful strength, ready for whatever
chance the day might bring him.</p>

<p>The smell of earth which he had caught in the air this morning was
good, and the remembrance of it laid a soothing unction on his soul.
Although city-bred, Mr. Jack was as sensitive to the charms of Mother
Earth as any man alive. He liked the cultivated forms of nature--the
swarded lawns of great estates, gay regiments of brilliant garden
flowers, and rich masses of clumped shrubbery. All these things
delighted him. The call of the simple life had grown stronger every
year, and he had built a big country house in Westchester County.</p>

<p>He liked the more expensive forms of sport. He would frequently go
out in the country to play golf, and he loved bright sunlight on the
rich velvet of the greens and the new-mown smell of fairways. And
afterwards, when he had stood below the bracing drive of the shower and
had felt the sweat of competition wash cleanly from his well-set form,
he liked to loaf upon the cool veranda of the club and talk about his
score, joke and laugh, pay or collect his bets, and drink good Scotch
with other men of note. And he liked to watch his country's flag flap
languidly upon the tall white pole because it looked so pretty
there.</p>

<p>Mr. Jack also liked the ruder and more natural forms of beauty. He
liked to see tall grasses billowing on a hillside, and he liked old
shaded roads that wound away to quietness from driven glares of speed
and concrete. He was touched by the cosmic sadness of leafy orange,
gold, and russet brown in mid-October, and he had seen the evening
light upon the old red of a mill and felt deep stillness in his heart
("all--could anyone believe it?--within thirty miles of New York
City"). On those occasions the life of the metropolis had seemed very
far away. And often he had paused to pluck a flower or stand beside a
brook in thought. But after sighing with regret as, among such scenes,
he thought of the haste and folly of man's life, Mr. Jack always came
back to the city. For life was real, and life was earnest, and Mr. Jack
was a business man.</p>

<p>He was a business man, so of course he liked to gamble. What is
business but a gamble? Will prices go up or down? Will Congress do this
or that? Will there be war in some far corner of the earth, and a
shortage of some essential raw material? What will the ladies wear next
year--big hats or little ones, long dresses or short? You make your
guess and back it with your money, and if you don't guess right often
enough you don't remain a business man. So Mr. Jack liked to gamble,
and he gambled like the business man he was. He gambled every day upon
the price of stocks. And at night he often gambled at his club. It was
no piker's game he played. He never turned a hair about a thousand
dollars. Large sums did not appal him. He was not frightened by Amount
and Number. That is why he liked great crowds. That is why the beetling
cliffs of immense and cruel architectures lapped his soul in strong
security. When he saw a ninety-storey building he was not one to fall
down grovelling in the dust, and beat a maddened brain with fists, and
cry out: "Woe! 0 woe is me!" No. Every cloud-lost spire of masonry was
a talisman of power, a monument to the everlasting empire of American
business. It made him feel good. For that empire was his faith, his
fortune, and his life. He had a fixed place in it.</p>

<p>Yet his neck was not stiff, nor his eye hard. Neither was he very
proud. For he had seen the men who lean upon their sills at evening,
and those who swarm from rat holes in the ground, and often he had
wondered what their lives were like.</p>

<p>Mr. Jack finished shaving and rinsed his glowing face, first with
hot water, then with cold. He dried it with a fresh towel, and he
rubbed it carefully with a fragrant, gently stinging lotion. This done,
he stood for a moment, satisfied, regarding his image, softly caressing
the velvet texture of dose-shaved, ruddy cheeks with stroking
fingertips. Then he turned briskly away, ready for his bath.</p>

<p>He liked the morning plunge in his great sunken tub, the sensual
warmth of sudsy water, and the sharp, aromatic cleanness of the bath
salts. He had an eye for aesthetic values, too, and he liked to loll
back in the tub and watch the dance of water spangles in their magic
shift and play upon the creamy ceiling. Most of all, he liked to come
up pink and dripping, streaked liberally with tarry-scented soap, and
then he loved the stinging drive and shock of needled spray, the sense
of hardihood and bracing conflict, and he liked the glow of abundant
health as he stepped forth, draining down upon a thick cork mat, and
vigorously rubbed himself dry in the folds of a big, crashy bath
towel.</p>

<p>All this he now anticipated eagerly as he let fall with a full thud
the heavy silver-headed waste-pipe stopper. He turned the hot-water tap
on as far as it would go, and watched a moment as the tumbling water
began smokily to fill the tub with its thick boiling gurgle. Then,
scuffing the slippers from his feet, he rapidly stripped off his silk
pyjamas. He felt with pride the firm-swelling flexor muscle of his
upper arm, and observed with keen satisfaction the reflection in the
mirror of his plump, well-conditioned body. He was well-moulded and
solid-looking, with hardly a trace of unwholesome fat upon him--a
little undulance, perhaps, across the kidneys, a mere suggestion of a
bay about the waist, but not enough to cause concern, and far less than
he had seen on many men twenty years his junior. Content, deep and
glowing, filled him. He turned the water off and tested it with a
finger, which he jerked back with an exclamation of hurt surprise. In
his self-absorption he had forgotten the cold water, so now he turned
it on and waited while it seethed with tiny milky bubbles and sent
waves of trembling light across the hot blue surface of his bath. At
last he tried it with a cautious toe and found it tempered to his
liking. He shut the water off.</p>

<p>And now, stepping back a pace or two, he gripped the warm tiling of
the floor with his bare toes, straightened up with military smartness,
drew in a deep breath, and vigorously began his morning exercises. With
stiffened legs he bent strongly towards the floor, grunting as his
groping finger-tips just grazed the tiling. Then he swung into punctual
rhythms, counting: "One!--Two!--Three!--Four!" as his body moved. And
all the time while his arms beat their regular strokes through the air,
his thoughts continued to amble down the pleasant groove that his life
had worn for them.</p>

<p>To-night was the great party, and he liked the brilliant gaiety of
such gatherings. He was a wise man, too, who knew the world and the
city well, and, although kind, he was not one to miss the fun of a
little harmless byplay, the verbal thrust and parry of the clever ones,
or the baiting of young innocents by those who were wily at the game.
Something of the sort could usually be counted on when all kinds of
people were brought together at these affairs. It gave a spice and zest
to things. Some yokel, say, fresh from the rural districts, all hands
and legs and awkwardness, hooked and wriggling on a cruel and cunning
word--a woman's, preferably, because women were so swift and deft in
matters of this nature. But there were men as well whose skill was
great--pampered lap-dogs of rich houses, or feisty, nimble-witted
little she-men whose mincing tongues were always good for one or two
shrewd thrusts of poison in a hayseed's hide. There was something in
the face of a fresh-baited country boy as it darkened to a slow,
smouldering glow of shame, surprise, and anger and sought with clumsy
and inept words to retort upon the wasp which had stung it and winged
away--something so touching--that Mr. Jack, when he saw it, felt a
sense of almost paternal tenderness for the hapless victim, a
delightful sense of youth and innocence in himself. It was almost as if
he were revisiting his own youth.</p>

<p>But enough was enough. Mr. Jack was neither a cruel nor an
immoderate man. He liked the gay glitter of the night, the thrill and
fever of high stakes, and the swift excitements of new pleasures. He
liked the theatre and saw all the best plays, and the better, smarter,
wittier revues--the ones with sharp, satiric lines, good dancing, and
Gershwin music. He liked the shows his wife designed because she
designed them, he was proud of her, and he enjoyed those evenings of
ripe culture at the Guild. He also went to prize-fights in his evening
clothes, and once when he came home he had the red blood of a champion
on the white boiled bosom of his shirt. Few men could say as much.</p>

<p>He liked the social swim, and the presence of the better sort of
actors, artists, writers, and wealthy, cultivated Jews round his table.
He had a kind heart and a loyal nature. His purse was open to a friend
in need. He kept a lavish table and a royal cellar, and his family was
the apple of his eye.</p>

<p>But he also liked the long velvet backs of lovely women, and the
flash of jewellery about their necks. He liked women to be seductive,
bright with gold and diamonds to set off the brilliance of their
evening gowns. He liked women cut to fashion, with firm breasts, long
necks, slender legs, flat hips, and unsuspected depth and undulance. He
liked their faces pale, their hair of bronze-gold wire, their red
mouths thin, a little cruel, their eyes long, slanting, cat-grey, and
lidded carefully. He liked a frosted cocktail shaker in a lady's hands,
and he liked a voice hoarse-husky, city-wise, a trifle weary, ironic,
faintly insolent, that said:</p>

<p>"Well! What happened to you, darling? I thought that You would never
get here."</p>

<p>He liked all the things that men are fond of. All of them he had
enjoyed himself, each in its proper time and place, and he expected
everyone to act as well as he. But ripeness with Mr. Jack was
everything, and he always knew the time to stop. His ancient and
Hebraic spirit was tempered with a classic sense of moderation. He
prized the virtue of decorum highly. He knew the value of the middle
way.</p>

<p>He was not a man to wear his heart upon his overcoat, nor risk his
life on every corner, nor throw himself away upon a word, nor spend his
strength on the impulse of a moment's wild belief. This was such
madness as the Gentiles knew. But, this side idolatry and madness he
would go as far for friendship's sake as any man. He would go with a
friend up to the very edge of ruin and defeat, and he would even try to
hold him back. But once he saw a man was mad, and not to be persuaded
by calm judgment, he was done with him. He would leave him where he
was, although regretfully. Are matters helped if the whole crew drowns
together with a single drunken sailor? He thought not. He could put a
world of sincere meaning in the three words: "What a pity!"</p>

<p>Yes, Mr. Frederick Tack was kind and temperate. He had found life
pleasant, and had won from it the secret of wise living. And the secret
of wise living was founded in a graceful compromise, a tolerant
acceptance. If a man wanted to live in this world without getting his
pockets picked, he had better learn how to use his eyes and ears on
what was going on around him. But if he wanted to live in this world
without getting hit over the head, and without all the useless pain,
grief, terror, and bitterness that mortify human flesh, he had also
better learn how not to use his eyes and ears. This may sound
difficult, but it had not been so for Mr. Jack. Perhaps some great
inheritance of suffering, the long, dark ordeal of his race, had left
him, as a precious distillation, this gift of balanced understanding.
At any rate, he had not learned it, because it could not be taught: he
had been born with it.</p>

<p>Therefore, he was not a man to rip the sheets in darkness or beat
his knuckles raw against a wall. He would not madden furiously in the
envenomed passages of night, nor would he ever be carried smashed and
bloody from the stews. A woman's ways were no doubt hard to bear, but
love's bitter mystery had broken no bones for Mr. Jack, and, so far as
he was concerned, it could not murder sleep the way an injudicious
wiener schitzel could, or that young Gentile fool, drunk again,
probably, ringing the telephone at one a.m. to ask to speak to
Esther.</p>

<p>Mr. Jack's brow was darkened as he thought of it. He muttered
wordlessly. If fools are fools, let them be fools where their folly
will not injure or impede the slumbers of a serious man.</p>

<p>Yes, Men could rob, lie, murder, swindle, trick, and cheat--the
whole world knew as much. And women--well, they were women, and there
was no help for that. Mr. Jack had also known something of the pain and
folly that twist the indignant soul of youth--it was too bad, of
course, too bad. But regardless of all this, the day was day and men
must work, the night was night and men must sleep, and it was, he felt,
<i>intolerable</i>----</p>

<p>"One!"</p>

<p>Red of face, he bent stiffly, with a grunt, until his fingers grazed
the rich cream tiling of the bathroom floor.</p>

<p>--<i>intolerable!</i>----</p>

<p>"Two!"</p>

<p>He straightened sharply, his hands at his sides.</p>

<p>--<i>that a man with serious work to do</i>----</p>

<p>"Three!"</p>

<p>His arms shot up to full stretching height above his head, and came
swiftly down again until he held clenched fists against his breast.</p>

<p>--<i>should be pulled out of his bed in the middle of the night by a
crazy young fool!</i>----</p>

<p>"Four!"</p>

<p>His closed fists shot outwards in a strong driving movement, and
came back to his sides again.</p>

<p>--<i>It was intolerable, and, by God, be had half a mind to tell her
so!</i></p>

<p>His exercises ended, Mr. Jack stepped carefully into the luxurious
sunken tub and settled his body slowly in its crystal-blue depths. A
sigh, long, lingering, full of pleasure, expired upon his lips.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="chapter2-11"></a>11. Mrs. Jack Awake</h2>

<p>Mrs. Jack awoke at eight oclock. She awoke like a child, completely
alert and alive, instantly awake all over and with all sleep shaken
clearly from her mind and senses the moment that she opened her eyes.
It had been so with her all her life. For a moment she lay flat on her
back and stared straight up at the ceiling.</p>

<p>Then with a vigorous and jubilant movement she flung the covers off
of her small and opulent body, which was clothed with a long,
sleeveless garment of thin yellow silk. She bent her knees briskly,
drew her feet from beneath the covers, and straightened out flat again.
She surveyed her small feet with a look of wonder and delight. The
sight of her toes in perfect and solid alignment and of their healthy,
shining nails filled her with pleasure.</p>

<p>With the same expression of childlike wonder and vanity she slowly
lifted her left arm and began to revolve the hand deliberately before
her fascinated eyes. She observed with tender concentration how the
small and delicate wrist obeyed each command of her will, and she gazed
raptly at the graceful, winglike movement of the hand and at the beauty
and firm competence that were legible in its brown, narrow back and in
the shapely fingers.. Then she lifted the other arm as well, and turned
both hands upon their wrists, still gazing at them with a tender
concentration of delight.</p>

<p>"What magic!" she thought. "What magic and strength are in them!
God, how beautiful they are, and what things they can do! The design
for everything I undertake comes out of me in the most wonderful and
exciting way. It is all distilled and brewed inside of me--and yet
nobody ever asks me how it happens! First, it is all one piece--like
something solid in the head," she thought comically, now wrinkling her
forehead with an almost animal-like expression of bewildered
difficulty. "Then it all breaks up into little particles, and somehow
arranges itself, and then it starts to <i>move!</i>" she thought
triumphantly. "First I can feel it coming down along my neck and
shoulders, and then it is moving up across my legs and belly, then it
meets and joins together like a star. Then it flows out into my arms
until it reaches down into my finger-tips--and then the hand just does
what I want it to. It makes a line, and everything I want is in that
line. It puts a fold into a piece of cloth, and no one else on earth
could put it in that way, or make it look the same. It gives a turn to
the spoon, a prod to the fork, a dash of pepper when I cook for
George," she thought, "and there's a dish the finest chef on earth
could never equal--because it's got me in it, heart and soul and all my
love," she thought with triumphant joy. "Yes! And everything I've ever
done has been the same--always the clear design, the line of life,
running like a thread of gold all through me back to the time I was a
child."</p>

<p>Now, having surveyed her deft and beautiful hands, she began
deliberately to inspect her other members. Craning her head downwards,
she examined the full outlines of her breasts, and the smooth contours
of her stomach, thighs, and legs. She stretched forth her hands and
touched them with approval. Then she put her hands down at her sides
again and lay motionless, toes evenly in line, limbs straight, head
front, eyes staring gravely at the ceiling--a little figure stretched
out like a queen for burial, yet still warm, still palpable, immensely
calm and beautiful, as she thought:</p>

<p>"These are my hands and these are my fingers, these are my legs and
hips, these are my fine feet and my perfect toes--this is my body."</p>

<p>And suddenly, as if the inventory of these possessions filled her
with an immense joy and satisfaction, she sat up with a shining face
and placed her feet firmly on the floor. She wriggled into a pair of
slippers, stood up, thrust her arms out and brought the hands down
again behind her head, yawned, and then put on a yellow quilted
dressing-gown which had been lying across the foot of the bed.</p>

<p>Esther had a rosy, jolly, delicate face of noble beauty. It was
small, firm, and almost heart-shaped, and in its mobile features there
was a strange union of child and woman. The instant anyone met her for
the first time he felt: "This woman must look exactly the way she did
when she was a child. She can't have changed at all." Yet her face also
bore the markings of middle age. It was when she was talking to someone
and her whole countenance was lighted by a merry and eager animation
that the child's face was most clearly visible.</p>

<p>When she was at work, her face was likely to have the serious
concentration of a mature and expert craftsman engaged in an absorbing
and exacting labour, and it was at such time that she looked oldest. It
was then that one noticed the somewhat fatigued and minutely wrinkled
spaces round her eyes and some strands of grey that were beginning to
sprinkle her dark-brown hair.</p>

<p>Similarly, in repose, or when she was alone, her face was likely to
have a sombre, brooding depth. Its beauty then was profound and full of
mystery. She was three parts a Jewess, and in her contemplative moods
the ancient, dark, and sorrowful quality of her race seemed to take
complete possession of her. She would wrinkle her brow with a look of
perpelexity and grief, and in the cast of her features there would be a
fatal quality, as of something priceless that was lost and
irrecoverable. This look, which she did not wear often, had always
troubled George Webber when he saw it because it suggested some secret
knowledge buried deep within the woman whom he loved and whom he
believed he had come to know.</p>

<p>But the way she appeared most often, and the way people remembered
her best, was as a glowing, jolly, indomitably active and eager little
creature in whose delicate face the image of the child peered out with
joyfulness and immortal confidence. Then her apple-cheeks would glow
with health and freshness, and when she came into a room she filled it
with her loveliness and gave to everything about her the colour of
morning life and innocence.</p>

<p>So, too, when she went out on the streets, among the thrusting
throngs of desolate and sterile people, her face shone forth like a
deathless flower among their dead, grey flesh and dark, dead eyes. They
milled past her with their indistinguishable faces set in familiar
expressions of inept hardness, betraying cunning without an end, guile
without a purpose, cynical knowledge without faith or wisdom, yet even
among these hordes of the unburied dead some would halt suddenly in the
dreary fury of their existence and would stare at her with their
harassed and driven eyes. Her whole figure with its fertile curves,
opulent as the earth, belonged to an order of humanity so different
from that of their own starved barrenness that they gazed after her
like wretches trapped and damned in hell who, for one brief moment, had
been granted a vision of living and imperishable beauty.</p>

<p>As Mrs. Jack stood there beside her bed, her maidservant, Nora
Fogarty, knocked at the door and entered immediately, bearing a tray
with a tall silver coffee-pot, a small bowl of sugar, a cup, saucer,
and spoon, and the morning <i>Times</i>. The maid put the tray down on
a little table beside the bed, saying in a thick voice:</p>

<p>"Good maar-nin', Mrs. Jack."</p>

<p>"Oh, hello, Nora!" the woman answered, crying out in the eager and
surprised tone with which she usually responded to a greeting. "How are
you--hah!" she asked, as if she were really greatly concerned, but
immediately adding: "Isn't it going to be a nice day? Did you ever see
a more beautiful morning in your life?"</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>beautiful</i>, Mrs. Jack!" Nora answered. "Beautiful!"</p>

<p>The maid's voice had a respectful and almost unctuously reverential
tone of agreement as she answered, but there was in it an undernote of
something sly, furtive, and sullen, and Mrs. Jack looked at her swiftly
now and saw the maid's eyes, inflamed with drink and irrationally
choleric, staring back at her. Their rancour, however, seemed to be
directed not so much at her mistress as at the general family of the
earth. Or, if Nora's eyes did swelter with a glare of spite more
personal and direct, her resentment was blind and instinctive: it just
smouldered in her with an ugly truculence, and she did not know the
reason for it. Certainly it was not based on any feeling of class
inferiority, for she was Irish, and a papist to the bone, and where
social dignities were concerned she thought she knew on which side
condescension lay.</p>

<p>She had served Mrs. Jack and her family for more than twenty years,
and had grown slothful on their beauty, but in spite of a very
affectionate devotion and warmth of old Irish feeling she had never
doubted for a moment that they would ultimately go to hell, together
with other pagans and all alien heathen tribes whatever. Just the same,
she had done pretty well by herself among these prosperous infidels.
She had a "cushy" job, she always fell heir to the scarcely-worn
garments of Mrs. Jack and her sister Edith, and she saw to it that the
policeman who came to woo her several times a week should lack for
nothing in the way of food and drink to keep him contented and to
forestall any desire he might have to stray off and forage in other
pastures. Meanwhile, she had laid by several thousand dollars, and had
kept her sisters and nieces back in County Cork faithfully furnished
with a titillating chronicle (sprinkled with pious interjections of
regret and deprecation and appeals to the Virgin to watch over her and
guard her among such infidels) of high life in this rich New World that
had such pickings in it.</p>

<p>No--decidedly this truculent resentment which smouldered in her eyes
had nothing to do with caste. She had lived here for twenty years,
enjoying the generous favour of a very good, superior sort of heathen,
and growing used to almost all their sinful customs, but she had never
let herself forget where the true way and the true light was, nor her
hope that she would one day return into the more civilised and
Christian precincts of her own kind.</p>

<p>Neither did the grievance in the maid's hot eyes come from a sense
of poverty, the stubborn, silent anger of the poor against the rich,
the feeling of injustice that decent people like herself should have to
fetch and carry all their lives for idle, lazy wasters. She was not
feeling sorry for herself because she had to drudge with roughened
fingers all day long in order that this fine lady might smile rosily
and keep beautiful. Nora knew full well that there was no task in all
the household range of duties, whether of serving, mending, cooking,
cleaning, or repairing, which her mistress could not do far better and
with more dispatch than her.</p>

<p>She knew, too, that every day in the great city which roared all
about her own dull ears this other woman was going back and forth with
the energy of a dynamo, buying, ordering, fitting, cutting, and
designing--now on the scaffolds with the painters, beating them at
their own business in immense, draughty, and rather dismal rooms where
her' designs were wrought out into substance, now sitting cross-legged
among great bolts of cloth and plying a needle with a defter finger
than any on the flashing hands of the pallid tailors all about her, now
searching and prying indefatigably through a dozen gloomy little junk
shops until she unearthed triumphantly the exact small ornament which
she must have. She was always after her people, always pressing on,
formidably but with good humour, keeping the affair in hand and pushing
it to its conclusion in spite of the laziness, carelessness, vanity,
stupidity, indifference, and faithlessness of those with whom she had
to work--painters, actors, scene-shifters, bankers, union bosses,
electricians, tailors, costumers, producers, and directors. Upon this
whole motley and, for the most part, shabbily inept crew which carried
on the crazy and precarious affair known as "show business", she
enforced the structure, design, and incomparably rich colour of her own
life. Nora knew about all this.</p>

<p>The maid had also seen enough of the hard world in which her
mistress daily strove and conquered to convince herself that even if
she had had any of the immense talent and knowledge that her mistress
possessed, she did not have in all her lazy body as much energy,
resolution, and power as the other woman carried in the tip of her
little finger. And this awareness, so far from arousing any feeling of
inferiority in her, only contributed to her self-satisfaction, making
her feel that it was Mrs. Jack, not herself, who was really the working
woman, and that she--enjoying the same food, the same drink, the same
shelter, even the same clothing--would not swap places with her for
anything on earth.</p>

<p>Yes, the maid knew that she was fortunate and had no cause for
complaint; yet her grievance, ugly and perverse, glowered implacably in
her inflamed and mutinous eyes. And she could not have found a word or
reason for it. But as the two women faced each other no word was
needed. The reason for it was printed in their flesh, legible in
everything they did. It was not against Mrs. Jack's wealth, authority,
and position that the maid's rancour was directed, but against
something much more personal and indefinable--against the very tone and
quality of the other woman's life. For within the past year there had
come over the maid a distempered sense of failure and frustration, an
obscure but powerful feeling that her life had somehow gone awry and
was growing into sterile and fruitless age without ever having come to
any ripeness. She was baffled and tormented by a sense of having missed
something splendid and magnificent in life, without knowing at all what
it was. But whatever it was, her mistress seemed marvellously somehow
to have found it and enjoyed it to the full, and this obvious fact,
which she could plainly see but could not define, goaded her almost
past endurance.</p>

<p>Both women were about the same age, and so nearly the same size that
the maid could wear any of her mistress's garments without alteration.
But if they had been creatures from separate planetary systems, if each
had been formed by a completely different protoplasm, the contrast
between them could not have been more extreme.</p>

<p>Nora was not an ill-favoured woman. She had a mass of fairly
abundant black hair which she brushed over to the side. Her face, had
it not been for the distempered look which drink and her own baffled
fury had now given it, would have been pleasant and attractive. There
was warmth in it, but there was also a trace of that wild fierceness
which belongs to something lawless in nature, at once coarse and
delicate, murderous, tender, and savagely ebullient. She still had a
trim figure, which wore neatly the well-cut skirt of rough green plaid
which her mistress had given her (for, because of her long service, she
was recognised as a kind of unofficial captain to the other maids and
was usually not required to wear maid's uniform). But where the figure
of the mistress was small of bone and fine of line and yet at the same
time lavish and seductive, the figure of the maid was, by contrast,
almost thick and clumsy-looking. It was the figure of a woman no longer
young, fresh, and fertile, but already heavied, thickened, dried, and
hardened by the shock, the wear, the weight, and the slow accumulation
of intolerable days and merciless years, which take from people
everything, and from which there is no escape.</p>

<p>No--no escape, except for <i>her</i>, the maid was thinking
bitterly, with a dull feeling of inarticulate outrage, and for
<i>her</i>, for <i>her</i>, there was never anything but triumph. For
<i>her</i> the years brought nothing but a constantly growing success.
And why? Why?</p>

<p>It was here, upon this question, that her spirit halted like a wild
beast baffled by a sheer and solid blank of wall. Had they not both
breathed the same air, eaten the same food, been clothed by the same
garments, and sheltered by the same roof? Had she not had as much--and
as good--of everything as her mistress? Yes--if anything she had had
the better of it, for she would <i>not</i> drive <i>herself</i> from
morning to night, she thought with contemptuous bitterness, the way her
mistress did.</p>

<p>Yet here she stood, baffled and confused, glowering sullenly into
the shining face of the other woman's glorious success--and she saw it,
she knew it, she felt its outrage, but she had no word to voice her
sense of an intolerable wrong. All she knew was that she had been
stiffened and thickened by the same years that had given the other
woman added grace and suppleness, that her skin had been dried and
sallowed by the same lights and weathers that had added lustre to the
radiant beauty of the other, and that even now her spirit was soured by
her knowledge of ruin and defeat while in the other woman there coursed
for ever an exquisite music of power and control, of health and
joy.</p>

<p>Yes, she saw it plainly enough. The comparison was cruelly and
terribly true, past the last atom of hope and disbelief. And as she
stood there before her mistress with the weary distemper in her eyes,
enforcing by a stern compulsion the qualities of obedience and respect
into her voice, she saw, too, that the other woman read the secret of
her envy and frustration, and that she pitied her because of it. And
for this Nora's soul was filled with hatred, because pity seemed to her
the final and intolerable indignity.</p>

<p>In fact, although the kind and jolly look on Mrs. Jack's lovely face
had not changed a bit since she had greeted the maid, her eye had
observed instantly all the signs of the unwholesome fury that was
raging in the woman, and with a strong emotion of pity, wonder, and
regret she was thinking:</p>

<p>"She's been at it again! This is the third time in a week that she's
been drinking. I wonder what it is--I wonder what it is that happens to
that kind of person."</p>

<p>Mrs. Jack did not know clearly what she meant by "that kind of
person", but she felt momentarily the detached curiosity that a
powerful, rich, and decisive character may feel when he pauses for a
moment from the brilliant exercise of a talent that has crowned his
life with triumphant ease and success almost every step of the way, and
notes suddenly, and with surprise, that most of the other people in the
world are fumbling blindly and wretchedly about, eking out from day to
day the flabby substance of grey lives. She realised with regret that
such people are so utterly lacking in any individual distinction that
each seems to be a small particle of some immense and vicious
life-stuff rather than a living creature who is able to feel and to
inspire love, beauty, joy, passion, pain, and death. With a sense of
sudden discovery the mistress was feeling this as she looked at the
servant who had lived with her familiarly for almost twenty years, and
now for the first time she reflected on the kind of life the other
woman might have had.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she kept thinking. "What's gone wrong with her? She
never used to be this way. It has all happened within the last year.
And Nora used to be so pretty, too!" she thought, startled by the
memory. "Why, when she first came to us she was really a very handsome
girl. Isn't it a shame," she thought indignantly, "that she should let
herself go to seed like this--a girl who's had the chances that she's
had! I wonder why she never married. She used to have half a dozen of
those big policemen on the string, and now there's only one who still
comes faithfully. They were all mad about her, and she could have had
her pick of them!"</p>

<p>All at once, as she was looking at the servant with kindly interest,
the woman's breath, foul with a stale whisky stench, was blown upon
her, and she got suddenly a rank body smell, strong, hairy, female, and
unwashed. She frowned with revulsion, and her face began to burn with a
glow of shame, embarrassment, and acute distaste.</p>

<p>"God, but she stinks!" she thought, with a feeling of horror and
disgust. "You could cut the smell round her with an axe! The nasty
things!" she thought, now including all the servants in her indictment.
"I'll bet they never wash--and here they are all day long with nothing
to do, and they could at least keep clean! My God! You'd think these
people would be so glad to be here in this lovely place with the fine
life we've made for them that they would be a little proud of it and
try to show that they appreciate it! But no! They're just not good
enough!" she thought scornfully, and for a moment her fine mouth was
disfigured at one corner by an ugly expression.</p>

<p>It was an expression which had in it not only contempt and scorn,
but also something almost racial--a quality of arrogance that was too
bold and naked, as if it were eager to assert its own superiority. This
ugly look rested only for a second, and almost imperceptibly, about the
edges of her mouth, and it did not sit well on her lovely face. Then it
was gone. But the maid had seen it, and that swift look, with all its
implications, had stung and whipped her tortured spirit to a
frenzy.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, me fine lady!" she was thinking. "It's too good fer the
likes of us ye are, ain't it? Oh me, yes, an' we're very grand, ain't
we? What wit' our fine clothes an' our evenin' gowns an' our forty
pairs of hand-made shoes! Jesus, now! Ye'd think she was some kind of
centipede to see the different pairs of shoes she's got! An' our silk
petticoats an' step-ins that we have made in Paris, now! Yes! That
makes us very fine, don't it? It's not as if we ever did a little
private monkey-business on the side, like ordinary people, is it? Oh,
me, no! We are gathered together wit' a friend fer a little elegant an'
high-class entertainment durin' the course of the evenin'! But if it's
some poor girl wit'out an extra pair of drawers to her name, it's
different, now! It's: 'Oh! you nasty thing! I'm disgusted wit'
you!'...Yes! An' there's many a fine lady livin' on Park Avenoo right
now who's no better, if the truth was told! That I know! So just take
care, me lady, not to give yerself too many airs!" she thought with
rancorous triumph...</p>

<p>"Ah! if I told all that I know! 'Nora,' she says, 'if anyone calls
when I'm not here, I wish ye'd take the message yerself. Mr. Jack don't
like to be disturbed.'...Jesus! From what I've seen there's none of 'em
that likes to be disturbed. It's love and let love wit' 'em, no
questions ast an' the divil take the hindmost, so long as ye do it in
yer leisure hours. But if ye're twenty minutes late fer dinner, it's
where the hell have ye been, an' what's to become of us when ye neglect
yer family in this way?...Sure," she thought, warming with a flush of
humour and a more tolerant and liberal spirit, "it's a queer world,
ain't it? An' these are the queerest of the lot! Thank God I was
brought up like a Christian in the Holy Church, an' still have grace
enough to go to Mass when I have sinned! But then----"</p>

<p>As often happens with people of strong but disordered feelings, she
was already sorry for her flare of ugly temper, and her affections were
now running warmly in another direction:</p>

<p>"But then, God knows, there's not a better-hearted sort of people in
the world! There's no one I'd rather work fer than Mrs. Jack. They'll
give ye everything they have if they like ye. I've been here twenty
years next April, an' in all that time no one has ever been turned away
from the door who needed food. Sure, there's far worse that go to Mass
seven days a week--yes, an' would steal the pennies off a dead man's
eyes if they got the chance! It's a good home we've been given here--as
I keep tellin' all the rest of 'em," she thought with virtuous content,
"an' Nora Fogarty's not the one to turn an' bite the hand that's
feedin' her--no matter what the rest of 'em may do!"</p>

<p>All this had passed in the minds and hearts of the two women with
the instancy of thought. Meanwhile, the maid, having set the tray down
on the little table by the bed, had gone to the windows, lowered them,
raised the blinds to admit more light, slightly adjusted the curtains,
and was now in the bathroom drawing the water in the tub, an activity
signalised at first by the rush of tumbling waters, and later by a
sound more quiet and sustained as she reduced the flow and tempered the
boiling fluid to a moderate heat.</p>

<p>While this was going on, Mrs. Jack had seated herself on the edge of
her bed, crossed her legs jauntily, poured out a cup of black steaming
coffee from the tall silver pot, and opened the newspaper which lay
folded on the tray. And now, as she drank her coffee and stared with
blank, unseeing eyes at the print before her, there was a perplexed
frown on her face, and she was slipping one finger in and out of a
curious and ancient ring which she wore on her right hand. It was a
habit which she performed unconsciously, and it always indicated a
state of impatience and nervousness, or the troubled reflection of a
mind that was rapidly collecting itself for a decisive action. So, now,
her first emotions of pity, curiosity, and regret having passed, the
practical necessity of doing something about Nora was pressing at
her.</p>

<p>"That's where Fritz's liquor has been going," she thought. "He's
been furious about it...She's got to stop it. If she keeps on at this
rate, she'll be no good for anything in another month or two...God! I
could kill her for being such a fool!" she thought. "What gets into
these people, anyway?" Her small and lovely face now red with anger,
the space between her troubled eyes cleft deeply by a frown, she
determined to speak plainly and sternly to the maid without any more
delay.</p>

<p>This decision being made, she was conscious instantly of a sense of
great relief and a feeling almost of happiness, for indecision was
alien to the temper of her soul. The knowledge of the maid's
delinquency had been nagging at her conscience for some time, and now
she wondered why she had ever hesitated. Yet, when the maid came back
into the room again and paused before going out, as if waiting for
further orders, and looked at her with a glance that now seemed
affectionate and warm, Mrs. Jack felt acute embarrassment and regret as
she began to speak, and, to her surprise, she found herself beginning
in a hesitant and almost apologetic tone.</p>

<p>"Oh, Nora!" she said somewhat excitedly, slipping the ring rapidly
on and off her finger. "There's something I want to talk to you
about."</p>

<p>"Yes, Mrs. Jack," Nora answered humbly, and waited respectfully.
"It's something Miss Edith wanted me to ask you," she went on quickly,
somewhat timidly, discovering to her amazement that she was beginning
her reproof quite differently from the way she had intended.</p>

<p>Nora waited in an attitude of studious and submissive attention.</p>

<p>"I wonder if you or any of the other girls remember seeing a dress
Miss Edith had," she said, and went on quickly--"one of those dresses
she brought back last year from Paris. It had a funny grey-green kind
of colour and she used to wear it in the morning when she went to
business. Do you remember--hah?" she said sharply.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," said Nora with a solemn, wondering air. "I've seen it,
Mrs. Jack."</p>

<p>"Well, Nora, she can't find it. It's gone."</p>

<p>"Gone?" said Nora, staring at her with a stupid and astonished
look.</p>

<p>But even as the servant repeated the word, a furtive smile played
round her mouth, betraying her sullen humour, and a look of sly triumph
came in her eyes. Mrs. Jack read the signs instantly:</p>

<p>"Yes! She knows where it is!" she thought. "Of course she knows! One
of them has taken it! It's perfectly disgraceful, and I'm not going to
stand it any longer!"--and a wave of indignation, hot and choking,
boiled up in her. "Yes, gone! It's gone, I tell you!" she said angrily
to the staring maid. "What's become of it? Where do you think it's gone
to?" she asked bluntly.</p>

<p>"I don't know, Mrs. Jack," Nora answered in a slow, wondering tone.
"Miss Edith must have lost it."</p>

<p>"Lost it! Oh, Nora, don't be stupid!" she cried furiously. "How
could she lose it? She's been nowhere. She's been here all the time.
And the dress was here, too, hanging in her closet, up to a week ago!
How can you lose a dress?" she cried impatiently. "Is it just going to
crawl off your back and walk away from you when you're not looking?"
she said sarcastically. "You know she didn't lose it! Someone's taken
it!"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," Nora said with dutiful acquiescence. "That's what I
think, too. Someone must have sneaked in here when all of yez was out
an' taken it. Ah, I tell ye," she remarked with a regretful movement of
the head, "it's got so nowadays ye never know who to trust and who not
to," she observed sententiously. "A friend of mine who works fer some
big people up at Rye was tellin' me just the other day about a man that
came there wit' some kind of a floor-mop he had to sell--ast to try it
out an' show 'em how it worked upon their floors, ye know, an' a finer,
cleaner-lookin' boy, she says, ye wouldn't see again in yer whole
lifetime. 'An' my God! she says--I'm tellin' ye just the way she told
it to me, Mrs. Jack--'I couldn't believe me own ears when they told me
later what he'd done! If he'd been me own brother I couldn't have been
more surprised!' she says.--Well, it just goes to show ye that----"</p>

<p>"Oh, Nora, for heaven's sake!" Mrs. Jack cried with an angry and
impatient gesture. "Don't talk such rot to me! Who would come in here
without your knowing it? You girls are here all day long, there's only
the elevator and the service entrance, and you see everyone who comes
in! And besides, if anyone ever took the trouble to break in, you know
he wouldn't stop with just one dress. He'd be after money or jewellery
or something valuable that he could sell."</p>

<p>"Well, now, I tell ye," Nora said, "that man was here last week to
fix the refrigerator. I says to May at the time: 'I don't like the look
of him,' I says. 'There's somethin' in his face that I don't like. Keep
yer eye on him,' I says, 'because----'"</p>

<p>"<i>Nora!</i>"</p>

<p>At the sharp warning in her mistress's voice the maid stopped
suddenly, looked quickly at her, and then was silent, with a dull flush
of shame and truculence upon her face. Mrs. Jack stared back at her
with a look of burning indignation, then she burst out with open,
blazing anger.</p>

<p>"Look here!" Mrs. Jack cried furiously. "I think it's a dirty shame
the way you girls are acting! We've been good to you! Nora," and now
her voice grew gentler with pity, "there are no girls in this town
who've been better treated than you have."</p>

<p>"Don't I know it, Mrs. Jack," Nora answered in a lilting and earnest
tone, but her eyes were sullenly hostile and resentful. "Haven't I
always said the same? Wasn't I sayin' the same thing meself to Janie
just the other day? 'Sure,' I says, 'but we're the lucky ones! There's
no one in the world I'd rather work fer than Mrs. Jack. Twenty years,'
I says, 'I've been here, an' in all that time,' I says, 'I've never
heard a cross word from her. They're the best people in the world,' I
says, 'an' any girl that gets a job wit' 'em is lucky!' Sure, don't I
know all of ye"--she cried richly--"Mr. Jack an' Miss Edith an' Miss
Alma? Wouldn't I get down on me knees right now an' scrub me fingers to
the bone if it would help ye any?"</p>

<p>"Who's asking you to scrub your fingers to the bone?" Mrs. Jack
cried impatiently. "Lord, Nora, you girls have it pretty soft. There's
mighty little scrubbing that you've had to do!" she said. "It's the
rest of us who scrub!" she cried. "We go out of here every morning--six
days in the week--and work like hell----"</p>

<p>"Don't I know it, Mrs. Jack?" Nora broke in. "Wasn't I sayin' to May
just the other day----"</p>

<p>"Oh, damn what you said to May!" For a brief moment Mrs. Jack looked
at the servant with a straight, burning face. Then she spoke more
quietly to her. "Nora, listen to me," she said. "We've always given you
girls everything you ever asked for. You've had the best wages anyone
can get for what you do. And you've lived here with us just the same as
the rest of us, for you know very well that----"</p>

<p>"Sure," Nora interrupted in a richly sentimental tone. "It hasn't
been like I was <i>workin'</i> here at all! Ye couldn't have treated me
any better if I'd been one of the family!"</p>

<p>"Oh, one of the family my eye!" Mrs. Jack said impatiently. "Don't
make me laugh! There's no one in the family--unless maybe it's my
daughter, Alma--who doesn't do more in a day than you girls do in a
week! You've lived the life of Riley...here! The life of Riley!" she
repeated, almost comically, and then she sat looking at the servant for
a moment, a formidable little dynamo trembling with her indignation,
slowly clenching and unclenching her small hands at her sides. "Good
heavens, Nora!" she burst out in a furious tone. "It's not as if we
ever begrudged you anything! We've never denied you anything you asked
for! It's not the value of the dress! You know very well that Miss
Edith would have given it to any one of you if you had gone to her and
asked her for it! But--oh, it's intolerable!--intolerable!" she
exclaimed suddenly in uncontrollable anger--"that you should have no
more sense or decency than to do a thing like that to people who have
always been your friends!"</p>

<p>"Sure, an' do ye think I'd be the one who'd do a thing like that?"
cried Nora in a trembling voice. "Is it me ye're accusin', Mrs. Jack,
when I've lived here wit' yez all this time? They could take me right
hand"--in her rush of feeling she held the member up--"an' chop it from
me arm before I'd take a button that belonged to one of yez. An' that's
God's truth," she added solemnly. "I swear it to ye as I hope to live
an' be forgiven fer me sins!" she declared more passionately as her
mistress started to speak. "I never took a pin or penny that belonged
to any one of yez--an' so help me God, that's true! An' yes! I'll swear
it to ye be everything that's holy!" she now cried, tranced in a kind
of ecstasy of sacred vows. "By the soul an' spirit of me blessed mother
who is dead----"</p>

<p>"Ah, Nora!" Mrs. Jack said pityingly, shaking her head and turning
away, and, in spite of her indignation, breaking into a short laugh at
the extravagance of the servant's oaths. And she thought with a bitter,
scornful humour: "God! You can't talk to her! She'll swear a thousand
oaths and think that makes everything all right! Yes! and will drink
Fritz's whisky and go to Mass if she has to crawl to get there--and
cross herself with holy water--and listen to the priest say words she
cannot understand--and come out glorified--to act like this when she
knows that one of the girl's is taking things that don't belong to her!
What strange and magic things these oaths and ceremonies are!" she
thought. "They give a kind of life to people who have none of their
own. They make a kind of truth for people who have found none for
themselves. Love, beauty, everlasting truth, salvation--all that we
hope and suffer for on earth is in them for these people. Everything
that the rest of us have to get with our blood and labour, and by the
anguish of our souls, is miraculously accomplished for <i>them</i>,
somehow," she thought ironically, "if they can only swear to it 'by the
soul an' spirit of me blessed mother who is dead.'"</p>

<p>"--An' so help me God, by all the Blessed Saints, an' by the Holy
Virgin, too!" she heard Nora's voice intoning; and, wearily, she turned
to the maid again and spoke to her softly, with an almost pleading
earnestness:</p>

<p>"Nora, for God's sake have a little sense," she said. "What is the
use of all this swearing by the Virgin and the Saints, and getting up
and going out to Mass, when all you do is come back home to swill down
Mr. Jack's whisky? Yes, and deceive the people who have been the best
friends you ever had!" she cried out bitterly. Then, seeing the old
mutinous look flaring again in the maid's sullen and distempered eyes,
she went on almost tearfully: "Nora, try to have a little wisdom. Is
this all you've been able to get from life--to come in here and act
this way and blow your stinking breath on me, when all we've ever done
has been to help you?" Her voice was trembling with her pity and her
sense of passionate outrage, yet her anger was more than personal. She
felt that the maid had betrayed something decent and inviolable in
life--a faith and integrity in human feeling that should be kept and
\honoured everywhere.</p>

<p>"Well, ma'am," said Nora with a toss of her black head, "as I was
sayin', if it's me ye're accusing'----"</p>

<p>"No, Nora. Enough of that." Mrs. Jack's voice was sad, tired,
dispirited, but its tone was also firm and final. She made a little
dismissing gesture with her hand. "You may go now. I don't need
anything more."</p>

<p>The maid marched to the door, her head held high, her stiff back and
neck eloquently expressive of outraged innocence and suppressed fury.
Then she paused, her hand upon the knob, and half-turned as she
delivered her parting shot.</p>

<p>"About Miss Edith's dress"--she said with another toss of her
head--"if it's not lost, I guess it'll turn up. Maybe one of the girls
borrowed it, if ye know what I mean."</p>

<p>With this, she closed the door behind her and was gone.</p>

<p>Half an hour later Mr. Frederick Jack came walking down the hall
with his copy of the <i>Herald-Tribune</i> under his arm. He was
feeling in very good humour. By now he had completely forgotten his
momentary annoyance at the telephone call that had awakened him in the
middle of the night. He rapped lightly at his wife's door and waited.
There was no answer. More faintly, listening, he rapped again.</p>

<p>"Are you there?" he said.</p>

<p>He opened the door and entered noiselessly.</p>

<p>She was already deeply absorbed in the first task of her day's work.
On the other side of the room, with her back to him, she was seated at
a small writing-desk between the windows with a little stack of bills,
business letters, and personal correspondence on her left hand, and an
open cheque-book on her right. She was vigorously scrawling off a note.
As he advanced towards her she put down the pen, swiftly blotted the
paper, and was preparing to fold it and thrust it in an envelope when
he spoke.</p>

<p>"Good morning," he said in the pleasant, half-ironic tone that
people use when they address someone who is not aware of their
presence.</p>

<p>She jumped and turned round quickly.</p>

<p>"Oh, hello, Fritz!" she cried in her jolly voice. "How are
youhah?"</p>

<p>He stooped in a somewhat formal fashion, planted a brief, friendly,
and perfunctory kiss on her cheek, and straightened up, unconsciously
shrugging his shoulders a little, and giving his sleeves and the bottom
of his coat a tug to smooth out any wrinkle that might have appeared to
disturb the faultless correctness of his appearance. While his wife's
quick glance took in every detail of his costume for the day--his
shoes, socks, trousers, coat, and tie, together with the perfection of
his tailored form and the neat gardenia in his buttonhole--her face,
now bent forward and held firmly in one cupped hand in an attitude of
eager attentiveness, had a puzzled and good-natured look which seemed
to say: "I can see that you are laughing at me about something. What
have I done now?"</p>

<p>Mr. Jack stood before her, feet apart and arms akimbo, regarding her
with an expression of mock gravity, in which, however, his good humour
and elation were apparent.</p>

<p>"Well, what is it?" she cried excitedly.</p>

<p>In answer, Mr. Jack produced the newspaper which he had been holding
folded back in one hand, and tapped it with his index finger,
saying:</p>

<p>"Have you seen this?"</p>

<p>"No. Who is it?"</p>

<p>"It's Elliot in the <i>Herald-Tribune</i>. Like to hear it?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Read it. What does he say?"</p>

<p>Mr. Jack struck a pose, rattled the paper, frowned, cleared his
throat in mock solemnity, and then began in a slightly ironic and
affected tone, intended to conceal his own deep pleasure and
satisfaction, to read the review.</p>

<p>"'Mr. Shulberg has brought to this, his latest production, the full
artillery of his distinguished gifts for suave direction. He has paced
it brilliantly, timed it--word, scene, and gesture--with some of the
most subtly nuanced, deftly restrained, and quietly persuasive acting
that this season has yet seen. He has a gift for silence that is
eloquent--oh, devoutly eloquent!--among all the loud but for the most
part meaningless vociferation of the current stage. All this your
diligent observer is privileged to repeat with more than customary
elation. Moreover, Mr. Shulberg has revealed to us in the person of
Montgomery Mortimer the finest youthful talent that this season has
discovered. Finally----'"</p>

<p>Mr. Jack cleared his throat solemnly--"Ahem, ahem!"--flourished his
arms forward and rattled the paper expressively, and stared drolly at
his wife over the top of it. Then he went on:</p>

<p>"'Finally, he has given us, with the distinguished aid of Miss
Esther Jack, a faultless and unobtrusive <i>d&eacute;cor</i> which
warmed these ancient bones as they have not been warmed for many a
Broadway moon. In these three acts, Miss Jack contributes three of the
most effective settings she has ever done for the stage. Hers is a
talent that needs make obeisance to no one. She is, in fact, in the
studied opinion of this humble but diligent observer, the first
designer of her time.'"</p>

<p>Mr. Jack paused abruptly, looked at her with playful gravity, his
head cocked over the edges of the paper and said: "Did you say
something?"</p>

<p>"God!" she yelled, her happy face flushed with laughter and
excitement. "Did you hear it? Vat is dees?" she said comically, making
a Jewish gesture with her hands--"an ovation?--What else does he
say--hah?" she asked, bending forward eagerly.</p>

<p>Mr. Jack proceeded:</p>

<p>"'It is therefore a pity that Miss Jack's brilliant talent should
not have had better fare to feed on than was given it last evening at
the Arlington. For the play itself, we must reluctantly admit, was
neither----'"</p>

<p>"Well," said Mr. Jack, stopping abruptly and putting down the paper,
"the rest of it is you know"--he shrugged slightly--"sort of soso.
Neither good nor bad. He sort of pans it.--But <i>say!</i>" he cried,
with jocular indignation. "I like the nerve of that guy! Where does he
get this Miss Esther Jack stuff? Where do I come in?" he said. "Don't I
get any credit at all for being your husband? You know," he said, "I'd
like to get in somewhere if it's only a seat in the second balcony. Of
course"--and now he began to speak in the impersonal manner that people
often use when they are being heavily sarcastic, addressing himself to
the vacant air as if some invisible auditor were there, and as if he
himself were only a detached observer--"of course, he's nothing but her
husband, anyway. What is he? <i>Bah!</i>" he said scornfully and
contemptuously. "Nothing but a business man who doesn't deserve to have
such a brilliant woman for his wife! What does be know about art? Can
he appreciate her? Can he understand anything she does? Can he
say--what is it this fellow says?" he demanded, suddenly looking at the
paper with an intent stare and then reading from it again in an
affected tone--"'a faultless and unobtrusive <i>d&eacute;cor</i> which
warmed these ancient bones as they have not been warmed for many a
Broadway moon.'"</p>

<p>"I know," she said with pitying contempt, as if the florid words of
the reviewer aroused in her no other emotion, although the pleasure
which the reviewer's praise had given her was still legible in her
face. "I know. Isn't it pathetic? They're all so fancy, these fellows!
They make me tired!"</p>

<p>"'Hers is a talent that needs make obeisance to no one,'" Mr. Jack
continued. "Now that's a good one! Could her husband think of a thing
like that? No!" he cried suddenly, shaking his head with a scornful
laugh and waving a plump forefinger sideways before him. "Her husband
is not smart enough!" he cried. "He is not good enough! He's nothing
but a business man! He can't appreciate her!"--and all at once, to her
amazement, she saw that his eyes were shot with tears, and that the
lenses of his spectacles were being covered with a film of mist.</p>

<p>She stared at him wonderingly, her face bent towards him in an
expression of startled and protesting concern, but at the same moment
she was feeling, as she had often felt; that there was something
obscure and strange in life which she had never been able to find out
about or to express. For she knew that this unexpected and reasonless
display of strong feeling in her husband bore no relation whatever to
the review in the paper. His chagrin at having the reviewer refer to
her as "Miss" was nothing more than a playful and jocular pretence. She
knew that he was really bursting with elation because of her
success.</p>

<p>With a sudden poignant and wordless pity--for whom, for what, she
could not say--she had an instant picture of the great chasms downtown
where he would spend his day, and where, in the furious drive and
turmoil of his business, excited, prosperous-looking men would seize
his arm or clap him on the back and shout:</p>

<p>"Say, have you seen to-day's <i>Herald-Tribune</i>? Did you read
what it had to say about your wife? Aren't you proud of her?
Congratulations!"</p>

<p>She could also see his ruddy face beginning to blush and burn
brick-red with pleasure as he received these tributes, and as he tried
to answer them with an amused and tolerant smile, and a few casual
words of acknowledgment as if to say:</p>

<p>"Yes, I think I did see some mention of her. But of course you can
hardly expect me to be excited by a thing like that. That's an old
story to us now. They've said that kind of thing so often that we're
used to it."</p>

<p>When he came home that night he would repeat all that had been said
to him, and although he would do it with an air of faintly cynical
amusement, she knew that his satisfaction would be immense and solid.
She knew, too, that his pride would be enhanced by the knowledge that
the wives of these rich men--handsome Jewesses most of them, as
material-minded in their quest for what was fashionable in the world of
art as were their husbands for what was profitable in the world of
business--would also read of her success, would straightway go to
witness it themselves, and then would speak of it in brilliant chambers
of the night, where the glowing air would take on an added spice of
something exciting and erotic from their handsome and sensual-looking
faces.</p>

<p>All this she thought of instantly as she stared at this plump,
grey-haired, and faultlessly groomed man whose eyes had suddenly, and
for no reason that she knew, filled with tears, and whose mouth now had
the pouting, wounded look of a hurt child. And her heart was filled
with a nameless and undefinable sense of compassion as she cried
warmly, in a protesting voice:</p>

<p>"But, Fritz! You know I never felt like that! You know I never said
a thing like that to you! You know I love it when you like anything I
do! I'd rather have your opinion ten times over than that of these
newspaper fellows! What do they know anyway?" she muttered
scornfully.</p>

<p>Mr. Jack, having taken off his glasses and polished them, having
blown his nose vigorously and put his glasses on again, now lowered his
head, braced his thumb stiffly on his temple and put four plump fingers
across his eyes in a comical shielding position, saying rapidly in a
muffled, apologetic voice:</p>

<p>"I know! I know! It's all right! I was only joking," he said with an
embarrassed smile. Then he blew his nose vigorously again, his face
lost its expression of wounded feeling, and he began to talk in a
completely natural, matter-of-fact tone, as if nothing he had done or
said had been at all unusual. "Well," he said, "how do you feel? Are
you pleased with the way things went last night?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I suppose so," she answered dubiously, feeling all at once the
vague discontent that was customary with her when her work was finished
and the almost hysterical tension of the last days before a theatrical
opening was at an end. Then she continued: "I think it went off pretty
well, don't you? I thought my sets were sort of good--or did you think
so?" she asked eagerly. "No," she went on in the disparaging tone of a
child talking to itself, "I guess they were just ordinary. A long way
from my best--hah?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"You know what I think," he said. "I've told you. There's no one who
can touch you. The best thing in the show!" he said strongly. "They
were by far the best thing in the show--by far! by <i>far!</i>" Then,
quietly, he added: "Well, I suppose you're glad it's over. That's the
end of it for this season, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "except for some costumes that I promised Irene
Morgenstein I'd do for one of her ballets. And I've got to meet some of
the Arlington company for fittings again this morning," she concluded
in a dispirited tone.</p>

<p>"What, again! Weren't you satisfied with the way they looked last
night? What's the trouble?"</p>

<p>"Oh"--she said with disgust--"what do you think's the trouble,
Fritz? There's only one trouble! It never changes! It's always the
same! The trouble is that there are so many half-baked fools in the
world who'll never do the thing you tell them to do! That's the
trouble! God!" she said frankly, "I'm too good for it! I never should
have given up my painting. It makes me sick sometimes!" she burst out
with warm indignation. "Isn't it a shame that everything I do has to be
wasted on those people?"</p>

<p>"What people?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you know," she muttered, "the kind of people that you get in
the theatre. Of course there are some good ones--but God!" she
exclaimed, "most of them are such trash! Did you see me in this, and
did you read what they said about me in that, and wasn't I a knockout
in the other thing?" she muttered resentfully. "God, Fritz, to listen
to the way they talk you'd think the only reason a play ever gets
produced is to give them a chance to strut around and show themselves
off upon a stage! When it ought to be the most wonderful thing in the
world! Oh, the magic you can make, the things you can do with people if
you want to! It's like nothing else on earth!" she cried. "Isn't it a
shame no more is done with it?"</p>

<p>She was silent for a moment; sunk in her own thoughts, then she said
wearily:</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad this job's at an end. I wish there was something
else I could do. If I only knew how to do something else, I'd do it.
Really, I would," she said earnestly. "I'm tired of it. I'm too good
for it," she said simply, and for a moment she stared moodily into
space.</p>

<p>Then, frowning in a sombre and perturbed way, she fumbled in a
wooden box upon the desk, took from it a cigarette, and lighted it. She
got up nervously and began to walk about the room with short steps,
frowning intently while she puffed at the cigarette, and holding it in
the rather clumsy but charming manner of a woman who rarely smokes.</p>

<p>"I wonder if I'll get any more shows to do next season," she
muttered half to herself, as if scarcely aware of her husband's
presence. "I wonder if there'll be anything more for me. No one has
spoken to me yet," she said gloomily.</p>

<p>"Well, if you're so tired of it, I shouldn't think you'd care," he
said ironically, and then added: "Why worry about it till the time
comes?"</p>

<p>With that he stooped and planted another friendly and perfunctory
kiss on her cheek, gave her shoulder a gentle little pat, and turned
and left the room.</p>

<h2><a name="chapter2-12"></a>12. Downtown</h2>

<p>Mr. Jack had listened to his wife's complaint with the serious
attention which stories of her labours, trials, and adventures in the
theatre always aroused in him. For, in addition to the immense pride
which he took in his wife's talent and success, he was like most rich
men of his race, and particularly those who were living every day, as
he was, in the glamorous, unreal, and fantastic world of speculation,
strongly attracted by the glitter of the theatre.</p>

<p>The progress of his career during the forty years since he first
came to New York had been away from the quieter, more traditional, and,
as it now seemed to him, duller forms of social and domestic life, to
those forms which were more brilliant and gay, filled with the constant
excitement of new pleasures and sensations, and touched with a spice of
uncertainty and menace. The life of his boyhood--that of his family,
who for a hundred years had carried on a private banking business in a
little town--now seemed to him impossibly stodgy. Not only its domestic
and social activities, which went on as steadily and predictably as a
clock from year to year, marked at punctual intervals by a ritual of
dutiful visits and countervisits among relatives, but its business
enterprise also, with its small and cautious transactions, now seemed
paltry and uninteresting.</p>

<p>In New York he had moved on from speed to speed and from height to
height, keeping pace with all the most magnificent developments in the
furious city that roared in constantly increasing crescendo about him.
Now, even in the world in which he lived by day, the feverish air of
which he breathed into his lungs exultantly, there was a glittering,
inflamed quality that was not unlike that of the night-time world of
the theatre in which the actors lived.</p>

<p>At nine o'clock in the morning of every working day, Mr. Jack was
hurled downtown to his office in a shining projectile of machinery,
driven by a chauffeur who was a literal embodiment of New York in one
of its most familiar aspects. As the driver prowled above his wheel,
his dark and sallow face twisted bitterly by the sneer of his thin
mouth, his dark eyes shining with an unnatural lustre like those of a
man who is under the stimulation of a powerful drug, he seemed to
be--and was--a creature which this furious city had created for its
special uses. His tallowy flesh seemed to have been compacted, like
that of millions of other men who wore grey hats and had faces of the
same lifeless hue, out of a common city-substance--the universal grey
stuff of pavements, buildings, towers, tunnels, and bridges. In his
veins there seemed to flow and throb, instead of blood, the crackling
electric current by which the whole city moved. It was legible in every
act and gesture the man made. As his sinister figure prowled above the
wheel, his eyes darting right and left, his hands guiding the powerful
machine with skill and precision, grazing, cutting, flanking, shifting,
insinuating, sneaking, and shooting the great car through all but
impossible channels with murderous recklessness, it was evident that
the unwholesome chemistry that raced in him was consonant with the
great energy that was pulsing through all the arteries of the city.</p>

<p>Yet, to be driven downtown by this creature in this way seemed to
increase Mr. Jack's anticipation and pleasure in the day's work that
lay before him. He liked to sit beside his driver and watch him. The
fellow's eyes were now sly and cunning as a cat's, now hard and black
as basalt. His thin face pivoted swiftly right and left, now leering
with crafty triumph as he snaked his car ahead round some cursing
rival, now from the twisted corner of his mouth snarling out his hate
loudly at other drivers or at careless pedestrians: "Guh-wan, ya screwy
bast-ed! Guh-wan!" He would growl more softly at the menacing figure of
some hated policeman, or would speak to his master out of the corner of
his bitter mouth, saying a few words of grudging praise for some
policeman who had granted him privileges:</p>

<p>"Some of dem are all right," he would say. "You know!"--with a
constricted accent of his high, strained voice. "Dey're not all
basteds. Dis guy"--with a jerk of his head towards the policeman who
had nodded and let him pass--"dis guy's all right. I know him--sure!
sure!--he's a bruddeh of me sisteh-in-law!"</p>

<p>The unnatural and unwholesome energy of his driver evoked in his
master's mind an image of the world he lived in that was theatrical and
phantasmal. Instead of seeing himself as one man going to his work like
countless others in the practical and homely light of day, he saw
himself and his driver as two cunning and powerful men pitted
triumphantly against the world; and the monstrous architecture of the
city, the phantasmagoric chaos of its traffic, the web of the streets
swarming with people, became for him nothing more than a tremendous
backdrop for his own activities. All of this--the sense of menace,
conflict, cunning, power, stealth, and victory, and, above everything
else, the sense of privilege--added to Mr. Jack's pleasure, and even
gave him a heady joy as he rode downtown to work.</p>

<p>And the feverish world of speculation in which he worked, and which
had now come to have this theatrical cast and colour, was everywhere
sustained by this same sense of privilege. It was the privilege of men
selected from the common run because of some mysterious intuition they
were supposed to have--selected to live gloriously without labour or
production, their profits mounting incredibly with every ticking of the
clock, their wealth increased fabulously by a mere nod of the head or
the shifting of a finger. This being so, it seemed to Mr. Jack, and,
indeed, to many others at the time--for many who were not themselves
members of this fortunate class envied those who were--it seemed, then,
not only entirely reasonable but even natural that the whole structure
of society from top to bottom should be honeycombed with privilege and
dishonesty.</p>

<p>Mr. Jack knew, for example, that one of his chauffeurs swindled him
constantly. He knew that every bill for petrol, oil, tyres, and
overhauling was padded, that the chauffeur was in collusion with the
garage owner for this purpose, and that he received a handsome
percentage from him as a reward. Yet this knowledge did not disturb Mr.
Jack. He actually got from it a degree of cynical amusement. Well aware
of what was going on, he also knew that he could afford it, and somehow
this gave him a sense of power and security. If he ever entertained any
other attitude, it was to shrug his shoulders indifferently as he
thought:</p>

<p>"Well, what of it? There's nothing to be done about it. They all do
it. If it wasn't this fellow, it would be someone else."</p>

<p>Similarly, he knew that some of the maids in his household were not
above "borrowing" things and "forgetting" to return them. He was aware
that various members of the police force as well as several red-necked
firemen spent most of their hours of ease in his kitchen or in the
maids' sitting-room. He also knew that these guardians of the public
peace and safety ate royally every night of the choicest dishes of his
own table, and that their wants were cared for even before his family
and his guests were served, and that his best whisky and his rarest
wines were theirs for the taking.</p>

<p>But beyond an occasional burst of annoyance when he discovered that
a case of real Irish whisky (with rusty sea-stained markings on the
bottles to prove genuineness) had melted away almost overnight, a loss
which roused his temper only because of the rareness of the thing lost,
he said very little. When his wife spoke to him about such matters, as
she occasionally did, in a tone of vague protest, saying: "Fritz, I'm
sure those girls are taking things they have no right to. I think it's
perfectly dreadful, don't you? What do you think we ought to do about
it?"--his usual answer was to smile tolerantly, shrug, and show his
palms.</p>

<p>It cost him a great deal of money to keep his family provided with
shelter, clothing, service, food, and entertainment, but the fact that
a considerable part of it was wasted or actually filched from him by
his retainers caused him no distress whatever. All of this was so much
of a piece with what went on every day in big business and high finance
that he hardly gave it a thought. And his indifference was not the
bravado of a man who felt that his world was trembling on the brink of
certain ruin and who was recklessly making merry while he waited for
the collapse. Quite the contrary. He gave tolerant consent to the
extravagance and special privilege of those who were dependent on his
bounty, not because he doubted, but because he felt secure. He was
convinced that the fabric of his world was woven from threads of steel,
and that the towering pyramid of speculation would not only endure, but
would grow constantly greater. Therefore the defections of his servants
were mere peccadillos, and didn't matter.</p>

<p>In all these ways Mr. Frederick Jack was not essentially different
from ten thousand other men of his class and position. In that time and
place he would have been peculiar if these things had not been true of
him. For these men were all the victims of an occupational disease--a
kind of mass hypnosis that denied to them the evidence of their senses.
It was a monstrous and ironic fact that the very men who had created
this world in which every value was false and theatrical saw
themselves, not as creatures tranced by fatal illusions, but rather as
the most knowing, practical, and hard-headed men alive. They did not
think of themselves as gamblers, obsessed by their own fictions of
speculation, but as brilliant executives of great affairs who at every
moment of the day "had their fingers on the pulse of the nation." So
when they looked about them and saw everywhere nothing but the myriad
shapes of privilege, dishonesty, and self-interest, they were convinced
that this was inevitably "the way things are".</p>

<p>It was generally assumed that every man had his price, just as every
woman had hers. And if, in any discussion of conduct, it was suggested
to one of these hard-headed, practical men that So-and-So had acted as
he did for motives other than those of total self-interest and
calculating desire, that he had done thus and so because he would
rather endure pain himself than cause it to others whom he loved, or
was loyal because of loyalty, or could not be bought or sold for no
other reason than the integrity of his own character--the answer of the
knowing one would be to smile politely but cynically, shrug it off, and
say:</p>

<p>"All right. But I thought you were going to be intelligent. Let's
talk of something else that we both understand."</p>

<p>Such men could not realise that their own vision of human nature was
distorted. They prided themselves on their "hardness" and fortitude and
intelligence, which had enabled them to accept so black a picture of
the earth with such easy tolerance. It was not until a little later
that the real substance of their "hardness" and intelligence was
demonstrated to them in terms which they could grasp. When the bubble
of their unreal world suddenly exploded before their eyes, many of them
were so little capable of facing harsh reality and truth that they blew
their brains out or threw themselves from the high windows of their
offices into the streets below. And of those who faced it and saw it
through, many a one who had been plump, immaculate, and assured now
shrank and withered into premature and palsied senility.</p>

<p>All that, however, was still in the future. It was very imminent,
but they did not know it, for they had trained themselves to deny the
evidence of their senses. In that mid-October of 1929 nothing could
exceed their satisfaction and assurance. They looked about them and,
like an actor, saw with their eyes that all was false, but since they
had schooled themselves to accept falseness as normal and natural, the
discovery only enhanced their pleasure in life.</p>

<p>The choicest stories which these men told each other had to do with
some facet of human chicanery, treachery, and dishonesty. They
delighted to match anecdotes concerning the delightful knaveries of
their chauffeurs, maids, cooks, and bootleggers, telling of the way
these people cheated them as one would describe the antics of a
household pet.</p>

<p>Such stories also had a great success at the dinner-table. The
ladies would listen with mirth which they made an impressive show of
trying to control, and at the conclusion of the tale they would say:
"I--think--that--is--simp-ly--price-less!" (uttered slowly and
deliberately, as if the humour of the story was almost beyond belief),
or: "Isn't it in-cred-ible!" (spoken with a faint rising scream of
laughter), or: "Stop! You know he didn't!" (delivered with a ladylike
shriek). They used all the fashionable and stereotyped phrases of
people "responding" to an "amusing" anecdote, for their lives had
become so sterile and savourless that laughter had gone out of
them.</p>

<p>Mr. Jack had a story of his own, and he told it so well and so
frequently that it went the rounds of all the best dinner-tables in New
York.</p>

<p>A few years before, when he was still living in the old brownstone
house on the West Side, his wife was giving one of the open-house
patties which she gave every year to the members of the "group" theatre
for which she worked. At the height of the gaiety, when the party was
in full swing and the actors were swarming through the rooms, gorging
themselves to their heart's content on the bountiful food and drink,
there was suddenly a great screaming of police sirens in the
neighbourhood, and the sound of motors driven to their limit and
approaching at top speed. The sirens turned into the street, and to the
alarm of Mr. Jack and his guests, who now came crowding to the windows,
a high-powered truck flanked by two motor-cycle policemen pulled up
before the house and stopped. Immediately, the two policemen, whom Mr.
Jack instantly recognised as friends of his maids, sprang to the
ground, and in a moment more, with the assistance of several of their
fellows who got out of the truck, they had lifted a great barrel from
the truck and were solemnly rolling it across the pavement and up the
stone steps into the house. This barrel, it turned out, was filled with
beer. The police were contributing it to the party, to which they had
been invited (for when the Jacks gave a party to their friends, the
maids and cooks were also allowed to give a party to the policemen and
firemen in the kitchen). Mr. Jack, moved by this act of friendship and
generosity on the part of the police, desired to pay them for the
trouble and expense the beer had cost them, but one of the policemen
said to him:</p>

<p>"Forget about it, boss. It's O.K. I tell you how it is," he then
said, lowering his voice to a tone of quiet and confidential intimacy.
"Dis stuff don't cost us nuttin', see? Nah!" he vigorously declared.
"It's given to us. Sure! It's a commission dey give us," he added
delicately, "for seein' dat dere stuff goes troo O.K. See?"</p>

<p>Mr. Jack saw, and he told the story many times. For he was really a
good and generous man, and an act like this, even when it came from
those who had drunk royally at his expense for years and had consumed
the value of a hundred barrels of beer, warmed and delighted him.</p>

<p>Thus, while he could not escape sharing the theatrical and false
view of life which was prevalent everywhere about him, he had, along
with that, as kind and liberal a spirit as one was likely to meet in
the course of a day's journey. Of this there was constant and repeated
evidence. He would act instantly to help people in distress, and he did
it again and again--for actors down on their luck, for elderly
spinsters with schemes for the renovation of the stage that were never
profitable, for friends, relatives, and superannuated domestics. In
addition to this, he was a loving and indulgent father, lavishing gifts
upon his only child with a prodigal hand.</p>

<p>And, strangely, for one who lived among all the constantly shifting
visages of a feverish and unstable world, he had always held with
tenacious devotion to one of the ancient traditions of his race--a
belief in the sacred and inviolable stability of the family. Through
this devotion, in spite of the sensational tempo of city life with its
menace to every kind of security, he had managed to keep his family
together. And this was really the strongest bond which now connected
him with his wife. They had long since agreed to live their own
individual lives, but they had joined together in a common effort to
maintain the unity of their family. And they had succeeded. For this
reason and on this ground Mr. Jack respected and had a real affection
for his wife.</p>

<p>Such was the well-groomed man who was delivered to his place of
business every morning by his speed-drunk and city-hardened chauffeur.
And within a hundred yards of the place where he alighted from his car
ten thousand other men much like him in dress and style, in their
general beliefs, and even, perhaps, in kindness, mercy, and tolerance,
were also descending from their thunderbolts and were moving into
another day of legend, smoke, and fury.</p>

<p>Having been set down at their doors, they were shot up in swift
elevators to offices in the clouds. There they bought, sold, and traded
in an atmosphere fraught with frantic madness. This madness was
everywhere about them all day long, and they themselves were aware of
it. Oh, yes, they sensed it well enough. Yet they said nothing. For it
was one of the qualities of this time that men should see and feel the
madness all round them and never mention it--never admit it even to
themselves.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="chapter2-13"></a>13. Service Entrance</h2>

<p>The great apartment house in which the Jacks lived was not one of
those structures which give to the Island of Manhattan its startling
and fabulous quality--those cloud-soaring spires whose dizzy vertices
and clifflike fa&ccedil;ades seem to belong to the sky rather than to
the earth. These are the special shapes which flash in the mind of a
European when he thinks about New York, and which in-bound travellers,
looking from a liner's deck, see in all their appalling and inhuman
loveliness sustained there lightly on the water. This building was none
of these.</p>

<p>It was--just a building. It was not beautiful, certainly, but it was
impressive because of its bulk, its squareness, its sheer mass. From
the outside, it seemed to be a gigantic cube of city-weathered brick
and stone, punctured evenly by its many windows. It filled an entire
block, going through one street to the next.</p>

<p>When one entered it, however, one saw that it had been built in the
form of a hollow square about a large central court. This court was
laid out on two levels. The lower and middle part was covered with
loose gravel, and raised above this level was a terrace for
flower-beds, with a broad brick pavement flanking it on all four sides.
Beyond the walk there was a span of arches which also ran the whole way
round the square, giving the place something of the appearance of an
enormous cloister. Leading off this cloister at regular intervals were
the entrances to the apartments.</p>

<p>The building was so grand, so huge, so solid-seeming, that it gave
the impression of having been hewn from the everlasting rock itself.
Yet this was not true at all. The mighty edifice was really tubed and
hollowed like a giant honeycomb. It was set on monstrous steel stilts,
pillared below on vacancy, and sustained on curving arches. Its nerves,
bones, and sinews went down below the level of the street to an
underworld of storeyed basements, and below all these, far in the
tortured rock, there was the tunnel's depth.</p>

<p>When dwellers in this imperial tenement felt a tremor at their feet,
it was only then that they remembered there were trains beneath
them--sleek expresses arriving and departing at all hours of the day
and night. Then some of them reflected with immense satisfaction on the
cleverness with which New York had reversed an order that is fixed and
immutable everywhere else in America, and had made it fashionable to
live, not merely "beside the tracks", but on top of them.</p>

<p>A little before seven o'clock that October evening, old John, who
ran one of the service elevators in the building, came walking slowly
along Park Avenue, ready to go on duty for his night's work. He had
reached the entrance and was just turning in when he was accosted by a
man of thirty or thereabouts who was obviously in a state of vinous
dilapidation.</p>

<p>"Say, Bud----"</p>

<p>At the familiar words, uttered in a tone of fawning and yet rather
menacing ingratiation, the face of the older man reddened with anger.
He quickened his step and tried to move away, but the creature plucked
at his sleeve and said in a low voice:</p>

<p>"I was just wonderin' if you could spare a guy a----"</p>

<p>"Na-h!" the old man snapped angrily. "I can't spare you anything!
I'm twice your age and I always had to work for everything I got! If
you was any good you'd do the same!"</p>

<p>"Oh yeah?" the other jeered, looking at the old man with eyes that
had suddenly gone hard and ugly.</p>

<p>"Yeah!" old John snapped back, and then turned and passed through
the great arched entrance of the building, feeling that his repartee
had been a little inadequate, though it was the best he had been able
to manage on the spur of the moment. He was still muttering to himself
as he started along the colonnade that led to the south wing.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Pop?" It was Ed, one of the day elevator men who
spoke to him. "Who got your goat?"</p>

<p>"Ah-h," John muttered, still fuming with resentment, "it's these
panhandling bums! One of 'em just stopped me outside the building and
asked if I could spare a dime! A young fellow no older than you are,
tryin' to panhandle from an old man like me! He ought to be ashamed of
himself! I told him so, too. I said: 'If you was any good you'd work
for it!'"</p>

<p>"Yeah?" said Ed, with mild interest.</p>

<p>"Yeah," said John. "They ought to keep those fellows away from here.
They hang round this neighbourhood like flies at a molasses barrel.
They got no right to bother the kind of people we got here."</p>

<p>There was just a faint trace of mollification in his voice as he
spoke of "the kind of people we got here". One felt that on this side
reverence lay. "The kind of people we got here" were, at all odds, to
be protected and preserved.</p>

<p>"That's the only reason they hang round this place," the old man
went on. "They know they can play on the sympathy of the people in this
building. Only the other night I saw one of 'em panhandle Mrs. Jack for
a dollar. A big fellow, as well and strong as you are! I'd a good
notion to tell her not to give him anything! If he wanted work, he
could go and get him a job the same as you and me! It's got so if ain't
safe for a woman in the house to take the dog round the block. Some
greasy bum will be after her before she gets back. If I was the
management I'd put a stop to it. A house like this can't afford it. The
kind of people we got here don't have to stand for it!"</p>

<p>Having made these pronouncements, so full of outraged propriety and
his desire to protect "the kind of people we got here" from further
invasions of their trusting sanctity by these cadging frauds, old John,
somewhat appeased, went in at the service entrance of the south wing,
and in a few minutes he was at his post in the service elevator, ready
for the night's work.</p>

<p>John Enborg had been born in Brooklyn more than sixty years before,
the son of a Norwegian seaman and an Irish serving-girl. In spite of
this mixed parentage, one would have said without hesitation that he
was "old stock" American--New England Yankee, most likely. Even his
physical structure had taken on those national characteristics which
are perhaps the result, partly of weather and geography, partly of
tempo, speech, and local custom--a special pattern of the nerves and
vital energies wrought out upon the whole framework of flesh and bone,
so that, from whatever complex sources they are derived, they are
recognised instantly and unmistakably as "American".</p>

<p>In all these ways old John was "American". He had the dry neck--the
lean, sinewy, furrowed neck that is engraved so harshly with so much
weather. He had the dry face, too, seamed and squeezed of its moisture;
the dry mouth, not brutal, certainly, but a little tight and stiff and
woodenly inflexible; and the slightly outcropping lower jaw, as if the
jarring conflicts in the life around him had hardened the very
formations of the bone into this shape of unyielding tenacity. He was
not much above the average height, but his whole body had the same
stringy leanness of his neck and face, and this made him seem taller.
The old man's hands were large and bony, corded with heavy veins, as if
he had done much work with them. Even his voice and manner of talking
were distinctively "American". His speech was spare, dry, nasal, and
semi-articulate. It could have passed with most people as the speech of
a Vermonter, although it did not have any pronounced twang. What one
noticed about it especially was its Yankee economy and tartness, which
seemed to indicate a chronic state of sour temper. But he was very far
from being an ill-natured old man, though at times he did appear to be.
It was just his way. He had a dry humour and really loved the rough and
ready exchange of banter that went on among the younger elevator men
around him, but he concealed his softer side behind a mask of shortness
and sarcastic denial.</p>

<p>This was evident now as Herbert Anderson came in. Herbert was the
night operator of the passenger elevator in the south entrance. He was
a chunky, good-natured fellow of twenty-four or five, with two pink,
mottled, absurdly fresh spots on his plump cheeks. He had lively and
good-humoured eyes, and a mass of crinkly brownish hair of which one
felt he was rather proud. He was John's special favourite in the whole
building, although one might not have gathered this from the exchange
that now took place between them.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you say, Pop?" cried Herbert as he entered the
service elevator and poked the old man playfully in the ribs. "You
haven't seen anything of two blondes yet, have you?"</p>

<p>The faint, dry grin about John Enborg's mouth deepened a little
almost to a stubborn line, as he swung the door to and pulled the
lever.</p>

<p>"Ah-h," he said sourly, almost in disgust, "I don't know what you're
talkin' about!"</p>

<p>The car descended and stopped, and he pulled the door open at the
basement floor.</p>

<p>"Sure you do!" Herbert flung back vigorously as he walked over to
the line of lockers, peeled off his coat, and began to take off his
collar and tie. "You know those two blondes I been tellin' you about,
doncha, Pop?" By this time he was peeling the shirt off his muscular
shoulders, then he supported himself with one hand against the locker
while he stooped to take off his shoe.</p>

<p>"Ah-h," said the old man, sour as before, "you're always tellin' me
about something. I don't even pay no attention to it. It goes in one
ear and out the other."</p>

<p>"Oh yeah?" said Herbert with a rising, ironical inflection. He bent
to unlace his other shoe.</p>

<p>"Yeah," said John dryly.</p>

<p>From the beginning the old man's tone had been touched with this
note of dry disgust, yet somehow he gave the impression that he was
secretly amused by Herbert's chatter. For one thing, he made no move to
depart. Instead, he had propped himself against the side of the open
elevator door, and, his old arms folded loosely into the sleeves of the
worn grey alpaca coat which was his "uniform", he was waiting there
with the stubborn little grin round his mouth as if he was enjoying the
debate and was willing to prolong it indefinitely.</p>

<p>"So that's the kind of guy you are?" said Herbert, stepping out of
his neatly-pressed trousers and arranging them carefully on one of the
hangers which he had taken from the locker. He hung the coat over the
trousers and buttoned it. "Here I go and get you all fixed up and you
run out on me. O.K., Pop." His voice was now shaded with resignation.
"I thought you was a real guy, but if you're goin' to walk out on a
party after I've gone to all the trouble, I'll have to look for
somebody else."</p>

<p>"Oh yeah?" said old John.</p>

<p>"Yeah," said Herbert in the accent proper to this type of repartee.
"I had you all doped out for a live number, but I see I picked a dead
one."</p>

<p>John let this pass without comment. Herbert stood for a moment in
his socks and underwear, stiffening his shoulders, twisting,
stretching, bending his arms upwards with tense muscular effort, and
ending by scratching his head.</p>

<p>"Where's old Organisin' Hank?" Herbert said presently. "Seen him
to-night?"</p>

<p>"Who?" said John, looking at him with a somewhat bewildered
expression.</p>

<p>"Henry. He wasn't at the door when I come in, and he ain't down
here. He's gonna be late."</p>

<p>"Oh!" The word was small but it carried a heavy accent of
disapproval. "Say!" The old man waved a gnarled hand stiffly in a
downward gesture of dismissal. "That guy's a pain in the neck!" He
spoke the words with the dry precision old men have when they try to
"keep up with" a younger man by talking unaccustomed slang. "A pain in
the neck!" he repeated. "No, I ain't seen him to-night."</p>

<p>"Oh, Hank's all right when you get to know him," said Herbert
cheerfully. "You know how a guy is when he gets all burned up about
somethin'--he gets too serious about it--he thinks everybody else in
the world ought to be like he is. But he's O.K. He's not a bad guy when
you get him talkin' about somethin' else."</p>

<p>"Yeah!" cried John suddenly and excitedly, not in agreement, but by
way of introduction to something he had just remembered. "You know what
he says to me the other day? 'I wonder what all the rich mugs in this
house would do,' he says, 'if they had to get down and do a hard day's
work for a livin' once in a while.' That's what he says to me! 'And
these old bitches'--yeah!" cried John, nodding his head
angrily--"'these old bitches,' he says, 'that I got to help in and out
of cars all night long, and can't walk up a flight of stairs by
themselves--what if they had to get down on their hands and knees and
scrub floors like your mother and my mother did?' That's the way he
goes on all the time!" cried John indignantly--"and him a-gettin' his
livin' from the people in this house, and takin' tips from them--and
then talkin' about them like he does!--Nah-h!" John muttered to himself
and rapped his fingers on the wall. "I don't like that way of talkin'!
If he feels that way, let him get out! I don't like that fellow."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Herbert easily and indifferently, "Hank's not a bad guy,
Pop. He don't mean half of it. He's just a grouch."</p>

<p>By this time, with the speed and deftness born of long experience,
he was putting on the starched shirt-front which was a part of his
uniform on duty, and buttoning the studs. Stooping and squinting in the
small mirror that was hung absurdly low on the wall, he said
half-absently:</p>

<p>"So you're goin' to run out on me and the two blondes? You can't
take it, hunh?"</p>

<p>"Ah-h," said old John with a return to his surly dryness, "you don't
know what you're talkin' about. I had more girls in my day than you
ever thought of."</p>

<p>"Yeah?" said Herbert.</p>

<p>"Yeah," said John. "I had blondes and brunettes and every other
kind."</p>

<p>"Never had any red-heads, did you, Pop?" said Herbert, grinning.
"Yeah, I had red-heads, too," said John sourly. "More than you had,
anyway."</p>

<p>"Just a rounder, hunh?" said Herbert. "Just an old
petticoat-chaser."</p>

<p>"Nah-h, I ain't no rounder or no petticoat-chaser. Hm!" John grunted
contemptuously. "I've been a married man for forty years. I got
grown-up children older'n you are!"</p>

<p>"Why, you old two-timer!" Herbert exclaimed, and turned on him with
mock indignation. "Braggin' to me about your blondes and red-heads, and
then boastin' that you're a family man! Why, you----"</p>

<p>"Nah-h," said John, "I never done no such thing. I wasn't talkin'
about now--but <i>then!</i> That's when I had 'em--forty years
ago."</p>

<p>"Who?" said Herbert innocently. "Your wife and children?"</p>

<p>"Ah-h," said John disgustedly, "get along with you. You ain't goin'
to get my <i>goat</i>. I've forgot more about life than you ever heard
of, so don't think you're goin' to make a monkey out of me with your
smart talk."</p>

<p>"Well, you're makin' a big mistake this time, Pop," said Herbert
with an accent of regret. He had drawn on the neat grey trousers of his
uniform, adjusted his broad white stock, and now, half squatting before
the mirror, he was carefully adjusting the coat about his well-set
shoulders. "Wait till you see 'em--these two blondes. I picked one of
'em out just for you."</p>

<p>"Well, you needn't pick out any for me," said John sourly. "I got no
time for such foolishness."</p>

<p>At this point Henry, 'the night doorman, came hurriedly in from the
stairway and began rattling the key in his locker door.</p>

<p>"What do you say, pal?" Herbert turned to him and cried
boisterously. "I leave it to you. Here I get Pop all dated up with a
couple of hot blondes and he runs out on me. Is that treatin' a guy
right or not?"</p>

<p>Henry did not answer. His face was hard and white and narrow, his
eyes had the look and colour of blue agate, and he never smiled. He
took off his coat and hung it in the locker.</p>

<p>"Where were you?" he said.</p>

<p>Herbert looked at him, startled.</p>

<p>"Where was I <i>when?</i>" he said.</p>

<p>"Last night."</p>

<p>"That was my night off," said Herbert.</p>

<p>"It wasn't <i>our</i> night off," said Henry. "We had a meetin'.
They was askin' about you." He turned and directed his cold eyes
towards the old man. "And you, too," he said in a hard tone. "You
didn't show up either."</p>

<p>Old John's face had frozen. He had shifted his position and begun to
drum nervously and impatiently with his old fingers upon the side of
the elevator. This quick, annoyed tapping betrayed his tension, but his
eyes were flinty as he returned Henry's look, and there was no
mistaking his dislike of the doorman. Theirs was, in fact, the mutual
hostility that is instinctive to two opposite types of personality.</p>

<p>"Oh yeah?" John said in a hard voice.</p>

<p>Henry answered briefly: "Yeah." And then, holding his cold look
levelled like a pointed pistol, he said: "You come to the union
meetin's like everybody else, see? Or you'll get bounced out. You may
be an old man, but that goes for you like it does for all the
rest."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" said John sarcastically.</p>

<p>"Yeah, that's so." His tone was flat and final.</p>

<p>"Jesus!" Herbert's face was red with crestfallen embarrassment, and
he stammered out an excuse. "I forgot all about it--honest I did! I was
just goin'----"</p>

<p>"Well, you're not supposed to forget," said Henry harshly, and he
looked at Herbert with an accusing eye.</p>

<p>"I--I'm all up on my dues," said Herbert feebly.</p>

<p>"That ain't the question. We ain't talkin' about dues." For the
first time there was indignant passion in the hard voice as he went on
earnestly: "Where the hell do you suppose we'd be if everybody ran out
on us every time we hold a meetin'? What's the use of anything if we
ain't goin' to stick together?"</p>

<p>He was silent now, looking almost sullenly at Herbert, whose red
face had the hang-dog air of a guilty schoolboy. But when Henry spoke
again his tone was gentler and more casual, and somehow it suggested
that underneath his hard exterior he had a genuine affection for his
errant comrade.</p>

<p>"I guess it's O.K. this time," he said quietly. "I told the guys you
had a cold and I'd get you there next time."</p>

<p>He said nothing more, and began swiftly to take off his clothes.</p>

<p>Herbert looked flustered but relieved. For a moment he seemed about
to speak, but changed his mind. He stooped and took a final appraising
look at himself in the small mirror, and then, walking quickly towards
the elevator with a return of his former buoyancy, he said:</p>

<p>"Well, Pop, O.K.--let's go!" He took his place in the car and went
on with a simulation of regret: "Too bad you're goin' to miss out on
the blondes, Pop. But maybe you'll change your mind when you get a look
at 'em."</p>

<p>"No, I won't change my mind, neither," said John with sour
implacability as he slammed the door. "About them or about you."</p>

<p>Herbert looked at the old man and laughed, the pink spots in his
cheeks flushed with good humour, his lively eyes dancing.</p>

<p>"So that's the kind of guy you think I am?" he said, and gently
poked the old fellow in the ribs with his closed fist. "So you don't
believe me, hunh?"</p>

<p>"Ah-h, I wouldn't believe you on a stack of bibles," said John
grouchily. He pushed the lever forwards and the elevator started up.
"You're a lot of talk--that's what you are. I don't listen to anything
you say:" He stopped the elevator and opened the heavy door.</p>

<p>"So that's the kind of friend you are?" said Herbert, stepping out
into the corridor. Full of himself, full of delight with his own
humour, he winked at two pretty, rosy-cheeked Irish maids who were
waiting to go up, and, jerking his thumb towards the old man, he said:
"What are you goin' to do with a guy like this, anyway? I go and get
him all dated up with a blonde and he won't believe me when I tell him
so. He calls me a big wind."</p>

<p>"Yeah, that's what he is," said the old man grimly to the smiling
girls. "He's a lot of wind. He's always talkin' about his girls and I
bet he never had a girl in his life. If he saw a blonde he'd run like a
rabbit."</p>

<p>"Just a pal!" said Herbert with mock bitterness, appealing to the
maids. "O.K., then, Pop. Have it your own way. But when those blondes
get here, tell 'em to wait till I come back. You hear?"</p>

<p>"Well, you'd better not be bringin' any of 'em round here," said
John. He shook his white, head doggedly and his whole manner was
belligerent, but it was evident that he was enjoying himself hugely. "I
don't want any of 'em comin' in this building--blondes or brunettes or
red-heads or any of 'em," he muttered. "If they do, you won't find 'em
when you come back. I'll tell 'em to get out. I'll handle 'em for you,
all right."</p>

<p>"<i>He's</i> a friend of mine!" said Herbert bitterly to the two
girls, and jerked his thumb towards the old man again. He started to
walk away.</p>

<p>"I don't believe you, anyhow," John called after his retreating
figure. "You ain't got no blondes. You never did have...You're a
momma's boy!" he cried triumphantly as an afterthought, as if he had
now hit upon the happiest inspiration of the evening. "That's what you
are!"</p>

<p>Herbert paused at the door leading into the main corridor and looked
back menacingly at the old man, but the look was belied by the sparkle
in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh yeah?" he shouted.</p>

<p>He stood and glared fiercely at the old fellow for a moment, then
winked at the two girls, passed through the door, and pressed the
button of the passenger elevator, whose operator he was to relieve for
the night.</p>

<p>"That fellow's just a lot of talk," said John sourly as the maids
stepped into the service car and he closed the door. "Always gassin'
about the blondes he's goin' to bring round--but I ain't never seen
none of 'em. Nah-h!" he muttered scornfully, almost to himself as the
car started up. "He lives with his mother up in the Bronx, and he'd be
scared stiff if a girl ever looked at him."</p>

<p>"Still, Herbert ought to have a girl," one of the maids said in a
practical tone of voice. "Herbert's a nice boy, John."</p>

<p>"Oh, he's all right, I guess," the old man muttered grudgingly. "And
a nice-looking boy, too," the other maid now said.</p>

<p>"Oh, he'll do," said John; and then abruptly: "What are you folks
doin' to-night, anyway? There's a whole lot of packages waitin' to come
up."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Jack is having a big party," one of the girls said. "And,
John, will you bring everything up as soon as you can? There may be
something there that we need right away."</p>

<p>"Well," he said in that half-belligerent, half-unwilling tone that
was an inverted attribute of his real good nature. "I'll do the best I
can. Seems like all of them are givin' their big parties to-night," he
grumbled. "It goes on sometimes here till two or three o'clock in the
morning. You'd think all some people had to do was give parties all the
time. It'd take a whole regiment of men just to carry up the packages.
Yeah!" he muttered to himself. "And what d'you get? If you ever got so
much as a word of thanks----"</p>

<p>"Oh, John," one of the girls now said reproachfully, "you know Mrs.
Jack is not like that! You know yourself----"</p>

<p>"Oh, she's all right, I reckon," said John, unwillingly as before,
yet his tone had softened imperceptibly. "If all of them was like her,"
he began--but then the memory of the panhandler came back to him, and
he went on angrily: "She's too kind-hearted for her own good! Them
panhandling bums--they swarm round her like flies every time she leaves
the building. I saw one the other night get a dollar out of her before
she'd gone twenty feet. She's crazy to put up with it. I'm goin' to
tell her so, too, when I see her!"</p>

<p>The old man's face was flushed with outrage at the memory. He had
opened the door on the service landing, and now, as the girls stepped
out, he muttered to himself again:</p>

<p>"The kind of people we got here oughtn't to have to put up with
it...Well, then, I'll see," he said concedingly, as one of the maids
unlocked the service door and went in. "I'll get the stuff up to
you."</p>

<p>For a second or two after the inner door had closed behind the
maids, the old man stood there looking at it--just a dull, blank sheet
of painted metal with the apartment number on it--and his glance, had
anyone seen it, would somehow have conveyed an impression of
affectionate regard. Then he closed the elevator door and started
down.</p>

<p>Henry, the doorman, was just coming up the basement stairway as the
old man reached the ground floor. Uniformed, ready for his night's
work, he passed the service elevator without speaking. John called to
him.</p>

<p>"If they try to deliver any packages out front," he said, "you send
'em round here."</p>

<p>Henry turned and looked at the old man unsmilingly, and said curtly:
"What?"</p>

<p>"I say," repeated John, raising his voice a trifle shrilly, for the
man's habitual air of sullen harshness angered him, "if they try to
make any deliveries out front, send 'em back to the service
entrance."</p>

<p>Henry continued to look at him without speaking, and the old man
added:</p>

<p>"The Jacks are givin' a party to-night. They asked me to get
everything up in a hurry. If there are any more deliveries, send 'em
back here."</p>

<p>"Why?" said Henry in his flat, expressionless voice, still staring
at him.</p>

<p>The question, with its insolent suggestion of defied
authority--<i>someone's</i> authority, his own, the management's, or
the authority of "the kind of people we got here"--infuriated the old
man. A wave of anger, hot and choking, welled up in him, and before he
could control himself he rasped out:</p>

<p>"Because that's where they ought to come--that's why! Haven't you
been workin' around places of this kind long enough to know how to do?
Don't you know the kind of people we got here don't want every Tom,
Dick, and Harry with a package to deliver runnin' up in the front
elevator all the time, mixin' in with all the people in the house?"</p>

<p>"Why?" said Henry with deliberate insolence. "Why don't they?"</p>

<p>"Because," old John shouted, his face now crimson, "if you ain't got
sense enough to know that much, you ought to quit and get a job diggin'
ditches somewhere! You're bein' paid to know it! That's part of your
job as doorman in a house like this! If you ain't got sense enough by
now to do what you're supposed to do, you'd better quit--that's
why!--and give your job to somebody who knows what it's all about!"</p>

<p>Henry just looked at him with eyes that were as hard and emotionless
as two chunks of agate. Then:</p>

<p>"Listen," he said in a toneless voice. "You know what's goin' to
happen to you if you don't watch out? You're gettin' old, Pop, and
you'd better watch your step. You're goin' to be caught in the street
some day worryin' about what's goin' to happen to the people in this
place if they have to ride up in the same elevator with a delivery boy.
You're goin' to worry about them gettin' contaminated because they got
to ride up in the same car with some guy that carries a package. And
you know what's goin' to happen, to you, Pop? I'll tell you what's
goin' to happen. You'll be worryin' about it so much that you ain't
goin' to notice where you're goin'. And you're goin' to get hit,
see?"</p>

<p>The voice was so unyielding in its toneless savagery that for a
moment--just for a moment--the old man felt himself trembling all over.
And the voice went on:</p>

<p>"You're goin' to get hit, Pop. And it ain't goin' to be by nothin'
small or cheap. It ain't goin' to be by no Ford truck or by no
taxi-cab. You're goin' to get hit by somethin' big and shiny that cost
a lot of dough. You'll get hit by at least a Rolls Royce. And I hope it
belongs to one of the people in this house. You'll die like any other
worm, but I want you to push off knowin' that it was done expensive--by
a big Rolls Royce--by one of the people in this house. I just want you
to be happy, Pop."</p>

<p>Old John's face was purple. The veins in his forehead stood out like
corded ropes. He tried to speak, but no words came. At length, all else
having failed him, he managed to choke out the one retort which, in all
its infinitely variable modulations, always served perfectly to convey
his emotions.</p>

<p>"Oh yeah!" he snarled dryly, and this time the words were loaded
with implacable and unforgiving hate.</p>

<p>"Yeah!" said Henry tonelessly, and walked off.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="chapter2-14"></a>14. Zero Hour</h2>

<p>Mrs. Jack came from her room a little after eight o'clock and walked
along the broad hallway that traversed her big apartment from front to
rear. Her guests had been invited for half-past eight, but long
experience in these matters told her that the party would not be going
at full swing until after nine. As she walked along the corridor at a
brisk and rapid little step she felt a tense excitement, not
unpleasurable, even though it was now sharpened by the tincture of an
apprehensive doubt.</p>

<p>Would all be ready? Had she forgotten anything? Had the girls
followed her instructions? Or had they slipped up somewhere? Would
something now be lacking?</p>

<p>A wrinkled line appeared between her eyes, and unconsciously she
began to slip the old ring on and off her finger with a quick movement
of her small hand. It was the gesture of an alert and highly able
person who had come to have an instinctive mistrust of other people
less gifted than herself. There was impatience and some scorn in it, a
scorn not born of arrogance or any lack of warm humanity, but one that
was inclined to say a trifle sharply: "Yes, yes, I know! I understand
all that. There's no need telling me that kind of thing. Let's get to
the point. What can you do? What have you done? Can I depend on you to
do everything that's necessary?" So, as she walked briskly down the
hall, thoughts too sharp and quick for definition were darting across
the surface of her mind like flicks of light upon a pool.</p>

<p>"I wonder if the girls remembered to do everything I told them," she
was thinking. "Oh, Lord! If only Nora hasn't started drinking
again!--And Janie! She's good as gold, of course, but God, she is a
fool!--And Cookie! Well, she can cook, but after that she doesn't know
April from July. And if you try to tell her anything she gets flustered
and begins to gargle German at you. Then it's worse than if you'd never
spoken to her at all.--As for May--well, all you can do is to hope and
pray." The line between her troubled eyes deepened, and the ring
slipped on and off her finger more rapidly than ever. "You'd think
they'd realise how well off they are, and what a good life they lead
here! You'd think they'd try to show it!" she thought indignantly. But
almost instantly she was touched with a feeling of tender
commiseration, and her mind veered back into its more usual channel:
"Oh, well, poor things! I suppose they do the best they can. All you
can do is to reconcile yourself to it--and realise that the only way
you can get anything done right is to do it yourself."</p>

<p>By this time she had reached the entrance to the living-room and was
looking quickly about, assuring herself by a moment's swift inspection
that everything was in its proper place. Her examination pleased her.
The worried expression about her eyes began to disappear. She slipped
the ring back on her hand and let it stay there, and her face began to
take on the satisfied look of a child when it regards in silence some
object of its love and self-creation and finds it good.</p>

<p>The big room was ready for the party. It was just quietly the way
she always liked to have it. The room was so nobly proportioned as to
be almost regal, and yet it was so subtly toned by the labour of her
faultless taste that whatever forbidding coldness its essential
grandeur may have had was utterly subdued. To a stranger this
living-room would have seemed not only homelike in its comfortable
simplicity, but even, on closer inspection, a trifle shabby. Almost
everything in it was somewhat worn. The coverings of some of the chairs
and couches had become in places threadbare. The carpet that covered
the floor with its pattern of old, faded green showed long use without
apology. An antique gate-legged table sagged a little under the weight
of its pleasant shaded lamp and its stacks of books and magazines. Upon
the mantel, a creamy slab of marble, itself a little stained and worn,
was spread a green and faded strip of Chinese silk, and on top of it
was a lovely little figure in green jade, its carved fingers lifted in
a Chinese attitude of compassionating mercy. Over the mantel hung a
portrait of herself in her young loveliness at twenty, which a painter
now dead and famous had made long ago.</p>

<p>On three sides of the room, bookshelves extended a third of the way
up the walls, and they were crowded with friendly volumes whose backs
bore the markings of warm human hands. Obviously they had been read and
read again. The stiff sets of tooled and costly bindings that often
ornament the libraries of the rich with unread awe were lacking here.
Nor was there any evidence of the greedy and revolting mania of the
professional collector. If there were first editions on these
utilitarian shelves, they were here because their owner had bought them
when they were published, and bought them to be read.</p>

<p>The crackling pine logs on the great marble hearth cast their
radiance warmly on the covers of these worn books, and Mrs. Jack had a
sense of peace and comfort as she looked at the rich and homely compact
of their colours. She saw her favourite novels and histories, plays,
poems, and biographies, and the great books of decoration and design,
of painting, drawing, and architecture, which she had assembled in a
crowded lifetime of work, travel, and living. Indeed, all these
objects, these chairs and tables, these jades and silks, all the
drawings and paintings, as well as the books, had been brought together
at different times and places and fused into a miracle of harmony by
the instinctive touch of this woman's hand. It is no wonder, therefore,
that her face softened and took on an added glow of loveliness as she
looked at her fine room. The like of it, as she well knew, could
nowhere else be found.</p>

<p>"Ah, here it is," she thought. "It is living like a part of me. And
God! How beautiful it is!" she thought. "How warm--how true! It's not
like a rented place--not just another room in an apartment. No"--she
glanced down the spacious width of the long hall--"if it weren't for
the elevator there, you'd think it was some grand old house.' I don't
know--but--" a little furrow, this time of reflectiveness and effort,
came between her eyes as she tried to shape her meaning--"there's
something sort of grand--and simple--about it all."</p>

<p>And indeed there was. The amount of simplicity that could be
purchased even in, those times for a yearly rental of fifteen thousand
dollars was quite considerable. As if this very thought had found an
echo in her mind, she went on:</p>

<p>"I mean when you compare it with some of these places that you see
nowadays--some of the God-awful places where all those rich people
live. There's simply no comparison! I don't care how rich they are,
there's--there's just something here that money cannot buy."</p>

<p>As her mind phrased the accusing words about "the God-awful places
where all those rich people live," her nostrils twitched and her face
took on an expression of sharp scorn. For Mrs. Jack had always been
contemptuous of wealth. Though she was the wife of a rich man and had
not known for years the economic necessity of work, yet it was one of
her unshakable convictions that she and her family could not possibly
be described as "rich". "Oh, not <i>really</i>," she would say. "Not
the way people are who really <i>are</i>." And she would look for
confirmation, not at the hundred and thirty million people there
impossibly below her in the world's hard groove, but at the fabulous
ten thousand who were above her on the moneyed heights, and who, by the
comparison, were "really rich".</p>

<p>Besides, she was "a worker". She had always been "a worker". One
look at the strength, the grace, the swiftness of those small, sure
hands were enough to tell the story of their owner's life, which had
always been a life of work. From that accomplishment stemmed deep pride
and the fundamental integrity of her soul. She had needed the benefit
of no man's purse, the succour of no man's shielding strength. "Is not
my help within me?" Well, hers was. She had made her own way. She had
supported herself. She had created beautiful and enduring things. She
had never known the meaning of laziness. Therefore it is no wonder that
she never thought of herself as being "rich". She was a worker; she had
worked.</p>

<p>But now, satisfied with her inspection of the big room, she turned
quickly to investigate other things. The living room gave on the
dining-room through glass doors, which were closed and curtained
filmily. Mrs. Jack moved towards them and threw them open. Then she
stopped short, and one hand flew to her bosom. She gasped out an
involuntary little "Oh!" of wonder and delight. It was too beautiful!
It was quite too beautiful! But it was just the way she expected it to
look--the way it looked for all of her parties. None the less, every
time she saw it, it was like a grand and new discovery.</p>

<p>Everything had been arranged to perfection. The great dining table
glowed faultlessly, like a single sheet of walnut light. In its centre,
on a doily of thick lace, stood a large and handsome bowl blossoming
with a fragrant harvest of cut flowers. At the four corners, in orderly
array, there were big stacks of Dresden plates and gleaming rows of old
and heavy English silver, knives and forks and spoons. The ancient
Italian chairs had been drawn away and placed against the walls. This
was to be a buffet supper. The guests could come and help themselves
according to their taste, and on that noble table was everything to
tempt even the most jaded palate.</p>

<p>Upon an enormous silver trencher at one end there was a mighty roast
of beef, crisply browned all over. It had just been "begun on" at one
side, for a few slices had been carved away to leave the sound, rare
body of the roast open to the inspection of anyone who might be
attracted by its juicy succulence. At the opposite end, upon another
enormous trencher, and similarly carved, was a whole Virginia Ham,
sugar-cured and baked and stuck all over with pungent cloves. In
between and all round was a staggering variety of mouth-watering
delicacies. There were great bowls of mixed green salads, and others of
chicken salad, crab meat, and the pink, milky firmness of lobster
claws, removed whole and perfect from their shells. There were platters
containing golden slabs of smoked salmon, the most rare and delicate
that money could buy. There were dishes piled with caviar, both black
and red, and countless others loaded with <i>hors d'oeuvres</i>--with
mushrooms, herring, anchovies, sardines, and small, toothsome
artichokes, with pickled onions and with pickled beets, with sliced
tomatoes and with devilled eggs, with walnuts, almonds, and pecans,
with olives and with celery. In short, there was almost everything that
anyone could desire.</p>

<p>It was a gargantuan banquet. It was like some great vision of a
feast that has been made immortal in legendry. Few "rich" people would
have dared venture on a "supper" such as this of Mrs. Jack's, and in
this fear of venturing they would have been justified. Only Mrs. Jack
could do a thing like this; only she could do it right. And that is why
her parties were famous, and why everyone who had been invited always
came. For, strange to tell, there was nowhere on that lavish board a
suggestion of disorder or excess. That table was a miracle of planning
and of right design. Just as no one could look at it and possibly want
anything to be added, so could no one here have felt that there was a
single thing too much.</p>

<p>And everywhere in that great dining-room, with its simplicity and
strength, there was evident this same faultless taste, this same style
that never seemed to be contrived, that was so casual and so gracious
and so right. At one side the great buffet glittered with an array of
flasks, decanters, bottle, syphons, and tall glasses, thin as shells.
Elsewhere, two lovely Colonial cupboards stood like Graces with their
splendid wares of china and of porcelain, of cut-glass and of silver,
of grand old plates and cups and saucers, tureens and bowls, jars and
pitchers.</p>

<p>After a quick, satisfied appraisal of everything, Mrs. Jack walked
rapidly across the room and through the swinging door that led to the
pantry and the kitchen and the servants' quarters. As she approached,
she could hear the laughter and excited voices of the maids, broken by
the gutturally mixed phrases of the cook. She burst upon a scene of
busy order and of readiness. The big, tiled kitchen was as clean and
spotless as a hospital laboratory. The great range with its marvellous
hood, itself as large as those one sees in a big restaurant, looked as
if it had been freshly scrubbed and oiled and polished. The vast
company of copper cooking vessels--the skillets and kettles, the pots
and pans of every size and shape, from those just large enough to hold
an egg to those so huge it seemed that one might cook in them the
rations of a regiment--had been scoured and rubbed until Mrs. Jack
cloud see her face in them. The big table in the centre of the room was
white enough to have served in a surgeon's office, and the shelves,
drawers, cupboards, and bins looked as if they had just been gone over
with sandpaper. Above the voices of the girls brooded the curiously
quiet, intent, dynamic hum of the mammoth electric refrigerator, which
in its white splendour was like a jewel.</p>

<p>"Oh, this!" thought Mrs. Jack. "This is quite the most perfect thing
of all! This is the best room in the house! I love the others--but is
there anything in the world so grand and beautiful as a fine kitchen?
And how Cookie keeps the place! If I could only paint it! But no--it
would take a Breughel to do it! There's no one nowadays to do it
justice----"</p>

<p>"Oh, Cookie!" Now she spoke the words aloud. "What a lovely
cake!"</p>

<p>Cook looked up from the great layer cake on the table to which she
had been adding the last prayerful tracery of frosted icing, and a
faint smile illuminated the gaunt, blunt surface of her Germanic
face.</p>

<p>"You like him, yes?" said Cook. "You think he is nice?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Cook!" cried Mrs. Jack in a tone of such childlike earnestness
that Cook smiled this time a little more broadly than before. "It is
the most <i>beautiful</i>--the most <i>wonderful</i>!--" She turned
away with a comical shrug of despair as if words failed her.</p>

<p>Cook laughed gutturally with satisfaction, and Nora, smiling,
said:</p>

<p>"Yes, Mrs. Jack, that it is! It's just what I was after tellin' her
meself."</p>

<p>Mrs. Jack glanced swiftly at Nora and saw with relief that she was
clean and plain and sober. Thank heaven she had pulled herself
together! She hadn't taken another drink since morning--that was easy
to see. Drink worked on her like poison, and you could tell the moment
that she'd had a single one.</p>

<p>Janie and May, passing back and forth between the kitchen and the
maid's sitting-room in their trim, crisp uniforms and with their
smiling pink faces, were really awfully pretty. Everything had turned
out perfectly, better than she could possibly have expected. Nothing
had been forgotten. Everything was in readiness. It ought to be a
glorious party.</p>

<p>At this moment the buzzer sounded sharply. Mrs. Jack looked startled
and said quickly:</p>

<p>"The door-bell rang, Janie." Then, almost to herself: "Now who do
you suppose--?"</p>

<p>"Yes'm," said Janie, coming to the door of the maids' sitting-room.
"I'll go, Mrs. Jack."</p>

<p>"Yes, you'd better, Janie. I wonder who--" she cast a puzzled look
up at the clock on the wall, and then at the little shell of platinum
on her wrist. "It's only eight-fifteen! I can't think any of them would
be this early. Oh!"--as illumination came--"I think, perhaps, it's Mr.
Logan. If it is, Janie, show him in. I'll be right out."</p>

<p>"Yes, Mrs. Jack," said Janie, and departed.</p>

<p>And Mrs. Jack, after another quick look about the kitchen, another
smile of thanks and approbation for Cookie and her arts, followed
her.</p>

<p>It was Mr. Logan. Mrs. Jack encountered him in the entrance hall
where he had just paused to set down two enormous black suitcases, each
of which, from the bulging look of them, carried enough weight to
strain strong muscles. Mr. Logan's own appearance confirmed this
impression. He had seized the biceps of one muscular arm with the
fingers of his other hand, and with a rueful look upon his face was
engaged in flexing the aching member up and down. As Mrs. Jack
approached he turned, a thickset, rather burly-looking young man of
about thirty, with bushy eyebrows of a reddish cast, a round and heavy
face smudged ruddily with the shaven grain of his beard, a low,
corrugated forehead, and a bald head gleaming with perspiration, which
he proceeded to mop with his handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Gosh!" said Mr. Piggy Logan, for by this affectionate title was he
known to his more intimate acquaintance. "Gosh!"--the expletive came
out again, somewhat windy with relief. At the same time he released his
aching arm and offered his hostess a muscular and stubby hand, covered
thickly on the back up to the very fingernails with large freckles.</p>

<p>"You must be simply dead!" cried Mrs. Jack. "Why didn't you let me
know you had so much to carry? I'd have sent a chauffeur. He could have
handled everything for you."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's quite all right," said Piggy Logan. "I always manage
everything myself. You see, I carry all of it right here--my whole
equipment." He indicated the two ponderous cases. "That's it," he said,
"everything I use--the whole show. So naturally," he smiled at her
quickly and quite boyishly, "I don't like to take any chances. It's all
I've got. If anything went wrong--well, I'd just rather do it myself
and then I know where I am."</p>

<p>"I know," said Mrs. Jack, nodding her head with quick understanding.
"You simply can't depend on others. If anything went wrong--and after
all the years you must have put in making them! People who've seen it
say it's simply marvellous," she went on. "Everyone is so thrilled to
know you're going to be here. We've heard so much about it--really all
you hear around New York these days is----"</p>

<p>"Now--" said Mr. Logan abruptly, in a manner that was still
courteous but that indicated he was no longer paying any attention to
her. He had become all business, and now he walked over to the entrance
of the living-room and was looking all about with thoughtful
speculation. "I suppose it's going to be in here, isn't it?" he
said.</p>

<p>"Yes--that is, if you like it here. If you prefer, we'll use another
room, but this is the largest one we have."</p>

<p>"No, thank you," crisply, absently. "This is quite all right. This
will do very nicely...Hm!" meditatively, as he pressed his full lower
lip between two freckled fingers. "Best place, I should think, would be
over there," he indicated the opposite wall, "facing the door here, the
people all round on the other three sides...Hm! Yes...Just about the
centre there, I should think, posters on the bookshelves...We can clear
all this stuff away, of course," he make a quick but expansive gesture
with his hand which seemed to dispose of a large part of the
furnishings. "Yes! That ought to do it very well!...Now, if you don't
mind," he turned to her rather peremptorily and said: "I'll have to
change to costume. If you have a room----"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," she answered quickly, "here, just down the hall, the
first room on the right. But won't you have a drink and something to
eat before you start? You must be terribly----"</p>

<p>"No, thank you," said Mr. Logan crisply. "It's very nice of you," he
smiled swiftly under his bushy brows, "but I never take anything before
a performance. Now"--he crouched, gripped the handles of the big cases,
and heaved mightly--"if you'll just--excuse me," he grunted.</p>

<p>"Is there anything we can do?" Mrs. Jack asked helpfully.</p>

<p>"No--thank you--nothing," Mr. Logan somewhat gruntingly replied, and
began to stagger down the hall with his tremendous freight. "I can--get
along--quite nicely--thank you," he grunted as he staggered through the
door of the room to which she had directed him; and then, more faintly:
"Nothing--at all."</p>

<p>She heard the two ponderous bags hit the floor with a leaden thump,
and then Mr. Logan's long, expiring "Whush!" of exhausted relief.</p>

<p>For a moment after the young man's lurching departure, his hostess
continued to look after him with a somewhat dazed expression, touched
faintly with alarm. His businesslike dispatch and the nonchalance with
which he had suggested widespread alterations in her beloved room
filled her with vague apprehension. But--she shook her head and
reassured herself with sharp decision--it was bound to be all right.
She had heard so many people speak of him: he was really all the rage
this year, everyone was talking of his show, there had been write-ups
of him everywhere. He was the darling of all the smart society
crowd--all those "rich" Long Island and Park Avenue people. Here the
lady's nostrils curved again in a faint dilation of patronising scorn;
nevertheless, she could not help feeling a pleasant sense of triumph
that she had landed him.</p>

<p>Yes, Mr. Piggy Logan was the rage that year. He was the creator of a
puppet circus of wire dolls, and the applause with which this curious
entertainment had been greeted was astonishing. Not to be able to
discuss him and his little dolls intelligently was, in smart circles,
akin to never having heard of Jean Cocteau or Surrealism; it was like
being completely at a loss when such names as Picasso and Brancusi and
Utrillo and Gertrude Stein were mentioned. Mr. Piggy Logan and his art
were spoken of with the same animated reverence that the knowing used
when they spoke of one of these.</p>

<p>And, like all of these, Mr. Piggy Logan and his art demanded their
own vocabulary. To speak of them correctly one must know a language
whose subtle nuances were becoming more highly specialised month by
month, as each succeeding critic outdid his predecessor and delved
deeper into the bewildering complexities, the infinite shadings and
associations, of Mr. Piggy Logan and his circus of wire dolls.</p>

<p>True, at the beginning there had been those among the
cognoscenti--those happy pioneers who had got in at the very start of
Mr. Piggy Logan's vogue--who had characterised his performance as
"frightfully amusing". But that was old stuff, and anyone who now dared
to qualify Mr. Logan's art with such a paltry adjective as "amusing"
was instantly dismissed as a person of no cultural importance. Mr.
Logan's circus had ceased to be "amusing" when one of the more
sophisticated columnists of the daily press discovered that "not since
the early Chaplin has the art of tragic humour through the use of
pantomime reached such a faultless elevation."</p>

<p>After this, the procession formed on the right, and each newcomer
paid his tribute with a new and more glittering coin. The articles in
the daily press were followed by others in all the smarter
publications, with eulogistic essays on Mr. Logan and pictures of his
little dolls. Then the dramatic critics joined the chorus, and held up
the offerings of the current stage to a withering fire of comparative
criticism. The leading tragedians of the theatre were instructed to pay
special attention to Mr. Logan's clown before they next essayed the
role of Hamlet.</p>

<p>The solemn discussions broke out everywhere. Two eminent critics
engaged in a verbal duel of such adeptive subtlety that in the end it
was said there were not more than seven people in the civilised world
who could understand the final passages at arms. The central issue of
this battle was to establish whether Mr. Piggy Logan, in his
development, had been influenced more by the geometric cubism of the
early Picasso or by the geometric abstractions of Brancusi. Both
schools of thought had their impassioned followers, but it was finally
conceded that the Picassos had somewhat the better of it.</p>

<p>One word from Mr. Logan himself might have settled the controversy,
but that word was never spoken. Indeed, he said very little about the
hubbub he had caused. As more than one critic significantly pointed
out, he had "the essential simplicity of the great artist--an almost
childlike <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> of speech and gesture that pierces
straight to the heart of reality." Even his life, his previous history,
resisted investigations of the biographers with the impenetrability of
the same baffling simplicity. Or, as another critic clearly phrased it:
"As in the life of almost all great men of art, there is little in
Logan's early years to indicate his future achievement. Like almost all
supremely great men, he developed slowly--and, it might almost be said,
unheeded--up to the time when he burst suddenly, like a blazing light,
upon the public consciousness."</p>

<p>However that may be, Mr. Piggy Logan's fame was certainly blazing
now, and an entire literature in the higher aesthetics had been created
about him and his puppets. Critical reputations had been made or ruined
by them. The last criterion of fashionable knowingness that year was an
expert familiarity with Mr. Logan and his dolls. If one lacked this
knowledge, he was lower than the dust. If one had it, his
connoisseurship in the arts was definitely established and his
eligibility for any society of the higher sensibilities was instantly
confirmed.</p>

<p>To a future world--inhabited, no doubt, by a less acute and
understanding race of men--all this may seem a trifle strange. If so,
that will be because the world of the future will have forgotten what
it was like to live in 1929.</p>

<p>In that sweet year of grace one could admit with utter nonchalance
that the late John Milton bored him and was a large "stuffed shirt".
"Stuffed shirts", indeed, were numerous in the findings of the critical
gentry of the time. The chemises of such inflated personalities as
Goethe, Ibsen, Byron, Tolstoy, Whitman, Dickens, and Balzac had been
ruthlessly investigated by some of the most fearless intellects of the
day and found to be largely filled with straw wadding. Almost
everything and everybody was in the process of being debunked--except
the debunkers and Mr. Piggy Logan and his dolls.</p>

<p>Life had recently become too short for many things that people had
once found time for. Life was simply too short for the perusal of any
book longer than two hundred pages. As for <i>War and Peace</i>--no
doubt all "they" said of it was true--but as for oneself--well, one had
tried, and really it was quite too--too--oh, well, life simply was too
short. So life that year was far too short to be bothered by Tolstoy,
Whitman, Dreiser, or Dean Swift. But life was not too short that year
to be passionately concerned with Mr. Piggy Logan and his circus of
wire dolls.</p>

<p>The highest intelligences of the time--the very subtlest of the
chosen few--were bored by many things. They tilled the waste land, and
erosion had grown fashionable. They were bored with love, and they were
bored with hate. They were bored with men who worked, and with men who
loafed. They were bored with people who created something, and with
people who created nothing. They were bored with marriage, and with
single blessedness. They were bored with chastity, and they were bored
with adultery. They were bored with going abroad, and they were bored
with staying at home. They were bored with the great poets of the
world, whose great poems they had never read. They were bored with
hunger in the streets, with the men who were killed, with the children
who starved, and with the injustice, cruelty, and oppression all round
them; and they were bored with justice, freedom, and man's right to
live. They were bored with living, they were bored with dying,
but--they were <i>not</i> bored that year with Mr. Piggy Logan and his
circus of wire dolls.</p>

<p>And the Cause of all this tumult? The generating Force behind this
mighty sensation in the world of Art? As one of the critics so aptly
said: "It is a great deal more than just a new talent that has started
just another 'movement': it is rather a whole new universe of creation,
a whirling planet which in its fiery revolutions may be expected to
throw off its own sidereal systems." All right; <i>It</i>, then--the
colossal Genius which had started all this--what was It doing now?</p>

<p>It was now enjoying the privacy of one of the lovely rooms in Mrs.
Jack's apartment, and, as if It were utterly unaware of the huge
disturbance It had made in the great world, It was calmly, quietly,
modestly, prosaically, and matter-of-factly occupied in peeling off Its
own trousers and pulling on a pair of canvas pants.</p>

<p>While this momentous happening was taking place, events were moving
smoothly to their consummation in other quarters of the house. The
swinging door between the dining-room and the kitchen domain kept
slatting back and forth as the maids passed in and out to make the
final preparations for the feast. Janie came through the dining-room
bearing a great silver tray filled with bottles, decanters, a bowl of
ice, and tall, lovely glasses. As she set the tray down upon a table in
the living-room, the shell-thin glasses chimed together musically, and
there was a pleasant jink of bottles and the cold, clean rattle of
cracked ice.</p>

<p>Then the girl came over towards the hearth, removed the big brass
screen, and knelt before the dancing flames. As she jabbed at the logs
with a long brass poker and a pair of tongs there was a shower of fiery
sparks, and the fire blazed and crackled with new life. For just a
moment she stayed there on her knees in a gesture of sweet maiden
grace. The fire cast its radiance across her glowing face, and Mrs.
Jack looked at her with a softened glance, thinking how sweet and clean
and pretty she was. Then the maid arose and put the screen back in its
place.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jack was arranging anew a vase of long-stemmed roses on a small
table in the hall and glancing briefly at herself in the mirror above,
turned and walked briskly and happily down the broad, deep-carpeted
hallway towards her own room. Her husband was just coming from his
room. He was fully dressed for the evening. She looked him over with an
expert eye, and saw how well his clothes fit him and how he wore them
as if they had grown on him.</p>

<p>His manner, in contrast to hers, was calm and sophisticated, wise
and knowing. One knew just to look at him that he took excellent care
of himself. Here was a man, one felt, who, if he was experienced in the
pleasures of the flesh, knew how far to go, and beyond what point lay
chaos, shipwreck, and the reef. His wife, taking all this in with a
swift and comprehensive glance that missed nothing, despite her air of
half-bewildered innocence, was amazed to see how much he knew, and a
little troubled to think that he knew even more, perhaps, than she
could see or fathom.</p>

<p>"Oh, hello," he said, in a tone of suave courtesy as he bent and
kissed her lightly on one cheek.</p>

<p>For just the flick of an instant she was conscious of a feeling of
distaste, but then she remembered what a perfect husband he had been,
how thoughtful, how good, how devoted, and how, no matter what the
unfathomed implications of his eyes might be, he had said nothing--and
for all that anyone could prove, had seen nothing. "He's a sweet
person," she was thinking as she responded brightly to his
greeting:</p>

<p>"Oh, hello, darling. You're all ready, aren't you?...Listen"--she
spoke rapidly--"will you look out for the bell and take care of anyone
who comes? Mr. Logan is changing his costume in the guest room--won't
you look out for him if he needs anything? And see if Edith's ready.
And when the guests begin to come you can send the women to her room to
take off their wraps--oh, just tell Nora--she'll attend to it! And
you'll take care of the men yourself--won't you, dear? You can show
them back to your room. I'll be out in a few minutes. If only
everything!"--she began in a worried tone, slipping the ring quickly
from her finger and slipping it back again. "I do hope everything's all
right!"</p>

<p>"But <i>isn't</i> it?" he said blandly. "Haven't you looked?"</p>

<p>"Oh, everything looks perfect!" she cried. "It's really just too
beautiful! The girls have behaved wonderfully--only"--the little furrow
of nervous tension came between her eyes--"do keep an eye on them,
won't you, Fritz? You know how they are if somebody's not round.
Something's so likely to go wrong. So please do watch them, won't you,
dear? And look out for Mr. Logan. I do hope--" she paused with a look
of worried abstraction in her eyes.</p>

<p>"You do hope what?" he said pointedly, with just the suggestion of
an ironic grin round the corners of his mouth.</p>

<p>"I do hope he won't"--she began in a troubled tone, then went on
rapidly--"He said something about--about clearing away some of the
things in the living-room for his show." She looked at him rather
helplessly; then, catching the irony of his faint grin, she coloured
quickly and laughed richly. "God! I don't know what he's going to do.
He brought enough stuff with him to sink a battleship!...Still, I
suppose it's going to be all right. Everyone's been after him, you
know. Everyone's thrilled at the chance of seeing him. Oh, I'm sure
it'll be all right. Don't you think so--hah?"</p>

<p>She looked earnestly at him with an expression of such droll,
beseeching inquiry that, unmasked for a moment, he laughed abruptly as
he turned away, saying:</p>

<p>"Oh, I suppose so, Esther. I'll look after it."</p>

<p>Mrs. Jack went on down the hall, pausing just perceptibly as she
passed her daughter's door. She could hear the girl's voice, clear,
cool, and young, humming the jaunty strains of a popular tune:</p>

<p>"You're the cream in my coffee--you're the salt in my
stew-w----"</p>

<p>A little smile of love and tenderness suffused the woman's face as
she continued down the hall and entered the next door, which was her
own room.</p>

<p>It was a very simple, lovely room, hauntingly chaste, almost
needlessly austere. In the centre of one wall stood her narrow little
wooden bed, so small and plain and old that it seemed it might almost
have served as the bed of a medieval nun, as perhaps it had. Beside it
stood the little table with its few books, a telephone, a glass and a
silver pitcher, and in a silver frame a photograph of a girl in her
early twenties--Mrs. Jack's daughter, Alma.</p>

<p>Beside the door as one entered there was an enormous old wooden
wardrobe, which she had brought from Italy. This contained all her
beautiful dresses and her wonderful collection of winglike little
shoes, all of them made by hand to fit her perfect little feet. On the
opposite wall, facing the door, between two high windows, stood her
writing-desk. Between the bed and the windows there was a small
drawing-table. It was a single board of white, perfect wood, and on it,
arranged with faultless precision, were a dozen sharpened pencils, a
few feathery brushes, some crisp sheets of tracing paper on which
geometric designs were legible, a pot of paste, a ruler, and a little
jar of golden paint. Exactly above this table, hanging from the wall in
all the clean beauty of their strength and accuracy, were a triangle
and a square.</p>

<p>At the foot of the bed there was a chaise-longue covered with a
flowered pattern of old faded silk. There were a few simple drawings,
on the walls, and a single painting of a strange, exotic flower. It was
such a flower as never was, a dream flower which Mrs. Jack had painted
long ago.</p>

<p>Along the wall opposite the bed stood two old chests. One of them, a
product of the Pennsylvania Dutch, was carved and coloured in quaint
and cheerful patterns, and this contained old silks and laces and the
noble Indian saris which she often loved to wear. The other was an old
chest of drawers, with a few silver toilet articles and a square mirror
on its top.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jack crossed the room and stood before the mirror looking at
herself. First she bent forward a little and stared at her face long
and earnestly with an expression of childlike innocence. Then she began
to turn about, regarding herself from first one angle, then another.
She put her hand up to her temple and smoothed her brow. Obviously she
found herself good, for her eyes now took on an expression of rapt
complacency. There was open vanity in her look as she brooded with
smouldering fascination on the thick bracelet around her arm--a rich
and sombre chain of ancient India, studded with dull and curious gems.
She lifted her chin and looked at her neck,, tracing out with her
finger-tips the design of an old necklace which she wore. She surveyed
her smooth arms, her bare back, her gleaming shoulders, and the
outlines of her breasts and figure, touching, patting, and
half-unconsciously arranging with practiced touches the folds of her
simple, splendid gown.</p>

<p>She lifted her arm again and with hand extended, the other hand upon
her hip, she turned about once more in her orbit of self-worship.
Slowly she turned, still rapt in contemplation of her loveliness, then
she gasped suddenly with surprise and fright, and uttered a little
scream. Her hand flew to her throat in a gesture of alarm as she
realised that she was not alone and, looking up, saw her daughter
standing there.</p>

<p>The girl, young, slender, faultless, cold, and lovely, had entered
through the bathroom that connected the two rooms, and was standing in
the door, having paused there, frozen to immobility as she caught her
mother in the act. The mother's face went blood-red. For a long moment
the two women looked at each other, the mother utterly confused and
crimson with her guilt, the daughter cold and appraising with the irony
of sophisticated mirth. Then something quick and instant passed between
them in their glance.</p>

<p>Like one who has been discovered and who knows that there is nothing
more to say, the mother suddenly threw back her head and laughed, a
rich, full-throated, woman's yell of free acknowledgement, unknown to
the race of man.</p>

<p>"Well, Mother, was it good?" said the girl, now grinning faintly.
She walked over and kissed her.</p>

<p>Again the mother was shaken with her hysteria of helpless laughter.
Then both of them, freed from the necessity of argument by that
all-taking moment, were calm again.</p>

<p>Thus was enacted the whole tremendous comedy of womankind. No words
were needed. There was nothing left to say. All had been said there in
that voiceless instant of complete and utter understanding, of mutual
recognition and conspiracy. The whole universe of sex had been nakedly
revealed for just the flick of a second in all its guile and its
overwhelming humour. And the great city roared on unwittingly round
that secret cell, and no man in its many millions was any the wiser
about this primal force more strong than cities and as old as
earth.</p>

<h2><a name="chapter2-15"></a>15. The Party at Jack's</h2>

<p>Now the guests were beginning to arrive. The electric thring of the
door-bell broke sharply and persistently on accustomed quietness.
People were coming in and filling the place with the ease and
familiarity of old friends. In the hallway and in the rooms at the
front there arose now a confused medley of many voices--the rippling
laughter and quick, excited tones of the women mingled with the deeper,
more vibrant sonorities of the men. It was a mixture smooth as oil,
which fused and mounted steadily. With every sharp ringing of the bell,
with every opening and closing of the door, there were new voices and
new laughter, a babel of new greetings, new gaiety, and new
welcomes.</p>

<p>The whole place--all the rooms front to back--was now thrown open to
the party. In the hall, in the bedrooms, in the great living-room, and
in the dining-room, people were moving in and out, circulating
everywhere in beautiful and spontaneous patterns. Women were coming up
to Mrs. Jack and embracing her with the affectionate tenderness of old
friendship. Men, drawn together in solemn discussion or in the jesting
interplay of wit, were going in and out of Mr. Jack's room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jack, her eyes sparkling with joy, was moving about everywhere,
greeting people and stopping to talk to everyone. Her whole manner had
a quality of surprised delight, as of a person who feels that wonders
will never cease. Although she had invited all these people, she
seemed, as she spoke to each in turn, as if she was taken aback by the
happiness of an unexpected and unhoped-for encounter with an old friend
whom she had not seen for a long time. Her voice, as she talked, grew a
trifle higher with its excitement, even at times a little shrill, and
her face glowed with pleasure. And her guests smiled at her as people
smile at a happy and excited child.</p>

<p>Many were moving about now with glasses in their hands. Some were
leaning against walls talking to each other. Distinguished-looking men
were propped with their elbows on the mantel in the casual earnestness
of debate. Beautiful women with satiny backs were moving through the
crowd with velvet undulance. The young people were gathered together in
little parties of their own, drawn to one another by the magic of their
youth. Everywhere people were laughing and chattering, bending to fill
glasses with frosty drinks, or moving around the loaded temptations of
the dining-table and the great buffet with that "choosy" look, somewhat
perturbed and doubtful, which said plainly that they would like to
taste it all but knew they couldn't. And the smiling maids were there
to do their bidding, and to urge them to have just a little more. All
in all, it was a wonderful scene of white and black and gold and power
and wealth and loveliness and food and drink.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jack glanced happily through the crowded rooms. It was, she
knew, a notable assemblage of the best, the highest, and the fairest
the city had to offer. And others were arriving all the time. At this
moment, in fact, Miss Lily Mandell came in, and the tall, smouldering
beauty swung away along the hall to dispose of her wraps. She was
followed almost at once by Mr. Lawrence Hirsch, the banker. He casually
gave his coat and hat to one of the maids, and, groomed and faultless,
schooled in power, be bowed greetings through the throng towards his
hostess. He shook hands with her and kissed her lightly on one cheek,
saying with that cool irony that was a portion of the city style:</p>

<p>"You haven't looked so lovely, darling, since the days when we used
to dance the can-can together."</p>

<p>Then, polished and imperturbable, he turned away--a striking figure.
His abundant hair was prematurely white, and, strangely, it gave to his
clear and clean-shaven face a look of almost youthful maturity. His
features, a little worn but assured, were vested in unconscious
arrogance with the huge authorities of wealth. He moved, this weary,
able son of man, among the crowd and took his place, assuming, without
knowing he assumed, his full authorities.</p>

<p>Lily Mandell now returned to the big room and made her way languidly
towards Mrs. Jack. This heiress of Midas wealth was tall and dark, with
a shock of black hair. Her face, with its heavy-lidded eyes, was full
of pride and sleepy eloquence. She was a stunning woman, and everything
about her was a little startling. The dress she wore was a magnificent
gown fashioned from a single piece of dull golden cloth, and had been
so designed to display her charms that her tall, voluptuous figure
seemed literally to have been poured into it. It made her a miracle of
statuesque beauty, and as she swayed along with sleepy undulance, the
eyes of all the men were turned upon her. She bent over the smaller
figure of her hostess, kissed her, and, in a rich, yolky voice full of
genuine affection, said:</p>

<p>"Darling, how are you?"</p>

<p>By now, Herbert, the elevator boy, was being kept so busy bringing
up new arrivals that one group hardly had time to finish with its
greetings before the door would open and a new group would come in.
There was Roderick Hale, the distinguished lawyer. Then Miss Roberta
Heilprinn arrived with Mr. Samuel Fetzer. These two were old friends of
Mrs. Jack's "in the theatre", and her manner towards them, while not
more cordial or affectionate than that towards her other guests, was a
shade more direct and casual. It was as if one of those masks--not of
pretending but of formal custom--which life imposes upon so many human
relations had here keen sloughed off. She said simply: "Oh, hello,
Bertie. Hello, Sam." The shade indefinable told everything: they were
"show people"--she and they had "worked together".</p>

<p>There were a good many show people. Two young actors from the
Community Guild Theatre escorted the Misses Hattie Warren and Bessie
Lane, both of them grey-haired spinsters who were directors of the
theatre. And, in addition to the more gifted and distinguished people,
there were a number of the lesser fry, too. There was a young girl who
was understudy to a dancer at one of the repertory theatres, and
another woman who was the seamstress and wardrobe mistress there, and
still another who had once been Mrs. Jack's assistant in her own work.
For, as success and fame had come to Mrs. Jack, she had not forgotten
her old friends. Though she was now a celebrity herself, she had thus
escaped the banal and stereotyped existence that so many celebrities
achieve. She loved life too well to cut herself off from the common run
of warm humanity. In her own youth she had known sorrow, insecurity,
hardship, heartbreak, and disillusion, and she had never forgotten it.
Nor had she forgotten any of the people her life had ever touched. She
had a rare talent for loyal and abiding friendships, and most of the
people who were here to-night, even the most famous ones, were friends
who she had known for many years, some of them since childhood.</p>

<p>Among the guests who now came streaming in was a mild, sad-faced
woman named Margaret Ettinger. She was married to a profligate husband
and had brought him with her. And he, John Ettinger, had brought along
a buxom young woman who was his current mistress. This trio provided
the most bizarre and unpleasantly disturbing touch to an otherwise
distinguished gathering.</p>

<p>The guests were still arriving as fast as the elevator could bring
them up. Stephen Hook came in with his sister, Mary, and greeted his
hostess by holding out to her a frail, limp hand. At the same time he
turned half away from her with an air of exaggerated boredom and
indifference, an almost weary disdain, as he murmured:</p>

<p>"Oh, hello, Esther...Look"--he half-turned towards her again, almost
as if this were an afterthought--"I brought you this." He handed her a
book and turned away again. "I thought it was rather interesting," he
said in a bored tone. "You might like to look at it."</p>

<p>What he had given her was a magnificent volume of Peter Breughel's
drawings--a volume that she knew well, and the cost of which had
frightened even her. She looked quickly at the flyleaf and saw that in
his fine hand he had written primly: "For Esther--from Stephen Hook".
And suddenly she remembered that she had mentioned to him casually, a
week or two before, her interest in this book, and she understood now
that this act, which in a characteristic way he was trying to conceal
under a mask of laboured indifference, had come swift and shining as a
beam of light out of the depths of the man's fine and generous spirit.
Her face burned crimson, something choked her in the throat, and her
eyes grew hot with tears.</p>

<p>"Oh, Steve!" she gasped. "This is simply the most beautiful--the
most wonderful----"</p>

<p>He seemed fairly to shrink away from her. His white, flabby face
took on an expression of disdainful boredom that was so exaggerated it
would have seemed comical if it had not been for the look of naked
pleading in his hazel eyes. It was the look of a proud, noble,
strangely twisted and tormented man--the look almost of a frightened
child, who, even while it shrank away from the companionship and
security it so desperately needed and wanted, was also pleading
pitifully: "For God's sake, help me if you can! I am afraid!"</p>

<p>She saw that look in his eyes as he turned pompously away from her,
and it went through her like a knife. In a flash of stabbing pity she
felt the wonder, the strangeness, and the miracle of living.</p>

<p>"Oh, you poor tormented creature," she was thinking. "What is wrong
with you? What are you afraid of? What's eating on you anyway?...What a
strange man he is!" she thought more tranquilly. "And how fine and good
and high!"</p>

<p>At this moment, as if reading her own thoughts, her daughter, Alma,
came to the rescue. Cool, poised, lovely, the girl came across the
room, moved up to Hook, and said casually:</p>

<p>"Oh, hello, Steve. Can I get you a drink?"</p>

<p>The question was a godsend. He was extremely fond of the girl. He
liked her polished style, her elegance, her friendly yet perfectly
impenetrable manner. It gave him just the foil, the kind of protection,
that he so desperately needed. He answered her at once.</p>

<p>"What you have to say quite fascinates me," he murmured in a bored
tone and moved over to the mantel, where he leaned as spectator and
turned his face three-quarters away from the room, as if the sight of
so many appallingly dull people was more than he could endure.</p>

<p>The elaborately mannered indirection of his answer was completely
characteristic of Stephen Hook, and provided a key to his literary
style. He was the author of a great many stories, which he sold to
magazines to support himself and his mother, and also of several very
fine books. The books had established his considerable and deserved
reputation, but they had had almost no sale. As he himself had
ironically pointed out, almost everyone, apparently, had read his books
and no one had bought them. In these books, just as in his social
manner, he tried to mask his shyness and timidity by an air of weary
disdain and by the intricate artifice and circumlocution of an
elaborately mannered style.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jack, after staring rather helplessly at Hook, turned to his
sister, a jolly-faced spinster with twinkling eyes and an infectious
laugh who shared her brother's charm but lacked his tormented spirit,
and whispered:</p>

<p>"What's wrong with Steve to-night? He looks as if he's been seeing
ghosts."</p>

<p>"No--just another monster," Mary Hook replied, and laughed. "He had
a pimple on his nose last week and he stared at it so much in the
mirror that he became convinced it was a tumour. Mother was almost
crazy. He locked himself in his room and refused to come out or talk to
anyone for days and days. Four days ago he sent her a note leaving
minute instructions for his funeral and burial--he has a horror of
being cremated. Three days ago he came out in his pyjamas and said
good-bye to all of us. He said his life was overall was ended. To-night
he thought better of it and decided to dress and come to your
party."</p>

<p>Mary Hook laughed again good-naturedly and, with a humorous shrug
and a shake of her head, moved away into the crowd. And Mrs. Jack,
still with a rather troubled look on her face, turned to talk to old
Jake Abramson, who had been holding her hand and gently stroking it
during the last part of this puzzled interlude.</p>

<p>The mark of the fleshpots was plain upon Jake Abramson. He was old,
subtle, sensual, weary, and he had the face of a vulture. Curiously
enough, it was also a strangely attractive face. It had so much
patience in it, and a kind of wise cynicism, and a weary humour. There
was something paternal and understanding about him. He looked like an
immensely old and tired ambassador of life who had lived so long, and
seen so much, and been so many places, that even his evening clothes
were as habitual as his breath and hung on him with a weary and
accustomed grace as if he had been born in them.</p>

<p>He had taken off his top-coat and his silk hat and given them to the
maid, and then had come wearily into the room towards Mrs. Jack. He was
evidently very fond of her. While she had been talking to Mary Hook he
had remained silent and had brooded above her like a benevolent
vulture. He smiled beneath his great nose and kept his eyes intently on
her face; then he took her small hand in his weary old clasp and began
to stroke her smooth arm. It was a gesture frankly old and sensual,
jaded, and yet strangely fatherly and gentle. It was the gesture of a
man who had known and possessed many pretty women and who still knew
how to admire and appreciate them, but whose stronger passions had now
passed over into a paternal benevolence.</p>

<p>And in the same way he now spoke to her.</p>

<p>"You're looking nice!" he said. "You're looking pretty!" He kept
smiling vulturesquely at her and stroking her arm. "Just like a rose
she is!" the old man said, and never took his weary eyes from her
face.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jake!" she cried excitedly and in a surprised tone, as if she
had not known before that he was there. "How nice of you to come! I
didn't know you were back. I thought you were still in Europe."</p>

<p>"I've been and went," he declared humorously.</p>

<p>"You're looking awfully well, Jake," she said. "The trip did you
lots of good. You've lost weight. You took the cure at Carlsbad, didn't
you?"</p>

<p>"I didn't take the cure," the old man solemnly declared, "I took the
die-ett." Deliberately he mispronounced the word.</p>

<p>Instantly Mrs. Jack's face was suffused with crimson and her
shoulders began to shake hysterically. She turned to Roberta Heilprinn,
seized her helplessly by the arm, and clung to her, shrieking
faintly:</p>

<p>"God! Did you hear him? He's been on a diet! I bet it almost killed
him! The way he loves to eat!"</p>

<p>Miss Heilprinn chuckled fruitily and her oil-smooth features widened
in such a large grin that her eyes contracted to closed slits.</p>

<p>"I've been die-etting ever since I went away," said Jake. "I was
sick when I went away--and I came back on an English boat," the old man
said with a melancholy and significant leer that drew a scream of
laughter from the two women.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jake!" cried Mrs. Jack hilariously. "How you must have
suffered! I know what you used to think of English food!"</p>

<p>"I think the same as I always did," the old man said with resigned
sadness--"only ten times more!"</p>

<p>She shrieked again, then gasped out, "Brussels sprouts?"</p>

<p>"They still got 'em," said old Jake solemnly. "They still got the
same ones they had ten years ago. I saw Brussels sprouts this last trip
that ought to be in the British Museum...And they still got that good
fish," he went on with a suggestive leer.</p>

<p>Roberta Heilprinn, her bland features grinning like a Buddha,
gurgled: "The Dead Sea fruit?"</p>

<p>"No," said old Jake sadly, "not the Dead Sea fruit--that ain't dead
enough. They got boiled flannel now," he said, "and that good
sauce!...You remember that <i>good</i> sauce they used to make?" He
leered at Mrs. Jack with an air of such insinuation that she was again
set off in a fit of shuddering hysteria:</p>

<p>"You mean that awful...tasteless...pasty...<i>goo</i>...about the
colour of a dead lemon?"</p>

<p>"You got it," the old man nodded his wise and tired old head in
weary agreement. "You got it...That's it...They still make it...So I've
been die-etting all the way back!" For the first time his tired old
voice showed a trace of animation. "Carlsbad wasn't in it compared to
the die-etting I had to do on the English boat!" He paused, then with a
glint of cynic humour in his weary eyes, he said: "It was fit for
nothing but a bunch of goys!"</p>

<p>This reference to unchosen tribes, with its evocation of humorous
contempt, now snapped a connection between these three people, and
suddenly one saw them in a new way. The old man was smiling thinly,
with a cynical intelligence, and the two women were shaken utterly by a
paroxysm of understanding mirth. One saw now that they really were
<i>together</i>, able, ancient, immensely knowing, and outside the
world, regardant, tribal, communitied in derision and contempt for the
unhallowed, unsuspecting tribes of lesser men who were not party to
their knowing, who were not folded to their seal. It passed--the
instant showing of their ancient sign. The women just smiled now,
quietly: they were citizens of the world again.</p>

<p>"But Jake! You poor fellow!" Mrs. Jack said sympathetically. "You
must have hated it!" Then she cried suddenly and enthusiastically as
she remembered: "Isn't Carlsbad just too beautiful?...Did you know that
Bert and I were there one time?" As she uttered these words she slipped
her hand affectionately through the arm of her friend, Roberta, then
went on vigorously, with a jolly laugh and a merry face: "Didn't I ever
tell you about that time, Jake?...Really, it was the most wonderful
experience!...But God!" she laughed almost explosively--"Will you ever
forget the first three or four days, Bert?" She appealed to her smiling
friend. "Do you remember how hungry we got? How we thought we couldn't
possibly hold out? Wasn't it dreadful?" she said, and then went on with
a serious and rather puzzled air as she tried to explain it: "But
then--I don't know--it's funny--but somehow you get used to it, don't
you, Bert? The first few days are pretty awful, but after that you
don't seem to mind. I guess you get too weak, or something...I know
Bert and I stayed in bed three weeks--and really it wasn't bad after
the first few days." She laughed suddenly, richly. "We used to try to
torture each other by making up enormous menus of the most delicious
food we knew. We had it all planned out to go to a swell restaurant the
moment our cure was over and order the biggest meal we could think
of!...Well!" she laughed--"would you believe it?--the day the cure was
finished and the doctor told us it would be all right for us to get up
and eat--I know we both lay there for hours thinking of all the things
we were going to have. It was simply wonderful!" she said, laughing and
making a fine little movement with her finger and her thumb to indicate
great delicacy, her voice squeaking like a child's and her eyes
wrinkling up to dancing points. "In all your life you never heard of
such delicious food as Bert and I were going to devour! We resolved to
do everything in the greatest style!...Well, at last we got up and
dressed. And God!" she cried. "We were so weak we could hardly stand
up, but we wore the prettiest clothes we had, and we had chartered a
Rolls Royce for the occasion and a chauffeur in livery! In all your
<i>days</i>," she cried with her eyes twinkling, "you've never seen
such swank! We got into the car and were driven away like a couple of
queens. We told the man to drive us to the swellest, most expensive
restaurant he knew. He took us to a beautiful place outside of town. It
looked like a chateau!" She beamed rosily round her. "And when they saw
us coming they must have thought we were royalty from the way they
acted. The flunkies were lined up, bowing and scraping, for half a
block. Oh, it was thrilling! Everything we'd gone through and endured
in taking the cure seemed worth it...Well!" she looked round her and
the breath left her body audibly in a sigh of complete
frustration--"would you believe it?--when we got in there and tried to
eat we could hardly swallow a bite! We had looked forward to it so
long--we had planned it all so carefully--and all we could eat was a
soft-boiled egg--and we couldn't even finish that! It filled us up
right to here--" she put a small hand level with her chin. "It was so
tragic that we almost wept!...Isn't it a strange thing? I guess it must
be that your stomach shrinks up while you're on the diet. You lie there
day after day and think of the enormous meal you are going to devour
just as soon as you get up--and then when you try it you're not even
able to finish a soft-boiled egg!"</p>

<p>As she finished, Mrs. Jack shrugged her shoulders and lifted her
hands questioningly, with such a comical look on her face that
everybody round her laughed. Even weary and jaded old Jake Abramson,
who had really paid no attention to what she was saying but had just
been regarding her with his fixed smile during the whole course of her
animated dialogue, now smiled a little more warmly as he turned away to
speak to other friends.</p>

<p>Miss Heilprinn and Mrs. Jack, left standing together in the centre
of the big room, offered an instructive comparison in the capacities of
their sex. Each woman was perfectly cast in her own role. Each had
found the perfect adaptive means by which she could utilise her full
talents with the least waste and friction.</p>

<p>Miss Heilprinn looked the very distinguished woman that she was.
Hers was the talent of the administrator, the ability to get things
done, and one knew at a glance that in the rough and tumble of
practical affairs this bland lady was more than a match for any man.
She suggested oil--smooth oil, oil of tremendous driving power and
generating force.</p>

<p>Along Broadway she had reigned for years as the governing brain of a
celebrated art theatre, and her business acuity had wrung homage even
from her enemies. It had been her function to promote, to direct, to
control, and in the tenuous and uncertain speculations of the theatre
to take care not to be fleeced by the wolves of Broadway. The
brilliance of her success, the power of her will, and the superior
quality of her metal were written plain upon her. It took no very
experienced observer to see that in the unequal contest between Miss
Heilprinn and the wolves of Broadway it had been the wolves who had
been worsted.</p>

<p>In that savage and unremitting warfare, which arouses such bitter
passions and undying hatreds that eyes become jaundiced and lips so
twisted that they are never afterwards able to do anything but writhe
like yellowed scars on haggard faces, had Miss Heilprinn's face grown
hard? Had her mouth contracted to a grim line? Had her jaw out-jutted
like a granite crag? Were the marks of the wars visible anywhere upon
her? Not at all. The more murderous the fight, the blander her face.
The more treacherous the intrigues in which Broadway's life involved
her, the more mellow became the fruity lilt of her good-humoured
chuckle. She had actually thriven on it. Indeed, as one of her
colleagues said: "Roberta never seems so happy and so unconsciously
herself as when she is playing about in a nest of rattlesnakes."</p>

<p>So, now, as she stood there talking to Mrs. Jack, she presented a
very handsome and striking appearance. Her grey hair was combed in a
pompadour, and her suave and splendid gown gave the finishing touch to
her general air of imperturbable assurance. Her face was almost
impossibly bland, but it was a blandness without hypocrisy.
Nevertheless, one saw that her twinkling eyes, which narrowed into such
jolly slits when she smiled, were sharp as flint and missed
nothing.</p>

<p>In a curious way, Mrs. Jack was a more complex person than her
smooth companion. She was essentially not less shrewd, not less
accomplished, not less subtle, and not less determined to secure her
own ends in this hard world, but her strategy had been different.</p>

<p>Most people thought her "such a romantic person". As her friends
said, she was "so beautiful", she was "such a child", she was "so
good". Yes, she was all these things. For she had early learned the
advantages of possessing a rosy, jolly little face and a manner of
slightly bewildered surprise and naive innocence. When she smiled
doubtfully yet good-naturedly at her friends, it was as if to say: "Now
I know you're laughing at me, aren't you? I don't know what it is. I
don't know what I've done or said now. Of course I'm not clever the way
you are--all of you are so frightfully smart--but anyway I have a good
time, and I like you all."</p>

<p>To many people that was the essential Mrs. Jack. Only a few knew
that there was a great deal more to her than met the eye. The bland
lady who now stood talking to her was one of these. Miss Roberta
Heilprinn missed no artifice of that almost unconsciously deceptive
innocence. And perhaps that is why, when Mrs. Jack finished her
anecdote and looked at old Jake Abramson so comically and
questioningly, Miss Heilprinn's eye twinkled a little brighter, her
Buddhistic smile became a little smoother, and her yolky chuckle grew a
trifle more infectious. Perhaps that is also why, with a sudden impulse
of understanding and genuine affection, Miss Heilprinn bent and kissed
the glowing little cheek.</p>

<p>And the object of this caress, although she never changed her
expression of surprised and delighted innocence, knew full well all
that was going on in the other woman's mind. For just a moment, almost
imperceptibly, the eyes of the two women, stripped bare of all
concealing artifice, met each other. And in that moment there was
matter for Olympian laughter.</p>

<p>While Mrs. Jack welcomed her friends and beamed with happiness, one
part of her mind remained aloof and preoccupied. For someone was still
absent, and she kept thinking of him.</p>

<p>"I wonder where he is," she thought. "Why doesn't he come? I hope he
hasn't been drinking." She looked quickly over the brilliant gathering
with a troubled eye and thought impatiently: "If only he liked parties
more! If only he enjoyed meeting people--going out in the evening! Oh,
well--he's the way he is. It's no use trying to change him. I wouldn't
have him any different."</p>

<p>And then he arrived.</p>

<p>"Here he is!" she thought excitedly, looking at him with instant
relief. "And he's all right!"</p>

<p>George Webber had, in fact, taken two or three stiff drinks before
he left his rooms, in preparation for the ordeal. The raw odour of
cheap gin hung on his breath, his eyes were slightly bright and wild,
and his manner was quick and a trifle more feverish than was his wont.
Just the same he was, as Esther had phrased it to herself, "all
right".</p>

<p>"If only people--my friends--everyone I know--didn't affect him so,"
she thought. "Why is it, I wonder. Last night when he telephoned me he
talked so strange! Nothing he said made any sense! What could have been
wrong with him? Oh, well--it doesn't matter now. He's here. I love
him!"</p>

<p>Her face warmed and softened, her pulse beat quicker, and she went
to meet him.</p>

<p>"Oh, hello, darling," she said fondly. "I'm so glad you're here at
last. I was beginning to be afraid you were going to fail me after
all."</p>

<p>He greeted her half fondly and half truculently, with a mixture of
diffidence and pugnacity, of arrogance and humility, of pride, of hope,
of love, of suspicion, of eagerness, of doubt.</p>

<p>He had not wanted to come to the party at all. From the moment she
had first invited him he had brought forward a barrage of objections.
They had argued it back and forth for days, but at last she had won and
had exacted his promise. But as the time approached he felt himself
hesitating again, and last night he had paced the floor for hours in an
agony of self-recrimination and indecision. At last, around one
o'clock, he had seized the telephone with desperate resolve and, after
waking the whole household before he got her, he had told her that he
was not coming. Once more he repeated all his reasons. He only
half-understood them himself, but they had to do with the
incompatibility of her world and his world, and his belief, which was
as much a matter of instinctive feeling as of conscious thought, that
he must keep his independence of the world she belonged to if he was to
do his work. He grew almost desperate as he tried to explain it to her,
because he couldn't seem to make her understand what he was driving at.
In the end she became a little desperate, too. First she was annoyed,
and told him for God's sake to stop being such a fool. Then she became
hurt and angry and reminded him of his promise.</p>

<p>"We've been over all of this a dozen times!" she said shrilly, and
there was also a tearful note in her voice. "You promised, George--you
know you did! And now everything's arranged. It's too late to change it
now. You can't let me down like this!"</p>

<p>This appeal was too much for him. He knew, of course, that the party
had not been planned for him and that no arrangements would be upset if
he failed to appear. No one but Esther would even be aware of his
absence. But he had given his promise to come, however reluctantly, and
he saw that the only issue he had succeeded in raising in her mind was
the simple one of whether he would keep his word. So once more, and
finally, he had yielded. And now he was here, full of confusion, and
wishing with all his heart that he was anywhere else.</p>

<p>"I'm sure you're going to have a good time," Esther was saying to
him eagerly. "You'll see--" and she squeezed his hand. "There are lots
of people I want you to meet. But you must be hungry. Better get
yourself something to eat first. You'll find plenty of things you like.
I planned them especially for you. Go in the dining-room and help
yourself. I'll have to stay here a little while to welcome all these
people."</p>

<p>After she left him to greet some new arrivals, George stood there
awkwardly for a moment with a scowl on his face and glanced about the
room at the dazzling assemblage. In that attitude he cut a rather
grotesque figure. The low brow with its frame of short black hair, the
burning eyes, the small, packed features, the long arms dangling to the
knees, and the curved paws gave him an appearance more simian than
usual, and the image was accentuated by his not-too-well-fitting dinner
jacket. People looked at him and stared, then turned away indifferently
and resumed their conversations.</p>

<p>"So!" he thought with somewhat truculent self-consciousness--"These
are her fine friends! I might have known it!" he muttered to himself,
without knowing at all what it was he might have known. The poise,
assurance, and sophistication of all these sleek faces made him fancy a
slight where none was offered or intended. "I'll show them!" he growled
absurdly beneath his breath, not having the faintest idea what he meant
by that.</p>

<p>With this, he turned upon his heel and threaded his way through the
brilliant throng towards the dining-room.</p>

<p>"I <i>mean!</i>...You <i>know!</i>..."</p>

<p>At the sound of the words, eager, rapid, uttered in a rather hoarse
yet strangely seductive tone of voice, Mrs. Jack smiled at the group to
whom she had been talking. "There's Amy!" she said.</p>

<p>Then, as she turned and saw the elflike head with its unbelievable
harvest of ebony curls, the snub nose and the little freckles, and the
lovely face so radiant with an almost boyish quality of animation and
enthusiasm, she thought:</p>

<p>"Isn't she beautiful! And--and--there is something so sweet, so--so
good about her!"</p>

<p>Even as her mind framed its spontaneous tribute to the girlish
apparition with the elflike head, Mrs. Jack knew that it was not true.
No; Amy Carleton was many things, but no one could call her good. In
fact, if she was not "a notorious woman", the reason was that she had
surpassed the ultimate limits of notoriety, even for New York.
Everybody knew her, and knew all about her, yet what the truth was, or
what the true image of that lovely counterfeit of youth and joy, no one
could say.</p>

<p>Chronology? Well, for birth she had had the golden spoon. She had
been born to enfabled wealth. Hers had been the childhood of a dollar
princess, kept, costly, cabined, pruned, confined. A daughter of
"Society", her girlhood had been spent in rich schools and in travel,
in Europe, Southampton, New York, and Palm Beach. By eighteen she was
"out"--a famous beauty. By nineteen she was married. And by twenty she
was divorced, her name tainted. It had been a sensational case which
fairly reeked. Even at that time her conduct had been so scandalous
that her husband had had no difficulty in winning a decree.</p>

<p>Since that time, seven years before, her career had defied the
measurements of chronology. Although she was now only in her middle
twenties, her life seemed to go back through aeons of iniquity. Thus
one might remember one of the innumerable scandals that had been
connected with her name, and then check oneself suddenly with a feeling
of stunned disbelief. "Oh, no! It can't be! That happened only three
short years ago, and since then she's--why she's--" And one would stare
in stupefaction at that elflike head, that snub nose, that boyishly
eager face, like one who realised that he was looking at the dread
Medusa, or at some enchantress of Circean cunning whose life was older
than the ages and whose heart was old as hell.</p>

<p>It baffled time, it turned reality to phantasmal shapes. One could
behold her as she was to-night, here in New York, this freckled,
laughing image of happy innocence--and before ten days had made their
round one might come upon her again in the corruptest gatherings of
Paris, drugged fathoms deep in opium, foul-bodied and
filth-bespattered, cloying in the embraces of a gutter rat, so deeply
rooted in the cesspool that it seemed she must have been bred on sewage
and had never known any other life.</p>

<p>Since her first marriage and divorce, she had been married twice
again. The second marriage had lasted only twenty hours, and had been
annulled. The third had ended when her husband shot himself.</p>

<p>And before and after that, and in between, and in and out, and
during it and later on, and now and then, and here and there, and at
home and abroad, and on the seven seas, and across the length and
breadth of the five continents, and yesterday and to-morrow and for
ever--could it be said of her that she had been promiscuous? No, that
could not be said of her. For she had been as free as air, and one does
not qualify the general atmosphere with such a paltry adjective as
"promiscuous". She had just slept with everybody--with white, black,
yellow, pink, green, or purple--but she had never been promiscuous.</p>

<p>It was, in romantic letters, a period that celebrated the lady who
was lost, the lovely creature in the green hat who was "never let off
anything". Her story was a familiar one: she was the ill-starred
heroine of fate, a martyr to calamitous mischance, whose ruin had been
brought about through tragic circumstances which she could not control,
and for which she was not responsible.</p>

<p>Amy Carleton had her apologists who tried to cast her in this role.
The stories told about her "start upon the downward path" were
numerous. One touching version dated the beginning of the end from the
time when, an innocent and fun-loving girl of eighteen, she had, in a
moment of daring, lighted a cigarette at a dinner party in Southampton,
attended by a large number of eminent dowagers. The girl's downfall,
according to this tale, had been brought about by this thoughtless and
harmless little act. From that moment on--so the story went--the
verdict of the dowagers was "thumbs down" on Amy. The evil tongues
began to wag, scandal began to grow, her reputation was torn to shreds.
Then, in desperation, the unhappy child did go astray: she took to
drink, from drink to lovers, from lovers to opium, from opium
to--everything.</p>

<p>All this, of course, was just romantic nonsense. She was the victim
of a tragic doom indeed, but she herself had fashioned it. With her the
fault, as with dear Brutus, lay not in her stars, but in herself. For,
having been endowed with so many rare and precious things that most men
lack--wealth, beauty, charm, intelligence, and vital energy--she lacked
the will, the toughness, to resist. So, having almost all, but lacking
this, she was the slave to her advantages. Her wealth had set a premium
on every whim, and no one had ever taught her to say no.</p>

<p>In this she was the child of her own time. Her life expressed itself
in terms of speed, sensational change, and violent movement, in a
feverish tempo that never drew from its own energies exhaustion or
surcease, but mounted constantly to insane excess. She had been
everywhere and "seen everything"--in the way one might see things from
the windows of an express train travelling eighty miles an hour. And,
having quickly exhausted the conventional kaleidoscope of things to be
seen, she had long since turned to an investigation of things more
bizarre and sinister and hidden. Here, too, her wealth and powerful
connections opened doors to her which were closed to other people.</p>

<p>So, now, she possessed an intimate and extensive acquaintance among
the most sophisticated and decadent groups in "Society", in all the
great cities of the world. And her cult of the unusual had led to an
exploration of the most shadowy border lines of life. She had an
acquaintanceship among the underworld of New York, London, Paris, and
Berlin which the police might have envied. And even with the police her
wealth had secured for her dangerous privileges. In some way, known
only to persons who control great power, financial or political, she
had obtained a police card and was privileged to a reckless licence in
the operation of her low-slung racing car. Although she was
near-sighted, she drove it at murderous speed through the seething
highways of Manhattan, and as it flashed by she always got the courtesy
of a police salute. All this in spite of the fact that she had
demolished one car and killed a young man who had been driving with
her, and in spite of the further fact that the police knew her as one
who had been present at a drinking party at which one of the chieftains
of the underworld had been slain.</p>

<p>It seemed, therefore, that her wealth and power and feverish energy
could get her anything she wanted in any country of the world. People
had once said: "What on earth is Amy going to do next!" But now they
said: "What on earth is there left for her to do?" If life is to be
expressed solely in terms of velocity and sensation, it seemed there
was nothing left for her to do. Nothing but more speed, more change,
more violence, more sensation--until the end. And the end? The end
could only be destruction, and the mark of destruction was already
apparent upon her. It was written in her eyes--in her tormented,
splintered, and exploded vision. She had tried everything in
life--except living. And she could never try that now because she had
so long ago, and so irrevocably, lost the way. So there was nothing
left for her to do except to die.</p>

<p>"If only"--people would think regretfully, as Mrs. Jack now thought
as she looked at that elfin head--"oh, if only things had turned out
differently for her!"--and then would seek back desperately through the
labyrinthine scheme to find the clue to her disorder, saying: "Here--or
here--or here--it happened here, you see!--If Only--!"</p>

<p>If only men were so much clay, as they are blood, bone, marrow,
passion, feeling! If they only were!</p>

<p>"I <i>mean!</i>...You <i>know!</i>..." With these words, so
indicative of her undefined enthusiasm and inchoate thought, Amy jerked
the cigarette away from her lips, laughed hoarsely and eagerly, and
turned to her companions as if fairly burning with a desire to
communicate to them something that filled her with exuberant elation.
"I <i>mean!</i>" she cried again--"when you compare it with the stuff
they're doing nowadays!--I <i>mean</i>!--there's simply no comparison!"
Laughing jubilantly, as if the thought behind these splintered phrases
must be perfectly clear to everyone, she drew furiously upon her
cigarette again and jerked it from her lips.</p>

<p>The group of, young people of which Amy was the radiant centre, and
which included not only the young Japanese who was her current lover
but also the young Jew who had been his most recent predecessor, had
moved over towards the portrait of Mrs. Jack above the mantel, and were
looking up at it. The portrait deserved the praise that was now being
heaped upon it. It was one of the best examples of Henry Mallows' early
work.</p>

<p>"When you look at it and <i>think</i> how long ago that was!"--cried
Amy jubilantly, gesturing towards the picture with rapid thrusts of her
cigarette--"and how beautiful she was <i>then</i>!--and how beautiful
she is now!" she cried exultantly, laughed hoarsely, then cast her
grey-green eyes round her in a glance of feverish exasperation--"I
<i>mean!</i>"--she cried again, and drew impatiently on her
cigarette--"there's <i>simply</i> no comparison!" Then, realising that
she had not said what she had wanted to say, she went on: "Oh, I
<i>mean!</i>"--she said in a tone almost of desperation and tossed her
cigarette angrily away into the blazing fire--"the whole thing's
obvious!" she muttered, leaving everyone more bewildered than before.
With a sudden and impulsive movement she turned towards Stephen Hook,
who was still leaning with his elbow on one corner of the mantel, and
demanded: "How long has it been, Steve?...I <i>mean!</i>--it's been
twenty years ago, hasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, quite all of that," Hook answered in his cold, bored voice. In
his agitation and embarrassment he moved still farther away until he
almost had his back turned upon the group. "It's been nearer thirty, I
should think," he tossed back over his shoulder, and then with an air
of casual indifference he gave the date. "I should think it was done in
nineteen-one or two--wasn't it, Esther?" he said, turning to Mrs. Jack,
who had now approached the group. "Around nineteen-one, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"What's that?" said Mrs. Jack, and then went on immediately, "Oh,
the picture! No, Steve. It was done in nineteen"--she checked herself
so swiftly that it was not apparent to anyone but Hook--"in
nineteen-six." She saw just the trace of a smile upon his pale, bored
face and gave him a quick, warning little look, but he just
murmured:</p>

<p>"Oh...I had forgotten it was as late as that."</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, he knew the exact date, even to the month and
day, when it had been finished. And, still musing on the vagaries of
the sex, he thought: "Why will they be so stupid! She must understand
that to anyone who knows the least thing about Mallows' life the date
is as familiar as the fourth of July!"</p>

<p>"Of course," Mrs. Jack was saying rapidly, "I was just a child when
it was made. I couldn't have been more than eighteen at the time--if I
was that."</p>

<p>"Which would make you not more than forty-one now," thought Hook
cynically--"if you are that! Well, my dear, you were twenty when he
painted you--and you had been married for more than two years...Why do
they do it!" he thought impatiently, and with a feeling of sharp
annoyance. He looked at her and caught a quick expression--startled,
almost pleading--in her eyes. He followed her glance, and saw the
awkward figure of George Webber standing ill at ease in the doorway
leading from the dining-room. "Ah! It's this boy!" he thought. "She's
told him then that--" and, suddenly, remembering her pleading look, he
was touched with pity. Aloud, however, he merely murmured
indifferently:</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you couldn't have been very old."</p>

<p>"And God!" exclaimed Mrs. Jack, "but I was beautiful!"</p>

<p>She spoke the words with such innocent delight that they lost any
trace of objectionable vanity they might have had, and people smiled at
her affectionately. Amy Carleton, with a hasty little laugh, said
impulsively:</p>

<p>"Oh, Esther! Honestly, you're the <i>most</i>...1 But I
<i>mean!</i>"--she cried impatiently, with a toss of her dark head, as
if answering some invisible antagonist--"she <i>is</i>!"</p>

<p>"In all your days," said Mrs. Jack, her face suffused with laughter,
"you never saw the like of me! I was just like peaches and cream. I'd
have knocked your eye out!"</p>

<p>"But, <i>darling!</i> You do <i>now!</i>" cried Amy. "What I mean to
say is--darling, you're the <i>most</i>...! Isn't she, Steve?" She
laughed uncertainly, turning to Hook with feverish eagerness.</p>

<p>And he, seeing the ruin, the loss, the desperation in her splintered
eves, was sick with horror and with pity. He looked at her
disdainfully, with weary, lidded eyes, said: "What?" quite freezingly,
and then turned away, saying with an accent of boredom: "Oh."</p>

<p>Beside him was the smiling face of Mrs. Jack, and, above, the
portrait of the lovely girl that she had been. And the anguish and the
mystery of time stabbed through him.</p>

<p>"My God, here she is!" he thought. "Still featured like a child,
still beautiful, still loving someone--a boy!--almost as lovely now as
she was then when Mallows was a boy!"</p>

<p>1901! Ah, Time! The figures reeled in a drunken dance and he rubbed
his hand before his eyes. In 1901! How many centuries ago was that? How
many lives and deaths and floods, how many million days and nights of
love, of hate, of anguish and of fear, of guilt, of hope, of
disillusion and defeat here in the geologic aeons of this monstrous
catacomb, this riddled isle!--In 1901! Good God! It was the very
Prehistoric Age of Man! Why, all <i>that</i> had happened several
million years ago! Since then so much had begun and ended and been
forgotten--so many untold lives of truth, of youth, of old age, so much
blood and sweat and agony had gone below the bridge--why, he himself
had lived through at least a hundred lives of it. Yes, he had lived and
died through so many births and deaths and dark oblivions of it, had
striven, fought, and hoped, and been destroyed through so many
centuries of it, that even memory had failed--the sense of time had
been wiped out--and all of it now seemed to have happened in a timeless
dream. 1901! Looked at from here and now, it was a kind of Grand Canyon
of the human nerves and bones and blood and brain and flesh and words
and thought, all timeless now, all congealed, all solidified in an
unchanging stratum there impossibly below, mixed into a general
geologic layer with all the bonnets, bustles, and old songs, the straw
hats and the derbies, the clatter of forgotten hooves, the thunder of
forgotten wheels upon forgotten cobbles--all merged together now with
the skeletons of lost ideas in a single stratum of the sunken
world--while <i>she</i>----</p>

<p>--She! Why, surely she had been a part of it with him!</p>

<p>She had turned to speak to another group, and he could hear her
saying:</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I knew Jack Reed. He used to come to Mabel Dodge's place.
We were great friends...That was when Alfred Stieglitz had started his
salon----"</p>

<p>Ah, all these names! Had he not been with these as well? Or, was it
but another shape, a seeming, in this phantasmal shadow-show of time?
Had he not been beside her at the launching of the ship? Had they not
been captives together among Thracian faces? Had he not lighted tapers
to the tent when she had come to charm remission from the lord of
Macedon?--All these were ghosts--save she! And she--devouring child of
time--had of this whole huge company of ghosts alone remained immortal
and herself, had shed off the chrysalis of all these her former selves
as if each life that she had lived was nothing but an outworn garment,
and now stood here--<i>here</i>! Good God!--upon the burnt-out
candle-end of time--with her jolly face of noon, as if she had just
heard of this brave new world on Saturday--and would see if <i>all</i>
of it was really true to-morrow!</p>

<p>Mrs. Jack had turned back once more at the sound of Amy's voice and
had bent forward to listen to the girl's disjointed exclamations as if,
by giving more concentrated attention, she could make sense of what the
girl was trying to say.</p>

<p>"I <i>mean!</i>...You <i>know!</i>...But Esther! Darling, you're the
most...! It's the most...! I mean, when I look at both of you, I simply
can't"--cried Amy with hoarse elation, her lovely face all sunning over
with light--"Oh, what I <i>mean</i> to say is"--she cried, then shook
her head strongly, tossed another cigarette away impatiently, and cried
with the expiration of a long sigh--"Gosh!"</p>

<p>Poor child! Poor child! Hook turned pompously away to hide the naked
anguish in his eyes. So soon to grow, to go, to be consumed and die
like all of us! She was, he felt, like him, too prone to live her life
upon the single instant, never saving out anything as a prudent remnant
for the hour of peril or the day of ruin--too prone to use it all, to
give it all, burning herself out like last night's moths upon a cluster
of hard light!</p>

<p>Poor child! Poor child! So quick and short and temporal, both you
and I, thought Hook--the children of a younger kind! While these! He
looked about him at the sensual volutes of strong nostrils curved with
scornful mirth. These others of this ancient chemistry--unmothed,
re-born, and venturesome, yet wisely mindful of the flame--these others
shall endure! Ah, Time!</p>

<p>Poor child!</p>

<h2><a name="chapter2-16"></a>16. A Moment of Decision</h2>

<p>George Webber had helped himself generously to the sumptuous feast
so temptingly laid out in the dining-room, and now, his hunger sated,
he had been standing for a few minutes in the doorway surveying the
brilliant scene in the great living-room. He was trying to make up his
mind whether to plunge boldly in and find somebody to talk to, or
whether to put off the ordeal a little longer by lingering over the
food. He thought with regret that there were still a few dishes that he
had not even tasted. He had already eaten so much, however, that he
knew he could not make a convincing show of taking more, so there
seemed to be nothing for it but to screw up his courage and make the
best of the situation.</p>

<p>He had just reached this conclusion, with a feeling of "Now you're
in for it!"--when he caught a glimpse of Stephen Hook, whom he knew and
liked, and with a great sense of relief he started towards him. Hook
was leaning on the mantel, talking with a handsome woman. He saw George
coming and extended his soft, plump hand sideways, saying casually:</p>

<p>"Oh. How are you?...Look." His tone, as always when he did something
that was prompted by the generous and sensitive warmth of his spirit,
was deliberately indifferent and masked with an air of heavy boredom.
"Have you a telephone? I was trying to get you the other day. Can't you
come and have lunch with me some time?"</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, this idea had never occurred to him until that
moment. Webber knew that he had thought of it in an instant reflex of
sympathy to put him at his ease, to make him feel less desperately
shipwrecked in these glittering, sophisticated tides, to give him
something "to hold on to". Ever since he had first met Hook and had
seen his desperate shyness and the naked terror in his eyes, he had
understood the kind of man he was. He had never been deceived by the
show of aloof weariness or the elaborately mannered speech. Beneath
these disguises he had felt the integrity, the generosity, the
nobility, the aspiration in the man's tortured soul. So, now, with
profound gratitude, he reached out and shook his hand, feeling as he
did so like a bewildered swimmer seizing on the one thing that could
sustain him in these disturbing and unfathomed currents which were
edged somehow with menace. He stammered out a hasty greeting, said he
would be delighted to go to lunch with him some time--any time--any
time at all; and he took a place beside Hook as though he meant to stay
there for the rest of the evening.</p>

<p>Hook talked to him a little while in his casual way and introduced
the woman. George tried to engage her in conversation, but, instead of
answering his remarks, she just looked at him coolly and said nothing.
Embarrassed by this behaviour, George looked round him as if searching
for someone, and in a final effort to say something, to give some show
of ease and purpose which he did not feel, he blurted out:</p>

<p>"Have--have you seen Esther anywhere about?"</p>

<p>As he said the words he knew how stiff and clumsy they sounded, and
how absurd, too, for Mrs. Jack, as anyone could see, was standing
talking to some of the guests not ten feet away. And the woman, as if
she had been waiting for just such an opening, now answered him at
once. Turning to him with a bright, superior smile, she said with cool
unfriendliness:</p>

<p>"About? Yes, I think you'll find her about--just about there,"
nodding in the direction of Mrs. Jack.</p>

<p>It was not a very witty remark. To George it seemed almost as stupid
as his own words had been. He knew, too, that the unfriendliness behind
it was impersonal--just the mark of fashion, a willingness to sacrifice
manners to the chance of making a smart retort. Why, then, did his face
now flush with anger? Why did he double up his fist and turn upon the
trivial and smiling creature with such smouldering menace that it
seemed he was about to commit a physical assault upon her?</p>

<p>In the very instant that he assumed this belligerent attitude he
realised that he was acting like a baffled clodhopper, and this
consciousness made him feel ten times the yokel that he looked. He
tried to think of telling words with which to answer her, but his mind
was paralysed and he was conscious only of the burning sensation in his
face and neck. He knew that his ill-fitting coat was sticking out round
his collar, that he was cutting a sorry figure, and that the
woman--"That damned bitch!" he muttered to himself--was laughing at
him. So, defeated and discomfited utterly, not so much by the woman as
by his own ineptitude, he turned and stalked away, hating himself, the
party, and, most of all, his folly in coming.</p>

<p>Well, he hadn't wanted to come! That was Esther's doing! She was
responsible for this! It was all her fault! Full of confusion and
irrational anger at everything and everybody, he backed himself against
the wall on the opposite side of the room and stood there clenching and
unclenching his fists and glaring round him.</p>

<p>But the violence and the injustice of his feelings soon began to
have a calming and sobering effect upon him. Then he saw the absurdity
of the whole episode, and began to laugh and mock inwardly at
himself.</p>

<p>"So this is why you didn't want to come!" he thought scornfully.
"You were afraid some silly fool of an ill-bred woman would make an
inane remark that would prick your delicate hide! God, what a fool you
are! Esther was right!"</p>

<p>But <i>had</i> she been right, really? He had made such an issue of
it with his talk about the work he had to do as a novelist, and how he
had to keep clear of her world in order to do it. Was all that just a
way of rationalising his sense of social inadequacy? Had he gone to
such lengths of theorising merely to spare his tender ego the ridicule
and humiliation of such a scene as he had just precipitated?</p>

<p>No, that was not the answer. There was more to it than that. By now
he had cooled off enough to be able to look at himself objectively, and
all at once he realised that he had never got clear in his own mind
what he had meant when he had talked to Esther about her world and his
world. He had used the phrases as symbols of something real, something
important that he had felt instinctively but had never put into words.
And that's why he hadn't been able to make her understand. Well, what
was it? What had he been afraid of? It wasn't only that he didn't like
big parties and knew himself to be unschooled in the social graces that
such occasions demanded. That was a part of it--yes. But it was only a
part--the smallest part, the petty, personal part. There was something
else--something impersonal, something much bigger than himself,
something that mattered greatly to him and that would not be denied.
What was it now? Better face it and try to get it straight.</p>

<p>Completely cool now, and fascinated by the inner problem which the
ridiculous little incident had brought into sharp focus, he began to
look about him at the people in the room. He watched their faces
closely and tried to penetrate behind the social masks they wore,
probably, boring, searching as for some clue that might lead him to an
answer to his riddle. It was, he knew, a distinguished gathering. It
included brilliant, successful men and beautiful women. They were among
the best and highest that the city had to offer. But as he looked them
over with an alert eye and with all his sensitivities keenly awakened
by his present purpose, he saw that there were some among them who wore
quite another hue.</p>

<p>That fellow there, for instance! With his pasty face and rolling
eyes and mincing ways, and hips that wiggled suggestively as he
walked--could there be any doubt at all that he was a member of
nature's other sex? Webber knew that people of this fellow's type and
gender were privileged personalities, the species being regarded
tenderly as a cross between a lap-dog and a clown. Almost every
fashionable hostess considered them essential functionaries at smart
gatherings like this. Why was it, George wondered. Was it something in
the spirit of the times that had let the homosexual usurp the place and
privilege of a hunch-backed jester of an old king's court, his
deformity become a thing of open jest and ribaldry? However it had come
about, the thing itself was indubitable. The mincing airs and graces of
such a fellow, his antics and his gibes, the spicy sting of his
feminine and envenomed wit, were the exact counterparts of the
malicious quips of ancient clowns. So, now. As this simpering fellow
minced along, the powdered whiteness of his parchment face held
languidly to one side, the weary eyes half-closed and heavy-lidded, he
would pause from time to time to wave with a maidenly gesture of his
wrist at various people of his acquaintance in different parts of the
big room, saying as he did so:</p>

<p>"Oh, hello!...<i>There</i> you are!...You <i>must</i> come
over!"</p>

<p>The effect of all this was so irresistible that the ladies shrieked
with laughter, and the gentlemen spluttered and guffawed.</p>

<p>And that woman over there in the corner, the one with the mannish
haircut and angular lines and hard, enamelled face, holding the hand of
that rather pretty and embarrassed young girl--a nymphomaniac if ever
he saw one.</p>

<p>At the sound of the splintered phrases: "I <i>mean!</i>...You
<i>know!</i>"--Webber turned and saw the dark curls of Amy Carleton. He
knew who she was, and he knew her story, but even if he had not known
he thought he would have guessed a part of it by the tragic look of
lost innocence in her face. But what he noticed chiefly now was the
group of men who followed her about, among them the young Jew and the
young Japanese--and the sight made him think of a pack of dogs trailing
after a bitch in heat. It was so open, so naked, so shameless that it
almost made him sick.</p>

<p>His eye took in John Ettinger, standing a little apart with his wife
and his mistress, and he read their relationship unmistakably in their
bearing towards each other.</p>

<p>At these repeated signs of decadence in a society which had once
been the object of his envy and his highest ambition, Webber's face had
begun to take on a look of scorn. Then he saw Mr. Jack moving suavely
among his guests, and suddenly, with a rush of blood to his face, he
thought about himself. Who was <i>he</i> to feel so superior? Did they
not all know who be was, and why he was here?</p>

<p>Yes, all these people looked at one another with untelling eyes.
Their speech was casual, quick, and witty. But they did not say the
things they knew. And they knew everything. They had seen everything.
They had accepted everything. And they received every new intelligence
now with a cynical and amused look in their untelling eyes. Nothing
shocked them any more. It was the way things were. It was what they had
come to expect of life.</p>

<p>Ah, there he had it! That was part of the answer. It was not so much
what they did, for in this there was no appreciable difference between
themselves and him. It was their attitude of acceptance, the things
they thought and felt about what they did, their complaisance about
themselves and about their life, their loss of faith in anything
better. He himself had not yet come to that, he did not want to come to
it. This was one of the reasons, he now knew, why he did not want to be
sealed to this world that Esther belonged to.</p>

<p>Still, there could be no question that these people were an honoured
group. They had stolen no man's ox or ass. Their gifts were valuable
and many, and had won for them the world's grateful applause.</p>

<p>Was not the great captain of finance and industry, Lawrence Hirsch,
a patron of the arts as well, and a leader of advanced opinion? Yes.
His views on child labour, share-cropping, the trial of Sacco and
Vanzetti, and other questions that had stirred the indignation of the
intellectual world were justly celebrated for their enlightenment and
their liberalism. Who should cavil, then, at the fact that a banker
might derive a portion of his income from the work of children in the
textile factories of the South?--that another part of it might be
derived from the labour of share-croppers in the tobacco fields?--that
still another might come from steel mills in the Middle West where
armed thugs had been employed to shoot into the ranks of striking
workers? A banker's business was to invest his money wherever he could
get the best return. Business was business, and to say that a man's
social views ought to come between him and his profits was cavilling,
indeed! As for Mr. Hirsch himself, he had his devoted champions even
among the comrades of the left, who were quick to point out that
theoretical criticism of this sort was childish. The sources of Mr.
Hirsch's wealth and power, whatever they might be, were quite
accidental and beside the point. His position as a liberal, "a friend
of Russia", a leader of advanced social opinion, a searching critic,
indeed, of the very capitalist class to which he belonged, was so well
known as to place him in the very brain and forehead of enlightened
thought.</p>

<p>As for these others in the illustrious company that Webber now saw
on every side, not one of them had ever said: "Let them eat cake!" When
the poor had starved, these had suffered. When the children toiled,
these had bled. When the oppressed, the weak, the stricken and betrayed
men had been falsely accused and put to death, these tongues had been
lifted in indignant protest--if only the issue had been fashionable!
These had written letters to the press, carried placards upon Beacon
Hill, joined parades, made contributions, lent the prestige of their
names to form committees of defence.</p>

<p>All this was indubitably true. But as he thought about it now,
Webber also felt that such as these might lift their voices and parade
their placards till the crack of doom, but that in the secret and
entrenched resources of their lives they had all battened on the blood
of common man, and wrung their profits from the sweat of slaves, like
any common overseer of money and of privilege that ever lived. The
whole tissue of these princely lives, he felt, these lesbic and
pederastic loves, these adulterous intrigues, sustained in mid-air now,
floating on the face of night like a starred veil, had none the less
been spun from man's common dust of sweated clay, unwound out of the
entrails of man's agony.</p>

<p>Yes, that was it! That was the answer! That was the very core of it!
Could he as a novelist, as an artist, belong to this high world of
privilege without taking upon himself the stultifying burden of that
privilege? Could he write truthfully of life as he saw it, could he say
the things he must, and at the same time belong to this world of which
he would have to write? Were the two things possible? Was not this
world of fashion and of privilege the deadliest enemy of art and truth?
Could he belong to the one without forsaking the other? Would not the
very privilege that he might gain from these, the great ones of the
city, come between him and the truth, shading it, tempering it, and in
the end betraying it? And would he then be any different from a score
of others who had let themselves be taken into camp, made captive by
false visions of wealth and ease, and by the deadly hankering for
respectability--that gilded counterfeit which so often passes current
for the honest coin of man's respect?</p>

<p>That was the danger, and it was real enough. It was, he knew, no
mere phantom of his distempered and suspicious mind. Had it not
happened over and over again? Think of all the young writers, among
them some of the best, who had won acclaim for the promise of their
genius, and then had left their promise unfulfilled because they had
traded their birthright for just such a mess of the world's pottage.
They, too, had begun as seekers after truth, but had suffered some
eclipse of vision and had ended as champions of some special and
limited brand of truth. They were the ones who became the special
pleaders for things as they are, and their names grew fat and sleek in
the pages of the <i>Saturday Evening Post</i> and the women's
magazines. Or they became escapists and sold themselves to Hollywood,
and were lost and sunk without a trace. Or, somewhat differently, but
following the same blind principle, they identified themselves with
this or that group, clique, faction, or interest in art or politics,
and led forlorn and esoteric little cults and isms. These were the
innumerable small fry who became literary Communists, or single-taxers,
or embattled vegetarians, or believers in salvation through nudism.
Whatever they became--and there was no limit to their variety--they
were like the blind men with the elephant: each one of them had
accepted some part of life for the whole, some fragmentary truth or
half-truth for truth itself, some little personal interest for the
large and all-embracing interest of mankind. If that happened to him,
how, then, could he sing America?</p>

<p>The problem was clearing up now. In the exhilaration of this moment
of sharp vision the answers to his questions were beginning to come
through. He was beginning to see what he must do. And as he saw the end
of the road down which, willingly, hopefully, even joyfully, he had
been travelling with Esther, he saw, too--swiftly, finally,
irrevocably--that he must break with her and turn his back upon this
fabulous and enchanting world of hers--or lose his soul as an artist.
That is what it came down to.</p>

<p>But even in the very instant that he saw it, and knew that it was
so, and accepted it, he was overwhelmed with such a sudden sense of
loss that he all but cried out in his pain and love. Was there, then,
no simple truth and certainty to be found anywhere? Must one for ever
be stretched out on the rack? Forever in his youth he had envisioned
the starred face of the night with high exaltation and noble
inspiration, longing to dream great dreams and think great thoughts in
the company of the world's most honoured great. And now, in this very
moment of the dream come true, with the ones he had always envied from
afar surrounding him here 'on every side--now to have the selfless
grandeur turn to dust, and to see great night itself a reptile coiled
and waiting at the heart of life! To find no ear or utterance anywhere
for all the blazing, baffled certitudes of youth! To find man's faith
betrayed and his betrayers throned in honour, themselves the idols of
his bartered faith! To find truth false and falsehood truth, good evil,
evil good, and the whole web of life so changing, so mercurial!</p>

<p>It was all so different from the way he had once thought it would
be--and suddenly, convulsively, forgetful of his surroundings, he threw
out his arms in an instinctive gesture of agony and loss.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="chapter2-17"></a>17. Mr. Hirsch Could Wait</h2>

<p>Esther had seen George's gesture and wondered what it meant. She
disengaged herself from the people to whom she had been talking and
came over to him, a frown of tender solicitude on her face.</p>

<p>"Darling," she said eagerly, taking his hand and looking at him
earnestly, "how are you getting along? Are you all right?"</p>

<p>In his confusion and anguish he could not answer her for a moment,
and when he did, the guilty knowledge of the decision he had just
arrived at made him lash out angrily as though in self-defence.</p>

<p>"Who said I wasn't all right?" he demanded harshly. "Why shouldn't I
be?" And, instantly, seeing her gentle face, he was filled with baffled
and furious regret.</p>

<p>"Oh, all right, all right," she said hastily and placatingly. "I
just wanted to know if--are you having a good time?" she said, with a
little forced smile. "Don't you think it's a nice party--hah? You want
to meet anyone? You must know some of the people here."</p>

<p>Before he had a chance to say anything more Lily Mandell came
weaving through the crowded room to Mrs. Jack's side.</p>

<p>"0 Esther, darling," she said in a drowsy tone, "I wonder if you've
heard--" Seeing the young man, she paused. "Oh, hello. I didn't know
<i>you</i> were here." There was a note of protest in her voice.</p>

<p>These two had met before, but only casually. They shook hands. And
all at once Mrs. Jack's face was glowing with happiness. She put her
own hands in a firm clasp upon those of the man and woman, and
whispered:</p>

<p>"My two. Two of the people that I love best in the whole world. You
must know and love each other as I do you."</p>

<p>In the grip of her deep emotion she fell silent, while the other two
remained clumsily holding hands. After a moment, awkwardly, they let
their hands drop to their sides and stood ill at ease, looking at each
other.</p>

<p>Just then Mr. Lawrence Hirsch sauntered up. He was calm and assured,
and did not seem to be following anyone. His hands in he trouser
pockets of his evening clothes, a man fashionably at ease, urbanely
social, a casual ambler from group to group in this brilliant
gathering, informed, alert, suave, polished, cool, detached--he was the
very model of what a great captain of finance, letters, arts, and
enlightened principles should be.</p>

<p>"0 Esther," he said, "I must tell you what we have found out about
the case." The tone was matter-of-fact and undisturbed, carrying the
authority of calm conviction. "Two innocent men were put to death. At
last we have positive proof of it--evidence that was never allowed to
come to light. It proves beyond the shadow of a doubt that Vanzetti
could not have been within fifty miles of the crime."</p>

<p>Mr. Hirsch spoke quietly, and did not look at Miss Mandell.</p>

<p>"But how horrible!" cried Mrs. Jack, righteous anger blazing up in
her as she turned to Mr. Hirsch. "Isn't it dreadful to know that such
things can happen in a country like this! It's the most damnable thing
I ever heard of!"</p>

<p>For the first time, now, Mr. Hirsch turned to Miss Mandell,
casually, as if he had only just become aware of her presence. "Yes,
isn't it?" he said, including her with charming yet not over-zealous
intimacy within the range of his quiet enthusiasm. "Don't you
think--?"</p>

<p>Miss Mandell did not actually step on him. She just surveyed him
slowly, with a smouldering look of loathing. "<i>What!</i>" she said.
Then to Mrs. Jack: "<i>Really!</i> I simply can't--" She shrugged
helplessly, despairingly, and moved away, a miracle of sensual
undulance.</p>

<p>And Mr. Hirsch--he did not follow her, not even with a glance. Nor
did he show by so much as the flicker of a lash that he had seen or
heard or noticed anything. He went on talking in his well-modulated
tones to Mrs. Jack.</p>

<p>In the middle of what he was saying, suddenly he noticed George
Webber. "Oh, hello," he said. "How are you?" He detached one hand from
his elegant pocket and for a moment bestowed it on the young man, then
turned back again to Mrs. Jack, who was still burning with hot
indignation over what she had heard.</p>

<p>"These miserable people who could be guilty of such a thing!" she
exclaimed. "These despicable, horrible, rich people! It's enough to
make you want a revolution!" she cried.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear," said Mr. Hirsch with cool irony, "you may have your
wish gratified. It's not beyond the realm of possibility. And if it
comes, <i>that</i> case may still return to plague them yet. The
trials, of course, were perfectly outrageous, and the judge should have
been instantly dismissed."</p>

<p>"To think that there are people living who could do a thing like
that!" cried Mrs. Jack. "You know," she went on earnestly and somewhat
irrelevantly, "I have always been a Socialist. I voted for Norman
Thomas. You see," she spoke very simply and with honest self-respect,
"I've always been a worker. All my sympathy is on their side."</p>

<p>Mr. Hirsch's manner had become a trifle vague, detached, as if he
were no longer paying strict attention. "It is a <i>cause
c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i>," he said, and, seeming to like the sound of
the words, he repeated them portentously: "A <i>cause
c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i>."</p>

<p>Then, distinguished, polished, and contained, with casual hands
loose-pocketed beneath his tails, he sauntered on. He moved off in the
general direction of Miss Mandell. And yet he did not seem to follow
her.</p>

<p>For Mr. Lawrence Hirsch was wounded sorrowfully. But he could
wait.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>Beddoes! Beddoes!</i>"</p>

<p>At these strange words, so exultantly spoken that they rang round
the walls of the great room, people halted in the animation of their
talk with one another and, somewhat startled, looked in the direction
from which the sounds had proceeded.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>Beddoes</i> by all means!" the voice cried even more
exuberantly than before. "Hah-hah-hah! <i>Beddoes!</i>"--there was
gloating in the laugh. "Everyone must, of course, they simply
must!"</p>

<p>The speaker was Mr. Samuel Fetzer. He was not only an old friend of
Mrs. Jack's, but apparently he was also a familiar of many of the
people there, because when they saw who it was they smiled at one
another and murmured: "Oh, it's Sam," as if that explained
everything.</p>

<p>In the world to which he belonged Mr. Samuel Fetzer was known as
"the book-lover" <i>par excellence</i>. His very appearance suggested
it. One needed only to look at him to know that he was an epicure, a
taster of fine letters, a collector and connoisseur of rare editions.
One could see with half an eye that he was the kind of fellow you might
expect to find on a rainy afternoon in a musty old bookshop, peering
and poking and prowling round the stacks with a soft, cherubic glow on
his ruddy features, and occasionally fingering with a loving hand some
tattered old volume. He made one think somehow of a charming thatched
cottage in the English countryside--of a pipe, a shaggy dog, a
comfortable chair, a warm nook by the blazing fire, and an old book and
a crusty bottle--a bottle of old port! In fact, the exultant way in
which he now pronounced the syllables of "<i>Beddoes!</i>" suggested a
bottle of old port. He fairly smacked his lips over the word, as if he
had just poured himself a glass of the oldest and rarest vintage and
taken his first appraising sip.</p>

<p>His whole appearance confirmed this impression of him. His pleasant,
sensitive, glowing face, which wore a constant air of cherubic elation,
and his high bald forehead were healthily browned and weathered as if
he spent much time tramping in the open air. And, in contrast to the
other guests, who were all in formal evening dress, he had on tan,
thick-soled English walking shoes, woollen socks, grey flannel
trousers, a trifle baggy but fashionably Oxonian, a tweed coat of
brownish texture, a soft white shirt, and a red tie. One would have
said, at sight of him, that he must have just come in from a long walk
across the moors, and that now, pleasantly tired, he was looking
forward with easeful contemplation to an evening spent with his dog,
beside his fire, with a bottle of old port, and Beddoes. One would
never have guessed the truth--that he was an eminent theatrical
director whose life since childhood had been spent in the city, along
Broadway and among the most highly polished groups of urban
society.</p>

<p>He was talking now to Miss Mandell. She had wandered over to him
after leaving Mrs. Jack, and had asked him the provocative question
which had touched off his extraordinary demonstration of enthusiasm.
Miss Mandell was herself somewhat of an adept in the arts--a delver
into some of the rarer obscurities. She was forever asking people what
they thought of William Beckford's <i>Vathek</i>, the plays of Cyril
Tourneur, the sermons of Lancelot Andrewes, or--as now--the works of
Beddoes.</p>

<p>What she had said, to be exact, was: "Did you ever read anything by
a man named Beddoes?"</p>

<p>Miss Mandell had the habit of putting her questions that way, and
she would even use the same form of oblique reference when she spoke of
the more famous objects of her aesthetic interest. Thus she would
inquire what one knew about "a man named Proust", or "a woman named
Virginia Woolf". The phrase, accompanied as it always was by a dark and
smouldering look, carried an air of "There's more to this than meets
the eye". It made Miss Mandell appear to be a person of profound and
subtle knowingness, and one whose deep and devious searchings had gone
so far beyond the platitudes that might be found in the <i>Encyclopadia
Britannica</i> and other standard works that there was really no way
left for her to learn anything new except, possibly, through a quiet
talk with Mr. T. S. Eliot--or, since he wasn't handy, through an
occasional tentative yet not very optimistic question addressed to
someone of superior intelligence like oneself. And after one had
answered Miss Mandell and had poured forth whatever erudition one
commanded on the subject of her interest, her usual comment would be a
simple and non-committal "Um". This always produced a very telling
effect. For as Miss Mandell murmured "Um" and wandered off, the victim
was left flattened out, feeling that he had emptied himself dry and
still had been found childishly superficial and pathetically
wanting.</p>

<p>Not so, however, Mr. Samuel Fetzer. If Miss Mandell had hoped to
work this technique on him when she wove her languorous way to his side
and casually asked: "Did you ever read anything by a man named
Beddoes?"--she was in for a rude surprise. She had caught a tartar--a
cherubic tartar, it is true, a benevolent tartar, an exultant,
exuberant, elated tartar--but a. tartar nevertheless. For Mr. Fetzer
had not only <i>read</i> Beddoes: he felt that he had rather
<i>discovered</i> Beddoes. Beddoes was one of Mr. Fetzer's philobiblic
pets. So he was not only ready for Miss Mandell: it almost seemed as if
he had been waiting for her. She had hardly got the words out of her
mouth before he fairly pounced upon her, and his pleasant face lit up
all over with a look of cherubic glee as he cried:</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>Beddoes!</i>" The name rang out with such explosive
enthusiasm that Miss Mandell recoiled as if someone had thrown a
lighted firecracker at her feet, "<i>Beddoes!</i>" he chortled.
"<i>Beddoes!</i>"--he smacked his lips. "Hah-hah-hah!
<i>Beddoes!</i>"--he cast back his head, shook it, and chuckled
gloatingly. Then he told her about Beddoes' birth, about his life,
about his death, about his family, and his friends, about his sisters
and his cousins and his aunts, about things that were well known about
Beddoes, and about other things that no one in the world except Mr.
Samuel Fetzer had ever known about Beddoes. "Oh, <i>Beddoes!</i>" cried
Mr. Fetzer for the sixteenth time. "I love <i>Beddoes!</i> Everybody
must read <i>Beddoes!</i> <i>Beddoes</i> is----"</p>

<p>"But he <i>was</i> insane, wasn't he?" The quiet, well-bred voice
was that of Mr. Lawrence Hirsch, who had just wandered up casually, as
if attracted by the noise of cultural enthusiasm, and without seeming
to follow anyone. "I mean," he turned with an air of gracious
explanation to Miss Mandell, "it's an interesting example of the
schizophrenic personality, don't you think?"</p>

<p>She looked at him for a long moment as one might look at a large
worm within the core of a chestnut that one had hoped was sound.</p>

<p>"Um," said Miss Mandell, and with an expression of drowsy loathing
on her face she moved away.</p>

<p>Mr. Hirsch did not follow her. Perfectly possessed, he had already
shifted his glance back to the glowing Mr. Fetzer.</p>

<p>"I mean," he continued, with that inflection of interested inquiry
which is the mark everywhere of a cultivated intelligence, "it always
seemed to me that it was a case of misplaced personality--an
Elizabethan out of his time. Or do you think so?"</p>

<p>"Oh, absolutely!" cried Mr. Fetzer, with instant and enthusiastic
confirmation. "You see, what I have always maintained----"</p>

<p>Mr. Hirsch appeared to be listening carefully. He really was not
following anyone. He kept his eyes focused on Mr. Samuel Fetzer's face,
but something in their expression indicated that his mind was
elsewhere.</p>

<p>For Mr. Lawrence Hirsch was wounded sorrowfully. But he could
wait.</p>

<p>So it went all evening. Mr. Hirsch moved from group to sophisticated
group, bowing, smiling suavely, exchanging well-bred pleasantries with
all he met. Always he was imperturbable, authoritatively assured, on
his aesthetic toes. And his progress through that brilliant assemblage
was marked by a phosphorescent wake composed of the small nuggets of
enlightenment which he dropped casually as he passed. Here it was a
little confidential gossip about Sacco and Vanzetti, there a little
first-hand information from Wall Street, now a sophisticated jest or
so, again an amusing anecdote about what happened only last week to the
President, or a little something about Russia, with a shrewd
observation on Marxian economy--and to all of this a little Beddoes had
been added for good measure. It was all so perfectly informed and so
alertly modern that it never for a moment slipped into cliche, but
always represented the very latest mode in everything, whether art,
letters, politics, or economics. It was a remarkable performance, an
inspiring example of what the busy man of affairs can really accomplish
if he only applies himself.</p>

<p>And, in addition to all this, there was Miss Mandell. He never
seemed to follow her, but wherever she went he was not far behind. One
always knew that he was there. All evening long, whenever he came up to
any group and honoured it with one of his apt observations, and then,
turning casually and discovering that Miss Mandell was among the
company, made as if to include her in the intimate circle of his
auditors, she would just give him a smouldering look and walk away. So
it was no wonder that Mr. Lawrence Hirsch was wounded sorrowfully.</p>

<p>Still, he did not beat his breast, or tear his hair, or cry out:
"Woe is me!" He remained himself, the man of many interests, the master
of immense authorities. For he could wait.</p>

<p>He did not take her aside and say: "Thou art fair, my love; behold,
thou art fair, thou hast doves' eyes." Nor did he say: "Tell me, 0 thou
whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest." He did not remark to her that
she was beautiful as Tirzah, or comely as Jerusalem, or terrible as an
army with banners. He did not ask anyone to stay him with flagons, or
comfort him with apples, or confess that he was sick of love. And as
for saying to her: "Thy navel is like a round goblet, which wanteth not
liquor; thy belly is like an heap of wheat set about with lilies," the
idea had never occurred to him.</p>

<p>Though he did not cry out to her in his agony, what he was thinking
was: "Flaunt me with your mockery and scorn, spurn me with your foot,
lash me with your tongue, trample me like a worm, spit upon me like the
dust of which I am composed, revile me to your friends, make me crawl
far and humbly--do anything you like, I can endure it. But, oh, for
God's sake, notice me! Speak to me with just a word--if only with hate!
Stay near me for just a moment, make me happy with just a touch--even
if the nearness is but loathing, and the touch a blow! Treat me in any
way you will But I beg you, 0 beloved that thou art"--out of the corner
of his eye he followed her lavish undulations as she turned and walked
away again--"in God's name, let me see you know that I am here!"</p>

<p>But he said nothing. He showed nothing of what he felt. He was
sorrowfully wounded, but he could wait. And no one but Miss Mandell
knew how long she intended to keep him waiting.</p>

<h2><a name="chapter2-18"></a>18. Piggy Logan's Circus</h2>

<p>The hour had now arrived for Mr. Piggy Logan and his celebrated I
circus of wire dolls. Till now he had kept himself secreted in the
guest-room, and as he made his entrance there was a flurry of excited
interest in the brilliant throng. People in the dining-room crowded to
the door, holding tinkling glasses or loaded plates in their hands, and
even old Jake Abramson let his curiosity draw him away from the
temptations of the table long enough to appear in the doorway gnawing
at a chicken leg.</p>

<p>Mr. Piggy Logan was attired for his performance in a costume that
was simple yet extraordinary. He had on a thick blue turtleneck sweater
of the kind that was in favour with college heroes thirty years ago.
Across the front of it--God knows why--was sewn an enormous home-made
Y. He wore old white canvas trousers, tennis sneakers, and a pair of
battered knee pads such as were formerly used by professional
wrestlers. His head was crowned with an ancient football helmet, the
straps securely fastened underneath his heavy jowls. Thus arrayed, he
came forward, staggering between his two enormous valises.</p>

<p>The crowd made way for him and regarded him with awe. Mr. Logan
grunted under his burden, which he dropped with a thump in the middle
of the living-room floor, and breathed an audible sigh of relief.
Immediately he began pushing back the big sofa and all the chairs and
tables and other furniture until the centre of the room was clear. He
rolled back the rug, and then started taking books from the shelves and
dumping them on the floor. He looted half a dozen shelves in different
parts of the room and in the vacant spaces fastened up big circus
posters, yellow with age, which showed the familiar assortment of
tigers, lions, elephants, clowns, and trapeze performers, and bore such
descriptive legends as "Barnum &amp; Bailey--May 7th and 8th,"
"Ringling Brothers--July 31st."</p>

<p>The gathering watched him curiously as he went about this labour of
methodical destruction. When he had finished he came back to his
valises and began to take out their contents. There were miniature
circus rings made of rounded strips of tin or copper which fitted
neatly together. There were trapezes and flying swings. And there was
an astonishing variety of figures made of wire to represent all the
animals and performers. There were clowns and trapeze artists, acrobats
and tumblers, horses and bareback lady riders. There was almost
everything that one could think of to make a circus complete, and all
of it was constructed of wire.</p>

<p>Mr. Logan was down on his knee-pads extremely busy with his work,
his mind as completely focused on it as though he had been alone in the
room. He rigged up his trapezes and swings and took meticulous care in
arranging each of the little wire figures of elephants, lions, tigers,
horses, camels, and performers. He was evidently of a patient turn of
mind, and it took him half an hour, or more to set everything up. By
the time he had finished his labours and had erected a little sign
which said: "Main Entrance", all the guests, who at first had watched
him curiously, had grown tired of waiting and had resumed their
interrupted talking, eating, and drinking.</p>

<p>At length Mr. Logan was ready, and signified his willingness to
begin by a gesture to his hostess. She clapped her hands as loudly as
she could and asked for silence and attention.</p>

<p>But just then the door-bell rang, and a lot of new people were
ushered in by Nora. Mrs. Jack looked somewhat bewildered, for the new
arrivals were utter strangers. For the most part they were young
people. The young women had that unmistakable look of having gone to
Miss Spence's School, and there was something about the young men which
indicated that they were recently out of Yale and Harvard and
Princeton, and were members of the Racquet Club, and were now connected
with investment brokers in Wall Street.</p>

<p>With them was a large and somewhat-decayed looking lady of advanced
middle age. She had evidently been a beauty in her palmy days, but now
everything about her--arms, shoulders, neck, face, and throat--was
blown, full, and loose, and made up a picture of corrupted elegance. It
was a picture of what Amy Carleton <i>might</i> look like thirty years
from now, if she were careful and survived. One felt unpleasantly that
she had lived too long in Europe, probably on the Riviera, and that
somewhere in the offing there was something with dark, liquid eyes, a
little moustache, and pomaded hair--something quite young and private
and obscene and kept.</p>

<p>This lady was accompanied by an elderly gentleman faultlessly
attired in evening dress, as were all the others. He had a cropped
moustache and artificial teeth, which were revealed whenever he paused
to lick his thin lips lecherously and to stutter out: "What? What?"--as
he began to do almost at once. Both of these people looked exactly like
characters who might have been created by Henry James if he had lived
and written in a later period of decay.</p>

<p>The whole crowd of newcomers streamed in noisily, headed by a spruce
young gentleman in white tie and tails whose name was shortly to be
made known as Hen Walters. He was evidently a friend of Mr. Logan.
Indeed, they all seemed to be friends of Mr. Logan. For as Mrs. Jack,
looking rather overwhelmed at this invasion, advanced to greet them and
was dutifully murmuring her welcome, all of them swarmed right past
her, ignoring her completely, and stormed into the room shouting
vociferous gaieties at Mr. Logan. Without rising from his knee-pads, he
grinned at them fondly and with a spacious gesture of his freckled hand
beckoned them to a position along one wall. They crowded in and took
the place he had indicated. This forced some of the invited guests back
into the far corners, but the new arrivals seemed not to mind this at
all. Indeed, they paid not the slightest attention to anybody.</p>

<p>Then somebody in the group saw Amy Carleton and called across to
her. She came over and joined them, and seemed to know several of them.
And one could see that all of them had heard of her. The debutantes
were polite but crisply detached. After the formalities of greeting
they drew away and eyed Amy curiously and furtively, and their looks
said plainly: "So this is she!"</p>

<p>The young men were less reserved. They spoke to her naturally, and
Hen Walters greeted her quite cordially in a voice that seemed to be
burbling with suppressed fun. It was not a pleasant voice: it was too
moist, and it seemed to circulate round a nodule of fat phlegm. With
the gleeful elation which marked his whole manner he said loudly:</p>

<p>"Hello, Amy! I haven't seen you for an age. What brings you here?"
The tone indicated, with the unconscious arrogance of his kind, that
the scene and company were amusingly bizarre and beyond the pale of
things accepted and confirmed, and that to find anyone he knew in such
a place was altogether astounding.</p>

<p>The tone and its implications stung her sharply. As for herself, she
had so long been the butt of vicious gossip that she could take it with
good nature or complete indifference. But an affront to someone she
loved was more than she could endure. And she loved Mrs. Jack. So, now,
her green-gold eyes flashed dangerously as she answered hotly:</p>

<p>"What brings me here--of <i>all</i> places! Well, it's a very good
place to be--the best I know...And I <i>mean!</i>"--she laughed
hoarsely, jerked the cigarette from her mouth, and tossed her black
curls with furious impatience--"I <i>mean!</i> After all, I <i>was</i>
invited, you know!"</p>

<p>Instinctively, with a gesture of protective warmth, she had slipped
her arm round Mrs. Jack, who, wearing a puzzled frown upon her face,
was standing there as if still a little doubtful of what was
happening.</p>

<p>"Esther, darling," Amy said, "this is Mr. Hen Walters--and some of
his friends." For a moment she looked at the cluster of young
d&eacute;butantes and their escorts, and then turned away, saying to no
one in particular, and with no effort to lower her voice: "God, aren't
they simply dreadful!...I <i>mean!</i>...You <i>know!</i>"--she
addressed herself now to the elderly man with the artificial
teeth--"Charley--in the name of God, what are you trying to do?...You
old cradle-snatcher, you!...I <i>mean</i>!--after all, it's not
<i>that</i> bad, is it?" She surveyed the group of girls again and
turned away with a brief, hoarse laugh. "All these little Junior League
bitches!" she muttered. "God!...How do you stand it, anyway--you old
bastard!" She was talking now in her natural tone of voice,
good-naturedly, as though there was nothing in the least unusual in
what she Was saying. Then with another short laugh she added: "Why
don't you come to see me any more?"</p>

<p>He licked his lips nervously and bared his artificial teeth before
he answered:</p>

<p>"Wanted to see you, Amy, for ever so long...What?...Intended to stop
in...Matter of fact, did stop by some time ago, but you'd just
sailed...What?...You've been away, haven't you?...What?"</p>

<p>As he spoke in his clipped staccato he kept licking his thin lips
lecherously, and at the same time he scratched himself, rooting
obscenely into the inner thigh of his right leg in a way that suggested
he was wearing woollen underwear. In doing so he inadvertently pulled
up his trouser leg and it stayed there, revealing the tops of his socks
and a portion of white meat.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Hen Walters was smiling brightly and burbling on to Mrs.
Jack:</p>

<p>"So nice of you to let us all come in"--although she, poor lady, had
had nothing at all to do with it. "Piggy told us it would be all right.
I hope you don't mind."</p>

<p>"But no-o--not at all!" she protested, still with a puzzled look.
"Any friends of Mr. Logan's...But won't you all have a drink, or
something to eat? There's loads----"</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>heavens</i>, no!" burbled Mr. Walters. "We've all been to
Tony's and we simply <i>gorged</i> ourselves! If we took another
mouthful, I'm absolutely positive we should explode!"</p>

<p>He uttered these words with such ecstatic jubilation that it seemed
he might explode at any moment in a large, moist bubble. "Well, then,
if you're sure," she began.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>absolutely!</i>" cried Mr. Walters rapturously. "But we're
holding up the show!" he exclaimed. "And, after all, that's what we're
here to see. It would simply be a tragedy to miss it...0 Piggy!" he
shouted to his friend, who had been cheerfully grinning all the while
and crawling about on his knee-pads. "Do begin! Everyone's simply dying
to see it!...I've seen it a dozen times myself," he announced gleefully
to the general public, "and it becomes more fascinating every time...So
if you're ready, please begin!"</p>

<p>Mr. Logan was ready.</p>

<p>The new arrivals held their position along one wall, and the other
people now withdrew a little, leaving them to themselves. The audience
was thus divided into two distinct halves--the people of wealth and
talent on one side, and those of wealth and fashion or "Society" on the
other.</p>

<p>On a signal from Mr. Logan, Mr. Walters detached himself from his
group, came over, arranged the tails of his coat, and knelt down
gracefully beside his friend. Then, acting on instructions, he read
aloud from a typewritten paper which Mr. Logan had handed to him. It
was a whimsical document designed to put everybody in the right mood,
for it stated that in order to enjoy and understand the circus one must
make an effort to recover his lost youth and have the spirit of a child
again. Mr. Walters read it with great gusto in a cultivated tone of
voice which almost ran over with happy laughter. When he had finished,
he got up and resumed his place among his friends, and Mr. Logan then
began his performance.</p>

<p>It started, as all circuses should, with a grand procession of the
performers and the animals in the menagerie. Mr. Logan accomplished
this by taking each wire figure in his thick hand and walking it round
the ring and then solemnly out again. Since there was a great many
animals and a great many performers, this took some time, but it was
greeted at its conclusion with loud applause.</p>

<p>Then came an exhibition of bareback riders. Mr. Logan galloped his
wire horses into the ring and round and round with movements of his
hand. Then he put the riders on top of the wire horses, and, holding
them firmly in place, he galloped these round too. Then there was an
interlude of clowns, and he made the wire figures tumble about by
manipulating them with his hands. After this came a procession of wire
elephants. This performance gained particular applause because of the
clever way in which Mr. Logan made the figures imitate the swaying,
ponderous lurch of elephants--and also because people were not always
sure what each act meant, and when they were able to identify
something, a pleasant little laugh of recognition would sweep the crowd
and they would clap their hands to show they had got it.</p>

<p>There were a good many acts of one kind or another, and at last the
trapeze performers were brought on. It took a little while to get this
act going because Mr. Logan, with his punctilious fidelity to reality,
had first to string up a little net below the trapezes. And when the
act did begin it was unconscionably long, chiefly because Mr. Logan was
not able to make it work. He set the little wire figures to swinging
and dangling from their perches. This part went all right. Then he
tried to make one little figure leave its trapeze, swing through the
air, and catch another figure by its downswept hands. This wouldn't
work. Again and again the little wire figure soared through the air,
caught at the outstretched hands of the other doll--and missed
ingloriously. It became painful. People craned their necks and looked
embarrassed. But Mr. Logan was not embarrassed. He giggled happily with
each new failure and tried again. It went on and on. Twenty minutes
must have passed while Mr. Logan repeated his attempts. But nothing
happened. At length, when it became obvious that nothing was going to
happen, Mr. Logan settled the whole matter himself by taking one little
figure firmly between two fat fingers, conveying it to the other, and
carefully hooking it on to the other's arms. Then he looked up at his
audience and giggled cheerfully, to be greeted after a puzzled pause by
perfunctory applause.</p>

<p>Mr. Logan was now ready for the grand climax, the <i>pi&egrave;ce de
r&egrave;sistance</i> of the entire occasion. This was his celebrated
sword-swallowing act. With one hand he picked up a small rag doll,
stuffed with wadding and with crudely painted features, and with the
other hand he took a long hairpin, bent it more or less straight,
forced one end through the fabric of the doll's mouth, and then began
patiently and methodically to work it down the rag throat. People
looked on with blank faces, and then, as the meaning of Mr. Logan's
operation dawned on them, they smiled at one another in a puzzled,
doubting way.</p>

<p>It went on and on until it began to be rather horrible. Mr. Logan
kept working the hairpin down with thick, probing fingers, and when
some impediment of wadding got in his way he would look up and giggle
foolishly. Halfway down he struck an obstacle that threatened to stop
him from going any farther. But he persisted--persisted horribly.</p>

<p>It was a curious spectacle and would have furnished interesting
material for the speculations of a thoughtful historian of life and
customs in this golden age. It was astounding to see so many
intelligent men and women--people who had had every high and rare
advantage of travel, reading, music, and aesthetic cultivation, and who
were usually so impatient of the dull, the boring, and the
trivial--patiently assembled here to give their respectful attention to
Mr. Piggy Logan's exhibition. But even respect for the accepted mode
was wearing thin. The performance had already lasted a weary time, and
some of the guests were beginning to give up. In pairs and groups they
would look at one another with lifted eyebrows, and quietly would
filter out into the hall or in the restorative direction of the
dining-room.</p>

<p>Many, however, seemed determined to stick it out. As for the young
"Society" crowd, all of them continued to look on with eager interest.
Indeed, as Mr. Logan went on probing with his hairpin, one young woman
with the pure, cleanly chiselled face so frequently seen in members of
her class turned to the young man beside her and said:</p>

<p>"I think it's <i>frightfully</i> interesting--the way he does that.
Don't you?"</p>

<p>And the young man, evidently in the approved accent, said briefly:
"Eh!"--an ejaculation which might have been indicative of almost
anything, but which was here obviously taken for agreement. This
interchange between them had taken place, like all the conversations in
the group, in a curiously muffled, clipped speech. Both the girl and
the young man had barely opened their mouths--their words had come out
between almost motionless lips. This seemed to be the fashionable way
of talking among these people.</p>

<p>As Mr. Logan kept working and pressing with his hairpin, suddenly
the side of the bulging doll was torn open and some of the stuffing
began to ooze out. Miss Lily Mandell watched with an expression of
undisguised horror and, as the doll began to lose its entrails, she
pressed one hand against her stomach in a gesture of nausea, said
"Ugh!"--and made a hasty exit. Others followed her. And even Mrs. Jack,
who at the start of the performance had slipped on a wonderful jacket
of gold thread and seated herself cross-legged on the floor like a
dutiful child, squarely before the maestro and his puppets, finally got
up and went out into the hall, where most of her guests were now
assembled.</p>

<p>Almost no one was left to witness the concluding scenes of Mr. Piggy
Logan's circus except the uninvited group of his own particular
friends.</p>

<p>Out in the hall Mrs. Jack found Lily Mandell talking to George
Webber. She approached them with a bright, affectionate little smile
and queried hopefully:</p>

<p>"Are you enjoying it, Lily? And you, darling?"--turning fondly to
George--"Do you like it? Are you having a good time?" Lily answered in
a tone of throaty disgust:</p>

<p>"When he kept on pushing that long pin into the doll and all its
insides began oozing out--ugh!"--she made a nauseous face--"I simply
couldn't stand it any longer! It was horrible! I had to get out! I
thought I was going to puke!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Jack's shoulders shook, her face reddened, and she gasped in a
hysterical whisper:</p>

<p>"I know! Wasn't it awful!"</p>

<p>"But what is it, anyway?" said the attorney, Roderick Hale, as he
came up and joined them.</p>

<p>"Oh, hello, Rod!" said Mrs. Jack. "What do you make of it Hale?"</p>

<p>"I can't make it out," he said, with an annoyed look into the
living-room, where Piggy Logan was still patiently carrying on. "What
is it all supposed to be, anyway? And who is this fellow?" he said in
an irritated tone, as if his legal and fact-finding mind was annoyed by
a phenomenon he could not fathom. "It's like some puny form of
decadence," he murmured.</p>

<p>Just then Mr. Jack approached his wife and, lifting his shoulders in
a bewildered shrug, said:</p>

<p>"What is it? My God, perhaps <i>I'm</i> crazy!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Jack and Lily Mandell bent together, shuddering helplessly as
women do when they communicate whispered laughter to one another.</p>

<p>"Poor Fritz!" Mrs. Jack gasped faintly.</p>

<p>Mr. Jack cast a final bewildered look into the living-room, surveyed
the wreckage there, then turned away with a short laugh:</p>

<p>"I'm going to my room!" he said with decision. "Let me know if he
leaves the furniture!"</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="chapter2-19"></a>19. Unscheduled Climax</h2>

<p>At the conclusion of Mr. Logan's performance there was a ripple of
applause in the living-room, followed by the sound of voices. The
fashionable young people clustered round Mr. Logan, chattering
congratulations. Then, without paying attention to anybody else, and
without a word to their hostess, they left.</p>

<p>Other people now gathered about Mrs. Jack and made their farewells.
They began to leave, singly and in pairs and groups, until presently no
one remained except those intimates and friends who are always the last
to leave a big party--Mrs. Jack and her family, George Webber, Miss
Mandell, Stephen Hook, and Amy Carleton. And, of course, Mr. Logan, who
was busy amid the general wreckage he had created, putting his wire
dolls back into his two enormous valises.</p>

<p>The atmosphere of the whole place was now curiously changed. It was
an atmosphere of absence, of completion. Everybody felt a little bit as
one feels in a house the day after Christmas, or an hour after a
wedding, or on a great liner at one of the Channel ports when most of
the passengers have disembarked and the sorrowful remnant know that the
voyage is really over and that they are just marking time for a little
while until their own hour comes to depart.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jack looked at Piggy Logan and at the chaos he had made of her
fine room, and then glanced questioningly at Lily Mandell as if to say:
"Can you understand all this? What has happened?" Miss Mandell and
George Webber surveyed Mr. Logan with undisguised distaste. Stephen
Hook remained aloof, looking bored. Mr. Jack, who had come forth from
his room to bid his guests good-bye and had lingered by the elevator
till the last one had gone, now peered in through the hall door at the
kneeling figure in the living-room, and with a comical gesture of
uplifted hands said: "What is it?"--leaving everybody convulsed with
laughter.</p>

<p>'But even when Mr. Jack came into the room and stood staring down
quizzically, Mr. Logan did not look up. He seemed not to have heard
anything. Utterly oblivious of their presence, he was happily absorbed
in the methodical task of packing up the litter that surrounded
him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the two rosy-cheeked maids, May and Janie, were busily
clearing away glasses, bottles, and bowls of ice, and Nora started
putting the books back on their shelves. Mrs. Jack looked on rather
helplessly, and Amy Carleton stretched herself out flat on the floor
with her hands beneath her head, closed her eyes, and appeared to go to
sleep. All the rest were obviously at a loss what to do, and just stood
and sat around, waiting for Mr. Logan to finish and be gone.</p>

<p>The place had sunk back into its wonted quiet. The blended murmur of
the unceasing city, which during the party had been shut out and
forgotten, now penetrated the walls of the great building and closed in
once more upon these lives. The noises of the street were heard
again.</p>

<p>Outside, below them, there was the sudden roar of a fire truck, the
rapid clanging of its bell. It turned the corner into Park Avenue and
the powerful sound of its motors faded away like distant thunder. Mrs.
Jack went to the window and looked out. Other trucks now converged upon
the corner from different directions until four more had passed from
sight.</p>

<p>"I wonder where the fire can be," she remarked with detached
curiosity. Another truck roared down the side street and thundered into
Park. "It must be quite a big one--six engines have driven past. It
must be somewhere in this neighbourhood."</p>

<p>Amy Carleton sat up and blinked her eyes, and for a moment all of
them were absorbed in idle speculation about where the fire might be.
But presently they began to look again at Mr. Logan. At long last his
labours seemed to be almost over. He began to close the big valises and
adjust the straps.</p>

<p>Just then Lily Mandell turned her head towards the hall, sniffed
sharply, and suddenly said:</p>

<p>"Does anyone smell smoke?"</p>

<p>"Hah? What?" said Mrs. Jack. And then, going into the hall, she
cried excitedly: "But yes! There is quite a strong smell of smoke out
here! I think it would be just as well if we got out of the building
until we find out what's wrong." Her face was now burning with
excitement. "I suppose we'd better," she said. "Everybody come on!"
Then: "0 Mr. Logan!"--she raised her voice, and now for the first time
he lifted his round and heavy face with an expression of inquiring
innocence--"I say--I think perhaps we'd all better get out, Mr. Logan,
until we find out where the fire is! Are you ready?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," said Mr. Logan cheerfully. "But fire?"--in a
puzzled tone. "What fire? Is there a fire?"</p>

<p>"I think the building is on fire," said Mr. Jack smoothly, but with
an edge of heavy irony, "so perhaps we'd better all get out--that is,
unless you prefer to stay."</p>

<p>"Oh no," said Mr. Logan brightly, getting clumsily to his feet. "I'm
quite ready, thank you, except for changing my clothes--"</p>

<p>"I think that had better wait," said Mr. Jack.</p>

<p>"Oh, the girls!" cried Mrs. Jack suddenly, and, snapping the ring on
and off her finger, she trotted briskly towards the dining-room,
"Nora--Janie--May! Girls! We're all going downstairs--there's a fire
somewhere in the building. You'll have to come with us till we find out
where it is."</p>

<p>"Fire, Mrs. Jack?" said Nora stupidly, staring at her mistress.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jack saw at a glance her dull eye and her flushed face, and
thought: "She's been at it again! I might have known it!" Then aloud,
impatiently:</p>

<p>"Yes, Nora, fire. Get the girls together and tell them they'll have
to come along with us. And--oh!--Cook!" she cried quickly. "Where is
Cookie? Go get her, someone. Tell her she'll have to come, too!"</p>

<p>The news obviously upset the girls. They looked helplessly at one
another and began to move aimlessly round, as if no longer certain what
to do.</p>

<p>"Shall we take our things, Mrs. Jack?" said Nora, looking at her
dully. "Will we have time to pack?"</p>

<p>"Of course not, Nora!" exclaimed Mrs. Jack, out of all patience.
"We're not moving out! We're simply going downstairs till we can learn
where the fire is and how bad it is!...And Nora, please get Cook and
bring her with you! You know how rattled and confused she gets!"</p>

<p>"Yes'm," said Nora, staring at her helplessly. "An' will that be all
mum?---I mean"--and gulped--"will we be needin' anything?"</p>

<p>"For heaven's sake, Nora--<i>no!</i>...Nothing except your coats.
Tell the girls and Cook to wear their coats."</p>

<p>"Yes'm," said Nora dumbly, and after a moment, looking fuddled and
confused, she went uncertainly through the dining-room to the
kitchen.</p>

<p>Mr. Jack meanwhile, had gone out into the hall and was ringing the
elevator bell. There, after a short interval, his family, guests, and
servants joined him. Quietly he took stock of them:</p>

<p>Esther's face was flaming with suppressed excitement, but her
sister, Edith, who had hardly opened her mouth all evening and had been
so inconspicuous that no one had noticed her, was her usual pale, calm
self. Good girl, Edith! His daughter, Alma, he observed with
satisfaction, was also taking this little adventure in her stride. She
looked cool, beautiful, a bit bored by it all. The guests, of course,
were taking it as a lark--and why not?--<i>they</i> had nothing to
lose. All except that young Gentile fool--George What's-his-name. Look
at him now--all screwed up and tense, pacing back and forth and darting
his feverish glances in all directions. You'd think it was <i>his</i>
property that was going up in smoke!</p>

<p>But where was that Mr. Piggy Logan? When last seen, he was
disappearing into the guest-room. Was the idiot changing his clothes
after all?--Ah, here he comes! "At least," thought Mr. Jack humorously,
"it must be he, for if it isn't who in the name of God is it?"</p>

<p>The figure that Mr. Logan now cut as he emerged from the guest-room
and started down the hall was, indeed, a most extraordinary one. All of
them turned to look at him and saw that he was taking no chances of
losing his little wire dolls or his street clothes in any fire. Still
wearing the "costume" that he had put on for his performance, he came
grunting along with a heavy suitcase in each hand, and over one
shoulder he had slung his coat, vest, and trousers, his overweight tan
shoes were tied together by their laces and hung suspended round his
neck, where they clunked against his chest as he walked, and on his
head, perched on top of the football helmet, was his neat grey hat. So
accoutred, he came puffing along, dropped his bags near the elevator,
then straightened up and grinned cheerfully.</p>

<p>Mr. Jack kept on ringing the bell persistently, and presently the
voice of Herbert, the elevator boy, could be heard shouting up the
shaft from a floor or two below:</p>

<p>"All right! All right! I'll be right up, folks, as soon as I take
down this load!"</p>

<p>The sound of other people's voices, excited, chattering, came up the
shaft to them; then the elevator door banged shut and they could hear
the car going down.</p>

<p>There was nothing to do but wait. The smell of smoke in the hallway
was getting stronger all the time, and although no one was seriously
alarmed, even the phlegmatic Mr. Logan was beginning to feel the
nervous tension.</p>

<p>Soon the elevator could be heard coming up again. It mounted
steadily--and then suddenly stopped somewhere just below them. Herbert
could be heard working his lever and fooling with the door. Mr. Jack
rang the bell impatiently. There was no response. He hammered on the
door. Then Herbert shouted up again, and he was so near that all of
them could hear every word:</p>

<p>"Mr. Jack, will you all please use the service elevator. This one's,
out of order. I can't go any farther."</p>

<p>"Well, that's that," said Mr. Jack.</p>

<p>He put on his derby, and without another word started down the hall
towards the service landing. In silence the others followed him.,</p>

<p>At this moment the lights went out. The place was plunged in inky
blackness. There was a brief, terrifying moment when the women caught
their breaths sharply. In the darkness the smell of smoke seemed much
stronger, more acrid and biting, and it was beginning to make their
eyes smart. Nora moaned a little, and all; the servants started to mill
round like stricken cattle. But they calmed down at the comforting
assurance in Mr. Jack's quiet voice speaking in the dark:</p>

<p>"Esther," he said calmly, "we'll have to light candles. Can you
tell' me where they are?"</p>

<p>She told him. He reached into a table drawer, pulled out a
flashlight, and went through a door that led to the kitchen. Soon he
reappeared with a box of tallow candles. He gave one to each person and
lighted them.</p>

<p>They were now a somewhat ghostly company. The women lifted their
candles and looked at one another with an air of bewildered surmise.
The faces of the maids and Cookie, in the steady flame that each held
before her face, looked dazed and frightened. Cookie wore a confused,
fixed smile and muttered jargon to herself. Mrs. Jack, deeply excited,
turned questioningly to George, who was at her side:</p>

<p>"Isn't it strange?" she whispered. "Isn't it the strangest thing? I
mean--the party--all the people--and then this." And, lifting her
candle higher, she looked about her at the ghostly company.</p>

<p>And, suddenly, George was filled with almost unbearable love and
tenderness for her, because he knew that she, like himself, felt in her
heart the mystery and strangeness of all life. And his emotion was all
the more poignant because in the same instant, with sharp anguish, he
remembered his decision, and knew that they had reached the parting of
the ways.</p>

<p>Mr. Jack flourished his candle as a signal to the others and led the
procession down the hall. Edith, Alma, Miss Mandell, Amy Carleton, and
Stephen Hook followed after him. Mr. Logan, who came next, was in a
quandary. He couldn't manage both his baggage and his light, so after a
moment of indecision he blew out his candle, set it on the floor,
seized his valises, gave a mighty heave, and, with neck held stiff to
keep his hat from tumbling off of the football helmet, he staggered
after the retreating figures of the women. Mrs. Jack and George came
last, with the servants trailing behind.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jack had reached the door that opened on to the service landing
when she heard a confused shuffling behind her in the line, and when
she glanced back along the hallway she saw two teetering candles
disappearing in the general direction of the kitchen. It was Cook and
Nora.</p>

<p>"Oh Lord!" cried Mrs. Jack in a tone of exasperation and despair.
"What on earth are they trying to do?...<i>Nora!</i>" She raised her
voice sharply. Cook had already disappeared, but Nora heard her and
turned in a bewildered way. "Nora, where <i>are</i> you going?" shouted
Mrs. Jack impatiently.</p>

<p>"Why--why, mum--I just thought I'd go back here an' get some
things," said Nora in a confused and thickened voice.</p>

<p>"No you <i>won't</i>, either!" cried Mrs. Jack furiously, at the
same time thinking bitterly: "She probably wanted to sneak back there
to get another drink!"</p>

<p>"You come right along with us!" she called sharply. "And where is
Cook?" Then, seeing the two bewildered girls, May and Janie, milling
round helplessly, she took them by the arm and gave them a little push
towards the door. "You girls get along!" she cried. "What are you
gawking at?"</p>

<p>George had gone back after the befuddled Nora, and, after seizing
her and herding her down the hall, had dashed into the kitchen to find
Cook. Mrs. Jack followed him with her candle held high in her hand, and
said anxiously:</p>

<p>"Are you there, darling?" Then, calling out loudly: "Cook!
<i>Cook!</i> Where are you?"</p>

<p>Suddenly Cook appeared like a spectral visitant, still clutching her
candle and flitting from room to room down the narrow hall of the
servants' quarters. Mrs. Jack cried out angrily:</p>

<p>"Oh, Cookie! What <i>are</i> you doing? You've simply got to come on
now! We're waiting on you!" And she thought to herself again, as she
had thought so many times before: "She's probably an old miser. I
suppose she's got her wad hoarded away back there somewhere. That's why
she hates to leave."</p>

<p>Cook had disappeared again, this time into her own room. After a
brief, fuming silence Mrs. Jack turned to George. They looked at each
other for a moment in that strange light and circumstance, and suddenly
both laughed explosively.</p>

<p>"My God!" shrieked Mrs. Jack. "Isn't it the damnedest----"</p>

<p>At this moment Cook emerged once more and glided away down the hall.
They yelled at her and dashed after her, and caught her just as she was
about to lock herself into a bathroom.</p>

<p>"Now Cook!" cried Mrs. Jack angrily. "Come on now! You simply
must!"</p>

<p>Cook goggled at her and muttered some incomprehensible jargon in an
ingratiating tone.</p>

<p>"Do you hear, Cook?" Mrs. Jack cried furiously. "You've got to come
now! You can't stay here any longer!"</p>

<p>"<i>Augenblick!</i> <i>Augenblick!</i>" muttered Cook
cajolingly.</p>

<p>At last she thrust something into her bosom, and, still looking
longingly behind her, allowed herself to be prodded, pushed, and
propelled down the servants' hall, into the kitchen, through the door
into the main hallway, and thence out to the service landing.</p>

<p>All the others were now gathered there, waiting while Mr. Jack
tested the bell of the service elevator. His repeated efforts brought
no response, so in a few moments he said coolly:</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose there's nothing for us to do now except to walk
down."</p>

<p>Immediately he headed for the concrete stairs beside the elevator
shaft, which led, nine flights down, to the ground floor and safety.
The others followed him. Mrs. Jack and George herded the servants
before them and waited for Mr. Logan to get a firm grip on his
suitcases and start down, which at length he did, puffing and blowing
and letting the bags bump with loud thuds on each step as he
descended.</p>

<p>The electric lights on the service stairways were still burning
dimly, but they clung to their candles with an instinctive feeling that
these primitive instruments were now more to be trusted than the
miracles of science. The smoke had greatly increased. In fact, the air
was now so dense with floating filaments and shifting plumes that
breathing was uncomfortable.</p>

<p>From top to bottom the service stairs provided an astounding
spectacle. Doors were opening now on every floor and other tenants were
coming out to swell the tide of refugees. They made an extraordinary
conglomeration--a composite of classes, types, and characters that
could have been found nowhere else save in a New York apartment house
such as this. There were people in splendid evening dress, and
beautiful women blazing with jewels and wearing costly wraps. There
were others in pyjamas who had evidently been awakened from sleep and
had hastily put on slippers, dressing-gowns, kimonos, or whatever
garments they could snatch up in the excitement of the moment. There
were young and old, masters and servants, a mixture of a dozen races
and their excited babel of strange tongues. There were German cooks and
French maids, English butlers and Irish serving girls. There were
Swedes and Danes and Italians and Norwegians, with a sprinkling of
White Russians. There were Poles and Czechs and Austrians, Negroes and
Hungarians. All of these poured out helter-skelter on the
landing-stages of the service stairway, chattering, gesticulating,
their interests all united now in their common pursuit of safety.</p>

<p>As they neared the ground floor, helmeted firemen began to push
their way up the stairs against the tide of downward-moving traffic.
Several policemen followed them and tried to allay any feelings of
alarm or panic.</p>

<p>"It's all right, folks! Everything's O.K.!" one big policeman
shouted cheerfully as he went up past the members of the Jack party.
"The fire's over now!"</p>

<p>These words, spoken to quiet the people and to expedite their
orderly progress from the building, had an opposite effect from that
which the policeman had intended. George Webber, who was bringing up
the end of the procession, paused upon hearing these reassuring words,
called to the others, and turned to retrace his way upstairs again. As
he did so, he saw that the policeman was about to throw a fit. From the
landing half a flight above, he was making agonised faces and frantic
gestures at George in a silent and desperate entreaty to him not to
come back any farther or to encourage the others to come back, but to
leave the building as quickly as possible. The others had looked round
when George had called, and had witnessed this pantomime--so now,
genuinely alarmed for the first time, they turned again and fled down
the stairs as fast as they could go.</p>

<p>George himself, seized with the same momentary panic, was hastening
after them when he heard some tapping and hammering noises from the
shaft of the service elevator. They seemed to come from up above
somewhere. For just a moment he hesitated and listened. The tapping
began, then stopped...began again...stopped again. It seemed to be a
signal of some kind, but he couldn't make it out. It gave him an eerie
feeling. A chill ran up his spine. He broke out in goose flesh.
Stumbling blindly, he fled after the others.</p>

<p>As they came out into the great central court-yard of the building,
their moment's terror dropped away from them as quickly as it had come
upon them. They filled their lungs with the crisp, cold air, and so
immediate was their sense of release and relief that each one of them
felt a new surge of life and energy, a preternaturally heightened
aliveness. Mr. Logan, his round face streaming with perspiration and
his breath coming in loud snorts and wheezes, summoned his last
remaining strength and, ignoring the tender shins of those about him,
bumped and banged his burdened way through the crowd and disappeared.
The others of Mr. Jack's party remained together, laughing and talking
and watching with alert interest everything that was going on round
them.</p>

<p>The scene of which they were a part was an amazing one. As if it had
been produced by the combining genius of a Shakespeare or a Breughel,
the whole theatre of human life was in it, so real and so miraculously
compressed that it had the nearness and the intensity of a vision. The
great hollow square formed by the towering walls of the building was
filled with people in every conceivable variety of dress and undress.
And from two dozen entry ways within the arched cloisters that ran
round the court on all four sides, new hordes of people were now
constantly flooding out of the huge honeycomb to add their own colour
and movement and the babel of their own tumultuous tongues to the
pageantry and the pandemonium already there. Above this scene, uplifted
on the arches of the cloisters, the mighty walls soared fourteen
storeys to frame the starry heavens. In the wing where Mr. Jack's
apartment was the lights were out and all was dark, but everywhere else
those beetling sides were still blazing with their radiant squares of
warmth, their many cells still burning with all the huge deposit of
their just-departed life.</p>

<p>Except for the smoke that had been in some of the halls and
stairways, there was no sign of fire. As yet, few people seemed to
comprehend the significance of the event which had so unceremoniously
dumped them out of their sleek nests into the open weather. For the
most part they were either bewildered and confused or curious and
excited. Only an occasional person here and there betrayed any undue
alarm over the danger which had touched their lives and fortunes.</p>

<p>Such a one now appeared at a second-floor window on the side of the
court directly opposite the Jacks' entry. He was a man with a bald head
and a pink, excited face, and it was instantly apparent that he was on
the verge of emotional collapse. He threw open the window and in a tone
shaken by incipient hysteria cried out loudly:</p>

<p>"Mary!...Mary!" His voice rose almost to a scream as he sought for
her below.</p>

<p>A woman in the crowd came forward below the window, looked up, and
said quietly:</p>

<p>"Yes, Albert."</p>

<p>"I can't find the key!" he cried in a trembling voice. "The door's
locked! I can't get out!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Albert," said the woman more quietly and with evident
embarrassment, "don't get so excited, dear. You're in no danger--and
the key is bound to be there somewhere. I'm sure you'll find it if you
look."</p>

<p>"But I tell you it isn't here!" he babbled. "I've looked, and it's
not here! I can't find it!...Here, you fellows!" he shouted to some
firemen who were dragging a heavy hose across the gravelled court. "I'm
locked in! I want out of here!"</p>

<p>Most of the firemen paid no attention to him at all, but one of them
looked up at the man, said briefly: "O.K., chief!"--and then went on
about his work.</p>

<p>"Do you hear me?" the man screamed. "You firemen, you! I tell
you...1"</p>

<p>"Dad...Dad"--a young man beside the woman on the ground now spoke up
quietly--"don't get so excited. You're in no danger there. All the fire
is on the other side. They'll let you out in a minute when they can get
to you."</p>

<p>Across the court, at the very entrance from which the Jacks had
issued, a man in evening clothes, accompanied by his chauffeur, had
been staggering in and out with great loads of ponderous ledgers. He
had already accumulated quite a pile of them, which he was stacking up
on the gravel and leaving under the guardianship of his butler. From
the beginning this man had been so absorbed in what he was doing that
he was completely unconscious of the milling throng round him. Now, as
he again prepared to rush into the smoke-filled corridor with his
chauffeur, he was stopped by the police.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, sir," the policeman said, "but you can't go in there
again. We've got orders not to let anybody in."</p>

<p>"But I've got to!" the man shouted. "I'm Philip J. Baer!" At the
sound of this potent name, all those within hearing distance instantly
recognised him as a wealthy and influential figure in the motion
picture industry, and one whose accounts had recently been called into
investigation by a board of governmental inquiry. "There are
seventy-five millions dollars' worth of records in my apartment," he
shouted, "and I've got to get them out! They've got to be saved!"</p>

<p>He tried to push his way in, but the policeman thrust him back.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Mr. Baer," he said obdurately, "but we have our orders.
You can't come in."</p>

<p>The effect of this refusal was instantaneous and shocking. The one
principle of Mr. Baer's life was that money is the only thing that
counts because money can buy anything. That principle had been flouted.
So the naked philosophy of tooth and claw, which in moments of security
and comfort was veiled beneath a velvet sheath, now became ragingly
insistent. A tall, dark man with a rapacious, beak-nosed face, he
became now like a wild animal, a beast of prey. He went charging about
among the crowds of people, offering everyone fabulous sums if they
would save his cherished records. He rushed up to a group of firemen,
seizing one of them by the arm and shaking him, shouting:</p>

<p>"I'm Philip J. Baer--I live in there! You've got to help me! I'll
give any man here ten thousand dollars if he'll get my records
out!"</p>

<p>The burly fireman turned his weathered face upon the rich man. "On
your way, brother!" he said.</p>

<p>"But I tell you!" Mr. Baer shouted. "You don't know who I am!
I'm----"</p>

<p>"I don't care who you are!" the fireman said. "On your way now!
We've got work to do!"</p>

<p>And, roughly, he pushed the great man aside.</p>

<p>Most of the crowd behaved very well under the stress of these
unusual circumstances. Since there was no actual fire to watch, the
people shifted and moved about, taking curious side looks at one
another out of the corners of their eyes. Most of them had never even
seen their neighbours before, and now for the first time they had an
opportunity to appraise one another. And in a little while, as the
excitement and their need for communication broke through the walls of
their reserve, they began to show a spirit of fellowship such as that
enormous beehive of life had never seen before. People who, at other
times, had never deigned so much as to nod at each other were soon
laughing and talking together with the familiarity of long
acquaintance.</p>

<p>A famous courtesan, wearing a chinchilla coat which her aged but
wealthy lover had given her, now took off this magnificent garment and,
walking over to an elderly woman with a delicate, patrician face, she
threw the coat over this woman's thinly covered shoulders, at the same
time saying in a tough but kindly voice:</p>

<p>"You wear this, dearie. You look cold."</p>

<p>And the older woman, after a startled expression had crossed her
proud face, smiled graciously and thanked her tarnished sister in a
sweet tone. Then the two women stood talking together like old
friends.</p>

<p>A haughty old Bourbon of the Knickerbocker type was seen engaged in
cordial conversation with a Tammany politician whose corrupt
plunderings were notorious, and whose companionship, in any social
sense, the Bourbon would have spurned indignantly an hour before.</p>

<p>Aristocrats of ancient lineage who had always held to a tradition of
stiff-necked exclusiveness could be seen chatting familiarly with the
plebeian parvenus of the new rich who had got their names and money,
both together, only yesterday.</p>

<p>And so it went everywhere one looked. One saw race-proud Gentiles
with rich Jews, stately ladies with musical-comedy actresses, a woman
famous for the charities with a celebrated whore.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the crowd continued to watch curiously the labours of the
firemen. Though no flames were visible, there was plenty of smoke in
some of the halls and corridors, and the firemen had dragged in many
lengths of great white hose which now made a network across the court
in all directions. From time to time squadrons of helmeted men would
dash into the smoky entries of the wing where the lights were out and
would go upstairs, their progress through the upper floors made evident
to the crowd below by the movement of their flashlights at the darkened
windows. Others would emerge from the lower regions of basements and
subterranean passages, and would confer intimately with their chiefs
and leaders.</p>

<p>All at once somebody in the waiting throng noticed something and
pointed towards it. A murmur ran through the crowd, and all eyes were
turned upwards searchingly to one of the top-floor apartments in the
darkened wing. There, through an open window four floors directly above
the Jack's apartment, wisps of smoke could be seen curling upwards.</p>

<p>Before very long the wisps increased to clouds, and suddenly a great
billowing puff of oily black smoke burst through the open window,
accompanied by a dancing shower of sparks. At this the whole crowd drew
in its collective breath in a sharp intake of excitement--the strange,
wild joy that people always feel when they see fire.</p>

<p>Rapidly the volume of smoke increased. That single room on the top
floor was apparently the only one affected, but now the black and
oily-looking smoke was billowing out in belching folds, and inside the
room the smoke was coloured luridly by the sinister and unmistakable
glow of fire.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jack gazed upwards with a rapt and fascinated expression. She
turned to Hook with one hand raised and lightly clenched against her
breast, and whispered slowly:</p>

<p>"Steve--isn't it the strangest--the most----?" She did not finish.
With her eyes full of the deep sense of wonder that she was trying to
convey, she just stood with her hand loosely clenched and looked at
him.</p>

<p>He understood her perfectly--too well, indeed. His heart was sick
with fear, with hunger, and with fascinated wonder. For him the whole
scene was too strong, too full of terror and overwhelming beauty to be
endured. He was sick with it, fainting with it. He wanted to be borne
away, to be sealed hermetically somewhere, in some dead and easeful air
where he would be free forever more of this consuming fear that racked
his flesh. And yet he could not tear himself away. He looked at
everything with sick but fascinated eyes. He was like a man mad with
thirst who drinks the waters of the sea and sickens with each drop he
drinks, yet cannot leave off drinking because of the wetness and the
coolness to his lips. So he looked and loved it all with the desperate
ardour of his fear. He saw the wonder of it, the strangeness of it, the
beauty and the magic and the nearness of it. And it was so much more
real than anything imagination could contrive that the effect was
overpowering. The whole thing took on an aura of the incredible.</p>

<p>"It can't be true," he thought. "It's unbelievable. But here it
is!"</p>

<p>And there it was. He didn't miss a thing. And yet he stood there
ridiculously, a derby hat upon his head, his hands thrust into the
pockets of his overcoat, the velvet collar turned up round his neck,
his face, as usual, turned three-quarters away from the whole world,
his heavy-lidded, wearily indifferent eyes surveying the scene with
Mandarin contempt, as if to say: "Really, what is this curious
assembly? Who are these extraordinary creatures that go milling about
me? And why is everyone so frightfully eager, so terribly earnest about
everything?"</p>

<p>A group of firemen thrust past him with the dripping brass-nozzled
end of a great hose. It slid through the gravel like the tough-scaled
hide of a giant boa constrictor, and as the firemen passed him, Hook
heard their booted feet upon the stones and he saw the crude strength
and the simple driving purpose in their coarse faces. And his heart
shrank back within him, sick with fear, with wonder, with hunger, and
with love at the unconscious power, joy, energy, and violence of life
itself.</p>

<p>At the same moment a voice in the crowd--drunken, boisterous, and
too near--cut the air about him. It jarred his ears\, angered him, and
made him timorously hope it would not come closer. Turning slightly
towards Mrs. Jack, in answer to her whispered question, he murmured in
a bored tone:</p>

<p>"Strange?...Um...yes. An interesting revelation of the native
<i>moeurs</i>."</p>

<p>Amy Carleton seemed really happy. It was as if, for the first time
that evening, she had found what she was looking for. Nothing in her
manner or appearance had changed. The quick, impetuous speech, the
broken, semi-coherent phrases, the hoarse laugh, the exuberant
expletives, and the lovely, dark, crisp-curled head with its snub nose
and freckled face were just the same. Still there was something
different about her. It was as if all the splintered elements of her
personality had now, in the strong and marvellous chemistry of the
fire, been brought together into crystalline union. She was just as she
had been before, except that her inner torment had somehow been let
out, and wholeness let in.</p>

<p>Poor child! It was now instantly apparent to those who knew her
that, like so many other "lost" people, she would not have been lost at
all--if only there could always be a fire. The girl could not accept
getting up in the morning or going to bed at night, or doing any of the
accustomed things in their accustomed order. But she could and did
accept the fire. It seemed to her wonderful. She was delighted with
everything that happened. She threw herself into it, not as a
spectator, but as a vital and inspired participant. She seemed to know
people everywhere, and could be seen moving about from group to group,
her ebony head bobbing through the crowd, her voice eager, hoarse,
abrupt, elated. When she returned to her own group she was full of it
all.</p>

<p>"I <i>mean!</i>...You <i>know!</i>" she burst out. "These firemen
here!"--she gestured hurriedly towards three or four helmeted men as
they dashed into a smoke-filled entry with a tube of chemicals--"when
you think of what they have to <i>know</i>!--of what they have to
<i>do</i>!--I went to a big fire once!"--she shot out quickly in
explanatory fashion--"a guy in the department was a friend of mine!--I
<i>mean!</i>"--she laughed hoarsely, elatedly--"when you <i>think</i>
of what they have to----"</p>

<p>At this point there was a splintering crash within. Amy laughed
jubilantly and made a quick and sudden little gesture as if this
answered everything.</p>

<p>"After <i>all</i>, I mean!" she cried.</p>

<p>While this was going on, a young girl in evening dress had wandered
casually up to the group and, with that freedom which the fire had
induced among all these people, now addressed herself in the flat,
nasal, and almost toneless accents of the Middle West to Stephen
Hook:</p>

<p>"You don't think it's very bad, do you?" she said, looking up at the
smoke and flames that were now belching formidably from the top-floor
window. Before anyone had a chance to answer, she went on: "I
<i>hope</i> it's not bad."</p>

<p>Hook, who was simply terrified at her raw intrusion, had turned away
from her and was looking at her sideways with eyes that were almost
closed. The girl, getting no answer from him, spoke now to Mrs.
Jack:</p>

<p>"It'll be just too bad if anything is wrong up there, won't it?"
Mrs. Jack, her face full of friendly reassurance, answered quickly in a
gentle voice.</p>

<p>"No, dear," she said, "I don't think it's bad at all." She looked up
with trouble in her eyes at the billowing mass of smoke and flame which
now, to tell the truth, looked not only bad but distinctly threatening;
then, lowering her perturbed gaze quickly, she said to the girl
encouragingly: "I'm sure everything is going to be all right."</p>

<p>"Well," said the girl, "I hope you're right...Because," she added,
apparently as an afterthought as she turned away, "that's Mama's room,
and if she's up there it'll be just too bad, won't it?--I mean, if it
is too bad."</p>

<p>With this astounding utterance, spoken casually in a flat voice that
betrayed no emotion whatever, she moved off into the crowd.</p>

<p>There was dead silence for a moment. Then Mrs. Jack turned to Hook
in alarm, as if she were not certain she had heard aright.</p>

<p>"Did you hear?--" she began in a bewildered tone.</p>

<p>"But there you <i>are!</i>" broke in Amy, with a short, exultant
laugh. "What I <i>mean</i> is--the whole thing's <i>there!</i>"</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="chapter2-20"></a>20. Out of Control</h2>

<p>Suddenly all the lights in the building went out, plunging the court
in darkness save for the fearful illumination provided by the bursts of
flame from the top-floor apartment. There was a deep murmur and a
restless stir in the crowd. Several young smart alecks in evening
clothes took this opportunity to go about among the dark mass of
people, arrogantly throwing the beams of their flashlights into the
faces of those they passed.</p>

<p>The police now began to move upon the crowd, and, good-naturedly but
firmly, with outstretched arms, started to herd everybody back, out of
the court, through the arches, and across the surrounding streets. The
streets were laced and criss-crossed everywhere with bewildering skeins
of hose, and all normal sounds were lost in the powerful throbbing of
the fire-engines. Unceremoniously, like driven cattle, the residents of
the great building were forced back to the opposite pavements, where
they had to take their places among the humbler following of the
general public.</p>

<p>Some of the ladies, finding themselves too thinly clad in the cold
night air, sought refuge in the apartments of friends who lived in the
neighbourhood. Others, tired of standing round, went to hotels to wait
or to spend the night. But most of the people hung on, curious and
eager to what the outcome might be. Mr. Jack took Edith, Alma, Amy, and
two or three young people of Amy's acquaintance to a near-by hotel for
drinks. The others stayed and looked on curiously for a while. But
presently Mrs. Jack, George Webber, Miss Mandell, and Stephen Hook
repaired to a drug-store that was close at hand. They sat at the
counter, ordered coffee and sandwiches, and engaged in eager chatter
with other refugees who now filled the store.</p>

<p>The conversation of all these people was friendly and casual. Some
were even gay. But in their talk there was also now a note of
perturbation--of something troubled, puzzled, and uncertain. Men of
wealth and power had been suddenly dispossessed from their snug nests
with their wives, families, and dependents, and now there was nothing
they could do but wait, herded homelessly into drug-stores and hotel
lobbies, or huddled together in their wraps on street corners like
shipwrecked voyagers, looking at one another with helpless eyes. Some
of them felt, dimly, that they had been caught up by some mysterious
and relentless force, and that they were being borne onwards as
unwitting of the power that ruled them as blind flies fastened to a
revolving wheel. To others came the image of a tremendous web in which
they felt they had become enmeshed--a web whose ramifications were so
vast and complicated that they had not the faintest notion where it
began or what its pattern was.</p>

<p>For in the well-ordered world in which these people lived, something
had gone suddenly wrong. Things had got out of control. They were the
lords and masters of the earth, vested with authority and accustomed to
command, but now the control had been taken from them. So they felt
strangely helpless, no longer able to command the situation, no longer
able even to find out what was happening.</p>

<p>But, in ways remote from their blind and troubled kenning, events
had been moving to their inexorable conclusion.</p>

<hr align="center" width="15%">
<p>In one of the smoky corridors of that enormous hive, two men in
boots and helmets had met in earnest communion.</p>

<p>"Did you find it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Where is it?"</p>

<p>"It's in the basement, chief. It's not on the roof at all--a draught
is taking it up a vent. But it's down there." He pointed with his
thumb.</p>

<p>"Well, then, go get it. You know what to do."</p>

<p>"It looks bad, chief. It's going to be hard to get."</p>

<p>"What's the trouble?"</p>

<p>"If we flood the basement, we'll also flood two levels of railroad
tracks. You know what that means."</p>

<p>For a moment their eyes held each other steadily. Then the older man
jerked his head and started for the stairs.</p>

<p>"Come on," he said. "We're going down."</p>

<p>Down in the bowels of the earth there was a room where lights were
burning and it was always night.</p>

<p>There, now, a telephone rang, and a man with a green eyeshade seated
at a desk answered it.</p>

<p>"Hello...Oh, hello, Mike."</p>

<p>He listened carefully for a moment, suddenly jerked forward taut
with interest, and pulled the cigarette out of his mouth.</p>

<p>"The hell you say!...Where? Over track thirty-two?...They're going
to flood it!...Hell!"</p>

<p>Deep in the honeycombs of the rock the lights burned green and red
and yellow, silent in the eternal dark, lovely, poignant as remembered
grief. Suddenly, all up and down the faintly gleaming rails, the green
and yellow eyes winked out and flashed to warning red.</p>

<p>A few blocks away, just where the network of that amazing underworld
of railroad yards begins its mighty flare of burnished steel, the
Limited halted swiftly, but so smoothly that the passengers, already
standing to debark, felt only a slight jar and were unaware that
anything unusual had happened.</p>

<p>Ahead, however, in the cab of the electric locomotive which had
pulled the great train the last miles of its span along the Hudson
River, the engineer peered out and read the signs. He saw the shifting
patterns of hard light against the dark, and swore:</p>

<p>"Now what the hell?"</p>

<p>And as the great train slid to a stop, the current in the third rail
was shut off and the low whine that always came from the powerful
motors of the locomotive was suddenly silenced. Turning now across his
instruments to another man, the engineer spoke quietly:</p>

<p>"I wonder what the hell has happened," he said.</p>

<p>For a long time the Limited stood a silent and powerless thing of
steel, while a short distance away the water flooded down and flowed
between the tracks there like a river. And five hundred men and women
who had been caught up from their lives and swiftly borne from cities,
towns, and little hamlets all across the continent were imprisoned in
the rock, weary, impatient, frustrated--only five minutes away from the
great station that was the end and goal of their combined desire. And
in the station itself other hundreds waited for them--and went on
waiting--restless, wondering, anxious, knowing nothing about the why of
it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on the seventh landing of the service stairs in the
evacuated building, firemen had been working feverishly with axes. The
place was dense with smoke. The sweating men wore masks, and the only,
light they had was that provided by their torchlights.</p>

<p>They had battered open the doorway of the elevator shaft, and one of
them had lowered himself down on to the roof of the imprisoned car half
a floor below and was now cutting into the roof with his sharp axe.</p>

<p>"Have you got it, Ed?"</p>

<p>"Yeah--just about...I'm almost through...This next one does it, I
think."</p>

<p>The axe smashed down again. There was a splintering crash. And
then:</p>

<p>"O.K...Wait a minute...Hand me down the flashlight, Tom."</p>

<p>"See anything?"</p>

<p>In a moment, quietly:</p>

<p>"Yeah...I'm going in...Jim, you better come down, too. I'll need
you."</p>

<p>There was a brief silence, then the man's quiet voice again:</p>

<p>"O.K...I've got it...Here, Jim, reach down and get underneath the
arms...Got it?...O.K...Tom, you better reach down and help
Jim...Good."</p>

<p>Together they lifted it from its imprisoned trap, looked at it for a
moment in the flare of their flashlights, and laid it down, not
ungently, on the floor--something old and tired and dead and very
pitiful.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jack went to the window of the drug-store and peered out at the
great building across the street.</p>

<p>"I wonder if anything's happening over there," she said to her
friends with a puzzled look on her face. "Do you suppose it's over?
Have they got it out?"</p>

<p>The dark immensity of those towering walls told nothing, but there
were signs that the fire was almost out. There were fewer lines of hose
in the street, and one could see firemen pulling them in and putting
them back in the trucks. Other firemen were coming from the building,
bringing their tools and stowing them away. All the great engines were
still throbbing powerfully, but the lines that had connected them with
the hydrants were uncoupled, and the water they were pumping now came
from somewhere else and was rushing in torrents down all the gutters.
The police still held the crowd back and would not yet permit the
tenants to return to their apartments.</p>

<p>The newspapermen, who had early arrived upon the scene, were now
beginning to come into the drug-store to telephone their stories to the
papers. They were a motley crew, a little shabby and threadbare, with
battered hats in which their Press cards had been stuck, and some of
them had the red noses which told of long hours spent in
speak-easies.</p>

<p>One would have known that they were newspapermen even without their
Press cards. The signs were unmistakable. There was something jaded in
the eye, something a little worn and tarnished about the whole man,
something that got into his face, his tone, the way he walked, the way
he smoked a cigarette, even into the hang of his trousers, and
especially into his battered hat, which revealed instantly that these
were gentlemen of the Press.</p>

<p>It was something wearily receptive, wearily cynical, something that
said wearily: "I know, I know. But what's the story? What's the
racket?"</p>

<p>And yet it was something that one liked, too, something corrupted
but still good, something that had once blazed with hope and
aspiration, something that said: "Sure. I used to think I had it in me,
too, and I'd have given my life to write something good. Now I'm just a
whore. I'd sell my best friend out to get a story. I'd betray your
trust, your faith, your friendliness, twist everything you say around
until any sincerity, sense, or honesty that might be in your words was
made to sound like the maunderings of a buffoon or a clown--if I
thought it would make a better story. I don't give a damn for truth,
for accuracy, for facts, for telling anything about you people here,
your lives, your speech, the way you look, the way you really are, the
special quality, tone, and weather of this moment--of this fire--except
insofar as they will help to make a story. What I went to get is the
special 'angle' on it. There has been grief and love and fear and
ecstasy and pain and death to-night: a whole universe of living has
been here enacted. But all of it doesn't matter a damn to me if I can
only pick up something that will make the customers sit up tomorrow and
rub their eyes--if I can tell 'em that in the excitement Miss Lena
Ginster's pet boa constrictor escaped from its cage and that the police
and fire departments are still looking for it while Members of
Fashionable Apartment House Dwell in Terror...So there I am, folks,
with yellow fingers, weary eyeballs, a ginny breath, and what is left
of last night's hangover, and I wish to God I could get to that
telephone to send this story in, so the boss would tell me to go home,
and I could step round to Eddy's place for a couple more highballs
before I call it another day. But don't be too hard on me. Sure, I'd
sell you out, of course. No man's name or any woman's reputation is
safe with me--if I can make a story out of it--but at bottom I'm not
such a bad guy. I have violated the standards of decency again and
again, but in my heart I've always wanted to be decent. I don't tell
the truth, but there's a kind of bitter honesty in me for all that. I'm
able to look myself in the face at times, and tell the truth about
myself and see just what I am. And I hate sham and hypocrisy and
pretence and fraud and crookedness, and if I could only be sure that
to-morrow was going to be the last day of the world--oh, Christ!--what
a paper we'd get out in the morning! And, too, I have a sense of
humour, I love gaiety, food, drink, good talk, good companionship, the
whole thrilling pageantry of life. So don't be too severe on me. I'm
really not as bad as some of the things I have to do."</p>

<p>Such, indefinably yet plainly, were the markings of these men. It
was as if the world which had so soiled them with its grimy touch had
also left upon them some of its warm earthiness--the redeeming virtues
of its rich experience, its wit and understanding, the homely
fellowship of its pungent speech.</p>

<p>Two or three of them now went round among the people in the
drug-store and began to interview them. The questions that they asked
seemed ludicrously inappropriate. They approached some of the younger
and prettier girls, found out if they lived in the building, and
immediately asked, with naive eagerness, whether they were in the
Social Register. Whenever any of the girls admitted that she was, the
reporters would write down her name and the details of her
parentage.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, one of the representatives of the Press, a rather
seedy-looking gentleman with a bulbous red nose and infrequent teeth,
had called his City Desk on the telephone and, sprawled in the booth
with his hat pushed back on his head and his legs sticking out through
the open door, was reporting his findings. George Webber was standing
with a group of people at the back of the store, near the booth. He had
noticed the reporter when he first came in, and had been fascinated by
something in his seedy, hard-boiled look; and now, although George
appeared to be listening to the casual chatter around him, he was
really hanging with concentrated attention on every word the man was
saying:</p>

<p>"...Sure, that's what I'm tellin' yuh. Just take it down...The
police arrived," he went on importantly, as if fascinated by his own
journalese--"the police arrived and threw a cordon round the building."
There was a moment's pause, then the red-nosed man rasped out
irritably: "No, no, no! Not a squadron! A cordon!...What's
'at?...<i>Cordon</i>, I say! C-o-r-d-o-n--cordon!...For Pete's sake!"
he went on in an aggrieved tone. "How long have you been workin' on a
newspaper, anyway? Didn't yuh ever hear of a cordon before?...Now get
this. Listen----" he went on in a careful voice, glancing at some
scrawled notes on a piece of paper in his hand. "Among the residents
are included many Social Registerites and others prominent among the
younger set...What? How's that?" he said abruptly, rather puzzled.
"Oh!"</p>

<p>He looked round quickly to see if he was being overheard, then
lowered his voice and spoke again:</p>

<p>"Oh, sure! <i>Two!</i>...Nah, there was only two--that other story
was all wrong. They found the old dame...But that's what I'm tellin'
yuh! She was all alone when the fire started--see! Her family was out,
and when they got back they thought she was trapped up there. But they
found her. She was down in the crowd. That old dame was one of the
first ones out...Yeh--only two. Both of 'em was elevator men." He
lowered his voice a little more, then, looking at his notes, he read
carefully: "John Enborg...age sixty-four...married...three
children...lives in Jamaica, Queens...You got that?" he said, then
proceeded: "And Herbert Anderson...age twenty-five...unmarried...lives
with his mother...841 Southern Boulevard, the Bronx...Have yuh got it?
Sure. Oh, sure!"</p>

<p>Once more he looked round, then lowered his voice before he spoke
again:</p>

<p>"No, they couldn't get 'em out. They was both on the elevators,
goin' up to get the tenants--see!--when some excited fool fumbled for
the light switches and grabbed the wrong one and shut the current off
on 'em...Sure. That's the idea. They got caught between the
floors...They just got Enborg out," his voice sank lower. "They had to
use axes...Sure. Sure." He nodded into the mouthpiece. "That's
it--smoke. Too late when they got to him...No, that's all. Just those
two...No, they don't know about it yet. Nobody knows. The management
wants to keep it quiet if they can...What's that? Hey!--speak louder,
can't yuh? You're mumblin' at me!"</p>

<p>He had shouted sharply, irritably, into the instrument, and now
listened attentively for a moment.</p>

<p>"Yeh, it's almost over. But it's been tough. They had trouble
gettin' at it. It started in the basement, then it went up a flue and
out at the top...Sure, I know," he nodded. "That's what made it so
tough. Two levels of tracks are right below. They were afraid to flood
the basement at first--afraid to risk it. They tried to get at it with
chemicals, but couldn't...Yeh, so they turned off the juice down there
and put the water on it. They probably got trains backed up all the way
to Albany by now...Sure, they're pumpin' it out. It's about over, I
guess, but it's been tough...O.K., Mac. Want me to stick
around?...O.K.," he said, and hung up.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="chapter2-21"></a>21. Love Is Not Enough</h2>

<p>The fire was over. Mrs. Jack and those who were with her went out on
the street when they heard the first engine leaving. And there on the
pavement were Mr. Jack, Edith, and Alma. They had met some old friends
at the hotel and had left Amy and her companions with them.</p>

<p>Mr. Jack looked in good spirits, and his manner showed, mildly and
pleasantly, that he had partaken of convivial refreshment. Over his arm
he was carrying a woman's coat, which he now slipped round his wife's
shoulders, saying:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Feldman sent you this, Esther. She said you could send it back
to-morrow."</p>

<p>All this time she had had on nothing but her evening dress. She had
remembered to tell the servants to wear their coats, but both she and
Miss Mandell had forgotten theirs.</p>

<p>"How sweet of her!" cried Mrs. Jack, her face beginning to glow as
she thought how kind everyone was in a time of stress. "Aren't people
good?"</p>

<p>Other refugees, too, were beginning to straggle back now and were
watching from the corner, where the police still made them wait. Most
of the fire-engines had already gone, and the rest were throbbing
quietly with a suggestion of departure. One by one the great trucks
thundered away. And presently the policemen got the signal to let the
tenants return to their rooms.</p>

<p>Stephen Hook said good night and walked off, and the others started
across the street towards the building. From all directions people were
now streaming through the arched entrances into the court, collecting
maids, cooks, and chauffeurs as they came. An air of disorder and
authority had been re-established among them, and one could hear
masters and mistresses issuing commands to their servants. The
cloister-like arcades were filled with men and women shuffling quietly
into their entryways.</p>

<p>The spirit of the crowd was altogether different now from what it
had been a few hours earlier. All these people had recaptured their
customary assurance and poise. The informality and friendliness that
they had shown to one another during the excitement had vanished. It
was almost as if they were now a little ashamed of the emotions which
had betrayed them into injudicious cordialities and unwonted
neighbourliness. Each little family group had withdrawn frigidly into
its own separate entity and was filing back into its own snug cell.</p>

<p>In the Jacks' entry a smell of smoke, slightly stale and acrid,
still clung to the walls, but the power had been restored and the
elevator was running again. Mrs. Jack noticed with casual surprise that
the doorman, Henry, took them up, and she asked if Herbert had gone
home. He paused just perceptibly, and then answered in a flat tone:</p>

<p>"Yes, Mrs. Jack."</p>

<p>"You all must be simply worn out!" she said warmly, with her instant
sympathy. "Hasn't it been a thrilling evening?" she went on eagerly.
"In all your life did you ever know of such excitement, such confusion,
as we had to-night?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," the man said, in a voice so curiously unyielding that
she felt stopped and baffled by it, as she had many times before. And
she thought:</p>

<p>"What a strange man he is! And what a difference between people!
Herbert is so warm, so jolly, so human. You can talk to <i>him</i>. But
this one--he's so stiff and formal you can never get inside of him. And
if you try to speak to him, he snubs you--puts you in your place as if
he doesn't want to have anything to do with you."</p>

<p>She felt wounded, rebuffed, almost angry. She was herself a friendly
person, and she liked people round her to be friendly, too--even the
servants. But already her mind was worrying loosely at the curious
enigma of the doorman's personality:</p>

<p>"I wonder what's wrong with him," she thought. "He seems always so
unhappy, so disgruntled, nursing some secret grievance all the time. I
wonder what has done it to him. Oh, well, poor thing, I suppose the
life he leads is enough to turn anyone sour--opening doors and calling
cabs and helping people in and out of cars and answering questions all
night long. But then, Herbert has it even worse--shut up in this stuffy
elevator and riding up and down all the time where he can't see
anything and where nothing ever happens--and yet he's always so sweet
and so obliging about everything!"</p>

<p>And, giving partial utterance to her thoughts, she said:</p>

<p>"I suppose Herbert had a harder time of it to-night than any of you,
getting all these people out."</p>

<p>Henry made no answer whatever. He simply seemed not to have heard
her. He had stopped the elevator and opened the door at their own
landing, and now said in his hard, expressionless voice: "This is your
floor, Mrs. Jack."</p>

<p>After they got out and the car had gone down, she was so annoyed
that she turned to her family and guests with flaming cheeks, and said
angrily:</p>

<p>"Honestly, that fellow makes me tired! He's such a grouch! And he's
getting worse every day! It's got so now he won't even answer when you
speak to him!"</p>

<p>"Well, Esther, maybe he's tired out to-night," suggested Mr. Jack
pacifically. "They've all been under a pretty severe strain, you
know."</p>

<p>"So I suppose that's <i>our</i> fault?" said Mrs. Jack ironically.
And then, going into the living-room and seeing again the chaos left
there by Mr. Logan's performance, she had a sudden flare of her quick
and jolly wit, and with a comical shrug said: "Vell, ve should have a
fire sale!"--which restored her to good humour.</p>

<p>Everything seemed curiously unchanged--curiously, because so much
had happened since their excited departure. The place smelled close and
stale, and there was still a faint tang of smoke. Mrs. Jack told Nora
to open the windows. Then the three maids automatically resumed their
interrupted routine and quickly tidied up the room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jack excused herself for a moment and went into her own room.
She took off the borrowed coat and hung it in the closet, and carefully
brushed and adjusted her somewhat disordered hair.</p>

<p>Then she went over to the window, threw up the sash as far as it
would go, and filled her lungs full of the fresh, invigorating air. She
found it good. The last taint of smoke was washed clean and sweet away
by the cool breath of October. And in the white light of the moon the
spires and ramparts of Manhattan were glittering with cold magic. Peace
fell upon her spirit. Strong comfort and assurance bathed her whole
being. Life was so solid and splendid, and so good.</p>

<p>A tremor, faint and instant, shook her feet. She paused, startled;
waited, listening...Was the old trouble with George there again to
shake the deep perfection of her soul? He had been strangely quiet
to-night. Why, he had hardly said two words all evening. What was the
matter with him?...And what was the rumour she had heard this night?
Something about stocks falling. During the height of the party she had
overheard Lawrence Hirsch say something like that. She hadn't paid any
attention at the time, but now it came back. "Faint tremors in the
market"--that's what he had said. What was this talk of tremors?</p>

<p>--Ah, there it was a second time! What was it?</p>

<p>--Trains again!</p>

<p>It passed, faded, trembled delicately away into securities of
eternal stone, and left behind the blue dome of night, and of October.
The smile came back into her eyes. The brief and troubled frown had
lifted. Her look as she turned and started towards the living-room was
almost dulcet and cherubic--the look of a good child who ends the great
adventure of another day.</p>

<p>Edith and Alma had retired immediately on coming in, and Lily
Mandell, who had gone into one of the bedrooms to get her wraps, now
came out wearing her splendid cape.</p>

<p>"Darling, it has been too marvellous," she said throatily, wearily,
giving Mrs. Jack an affectionate kiss. "Fire, smoke, Piggy Logan,
everything--I've simply adored it!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Jack shook with laughter.</p>

<p>"Your parties are too wonderful!" Miss Mandell concluded. "You never
know what's going to happen next!"</p>

<p>With that she said her good-byes and left.</p>

<p>George was also going now, but Mrs. Jack took him by the hand and
said coaxingly:</p>

<p>"Don't go yet. Stay a few minutes and talk to me."</p>

<p>Mr. Jack was obviously ready for his bed. He kissed his wife lightly
on the cheek, said good night casually to George, and went to his room.
Young men could come, and young men could go, but Mr. Jack was going to
get his sleep.</p>

<p>Outside, the night was growing colder, with a suggestion of frost in
the air. The mammoth city lay fathoms deep in sleep. The streets were
deserted, save for an occasional taxi-cab that drilled past on some
urgent nocturnal quest. The pavements were vacant and echoed hollowly
to the footfalls of a solitary man who turned the corner into Park and
headed briskly north towards home and bed. The lights were out in all
the towering office buildings, except for a single window high up in
the face of a darkened cliff which betrayed the presence of some
faithful slave of business who was working through the night upon a
dull report that had to be ready in the morning.</p>

<p>At the side entrance of the great apartment house, on the now empty
cross street, one of the dark green ambulances of the police department
had slid up very quietly and was waiting with a softly throbbing motor.
No one was watching it.</p>

<p>Shortly a door which led down to a basement opened. Two policemen
came out, bearing a stretcher, which had something sheeted on it that
was very still. They slid this carefully away into the back of the
green ambulance.</p>

<p>A minute later the basement door opened again and a sergeant
emerged. He was followed by two more men in uniform who carried a
second stretcher with a similar burden. This, too, was carefully
disposed of in the same way.</p>

<p>The doors of the vehicle dicked shut. The driver and another man
walked round and got into the front seat. And after a hushed word or
two with the sergeant, they drove off quietly, turning the corner with
a subdued clangour of bells.</p>

<p>The three remaining officers spoke together for a moment longer in
lowered voices, and one of them wrote down notes in his little book.
Then they said good night, saluted, and departed, each walking off in a
different direction to take up again his appointed round of duty.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, inside the imposing front entrance, under a light within
the cloistered walk, another policeman was conferring with the doorman,
Henry. The doorman answered the questions of the officer in a toneless,
monosyllabic, sullen voice, and the policeman wrote down the answers in
another little book.</p>

<p>"You say the younger one was unmarried?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"How old?"</p>

<p>"Twenty-five."</p>

<p>"And where did he live?"</p>

<p>"In the Bronx."</p>

<p>His tone was so low and sullen that it was hardly more than a
mutter, and the policeman lifted his head from the book and rasped out
harshly:</p>

<p>"<i>Where?</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>The Bronx!</i>" said Henry furiously.</p>

<p>The man finished writing in his book, put it away into his pocket,
then in a tone of casual speculation he said:</p>

<p>"Well, I wouldn't want to live up there, would you? It's too damn
far away."</p>

<p>"Nah!" snapped Henry. Then, turning impatiently away, he began: "If
that's all you want----"</p>

<p>"That's <i>all</i>," the policeman cut in with brutal and ironic
geniality. "That's all, <i>brother</i>."</p>

<p>And with a hard look of mirth in his cold eyes, he swung his
nightstick behind him and watched the retreating figure of the doorman
as it went inside and disappeared in the direction of the elevator.</p>

<hr align="center" width="15%">
<p>Up in the Jack's living-room, George and Esther were alone together.
There was now an air of finality about everything. The party was over,
the fire was over, all the other guests had gone.</p>

<p>Esther gave a little sigh and sat down beside George. For a moment
she looked round her with an expression of thoughtful appraisal.
Everything was just the same as it had always been. If anyone came in
here now, he would never dream that anything had happened.</p>

<p>"Wasn't it all strange?" she said musingly. "The party--and then the
fire!...I mean, the <i>way</i> it happened." Her tone had grown a
little vague, as if there was something she could not quite express. "I
don't know, but the way we were all sitting here after Mr. Logan's
performance...then all of a sudden the fire-engines going past...and we
didn't know...we thought they were going somewhere else. There was
something so--sort of weird--about it." Her brow was furrowed with her
difficulty as she tried to define the emotion she felt. "It sort of
frightens you, doesn't it?--No, not the fire!" she spoke quickly. "That
didn't amount to anything. No one got hurt. It was terribly exciting,
really...What I mean is"--again the vague and puzzled tone--"when you
think of how...<i>big</i>...things have got...I mean, the way people
live nowadays...in these big buildings...and how a fire can break out
in the very house you live in, and you not even know about it...There's
something sort of <i>terrible</i> in that, isn't there?...And God!" she
burst out with sudden eagerness. "In all your life did you ever see the
like of them? I mean the kind of people who live here--they way they
all looked as they poured out into the court?"</p>

<p>She laughed and paused, then took his hand, and with a rapt look on
her face she whispered tenderly:</p>

<p>"But what do they matter?...They're all gone now...The whole world's
gone...There's no one left but you and I...Do you know," she said
quietly, "that I think about you all the time? When I wake up in the
morning the first thought that comes into my head is you. And from that
moment on I carry you round inside me all day long--here." She laid her
hand upon her breast, then went on in a rapt whisper: "You fill my
life, my heart, my spirit, my whole being. Oh, do you think there ever
was another love like ours since the world began--two other people who
ever loved each other as we do? If I could play, I'd make of it great
music. If I could sing, I'd make of it a great song. If I could write,
I'd make of it a great story. But when I try to play or write or sing,
I can think of nothing else but you...Did you know that I once tried to
write a story!" Smiling, she inclined her rosy face towards his:
"Didn't I ever tell you?" He shook his head.</p>

<p>"I was sure that it would make a wonderful story," she went on
eagerly. "It seemed to fill me up. I was ready to burst with it. But
when I tried to write it, all that I could say was: 'Long, long into
the night I lay--thinking of you.'"</p>

<p>She laughed suddenly, richly.</p>

<p>"And that's as far as I could get. But wasn't it a grand beginning
for a story? And now at night when I try to go to sleep, that one line
of the story that I couldn't write comes back to me and haunts me, and
keeps ringing in my ears. 'Long, long into the night I lay--thinking of
you.' For that's the story."</p>

<p>She moved closer to him, and lifted her lips to his.</p>

<p>"Ah, dearest, that's the story. In the whole world there's nothing
more. Love is enough."</p>

<p>He could not answer. For as she spoke he knew that for him it was
not the story. He felt desolate and tired. The memory of all their
years of love, of beauty and devotion, of pain and conflict, together
with all her faith and tenderness and noble loyalty--the whole universe
of love which had been his, all that the tenement of flesh and one
small room could hold--returned to rend him in this instant.</p>

<p>For he had learned to-night that love was not enough. There had to
be a higher devotion than all the devotions of this fond imprisonment.
There had to be a larger world than this glittering fragment of a world
with all its wealth and privilege. Throughout his whole youth and early
manhood, this very world of beauty, ease, and luxury, of power, glory,
and security, had seemed the ultimate end of human ambition, the
furthermost limit to which the aspirations of any man could reach. But
to-night, in a hundred separate moments of intense reality, it had
revealed to him its very core. He had seen it naked, with its guards
down. He had sensed how the hollow pyramid of a false social structure
had been erected and sustained upon a base of common mankind's blood
and sweat and agony. So now he knew that if he was ever to succeed in
writing the books he felt were in him, he must turn about and lift his
face up to some nobler height.</p>

<p>He thought about the work he wanted to do. Somehow the events which
he had witnessed here to-night had helped to resolve much of his inner
chaos and confusion. Many of the things which had been complex before
were now made simple. And it all boiled down to this: honesty,
sincerity, no compromise with truth--those were the essentials of any
art--and a writer, no matter what else he had, was just a hack without
them.</p>

<p>And that was where Esther and this world of hers came in. In
America, of all places, there could be no honest compromise with
special privilege. Privilege and truth could not lie down together. He
thought of how a silver dollar, if held close enough to the eye, could
blot out the sun itself. There were stronger, deeper tides and currents
running in America than any which these glamorous lives to-night had
ever plumbed or even dreamed of. Those were the depths that he would
like to sound.</p>

<p>As he thought these things, a phrase that had been running through
his head all evening, like an overtone to everything that he had seen
and heard, now flashed once more into his consciousness:</p>

<p>--He who lets himself be whored by fashion will be whored by
time.</p>

<p>Well, then--a swift thrust of love and pity pierced him as Esther
finished speaking and he looked down at her enraptured, upturned
face--it must be so: he to his world, she to hers.</p>

<p>But to-night. He could not tell her so to-night. To-morrow----</p>

<p>Yes, to-morrow he would tell her. It would be better so. He would
tell it to her straight, the way he understood it now--tell it so she
could not fail to understand it, too. But tell it--get it over
with--to-morrow.</p>

<p>And to make it easier, for her as well as for himself, there was one
thing he would not tell her. It would be surer, swifter, kinder, not to
tell her that he loved her still, that he would always love her, that
no one else could ever take her place. Not by so much as a glance, a
single word, the merest pressure of the hand, must he let her know that
this was the hardest thing he would ever have to do. It would be far
better if she did not know that, for if she knew, she'd never
understand----</p>

<p>--Never understand to-morrow----</p>

<p>--That a tide was running in the hearts of men----</p>

<p>--And he must go.</p>

<p>They said little more that night. In a few minutes he got up, and
with a sick and tired heart he went away.</p>

<h2><a name="book3"></a>BOOK III. - AN END AND A BEGINNING</h2>

<p><i>When a cicada comes out of the ground to enter the last stage of
its life cycle, it looks more like a fat, earth-stained grub-worm than
a winged thing. Laboriously it climbs up the trunk of a tree, pulling
itself along on legs that hardly seem to belong to it, for they move
with painful awkwardness as though the creature had not yet got the
hang of how to use them. At last it stops in its weary climb and clings
to the bark by its front feet. Then, suddenly, there is a little
popping sound, and one notices that the creature's outer garment has
split down the back, as neatly as though it had come equipped with a
zipper. Slowly now the thing inside begins to emerge, drawing itself
out through the opening until it has freed its body, head, and all its
members. Slowly, slowly, it accomplishes this amazing task, and slowly
creeps out into a patch of sun, leaving behind the brown and lifeless
husk from which it came.</i></p>

<p><i>The living, elemental protoplasm, translucent, pale green now,
remains motionless for a long time in the sun, but if one has the
patience to watch it further, one will see the miracle of change and
growth enacted before his very eyes. After a while the body begins to
pulse with life, it flattens out and changes colour like a chameleon,
and from small sprouts on each side of the back the wings commence to
grow. Quickly, quickly now, they lengthen out--one can see it
happening!--until they become transparent fairy wings, iridescent,
shimmering in the sun. They begin to quiver delicately, then more
rapidly, and all at once, with a metallic whirring sound, they cut the
air and the creature flashes off, a new-born thing released into a new
element.</i></p>

<p><i>America, in the autumn of 1929, was like a cicada. It had come to
an end and a beginning. On October 24th, in New York, in a
marble-fronted building down in Wall Street, there was a sudden crash
that was heard throughout the land. The dead and outworn husk of the
America that had been had cracked and split right down the back, and
the living, changing, suffering thing within--the real America, the
America that had always been, the America that was yet to be--began now
slowly to emerge. It came forth into the light of day, stunned,
cramped, crippled by the bonds of its imprisonment, and for a long time
it remained in a state of suspended animation, full of latent vitality,
waiting, waiting patiently, for the next stage of its
metamorphosis.</i></p>

<p><i>The leaders of the nation had fixed their gaze so long upon the
illusions of a false prosperity that they had forgotten what America
looked like. Now they saw it--saw its newness, its raw crudeness, and
its strength--and turned their shuddering eyes away. "Give us back our
well-worn husk," they said, "where we were so snug and comfortable."
And then they tried word-magic. "Conditions are fundamentally sound,"
they said--by which they meant to reassure themselves that nothing now
was really changed, that things were as they always had been, and as
they always would be, for ever and ever, amen.</i></p>

<p><i>But they were wrong. They did not know that you can't go home
again. America bad come to the end of something, and to the beginning
of something else. But no one knew what that something else would be,
and out of the change and the uncertainty and the wrongness of the
leaders grew fear and desperation, and before long hunger stalked the
streets. Through it all there was only one certainty, though no one saw
it yet. America was still America, and whatever new thing came of it
would be American.</i></p>

<p><i>George Webber was just as confused and fearful as everybody else.
If anything, he was more so, because, in addition to the general
crisis, he was caught in a personal one as well. For at this very time
he, too, had come to an end and a beginning. It was an end of love,
though not of loving; a beginning of recognition, though not of fame.
His book was published early in November, and that event, so eagerly
awaited for so long, produced results quite different from any he had
expected. And during this period of his life he learned a great deal
that he had never known before, but it was only gradually, in the
course of the years to come, that he began to realise how the changes
in himself were related to the larger changes in the world around
him.</i></p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="chapter3-22"></a>22. A Question of Guilt</h2>

<p>Throughout George Webber's boyhood in the little town of Libya Hill,
when the great vision of the city burned for ever in his brain, he had
been athirst for glory and had wanted very much to be a famous man.
That desire had never changed, except to become stronger as he grew
older, until now he wanted it more than ever. Yet, of the world of
letters in which he dreamed of cutting a great figure, he knew almost
nothing. He was now about to find out a few things that were to rob his
ignorance of its bliss.</p>

<p>His novel, <i>Home to Our Mountains</i>, was published the first
week in November 1929. The date, through the kind of accidental
happening which so often affects the course of human events, and which,
when looked back on later, seems to have been attended by an element of
fatality, coincided almost exactly with the beginning of the Great
American Depression.</p>

<p>The collapse of the Stock Market, which had begun in late October,
was in some ways like the fall of a gigantic boulder into the still
waters of a lake. The suddenness of it sent waves of desperate fear
moving in ever-widening circles throughout America. Millions of people
in the far-off hamlets, towns, and cities did not know what to make of
it. Would its effects touch them? They hoped not. And the waters of the
lake closed over the fallen boulder, and for a while most Americans
went about their day's work just as usual.</p>

<p>But the waves of fear had touched them, and life was not quite the
same. Security was gone, and there was a sense of dread and ominous
foreboding in the air. It was into this atmosphere of false calm and
desperate anxiety that Webber's book was launched.</p>

<p>It is no part of the purpose of this narrative to attempt to
estimate the merits or deficiences of <i>Home to Our Mountains</i>. It
need only be said here that it was a young man's first book, and that
it had a good many of the faults and virtues of the kind of thing it
was. Webber had done what so many beginning writers do: he had written
it out of the experience of his own life. And that got him into a lot
of trouble.</p>

<p>He was to become convinced as he grew older that if one wants to
write a book that has any interest or any value whatever, he has got to
write it out of the experience of life. A writer, like everybody else
must use what he has to use. He can't use something that he hasn't got.
If he tries to--and many writers have tried it--what he writes is no
good. Everybody knows that.</p>

<p>So Webber had drawn upon the experience of his own life. He had
written about his home town, about his family and the people he had
known there. And he, had done it in a manner of naked directness and
reality that was rather rare in books. That was really what caused the
trouble.</p>

<p>Every author's first book is important. It means the world to him.
Perhaps he thinks that what he has done has never been done before.
Webber thought so. And in a way he was right. He was still very much
under the influence of James Joyce, and what he had written was a
<i>Ulysses</i> kind of book. People at home, whose good opinion he
coveted more than that of all the rest of the world combined, were
bewildered and overwhelmed by it. They, of course, had not read
<i>Ulysses</i>. And Webber had not read people. He thought he had, he
thought he knew what they were like, but he really didn't. He hadn't
learned what a difference there is between living with them and writing
about them.</p>

<p>A man learns a great deal about life from writing and publishing a
book. When Webber wrote his, he had ripped off a mask that his home
town had always worn, but he had not quite understood that he was doing
it. Only after it was printed and published did he fully realise the
fact. All he had meant and hoped to do was to tell the truth about life
as he had known it. But no sooner was the thing done--the proofs
corrected, the pages printed beyond recall--than he knew that he had
not told the truth. Telling the truth is a pretty hard thing. And in a
young man's first attempt, with the distortions of his vanity, egotism,
hot passion, and lacerated pride, it is almost impossible. <i>Home to
Our Mountains</i> was marred by all these faults and imperfections.
Webber knew this better than anybody else, and long before any reader
had a chance to tell him so. He did not know whether he had written a
great book--sometimes he thought he had, or at least that there were
elements of greatness in it. He did know that it was not altogether a
true book. Still, there was truth in it. And this was what people were
afraid of. This was what made them mad.</p>

<p>As the publication day drew near, Webber felt some apprehension
about the reception of his novel in Libya Hill. Ever since his trip
home in September he had had a heightened sense of uneasiness and
anxiety. He had seen the boom-mad town tottering on the brink of ruin.
He had read in the eyes of people on the streets the fear and guilty
knowledge of the calamity that impended and that they were still
refusing to admit even to themselves. He knew that they were clinging
desperately to the illusion of their paper riches, and that madness
such as this was unprepared to face reality and truth in any degree
whatever.</p>

<p>But even if he had been unaware of these special circumstances of
the moment, he would still have had some premonitory consciousness that
he was in for something. For he was a Southerner, and he knew that
there was something wounded in the South. He knew that there was
something twisted, dark, and full of pain which Southerners have known
with all their lives--something rooted in their souls beyond all
contradiction, about which no one had dared to write, of which no one
had ever spoken.</p>

<p>Perhaps it came from their old war, and from the ruin of their great
defeat and its degraded aftermath. Perhaps it came from causes yet more
ancient--from the evil of man's slavery, and the hurt and shame of
human conscience in its struggle with the fierce desire to own. It
came, too, perhaps, from the lusts of the hot South, tormented and
repressed below the harsh and outward patterns of a bigot and
intolerant theology, yet prowling always, stirring stealthily, as
hushed and secret as the thickets of swamp-darkness. And most of all,
perhaps, it came out of the very weather of their lives, out of the
forms that shaped them and the food that fed them, out of the unknown
terrors of the skies above them, out of the dark, mysterious pineland
all round them with its haunting sorrow.</p>

<p>Wherever it came from, it was there--and Webber knew it.</p>

<p>But it was not only in the South that America was hurt. There was
another deeper, darker, and more nameless wound throughout the land.
What was it? Was it in the record of corrupt officials and polluted
governments, administrations twisted to the core, the huge excess of
privilege and graft, protected criminals and gangster rule, the
democratic forms all rotten and putrescent with disease? Was it in
"puritanism"--that great, vague name: whatever it may be? Was it in the
bloated surfeits of monopoly, and the crimes of wealth against the
worker's life? Yes, it was in all of these, and in the daily tolling of
the murdered men, the lurid renderings of promiscuous and casual
slaughter everywhere throughout the land, and in the pious hypocrisy of
the Press with its swift-forgotten prayers for our improvement, the
editorial moaning while the front page gloats.</p>

<p>But it is not only at these outward forms that we must look to find
the evidence of a nation's hurt. We must look as well at the heart of
guilt that beats in each of us, for there the cause lies. We must look,
and with our own eyes see, the central core of defeat and shame and
failure which we have wrought in the lives of even the least of these,
our brothers. And why must we look? Because we must probe to the bottom
of our collective wound. As men, as Americans, we can no longer cringe
away and lie. Are we not all warmed by the same sun, frozen by the same
cold, shone on by the same lights of time and terror here in America?
Yes, and if we do not look and see it, we shall be all damned
together.</p>

<p>So George Webber had written a book in which he had tried, with only
partial success, to tell the truth about the little segment of life
that he had seen and known. And now he was worried about what the
people back in his home town would think of it. He thought a few of
them would "read it". He was afraid there would be "talk". He supposed
that there might even be a protest here and there, and he tried to
prepare himself for it. But when it came, it went so far beyond
anything he had feared might happen that it caught him wholly unawares
and almost floored him. He had felt, but had not <i>known</i> before,
how naked we are here in America.</p>

<p>It was a time when the better-known gentlemen and lady authors of
the South were writing polished bits of whimsey about some dear Land of
Far Cockaigne, or ironic little comedies about the gentle relics of the
Old Tradition in the South, or fanciful bits about Negro mongrels along
the Battery in Charleston, or, if passion was in the air, amusing and
light-hearted tales about the romantic adulteries of dusky brethren and
their "high-yaller gals" on a plantation somewhere. There wasn't much
honesty or essential reality in these books, and the people who wrote
them had not made much effort to face the facts in the life round them.
One wrote about Cockaigne because it was far enough away to be safe;
and if one wanted to write about adultery, or about crime and
punishment of any sort, it was a good deal safer to let it happen to a
group of darkies than to the kind of people one had to live with every
day.</p>

<p><i>Home to Our Mountains</i> was a novel that did not fit into any
of these standardised patterns. It didn't seem to have much pattern at
all. The people of Libya Hill hardly knew what to make of it at first.
Then they recognised themselves in it. From that point on, they began
to live it all over again. People who had never bought a book before
bought this one. Libya Hill alone bought two thousand copies of it. It
stunned them, it overwhelmed them, and in the end it made them
fight.</p>

<p>For George Webber had used the scalpel in a way that that section of
the country was not accustomed to. His book took the hide off of the
whole community, and as a result of this it also took the hide off of
George Webber.</p>

<p>In Libya Hill, a day or two before the publication of the book,
Margaret Shepperton met Harley McNabb on the street. They exchanged
greetings and stopped to talk.</p>

<p>"Have you seen the book?" he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, George sent me an advance copy," she answered, beaming at him,
"and he signed it for me, too. But I haven't read it. It just came this
morning. Have you seen it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "We have a review copy in the office."</p>

<p>"What do you think of it?" She looked at him with the expression of
a large and earnest woman who lets herself be governed considerably by
the opinion of those round her mean--"now you've been to college,
Harley," she began jestingly, but also rather eagerly. "It may be deep
stuff to me--but you ought to know--you're educated--you ought to be a
judge about these things. What I mean is, do you think it's good?"</p>

<p>He was silent for a moment, his lean hand fingering the bowl of his
blackened briar, on which he puffed thoughtfully. Then:</p>

<p>"Margaret," he said, "it's pretty rough...Now don't get excited," he
added quickly as he saw her large face contract with anxiety and
concern. "No use getting excited about it--but"--he paused, puffing on
his pipe, his eyes staring off into vacancy--"there--there are some
pretty rough things in it. It's--it's pretty frank, Margaret."</p>

<p>She felt the gathering in her of sharp tensions, a white terror,
personal, immediate, as she said almost hoarsely:</p>

<p>"About me? About <i>me</i>, Harley? Is that what you mean? Are there
things in it--about <i>me?</i>" Her face was tortured now, and she felt
an indescribable sense of fear and guilt.</p>

<p>"Not only about you," he said. "About--well, Margaret, about
everybody--about a lot of people here in town...You've known him all
your life, haven't you? You see--well--he's put in everybody he ever
knew. Some of it is going to be pretty hard to take."</p>

<p>For a moment, in a phrase she was fond of using, she "went all to
pieces". She began to talk wildly, incoherently, her large features
contorted under the strain:</p>

<p>"Well, now, I'm sure I don't know what he's got to say about
me!...Well, now, if anyone feels <i>that</i> way--" without knowing how
anyone felt. "What I mean to say is, I certainly don't feel that I've
got anything to be ashamed of...You know me, Harley," she went on
eagerly, almost beseechingly, "I'm <i>known</i> in this town--I've got
friends here--everybody knows me...Well, I certainly have nothing to
conceal."</p>

<p>"I know you haven't, Margaret," he said. "Only--well, there's going
to be talk."</p>

<p>She felt emptied out, hollow, her knees were weak. His words had
almost knocked her over. If he said it, it must be so, even though she
did not yet understand what it was he had said. She only knew that she
was in the book, and that Harley didn't like it; and his opinion stood
for something, for a great deal, in her own eyes and in the eyes of the
whole town. He represented what her mind called, somewhat vaguely, "the
high-brow element". He had always been "a fine man". He stood for
truth, for culture, for learning, and for high integrity. So she looked
at him with her bewildered face and stricken eyes, and, just as a young
soldier, with his entrails shot out in his hands, speaks to the
commander of his life, saying in his deadly fear and peril: "Is it bad,
General? Do you think it's bad?"--so now she said hoarsely to the
editor, hanging on his words:</p>

<p>"Harley, do you think it's bad?"</p>

<p>He looked away again into blue vacancy and puffed gravely on his
pipe before he answered:</p>

<p>"It's pretty bad, Margaret...But don't worry. We'll see what
happens."</p>

<p>Then he was gone, leaving her alone there, bleakly staring at the
pavement of the small, familiar street. Unseen motes of the familiar
life swept round her, the pale light of the sun fell on her, and she
remained there staring with gaunt face. How much time went by she did
not know, but all at once----</p>

<p>"0 Margaret!"</p>

<p>At the lush voice, sugared with the honey of its owner's sweetness,
she turned, blindly smiling, and stiffly blurted out a word of
greeting.</p>

<p>"Aren't you just so proud of him? He always liked you better than
<i>anybody</i> else! Aren't you simply thrilled to <i>death?</i>" The
voice rose to a honeyed lilt, and in the pale light the face was now
shaped into the doelike contours of a china doll. "I'll declayah! I'm
so <i>thrilled!</i> I know you must be walkin' on ayah! Why, I just
cain't <i>wait!</i> I'm just <i>dyin'</i> to <i>read</i> it! I know
that <i>you're</i> the proudest thing that <i>evah</i> lived!"</p>

<p>Margaret stammered out something through stiff, smiling lips, and
then was left alone again, her big gaunt face strained into vacancy.
She went about the business that had brought her to town. She went
through the motions automatically. And all the while she was
thinking:</p>

<p>"So, he's written about us! That's what it is!" Her mind rushed
furiously on through a chaos of unresolved emotions. "Well, I'm sure I
don't know what it's all about, but there's one thing
certain--<i>my</i> conscience is clear. If anyone thinks they've got
anything on <i>me</i>, they're very much mistaken...Now, if he wants to
criticise <i>me</i>"--in her mind the word implied a derogatory
appraisal of a person's life and conduct--"why he can go right ahead.
I've lived all my life in this town, and everybody knows--no matter
what anybody says--that I've never done anything immoral." By this word
she meant solely and simply a deviation from the standards of sexual
chastity. "Now I'm sure I don't know what Harley meant by its being
hard to take and people will talk, but I know <i>I've</i> got nothing
to be ashamed about..."</p>

<p>Her mind was full of frantic questions. A hundred apprehensions,
fears, and terrors swept through her. But through it all there were
shafts of stubborn strength and loyalty:</p>

<p>"Whatever it's about, I know there can't be any harm in it. We've
all done things we're sorry for, but we're not bad people, any of us.
No one I know is really very bad. He couldn't harm us if he wanted to.
And," she added, "he wouldn't want to."</p>

<p>To her brother, Randy, when he came home that night, she said:</p>

<p>"Well, we're in for it!...I saw Harley McNabb on the street and he
said the book is pretty bad...Now, I don't know what he said about
<i>you</i>--Ho! Ho! Ho!--but my conscience is clear!"</p>

<p>Randy followed her back to the kitchen and they talked about it long
and earnestly while Margaret cooked supper. They were both puzzled and
bewildered by what McNabb had said. Neither of them had yet read the
book, so they searched their memories for all sorts of things that
might be in it, but they couldn't imagine what it was. Supper was late
that night, and when Margaret brought it to the table it was
burned.</p>

<p>Three weeks later, in New York, George sat in the back room of his
dismal flat on Twelfth Street, reading his morning mail. He had always
wanted letters. Now he had them. It seemed to him that all the letters
he had been waiting for all his life, all the letters he had longed
for, all the letters that had never come, had now descended in a
flood.</p>

<p>He remembered all the years, all the weary and unnumbered days and
hours of waiting, after he had first left home for college. He
remembered that first year away from home, his freshman year, and how
it seemed to him that he was always waiting for a letter that never
came. He remembered how the students gathered for their mail twice a
day, at noon and then again at night when they had finished dinner. He
remembered the dingy little post office on the main street of the
little college town, and the swarm of students shuffling in and
out--the whole street dense with them, the dingy little post office
packed with them, opening their boxes, taking out their mail, milling
round the delivery window.</p>

<p>Everyone, it seemed, got letters except himself.</p>

<p>Here were boys packed in the corners, leaning against the walls,
propped up against trees, squatted on steps and porch rails and the
verandas of fraternity houses, walking oblivious across the village
street--all immersed, all reading, all buried in their letters. Here
was the boy who had only one girl and wanted no one but the girl he
had, who had wormed himself away into a corner, just out of contact
with that noisy and good-natured crowd, where he read slowly,
carefully, word for word, the letter that she wrote him every day. Here
was another lad, a sleek and handsome youth, one of the Casanovas of
the campus, walking along and skimming the contents of a dozen scented
epistles, shuffling through the pages and responding with a touch of
complaisant satisfaction to the gibes of his fellows over his latest
conquest. Here were boys reading letters from their friends, from boys
in other colleges, from older brothers and from younger sisters, from
fathers, mothers, and from favourite aunts and uncles. From all these
people these boys received the tokens of friendship, kinship,
fellowship, and love--the emotions that give a man his place, that
secure him in the confident, brave knowledge of his home, that wall his
soul about with comfort, and that keep him from the desolation of an
utter nakedness, from the dreadful sense of his atomic nullity in the
roofless openness of life.</p>

<p>It seemed to him that everyone had this, except himself.</p>

<p>And, later, he remembered his first years in the city, his years of
wandering, his first years of living utterly alone. Here, too, even
more than in his college days, it seemed to him that he was always
waiting for a letter that never came. That was the time when he had
eaten out his heart at night in the cell-like privacy of little rooms.
That was the time when he had beaten his knuckles raw and bloody at the
walls that hemmed him in. That was the time--and it was ten thousand
times of longing, disappointment, bitter grief, and loneliness--when
his unresting mind had written to himself the letters that never came.
Letters from the noble, loyal, and gracious people he had never known.
Letters from the heroic and great-hearted friends that he had never
had. Letters from the faithful kinsmen, neighbours, schoolmates who had
all forgotten him.</p>

<p>Well, he had them now--all of them--and he had not foreseen it.</p>

<p>He sat there in his room and read them, numb in the city's roar. Two
shafts of light sank through the windows to the floor. Outside, the cat
crept trembling at his merciless stride along the ridges of the
back-yard fence.</p>

<p>Anonymous, in pencil, on a sheet of ruled tablet paper:</p>

<p>"Well author old lady Flood went away to Florida yestiddy after a
so-called <i>litterary</i> book arrived from a so-called author that
she thought she knew. Oh God how can you have this crime upon your

as a sheet where she will never rise again where you have put her with

<p>On a postcard, sealed in an envelope:</p>

<p>"We'll kill you if you ever come back here. You know who."</p>

<p>From an old friend:</p>

<p>"My dear boy,</p>

<p>"What is there to say? It has come, it is here, it has happened--and
now I can only say, as that good woman who brought you up and now lies
dead and buried on the hill would have said: '0 God! If I had only
known!' For weeks I have waited for nothing else except the moment when
your book should come and I should have it in my hands. Well, it has
come now. And what is there to say?</p>

<p>"You have crucified your family in a way that would make the agony
of Christ upon the Cross seem light in the comparison. You have laid
waste the lives of your kinsmen, and of dozens of your friends, and to
us who loved you like our own you have driven a dagger to the heart,
and twisted it, and left it fixed there where it must always stay."</p>

<p>From a sly and hearty fellow who thought he understood:</p>

<p>"...if I had known you were going to write this kind of book, I
could have told you lots of things. Why didn't you come to me? I know
dirt about the people in this town you never dreamed of."</p>

<p>Letters like this last one hurt him worst of all. They were the ones
that made him most doubt his purpose and accomplishment. What did such
people think he had been trying to write--nothing but an encyclopaedia
of pornography, a kind of prurient excavation of every buried skeleton
in town? He saw that his book had unreefed whole shoals of unsuspected
bitterness and malice in the town and set evil tongues to wagging. The
people he had drawn upon to make the characters in his book writhed
like hooked fish on a line, and the others licked their lips to see
them squirm.</p>

<p>Those who were the victims of all this unleashed malice now struck
back, almost to a man, at the hapless author--at him whom they
considered to be the sole cause of their woe. Day after day their
letters came, and with a perverse satisfaction in his own suffering, a
desire to take upon himself now all the searing shame that he had so
naively and so unwittingly brought to others, he read and re-read every
bitter word of every bitter letter, and his senses and his heart were
numb.</p>

<p>They said at first that he was a monster against life, that he had
fouled his own nest. Then they said he had turned against the South,
his mother, and spat upon her and defiled her. Then they levelled
against him the most withering charge they could think of, and said he
was "not Southern". Some of them even began to say that he was "not
American". This was really rather hard on him, George thought with a
wry, grim humour, for if he was not American, he was not anything at
all.</p>

<p>And during those nightmarish first weeks following the publication
of his book, only two rays of warmth and comforting assurance came to
him from anyone he knew.</p>

<p>One was a letter from Randy Shepperton. As a boy, and later as a
student at college, Randy had possessed a spirit that always burned
with the quick, pure flame of a Mercutio. And now, in spite of what
life had done to him--the evidence of which George had seen in his
troubled eyes and deeply furrowed face--his letter showed that he was
still essentially the same old Randy. What he wrote was full of
understanding about the book; he saw its purpose clearly, and he gave,
George thought, a shrewd appraisal of its accomplishment and its
weaknesses; and he ended with a generous burst of pride and honest
pleasure in the thing itself. Not a word about personalities, not a
breath of all the gossip in the town, not even a hint that he had
recognised himself among the portraits George had drawn.</p>

<p>The other ray of comfort was of quite another kind. One day the
telephone rang, and it was Nebraska Crane howling his friendship over
the wire:</p>

<p>"Hi, there, Monkus! That you? How you makin' out, boy?"</p>

<p>"Oh, all right, I guess," George answered, in a tone of resignation
which he could not conceal even in the pleasure that he felt at hearing
the hearty ring of the familiar voice.</p>

<p>"You sound sorta down in the mouth," said Nebraska, full of
immediate concern. "What's the matter? Ain't nothin' wrong with you, is
there?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no. No. It's nothing. Forget it." Then, shaking off the mood
that had been with him for days, he began to respond with something of
the warmth he felt for his old friend. "God, I'm glad to hear from you,
Bras! I can't tell you how glad I am! How are you, Bras?"</p>

<p>"Oh, cain't complain," he shouted lustily. "I think maybe they're
gonna give me a contrack for one more year. Looks like it, anyways. If
they do, we'll be all set."</p>

<p>"That's swell, Bras! That's wonderful!...And how is Myrtle?"</p>

<p>"Fine! Fine!...Say"--he howled--"she's here now! She's the one put
me up to callin' you. I never woulda thought of it. You know
<i>me!</i>...We been readin' all about you--about that book you wrote.
Myrtle's been tellin' me about it. She's cut out all the pieces from
the papers...That sure went over big, didn't it?"</p>

<p>"It's doing pretty well, I suppose," said George without enthusiasm.
"It seems to be selling all right, if that's what you mean."</p>

<p>"Well, now, I knowed it!" said Nebraska. "Me an' Myrtle bought a
copy...I ain't read it yet," he added apologetically.</p>

<p>"You don't have to."</p>

<p>"I'm <i>goin'</i> to, I'm <i>goin'</i> to," he howled vigorously.
"Just as soon as I git time."</p>

<p>"You're a damned liar!" George said good-naturedly. "You know you
never will!"</p>

<p>"Why, I <i>will!</i>" Nebraska solemnly declared. "I'm just waitin'
till I git a chance to settle down...Boy, you shore do write 'em long,
don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it <i>is</i> pretty long."</p>

<p>"Longest darn book I ever seen!" Nebraska yelled enthusiastically.
"Makes me tard just to tote it roun'!"</p>

<p>"Well, it made me tired to write it."</p>

<p>"Dogged if I don't believe you! I don't see how you ever thought up
all them words...But I'm gonna read it!...Some of the boys on the Club
know about it already. Jeffertz was talkin' to me about it the other
day."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Jeffertz--Matt Jeffertz, the ketcher."</p>

<p>"Has <i>he</i> read it?"</p>

<p>"Naw, he ain't read it yet, but his wife has. She's a big
book-reader an' she knows all about you. They knowed I knowed you, an'
that's how come he tells me--"</p>

<p>"Tells you what?" George broke in with a feeling of sudden
panic.</p>

<p>"Why, that you got <i>me</i> in there!" he yelled. "Is that right!"
George reddened and began to stammer:</p>

<p>"Well, Bras, you see----"</p>

<p>"Well, that's what Matt's wife said!" Nebraska shouted at the top of
his lungs, without waiting for an answer. "Said I'm in there so's
anyone would know me!...What'd you say about me, Monk? You sure it's
me?"</p>

<p>"Well--you see, now, Bras--it was like this----"</p>

<p>"What's eatin' on you, boy? It <i>is</i> me, ain't it?...Well, what
d'you know?" he yelled with evident amazement and delight. "Ole Bras
right there in the book!" His voice grew low and more excited as,
evidently turning to Myrtle, he said: "It's <i>me</i>, all right!"
Then, to George again: "Say, Monk"--solemnly--"you shore do make me
feel mighty proud! That's what I called you up to tell you."</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="chapter3-23"></a>23. The Lion Hunters</h2>

<p>In New York his book got a somewhat better reception than it
'enjoyed back home. The author was unknown. Nobody had any advance
reason to care about what he had written one way or another. Though
this was not exactly an asset, at least it gave the book a chance to be
considered on its merits.</p>

<p>Surprisingly enough, it got pretty good reviews in most of the
leading newspapers and magazines. That is, they were the kind of
reviews that his publisher called "good". They said nice things about
the book and made people want to buy it. George himself could have
wished that some of the reviewing gentry, even some of those who hailed
him as "a discovery" and studded their sentences with superlatives, had
been a little more discriminating in what they said of him.
Occasionally he could have asked for a little more insight into what he
had been driving at. But after reading the letters from his former
friends and neighbours he was in no mood to quarrel with anybody who
felt disposed to speak him a soft and gentle word, and on the whole he
had every reason to be well pleased with his press.</p>

<p>He read the notices avidly, feverishly, and sooner or later he must
have seen them all, for his publisher showed him the clippings as they
came in from every section of the country. He would take great bunches
of them home to devour. When his eager eye ran upon a word of praise it
was like magic to him, and he would stride about his room in a delirium
of joy. When he read a savage, harsh, unfavourable review, he felt
crushed: even though it came from some little rural paper in the South,
his fingers would tremble, his face turn pale, and he would wad it up
in his hand and curse it bitterly.</p>

<p>Whenever a notice of his work appeared in one of the best magazines
or weekly journals, he could hardly bring himself to read it; neither
could he go away from it and leave it unread. He would approach it as a
man creeps stealthily to pick a snake up by the tail, his heart leaping
at the sight of his name. He would scan the last line first, then with
a rush of blood to his face he would plunge into it at once, devouring
the whole of it as quickly as he could. And if he saw that it was going
to be "good", a feeling of such powerful joy and exultancy would well
up in his throat that he would want to shout his triumph from the
windows. If he saw that the verdict was going to be "thumbs down", he
would read on with agonised fascination, and his despair would be so
great that he would feel he was done for, that he had been exposed to
the world as a fool and a failure, and that he would never be able to
write another line.</p>

<p>After the more important reviews appeared, his mail gradually took
on a different complexion. Not that the flood of damning letters from
home had ceased, but now, along with them, began to come messages of
another kind, from utter strangers who had read his novel and liked it.
The book was doing pretty well, it seemed. 'It even appeared on some of
the best-seller lists, and then things really began to happen. Soon his
box was stuffed with fan mail, and the telephone jingled merrily all
day long with invitations from wealthy and cultivated people who wanted
him for lunch, for tea, for dinner, for theatre parties, for week-ends
in the country--for anything at all if he would only come.</p>

<p>Was this Fame at last? It looked so, and in the first flush of his
eager belief he almost forgot about Libya Hill and rushed headlong into
the welcoming arms of people he had never seen before. He accepted
invitations right and left, and they kept him pretty busy. And each
time he went out it seemed to him that he was on the very point of
capturing all the gold and magic he had ever dreamed of finding, and
that now he was really going to take a place of honour among the great
ones of the city, in a life more fortunate and good than any he had
ever known. He went to each encounter with each new friend as though
some wonderful and intoxicating happiness were impending for him.</p>

<p>But he never found it. For, in spite of all the years he had lived
in New York, he was still a country boy, and he did not know about the
lion hunters. They are a peculiar race of people who inhabit the upper
jungles of Cosmopolis and subsist entirely on some rarefied and
ambrosial ectoplasm that seems to emanate from the arts. They love art
dearly--in fact, they dote on it--and they love the artists even more.
So they spend their whole lives running after them, and their favourite
sport is trapping literary lions. The more intrepid hunters go after
nothing but the full-grown lions, who make the most splendid trophies
for exhibition purposes, but others--especially the lady hunters--would
rather bag a cub. A cub, once tamed and housebroken, makes a nice
pet--much nicer than a lap dog--because there's just no limit to the
beguiling tricks a gentle hand can teach him.</p>

<p>For a few weeks George was quite the fair-haired boy among these
wealthy and cultivated people.</p>

<p>One of his new-found friends told him about an aesthetic and
high-minded millionaire who was panting with eagerness to meet him.
From others came further confirmation of the fact.</p>

<p>"The man is mad about your work," people would say to him. "He's
crazy to meet you. And you ought to go to see him, because a man like
that might be of great help to you."</p>

<p>They told George that this man had asked all kinds of questions
about him, and had learned that he was very poor and had to work for a
small salary as an instructor in the School for Utility Cultures. When
the millionaire heard this, his great heart began to bleed for the
young author immediately. It was intolerable, he said, that such a
state of affairs should exist. America was the only country in the
world where it would be permitted. Anywhere in Europe--yes, even in
poor little Austria!--the artist would be subsidised, the ugly threat
of poverty that hung over him would be removed, his best energies would
be released to do his finest work--and, by God, he was going to see
that this was done for George!</p>

<p>George had never expected anything like this to happen, and he could
not see why such a thing should be done for any man. Nevertheless, when
he thought of this great-hearted millionaire, he burned with eagerness
to meet him and began to love him like a brother.</p>

<p>So a meeting was arranged, and George went to see him, and the man
was very fine to him. The millionaire had George to his house for
dinner several times and showed him off to all of his rich friends. And
one lovely woman to whom the millionaire introduced the poor young
author took him home with her that very night and granted him the
highest favour in her keeping.</p>

<p>Then the millionaire had to go abroad on brief but urgent business.
George went to the boat to see him off, and his friend shook him
affectionately by the shoulder, called him by his first name, and told
him that if there was anything he wanted, just to let him know by cable
and he would see that it was done. He said he would be back within a
month at most, and would be so busy that he wouldn't have time to
write, but he would get in touch with George again as soon as he
returned. With this he wrung George by the hand and sailed away.</p>

<p>A month, six weeks, two months went by, and George heard nothing
from the man. It was well into the new year before he saw him again,
and then by accident.</p>

<p>A young lady had invited George to have lunch with her at an
expensive speak-easy. As soon as they entered the place George saw his
millionaire friend sitting alone at one of the tables. Immediately
George uttered a cry of joy and started across the room to meet him
with his hand outstretched, and in such precipitate haste that he fell
sprawling across an intervening table and two chairs. When he picked
himself up from the floor, the man had drawn back with an expression of
surprise and perplexity on his face, but he unbent sufficiently to take
the young man's proffered hand and to say coolly, in an amused and
tolerant voice:</p>

<p>"Ah--it's our writer friend again? How are you?"</p>

<p>The young man's crestfallen confusion and embarrassment were so
evident that the rich man's heart was quite touched. His distant manner
thawed out instantly, and now nothing would do but that George should
bring the young lady over to the millionaire's table so that they could
all have lunch together.</p>

<p>During the course of the meal the man became very friendly and
attentive. It seemed he just couldn't do enough for George. He kept
helping him to various dishes and filling his glass with more wine. And
whenever George turned to him he would find the man looking at him with
an expression of such obvious sympathy and commiseration that finally
he felt compelled to ask him what the trouble was.</p>

<p>"Ah," he said, shaking his head with a doleful sigh, "I was mighty
sorry when I read about it."</p>

<p>"Read about what?"</p>

<p>"Why," he said, "the prize."</p>

<p>"What prize?"</p>

<p>"But didn't you read about it in the paper? Didn't you see what
happened?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what you are talking about," said George, puzzled.
"What did happen?"</p>

<p>"Why," he said, "you didn't get it."</p>

<p>"Didn't get what?"</p>

<p>"The prize!" he cried--"the prize!"--mentioning a literary prize
that was awarded every year. "I thought you would be sure to get it,
but"--he paused a moment, then went on sorrowfully--"they gave it to
another man...You got mentioned...you were runner-up...but"--he shook
his head gloomily--"you didn't get it."</p>

<p>So much for his gocd friend, the millionaire. George never saw him
again after that. And yet, let no one say that he was ever bitter.</p>

<p>Then there was Dorothy.</p>

<p>Dorothy belonged to that fabulous and romantic upper crust of New
York "Society" which sleeps by day and begins to come awake at sunset
and never seems to have any existence at all outside of the
better-known hot spots of the town. She had been expensively educated
for a life of fashion, she had won a reputation in her set for being
quite an intellectual because she had been known to read a book, and
so, of course, when George Webber's novel was listed as a best seller
she bought it and left it lying around in prominent places in her
apartment. Then she wrote the author a scented note, asking him to come
and have a cocktail with her. He did, and at her urging he went back to
see her again and again.</p>

<p>Dorothy was no longer as young as she had been, but she was well
built, had kept her figure and her face, and was not a bad-looking
wench. She had never married, and apparently felt she did not need to,
for it was freely whispered about that she seldom slept alone. One
heard that she had bestowed her favours not only upon all the gentlemen
of her own set, but also upon such casual gallants as the milkmen on
her family's estate, stray taxi-drivers, writers of da-da, professional
bicycle riders, wasteland poets, and plug-ugly bruisers with flat feet
and celluloid collars. So George had expected their friendship to come
quickly to its full flower, and he was quite surprised and disappointed
when nothing happened.</p>

<p>His evenings with Dorothy turned out to be quiet and serious
<i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;tes</i> devoted to highly intellectual
conversation. Dorothy remained as chaste as a nun, and George began to
wonder whether she had not been grossly maligned by evil tongues. He
found her intellectual and aesthetic interests rather on the dull side,
and was several times on the point of giving her up in sheer boredom.
But always she would pursue him, sending him notes and letters written
in a microscopic hand on paper edged with red, and he would go back
again, partly out of curiosity and a desire to find out what it was the
woman was after.</p>

<p>He found out. Dorothy asked him to dine with her one night at a
fashionable restaurant, and on this occasion she brought along her
current sleeping companion, a young Cuban with patent-leather hair.
George sat at the table between them. And while the Cuban gave his
undivided attention to the food before him, Dorothy began to talk to
George, and he learned to his chagrin that she had picked him out of
all the world to be the victim of her only sacred passion.</p>

<p>"I love you, Jawge," she leaned over and whispered loudly in her
rather whiskified voice. "I love you--but mah love for you is pewer!"
She looked at him with a soulful expression. "<i>You</i>, Jawge--I love
you for your <i>maind</i>," she rumbled on, "for your <i>spirit!</i>
But Miguel! Miguel!"--here her eyes roved over the Cuban as he sat
tucking the food away with both hands--"Miguel--I love him for his
<i>bawd-y</i>! He has no maind, but he has a fa-ine bawd-y," she
whispered lustfully, "a fa-ine beaut-iful bawd-y--so slim--so
boyish--so <i>La-tin</i>!"</p>

<p>She was silent for a moment, and when she went on it was in a tone
of foreboding:</p>

<p>"I wantcha to come with us to-naight, Jawge!" she said abruptly. "I
don't know what is going to happen," she said ominously, "and I wantcha
<i>nee-ah</i> me."</p>

<p>"But what is going to happen, Dorothy?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," she muttered. "I just don't know. Anything might
happen!...Why, last night I thought that he was <i>gone!</i> We had a
fight and he walked out on me! These La-tins are so <i>proud</i>, so
<i>sen-sitive!</i> He caught me looking at another man, and he got up
and left me flat!...If he left me I don't know what I'd do, Jawge," she
panted. "I think I'd <i>die!</i> I think I'd <i>kill</i> myself!"</p>

<p>Her eye rested broodingly upon her lover, who at this moment was
bending forward with bared teeth towards the tines of his uplifted fork
on which a large and toothsome morsel of broiled chicken was impaled.
Feeling their eyes upon him, he looked up with his fork poised in
mid-air, smiled with satisfaction, then seized the bit of chicken in
his jaws, took a drink to wash it down, and wiped his moist lips with a
napkin. After that he elegantly lifted one hand to shield his mouth,
inserted a finger-nail between his teeth, detached a fragment of his
victuals, and daintily ejected it upon the floor, while his lady's fond
eye doted on him. Then he picked up the fork again and resumed his
delightful gastronomic labours.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't worry about it, Dorothy," George said to her. "I don't
think he's going to leave you for some time."</p>

<p>"I should <i>die!</i>" she muttered. "I really think that it would
<i>kill</i> me!...Jawge, you've <i>got</i> to come with us to-naight! I
just wantcha to be <i>nee-ah</i> me! I feel so safe--so
<i>secure</i>--when you're around! You're so <i>sawlid</i>, Jawge--so
<i>comfawtin</i>'!" she said. "I wantcha to be theah to <i>tawk</i> to
me--to hold mah hand and <i>comfawt</i> me--if anything should happen,"
she said, at the same time putting her hand on his and squeezing
it.</p>

<p>But George did not go with her that night, nor any night thereafter.
This was the last he saw of Dorothy. But surely none can say that he
was ever bitter.</p>

<p>Again, there was the rich and beautiful young widow whose husband
had died just a short time before, and who mentioned this sad fact in
the moving and poignantly understanding letter she wrote to George
about his book. Naturally, he accepted her kind invitation to drop in
for tea. And almost at once the lovely creature offered to make the
supreme sacrifice, first beginning with an intimate conversation about
poetry, then looking distressed and saying it was very hot in here and
did he mind if she took off her dress, then taking it off, and
everything else as well, until she stood there as God made her, then
getting into bed and casting the mop of her flaming red hair about on
the pillow, rolling her eyes in frenzied grief, and crying out in
stricken tones: "0 Algernon! Algernon! Algernon!"--which was the name
of her departed husband.</p>

<p>"0 Algernon!" she cried, rolling about in grief and shaking her
great mop of flaming hair--"Algie, darling, I am doing it for you!
Algie, come back to me! Algie, I love you so! My pain is more than I
can bear! Algernon!--No, no, poor boy!" she cried, seizing George by
the arm as he started to crawl out of bed, because, to tell the truth,
he did not know whether she had gone mad or was playing some wicked
joke on him. "Don't go!" she whispered tenderly, clinging to his arm.
"You just don't understand! I want to be so good to you--but everything
I do or think or feel is Algernon, Algernon, Algernon!"</p>

<p>She explained that her <i>heart</i> was buried in her husband's
grave, that she was really "a dead woman" (she had already told him she
was a great reader of psychologies), and that the act of love was just
an act of devotion to dear old Algie, an effort to be with him again
and to be "a part of all this beauty."</p>

<p>It was very fine and high and rare, and surely no one will think
that George would sneer at a beautiful emotion, although it was too
fine for him to understand. Therefore he went away, and never saw this
lovely and sorrowful widow any more. He knew he was not fine enough.
And yet, not for a moment should you think that he was ever bitter.</p>

<p>Finally, there was another girl who came into George Webber's life
during this period of his brief glory, and her he understood. She was a
beautiful and brave young woman, country-bred, and she had a good job,
and a little apartment from which you could see the East River, the
bridges, and all the busy traffic of the tugs and barges. She was not
too rare and high for him, although she liked to take a part in serious
conversations, to know worth-while people with liberal minds, and to
keep up her interest in new schools and modern methods for the
children. George became quite fond of her, and would stay all night and
go away at daybreak when the streets were empty, and the great
buildings went soaring up haggardly, incredibly, as if he were the
first man to discover them, in the pale, pure, silent light of
dawn.</p>

<p>He loved her well; and one night, after a long silence, she put her
arms round him, drew him down beside her, and kissed him,
whispering:</p>

<p>"Will you do something for me if I ask you to?"</p>

<p>"Darling, anything!" he said. "Anything you ask me, if I can!" She
held him pressed against her for a moment in the dark and living
silence.</p>

<p>"I want you to use your influence to get me into the Cosmopolis
Club," she whispered passionately----</p>

<p>And then dawn came, and the stars fell.</p>

<p>This was the last he saw of the great world of art, of fashion, and
of letters.</p>

<p>And if it seems to anyone a shameful thing that I have written thus
of shameful things and shameful people, then I am sorry for it. My only
object is to set down here the truthful record of George Webber's life,
and he, I feel quite sure, would be the last person in the world to
wish me to suppress any chapter of it. So I do not think that I have
written shamefully.</p>

<p>The only shame George Webber felt was that at one time in his life,
for however short a period, he broke bread and sat at the same table
with any man when the living warmth of friendship was not there; or
that he ever traded upon the toil of his brain and the blood of his
heart to get the body of a scented whore that might have been better
got in a brothel for some greasy coins. This was the only shame he
felt. And this shame was so great in him that he wondered if all his
life thereafter would be long enough to wash out of his brain and blood
the last pollution of its loathsome taint.</p>

<p>And yet, he would not have it thought that he was bitter.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="chapter3-24"></a>24. Man-Creating and Man-Alive</h2>

<p>It must be abundantly clear by now that George Webber was never
bitter. What cause had he for bitterness? When he fled from the lion
hunters he could always go back to the loneliness of his dismal
two-room flat in Twelfth Street, and that is what he did. Also, he
still had the letters from his friends in Libya Hill. They had not
forgotten him. For four months and more after the publication of his
hook they continued to write him, and all of them took pains to let him
know exactly what place he held in their affections.</p>

<p>Throughout this time George heard regularly from Randy Shepperton.
Randy was the only one that George had left to talk to, so George, in
answering Randy, unburdened himself of everything he t bought and felt.
Everything, that is, except upon a single topic--the rancour of his
fellow-townsmen against the author who had exposed them naked to the
world. Neither of the friends had ever mentioned it. Randy had set the
pattern for evasion in his first letter, feeling that it was better to
ignore the ugly gossip altogether and to let it die down and be
forgotten. As for George, he had been too overwhelmed by it, too sunk
and engulfed in it, to be able to speak of it at first. So they had
chiefly confined themselves to the book itself, exchanging their
thoughts and afterthoughts about it, with comments on what the various
critics had said and left unsaid.</p>

<p>But by early March of the new year the flow of damning mail was past
its flood and was thinning to a trickle, and one day Randy received from
George the letter that he feared would have to come:</p>

<p>"I have spent most of my time this past week," George wrote "reading
and re-reading all the letters that my erstwhile friends and neighbours
have written me since the book came out. And now that the balloting is
almost over and most of the vote is in, the result is startling and a
little confusing. I have been variously compared to Judas Iscariot,
Benedict Arnold, and Caesar's Brutus. I have been likened to the bird
that fouls its own nest, to a viper that an innocent populace had long
nurtured in its bosom, to a carrion crow preying upon the blood and
bones of his relatives and friends, and to an unnatural ghoul to whom
nothing is sacred, not even the tombs of the honoured dead. I have been
called a vulture, a skunk, a hog, deliberately and lustfully wallowing
in the mire, a defiler of pure womanhood, a rattlesnake, a jackass, an
alley-cat, and a baboon. Although my imagination has been strained
trying to conceive of a creature who combined in himself all of these
interesting traits--it would be worth any novelist's time to meet such
a chap!--there have been moments when I have felt that maybe my
accusers are right..."</p>

<p>Behind this semblance of facetiousness, Randy could see that he was
sincerely disturbed, and, knowing the capacity of George's soul for
self-torture, he could pretty well imagine how deep and sore the extent
of his full suffering might be. He revealed it almost immediately:</p>

<p>"Great God! What is it I have done? Sometimes I am overwhelmed by a
sense of horrible and irrevocable guilt! Never before have I realised
as I have this past week how terrible and great may be the distance
between the Artist and the Man.</p>

<p>"As the artist, I can survey my work with a clear conscience. I have
the regrets and dissatisfactions that every writer ought to have: the
book should have been better, it failed to measure up to what I wanted
for it. But I am not ashamed of it. I feel that I wrote it as I did
because of an inner necessity, that I <i>had</i> to do it, and that by
doing it I was loyal to the only thing in me which is worth
anything.</p>

<p>"So speaks Man-Creating. Then, instantly, it all changes, and from
Man-Creating I become simply Man-Alive--a member of society, a friend
and neighbour, a son and brother of the human race. And when I look at
what I have done from this point of view, suddenly I feel lower than a
dog. I see all the pain and anguish I have caused to people that I
know, and I wonder how I could have done it, and how there could
possibly be any justification for it--yes, even if what I wrote had
been as great as <i>Lear</i>, as eloquent as <i>Hamlet</i>.</p>

<p>"Believe me--incredible as it may sound--when I tell you that during
these weeks I have even derived a kind of grotesque and horrible
pleasure from reading those letters which simply abused, cursed, or
threatened me. There is, I found, a bitter relief in having someone
curse me with every foul name he can think of or invent, or tell me he
will put a bullet through my brain if I ever set foot in the streets of
Libya Hill again. At any rate, I feel that the poor devil got some
satisfaction out of writing it.</p>

<p>"But the letters that drive the blade into my heart and twist it
round are those which neither curse nor threaten--the letters written
by stunned and stricken people who never did me any wrong, whose whole
feeling towards me was one of kindly good will and belief, who did not
know me <i>as I am</i>, and who write me now straight out of the
suffering heart of man, with their spirits quivering, stripped, whipped
by naked shame, to ask me over and over again in their bewilderment
that terrible and insistent question: 'Why did you do it? Why? Why?
Why?'</p>

<p>"And as I read their letters I no longer know why. I can't answer
them. As Man-Creating, I thought I knew, and thought, too, that the
answer was all-sufficient. I wrote about them with blunt directness,
trying to put in every relevant detail and circumstance, and I did it
because I thought it would be cowardly not to write that way, false to
withhold or modify. I thought that the Thing Itself was its own and
valid reason for being.</p>

<p>"But now that it is done, I am no longer sure of anything. I am
troubled by the most maddening doubts and impossible regrets. I have
moments when I feel that I would give my life if I could
<i>un-write</i> my book, <i>un-print</i> its pages. For what has it
accomplished, apparently, except to ruin my relatives, my friends, and
everyone in town whose life was ever linked with mine? And what is
there for me to salvage out of all this wreckage?</p>

<p>"'The integrity of the artist,' you may say.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes--if I could only soothe my conscience with that solacement!
For what integrity is there that is not tainted with human frailty? If
only I could tell myself that every word and phrase and incident in the
book had been created at the top of my bent and with the impartial
judgment of unrancorous detachment! But I know it is not true. So many
words come back to me, so many whip-lash phrases, that must have been
written in a spirit that had nothing to do with art or my integrity. We
are such stuff as dust is made of, and where we fail--we fail! Is
there, then, no such thing as a pure spirit in creation?</p>

<p>"In all the whole wretched experience there is also a grim and
horrible humour. It is insanely comical to find in almost all these
letters that I am being cursed for doing things I did not do and for
saying things I did not say. It is even more ludicrous to hear myself
grudgingly praised for having the one thing that I have not got. Few of
these letters--even those which threaten hanging, and those which deny
me the remotest scrap of talent (except a genius for obscenity)--fail
to commend me for what their writers call 'my memory'. Some of them
accuse me of sneaking round as a little boy of eight with my pockets
stuffed with notebooks, my ears fairly sprouting from my head and my
eyes popping out, in my effort to spy upon and snatch up every word and
act and phrase among my virtuous and unsuspecting fellow-townsmen.</p>

<p>"'It's the dirtiest book I ever read,' one citizen cogently remarks,
'but I'll have to give you credit for one thing--you've got a wonderful
memory.'</p>

<p>"And that is just exactly what I have <i>not</i> got. I have to see
a thing a <i>thousand times</i> before I see it once. This thing they
call my memory, this thing they think they can themselves remember, is
nothing that they ever saw. It is rather something that <i>I</i> saw
after looking at the thing a thousand times, and this is what they
<i>think</i> they can remember."</p>

<p>Randy paused in his reading of the letter, for he suddenly realised
that what George said was literally true. In the weeks since the book
was published, he himself had seen it proved over and over again.</p>

<p>He knew that there was scarcely a detail in George's book that was
precisely true to fact, that there was hardly a page in which
everything had not been transmuted and transformed by the combining
powers of George's imagination; yet readers got from it such an instant
sense of reality that many of them were willing to swear that the thing
described had been not only "drawn from life", but was the actual and
recorded fact. And that was precisely what had made the outcry and
denunciation so furious.</p>

<p>But not only that. It was funny enough to hear people talking and
arguing with each other out of a savage conviction that scenes and
incidents in the book were literally true because they may have had
some basis in remembered fact. It was even more grotesque to hear them
testify, as some of them now did, that they had been witnesses to
events which he knew to be utter fabrications of the author's
imagination.</p>

<p>"Why," they cried, when final proof of anything was wanted, "he's
got it all in! He's written it all down, just the way it happened!
Nothing's changed a bit! Look at the Square!"</p>

<p>They always came back to the Square, for the Square had occupied a
prominent place in <i>Home to Our Mountains</i>. George had pictured it
with such intensity of vision that almost every brick and windowpane
and cobblestone became imprinted on the reader's mind. But what was
this Square? Was it the town Square of Libya Hill? Everybody said it
was. Hadn't the local newspaper set it down in black and white that
"our native chronicler has described the Square with a photographic
eye"? Then people had read the book for themselves and had agreed.</p>

<p>So it was useless to argue with them--useless to point out to them
how Webber's Square differed from their own, unless to mention a
hundred items of variation. They had been pitiful in their anger when t
hey first discovered that art had imitated life; now they were
ludicrous in their ignorance that life was also imitating art.</p>

<p>With a smile and a shake of the head, Randy turned back to the
letter:</p>

<p>"In God's name, what <i>have</i> I done?" George concluded. "Have I
really acted according to some inner truth and real necessity, or did
my unhappy mother conceive and give birth to a perverse monster who has
defiled the dead and betrayed his family, kinsmen, neighbours, and the
human race? What should I have done? What ought I to do now? If there
is any help or answer in you, for Christ's sake let me have it. I feel
like a dead leaf in a hurricane. I don't know where to turn. You alone
can help me. Stay with me--write me--tell me what you think.</p>

<p>"Yours ever,</p>

<p>"GEORGE."</p>

<p>George's suffering had been so palpable in every sentence of his
letter that Randy had winced in reading it. He had felt the naked
anguish of his friend's raw wound almost as if it had been his own. But
he knew that neither he nor any other man could give the help answer
that George sought. He would have to find it somehow in himself. That
was the only way he had ever been able to learn anything.</p>

<p>So when Randy drafted his reply he deliberately made his letter as
casual as he could. He did not want to let it seem that he attached too
much importance to the town's reaction. He said that he did not know
what he would do if he were George, since he was not a writer, but that
he had always supposed a writer had to write about the life he knew. To
cheer George up, he added that the people of Libya Hill reminded him of
children who had not yet been told the facts of life. They still
believed, apparently, in the stork. Only people who knew nothing about
the world's literature could be surprised or shocked to learn where
every good book came from.</p>

<p>And then, in a kind of mild parenthesis, he said that Tim Wagner,
the town's most celebrated souse, noted for his wit in his rare
intervals of sobriety, had been a warm supporter of the book from the
beginning, but had made one reservation: "Why, hell! If George wants to
write about a horse-thief, that's all right. Only the next time I hope
he don't give his street address. And there ain't no use in throwing in
his telephone number, too."</p>

<p>Randy knew this would amuse George, and it did. In fact, George told
him later that it was the most sound and valuable critical advice that
he had ever had.</p>

<p>Randy ended his letter by assuring George that even if he was a
writer, he still considered him a member of the human race. And he
added, in what he hoped would be a comforting postscript, that there
were other angry mutterings abroad. He had heard a rumour, whispered by
one of the town's leading business men with a great air of hush-hush
and please-don't-breathe-a-word-of-this-to-anyone, that Mr. Jarvis
Riggs, the president of Libya Hill's largest bank and past hero of
infallibilities, was tottering on the brink of ruin.</p>

<p>"So you see," Randy concluded, "if that godly gentleman is capable
of imperfection, there may still be hope of pardon even in creatures as
vile as you."</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="chapter3-25"></a>25. The Catastrophe</h2>

<p>A day or two after receiving Randy's reply, George was reading the
<i>New York Times</i> one morning when his eye was caught by a small
news item on an inside page. It occupied only a scant two inches or so
at the bottom of a column, but the Libya Hill date line leaped out at
him:</p>

<blockquote>BANK FAILS IN SOUTH<br>
<br>


<p>LIBYA HILL, 0. C., Mar. 12--The Citizens Trust Company of this city
failed to open its doors for business this morning, and throughout the
day, as news of its closing spread, conditions of near-panic mounted
steadily here and in all the surrounding region. The bank was one of
the largest in western Old Catawba and for years had been generally
regarded as a model of conservative management and financial strength.
The cause of its failure is not yet known. It is feared that the losses
of the people of this community may be extensive.<br>
<br>
</p>

<p>The alarm occasioned by the closing of the bank was heightened later
in the day by the discovery of the sudden and rather mysterious death
of Mayor Baxter Kennedy. His body was found with a bullet through his
head, and all the available evidence seems to point to suicide. Mayor
Kennedy was a man of exceptionally genial and cheerful disposition, and
is said to have had no enemies.<br>
<br>
</p>

<p>Whether there is any connection between the two events which have so
profoundly disturbed the accustomed calm of this mountain district is
not known, although their close coincidence has given rise to much
excited conjecture.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"So," thought George, laying down the paper with a stunned and
thoughtful air, "it has come at last!...What was it that Judge Rumford
Bland had said to them?"</p>

<p>The whole scene in the Pullman wash-room came back to him. He saw
again the stark and speechless terror in the faces of Libya Hill's
leaders and rulers as the frail but terrible old blind man suddenly
confronted them and held them with his sightless eyes and openly
accused them of ruining the town. As George remembered this and sat
there thinking about the news he had just read, he felt quite sure
there must be some direct relation between the failure of the bank and
the Mayor's suicide.</p>

<hr align="center" width="15%">
<p>There was, indeed. Things had been building up to this double climax
for a long time.</p>

<p>Jarvis Riggs, the banker, had come from a poor but thoroughly
respectable family in the town. When he was fifteen his father died and
he had to quit school and go to work to support his mother. He held a
succession of small jobs until, at eighteen, he was offered a modest
but steady position in the Merchants National Bank.</p>

<p>He was a bright young fellow and a "hustler", and step by step he
worked his way up until he became a teller. Mark Joyner kept a deposit
at the Merchants National and used to come home and talk about Jarvis
Riggs. In those days he had none of the brittle manner and pompous
assurance that were to characterise him later, after he had risen to
greatness. His hair, which was afterwards to turn a dead and lifeless
sandy colour, had glints of gold in it then, his cheeks were full and
rosy, he had a bright and smiling face, and it was always briskly and
cheerfully--"Good morning, Mr. Joyner!" or "Good morning, Mr.
Shepperton!"--when a customer came in. He was friendly, helpful,
courteous, eager to please, and withal businesslike and knowing. He
also dressed neatly and was known to be supporting his mother. All
these things made people like him and respect him. They wanted to see
him succeed. For Jarvis Riggs was a living vindication of an American
legend--that of the poor boy who profits from the hardships of his
early life and "makes good". People would nod knowingly to one another
and say of him:</p>

<p>"That young man has his feet on the ground."</p>

<p>"Yes," they would say, "he's <i>going</i> somewhere."</p>

<p>So when, along about 1912, the word began to go round that a small
group of conservative business men were talking of starting a new bank,
and that Jarvis Riggs was going to be its cashier, the feeling was most
favourable. The backers explained that they were not going to compete
with the established banks. It was simply their feeling that a growing
town like Libya Hill, with its steady increase in population and in its
business interests, could use another bank. And the new bank, one
gathered, was to be conducted according to the most eminently approved
principles of sound finance. But it was to be a progressive bank, too,
forward-looking bank, mindful of the future, the great, golden,
magnificent future that Libya Hill was sure to have--that it was even
heresy to doubt. In this way it was also to be a young man's bank. And
this was where Jarvis Riggs came in.</p>

<p>It is not too much to say that the greatest asset the new enterprise
had from the beginning was Jarvis Riggs. He had played his cards well.
He had offended no one, he had made no enemies, he had always remained
modest, friendly, and yet impersonal, as if not wishing to intrude
himself too much on the attention of men who stood for substance and
authority in the town's life. The general opinion was that he knew what
he was doing. He had learned about life in the highly-thought-of
"university of hard knocks", he had learned business and banking in
"the hard school of experience", so everybody felt that if Jarvis Riggs
was going to be cashier of the new bank, then the new bank was pretty
sure to be all right.</p>

<p>Jarvis himself went around town and sold stock in the bank. He had
no difficulty at all. He made it quite plain that he did not think
anyone was going to make a fortune. He simply sold the stock as a safe
and sound investment, and that was how everybody felt about it. The
bank was modestly capitalised at $25,000, and there were 250 shares at
$100 each. The sponsors, including Jarvis, took 100 shares between
them, and the remaining 150 shares were divided among "a selected group
of leading business men". As Jarvis said, the bank was really "a
community project whose first and only purpose is to serve the
community", so no one was allowed to acquire too large an interest.</p>

<p>This was the way the Citizens Trust Company got started. And in no
time at all, it seemed, Jarvis Riggs was advanced from cashier to
vice-president, and then to president. The poor boy had come into his
own.</p>

<p>In its early years the bank prospered modestly and conservatively.
Its growth was steady but not spectacular. After the United States
entered the war, it got its share of the nation's prosperity. But after
the war, in 1921, there was a temporary lull, a period of "adjustment".
Then the 1920's began in earnest.</p>

<p>The only way to explain what happened then is to say that there was
"a feeling in the air". Everybody seemed to sense a prospect of quick
and easy money. There was thrilling and rapid expansion in all
directions, and it seemed that there were possibilities of wealth,
luxury, and economic power hitherto undreamed of just lying around
waiting for anyone who was bold enough to seize them.</p>

<p>Jarvis Riggs was no more insensible to these beckoning opportunities
than the next man. The time had come, he decided, to step out and show
the world what he could do. The Citizens Trust began to advertise
itself as "the fastest-growing bank in the state". But it did not
advertise what it was growing on.</p>

<p>That was the time when the political and business clique which
dominated the destinies of the town, and which had put amiable Baxter
Kennedy in the Mayor's office as its "front", began to focus its
activities round the bank. The town was burgeoning rapidly and pushing
out into the wilderness, people were confident of a golden future, no
one gave a second thought to the reckless increase in public borrowing.
Bond issues involving staggering sums were being constantly "floated"
until the credit structure of the town was built up into a teetering
inverted pyramid and the citizens of Libya Hill no longer owned the
streets they walked on. The proceeds of these enormous borrowings were
deposited with the bank. The bank, for its part, then returned these
deposits to the politicians, or to their business friends, supporters,
allies, and adherents--in the form of tremendous loans, made upon the
most flimsy and tenuous security, for purposes of private and personal
speculation. In this way "The Ring", as it was called, which had begun
as an inner circle of a few ambitious men, became in time a vast and
complex web that wove through the entire social structure of the town
and involved the lives of thousands of people. And all of it now
centred in the bank.</p>

<p>But the weaving of this complicated web of frenzied finance and
speculation and special favours to "The Ring" could not go on for ever,
though there were many who thought it could. There had to come a time
when the internal strains and stresses became too great to sustain the
load, a time when there would be ominous preliminary tremors to give
warning of the crash that was to come. Just when this time arrived is
pretty hard to say. One can observe a soldier moving forward in a
battle and see him spin and tumble, and know the moment he is hit. But
one cannot observe so exactly the moment when a man has been shot down
by life.</p>

<p>So it was with the bank and with Jarvis Riggs. All that one can be
sure of is that their moment came. And it came long before the mighty
roar of tumbling stocks in Wall Street echoed throughout the nation.
That event, which had its repercussions in Libya Hill as elsewhere, was
not the prime cause of anything. What happened in Wall Street was only
the initial explosion which in the course of the next few years was to
set off a train of lesser explosions all over the land--explosions
which at last revealed beyond all further doubting and denial the
hidden pockets of lethal gases which a false, vicious, and putrescent
scheme of things had released beneath the surface of American life.</p>

<p>Long before the explosion came that was to blow <i>him</i> sky-high,
and the whole town with him, Jarvis Riggs had felt the tremors in the
thing he had created, and he knew he was a doomed and ruined man.
Before long others knew it, too, and knew that they were ruined with
him. But they would not let themselves believe it. They did not dare.
Instead, they sought to exorcise the thing they feared by pretending it
wasn't there. Their speculations only grew madder, fiercer.</p>

<p>And then, somehow, the cheerful, easy-going Mayor found out what
some of those round him must have known for months. That was in the
spring of 1928, two years before the failure of the bank. At that time
he went to Jarvis Riggs and told him what he knew, and then demanded to
withdraw the city's funds. The banker looked the frightened Mayor in
the eye and laughed at him.</p>

<p>"What are you afraid of, Baxter?" he said. "Are you showing the
white feather now that the pinch is on? You say you are going to
withdraw the deposits of the city? All right--withdraw them. But I warn
you, if you do the bank is ruined. It will have to close its doors
to-morrow. And if it closes its doors, where is your town? Your
precious town is also ruined."</p>

<p>The Mayor looked at the banker with a white face and stricken eyes.
Jarvis Riggs leaned forward and his tones became more persuasive:</p>

<p>"Pull out your money if you like, and wreck your town. But why not
play along with us, Baxter? We're going to see this thing through." He
was smiling now, and wearing his most winning manner. "We're in a
temporary depression--yes. But six months from now we'll be out of the
woods. I know we will. We're coming back stronger than ever. You can't
sell Libya Hill short," he said, using a phrase that was in great vogue
just then. "We've not begun to see the progress we're going to make.
But the salvation and future of this town rests in your hands. So make
up your mind about it. What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>The Mayor made up his mind. Unhappy man.</p>

<p>Things drifted along. Time passed. The sands were running low.</p>

<p>By the autumn of 1929 there began to be a vague rumour going about
that all was not well at the Citizens Trust. George Webber had heard it
himself when he went home in September. But it was a nebulous thing,
and as often as not the person who whispered it fearfully would catch
himself and say:</p>

<p>"Oh, pshaw! There's nothing in it. There couldn't be! You know how
people talk."</p>

<p>But the rumour persisted through the winter, and by early March it
had become a disturbing and sinister contagion. No one could say where
it came from. It seemed to be distilled like a poison out of the mind
and heart and spirit of the whole town.</p>

<p>On the surface there was nothing to account for it. The Citizens
Trust maintained its usual appearance of solid substance, businesslike
efficiency, and Greek-templed sanctity. Its broad plate-glass windows
opening out upon the Square let in a flood of light, and the whole
atmosphere was one of utter clarity. The very breadth of those windows
seemed to proclaim to the world the complete openness and integrity of
the bank's purpose. They seemed to say:</p>

<p>"Here is the bank, and here are all the people in the bank, and all
the people in the bank are openly at work. Look, citizens, and see for
yourselves. You see there is nothing hidden here. The bank is Libya,
and Libya is the bank."</p>

<p>It was all so open that one did not have to go inside to know what
was going on. One could stand on the pavement outside and look in and
see everything. To the right were the tellers' cages, and to the left
there was a railed-off space in which the officers sat at their
sumptuous mahogany flat-topped desks. At the largest of these desks,
just inside the low enclosure, sat Jarvis Riggs himself. There he sat,
talking importantly and pompously, as though laying down the law, to
one of his customers. There he sat, briskly reading through the pile of
papers on his desk. There he sat, pausing in his work now and then to
look up at the ceiling in deep thought, or to lean back in his
swivel-chair and gently rock in meditation.</p>

<p>It was all just as it had always been.</p>

<p>Then it happened.</p>

<p>March 12, 1930 was a day that will be long remembered in the annals
of Libya Hill. The double tragedy set the stage as nothing else could
have done for the macabre weeks to follow.</p>

<p>If all the fire-bells in town had suddenly begun to ring out their
alarm at nine o'clock that morning, the news could not have spread more
rapidly that the Citizens Trust Company was closed. Word of it leapt
from mouth to mouth. And almost instantly, from every direction,
white-faced men and women came running towards the Square. There were
housewives with their aprons on, their hands still dripping dishwater;
workmen and mechanics with their warm tools in their hands; hatless
business men and clerks; young mothers carrying babies in their arms.
Everyone in town, it seemed, had dropped whatever he was doing and
rushed out in the streets the moment the news had reached him.</p>

<p>The Square itself was soon a seething mass of frenzied people.
Frantically, over and over, they asked each other the same questions:
Was it really true? How had it happened? How bad was it?</p>

<p>In front of the bank itself the crowd was quieter, more stunned. To
this spot, sooner or later, they all came, drawn by a common desperate
hope that they would yet be able to see with their own eyes that it was
not so. Like a sluggish current within that seething mass the queue
moved slowly past, and as the people saw those locked and darkened
doors they knew that all hope was gone. Some just stared with stricken
faces, some of the women moaned and wailed, from the eyes of strong men
silent tears coursed down, and from the mouths of others came the
rumble of angry mutterings.</p>

<p>For their ruin had caught up with them. Many of the people in that
throng had lost their life savings. But it was not only the bank's
depositors who were ruined. Everyone now knew that their boom was over.
They knew that the closing of the bank had frozen all their
speculations just as they were, beyond the possibility of extricating
themselves. Yesterday they could count their paper riches by ten
thousands and by millions; to-day they owned nothing, their wealth had
vanished, and they were left saddled with debts that they could never
pay.</p>

<p>And they did not yet know that their city government was bankrupt,
too--that six million dollars of public money had been lost behind
those closed and silent doors.</p>

<p>It was a little before noon on that ill-omened day that Mayor
Kennedy was found dead. And, just to put the final touch of gruesome
irony upon the whole event, a blind man found him.</p>

<p>Judge Rumford Bland testified at the inquest that he left his front
office, upstairs in the ramshackle building that he owned there on the
Square, and went out in the hall, heading in the direction of the
toilet, where he proposed to perform an essential function of nature.
It was dark out there, he said with his ghostly smile, and the floors
creaked, but this didn't matter to him--he knew the way. He said he
couldn't have lost his way even if he had wanted to. At the end of the
hall he could hear a punctual drip of water, dropping with its slow,
incessant monotone; and besides, there was the pervasive smell of the
tin urinal--all he had to do was to follow his nose.</p>

<p>He arrived in darkness and pushed open the door, and suddenly his
foot touched something. He leaned over, his white, thin fingers groped
down, and all at once they were plunged--wet, warm, sticky
reeking--into the foundering mass of what just five minutes before had
been the face and brains of a living man.</p>

<p>--No, he hadn't heard the shot--there was all that infernal
commotion out in the Square.</p>

<p>--No, he had no idea how he had got there--walked it, he
supposed--the City Hall was only twenty yards away.</p>

<p>--No, he couldn't say why His Honour should have picked that spot to
blow his brains out--there was no accounting for tastes--but if a man
wanted to do it, that was probably as good a place as any.</p>

<p>So it was that weak, easy-going, procrastinating, good-natured
Baxter Kennedy, Mayor of Libya Hill, was found--all that was left of
him--in darkness, by an evil old blind man.</p>

<p>In the days and weeks that followed the closing of the bank, Libya
Hill presented a tragic spectacle the like of which had probably never
before been seen in America. But it was a spectacle that was to be
repeated over and over again, with local variations, in many another
town and city within the next few years.</p>

<p>The ruin of Libya Hill was much more than the ruin of the bank and
the breakdown of the economic and financial order. True, when the bank
failed, all that vast and complicated scheme of things which had been
built upon it, the ramifications of which extended into every element
of the community's life, toppled and crashed. But the closing of the
bank was only like the action of a rip-cord which, once jerked, brought
the whole thing down, and in doing so laid bare the deeper and more
corrosive ruin within. And this deeper ruin--the essence of the
catastrophe--was the ruin of the human conscience.</p>

<p>Here was a town of fifty thousand people who had so abdicated every
principle of personal and communal rectitude, to say nothing of common
sense and decency, that when the blow fell they had no inner resources
with which to meet it. The town almost literally blew its brains out.
Forty people shot themselves within ten days, and others did so later.
And, as so often happens, many of those who destroyed themselves were
among the least guilty of the lot. The rest--and this was the most
shocking part of it--suddenly realising their devastating guilt to such
a degree that they could not face the results of it, now turned like a
pack of howling dogs to rend each other. Cries of vengeance rose up
from all their throats, and they howled for the blood of Jarvis Riggs.
But these cries proceeded not so much from a conviction of wounded
justice and deceived innocence as from their opposites. It was the
sublime, ironic, and irrevocable justice of what had happened to them,
and their knowledge that they alone had been responsible for it, that
maddened them. From this arose their sense of outrage and their cries
of vengeance.</p>

<p>What happened in Libya Hill and elsewhere has been described in the
learned tomes of the overnight economists as a breakdown of "the
system, the capitalist system". Yes, it was that. But it was also much
more than that. In Libya Hill it was the total disintegration of what,
in so many different ways, the lives of all these people had come to
be. It went much deeper than the mere obliteration of bank accounts,
the extinction of paper profits, and the loss of property. It was the
ruin of men who found out, as soon as these symbols of their outward
success had been destroyed, that they had nothing left--no inner
equivalent from which they might now draw new strength. It was the ruin
of men who, discovering not only that their values were false but that
they had never had any substance whatsoever, now saw at last the
emptiness and hollowness of their lives. Therefore they killed
themselves; and those who did not die by their own hands died by the
knowledge that they were already dead.</p>

<p>How can one account for such a complete drying up of all the
spiritual sources in the life of a people? When one observes a youth of
eighteen on a city street and sees the calloused scar that has become
his life, and remembers the same youth as he was ten years before when
he was a child of eight, one knows what has happened though the cause
be hidden. One knows that there came a time when life stopped growing
for that youth and the scar began; and one feels that if he could only
find the reason and the cure, he would know what revolutions are.</p>

<p>In Libya Hill there must have been a time when life stopped growing
and the scar began. But the learned economists of "the system" do not
bother about this. For them, it belongs to the realm of the
metaphysical--they are impatient of it, they will not trouble with it,
they want to confine the truth within their little picket fence of
facts. But they cannot. It is not enough to talk about the subtle
complications of the credit structure, the intrigues of politics and
business, the floating of bond issues, the dangers of inflation,
speculation, and unsound prices, or the rise and decline of banks. When
all these facts are added up, they still don't give the answer. For
there is something more to say.</p>

<p>So with Libya Hill:</p>

<p>One does not know at just what moment it began, but one suspects
that it began at some time long past in the lone, still watches of the
night, when all the people lay waiting in their beds in darkness.
Waiting for what? They did not know. They only hoped that it would
happen--some thrilling and impossible fulfilment, some glorious
enrichment and release of their pent lives, some ultimate escape from
their own tedium.</p>

<p>But it did not come.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the stiff boughs creaked in the cold bleakness of the
corner lights, and the whole town waited, imprisoned in its tedium.</p>

<p>And sometimes, in furtive hallways, doors opened and closed, there
was a padding of swift, naked feet, the stealthy rattling of brass
casters, and behind old battered shades, upon the edge of Nigger-town,
the dull and fetid quickenings of lust.</p>

<p>Sometimes, in grimy stews of night's asylumage, an oath, a blow, a
fight.</p>

<p>Sometimes, through the still air, a shot, the letting of nocturnal
blood.</p>

<p>And always, through broken winds, the sounds of shifting engines in
the station yards, far off, along the river's edge--and suddenly the
thunder of great wheels, the tolling of the bell, the loneliness of the
whistle cry wailed back, receding towards the North, and towards the
hope, the promise, and the memory of the world unfound.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the boughs creaked bleakly in stiff light, ten thousand
men were waiting in the darkness, far off a dog howled, and the
Court-House bell struck three.</p>

<p>No answer? Impossible?...Then let those--if such there be--who have
not waited in the darkness, find answers of their own.</p>

<p>But if speech could frame what spirit utters, if tongue could tell
what the lone heart knows, there would be answers somewhat other than
those which are shaped by the lean pickets of rusty facts. There would
be answers of men waiting, who have not spoken yet.</p>

<hr align="center" width="15%">
<p>Below the starred immensity of mountain night old Rumford Bland, he
that is called "The Judge", strokes his sunken jaws reflectively as he
stands at the darkened window of his front office and looks out with
sightless eyes upon the ruined town. It is cool and sweet to-night, the
myriad promises of life are lyric in the air. Gem-strewn in viewless
linkage on the hills the lights make a bracelet for the town. The blind
man knows that they are there, although he cannot see them. He strokes
his sunken jaws reflectively and smiles his ghostly smile.</p>

<p>It is so cool and sweet to-night, and spring has come. There never
was a year like this, they say, for dogwood in the hills. There are so
many thrilling, secret things upon the air to-night--a burst of
laughter, and young voices, faint, half-broken, and the music of a
dance--how could one know that when the blind man smiles and stroke's
his sunken jaws reflectively, he is looking out upon a ruined town?</p>

<p>The new Court-House and City Hall are very splendid in the dark
to-night. But he has never seen them--they were built since he went
blind. Their fronts are bathed, so people say, in steady, secret light
just like the nation's dome at Washington. The blind man strokes his
sunken jaws reflectively. Well, they <i>should</i> be splendid--they
cost enough.</p>

<p>Beneath the starred immensity of mountain night there is something
stirring in the air, a rustling of young leaves. And round the grass
roots there is something stirring in the earth to-night. And below the
grass roots and the sod, below the dew-wet pollen of young flowers,
there is something alive and stirring. The blind man strokes his sunken
jaws reflectively. Aye, there below, where the eternal worm keeps
vigil, there is something stirring in the earth. Down, down below,
where the worm incessant through the ruined house makes stir.</p>

<p>What lies there stir-less in the earth to-night, down where the worm
keeps vigil?</p>

<p>The blind man smiles his ghostly smile. In his eternal vigil the
worm stirs, but many men are rotting in their graves to-night, and
sixty-four have bullet fractures in their skulls. Ten thousand more are
lying in their beds to-night, living as shells live. They, too, are
dead, though yet unburied. They have been dead so long they can't
remember how it was to live. And many weary nights must pass before
they can join the buried dead, down where the worm keeps vigil.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the everlasting worm keeps vigil, and the blind man
strokes his sunken jaws, and slowly now he shifts his sightless gaze
and turns his back upon the ruined town.</p>

<h2><a name="chapter3-26"></a>26. The Wounded Faun</h2>

<p>Ten days after the failure of the bank in Libya Hill, Randy
Shepperton arrived in New York. He had made up his mind suddenly,
without letting George know, and the motives that brought him were
mixed. For one thing, he wanted to talk to George and see if he
couldn't help to get him straightened out. His letters had been so
desperate that Randy was beginning to be worried about him. Then, too,
Randy felt he just had to get away from Libya Hill for a few days and
out of that atmosphere of doom and ruin and death. And he was free now,
there was nothing to keep him from coming, so he came.</p>

<p>He arrived early in the morning, a little after eight o'clock, and
took a taxi from the station to the address on Twelfth Street and rang
the bell. After a long interval and another ringing of the bell, the
door lock clicked and he entered the dim-lit hall. The stairs were dark
and the whole house seemed sunk in sleep. His footfalls rang out upon
the silence. The air had a close, dead smell compounded of many
elements, among which he could distinguish the dusty emanations of old
wood and worn plankings and the ghostly reminders of many meals long
since eaten. The light was out on the second-floor landing and the
gloom was Stygian, so he groped along the wall until he found the door
and rapped loudly with his knuckles.</p>

<p>In a moment the door was almost jerked off its hinges, and George,
his hair dishevelled, his eyes red with sleep, an old bathrobe flung
hastily over his pyjamas, stood framed in the opening, blinking out
into the darkness. Randy was a little taken back by the change in his
appearance in the six months since he had last seen him. His face,
which had always had a youthful and even childish quality, had grown
older and sterner. The lines had deepened. And now his heavy lip stuck
out at his caller with a menacing challenge, and his whole pug-nosed
countenance had a bulldog look of grim truculence.</p>

<p>When Randy recovered from his first surprise he cried out
heartily:</p>

<p>"Now wait a minute! Wait a minute! Don't shoot! I'm not that fellow
at all!"</p>

<p>At the unexpected sound of the familiar voice George looked
startled, then his face broke into a broad smile of incredulity and
delight. "Well, I'll be damned!" he cried, and with that he seized hold
of Randy, wrung him vigorously by the hand, almost dragged him into the
room, and then held him off at arm's length while he grinned his
pleasure and amazement.</p>

<p>"That's better," said Randy in a tone of mock relief. "I was afraid
it might be permanent."</p>

<p>They now clapped each other on the back and exchanged those
boisterous and half-insulting epithets with which two men who have been
old friends like to greet each other when they meet. Then, almost at
once, George asked Randy eagerly about the bank. Randy told him. George
listened intently to the shocking details of the catastrophe. It was
even worse than he had supposed, and he kept firing questions at Randy.
At last Randy said:</p>

<p>"Well, that's just about the whole story. I've told you all I know.
But come, we can talk about that later. What I want to know is--how the
hell are <i>you?</i> You're not cracking up, too, are you? Your last
letters made me a little uneasy about you."</p>

<p>In their joy at seeing one another again and their eagerness to
talk, they had both remained standing by the door. But now, as Randy
put his casual finger on George's sore spot, George winced and began to
pace back and forth in an agitated way without answering.</p>

<p>Randy saw that he looked tired. His eyes were bloodshot, as if he
had not slept well, and his unshaved face made him look haggard. The
old bathrobe he was wearing had all the buttons missing, and the corded
rope that belonged to it was also gone and George had lashed a frayed
necktie round the middle to hold the thing together. This remarkable
garment added to his general appearance of weariness and exhaustion.
His features as he strode about the room had the contracted intensity
of nervous strain, and as he looked up quickly Randy saw the worry and
apprehension in his eyes.</p>

<p>Suddenly he paused and faced Randy squarely, and with a grim set to
his jaws said:</p>

<p>"All right, let me have it! What are they saying now?"</p>

<p>"Who? What is who saying?"</p>

<p>"The people back home. That's what you meant, isn't it? From what
they've written me and said to my face, I can imagine what they're
saying behind my back. Let's have it and get it over with. What are
they saying now?"</p>

<p>"Why," said Randy, "I don't know that they're saying anything. Oh,
they said plenty at first--just the kind of thing they wrote you. But
since the bank failed I don't think I've heard your name mentioned.
They've got too much real trouble to worry about now."</p>

<p>George looked incredulous, and then relieved. For a moment he
studied the floor and said nothing. But as his sense of relief spread
its soothing balm upon his agitated spirit he looked up and smiled
broadly at his friend, and then, realising for the first time that
Randy was standing there with his back against the door, he suddenly
remembered his duties as a host and burst out impulsively and
warmly:</p>

<p>"God, Randy, I'm glad to see you! I can't get over it! Sit down. Sit
down! Can't you find a chair somewhere? For Christ's sake, where
<i>are</i> all the chairs in this dump?"</p>

<p>With that he went over to a chair that was piled high with
manuscript and books, brushed these things off unceremoniously on to
the floor, and shoved the chair across the room towards his friend.</p>

<p>He apologised now for the coldness of the place, explaining
unnecessarily that the door-bell had got him out of bed, and telling
Randy to keep his overcoat on and that it would be warmer in a little
while. Then he vanished through a doorway into a noisome cubby-hole,
turned on a faucet, and came back with a coffee-pot full of water. This
he proceeded to pour into the spout of the radiator that stood below a
window. When this was done, he got down on his hands and knees, peered
about underneath, struck a match, turned some sort of valve, and
applied the flame. There was an immediate blast, and pretty soon the
water began to rattle and gurgle in the pipes.</p>

<p>"It's gas," he said, as he clambered to his feet. "That's the worst
thing about this place--it gives me headaches when I have to spend long
hours working here."</p>

<p>While this operation had been going on, Randy took a look round. The
room, which was really two large rooms thrown together when the
sliding-doors that joined them were pushed into the wall, as now,
seemed as big as a barn. The windows at the front gave on to the
street, and those at the rear looked out over some bleak little squares
of backyard fences to another row of buildings. The first impression
Randy got was one of staleness: the whole apartment had that
unmistakable look and feeling of a place where someone has lived and
where something has been finished so utterly that there is no going
back to it. It was not merely the disorder everywhere--the books strewn
around, the immense piles of manuscript, the haphazard scattering of
stray socks, shirts and collars, old shoes, and unpressed trousers
inside out. It was not even the dirty cup and saucer filled with old
cigarette-butts, all of them stained with rancid coffee, which was set
down in the vast and untidy litter of the table. It was just that life
had gone out of all these things--they were finished--all as cold and
tired and stale as the old dirty cup and the exhausted butts.</p>

<p>George was living in the midst of this dreary waste with a kind of
exasperated and unhappy transciency. Randy saw that he had caught him
on the wing, in that limbo of waiting between work which is one of the
most tormenting periods a writer can know. He was through with one
thing, and yet not really ready to settle down in earnest to another.
He was in a state of furious but exhausted ferment. But it was not
merely that he was going through a period of gestation before going on
with his next book. Randy realised that the reception of his first, the
savagery of the attack against him in Libya Hill, the knowledge that he
had done something more than write a book--that he had also torn up
violently by the roots all those ties of friendship and sentiment that
bind a man to home--all of this, Randy felt, had so bewildered and
overwhelmed him that now he was caught up in the maelstrom of the
conflict which he had himself produced. He was not ready to do another
piece of work because his energies were still being absorbed and used
up by the repercussions of the first.</p>

<p>Moreover, as Randy looked round the room and his eye took in the
various objects that contributed to its incredible chaos, he saw, in a
dusty corner, a small green smock or apron, wrinkled as though it had
been thrown aside with a gesture of weary finality, and beside it,
half-folded inwards, a single small and rather muddy overshoe. The
layer of dust upon them showed that they had lain there for months.
These were the only poignant ghosts, and Randy knew that something
which had been there in that room had gone out of it for ever--that
George was done with it.</p>

<p>Randy saw how it was with George, and felt that almost any decisive
act would be good for him. So now he said:</p>

<p>"For God's sake, George, why don't you pack up and clear out of all
this? You're through with it--it's finished--it'll only take you a day
or two to wind the whole thing up. So pull yourself together and get
out. Move away somewhere--anywhere--just to enjoy the luxury of waking
up in the morning and finding none of this round you."</p>

<p>"I know," said George, going over to a sagging couch and tossing
back the pile of foul-looking bedclothes that covered it and flinging
himself down wearily. "I've thought of it," he said.</p>

<p>Randy did not press the point. He knew it would be no use. George
would have to work round to it in his own way and in his own good
time.</p>

<p>George shaved and dressed, and they went out for breakfast. Then
they returned and talked all morning, and were finally interrupted by
the ringing of the telephone.</p>

<p>George answered it. Randy could tell by the sounds which came from
the transmitter that the caller was female, garrulous, and unmistakably
Southern. George did nothing for a while but blurt out polite
banalities:</p>

<p>"Well now, that's fine...I certainly do appreciate it...That's
mighty nice of you...Well now, I'm certainly glad you called. I hope
you will remember me to all of them." Then he was silent, listening
intently, and Randy gathered from the contraction of his face that the
conversation had now reached another stage. In a moment he said slowly,
in a somewhat puzzled tone: "Oh, he is?...He did?...Well"--somewhat
indefinitely--"that's mighty nice of him...Yes, I'll remember...Thank
you very much...Good-bye."</p>

<p>He hung up the receiver and grinned wearily.</p>

<p>"That," he said, "was one of the
I-just-called-you-up-to-tell-you-that-
I've-read-it-all-every-word-of-it-and-I-think-it's-perfectly-grand
people--another lady from the South." As he went on his voice
unconsciously dropped into burlesque as he tried to imitate the unction
of a certain type of Southern female whose words drip molasses mixed
with venom:</p>

<p>"'Why, I'll declayah, we're <i>all</i> just so proud of yew-w! I'm
just simply thrilled to <i>daith!</i> It's the most wondaful thing I
<i>evah</i> read! Why it <i>is!</i> Why, I nevah <i>dreamed</i> that
anyone could have such a wondaful command of lang-widge!'"</p>

<p>"But don't you like it just a little?" asked Randy. "Even if it's
laid on with a trowel, you must get some satisfaction from it."</p>

<p>"God!" George said wearily, and came back and fell upon the couch.
"If you only knew! That's only one out of a thousand! That telephone
there"--he jerked a thumb towards it--"has played a tune for months
now! I know them all--I've got 'em classified! I can tell by the tone
of the voice the moment they speak whether it's going to be type B or
group X."</p>

<p>"So the author is already growing jaded? He's already bored with his
first taste of fame?"</p>

<p>"<i>Fame?</i>"--disgustedly. "That's not fame--that's just plain
damn rag-picking!"</p>

<p>"Then you don't think the woman was sincere?"</p>

<p>"Yes"--his face and tone were bitter now--"she had all the sincerity
of a carrion crow. She'll go back and tell them that she talked to me,
and by the time she's finished with me she'll have a story that every
old hag in town can lick her chops and cackle over for the next six
months."</p>

<p>It sounded so unreasonable and unjust that Randy spoke up
quickly:</p>

<p>"Don't you think you're being unfair?"</p>

<p>George's head was down dejectedly and he did not even look up; with
his hands plunged in his trouser pockets he just snorted something
unintelligible but scornful beneath his breath.</p>

<p>It annoyed and disappointed Randy to see him acting so much like a
spoiled brat, so he said:</p>

<p>"Look here! It's about time you grew up and learned some sense It
seems to me you're being pretty arrogant. Do you think you can afford
to be? I doubt if you or any man can go through life successfully
playing the spoiled genius."</p>

<p>Again he muttered something in a sullen tone.</p>

<p>"Maybe that woman was a fool," Randy went on. "Well, a lot of people
are. And maybe she hasn't got sense enough to understand what you wrote
in the way you think it should be understood. But what of it? She gave
the best she had. It seems to me that instead of sneering at her now,
you could be grateful."</p>

<p>George raised his head: "You heard the conversation, then?"</p>

<p>"No, only what you told me."</p>

<p>"All right, then--you didn't get the whole story. I wouldn't mind if
she'd just called up to gush about the book, but, look here!"--he
leaned towards Randy very earnestly and tapped him on the knee. "I
don't want you to get the idea that I'm just a conceited fool. I've
lived through and found out about something these last few months that
most people never have the chance to know. I give you my solemn word
for it, that woman didn't call up because she liked my book and wanted
to tell me so. She called up," he cried bitterly, "to pry round, and to
find out what she could about me, and to pick my bones."</p>

<p>"Oh, look here now--" Randy began impatiently.</p>

<p>"Yes, she did, too! I know what I'm talking about!" he said
earnestly. "Here's what you didn't hear--here's what she was working
round to all the time--it came out at the end. I don't know who she is,
I never heard of her before--but she's a friend of Ted Reeve's wife.
And apparently he thinks I put him in the book, and has been making
threats that he's going to kill me if I ever go back home."</p>

<p>This was true; Randy had heard it in Libya Hill.</p>

<p>"That's what it was about," George sneered bitterly--"that woman's
call. That's what most of the calls are about. They want to talk to the
Beast of the Apocalypse, feel him out, and tell him: 'Ted's all right!
Now don't you believe all those things, you hear! He was upset at
first--but he sees the whole thing now, the way you meant it--and
everything's all right.' That's what she said to me, so maybe I'm not
the fool you think I am!"</p>

<p>He was so earnest and excited that for a moment Randy did not answer
him. Besides, making allowances for the distortion of his feelings, he
could see some justice in what George said.</p>

<p>"Have you had many calls like that?" Randy asked.</p>

<p>"Oh"--wearily--"almost every day. I think everyone who has been up
here from home since the book was published has telephoned me. They go
about it in different ways. There are those who call me up as if I were
some kind of ghoul: 'How are you?'--in a small, quiet tone such as you
might use to a condemned man just before they lead him to the death
chamber at Sing Sing--'Are you all right?' And then you get alarmed,
you begin to stammer and to stumble round, 'Why, yes? Yes, I'm fine!
Fine, thanks!'--meanwhile, beginning to feel yourself all over just to
see if you're all there. And then they say in that same still voice:
'Well, I just wanted to know...I just called up to find out...I hope
you're all right.'"</p>

<p>After looking at Randy for a moment in a tormented and bewildered
way, he burst out in an exasperated laugh:</p>

<p>"It's been enough to give a hippopotamus the creeps! To listen to
them talk, you'd think I was Jack the Ripper! Even those who call up to
laugh and joke about it take the attitude that the only reason I wrote
the book was to see how much dirt and filth I could dig up on people I
didn't like. Yes!" he cried bitterly. "My greatest supporters at home
seem to be the disappointed little soda-jerkers who never made a go of
it and the frustrated hangers-on who never got into the Country Club.
'You sure did give it to that son-of-a-bitch, Jim So-and-so!' they call
me up to tell me. 'You sure did burn him up! I had to laugh when I read
what you said about him--boy!' Or: 'Why didn't you say something about
that bastard, Charlie What's-his-name? I'd have given anything to see
you take him for a ride!'...Jesus God!" He struck his fist upon his
knee with furious exasperation. "That's all it means to them: nothing
but nasty gossip, slander, malice, envy, a chance of getting back at
someone--you'd think that none of them had ever read a book before.
Tell me," he said earnestly, bending towards Randy, "isn't there anyone
there--anyone besides yourself--who gives a damn about the book itself?
Isn't there anyone who has read it as a book, who sees what it was
about, who understands what I was trying to do?"</p>

<p>His eyes were full of torment now. It was out at last--the thing
Randy had dreaded and wanted to avoid. He said:</p>

<p>"I should think you'd know more about that by this time than anyone.
After all, you've had more opportunity than anyone else to find
out."</p>

<p>Well, that was out, too. It was the answer that he had to have, that
he had feared to get. He stared at Randy for a minute or two with his
tormented eyes, then he laughed bitterly and began to rave:</p>

<p>"Well, then, to hell with it! To hell with all of it!" He began to
curse violently. "The small two-timing bunch of crooked sons-ofbitches!
They can go straight to hell! They've done their best to ruin me!"</p>

<p>It was ignoble and unworthy and untrue. Randy saw that he was
lashing himself into a fit of violent recrimination in which all that
was worst and weakest m him was coming out--distortion, prejudice, and
self-pity. These were the things he would have to conquer somehow or
belost. Randy stopped him curtly:</p>

<p>"Now, no more of that! For God's sake, George, pull yourself
together! If a lot of damn fools read your book and didn't understand
it, that's not Libya Hill, that's the whole world. People there are no
different from people anywhere. They thought you wrote about them--and
the truth is, you did. So they got mad at you. You hurt their feelings,
and you touched their pride. And, to be blunt about it, you opened up a
lot of old wounds. There were places where you rubbed salt in. In
saying this, I'm not like those others you complain about: you know
damn wel! I understand what you did and why you had to do it. But just
the same, there were some things that you did not have to do--and you'd
have had a better book if you hadn't done them. So don't whine about it
now. And don't think you're a martyr."</p>

<p>But he had got himself primed into a mood of martyrdom. As Randy
looked at him sitting there, one hand gripping his knee, his face
sullen, his head brooding down between his hulking shoulders, he could
see how this mood had grown upon him. To begin with, he had been naive
not to realise how people would feel about some of the things he had
written. Then, when the first accusing letters came, he had been
overwhelmed and filled with shame and humility and guilt over the pain
he had caused. But as time went on and the accusations became more
vicious and envenomed, he had wanted to strike back and defend himself.
When he saw there was no way to do that--when people answered his
explanatory letters only with new threats and insults--he had grown
bitter. And finally, after taking it all so hard and torturing himself
through the whole gamut of emotions, he had sunk into this morass of
self-pity.</p>

<p>George began to talk now about "the artist", spouting all the
intellectual and aesthetic small change of the period. The artist, it
seemed, was a kind of fabulous, rare, and special creature who lived on
"beauty" and "truth" and had thoughts so subtle that the average man
could comprehend them no more than a mongrel could understand the moon
he bayed at. The artist, therefore, could achieve his "art" only
through a constant state of flight into some magic wood, some province
of enchantment.</p>

<p>The phrases were so spurious that Randy felt like shaking him. And
what annoyed him most was the knowledge that George was really so much
better than this. He must know how cheap and false what he was saying
really was. At last Randy said to him quietly:</p>

<p>"George, of all the people I have ever known, you are the least
qualified to play the wounded faun."</p>

<p>But he was so immersed in his fantasy that he paid no attention. He
just said: "Huh?"--and then was off again. Anybody who was "a real
artist," he said, was doomed to be an outcast from society. His
inevitable fate was to be "driven out by the tribe."</p>

<p>It was all so wrong that Randy lost patience with him:</p>

<p>"For Christ's sake, George, what's the matter with you? You're
talking like a fool!" he said. "You haven't been driven out of
anywhere! You've only got yourself in a little hot water at home! Here
you've been ranting your head off about 'beauty' and 'truth'! God! Why
in hell, then, don't you stop lying to yourself? Can't you see? The
truth is that for the first time in your life you've managed to get a
foothold in the thing you want to do. Your book got some good notices
and has had a fair sale. You're in the right spot now to go on. So
where have you been driven? No doubt all those threatening letters have
made you feel like an exile from home, but hell, man!--you've been an
exile for years. And of your own accord, too! You know you've had no
intention of ever going back there to live. But just as soon as they
started yelling for your scalp, you fooled yourself into believing
you'd been driven out by force! And, as for this idea of yours that a
man achieves 'beauty' by escaping somewhere from the life he knows,
isn't the truth just the opposite? Haven't you written me the same
thing yourself a dozen times?"</p>

<p>"How do you mean?" he said sullenly.</p>

<p>"I mean, taking your own book as an example, isn't it true that
every good thing in it came, not because you withdrew from life, but
because you got into it--because you managed to understand and use the
life you knew?"</p>

<p>He was silent now. His face, which had been screwed up into a morose
scowl, gradually began to relax and soften, and at last he looked up
with a little crooked smile.</p>

<p>"I don't know what comes over me sometimes," he said. He shook his
head and looked ashamed of himself and laughed. "You're right, of
course," he went on seriously. "What you say is true. And that's the
way it has to be, too. A man must use what he knows--he can't use what
he doesn't know...And that's why some of the critics make me mad," he
added bluntly.</p>

<p>"How's that?" asked Randy, glad to hear him talking sense at last.
"Oh, you know," he said, "you've seen the reviews. Some of them said
the book was 'too autobiographical'."</p>

<p>This was surprising. And Randy, with the outraged howls of Libya
Hill still ringing in his ears, and with George's outlandish rantings
in answer to those howls still echoing in the room, could hardly
believe he had heard him aright. He could only say in frank
astonishment:</p>

<p>"Well, it <i>was</i> autobiographical--you can't deny it."</p>

<p>"But not 'too autobiographical'," George went on earnestly. "If the
critics had just crossed those words out and written in their place
'not autobiographical enough', they'd have hit it squarely. That's
where I failed. That's where the real fault was." There was no question
that he meant it, for his face was twisted suddenly with a grimace, the
scar of his defeat and shame. "My young hero was a stick, a fool, a
prig, a snob, as Dedalus was--as in my own presentment of the book I
was. There was the weakness. Oh, I know--there were lots of
autobiographical spots in the book, and where it was true I'm not
ashamed of it, but the hitching-post I tied the horses to wasn't good
enough. It wasn't true autobiography. I've learned that now, and
learned why. The failure comes from the false personal. There's the
guilt. That's where the young genius business gets in--the young artist
business, what you called a while ago the wounded faun business. It
gets in and it twists the vision. The vision may be shrewd, subtle,
piercing, within a thousand special frames accurate and Joycean--but
within the larger one, false, mannered, and untrue. And the large one
is the one that matters."</p>

<p>He meant it now, and he was down to solid rock. Randy saw the
measure of his suffering. And yet, now as before, he seemed to be going
to extremes and taking it too hard. In some such measure all men fail,
and Randy said:</p>

<p>"But was anything ever as good as it could be? Who succeeded
anyway?"</p>

<p>"Oh, plenty did!" he said impatiently. "Tolstoy when he wrote <i>War
and Peace</i>. Shakespeare when he wrote <i>King Lear</i>. Mark Twain
in the first part of <i>Life on the Mississippi</i>. Of course they're
not as good as they might have been--nothing ever is. Only, they missed
in the right way: they might have put the shot a little further--but
they were not hamstrung by their vanity, shackled by their damned
self-consciousness. That's what makes for failure. That's where I
failed."</p>

<p>"Then what's the remedy?"</p>

<p>"To use myself to the top of my bent. To use everything I have. To
milk the udder dry, squeeze out the last drop, until there is nothing
left. And if I use myself as a character, to withhold nothing, to try
to see and paint myself as I am--the bad along with the good, the
shoddy alongside of the true--just as I must try to see and draw every
other character. No more false personal, no more false pride, no more
pettiness and injured feelings. In short, to kill the wounded
faun."</p>

<p>Randy nodded: "Yes. And what now? What comes next?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," he answered frankly. His eyes showed his perplexity.
"That's the thing that's got me stumped. It's not that I don't know
what to write about.--God!" he laughed suddenly. "You hear about these
fellows who write one book and then can't do another because they
haven't got anything else to write about!"</p>

<p>"You're not worried about that?"</p>

<p>"Lord, no! My trouble's all the other way round! I've got too much
material. It keeps backing up on me"--he gestured round him at the
tottering piles of manuscript that were everywhere about the
room--"until sometimes I wonder what in the name of God I'm going to do
with it all--how I'm going to find a frame for it, a pattern, a
channel, a way to make it flow!" He brought his fist down sharply on
his knee and there was a note of desperation in his voice. "Sometimes
it actually occurs to me that a man may be able to write no more
because he gets drowned in his own secretions!"</p>

<p>"So you're not afraid of ever running dry?"</p>

<p>He laughed loudly. "At times I almost hope I will," he said.
"There'd be a kind of comfort in the thought that some day--maybe after
I'm forty--I would dry up and become like a camel, living on my hump.
Of course, I don't really mean that either. It's not good to dry
up--it's a form of death...No, that's not what bothers me. The thing
I've got to find out is the way!" He was silent a moment, staring at
Randy, then he struck his fist upon his knee again and cried: "The
<i>way!</i> The <i>way!</i> Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Randy, "I think I do. But how?"</p>

<p>George's face was full of perplexity.. He was silent, trying to
phrase his problem.</p>

<p>"I'm looking for a way," he said at last. "I think it may be
something like what people vaguely mean when they speak of fiction. A
kind of legend, perhaps. Something--a story--composed of all the
knowledge I have, of all the living I've seen. Not the facts, you
understand--not just the record of my life--but something truer than
the facts--something distilled out of my experience and transmitted
into a form of universal application. That's what the best fiction is,
isn't it?"</p>

<p>Randy smiled and nodded encouragement. George was all right. He
needn't have worried about him. He would work his way out of the
morass. So Randy said cheerfully:</p>

<p>"Have you started the new book yet?"</p>

<p>He began to talk rapidly, and again Randy saw worried tension in his
eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "I've written a whole lot. These ledgers here"--he
indicated a great stack of battered ledgers on the table--"and all this
manuscript"--he swept his arms in a wide gesture round the room--"they
are full of new writing. I must have written half a million words or
more."</p>

<p>Randy then made the blunder which laymen so often innocently make
when they talk to writers.</p>

<p>"What's it about?" he said.</p>

<p>He was rewarded with an evil scowl. George did not answer. He began
to pace up and down, thinking to himself with smouldering intensity. At
last he stopped by the table, turned and faced Randy, and, with the
redemptive honesty that was the best thing in him, bluntly said:</p>

<p>"No, I haven't started my new book yet!...Thousands of words"--he
whacked the battered ledgers with a flattened palm--"hundreds of ideas,
dozens of scenes, of scraps, of fragments--but no book!...And"--the
worried lines about his eyes now deepened--"time goes by! It has been
almost five months since the other book was published, and now"--he
threw his arms out towards the huge stale chaos of that room with a
gesture of exasperated fury--"here I am! Time gets away from me before
I know that it has gone! Time!" he cried, and smote his fist into his
palm and stared before him with a blazing and abstracted eye as though
he saw a ghost--"Time!"</p>

<p>His enemy was Time. Or perhaps it was his friend. One never knows
for sure.</p>

<p>Randy stayed in New York several days, and the two friends talked
from morning till night and from night till morning. Everything that
came into their heads they talked about. George would stride back and
forth across the floor in his restless way, talking or listening to
Randy, and suddenly would pause beside the table, scowl, look round him
as though he were seeing the room for the first time, bring down his
hand with a loud <i>whack</i> on a pile of manuscript, and boom
out:</p>

<p>"Do you know what the reason is for all these words I've written?
Well, I'll tell you. It's because I'm so damned lazy!"</p>

<p>"It doesn't look like the room of a lazy man to me," said Randy,
laughing.</p>

<p>"It is though," George answered. "That's why it looks this way. You
know"--his face grew thoughtful as he spoke--"I've got an idea that a
lot of the work in this world gets done by lazy people. That's the
reason they work--because they're so lazy."</p>

<p>"I don't follow you," said Randy, "but go on--spill it--get it off
your chest."</p>

<p>"Well," he said, quite seriously, "it's this way: you work because
you're afraid not to. You work because you have to drive yourself to
such a fury to begin. That part's just plain hell 1 It's so hard to get
started that once you do you're afraid of slipping back. You'd rather
do anything than go through all that agony again--so you keep
going--you keep going faster all the time--you keep going till you
couldn't stop even if you wanted to. You forget to eat, to shave, to
put on a clean shirt when you have one. You almost forget to sleep, and
when you do try to you can't--because the avalanche has started, and it
keeps going night and day. And people say: 'Why don't you stop some
time? Why don't you forget about it now and then? Why don't you take a
few days off?' And you don't do it because you can't--you can't stop
yourself--and even if you could you'd be afraid to because there'd be
all that hell to go through getting started up again. Then people say
you're a glutton for work, but it isn't so. It's laziness--just plain,
damned, simple laziness, that's all."</p>

<p>Randy laughed again. He had to--it was so much like George--no one
else could have come out with a thing like that. And what made it so
funny was that he knew George saw the humour of it, too, and yet was
desperately in earnest. He could imagine the weeks and months of solemn
cogitation that had brought George to this paradoxical conclusion, and
now, like a whale after a long plunge, he was coming up to spout and
breathe.</p>

<p>"Well, I see your point," Randy said. "Maybe you're right. But at
least it's a unique way of being lazy."</p>

<p>"No," George answered, "I think it's probably a very natural one.
Now take all those fellows that you read about," he went on excitedly
--"Napoleon--and--and Balzac--and Thomas Edison"--he burst out
triumphantly--"these fellows who never sleep more than an hour or two
at a time, and can keep going night and day--why, that's not because
they love to work! It's because they're really lazy--and afraid not to
work because they <i>know</i> they're lazy! Why, hell yes!" he went on
enthusiastically. "I know that's the way it's been with all those
fellows! Old Edison now," he said scornfully, "going round pretending
to people that he works all the time because he <i>likes</i> it!"</p>

<p>"You don't believe that?"</p>

<p>"Hell, no!"--scornfully. "I'll bet you anything you like that if you
could really find out what's going on in old Edison's mind, you'd find
that he wished he could stay in bed every day until two o'clock in the
afternoon! And then get up and scratch himself! And then lie around in
the sun for a while! And hang round with the boys down at the village
store, talking about politics, arid who's going to win the World Series
next autumn!"</p>

<p>"Then what keeps him from it, if that's what he wants to do?"</p>

<p>"Why," he cried impatiently, "<i>laziness!</i> That's all. He's
afraid to do it because he knows he's so damned lazy! And he's ashamed
of being lazy, and afraid he'll get found out! That's why!"</p>

<p>"Ah, but that's another thing! Why is he ashamed of it?"</p>

<p>"Because," he said earnestly, "every time he wants to lie in bed
until two o'clock in the afternoon, he hears the voice of his old
man----"</p>

<p>"His old man?"</p>

<p>"Sure. His father." He nodded vigorously.</p>

<p>"But Edison's father has been dead for years, hasn't he?"</p>

<p>"Sure--but that doesn't matter. He hears him just the same. Every
time he rolls over to get an extra hour or two, I'll bet you he hears
old Pa Edison hollering at him from the foot of the stairs, telling him
to get up, and that he's not worth powder enough to blow him sky high,
and that when he was <i>his</i> age, he'd been up four hours already
and done a whole day's work--poor, miserable orphan that he was!"</p>

<p>"Really, I didn't know that. Was Edison's father an orphan?"</p>

<p>"Sure--they all are when they holler at you from the foot of the
stairs. And school was always at least six miles away, and they were
always barefooted, and it was always snowing. God!" he laughed
suddenly. "No one's old man ever went to school except under polar
conditions. They all did. And that's why you get up, that's why you
drive yourself, because you're afraid not to--afraid of 'that damned
Joyner blood in you.'...So I'm afraid that's the way it's going to be
with me until the end of my days. Every time I see the <i>Ile de
France</i> or the <i>Aquitania</i> or the <i>Berengaria</i> backing
into the river and swinging into line on Saturday, and see the funnels
with their racing slant, and the white breasts of the great liners, and
something catches at my throat, and suddenly I hear mermaids
singing--I'll also hear the voice of the old man yelling at me from as
far as back as I can remember, and telling me I'm not worth the powder
to blow me up. And every time I dream of tropic isles, of plucking
breadfruit from the trees, or of lying stretched out beneath a
palm-tree in Samoa, fanned by an attractive lady of those regions clad
in her latest string of beads--I'll hear the voice of the old man.
Every time I dream of lying sprawled out with Peter Breughel in
Cockaigne, with roast pigs trotting by upon the hoof, and with the
funnel of a beer bung in my mouth--I'll hear the voice of the old man.
Thus conscience doth make cowards of us all. I'm lazy--but every time I
surrender to my baser self, the old man hollers from the stairs."</p>

<p>George was full of his own problems and talked about them
constantly. Randy was an understanding listener. But suddenly one day,
towards the end of Randy's visit, the thought struck George as strange
that his friend should be taking so much time off from his job. He
asked Randy about it. How had he managed it?</p>

<p>"I haven't got a job," Randy answered quietly with his little
embarrassed laugh. "They threw me out."</p>

<p>"You mean to say that that bastard Merrit--" George began, hot with
instant anger.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't blame him," Randy broke in. "He couldn't help it. The
higher-ups were on his tail and he had to do it. He said I wasn't
getting the business, and it's true--I wasn't. But what the Company
doesn't know is that nobody can get the business any more. It isn't
there, and hasn't been for the last year or so. You saw how it was when
you were home. Every penny anybody could get hold of went into real
estate speculation. That was the only business they had left down
there. And now, of course, that's gone, too, since the bank
failed."</p>

<p>"And do you mean to say," George commented, speaking the words
slowly and with emphasis--"do you mean to say that Merrit seized that
moment to throw you out on your ear? Why, the dirty----"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Randy. "I got the sack just a week after the bank
closed. I don't know whether Merrit figured that was the best time to
get rid of me or whether it just happened so. But what's the
difference? It's been coming for a long time. I've seen it coming for a
year or more. It was just a question of when. And believe me," he said
with quiet emphasis, "I've been through hell. I lived from day to day
in fear and dread of it, knowing it was coming and knowing there wasn't
anything I could do to head it off. But the funny thing is, now it's
happened I feel relieved." He smiled his old clear smile. "It's the
truth," he said. "I never would have had the guts to quit--I was making
pretty good money, you know--but now that I'm out, I'm glad. I'd
forgotten how it felt to be a free man. Now I can hold my head up and
look anybody in the eye and tell the Great Man, Paul S. Appleton
himself, to go to the devil. It's a good feeling. I like it."</p>

<p>"But what are you going to do, Randy?" asked George with evident
concern.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Randy cheerfully. "I haven't any plans. All the
years I was with the Company I lived pretty well, but I also managed to
save a little something. And, luckily, I didn't put it in the Citizens
Trust, or in real estate either, so I've still got it. And I own the
old family house. Margaret and I can get along all right for a while.
Of course, jobs that pay as well as the one I had don't turn up round
every corner, but this is a big country and there's always a place for
a good man. Did you ever hear of a good man who couldn't find work?" he
said.</p>

<p>"Well, you can't be too sure of that," said George, shaking his head
dubiously. "Maybe I'm wrong," he went on, pausing and frowning
thoughtfully, "but I don't think the Stock Market crash and the bank
failure in Libya Hill were isolated events. I'm coming to feel," he
said, "that we may be up against something new--something that's going
to cut deeper than anything America has experienced before. The papers
are beginning to take it seriously. They're calling it a depression.
Everybody seems to be scared."</p>

<p>"Oh, pshaw!" said Randy with a laugh. "You are feeling low. That's
because you live in New York. Here the Stock Market is everything. When
it's high, times are good; when it's low, they're bad. But New York is
not America."</p>

<p>"I know," said George. "But I'm not thinking about the Stock Market.
I'm thinking about America...Sometimes it seems to me," he continued
slowly, like a man who gropes his way in darkness over an unfamiliar
road, "that America went off the track somewhere--back round the time
of the Civil War, or pretty soon afterwards. Instead of going ahead and
developing along the line in which the country started out, it got
shunted off in another direction--and now we look round and see we've
gone places we didn't mean to go. Suddenly we realise that America has
turned into something ugly--and vicious--and corroded at the heart of
its power with easy wealth and graft and special privilege...And the
worst of it is the intellectual dishonesty which all this corruption
has bred. People are <i>afraid</i> to think straight--<i>afraid</i> to
face themselves--<i>afraid</i> to look at things and see them as they
are. We've become like a nation of advertising men, all hiding behind
catch phrases like 'prosperity' and 'rugged individualism' and 'the
American way'. And the real things like freedom, and equal opportunity,
and the integrity and worth of the individual--things that have
belonged to the American dream since the beginning--they have become
just words, too. The substance has gone out of them--they're not real
any more...Take your own case. You say you feel free at last because
you've lost your job. I don't doubt it--but it's a funny kind of
freedom. And just how free <i>are</i> you?"</p>

<p>"Well, free enough to suit me," said Randy heartily. "And, funny or
not, I'm freer than I've ever been before. Free enough to take my time
and look round a bit before I make a new connection. I don't want to
get in with another outfit like the old one. I'll land on my feet," he
said serenely.</p>

<p>"But how are you going to do it?" asked George. "There can't be
anything for you in Libya Hill, with the bottom dropped out of
everything down there."</p>

<p>"Hell, I'm not wedded to the place!" said Randy. "I'll go anywhere.
Remember, I've been a salesman all my life--I'm used to travelling
round. And I have friends in the game--in other lines--who'll help me.
That's one good thing about being a salesman: if you can sell one
thing, you can sell anything, and it's easy to switch products. I know
my way round," he concluded with strong confidence. "Don't you worry
about me."</p>

<p>They said very little more about it. And when Randy left, his
parting words at the station were:</p>

<p>"Well, so long, fellow! <i>You're</i> going to be all right. But
don't forget to kill that wounded faun! As for me, I don't know just
what the next move is, but I'm on my way!"</p>

<p>With that he got aboard his train, and was gone.</p>

<p>But George wasn't too sure about Randy. And the more he thought
about him, the less sure he became. Randy had certainly not been licked
by what had happened to him, and that was good; but there was something
about his attitude--his cheerful optimism in the face of disaster--that
seemed spurious. He had the clearest head of anybody George knew, but
it was almost as if he had shut off one compartment of his brain and
wasn't using at. It was all very puzzling.</p>

<p>"There are tides in the affairs of men," George thought
musingly--"definite periods of ebb and flow...And when they come, they
come, and can't be held back by wishing."</p>

<p>That was it, perhaps. It seemed to George that Randy was caught in
the ebb and didn't know it. And that was what made it so queer and
puzzling--that <i>he</i>, of all people, shouldn't know it.</p>

<p>Also, he had spoken about not wanting to get mixed up with another
outfit like the old one. Did he think the fearful pressures he had been
subject to were peculiar to the company he had been working for, and
that their counterparts existed nowhere else? Did he suppose he could
escape those conditions just by changing jobs? Did he believe it was
possible by such a shift to enjoy all the glorious advantages he had
ever dreamed of as a bright, ambitious youth--high income and good
living far beyond what most men are accustomed to--and to do it without
paying the cost in other ways?</p>

<p>"What will you have? quoth God; pay for it, and take it," said
Emerson, in that wonderful essay on "Compensation" that every American
ought to be required by law to read...Well, that was true. One always
paid for it...</p>

<p>Good Lord! Didn't Randy know you can't go home again?</p>

<p>The next few years were terrible ones for all America, and
especially terrible for Randy Shepperton.</p>

<p>He didn't get another job. He tried everything, but nothing worked.
There just weren't any jobs. Men were being let off by the thousands
everywhere, and nowhere were new ones being taken on.</p>

<p>After eighteen months his savings were gone, and he was desperate.
He had to sell the old family house, and what he got for it was a mere
pittance. He and Margaret rented a small apartment, and for another
year or so, by careful management, they lived on what the house had
brought them. Then that, too, was gone. Randy was on his uppers now. He
fell ill, and it was an illness of the spirit more than of the flesh.
At last, when there was nothing else to do, he and Margaret moved away
from Libya Hill and went to live with the older sister who was married,
and stayed there with her husband's family--dependents on the bounty of
these kindly strangers.</p>

<p>And at the end of all of this, Randy--he of the clear eyes and the
quick intelligence--he who was nobody's fool--he who thought he loved
the truth and had always been able to see straight to the heart of most
things--Randy went on relief.</p>

<p>And by that time George thought he understood it. Behind Randy's
tragedy George thought he could see a personal devil in the form of a
very bright and plausible young man, oozing confidence and crying:
"Faith!" when there was no faith, and dressed like a travelling
salesman. Yes, salesmanship had done its job too well.
Salesmanship--that commercial brand of special pleading--that devoted
servant of self-interest--that sworn enemy of truth. George remembered
how Randy had been able to look at <i>his</i> alien problem and see it
in the abstract, whole and clear, because there was no self-interest to
cast its shadow on his vision. He could save others--himself he could
not save, because he could no longer see the truth about himself.</p>

<p>And it seemed to George that Randy's tragedy was the essential
tragedy of America. America--the magnificent, unrivalled, unequalled,
unbeatable, unshrinkable, supercolossal,
99-and-44-one-hundredths-per-cent-pure, schoolgirl-complexion,
covers-the-earth, I'd-walk-a-mile-for-it, four-out-of-five-have-it, his
master's-voice, askthe-man-who-owns-one, blueplate-special home of
advertising, salesmanship, and special pleading in all its many catchy
and beguiling forms.</p>

<p>Had not the real rulers of America--the business men--been wrong
about the depression from the start? Had they not pooh-poohed it and
tried to wipe it out with words, refusing to see it for what it was?
Had they not kept saying that prosperity was just round the
corner--long after "prosperity", so-called, had vanished, and the very
corner it was supposed to be round had flattened out and bent into a
precipitate downward curve of hunger, want, and desperation?</p>

<p>Well, Randy had been right about the wounded faun. For George knew
now that his own self-pity was just his precious egotism coming between
him and the truth he strove for as a writer. What Randy didn't know was
that business also had its wounded fauns. And they, it seemed, were a
species that you could not kill so lightly. For business was the most
precious form of egotism--self-interest at its dollar value. Kill that
with truth, and what would be left?</p>

<p>A better way of life, perhaps, but it would not be built on business
as we know it.</p>

<h2><a name="book4"></a>BOOK IV. - THE QUEST OF THE FAIR MEDUSA</h2>

<p><i>George took Randy's advice and moved. He did not know where to
go. All he wanted was to get away as far as possible from Park Avenue,
from the aesthetic jungles of the lion hunters, from the half-life of
wealth and fashion that had grown like a parasite upon the sound body
of America. He went to live in Brooklyn.</i></p>

<p><i>He had made a little money from his book, so now he paid his
debts and quit the job he held as a teacher at the School for Utility
Cultures. From this time on, he earned his precarious living solely by
what he wrote.</i></p>

<p><i>For four years he lived in Brooklyn, and four years in Brooklyn
are a geologic age--a single stratum of grey time. They were years of
poverty, of desperation, of loneliness unutterable. All about him were
the poor, the outcast, the neglected and forsaken people of America,
and he was one of them. But life is strong, and year after year it went
on round him in all its manifold complexity, rich with its unnoticed
and unrecorded little happenings. He saw it all, be took it all in
hungrily as part of his experience, he recorded much of it, and in the
end he squeezed it dry as he tried to extract its hidden
meanings.</i></p>

<p><i>And what was he like inside while these grey years were slipping
by? What was he up to, what was he doing, what did he want?</i></p>

<p><i>That's rather hard to tell, because he wanted so many things, but
the thing he wanted most was Fame. Those were the years of his
concentrated quest of that fair Medusa. He had had his little taste of
glory, and it was bitter in his mouth. He thought the reason was that
he had not been good enough--and he had not been good enough. Therefore
he thought that what be had had was not Fame at all, but only a
moment's notoriety. He had been a seven-day wonder--that was
all.</i></p>

<p><i>Well, he had learned some things since he wrote his first book.
He would try again.</i></p>

<p><i>So he lived and wrote, and wrote and lived, and lived there by
himself in Brooklyn. And when he had worked for hours at a stretch,
forgetting food and sleep and everything, he would rise from his desk
at last and stagger forth into the night-time streets, reeling like a
drunkard with his weariness. He would eat his supper at a restaurant,
and then, because his mind was feverish and he knew he could not sleep,
he would walk to Brooklyn Bridge and cross It to Manhattan, and ferret
out the secret heart of darkness in all the city's ways, and then at
dawn come back across the Bridge once more, and so to bed in
Brooklyn.</i></p>

<p><i>And in these nightly wanderings the old refusals dropped away,
the old avowals stood. For then, somehow, it seemed to him that he who
had been dead was risen, be who had been lost was found again, and be
who in his brief day of glory bad sold the talent, the passion, and the
belief of youth into the keeping of the fleshless dead, until his heart
was corrupted and all hope gone, would win his life back bloodily, in
solitude and darkness. And be felt then that things would be for him
once more as they had been, and he saw again, as be bad once seen, the
image of the shining city. Far-flung, and blazing into into tiers of
jewelled light, it burned forever in his vision as he walked the
Bridge, and strong tides were bound round it, and the great ships
called. So he walked the Bridge, always be walked the Bridge.</i></p>

<p><i>And by his side was that stern friend, the only one to whom be
spoke what in his secret heart he most desired. To Loneliness he
whispered: "Fame!"--and Loneliness replied: "Aye, brother, wait and
see."</i></p>

<h2><a name="chapter4-27"></a>27. The Locusts Have No King</h2>

<p>The tragic light of evening falls upon the huge and rusty jungle of
South Brooklyn. It falls without glare or warmth upon the faces of all
the men with dead eyes and flesh of tallow-grey as they lean upon their
window-sills at the sad, hushed end of day.</p>

<p>If at such a time you walk down this narrow street, between the mean
and shabby houses, past the eyes of all the men who lean there quietly
at their open windows in their shirt-sleeves, and turn in at the alley
here and follow the two-foot strip of broken concrete pavement that
skirts the alley on one side, and go to the very last shabby house down
at the end, and climb up the flight of worn steps to the front entrance
and knock loudly at the door with your bare knuckles (the bell is out
of order) and then wait patiently until someone comes, and ask whether
Mr. George Webber lives here, you will be informed that he most
certainly does, and that if you will just come in and go down this
stairway to the basement and knock at the door there on your right, you
will probably find him in. So you go down the stairway to the damp and
gloomy basement hall, thread your way between the dusty old boxes,
derelict furniture, and other lumber stored there in the passage, rap
on the door that has been indicated to you, and Mr. Webber himself will
open it and usher you right into his room, his home, his castle.</p>

<p>The place may seem to you more like a dungeon than a room that a man
would voluntarily elect to live in. It is long and narrow, running
parallel to the hall from front to rear, and the only natural light
that enters it comes through two small windows rather high up in the
wall, facing each other at the opposite ends, and these are heavily
guarded with iron bars, placed there by some past owner of the house to
keep the South Brooklyn thugs from breaking in.</p>

<p>The room is furnished adequately but not so luxuriously as to
deprive it of a certain functional and Spartan simplicity. In the back
half there is an iron bed with sagging springs, a broken-down dresser
with a cracked mirror above it, two kitchen chairs, and a steamer trunk
and some old suitcases that have seen much use. At the front end, under
the yellow glow of an electric light suspended from the ceiling by a
cord, there is a large desk, very much scarred and battered, with the
handles missing on most of the drawers, and in front of it there is a
straight-backed chair made out of some old, dark wood. In the centre,
ranged against the walls, where they serve to draw the two ends of the
room together into aesthetic unity, stand an ancient gate-legged table,
so much of its dark green paint flaked off that the dainty pink
complexion of its forgotten youth shows through all over, a tier of
book-shelves, unpainted, and two large crates or packing-cases, their
thick top boards pried off to reveal great stacks of ledgers and of
white and yellow manuscript within. On top of the desk, on the table,
on the book-shelves, and all over the floor are scattered, like fallen
leaves in autumn woods, immense masses of loose paper with writing on
every sheet, and everywhere are books, piled up on their sides or
leaning crazily against each other.</p>

<p>This dark cellar is George Webber's abode and working quarters.
Here, in winter, the walls, which sink four feet below the level of the
ground, sweat continuously with clammy drops of water. Here, in summer,
it is he who does the sweating.</p>

<p>His neighbours, he will tell you, are for the most part Armenians,
Italians, Spaniards, Irishmen, and Jews--in short, Americans. They live
in all the shacks, tenements, and slums in all the raw, rusty streets
and alleys of South Brooklyn.</p>

<p>And what is that you smell?</p>

<p>Oh, that! Well, you see, he shares impartially with his neighbours a
piece of public property in the vicinity; it belongs to all of them in
common, and it gives to South Brooklyn its own distinctive atmosphere.
It is the old Gowanus Canal, and that aroma you speak of is nothing but
the huge symphonic stink of it, cunningly compacted of unnumbered
separate putrefactions. It is interesting sometimes to try to count
them. There is in it not only the noisome stenches of a stagnant sewer,
but also the smells of melted glue, burned rubber, and smouldering
rags, the odours of a boneyard horse, long dead, the incense of
putrefying offal, the fragrance of deceased, decaying cats, old
tomatoes, rotten cabbage, and prehistoric eggs.</p>

<p>And how does he stand it?</p>

<p>Well, one gets used to it. One can get used to anything, just as all
these other people do. They never think of the smell, they never speak
of it, they'd probably miss it if they moved away.</p>

<p>To this place, then, George Webber has come, and here "holed in"
with a kind of dogged stubbornness touched with desperation. And you
will not be far wrong if you surmise that he has come here
deliberately, driven by a resolution to seek out the most forlorn and
isolated hiding spot that he could find.</p>

<hr align="center" width="15%">
<p>Mr. Marple, a gentleman who has a room on the second floor, comes
stumbling down the darkened basement stairway with a bottle in his hand
and knocks upon George Webber's door.</p>

<p>"Come in!"</p>

<p>Mr. Marple comes in, introduces himself, does the right thing with
the bottle, sits down, and begins to make talk.</p>

<p>"Well, now, Mr. Webber, how d'yah like that drink I mixed for
yah?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I like it, I like it."</p>

<p>"Well, now, if yah don't, I want yah t'come right out an' say
so."</p>

<p>"Oh, I would, I would."</p>

<p>"I mean I'd like to know. I'd appreciate yah tellin' me. What I mean
is, I made that stuff myself from a little private formuler I got--I
wouldn't buy no stuff from a bootlegger--I wouldn't take no chance wit'
the bastards. I buy the alcohol that goes into that drink from a place
I know, an' I always know what I'm gettin'--d'yah know what I
mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I certainly do."</p>

<p>"But I'd like to know what yah think of it, I'd appreciate yah
tellin' me."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's fine, it couldn't be better."</p>

<p>"I'm glad yah like it, an' you're sure I didn't disturb yah?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, not at all."</p>

<p>"Because I was on my way in when I sees your light there in the
winder, so I says to myself, now that guy may think I've got an orful
nerve buttin' in like this but I'm gonna stop an' get acquainted an'
ast him if he'd like a little drink."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you did."</p>

<p>"But if I disturbed yah I wantcha t'say so."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, not at all."</p>

<p>"Because here's the way it is wit' me. I'm interested in youman
nature--I'm a great student of psychology--I can read faces the minute
I look at a guy--it's somethin' that I always had--I guess that's why
I'm in the insurance game. So when I sees a guy that interests me I
wanta get acquainted wit' him an' get his reactions to things. So when
I sees your light I says to myself, he may tell me to get the hell outa
there but there ain't no harm in tryin'."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you did."</p>

<p>"Now Mr. Webber, I think I'm a pretty good judge of
character----"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sure you are."</p>

<p>"--an' I been lookin' at yah an' sorta sizin' yah up while yah been
sittin' there. Yah didn't know I was sizin' yah up but that's what I
been doin' all the time yah been sittin' there because I'm a great
student of youman nature, Mr. Webber, an' I gotta size up all grades
an' classes every day in my business--<i>you</i> know--I'm in the
insurance game. An' I wanna ast yah a question. Now if it's too
personal I wantcha t'come right out an' say so, but if yah don't mind
answerin' I'm gonna ast it to yah."</p>

<p>"Not at all. What is it?"</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Webber, I already reached my own conclusions, but I'm
gonna ast it to yah just t'see if it don't bear me out. Now what I'm
gonna ast yah--an' yah don't have to answer if yah don't want
to--is--What's your line?--What business are yah in? Now yah don't need
to tell me if it's too personal."</p>

<p>"Not at all. I'm a writer."</p>

<p>"A <i>what?</i>"</p>

<p>"A writer. I wrote a book once. I'm trying to write another one
now."</p>

<p>"Well now, it may surprise yah but that's just what I figgered out
myself. I says to myself, now there's a guy, I says, that's in some
kind of intelleckshul work where he's got t'use his head. He's a writer
or a newspaperman or in the advertisin' business. Y'see I've always
been a great judge of youman nature--that's <i>my</i> line."</p>

<p>"Yes, I see."</p>

<p>"An' now I wanna tell yah somethin' else, Mr. Webber. You're doin'
the thing yah was cut out for, you're doin' the thing yah was born to
do, it's what yah been preparin' to do all your life sinct yah was a
kid--am I right or wrong?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I guess you're right."</p>

<p>"An' that's the reason you're gonna be a big success at it. Stick to
writin', Mr. Webber. I'm a great judge of youman nature an' I know what
I'm talkin' about. Just stick to the thing yah always wanted to be an'
yah'll get there. Now some guys never find theirselves. Some guys never
know what they wanna be. That's the trouble wit' some guys. Now wit' me
it's different. I didn't find myself till I was a grown man. You'd have
t'laugh, Mr. Webber, if I told yah what it was I wanted t'be when I was
a kid."</p>

<p>"What was it, Mr. Marple?"</p>

<p>"Say, Mr. Webber--y'know it's funny--yah won't believe me--but up to
the time I was about twenty years old, a grown man, I was crazy to be a
railway engineer. No kiddin'. I was nuts about it. An' I'd a-been just
crazy enough to've gone ahead an' got a job on the railway if the old
man hadn't yanked me by the collar an' told me t'snap out of it. Yah
know I'm a Down-Easter by birth--don't talk like it any more--I been
here too long--but that's where I grew up. My old man was a plumber in
Augusta, Maine. So when I tells him I'm gonna be a locomotive engineer
he boots me one in the seat of the pants an' tells me I ain't no such
thing. 'I've sent yah to school,' he says, 'you've had ten times the
schoolin' that I had, an' now yah tell me that you're gonna be a
railway hogger. Well, you're not,' the old man says, 'you're gonna be
one member of the fambly that's comin' home at night wit' clean hands
an' a white collar. Now you get the hell outa here an' hunt yah up a
job in some decent high-class business where yah'll have a chanct
t'advance an' associate wit' your social ekals.' Jesus! It was a lucky
thing for me he took that stand or I'd never a-got where I am to-day.
But I was good an' sore about it at the time. An' say, Mr.
Webber--you're gonna laugh when I tell yah this one--I ain't actually
over the darn thing yet. No kiddin'. When I see one of these big
engines bargin' down the track I still get that funny crawly feelin' I
usta have when I was a kid an' looked at 'em. The guys at the office
had t'laugh about it when I told 'em, an' now when I come in they call
me Casey Jones.--Well, what d'yah say yah have another little snifter
before I go?"</p>

<p>"Thanks, I'd like to, but maybe I'd better not. I've still got a
little work I ought to do before I turn in."</p>

<p>"Well now, Mr. Webber, I know just how it is. An' that's the way I
had yah sized up from the first. That guy's a writer, I says, or in
some sort of intelleckshul occupation where he's got to use his
head--was I right or wrong?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you were right."</p>

<p>"Wel!, I'm glad to've metcha, Mr. Webber. Don't make yourself a
stranger round here. Yah know, a guy gets sorta lonely sometimes. My
wife died four years ago so I been livin' upstairs here ever
sinct--sorta figgered that a single guy didn't need no more room than I
got here. Come up to see me. I'm interested in youman nature an' 1 like
to talk to people an' get their different reactions. So any time yah
feel like chewin' the rag a bit, drop in."</p>

<p>"Oh, I will, I will."</p>

<p>"Good night, Mr. Webber."</p>

<p>"Good night, Mr. Marple."</p>

<p>Good night. Good night. Good night.</p>

<p>Across the basement hall, in another room similar to George
Webber's, lived an old man by the name of Wakefield. He had a son
somewhere in New York who paid his rent, but Mr. Wakefield rarely saw
his son. He was a brisk and birdy little man with a chirping, cheerful
voice; and, although he was almost ninety, he always seemed to be in
good health and was still immensely active. His son had provided him
with a room to live in, and he had a little money of his own--a few
dollars a month from a pension--enough to supply his meagre wants; but
he lived a life of utter loneliness, seeing his son only on the
occasion of a holiday or a rare visit, and the rest of the time living
all by himself in his basement room.</p>

<p>Yet he had as brave and proud a spirit as any man on earth. He
longed desperately for companionship, but he would have died rather
than admit he was lonely. So independent was he, and so sensitive,
that, while he was always courteous and cheerful, his tone when he
responded to a greeting was a little cold and distant, lest anyone
should think he was too forward and eager. But, once satisfied of one's
friendliness, no one could respond more warmly or more cordially than
old man Wakefield.</p>

<p>George grew fond of him and liked to talk with him, and the old man
would invite him eagerly into his part of the basement and proudly
display his room, which he kept with a soldierlike neatness. He was a
veteran of the Union Army in the Civil War, and his room was filled
with books, records, papers, and old clippings bearing on the war and
on the part his regiment had played in it. Although he was alert and
eager towards the life round him, and much too brave and hopeful a
spirit to live mournfully in the past, the Civil War had been the great
and central event in old man Wakefield's life. Like many of the men of
his generation, both North and South, it had never occurred to him that
the war was not the central event in everyone's life. Because it was so
with him, he believed that people everywhere still lived and thought
and talked about the war all the time.</p>

<p>He was a leading figure in the activities of his Grand Army Post,
and was always bustling about with plans and projects for the coming
year. It seemed to him that the Grand Army organisation, whose thinning
ranks of old and feeble men he still saw with the proud eyes of forty
or fifty years before, was the most powerful society in the nation, and
that its word of warning or stern reproof was enough to make all the
kings of the earth quake and tremble in their boots. He was bitterly
scornful and would bristle up immediately at mention of the American
Legion: he fancied slights and cunning trickery on the part of this
body all the time, and he would ruffle up like a rooster when he spoke
of the Legionnaires, and say in an angry, chirping voice:</p>

<p>"It's jealousy! Nothing in the world but sheer tar-nation
<i>jealousy</i>--that's what it is!"</p>

<p>"But why, Mr. Wakefield? Why should they be jealous of you?"</p>

<p>"Because we reely did some soldierin'--that's why!" he chirped
angrily. "Because they know we fit the Rebels--yes! and <i>fit</i> 'em
good--and <i>licked</i> 'em, too!" he cackled triumphantly--"in a war
that <i>was</i> a war!...Pshaw!" he said scornfully, in a lowered
voice, looking out the window with a bitter smile and with eyes that
had suddenly grown misty. "What do these fellows know about a
war?--Some <i>bob-tail--raggedy--two-by-two</i>--little <i>jackleg</i>
feller--of a <i>Legionnary!</i>" He spat the words out with a malignant
satisfaction, breaking at the end into a vindictive cackle. "Standin'
to their necks all day in some old trench and never gettin' within ten
miles of the enemy!" he sneered. "If they ever saw a troop of cavalry,
I don't know what they'd make of it! I reckon they'd think it was the
circus come to town!" he cackled. "A war! A <i>war!</i> Hell-fire, that
warn't no war!" he cried derisively. "If they wanted to see a war, they
should've been with us at the Bloody Angle! But, pshaw!" he said.
"They'd a-run like rabbits if they'd been there! The only way you could
a-kept 'em would've been to tie 'em to a tree!"</p>

<p>"Don't you think they could have beaten the Rebels, Mr.
Wakefield?"</p>

<p>"Beat 'em?" he shrilled. "<i>Beat</i> 'em! Why, boy, what are you
talkin' about?...Hell! If Stonewall Jackson ever started for that gang,
he'd run 'em ragged! Yes, sir! They'd light out so fast they'd
straighten out all the bends of the road as they went by!" cried old
man Wakefield, cackling. "Pshaw!" he said quietly and scornfully again.
"They couldn't do it! It ain't in 'em!...But I'll tell you this much!"
he cried suddenly in an excited voice. "We're not goin' to put up with
it much longer! The boys have had just about as much of it as they can
stand! If they try to do us like they done last year--pshaw!" he broke
off again, and looked out the window shaking his head--"Why it's all as
plain as the nose on your face! It's jealousy--just plain, confounded
<i>jealousy</i>--that's all in the world it is!"</p>

<p>"What is, Mr. Wakefield?"</p>

<p>"Why, the way they done us last year!" he cried. "Puttin' us way
back there at the tail-end of the <i>pee</i>-rade, when by all the
rights--as everybody knows--we should've come first! But we'll fix
'em!" he cried warningly. "We've got a way to fix 'em!" he said with a
triumphant shake of the head. "I know the thing we're goin' to do
<i>this</i> year," he cried, "if they try another trick like that on
us!"</p>

<p>"What are you going to do, Mr. Wakefield?"</p>

<p>"Why," he cackled, "we won't <i>pee</i>-rade! We simply won't
<i>pee</i>-rade! We'll tell 'em they can hold their derned
<i>pee</i>-rade without us!" he chirped exultantly. "And I reckon
that'll fix 'em! Oh yes! That'll bring 'em round, or I miss <i>my</i>
guess!" he crowed.</p>

<p>"It ought to, Mr. Wakefield."</p>

<p>"Why, boy," he said solemnly, "if we ever did a thing like that,
there would be a wave of protest--a <i>wave</i> of protest"--he cried
with a sweeping gesture of the arm, as his voice rose strongly--"from
here to Californy!...The people wouldn't <i>stand</i> for it!" he
cried. "They'd make <i>those</i> fellers back down in a hurry!"</p>

<p>And as George left him, the old man would come with him to the door,
shake his hand warmly and, with an eager and lonely look in his old
eyes, say:</p>

<p>"Come again, boy! I'm always glad to see you!...I got stuff in
here--photygraphs an' books, an' such as that about the war--that you
ain't seen yet. No, nor no one else!" he cackled. "For no one else has
got 'em!...Just let me know when you're comin' an' I'll be here."</p>

<p>Slowly the years crept by and George lived alone in Brooklyn. They
were hard years, desperate years, lonely years, years of interminable
writing and experimentation, years of exploration and discovery, years
of grey timelessness, weariness, exhaustion, and self-doubt. He had
reached the wilderness period of his life and was hacking his way
through the jungles of experience. He had stripped himself down to the
brutal facts of self and work. These were all he had.</p>

<p>He saw himself more clearly now than he had ever done before, and,
in spite of living thus alone, he no longer thought of himself as a
rare and special person who was doomed to isolation, but as a man who
worked and who, like other men, was a part of life. He was concerned
passionately with reality. He wanted to see things whole, to find out
everything he could, and then to create out of what he knew the fruit
of his own vision.</p>

<p>One criticism that had been made of his first book still rankled in
his mind. An unsuccessful scribbler turned critic had simply dismissed
the whole book as a "barbaric yawp", accusing Webber of getting at
things with his emotions rather than with his brains, and of being
hostile towards the processes of the intellect and "the intellectual
point of view." These charges, if they had any truth in them, seemed to
George to be the kind of lifeless half-truth that was worse than no
truth at all. The trouble with the so-called "intellectuals" was that
they were not intellectual enough, and their point of view more often
than not had no point, but was disparate, arbitrary, sporadic, and
confused.</p>

<p>To be an "intellectual" was, it seemed, a vastly different thing
from being intelligent. A dog's nose would usually lead him towards
what he wished to find, or away from what he wished to avoid: this was
intelligent. That is, the dog had the sense of reality in his nose. But
the "intellectual" usually had no nose, and was lacking in the sense of
reality. The most striking difference between Webber's mind and the
mind of the average "intellectual" was that Webber absorbed experience
like a sponge, and made use of everything that he absorbed. He really
learned constantly from experience. But the "intellectuals" of his
acquaintance seemed to learn nothing. They had no capacity for
rumination and digestion. They could not reflect.</p>

<p>He thought over a few of them that he had known:</p>

<p>There was Haythorpe, who when George first knew him was an esthete
of the late baroque in painting, writing all the arts, author of
one-act costume plays--"Gesmonder! Thy hands pale chalices of hot
desire!" Later he became an esthete of the primitives--the Greek,
Italian, and the German; then esthete of the nigger cults--the wood
sculptures, coon songs, hymnals, dances, and the rest; still later,
esthete of the comics--of cartoons, Chaplin, and the Brothers Marx;
then of Expressionism; then of the Mass; then of Russia and the
Revolution; at length, esthete of homo-sexuality; and finally, death's
esthete--suicide in a graveyard in Connecticut.</p>

<p>There was Collingswood, who, fresh out of Harvard, was not so much
the esthete of the arts as of the mind. First, a Bolshevik from Beacon
Hill, practitioner of promiscuous, communal love as the necessary
answer to "bourgeois morality"; then back to Cambridge for
post-graduate study at the feet of Irving Babbitt--Collingswood is now
a Humanist, the bitter enemy of Rousseau, Romanticism, and of Russia
(which is, he now thinks, Rousseau in modern form); the playwright,
next--New Jersey, Beacon Hill, or Central Park seen in the classic
unities of the Greek drama; at length, disgusted realist--"all that's
good in modern art or letters is to be found in advertisements"; then a
job as a scenario writer and two years in Hollywood--all now is the
moving picture, with easy money, easy love affairs, and drunkenness;
and finally, back to Russia, but with his first love lacking--no sex
triflings now, my comrades--we who serve the Cause and wait upon the
day lead lives of Spartan abstinence--what was the free life, free
love, enlightened pleasure of the proletariat ten years ago is now
despised as the contemptible debauchery of "bourgeois decadence".</p>

<p>There was Spurgeon from the teaching days at the School for Utility
Cultures--good Spurgeon--Chester Spurgeon of the Ph.D.--Spurgeon of
"the great tradition"--thin-lipped Spurgeon, ex-student of Professor
Stuart Sherman, and bearer-onwards of the Master's Torch. Noble-hearted
Spurgeon, who wrote honeyed flatteries of Thornton Wilder and his
<i>Bridge</i>--"The tradition of the Bridge is Love, just as the
tradition of America and of Democracy is Love. Hence"--Spurgeon
hences--Love grows Wilder as the years Bridge on across America. Oh,
where now, good Spurgeon, "intellectual" Spurgeon--Spurgeon whose thin
lips and narrowed eyes were always so glacial prim on Definitions?
Where now, brave intellect, by passion uninflamed? Spurgeon of the
flashing mind, by emotion unimpulsed, is now a devoted leader of the
intellectual Communists (See Spurgeon's article entitled: "Mr. Wilder's
Piffle", in the <i>New Masses</i>).--So, Comrade Spurgeon, hail! Hail,
Comrade Spurgeon--and most heartily, my bright-eyed Intellectual,
farewell!</p>

<p>Whatever George Webber was, he knew he was not an "intellectual". He
was just an American who was looking hard at the life round him, and
sorting carefully through all the life he had ever seen and known, and
trying to extract some essential truth out of this welter of his whole
experience. But, as he said to his friend and editor, Fox Edwards:</p>

<p>"What <i>is</i> truth? No wonder jesting Pilate turned away. The
truth, it has a thousand faces--show only one of them, and the
<i>whole</i> truth flies away! But how to show the whole? That's the
question...</p>

<p>"Discovery in itself is not enough. It's not enough to find out what
things are. You've also got to find out where they come from, where
each brick fits in the wall."</p>

<p>He always came back to the wall.</p>

<p>"I think it's like this," he said. "You see a wall, you look at it
so much and so hard that one day you see clear through it. Then, of
course, it's not just one wall any longer. It's every wall that ever
was."</p>

<p>He was still spiritually fighting out the battle of his first book,
and all the problems it had raised. He was still searching for a way.
At times he felt that his first book had taught him nothing--not even
confidence. His feelings of hollow desperation and self-doubt seemed to
grow worse instead of better, for he had now torn himself free from
almost every personal tie which had ever bound him, and which formerly
had sustained him in some degree with encouragement and faith. He was
left, therefore, to rely almost completely on his own resources.</p>

<p>There was also the insistent, gnawing consciousness of work itself,
the necessity of turning towards the future and the completion of a new
book. He was feeling, now as never before, the inexorable pressure of
time. In writing his first book, he had been unknown And obscure, and
there had been a certain fortifying strength in that, for no one had
expected anything of him. But now the spotlight of publication had been
turned upon him, and he felt it beating down with merciless intensity.
He was pinned beneath the light--he could not crawl out of it. Though
he had not won fame, still he was known now. He had been examined,
probed, and talked about. He felt that the world was looking at him
with a critic eye.</p>

<p>It had been easy in his dreams to envision a long and fluent
sequence of big books, but now he was finding it a different matter to
accomplish them. His first book had been more an act of utterance than
an act of labour. It was an impassioned expletive of youth--something
that had been pent up in him, something felt and seen and imagined and
put down at white-hot heat. The writing of it had been a process of
spiritual and emotional evacuation. But that was behind him now, and he
knew he should never try to repeat it. Henceforth his writing would
have to come from unending labour and preparation.</p>

<p>In his effort to explore his experience, to extract the whole,
essential truth of it, and to find a way to write about it, he sought
to recapture every particle of the life he knew down to its minutest
details. He spent weeks and months trying to put down on paper the
exactitudes of countless fragments--what he called: "the dry, caked
colours of America"--how the entrance to a subway looked, the design
and webbing of the elevated structure, the look and feel of an iron
rail, the particular shade of rusty green with which so many things are
painted in America. Then he tried to pin down the foggy colour of the
brick of which so much of London is constructed, the look of an English
doorway, of a French window, of the roofs and chimney-pots of Paris, of
a whole street in Munich--and each of these foreign things he then
examined in contrast to its American equivalent.</p>

<p>It was a process of discovery in its most naked, literal, and
primitive terms. He was just beginning really to see thousands of
things for the first time, to see the relations between them, to see
here and there whole series and systems of relations. He was like a
scientist in some new field of chemistry who for the first time
realises that he has stumbled upon a vast new world, and who will then
pick out identities, establish affiliations, define here and there the
outlines of sub-systems in crystalline union, without yet being aware
what the structure of the whole is like, or what the final end will
be.</p>

<p>The same processes now began to inform his direct observation of the
life round him. Thus, on his nocturnal ramblings about New York, he
would observe the homeless men who prowled in the vicinity of
restaurants, lifting the lids of garbage cans and searching round
inside for morsels of rotten food. He saw them everywhere, and noticed
how their numbers increased during the hard and desperate days of 1932.
He knew what kind of men they were, for he talked to many of them; he
knew what they had been, where they had come from, and even what kind
of scraps they could expect to dig out of the garbage cans. He found
out the various places all over the city where such men slept at night.
A favourite rendezvous was a corridor of the subway station at
Thirty-third Street and Park Avenue in Manhattan. There one night he
counted thirty-four huddled together on the cold concrete, wrapped up
in sheathings of old newspaper.</p>

<p>It was his custom almost every night, at one o'clock or later, to
walk across the Brooklyn Bridge, and night after night, with a horrible
fascination, he used to go to the public latrine or "comfort station"
which was directly in front of the New York City Hall. One descended to
this place down a steep flight of stairs from the street, and on bitter
nights he would find the place crowded with homeless men who had sought
refuge there. Some were those shambling hulks that one sees everywhere,
in Paris as well as New York, in good times as well as bad--old men,
all rags and bags and long white hair and bushy beards stained dirty
yellow, wearing tattered overcoats in the cavernous pockets of which
they carefully stored away all the little rubbish they lived on and
spent their days collecting in the streets--crusts of bread, old bones
with rancid shreds of meat still clinging to them, and dozens of
cigarette-butts. Some were the "stumble bums" from the Bowery,
criminal, fumed with drink or drugs, or half insane with "smoke". But
most of them were just flotsam of the general ruin of the time--honest,
decent, middle-aged men with faces seamed by toil and want, and young
men, many of them mere boys in their teens, with thick, unkempt hair.
These were the wanderers from town to town, the riders of freight
trains, the thumbers of rides on highways, the uprooted, unwanted male
population of America. They drifted across the land and gathered in the
big cities when winter came, hungry, defeated, empty, hopeless,
restless, driven by they knew not what, always on the move, looking
everywhere for work, for the bare crumbs to support their miserable
lives, and finding neither work nor crumbs. Here in New York, to this
obscene meeting-place, these derelicts came, drawn into a common stew
of rest and warmth and a little surcease from their desperation.</p>

<p>George had never before witnessed anything to equal the indignity
and sheer animal horror of the scene. There was even a kind of devil's
comedy in the sight of all these filthy men squatting upon those open,
doorless stools. Arguments and savage disputes and fights would
sometimes break out among them over the possession of these stools,
which all of them wanted more for rest than for necessity. The sight
was revolting, disgusting, enough to render a man forever speechless
with very pity.</p>

<p>He would talk to the men and find out all he could about them, and
when he could stand it no more he would come out of this hole of filth
and suffering, and there, twenty feet above it, he would see the giant
hackles of Manhattan shining coldly in the cruel brightness of the
winter night. The Woolworth Building was not fifty yards away, and, a
little farther down were the silvery spires and needles of Wall Street,
great fortresses of stone and steel that housed enormous hanks. The
blind injustice of this contrast seemed the most brutal part of the
whole experience, for there, all round him in the cold moonlight, only
a few blocks away from this abyss of human wretchedness and misery,
blazed the pinnacle of power where a large portion of the entire
world's wealth was locked in mighty vaults.</p>

<p>They were now dosing up the restaurant. The tired waitresses were
racking the chairs upon the tables, completing the last formalities of
their hard day's work in preparation for departure. At the cash
register the proprietor was totting up the figures of the day's take,
and one of the male waiters hovered watchfully near the table, in a
manner politely indicating that while he was not in a hurry he would be
glad if the last customer would pay his bill and leave.</p>

<p>George called for his check and gave the man some money. He took it
and in a moment returned with the change. He pocketed his tip and said:
"Thank you, sir." Then as George said good night and started to get up
and leave, the waiter hesitated and hung round uncertainly as if there
was something he wanted to say but scarcely knew whether he ought to
say it or not.</p>

<p>George looked at him inquiringly, and then, in a rather embarrassed
tone, the waiter said:</p>

<p>"Mr. Webber...there's...something I'd like to talk over with you
sometime...I--I'd like to get your advice about something--that is, if
you have time," he added hastily and almost apologetically.</p>

<p>George regarded the waiter with another inquiring look,-in which the
man evidently read encouragement, for now he went on quickly, in a
manner of almost beseeching entreaty:</p>

<p>"It's--it's about a story."</p>

<p>The familiar phrase awakened countless weary echoes in Webber's
memory. It also resolved that hard and honest patience with which any
man who ever sweated to write a living line and to earn his bread by
the hard, uncertain labour of his pen will listen, as an act of duty
and understanding, to any other man who says he has a tale to tell. His
mind and will wearily composed themselves, his face set in a strained
smile of mechanical anticipation, and the poor waiter, thus encouraged,
went on eagerly:</p>

<p>"It's--it's a story a guy told me several years ago. I've been
thinking about it ever since. The guy was a foreigner," said the waiter
impressively, as if this fact was enough to guarantee the rare colour
and fascinating interest of what he was about to reveal. "He was an
Armenian," said the waiter very earnestly. "Sure! He came from over
there!" He nodded his head emphatically. "And this story that he told
me was an <i>Armenian</i> story," said the waiter with solemn emphasis,
and then paused to let this impressive fact sink in. "It was a story
that he knew about--he told it to me--and I'm the only other guy that
knows about it," said the waiter, and paused again, looking at his
patron with a very bright and feverish eye.</p>

<p>George continued to smile with wan encouragement, and in a moment
the waiter, after an obvious struggle with his soul, a conflict between
his desire to keep his secret and to tell it, too, went on:</p>

<p>"Gee! You're a writer, Mr. Webber, and you know about these things.
I'm just a dumb guy working in a restaurant--but if I could put it into
words--if I could get a guy like you who knows how it's done to tell
the story for me--why--why"--he struggled with himself, then burst out
enthusiastically--"there'd be a fortune in it for the both of us!"</p>

<p>George felt his heart sink still lower. It was turning out just as
he knew it would. But he still continued to smile pallidly. He cleared
his throat in an undecided fashion, but then said nothing. And the
waiter, taking silence for consent, now pressed on impetuously:</p>

<p>"Honest, Mr. Webber--if I could get somebody like you to help me
with this story--to write it down for me the way it ought to
be-I'd--I'd"--for a moment the waiter struggled with his lower nature,
then magnanimity got the better of him and he cried out with t he
decided air of a man who is willing to make a generous bargain and
stick to it--"I'd go fifty-fifty with him! I'd--I'd be willing to give
him half!...And there's a fortune in it!" he cried. "I go to the movies
and I read <i>True Story Magazine</i>--and I never seen a story like
it! It's got 'em all beat! I've thought about it for years, ever since
the guy told it to me--and I know I've got a gold mine here if I could
only write it down!...It's--it's----"</p>

<p>Now, indeed, the waiter's struggle with his sense of caution became
painful to watch. He was evidently burning with a passionate desire to
reveal his secret, but he was also obviously tormented by doubts and
misgivings lest he should recklessly give away to a comparative
stranger a treasure which the other might appropriate to his own use. I
I is manner was very much that of a man who has sailed strange seas and
seen, in some unknown coral island, the fabulous buried cache of
forgotten pirates' plundering, and who is now being torn between two
desperate needs--his need of partnership, of outward help, and his
imperative need of secrecy and caution. The fierce interplay of these
two powers discrete was waged there on the open battlefield of the
waiter's countenance. And in the end he took the obvious way out. Like
an explorer who will take from his pocket an uncut gem of tremendous
size and value and cunningly hint that in a certain place he knows of
there are many more like it, the waiter decided to tell a little part
of his story without revealing it.</p>

<p>"I--I can't tell you the whole thing to-night," he said
apologetically. "Some other night, maybe, when you've got more time.
But just to give you an idea of what's in it"--he looked round
stealthily to make sure he was in no danger of being overheard, then
bent over and lowered his voice to an impressive whisper--"just to give
you an idea, now--there's one scene in the story where a woman puts an
advertisement in the paper that she will give a ten-dollar gold piece
and as much liquor as he can drink to any man who comes round to see
her the next day!" After imparting this sensational bit of information,
the waiter regarded his patron with glittering eyes. "Now!" said the
waiter, straightening up with a gesture of finality. "You never heard
of anything like that, did you? You ain't never seen <i>that</i> in a
story!"</p>

<p>George, after a baffled pause, admitted feebly that he had not.
Then, when the waiter continued to regard him feverishly, with a look
that made it plain that he was supposed to say something more, he
inquired doubtfully whether this interesting event had really happened
in Armenia.</p>

<p>"Sure!" cried the waiter, nodding vigorously. "That's what I'm
telling you! The whole thing happens in Armenia!" He paused again, torn
fiercely between his caution and his desire to go on, his feverish eyes
almost burning holes through his questioner. "It's--it's--" he
struggled for a moment more, then surrendered; abjectly--"well, I'll
tell you," he said quietly, leaning forward, with his hands resting on
the table in an attitude of confidential intimacy. "The idea of the
story runs like this. You got this rich dame to begin with, see?"</p>

<p>He paused and looked at George inquiringly. George did not: know
what was expected of him, so he nodded to show that his min had grasped
this important fact, and said hesitatingly:</p>

<p>"In Armenia?"</p>

<p>"Sure! Sure!" The waiter nodded. "This dame comes from over
there--she's got a big pile of dough--I guess she's the richest dame in
Armenia. And then she falls for this guy, see?" he went on. "He's nuts
about her, and he comes to see her every night. The way the guy told it
to me, she lives up at the top of this big house--so every night the
guy comes and climbs up there to see her--oh, a hell of a long ways
up"--the waiter said--"thirty floors or more!"</p>

<p>"In Armenia?" George asked feebly.</p>

<p>"Sure!" cried the waiter, a little irritably. "That's where it all
takes place! That's what I'm telling you!"</p>

<p>He paused and looked searchingly at George, who finally asked, with
just the proper note of hesitant thoughtfulness, why the lover had had
to climb up so far.</p>

<p>"Why," said the waiter impatiently, "because the dame's old man
wouldn't let him in! That was the only way the guy could get to her!
The old man shut her up way up there at the top of the house because he
didn't want the dame to get married!...But then," he went on
triumphantly, "the old man dies, see? He dies and leaves all his dough
to this dame--and then she ups and marries this guy!"</p>

<p>Dramatically, with triumph written in his face, the waiter paused to
let this startling news soak into the consciousness of his listener.
Then he continued:</p>

<p>"They lived together for a while--the dame's in love with him--and
for a year or two they're sitting pretty. But then the guy begins to
drink--he's a booze hound, see?--only she don't know it--she's been
able to hold him down for a year or two after they get married...Then
he begins to step out again...The first thing you know he's staying out
all night and running round with a lot of hot blondes, see?...Well,
then, you see what's coming now, don't you?" said the waiter quickly
and eagerly.</p>

<p>George had no notion, but he nodded his head wisely.</p>

<p>"Well, that's what happens," said the waiter. "The first thing you
know the guy ups and leaves the dame and takes with him a lot of her
dough and joolry...He just disappears--just like the earth had opened
and swallowed him up!" the waiter declared, evidently pleased with his
poetic simile. "He leaves her cold, and the poor dame's almost out of
her head. She does everything--she hires detectives--she offers
rewards--she puts ads in the paper begging him to come back...But it's
no use--she can't find him--the guy's lost...Well, then," the waiter
continued, "three years go by while the poor dame sits and eats her
heart out about this guy...And then"--here he paused impressively, and
it was evident that he was now approaching the crisis--"then she has an
idea!" He paused again, briefly, to allow this extraordinary
accomplishment on the part of his heroine to be given due
consideration, and in a moment, very simply and quietly, he concluded:
"She opens up a night club."</p>

<p>The waiter fell silent now, and stood at ease with his hands clasped
quietly before him, with the modest air of a man who has given his all
and is reasonably assured it is enough. It now became compellingly
apparent that his listener was supposed to make some appropriate
comment, and that the narrator could not continue with his tale until
this word had been given. So George mustered his failing strength,
moistened his dry lips with the end of his tongue, and finally said in
a halting voice:</p>

<p>"In--in Armenia?"</p>

<p>The waiter now took the question, and the manner of its utterance,
as signs of his listener's paralyzed surprise. He nodded his head
victoriously and cried:</p>

<p>"Sure! You see, the dame's idea is this--she knows the guy's a booze
hound and that sooner or later he'll come to a place where there's lots
of bar-flies and fast women. That kind always hang together--sure they
do!...So she opens up this joint--she sinks a lot of dough in it--it's
the swellest joint they got over there. And then she puts this ad in
the paper."</p>

<p>George was not sure that he had heard aright, but the waiter was
looking at him with an expression of such exuberant elation that he
took a chance and said:</p>

<p>"What ad?"</p>

<p>"Why," said the waiter, "this come-on ad that I was telling you
about. You see, that's the big idea--that's the plan the dame dopes out
to get him back. So she puts this ad in the paper saying that any man
who comes to her joint the next day will be given a ten-dollar gold
piece and all the liquor he can drink. She figures that will bring him.
She knows the guy is probably down and out by this time and when he
reads this ad he'll show up...And that's just what happens. When she
comes down next morning she finds a line twelve blocks long outside,
and sure enough, here's this guy the first one in the line. Well, she
pulls him out of the line and tells the cashier to give all the rest of
'em their booze and their ten bucks, but she tells this guy he ain't
gonna get nothing. 'What's the reason I ain't?' he says--you see, the
dame is wearing a heavy veil so he don't recognise her. Well, she tells
him she thinks there's something phoney about him--gives him the old
line, you know--tells him to come upstairs with her so she can talk to
him and find out if he's O.K...Do you get it?"</p>

<p>George nodded vaguely. "And then what?" he said.</p>

<p>"Why," the waiter cried, "she gets him up there--and then"--he
leaned forward again with fingers resting on the table, and his voice
sank to an awed whisper--"<i>she--takes--off--her--veil!</i>"</p>

<p>There was a reverential silence as the waiter, still leaning forward
with his fingers arched upon the table, regarded his listener with
bright eyes and a strange little smile. Then he straightened up slowly,
stood erect, still smiling quietly, and a long, low sigh like the
coming on of evening came from his lips, and he was still. The silence
drew itself out until it became painful, and at length George squirmed
wretchedly in his chair and asked:</p>

<p>"And then--then what?"</p>

<p>The waiter was plainly taken aback. He stared in frank astonishment,
stunned speechless by the realisation that anybody could be stupid.</p>

<p>"Why"--he finally managed to say with an expression of utter
disillusion--"that's <i>all!</i> Don't you see? That's all there is!
The dame takes off her veil--he recognises her--and there you
are!...She's found him!...She's got him back!...They're together
again!...<i>That's</i> the story!" He was hurt, impatient, almost angry
as he went on: "Why, anybody ought to be able to see----"</p>

<p>"Good night, Joe."</p>

<p>The last waitress was just going out and had spoken to the waiter as
she passed the table. She was a blonde, slender girl, neatly dressed
Her voice was quiet and full of the casual familiarity of her daily
work and association; it was a pleasant voice, and it was a little
tired. Her face, as she paused a moment, was etched in light and
shadow, and there were little pools of violet beneath her clear grey
eyes. Her face had the masklike fragility and loveliness, the almost
hair-drawn fine-MSS, that one often sees in young people who have lived
in the great city and who have never had wholly enough of anything
except work and their own hard youth. One felt instantly sorry for the
girl, because one knew that her face would not long be what it was
now.</p>

<p>The waiter, interrupted in the flood of his impassioned argument,
had been alittle startled by the casual intrusion of the girl's low
voice turned towards her. When he saw who it was, his manner changed at
once, and his own seamed face softened a little with instinctive and
unconscious friendliness.</p>

<p>"Oh, hello, Billie. Good night, kid."</p>

<p>She went out, and the sound of her brisk little heels clacked away
on the hard pavement. For a moment more the waiter continued to look
after her, and then, turning back to his sole remaining customer with a
queer, indefinable little smile hovering in the hard lines about his
mouth, he said very quietly and casually, in the tone men use to speak
of things done and known and irrecoverable:</p>

<p>"Did you see that kid?...She came in here about two years ago and
got a job. I don't know where she came from, but it was some little
hick town somewhere. She'd been a chorus girl--a hoofer in some cheap
road show--until her legs gave out...You find a lot of 'em in this
game--the business is full of 'em...Well, she worked here for about a
year, and then she began going with a cheap gigolo who used to come in
here. You know the kind--you can smell 'em a mile off--they stink. I
could've told her! But, hell, what's the use? They won't listen to
you--you only get yourself in dutch all round--they got to find out for
themselves--you can't teach 'em. So I left it alone--that's the only
way...Well, six or eight months ago, some of the girls found out she
was pregnant. The boss let her out. He's not a bad guy--but, hell, what
can you expect? You can't keep 'em round a place like this when they're
in that condition, can you?...She had the kid three months ago, and
then she got her job back. I understand she's put the kid in a home
somewhere. I've never seen it, but they say it's a swell kid, and
Billie's crazy about it--goes out there to see it every Sunday...She's
a swell kid, too."</p>

<p>The waiter was silent for a moment, and there was a far-off look of
tragic but tranquil contemplation in his eyes. Then, quietly, wearily,
he said:</p>

<p>"Hell, if I could tell you what goes on here every day--the things
you see and hear--the people you meet and all that happens. Jesus, I
get sick and tired of it. Sometimes I'm so fed up with the whole thing
that I don't care if I never see the joint again. Sometimes I get to
thinking how swell it would be not to have to spend your whole life
waiting on a lot of mugs--just standing round and waiting on 'em and
watching 'em come in and out...and feeling sorry for some little kid
who's fallen for some dope you wouldn't wipe your feet on...and
wondering just how long it'll be before she gets the works...Jesus, I'm
fed up with it!"</p>

<p>Again he was silent. His eyes looked off into the distance, and his
face was set in that expression of mildly cynical regret and acceptance
that one often notices in people who have seen much of life, and
experienced its hard and seamy side, and who know that there is very
little they can do or say. At last he sighed deeply, shook himself,
threw off the mood, and resumed his normal manner.</p>

<p>"Gee, Mr. Webber," he said with a return of his former eagerness,
"it must be great to be able to write books and stories--to have the
gift of gab--all that flow of language--to go anywhere you like--to
work when you want to! Now, take that story I was telling you about,"
he said earnestly. "I never had no education--but if I could only get
some guy like you to help me--to write it down the way it ought to
be--honest, Mr. Webber, it's a great chance for somebody--there's a
fortune in it--I'd go fifty-fifty!" His voice was pleading now. "A guy
I knew one time, he told it to me--and me and him are the only two that
knows it. The guy was an Armenian, like I said, and the whole thing
happened over there...There'd be a gold mine in it if I only knew how
to do it."</p>

<p>It was long after midnight, and the round disc of the moon was
sinking westward over the cold, deserted streets of slumbering
Manhattan.</p>

<p>The party was in full swing now.</p>

<p>The gold and marble ballroom of the great hotel had been converted
into a sylvan fairyland. In the centre a fountain of classic nymphs and
fauns sent up its lighted sprays of water, and here and there about the
floor were rustic arbors with climbing roses trailing over them, heavy
with scented blossoms. Flowering hot-house trees in tubs were banked
round the walls, the shining marble pillars were wreathed about with
vines and garlands, and overhead gay lanterns had been strung to
illuminate the scene with their gentle glow. The whole effect was that
of an open clearing in a forest glade upon Midsummer Night where Queen
Titania had come to hold her court and revels.</p>

<p>It was a rare, exotic spectacle, a proper setting for the wealthy,
carefree youth for whom it had been planned. The air was heavy with the
fragrance of rich perfumes, and vibrant with the throbbing, pulsing
rhythms of sensuous music. Upon the polished floor a hundred lovely
girls in brilliant evening gowns danced languidly in the close embrace
of pink-cheeked boys from Yale and Harvard, their lithe young figures
accentuated smartly by the black and white of faultless tailoring.</p>

<p>This was the coming-out party of a fabulously rich young lady, and
the like of it had not been seen since the days before the market
crashed. The papers had been full of it for weeks. It was said that her
father had lost millions in the debacle, but it was apparent that he
still had a few paltry dollars left. So now he was doing the right
thing, the expected thing, the necessary and inescapable thing, for his
beautiful young daughter, who would one day inherit all that these
ruinous times had left him of his hard-earned savings. To-night she was
being "presented to Society" (whose members had known her since her
birth), and all "Society" was there.</p>

<p>And from this night on, the girl's smiling face would turn up with
monotonous regularity in all the rotogravure sections of the Sunday
papers, and daily the nation would be kept posted on all the momentous
trivia of her life--what she ate, what she wore, where she went, who
went with her, what night clubs had been honoured by her presence, what
fortunate young gentleman had been seen accompanying her to what race
track, and what benefits she had sponsored and poured tea for. For one
whole year, from now until another beautiful and rich young lady from
next season's crop of beautiful and rich young ladies was chosen by the
newspaper photographers to succeed her as America's leading debutante,
this gay and care-free creature would be for Americans very much what a
royal princess is for Englishmen, and for very much the same
reason--because she was her father's daughter, and because her father
was one of the rulers of America. Millions would read about her every
move and envy her, and thousands would copy her as far as their means
would let them. They would buy cheap imitations of her costly dresses,
hats, and underclothes, would smoke the same cigarettes, use the same
lipsticks, eat the same soups, sleep on the same mattresses that she
had allowed herself to be pictured wearing, smoking, using, eating, and
sleeping on in the handsome coloured advertisements on the back covers
of magazines--and they would do it, knowing full well that the rich
young lady had set these fashions for a price--was she not her father's
daughter?--all, of course, for the sake of sweet charity and
commerce.</p>

<p>Outside the great hotel, on the Avenue in front of it and on all the
side streets in the near vicinity, sleek black limousines were parked.
In some of them the chauffeurs slouched dozing behind their wheels.
Others had turned on their inside lights and sat there reading the
pages of the tabloids. But most of them had left their cars and were
knotted together in little groups, smoking, talking, idling the time
away until their services should be needed again.</p>

<p>On the pavement near the entrance of the hotel, beside the huge
marquee which offered shelter from the wind, the largest group of them,
neat in their liveried uniforms, had gathered in debate. They were
discussing politics and theories of international economy, and the
chief disputants were a plump Frenchman with a waxed moustache, whose
sentiments were decidedly revolutionary, and an American, a little man
with corky legs, a tough, seamed face, the beady eyes of a bird, and
the quick, impatient movements of the city. As George Webber came
abreast of them, brought thither by the simple chance of his nightly
wanderings, the argument had reached its furious climax, and he stopped
a while to listen.</p>

<p>The scene, the situation, and the contrast between the two principal
debaters made the whole affair seem utterly grotesque. The plump
Frenchman, his cheeks glowing with the cold and his own excitement, was
dancing about in a frenzy, talking and gesticulating volubly. He would
lean forward with thumb and forefinger uplifted and closed daintily in
a descriptive circle--a gesture that eloquently expressed the man's
conviction that the case he had been presenting for immediate and
bloody world revolution was complete, logical, unshakable, and beyond
appeal. When any of the others interposed an objection, he would only
grow more violent and inflamed.</p>

<p>At last his little English began to break down under the strain
imposed upon it. The air about him fairly rang with objurgations,
expletives, impassioned cries of "<i>Mais oui!...Absolument!...C'est la
v&eacute;rit&eacute;!</i>"--and with laughs of maddened exasperation,
as if the knowledge that anyone could be so obtuse as not to see it as
he saw it was more than he could endure.</p>

<p>"<i>Mais non! Mais non!</i>" he would shout. "<i>Vous avez
tort!...Mais c'est stupide!</i>" he would cry, throwing his plump arms
up in a gesture of defeat, and turning away as if he could stand it no
longer and was departing--only to return immediately and begin all over
again.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the chief target of this deluge, the little American with
the corky legs and the birdy eyes, let him go on. He just leaned up
against the building, took an occasional puff at his cigarette, and
gave the Frenchman a steady look of cynical impassivity. At last he
broke in to say:</p>

<p>"O.K...O.K., Frenchy...When you get through spoutin', maybe I'll
have somethin' to say."</p>

<p>"<i>Seulement un mot!</i>" replied the Frenchman, out of breath.
"One vord!" he cried impressively, drawing himself up to his full five
feet three and holding one finger in the air as if he were about to
deliver Holy Writ--"I 'ave to say one vord more!"</p>

<p>"O.K.! O.K.!" said the corky little American with cynical weariness.
"Only don't take more than an hour and a half to say it!"</p>

<p>Just then another chauffeur, obviously a German, with bright blue
eyes and a nut-cracker face, rejoined the group with an air of elated
discovery.</p>

<p>"Noos! I got noos for you!" he said. "I haf been mit a drifer who
hass in Rooshia liffed, and he says that conditions there far
<i>worser</i> are----"</p>

<p>"<i>Non! Non!</i>" the Frenchman shouted, red in the face with anger
and protest. "<i>Pas vrai!...Ce n'est par possible!</i>"</p>

<p>"Oh, for Christ's sake," the American said, tossing his cigarette
away with a gesture of impatience and disgust. "Why don't you guys wake
up? This ain't Russia! You're in America! The trouble with you guys,"
he went on, "is that you've been over there all your life where you
ain't been used to nothin'--and just as soon as you get over here where
you can live like a human bein' you want to tear it all down."</p>

<p>At this, others broke in, and the heated and confused dialogue
became more furious than ever. But the talk just went round and round
in circles.</p>

<p>George walked away into the night.</p>

<p>The lives of men who have to live in our great cities are often
tragically lonely. In many more ways than one, these dwellers in the
hive are modern counterparts of Tantalus. They are starving to death in
the midst of abundance. The crystal stream flows near the lips but
always falls away when they try to drink of it. The vine, rich-weighted
with its golden fruit, bends down, comes near, but springs back when
they reach to touch it.</p>

<p>Melville, at the beginning of his great fable, <i>Moby Dick</i>,
tells how the city people of his time would, on every occasion that was
afforded them, go down to the dock, to the very edges of the wharf, and
stand there looking out to sea. In the great city of to-day, however,
there is no sea to look out to, or, if there is, it is so far away, so
inaccessible, walled in behind such infinite ramifications of stone and
steel, that the effort to get to it is disheartening. So now, when the
city man looks out, he looks out on nothing but crowded vacancy.</p>

<p>Does this explain, perhaps, the desolate emptiness of city
youth--those straggling bands of boys of sixteen or eighteen that one
can always see at night or on a holiday, going along a street, filling
the air with raucous jargon and senseless cries, each trying to outdo
the others with joyless catcalls and mirthless quips and jokes which
are so feeble, so stupidly inane, that one hears them with strong mixed
feelings of pity and of shame? Where here, among these lads, is all the
merriment, high spirits, and spontaneous gaiety of youth? These
creatures, millions of them, seem to have been born but half-made up,
without innocence, born old and stale and dull and empty.</p>

<p>Who can wonder at it? For what a world it is that most of them were
born into! They were suckled on darkness, and weaned on violence and
noise. They had to try to draw out moisture from the cobble-stones,
their true parent was a city street, and in that barren universe no
urgent sails swelled out and leaned against the wind, they rarely knew
the feel of earth beneath their feet and no birds sang, t heir youthful
eyes grew hard, unseeing, from being stopped for ever by a wall of
masonry.</p>

<p>In other times, when painters tried to paint a scene of awful
desolation, they chose the desert or a heath of barren rocks, and there
would try to picture man in his great loneliness--the prophet in the
desert, Elijah being fed by ravens on the rocks. But for a modern
painter, the most desolate scene would be a street in almost any one of
our great cities on a Sunday afternoon.</p>

<p>Suppose a rather drab and shabby street in Brooklyn, not quite
tenement perhaps, and lacking therefore even the gaunt savagery of I
overty, but a street of cheap brick buildings, warehouses, and garages,
with a cigar store or a fruit stand or a barber shop on the corner.
Suppose a Sunday afternoon in March--bleak, empty, slaty grey. And
suppose a group of men, Americans of the working class, dressed in t
heir "good" Sunday clothes--the cheap machine-made suits, the new cheap
shoes, the cheap felt hats stamped out of universal grey. Just suppose
this, and nothing more. The men hang round the corner before the cigar
store or the closed barber shop, and now and then, through the bleak
and empty street, a motor-car goes flashing past, and in the distance
they hear the cold rumble of an elevated train. For hours they hang
round the corner, waiting--waiting--waiting----</p>

<p>For what?</p>

<p>Nothing. Nothing at all. And that is what gives the scene its
special quality of tragic loneliness, awful emptiness, and utter
desolation. Every modern city man is familiar with it. And yet--and
yet----</p>

<p>It is also true--and this is a curious paradox about America--that
these same men who stand upon the corner and wait around on Sunday
afternoons for nothing are filled at the same time with an almost
quenchless hope, an almost boundless optimism, an almost indestructible
belief that something is bound to turn up, something is sure to happen.
This is a peculiar quality of the American soul, and it contributes
largely to the strange enigma of our life, which is so incredibly mixed
of harshness and of tenderness, of innocence and of crime, of
loneliness and of good fellowship, of desolation and of exultant hope,
of terror and of courage, of nameless fear and of soaring conviction,
of brutal, empty, naked, bleak, corrosive ugliness, and of beauty so
lovely and so overwhelming that the tongue is stopped by it, and the
language for it has not yet been uttered.</p>

<p>How explain this nameless hope that seems to lack all reasonable
foundation? I cannot. But if you were to go up to this fairly
intelligent-looking truck-driver who stands and waits there with his
crowd, and if you put to him your question, and if he understood what
you were talking about (he wouldn't), and if he were articulate enough
to frame in words the feelings that are in him (he isn't)--he might
answer you with something such as this:</p>

<p>"Now is duh mont' of March, duh mont' of March--now it is Sunday
afternoon in Brooklyn in duh mont' of March, an' we stand upon cold
corners of duh day. It's funny dat dere are so many corners in duh
mont' of March, here in Brooklyn where no corners are. Jesus! On Sunday
in duh mont' of March we sleep late in duh mornin' den we get up an'
read duh papers--dub funnies an' duh sportin' news. We eat some chow.
An' den we dress up in duh afternoon, we leave our wives, we leave dub
funnies littered on duh floor, an' go outside in Brooklyn in duh mont'
of March an' stand around upon ten t'ousand corners of duh day. We need
a corner in, duh mont' of March, a wall to stand to, a shelter an' a
door. Dere must be some place inside in duh mont' of March, but we
never found it. So we stand around on corners where duh sky is cold an'
ragged still wit' winter, in our good clothes we stand around wit' a
lot of udder guys we know, before dub, barber shop, just lookin' for a
door."</p>

<p>Ah, yes, for in summer:</p>

<p>It is so cool and sweet to-night, a million feet are walking here
across the jungle web of Brooklyn in the dark, and it's so hard now to
remember that it ever was the month of March in Brooklyn and that we
couldn't find a door. There are so many million doors tonight. There's
a door for everyone to-night, all's open to the air, all's interfused
to-night: remote the thunder of the elevated trains on Fulton Street,
the rattling of the cars along Atlantic Avenue, the glare of Coney
Island seven miles away, the mob, the racket, and the barkers shouting,
the cars swift-shuttling through the quiet streets, the people swarming
in the web, lit here and there with livid blurs of light, the voices of
the neighbours leaning at their windows, harsh, soft, all interfused.
All's illusive in the liquid air to-night, all mixed in with the radios
that blare from open windows. And there is something over all to-night,
something fused, remote, and trembling, made of all of this, and yet
not of it, upon the huge and weaving ocean of the night in
Brooklyn--something that we had almost quite forgotten in the month of
March. What's this?--a sash raised gently?--a window?--a near voice on
the air?--something swift and passing, almost captured, there
below?--there in the gulf of night the mournful and yet thrilling
voices of the tugs?--the liner's blare? Herethere--some otherwhere--was
it a whisper?--a woman's call?--a sound of people talking behind the
screens and doors in Flatbush? It trembles in the air throughout the
giant web to-night, as fleeting as a step--near--as soft and sudden as
a woman's laugh. The liquid air is living with the very whisper of the
thing that we are looking for to-night throughout America--the very
thing that seemed so bleak, so vast, so cold, so hopeless, and so lost
as we waited in out good clothes on ten thousand corners of the day in
Brooklyn in the month of March.</p>

<p>If George Webber had never gone beyond the limits of the
neighbourhood in which he lived, the whole chronicle of the earth would
have been there for him just the same. South Brooklyn was a
universe.</p>

<p>The people in the houses all round him, whose lives in the cold, raw
days of winter always seemed hermetic, sterile, and remote, as shut out
from him as though they were something sealed up in a tin, became in
spring and summer so real to him it seemed that he had known them from
his birth. For, as the days and nights grew warmer, everybody kept
their windows open, and all the dwellers in these houses conducted
their most intimate affairs in loud and raucous voices which carried to
the street and made the casual passer-by a confidant of every family
secret.</p>

<p>God knows he saw squalor and filth and misery and despair enough,
violence and cruelty and hate enough, to crust his lips for ever with
the hard and acrid taste of desolation. He found a sinister and
demented Italian grocer whose thin mouth writhed in a servile smile as
he cringed before his customers, and the next moment was twisted in a
savage snarl as he dug his clawlike fingers into the arm of his
wretched little son. And on Saturdays the Irishmen would come home
drunk, and then would beat their wives and cut one another's throats,
and the whole course and progress of their murderous rages would be
published nakedly from their open windows with laugh, shout, scream,
and curse.</p>

<p>But he found beauty in South Brooklyn, too. There was a tree that
leaned over into the narrow alley where he lived, and George could
stand at his basement window and look up at it and watch it day by day
as it came into its moment's glory of young and magic green. And then
towards sunset, if he was tired, he could lie down to rest awhile upon
his iron bed and listen to the dying birdsong in the tree. Thus, each
spring, in that one tree, he found all April and the earth. He also
found devotion, love, and wisdom in a shabby little Jewish tailor and
his wife, whose dirty children were always tumbling in and out of the
dingy suffocation of his shop.</p>

<p>In the infinite variety of such common, accidental, oft-unheeded
things one can see the web of life as it is spun. Whether we wake at
morning in the city, or lie at night in darkness in the country towns,
or walk the streets of furious noon in all the dusty, homely, and
enduring lights of present time, the universe round us is the same.
Evil lives for ever--so does good. Man alone has knowledge of these
two, and he is such a little thing.</p>

<p>For what is man?</p>

<p>First, a child, soft-boned, unable to support itself on its rubbery
legs, befouled with its excrement, that howls and laughs by turns,
cries for the moon but hushes when it gets its mother's teat; a
sleeper, eater, guzzler, howler, laugher, idiot, and a chewer of its
toe; a little tender thing all blubbered with its spit, a reacher into
fires, a beloved fool.</p>

<p>After that, a boy, hoarse and loud before his companions, but afraid
of the dark; will beat the weaker and avoid the stronger; worships
strength and savagery, loves tales of war and murder, and violence done
to others; joins gangs and hates to be alone; makes heroes out of
soldiers, sailors, prize-fighters, football players, cowboys, gunmen,
and detectives; would rather die than not out-try and out-dare his
companions, wants to beat them and always to win, shows his muscle and
demands that it be felt, boasts of his victories and will never own
defeat.</p>

<p>Then the youth: goes after girls, is foul behind their backs among
the drug-store boys, hints at a hundred seductions, but gets pimples on
his face; begins to think about his clothes, becomes a fop, greases his
hair, smokes cigarettes with a dissipated air, reads novels, and writes
poetry on the sly. He sees the world now as a pair of legs and breasts;
he knows hate, love, and jealousy; he is cowardly and foolish, he
cannot endure to be alone; he lives in a crowd, thinks with the crowd,
is afraid to be marked off from his fellows by an eccentricity. He
joins clubs and is afraid of ridicule; he is bored and unhappy and
wretched most of the time. There is a great cavity in him, he is
dull.</p>

<p>Then the man: he is busy, he is full of plans and reasons, he has
work. He gets children, buys and sells small packets of everlasting
earth, intrigues against his rivals, is exultant when he cheats them.
He wastes his little three score years and ten in spendthrift and
ingloriousliving; from his cradle to his grave he scarcely sees the sun
or moon or stars; he is unconscious of the immortal sea and earth; he
talks of he future and he wastes it as it comes. If he is lucky, he
saves money. At the end his fat purse buys him flunkeys to carry him
where his shanks no longer can; he consumes rich food and golden wine
that his wretched stomach has no hunger for; his weary and lifeless
eyeslook out upon the scenery of strange lands for which in youth his
heart was panting. Then the slow death, prolonged by costly doctors,
and finally the graduate undertakers, the perfumed carrion, the suave
ushers with palms outspread to leftwards, the fast motor hearses, and
the earth again.</p>

<p>This is man: a writer of books, a putter-down of words, a painter of
pictures, a maker of ten thousand philosophies. He grows passion-site
over ideas, he hurls scorn and mockery at another's work, he finds the
one way, the true way, for himself, and calls all others false--yet in
the billion books upon the shelves there is not one that can tell him
how to draw a single fleeting breath in peace and comfort. He makes
histories of the universe, he directs the destiny of nations, but he
does not know his own history, and he cannot direct his own destiny
with dignity or wisdom for ten consecutive minutes.</p>

<p>This is man: for the most part a foul, wretched, abominable
creature, a packet of decay, a bundle of degenerating tissues, a
creature that gets old and hairless and has a foul breath, a hater of
his kind, a cheater, a scorner, a mocker, a reviler, a thing that kills
and murders in a mob or in the dark, loud and full of brag surrounded
by his fellows, but without the courage of a rat alone. He will cringe
for a coin, and show his snarling fangs behind the giver's back; he
will cheat for two sous, and kill for forty dollars, and weep copiously
in court to keep another scoundrel out of jail.</p>

<p>This is man, who will steal his friend's woman, feel the leg of his
host's wife below the table-cloth, dump fortunes on his whores, bow
down in worship before charlatans, and let his poets die. This is man,
who swears he will live only for beauty, for art, for the spirit, but
will live only for fashion, and will change his faith and his
convictions as soon as fashion changes. This is man, the great warrior
with the flaccid gut, the great romantic with the barren loins, the
eternal knave devouring the eternal fool, the most glorious of all the
animals, who uses his brain for the most part to make himself a stench
in the nostrils of the Bull, the Fox, the Dog, the Tiger, and the
Goat.</p>

<p>Yes, this is man, and it is impossible to say the worst of him, for
the record of his obscene existence, his baseness, lust, cruelty, and
treachery, is illimitable. His life is also full of toil, tumult, and
suffering. His days are mainly composed of a million idiot,
repetitions--in goings and comings along hot streets, in sweatings and
freezings, in the senseless accumulation of fruitless tasks, in
decaying and being patched, in grinding out his life so that he may buy
bad food, in eating bad food so that he may grind his life out in
distressful defecations. He is the dweller in that ruined tenement who,
from one moment's breathing to another, can hardly forget the bitter
weight of his uneasy flesh, the thousand diseases and distresses of his
body, the growing incubus of his corruption. This is man, who, if he
can remember ten golden moments of joy and happiness out of all his
years, ten moments unmarked by care, unseamed by aches or itches, has
power to lift himself with his expiring breath and say: "I have lived
upon this earth and known glory!"</p>

<p>This is man, and one wonders why he wants to live at all. A third of
his life is lost and deadened under sleep; another third is given to a
sterile labour; a sixth is spent in all his goings and his comings, in
the moil and shuffle of the streets, in thrusting, shoving, pawing. How
much of him is left, then, for a vision of the tragic stars? How much
of him is left to look upon the everlasting earth? How much of him is
left for glory and the making of great songs? A few snatched moments
only from the barren glut and suck of living.</p>

<p>Here, then, is man, this moth of time, this dupe of brevity and
numbered hours, this travesty of waste and sterile breath. Yet if the
gods could come here to a desolate, deserted earth where only the ruin
of man's cities remained, where only a few marks and carvings of his
hand were legible upon his broken tablets, where only a wheel lay
rusting in the desert sand, a cry would burst out of their hearts and
they would say: "He lived, and he was here!"</p>

<p>Behold his works:</p>

<p>He needed speech to ask for bread--and he had Christ! He needed
songs to sing in battle--and he had Homer! He needed words to curse his
enemies--and he had Dante, he had Voltaire, he had Swift! He needed
cloth to cover up his hairless, puny flesh against the seasons--and he
wove the robes of Solomon, he made the garments of great kings, he made
the samite for the young knights! He needed walls and a roof to shelter
him--and he made Blois! He needed a temple to propitiate his God--and
he made Chartres and Fountains Abbey! He was born to creep upon the
earth--and he made great wheels, he sent great engines thundering down
the rails, he launched great wings into the air, he put great ships
upon the angry sea!</p>

<p>Plagues wasted him, and cruel wars destroyed his strongest sons, but
fire, flood, and famine could not quench him. No, nor the inexorable
grave--his sons leaped shouting from his dying loins. The shaggy bison
with his thews of thunder died upon the plains; the fabled mammoths of
the unrecorded ages are vast scaffoldings of dry, insensate loam; the
panthers have learned caution and move carefully among tall grasses to
the water-hole; and man lives on amid the senseless nihilism of the
universe.</p>

<p>For there is one belief, one faith, that is man's glory, his
triumph, his immortality--and that is his belief in life. Man loves
life, and, loving life, hates death, and because of this he is great,
he is glorious, he is beautiful, and his beauty is everlasting. He
lives below the senseless stars and writes his meanings in them. He
lives in fear, in toil, in agony, and in unending tumult, but if the
blood foamed bubbling from his wounded lungs at every breath he drew,
he would still love life more dearly than an end of breathing. Dying,
his eyes burn beautifully, and the old hunger shines more fiercely in
them--he has endured all the hard and purposeless suffering, and still
he wants to live.</p>

<p>Thus it is impossible to scorn this creature. For out of his strong
belief in life, this puny man made love. At his best, he <i>is</i>
love. Without him there can be no love, no hunger, no desire.</p>

<p>So this is man--the worst and best of him--this frail and petty
thing who lives his day and dies like-all the other animals, and is
forgotten. And yet, he is immortal, too, for both the good and evil
that he does live after him. Why, then, should any living man ally
himself with death, and, in his greed and blindness, batten on his
brother's blood?</p>

<h2><a name="chapter4-28"></a>28. The Fox</h2>

<p>During all these desperate years in Brooklyn, when George lived and
worked alone, he had only one real friend, and this was his editor,
Foxhall Edwards. They spent many hours together, wonderful hours of
endless talk, so free and full that it combed the universe and bound
the two of them together in bonds of closest friendship. It was a
friendship founded on many common tastes and interests, on mutual
liking and admiration of each for what the other was, and on an
attitude of respect which allowed unhampered expression of opinion even
on those rare subjects which aroused differences of views and of
belief. It was, therefore, the kind of friendship that can exist only
between two men. It had in it no element of that possessiveness which
always threatens a woman's relations with a man, no element of that
physical and emotional involvement which, while it serves nature's end
of bringing a man and woman together, also tends to thwart their own
dearest wish to remain so by throwing over their companionship a
constricting cloak of duty and obligation, of right' and vested
interest.</p>

<p>The older man was not merely friend but father to the younger.
Webber, the hot-blooded Southerner, with his large capacity for
sentiment and affection, had lost his own father many years before and
now had found a substitute in Edwards. And Edwards, the reserved New
Englander, with his deep sense of family and inheritance, had always
wanted a son but had had five daughters, and as time went on he made of
George a kind of foster son. Thus each, without quite knowing that he
did it, performed an act of spiritual adoption.</p>

<p>So it was to Foxhall Edwards that George now turned whenever his
loneliness became unbearable. When his inner turmoil, confusion, and
self-doubts overwhelmed him, as they often did, and his life went dead
and stale and empty till it sometimes seemed that all the barren
desolation of the Brooklyn streets had soaked into his very blood and
marrow--then he would seek out Edwards. And he never went to him in
vain. Edwards, busy though he always was, would drop whatever he was
doing and would take George out to lunch or dinner, and in his quiet,
casual, oblique, and understanding way would talk to him and draw him
out until he found out what it was that troubled him. And always in the
end, because of Edward's faith in him, George would be healed and find
himself miraculously restored to self-belief.</p>

<p>What manner of man was this great editor and father-confessor and
true friend--he of the quiet, shy, sensitive, and courageous heart who
often seemed to those who did not know him well an eccentric, cold,
indifferent fellow--he who, grandly christened Foxhall, preferred to be
the simple, unassuming Fox?</p>

<p>The Fox asleep was a breathing portrait of guileless innocence. He
slept on his right side, legs doubled up a little, hands folded
together underneath the ear, his hat beside him on the pillow. Seen so,
the sleeping figure of the Fox was touching--for all his five and forty
years, it was so plainly boylike. By no stretch of fancy the old hat
beside him on the pillow might have been a childish toy brought to bed
with him the night before--and this, in fact, it was!</p>

<p>It was as if, in sleep, no other part of Fox was left except the
boy. Sleep seemed to have resumed into itself this kernel of his life,
to have excluded all transitions, to have brought the man back to his
acorn, keeping thus inviolate that which the man, indeed, had never
lost, but which had passed through change and time and all the
accretions of experience--and now had been restored, unwoven back into
the single oneness of itself.</p>

<p>And yet it was a guileful Fox, withal. Oh, guileful Fox, how
innocent in guilefulness and in innocence how full of guile! How
straight in cunning, and how cunning-straight, in all directions how
strange-devious, in all strange-deviousness how direct! Too straight
for crookedness, and for envy too serene, too fair for blind
intolerance, too just and seeing and too strong for hate, too honest
for base dealing, too high for low suspiciousness, too innocent for all
the scheming tricks of swarming villainy--yet never had been taken in a
horse trade yet!</p>

<p>So, then, life's boy is he, life's trustful child; life's
guileful-guileless Fox is he, but not life's angel, not life's fool.
Will get at all things like a fox--not full-tilt at the fences, not
head-on, but through coverts peering, running at fringes of the wood,
or by the wall; will swing round on the pack and get behind the hounds,
cross them up and be away and gone when they are looking for him where
he's not--he will not mean to fox them, but he will.</p>

<p>Gets round the edges of all things the way a fox does. Never takes
the main route or the worn handle. Sees the worn handle, what it is,
says: "Oh," but knows it's not right handle though most used: gets
right handle right away and uses it. No one knows how it is done,
neither knows the Fox, but does it instantly. It seems so easy when Fox
does it, easy as a shoe, because he has had it from his birth. It is a
genius.</p>

<p>Our Fox is never hard or fancy, always plain. He makes all plays
look easy, never brilliant; it seems that anyone can do it when Fox
does it. He covers more ground than any other player in the game, yet
does not seem to do so. His style is never mannered, seems no style at
all; the thrilled populace never holds its breath in hard suspense when
he takes aim, because no one ever saw the Fox take aim, and yet he
never misses. Others spend their lives in learning to take aim: they
wear just the proper uniform for taking aim, they advance in good
order, they signal to the breathless world for silence--"We are taking
aim!" they say, and then with faultless style and form, with flawless
execution, they bring up their pieces, take aim--and <i>miss!</i> The
great Fox never seems to take aim, and never misses. Why? He was just
born that way--fortunate, a child of genius, innocent and simple--and a
Fox!</p>

<p>"And ah!--a cunning Fox!" the Aimers and the Missers say. "A damned
subtle, devilish, and most cunning Fox!" they cry, and grind their
teeth. "Be not deceived by his appearance--'tis a cunning Fox! Put not
your faith in Foxes, put not your faith in this one, he will look so
shy, and seem so guileless and so bewildered--but he will never
miss!"</p>

<p>"But how"--the Aimers and the Missers plead with one another in
exasperation--"how does he do it? What has the fellow got? He's nothing
much to look at--nothing much to talk to. He makes no appearance! He
never goes out in the world--you never see him at receptions, parties,
splendid entertainments--he makes no effort to meet people--no, or to
talk to them! He hardly talks at all!...What has he got? Where does it
come from? Is it chance or luck? There is some mystery----"</p>

<p>"Well, now," says one, "I'll tell you what my theory is----"</p>

<p>Their heads come close, they whisper craftily together until----</p>

<p>"No!" another cries. "It is not that. I tell you what he does,
it's----"</p>

<p>And again they whisper close, argue and deny, get more confused than
ever, and finally are reduced to furious impotence:</p>

<p>"Bah!" cries one. "How does the fellow do it, anyway? How does he
get away with it? He seems to have no sense, no knowledge, no
experience. He doesn't get round the way we do, lay snares and traps.
He doesn't seem to know what's going on, or what the whole thing's all
about--and yet----"</p>

<p>"He's just a <i>snob!</i>" another snarls. "When you try to be a
good fellow, he high-hats you! You try to kid him, he just looks at
you! He never offers to shake hands with you, he never slaps you on the
back the way real fellows do! You go out of your way to be nice to
him--to show him you're a real guy and that you think he is, too--and
what does he do? He just looks at you with that funny little grin and
turns away--and wears that damned hat in the office all day long--I
think he <i>sleeps</i> with it! He never asks you to sit down--and gets
up while you're talking to him--leaves you cold--begins to wander up
and down outside, staring at everyone he sees--his own associates--as
if he were some half-wit idiot boy--and wanders back into his office
twenty minutes later--stares at you as if he never saw your face
before--and jams that damned hat farther down round his ears, and turns
away--takes hold of his lapels--looks out the window with that crazy
grin--then looks at you again, looks you up and down, stares at your
face until you wonder if you've changed suddenly into a baboon--and
turns back to the window without a word--then stares at you
again--finally <i>pretends</i> to recognise you, and says: 'Oh, it's
you!'...I tell you he's a snob, and that's his way of letting you know
you don't <i>belong!</i> Oh, I know about him--I know what he is! He's
an old New Englander--older than God, by God! Too good for anyone but
God, by God!--and even God's a little doubtful! An aristocrat--a rich
man's son--a Groton-Harvard boy--too fine for the likes of us, by
God!--too good for the 'low bounders' who make up this profession! He
thinks we're a bunch of business men and Babbitts--and that's the
reason that he looks at us the way he does--that's the reason that he
grins his grin, and turns away, and catches at his coat lapels, and
doesn't answer when you speak to him--"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," another quickly interrupts. "You're wrong there! The
reason that he grins that grin and turns away is that he's trying hard
to hear--the reason that he doesn't answer when you speak to him is
that he's deaf----"</p>

<p>"Ah, deaf!" says still another in derision. "Deaf, hell! Deaf as a
Fox, <i>he</i> is! That deafness is a stall--a trick--a gag! He hears
you when he wants to hear you! If it's anything he wants to hear,
<i>he'll</i> hear you though you're forty yards away and talking in a
whisper! He's a Fox, I tell you!"</p>

<p>"Yes, a Fox, a Fox!" they chorus in agreement. "That much is
certain--the man's a Fox!"</p>

<p>So the Aimers and the Missers whisper, argue, and deduce. They lay
siege to intimates and friends of Fox, ply them with flattery and
strong drink, trying thus to pluck out the heart of Fox's mystery. They
find out nothing, because there's nothing to find out, nothing anyone
can tell them. They are reduced at length to exasperated bafflement and
finish where they started. They advance to their positions, take
aim--and miss!</p>

<p>And so, in all their ways, they lay cunning snares throughout the
coverts of the city. They lay siege to life. They think out tactics,
crafty stratagems. They devise deep plans to bag the game. They
complete masterly flanking operations in the night-time (while the
great Fox sleeps), get in behind the enemy when he isn't looking, are
sure that victory is within their grasp, take aim magnificently--and
fire--and shoot one another painfully in the seats of their expensive
pants!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Fox is sleeping soundly through the night, as sweetly
as a child.</p>

<p>Night passes, dawn comes, eight o'clock arrives. How to describe him
now as he awakes?</p>

<p>A man of five and forty years, not really seeming younger, yet
always seeming something of the boy. Rather, the boy is there within
that frame of face, behind the eyes, within the tenement of flesh and
bone--not imprisoned, just held there in a frame--a frame a little worn
by the years, webbed with small wrinkles round the eyes--invincibly the
same as it has always been. The hair, once fair and blond, no longer
fair and blond now, feathered at the temples with a touch of grey,
elsewhere darkened by time and weather to a kind of
steel-grey--blondness really almost dark now, yet, somehow, still
suggesting fair and blond. The head well set and small, boy's head
still, the hair sticking thick and close to it, growing to a V in the
centre of the forehead, then back straight and shapely, full of natural
grace. Eyes pale blue, full of a strange misty light, a kind of far
weather of the sea in them, eyes of a New England sailor long months
outbound for China on a clipper ship, with something drowned,
sea-sunken in them.</p>

<p>The general frame and structure of the face is somewhat lean and
long and narrow--face of the ancestors, a bred face, face of people who
have looked the same for generations. A stern, lonely face, with the
enduring fortitude of granite, face of the New England seacoast, really
his grandfather's face, New England statesman's face, whose bust sits
there on the mantel, looking at the bed. Yet something else has
happened on Fox's face to transfigure it from the primeval nakedness of
granite: in its essential framework, granite still, but a kind of
radiance and warmth of life has enriched and mellowed it. A light is
burning in the Fox, shining outwards through the face, through every
gesture, grace, and movement of the body, 'something swift, mercurial,
mutable, and tender, something buried and withheld, but
passionate--something out of his mother's face, perhaps,' or out of his
father's or his father's mother's--something that subdues the granite
with warmth--something from poetry, intuition, genius, imagination,
living, inner radiance, and beauty. This face, then, with the shapely
head, the pale, far-misted vision of the eyes, held in round bony cages
like a bird's, the strong, straight nose, curved at the end, a little
scornful and patrician, sensitive, sniffing, swift-nostriled as a
hound's--the whole face with its passionate and proud serenity might
almost be the face of a great poet, or the visage of some strange and
mighty bird.</p>

<p>But now the sleeping figure stirs, opens its eyes and listens,
rouses, starts up like a flash.</p>

<p>"What?" says Fox.</p>

<p>The Fox awake now.</p>

<p>"FOXHALL MORTON EDWARDS."</p>

<p>The great name chanted slowly through his brain--someone had surely
spoken it--it filled his ears with sound--it rang down solemnly through
the aisles of consciousness--it was no dream--the very walls were
singing with its grave and proud sonorities as he awoke.</p>

<p>"What?" cried Fox again.</p>

<p>He looked about him. There was no one there. He shook his head as
people do when they shake water from their ears. He inclined his good
right ear and listened for the sound again. He tugged and rubbed his
good right ear--yes, it was unmistakable--the good right ear was
ringing with the sound.</p>

<p>Fox looked bewildered, puzzled, searched round the room again with
sea-pale eyes, saw nothing, saw his hat beside him on the pillow, said,
"Oh," in a slightly puzzled tone, picked up the hat and jammed it on
his head, half-covering the ears, swung out of bed and thrust his feet
into his slippers, got up, pyjamaed and behatted, walked over to the
door, opened it, looked out, and said:</p>

<p>"What? Is anybody there?--Oh!"</p>

<p>For there was nothing--just the hall, the quiet, narrow hall of
morning, the closed door of his wife's room, and the stairs.</p>

<p>He closed the door, turned back into his room, still looking
puzzled, intently listening, his good right ear half-turned and
searching for the sounds.</p>

<p>Where had they come from then? The name--he thought he heard it
still, faintly now, mixed in with many other strange, confusing noises.
But where? From, what direction did they come? Or had he heard them? A
long, droning sound, like an electric fan--perhaps a motor in the
street? A low, retreating thunder--an elevated train, perhaps? A fly
buzzing? Or a mosquito with its whining bore? No, it could not be: it
was morning, spring-time, and the month of May.</p>

<p>Light winds of morning fanned the curtains of his pleasant room. An
old four-poster bed, a homely, gay old patch-quilt coverlet, an old
chest of drawers, a little table by his bed, piled high with
manuscripts, a glass of water and his eyeglasses, and a little ticking
clock. Was that what he had heard? He held it to his ear and listened.
On the mantel, facing him, the bust of his grandfather, Senator William
Fox-hall Morton, far-seeing, sightless, stern, lean, shrewd with
decision; a chair or two, and on the wall an engraving of
Michelangelo's great Lorenzo Medici. Fox looked at it and smiled.</p>

<p>"A <i>man</i>," said he in a low voice. "The way a man <i>should</i>
look!" The figure of the young Caesar was mighty-limbed, enthroned;
helmeted for war; the fine hand half-supporting the chin of the grand
head, broodingly aware of great events and destiny; thought knit to
action, poetry to fact, caution to boldness, reflection to
decision--the Thinker, Warrior, Statesman, Ruler all conjoined in one.
"And what a man <i>should</i> be," thought Fox.</p>

<p>A little puzzled still, Fox goes to his window and looks out,
pyjamaed and behatted still, the fingers of one hand back upon his
hips, a movement lithe and natural as a boy's. The head goes back,
swift nostrils sniff, dilate with scorn. Light winds of morning fan
him, gauzy curtains are blown back.</p>

<p>And outside, morning, and below him, morning, sky-shining morning
all above, below, around, across from him, cool-slanting morning,
gold-cool morning, and the street. Black fronts of rusty brown across
from him, the flat fronts of Turtle Bay.</p>

<p>Fox looks at morning and the street with sea-pale eyes, as if he
never yet had seen them, then in a low and husky voice, a little
hoarse, agreeable, half-touched with whisper, he says with slow
recognition, quiet wonder, and--somehow, somewby--resignation:</p>

<p>"Oh...I see."</p>

<p>Turns now and goes into his bathroom opposite, surveys himself in
the mirror with the same puzzled, grave, and sea-pale wonder, looks at
his features, notes the round cages that enclose his eyes, sees Boy-Fox
staring gravely out at him, bethinks him suddenly of Boy-Fox's ear,
which stuck out at right angles forty years ago, getting Boy-Fox gibes
at Groton--so jams hat farther down about the ear, so stick-out ear
that's stick-out ear no longer won't stick out!</p>

<p>So standing, he surveys himself for several moments, and finding out
at length that this indeed is he, says, as before, with the same
slightly puzzled, slow, and patiently resigned acceptance:</p>

<p>"Oh. I see."</p>

<p>Turns on the shower faucet now--the water spurts and hisses in jets
of smoking steam. Fox starts to step beneath the shower, suddenly
observes pyjamas on his person, mutters slowly--"Oh-h!"--and takes them
off. Unpyjamaed now, and as God made him, save for hat, starts to get
in under shower with hat on--and remembers hat, remembers it in high
confusion, is forced against his will to acknowledge the unwisdom of
the procedure--so snaps his fingers angrily, and, in a low, disgusted
tone of acquiescence, says:</p>

<p>"Oh, well, then! <i>All</i> right!"</p>

<p>So removes his hat, which is now jammed on so tightly that he has to
take both hands and fairly wrench and tug his way out of it, hangs the
battered hulk reluctantly within easy reaching distance on a hook upon
the door, surveys it for a moment with an undecided air, as if still
not willing to relinquish it--and then, still with a puzzled air, steps
in beneath those hissing jets of water hot enough to boil an egg!</p>

<p>Puzzled no longer, my mad masters, ye may take it, Fox comes out on
the double-quick, and loudly utters: "Damn!"--and fumes and dances,
snaps his fingers, loudly utters "Damn!" again--but gets his water
tempered to his hide this time, and so, without more peradventure,
takes his shower.</p>

<p>Shower done, hair brushed at once straight back <i>around</i> his
well-shaped head, on goes the hat at once. So brushes teeth, shaves
with a safety razor, walks out naked but behatted into his room, starts
to go downstairs, remembers clothing--"Oh!"--looks round, bepuzzled,
sees clothing spread out neatly on a chair by womenfolks the night
before--fresh socks, fresh underwear, a clean shirt, a suit, a pair of
shoes. Fox never knows where they come from, wouldn't know where to
look, is always slightly astonished when he finds them. Says "Oh!"
again, goes back and puts clothes on, and finds to his amazement that
they fit.</p>

<p>They fit him beautifully. Everything fits the Fox. He never knows
what he has on, but he could wear a tow-sack, or a shroud, a sail, a
length of canvas--they would fit the moment that he put them on, and be
as well the elegance of faultless style. His clothes just seem to grow
on him: whatever he wears takes on at once the grace, the dignity, and
the unconscious ease of his own person. Never exercises much, but never
has to; loves to take a walk, is bored by games and plays none; has
same figure that he had at twenty-one--five feet ten, one hundred and
fifty pounds, no belly and no fat, the figure of a boy.</p>

<p>Dressed now, except for necktie, picks up necktie, suddenly observes
it, a very gay one with blue polka dots, and drops it with dilating
nostrils, muttering a single word that seems to utter volumes:</p>

<p>"<i>Women!</i>"</p>

<p>Then searches vaguely on a tie rack in his closet, finds a modest
grey cravat, and puts it on. So, attired now, picks up a manuscript,
his pince-nez glasses, opens the door, and walks out in the narrow
hall.</p>

<p>His wife's door closed and full of sleep, the air touched subtly
with a faint perfume. The Fox sniffs sharply, with a swift upward
movement of his head, and, looking with scorn, mixed with compassion,
pity, tenderness, and resignation, inclines his head in one slow
downward movement of decision, and says:</p>

<p>"<i>Women!</i>"</p>

<p>So, down the narrow, winding staircase now, his head thrown sharply
back, one hand upon his lapel, the other holding manuscript, and
reaches second floor. Another narrow hall. Front, back and to the side,
three more closed doors of sleep and morning, and five
daughters----</p>

<p>"<i>Women!</i>"</p>

<p>Surveys the door of Martha, the oldest, twenty, a----</p>

<p><i>Woman!</i></p>

<p>And next the door of Eleanor, aged eighteen, and Amelia, just
sixteen, but----</p>

<p>Women!</p>

<p>And finally, with a gentle scorn, touched faintly with a smile, the
door of the two youngest, Ruth, fourteen, little Ann, just seven,
yet----</p>

<p><i>Women!</i></p>

<p>So, sniffing sharply the woman-laden air, descends now to the first
floor, enters living-room, and scornfully surveys the work of----</p>

<p><i>Women!</i></p>

<p>The carpets are rolled up, the morning sunlight slants on the bare
boards. The chairs, the sofas, and upholstery have been ripped open,
the stuffing taken out. The place smells of fresh paint. The walls,
brown yesterday, are robin's-egg blue this morning. Buckets of paint
are scattered round the floor. Even the books that lined the walls have
been taken from the tall, indented shelves. The interior decorators are
at their desperate work again, and all because of----</p>

<p><i>Women!</i></p>

<p>Fox sniffs the fresh paint with sharp disgust, crosses the room,
mounts winding steps, which also have been painted robin's-egg blue,
and goes out on the terrace. Gay chairs and swings and tables,
gay-striped awnings, and in an ash-tray several cigarette-butts with
tell-tale prints upon them----</p>

<p><i>Women!</i></p>

<p>The garden backs of Turtle Bay are lyrical with tender green, with
birdsong and the hidden plash of water--the living secret of elves'
magic embedded in the heart of the gigantic city--and beyond, like some
sheer, terrific curtain of upward-curving smoke, the frontal cliff of
the sky-waving towers.</p>

<p>Fox sniffs sharply the clean green fragrance of the morning,
sea-pale eyes are filled with wonder, strangeness, recognition.
Something passionate and far transforms his face--and something rubs
against his leg, moans softly. Fox looks down into the melancholy,
pleading eyes of the French poodle. He observes the ridiculous
barbering of the creature--the fuzzy muff of kinky wool around the
shoulders, neck, and head, the skinned nakedness of ribs and loins,
wool-fuzzy tail again, tall, skinny legs--a <i>half</i>-dressed female
creature with no wool at all just where the wool is needed most--no dog
at all, but just a frenchified parody of dog--an absurd travesty of all
the silly fashions, mannerisms, conquettishness, and irresponsibility
of a----</p>

<p><i>Woman!</i></p>

<p>Fox turns in disgust, leaves terrace, descends steps to the
living-room again, traverses barren boards, threads way round the
disembowelled furnishings, and descends the stairs to the basement
floor.</p>

<p>"What's <i>this?</i>"</p>

<p>In entrance hall below, a lavish crimson carpet where yesterday
there was a blue one, cream-white paint all over walls to-day, which
yesterday were green, the wall all chiselled into, a great sheet of
mirror ready to be installed where yesterday no mirror was.</p>

<p>Fox traverses narrow hallway, past the kitchen, through the
cloakroom--this, too, redolent of fresh paint--and into little
cubbyhole that had no use before.</p>

<p>"Good God, what's <i>this?</i>"</p>

<p>Transfigured now to Fox's "cosy den" (Fox wants no "cosy den"--will
have none!), walls are painted, bookshelves built, a reading lamp and
easy chairs in place, the Fox's favourite books (Fox groans!)
transplanted from their shelves upstairs and brought down here where
Fox can never find them.</p>

<p>Fox bumps his head against the low doorway in going out, traverses
narrow hall again, at last gets into dining-room. Seats himself at head
of the long table (six women make a long table!), looks at the glass of
orange juice upon his plate, does nothing to it, makes no motion
towards it, just sits there waiting in a state of patient and resigned
dejection, as who should say: "It's no one but the Old Grey Mule."</p>

<p>Portia enters--a plump mulatto, nearing fifty, tinged so
imperceptibly with yellow that she is almost white. She enters, stops,
stares at Fox sitting motionless there, and titters coyly. Fox turns
slowly, catches his coat lapels, and looks at her in blank
astonishment. She drops her eyelids shyly, tittering, and spreads plump
fingers over her fat mouth. Fox surveys her steadily, as if trying to
peer through her fingers at her face, then with a kind of no-hope
expression in his eyes, he says slowly, in a sepulchral tone:</p>

<p>"Fruit salad."</p>

<p>And Portia, anxiously:</p>

<p>"What fo' you doesn't drink yo' orange juice, Mistah Edwands?
Doesn't you like it?"</p>

<p>"Fruit salad," repeats Fox tonelessly.</p>

<p>"What fo' you always eat dat ole fruit salad, Mistah Edwahds? What
fo' you wants dat ole canned stuff when we fixes you de nice fresh
orange juice?"</p>

<p>"Fruit salad," echoes Fox dolefully, utter resignation in his
tone.</p>

<p>Portia departs protesting, but presently fruit salad is produced and
put before him. Fox eats it, then looks round and up at Portia, and,
still with no-hope resignation in his voice, says low and hoarsely:</p>

<p>"Is that--<i>all</i>?"</p>

<p>"Why, no suh, Mistah, Edwahds," Portia replies. "You can have
anything you likes if you jest lets us know. We nevah knows jest what
you's goin' to awdah. All las' month you awdahed fish fo' brek-fus'--is
<i>dat</i> what you wants?"</p>

<p>"Breast of guinea-hen," says Fox tonelessly.</p>

<p>"Why, <i>Mistah</i> Edwahds!" Portia squeals. "Breas' of guinea-hen
fo' <i>brek</i>-fus'?"</p>

<p>"Yes," says Fox, patient and enduring.</p>

<p>"But, Mistah Edwahds!" Portia protests. "You know you doesn't want
breas' of guinea-hen fo' <i>brek</i>-fus'!"</p>

<p>"Yes," says Fox in his hopeless tone, "I do." And he regards her
steadily with sea-misted eyes, with proud and scornful features,
eloquent with patient and enduring bitterness as if to say: "Man is
born of <i>woman</i> and is made to mourn."</p>

<p>"But Mistah Edwahds," Portia pleads with him, "fokes don't eat
breas' of guinea-hen fo' <i>brek</i>-fus'! Dey eats ham an' aiggs, an'
toast an' bacon--things like dat."</p>

<p>Fox continues to regard her fixedly.</p>

<p>"Breast of guinea-hen," he says wearily, implacably as before.</p>

<p>"B-b-b-but, Mistah Edwahds," Portia stammers, thoroughly demoralised
by this time, "we ain't <i>got</i> no breas' of guinea-hen."</p>

<p>"We had some night before last," says Fox.</p>

<p>"Yes, suh, yes, suh!" Portia almost tearfully agrees. "But dat's all
gone! We et up all dere was!...Besides, you been eatin' breas' of
guinea-hen ev'ry night fo' dinnah de las' two weeks, an' Miz
Edwands--she say you had enough--she say de chillun gettin' tired of
it--she tol' us to get somep'n else!...If you tol' us dat you wanted
guinea-hen fo' brek-fus', we'd a-had it. But you nevah tol' us, Mista
Edwahds." Portia is on the verge of open tears by now. "You nevah tells
us what you wants--an' dat's why we nevah knows. One time you wanted
cream chicken fo' yo' brek-fus' ev'ry mawnin' fo' a month...Den you
changed roun' to codfish balls, an' had dat fo' a long, long time...An'
now it's guinea-hen," she almost sobs--"an' we ain't <i>got</i> none,
Mistah Edwahds. You nevah tol' us what you wanted. We got ham an'
aiggs--we got bacon--we got--",</p>

<p>"Oh, well," says Fox wearily, "bring what you have, then--anything
you like."</p>

<p>He turns away full of patient scorn, enduring and unhoping
bitterness--and "aiggs" are brought him. Fox eats them with relish;
toast, too, three brown slices, buttered; and drinks two cups of strong
hot coffee.</p>

<p>Just at half-past eight something entered the dining-room as swift
and soundless as a ray of light. It was a child of fourteen years, a
creature of surpassing loveliness, the fourth daughter of the Fox,
named Ruth. It was the Fox in miniature: a little creature, graceful as
a bird, framed finely as some small and perfect animal. The small, lean
head was shaped and set exactly as the head of Fox, the dark blonde
hair grew cleanly to it, the child's face was of an ivory transparency,
the features and the sensitivity of expression were identical with
those of Fox, transformed to femininity, and the lines of the whole
face were cut and moulded with the exquisite delicacy of a cameo.</p>

<p>The shyness of this little girl was agonising; it was akin to
terror. She entered the room breathlessly, noiselessly, stricken, with
her head lowered, her arms held to her side, her eyes fixed on the
floor. The ordeal of passing by her father, and of speaking to him, was
obviously a desperate one; she glided past as if she almost hoped to
escape notice. Without raising her eyes, she said: "Good morning,
daddy," in a timid little voice, and was about to duck into her chair,
when Fox looked up startled, got up quickly, put his arms round her,
and kissed her. In answer to his kiss, she pecked her cheek towards him
like a bird, still keeping her eyes desperately on the floor.</p>

<p>The face of Fox was illuminated by a radiant tenderness as, in a
low, deaf, slightly hoarse tone, he said:</p>

<p>"Good morning, darling."</p>

<p>Still without looking at him, stricken, desperate, she tried to get
away from him, yet, even in the act, her affection for the Fox was
eloquent. Her heart was beating like a trip-hammer, her eyes went back
and forth like a frightened fledgling's, she wanted to vanish through
the walls, dart out of doors, turn into a shadow--anything,
<i>anything</i>, if only she could utterly escape notice, having no one
look at her, pay any attention to her, above all, <i>speak</i> to her.
So she fluttered there in his embrace like a dove caught in a snare,
tried to get away from him, was in a state of agony so acute and
sensitive that it was painful to watch her or to do anything that would
in any way increase the embarrassment and desperate shyness of this
stricken little girl.</p>

<p>Fox's embrace tightened round her as she tried to escape, and he
grew full of solicitude and anxiety as he looked at her.</p>

<p>"Darling!" he whispered, in a low and troubled tone. He shook her
gently. "<i>What</i>, darling?" he demanded. "<i>Now</i> what?" he
finally demanded, with a touch of the old scorn.</p>

<p>"But <i>nothing</i>, daddy!" she protested, her timid little voice
rising in a note of desperate protest. "<i>Nothing</i>, daddy!" She
squirmed a little to get free. Reluctantly Fox let her go. The child
ducked right down into her chair, still with her eyes averted, and
concluded with a little gasping laugh of protest: "You're so
<i>funny</i>, daddy!"</p>

<p>Fox resumed his seat and still continued to regard her sternly,
gravely, with alarmed solicitude, and a little scorn. She shot a
frightened look at him and ducked her head down towards her plate.</p>

<p>"Is anything <i>wrong?</i>" said Fox, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"But <i>naturally--not!</i>"--a protesting and exasperated little
gasp of laughter. "Why should anything be <i>wrong?</i> Honestly,
you're so <i>strange</i>, daddy!"</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Fox, with patient resignation.</p>

<p>"But <i>nothing!</i> I keep <i>telling</i> you, there's
<i>nothing!</i> That's what I've told you from the <i>feerst!</i>"</p>

<p>All of the children of the Fox say "feerst" for "first", "beerst"
for "burst", "theerst" for "thirst". Why, no one knows. It seems to be
a tribal accent, not only among all of Fox's children, but among all of
their young cousins on the Fox's side. It is almost as if they were
creatures of some isolated family, immured for generations on some
lonely island, cut off from the world, and speaking some lost accent
that their ancestors spoke three hundred years ago. Moreover, their
tone is characterised by a kind of <i>drawl</i>--not the languorous
drawl of the deep South, but a protesting drawl, a wearied-out,
exasperated drawl, as if they have almost given up hope of making
Fox--or <i>someone</i>--understand what ought to be obvious without any
explanation whatsoever. Thus:</p>

<p>"But <i>nothing</i>, daddy! I've told you that from the
<i>f-e-e-r-s-t!</i>"</p>

<p>"Well, then, what <i>is</i> it, darling?" Fox demanded. "Why do you
<i>look</i> like that?"--with an emphatic downward movement of the
head.</p>

<p>"But look like <i>what?</i>" the child protested. "Oh, <i>daddy</i>,
honestly"--she gasped, with a little strained laugh, and looked
away--"I don't know what you're talking about."</p>

<p>Portia brought smoking oatmeal and put it down before her, and the
girl, saying timidly: "Good morning, Portia," ducked her head and began
to eat hastily.</p>

<p>Fox continued to look at the child sternly, gravely, with a troubled
expression in his eyes. Looking up suddenly, she put down her spoon,
and cried:</p>

<p>"But, <i>daddy--wha-a-t?</i>"</p>

<p>"Are those scoundrels going to be here again to-day?" said Fox.</p>

<p>"Oh, daddy, <i>what</i> scoundrels?...Honestly!" She twisted in her
chair, gasped a little, tried to laugh, picked up her spoon, started to
go on eating, then put her spoon down again.</p>

<p>"Those scoundrels," said the Fox, "that--you <i>women</i>"--he
inclined his head with scornful emphasis--"have brought in to destroy
my home."</p>

<p>"But <i>who</i> are you <i>talking</i> about?" she protested,
looking round like a hunted animal for a means of escape. "I don't know
who you <i>mean</i>."</p>

<p>"I mean," said Fox, "those interior decorating <i>fellows</i>"--here
his voice was filled with the dismissal of an unutterable
contempt--"that you and your <i>mother</i> have imported to wreck the
house."</p>

<p>"But <i>I</i> had nothing to do with it!" the girl protested. "Oh,
daddy, you're <i>so</i>-----" she broke off, squirmed, and turned away
with a little laugh.</p>

<p>"So--<i>what?</i>" said Fox, low, hoarse, and scornful.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know--so--so <i>stra-a-nge!</i> You say such funny
<i>thi-i-ngs!</i>"</p>

<p>"Have you <i>women</i>," Fox went on, "decided when you're going to
let me have a little peace in my own house?"</p>

<p>"Let you have a little <i>pe-a-ce?</i>...What have <i>I</i> done? If
you don't want the decorators, why don't you speak to
<i>mo-o-ther?</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Because</i>"--Fox inclined his head with a slow, ironic emphasis
upon the word--"<i>because</i>--I--don't--count! I'm only
the--Old--Grey--Mule--among six women--and, of course, <i>anything</i>
is good enough for me!"</p>

<p>"But what have <i>we</i> done? We haven't done anything to you! Why
do you act so <i>p-e-e-r</i>-secuted?...Oh, daddy, honestly!" She
squirmed desperately, tried to laugh, turned away, and ducked her head
down towards her plate again.</p>

<p>Sitting back in his chair, one hand clasped upon the arm, his whole
being withdrawn, remote, in an attitude eloquent of deep, unhoping
patience, Fox continued to regard the child gravely for a moment. Then
he thrust his hand into his pocket, pulled his watch out and looked at
it, glanced at the child again, and shook his head in a movement packed
with stern reproach and silent accusation.</p>

<p>She looked up, quick and startled, laid her spoon down, and
gasped:</p>

<p>"<i>Now</i> what? What are you shaking your <i>he-a-ad</i> for? What
is it <i>now?</i>"</p>

<p>"Is your mother up?"</p>

<p>"But <i>naturally</i>, I don't <i>kno-o-w!</i>"</p>

<p>"Are your sisters up?"</p>

<p>"But, <i>da-a-dy</i>, how can I tell?"</p>

<p>"Did you get to bed early?"</p>

<p>"Ye-e-e-s," in a drawl of protest.</p>

<p>"What time did your sisters get to bed?"</p>

<p>"But, of course, I have no way of <i>kno-o-wing!</i> Why don't you
ask <i>the-e-m?</i>"</p>

<p>Fox looked at the watch again, then at the child, and shook his head
once more.</p>

<p>"Women!" he said quietly, and put the watch back into his
pocket.</p>

<p>The child by now has finished with her oatmeal--all she wants of it.
Now she slides out of her chair and, with face averted, tries to glide
past Fox, out of the room. Fox gets up quickly, puts his arms round
her, says in a low, quick, worried tone:</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>darling</i>, where are you going?"</p>

<p>"But to <i>sch-o-o-ol</i>, of course!"</p>

<p>"<i>Darling</i>, stay and <i>eat</i> your breakfast!"</p>

<p>"But I've <i>e-e-a-ten!</i>"</p>

<p>"Oh, you <i>haven't!</i>" whispers Fox impatiently.</p>

<p>"But I've eaten all I <i>wa-a-a-nt!</i>"</p>

<p>"You haven't eaten <i>anything!</i>" he whispers scornfully.</p>

<p>"But I don't <i>want</i> any more," she protests, looks desperately
about, and struggles to free herself. "Oh, let me <i>go-o-o</i>, daddy!
I'll be <i>late!</i>"</p>

<p>"Then <i>be</i> late!" whispers the great watch-watcher and
head-shaker scornfully. "<i>Stay</i> and <i>eat</i> your
<i>breakfast!</i>"--punctuating these decisive words with slow nods of
emphasis.</p>

<p>"But I <i>ca-a-n't!</i> I've got to read a <i>pa-a-per</i>."</p>

<p>"A--what?"</p>

<p>"A <i>t-e-e-r-m</i> paper--for Miss Allen's class--it comes at nine
o'clock."</p>

<p>"Oh," says Fox slowly, "I see." In a low, almost inaudible tone,
"On--<i>Whitman?</i>"</p>

<p>"Ye-e-e-s."</p>

<p>"Oh...Did you read the book I gave you--the one with his war diary
and notes?"</p>

<p>"Ye-e-e-s."</p>

<p>"Astonishing!" whispers Fox. "Isn't it <i>astonishing?</i> You can
see just how he <i>did</i> it, can't you? He--he <i>got right up</i> on
everything," Fox whispers, "just as if he were the thing itself--as if
it were happening to <i>him!</i>"</p>

<p>"Ye-e-e-s." She looks desperately around, then with averted eyes
blurts out: "You were right about the other thing, too."</p>

<p>"What other thing?"</p>

<p>"About night--how there's so much night and darkness in himhis--his
feeling for night."</p>

<p>"Oh," Fox whispers slowly, his sea-pale eyes misted with reflection.
"Did you tell about that, too?"</p>

<p>"Ye-e-s. It's <i>tr-u-e</i>. After you told me, I read him again,
and it's <i>tr-u-e</i>."</p>

<p>Shy, desperate, timid, stricken as she is, she nevertheless knows
it's true when it's true.</p>

<p>"That's <i>fine!</i>" Fox whispers, and shakes his head sharply with
immense satisfaction. "I'll bet it's <i>good!</i>"</p>

<p>The girl's ivory features flush crimson. Like Fox, she loves praise,
yet cannot stand to have it spoken. She squirms, is terrified, is
hoping against hope----</p>

<p>"I don't <i>kno-o-w</i>," she gasps. "Miss Allen didn't like the
last paper I wrote--what I said about Mark Twain."</p>

<p>"Then," Fox whispers, low and scornfully, "let Miss Allen <i>not</i>
like it. That was a <i>fine</i> paper," he whispers. "What--what you
said about the River was just right."</p>

<p>"I <i>kno-o-w!</i> And that was the part she didn't like. She didn't
seem to know what I was talking about--said it was immature and not
sound, and gave me a 'C'."</p>

<p>"Oh," says Fox absently, thinking all the time with an immense
satisfaction of the spirit: "What a girl this <i>is!</i> She has a
<i>fine</i> mind. She--she <i>understands</i> things!"</p>

<p>"You see, darling," Fox whispers gently, coming back to Miss Allen,
"it's not their fault. These people do the best they can--but--but they
just can't seem to <i>understand</i>," he whispers. "You see, Miss
Allen is an--an academic kind of person--I guess, kind of an old maid,
<i>really</i>," he whispers, with an emphatic movement of the
head--"and that kind of person, darling, just wouldn't be able to
understand what Whitman and Mark Twain and Keats are like...It's--it's
a shame," Fox mutters, and shakes his head, his eyes troubled with
regret--"it's a shame we've got to hear about these people first in--in
schools--from--from people like Miss Allen. You see, darling," Fox says
gently, his face cocked sideways, his good ear pointing towards the
girl, his language simple as a shoe, his face keen, shrewd, thoughtful,
and absorbed, and radiant as a blade of light, as it always is when
interest and reflection hold the wise serpent of his brain--"you see,
darling, schools are all right, <i>really</i>--but the <i>Thing</i>
they do is different from the <i>Thing</i> that Keats and Whitman and
Mark Twain do...People like that really have no place in schools. A--a
<i>school</i>," Fox whispers, "is an <i>academic</i> kind of place, you
see--and the people that you find in schools are academic people--and
these other kind of people--the <i>poets</i>," whispers Fox, "are not
academic people--they're--they're really <i>against</i> what the
academic people do--they are people who--who <i>discover</i> things for
themselves," Fox whispers, "who burst through and make another
world--and the academic people cannot understand them--so that's why
what the academic people say about them is--<i>is not much good</i>,"
Fox whispers. For a moment he is silent, then shakes his head and
mutters in a low tone of profound regret: "It's a <i>pity!</i> Too
<i>bad</i> you've got to hear about it first in schools--but--but just
do the best you can with it--get what you can from it--and--and when
<i>those people</i>"--whisper mixed with understanding, pity, and
contempt--"have gone as far as they can go, just forget about the
<i>rest</i> they tell you."</p>

<p>"I <i>kno-o-w</i>! But, really, daddy, when Miss Allen starts
drawing charts and diagrams upon the blackboard, showing how they
<i>did</i> it--it's--it's <i>aw-w-full</i> I can't <i>be-e-ar</i>
it--it just makes everything so,--<i>te-er-rible</i>!...Oh, daddy, let
me go!" She squirms to free herself again, her tender features tortured
with self-consciousness. "<i>Please</i>, daddy! I've got to! I'll be
<i>late!</i>"</p>

<p>"How are you going?"</p>

<p>"But <i>naturally</i>, the way I always go."</p>

<p>"By taxi?"</p>

<p>"But of <i>course</i> not, I take the <i>str-e-e-t</i> car."</p>

<p>"Oh...What street car?"</p>

<p>"The Lexington A-a-a-venue."</p>

<p>"Alone?" says Fox in a low, grave, troubled tone.</p>

<p>"But, of <i>course</i>, daddy!"</p>

<p>He looks at her sternly with a sorrow-troubled face, and shakes his
head.</p>

<p>"But what's wrong with taking the <i>str-e-e-t</i> car? Oh, daddy,
you're <i>so-o</i>--" she squirms, looks off indefinitely, her face
touched by a smile of agonised embarrassment. "<i>Please</i>, daddy!
Let me <i>go-o-o!</i> I tell you I'll be <i>late!</i>"</p>

<p>She pushes a little to release herself, he kisses her, and lets her
go reluctantly.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, darling"--low, hoarse, tender, troubled with grave
solicitude. "You <i>will</i> take care, won't you?"</p>

<p>"But, of <i>course!</i>" A little agonised laugh. "There's nothing
to take <i>care</i>." Then, suddenly, in a timid little voice:
"Good-bye, daddy"--and she is gone, swiftly, silently, like fading
light.</p>

<p>Fox, hands upon his hips, with a look half-trouble and
half-tenderness, follows her with sea-pale eyes until she has gone.
Then he turns back to the table, sits down again, and picks up the
paper.</p>

<p>News.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="chapter4-29"></a>29. "The Hollow Men"</h2>

<p>Fox picks up the paper and settles back to read it with keen relish.
The paper is the <i>Times</i>. (He read the <i>Tribune</i> late last
night: waited up for it, would not miss it, has never missed it, could
not sleep if he had not read it.) Morning now, Fox reads the
<i>Times</i>.</p>

<p>How does he read the <i>Times?</i></p>

<p>He reads it the way Americans have always read the paper. He also
reads it as few Americans have ever read the paper--with nostrils
sensitive, dilating with proud scorn, sniffing for the news behind the
news.</p>

<p>He loves it--even loves the <i>Times</i>--loves Love unlovable--and
don't we all? Ink-fresh papers, millions of them--ink-fresh with
morning, orange juice, waffles, eggs and bacon, and cups of strong hot
coffee. How fine it is, here in America, at ink-fresh, coffee-fragrant
morning, to read the paper!</p>

<p>How often have we read the paper in America! How often have we seen
it <i>blocked</i> against our doors! Little route-boys fold and block
it, so to throw it--and so we find it and unfold it, crackling and
ink-laden, at our doors. Sometimes we find it tossed there lightly with
flat <i>plop</i>; sometimes we find it thrown with solid, whizzing
<i>whack</i> against the clapboards (clapboards here, most often, in
America); sometimes, as now in Turtle Bay, servants find just freshly
folded sheets laid neatly down in doorways, and take them to the table
for their masters. No matter how it got there, we always find it.</p>

<p>How we do love the paper in America! How we do love the paper,
all!</p>

<p>Why do we love the paper in America? Why do we love the paper,
all?</p>

<p>Mad masters, I will tell ye why.</p>

<p>Because the paper is "the news" here in America, and we love the
<i>smell</i> of news. We love the smell of news that's "fit to print".
We also love the smell of news <i>not</i> fit to print. We love,
besides, the smell of <i>facts</i> that news is made of. Therefore we
love the paper because the news is so fit-printable--so
unprintable--and so fact-printable.</p>

<p>Is the news, then, like America? No, it's not--and Fox, unlike the
rest of you, mad masters, turns the pages knowing it is just the news
and not America that he reads there in his <i>Times</i>.</p>

<p>The news is <i>not</i> America, nor is America the <i>news</i>--the
news is <i>in</i> America. It is a kind of light at morning, and at
evening, and at midnight in America. It is a kind of growth and record
and excrescence of our life. It is not good enough--it does not tell
our story--yet it is the news!</p>

<p>Fox reads (proud nose sharp-sniffing with a scornful relish):</p>

<blockquote>An unidentified man fell or jumped yesterday at noon from
the twelfth storey of the Admiral Francis Drake Hotel, corner of Hay
and Apple Streets, in Brooklyn. The man, who was about thirty-five
years old, registered at the hotel about a week ago, according to the
police, as C. Green. Police are of the opinion that this was an assumed
name. Pending identification, the body is being held at the King's
County Morgue.</blockquote>

<p>This, then, is news. Is it also the whole story, Admiral Drake? No!
Yet we do not supply the whole story--we who have known all the lights
and weathers of America--as Fox supplies it now:</p>

<p>Well, then, it's news, and it happened in your own hotel, brave
Admiral Drake. It didn't happen in the Penn-Pitt at Pittsburgh, nor the
Phil-Penn at Philadelphia, nor the York-Albany at Albany, nor the
Hudson-Troy at Troy, nor the Libya-Ritz at Libya Hill, nor the
Clay-Calhoun at Columbia, nor the Richmond-Lee at Richmond, nor the
George Washington at Easton, Pennsylvania, Canton, Ohio, Terre Haute,
Indiana, Danville, Virginia, Houston, Texas, and ninety-seven other
places; nor at the Abraham Lincoln at Springfield, Massachusetts,
Hartford, Connecticut, Wilmington, Delaware, Cairo, Illinois, Kansas
City, Missouri, Los Angeles, California, and one hundred and thirty-six
other towns; nor at the Andrew Jackson, the Roosevelt (Theodore or
Franklin--take your choice), the Jefferson Davis, the Daniel Webster,
the Stonewall Jackson, the U.S. Grant, the Commodore Vanderbilt, the
Waldorf-Astor, the Adams House, the Parker House, the Palmer House, the
Taft, the McKinley, the Emerson (Waldo or Bromo), the Harding, the
Coolidge, the Hoover, the Albert G. Fall, the Harry Daugherty, the
Rockefeller, the Harriman, the Carnegie or the Frick, the Christopher
Columbus or the Leif Ericsson, the Ponce-de-Leon or the Magellan, in
the remaining eight hundred and forty-three cities of America--but at
the Francis Drake, brave Admiral--your own hotel--so, of course, you'll
want to know what happened.</p>

<p>"An unidentified man"--well, then, this man was an American. "About
thirty-five years old" with "an assumed name"--well, then, call him C.
Green as he called himself ironically in the hotel register. C. Green,
the unidentified American, "fell or jumped," then, "yesterday at
noon...in Brooklyn"--worth nine lines of print in to-day's
<i>Times</i>--one of seven thousand who died yesterday upon this
continent--one of three hundred and fifty who died yesterday in this
very city (see dense, close columns of obituaries, page 15: begin with
"Aaronson", so through the alphabet to "Zorn"). C. Green came here "a
week ago"----</p>

<p>And came from where? From the deep South, or the Mississippi Valley,
or the Middle West? From Minneapolis, Bridgeport, Boston, or a little
town in Old Catawba? From Scranton, Toledo, St. Louis, or the desert
whiteness of Los Angeles? From the pine barrens of the Atlantic coastal
plain, or from the Pacific shore?</p>

<p>And so--was <i>what</i>, brave Admiral Drake? Had seen, felt, heard,
smelled, tasted--<i>what</i>? Had known--<i>what</i>?</p>

<p>Had known all our brutal violence of weather: the burned swelter of
July across the nation, the smell of the slow, rank river, the mud, the
bottom lands, the weed growth, and the hot, coarse, humid fragrance of
the corn. The kind that says: "Jesus, but it's hot!"--pulls off his
coat, and mops his face, and goes in shirt-sleeves in St. Louis, goes
to August's for a Swiss on rye with mustard, and a mug of beer. The
kind that says: "Damn! It's hot!" in South Carolina, slouches in
shirt-sleeves and straw hat down South Main Street, drops into Evans
Drug Store for a dope, says to the soda jerker: "Is it hot enough fer
you to-day, Jim?" The kind that reads in the paper of the heat, the
deaths, and the prostration, reads it with a certain satisfaction,
hangs on grimly day by day and loses sleep at night, can't sleep for
heat, is tired in the morning, says: "Jesus! It can't last for ever!"
as heat lengthens into August, and the nation gasps for breath, and the
green that was young in May now mottles, fades and bleaches, withers,
goes heat-brown. Will boast of coolness in the mountains, Admiral
Drake. "Always cool at night! May get a little warm around the middle
of the day, but you'll sleep with blankets every night."</p>

<p>Then summer fades and passes, and October comes. Will smell smoke
then, and feel an unsuspected sharpness, a thrill of nervous, swift
elation, a sense of sadness and departure. C. Green doesn't know the
reason, Admiral Drake, but lights slant and shorten in the afternoon,
there is a misty pollen of old gold in light at noon, a murky redness
in the lights of dusk, a frosty stillness, and the barking of the dogs;
the maples flame upon the hills, the gums are burning, bronze the oak
leaves and, the aspens yellow; then come the rains, the sodden
dead-brown of the fallen leaves, the smoke-stark branches--and November
comes.</p>

<p>Waiting for winter in the little towns, and winter comes. It is
really the same in big towns and the cities, too, with the bleak
enclosure of the winter multiplied. In the commerce of the day, engaged
and furious, then darkness, and the bleak monotony of "Where shall we
go? What shall we do?" The winter grips us, closes round each
house--the stark, harsh light encysts us--and C. Green walks the
streets. Sometimes hard lights burn on him, Admiral Drake, bleak faces
stream beneath the lights, amusement signs are winking. On Broadway,
the constant plaze of sterile lights; in little towns, no less, the
clustered raisins of hard light on Main Street. On Broadway, swarming
millions up to midnight; in little towns, hard lights and frozen
silence--no one, nothing, after ten o'clock. But in the hearts of C.
Greens everywhere, bleak boredom, undefined despair, and "Christ! Where
shall I go now? When will winter end?"</p>

<p>So longs for spring, and wishes it were Saturday, brave Admiral
Drake.</p>

<p>Saturday night arrives with the thing that we are waiting for. Oh,
it will come to-night; the thing that we have been expecting all our
lives will come to-night, on Saturday! 'On Saturday night across
America we are waiting for it, and ninety million Greens go moth-wise
to the lights to find it. Surely it will come to-night! So Green goes
out to find it, and he finds--hard lights again, saloons along Third
Avenue, or the Greek's place in a little town--and then hard whisky,
gin, and drunkenness, and brawls and fights and vomit.</p>

<p>Sunday morning, aching head.</p>

<p>Sunday afternoon, and in the cities the chop-suey signs wink on and
flash their sterile promises of unborn joy.</p>

<p>Sunday night, and the hard stars, and the bleak enclosures of our
wintry weather--the buildings of old rusty brick, in cold enclosed, the
fronts of old stark brown, the unpainted houses, the deserted
factories, wharves, piers, warehouses, and office buildings, the
tormented shabbiness of Sixth Avenues; and in the smaller towns, bleak
Main Streets, desolate with shabby store fronts and be-raisined
clusters of lamp standards, and in the residential streets of wooden
houses (dark by ten o'clock), the moaning of stark branches, the stiff
lights, limb-bepatterned, shaking at street corners. The light shines
there with wintry bleakness on the clapboard front and porch of a
shabby house where the policeman lives--blank and desolate upon the
stuffy, boxlike little parlour where the policeman's daughter amorously
receives--and <i>almost</i>--not <i>quite</i>--gives. Hot, fevered,
fearful, and insatiate, it is all too close to the cold street
light--too creaking, panting, flimsy-close to others in the flimsy
house--too close to the policeman's solid and slow-creaking tread--yet
somehow valiant, somehow strong, somehow triumphant over the stale
varnish of the little parlour, the nearness of the street, the light,
the creaking boughs, and papa's tread--somehow triumphant with hot
panting, with rose lips and tender tongue, white underleg and
tight-locked thighs--by these intimacies of fear and fragrant hot
desire will beat the ashen monotone of time and even the bleak and grey
duration of the winter out.</p>

<p>Does this surprise you, Admiral Drake?</p>

<p>"But Christ!"--Green leaves the house, his life is bitter with
desire, the stiff light creaks. "When will it end?" thinks Green. "When
will spring come?"</p>

<p>It comes at last unhoped for, after hoping, comes when least
expected, and when given up. In March there is a day that's almost
spring, and C. Green, strong with will to have it so, says: "Well, it's
here"--and it is gone like smoke. You can't look spring too closely in
the eye in March. Raw days return, and blown light, and gusty moanings
of the wind. Then April comes, and small, soaking rain. The air is wet
and raw and chilled, but with a smell of spring now, a smell of earth,
of grass exploding in small patches, here and there a blade, a bud, a
leaf. And spring comes, marvellous, for a day or two--"It's here!"
Green thinks. "It's here at last!"--and he is wrong again. It goes,
chill days and greyness and small, soaking rains return. Green loses
hope. "There is no spring!" he says. "You never get spring any more;
you jump from winter into summer--we'll have summer now and the hot
weather before you know it."</p>

<p>Then spring comes--explodes out of the earth in a green
radiance--comes up overnight! It's April twenty-eighth--the tree there
in the city backyard is smoke-yellow, feathered with the striplings of
young leaf! It's April twenty-ninth--the leaf, the yellow, and the
smoke have thickened overnight. April thirtieth--you can watch it grow
and thicken with your eye! Then May the first--the tree's in leaf now,
almost full and dense, young, feather-fresh! The whole spring has
exploded from the earth!</p>

<p>All's explosive with us really, Admiral Drake--spring, the brutal
summer, frost, October, February in Dakota with fifty-one below, spring
floods, two hundred drowning along Ohio bottoms, in Missouri, in New
England, all through Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Tennessee. Spring shot
at us overnight, and everything with us is vast, explosive, floodlike.
A few hundred dead in floods, a hundred in a wave of heat, twelve
thousand in a year by murder, thirty thousand with the motor-car--it
all means nothing here. Floods like this would drown out France; death
like this would plunge England in black mourning; but in America a few
thousand C. Greens more or less, drowned, murdered, killed by
motor-cars, or dead by jumping out of windows on their heads--well, it
just means nothing to us--the next flood, or next week's crop of death
and killings, wash it out. We do things on a large scale, Admiral
Drake.</p>

<p>The tar-smell in the streets now, children shouting, and the smell
of earth; the sky shell-blue and faultless, a sapphire sparkle
everywhere; and in the air the brave stick-candy whippings of a flag.
C. Green thinks of the baseball games, the raw-hide arm of Lefty Grove,
the resilient crack of ashwood on the horsehide ball, the waiting
pockets of the well-oiled mitts, the warm smell of the bleachers, the
shouted gibes of shirt-sleeved men, the sprawl and monotone of inning
after inning. (Baseball's a dull game, really; that's the reason that
it is so good. We do not love the game so much as we love the sprawl
and drowse and shirt-sleeved apathy of it.) On Saturday afternoon, C.
Green goes out to the ball park and sits there in the crowd, awaiting
the sudden sharpness and the yell of crisis. Then the game ends and the
crowd flows out across the green turf of the playing-field. Sunday,
Green spends the day out in the country in his flivver, with a
girl.</p>

<p>Then summer comes again, heat-blazing summer, humid, murked with
mist, sky-glazed with brutal weariness--and C. Green mops his face and
sweats and says: "Jesus! Will it never end?"</p>

<p>This, then, is C. Green "thirty-five years old"--"unidentified"--and
an American. In what way an American? In what way different from the
men <i>you</i> knew, old Drake?</p>

<p>When the ships bore home again and Cape St. Vincent blazed in
Spaniard's eye--or when old Drake was returning with his men, beating
coastwise from strange seas abreast, past the Scilly Isles towards the
slant of evening fields, chalk cliffs, the harbour's arms, the town's
sweet cluster and the spire--where was Green?</p>

<p>When, in red-oak thickets at the break of day, coon-skinned, the
huntsmen of the wilderness lay for bear, heard arrows rattling in the
laurel leaves, the bullets' whining <i>plunk</i>, and waited with
cocked musket by the tree--where was Green?</p>

<p>Or when, with strong faces turning towards the setting sun,
hawk-eyed and Indian-visaged men bore gun-stocks on the western trails
and sternly heard the fierce war-whoops around the Painted
Buttes--where, then, was Green?</p>

<p>Was never there with Drake's men in the evening when the sails stood
in from the Americas! Was never there beneath the Spaniard's swarthy
eye at Vincent's Cape! Was never there in the red-oak thicket in the
morning! Was never there to hear the war-cries round the Painted
Buttes!</p>

<p>No, no. He was no voyager of unknown seas, no pioneer of western
trails. He was life's little man, life's nameless cypher, life's
man-swarm atom, life's American--and now he lies disjected and exploded
on a street in Brooklyn!</p>

<p>He was a dweller in mean streets, was Green, a man-mote in the
jungle of the city, a resident of grimy steel and stone, a mole who
burrowed in rusty brick, a stunned spectator of enormous
salmon-coloured towers, hued palely with the morning. He was a renter
of shabby wooden houses in a little town, an owner of a raw new
bungalow on the outskirts of the town. He was a waker in bleak streets
at morning, an alarm-clock watcher, saying: "Jesus, I'll be late."--a
fellow who took short cuts through the corner lot, behind the
advertising signs; a fellow used to concrete horrors of hot day and
blazing noon; a man accustomed to the tormented hodge-podge of our
architectures, used to broken pavements, ash-cans, shabby store fronts,
dull green paint, the elevated structure, grinding traffic, noise, and
streets be-tortured with a thousand bleak and dismal signs. He was
accustomed to the gas tanks going out of town, he was an atom of
machinery in an endless flow, going, stopping, going to the winking of
the lights; he tore down concrete roads on Sundays, past the hot-dog
stands and filling-stations; he would return at darkness; hunger lured
him to the winking splendour of chop-suey signs; and midnight found him
in The Coffee Pot, to prowl above a mug of coffee, tear a coffee-cake
in fragments, and wear away the slow grey ash of time and boredom with
other men in grey hats and with skins of tallow-grey, at Joe the
Greek's.</p>

<p>C. Green could read (which Drake could not), but not too accurately;
could write, too (which the Spaniard couldn't), but not too well. C.
Green had trouble over certain words, spelled them out above the coffee
mug at midnight, with a furrowed brow, slow-shaping lips, and "Jesus!"
when news stunned him--for he read the news. Preferred the news with
pictures, too, girls with voluptuous legs crossed sensually, dresses
above the knees, and plump dolls' faces full of vacant lechery. Green
liked news "hot"--not as Fox knows it, not subtly sniffing with
strange-scornful nostrils for the news <i>behind</i> the news--but
straight from the shoulder--socko!--biff!--straight off the griddle,
with lots of mustard, shapely legs, roadside wrecks and mutilated
bodies, gangsters' molls and gunmen's hideouts, tallow faces of the
night that bluntly stare at flashlight lenses--this and talk of
"heart-balm", "love-thief", "sex-hijacker"--all of this liked
Green.</p>

<p>Yes, Green liked the news--and now, a bit of news himself (nine
lines of print in <i>Times</i>), has been disjected and exploded on a
Brooklyn pavement!</p>

<p>Well, such was our friend, C. Green, who read, but not too well; and
wrote, but not too easily; who smelled, but not too strongly; felt, but
not too deeply; saw, but not too clearly--yet had smelled the tar in
May, smelled the slow, rank yellow of the rivers, and the clean, coarse
corn; had seen the slants of evening on the hill-flanks in the Smokies,
and the bronze swell of the earth, the broad, deep red of Pennsylvania
barns, proud-proportioned and as dominant across the fields as bulls;
had felt the frost and silence in October; had heard the whistles of
the train wail back in darkness, and the horns of New Year's Eve,
and--"Jesus! There's another year gone by! What now?"</p>

<p>No Drake was he, no Spaniard, no coon-skin cap, no strong face
burning west. Yet, in some remote and protoplasmic portion, he was a
little of each of these. A little Scotch, perhaps, was Green, a little
Irish, English, Spanish even, and some German--a little of each part,
all compacted and exploded into nameless atom of America!</p>

<p>No. Green--poor little Green--was not a man like Drake. He was just
a cinder out of life--for the most part, a thinker of base thoughts, a
creature of unsharpened, coarse perceptions. He was meagre in the hips,
he did not have much juice or salt in him. Drake gnawed the beef from
juicy bones in taverns, drank tankards of brown ale, swore salty curses
through his whiskers, wiped his mouth with the back of his hard hand,
threw the beef bone to his dog, and pounded with his tankard for more
ale. Green ate in cafeterias, prowled at midnight over coffee and a
doughnut or a sugar-coated bun, went to the chop-suey joint on Saturday
nights and swallowed chow mein, noodle soup, and rice. Green's mouth
was mean and thin and common, it ran to looseness and a snarl; his skin
was grey and harsh and dry; his eyes were dull and full of fear. Drake
was self-contained: the world his oyster, seas his pastures, mighty
distances his wings. His eyes were sea-pale (like the eyes of Fox); his
ship was England. Green had no ship, he had a motor-car, and tore down
concrete roads on Sunday, and halted with the lights against him with
the million other cinders hurtling through hot space. Green walked on
level concrete sidewalks and on pavements grey, through hot and grimy
streets past rusty tenements. Drake set his sails against the west, he
strode the buoyant, sea-washed decks, he took the Spaniard and his
gold, and at the end he stood in to the sweet enfoldments of the spire,
the clustered town, the emerald fields that slope to Plymouth
harbour--then Green came!</p>

<p>We who never saw brave Drake can have no difficulty conjuring up an
image of the kind of man he was. With equal ease we can imagine the
bearded Spaniard, and almost hear his swarthy oaths. But neither Drake
nor Spaniard could ever have imagined Green. Who could have foreseen
him, this cypher of America, exploded now upon a street in
Brooklyn?</p>

<p>Behold him, Admiral Drake! Observe the scene now! Listen to the
people! Here is something strange as the Armadas, the gold-laden
cargoes of the bearded Spaniards, the vision of unfound Americas!</p>

<p>What do you see here, Admiral Drake?</p>

<p>Well, first, a building--your own hotel--such a building as the folk
of Plymouth never saw. A great block of masonry, pale-hued,
grimy-white, fourteen storeys tall, stamped in an unvarying pattern
with many windows. Sheeted glass below, the store front piled with
medicines and toilet articles, perfumes, cosmetics, health
contrivances. Within, a soda fountain, Admiral Drake. The men in white
with monkey caps, soda jerkers sullen with perpetual overdriven
irritation. Beneath the counter, pools of sloppy water, filth, and
unwashed dishes. Across the counter, Jewesses with fat, rouged lips
consuming ice-cream sodas and pimento sandwiches.</p>

<p>Outside upon the concrete sidewalk lies the form of our exploded
friend, C. Green. A crowd has gathered round--taxi-drivers, passersby,
hangers-on about the subway station, people working in the
neighbourhood, and the police. No one has dared to touch exploded Green
as yet--they stand there in a rapt and fascinated circle, looking at
him.</p>

<p>Not much to look at either, Admiral Drake; not even those who trod
your gory decks would call the sight a pretty one. Our friend has
landed on his head--"taken a nose dive", as we say--and smashed his
brains out at the iron base of the second lamp-post from the corner.
(It is the same lamp-post as heretofore described, to be found
throughout America--a "standard", standardised, supporting five hard
grapes of frosted glass.)</p>

<p>So here Green lies, on the concrete sidewalk all disjected. No head
is left, the head is gone now, head's exploded; only brains are left.
The brains are pink, and almost bloodless, Admiral Drake. (There's not
much blood here--we shall tell you why.) But brains exploded are
somewhat like pale sausage meat, fresh-ground. Brains are stuck hard to
the lamp-post, too; there is a certain driven emphasis about them, as
if they had been shot hydraulically out of a force-hose against the
post.</p>

<p>The head, as we have said, is gone completely; a few fragments of
the skull are scattered round--but of the face, the features,
forehead--nothing! They have all been blown <i>out</i>, as by some
inner explosion. Nothing is left but the back of the skull, which
curiously remains, completely hollowed out and vacant, and curved over,
like the rounded handle of a walking-stick.</p>

<p>The body, five feet eight or nine of it, of middling weight, is
lying--we were going to say "face downwards"; had we not better say
"stomach downwards"?--on the sidewalk. It is well-dressed, too, in
cheap, neatly pressed, machine-made clothes: tan shoes and socks with a
clocked pattern, suit of a light texture, brownish-red in hue, a neat
canary-coloured shirt with attached collar--obviously C. Green had a
nice feeling for proprieties! As for the body itself, save for a
certain indefinable and curiously "disjected" quality, one could
scarcely tell that every bone in it is broken. The hands are still
spread out, half-folded and half-clenched, with a still-warm and
startling eloquence of recent life. (It happened just four minutes
ago!)</p>

<p>Well, where's the blood, then, Drake? You're used to blood; you'd
like to know. Well, you've heard of casting bread upon the waters,
Drake, and having it return--but never yet, I'll vow, of casting blood
upon the streets--and having it run away--and then come back to you!
But here it comes now, down the street--down Apple Street, round the
corner into Hay, across the street now towards C. Green, the lamp-post,
and the crowd!--a young Italian youth, blunt-featured, low-browed, and
bewildered, his black eyes blank with horror, tongue mumbling thickly,
arm held firmly by a policeman, suit and shirt all drenched with blood,
and face be-spattered with it! A stir of sudden interest in the crowd,
sharp nudges, low-toned voices whispering:</p>

<p>"Here he is! Th' guy that 'got it'!...Sure, that's him--you know
him, that Italian kid that works inside in the news-stand--he was
standin' <i>deh</i> beside the post! Sure, <i>that's</i> the
guy!--talkin' to another guy--he got it all! <i>That's</i> the reason
you didn't see more blood--<i>this</i> guy got it!--Sure! The guy just
missed him by six inches!--Sure! I'm tellin' you I <i>saw</i> it, ain't
I? I looked up an' saw him in the air! He'd a hit this guy, but when he
saw that he was goin' to hit the lamp-post, he put out his hands an'
tried to keep away! <i>That's</i> the reason that he didn't hit this
guy!...But this guy heard him when he hit, an' turned round--and
zowie!--he got all of it right in his face!"</p>

<p>And another, whispering and nudging, nodding towards the
horror-blank, thick-mumbling Italian boy: "Jesus! Look at th' guy, will
yuh!...He don't know what he's doing!...He don't know yet what happened
to him!...Sure! He got it <i>all</i>. I tell yuh! He was standin' deh
beside the post, wit a package undehneath one ahm--an' when it
happened--when he got it--he just stahted runnin'...He don't know yet
what's happened!...That's what I'm tellin' yuh--th' guy just stahted
runnin' when he got it."</p>

<p>And one policeman (to another): "...Sure, I yelled to Pat to stop
him. He caught up with him at Borough Hall...He just kept on
runnin'--he don't know yet what happened to him."</p>

<p>And the Italian youth, thick-mumbling: "...Jeez! W'at
happened?...Jeez!...I was standin' talkin' to a guy--I heard it
hit...Jeez!...W'at happened, anyway?...I got it all oveh
me!...Jeez!...I just stahted runnin'...Jeez! I'm sick!"</p>

<p>Voices: "Here, take 'im into the drug-store!...Wash 'im off!...That
guy needs a shot of liquor!...Sure! Take him into the drug-stoeh
<i>deh!</i>...<i>They'll</i> fix him up!"</p>

<p>The plump, young, rather effeminate, but very intelligent young Jew
who runs the news-stand in the corridor, talking to everyone round him,
excitedly and indignantly: "...Did I <i>see</i> it? Listen! I saw
<i>everything!</i> I was coming across the street, looked up, and saw
him in the air!...<i>See</i> it?...<i>Listen!</i> If someone had taken
a big ripe water-melon and dropped it on the street from the twelfth
floor you'd have some idea what it was like!...<i>See</i> it! I'll tell
the world I saw it! I don't want to see anything like <i>that</i>
again!" Then excitedly, with a kind of hysterical indignation: "Shows
no consideration for other people, that's all <i>I've</i> got to say!
If a man is going to do a thing like that, why does he pick a place
like <i>this</i>--one of the busiest corners in Brooklyn?...How did
<i>he</i> know he wouldn't hit someone? Why, if that boy had been
standing six inches nearer to the post, he'd have killed him, as sure
as you live!...And here he does it right in front of all these people
who have to look at it! It shows he had no consideration for other
people! A man who'd do a thing like that..."</p>

<p>(Alas, poor Jew! As if C. Green, now past considering, had
considered nice "considerations".)</p>

<p>A taxi-driver, impatiently: "That's what I'm tellin' yuh!...I
watched him for <i>five</i> minutes before he jumped. He crawled out on
the window-sill an' stood there for five minutes, makin' up his
mind!...Sure, I saw him! Lots of people saw him!" Impatiently,
irritably:-"Why didn't we <i>do</i> somethin' to stop him? F'r Chri'
sake, what was there to do? A guy who'd do a thing like that is nuts to
start with! You don't think he'd listen to anything <i>we</i> had to
say, do you?...Sure, we <i>did</i> yell at him!...Jesus!...We was
almost <i>afraid</i> to yell at him--we made motions to him to get
back--tried to hold his attention while the cops sneaked round the
corner into the hotel...Sure, the cops got there just a second after he
jumped--I don't know if he jumped when he heard 'em comin', or what
happened, but Christ!--he stood there gettin' ready for five minutes
while we watched!"</p>

<p>And a stocky little Czech-Bohemian, who works in the
delicatessen-fruit store on the corner, one block down: "Did I
<i>hear</i> it! Say, you could have heard it for six blocks! Sure!
<i>Everybody</i> heard it! The minute that I heard it, I knew what had
happened, too! I come runnin'!"</p>

<p>People press and shuffle in the crowd. A man comes round the corner,
presses forward to get a better look, runs into a-little fat,
baldheaded man in front of him who is staring at the Thing with a pale,
sweating, suffering, fascinated face, by accident knocks off the
little' fat man's straw hat. The new straw hat hits the pavement dryly,
the little fat, bald-headed man scrambles for it, clutches it, and
turns round on the man who has knocked it off, both of them stammering
frantic apologies:</p>

<p>"Oh, excuse me!...'Scuse me!...'Scuse me!...Sorry!"</p>

<p>"Quite all right...All right!...All right."</p>

<p>Observe now, Admiral, with what hypnotic concentration the people
are examining the grimy-white facade of your hotel. Watch their faces
and expressions. Their eyes go travelling upwards slowly--up--up--up.
The building seems to widen curiously, to be distorted, to flare out
wedgelike till it threatens to annihilate the sky, overwhelm the will,
and crush the spirit. (These optics, too, American, Admiral Drake.) The
eyes continue on past storey after storey up the wall until they
finally arrive and come to rest with focal concentration on that single
open window twelve floors up. It is no jot different from all the other
windows, but now the vision of the crowd is fastened on it with a fatal
and united interest. And after staring at it fixedly, the eyes come
travelling slowly down again--down--down--down--the faces strained a
little, mouths all slightly puckered as if something set the teeth on
edge--and slowly, with fascinated measurement--down--down--down--until
the eyes reach sidewalk, lamp-post, and--the Thing again.</p>

<p>The pavement finally halts all, stops all, answers all. It is the
American pavement, Admiral Drake, our universal city sidewalk, a wide,
hard stripe of grey-white cement, blocked accurately with dividing
lines. It is the hardest, coldest, cruellest, most impersonal pavement
in the world: all of the indifference, the atomic desolation, the
exploded nothingness of one hundred million nameless "Greens" is in
it.</p>

<p>In Europe, Drake, we find worn stone, all hollowed out and rubbed to
rounded edges. For centuries the unknown lives of men now buried
touched and wore this stone, and when we see it something stirs within
our hearts, and something strange and dark and passionate moves our
souls, and--"They were here!" we say.</p>

<p>Not so, the streets, the sidewalks, the paved places of America. Has
<i>man</i> been here? No. Only unnumbered nameless Greens have swarmed
and passed here, and none has left a mark.</p>

<p>Did ever the eye go seaward here with searching for the crowded
sail, with longing for the strange and unknown coasts of Spain? Did
ever beauty here come home to the heart and eyes? Did ever, in the
thrusting crowd, eye look to eye, and face to face, and heart to heart,
and know the moment of their meeting--stop and pause, and be oblivious
in this place, and make one spot of worn pavement sacred stone? You
won't believe it, Admiral Drake, but it is so--these things <i>have</i>
happened on the pavements of America. But, as you see yourself, they
have not left their mark.</p>

<p>You, old Drake, when last your fellow townsmen saw you at the
sailing of the ships, walked with the crowd along the quay, past the
spire and cluster of the town, down to the cool lap of the water; and
from your deck, as you put out, you watched the long, white, fading arm
of your own coast. And in the town that you had left were streets still
haunted by your voice. There was your worn tread upon the pavement,
there the tavern table dented where you banged your tankard down. And
in the evening, when the ships were gone, men waited for your
return.</p>

<p>But no return is here among us in America. Here are no streets still
haunted by departed men. Here is no street at all, as you knew streets.
Here are just our cement Mobways, unannealed by time! No place in
Mobway bids you pause, old Drake. No spot in Mob-way bids you hold your
mind a moment in reflection, saying: "He was here!" No square of
concrete slab says: "Stay, for I was built by men." Mobway never knew
the hand of man, as your streets did. Mobway was laid down by great
machines, for one sole purpose--to unimpede and hurry up the passing of
the feet.</p>

<p>Where did Mobway come from? What produced it?</p>

<p>It came from the same place where all our mobways come from--from
Standard Concentrated Production Units of America, No. 1. This is where
all our streets, sidewalks, and lamp-posts (like the one on which
Green's brains are spattered) come from, where all our white-grimy
bricks (like those of which your hotel is constructed) come from, where
the red facades of our standard-unit tobacco stores (like the one
across the street) come from, where our motor-cars come from, where our
drug-stores and our drug-store windows and displays come from, where
our soda fountains (complete, with soda jerkers attached) come from,
where our cosmetics, toilet articles, and the fat, rouged lips of our
Jewesses come from, where our soda water, slops and syrups, steamed
spaghetti, ice-cream, and pimento sandwiches come from, where our
clothes, our hats (neat, standard stamps of grey), our faces (also
stamps of grey, not always neat), our language, conversation,
sentiments, feelings, and opinions come from. All these things are made
for us by Standard Concentrated Production Units of America, No. 1.</p>

<p>So here we are, then, Admiral Drake. You see the street, the
sidewalk, the front of your hotel, the constant stream of motor-cars,
the drug-store and the soda fountain, the tobacco store, the traffic
lights, the cops in uniform, the people streaming in and out of the
subway, the rusty, pale-hued jungle of the buildings, old and new, high
and low. There is no better place to see it, Drake. For this is
Brooklyn--which means ten thousand streets and blocks like this one.
Brooklyn, Admiral Drake, is the Standard Concentrated Chaos No. 1 of
the Whole Universe. That is to say, it has no size, no shape, no heart,
no joy, no hope, no aspiration, no centre, no eyes, no soul, no
purpose, no direction, and no anything--just Standard Concentrated
Units everywhere--exploding in all directions for an unknown number of
square miles like a completely triumphant Standard Concentrated Blot
upon the Face of the Earth. And here, right in the middle--no, that is
wrong, for Standard Concentrated Blots don't have a middle--but, if not
in the middle, at least right slap-bang out in the open, upon a minute
portion of his magnificent Standard Concentrated Blot, where all the
Standard Concentrated Blotters can stare at him, and with the brains
completely out of him----</p>

<p>--Lies Green!</p>

<p>And this is bad--most bad--oh, <i>very</i> bad--and should not be
allowed! For, as our young Jewish friend has just indignantly
proclaimed, it "shows no consideration for other people"--which means,
for other Standard Concentrated Blotters. Green has no right to go
falling in this fashion in a public place. He has no right to take unto
himself any portion of this Standard Concentrated Blot, however small.
He has no business <i>being</i> where he is at all. A Standard
Concentrated Blotter is not supposed to <i>be</i> places, but to
<i>go</i> places.</p>

<p>You see, dear Admiral, this is not a street to amble in, to ride
along, to drift through. It is a channel--in the words of the Standard
Concentrated Blotter-Press, an "artery". This means that it is not a
place where one drives, but a place where one is driven--not really a
street at all, but a kind of tube for a projectile, a kind of groove
for millions and millions of projectiles, all driven past incessantly,
all beetling onwards, bearing briefly white slugged blurs of driven
flesh.</p>

<p>As for the sidewalk, this Standard Concentrated Mobway is not a
place to walk on, really. (Standard Concentrated Blotters have
forgotten how to walk.) It is a place to swarm on, to weave on, to
thrust and dodge on, to scurry past on, to crowd by on. It is not a
place to stand on, either. One of the earliest precepts in a
Concentrated Blotter's life is: "Move on there! Where th' hell d'you
think you are, anyway--in a cow pasture?" And, most certainly, it is
not a place to lie on, to sprawl out on.</p>

<p>But look at Green! Just <i>look</i> at him! No wonder the Jewish
youth is angry with him!</p>

<p>Green has wilfully and deliberately violated every Standard
Concentrated Principle of Blotterdom. He has not only gone and dashed
his brains out, but he has done it in a public place--upon a piece of
Standard Concentrated Mobway. He has messed up the sidewalk, messed up
another Standard Concentrated Blotter, stopped traffic, taken people
from their business, upset the nerves of his fellow Blotters--and now
<i>lies</i> there, all <i>sprawled</i> out, in a place where he has no
right to <i>be</i>. And, to make his crime unpardonable, C. Green
has----</p>

<p>--Come to Life!</p>

<p>Consider <i>that</i>, old Drake! We can understand some measure of
<i>your</i> strangeness, because we heard you swearing in the tavern
and saw your sails stand to the west. Can you now do the same for
<i>us?</i> Consider strangeness, Drake--and look at Green! For you have
heard it said by your own countryman, and in your living generation:
"The times have been that, when the brains were out, the man would
die." But now, old Drake, what hath Time wrought? There is surely here
some strangeness in us that you could never have foretold. For the
brains are "out" now--and the man has----</p>

<p>--Come to Life!</p>

<p>What's that, Admiral? You do not understand it? Small wonder, though
it's really very simple:</p>

<p>For just ten minutes since, C. Green was a Concentrated Blotter like
the rest of us. Ten minutes since, he, too, might hurry in and out of
the subway, thrust and scurry on the pavement, go hurtling past with
whited blur in one of our beetles of machinery, a nameless atom,
cypher, cinder, swarming with the rest of us, just another "guy" like a
hundred million other "guys". But now, observe him! No longer is he
just "another guy"--already he has become a "special guy"--has become
"<i>The</i> Guy". C. Green at last has turned into a--<i>Man</i>!</p>

<p>Four hundred years ago, brave Admiral Drake, if we had seen you
lying on your deck, your bronze gone pale and cold, imbrued in your own
blood, and hewn to the middle by the Spaniards' steel, we could have
understood that, for there was <i>blood</i> in you. But Green--this
Concentrated Blotter of ten minutes since--made in our own image,
shaped in our own dust, compacted of the same grey stuff of which our
own lives are compacted, and filled, we thought, with the same Standard
Concentration of embalming fluid that fills <i>our</i> veins--oh,
Drake, we did not know the fellow had such <i>blood</i> in him! We
could not have thought it was so red, so rich, and so abundant!</p>

<p>Poor, shabby, and corrupted cypher! Poor, nameless, and exploded
atom! Poor little guy! He fills us Concentrated Blotters of the
Universe with fear, with shame, with awe, with pity, and with
terror--for we see ourselves in him. If he was a man with blood in him,
then so are we! If he, in the midst of his always-driven life, could at
last be driven to this final and defiant gesture of refusal to remain a
Concentrated Blotter, then we, too, might be driven to a point of equal
desperation! And there are other methods of defiance, other ways of
ultimate refusal, other means of exercising one's last-remaining right
of manhood--and some of them are no less terrifying to contemplate than
this! So our fascinated eyes go up and up, past floor after floor of
Standard Concentrated brick, and fasten on the open window where he
stood--and suddenly we crane our necks along the ridges of our collars,
look away with constricted faces, and taste the acrid bitterness of
steel upon our lips!</p>

<p>It is too hard, and not to be endured--to know that little Green,
speaking our own tongue and stuffed with our own stuffing, had yet
concealed in him some secret, dark, and frightful thing more terrible
than anything that we have ever known--that he bore within him some
black and hideous horror, some depth of madness or of courage, and
could stand <i>there</i>--upon the sheer and nauseating verge of that
grey window-ledge for five full minutes--and know the thing he was
about to do--and tell himself he <i>must</i> now!--that he <i>had</i>
to!--that the compulsion of every horror-fascinated eye down in the
gulf below had <i>now</i> made escape impossible--and then, horror-sick
past all regeneration, see, too, before he jumped, his fall, the
downward-hurtling plunge, and his own exploded body--feel the bones
crack and fly apart, and the brutal obliteration of the instant when
his brains would shoot out against the lamp-post--and even while his
soul drew back from that sheer verge of imagined terror, shame, and
unutterable self-loathing, crying: "I cannot do it!"--then jumped!</p>

<p>And <i>we</i>, brave Drake? We try to see it, but we cannot see. We
try to fathom it, but we cannot plunge. We try to comprehend the hell
of hells, the hundred lives of horror, madness, anguish, and despair
that were exhausted <i>in five minutes</i> by that shabby creature
crouched there on the window-ledge. But we cannot understand, or look
at it any longer. It is too hard, too hard, and not to be endured. We
turn away with nausea, hollowness, blind fear, and unbelief within
us.</p>

<p>One man stares, cranes his neck, wets his lips, and whispers:
"Jesus! To do a thing like that takes <i>guts!</i>"</p>

<p>Another, harshly: "Nah! It don't take guts! A guy who'd do a thing
like that is crazy! He don't know what he's doin' to begin with!"</p>

<p>And others, doubtfully, half-whispering, with eyes focused on the
ledge: "But Jesus!"</p>

<p>A taxi-driver, turning away and moving towards his cab, with an
attempt at casual indifference that does not ring entirely true: "Oh,
well! Just another guy, I guess!"</p>

<p>Then one man, turning to his companion with a little puckered smile:
"Well, what about it, Al? You still feel like eating?"</p>

<p>And his companion, quietly: "Eating, hell! I feel like two or three
stiff shots of rye! Come on, let's go round to Steve's!"</p>

<p>They go. The Concentrated Blotters of the World cannot abide it.
They must somehow blot it out.</p>

<p>So a policeman comes round the corner now with an old tarpaulin,
with which he covers the No-Head. The crowd remains. Then the green
wagon from the morgue. The Thing, tarpaulin and all, is pushed into it.
It drives away. A policeman with thick-soled boots scuffs and pushes
skull-pieces and brain-fragments into the gutter. Someone comes with
sawdust, strews it. Someone from the drugstore with formaldehyde.
Later, someone with a hose and water. From the subway come an
adolescent boy and girl with the hard, tough faces of the city; they
walk past it, deliberately and arrogantly step among it, look at the
lamp-post, then at each other, and laugh!</p>

<p>All's over now, all's gone, the crowd's departed. Something else
remains. It cannot be forgotten. There's a sick, humid smell upon the
air, what was light and clear and crystal has gone out of day, and
something thick and glutinous--half taste, half smell, and all
impalpable--remains upon your tongue.</p>

<p>There would have been a time and place for such a thing, brave
Admiral Drake, if he, our fellow Green, had only fallen as a hollow man
and landed dryly, or if he had opened to disperse a grey embalming
fluid in the gutter. It would have been all right if he had just been
blown away like an old paper, or if he had been swept aside like
remnants of familiar litter, and then subsumed into the Standard
Concentrated stuff from which he came. But C. Green would not have it
so. He exploded to drench our common substance of viscous grey with the
bright indecency of blood, to resume himself from number, to become
before our eyes a Man, and to identify a single spot of all our general
Nothingness with the unique passion, the awful terror, and the dignity
of Death.</p>

<p>So, Admiral Drake--"an unidentified man fell 'or jumped yesterday at
noon" from a window of your own hotel. That was the news. Now you've
had the story.</p>

<p>We are "the hollow men, the hollow men"? Brave Admiral, do not be
too sure.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="chapter4-30"></a>30. The Anodyne</h2>

<p>Fox read it instantly, the proud nose sniffing upwards sharply--"man
fell or jumped...Admiral Francis Drake Hotel...Brooklyn." The sea-pale
eyes took it in at once, and went on to more important things.</p>

<p>Fox was cold, then? Hard? Selfish? Lacking in understanding?
Unsympathetic? Unimaginative? By no means.</p>

<p>Could not have known Green, then? Was too much the patrician to know
Green? Was too high, too rare, too subtle, too fine-fibred to know
Green? None of these.</p>

<p>Fox knew everything, or almost everything. (If there's a lack here,
we will smell it out.) Fox had been born with everything, and had
learned much, yet his learning had not made him mad, or ever blunted
the keen blade of knowing. He saw all things as they were: had never
(in his mind and heart) called man a "white man" yet, because Fox saw
man was not "white man"--man was pink man tinged with sallow, man was
sallow tinged with grey, man was pink-brown, red-bronze, or
white-red-sallow, but not white.</p>

<p>So Fox (in mind and heart) would call it as it was. This was the
boy's straight eye. Yet his clarities were obscured for other men. His
straightness was thought cunning by crude-cunning rogues, his warmth
seemed ice to all the hearty-false, and to the false-sincere Fox was a
twister. Not one of these things was true of him.</p>

<p>Fox knew Green all right--knew him better than we, the Concentrated
Blotters of Green's ilk. For, being of the ilk, we grow confused,
struggle with Green (so with ourselves), argue, debate, deny, are
tarred with the same brush, and so lose judgment.</p>

<p>Not so, Fox. Not of Green's ilk, yet was he still of the whole
family of earth. Fox knew at once that Green had blood in him. Fox
placed him instantly: saw sky above him, Admiral Drake Hotel behind
him, lamp-post, pavement, people, Brooklyn corner, cops, rouged
Jewesses, the motor-cars, the subway entrance, and exploded
brains--and, had he been there, would have said in a low, somewhat
puzzled, and abstracted tone:</p>

<p>"Oh...I see."</p>

<p><i>Would</i> have seen, too, my mad masters; never doubt it. Would
have seen clearly and seen whole, without our agony, without confusion,
without struggling with the surface of each brick, each square inch of
concrete pavement, each scale of rust upon the fire-escapes, the
raw-green paint of the lamp-post, the sterile red-front brightness of
the cigar store, the shapes of windows, ledges, cornices, and doorways,
the way the shops were set into old houses along the street, all the
heart-sick ugliness exploded into the nothingness of Brooklyn. Fox
would have seen it instantly, without having to struggle to see all,
know all, hold all clearly, singly, permanently, in the burning crystal
of the brain.</p>

<p>And if Fox had lived in Brooklyn, he would have got much else as
well--got it clear and straight--while we were trying to make our
maddened ears spread out like funnels to absorb it--every whispered
word in Flatbush, every rhythmic-creaking spring in the back bedrooms
of whore's Sand Street (by old yellow shades concealed), every barker's
cry in Coney, all the jargons of each tenement from Red Hook to
Brownsville. Yes, while we wrestled with our five senses there in
Jungletown, our tormented brain caught in the brutal chaos of "Gewirr!
Gewirr!"--Fox would have got it all, without madness, agony, or the
fevered eye, and would have murmured:</p>

<p>"Oh...I see."</p>

<p>Wherever he was, Fox was one to get the little things--the little,
most important things that tell you everything. He never picked a
little thing because it was a little thing, to show he was a devilish
cunning, subtle, rare, and most aesthetic fellow: he picked a little
thing because it was the <i>right</i> thing--and he never missed.</p>

<p>Fox was a great fox, and a genius. He was no little Pixy of the
Aesthetes. He did not write nine-page reviews on "How Chaplin Uses
Hands in Latest Picture"--how it really was not slap-stick, but the
tragedy of Lear in modern clothes; or on how Enters enters; or on how
Crane's poetry can only be defined, reviewed, and generally exposited
in terms of mathematical formulae--ahem! ahem, now!--as:</p>

<p>(Bring on the Revolution, Comrades; it is Time!)</p>

<p>Fox did not go round making discoveries nine years after Boob McNutt
had made them. He didn't find out that Groucho was funny seven years
too late, and then inform the public <i>why</i> he was. He did not
write: "The opening <i>Volte</i> of the Ballet is the historic method
amplified in history, the production of historic fullness without the
literary clich&eacute; of the historic spate." He had no part in any of
the fine horse-manure with which we have allowed ourselves to be bored,
maddened, whiff-sniffed, hound-and-hornered, nationed, new-republicked,
dialled, spectatored, mercuried, storied, anvilled, new-massed,
new-yorkered, vogued, vanity-faired, timed, broomed, transitioned, and
generally shat upon by the elegant, refined, and snobified Concentrated
Blotters of the Arts. He had nothing to do with any of the doltish
gibberings, obscene quackeries, phoney passions, and six-months-long
religions of fools, joiners, and fashion-apes a trifle brighter and
quicker on the uptake than the fools, joiners, and fashion-apes they
prey upon. He was none of your little frankypanky, seldesey-weldesey,
cowley-wowley, tatesy-watesy, hicksy-picksy, wilsony-pilsony,
jolasy-wolasy, steiny-weiny, goldy-woldly, sneer-puss fellows. Neither,
in more conventional guise, was he one of your groupy-croupy,
cliquey-triquey, meachy-teachy devotobloato wire-pullers and
back-scratchers of the world.</p>

<p>No, Fox was none of these. He looked at the whole thing, whatever it
was, and got it straight, said slowly: "Oh...I see," then like a fox
would begin to pick up things round the edges. An eye here, a nose
there, a cleft of lip, a length of chin elsewhere--and suddenly, with
the frame of a waiter's face, he would see the grave, thought-lonely
visage of Erasmus. Fox would turn away reflectively and drink his
drink, glance casually from time to time as the man approached him,
catch his coat lapels and turn, stare fixedly at the waiter's face
again, turn back to the table, turn again and stare, bend over, staring
right up into the waiter's face:</p>

<p>The waiter, troubled now, and smiling doubtfully: "Sir?...Is there
anything wrong, sir?"</p>

<p>Fox, slowly, almost in a whisper: "Did you ever hear
of--Erasmus?"</p>

<p>And the waiter, still smiling, but more doubtfully than ever: "No
sir."</p>

<p>And Fox, turning away and whispering hoarsely with astounded
conviction: "Simply <i>astonishing!</i>"</p>

<p>Or, again, it will be a hat-check girl at the place where he has
lunch--a little tough-voiced, pert, hard-boiled girl. Fox will suddenly
stop one day and look at her keenly with his sea-pale eyes, and will
give her a dollar as he goes out.</p>

<p>"But Fox," friends will protest, "in God's name, why did you give
that girl a dollar?"</p>

<p>"But <i>isn't</i> she the <i>nicest</i> person?" Fox will say, in a
low and earnest whisper.</p>

<p>And they will stare at him in blank amazement. <i>That</i> girl!
That little tough, gold-digging, hard-boiled--oh, well, what's the use?
They give it up! Rather than shatter the illusions and wound the
innocence of this trusting child, they'll hold their tongues and leave
him to his dream.</p>

<p>And she, the little hard-boiled hat-check girl, in a hoarse,
confiding tone to the other hat-check girl, excitedly: "Say! Do you
know that guy that comes in here every day for lunch--the queer one
that always orders guinea-hen--an' that didn't usta wanna let us have
his hat at all?"</p>

<p>The other, nodding: "Sure, <i>I</i> know! He usta try to wear it
w'ile he's eatin'! You awmost had to throw 'im down an' take it from
'im befoeh he'd letcha have it."</p>

<p>She, rapidly, nodding: "Yeah! That's him!" Then, lowering her voice
to an excited whisper: "Well, y'know, he's been givin' me a dollah tip
every day for the last mont'!"</p>

<p>The other, staring, stunned: "G'wan!"</p>

<p>She: "Honest t' Gawd!"</p>

<p>The other: "Has he made any passes atcha yet?--any wisecracks?--any
funny tawk?"</p>

<p>She, with a puzzled look in her eye: "That's the funny paht of it--I
can't make 'im out! He 'tawks funny awright--but--he don't mean what I
thought he did. The first time he said somethin' I thought he was goin'
t' be fresh. He comes up t' get his hat one day, an' stands lookin' at
me with that funny look until I got the willies. So I says: 'So what!'
'Married?' he says--just like that. Just stands lookin' at me an' says:
'Married?'"</p>

<p>The other: "Gee! That <i>was</i> fresh!" Eagerly: "Well, go
on--w'atcha say to 'im? W'atcha tell 'im?"</p>

<p>She: "Well, I says to myse'f: 'Oh, ho! I knew <i>this</i> was
comin'! This dollah-a-day stuff can't keep up for ever! Well,' I
thinks, 'you can't hang onto a good thing all yoeh life!'--so I decides
to let 'im have it befoeh he has the chanct to staht gettin' funny. So
I lies to 'im: 'Surer I says, an' looks 'im right in the eye--'I'm
<i>good</i> an' married! Ain't <i>you?</i>' I thought that ought to
hold 'im."</p>

<p>The other: "An' w'at did he say t' <i>that?</i>"</p>

<p>She: "He just stood lookin' at me with that funny look. Then he
shook his head at me--as if I'd <i>done</i> somep'n--as if it was
<i>my</i> fault--as if he was <i>disgusted</i> wit' me. 'Yes,' he says,
an' gets his hat, an' leaves his dollah, an' walks out. Tie <i>that</i>
one down! Well, I gets to thinkin' it oveh, an' I figure that next day
he's goin' t' spring itstaht givin' me the old oil about how his wife
don't undehstand 'im, or how he's not livin' wit' her an' how lonesome
he is--an' how about it?--can't we get togetheh some night for
dinneh?"</p>

<p>And number two, rapt: "So w'at happens?"</p>

<p>And she: "When he comes to get his hat next day he just stands there
lookin' at me for a long time in that funny way of his that used to get
me noivous--as if I'd <i>done</i> somep'n--so I says again: 'So what?'
An' he says in that funny voice--it's so low sometimes you can't handly
hear it--he says: 'Any children?'--just like <i>that!</i> Gee, it was
funny! It wasn't what I expected 'im t' say at all! I didn't know what
t' say, so fine'ly I says: 'No.' So, wit' that, he just stands there
lookin' at me, an' he shakes his head at me like he was disgusted wit'
me for not havin' any. So then I gets sore, I forget I'm pot
married--the way he shakes his head at me as if it was <i>my</i> fault
for not havin' any children gets me good an' sore--an' I says to 'im:
'So <i>what?</i> What if I <i>haven't</i>? Have <i>you?</i>"</p>

<p>Number two, now fascinated: "So w'at happens? W'at does he tell
yah?"</p>

<p>She: "He stands lookin' at me an' says: 'Fiver--just like that. An'
then he shakes his head again--'All <i>women</i>,' he says, as if he
was disgusted wit' me--Like <i>yourself</i>,' he says. An' then he
takes his hat, an' leaves his dollah, an' walks out!"</p>

<p>Number two, in an aggrieved tone: "<i>Say-y!</i> Who does he think
he is, anyway? How does he get that way? That guy's pretty fresh,
<i>I'd</i> say!"</p>

<p>She: "Well, I get to thinkin' about it an' I get sore. The
<i>noive</i> of 'im, tawkin' about women like that! So the next day
when he comes to get his hat I says: 'Listen,' I says, 'what's eatin'
on you, anyway? What are yah--a woman-hatah or somep'n? Whatcha got
against women, anyway? What'd they eveh do to <i>you?</i>' 'Nothing,'
he says, 'nothing--except <i>act like women</i>!' Gee! The way he said
that! An' stood there shakin' his head at me in that disgusted way like
I'd done somep'n! He takes his hat then, leaves his dollah, an' goes
out...So afteh that I decide t' kid 'im along a little, seein' he's not
tryin' t' get funny wit' me. So every day afteh that I make some
wisecrack about women, tryin' to get a rise out of 'im, but I neveh do!
Say! You <i>can't</i> get a rise outa that guy! I've tried an' I know!
He don't even <i>know</i> when you're tryin' t' get a rise out of
'im!...So then he stahts t' ast me questions about my husband--an'
gee!--was I embarrassed? He ast me all kinds of questions about
'im--what did he do, an' how old was he, an' where did he come from,
an' was his mother livin', an' what did <i>he</i> think about women?
Gee! It usta keep me busy from one day to anotheh wonderin' what he was
goin' to ast me next, an' what t' say to 'im...Then he stahted astin'
me about my mother, an' my sisters an' brothers, an' what did
<i>they</i> do, an' how old were they--an' I could tell 'im those
because I knew the answers."</p>

<p>Number two: "An' you told 'im?"</p>

<p>She: "Sure. W'y not?"</p>

<p>Number two: "Gee, Mary, y' shouldn't do <i>that!</i> You don't know
th' guy! How do you know <i>who</i> he is?"</p>

<p>She, abstracted, in a softer tone: "Oh, I don't know. <i>That</i>
guy's all right!" With a little shrug: "<i>You</i> know! You can always
tell."</p>

<p>Number two: "Yeah, but all the same, y' neveh can tell! You don't
know anything about th' guy! I kid 'em along, but I neveh tell 'em
anything."</p>

<p>She: "Oh, sure. I know. I do the same. Only, it's diff'rent wit'
this guy. Gee, it's funny! I musta told 'im awmost everything--all
about mama, an' Pat, an' Tim, an' Helen--I guess he knows the history
of the whole damn fam'ly now! I neveh tawked so much to a stranger
befoeh in my whole life. But it's funny, he neveh seems to say anything
himse'f. He just stands there an' looks at you, an' turns his head to
one side as if he's listenin'--an' you spill the beans. When he's gone
you realise you've done <i>all</i> the tawkin'. 'Listen,' I says to 'im
the otheh day, 'you know everything else now, I've told you the truth
about everything else, so I'll come clean on this, too--that wasn't
true about me bein' married.' Gee! He was about to drive me nuts astin'
a new question every day about my husband! 'I lied to you about that,'
I says. 'I neveh was married. I haven't got a husband.'"</p>

<p>Number two, hungrily: "So w'at does he say to that?"</p>

<p>She: "Just looks at me an' says: 'So--<i>what?</i>'" Laughing: "Gee,
it was funny to hear 'im say <i>that!</i> I guess I taught it to 'im.
He says it all the time now. But it's funny the way he says it--like he
don't know exactly what it means. 'So--<i>what?</i>' he says. So I
says: 'What d'you mean, so what? I'm tellin' you that I'm not married,
like I said I was.' 'I knew that all the time,' he says. '<i>How</i>
did you know?' I says. 'How could you <i>tell?</i>' 'Because,' he says,
an' shakes his head at me in that disgusted way--'because you're a
<i>woman!</i>'"</p>

<p>Number two: "Can you imagine <i>that?</i> The <i>noive</i> of 'im! I
hope you told 'im somep'n!"</p>

<p>She: "Oh, sure! I always come right back at 'im! But <i>still</i>,
you neveh can be sure he means it! I think he's kiddin' half the time.
He may be kiddin' when he shakes his head at you in that disgusted way.
Anyway, that guy's all right! I don't know, but somehow you can tell."
A pause, then with a sigh: "But gee! If only he'd go an' get himse'f
a-----"</p>

<p>Number two: "<i>Hat!</i>"</p>

<p>She: "Can yah <i>beat</i> it?"</p>

<p>Number two: "Ain't it a <i>scream?</i>"</p>

<p>They regard each other silently, shaking their heads.</p>

<p>Fox gets at all things round the edges in this way--sees the whole
thing, whole, clear, instant, unperplexed, then all the little things
as well. Will see a man in the crowd, notice the way his ear sticks
out, his length of chin, his short upper lip, the way his face is
formed, something about the cheek-bones--a man well dressed and well
behaved, conventional in appearance, no one but the Fox would look a
second time at him--and suddenly the Fox will find himself looking into
the naked eyes of a wild animal. Fox will see the cruel and savage
tiger prowling in that man, let loose in the great jungle of the city,
sheathed in harmless and deceptive grey--a wild beast, bloody, rending,
fierce, and murderous--and stalking free and unsuspected on the sheep
of life! And Fox will turn away appalled and fascinated, look at the
people all round him with astonishment--"Can't <i>they</i> see? Don't
they <i>know?</i>"--then will return again and walk past the tiger with
hands clutching coat lapels, will bend, crane his head, and stare
fixedly into tiger's eye until tiger's eye, discovered and unguarded
now, blazes back at Fox--and all the people, puzzled and perturbed, are
staring at Fox, too. Like children, they don't know what to make of it:
"<i>What</i> does that guy see?" And Fox, astounded: "<i>Can't</i> they
see?"</p>

<p>Sees all life foxwise, really: has acute animal perceptions--does
not let concrete, brick, stone, skyscrapers, motor-cars, or clothes
obscure the thing itself. Finds the tiger looking out at life, and then
sees all the people who are lions, bulls, mastiffs, terriers, bulldogs,
greyhounds, wolves, owls, eagles, hawks, rabbits, reptiles, monkeys,
apes, and--foxes. Fox knows the world is full of them. He sees them
every day. He might have found one in C. Green, too--cat, rabbit,
terrier, or snipe--could he have seen him.</p>

<p>He reads the news in this way, sniffing sharply, with keen relish,
at the crisp, ink-pungent pages. He also reads the paper with a kind of
eager hopelessness. Fox has no hope, really; he is beyond despair. (If
there's a lack, we'll smell it out. Is this not one? Is this not a
lack-American? Can Fox be wholly of us if he has no hope?) Fox really
has no hope that men will change, that life will ever get much better.
He knows the forms will change: perhaps new changes will bring better
forms. The shifting forms of change absorb him--this is why he loves
the news. Fox would give his life to keep or increase virtue--to save
the savable, to grow the growable, to cure the curable, to keep the
good. But for the thing unsavable, for life ungrowable, for the ill
incurable, he has no care. Things lost in nature hold no interest for
him.</p>

<p>Thus will grow grey at the temples, haggard-eyed, and thin if one of
his children has an ailment. One daughter has been in a motor wreck,
escapes unhurt apparently, days later has a slight convulsion. It comes
a second time, returns weeks later, goes away, and comes again--not
much, not long, just a little thing, but Fox grows grey with worry. He
takes the girl from college, gets doctors, specialists, the best people
in the world, tries everything, can find nothing wrong, yet the attacks
continue; at length comes through it, finds out the trouble, pulls the
girl out, and sees her married. His eyes are clear again. Yet if the
girl had had a cureless ailment, Fox would not have worried much.</p>

<p>He goes home, sleeps soundly, seems indifferent, shows no worry, the
night the daughter has a child. Next morning, when informed he is a
grandfather, looks blank, puzzled, finally says: "Oh"--then, turning
away with a disdainful sniffing of the nose, says scornfully:</p>

<p>"Another <i>woman</i>, I suppose?"</p>

<p>Informed it is a man-child, says: "Oh," dubiously, then whispers
contemptuously:</p>

<p>"I had supposed such a phenomenon was impossible in <i>this</i>
family."</p>

<p>And for some weeks thereafter persists in referring to his grandson
as "She", to the indignation, resentment, excited protest of
the--<i>Women!</i></p>

<p>(A cunning Fox--knows slyly how to tease.)</p>

<p>So, then, unhoping hopefulness, and resigned acceptance; patient
fatality, and unflagging effort and unflinching will. Has no hope,
really, for the end, the whole amount of things; has hope incessant for
the individual things themselves. Knows we lose out all along the line,
but won't give in. Knows how and when we win, too, and never gives up
trying for a victory. Considers it disgraceful to stop trying--will try
everything--will lay subtle, ramified, and deep-delved plans to save
people from avertible defeat; a man of talent drowning in his own
despair, some strong and vital force exploding without purpose, some
precious, misused thing gone wickedly to ruin. These things can be
helped, they <i>must</i> be helped and saved, to see them lost, to see
them thrown away, is not to be endured--Fox will move mountains to
prevent them. But gone? Lost? Destroyed? Irretrievably thrown away? The
grave face will be touched with sadness, the sea-pale eyes filled with
regret, the low voice hoarse and indignant:</p>

<p>"It was a shame! A <i>shame!</i> Everything would have come out all
right...he had it in his grasp...and he just let it go! He <i>just gave
in</i>!"</p>

<p>Yes, for failure such as this, a deep, indignant sadness, a profound
regret. But for other things foreordained and inevitable, not savable
by any means, then a little sadness--"Too bad"--but in the end a
tranquil fatality of calm acceptance: the thing had to be, it couldn't
be helped.</p>

<p>Is therefore like Ecclesiastes: has the tragic sense of life, knows
that the day of birth is man's misfortune--but, knowing this, will then
"lay hold". Has never, like the Fool, folded his hands together and
consumed his flesh, but, seeing work to be done, has taken hold with
all his might and done it. Knows that the end of all is vanity, but
says: "Don't whine, and don't repine, but <i>get work done</i>."</p>

<p>Is, therefore, not afraid to die; does not court death, but knows
death is a friend. Does not hate life, is rather passionately involved
with life, yet does not hug it like a lover--it would not be torn
bitterly from reluctant fingers. There is no desperate hug of mortality
in Fox--rather, the sense of mystery and strangeness in the hearts of
men, the thrilling interest of the human adventure, the unending
fascination of the whole tangled, grieved, vexed, and unfathomed
pattern. As he reads the <i>Times</i> now, he sniffs sharply, shakes
his head, smiles, scans the crowded columns of the earth, and whispers
to himself:</p>

<p>"What a world! And what a life! Will we ever get to the bottom of it
all?...And what a <i>time</i> we live in! I don't dare go to sleep at
night without the paper. I cannot wait until the next one has come
out--things change so fast, the whole world's in such a state of flux,
the course of history may change from one edition to another. The whole
thing's so fascinating, I wish I could live a hundred years to see
what's going to happen! If it weren't for that--and for the
children----"</p>

<p>A slow perplexity deepens in his eyes. What will become of them?
Five tender lambs to be turned loose out of the fold into the howling
tumults of this dangerous and changeful earth. Five fledglings to be
sent forth, bewildered and defenceless, to meet the storms of fury,
peril, adversity, and savage violence that beat across the whole vexed
surface of the earth--unsheltered, ignorant, unprepared, and----</p>

<p>"Women." Scorn, touched now deeply with compassion; trouble, with a
tender care.</p>

<p>Is there a way out, then? Yes, if only he can live to see each of
them married to--to--to a <i>good</i> husband (the sense of trouble
deepens in the sea-pale eyes--the world in printed columns there before
him seethes with torment--no easy business)...But to find <i>good</i>
husbands, foxes all of them--to see his fleecelings safely folded,
shielded from the storms--each--each with fleecelings of her
own--yeslthat's the thing! Fox clears his throat and rattles the pages
with decision. That's the thing for----</p>

<p>--Women!</p>

<p>--To be folded, sheltered, guarded, kept from all the danger,
violence, and savagery, the grimed pollution of this earth's coarse
thumb, each to ply her needle, learn to keep her house, do a woman's
work, be wifely, and--and--"lead the sort of life a woman ought to
lead," Fox whispers to himself--"the kind of life she was intended
for."</p>

<p>Which is to say, produce more fleecelings for the fold, Fox? Who
will, in turn, find "good" husbands, and a fold, learn sewing,
housewifery, and "lead the sort of life a woman ought to lead," produce
still other fleecelings, and so on, <i>ad infinitum</i>, to world's end
for ever, or until----</p>

<p>--The day of wrath, the huge storm howling through the earth
again--again the Terror and Jemappes I--again November and Moscow!--the
whole flood broke through, the mighty river re-arisen, the dark tide
flowing in the hearts of men, and a great wind howling through the
earth, good Fox, that tears off roof-tops like a sheet of paper, bends
the strongest oak-trees to the ground, knocks down the walls, and
levels the warmest, strongest, and most solid folds that ever sheltered
fleecelings in security--leaving fleecelings where?</p>

<p>O Fox, is there no answer?</p>

<p>Leaving fleecelings there to knit a pattern of fine needlework on
the hurricane? Leaving fleecelings there to ply housewifery on the
flood? Leaving fleecelings to temper the bleak storms of misery to the
perfumed tenderness of fleeceling hides? To find "good" husbands in the
maelstrom's whirl? To produce more fleecelings in order to be secure,
protected, in doing a woman's work, in leading "the kind of life she
was intended for"----</p>

<p>Oh, where, Fox, where?</p>

<p>--To draw compassion from the cobble-stones? Security from iron
skies? Solicitude from the subduer's bloody hand? Arthurian gallantries
from the brutal surge of the on-marching mass? Still no answer, subtle
Fox?</p>

<p>What, then? Will not hoarse voices fogged with blood and triumph
soften to humility when they behold the fleeceling loveliness? And
while the blind mob fills the desolated streets, will not a single
cloak be thrown down for dainty fleeceling feet to tread upon? Will the
shattered masonries of all those (as we thought) impregnable
securities, with which the Foxes of the world have sheltered
fleecelings, no longer give the warmth and safety which once were so
assured and certain? And must those fountains so unfailing in the flow
of milk and honey, on which fleecelings feed, be withered at their
source? Must they be fountains, rather, dyed with blood--blood of the
lamb, then? Fleeceling blood?</p>

<p>O Fox, we cannot think of it!</p>

<p>Fox reads on, intent, with the keen hunger of a fascinated interest,
the shade of a deep trouble in his eye. The sober, close-set columns of
the <i>Times</i> give up their tortured facts, revealing a world in
chaos, man bewildered, life in chains. These substantial rages, so
redolent of morning and sobriety--of breakfast in America, the pungency
of ham and eggs, the homes of prosperous people--yield a bitter harvest
of madness, hatred, dissolution, misery, cruelty, oppression,
injustice, despair, and the bankruptcy of human faith. What have we
here, mad masters?--for surely if ye be masters of such hell-on-earth
as sober <i>Times</i> portrays, then ye be mad!</p>

<p>Well, here's a little item:</p>

<p>It is announced, my masters, that on Saturday next, in the Land of
the Enchanted Forest, land of legends and the magic of the elves, land
of the Venusberg and the haunting beauties of the Gothic towns, land of
the truth-lover and the truth-seeker, land of the plain, good, common,
vulgar, and all-daring Sense of Man, land where the great monk nailed
his blunt defiance to the doors at Wittenberg, and broke the combined
powers, splendours, pomps, and menaces of churchly Europe with the
sledge-hammer genius of his coarse and brutal speech--land from that
time onwards of man's common noble dignity, and of the strong truth of
sense and courage, shaking its thick fist into the face of folly--yes!
land of Martin Luther, land of Goethe, land of Faust, land of Mozart
and Beethoven--land where immortal music was created, glorious poetry
written, and philosophy cultivated--land of magic, mystery, matchless
loveliness, and unending treasure-hordes of noble art--land where the
Man of Weimar, for the last time in the modern world, dared to make the
whole domain of art, culture, and learning the province of his gigantic
genius--land, too, of noble, consecrated youth, where young men sang
and wrote, loved truth, went through apprenticeships devoted to the
aspiration of a high and passionate ideal--well, mad masters, it is
announced that this same enchanted land will consecrate the devotion of
another band of youth <i>this</i> Saturday--when the young men of the
nation will burn books before the Town Halls, in all the public squares
of Germany!</p>

<p>Well, then, Fox?</p>

<p>And elsewhere on this old tormented globe, goes it much better?
Fire, famine, flood, and pestilence--these trials we have always had.
And hatred--most firelike, faminelike, floodlike, and most pestilential
of all evils--yes, we have always had <i>that</i>, too. And yet, Great
God! When has our old unhappy earth been stricken with such universal
visitation? When has she ached in every joint as she aches now? When
has she had such a universal itch, been so spavined, gouty, poxy, so
broken out in sores all over?</p>

<p>The Chinese hate the Japanese, the Japanese the Russians, the
Russians also hate the Japanese, and the hordes of India the English.
The Germans hate the French, the French hate the Germans, and then look
wildly round to find other nations to help them hate the Germans; but
find they hate almost everyone as much as they hate Germans; they can't
find enough to hate outside of France, and so divide themselves into
thirty-seven different cliques and hate each other bitterly from Calais
to Menton--the Leftists hate Rightists, the Centrists hate Leftists,
the Royalists hate Socialists, the Socialists hate Communists, the
Communists hate Capitalists, and all unite in hatred of one another. In
Russia, the Stalinites hate Trotskyites, the Trotskyites hate
Stalinites, and both hate Republicans and Democrats. Everywhere the
Communists (so they say) hate their cousin Fascists, and the Fascists
hate the Jews.</p>

<p>In this year of Our Gentle Lord 1934, "expert" observers say, Japan
is preparing to go to war again with China within two years, Russia
will join in with China, Japan will ally herself with Germany, Germany
will make a deal with Italy, and then make war on France and England,
America will try to stick her head into the sand, and so keep out of
it, but will find it cannot be done and will be drawn in. And in the
end, after everybody has fought everybody else up and down the globe,
the whole Capitalistic world will join up finally against Russia in an
effort to crush Communism--which eventually must win--will lose--is
bound to triumph--will be wiped out--will supplant Capitalism, which is
on its last legs--which is only suffering a temporary relapse--which
grows more dropsical, greedy, avaricious, bloated, and monopolistic all
the time--which is mending its ways and growing better all the
time--which must be preserved at all costs if the "American System" is
to endure--which must be destroyed at all costs if America is to
endure--which is just beginning--which is ending--which is gone
already--which will never go----</p>

<p>And so it goes--round, round, round the tortured circumference of
this aching globe--round, round, and back again, and up and down, with
stitch and counterstitch until this whole earth and all the people in
it are caught up in one gigantic web of hatred,' greed, tyranny,
injustice, war, theft, murder, lying, treachery, hunger, suffering, and
devilish error!</p>

<p>And we, old Fox? How goes it in our own fair land--our great
America?</p>

<p>Fox winces quickly, cranes his neck into his collar, and mutters
hoarsely a passionate regret:</p>

<p>"Too <i>bad!</i> Too <i>bad!</i> We should have <i>had</i> it! We
were just beginning--we should have had it fifty years ago, as Rome had
it, and as England had it! But all this turmoil came too soon--we
didn't have it long enough! Too <i>bad!</i> Too <i>bad!</i>"</p>

<p>Yes, Fox, it is too bad. Too bad, indeed, that in our pride, our
self-respect, and our taut horror the Medusa-visage of the whole
tormented earth may be an anodyne for us, lest we have to look too
closely at the honour of our own America.</p>

<h2><a name="chapter4-31"></a>31. The Promise of America</h2>

<p>For four years George Webber lived and wrote in Brooklyn, and during
all this time his life was about as solitary as any that a modern man
can know. Loneliness, far from being a rare and curious circumstance,
is and always has been the central and inevitable experience of every
man. Not only has this been true of the greatest poets, as evidenced by
the huge unhappiness of their published grief, but now it seemed to
George to apply with equal force to all the nameless cyphers who
swarmed about him in the streets. As he saw them in their strident
encounters with each other, and overheard their never-varying exchanges
of abuse, contempt, distrust, and hatred, it became increasingly clear
to him that one of the contributing causes of their complaint was
loneliness.</p>

<p>To live alone as George was living, a man should have the confidence
of God, the tranquil faith of a monastic saint, the stern
impregnability of Gibraltar. Lacking these, he finds that there are
times when anything, everything, all and nothing, the most trivial
incidents, the most casual words, can in an instant strip him of his
armour, palsy his hand, constrict his heart with frozen horror, and
fill his bowels with the grey substance of shuddering impotence and
desolation. Sometimes it would be a sly remark dropped by some
all-knowing literary soothsayer in the columns of one of the more
leftish reviews, such as:</p>

<p>"Whatever has become of our autobiographical and volcanic friend,
George Webber? Remember him? Remember the splash he made with that
so-called 'novel' of his a few years back? Some of our esteemed
colleagues thought they detected signs of promise there. We ourselves
should have welcomed another book from him, just to prove that the
first was not an accident. But <i>tempus fugit</i>, and where is
Webber? Calling Mr. Webber! No answer? Well, a pity, perhaps; but then,
who can count the number of one-book authors? They shoot their bolt,
and after that they go into the silence and no more is heard from them.
Some of us who were more than a little doubtful about that book of
Webber's, but whose voices were drowned out by the Oh's and Ah's of
those who rused headlong to proclaim a new star rising in the literary
firmament, could now come forward, if we weren't too kindly disposed
towards our more emotional brethren of the critical fraternity, and
modestly say: 'We told you so!'"</p>

<p>Sometimes it would be nothing but a shadow passing on the sun,
sometimes nothing but the gelid light of March falling on the
limitless, naked, sprawling ugliness and squalid decencies of Brooklyn
streets. Whatever it was, at such a time all joy and singing would go
instantly out of day, Webber's heart would drop out of him like a
leaden plummet, hope, confidence, and conviction would seem lost for
ever to him, and all the high and shining truth that he had ever found
and lived and known would now turn false to mock him. Then he would
feel like one who walked among the dead, and it would be as if the only
things that were not false on earth were the creatures of the
death-in-life who moved for ever in the changeless lights and weathers
of red, waning, weary March and Sunday afternoon.</p>

<p>These hideous doubts, despairs, and dark confusions of the soul
would come and go, and George knew them as every lonely man must know
them. For he was united to no image save that image which he himself
created. He was bolstered by no knowledge save that which he gathered
for himself out of his own life. He saw life with no other vision save
the vision of his own eyes and brain and senses. He was sustained and
cheered and aided by no party, was given comfort by no creed, and had
no faith in him except his own.</p>

<p>That faith, though it was made up of many articles, was at bottom a
faith in himself, a faith that if he could only succeed in capturing a
fragment of the truth about the life he knew, and make it known and
felt by others, it would be a more glorious accomplishment than
anything else he could imagine. And through it all, animating this
faith and sustaining it with a promise of rewards to come, was a
belief--be it now confessed--that if he could only do this, the world
would thank him for it, and would crown him with the laurel of its
fame.</p>

<p>The desire for fame is tooted in the hearts of men. It is one of the
most powerful of all human desires, and perhaps for that very reason,
and because it is so deep and secret, it is the desire that men are
most unwilling to admit, particularly those who feel most sharply its
keen and piercing spur.</p>

<p>The politician, for example, would never have us think that it is
love of office, the desire for the notorious elevation of public place,
that drives him on. No, the thing that governs him is his pure devotion
to the common weal, his selfless and high-minded statesmanship, his
love of his fellow-man, and his burning idealism to turn out the rascal
who usurps the office and betrays the public trust which he himself, as
he assures us, would so gloriously and devotedly maintain.</p>

<p>So, too, the soldier. It is never love of glory that inspires him to
his profession. It is never love of battle, love of war, love of all
the resounding titles and the proud emoluments of the heroic conqueror.
Oh, no. It is devotion to duty that makes him a soldier. There is no
personal motive in it. He is inspired simply by the selfless ardour of
his patriotic abnegation. He regrets that he has but one life to give
for his country.</p>

<p>So it goes through every walk of life. The lawyer assures us that he
is the defender of the weak, the guardian of the oppressed, the
champion of the rights of defrauded widows and beleaguered orphans, the
upholder of justice, the unrelenting enemy, at no matter what cost to
himself, of all forms of chicanery, fraud, theft, violence, and crime.
Even the business man will not admit a selfish motive in his
money-getting. On the contrary, he is the developer of the nation's
resources. He is the benevolent employer of thousands of working men
who would be lost and on the dole without the organising genius of his
great intelligence. He is the defender of the American ideal of rugged
individualism, the shining exemplar to youth of what a poor country boy
may achieve in this nation through a devotion to the national virtues
of thrift, industry, obedience to duty, and business integrity. He is,
he assures us, the backbone of the country, the man who makes the
wheels go round, the leading citizen, Public Friend No. 1.</p>

<p>All these people lie, of course. They know they lie, and everyone
who hears them also knows they lie. The lie, however, has become a part
of the convention of American life. People listen to it patiently, and
if they smile at it, the smile is weary, touched with resignation and
the indifferent dismissals of fatigue.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, the lie has also invaded the world of
creation--the one place where it has no right at all to exist. There
was a time when the poet, the painter, the musician, the artist of
whatever sort, was not ashamed to confess that the desire for fame was
one of the driving forces of his life and labour. But what a
transformation from that time to this! Nowadays one will travel far and
come back fruitless if he hopes to find an artist who will admit that
he is devoted to anything except the service of some ideal--political,
social, economic, religious, or aesthetic--which is outside himself,
and to which his own humble fame-forsaking person is reverently and
selflessly consigned.</p>

<p>Striplings of twenty assure us that the desire for fame is naively
childish, the fruit of an outworn cult of "romantic individualism".
From all the falseness and self-deception of this cult these young
gentlemen tell us they are free--without troubling to explain, however,
by what process of miraculous purgation they achieved their freedom. It
took Goethe, the strongest soul of modern times, some three and eighty
years to free his mighty spirit of this last infirmity. Milton, old and
blind, forsaken, and past fifty, is said to have won free of it by the
end of Cromwell's revolution, in whose employment he destroyed his
sight. And yet, can we be sure that even he was ever wholly clear, for
what is the tremendous edifice of <i>Paradise Lost</i> except a man's
final and triumphant suit against eternity?</p>

<p>Poor, blind Milton!</p>

<pre>
Fame is the spur that the clear spirit doth raise
(That last infirmity of Noble mind)
To scorn delights, and live laborious dayes;
But the fair Guerdon when we hope to find,
And think to burst out into sudden blaze,
Comes the blind Fury with th'abhorred shears,
And slits the thin-spun life. But not the praise,
Phoebus repli'd, and touch'd my trembling ears;
Fame is no plant that grows on mortal soil,
Nor in the glistering foil
Set off to th'world, nor in broad rumour lies,
But lives and spreds aloft by those pure eyes,
And perfet witnes of all judging Jove;
As he pronounces lastly on each deed,
Of so much fame in Heav'n expect thy meed.
</pre>

<p>Deluded man! Poor vassal of corrupted time! How fair a thing for us
to know that we are not such men as he and Goethe were! We live in more
stirring times, and our very striplings are secure in their collective
selflessness. We have freed ourselves of all degrading vanities, choked
off the ravening desire for individual immortality, and now, having
risen out of the ashes of our father's earth into the untainted ethers
of collective consecration, we are clear at last of all that vexed,
corrupted earth--clear of the sweat and blood and sorrow, clear of the
grief and joy, clear of the hope and fear and human agony of which our
father's flesh and that of every other man alive before us was ever
wrought.</p>

<p>And yet, having achieved this glorious emancipation; having laid all
petty dreams aside; having learned to think of life, not in terms of
ourselves, but in terms of the whole mass; having learned to think of
life, not as it is to-day, but as it is going to be five hundred years
from now, when all the revolutions have been made, and all the blood
has been shed, and all the hundreds of millions of vain and selfish
little lives, each concerned with its own individual and romantic
breath, have been ruthlessly wiped out in order to usher in the
collective glory that such will be--having become marvellously and, as
it were, overnight such paragons of collective selflessness and such
scorners of the vanity of personal fame, is it not strange that though
we have new phrases, yet their meaning is still the same? Is it not
strange that, feeling only an amused and pitying contempt for those who
are still naive enough to long for glory, we should yet lacerate our
souls, poison our minds and hearts, and crucify our spirits with bitter
and rancorous hatred against those who are fortunate enough to achieve
fame?</p>

<p>Or do we err? Are we mistaken in assuming that these words we read
so often are really words of hatred, malice, envy, ridicule, and
jeering mockery? Are we mistaken in assuming that the whole vocabulary
of abuse which is exhausted every week in the journals of our red and
pink-complexioned comrades--the sneers against a man's talent, the
bitter denials that his work has any substance, sincerity, truth, or
reality whatever--is really what it seems to be? No doubt we <i>are</i>
mistaken. It would be more charitable to believe that these pure
spirits of the present day are what they say they are--collective,
selfless, consecrated--and that the words they use do not mean what
they seem to mean, and do not betray the romantic and deluded passions
that seem to animate them, but are really words used coldly, without
passion, for the purposes of collective propaganda--in operations
completely surgical, whereby the language of the present day, with all
its overtones of superstition, prejudice, and false knowledge, is
employed clinically, scientifically, simply to further the Idea of the
Future State!</p>

<p>No more, no more! Of what avail to crush these vermin beneath our
heavy boot? The locusts have no king, and lice will multiply for ever.
The poet must be born, and live, and sweat, and suffer, and change, and
grow, yet somehow maintain the changeless selfhood of his soul's
integrity among all the crawling fashions of this world of lice. The
poet lives, and dies, and is immortal; but the eternal trifler of all
complexions never dies. The eternal trifler comes and goes, sucks blood
of living men, is filled and emptied with the surfeit of each changing
fashion. He gorges and disgorges, and is never fed. There is no nurture
in him, and he draws no nurture from the food he feeds on. There is no
heart, no soul, no blood, no living faith in him: the eternal trifler
simply swallows and remains.</p>

<p>And we? Made of our father's earth, blood of his blood, bone of his
bone, flesh of his flesh--born like our father here to live and strive,
here to win through or be defeated--here, like all the other men who
went before us, not too nice or dainty for the uses of this earth--here
to live, to suffer, and to die-O brothers, like our fathers in their
time, we are burning, burning, burning in the night.</p>

<p>Go, seeker, if you will, throughout the land and you will find us
burning in the night.</p>

<p>There where the hackles of the Rocky Mountains blaze in the blank
and naked radiance of the moon, go make your resting stool upon the
highest peak. Can you not see us now? The continental wall juts sheer
and flat, its huge black shadow on the plain, and the plain sweeps out
against the East, two thousand miles away. The great snake that you see
there is the Mississippi River.</p>

<p>Behold the gem-strung towns and cities of the good, green East,
flung like star-dust through the field of night. That spreading
constellation to the north is called Chicago, and that giant wink that
blazes in the moon is the pendant lake that it is built upon. Beyond,
close-set and dense as a clenched fist, are all the jewelled cities of
the eastern seaboard. There's Boston, ringed with the bracelet of its
shining little towns, and all the lights that sparkle on the rocky
indentations of New England. Here, southward and a little to the west,
and yet still coasted to the sea, is our intensest ray, the splintered
firmament of the towered island of Manhattan. Round about her, sown
thick as grain, is the glitter of a hundred towns and cities. The long
chain of lights there is the necklace of Long Island and the Jersey
shore. Southward and inland, by a foot or two, behold the duller glare
of Philadelphia. Southward farther still, the twin
constellations--Baltimore and Washington. Westward, but still within
the borders of the good, green East, that night-time glow and smoulder
of hell-fire is Pittsburgh. Here, St. Louis, hot and humid in the
cornfield belly of the land, and bedded on the mid-length coil and
fringes of the snake. There at the snake's mouth, southward six hundred
miles or so, you see the jewelled crescent of old New Orleans. Here,
west and south again, you see the gemmy glitter of the cities on the
Texas border.</p>

<p>Turn now, seeker, on your resting stool atop the Rocky Mountains,
and look another thousand miles or so across moon-blazing fiend-worlds
of the Painted Desert and beyond Sierras' ridge. That magic congeries
of lights there to the west, ringed like a studded belt round the magic
setting of its lovely harbour, is the fabled town of San Francisco.
Below it, Los Angeles and all the cities of the California shore. A
thousand miles to north and west, the sparkling towns of Oregon and
Washington.</p>

<p>Observe the whole of it, survey it as you might survey a field. Make
it your garden, seeker, or your backyard patch. Be at ease in it. It's
your oyster--yours to open if you will. Don't be frightened, it's not
so big now, when your footstool is the Rocky Mountains. Reach out and
dip a hatful of cold water from Lake Michigan. Drink it--we've tried
it--you'll not find it bad. Take your shoes off and work your toes down
in the river oozes of the Mississippi bottom--it's very refreshing on a
hot night in the summer-time. Help yourself to a bunch of Concord
grapes up there in northern New York State--they're getting good now.
Or raid that water-melon patch down there in Georgia. Or, if you like,
you can try the Rockyfords here at your elbow, in Colorado. Just make
yourself at home, refresh yourself, get the feel of things, adjust your
sights, and get the scale. It's your pasture now, and it's not so
big--only three thousand miles from east to west, only two thousand
miles from north to south--but all between, where ten thousand points
of light prick out the cities, towns, and villages, there, seeker, you
will find us burning in the night.</p>

<p>Here, as you pass through the brutal sprawl, the twenty miles of
rails and rickets, of the South Chicago slums--here, in an unpainted
shack, is a Negro boy, and, seeker, he is burning in the night. Behind
him is a memory of the cotton-fields, the flat and mournful pineland
barrens of the lost and buried South, and at the fringes of the pine
another nigger shack, with mammy and eleven little niggers. Farther
still behind, the slave-driver's whip, the slave ship, and, far off,
the jungle dirge of Africa. And before him, what? A roped-in ring, a
blaze of lights, across from him a white champion; the bell, the
opening, and all round the vast sea-roaring of the crowd. Then the
lightning feint and stroke, the black panther's paw--the hot, rotating
presses, and the rivers of sheeted print! 0 seeker, where is the slave
ship now?</p>

<p>Or there, in the clay-baked piedmont of the South, that lean and
tan-faced boy who sprawls there in the creaking chair among admiring
cronies before the open doorways of the fire department, and tells them
how he pitched the team to shut-out victory to-day. What visions burn,
what dreams possess him, seeker of the night? The packed stands of the
stadium, the bleachers sweltering with their unshaded hordes, the
faultless velvet of the diamond, unlike the clay-balked outfields down
in Georgia. The mounting roar of eighty thousand voices and Gehrig
coming up to bat, the boy himself upon the pitching mound, the lean
face steady as a hound's; then the nod, the signal, and the wind-up,
the rawhide arm that snaps and crackles like a whip, the small white
bullet of the blazing ball, its loud report in the oiled pocket of the
catcher's mitt, the umpire's thumb jerked upwards, the clean
strike.</p>

<p>Or there again, in the East-Side Ghetto of Manhattan, two blocks
away from the East River, a block away from the gas-house district and
its thuggery, there in the swarming tenement, shut in its sweltering
cell, breathing the sun-baked air through opened window at the
fire-escape, celled there away into a little semblance of privacy and
solitude from all the brawling and vociferous life and argument of his
family and the seething hive round him, the Jew boy sits and pores upon
his book. In shirt-sleeves, bent above his table to meet the hard glare
of a naked bulb, he sits with gaunt, starved face converging to his
huge beaked nose, the weak eyes squinting painfully through his
thick-lens glasses, his greasy hair roached back in oily scrolls above
the slanting cage of his painful and constricted brow. And for what?
For what this agony of concentration? For what this hell of effort? For
what this intense withdrawal from the poverty and squalor of dirty
brick and rusty fire-escapes, from the raucous cries and violence and
never-ending noise? For what? Because, brother, he is burning in the
night. He sees the class, the lecture room, the shining apparatus of
gigantic laboratories, the open field of scholarship and pure research,
certain knowledge, and the world distinction of an Einstein name.</p>

<p>So, then, to every man his chance--to every man, regardless of his
birth, his shining, golden opportunity--to every man the right to live,
to work to be himself, and to become whatever thing his manhood and his
vision can combine to make him--this seeker, is the promise of
America.</p>

<h2><a name="book5"></a>BOOK V. - EXILE AND DISCOVERY</h2>

<p><i>After four longyears in Brooklyn, George Webber came out of the
wilderness, looked round him, and concluded he had had enough of it.
During this period he had learned much, both about himself and about
America, but now he was seized again with wanderlust. His life had
always seemed to shift between the poles of anchored loneliness and
foot-loose voyagings--between wandering for ever, and then the earth
again--and now the old and restless urgings of "Where shall we go? And
what shall we do?" again became insistent, would not down, and demanded
of him a new answer.</i></p>

<p><i>Ever since his first book bad been published be had been looking
for a way to form and shape his next. Now he thought that he had found
it. It was not the way, perhaps, but it was a way. The hundreds and
thousands of separate and disjointed notes that he had written down had
fallen at last into a pattern in his mind. He needed only to weave them
all together, and fill in the blanks, and he would have a book. He felt
that be could do this final job of organisation and revision better if
he made a clean break in the monotony 'of his life. New scenes, new
faces, and new atmospheres might clear his head and sharpen his
perspective.</i></p>

<p><i>It would be a good thing, too, to get away from America for a
while. Too much was happening here--it was too exciting and disturbing.
The whole thing was in such a state of flux, in such a prophetic
condition of becoming, that the sheer exhilaration of watching it made
it hard to concentrate upon the immediate job he had to do. Perhaps in
the older civilisation of Europe, where life was fixed and certain,
moulded by the heritage of centuries, there would be fewer distractions
to keep him from his work. He decided to go abroad, to England, and
there drop anchor, there find even keel in placid waters--there
complete his book.</i></p>

<p><i>So in the late summer of 1934 he sailed from New York, went
straight to London, took a flat, and settled down to hard, intensive
labour. All through the autumn and winter of that year he lived in
London in his self-imposed exile. It was a memorable time for him, a
time during which, as he was later to realise, he discovered an entire
new world. All the events, the experiences, and the people that he met
became engraved indelibly upon his life.</i></p>

<p><i>And the event which exercised the most profound influence upon
him in that alien air was his meeting with the great American author,
Mr. Lloyd McHarg. Everything seemed to lead up to that. And what made
his meeting with Mr. McHarg so important to him was that now, for the
first time, he met a living embodiment of his own dearest and most
secret dream. For when Mr. Lloyd McHarg swept like a cyclone through
his life, George knew that he was having his first encounter in the
flesh with that fair Medusa, Fame herself Never before had he beheld
the lady, or witnessed the effects of her sweet blandishments. Now he
saw the whole thing for himself.</i></p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="chapter5-32"></a>32. The Universe of Daisy Purvis</h2>

<p>On arriving in London, George had the good fortune to sublet a flat
in Ebury Street. The young military gentleman who condescended to let
him have the place possessed one of those resounding double-jointed
names that one comes across so often among the members of the upper or
would-be-upper branches of English society. George was never able to
get all the mouth-filling syllables of that grand name quite straight,
but suffice it to say that his landlord was a Major Somebody Somebody
Somebody Bixley-Dunton.</p>

<p>He was a good-looking man, tall, young, ruddy, with the lean and
well-conditioned figure of a cavalryman. He was an engaging kind of
fellow, too--so engaging that when he made the arrangements which
permitted George to take over the premises, he managed to insinuate
into his bill for rent a thumping sum that covered all the electricity
and gas he had used in the preceding two quarters. And electricity and
gas, as George was to discover, came high in London. You read and
worked by one, sometimes not only through the night, but also through
the pea-soup opacity of a so-called day. And you bathed and shaved and
cooked and feebly warmed yourself by the other. George never did figure
out just exactly how the engaging Major Bixley-Dunton did it, but he
managed it so adroitly that George was half-way back to America some
six months later before it dawned on his unsuspecting mind that he had
occupied the modest dwelling only two quarters but had paid four
whacking assessments for the whole year's gas and electricity.</p>

<p>George thought he was getting a bargain at the time, and perhaps he
was. He paid Major Bixley-Dunton in quarterly instalments--in advance,
of course--at the rate of two pounds ten shillings a week, and for this
sum he had the advantage of being the sole occupant, at night at least,
of a very small but distinctly authentic London house. It was really a
rather tiny house, and certainly a very inconspicuous one, in a section
noted for the fashionable spaciousness and magnificence of its
dwellings. The building was three storeys tall, and George had the top
floor. Below him a doctor had his offices, and the ground floor was
occupied by a small tailor shop. These other tenants both lived
elsewhere and were present only during the day, so at night George had
the whole house to himself.</p>

<p>He had a good deal of respect for the little tailor shop. The
venerable and celebrated Irish writer, Mr. James Burke, had his pants
pressed there, and George had the honour of being present in the shop
one night when the great man called for them. It was a considerable
moment in Webber's life. He felt that he was assisting at an impressive
and distinguished ceremony. It was the first time he had ever been in
such intimate contact with such exalted literary greatness, and most
fairminded people will agree that there are few things in the world
more intimate than a pair of pants. Also, even at the moment that Mr.
Burke entered the shop and demanded his trousers, George was requesting
the return of his own. This homely coincidence gave him a feeling of
perfectly delightful understanding and identity of purpose with a
gentleman whose talents had for so many years been an object of his
veneration. It gave him an easy and casual sense of belonging to the
inner circle, and he could imagine someone saying to him:</p>

<p>"Oh, by the way, have you seen anything of James Burke lately?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes," he could nonchalantly reply, "I ran into him the other day
in the place where we both go to have our pants pressed."</p>

<p>And night after night as he worked in his sitting-room on the third
floor, at that hour the solitary lord and master of that little house,
toiling on the composition of a work which he hoped, but did not dare
believe, might rival in celebrity some of James Burke's own, he would
get at times the most curious and moving sense of companionship, as if
a beneficent and approving spirit were there beneath that roof with
him; and through the watches of the night it would speak to him with
the eloquence of silence, saying:</p>

<p>"Toil on, son, and do not lose heart or hope. Let nothing you
dismay. You are not utterly forsaken. I, too, am here--here in the
darkness waiting, here attentive, here approving of your labour and
your dream."</p>

<p>Ever sincerely yours,</p>

<p>James Burke's Pants</p>

<p>One of the most memorable experiences of George Webber's six months
in London was his relationship with Daisy Purvis.</p>

<p>Mrs. Purvis was a charwoman who lived at Hammersmith and for years
had worked for "unmarried gentlemen" in the fashionable districts known
as Mayfair and Belgravia. George had inherited her, so to speak, from
Major Bixley-Dunton, and when he went away he gave her back to him, to
be passed on to the next young bachelor gentleman--a man, George hoped,
who would be worthy of her loyalty, devotion, idolatry, and humble
slavery. He had never had a servant in his life before. He had known
Negro servants during his boyhood in the South; since then he had had
people come in once or twice a week to clean up the various places
where he had lived; but never before had he owned a servant body and
soul, to the degree that her interests became his interests and her
life his life; never before had he had anyone whose whole concern was
the preservation of his comfort and welfare.</p>

<p>In appearance, Mrs. Purvis might have been the prototype of a whole
class. She was not one of those comic figures so often pictured in the
drawings of Belcher and Phil May, those pudgy old women who wear shawls
and little Queen Victoria bonnets perched upon their heads, whose most
appropriate locale seems to be the pub, and whom one actually does see
in London pubs, sodden with beer and viciousness. Mrs. Purvis was a
self-respecting female of the working class. She was somewhere in her
forties, a woman inclined to plumpness, of middling height,
fair-haired, blue-eyed, and pink-complexioned, with a pleasant, modest
face, and a naturally friendly nature, but inclined to be somewhat do
her dignity with strangers. At first, although she was at all times
courteous, her manner towards her new employer was a little distant.
She would come in in the morning and they would formally discuss the
business of the day--what they were going to have for lunch, the
supplies they were going to "git in", the amount of money it would be
necessary to "lay out".</p>

<p>"What would you like for lunch to-day, sir?" Mrs. Purvis would say.
"'Ave you decided?"</p>

<p>"No, Mrs. Purvis. What would you suggest? Let's see. We had the
chump chop yesterday, didn't we, and the sprouts?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Mrs. Purvis would reply, "and the day before--Monday,
you may recall--we 'ad rump steak with potato chips."</p>

<p>"Yes, and it was good, too. Well, then, suppose we have rump steak
again?"</p>

<p>"Very good, sir," Mrs. Purvis would say, with perfect courtesy, but
with a rising intonation of the voice which somehow suggested,
delicately and yet unmistakably, that he could do as he pleased, but
mat she rather thought his choice was not the best.</p>

<p>Feeling this, George would immediately have doubts. He would
say:</p>

<p>"Oh, wait a minute. We've been having steak quite often, haven't
we?"</p>

<p>"You 'ave 'ad it quite a bit, sir," she would say quietly, not with
reproof, but with just a trace of confirmation. "Still, of course----"
She would not finish, but would pause and wait.</p>

<p>"Well, rump steak is good. All that we've had was first-rate. Still,
maybe we could have something else to-day, for a change. What do you
think?"</p>

<p>"Should think so, sir, if you feel that way," she said quietly.
"After all, one does like a bit of variety now and then, <i>doesn't</i>
one?"</p>

<p>"Of course. Well, then, what shall it be? What would you suggest,
Mrs. Purvis?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, if I may say so, a bit of gammon and peas is rather nice
sometimes," with just a trace of shyness and diffidence, mixed with an
engaging tinge of warmth as she relented into the informality of mild
enthusiasm. "I 'ad a look in at the butcher's as I came by this
mornin', and the gammon was nice, sir. It <i>was</i> a prime bit, sir,"
she said now with genuine warmth. "Prime."</p>

<p>After this, of course, he could not tell her that he had not the
faintest notion what gammon was. He could only look delighted and
respond:</p>

<p>"Then, by all means, let's have gammon and peas. I think it's just
the thing to-day."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir." She had drawn herself up again; the formal
intonation of the words had put her back within the fortress of
aloofness, and had put him back upon his heels.</p>

<p>It was a curious and disquieting experience, one that he was often
to have with English people. Just when he thought that finally the bars
were down and the last barriers of reserve broken through, just when
they had begun to talk with mutual warmth and enthusiasm, these English
would be back behind the barricade, leaving him to feel that it was all
to do over again.</p>

<p>"Now for your breakfast to-morrow mornin'," Mrs. Purvis would
continue. "'Ave you decided what you'd like?"</p>

<p>"No, Mrs. Purvis. Have we anything on hand? How are our supplies
holding out?"</p>

<p>"They <i>are</i> a bit low, sir," she admitted. "We 'ave eggs. There
is still butter left, and 'arf a loaf of bread. We're gittin' low on
tea, sir. But you could 'ave eggs, sir, if you like."</p>

<p>Something in the faint formality of the tone informed him that even
though he might like to have eggs, Mrs. Purvis would not approve, so he
said quickly:</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Mrs. Purvis. Get the tea, of course, but no more eggs. I
think we've had too many eggs, don't you?"</p>

<p>"You <i>'ave</i>, sir, you know," she said gently--"for the last
three mornin's, at any rate. Still--" Again she paused, as if to say
that if he was determined to go on having eggs, he should have
them.</p>

<p>"Oh, no. We mustn't have eggs again. If we keep on at this rate,
we'll get to the point where we can't look an egg in the face again,
won't we?"</p>

<p>She laughed suddenly, a jolly and full-throated laugh. "We will,
sir, won't we?" said Mrs. Purvis, and laughed again. "Excuse me for
larfin', sir, but the way you put it, I 'ad to larf. It was quite
amusin', really."</p>

<p>"Well, then, Mrs. Purvis, maybe you've got some ideas. It's not
going to be eggs, that's one thing sure."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, 'ave you tried kippers yet? Kippers are quite nice,
sir," she went on, with another momentary mellowing into warmth. "If
you're lookin' for a change, you could do worse than kippers. Really
you could, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, then, we'll have kippers. They're the very thing."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir," She hesitated a moment and then said: "About your
supper, sir--I was thinkin'----"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mrs. Purvis?"</p>

<p>"It just occurred to me, sir, that, seein' as I'm not here at night
to cook you a 'ot meal, we might lay in somethin' you could prepare for
yourself. I was thinkin' the other day, sir, workin' as you do, you
must get 'ungry in the middle of the night, so it wouldn't be a bad
idea, would it, sir, if you could have somethin' on 'and?"</p>

<p>"I think it would be a wonderful idea, Mrs. Purvis. What do you have
in mind?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir," she paused briefly again, reflecting quietly, "we might
git in a bit of tongue, you know. A bit of cold tongue is very tasty. I
should think you'd find it most welcome in the middle of the night. Or
a bit of 'am. Then, sir, you would 'ave your bread and butter and your
mustard pickle, and I could even git in a jar of chutney, if youlike,
and you know 'ow to make tea yourself, don't you, sir?"</p>

<p>"Of course. It's a good idea. By all means, get in tongue or ham and
chutney. Is that all, now?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir," she reflected a moment longer, went to the buffet
sideboard, opened it, and looked in. "I was just wonderin' 'ow you are
for beer, sir...Ah-h," she exclaimed, nodding with satisfaction, "it
<i>is</i> gittin' a bit low, sir. You 'ave only two bottles left. Shall
we lay in a 'arf-dozen bottles?"</p>

<p>"Yes. No--wait a minute. Better make it a dozen, then you won't have
to be running out to order it again so soon."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir." Again the formal rising intonation, this time, he
thought, with approval. "And what do you prefer, the Worthington or
Bass?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know. Which is better?"</p>

<p>"They're both first-rate, sir. Some people prefer one kind and some
another. The Worthington, perhaps is a trifle lighter, but you won't go
wrong, sir, whichever one you order."</p>

<p>"All right, then, I'll tell you what you do--suppose you order half
a dozen of each."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir." She turned to go.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mrs. Purvis."</p>

<p>"'Kew," she said, most formally and distantly now, and went out
quietly, closing the door gently but very firmly after her.</p>

<p>As the weeks went by, her excessive formality towards George began
to thaw out and drop away. She became more and more free in
communicating to him whatever was on her mind. Not that she ever forgot
her "place". Quite the contrary. But, while always maintaining the
instinctive manner of an English servant towards her master, she also
became increasingly assiduous to her slavish attentions, until at last
one would almost have thought that her duty towards him was her very
life.</p>

<p>Her devotion, however, was not quite as whole and absolute as it
appeared to be. For three or four hours of the day she had another
master, who shared with George her service and her expense. This was
the extraordinary little man who kept doctor's offices on the floor
below. In truth, therefore, Mrs. Purvis had a divided loyalty, and yet,
in a curious way, she also managed to convey to each of her employers a
sense that her whole-souled obligation belonged to him, and to him
alone.</p>

<p>The little doctor was a Russian of the old regime, who had been a
physician at the court of the Czar, and had accumulated a large
fortune, which of course had been confiscated when he fled the country
during the revolution. Penniless, he had come to England, and had made
another fortune by a practice about which Mrs. Purvis, with a kind of
haughty aloofness mixed with loyalty, had invented a soothing little
fiction, but concerning which the doctor himself became in time quite
candid. From one o'clock in the afternoon until four or thereabouts,
the door-bell tinkled almost constantly, and Mrs. Purvis was kept busy
padding up and down the narrow stairs, admitting or ushering out an
incessant stream of patients.</p>

<p>George had not been long in the place before he made a surprising
discovery concerning this thriving practice. He and the little doctor
had the same telephone, by a plug-in arrangement which permitted each
to use the instrument in his own quarters while sharing the same number
and the same bill. Sometimes the telephone would ring at night, after
the doctor had departed for his home in Surrey, and George observed
that the callers were always women. They would demand the doctor in
voices that varied from accents of desperate entreaty to tones that
fairly crooned with voluptuous and sensual complaint. Where <i>was</i>
the doctor? When George informed them that he was at his home, some
twenty miles away, they would moan that it couldn't be true, that it
wasn't possible, that fate could assuredly not play them so cruel a
joke. When told that it was indeed so, they would then sometimes
suggest that perhaps George himself could render them some assistance
on his own account. To these requests he was forced to reply, often
with reluctance, that he was not a physician, and that they would have
to seek help in some other quarter.</p>

<p>These calls sharpened his curiosity, and he began to keep his eye
peeled during the doctor's office hours in the afternoon. He would go
to the window and look out each time the door-bell rang, and in a
little while he became convinced of what he had already begun to
suspect, "that the doctor's practice was devoted exclusively to women".
Their ages ranged from young womanhood to elderly haghood, they were of
all kinds and conditions, but the one thing that was true of these
patients was that they all wore skirts. No man ever rang that
door-bell.</p>

<p>George would sometimes tease Mrs. Purvis about this unending
procession of female visitors, and would openly speculate on the nature
of the doctor's practice. She had a capacity for self-deception which
one often encounters among people of her class, although the phenomenon
is by no means confined to it. No doubt she guessed some of the things
that went on below stairs, but her loyalty to anyone she served was so
unquestioning that when Geprge pressed her for information her manner
would instantly become vague, and she would confess that, although she
was not familiar with the technical details of the doctor's practice,
it was, she believed, devoted to "the treatment of nervous
diseases".</p>

<p>"Yes, but what kind of nervous diseases?" George would ask. "Don't
the gentlemen ever get nervous, too?"</p>

<p>"Ah-h," said Mrs. Purvis, nodding her head with an air of knowing
profundity that was very characteristic of her. "Ah-h, <i>there</i> you
'ave it!"</p>

<p>"Have what, Mrs. Purvis?"</p>

<p>"'Ave the hanswer," she said. "It's this Moddun Tempo. That's what
Doctor says," she went on loftily, in that tone of unimpeachable
authority with which she always referred to him and quoted his
opinions. "It's the pace of Moddun Life--cocktail parties, stayin' up
to all hours, and all of that. In America, I believe, conditions are
even worse," said Mrs. Purvis. "Not, of course, that they <i>really</i>
are," she added quickly, as if fearing that her remark might
inadvertently have wounded the patriotic sensibilities of her employer.
"I mean, after all, not 'avin' been there myself, I wouldn't know,
would I?"</p>

<p>Her picture of America, derived largely from the pages of the
tabloid newspapers, of which she was a devoted reader, was so
delightfully fantastic that George could never find it in his heart to
disillusion her. So he dutifully agreed that she was right, and even
managed, with a few skilful suggestions, to confirm her belief that
almost all American women spent their time going from one cocktail
party to another--in fact, practically never got to bed.</p>

<p>"Ah, then," said Mrs. Purvis, nodding her head wisely with an air of
satisfaction, "then you know what this Moddun Tempo means!" And, after
a just perceptible pause: "Shockin' I calls it!"</p>

<p>She called a great many things shocking. In fact, no choleric Tory
in London's most exclusive club could have been more vehemently and
indignantly concerned with the state of the nation than was Daisy
Purvis. To listen to her talk one might have thought she was the heir
to enormous estates that had been chief treasures of her country's
history since the days of the Norman conquerors, but which were now
being sold out of her hands, cut up piece-meal, ravaged and destroyed
because she could no longer pay the ruinous taxes which the government
had imposed. She would discuss these matters long and earnestly, with
dire forebodings, windy sighs, and grave shakings of the head.</p>

<p>George would sometimes work the whole night through and finally get
to bed at six or seven o'clock in the dismal fog of a London morning.
Mrs. Purvis would arrive at seven-thirty. If he was not already asleep
he would hear her creep softly up the stairs and go into the kitchen. A
little later she would rap at his door and come in with an enormous
cup, smoking with a beverage in whose soporific qualities she had the
utmost faith.</p>

<p>"'Ere's a nice 'ot cup of Ovaltine," said Mrs. Purvis, "to git you
off to sleep."</p>

<p>He was probably nearly "off to sleep" already, but this made no
difference. If he was not "off to sleep", she had the Ovaltine to "git
him off". And if he was "off to sleep", she woke him up and gave him
the Ovaltine to "git him off" again.</p>

<p>The real truth of the matter was that she wanted to talk with him,
to exchange gossip, and especially to go over the delectable
proceedings of the day's news. She would bring him fresh copies of
<i>The Times</i> and the <i>Daily Mail</i>, and she would have, of
course, her own tabloid paper. Then, while he propped himself up in bed
and drank his Ovaltine, Mrs. Purvis would stand in the doorway, rattle
her tabloid with a premonitory gesture, and thus begin:</p>

<p>"Shockin', I calls it!"</p>

<p>"What's shocking this morning, Mrs. Purvis?"</p>

<p>"Why, 'ere now, listen to this, if you please!" she would say
indignantly, and read as follows: "'It was announced yesterday, through
the offices of the Messrs. Merigrew &amp; Raspe, solicitors to 'Is
Grace, the Duke of Basingstoke, that 'Is Grace 'as announced for sale
'is estate at Chipping Cudlington in Gloucestershire. The estate,
comprisin' sixteen thousand acres, of which eight thousand are in
'untin' preserve, and includin' Basingstoke Hall, one of the finest
examples of early Tudor architecture in the kingdom, 'as been in the
possession of 'Is Grace's family since the fifteenth century.
Representatives of the Messrs. Merigrew &amp; Raspe stated, 'owever,
that because of the enormous increase in the estate and income taxes
since the war, 'Is Grace feels that it is no longer possible for 'im to
maintain the estate, and 'e is accordingly puttin' it up for sale. This
means, of course, that the number of 'Is Grace's private estates 'as
now been reduced to three, Fothergill 'All in Devonshire, Wintringham
in Yawkshire, and the Castle of Loch McTash, 'is 'untin' preserve in
Scotland. 'Is Grace, it is said, 'as stated recently to friends that if
somethin' is not done to check the present ruinous trend towards 'igher
taxation, there will not be a single great estate in England remainin'
in the 'ands of its original owners within a 'undred years...</p>

<p>"Ah-h," said Mrs. Purvis, nodding with an air of knowing
confirmation as she finished reading this dolorous item. "There you
'ave it! Just as 'Is Grace says, we're losin' all our great estates.
And what's the reason? Why the owners can no longer afford to pay the
taxes. Ruinous 'e calls 'em, and 'e's, right. If it keeps up, you mark
my words, the nobility'll 'ave no place left to live. A lot of 'em are
migratin' already," she said darkly.</p>

<p>"Migrating where, Mrs. Purvis?"</p>

<p>"Why," she said, "to France, to Italy, places on the Continent.
There is Lord Cricklewood, livin' somewhere in the south of France. And
why? Because the taxes got too 'igh for 'im. Let all 'is places go
'ere. Ah-h, lovely places they were, too," she said, with appetising
tenderness. "And the Earl of Pentateuch, Lady Cynthia Wormwood, and 'Er
Ladyship, the Dowager Countess of Throttlemarsh--where are they all?
They've all left, that's where they are. Packed up and got out. Let
their estates go. They've gone abroad to live. And why? Because the
taxes are too 'igh. Shockin', I calls it!"</p>

<p>By this time Mrs. Purvis's pleasant face would be pink with
indignation. It was one of the most astonishing demonstrations of
concern George had ever seen. Again and again he would try to get to
the bottom of it. He would bang down his cup of Ovaltine and burst
out:</p>

<p>"Yes, but good Lord, Mrs. Purvis, why should <i>you</i> worry so
much about it. Those people aren't going to starve. Here you get ten
shillings a week from me and eight shillings more from the doctor. He
says he's retiring and going abroad to live at the end of this year.
I'll be going back to America pretty soon after that. You don't even
know where you'll be or what you'll be doing this time next year. Yet
you come in here day after day and read me this stuff about the Duke of
Basingstoke or the Earl of Pentateuch having to give up one of his
half-dozen estates, as if you were afraid the whole lot of them would
have to go on the dole. You're the one who will have to go on the dole
if you get out of work. Those people are not going to suffer, not
really, not the way you'll have to."</p>

<p>"Ah-h yes," she answered quietly, in a tone that was soft and
gentle, as if she were speaking of the welfare of a group of helpless
children, "but then, we're used to it, aren't we? And <i>they</i>, poor
things, they're not."</p>

<p>It was appalling. He couldn't fathom it. He just felt as if he'd
come up smack against an impregnable wall. You could call it what you
liked--servile snobbishness, blind ignorance, imbecilic stupidity--but
there it was. You couldn't shatter it, you couldn't even shake it. It
was the most formidable example of devotion and loyalty he had ever
known.</p>

<p>These conversations would go on morning after morning until there
was scarcely an impoverished young viscount whose grandeurs and
miseries had not undergone the reverent investigation of Mrs. Purvis's
anguished and encyclopaedic care. But always at the end--after the
whole huge hierarchy of saints, angels, captains of the host, guardians
of the inner gate, and chief lieutenants of the right hand had been
tenderly inspected down to the minutest multicoloured feather that
blazed in their heraldic wings--silence would fall. It was as if some
great and unseen presence had entered the room. Then Mrs. Purvis would
rattle her crisp paper, clear her throat, and with holy quietness
pronounce the sainted name of "'E".</p>

<p>Sometimes this moment would come as a sequel to her fascinated
discussion of America and the Moddun Tempo, as, after enlarging for the
hundredth time upon the shocking and unfortunate lot of the female
population in the United States, she would add:</p>

<p>"I must say, though," tactfully, after a brief pause, "that the
American ladies <i>are</i> very smart, aren't they, sir? They're all so
well-turned out. You can always tell one when you see one. And then
they're <i>very</i> clever, aren't they, sir? I mean, quite a number of
'em 'ave been received at court, 'aven't they, sir? And some of 'em
'ave married into the nobility, too. And of course"--her voice would
fall to just the subtlest shade of unction, and George would know what
was coming--"of course, sir, 'E..."</p>

<p>Ah, there it was! Immortal "'E", who lived and moved and loved and
had his being there at the centre of Daisy Purvis's heaven! Immortal
"'E", the idol of all the Purvises everywhere, who, for <i>their</i>
uses, <i>their</i> devotions, had no other name and needed none but
"'E".</p>

<p>"Of course, sir," Mrs. Purvis said, "'E likes 'em, doesn't 'E? I'm
told 'E's very fond of 'em. The American ladies <i>must</i> be very
clever, sir, because 'E finds 'em so amusin'. There was a picture of
'Im in the news just recently with a party of 'Is friends, and a new
American lady was among 'em. At least I'd never seen <i>'er</i> face
before. And very smart she was, too--a Mrs. Somebody-or-other--I can't
recall the name."</p>

<p>Again, something in the day's news would bring the reverent tone to
her voice and the glow of tenderness to her face, as:</p>

<p>"Well, I see by the paper 'ere that 'E's got back from the
Continent. I wonder what 'E's up to now." And suddenly she laughed, a
jolly and involuntary laugh that flushed her pink cheeks almost crimson
and brought a mist to her blue eyes. "Ah! I tell you what," she said,
"'E <i>is</i> a deep one. You never know what 'E's been up to. You pick
the paper up one day and read where 'E's visitin' some friends in
Yawkshire. The next day, before you know it, 'E turns up in Vienna.
This time they say 'E's been in Scandinavia--it wouldn't surprise me if
'E's been over there visitin' one of them young princesses. Of
course"--her tone was now tinged with the somewhat pompous loftiness
with which she divulged her profounder revelations to the incondite Mr.
Webber--"of course there's been talk about <i>that</i> for some time
past. Not that 'E would care! Not <i>'Im</i>! 'E's too independent,
<i>'E</i> is! 'Is mother found that out long ago. She tried to manage
'Im the way she does the others. Not <i>'Im</i>! That chap's got a will
of 'Is own. 'E'll do what 'E wants to do, and no one will stop
'Im--that's 'ow independent 'E is."</p>

<p>She was silent a moment, reflecting with misty eyes upon the object
of her idolatry. Then suddenly her pleasant face again suffused with
ruddy colour, and a short, rich, almost explosive laugh burst from her
as she cried:</p>

<p>"The dev-<i>ill</i>! You know, they do say 'E was comin' 'ome one
night not long ago, and"--her voice lowered confidingly--"they do say
'E'd 'ad a bit too much, and"--her voice sank still lower, and in a
tone in which a shade of hesitancy was mixed with laughter, she went
on--"well, sir, they do say 'E was 'avin' 'Is troubles in gittin' 'ome.
They say that really 'E was 'avin' to support 'Imself, sir, by the
fence round St. James's Palace. But they do say, sir, that--ooh!
ha-ha-ha!"--she laughed suddenly and throatily. "You must excuse me,
sir, but I 'ave to larf when I think of it!" And then, slowly,
emphatically, with an ecstasy of adoration, Mrs. Purvis whispered:
"They say, sir, that the bobby on duty just outside the palace saw 'Im,
and came up to 'Im and said: 'Can I 'elp you, sir?' But not <i>'Im!</i>
'E wouldn't be 'elped! 'E's too proud, <i>'E</i> is! That's the way
'E's always been. I'll tell you what--'E <i>is</i> a dev-<i>ill!</i>"
And, still smiling, her strong hands held before her in a worn clasp,
she leaned against the door and lapsed into the silence of misty
contemplation.</p>

<p>"But, Mrs. Purvis," George remarked presently, "do you think he'll
ever get married? I mean, do you really, now? After all, he's no
chicken any longer, is he? And he must have had lots of chances, and if
he was going to do anything about it----"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Mrs. Purvis, in that tone of somewhat lofty recognition
that she always used at such a time. "<i>Ah!</i> What I always say to
<i>that</i> is, 'E <i>will!</i> 'E'll make up 'Is mind to it when 'E
'as to, but not before! 'E won't be driven into it, not 'Im! But 'E'll
do it when 'E knows it is the proper time."</p>

<p>"Yes, Mrs. Purvis, but what <i>is</i> the proper time?"</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "after all, there <i>is</i> 'Is father, isn't
there? And 'Is father is not as young as 'e used to be, <i>is</i> 'e?"
She was silent for a moment, diplomatically allowing the tactful
inference to sink in by itself. "Well, sir," she concluded very
quietly, "I mean to say, sir, a time <i>will</i> come, sir, won't
it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mrs. Purvis," George persisted, "but <i>will</i> it? I mean,
can you be sure? You know, you hear all sorts of things--even a
stranger like myself hears them. For one thing, you hear he doesn't
want it very much, and then, of course, there is his brother, isn't
there?"</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>'im</i>," said Mrs. Purvis, "<i>'im!</i>" For a brief
interval she remained silent, but had she filled an entire dictionary
with the vocabulary of bitter and unyielding hostility, she could not
have said more than she managed to convey in the two letters of that
mutilated little pronoun "<i>'im</i>."</p>

<p>"Yes," George persisted somewhat cruelly, "but after all, he
<i>wants</i> it, doesn't he?"</p>

<p>"'E does," said Mrs. Purvis grimly.</p>

<p>"And he <i>is</i> married, isn't he?"</p>

<p>"'E is," said Mrs. Purvis, if anything a trifle more grimly than
before.</p>

<p>"And <i>he</i> has children, hasn't he?"</p>

<p>"'E <i>'as</i>, yes," said Mrs. Purvis, somewhat more gently. In
fact, for a moment her face glowed with its look of former tenderness,
but it grew grim again very quickly as she went on: "But <i>'im</i>!
Not <i>'im</i>!" She was deeply stirred by this imagined threat to the
ascendancy of her idol. Her lips worked tremulously, then she shook her
head with a quick movement of inflexible denial and said: "Not
<i>'im</i>." She was silent for a moment more, as if a struggle were
going on between her desire to speak and the cool barrier of her
natural reserve. Then she burst out: "I tell you, sir, I never liked
the look of 'im! Not that one--no!" She shook her head again in a
half-convulsive movement; then, in a tone of dark confidingness, she
almost whispered: "There's somethin' <i>sly</i> about 'is face that I
don't like! 'E's a sly one, 'e is, but 'e don't fool <i>me!</i>" Her
face was now deeply flushed, and she nodded her head with the air of a
person who had uttered her grim and final judgment and would not budge
from it. "That's my opinion, if you ask me, sir! That's the way I've
always felt about 'im. And 'er. <i>'Er!</i> <i>She</i> wouldn't like
it, <i>would</i> she? Not 'arf she wouldn't!" She laughed suddenly, the
bitter and falsetto laugh of an angry woman. "Not <i>'er!</i> Why, it's
plain as clay, it's written all over 'er! But a lot of good it'll do
'em," she said grimly. "<i>We</i> know what's what!" She shook her head
again with grim decision. "The <i>people</i> know. They can't be
fooled. So let 'em git along with it!"</p>

<p>"You don't think, then, that they----"</p>

<p>"<i>Them!</i>" said Mrs. Purvis strongly. "<i>Them!</i> Not in a
million years, sir! Never! Never!...'E"--her voice fairly soared to a
cry of powerful conviction--"'E's the one! 'E's <i>always</i> been the
one! And when the time comes, sir, <i>'E--'E</i> will be King!"</p>

<p>In the complete and unquestioning loyalty of her character, Mrs.
Purvis was like a large and gentle dog. Indeed, her whole relation to
life was curiously animal-like. She had an intense concern for every
member of brute creation, and when she saw dogs or horses in the
streets she always seemed to notice first the animal and then the human
being that it belonged to. She had come to know and recognise all the
people in Ebury Street through the dogs they owned. When George
questioned her one clay about a distinguished-looking old gentleman
with a keen hawk's face whom he had passed several times on the street,
Mrs. Purvis answered immediately, with an air of satisfaction:</p>

<p>"Ah-h, yes. 'E's the one that 'as the rascal in 27. Ah-h, and 'e
<i>is</i> a rascal, too," she cried, shaking her head and laughing with
affectionate remembrance. "Big, shaggy fellow 'e is, you know, comin'
along, swingin' 'is big shoulders, and looking' as if butter wouldn't
melt in 'is mouth. 'E is a <i>rascal</i>."</p>

<p>George was a little bewildered by this time and asked her if she
meant the gentleman or the dog.</p>

<p>"Oh, the dog," cried Mrs. Purvis. "The dog! A big Scotch shepherd 'e
is. Belongs to the gentleman you were speakin' of. Gentleman's some
sort of scholar or writer or professor, I believe. Used to be up at
Cambridge. Retired now. Lives in 27."</p>

<p>Or again, looking out of the window one day into the pea-soup
drizzle of the street, George saw an astonishingly beautiful girl pass
by upon the other side. He called Mrs. Purvis quickly, pointed out the
girl, and excitedly demanded:</p>

<p>"Who is she? Do you know her? Does she live here on the street?"</p>

<p>"I can't say, sir," Mrs. Purvis answered, looking puzzled. "It seems
I must 'ave seen 'er before, but I can't be sure. But I will just keep
my eyes open and I'll let you know if I find out where she lives."</p>

<p>A few days later Mrs. Purvis came in from her morning's shopping
tour, beaming with satisfaction and full of news. "Ah-h," she said, "I
'ave news for you. I found out about the girl."</p>

<p>"What girl?" he said, looking up startled from his work.</p>

<p>"The girl you asked about the other day," said Mrs. Purvis. "The one
you pointed out to me."</p>

<p>"Oh yes," he said, getting up. "And what about her? Does shelive
here in the street?"</p>

<p>"Of course," said Mrs. Purvis. "I've seen 'er a 'undred times. I
should 'ave known 'er in a second the other day, only she didn't 'ave
<i>'im</i> with 'er."</p>

<p>"Him? Who?"</p>

<p>"Why, the rascal down at 46. That's who she is."</p>

<p>"That's who who is, Mrs. Purvis?"</p>

<p>"Why, the great Dane, of course. You must 'ave seen <i>'im</i>. 'E's
big as a Shetland pony," she laughed. "'E's always with 'er. The only
time I ever saw 'er without 'im was the other day, and that's why," she
cried triumphantly, "I didn't know 'er. But to-day, they were out
takin' a walk together and I saw 'em comin'...Then I knew who she was.
They're the ones in 46. And the rascal"--here shelaughed
affectionately--"ah-h, what a rascal 'e is! Oh, a fine fellow, you
know. So big and strong 'e is. I sometimes wonder where they keep 'im,
'ow they found a 'ouse big enough to put 'im in."</p>

<p>Hardly a morning passed that she didn't return from her little tour
of the neighbourhood flushed with excitement over some new "rascal",
some "fine fellow", some dog or horse she had observed and watched. She
would go crimson with anger over any act of cruelty or indifference to
an animal. She would come in boiling with rage because she had passed a
horse that had been tightly bridled:</p>

<p>"...And I gave 'im a piece of my mind, too," she would cry,
referring to the driver. "I told 'im that a man as mistreated a hanimal
in that way wasn't fit to 'ave one. If there'd been a constable about,
I'd 'ave 'ad 'im took in custody, that's what I'd 'ave done. I told 'im
so, too. Shockin', I calls it. The way some people can b'ave to some
poor, 'elpless beast that 'as no tongue to tell what it goes through.
Let 'em 'ave a bridle in <i>their</i> mouth a bit! Let 'em go round for
a while with <i>their</i> faces shut up in a muzzle! Ah-h," she would
say grimly, as if the idea afforded her a savage pleasure, "that'd
teach 'em! They'd know then, all right!"</p>

<p>There was something disturbing and unwholesome about the
extravagance of this feeling for animals. George observed Mrs. Purvis
closely in her relations with people and found out that she was by no
means so agitated at the spectacle of human suffering. Her attitude
towards the poor, of whom she was one, was remarkable for its
philosophic acceptance. Her feeling seemed to be that the poor are
always with us, that they are quite used to their poverty, and that
this makes it unnecessary for anybody to bother about it, least of all
the miserable victims themselves. It had certainly never entered her
head that anything should be done about it. The sufferings of the poor
seemed to her as natural and as inevitable as the London fog, and to
her way of thinking it was just as much a waste of honest emotion to
get worked up about the one as about the other.</p>

<p>Thus, on the same morning that she would come in blazing with
indignation over the mistreatment of a dog or horse, George would
sometimes hear her speak sharply, curtly, and without a trace of
feeling to the dirty, half-starved, and half-naked devil of a boy who
always delivered the beer from the liquor shop. This wretched child was
like some creature out of Dickens--a living specimen of that poverty
which, at its worst, has always seemed to be lower and more degraded in
England than anywhere else. The thing that gives it its special horror
is that in England people of this type appear to be stogged to their
misery, sucked down in a swamp of inherited wretchedness which is never
going to be any better, and from which they know they can never
escape.</p>

<p>So it was with this God-forsaken boy. He was one of the Little
People--that race of dwarfs and gnomes which was suddenly and' terribly
revealed to George that winter in London. George discovered that there
arc really two different orders of humanity in England, and they are so
far apart that they hardly seem to belong to the same species. They are
the Big People and the Little People.</p>

<p>The Big People are fresh-skinned, ruddy, healthy, and alert; they
show by their appearance that they have always had enough to eat. At
their physical best, they look like great bulls of humanity. On the
streets of London one sees these proud and solid figures of men and
women, magnificently dressed and cared for, and one observes that their
faces wear the completely vacant and imperturbable expressions of
highly bred cattle. These are the British Lords of Creation. And among
the people who protect and serve them, and who are really a part of
their own order, one also sees some magnificent specimens--strapping
Guardsmen, for example, six feet five inches tall and as straight as
lances, with the same assured look in their faces, which says plainly
that though they may not be the Lords of Creation themselves, at any
rate they are the agents and instruments of the Lords.</p>

<p>But if one stays in England long enough, all of a sudden one day he
is going to discover the Little People. They are a race of gnomes who
look as if they have burrowed in tunnels and lived for so many
centuries in underground mines that they have all become pale and small
and wizened. Something in their faces and in the gnarled formations of
their bodies not only shows the buried lives they live, but also
indicates that their fathers and mothers and grandparents for
generations before them were similarly starved of food and sunlight and
were bred like gnomes in the dark and deep-delved earth.</p>

<p>One hardly notices them at first. But then, one day, the Little
People swarm up to the surface of the earth, and for the first time one
sees them. That is the way the revelation came to George Webber, and it
was an astounding discovery. It was like a kind of terrible magic to
realise suddenly that he had been living in this English world and
seeing only one part of it, thinking it was the whole. It was not that
the Little People were few in number. Once he saw them, they seemed to
be almost the whole population. They outnumbered the Big People ten to
one. And after he saw them, he knew that England could never look the
same to him again, and that nothing he might read or hear about the
country thereafter would make sense to him if it did not take the
Little People into account.</p>

<p>The wretched boy from the liquor shop was one of them. Everything
about him proclaimed eloquently that he had been born dwarfed and
stunted into a world of hopeless poverty, and that he had never had
enough to eat, or enough clothes to warm him, or enough shelter to keep
the cold fogs from seeping through into the very marrow of his bones.
It was not that he was actually deformed, but merely that his body
seemed to be shrivelled and shrunk and squeezed of its juices like that
of an old man. He may have been fifteen or sixteen years old, though
there were times when he seemed younger. Always, however, his
appearance was that of an under-grown man, and one had the horrible
feeling that his starved body had long since given up the unequal
struggle and would never grow any more.</p>

<p>He wore a greasy, threadbare little jacket, tightly buttoned, from
the sleeves of which his raw wrists and large, grimy, work-reddened
hands protruded with almost indecent nakedness. His trousers, tight as
a couple of sausage skins, were equally greasy and threadbare, and were
inches too short for him. His old and broken shoes were several sizes
too big, and from the battered look of them they must have helped to
round the edges of every cobble-stone in stony-hearted London. This
costume was completed by a shapeless old hulk of a cap, so large and
baggy that it slopped over on one side of his head and buried the
ear.</p>

<p>What his features were like it was almost impossible to know,
because he was so dirty. His flesh, what one could see of it through
the unwashed grime, had a lifeless, opaque pallor. The whole face was
curiously blurred and blunted, as if it had been moulded hastily and
roughly out of tallow. The nose was wide and flat, and turned up at the
end to produce great, flaring nostrils. The mouth was thick and dull,
and looked as if it had been pressed into the face with a blunt
instrument. The eyes were dark and dead.</p>

<p>This grotesque little creature even spoke a different language. It
was Cockney, of course, but not sharp, decisive Cockney; it was a kind
of thick, catarrhal jargon, so blurred in the muttering that it was
almost indecipherable. George could hardly understand him at all. Mrs.
Purvis could make better sense of it, but even she confessed that there
were times when she did not know what he was talking about. George
would hear her beginning to rail at him the instant he came staggering
into the house beneath the weight of a heavy case of beer:</p>

<p>"'Ere, now, mind where you're goin', won't you? And try not to make
so much noise with those bottles! Why can't you wipe those muddy boots
before you come in the 'ouse? Don't come clumpin' up the stairs like an
'orse!...Oh," she would cry in despair, turning to George, "'e is the
clumsiest chap I ever saw!...And why can't you wash your face once in a
while?" she would say, striking again at the urchin with her sharp
tongue. "A great, growin' chap like you ought to be ashamed goin' about
where people can see you with a face like that!"</p>

<p>"Yus," he muttered sullenly, "goin' abaht wiv a fyce lahk that. If
you 'ad to go abaht the wye I do, you'd wash your fyce, wouldn't
yer?"</p>

<p>Then, still muttering resentfully to himself, he would clump down
the stairs and go away, and from the front window George would watch
him as he trudged back up the street towards the wine and liquor shop
in which he worked.</p>

<p>This store was small, but since the neighbourhood was fashionable
the place had that atmosphere of mellow luxury and quiet
elegance--something about it a little worn, but all the better for
being a little worn--that one finds in small, expensive shops of this
sort in England. It was as if the place were mildly tinctured with fog,
touched a little with the weather, and with the indefinable but faintly
exciting smell of soft coal smoke. And over everything, permeating the
very woods of the counter, shelves, and floor, hung the fragrance of
old wines and the purest distillations of fine liquors.</p>

<p>You opened the door, and a little bell tinkled gently. You took a
half-step down into the shop, and immediately its atmosphere made you
feel at peace. You felt opulent and secure. You felt all the powerful
but obscure seductions of luxury (which, if you have money, you can
feel in England better than anywhere else). You felt rich and able to
do anything. You felt that the world was good, and overflowing with
delectable delicacies, and that all of them were yours for the
asking.</p>

<p>The proprietor of this luxurious little nest of commerce seemed just
exactly the man for such an office. He was middle-aged, of medium
height, spare of build, with pale brown eyes and brown
moustaches--wispy, rather long, and somewhat lank. He wore a wing
collar, a black necktie, and a scarf-pin. He usually appeared in
shirt-sleeves, but he dispelled any suggestion of improper informality
by wearing arm protectors of black silk. This gave him just the proper
touch of unctuous yet restrained servility. He was middle class--not
middle class as America knows it, not even middle class as the English
usually know it--but a very special kind of middle class, serving
middle class, as befitted a purveyor of fine comforts to fine
gentlemen. He was there to serve the gentry, to live upon the gentry,
to exist by, through, and for the gentry, and always to bend a little
at the waist when gentry came.</p>

<p>As you entered the shop, he would come forward behind his counter,
say "Good evening, sir," with just the proper note of modified
servility, make some remark about the weather, and then, arching his
thin, bony, sandily-freckled hands upon the counter, he would bend
forwards slightly--wing collar, black necktie, black silk arm
protectors, moustache, pale brown eyes, pale, false smile, and all the
rest of him--and with servile attentiveness, not quite fawning, would
wait to do your bidding.</p>

<p>"What is good to-day? Have you a claret, a sound yet modestly-priced
vintage you can recommend?"</p>

<p>"A claret, sir?" in silken tones. "We have a good one, sir, and not
expensive either. A number of our patrons have tried it. They all
pronounce it excellent. You'll not go wrong, sir, if you try this
one."</p>

<p>"And how about a Scotch whisky?"</p>

<p>"A Haig, sir?" Again the silken tones. "You'll not go wrong on Haig,
sir. But perhaps you'd like to try another brand, something a trifle
rare, a little more expensive, perhaps a little more mature. Some of
our patrons have tried this one, sir. It costs a shilling more, but if
you like the smoky flavour you'll find it worth the difference."</p>

<p>Oh, the fond, brisk slave! The fond, neat slave! The fond slave
bending at the waist, with bony fingers arched upon his counter! The
fond slave with his sparse hair neatly parted in the middle, and the
narrow forehead arched with even corrugations of pale wrinkles as the
face lifted upwards with its thin, false smile! Oh, this fond, brisk
pander to fine gentlemen--and that wretched boy! For suddenly, in the
midst of all this show of eager servitude, this painted counterfeit of
warmth, the man would turn like a snarling cur upon that miserable
child, who stood there sniffling through his catarrhal nose, shuffling
his numbed feet for circulation, and chafing his reddened, chapped,
work-coarsened hands before the cheerful, crackling fire of coals:</p>

<p>"Here, now, what are you hanging round the shop for? Have you
delivered that order to Number 12 yet? Be on your way, then, and don't
keep the gentleman waiting any longer!"</p>

<p>And then immediately the grotesque return to silken courtesy, to the
pale, false smile again, to the fawning unctions of his "Yes, sir. A
dozen bottles, sir. Within thirty minutes, sir. To Number 42--oh, quite
so, sir. Good night."</p>

<p>And good night, good night, good night to you, my fond, brisk slave,
you backbone of a nation's power. Good night to you, staunch symbol of
a Briton's rugged independence. Good night to you, and to your wife,
your children, and your mongrel tyranny over their lives. Good night to
you, my little autocrat of the dinner-table. Good night to you, my lord
and master of the Sunday leg of mutton. Good night to you, my
gentlemen's pander in Ebury Street.</p>

<p>And good night to you, as well, my wretched little boy, my little
dwarf, my gnome, my grimy citizen from the world of the Little
People.</p>

<p>The fog drifts thick and fast to-night into the street. It sifts and
settles like a cloak, until one sees the street no longer. And where
the shop light shines upon the fog, there burns a misty glow, a blurred
and golden bloom of radiance, of comfort, and of warmth. Feet pass the
shop, men come ghostwise from the fog's thick mantle, are for a moment
born, are men again, are heard upon the pavement, then, wraithlike,
vanish into fog, are ghosts again, are lost, are gone. The proud, the
mighty, and the titled of the earth, the lovely and protected, too, go
home--home to their strong and sheltered walls behind the golden nimbus
of other lights, fog-flowered. Four hundred yards away the tall
sentries stamp and turn and march again. All's glory here. All's strong
as mortared walls. All's loveliness and joy within this best of
worlds.</p>

<p>And you, you wretched child, so rudely and unfitly wrenched into
this world of glory, wherever you must go to-night, in whatever doorway
you must sleep, upon whatever pallet of foul-smelling straw, within
whatever tumbled warren of old brick, there in the smoke, the fog-cold
welter, and the swarming web of old, unending London--sleep well as can
be, and hug the ghosts of warmth about you as you remember the
forbidden world and its imagined glory. So, my little gnome, good
night. May God have mercy on us all.</p>

<h2><a name="chapter5-33"></a>33. Enter Mr. Lloyd McHarg</h2>

<p>During the late autumn and early winter of that year occurred an
event which added to Webber's chronicle the adventure of an
extraordinary experience. He had received no news from America for
several weeks when, suddenly in November, he began to get excited
letters from his friends, informing him of a recent incident that bore
directly on his own career.</p>

<p>The American novelist, Mr. Lloyd McHarg, had just published a new
book which had been instantly and universally acclaimed as a monument
of national significance, as well as the crowning achievement in
McHarg's brilliant literary career. George had read in the English
press brief accounts of the book's tremendous success, but now he began
to receive enlargements on the news from his friends at home. Mr.
McHarg, it seemed, had given an interview to reporters, and to the
astonishment of everyone had begun to talk, not about his own book, but
about Webber's. Cuttings of the interview were sent to George. He read
them with astonishment, and with the deepest and most earnest
gratitude.</p>

<p>George had never met Mr. Lloyd McHarg. He had never had occasion to
communicate with him in any way. He knew him only through his books. He
was, of course, one of the chief figures in American letters, and now,
at the zenith of his career, when he had won the greatest ovation one
could win, he had seized the occasion, which most men would have
employed for purposes of self-congratulation, to praise
enthusiastically the work of an obscure young writer who was a total
stranger to him and who had written only one book.</p>

<p>It seemed to George then, as it seemed to him ever afterwards, one
of the most generous acts he had ever known, and when he had somewhat
recovered from the astonishment and joy which this unexpected news had
produced in him, he sat down and wrote to Mr. McHarg and told him how
he felt. In a short time he had an answer from him--a brief note,
written from New York. Mr. McHarg said that he had spoken as he had
because he felt that way about Webber's book, and that he was happy to
have had the opportunity of giving public acknowledgment to his
feeling. He said that he was about to be awarded an honorary degree by
one of America's leading universities--an event which, he confessed
with pardonable pride, pleased him all the more because the award was
to be made out of season, in special recognition of his last book, and
because the ceremony attending it was not to be part of the usual
performance of trained seals at commencement time. He said that he was
sailing for Europe immediately afterwards and would spend some time on
the Continent, that he would be in England a little later, and that he
hoped to see Webber then. George wrote back and told him he was looking
forward to their meeting, gave him his address, and there for a time
the matter rested.</p>

<p>Mrs. Purvis was a party to George's elation, which was so exultant
that he could not have kept the reason a secret from her if he had
tried. She was almost as excited about his impending meeting with Mr.
McHarg as he was. Together they would scan the papers for news of Mr.
McHarg. One morning she brought the "nice 'ot cup" of Ovaltine, rattled
the pages of her tabloid paper, and said:</p>

<p>"I see where 'e is on 'is way. 'E's sailed already from New
York."</p>

<p>A few days later George smacked the crisp sheets of <i>The Times</i>
and cried: "He's there! He's landed! He's in Europe! It won't be long
now!"</p>

<p>Then came the never-to-be-forgotten morning when she brought the
usual papers, and with them the day's mail, and in the mail a letter
from Fox Edwards, enclosing a long clipping from <i>The New York
Times</i>. This was a full account of the ceremonies at which Mr.
McHarg had been awarded his honorary degree. Before a distinguished
gathering at the great university Mr. McHarg had made a speech, and the
clipping contained an extended quotation of what he had had to say.
George had not foreseen it. He had not imagined it could happen. His
name shot up at him from the serried columns of close print and
exploded in his eyes like shrapnel. A hard knot gathered in his throat
and choked him. His heart leaped, skipped, hammered at his ribs. McHarg
had put Webber in his speech, had spoken of him there at half a
column's length. He had hailed the younger man as a future spokesman of
his country's spirit, an evidence of a fruition that had come, of a
continent that had been discovered. He called Webber a man of genius,
and held his name before the mighty of the earth as a pledge of what
America was, and a token of where it would go.</p>

<p>And suddenly George remembered who he was, and saw the journey he
had come. He remembered Locust Street in Old Catawba twenty years
before and Nebraska, Randy, and the Potterhams, Aunt Maw and Uncle
Mark, his father and the little boy that he had been, with the hills
closing in round him, and at night the whistles wailing northward
towards the world. And now his name, whose name was nameless, had
become a shining thing, and a boy who once had waited tongueless in the
South had, through his language, opened golden gateways to the
Earth.</p>

<p>Mrs. Purvis felt it almost as much as he did. He pointed speechless
to the clipping. He tapped the shining passages with trembling hand. He
thrust the clipping at her. She read it, flushed crimson in the face,
turned suddenly, and went away.</p>

<p>After that they waited daily for McHarg's coming. Week lengthened
into week. They searched the papers every morning for news of him. He
seemed to be making a tour of Europe, and everywhere he went he was
entertained and feted and interviewed and photographed in the company
of other famous men. Now he was in Copenhagen. Now he was staying in
Berlin a week or two. Later he had gone to Baden-Baden for a cure.</p>

<p>"Oh Lord!" George groaned dismally. "How long does that take?"</p>

<p>Again he was in Amsterdam; and then silence. Christmas came.</p>

<p>"I should 'ave thought," said Mrs. Purvis, "'e'd be 'ere by
now."</p>

<p>New Year's came, and still there was no word from Lloyd McHarg.</p>

<p>One morning about the middle of January, after George had worked all
night, and now, in bed, was carrying on his usual chat with Mrs.
Purvis, he had just spoken of McHarg's long-deferred arrival rather
hopelessly--when the phone rang. Mrs. Purvis went into the sitting-room
and answered it. George could hear her saying formally:</p>

<p>"Yes. Who shall I say? Who's callin', please?" A waiting silence.
Then, rather quickly: "Just a moment, sir." She entered George's room,
her face flushed, and said: "Mr. Lloyd Mc'Arg is on the wire."</p>

<p>To say that George got out of bed would be to give a hopelessly
inadequate description of a movement which hurled him into the air,
bedclothes and all, as if he had been shot out of a cannon. He landed
squarely in his bedroom slippers, and in two strides, still shedding
bedclothes as he went, he was through the door, into the sitting-room,
and had the receiver in his hand.</p>

<p>"Hello, hello, hello!" he stammered. "Who--what--is that?"</p>

<p>McHarg was even quicker. His voice, rapid, feverish, somewhat nasal
and high-pitched, unmistakably American, stabbed nervously across the
wire and said:</p>

<p>"Hello, hello. Is that you, George?" He called him by his first name
immediately. "How are you, son? How are you, boy? How are they
'treating you?"</p>

<p>"Fine, Mr. McHarg!" George yelled. "It <i>is</i> Mr. McHarg, isn't
it? Say, Mr. McHarg-----"</p>

<p>"Now take it easy! Take it easy!" he cried feverishly. "Don't shout
so loud!" he yelled. "I'm not in New York, you know!"</p>

<p>"I know you're not," George screamed. "That's what I was just about
to say!"--laughing idiotically. "Say, Mr. McHarg, when can we----"</p>

<p>"Now wait a minute, wait a minute! Let me do the talking. Don't get
so excited. Now listen, George!" His voice had the staccato rapidity of
a telegraph ticker. Even though one bad never seen him, one would have
got instantly an accurate impression of his feverishly nervous
vitality, wire-taut tension, and incessant activity. "Now listen!" he
barked. "I want to see you and talk to you. We'll have lunch together
and talk things over."</p>

<p>"Fine! F-fine!" George stuttered. "I'll be delighted! Any time you
say. I know you're busy. I can meet you to-morrow, next day,
Friday--next week if that suits you better."</p>

<p>"Next week, hell 1" he rasped. "How much time do you think I've got
to wait around for lunch? You're coming here for lunch to-day. Come on!
Get busy! Get a move on you!" he cried irritably. "How long will it take
you to get here, anyway?"</p>

<p>George asked him where he was staying, and he gave an address on one
of the streets near St. James's and Piccadilly. It was only a
ten-minute ride in a taxi, but since it was not yet ten o'clock in the
morning George suggested that he arrive there around noon.</p>

<p>"What? Two hours? For Christ's sake!" McHarg cried in a
high-pitched, irritated voice. "Where the hell do you live anyway? In
the north of Scotland?"</p>

<p>George told him no, that he was only ten minutes away, but that he
thought he might want to wait two or three hours before he had his
lunch.</p>

<p>"Wait two or three hours?" he shouted. "Say, what the hell is this,
anyway? How long do you expect me to wait for lunch? You don't keep
people waiting two or three hours every time you have lunch with them,
do you, George?" he said, in a milder but distinctly aggrieved tone of
voice. "Christ, man! A guy'd starve to death if he had to wait on
you!"</p>

<p>George was getting more and more bewildered, and wondered if it was
the custom of famous writers to have lunch at ten o'clock in the
morning, but he stammered hastily:</p>

<p>"No, no, certainly not, Mr. McHarg. I can come any time you say. It
will only take me t y minutes or half an hour."</p>

<p>"I thought you said you were only ten minutes away?"</p>

<p>"I know, but I've got to dress and shave first."</p>

<p>"Dress! Shaver" McHarg yelled. "For Christ's sake, you mean to tell
me you're not out of bed yet? What do you do? Sleep till noon every
day? How in the name of God do you ever get any work done?"</p>

<p>By this time George felt so crushed that he did not dare tell McHarg
that he was not only not out of bed, but that he'd hardly been to
bed yet; somehow it seemed impossible to confess that he had worked all
night. He did not know what new explosion of derision or annoyance this
might produce, so he compromised and mumbled some lame excuse about
having worked late the night before.</p>

<p>"Well, come on, then!" he cried impatiently, before the words were
out of George's mouth. "Snap out of it! Hop into a taxi and come on up
here as soon as you can. Don't stop to shave," he said curtly. "I've
been with a Dutchman for the last three days and I'm hungry as
hell!"</p>

<p>With these cryptic words he banged the receiver up in George's eat,
leaving him to wonder, in a state of stunned bewilderment, just why
being with a Dutchman for three days should make anyone hungry as
hell.</p>

<p>Mrs. Purvis already had a clean shirt and his best suit of clothes
laid out for him by the time he returned to his room. While he put them
on she got out the brush and the shoe polish, took his best pair of
shoes just beyond the open door into the sitting-room, and went right
down on her knees and got to work on them. And while she laboured on
them she called in to him, a trifle wistfully:</p>

<p>"I do 'ope 'e gives you a good lunch. We was 'avin' gammon and peas
again to-day. Ah-h, a prime bit, too. I 'ad just put 'em on when 'e
called."</p>

<p>"Well, I hate to miss them, Mrs. Purvis," George called back, as he
struggled into his trousers. "But you go on and eat them, and don't
worry about me. I'll get a good lunch."</p>

<p>"'E'll take you to the Ritz, no doubt," she called again a trifle
loftily.</p>

<p>"Oh," George answered easily as he pulled on his shirt, "I don't
think he likes those places. People of that sort," he shouted with
great assurance, as if he were on intimate terms with "people of that
sort"--"they don't go in for swank as a rule. He's probably bored stiff
with it, particularly after all he's been through these past few weeks.
He'd probably much rather go to some simple place."</p>

<p>"Um. Shouldn't wonder," said Mrs. Purvis reflectively. "Meetin' all
them artists and members of the nobility. Probably fed up with it, I
should think," she said. "I know I should be," which meant that she
would have given only her right eye for the opportunity. "You might
take 'im to Simpson's, you know," she said in the offhand manner that
usually accompanied her most important contributions.</p>

<p>"There's an idea," George cried. "Or to Stone's Chop House in Panton
Street."</p>

<p>"Ah yes," she said. "That's just off the 'Ay Market, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, runs between the Hay Market and Leicester Square," George
said, tying his tie. "An old place, you know, two hundred years or
more, not quite so fancy as Simpson's, but he might like it better on
that account. They don't let women in," he added with a certain air of
satisfaction, as if this in itself would probably recommend the place
to his distinguished host.</p>

<p>"Yes, and their ale, they say, is grand," said Mrs. Purvis.</p>

<p>"It's the colour of mahogany," George said, throwing on his coat,
"and it goes down like velvet. I've tried it, Mrs. Purvis. They bring
it to you in a silver tankard. And after two of them you'd send flowers
to your own mother-in-law."</p>

<p>She laughed suddenly and heartily and came bustling in with the
shoes, her pleasant face suffused with pink colour.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sir," she said, setting the shoes down. "But you do 'ave
a way of puffin' things. I 'ave to larf sometimes...1 Still, in
Simpson's--you won't go wrong in Simpson's, you know," said Mrs.
Purvis, who had never seen any of these places in her whole life. "If
'e likes mutton--ah-h, I tell you what," she said with satisfaction,
"you do get a prime bit of mutton there."</p>

<p>He put on his shoes and noted that only ten minutes had passed since
Mr. McHarg hung up. He was now dressed and ready, so he started out the
door and down the stairs, flinging on lovercoat as he descended.
Despite the early hour, his appetite ad been whetted by his
conversation, and he felt that he would be able to do full justice to
his lunch. He had reached the street and was hailing a taxi when Mrs.
Purvis came running after him, waving a clean handkerchief, which she
put neatly in the breast-pocket of his coat. He thanked her and
signalled again to the taxi.</p>

<p>It was one of those old, black, hearselike contraptions with a
baggage rack on top which, to an American, used to the gaudy, purring
thunderbolts of the New York streets, seem like Victorian relics, and
which are often, indeed, driven by elderly Jehus with walrus moustaches
who were driving hansom cabs at the time of Queen Victoria's jubilee.
This ancient vehicle now rolled sedately towards him, on the wrong side
of the street as usual--which is to say, on the right side for the
English.</p>

<p>George opened the door, gave the walrus the address, and told him to
make haste, that the occasion was pressing. He said: "Very good, sir,"
with courteous formality, wheeled the old crate round, and rolled
sedately up the street again at exactly the same pace, which was about
twelve miles an hour. They passed the grounds of Buckingham Palace,
wheeled into the Mall, turned up past St. James's Palace into Pall
Mall, thence into St. James's Street, and in a moment more drew up
before McHarg's address.</p>

<p>It was a bachelors' chambers, one of those quiet and sedate-looking
places that one finds in England, and that are so wonderfully
comfortable if one has the money. Inside, the appointments suggested a
small and very exclusive club. George spoke to a man in the tiny
office. He answered:</p>

<p>"Mr. McHarg? Of course, sir. He is expecting you...John," to a young
man in uniform and brass buttons, "take the gentleman up."</p>

<p>They entered the lift. John closed the door carefully, gave a
vigorous tug to the rope, and sedately they crept up, coming to a more
or less accurate halt, after a few more manipulations of the rope, at
one of the upper floors. John opened the door, stepped out with an "If
you please, sir," and led off down the hall to a door which stood
partially open and from which there came a confused hum of voices. John
rapped gently, entered in response to the summons, and said
quietly:</p>

<p>"Mr. Webber calling, sir."</p>

<p>There were three men in the room, but so astonishing was the sight
of McHarg that at first George did not notice the other two. McHarg was
standing in the middle of the floor with a glass in one hand and a
bottle of Scotch whisky in the other, preparing to pour himself a
drink. When he saw George he looked up quickly, put the bottle down,
and advanced with his hand extended in greeting. There was something
almost terrifying in his appearance. George recognised him instantly.
He had seen McHarg's pictures many times, but he now realised how
beautifully unrevealing are the uses of photography. He was
fantastically ugly, and to this ugliness was added a devastation of
which George had never seen the equal.</p>

<p>The first and most violent impression was his astonishing redness.
Everything about him was red--hair, large protuberant ears, eyebrows,
eyelids, even his bony, freckled, knuckly hands. (As George noticed the
hands he understood why everyone who knew him called him "Knuckles".)
Moreover, it was a most alarming redness. His face was so red that it
seemed to throw off heat, and if at that moment smoke had begun to
issue from his nostrils and he had burst out in flames all over, George
would hardly have been surprised.</p>

<p>His face did not have that fleshy and high-coloured floridity that
is often seen in men who have drunk too long and too earnestly. It was
not like that at all. McHarg was thin to the point of emaciation. He
was very tall, six feet two or three, and his excessive thinness and
angularity made him seem even taller. George thought he looked ill and
wasted. His face, which was naturally a wry, puckish sort of face--as
one got to know it better, a pugnacious but very attractive kind of
face, full of truculence, but also with an impish humour and a homely,
Yankee, freckled kind of modesty that were wonderfully engaging--this
face now looked as puckered up as if it were permanently about to
swallow a half-green persimmon, and it also seemed to be all dried out
and blistered by the fiery flames that burned in it. And out of this
face peered two of the most remarkable-looking eyes in all the world.
Their colour must originally have been light blue, but now they were so
bleached and faded that they looked as if they had been poached.</p>

<p>He came towards George quickly, with his bony, knuckled hand
extended in greeting, his lips twitching and bared nervously over his
large teeth, his face turned wryly upwards and to one side in an
expression that was at once truculent, nervously apprehensive, and yet
movingly eloquent of something fiercely and permanently wounded,
something dreadfully lacerated, something so tender and unarmed in the
soul and spirit of the man that life had got in on him at a thousand
points and slashed him to ribbons. He took George's hand and shook it
vigorously, at the same time bristling up to him with his wry and
puckered face like a small boy to another before the fight begins, as
if to say: "Go on, now, go on. Knock that chip off my shoulder. I dare
and double-dare you." This was precisely his manner now, except that he
said:</p>

<p>"Why you--why you monkeyfied--why you monkeyfied bastard, you! Just
look at him!" he cried suddenly in a high-pitched voice, half-turning
to his companions. "Why you--who the hell ever told you you could
write, anyway?" Then cordially: "George, how are you? Come on in, come
on over here!"</p>

<p>And, still holding Webber's hand in his bony grip, and taking his
arm with his other hand, he led him across the room towards his other
guests. Then, suddenly releasing him, and striking a pompous oratorical
attitude, he began to declaim in the florid accents of an after-dinner
speaker:</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen, it is my peculiar privilege, and I may even
say my distinguished honour, to present to the members of the Hog Head
Hollow Ladies Leeterary, Arteestic, and Mutual Culshural Society our
esteemed guest of honour--a man who writes books that are so God-damned
long that few people can even pick 'em up. A man whose leeterary style
is distinguished by such a command of beautiful English as she is wrote
that he has rarely been known to use less than twenty-one adjectives
where four would do."</p>

<p>He changed abruptly, dropped his oratorical attitude, and laughed a
sudden, nervous, dry, falsetto laugh, at the same time mauling Webber
in the ribs with a bony finger. "How do you like that, George?" he said
with immediate friendly warmth. "Does that get 'em? Is that the way
they do it? Not bad, eh?" He was obviously pleased with his effort.</p>

<p>"George," he now continued in a natural tone of voice, "I want you
to meet two friends of mine. Mr. Bendien, of Amsterdam," he said,
presenting Webber to a heavy-set, red-faced, elderly Dutchman, who sat
by the table within easy reaching distance of a tall brown crock of
Holland gin, of which, to judge from his complexion, he had already
consumed a considerable quantity.</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen," cried McHarg, striking another attitude,
"allow me to introduce that stupendous, that death-defying, that
thrill-packed wonder of the ages, that hair-raising and spine-tingling
act which has thrilled most of the crowned heads of Europe and all of
the deadheads of Amsterdam. Now appearing absolutely for the first time
under the big tent. Ladies and gentlemen, I now take pleasure in
introducing Mynheer Cornelius Bendien, the Dutch maestro, who will
perform for you his celebrated act of balancing an eel on the end of
his nose while he swallows in rapid succession, without pausing for
breath, three--count 'em--three brown jugs of the finest imported
Holland gin. Mr. Bendien, Mr. Webber...How was that, boy, how was
that?" said McHarg, laughing his shrill falsetto, and turning and
prodding Webber again with an eager finger.</p>

<p>Then, somewhat more curtly, he said: "You may have met Mr. Donald
Stoat before. He tells me that he knows you."</p>

<p>The other man looked out from underneath his heavy eyebrows and
inclined his head pompously. "I believe," he said, "I have had the
honour of Mr. Webber's acquaintance."</p>

<p>George remembered him, although he had seen him only once or twice,
and that some years before. Mr. Stoat was not the kind of man one
easily forgets.</p>

<p>It was plain to see that McHarg was on edge, terribly nervous, and
also irritated by Stoat's presence. He turned away abruptly, muttering:
"Too--too--too--much--too much." And then, wheeling about suddenly:
"All right, George. Have a drink. What's it going to be?"</p>

<p>"My own experience," said Mr. Stoat with unctuous pomposity, "is
that the best drink in the morning"--he leered significantly with his
bushy eyebrows--"a gentleman's drink, if I may say so--is a glawss of
dry sherry." He had a "glawss" of this beverage in his hand at the
moment, and, lifting it with an air of delicate connoisseurship, at the
same time working his eyebrows appraisingly, he sniffed it--an action
which seemed to irritate McHarg no end. "Allow me," continued Mr.
Stoat, with rotund deliberation, "to recommend it to your
consideration."</p>

<p>McHarg began to pace rapidly up and down. "Too much--too much," he
muttered. "All right, George," he said irritably, "what'll you have to
drink--Scotch?"</p>

<p>Mynheer Bendien put in his oar at this point. Holding up his glass
and leaning forward with a hand on one fat knee, he said with guttural
solemnity: "You should trink chin. Vy don't you try a trink of Holland
chin?"</p>

<p>This advice also seemed to annoy Mr. McHarg. He glared at Bendien
with his flaming face, then, throwing up his bony hands with a quick,
spasmodic movement, he cried: "Oh, for God's sake!" He turned and began
to pace up and down again, muttering: "Too much--too
much--too--too--too much." Then abruptly, in a voice shrill with
irritation: "Let him drink what he wants, for Christ's sake! Go ahead,
Georgie," he said roughly. "Drink what you like. Pour yourself some
Scotch." And suddenly turning to Webber, his whole face lighting up
with an impish smile, his lips flickering nervously above his teeth:
"Isn't it wonderful, Georgie? Isn't it marvellous? K-k-k-k-k"--prodding
Webber in the ribs with bony forefinger, and laughing a high, dry,
feverish laugh--"Can you beat it?"</p>

<p>"I confess," said Mr. Donald Stoat at this point, with rotund
unction, "that I have not read our young friend's opus, which, I
believe"--unction here deepening visibly into rotund sarcasm--"which, I
believe, has been hailed by certain of our cognoscenti as a
masterpiece. After all, there are so many masterpieces nowadays, aren't
there? Scarcely a week goes by but what I pick up my copy of <i>The
Times</i>--I refer, of course, to <i>The Times</i> of London, as
distinguished from its younger and somewhat more immature colleague,
<i>The New York Times</i>--to find that another of our young men has
enriched English literature with another masterpiece of
im--perish--able prose."</p>

<p>All this was uttered in ponderous periods with leerings and
twitchings of those misplaced moustaches that served the gentleman for
eyebrows. McHarg was obviously becoming more and more annoyed, and kept
pacing up and down, muttering to himself. Mr. Stoat, however, was too
obtuse by nature, and too entranced by the rolling cadences of his own
rhetoric, to observe the warning signals. After leering significantly
with his eyebrows again, he went on:</p>

<p>"I can only hope, however, that our young friend here is a not too
enthusiastic devotee of the masters of what I shall call The School of
Bad Taste."</p>

<p>"What are you talking about?" said McHarg, pausing suddenly,
half-turning, and glaring fiercely. "I suppose you mean Hugh Walpole,
and John Galsworthy, and other dangerous radicals of that sort,
eh?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," said Mr. Stoat deliberately. "I was not thinking of them.
I was referring to that concocter of incoherent nonsense, that purveyor
of filth, the master of obscenity, who wrote that book so few people
can read, and no one can understand, but which some of our young men
are hailing enthusiastically as the greatest masterpiece of the
century."</p>

<p>"What book are you talking about anyway?" McHarg said irritably.
"Its name, I believe," said Mr. Stoat pompously, "is <i>Ulysses</i>.
Its author, I have heard, is an Irishman."</p>

<p>"Oh," cried McHarg with an air of enlightenment, and with an impish
gleam in his eye that was quite lost on Mr. Stoat. "You're speaking of
George Moore, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"That's it! That's it!" cried Mr. Stoat quickly, nodding his head
with satisfaction. He was getting excited now. His eyebrows twitched
more rapidly than ever. "That's the fellow! And the book"--he
sputtered--"pah!" He spat out the word as though it had been brought up
by an emetic, and screwed the eyebrows round across his domy forehead
in an expression of nausea. "I tried to read a few pages of it once,"
he whispered sonorously and dramatically, "but I let it fall. I let it
fall. As though I bad touched a tainted thing, I let it fall. And
then," he said hoarsely, "I washed my hands, with a
very--strong--soap."</p>

<p>"My dear sir," cried McHarg suddenly, with an air of sincere
conviction, at the same time being unable to keep his eye from gleaming
more impishly than ever, "you are absolutely right. I absolutely agree
with you."</p>

<p>Mr. Stoat, who had been very much on his dignity up to now, thawed
visibly under the seducing cajolery of this unexpected confrrmation of
his literary judgment.</p>

<p>"You are positively and unanswerably correct," said Knuckles, now
standing in the middle of the room with his long legs spread wide
apart, his bony hands hanging to the lapels of his coat. "You have hit
the nail right smack--dead--square on the top of its head." As he
uttered these words, he jerked his wry face from side to side to give
them added emphasis. "There has never been a dirtier--filthier--more
putrid--and more corrupt writer than George Moore. And as for that book
of his, <i>Ulysses</i>," McHarg shouted, "that is unquestionably the
vilest----"</p>

<p>"--the rottenest----" shouted Mr. Stoat----</p>

<p>"--the most obscene----" shrilled McHarg----</p>

<p>"--the most vicious----" panted Mr. Stoat----</p>

<p>"--unadulterated----"</p>

<p>"--piece of tripe----" choked Mr. Stoat with rapturous
agreement----</p>

<p>"--tha t has ever polluted the pages, defiled the name, and
besmirched the record----"</p>

<p>"--of English literature!" gasped Mr. Stoat happily, and paused,
panting for breath. "Yes," he went on when he had recovered his power
of speech, "and that other thing--that play of his--that rotten, vile,
vicious, so-called tragedy in five acts--what was the name of that
thing, anyway?"</p>

<p>"Oh," cried McHarg with an air of sudden recognition "you mean
<i>The Importance of Being Earnest</i>, don't you?"</p>

<p>"No, no," said Mr. Stoat impatiently. "Not that one. This one came
later on."</p>

<p>"Oh yes!" McHarg exclaimed, as if it had suddenly come to him.
"You're speaking of <i>Mrs. Warren's Profession</i>, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"That's it, that's it!" cried Mr. Stoat. "I took my wife to see
it--I took my <i>wife</i>--my <i>own</i> wife----"</p>

<p>"His <i>own</i> wife!" McHarg repeated, as if astounded, "Well I'll
be God-damned," he said. "What do you know about that!"</p>

<p>"And would you believe it, sir?" Mr. Stoat's voice again sank to a
whisper of loathing and revulsion, and his eyebrows worked ominously
about his face. "I was so ashamed--I was <i>so ashamed</i>--that I
could not look at her. We got up and left, sir, before the end of the
first act--before anyone could see us. I went away with head bowed, as
one who had been forced to take part in some nasty thing."</p>

<p>"Well what do you know about that?" said McHarg sympathetically.
"Wasn't that just too damned bad? I <i>call it perfectly damned
awful!</i>" he shouted suddenly, and turned away, his jaw muscles
working convulsively as he muttered again: "Too much--too much." He
halted abruptly in front of Webber with his puckered face aflame and
his lips twitching nervously, and began to prod him in the ribs,
laughing his high, falsetto laugh. "He's a publisher," he squeaked. "He
publishes books. K-k-k-k-k--Can you beat it, Georgie?" he squeaked
almost inaudibly. Then, jerking a bony thumb in the direction of the
astonished Stoat, he shrieked: "In the name of Christ Almighty--a
<i>publisher!</i>"--and resumed his infuriated pacing of the room.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="chapter5-34"></a>34. The Two Visitors</h2>

<p>Ever since George entered the room he had been wondering about the
presence of McHarg's two strangely assorted visitors. Anyone could see
at a glance that Bendien and Stoat were not clever men, not men of the
spirit, and that neither possessed any qualities of intellect or of
perception that could interest a person like Lloyd McHarg. What, then,
were they doing here in this simulation of boon companionship so early
in the morning?</p>

<p>Mynheer Bendien was obviously just a business man, a kind of Dutch
Babbitt. He was, indeed, a hard-bargaining, shrewd importer who plied a
constant traffrc between England and Holland, and was intimately
familiar with the markets and business practices of both countries. His
occupation had left its mark upon him, that same mark which is revealed
in a coarsening of perception and a blunting of sensitivity among
people of his kind the world over.</p>

<p>As George observed the signs that betrayed what Bendien was beyond
any mistaking, he felt confirmed in an opinion that had been growing on
him of late. He had begun to see that the true races of mankind are not
at all what we are told in youth that they are. They are not defined
either by national frontiers or by the characteristics assigned to them
by the subtle investigations of anthropologists. More and more George
was coming to believe that the real divisions of humanity cut across
these barriers and arise out of differences in the very souls of
men.</p>

<p>George had first had his attention called to this phenomenon by an
observation of H. L. Mencken. In his extraordinary work on the American
language, Mencken gave an example of the American sporting writers'
jargon--"Babe Smacks Forty-second with Bases Loaded"--and pointed out
that such a headline would be as completely meaningless to an Oxford
don as the dialect of some newly discovered tribe of Eskimos. True
enough; but what shocked George to attention when he read it was that
Mencken drew the wrong inference from his fact. The headline would be
meaningless to the Oxford don, not because it was written in the
American language, but because the Oxford don had no knowledge of
baseball. The same headline might be just as meaningless to a Harvard
professor, and for the same reason.</p>

<p>It seemed to George that the Oxford don and the Harvard professor
had far more kinship with each other--a far greater understanding of
each other's ways of thinking, feeling, and living--than either would
have with millions of people of his own nationality. This observation
led George to realise that academic life has created its own race of
men who are set apart from the rest of humanity by the affinity of
their souls. This academic race, it seemed to him, had innumerable
peculiar characteristics of its own, among them the fact that, like the
sporting gentry, they had invented their own private languages for
communication with one another. The internationalism of science was
another characteristic: there is no such thing as English chemistry or
American physics or (Stalin to the contrary notwithstanding) Russian
biology, but only chemistry, physics and biology. So, too, it follows
that one tells a good deal more about a man when one says he is a
chemist than when one says he is an Englishman.</p>

<p>In the same way, Babe Ruth would probably feel more closely akin to
the English professional cricketer, Jack Hobbs, than to a professor of
Greek at Princeton. This would be true also among prize-fighters.
George thought of that whole world that is so complete within
itself--the fighters, the trainers, the managers, the promoters, the
touts, the pimps, the gamblers, the grafters, the hangers-on, the
newspaper "experts" in New York, London, Paris, Berlin, Rome, and
Buenos Aires. These men were not really Americans, Englishmen,
Frenchmen, Germans, Italians, and Argentines. They were simply citizens
of the world of prize-fighting, more at home with one another than with
other men of their respective nations.</p>

<p>Throughout all the years of his life, George Webber had been soaking
up experience like a sponge. This process never ceased with him, but
within the last few years he had noticed a change in it. Formerly, in
his insatiable hunger to know everything--to see all the faces in a
crowd at once, to remember every face that passed him on a city street,
to hear all the voices in a room and through the vast, perplexing blur
to distinguish what each was saying--he had often felt that he was
drowning in some vast sea of his own sensations and impressions. But
now he was no longer so overwhelmed by Amount and Number. He was
growing up, and out of the very accumulation of experience he was
gaining an essential perspective and detachment. Each new sensation and
impression was no longer a single, unrelated thing: it took its place
in a pattern and sifted down to form certain observable cycles of
experience. Thus his incessantly active mind was free to a much greater
degree than ever before to remember, digest, meditate, and compare, and
to seek relations between all the phenomena of living. The result was
an astonishing series of discoveries as his mind noted associations and
resemblances, and made recognitions not only of surface similarities
but of identities of concept and of essence.</p>

<p>In this way he had become aware of the world of waiters, who, more
than any other class of men, seemed to him to have created a special
universe of their own which had almost obliterated nationality and race
in the ordinary sense of those words. For some reason George had always
been especially interested in waiters. Possibly it was because his own
beginnings had been small-town middle class, and because he had been
accustomed from birth to the friendship of working people, and because
the experience of being served at table by a man in uniform had been
one of such sensational novelty that its freshness had never worn off.
Whatever the reason, he had known hundreds of waiters in many different
countries, had talked to them for hours at a time, had observed them
intimately, and had gathered tremendous stores of knowledge about their
lives--and out of all this had discovered that there are not really
different nationalities of waiters but rather a separate race of
waiters, whole and complete within itself. This seemed to be true even
among the French, the most sharply defined, the most provincial, and
the most unadaptive nationality George had ever known. It surprised him
to observe that even in France the waiters seemed to belong to the race
of waiters rather than to the race of Frenchmen.</p>

<p>This universe of waiterdom has produced a type whose character is as
precisely distinguished as that of the Mongolian. It has a spiritual
identity that unites it as no mere feelings of patriotism could ever
do. And this spiritual identity--a unity of thought, of purpose, and of
conduct--has produced unmistakable physical characteristics. After
George became aware of this, he got so that he could recognise a waiter
no matter where he saw him, whether in the New York subway or on a
Paris bus or in the streets of London. He tested his observation many
times by accosting men he suspected of being waiters and engaging them
in conversation, and nine times out of ten he found that his guess had
been right. Something in the feet and legs gave them away, something in
the way they moved and walked and stood. It was not merely that these
men had spent most of their lives standing on their feet and hurrying
from kitchen to table in the execution of their orders. Other classes
of men, such as policemen, also lived upon their feet, and yet no one
could mistake a policeman in mufti for a waiter. (The police of all
countries, George discovered, formed another separate race.)</p>

<p>The gait of an old waiter can best be described as gingery. It is a
kind of gouty shuffle, painful, rheumatic, and yet expertly nimble,
too, as if the man has learned by every process of experience to save
his feet. It is the nimbleness that comes from years of "Yes, sir.
Right away, sir," or of "Oui, monsieur. Je viens. Toute de suite." It
is the gait of service, of despatch, of incessant haste to be about
one's orders, and somehow the whole soul and mind and character of the
waiter is in it.</p>

<p>If one wishes an instant insight into the emotional and spiritual
differences between the race of waiters and the race of policemen, all
one needs to do is to observe the gaits of each. Compare a waiter as he
approaches a table at the peremptory command of an impatient customer,
and a policeman, whether in New York, London, Paris, or Berlin, as he
approaches the scene of a disorder or accident. A man is lying
stretched out on the pavement, let us say: he has had a heart attack,
or has been struck by a motor-car, or has been assaulted and beaten by
thugs. People are standing round in a circle. Watch the policeman as he
comes up. Does he hurry? Does he rush to the scene? Does he come
forward with the quick, shuffling, eager, and solicitous movement of
the waiter? He does not. He advances deliberately, ponderously, with a
heavy and flat-footed tread, taking the scene in slowly as he
approaches, with an appraising and unrelenting look. He is coming not
to take orders but to give them. He is coming to assume command of the
situation, to investigate, to disperse the crowd, to do the talking,
and not to be talked to. His whole bearing expresses a certain
primitive brutality of vested authority, as well as all the other
related mental and spiritual qualities that proceed from the exercise
of licensed power. And in all these things which issue from his own
peculiar vision of life and of the world, he is almost the exact
reverse of the waiter.</p>

<p>Since this is true, can anyone doubt that waiters and policemen
belong to separate races? Does it not follow that a French waiter is
more closely akin to a German waiter than to a French gendarme?</p>

<p>Mynheer Bendien had attracted George's interest from the first. It
was not merely that he was Dutch. That fact was unmistakable. He had a
Halsian floridity, a Halsian heartiness and gusto, a Halsian
heaviness--a kind of Dutch grossness that is quite different from
German grossness in that it is mixed with a certain delicacy, or rather
smallness. This delicacy or smallness is most often evident in the
expression and shape of the mouth. So, now, with Mynheer Bendien. His
lip was full and pouting, but also a little prim and smug. It was the
characteristic Dutch lip--the lip of a small and cautious people, with
a very good notion about which side their bread is buttered on. In any
town throughout Holland one can see them behind the shuttered windows
of their beautiful and delicate houses--see them quietly and privily
enjoying the very best of everything and smacking those full, pouting,
sensual little lips together.</p>

<p>Holland is a wonderful little country, and the Dutch are a wonderful
little people. Just the same it is a little country, they <i>are</i> a
little people, and George did not like little countries or little
people. For in the look of those little, fat, wet, pouting mouths there
is also something cautious and self-satisfied, something that kept
nicely out of war in 1914 while its neighbours were bleeding to death,
something that feathered its nest and fattened its purse at the expense
of dying men, something that maintained itself beautifully clean,
beautifully prim, and beautifully content to live very quietly and
simply in those charming, beautiful houses, without any show or fuss
whatever upon the best of everything.</p>

<p>In all these respects Mynheer Bendien was indubitably Dutch. But he
was also something else as well, and this was what made George observe
him with fascinated interest. For, alongside his Dutchness, he also
wore that type look which George had come to recognise as belonging to
the race of small business men. It was a look which he had discovered
to be common to all members of this race whether they lived in Holland,
England, Germany, France, the United States, Sweden, or Japan. There
was a hardness and grasping quality in it that showed in the
prognathous jaw. There was something a little sly and tricky about the
eyes, something a little amoral in the sleekness of the flesh,
something about the slightly dry concavity of the face and its vacuous
expression in repose which indicated a grasping self-interest and a
limited intellectual life. It was the kind of face that is often
thought of as American. But it was not American. It belonged to no
nationality. It belonged simply and solely to the race of small
business men everywhere.</p>

<p>He was obviously the kind of man who would have found an instant and
congenial place for himself among his fellow business men in Chicago,
Detroit, Cleveland, St. Louis, or Kalamazoo. He would have felt
completely at home at one of the weekly luncheons of the Rotary Club.
He would have chewed his cigar with the best of them, wagged his head
approvingly as the president spoke of some member as having "both feet
on the ground", entered gleefully into all the horseplay, the
heavy-handed kind of humour known as "kidding", and joined in the roars
of laughter that greeted such master-strokes of wit as collecting all
the straw hats in the cloak-room, bringing them in, throwing them on
the floor, and gleefully stamping them to pieces. He would also have
nodded his red face in bland agreement as the speaker aired again all
the quackery about "service", "the aims of Rotary", and its "plans for
world peace".</p>

<p>George could easily imagine Mynheer Bendien pounding across the
continental breadth of the United States in one of the crack trains,
striking up a conversation with other men of substance in the smoking
room of the pullman car, pulling fat cigars from his pocket and
offering them to his new-found companions, chewing on his own
approvingly and nodding with ponderous affirmation as someone said: "I
was talking to a man in Cleveland the other day, one of the biggest
glue and mucilage producers in the country, a fellow who has learned
his business from the ground up and <i>knows</i> what he's talking
about----" Yes, Mynheer Bendien would have recognised his brother, his
kinsman, his twin spirit wherever he found him,, and would instantly
have established a connection and a footing of proper familiarity with
him, as McHarg and Webber could never have done, even though the
stranger might be an American like themselves.</p>

<p>George knew McHarg's antipathy for this kind of man. It was an
antipathy which he had savagely expressed in swingeing and satiric
fiction--an antipathy which, George had felt, had a quality of almost
affectionate concern in its hatred, but which was hatred nonetheless.
Why, then, had McHarg invited this man to his room? Why had he sought
out his companionship?</p>

<p>The reason became plain enough as he thought about it. Although
McHarg and Webber could never belong to Bendien's world, there was
something of Bendien in both of them--more in McHarg, perhaps, than in
himself. Though they belonged to separate worlds, there was still
another world to which each of them could find a common entry. This was
the world of natural humanity, the world of the earthly, eating,
drinking, companionable, and company-loving man. Every artist feels the
need of this world desperately. His nature is often torn between
opposing poles of loneliness and gregariousness. Isolation he must have
to do his work. But fellowship is also a necessity without which he is
lost, since the lack of it removes him from all the naturalness of life
which he demands more than any other man alive, and which he must share
in if he is to grow and prosper in his art. But his need for
companionship often betrays him through its very urgency. His hunger
and thirst for life often lay him open to the stupidity of fools and
the trickery and dishonesty of Philistines and rascals.</p>

<p>George could see what had happened to McHarg. He himself had gone
through the same experience many times. McHarg, it is true, was a great
man, a man famous throughout the world, a man who had now attained the
highest pinnacle of success to which a writer could aspire. But on just
this account his disillusionment and disappointment must have been so
much the greater and the more crushing.</p>

<p>And what disillusionment, what disappointment, was this? It was a
disappointment that all men know--the artist most of all--The
disappointment of reaching for the flower and having it fade the moment
your fingers touch it. It was the disappointment that comes from the
artist's invincible and unlearning youth, from the spirit of
indomitable hope and unwavering adventure, the spirit that is defeated
and cast down ten thousand times but that is lost beyond redemption
never, the spirit that, so far from learning wisdom from despair,
acceptance from defeat, cynicism from disillusionment, seems to grow
stronger at every rebuff, more passionate in its convictions the older
it grows, more assured of its ultimate triumphant fulfilment the more
successive and conclusive its defeats.</p>

<p>McHarg had accepted his success and his triumph with the exultant
elation of a boy. He had received the award of his honorary degree,
symbolising the consummation of his glory, with blazing images of
impossible desire. And then, almost before he knew it, it was over. The
thing was his, it had been given to him, he had it, he had stood before
the great ones of the earth, he had been acclaimed and lauded,
<i>all</i> had happened--and yet, nothing had happened.</p>

<p>Then, of course, he took the inevitable next step. With a mind
surcharged with frre, with a heart thirsting for some impossible
fulfilment, he took his award, and copies of all the speeches,
programmes, and tributes, sailed for Europe, and began to go from place
to place; looking for something that he had no name for, something that
existed somewhere, perhaps--but where he did not know. He went to
Copenhagen--wine, women, aquavit, and members of the Press, then women,
wine, members of the Press, and aquavit again. He went to
Berlin--members of the Press, wine, women, whisky, women, wine, and
members of the Press. So then to Vienna--women, wine, whisky, members
of the Press. Finally to Baden-Baden for a "cure"--cure, call it, if
you will, for wine, women, and members of the Press--cure, really, for
life-hunger, for life-thirst, for life-triumph, for life-defeat,
life-disillusionment, life-loneliness, and lifeboredom--cure for
devotion to men and for disgust of them, cure for love of life and for
weariness of it--last of all, cure for the cureless, cure for the worm,
for the flame, for the feeding mouth, for the thing that eats and rests
not ever till we die. Is there not some medicine for the irremediable?
Give us a cure, for God's sake, for what ails us! Take it! Keep it!
Give it back again! Oh, let us have it! Take it from us, damn you, but
for God's sake bring it back! And so good night.</p>

<p>Therefore this wounded lion, this raging cat of life, forever
prowling past a million portals of desire and destiny, had flung
himself against the walls of Europe, seeking, hunting, thirsting,
starving, and lashing himself into a state of frenzied bafflement, and
at last had met--a red-faced Dutchman from the town of Amsterdam, and
had knocked about with the red-faced Dutchman for three days on end,
and now hates red-faced Dutchman's guts and would to God that he could
pitch him out of the window, bag and baggage, and wonders how in God's
name the whole thing began, and how he can ever win free from it and be
alone again--and so now is here, pacing the carpet of his hotel room in
London.</p>

<p>The presence of Mr. Donald Stoat was more puzzling. Mynheer Bendien
at least had a certain earthy congeniality to recommend him to McHarg's
interest. Mr. Stoat had nothing. Everything about the man was
calculated to rub McHarg the wrong way. He was pompous and pretentious,
his judgments, such as they were, were governed by a kind of moral
bigotry that was infuriating, and, to cap it all, he was a complete and
total fool.</p>

<p>He had inherited from his father a publishing business with a good
name and a record of respected accomplishment. Under his leadership it
had degenerated into a business largely devoted to the fabrication of
religious tracts and text-books for the elementary grades. Its fiction
list was pitiful. Mr. Stoat's literary and critical standards were
derived from a pious devotion to the welfare of the jeune fille. "Is it
a book," he would whisper hoarsely to any aspiring new author, at the
same time rolling his eyebrows about--"is it a book that you would be
willing for your young daughter to read?" Mr. Stoat had no young
daughter, but in his publishing enterprises he always acted on the
hypothesis that he did have, and that no book should be printed which
he would be unwilling to place in her hands. The result, as may be
imagined, was fudge and taffy, slop and goo.</p>

<p>George had met Mr. Stoat quite casually some years before he had
later been invited to his house. He was married to a large,
full-bosomed female with a grim jaw who wore a perpetually frozen grin
round the edges of her mouth and eyeglasses which were attached to a
cord of black silk. This formidable lady was devoted to art and had not
let her marriage to Mr. Stoat interfere with that devotion. Indeed she
had not let marriage interfere even with her name, but had clung to her
resounding maidenly title of Cornelia Fosdick Sprague. She and Mr.
Stoat maintained a salon, to which a great many people who shared
Cornelia Fosdick Sprague's devotion to art repaired at regular
intervals, and it was to one of these meetings of the elect that George
had been invited. He still remembered it vividly. Mr. Stoat had
telephoned him a few days after their first casual meeting and had
pressed the invitation upon him.</p>

<p>"You must come, my boy," Mr. Stoat had wheezed over the wire. "You
can't afford to miss this, you know. Henrietta Saltonstall Spriggins is
going to be there. You must meet her. And Penelope Buchanan Pipgrass is
going to give a reading from her poems. And Hortense Delancey McCracken
is going to read her latest play. You simply must come, by all
means."</p>

<p>So urged, George accepted and went, and it was quite an occasion.
Mr. Stoat met him at the door and with a pontifical flourish of the
eyebrows led him into the presence of Cornelia Fosdick Sprague. After
he had made his obeisances Mr. Stoat piloted the young man about the
room and with repeated flourishes of the eyebrows introduced him to the
other guests. There was an astonishing number of formidable-looking
females, and, like the imposing Cornelia, most of them had three names.
As Mr. Stoat made the introductions he fairly smacked his lips over the
triple-barrelled sonority of their titles.</p>

<p>George noticed with amazement that all of these women bore a marked
resemblance to Cornelia Fosdick Sprague. Not that they really looked
like her in feature. Some were tall, some were short, some were
angular, some were fat, but all of them had a certain overwhelming
quality in their bearing. This quality became a crushing air of
absolute assurance and authority when they spoke of art. And they spoke
of art a great deal. Indeed, it was the purpose of these meetings to
speak of art. Almost all of these ladies were not only interested in
art, but were "artists" themselves. That is to say, they were writers.
They wrote one-act plays for the Little Theatre, or they wrote novels,
or essays and criticism, or poems and books for children.</p>

<p>Henrietta Saltonstall Spriggins read one of her wee stories for tiny
tots about a little girl waiting for Prince Charming. Penelope Buchanan
Pipgrass read some of her poems, one about a quaint organ-grinder, and
another about a whimsical old rag man. Hortense Delancey McCracken read
her play, a sylvan fantasy laid in Central Park, with two lovers
sitting on a bench in the springtime and Pan prancing round in the
background, playing mad music on his pipes and leering slyly out at the
lovers from behind trees. In all of these productions there was not a
line that could bring the blush of outraged modesty to the cheek of the
most innocent young girl. Indeed, the whole thing was just too damned
delightful for words.</p>

<p>After the readings they all sat round and drank pale tea and
discussed what they had read in fluty voices. George remembered vaguely
that there were two or three other men present, but they were pallid
figures who faded into the mist, hovering in the background like wan
ghosts, submissive and obscure attendants, husbands even, to the
possessors of those sonorous and triple-barrelled names.</p>

<p>George never went back again to Cornelia Fosdick Sprague's salon,
and had seen nothing more of Mr. Donald Stoat. Yet here he was, the
last person in the world he would have expected to find in Lloyd
McHarg's apartment. If Mr. Stoat had ever read any of McHarg's books--a
most improbable circumstance--his moral conscience must have been
outraged by the mockery with which, in almost every one of them, McHarg
had assaulted the cherished ideals and sacred beliefs that Mr. Stoat
held dear. Yet here he was sipping his dry sherry in McHarg's room with
all the aplomb of one who was accustomed to such familiar intimacy.</p>

<p>What was he doing here? What on earth did it mean?</p>

<p>George did not have to wait long for an answer. The telephone rang.
McHarg snapped his fingers sharply and sprang for the instrument with
an exclamation of overwrought relief.</p>

<p>"Hello, hello!" He waited a moment, his inflamed and puckered face
twisted wryly to one side. "Hello, hello, hello!" he said feverishly
and rattled the receiver hook. "Yes, yes. Who? Where?" A brief pause.
"Oh, it's New York," he cried, and then impatiently: "All right, then!
Put them through!"</p>

<p>George had never before seen the transatlantic telephone in
operation, and he watched with feelings of wonder and disbelief. A
vision of the illimitable seas passed through his mind. He remembered
storms that he had been in and the way great ships were tossed about;
he thought of the enormous curve of the earth's surface and of the
difference in time; and yet in a moment McHarg, his voice calm now,
began to speak quietly as if he were talking to someone in the next
room:</p>

<p>"Oh, hello Wilson," he said. "Yes, I can hear you perfectly. Of
course...Yes, yes, it's true. Of course it is!" he cried, with a return
to his former manner of feverish annoyance. "No, I've broken with him
completely...No, I don't know where I'm going. I haven't signed up with
anyone yet...All right, all right," impatiently. "Wait a minute," he
said curtly. "Let me do the talking. I won't do anything until I see
you...No that's not a promise to go with you," he said angrily. "It's
just a promise that I won't go anywhere else till I see you." A
moment's pause while McHarg listened intently. "You're sailing
when?...Oh, to-night! The <i>Berengaria</i>. Good. I'll see you here
then next week...All right. Good-bye, Wilson," he snapped, and hung
up.</p>

<p>Turning away from the phone, he was silent a moment, looking a
little rueful in his wry, puckered way. Then, with a shrug of his
shoulders and a little sigh, he said:</p>

<p>"Well, cat's out of the bag, I guess. The news has got round. They
all know I've left Bradford-Howell. I suppose they'll all be on my tail
now. That was Wilson Fothergill," he said, mentioning the name of one
of America's largest publishers. "He's sailing to-night." Suddenly his
face was twisted with demonic glee. He laughed a high, dry cackle.
"Christ, Georgie!" he squeaked, prodding Webber in the ribs. "Isn't it
wonderful? Isn't it marvellous? Can you beat it?"</p>

<p>Mr. Donald Stoat cleared his throat with premonitory emphasis and
arched his eyebrows significantly. "I hope," he said, "that before you
come to any terms with Fothergill, you will talk to me and listen to
what I have to say." There was a weighty pause, then he concluded
pontifically: "Stoat--the House of Stoat--would like to have you on its
list."</p>

<p>"What's that? What's that?" said McHarg feverishly. "Stoat!" he
cried suddenly. "Stoat?" He winced nervously in a kind of convulsion of
jangled nerves, then paused, trembling and undecided, as if he did not
know whether to spring upon Mr. Stoat or to spring out the window.
Snapping his bony fingers sharply, he turned to Webber and shrieked
again in a shrill, falsetto cackle: "Did you hear it, Georgie? Isn't it
wonderful? K-k-k-k-k--Stoat!" he squeaked, prodding Webber in the ribs
again. "The House of Stoat! Can you beat it? Isn't it marvellous? Isn't
it--All right, all right," he said, breaking off abruptly and turning
upon the astounded Mr. Stoat. "All right, Mr. Stoat, we'll talk about
it. But some other time. Come in to see me next week," he said
feverishly.</p>

<p>With that he grasped Mr. Stoat by the hand, shook it in farewell,
and with his other arm practically lifted that surprised gentleman from
his chair and escorted him across the room. "Good-bye, goodbye! Come in
next week...Good-bye, Bendien!" he now said to the Dutchman, seizing
him by the hand, lifting him from the chair, and repeating the process.
He herded the two before him with his bony arms outstretched as if he
were shooing chickens, and finally got them out of the door, talking
rapidly all the time, saying: "Goodbye, good-bye. Thanks for coming in.
Come back to see me again. Georgie and I have to go to lunch now."</p>

<p>At last he closed the door on them, turned, and came back in the
room. He was obviously unstrung.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="chapter5-35"></a>35. A Guest in Spite of Himself</h2>

<p>When Bendien and Stoat were so suddenly and unceremoniously ushered
from the room, George rose from his chair in some excitement, not
knowing what to do with himself. McHarg now looked at him wearily.</p>

<p>"Sit down, sit down!" McHarg gasped, and fell into a chair. He
crossed his bony legs with a curiously pathetic and broken attitude.
"Christ!" he said, letting out a long sigh, "I'm tired. I feel as if
I've been run through a sausage grinder. That damned Dutchman! I went
out with him in Amsterdam, and we've been going it ever since. God, I
can't remember having eaten since I left Cologne. That was four days
ago."</p>

<p>He looked it, too. George was sure that he had spoken the literal
truth and that he had not paused to eat for days. He was a wreck of
jangled nerves and utterly exhausted weariness. As he sat there with
his bony shanks crossed like two pieces of limp string, his gaunt
figure had the appearance of being broken in two at the waist. He
looked as if he would never be able to get out of that chair again
without assistance. Just at that moment, however, the telephone rang
sharply, and McHarg leaped up as if he had received an electric
shock.</p>

<p>"Jesus Christ!" he shrilled. "What's that?" He darted for the phone,
snatched it up savagely, and snapped: "Hello, who's there?" Then
feverishly but very cordially: "Oh, hello; hello, Rick--you bastard,
you! Where the hell have you been, anyway? I've been trying to reach
you all morning...No! No! I just got here last night...Of course I'm
going to see you. That's one of the reasons I'm here...No, no, you
don't need to come for me. I've got my own car here. We'll drive down.
I'm bringing someone with me...<i>Who?</i>" he cackled suddenly in his
shrill falsetto. "You'll see, you'll see. Wait till we get there...For
dinner? Sure, I'll make it. How long does it take?...Two hours and a
half? Seven o'clock. We'll be there with time to spare. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. What's the address? Wait till I get it down."</p>

<p>He seated himself abruptly at the writing-desk, fumbled for a moment
with pen and paper, and then passed them impatiently towards George,
saying: "Write it down, George, as I give it to you." The address was
in Surrey, a farm on a country road several miles away from a small
town. The directions for finding it were quite complicated, involving
detours and cross-roads, but George finally got it all down correctly.
Then McHarg, feverishly assuring his host that they would be there for
dinner, with time to spare, hung up.</p>

<p>"Well, now," he said impatiently, springing to his feet with another
exhibition of that astounding vitality which seemed to burn in him all
the time, "come on, Georgie! Let's snap out of it! We'll have to get
going!"</p>

<p>"<i>W-w-w-we?</i>" George stammered. "Y-y-y-you mean me, Mr.
McHarg?"</p>

<p>"Sure, sure!" McHarg said impatiently. "Rick's expecting us to
dinner. We can't keep him waiting. Come on! Come on! Let's get started!
We're getting out of London! We're going places!"</p>

<p>"P-p-p-places?" George stammered again, dumbfounded. "But
w-w-w-where are we going, Mr. McHarg?"</p>

<p>"West of England," he barked out instantly. "We'll go down to Rick's
and spend the night. But to-morrow--to-morrow," he muttered, pacing up
and down and speaking with ominous decision, "we'll be on our way. West
of England," he muttered again, pacing and hanging to his coat lapels
with bony fingers. "Cathedral towns," he said. "Bath, Bristol, Wells,
Exeter, Salisbury, Devonshire, coast of Cornwall," he cried feverishly,
getting his geography and his cathedrals hopelessly confused, but
covering, nevertheless, a large portion of the kingdom in a single
staccato sentence. "Keep out of cities," he went on. "Stay away from
swank hotels--joints like this one. Hate them. Hate all of them. Want
the country--the English countryside," he said with relish.</p>

<p>George's heart sank. He had not bargained for anything like this. He
had come to England to finish his new book. The work had been going
well. He had established the beat and cadence of daily hours at his
writing, and the prospect of breaking the rhythm of it just when he was
going at full swing was something that he dreaded. Moreover, God only
knew where such a jaunt as McHarg spoke of would end. McHarg,
meanwhile, was still talking, pacing nervously back and forth and
letting his enthusiasm mount as his mind built up the idyllic picture
of what he had suddenly taken it into his head to do.</p>

<p>"Yes, the English countryside--that's the thing," he said with
relish. "We'll put up at night by the side of the road and cook our own
meals, or stay at some old inn--some real English country inn," he said
with deliberate emphasis. "Tankards of musty ale," he muttered. "A
well-done chop by the fireside. A bottle of old port, eh Georgie?" he
cried, his scorched face lighting up with great glee. "Did it all
before one time. Toured the whole country several years ago with my
wife. Used a trailer. Went from place to place. Slept in our trailer at
night and did our own cooking. Wonderful! Marvellous!" he barked. "The
real way to see the country. The only way."</p>

<p>George said nothing. At the moment he was unable to say anything.
For weeks he had looked forward to his meeting with McHarg. He had
leaped to his bidding when McHarg had summoned him to get out of bed
instantly and come to lunch. But he had never dreamed of being abducted
as a travelling and talking companion on an expedition that might last
for days and even weeks, and end up almost anywhere. He had no desire
or intention of going with McHarg if he could avoid it. And yet--his
mind groped frantically for a way out--what was he to do? He did not
want to offend him. He had too great an admiration and respect for
McHarg to do anything that might, wittingly or unwittingly, hurt him or
wound his feelings. And how could he reject the invitation of a man
who, with the most generous and unselfish enthusiasm, had used the
power and elevation of his high place to try to lift him out of the
lower channel in which his own life ran?</p>

<p>In spite of the brevity of their acquaintance, George had already
seen dearly and unmistakably what a good and noble human being McHarg
really was. He knew how much integrity and courage and honesty was
contained in that tormented tenement of fury and lacerated hurts.
Regardless of all that was jangled, snarled, and twisted in his life,
regardless of all that had become bitter, harsh, and acrid, McHarg was
obviously one of the truly good, the truly high, the truly great people
of the world. Anyone with an atom of feeling and intelligence, George
thought, must have seen this at once. And as he continued to watch and
study McHarg, and took in again the shock of his appearance--the
inflamed face, the poached blue eyes, the emaciated figure and
nervously shaking hands--an image flashed into his mind which seemed to
represent the essential quality of the man, and this, curiously, was
the image of Abraham Lincoln. Save for McHarg's tallness and gauntness,
there was no physical similarity to Lincoln. The resemblance came,
George thought, from a certain homely identity, from a kind of
astonishing ugliness which was so marked that it was hard to see how it
escaped the grotesque, and yet it was not grotesque. It was an ugliness
which somehow, no matter what extravagances of gesture, tone, and
manner McHarg indulged in, never lost its quality of enormous, latent
dignity. This strange and troubling resemblance became strikingly
evident in repose.</p>

<p>For now, his decision having been arrived at with explosive
violence, McHarg sat quietly in a chair, his bony legs crossed lankly,
and with the fingers of one freckled and large-knuckled hand fumbled in
the breast pocket of his coat for his cheque-book and his wallet. He
got them out at last, his hands still shaking as with palsy, but even
that did not disturb the suggestion of quiet dignity and strength. He
put wallet and cheque-book on his knees, fumbled in a pocket of his
vest, took out an old, worn spectacle-case, snapped it open, and
deliberately extracted a pair of spectacles. They were the most
extraordinary spectacles George had ever seen. They looked as if they
might have belonged to Washington, or to Franklin, or to Lincoln
himself. The rims, the nose clasp, and the handles were of plain old
silver. McHarg opened them carefully, and then, using both hands,
slowly adjusted them and settled the handles over his large and
freckled ears. This done, he bent his head, took up the wallet, opened
it, and very carefully began to count the contents. The transforming
effect of this simple act was astonishing. The irritable, rasping,
overwrought man of a few minutes before was gone completely. This lank
and ugly figure in the chair, with its silver-rimmed spectacles, its
wry and puckered face lowered in calculation, its big bony hands
deliberately fingering each note inside the wallet, was an image of
Yankee shrewdness, homely strength, plain dignity, and assured power.
His very tone had changed. Still counting his money, without lifting
his head, he spoke to George, saying quietly:</p>

<p>"Ring that bell over there, George. We'll have to get some more
money. I'll send John out to the bank."</p>

<p>George rang, and shortly the young man with buttons rapped at the
door and entered. McHarg glanced up and, opening his chequebook and,
taking out his fountain pen, said quietly:</p>

<p>"I need some money, John. Will you take this cheque round to the
bank and cash it?"</p>

<p>"Very good, sir," said John. "And 'Enry is 'ere, sir, with the car.
'E wants to know if 'e should wait."</p>

<p>"Yes," said McHarg, still writing out the cheque. "Tell him I'll
need him. Tell him we'll be ready in twenty minutes." He tore out the
cheque and handed it to the man. "And by the way," he said, "when you
come back will you pack some things--shirts, underwear, socks, and so
on--in a small bag? We're going out of town."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir," John said quietly, and went out.</p>

<p>McHarg was silent and thoughtful for a moment. Then he capped his
fountain pen, restored it to his pocket, put away his wallet and
cheque-book, took off his old spectacles with the same grave and
patient movement, folded them and laid them in the case, snapped it to
and put it in the pocket of his vest, and then, with a much quieter and
more genial friendliness than he had yet displayed, brought one hand
down smartly on the arm of his chair and said:</p>

<p>"Well, George, what are you doing now? Working on another book?"</p>

<p>Webber told him that he was.</p>

<p>"Going to be good?" he demanded.</p>

<p>Webber said he hoped so.</p>

<p>"A nice, big, fat one like the first? Lots of meat on it, is there?
Lots of people?"</p>

<p>Webber told him that there would be.</p>

<p>"That's the stuff," he said. "Go to it and give 'em people," he said
quietly. "You've got the feeling for 'ern. You know how to make 'em
live. Go on and put 'em in. You'll hear a lot of bunk," he went on.
"You've probably heard it already. There'll be a lot of bright young
men who will tell you how to write, and tell you that what you do is
wrong. They'll tell you that you have no style, no sense of form.
They'll tell you that you don't write like Virginia Woolf, or like
Proust, or like Gertrude Stein, or like someone else that you ought to
write like. Take it all in, as much of it as you can. Believe all of it
that you're able to believe. Try to get all the help from it you can,
but if you know it's not true, don't pay too much attention to it."</p>

<p>"Will you be able to know whether it's true or not?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," he said quietly. "You always know if it's true. Christ,
man, you're a writer, you're not a bright young man. If you were a
bright young man you wouldn't know whether it was true or not. You'd
only say you did. But a writer always knows. The bright young men don't
think he does. That's the reason they're bright young men. They think a
writer is too dumb or too pig-headed to listen to what they say, but
the real truth of the matter is that the writer knows much more about
it than they can ever know. Once in a while they say something that
hits the nail on the head. But that's only one time in a thousand. When
they do, it hurts, but it's worth listening to. It's probably something
that you knew about yourself, that you knew you'd have to look at
finally, but that you've been trying to dodge and that you hoped no one
else would discover. When they punch one of those raw nerves, listen to
them, even though its hurts like hell. But usually you'll find that
you've known everything they say a long time before they say it, and
that what they think is important doesn't amount to a damn."</p>

<p>"Then what's a man to do?" Webber said. "It looks pretty much as if
he's got to be his own doctor, doesn't it? It looks as if he's got to
find the answer for himself."</p>

<p>"I never found any other way," said McHarg. "I don't think you will,
either. So get going. Keep busy. For Christ's sake, don't freeze up.
Don't stall around. I've known a lot of young fellows who froze up
after their first book, and it wasn't because they had only that one
book in them, either. That's what the bright young men thought. That's
what they always think, but it just ain't true. Good God, man, you've
got a hundred books in you! You can keep on turning them out as long as
you live. There's no danger of your drying up. The only danger is of
freezing up."</p>

<p>"How do you mean? Why should a man freeze up?"</p>

<p>"Usually," said McHarg, "because he loses his nerve. He listens to
the bright young men. His first book gets him pretty good reviews. He
takes them seriously. He begins to worry about every little bit of
criticism that's sandwiched in with the praise. He begins to wonder if
he can do it again. His next book is really going to be 'as good as his
first, maybe better. He has been a natural slugger to begin with, with
a one-ton punch. Now he begins to shadow-box. He listens to everything
they tell him. How to jab and how to hook. How to counter with his
right. How to keep out of the way. How to weave and how to bob. How to
take care of his feet. He learns to skip the rope, but forgets to use
that paralysing punch that he was born with, and the first thing you
know some palooka comes along and knocks him for a row of ash-cans. For
God's sake, don't let it happen to you. Learn all you can. Improve all
you can. Take all the instruction you can absorb. But remember that no
amount of instruction can ever take the place of the wallop in the old
right hand. If you lose that, you may learn all the proper ways that
other men have used to do the job, but you'll have forgotten your own
way. As a writer, you'll be through. So for God's sake, get going and
keep going. Don't let them slow you down. Make your mistakes, take your
chances, look silly, but keep on going. Don't freeze up."</p>

<p>"You think that can happen? Do you think a man can freeze up if he
really has talent?"</p>

<p>"Yes," McHarg said quietly, "that can happen. I've seen it happen.
You'll find out, as you go on, that most of the things they say, most
of the dangers that they warn you of, do not exist. They'll talk to
you, for instance, about prostituting your talent. They'll warn you not
to write for money. Not to sell your soul to Hollywood. Not to do a
dozen other things that have nothing whatever to do with you or with
your life. You won't prostitute yourself. A man's talent doesn't get
prostituted just because someone waves a fat cheque in his face. If
your talent is prostituted, it is because you are a prostitute by
nature. The number of writers in this world who weep into their Scotch
and tell you of the great books they would have written if they hadn't
sold out to Hollywood or to the <i>Saturday Evening Post</i> is
astonishingly large. But the number of great writers who have sold out
is not large. In fact, I don't believe there are any at all. If Thomas
Hardy had been given a contract to write stories for the <i>Saturday
Evening Post</i>, do you think he would have written like Zane Grey or
like Thomas Hardy? I can tell you the answer to that one. He would have
written like Thomas Hardy. He couldn't have written like anyone else
but Thomas Hardy. He would have kept on writing like Thomas Hardy
whether he wrote for the <i>Saturday Evening Post</i> or <i>Captain
Billy's Whizbang</i>. You can't prostitute a great writer, because a
great writer will inevitably be himself. He couldn't sell himself out
if he wanted to. And a good many of them, I suppose, <i>have</i> wanted
to, or thought they did. But he can freeze up. He can listen too much
to the bright young men. He can learn to shadow-box, to feint and jab
and weave, and he can lose his punch. So whatever you do, don't freeze
up."</p>

<p>There was a rap at the door, and in response to McHarg's summons
John came in, carrying in his hand a bundle of crisp, brand-new Bank of
England notes.</p>

<p>"I think you will find these right, sir," he said, as he handed the
money to McHarg. "I counted them. One 'undred pounds, sir."</p>

<p>McHarg took the notes, folded them into a wad, and thrust it
carelessly into his pocket. "All right, John," he said. "And now will
you pack a few things?"</p>

<p>He got up, looked about him absently, and then, with a sudden
resumption of his former feverish manner, he barked out:</p>

<p>"Well, George, get on your coat! We've got to be on our way!"</p>

<p>"B-b-but"--George began to temporise--"don't you think we'd better
get some lunch before we start out, Mr. McHarg? If you haven't eaten
for so long, you'll need food. Let's go somewhere now and get something
to eat."</p>

<p>George spoke with all the persuasiveness he could put into his
voice. By this time he was beginning to feel very hungry, and thought
longingly of the "prime bit" of gammon and peas that Mrs. Purvis had
prepared for him. Also he hoped that if he could only get McHarg to
have lunch before starting, he could use the occasion diplomatically to
dissuade him from his intention of departing forthwith, and taking him
along willy-nilly, on a tour that was apparently designed to embrace a
good portion of the British Isles. But McHarg, as if he foresaw
Webber's design, and also feared, perhaps, the effect of further delay
upon his almost exhausted energies, snapped curtly, with inflexible
decision:</p>

<p>"We'll eat somewhere on the road. We're getting out of town at
once."</p>

<p>George saw that it was useless to argue, so he said nothing more. He
decided to go along, wherever McHarg was going, and to spend the night,
if need be, at his friend's house in the country, trusting in the hope
that the restorative powers of a good meal and a night's sleep would
help to alter McHarg's purpose. Therefore he put on his coat and hat,
descended with McHarg in the lift, waited while he left some
instructions at the desk, and then went out with him to the automobile
that was standing at the kerb.</p>

<p>McHarg had chartered a Rolls-Royce. When George saw this magnificent
car he felt like roaring with laughter, for if this was the vehicle in
which he proposed to explore the English countryside, cooking out of a
frying-pan and sleeping beside the road at night, then the tour would
certainly be the most sumptuous and the most grotesque vagabondage
England had ever seen. John had already come down and had stowed away a
small suitcase on the floor beside the back seat. The driver, a little
man dressed appropriately in livery, touched the visor of his cap
respectfully, and he and George helped McHarg into the car. He had
suddenly gone weak, and almost fell as he got in. Once in, he asked
George to give the driver the address in Surrey, and, having said this,
he collapsed: his face sank forward on his chest, and he had again that
curious broken-in-two look about the waist. He had one hand thrust
through the loop of a strap beside the door, and if it had not been for
this support he would have slumped to the floor. George got in and sat
down beside him, still wondering desperately what to do, how in the
name of God he was going to get out of it.</p>

<p>It was well after one o'clock when they started off. They rolled
smoothly into St. James's Street, turned at the bottom into Pall Mall,
went round St. James's Palace and into the Mall, and headed towards
Buckingham Palace and Webber's own part of town. Coming out of the Mall
and wheeling across the great place before the palace, McHarg roused
himself with a jerk, peered through the drizzle and the reek--it was a
dreary day--at the magnificent sentries stamping up and down in front
of the palace, stamping solemnly, facing at the turns, and stamping
back again, and was just about to slump back when George caught him up
sharply.</p>

<p>At that moment Ebury Street was very near, and it seemed very dear
to him. George thought with desire and longing of his bed, of Mrs.
Purvis, and of his untouched gammon and peas. That morning's confident
departure already seemed to be something that had happened long ago. He
smiled bitterly as he remembered his conversation with Mrs. Purvis and
their speculations about whether Mr. McHarg would take him to lunch at
the Ritz, or at Stone's in Panton Street, or at Simpson's in the
Strand. Gone now were all these Lucullan fantasies. At that point he
would joyfully have compromised on a pub and a piece of cheese and a
pint of bitter beer.</p>

<p>As the car wheeled smoothly past the palace, he felt his last hope
slipping away. Desperately he jogged his companion by the elbow before
it should be too late and told him he lived just round the corner in
Ebury Street, and could he please stop off a moment there to get a
tooth-brush and a safety-razor, that it would take only a minute.
McHarg meditated this request gravely and finally mumbled that he
could, but to "make it snappy". Accordingly, George gave the driver the
address, and they drove down round the palace, turned into Ebury
Street, and slowed down as they approached his modest little house.
McHarg was beginning to look desperately ill. He hung on grimly to his
strap, but when the car stopped he swayed in his seat and would have
gone down if George had not caught him.</p>

<p>"Mr. McHarg," George said, "you ought to have something to eat
before we go on farther. Won't you come upstairs with me and let the
woman give you something? She has fixed me a good lunch. It's all
ready. We could eat and be out again in twenty minutes."</p>

<p>"No food," he muttered and glared at George suspiciously. "What are
you trying to do--run out on me?"</p>

<p>"No, of course not."</p>

<p>"Well, get your tooth-brush then, and hurry up. We're going to get
out of town."</p>

<p>"All right. Only I think you're making a mistake not to eat first.
It's there waiting for you if you'll take it."</p>

<p>George made it as persuasive as he could. He stood at the open door,
with one foot upon the running-board. McHarg made no answer; he lay
back against the seat with his eyes closed. But a moment later he
tugged on the strap, pulled himself partly erect, and, with just a
shade of obstinate concession, said:</p>

<p>"You got a cup of tea up there?"</p>

<p>"Of course. She'll have it for you in two minutes."</p>

<p>He pondered this information for a moment, then half unwillingly
said: "Well, I don't know. I might take a cup of tea. Maybe it would
brace me up."</p>

<p>"Come on," George said quickly, and took him by the arm.</p>

<p>The driver and George helped him out of the car. George told the man
to wait for them, that they would be back within thirty minutes, which
McHarg quickly amended to fifteen. Then George opened the street door
with his key and, slowly, carefully, helping the exhausted man, began
to propel the tall and angular form up the narrow stairs. They finally
got there. George opened the door, led him through into his
sitting-room, and seated McHarg in his most comfortable chair, where he
immediately let his head slump forward on his breast again. George lit
the little open gas radiator which provided the room with the only heat
it had, called Mrs. Purvis, who had heard them and was already coming
from the kitchen, whispered quickly to her the circumstance of his
being there and the identity of his distinguished visitor, and
dispatched her at once to make the tea.</p>

<p>When she left the sitting-room McHarg roused himself a little and
said: "Georgie, I fell all shot to hell. God, I could sleep a
month."</p>

<p>"I've just sent Mrs. Purvis for the tea," George answered. "She'll
have it ready in a minute. That'll make you feel better."</p>

<p>But almost instantly, as if the effort to speak had used up his last
energies, McHarg sank back in the chair and collapsed completely. By
the time Mrs. Purvis entered with her tray and teapot, he no longer
needed tea. He was buried in comatose oblivion--past tea or travel now,
past everything.</p>

<p>She saw instantly what had happened. She put the tray down quietly
and whispered to George: "'E's not goin' anywhere just yet. 'E will be
needin' sleep."</p>

<p>"Yes," George said. "That's what he does need, badly."</p>

<p>"It's a shame to leave 'im in that chair. If we could only get 'im
up, sir," she whispered, "and into your room, 'e could lie down in your
bed. It'd be more comfortable for 'im."</p>

<p>George nodded, stooped beside the chair, got one of McHarg's long,
dangling arms round his neck and his own arm round McHarg's waist, and,
heaving, said encouragingly: "Come on, Mr. McHarg. You'll feel better
if you lie down and stretch out." He made a manful effort and got out
of the chair, and took the few steps necessary to enter the bedroom and
reach the bed, where he again collapsed, this time face downwards.
George rolled him over on his back, straightened him out, undid his
collar, and took off his shoes. Then Mrs. Purvis covered him from the
raw chill and cold, which seemed to soak right into the little bedroom
from the whole clammy reek of fog and drizzle outside. They piled a
number of blankets and comforters upon him, brought in a small electric
heat reflector and turned it on in such a way that its warmth would
reach him, the they pulled the curtains together at the window,
darkened the room, closed the doors, and left him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Purvis was splendid.</p>

<p>"Mr. McHarg is very tired," George said to her. "A little sleep will
do him good."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," she said, and nodded wisely and sympathetically. "You can
see it's the strain 'e's been under. Meetin' all them people. And then
'avin' to travel so much. It's easy to see," she went on loftily, "that
'e's still sufferin' from the fatigue of the journey. But you," she
said quickly--"should think you'd feel tired yourself, what with the
excitement and 'avin' no lunch and all. Do come," she said
persuasively, "and 'ave a bite to eat. The gammon is nice, sir. I could
'ave it for you in a minute."</p>

<p>Her proposal had George's enthusiastic endorsement. She hastened to
the kitchen, and soon came in again and told him lunch was ready. He
went at once to the little dining-room and ate a hearty meal--gammon,
peas, boiled potatoes, a crusty apple tart with a piece of cheese, and
a bottle of Bass ale.</p>

<p>After that he returned to the sitting-room and decided to stretch
out on the sofa. It was a small sofa and much too short for him, but he
had had no sleep for more than twenty-four hours and it looked
inviting. He lay down with his legs dangling over the end, and almost
instantly fell asleep.</p>

<p>Later he was faintly conscious that Mrs. Purvis had come softly in,
had put his feet upon a chair, and had spread a blanket over him. He
was also dimly aware that she had drawn the curtains, darkened the
room, and gone softly out.</p>

<p>Later still, as she prepared to leave for the day, George heard her
open the door and listen for a moment; then, very quietly, she tiptoed
across the floor and opened the bedroom door and peered in. Evidently
satisfied that all was well, she tiptoed out again, closing the doors
gently as she went. He heard her creep softly down the stairs, and
presently the street door closed. He fell asleep again and slept
soundly for some time.</p>

<p>When George woke again it had grown completely dark outside, and
McHarg was up and stirring about in the bedroom, evidently looking for
the light. George got up and switched the light on in the sitting-room,
and McHarg came in.</p>

<p>Again there was an astonishing transtormation in him. His short
sleep seemed to have restored his vitality, and restored it to a degree
and in a direction George had not wanted. He had hoped that a few hours
of sleep would calm McHarg and make him see the wisdom of getting a
really sound rest before proceeding farther on his travels. Instead,
the man had wakened like a raging lion, and was now pacing back and
forth like a caged beast, fuming at their delay and demanding with
every breath that George get ready to depart instantly.</p>

<p>"Are you coming?" he said. "Or are you trying to back out of it?
What are you going to do, anyway?"</p>

<p>George had waked up in a semi-daze, and he now became conscious that
the door-bell was ringing, and had been ringing for some time. It was
probably this sound which had aroused them both. Telling McHarg that
he'd be back in a moment, George ran down the stairs and opened the
door. It was, of course, McHarg's chauffeur. In the excitement and
fatigue of the afternoon's event he had completely forgotten him, and
the poor fellow had been waiting all this time there in his glittering
chariot drawn up before Webber's modest door. It was not yet quite five
o'clock in the afternoon, but dark comes early in the dismal wintry
days of London's ceaseless fog and drizzle, and it was black as
midnight outside. The street lights were on, and the shop fronts were
shining out into the fog with a blurred and misty radiance. The street
itself was still and deserted, but high up over the roof-tops the wind
was beginning to swoop in fitful gusts, howling faintly in a way that
promised a wild night.</p>

<p>The little chauffeur stood patiently before George when he opened
the door, holding his visored cap respectfully in his hands, but he had
an air of restrained anxiety about him which he could not conceal. "I
beg your pardon, sir," he said, "but I wonder if you know whether Mr.
Mc'Arg 'as changed 'is plans?"</p>

<p>"Plans? Plans?" George stammered, still not quite awake, and he
shook his head like a dog coming out of the water in an effort to
compose himself and bring order to his own bewilderment. "What
plans?"</p>

<p>"About going to Surrey, sir," the little man said gently, yet giving
George a quick and rather startled look. Already the painful suspicion,
which later in the evening was to become a deep-rooted conviction, that
he was alone and under the criminal direction of two dangerous maniacs,
had begun to shape itself in the chauffeur's consciousness, but as yet
he betrayed his apprehension only by an attitude of solicitous and
somewhat tense concern. "You know, sir," he continued quietly, in a
tone of apologetic reminder, "that's where we started for hearlier in
the hafternoon."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, yes. Yes, I remember," George said, running his fingers
through his hair and speaking rather distractedly. "Yes, we did, didn't
we?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," he said gently. "And you see," he went on, almost like a
benevolent elder speaking to a child--"you see, sir, one is not
supposed to park 'ere in the street for so long a time as we've been
'ere. The bobby," he coughed apologetically behind his hand, "'as just
spoken to me, sir, and 'as told me that I've been 'ere too long and
will 'ave to move. So I thought it best to tell you, sir, and to find
out if you know what Mr. Mc'Arg intends to do."</p>

<p>"I--I think he intends to go on with it," George said. "That is, to
go on to Surrey as we started out to do. But--you say the bobby has
ordered you to move?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," the chauffeur said patiently, and held his visored cap
and looked up at George and waited.</p>

<p>"Well, then--" George thought desperately for a moment, and then
burst out: "Look here, I'll tell you what you do. Drive round the
block--drive round the block----"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," the chauffeur said, and waited.</p>

<p>"And come back here in five minutes. I'll be able to tell you then
what we're going to do."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir." He inclined his head in a brief nod of agreement,
put on his cap, and got into his car.</p>

<p>George closed the door and went back up the stairs. When he entered
the sitting-room, McHarg had on his overcoat and hat and was pacing
restlessly up and down.</p>

<p>"It was your driver," George said. "I forgot about him, but he's
been waiting there all afternoon. He wants to know what we're going to
do."</p>

<p>"What we're going to do?" McHarg shrilled. "We're going to get a
move on! Christ Almighty, man, we're four hours late already! Come on,
come on, George!" he rasped. "Let's get going!"</p>

<p>George saw that he meant it and that it was useless to try to change
his purpose. He took his brief-case, crammed tooth-brush, toothpaste,
razor, shaving cream and brush, and a pair of pyjamas into it, put on
his hat and coat, switched off the lights, ands led the way into the
hall, saying: "All right. I'm ready if you are. Let's go."</p>

<p>When they got out into the foggy drizzle of the street, the car was
just wheeling to a halt at the kerb. The chauffeur jumped out and
opened the door for them. McHarg and Webber got in. The chauffeur
climbed back into his seat, and they drove swiftly away, down the wet
street, with a smooth, cupped hissing of the tyres. They reached
Chelsea, skirted the Embankment, crossed Battersea Bridge, and began to
roll south-westward through the vast, interminable ganglia of outer
London.</p>

<p>It was a journey that Webber remembered later with nightmare
vividness. McHarg had begun to collapse again before they crossed the
Thames at Battersea. And no wonder! For weeks, in the letdown and
emptiness that had come upon him as a sequel to his great success, he
had lashed about in a frenzy of seeking for he knew not what, going
from place to place, meeting new people, hurling himself into fresh
adventures. From this impossible quest he had allowed himself no pause
or rest. And at the end of it he had found exactly nothing. Or, to be
more exact, he had found Mynheer Bendien in Amsterdam. It was easy to
see just what had happened to McHarg after that. For if, at the end of
the trail, there was nothing but a red-faced Dutchman, then, by God,
he'd at least find out what kind of stuff a red-faced Dutchman was made
of. Then for several days more, in his final fury of exasperation, he
had put the Dutchman to the test, driving him even harder than he had
driven himself, not even stopping to eat, until at last the Dutchman,
sustained by gin and his own phlegmatic constitution, had used up what
remained of McHarg's seemingly inexhaustible energies. So now he was
all in. The flare of new vitality with which he had awakened from his
nap had quickly burnt itself out: he lay back in the seat of the car,
drained and emptied of the fury which had possessed him, too exhausted
even to speak, his eyes closed, his head rolling gently with the motion
of the car, his long legs thrust out limply before him. George sat
beside him, helpless, not knowing what to do or where he was going or
how and when it would end, his gaze fixed upon the head of the little
driver, who was hunched up behind the wheel, intent upon the road,
steering the car skilfully through the traffic and the fog-bound
night.</p>

<p>The enormous ganglia of unending London rolled past them--street
after street wet with a dull gleam of rain-fogged lamps, mile after
mile of brick houses, which seemed steeped in the fog and soot and
grime of uncounted days of dismal weather, district after district in
the interminable web, a giant congeries of uncounted villages, all
grown together now into this formless, monstrous sprawl. They would
pass briefly through the high streets of these far-flung warrens. For a
moment there would be the golden nimbus of the fog-blurred lights, the
cheerful radiance of butcher shops, with the red brawn of beef, the
plucked plumpness and gangling necks of hung fowls, and the butchers in
their long white aprons; then the wine and liquor stores, and the
beer-fogged blur and warmth and murmur of the pubs, with the dull gleam
of the rain-wet pavement stretching out in front; then pea-soup
darkness again, and again the endless rows of fog-cheat houses.</p>

<p>At last they began to come to open country. There was the darkness
of the land, the smell of the wet fields, the strung spare lights of
night across the countryside. They began to feel the force of the wind
as it swooped down at them across the fields and shivered against the
sides of the car. It was blowing the fog away and the sky was lifting.
And now, against the damp, low, thick, and dismal ceiling of the
clouds, there was an immense corrupted radiance, as if all the swelter,
smoke, and fury of London's unending life had been caught up and
resumed there. With every revolution of the wheels the glow receded
farther behind them.</p>

<p>And now, with the lonely countryside all round him, George became
conscious of the mysterious architecture of night. As he felt the
abiding strength and everlastingness of the earth, he began to feel
also a sense of exultation and release. It was a feeling he had had
many times before, a feeling that every man who lives in a vast modern
city must feel when, after months within the hive of the city's
life--months of sweat and noise and violence, months of grimy brick and
stone, months of the incessant thrust and intershift and weaving of the
endless crowd, months of tainted air and tainted life, of treachery,
fear, malice, slander, blackmail, envy, hatred, conflict, fury, and
deceit, months of frenzy and the tension of wire-taut nerves and the
changeless change--he leaves the city and is free at last, out beyond
the remotest filament of that tainted and tormented web. He that has
known only a jungle of mortared brick and stone where no birds sing,
where no blade grows, has now found earth again. And yet, unfathomable
enigma that it is, he has found earth and, finding it, has lost the
world. He has found the washed cleanliness of vision and of soul that
comes from earth. He feels himself washed free of all the stains of
ancient living, its evil and its lust, its filth and cruelty, its
perverse and ineradicable pollution, But curiously, somehow, the wonder
and the mystery of it all remains, its beauty and its magic, its
richness and its joy, and as he looks back upon that baleful glow that
lights the smoky blanket of the sky, a feeling of loss and loneliness
possesses him, as if in gaining earth again he has relinquished
life.</p>

<p>The car sped onwards and still onwards, until finally the last
outpost of London was left behind and the glow in the sky was gone.
They were driving through dark country and night towards their
journey's end. McHarg had not uttered a word. He still sat with legs
sprawled out and head thrown back, swaying from the motion of the car
but held in position by one limp arm which was hooked in the strap
beside him. George was getting more and more alarmed at the thought of
bringing him in this exhausted state to the house of an old friend whom
he had not seen for years. At last he stopped the car and told the
driver to wait while he pleaded with his master.</p>

<p>He switched on the overhead light and shook him, and to his surprise
McHarg opened his eyes right away and by his responses showed that his
mind was completely clear and alert. George told him that, worn out as
he must be, he could not possibly enjoy a visit with his friend. He
begged him to change his mind, to return to London for the night, to
let him telephone his friend from the nearest town to say that he had
been delayed and would see him in a day or two, but by all means to
defer his visit until he felt better able to make it. After McHarg's
former display of obstinate determination, George had little hope of
success, but to his amazement McHarg now proved most reasonable. He
agreed to everything George said, confessed that he himself thought it
would be better not to see his friend that night, and said he was
prepared to embrace any alternative George might propose, except--on
this he was most blunt and flat--he would not go back to London. All
day his desire to get out of London had had the force and urgency of an
obsession, so George pressed no further on that point. He agreed that
they should not turn back, but asked McHarg if he had any preference
about where they should go. McHarg said he didn't care, but after
meditating with chin sunk forward on breast for several moments, he
said suddenly that he would like the sea.</p>

<p>This remark did not seem at all astonishing to George at the time.
It became astonishing only as he thought of it later. He accepted the
proposal of going to the sea as naturally as a New Yorker might accept
a suggestion of riding on a Fifth Avenue bus to see Grant's tomb. If
McHarg had said he wanted to go to Liverpool or to Manchester or to
Edinburgh, it would have been the same--George would have felt no
astonishment whatever. Once out of London, both of these Americans, in
their unconscious minds, were as little impressed by the dimensions of
England as they would have been by a half-acre lot. When McHarg said
he'd like the sea, George thought to himself: "Very well. We'll just
drive over to the other side of the island and take a look at it."</p>

<p>So George thought the idea an excellent one and fell in with it
enthusiastically, remarking that the salt air, the sound of the waves,
and a good night's sleep would do them both a world of good, and would
make them fit and ready for further adventures in the morning. McHarg,
too, began to show whole-hearted warmth for the plan. George asked him
if he had any special place in mind. He said no, that it didn't matter,
that any place was good as long as it was on the sea. In rapid order
they named over seacoast towns which they had either heard of or at one
time or another had visited--Dover, Folkestone, Bournemouth,
Eastbourne, Blackpool, Torquay, Plymouth.</p>

<p>"Plymouth! Plymouth!" cried McHarg with enthusiastic decision.
"That's the very place! I've been in there in ships dozens of times,
but never stopped off. True, it's in the harbour, but that doesn't
matter. It always looked like a nice little town. Let's go there for
the night."</p>

<p>"Oh, sir," spoke up the chauffeur, who till now had sat quietly at
his wheel, listening to two maniacs dismember the geography of the
British Isles. "Oh, sir," he repeated, with an intonation of quite
evident alarm, "you can't do that, you know. Not to-night, sir. It's
quite himpossible to make Plymouth to-night."</p>

<p>"What's the reason it is?" McHarg demanded truculently.</p>

<p>"Because, sir," said the driver, "it's a good two 'undred and fifty
miles, sir. In this weather, what with rain and never knowing when the
fog may close in again, it would take ite all of eight hours, sir, to
do it. We should not arrive there, sir, until the small hours of the
morning.</p>

<p>"Well, then, all right," McHarg cried impatiently. "We'll go
somewhere else. How about Blackpool? Blackpool, eh, Georgie?" he said,
turning to Webber feverishly, his lips lifting in a grimace of puckered
nervousness. "Let's try Blackpool. Never been there. Like to see the
place."</p>

<p>"But, sir"--the driver was now obviously
appalled--"Blackpool--Blackpool, sir, is in the north of England. Why,
sir," he whispered, "Blackpool is even farther away than Plymouth is.
It must be all of three 'undred miles, sir," he whispered, and the awe
in his tone could not have been greater if they had just proposed an
overnight drive from Philadelphia to the Pacific coast. "We couldn't
reach Blackpool, sir, before to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, then," said McHarg in disgust. "Have it your own way. You
name a place, George," he demanded.</p>

<p>Webber thought earnestly for a long minute, then, fortified with
memories of scenes from Thackeray and Dickens, he said hopefully:
"Brighton. How about Brighton?"</p>

<p>Instantly he knew that he had hit it. The driver's voice vibrated
with a tone of unspeakable relief. He turned round in his seat and
whispered with almost fawning eagerness:</p>

<p>"Yes, sir! Yes, sir! Brighton! We can do that very nicely, sir."</p>

<p>"How long will it take?" McHarg demanded.</p>

<p>"I should think, sir," said the driver, "I could do it from 'ere in
about two and a 'arf hours. A bit late for dinner, sir, but still, it
is within reach."</p>

<p>"Good. All right," McHarg said, nodding his head with decision and
settling back in his seat. "Go ahead." He waved one bony hand in a
gesture of dismissal. "We're going to Brighton."</p>

<p>They started off again, and at the next cross-road charged their
course to hunt for the Brighton road.</p>

<p>From that time on, their journey became a nightmare of halts and
turnings and changes of direction. The little driver was sure they were
headed towards Brighton, but somehow he could not find the road. They
twisted this way and that, driving for miles through towns and
villages, then out into the open country again, and getting nowhere. At
last they came to an intricate and deserted cross-road where the driver
stopped the car to look at the signs. But there was none to Brighton,
and he finally admitted that he was lost. At these words, McHarg roused
and pulled himself wearily forward in his seat, peered out into the
dark night, then asked George what he thought they ought to do. The two
of them knew even less about where they were than the driver, but they
had to go somewhere. When George hazarded a guess that Brighton ought
to be off to the left somewhere, McHarg commanded the man to take the
first left fork and see where he came out, then sank back in his seat
and closed his eyes again. At each intersection after that McHarg or
Webber would tell the driver what to do, and the little Londoner would
obey them dutifully, but it was evident that he harboured increasing
misgivings at the thought of being lost in the wilds of Surrey and
subject to the unpredictable whim of two strange Americans. For some
inexplicable reason it never occurred to either of them to stop and ask
their way, so they only succeeded in getting more lost than ever. They
shuttled back and forth, first in one direction, then in another, and
after a while George had the feeling that they must have covered a good
part of the whole complex system of roads in the region south of
London.</p>

<p>The driver himself was being rapidly reduced to a nervous wreck. The
little man was now plainly terrified. He agreed with frenzied eagerness
to everything that was said to him, but his voice trembled when he
spoke. From his manner, he obviously felt that he had fallen into the
clutches of two madmen, that he was now at their mercy in the lonely
countryside, and that something dreadful was likely to happen at any
moment. George could see him bent over the wheel, his whole figure
contracted with the tenseness of his terror. If either of the crazy
Americans on the back seat had chosen to let out a bloodcurdling war
whoop, the wretched man would not have been surprised, but he would
certainly have died instantly.</p>

<p>Under these special circumstances the very geography of the night
seemed sinister and was conducive to an increase of his terror. As the
hours passed, the night grew wilder. It became a stormy and demented
kind of night, such as one sometimes finds in England in the winter. A
man alone, if he had adventure in his soul, might have found it a
thrilling and wildly beautiful night. But to this quiet little man, who
was probably thinking bitterly of a glass of beer and the snug haven of
his favourite pub, the demoniac visage of the night must have been
appalling. It was one of those nights when the beleaguered moon drives
like a spectral ship through the scudding storm rack of the sky, and
the wind howls and shrieks like a demented fiend. They could hear it
roaring all round them through the storm-tossed branches of the barren
trees. Then it would swoop down on them with an exultant scream, and
moan and whistle round the car, and sweep away again while gusts of
beating rain drove across their vision. Then they would hear it howling
far away--remote, demented, in the upper air, rocking the branches of
the trees. And the spectral moon kept driving in and out, now casting a
wild, wan radiance over the stormy landscape, now darting in behind a
billowing mass of angry-looking clouds and leaving them to darkness and
the fiendish howling of the wind. It was a fitting night for the
commission of a crime, and the driver, it was plain to see, now feared
the worst.</p>

<p>Somewhere along the road, after they had spent hours driving back
and forth and getting nowhere, McHarg's amazing reserves of energy and
vitality ran completely out. He was sitting sprawled out as before,
with head thrown back, when suddenly he groped blindly with a hand
towards George and said:</p>

<p>"I'm done in, George! Stop the car! I can't go on."</p>

<p>George stopped the car at once. There by the roadside in the
darkness, in stormy wind and scudding rain, they halted. In the van and
fitful light of the spectral moon McHarg's appearance was ghastly. His
face now looked livid and deathlike. George was greatly alarmed and
suggested that he get out of the car and see if the cold air wouldn't
make him feel better.</p>

<p>McHarg answered very quietly, with the utter finality of despair.
"No," he said. "I just feel as if I'd like to die. Leave me alone." He
slumped back into his corner, dosed his eyes, and seemed to resign
himself entirely into George's keeping. He did not speak again during
the remainder of that horrible journey.</p>

<p>In the half-darkness, illuminated only by the instrument panel of
the car and the eerie light of the moon, George and the driver looked
at each other in mute and desperate interrogation. Presently the driver
moistened his dry lips and whispered:</p>

<p>"What are we to do now, sir? Where shall we go?"</p>

<p>George thought for a moment, then answered: "We'll have to go back
to his friend's house, I think. Mr. McHarg may be very ill. Turn round
quickly, and let's get there as soon as possible."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir! Yes, sir!" the driver whispered. He backed the car round
and started off again.</p>

<p>From that point on, the journey was just pure nightmare. The
directions they had received were complicated and would have been hard
enough to follow if they had kept to the road they had first intended
to take. But now they were lost and off their course, and had somehow
to find their way back to it. Through what seemed to George nothing
less than a miracle, this was finally accomplished. Then their
instructions required them to look carefully for several obscure
cross-roads, make the proper turns at each, and at the end of all this
find the lonely country lane up which McHarg's friend lived. In
attempting it, they lost their way again and had to go back to a
village, where the driver got his bearings and the true directions. It
was after ten-thirty before they finally found the lane leading up to
the house which was their destination.</p>

<p>And now the prospect was more sinister and weird than any they had
seen. George could not believe that they were still in England's
Surrey. He had always thought of Surrey as a pleasant and gentle place,
a kind of mild and benevolent suburb of London. The name had called to
his mind a vision of sweet, green fields, thick-sown with towns and
villages. It was, he had thought, a place of peace and tranquil spires,
as well as a kind of wonderful <i>urbs in rure</i>, a lovely
countryside of which all parts were within an hour's run of London, a
place where one could enjoy bucolic pleasures without losing any of the
convenient advantages of the city, and a place where one was never out
of hailing distance of his neighbour. But the region they had now come
to was not at all like this. It was densely wooded, and as wild and
desolate on that stormy night as any spot he had ever seen. As the car
ground slowly up the tortuous road, it seemed to George that they were
climbing the fiendish slope of Nightmare Hill, and he rather expected
that when the moon broke from the clouds again they would find
themselves in a cleared and barren circle in the forest, surrounded by
the whole witches' carnival of Walpurgis Night. The wind howled through
the rocking trees with insane laughter, the broken clouds scudded
across the heavens like ghosts in flight, and the car lurched, bumped,
groaned, and lumbered its way up a road which must have been there when
the Romans came to Rye, and which, from the feel of it, had not been
repaired or used since. There was not a house or a light in sight.</p>

<p>George began to feel that they were lost again, and that surely no
one would choose to live in this inaccessible wilderness. He was ready
to give up and was about to command the driver to turn back when, as
they rounded a bend, he saw, away on the right, a hundred yards or so
off the road and at some elevation above it, a house--and from its
windows issued the beaconing assurance of light and warmth.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="chapter5-36"></a>36. The House in the Country</h2>

<p>The chauffeur brought the car to a jolting halt. "This must be it,
sir," he whispered. "It's the only 'ouse there is." His tone indicated
heightened tension rather than relief.</p>

<p>George agreed that it was probably the place they were looking
for.</p>

<p>All the way up the hill McHarg had given no signs of life. George
was seriously alarmed about him, and his anxiety had been increased the
last few miles by the inanimate flappings and jerkings of the long,
limp arms and bony hands of the exhausted figure every time the car hit
a new bump in the road or lurched down into another rut. George spoke
to him, but there was no answer. He did not want to leave him, so he
suggested to the chauffeur that he'd better get out and go up to the
house and find out if Mr. McHarg's friend really lived there; if so,
George told him to ask the man to come down to the car.</p>

<p>This request was more than the chauffeur could bear in his already,
terrified state. If before he had been frightened to be <i>with</i>
them, he seemed now even more frightened at the thought of being
<i>without</i> them. What he was afraid of George did not know, but he
spoke as if he thought the other members of their bloody gang were in
that house, just waiting for him.</p>

<p>"Oh, sir," he whispered, "I couldn't go up there, sir. Not to that
'ouse," he shuddered. "Really, sir, I couldn't. I'd much rather you'd
go, sir."</p>

<p>Accordingly, George got out, took a deep breath to brace himself,
and started reluctantly up the path. He felt trapped in a grotesque and
agonising predicament. He had no idea whom he was going to meet. He did
not even know the name of McHarg's friend. McHarg had spoken of him
only as Rick, which George took to be an abbreviation or a nickname.
And he could not be certain that the man lived here. All he knew was
that after a day filled with incredible happenings, and a nightmarish
ride in a Rolls-Royce with a terrified driver, he was now advancing up
a path with rain and wind beating in his face towards a house he had
never seen before to tell someone whose name he did not know that one
of the most distinguished of American novelists was lying exhausted at
his door, and would he please come out and see if he knew him.</p>

<p>So he went on up the path and knocked at the door of what appeared
to be a rambling old farm-house that had been renovated. In a moment
the door opened and a man stood before him, and George knew at once
that he must be, not a servant, but the master of the place. He was a
well-set and well-kept Englishman of middle age. He wore a velvet
jacket, in the pockets of which he kept his hands thrust while he
stared out with distrust at his nocturnal visitor. He had on a wing
collar and a faultless bow tie in a polka-dot pattern. This touch of
formal spruceness made George feel painfully awkward and embarrassed,
for he knew what a disreputable figure he himself must cut. He had not
shaved for two days, and his face was covered with a coarse smudge of
stubbly beard. Save for the afternoon's brief nap, he had not slept for
thirty-six hours, and his eyes were red and bloodshot. His shoes were
muddy, and his old hat, which was jammed down on his head, was dripping
with the rain. And he was tired out, not only by physical fatigue, but
by nervous strain and worry as well. It was plain that the Englishman
thought him a suspicious character, for he stiffened and stood staring
at him without a word.</p>

<p>"You're--I----" George began--"that is to say, if you're the one I'm
looking for----"</p>

<p>"Eh?" the man said in a startled voice. "What!"</p>

<p>"It's Mr. McHarg," George tried again. "If you know him----"</p>

<p>"Eh?" he repeated, and then almost at once, "Oh!" The rising
intonation of the man's tone and the faint howl of surprise and
understanding that he put into the word made it sound like a startled,
sharply uttered "Owl" He was silent a moment, searching George's face.
"Ow!" he said again, and then quietly: "Where is he?"</p>

<p>"He--he's out here in his car," George said eagerly, feeling an
overwhelming sense of relief.</p>

<p>"Ow!" the Englishman cried again, and then, impatiently: "Well,
then, why doesn't he come in? We've been waiting for him."</p>

<p>"I think if you'd go down and speak to him----" George began, and
paused.</p>

<p>"Ow!" the gentleman cried, looking at George with a solemn air. "Is
he--that is to say--?...Ow!" he cried, as if a great light had suddenly
burst upon him. "Hm-m!" he muttered meditatively. "Well, then," he said
in a somewhat firmer voice, stepping out into the path and closing the
door carefully behind him, "suppose we just go down and have a look at
him. Shall we?"</p>

<p>The last squall of rain had passed as quickly as it had blown up,
and the moon was sailing clear again as they started down the path
together. Half-way along, the Englishman stopped, looked apprehensive,
and shouted to make himself heard above the wind:</p>

<p>"I say--is he--I mean to say," he coughed, "is he--<i>sick?</i>"</p>

<p>George knew by the emphasis on that final word, as well as from
previous experience with the English, that when he said "sick" he meant
only one thing. George shook his head.</p>

<p>"He looks very ill," he said, "but he is not <i>sick</i>."</p>

<p>"Because," the gentleman went on with howling apprehensiveness, "if
he's sick--ow, dear me!" he exclaimed. "I'm very fond of Knuck, you
know--I've known him for years--but if he's going to get <i>sick!</i>"
He shuddered slightly. "If you don't mind, I'd rather not. I don't want
to know about it!" he shouted rapidly. "I--I don't want to hear about
it! I--I don't want to be round when it's going on! I--I--I wash my
hands of the whole business!" he blurted out.</p>

<p>George reassured him that Mr. McHarg had not been sick but was
merely desperately ill, so they went on down the path until they got to
the car. The Englishman, after a moment's hesitation, stepped up and
opened the door, thrust his head inside, and, peering down at McHarg's
crumpled figure, called out:</p>

<p>"Knuck! I say, Knuck!"</p>

<p>McHarg was silent, save for his hoarse breathing, which was almost a
snore.</p>

<p>"Knuck, old chap!" the Englishman cried again. "I say, Knuck!" he
cried more loudly. "Are you there, old boy?"</p>

<p>McHarg very obviously <i>was</i> there, but he gave no answer.</p>

<p>"I say, Knuck! Speak up, won't you, man? It's Rick!"</p>

<p>McHarg only seemed to snore more hoarsely at this announcement, but
after a moment he shifted one long jack-knifed leg a few inches and,
without opening his eyes, grunted: "'Lo, Rick." Then he began to snore
again.</p>

<p>"I say, Knuck!" the Englishman cried with sharper insistence. "Won't
you get up, man? We're waiting for you at the house!"</p>

<p>There was no response except the continued heavy breathing. The
Englishman made further efforts but nothing happened, and at length he
withdrew his head out of the car and, turning to George, said:</p>

<p>"I think we'd better help him inside. Knuck has worn himself out
again, I fancy."</p>

<p>"Yes," said George anxiously. "He looks desperately ill, as if he
were on the point of complete physical and nervous collapse. We'd
better call a doctor, hadn't we?"</p>

<p>"Ow, no," said the Englishman cheerfully. "I've known Knuck a long
time and seen this happen before when he got all keyed up. He drives
himself mercilessly, you know--won't rest--won't stop to eat--doesn't
know how to take care of himself. It would kill anybody else, the way
he lives. But not Knuck. It's nothing to worry about, really. He'll be
all right. You'll see."</p>

<p>With this comforting assurance they helped McHarg out of the car and
stood him on his feet. His emaciated form looked pitifully weak and
frail, but the cold air seemed to brace him up. He took several deep
breaths and looked about him.</p>

<p>"That's fine," said the Englishman encouragingly. "Feel better now,
old chap?"</p>

<p>"Feel Godawful," said McHarg. "All in. Want to go to bed."</p>

<p>"Of course," said the Englishman. "But you ought to eat first. We've
kept dinner waiting. It's all ready."</p>

<p>"No food," said McHarg brusquely. "Sleep. Eat to-morrow."</p>

<p>"All right, old man," the Englishman said amiably. "Whatever you
say. But your friend here must be starved. We'll fix you both up. Do
come along," he said, and took McHarg by the arm.</p>

<p>The three of them started to move up the path together.</p>

<p>"But, sir," spoke a plaintive voice at George's shoulder, for he was
on the side nearest the car. Full of their own concerns, they had
completely forgotten the little driver. "But, sir," he now leaned out
of the window and whispered: "what shall I do with the car, sir?
Will"--he moistened his lips nervously--"will you be needing it again
tonight, sir?"</p>

<p>The Englishman took immediate charge of the situation.</p>

<p>"No," he said crisply, "we shan't be needing it. Just drive it up
behind the house, won't you, and leave it there."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, yes, sir," the driver gasped. What he was still afraid of
not even he could have said. "Drive it up be'ind the 'ouse, sir," he
repeated mechanically. "Very good, sir. And--and--" again he moistened
his dry lips.</p>

<p>"And, ow yes!" the Englishman cried, suddenly recollecting. "Go into
the kitchen when you're through. My butler will give you something to
eat."</p>

<p>Then, turning cheerfully and taking McHarg by the arm again, he led
the way up the path, leaving the stricken driver behind to mutter:
"Yes, sir, yes, sir," to the demented wind and scudding moon.</p>

<p>After the blind wilderness of storm and trouble, the house, as they
entered it, seemed very warm and bright with lights. It was a lovely
house, low-ceilinged, panelled with old wood. Its mistress, a charming
and very beautiful woman much younger than her husband, came forward to
greet them. McHarg spoke a few words to his hostess and then
immediately repeated his desire for sleep. The woman seemed to take in
the situation at once and led the way upstairs to the guest-room, which
had already been prepared for them. It was a comfortable room with
deep-set windows. A fire had been kindled in the grate. There were two
beds, the covers of which had been folded neatly down, the white linen
showing invitingly.</p>

<p>The woman left them, and her husband and George did what they could
to help McHarg get to bed. He was dead on his feet. They took off his
shoes, collar, and tie, then propped him up while they got his coat and
vest off. They laid him on the bed, straightened him out, and covered
him. By the time all this was done and they were ready to leave the
room, McHarg was lost to the world in deep and peaceful slumber.</p>

<p>The two men went downstairs again, and now for the first time
remembered that in the confusion of their meeting they had not thought
to introduce themselves. George told his name, and was pleased and
flattered to learn that his host knew it and had even read his book.
His host had the curious name of Rickenbach Reade. He informed George
later in the evening that he was half-German. He had lived in England
all his life, however, and in manner, speech, and appearance he was
pure British.</p>

<p>Reade and Webber had been a little stiff with each other from the
start. The circumstances of Webber's arrival had not been exactly
conducive to easy companionship or the intimacy of quick understanding.
After introductions were completed with a touch of formal constraint,
Reade asked Webber if he did not want to wash up a bit, and ushered him
into a small wash-room. When George emerged, freshened up as much as
soap and water and comb and brush could accomplish, his host was
waiting for him and, still with a trace of formality, led him into the
dining-room, where the lady had preceded them. They all sat down at the
table.</p>

<p>It was a lovely room, low-ceilinged, warm, panelled with old wood.
The lady was lovely, too. And the dinner, although it had been standing
for hours, was nevertheless magnificent. While they were waiting for
the soup to come on, Reade gave George a glass of fine dry Sherry, then
another, and still another. The soup came in at last, served by a
fellow with a big nose and a sharp, shrewd, Cockney sort of face,
correctly dressed for the occasion in clean but somewhat faded livery.
It was a wonderful soup, thick tomato, the colour of dark mahogany.
George could not conceal his hunger. He ate greedily, and, with the
evidence of that enthusiastic appetite before them all the stiffness
that was left began to melt away.</p>

<p>The butler brought in an enormous roast of beef, then boiled
potatoes and Brussels sprouts. Reade carved a huge slab of meat for
George, and the lady garnished his platc generously with the
vegetables. They ate, too, but it was evident that they had already had
their dinner. They took only small portions and left their plates
unfinished, but they went through the motions just to keep George
company. The beef vanished from his own plate in no time at all.</p>

<p>"I say!" cried Reade, seizing the carving knife again. "Do let me
give you some more. You must be starved."</p>

<p>"I should think you'd be famished," said his wife in a musical
voice. So George ate again.</p>

<p>The butler brought in wine--old, full-toned Burgundy in a cobwebbed
bottle. They polished that off. Then for dessert there was a deep and
crusty apple pudding and a large slice of cheese. George ate up
everything in sight. When he had finished he heaved a great sigh of
satisfied appeasement and looked up. At that instant their three pairs
of eyes suddenly met, and with one accord they leaned back in their
chairs and roared with laughter.</p>

<p>It was the mutual and spontaneous kind of laughter that one almost
never hears. It was a booming, bellowing, solid, and ungovernable
"haw-haw-haw" that exploded out of them in a rib-splitting paroxysm and
bounded and reverberated all round the walls until the very glasses on
the sideboard started jingling. Once begun, it swelled and rose and
mounted till it left them exhausted and aching, reduced to wheezing
gasps of almost inaudible mirth, and then, when it seemed that they
didn't have another gasp left in them and that their weary ribs could
stand no more, it would begin again, roaring and rolling and
reverberating round the room with renewed force. Twice while this was
going on the butler came to the swinging-door, opened it a little, and
craftily thrust his startled face round. Each time the sight of him set
them off again. At length, when they were subsiding into the last faint
wheezes of their fit, the butler thrust his face round the door again
and said:</p>

<p>"Please, sir. The driver's 'ere."</p>

<p>This wretched little man now reappeared, standing nervously in the
doorway, fingering his cap, and moistening his dry lips
apprehensively.</p>

<p>"Please, sir," he finally managed to whisper. "The car. Will you be
wanting it to stay be'ind the 'ouse all night, sir, or shall I take it
to the nearest village?"</p>

<p>"How far is the nearest village?" George wheezed faintly.</p>

<p>"It's about six miles, sir, I understand," he whispered, with a look
of desperation and terror in his eyes.</p>

<p>The expression on his face was too much for them. A strangled scream
burst from Webber's throat. Mrs. Reade bent forward, thrusting her
wadded napkin over her mouth. As for Rickenbach Reade, he just lay back
in his chair with lolling head and roared like one possessed.</p>

<p>The driver stood there, rooted to the spot. It was clear that he
thought his time had come. These maniacs had him at their mercy now,
but he was too paralyzed to flee. And they could do nothing to allay
his nameless fear. They could not speak to him, they could not explain,
they could not even look at him. Every time they tried to say something
and glanced in his direction and caught sight of the little man's
blanched and absurdly tortured face, they would strangle with new
whoops and yells and shrieks of helpless laughter.</p>

<p>But at last it was over. The mood was spent. They felt drained and
foolish and sober and ashamed of themselves because of the needless
fright they had given the little driver. So, calmly and gently, they
told him to leave the car where it was and forget about it. Reade asked
his butler to take care of the driver and put him up for the night in
his own quarters.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, yes, sir," mumbled the little driver automatically.</p>

<p>"Very good, sir," said the butler briskly, and led the man away.</p>

<p>They now arose from the table and went into the living-room. In a
few minutes the butler brought in a tray with coffee. They sat round a
cheerful fire and drank it, and had brandy afterwards. It was
wonderfully warm and comforting to sit there and listen to the fury of
the storm outside, and under the spell of it they felt drawn together,
as if they had all known each other a long time. They laughed and
talked and told stories without a trace of self-consciousness. Reade,
seeing that George was still worried about McHarg, tried in various
ways to allay his fears.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," he said, "I've known Knuck for years. He drives
himself to exhaustion and I've seen him do it a dozen times, but it
always comes out all right in the end. It's astonishing how he does it.
I'm sure I couldn't. No one else could, but he can. The man's vitality
is amazing. Just when you think he's done himself in, he surprises you
by bounding up and beginning all over again, as fresh as a daisy."</p>

<p>George had already seen enough to know that this was true. Reade
told of incidents which verified it further. Some years before, McHarg
had come to England to work on a new book. Even then his way of life
had been enough to arouse the gravest apprehensions among those who
knew him. Few people believed that he could long survive it, and his
writing friends did not understand how he could get any work done.</p>

<p>"We were together one night," Reade continued, "at a party that he
gave in a private room at the Savoy. He had been going it for days,
driving himself the way he does, and by ten o'clock that night he was
all in. He just seemed to cave in, and went to sleep at the table. We
laid him out on a couch and went on with the party. Later on, two of
us, with the assistance of a couple of porters, got him out of the
place into a taxi and took him home. He had a flat in Cavendish Square.
The next day," Reade went on, "we had arranged to have lunch together.
I had no idea--not the faintest--that the man would be able to make it.
In fact, I very much doubted whether he would be out of his bed for two
or three days. Just the same, I stopped in a little before one o'clock
to see how he was."</p>

<p>Reade was silent a moment, looking into the fire. Then, with a sharp
expiration of his breath, he said:</p>

<p>"Well! He was sitting there at his desk, in front of his
typewriter,, wearing an old dressing-gown over his baggy old tweeds,
and he was typing away like mad. There was a great sheaf of manuscript
beside him. He told me he'd been at it since six o'clock and had done
over twenty pages. As I came in, he just looked up and said: 'Hello,
Rick. I'll be with you in a minute. Sit down, won't
you?'...Well!"--again the sharp expiration of his breath--"I had to sit
down! I simply fell into a chair and stared at him. It was the most
astonishing thing I had ever seen."</p>

<p>"And was he able to go to lunch with you?"</p>

<p>"Was he able!" cried Reade. "Why, he fairly bounded from his chair,
flung on his coat and hat, pulled me out of my seat, and said: 'Come
on! I'm hungry as a bear.' And what was most astounding," Reade
continued, "was that he remembered everything that had happened the
night before. He remembered everything that had been said, too--even
the things that were said during the time when I should have sworn he
was unconscious. It is an astonishing creature! Astonishing!" cried the
Englishman.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>In the warming glow of the fire and their new-found intimacy they
had several more brandies, smoked endless cigarettes, and talked on and
on for hours, forgetting the passage of time. It was the kind of talk
which, freed of all constricting traces of self-consciousness, lets
down the last barriers of natural reserve and lays bare the souls of
men. George's host was in high spirits and told the most engaging
stories about himself, his wife, and the good life they were making
here in the isolated freedom of their rural retreat. He made it seem
not only charming and attractive, full of wholesome country pleasures,
but altogether desirable and enviable. It was an idyllic picture that
he painted--such a picture of rugged independence, with its simple joys
and solid comforts, as has at one time or another haunted the
imagination of almost every man in the turmoil, confusion, and
uncertainties of the complex world we live in. But as George listened
to his host and felt the nostalgic attractiveness of the images that
were unfolded before him, he also felt a disquieting sense of something
else behind it all which never quite got into the picture, but which
lent colourings of doubt and falsity to every part of it.</p>

<p>For Rickenbach Reade, George began to see after a while, was one of
those men who are unequal to the conditions of modern life, and who
have accordingly retreated from the tough realities which they could
not face. The phenomenon was not anew one to George. He had met and
observed a number of people like this. And it was now evident to him
that they formed another group or family or race, another of those
little worlds which have no boundary lines of country or of place. One
found a surprising number of them in America, particularly in the more
sequestered purlieus of Boston, Cambridge, and Harvard University. One
found them also in New York's Greenwich Village, and when even that
makeshift Little Bohemia became too harsh for them, they retired into a
kind of desiccated country life.</p>

<p>For all such people the country became the last refuge. They bought
little farms in Connecticut or Vermont, and renovated the fine old
houses with just a shade too much of whimsey or of restrained good
taste. Their quaintness was a little too quaint, their simplicity a
little too subtle, and on the old farms that they bought no utilitarian
seeds were sown and no grain grew. They went in for flowers, and in
time they learned to talk very knowingly about the rarer varieties.
They loved the simple life, of course. They loved the good feel of "the
earth". They were just a shade too conscious of "the earth", and George
had heard them say, the women as well as the men, how much they loved
to work in it.</p>

<p>And work in it they did. In spring they worked on their new rock
garden, with the assistance of only one other man--some native of the
region who had hired himself out for wages, and whose homely virtues
and more crotchety characteristics they quietly observed and told
amusing stories about to their friends. Their wives worked in the
earth, too, attired in plain yet not unattractive frocks, and they even
learned to clip the hedges, wearing canvas gloves to protect their
hands. These dainty and lovely creatures became healthily embrowned:
their comely forearms took on a golden glow, their faces became warm
with soaked-up sunlight, and sometimes they even had a soft, faint down
of gold just barely visible above the cheek-bone. They were good to
see.</p>

<p>In winter there were also things to do. The snows came down, and the
road out to the main highway became impassable to cars for three weeks
at a time. Not even the trucks of the A. &amp; P. could get through. So
for three whole weeks on end they had to plod their way out on foot, a
good three-quarters of a mile, to lay in provisions. The days were full
of other work as well. People in cities might think that country life
was dull in winter, but that was because they simply did not know. The
squire became a carpenter. He was working on his play, of course, but
in between times he made furniture. It was good to be able to do
something with one's hands. He had a workshop fitted up in the old
barn. There he had his studio, too, where he could carry on his
intellectual labours undisturbed. The children were forbidden to go
there. And every morning, after taking the children to school, the
father could return to his barn-studio and have the whole morning free
to get on with the play.</p>

<p>It was a fine life for the children, by the way. In summer they
played and swam and fished and got wholesome lessons in practical
democracy by mingling with the hired man's children. In winter they
went to an excellent private school two miles away. It was run by two
very intelligent people, an expert in planned economy and his wife, an
expert in child psychology, who between them were carrying on the most
remarkable experiments in education.</p>

<p>Life in the country was really full of absorbing interests which
city folk knew nothing about. For one thing, there was local politics,
in which they had now become passionately involved. They attended all
the town meetings, became hotly partisan over the question of a new
floor for the bridge across the creek, took sides against old Abner
Jones, the head selectman, and in general backed up the younger, more
progressive element. Over week-ends, they had the most enchanting tales
to tell their ciry friends about these town meetings. They were full of
stories, too, about all the natives, and could make the most
sophisticated visitor howl with laughter when, after coffee and brandy
in the evening, the squire and his wife would go through their two-part
recital of Seth Freeman's involved squabble and lawsuit with Rob
Perkins over a stone fence. One really got to know his neighbours in
the country. It was a whole world in itself. Life here was simple, yet
it was so good.</p>

<p>In this old farm-house they ate by candle-light at night. The pine
panelling of the dining-room had been there more than two hundred
years. They had not changed it. In fact, the whole front part of the
house was just the same as it had always been. All they had added was
the new wing for the children. Of course, they had had to do a great
deal when they bought the place. It had fallen into shocking disrepair.
The floors and sills were rotten and had had to be replaced. They had
also built a concrete basement and installed an oil furnace. This had
been costly, but it was worth the price. The people who had sold them
the house were natives of the region who had gone to seed. The farm had
been in that one family for five generations. It was incredible,
though, to see what they had done to the house. The sitting-room had
been covered with an oilcloth carpet. And in the dining-room, right
beside the beautiful old revolutionary china chest, which they had
persuaded the people to sell with the house, had been an atrocious
gramophone with one of those old-fashioned horns. Could one imagine
that?</p>

<p>Of course they had had to furnish the house anew from cellar to
garret. Their city stuff just wouldn't do at all. It had taken time and
hard work, but by going quietly about the countryside and looking into
farmers' houses, they had managed to pick up very cheaply the most
exquisite pieces, most of them dating back to revolutionary times, and
now the whole place was in harmony at last. They even drank their beer
from pewter mugs. Grace had discovered these, covered with cobwebs, in
the cellar of an old man's house. He was eighty-seven, he said, and the
mugs had belonged to his father before him. He'd never had no use for
'em himself, and if she wanted 'em he calc'lated that twenty cents
apiece would be all right. Wasn't it delicious! And everyone agreed it
was.</p>

<p>The seasons changed and melted into one another, and they observed
the seasons. They would not like to live in places where no seasons
were. The adventure of the seasons was always thrilling. There was the
day in late summer when someone saw the first duck flying south, and
they knew by this token that the autumn of the year had come. Then
there was the first snowflake that melted as it fell to usher in the
winter. But the most exciting of all was the day in early spring when
someone discovered that the first snowdrop had opened or that the first
starling had come. They kept a diary of the seasons, and they wrote
splendid letters to their city friends:</p>

<p>"I think you would like it now. The whole place is simply frantic,
with spring. I heard a thrush for the first time to-day. Overnight
almost, our old apple-trees have burst into full bloom. If you wait
another week, it will be too late. So do come, won't you? You'll love
our orchard and our twisted, funny, dear old apple-trees. They've been
here, most of them, I suspect, for eighty years. It's not like modern
orchards, with their little regiments of trees. We don't get many
apples. They are small and sharp and tart, and twisted like the trees
themselves, and there are never too many of them but always just
enough. Somehow we love them all the better for it. It's so New
England."</p>

<p>So year followed year in healthy and happy order. The first year the
rock garden got laid down and the little bulbs and alpine plants set
out. Hollyhocks were sown all over the place, against the house and
beside the fences. By the next year they were blooming in gay
profusion. It was marvellous how short a time it took. That second year
he built the studio in the barn, doing most of the work with his own
hands, with only the simple assistance of the hired man. The third
year--the children were growing up now; they grow fast in the
country--he got the swimming-pool begun. The fourth year it was
finished. Meanwhile he was busy on his play, but it went slowly because
there was so much else that had to be done.</p>

<p>The fifth year--well, one did miss the city sometimes. They would
never think of going back there to This place was wonderful, except for
three months in the winter. So this year they were moving in and taking
an apartment for the three bad months. Grace, of course, loved music
and missed the opera, while he liked the theatre, and it would be good
to have again the companionship of certain people whom they knew. That
was the greatest handicap of country life--the natives made fine
neighbours, but one sometimes missed the intellectual stimulus of city
life. And so this year he had decided to take the old girl in. They'd
see the shows and hear the music andrenew their acquaintance with old
friends and find out what was going on. They might even run down to
Bermuda for three weeks in February. Or to Haiti. That was a place,
he'd heard, that modern life had hardly touched. They had windmills and
went in for voodoo worship. It was all savage and most primitively
colourful. It would get them out of the rut to go off somewhere on a
trip. Of course they'd be back in the country by the first of
April.</p>

<p>Such was the fugitive pattern in one of its most common
manifestations. But it also took other forms. The American expatriates
who had taken up residence in Europe were essentially the same kind of
people, though theirs was a more desolate and more embittered type of
escapism. George Webber had known them in Paris, in Switzerland, and
here in England, and it seemed to him that they represented one of the
extremest breeds among the race of futilitarians. These were the
Americans who had gone beyond even the pretence of being nature-lovers
and earth-discoverers and returners to the simple life of native virtue
in rural Yankeedom. These were the ones to whom nothing was left except
an encyclopedic sneer--a sneer at everything American. It was a sneer
which was derived from what they had read, from what others had said,
or from some easy rationalization of self-defence. It was a sneer that
did not have in it the sincerity of passion or the honesty of true
indignation, and it became feebler year after year. For these people
had nothing left but drink and sneering, the dreary round of cafe life
with its repetition of racked saucers--nothing left but a blurred
vision of the world, a sentimental fantasy of "Paris", or of "England",
or of "Europe", which was as unreal as if all their knowledge had been
drawn from the pages of a fairy-tale, and as if they had never set foot
upon these shores which they professed to understand so well and to
cherish so devotedly.</p>

<p>And always with this race of men it seemed to George that the
fundamental inner structure Of illusion and defeat was the same,
whether they followed the more innocuous formula of flight to the farm,
with its trumped-up interest in rock gardening, carpentry, hollyhock
culture, and the rest of it, or whether they took the more embittered
route of retreat to Europe and the racked saucers. And it made no
difference whether they were Americans, Englishmen, Germans, or
Hottentots. All of them betrayed themselves by the same weaknesses.
They fled a world they were not strong enough to meet. If they had
talent, it was a talent that was not great enough to win for them the
fulfilment and success which they pretended to scorn, but for which
each of them would have sold the pitifully small remnant of his meagre
soul. If they wanted to create, they did not want it hard enough to
make and shape and finish something in spite of hell and heartbreak. If
they wanted to work, they did not want it genuinely enough to work and
keep on working till their eyeballs ached and their brains were dizzy,
to work until their loins were dry, their vitals hollow, to work until
the whole world reeled before them in a grey blur of weariness and
depleted energy, to work until their tongues clove to their mouths and
their pulses hammered like dry mallets at their temples, to work until
no work was left in them, until there was no rest and no repose, until
they could not sleep, until they could do nothing and could work no
more--and then work again. They were the pallid half-men of the arts,
more desolate and damned than if they had been born with no talent at
all, more lacking in their lack, possessing half, than if their lack
had been complete. And so, half full of purpose, they eventually fled
the task they were not equal to--and they pottered, tinkered, gardened,
carpentered, and drank.</p>

<p>Such a man, in his own way, was this Englishman, Rickenbach Reade.
He was, as he confided to George later in the evening, a writer--as he
himself put it, with a touch of bitter whimsey, "a writer of sorts". He
had had a dozen books published. He took them from their shelves with a
curious eagerness that was half apology and showed them to George. They
were critical biographies of literary men and politicians, and were
examples of the "debunking school" of historical writing. George later
read one or two of them, and they turned out to be more or less what he
had expected. They were the kind of books that debunked everything
except themselves. They were the lifeless products of a padded
Stracheyism: their author, lacking Strachey's wit and shirking the
labours of his scholarship, succeeded at best in a feeble mimicry of
his dead vitality, his moribund fatigue, his essential foppishness. So
these books, dealing with a dozen different lives and periods, were
really all alike, all the same--the manifestations of defeat, the jabs
of an illusioned disillusion, the sceptical evocations of a fantastic
and unliving disbelief.</p>

<p>Their author, being the kind of man he was, could not write
otherwise than as he had written. Having no belief or bottom in
himself, he found no belief or bottom in the lives he wrote about.
Everything was bunk, every great man who ever lived had been built up
into the image of greatness by a legend of concocted bunk; truth,
therefore, lay in the debunking process, since all else was bunk, and
even truth itself was bunk. He was one of those men who, by the nature
of their characters and their own defeat, could believe only the worst
of others. If he had written about Caesar, he could never have
convinced himself that Caesar looked--as Caesar looked; he would
assuredly have found evidence to show that Caesar was a miserable
dwarf, the butt of ridicule among his own troops. If he had written
about Napoleon, he would have seen him only as a fat and pudgy little
man who got his forelock in the soup and had grease spots on the lapels
of his marshal's uniform. If he had written about George Washington, he
would have devoted his chief attention to Washington's false teeth, and
would have become so deeply involved with them that he would have
forgotten all about George Washington. If he had written about Abraham
Lincoln, he would have seen him as a deified Uriah Heep, the grotesque
product of backwoods legendry, a country lawyer come to town, his very
fame a thing of chance, the result of a fortuitous victory and a timely
martyrdom. He could never have believed that Lincoln really said the
things that Lincoln said, or that he really wrote what he is known to
have written. Why? Because the things said and written were too much
like Lincoln. They were too good to be true. Therefore they were myths.
They had not been said at all. Or, if they had been said, then somebody
else had said them. Stanton had said them, or Seward had said them, or
a newspaper reporter had said them--anybody could have said them except
Lincoln.</p>

<p>Such was the tone and temper of Reade's books, and such was the
quality of disbelief that had produced them. In consequence, they
fooled no one except the author. They did not even have the energy of
an amusing or persuasive slander. They were stillborn the moment they
issued from the press. No one read them or paid any attention to
them.</p>

<p>And how did he rationalise to himself his defeat and failure? In the
easy, obvious, and inevitable way. He had been rash enough, he told
George with a smile of faint, ironic bitterness, to expose some of the
cherished figures of public worship and, with his cold, relentless
probing for the truth, to shatter the false legends that surrounded
them. Naturally, his reward had been anathema and abuse, the hatred of
the critics and the obstinate hostility of the public. It had been a
thankless business from beginning to end, so he was done with it. He
had turned his back on the prejudice, bigotry, stupidity, and hypocrisy
of the whole fickle and idolatrous world, and had come here to the
country to find solitude and seclusion. One gathered that he would
write no more.</p>

<p>And this life certainly had its compensations. The old house which
Reade had bought and renovated, making it a trifle too faultlessly
agricultural, with a work-bench for mending harness in the kitchen, was
nevertheless a charming place. His young wife was gracious and lovely,
and obviously cared a great deal for him. And Reade himself, apart from
the literary pretensions which had embittered his life, was not a bad
sort of man. When one understood and accepted the nature of his
illusions and defeat, one saw that he was a likable and good-hearted
fellow.</p>

<p>It was growing late, but they had not noticed and were surprised
when the clock in the hall chimed two. The three of them talked quietly
for a few minutes after that, had a final glass of brandy, then said
good night. George went upstairs, and shortly afterwards he heard Mr.
and Mrs. Reade come softly up and go to their room.</p>

<p>McHarg lay motionless, just as they had left him. He had not stirred
a muscle, but seemed to be sunk in the untroubled sleep of childhood.
George spread another blanket over him. Then he undressed, turned out
the lights, and crawled into his own bed.</p>

<p>He was exhausted, but so excited by all the strange events of the
day that he was beyond the desire for sleep. He lay there thinking over
what had happened and listening to the wind. It would rush at the house
and shiver the windows, then swoop round the corners and the eaves,
howling like a banshee. Somewhere a shutter flapped and banged
insanely. Now and then, in the momentary lulls between the rushes of
the wind, a dog barked mournfully in the faint distance. He heard the
clock in the downstairs hall chime three.</p>

<p>It was some time after that when he finally dropped off. The storm
was still howling like a madman round the house, but he was no longer
aware of it.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="chapter5-37"></a>37. The Morning After</h2>

<p>George lay in merciful and dreamless sleep, as leaden as if he had
GEORGE knocked senseless by a heavy club. How long he had slept he did
not know, but it hardly seemed five minutes when he was awakened
suddenly by someone shaking him by the shoulder. He opened his eyes and
started up. It was McHarg. He stood there in his underwear, prancing
round on his stork-like legs like an impatient sprinter straining at
the mark.</p>

<p>"Get up George, get up!" he cried shrilly. "For Christ's sake, man,
are you going to sleep all day?"</p>

<p>George stared at him dumbfounded. "What--what time is it?" he
managed finally to say.</p>

<p>"It's after eight o'clock," McHarg cried. "I've been up an hour.
Shaved and had a bath, and now," he smacked his bony hands together
with an air of relish and sniffed zestfully at the breakfast-laden air,
"boy, I could eat a horse! Don't you smell it?" he cried gleefully.
"Oatmeal, eggs and bacon, grilled tomatoes, toast and marmalade,
coffee. Ali!" he sighed with reverent enthusiasm. "There's nothing like
an English breakfast. Get up, George, get up!" he cried again with
shrill insistence. "My God, man, I let you sleep a whole hour longer
than I did because you looked as if you needed it! So get your clothes
on! We don't want to keep breakfast waiting!"</p>

<p>George groaned, dragged his legs wearily from the covers, and stood
groggily erect. He felt as if he wanted nothing so much as to sleep for
two days on end. But under the feverish urging of this red fury, he had
nothing left to do except to awake and dress. Like a man in a trance,
he pulled on his clothes with slow, fumbling motions, and all the while
McHarg fumed up and down, demanding every two seconds that he get a
move on and not be all day about it.</p>

<p>When they got downstairs the Reades were already at the table.
McHarg bounced in as if he had a rubber core, greeted both of them
cheerfully, took a seat, and instantly fell to. He put away an enormous
breakfast, talking all the time and crackling with electricity. His
energy was astounding. It was really incredible. It seemed impossible
that the exhausted wreck of a few hours before could now be
miraculously transformed into this dynamo of vitality. He was in
uproarious spirits, and full of stories and adventures. He told
wonderful yarns about the ceremonies at which his degree had been
presented and about all the people there. Then he told about Berlin,
and about people he had met in Germany and in Holland. He told of his
meeting with Mynheer Bendien, and gave a side-splitting account of
their madhouse escapades. He was full of plans and purposes. He asked
about everyone he knew in England. His mind seemed to have a thousand
brilliant facets. He took hold of everything, and whatever he touched
began to crackle with the energy and alertness of his own dynamic
power. He was a delightful companion. George realised that he was now
seeing McHarg at his best, and his best was wonderfully and
magnificently good.</p>

<p>After breakfast they all took a walk together. It was a rare, wild
morning. The temperature had dropped several degrees during the night
and the fitful rain had turned to snow, which was now coming down
steadily, swirling and gusting through the air upon the howling wind
and piling up in soft, fleecy drifts. Overhead, the branches of the
bare trees thrashed about and moaned. The countryside was impossibly
wild and beautiful. They walked long and far, filled with the
excitement of the storm, and with a strange, wild joy and sorrow,
knowing that the magic could not last.</p>

<p>When they came back to the house, they sat beside the fire and
talked together. McHarg's gleeful exuberance of the morning had
subsided, but in its place had come a quiet power--the kind of
Lincolnesque dignity of repose and strength which George had observed
in him the day before. He took out his old silver-rimmed spectacles and
put them on his homely, wry, and curiously engaging face. He read some
letters which he had in his pocket and had not opened, and after that
he talked to his old friend. What they talked about was not important
in itself. What <i>was</i> important, and what George would always
remember, was the way McHarg looked, and the way he sat and talked,
with his bony knuckles arched and clasped before him in an attitude of
unconscious power, and the dignity, wisdom, and deep knowledge of his
speech. Here was a man with greatness in him, a man who was now showing
the basic sources of his latent strength. His speech was full of quiet
affection for his old friend. One felt something unshakable and abiding
in him--a loyalty that would not change, that would remain always the
same, even though he might not see his friend again for twenty
years.</p>

<p>They had a good lunch together. Wine was served, but McHarg partook
sparingly of it. After lunch, to Webber's great relief, McHarg told him
quietly that they were returning to London in the afternoon. He said
nothing about the projected tour of England which he had depicted in
such glowing colours the day before. Whether that had been just a
passing whim, or whether he had given up the idea because he sensed
George's lack of enthusiasm for it, George did not know. McHarg did not
refer to it at all. He merely announced their return to London as a
fact and let it go at that.</p>

<p>But now, as if the thought of going back to the city was more than
he could bear, he immediately underwent another of his astonishing
transformations. Almost at once his manner again became feverish and
impatient. By three o'clock, when they left, he had worked himself into
a state of inflamed distemper. He seemed on edge, like one who wanted
to get some disagreeable business over and done with.</p>

<p>They drove cautiously down the whitened, trackless lane, over which
no car had passed that day, leaving behind them the low-eaved comfort
of that fine old house, now warmly fleeced in its blanket of snow, and
George felt again the almost unbearable sadness that always came to him
when he said good-bye to people whom he knew he would never see again.
The lovely woman stood in the doorway and watched them go, with Reade
beside her, his hands thrust deep in the pockets of his velvet jacket.
As the car took the turn McHarg and George looked back. Reade and his
wife waved, and they waved back, and something tightened in George's
throat. Then they were out of sight. McHarg and George were alone
again.</p>

<p>They reached the high road and turned north and sped onward towards
London. Both men were silent, each absorbed in his own thoughts. McHarg
sat back in his corner, quiet, abstracted, sunk deep into his inner
world. Darkness came, and they said nothing.</p>

<p>And now the lights were up, and there against the sky George saw
again the vast corrupted radiance of the night--the smoke, the fury,
and the welter of London's unending life. And after a little while the
car was threading its way through the jungle warren of that monstrous
sprawl, and at last it turned into Ebury Street and stopped. George got
out and thanked McHarg; they shook hands, exchanged a few words, and
then said good-bye. The little driver shut the door, touched his cap
respectfully, and climbed back into his seat. The big car purred and
drove off smoothly into the darkness.</p>

<p>George stood at the kerb and looked after it until it disappeared.
And he knew that he and McHarg might meet and speak and pass again, but
never as they had in this, their first meeting; for something had begun
which now was finished, and henceforth they would have to take their
separate courses, he to his own ending, McHarg to his--and which to the
better one no man knew.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="book6"></a>BOOK VI. - "I HAVE A THING TO TELL YOU"</h2>

<h3>("Nun Will Ich Ihnen 'Was Sagen")</h3>

<p><i>By spring, when George returned to New York, it seemed to him
that he had his new book almost finished. He took a small apartment
near Stuyvesant Square and buckled down to a steady daily grind to wind
it up. He thought two months more would surely see him through, but he
always fooled himself about time, and it was not till six months later
that he had a manuscript that satisfied him. That is to say, he had a
manuscript that he was willing to turn over to his publisher, for he
was never really satisfied with anything he wrote. There was always
that seemingly unbridgeable gulf between the thing imagined and the
thing accomplished, and he wondered if any writer had ever been able to
look calmly at something he had done and honestly say:</i></p>

<p><i>"This conveys precisely the ideas and feelings I wanted it to
convey--no more, no less. The thing is just right, and cannot be
improved."</i></p>

<p><i>In that sense he was not at all satisfied with his new book. He
knew its faults, knew all the places where it fell short of his
intentions. But he' also knew that he had put into it everything he had
at that stage of his development, and for this reason he was not
ashamed of it. He delivered the bulky manuscript to Fox Edwards, and as
its weight passed from his hands to Fox's he felt as if a load that he
had been carrying for years had been lifted from his mind and
conscience. He was done with it, and he wished to God he could forget
it and never have to see a line of it again.</i></p>

<p><i>That, however, was too much to hope for. Fox read it, told him in
his shy, straight way that it was good, and then made a few
suggestions--for cutting it here, for adding something there, for
rearranging some of the material. George argued hotly with Fox, then
took the manuscript home and went to work on it again and did the
things Fox wanted--not because Fox wanted them, but because he saw that
Fox was right. Two more months went into that. Then there were proofs
to read and correct, and by the time this was done another six weeks
had gone. The better part of a year had passed since his return from
England, but now the job was really finished and he was free at
last.</i></p>

<p><i>Publication was scheduled for the spring of 1936, and as the time
approached he became increasingly apprehensive. When his first book had
come out, wild horses could not have dragged him from New York; he had
wanted to be on hand so he could be sure not to miss anything. He had
waited around, and read all the reviews, and almost camped out in Fox's
office, and had expected from day to day some impossible fulfilment
that never came. Instead, there had been the letters from Libya Hill
and his sickening adventures with the lion hunters. So now he was
gun-shy of publication dates, and he made up his mind to go away this
time--as far as possible away. Although he did not believe there would
be an exact repetition of those earlier experiences, just the same he
was prepared for the worst, and when it happened he was determined not
to be there.</i></p>

<p><i>Suddenly he thought of Germany, and thought of it with intense
longing. Of all the countries he had ever seen, that was the one, after
America, which he like the best, and in which he felt most at home, and
with whose people he had the most natural, instant, and instinctive
sympathy and understanding. It was also the country above all others
whose mystery and magic haunted him. He had been there several times,
and each time its spell over him had been the same. And now, after the
years of labour and exhaustion, the very thought of Germany meant peace
to his soul, and release, and happiness, and the old magic
again.</i></p>

<p><i>So in March, two weeks before the publication of his book, with
Fox at the pier to see him off and reassure him that everything was
going to be all right, he sailed again for Europe.</i></p>

<h2><a name="chapter6-38"></a>38. The Dark Messiah</h2>

<p>George had not been in Germany since 1928 and the early months of
1929, when he had had to spend weeks of slow convalescence in a Munich
hospital after a fight in a beer hall. Before that foolish episode, he
had stayed for a while in a little town in the Black Forest, and he
remembered that there had been great excitement because an election was
being held. The state of politics was chaotic, with a bewildering
number of parties, and the Communists polled a surprisingly large vote.
People were disturbed and anxious, and there seemed to be a sense of
impending calamity in the air.</p>

<p>This time, things were different. Germany had changed.</p>

<p>Ever since 1933, when the change occurred, George had read, first
with amazement, shock, and doubt, then with despair and a leaden
sinking of the heart, all the newspaper accounts of what was going on
in Germany. He found it hard to believe some of the reports. Of course,
there were irresponsible extremists in Germany as elsewhere, and in
times of crisis no doubt they got out of hand, but he thought he knew
Germany and the German people, and on the whole he was inclined to feel
that the true state of affairs had been exaggerated and that things
simply could not be as bad as they were pictured.</p>

<p>And now, on the train from Paris, where he had stopped off for five
weeks, he met some Germans who gave him reassurance. They said there
was no longer any confusion or chaos in politics and government, and no
longer any fear among the people, because everyone was so happy. This
was what George wanted desperately to believe, and he was prepared to
be happy, too. For no man ever went to a foreign land under more
propitious conditions than those which attended his arrival in Germany
early in May, 1936.</p>

<p>It is said that Byron awoke one morning at the age of twenty-four to
find himself famous. George Webber had to wait eleven years longer. He
was thirty-five when he reached Berlin, but it was magic just the same.
Perhaps he was not really very famous, but that didn't matter, because
for the first and last time in his life he felt as if he were. Just
before he left Paris a letter had reached him from Fox Edwards, telling
him that his new book was having a great success in America. Then, too,
his first book had been translated and published in Germany the year
before. The German critics had said tremendous things about it, it had
had a very good sale, and his name was known. When he got to Berlin the
people were waiting for him.</p>

<p>The month of May is wonderful everywhere. It was particularly
wonderful in Berlin that year. Along the streets, in the Tiergarten, in
all the great gardens, and along the Spree Canal the horse-chestnut
trees were in full bloom. The crowds sauntered underneath the trees on
the Kurf&uuml;rstendamm, the terraces of the caf&eacute;s were jammed
with people, and always, through the golden sparkle of the days, there
was a sound of music in the air. George saw the chains of endlessly
lovely lakes around Berlin, and for the first time he knew the
wonderful golden bronze upon the tall poles of the kiefern-trees.
Before, he had visited only the south of Germany, the Rhinelands and
Bavaria; now the north seemed even more enchanting.</p>

<p>He planned to stay all summer, and one summer seemed too short a
time to encompass all the beauty, magic, and almost intolerable joy
which his life had suddenly become, and which he felt would never fade
or tarnish if only he could remain in Germany for ever. For, to cap it
all, his second book was translated and brought out within a short time
of his arrival, and its reception exceeded anything he had ever dared
to hope for. Perhaps his being there at the time may have had something
to do with it. The German critics outdid each other in singing his
praises. If one called him "the great American epic writer", the next
seemed to feel he had to improve on that, and called hiti "the American
Homer". So now everywhere he went there were people who knew his work.
His name flashed and shone. He was a famous man.</p>

<p>Fame shed a portion of her loveliness on everything about him. Life
took on an added radiance. The look, feel, taste, smell, and sound of
everything had gained a tremendous and exciting enhancement, and all
because Fame was at his side. He saw the world with a sharper relish of
perception than he had ever known before. All the confusion, fatigue,
dark doubt, and bitter hopelessness that had afflicted him in times
past had gone, and no shadow of any kind remained. It seemed to him
that he had won a final and utterly triumphant victory over all the
million forms of life. His spirit was no longer tormented, exhausted,
and weighted down with the ceaseless effort of his former struggles
with Amount and Number. He was wonderfully aware of everything, alive
in every pore.</p>

<p>Fame even gave a tongue to silence, a language to unuttered speech.
Fame was with him almost all the time, but even when he was alone
without her, in places where he was not known and his name meant
nothing, the aura which Fame had shed still clung to him and he was
able to meet each new situation with a sense of power and confidence,
of warmth, friendliness, and good fellowship. He had become the lord of
life. There had been a time in his youth when be felt that people were
always laughing at him, and he had been ill at ease with strangers and
had gone to every new encounter with a chip on his shoulder. But now he
was life's strong and light-hearted master, and everyone he met and
talked to--writers, taxi-drivers, porters in hotels, elevator boys,
casual acquaintances in trams and trains and on the street--felt at
once the flood of happy and affectionate power within him, and
responded to him eagerly, instinctively, with instant natural liking,
as men respond to the clean and shining light of the young sun.</p>

<p>And when Fame was with him, all this magic was increased. He could
see the wonder, interest, respect, and friendly envy in the eyes of
men, and the frank adoration in the eyes of women. The women seemed to
worship at the shrine of Fame. George began to get letters and
telephone calls from them, with invitations to functions of every sort.
The girls were after him. But he had been through all of that before
and he was wary now, for he knew that the lion hunters were the same
the whole world over. Knowing them now for what they were, he found no
disillusion in his encounters with them. Indeed, it added greatly to
his pleasure and sense of power to turn the tactics of designing
females on themselves: he would indulge in little gallantries to lead
them on, and then, just at the point where they thought they had him,
he would wriggle innocently off the hook and leave them wondering.</p>

<p>And then he met Else. Else von Kohler was not a lion hunter. George
met her at one of the parties which his German publisher, Karl Lewald,
gave for him. Lewald liked to give parties; he just couldn't do enough
for George, and was always trumping up an excuse for another party.
Else did not know Lewald, and took an instinctive dislike to the man as
soon as she saw him, but just the same she had come to his party,
brought there uninvited by another man whom George had met. At first
sight, George fell instantly in love with her, and she with him.</p>

<p>Else was a young widow of thirty who looked and was a perfect type
of the Norse Valkyrie. She had a mass of lustrous yellow hair braided
about her head, and her cheeks were two ruddy apples. She was extremely
tall for a woman, with the long, rangy legs of a runner, and her
shoulders were as broad and wide as a man's. Yet she had a stunning
figure, and there was no suggestion of an ugly masculinity about her.
She was as completely and as passionately feminine as a woman could be.
Her somewhat stern and lonely face was relieved by its spiritual depth
and feeling, and when it was lighted by a smile it had a sudden,
poignant radiance, a quality of illumination which in its intensity and
purity was different from any other smile George had ever seen.</p>

<p>At the moment of their first meeting, George and Else had been drawn
to each other. From then on, without the need of any period of
transition, their lives flowed in a single channel. They spent many
wonderful days together. Many too, were the nights which they filled
with the mysterious enchantments of a strong and mutually shared
passion. The girl became for George the ultimate reality underlying
everything he thought and felt and was during that glorious and
intoxicating period of his life.</p>

<p>And now all the blind and furious Brooklyn years, all the years of
work, all the memories of men who prowled in garbage cans, all the
years of wandering and exile, seemed very far away. In some strange
fashion, the image of his own success and this joyous release after so
much toil and desperation became connected in George's mind with Else,
with the kiefern-trees, with the great crowds thronging the
Kurf&uuml;rstendamm, with all the golden singing in the air--and
somehow with a feeling that for everyone grim weather was behind and
that happy days were here again.</p>

<p>It was the season of the great Olympic games, and almost every day
George and Else went to the stadium in Berlin. George observed that the
organising genius of the German people, which has been used so often to
such noble purpose, was now more thrillingly displayed than he had ever
seen it before. The sheer pageantry of the occasion was overwhelming,
so much so that he began to feel oppressed by it. There seemed to be
something ominous in it. One sensed a stupendous concentration of
effort, a tremendous drawing together and ordering in the vast
collective power of the whole land. And the thing that made it seem
ominous was that it so evidently went beyond what the games themselves
demanded. The games were overshadowed, and were no longer merely
sporting competitions to which other nations had sent their chosen
teams. They became, day after day, an orderly and overwhelming
demonstration in which the whole of Germany had been schooled and
disciplined. It was as if the games had been chosen as a symbol of the
new collective might, a means of showing to the world in concrete terms
what this new power had come to be.</p>

<p>With no past experience in such affairs, the Germans had constructed
a mighty stadium which was the most beautiful and most perfect in its
design that had ever been built. And all the accessories of this
monstrous plant--the swimming pools, the enormous halls, the lesser
stadia--had been laid out and designed with this same cohesion of
beauty and of use. The organisation was superb. Not only were the
events themselves, down to the minutest detail of each competition,
staged and run off like clockwork, but the crowds--such crowds as no
other great city has ever had to cope with, and the like of which would
certainly have snarled and maddened the traffic of New York beyond hope
of untangling--were handled with a quietness, order, and speed that was
astounding.</p>

<p>The daily spectacle was breath-taking in its beauty and
magnificence. The stadium was a tournament of colour that caught the
throat; the massed splendour of the banners made the gaudy decorations
of America's great parades, presidential inaugurations, and World's
Fairs seem like shoddy carnivals in comparison. And for the duration of
the Olympics, Berlin itself was transformed into a kind of annex to the
stadium. From one end of the city to the other, from the Lustgarten to
the Brandenburger Tor, along the whole broad sweep of Unter den Linden,
through the vast avenues of the faery Tiergarten, and out through the
western part of Berlin to the very portals of the stadium, the whole
town was a thrilling pageantry of royal banners--not merely endless
miles of looped-up bunting, but banners fifty feet in height, such as
might have graced the battle tent of some great emperor.</p>

<p>And all through the day, from morning on, Berlin became a mighty
Ear, attuned, attentive, focused on the stadium. Everywhere the air was
filled with a single voice. The green trees along the
Kurf&uuml;rstendamm began to talk: from loud-speakers concealed in
their branches an announcer in the stadium spoke to the whole city--and
for George Webber it was a strange experience to hear the familiar
terms of track and field translated into the tongue that Goethe used.
He would be informed now that the <i>Vorlauf</i> was about to be
run--and then the <i>Zwischenlauf</i>--and at length the
<i>Endlauf</i>--and the winner:</p>

<p>"Owens--Oo Ess Ah!"</p>

<p>Meanwhile, through those tremendous banner-laden ways, the crowds
thronged ceaselessly all day long. The wide promenade of Unter den
Linden was solid with patient, tramping German feet. Fathers, mothers,
children, young folks, old--the whole material of the nation was there,
from every corner of the land. From morn to night they trudged,
wide-eyed, full of wonder, past the marvel of those banner-laden ways.
And among them one saw the bright stabs of colour of Olympic jackets
and the glint of foreign faces: the dark features of Frenchmen and
Italians, the ivory grimace of the Japanese, the straw hair and blue
eyes of the Swedes, and the big Americans, natty in straw hats, white
flannels, and blue coats crested with the Olympic seal.</p>

<p>And there were great displays of marching men, sometimes ungunned
but rhythmic as regiments of brown shirts went swinging through the
streets. By noon each day all the main approaches to the games, the
embannered streets and avenues of the route which the Leader would take
to the stadium, miles away, were walled in by the troops. They stood at
ease, young men, laughing and talking with each other--the Leader's
bodyguards, the Schutz Staffel units, the Storm Troopers, all the ranks
and divisions in their different uniforms--and they stretched in two
unbroken lines from the Wilhelm-strasse up to the arches of the
Brandenburger Tor. Then, suddenly, the sharp command, and instantly
there would be the solid smack of ten thousand leather boots as they
came together with the sound of war.</p>

<p>It seemed as if everything had been planned for this moment, shaped
to this triumphant purpose. But the people--they had not been planned.
Day after day, behind the unbroken wall of soldiers, they stood and
waited in a dense and patient throng. These were the masses of the
nation, the poor ones of the earth, the humble ones of life, the
workers and the wives, the mothers and the children--and day after day
they came and stood and waited. They were there sa because they did not
have money enough to buy the little cardboard squares that would have
given them places within the magic ring. From noon till night they
waited for just two brief and golden moments of the day: the moment
when the Leader went out to the stadium, and the moment when he
returned.</p>

<p>At last he came--and something like a wind across a field of grass
was shaken through that crowd, and from afar the tide rolled up with
him, and in it was the voice, the hope, the prayer of the land. The
Leader came by slowly in a shining car, a little dark man with a
comic-opera moustache, erect and standing, moveless and unsmiling, with
his hand upraised, palm outward, not in Nazi-wise salute, but straight
up, in a gesture of blessing such as the Buddha or Messiahs use.</p>

<p>From the beginning of their relationship, and straight through to
the end, Else refused to discuss with George anything even remotely
connected with the Nazi regime. That was a closed subject between them.
But others were not so discreet. The first weeks passed, and George
began to hear some ugly things. From time to time, at parties, dinners,
and the like, when George would speak of his enthusiasm for Germany and
the German people, various friends that he had made would, if they had
had enough to drink, take him aside afterwards and, after looking round
cautiously, lean towards him with an air of great secrecy and
whisper:</p>

<p>"But have you heard...? And have you heard...?"</p>

<p>He did not see any of the ugly things they whispered about. He did
not see anyone beaten. He did not see anyone imprisoned, or put to
death. He did not see any men in concentration camps. He did not see
openly anywhere the physical manifestations of a brutal and compulsive
force.</p>

<p>True, there were men in brown uniforms everywhere, and men in black
uniforms, and men in uniforms of olive green, and everywhere in the
streets there was the solid smack of booted feet, the blare of brass,
the tootling of fifes, and the poignant sight of young faces shaded
under iron helmets, with folded arms and ramrod backs, precisely seated
in great army lorries. But all of this had become so mixed in with his
joy over his own success, his feeling for Else, and the genial temper
of the people making holiday, as he had seen and known it so many
pleasant times before, that even if it did not now seem good, it did
not seem sinister or bad.</p>

<p>Then something happened. It didn't happen suddenly. It just happened
as a cloud gathers, as fog settles, as rain begins to fall.</p>

<p>A man George had met was planning to give a party for him and asked
him it he wanted to ask any of his friends. George mentioned one. His
host was silent for a moment; he looked embarrassed; then he said that
the person George had named had formerly been the editorial head of a
publication that had been suppressed, and that one of the people who
had been instrumental in its suppression had been invited to the party,
so would George mind--?</p>

<p>George named another, an old friend named Franz Heilig whom he had
first met in Munich years before, and who now lived in Berlin, and of
whom he was very fond. Again the anxious pause, the embarrassment, the
halting objections. This person was--waswell, George's host said he
knew about this person and knew he did not go to parties--he would not
come if he were invited--so would George mind----?</p>

<p>George next spoke the name of Else von Kohler, and the response to
this suggestion was of the same kind. How long had he known this woman?
Where, and under what circumstances, had he met her? George tried to
reassure his host on all these scores. He told the man he need have no
fear of any sort about Else. His host was instant, swift, in his
apologies: oh, by no means--he was sure the lady was eminently all
right--only, nowadays--with a mixed gathering--he had tried to pick a
group of people whom George had met and who all knew one another--he
had thought it would be much more pleasant that way--strangers at a
party were often shy, constrained, and formal--Frau von Kohler would
not know anybody there--so would George mind----?</p>

<p>Not long after this baffling experience a friend came to see him.
"In a few days," his friend said, "you will receive a phone call from a
certain person. He will try to meet you, to talk to you. Have nothing
to do with this man."</p>

<p>George laughed. His friend was a sober-minded German, rather on the
dull and heavy side, and his face was so absurdly serious as he spoke
that George thought he was trying to play some lumbering joke upon him.
He wanted to know who this mysterious personage might be who was so
anxious to make his acquaintance.</p>

<p>To George's amazement and incredulity, his friend named a high
official in the government.</p>

<p>But why, George asked, should this man want to meet him? And why, if
he did, should he be afraid of him?</p>

<p>At first his friend would not answer. Finally he muttered
circumspectly:</p>

<p>"Listen to me. Stay away from this man. I tell you for your own
good." He paused, not knowing how to say it; then: "You have heard of
Captain Roehm? You know about him? You know what happened to him?"
George nodded. "Well," his friend went on in a troubled voice, "there
were others who were not shot in the purge. This man I speak of is one
of the bad ones. We have a name for him--it is 'The Prince of
Darkness'."</p>

<p>George did not know what to make of all this. He tried to puzzle it
out but could not, so at last he dismissed it from his mind. But within
a few days the official whom his friend had named did telephone, and
did ask to meet him. George offered some excuse and avoided seeing the
man, but the episode was most peculiar and unsettling.</p>

<p>Both of these baffling experiences contained elements of comedy and
melodrama, but those were the superficial aspects. George began to
realise now the tragedy that lay behind such things. There was nothing
political in any of it. The roots of it were much more sinister and
deep and evil than politics or even racial prejudice could ever be. For
the first time in his life he had come upon something full of horror
that he had never known before--something that made all the swift
violence and passion of America, the gangster compacts, the sudden
killings, the harshness and corruption that infested portions of
American business and public life, seem innocent beside it. What George
began to see was a picture of a great people who had been psychically
wounded and were now desperately ill with some dread malady of the
soul. Here was an entire nation, he now realised, that was infested
with the contagion of an ever-present fear. It was a kind of creeping
paralysis which twisted and blighted all human relations. The pressures
of a constant and infamous compulsion had silenced this whole people
into a sweltering and malignant secrecy until they had become
spiritually septic with the distillations of their own self-poisons,
for which now there was no medicine or release.</p>

<p>As he began to see and understand the true state of affairs, George
wondered if anyone could be so base as to exult at this great tragedy,
or to feel hatred for the once-mighty people who were the victims of
it. Culturally, from the eighteenth century on, the German was the
first citizen of Europe. In Goethe there was made sublimely articulate
a world spirit which knew no boundary lines of nationality, politics,
race, or religion, which rejoiced in the inheritance of all mankind,
and which wanted no domination or conquest of that inheritance save
that of participating in it and contributing to it. This German spirit
in art, literature, music, science, and philosophy continued in an
unbroken line right down to 1933, and it seemed to George that there
was not a man or woman alive in the world who was not, in one way or
another, the richer for it.</p>

<p>When he first visited Germany, in 1925, the evidence of that spirit
was manifest everywhere in the most simple and unmistakable ways. For
example, one could not pass the crowded window of a bookshop in any
town without instantly observing in it a reflection of the intellectual
and cultural enthusiasm of the German people. The contents of the shop
revealed a breadth of vision and of interest that would have made the
contents of a French bookshop, with its lingual and geographic
constrictions, seem paltry and provincial. The best writers of every
country were as well known in Germany as in their own land. Among the
Americans, Theodore Dreiser, Sinclair Lewis, Upton Sinclair, and Jack
London had particularly large followings; their books were sold and
read everywhere. And the work of America's younger writers was eagerly
sought out and published.</p>

<p>Even in 1936 this noble enthusiasm, although it had been submerged
and mutilated by the regime of Adolf Hitler, was still apparent in the
most touching way. George had heard it said that good books could no
longer be published and read in Germany. This, he found, was not true,
as some of the other things he had heard about Germany were not true.
And about Hitler's Germany he felt that one must be very true. And the
reason one needed to be very true was that the thing in it which every
decent person must be against was false. You could not turn the other
cheek to wrong, but also, it seemed to him, you could not be wrong
about wrong. You had to be right about it. You could not meet lies and
trickery with lies and trickery, although there were some people who
argued that you should.</p>

<p>So it was not true that good books could no longer be published and
read in Germany. And because it was not true, the tragedy of the great
German spirit was more movingly evident, in the devious and distorted
ways in which it now manifested itself, than it would have been if it
were true. Good books were still published if their substance did not,
either openly or by implication, criticise the Hitler regime or
contravert its dogmas. And it would simply be stupid to assert that any
book must criticise Hitler and contravert his doctrines in order to be
good.</p>

<p>For these reasons, the eagerness, curiosity, and enthusiasm of the
Germans for such good books as they were still allowed to read had been
greatly intensified. They wanted desperately to find out what was going
on in the world, and the only way they had left was to read whatever
books they could get that had been written outside of Germany. This
seemed to be one basic explanation of their continued interest in
American writing, and that they were interested was a fact as
overwhelming as it was pathetic. Under these conditions, the last
remnants of the German spirit managed to survive only as drowning men
snrvive--by clutching desperately at any spar that floated free from
the wreckage of their ship.</p>

<p>So the weeks, the months, the summer passed, and everywhere about
him George saw the evidences of this dissolution, this shipwreck of a
great spirit. The poisonous emanations of suppression, persecution, and
fear permeated the air like miasmic and pestilential vapours, tainting,
sickening, and blighting the lives of everyone he met. It was a plague
of the spirit--invisible, but as unmistakable as death. Little by
little it sank in on him through all the golden singing of that summer,
until at last he felt it, breathed it, lived it, and knew it for the
thing it was.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="chapter6-39"></a>39. "One Big Fool"</h2>

<p>The time had come for George to go. He knew he had to leave, but he
had kept putting it off. Twice he had booked his passage back to
America and made all his preparations for departure, and twice, as the
day approached, he had cancelled the arrangements.</p>

<p>He hated the thought of quitting Germany, for he felt, somehow, that
he would never again be able to return to this ancient land he loved so
much. And Else--where, and under what alien skies, could he hope to see
her again? Her roots were here, his were elsewhere. This would be a
last farewell.</p>

<p>So, after delaying and delaying, once more he booked his passage and
made his plans to leave Berlin on a day towards the middle of
September. The postponement of the dreaded moment had only made it more
painful. He would be foolish to draw it out any further. This time he
would really go.</p>

<p>And at last came the fateful dawn.</p>

<p>The phone beside his bed rang quietly. He stirred, then roused
sharply from that fitful and uneasy sleep which a man experiences when
he has gone to bed late, knowing that he has to get up early. It was
the porter. His low, quiet voice had in it the quality of immediate
authority.</p>

<p>"It is seven 'o'clock," he said.</p>

<p>"All right," George answered. "Thank you. I'm awake."</p>

<p>Then he got up, still fighting dismally with a stale fatigue which
begged for sleep, as well as with a gnawing tension of anxiety which
called for action. One look about the room reassured him. His old
leather trunk lay open on the baggage rest. It had been packed the
night before with beautiful efficiency by the maid. Now there was very
little more to do except to shave and dress, stow toilet things away,
pack the brief-case with a few books and letters and the pages of
manuscript that always accumulated wherever he was, and drive to the
station. Twenty minutes' steady work would find him ready. The train
was not due until half-past eight, and the station was not three
minutes distant in a taxi-cab. He thrust his feet into his slippers,
walked over to the windows, tugged the cord, and pulled up the heavy
wooden blinds.</p>

<p>It was a grey morning. Below him, save for an occasional motorcar,
the quiet thrum of a bicycle, or someone walking briskly to his work
with a lean, spare clack of early morning, the Kurf&uuml;rstendamm was
bare and silent. In the centre of the street, above the tram tracks,
the fine trees had already lost their summer freshness--that deep and
dark intensity of German green which is the greenest green on earth and
which has a kind of forest darkness, a legendary sense of coolness and
of magic. The leaves looked faded now, and dusty. They were already
touched here and there by the yellowing tinge of autumn. A tram,
cream-yellow, spotless, shining like a perfect toy, slid past with a
hissing sound upon the rails and at the contacts of the trolley. Except
for this, the tram-car made no noise. Like everything the Germans
built, the tram and its road-bed were perfect in their function. The
rattling and metallic clatter of an American street-car were totally
absent. Even the little cobble-stones that paved the space between the
tracks were as clean and spotless as if each of them had just been gone
over thoroughly with a whisk broom, and the strips of grass that
bordered the tracks were as green and velvety as Oxford sward.</p>

<p>On both sides of the street, the great restaurants, caf&eacute;s,
and terraces of the Kurf&uuml;rstendamm had the silent loneliness that
such places always have at that hour of the morning. Chairs were racked
upon the tables. Everything was clean and bare and empty. Three blocks
away, at the head of the street, the clock on the
Ged&auml;chtnis-kirche belatedly struck seven times. He could see the
great, bleak masses of the church, and in the trees a few birds
sang.</p>

<p>Someone knocked upon the door. He turned and crossed and opened it.
The waiter stood there with his breakfast tray. He was a boy of
fifteen, a blond-haired, solemn child with a fresh pink face. He wore a
boiled shirt, and a waiter's uniform which was spotless-clean, but
which had obviously been cut off and shortened down a little from the
dimensions of some more mature former inhabitant. He marched in
solemnly, bearing his tray before him straight towards the table in the
centre of the room, stolidly uttering in a guttural and toneless voice
his three phrases of English which were:</p>

<p>"Goot morning, sir," as George opened the door</p>

<p>"If you bleeze, sir," as he set the tray down upon the table, and
then</p>

<p>"Dank you ferry much, sir," as he marched out and turned to close
the door behind him.</p>

<p>The formula had always been the same. All summer it had not varied
by a jot, and now as he marched out for the last time George had a
feeling of affection and regret. He called to the boy to wait a moment,
got his trousers, took some money, and gave it to him. His pink face
reddened suddenly with happiness. George shook hands with him, and the
boy said gutturally:</p>

<p>"Dank you ferry much, sir." And then, very quietly and earnestly:
"<i>Gute reise, mein Herr.</i>" He clicked his heels together and bowed
formally, and then closed the door.</p>

<p>George stood there for a moment with that nameless feeling of
affection and regret, knowing that he would never see the boy again.
Then he went back to the table and poured out a cup of the hot, rich
chocolate, broke a crusty roll, buttered it, spread it with strawberry
jam, and ate it. This was all the breakfast he wanted. The pot was
still half full of chocolate, the dish was still piled with little
scrolls of creamy butter, there was enough of the delicious jam, enough
of the crusty rolls and flaky croissants, to make half a dozen
breakfasts, but he was not hungry.</p>

<p>He went over to the wash-basin and switched on the light. The large
and heavy porcelain bowl was indented in the wall. The wall and the
floor beneath were substantial and as perfect as a small but costly
bathroom. He brushed his teeth and shaved, packed all the toilet things
together in a little leather case, pulled the zipper, and put it away
in the old trunk. Then he dressed. By seven-twenty he was ready.</p>

<p>Franz Heilig came in as George was ringing for the porter. He was an
astonishing fellow, an old friend of the Munich days, and George was
devoted to him.</p>

<p>When they had first met, Heilig had been a librarian in Munich. Now
he had a post in one of the large libraries of Berlin. In this capacity
he was a public functionary, with the prospect of slow but steady
advancement through the years. His income was small and his scale of
living modest, but such things did not bother Heilig. He was a scholar,
with the widest range of knowledge and interests that George had ever
known in anyone. He read and spoke a dozen languages. He was German to
the very core of his learned soul, but his English, which he spoke less
well than any other language he had studied, was not the usual German
rendering of Shakespeare's tongue. There were plenty of Germanic
elements in it, but in addition Heilig had also borrowed accents and
inflections from some of his other linguistic conquests, and the result
was a most peculiar and amusing kind of bastard speech.</p>

<p>As he entered the room and saw George he began to laugh, closing his
eyes, contorting his small features, and snuffling through his sourly
puckered lips as if he had just eaten a half-ripe persimmon. Then his
face went sober and he said anxiously:</p>

<p>"You are ready, zen? You are truly going?"</p>

<p>George nodded. "Yes," he said. "Everything's all ready. How do you
feel, Franz?"</p>

<p>He laughed suddenly, took off his spectacles, and began to polish
them. Without his glasses, his small puckered face had a tired and worn
look, and his weak eyes were bloodshot and weary from the night
before.</p>

<p>"0 Gott!" he cried, with a kind of gleeful desperation. "I feel
perfectly <i>dret-ful</i>! I haf not efen been to bett! After I left
you I could not sleep. I valked and valked, almost up to
Grunewald...May I tell you somesing?" he said earnestly, and peered at
George with the serious intensity with which he always uttered these
oracular words. "I feel like hell--I really do."</p>

<p>"Then you haven't been to bed at all? You've had no sleep?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," he said wearily. "I haf slept an hour. I came back home.
My girl vas asleep--I did not vant to get into ze bett wiz her--I did
not vant to vake her up. So I laid down upon ze couch. I did not efen
take off my clothes. I vas afraid zat I vould come too late to see you
at ze station. And zat," he said, peering at George most earnestly
again, "vould be too dret-ful!"</p>

<p>"Why don't you go back home and sleep to-day after the train goes?"
George said. "I don't think you'll be able to do much work, feeling as
you do. Wouldn't it be better if you took the day off and caught up on
your sleep?"</p>

<p>"Veil, zen," said Heilig abruptly, yet rather indifferently, "I vill
tell you somesing." He peered at George earnestly and intently again,
and said: "It does not matter. It really does not matter. I vill take
somesing--some coffee or somesing," he said indifferently. "It vill not
be too bad. But Gott!"--again the desperately gleeful laugh--"how I
shall sleep to-night! After zat I shall try to get to know my girl
again."</p>

<p>"I hope so, Franz. She's a nice girl. I'm afraid she hasn't seen
much of you the last month or so."</p>

<p>"Veil, zen," said Heilig, as before, "I vill tell you somesing. It
does not matter. It really does not matter. She is a good girl--she
knows about zese sings--you like her, yes?"--and he peered at George
eagerly, earnestly, again. "You sink she is nice?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think she's very nice."</p>

<p>"Veil, zen," said Heilig, "I vill tell you somesing. She is very
nice. I am glad if you like her. She is very good for me. Ve get along
togezzer very vell. I hope zat zey vill let me keep her," he said
quietly.</p>

<p>"They? Who do you mean by 'they', Franz?"</p>

<p>"Oh," he said, wearily, and his small face puckered in an expression
of disgust, "zese people--zese stupid people--zat you know about."</p>

<p>"But good Lord, Franz! Surely they have not yet forbidden that, have
they? A man is still allowed to have a girl, isn't he? Why you can step
right out into the Kurf&uuml;rstendamm and get a dozen girls before
you've walked a block."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Heilig, "you mean ze little whores. Yes, you may still go
to ze little whores. Zat's quite anozzer matter. You may go to ze
little whores and perhaps zey give you somesing--a little poison. But
zat is quite all right. You see, my dear shap," here his face puckered
in a look of impish malice, and he began to speak in the tone of
exaggerated and mincing refinement that characterised some of his more
vicious utterances, "I vill now tell you somesing. Under <i>ze Dritte
Reich</i> ve are all so happy, everysing is so fine and healsy, zat it
is perfectly Gott-tam dret-ful," he sneered. "Ve may go to ze little
whores in ze Kurf&uuml;rstendamm. Zey vill take you to zeir rooms, or
zey vill come wiz you. Yes," he said earnestly, nodding, "zey vill come
wiz you to vhere you live--to your room. But you cannot haf a girl. If
you haf a girl you must marry her, and--may I tell you?" he said
frankly--"I cannot marry. I do not make enough money. It vould be quite
impossible!" he said decisively. "And may I tell you zis?" he
continued, pacing nervously up and down and taking rapid puffs at his
cigarette. "If you haf a girl, zen you must haf two rooms. And zat also
is quite impossible! I haf not efen money enough to afford two
rooms."</p>

<p>"You mean, if you are living with a girl you are compelled by law to
have two rooms?"</p>

<p>"It is ze law, yes," said Heilig quietly, nodding with the air of
finality with which a German states established custom. "You must. If
you are liffing wiz a girl, she must haf a room. Zen you can say," he
went on seriously, "zat you are hiring wiz each ozzer. She may haf a
room right next to you, but zen you can say zat she is not your girl.
You may sleep togezzer every night, all you Gott-tam please. But zen,
you see, you vill be good. You vill not do some sings against ze
Party...Gott!" he cried, and, lifting his impish, bitterly puckered
face, he laughed again. "It is all quite dret-ful!"</p>

<p>"But if they find, Franz, that you're living with her in a single
room?"</p>

<p>"Veil, zen," he said quietly, "I may tell you zat she vill haf to
go." And then, wearily, dismissingly, in a tone of bitter indifference:
"It does not matter. I do not care. I pay no attention to zese stupid
people. I haf my vork, I haf my girl. And zat is all zat matters. Ven I
am finished wiz my vork, I go home to my little room. My girl is zere,
and zis little dog," he said, and his face lighted up gleefully again.
"Zis little dog--may I tell you somesing?--zis little dog--Pooki--ze
little Scottie zat you know--I haf become quite fond of him. He is
really quite nice," said Heilig earnestly. "Ven he first came to us I
hated him. My girl saw him and she fall in love wiz zis little animal,"
said Heilig. "She said zat she must haf him--zat I must be buying him
for her. Veil, zen," said Heilig, quickly flipping the ash from his
cigarette and moving up and down the room, "I said to her zat I vill
not haf zis Gott-tam little beast about my place." He fairly shouted
these words to show the emphasis of his intention. "Veil, zen, ze girl
cry. She talk alvays about zis little dog. She say zat she must haf
him, zat she is going to die. Gott!" he cried gleefully again, and
laughed. "It vas perfectly dret-ful. Zere vas no more peace for me. I
vould go home at night and instantly she vould begin to cry and say she
vill be dying if I do not buy zis little dog. So finally I say: 'All
right, haf it your own vay. I vill buy zis little animal!'" he said
viciously--"'Only for Gott's sake, shut your crying!' So, zen," said
Heilig impishly, "I vent to buy zis little dog, and I looked at him."
Here his voice became very droll, and with a tremendous sense of comic
exaggeration his eyes narrowed, his small face puckered to a grimace,
and his discoloured teeth gritted together as he snarled softly and
gleefully: "I looked at zis little dog and I said--'All right,
you--you-u-u buh-loody little animalyou-u-u aww-ful--dret-ful--little
bee-e-e-st--I vill take you home wiz me--but you--you-u-u damned little
beast, you'"--here he gleefully and viciously shook his fist at an
imaginary dog--"'if you do some sings I do not like--if you viii be
making some buh-loody awful messes in my place, I vill give you
somesing to eat zat you will not enchoy'...But zen," said Heilig,
"after ve had him, I became quite fond of him. He is quite nice,
really. Sometime ven I come home at night and everysing has gone badly
and zere haf been so many of zese dret-ful people, he vill come and
look at me. He vill talk to me. He vill say he knows zat I am so
unhappy. And zat life is very hard. But zat he is my friend. Yes, he is
really very nice. I like him very much."</p>

<p>During this conversation the porter had come in and was now waiting
for his orders. He asked George if everything was in the leather trunk.
George got down on hands and knees and took a final look under the bed.
The porter opened doors and drawers. Heilig himself peered inside the
big wardrobe and, finding it empty, turned to George with his
characteristic expression of surprise and said:</p>

<p>"Veil, zen, I may tell you zat I sink you have it all."</p>

<p>Satisfied on this score, the porter closed the heavy trunk, locked
it, and tightened the straps, while Heilig helped George stuff
manuscripts, letters, and a few books into the old brief-case. Then
George fastened the brief-case and gave it to the porter. He dragged
the baggage out into the hall and said he would wait for them
below.</p>

<p>George looked at his watch and found that it still lacked
three-quarters of an hour until train time. He asked Heilig if they
should go on immediately to the station or wait at the hotel.</p>

<p>"Ve can vait here," he said. "I sink it vould be better. If you vait
here anozzer half an hour, zere vould still be time."</p>

<p>He offered George a cigarette and struck a match for him. Then they
sat down, George at the table, Heilig upon the couch against the wall.
And for a minute or two they smoked in silence.</p>

<p>"Vell, zen," said Heilig quietly, "zis time it is to be
good-bye...Zis time you vill really go?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Franz. I've got to go this time. I've missed two boats
already. I can't miss another one."</p>

<p>They smoked in silence for a moment more, and then suddenly,
earnestly and anxiously, Heilig said:</p>

<p>"Vell, zen, may I tell you somesing? I am sorry."</p>

<p>"And I, too, Franz."</p>

<p>Again they smoked in troubled and uneasy silence.</p>

<p>"You vill come back, of gourse," said Heilig presently. And then,
decisively: "You must, of gourse. Ve like you here." Another pause,
then very simply and quietly: "You know, ve do so luff you."</p>

<p>George was too moved to say anything, and Heilig, peering at him
quickly and anxiously, continued:</p>

<p>"And you like it here? You like us? Yes!" he cried emphatically, in
answer to his own question. "Of gourse you do!"</p>

<p>"Of course, Franz."</p>

<p>"Zen you must come back," he said quietly. "It vould be quite
dret-ful if you did not." He looked at George searchingly again, but
George said nothing. In a moment Heilig said: "And I--I shall hope zat
ve shall meet again."</p>

<p>"I hope so, too, Franz," said George. And then, trying to throw off
the sadness that had fallen on them, he went on as cheerfully as he
could, voicing his desire more than his belief: "Of course we shall. I
shall come back some day, and we shall sit together talking just the
same as we are now."</p>

<p>Heilig did not answer immediately. His small face became contorted
with the look of bitter and malicious humour which George had seen upon
it so often. He took off his glasses quickly, polished them, wiped his
tired, weak eyes, and put his glasses on again.</p>

<p>"You sink so?" he said, and smiled his wry and bitter smile.</p>

<p>"I'm sure of it," George said positively, and for the moment he
almost believed it. "You and I and all the friends we know--we'll sit
together drinking, we'll stay up all night and dance around the trees
and go to Aenna Maentz at three o'clock in the morning for chicken
soup. All of it will be the same."</p>

<p>"Vell, zen, I hope zat you are right. But I am not so sure," said
Heilig quietly. "I may not be here."</p>

<p>"You!" George laughed derisively. "Why what are you talking about?
You know you wouldn't be happy anywhere else. You have your work, it's
what you always wanted to do, and at last you're in the place where you
always wanted to be. Your future is mapped out clearly before you--it's
just a matter of hanging on until your superiors die off or retire.
You'll always be here!"</p>

<p>"I am not so sure," he said. He puffed at his cigarette, and then
continued rather hesitantly. "You see--zere are zese fools--zese stupid
people!" He ground his cigarette out viciously in the ashtray, and, his
face twisted in a wry smile of defiant, lacerated pride, he cried
angrily: "Myself--I do not care. I do not vorry for myself. Right now I
haf my little life--my little chob--my little girl--my little room.
Zese people--zese fools!" he cried--"I do not notice zem. I do not see
zem. It does not bozzer me," he cried. And now, indeed, his face had
become a grotesque mask. "I shall always get along," he said. "If zey
run me out--yell, zen, I may tell you zat I do not care! Zere are ozzer
places!" he cried bitterly. "I can go to England, to Sveden. If zey
take my chob, my girl," he cried scornfully and waved his hand
impatiently, "may I tell you zat it does not matter. I shall get along.
And if zese fools--zese stupid people--if zey take my life--I do not
sink zat is so terrible. You sink so? Yes?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do think so, Franz. I should not like to die."</p>

<p>"Vell, zen," said Heilig quietly, "wiz you it is a different matter.
You are American. Wiz us, it is not ze same. I haf seen men shot, in
Munich, in Vienna--I do not sink it is too bad." He turned and looked
searchingly at George again. "No, it is not too bad," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh hell, you're talking like an idiot," George said. "No one's
going to shoot you. No one's going to take your job or girl away. Why,
man, your job is safe. It has nothing to do with politics. And they'd
never find another scholar like you. Why, they couldn't do without
you."</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders indifferently and cynically. "I do not
know," he said. "Myself--I think ye can do wizout everybody if ye must.
And perhaps ye must."</p>

<p>"Must? What do you mean by that, Franz?"</p>

<p>Heilig did not answer for a moment. Then he said abruptly: "Now I
sink zat I vill tell you somesing. In ze last year here, zese fools haf
become quite dret-ful. All ze Chews haf been taken from zeir vork, zey
haf nozzing to do any more. Zese people come around--some stupid people
in zeir uniform"--he said contemptuously--"and zey say zat everyone
must be an Aryan man--zis vonderful plue-eyed person eight feet tall
who has been Aryan in his family since 1820. If zere is a little Chew
back zere--zen it is a pity," Heilig jeered. "Zis man can no more
vork--he is no more in ze Cherman spirit. It is all quite stupid." He
smoked in silence for a minute or two, then continued: "Zis last year
zese big fools haf been coming round to me. Zey demand to know who I
am, vhere I am from--whezzer or not I haf been born or not. Zey say zat
I must prove to zem zat I am an Aryan man. Ozzervise I can no longer
vork in ze library."</p>

<p>"But my God, Franz!" George cried, and stared at him in
stupefaction. "You don't mean to tell me that--why, you're not a Jew,"
he said, "<i>are</i> you?"</p>

<p>"Oh Gott no!" Heilig cried, with a sudden shout of gleeful
desperation. "My dear shap, I am so Gott-tam Cherman zat it is
perfectly dret-ful."</p>

<p>"Well, then," George demanded, puzzled, "what's the trouble? Why
should they bother you? Why worry about it if you're a German?"</p>

<p>Heilig was silent a little while, and the look of wry, wounded
humour in his small, puckered face had deepened perceptibly before he
spoke again.</p>

<p>"My dear Chorge," he said at last, "now I may tell you somesing. I
am completely Cherman, it is true. Only, my poor dear mozzer--I do so
luff her, of course--but Gott!" He laughed through his closed mouth,
and there was bitter merriment in his face. "Gott! She is such a fool!
Zis poor lady," he said, a trifle contemptuously, "luffed my fazzer
very much--so much, in fact, zat she did not go to ze trouble to marry
him. So zese people come and ask me all zese questions: and say: Where
is your fazzer!' And of gourse I cannot tell zem. Because, alas, my
dear old shap, I am zis bastard. Gott!" he cried again, and with eyes
narrowed into slits he laughed bitterly out of the corner of his mouth.
"It is all so dret-ful--so stupid--and so horribly funny!"</p>

<p>"But Franz! Surely you must know who your father is--you must have
heard his name."</p>

<p>"My Gott, yes!" he cried. "Zat is vhat makes it all so funny."</p>

<p>"You mean you know him, then? He is living?"</p>

<p>"But of gourse," said Heilig. "He is living in Berlin."</p>

<p>"Do you ever see him?"</p>

<p>"But of gourse," he said again. "I see him every veek. Ve are
<i>quite</i> good friends."</p>

<p>"But--then I don't see what the trouble is--unless they can take
your job from you because you're a bastard. It's embarrassing, of
course, and all that, both for your father and yourself--but can't you
tell them? Can't you explain it to them? Won't your father help you
out?"</p>

<p>"I am sure he vould," said Heilig, "if I told zis sing to him. Only,
I cannot tell him. You see," he went on quietly, "my fazzer and I are
quite good friends. Ve never speak about zis sing togezzer--ze vay he
knew my mozzer. And now, I vould not ask him--I vould not tell him of
zis trouble--I vould not vant him to help me--because it might seem zat
I vas taking an adwantage. It might spoil everysing."</p>

<p>"But your father--is he known here? Would these people know his name
if you mentioned it?"</p>

<p>"Oh Gott yes!" Heilig cried out gleefully, and snuffled with bitter
merriment. "Zat is vhat makes it all so horrible--and so dret-fully
amusing. Zey vould know his name at vonce. Perhaps zey vill say zat I
am zis little Chew and t'row me out because I am no Aryan man--and my
fazzer"--Heilig choked and, snuffling, bent half over in his bitter
merriment--"my fazzer is zis loyal Cherman man--zis big Nazi--zis most
important person in ze Party!"</p>

<p>For a moment George looked at his friend--whose name, ironically,
signified "the holy one"--and could not speak. This strange and moving
illumination of his history explained so much about him--the growing
bitterness and disdain towards everyone and everything, the sense of
weary disgust and resignation, the cold venom of his humour, and that
smile which kept his face almost perpetually puckered up. As he sat
there, fragile, small, and graceful, smiling his wry smile, the whole
legend of his life became plain. He had been life's tender child, so
sensitive, so affectionate, so amazingly intelligent. He had been the
fleeceling lamb thrust out into the cold to bear the blast and to
endure want and loneliness. He had been wounded cruelly. He had been
warped and twisted. He had come to this, and yet he had maintained a
kind of bitter integrity.</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry, Franz," George said. "So damned sorry. I never knew
of this."</p>

<p>"Vell, zen," said Heilig indifferently, "I may tell you zat it does
not matter. It really does not matter." He smiled his tortured smile,
snuffling a little through his lips, flicked the ash from his
cigarette, and shifted his position. "I shall do somesing about it. I
haf engaged one of zese little men--zese dret-ful little people--vhat
do you call zem?--lawyers!--O Gott, but zey are dret-ful!" he shouted
gleefully. "I haf bought one of zem to make some lies for me. Zis
little man wiz his papers--he vill feel around until he discover
fazzers, mozzers, sisters, brozzers--everysing I need. If he cannot, if
zey vill not believe--yell, zen," said Heilig, "I must lose my chob.
But it does not matter. I shall do somesing. I shall go somevhere else.
I shall get along somehow. I haf done so before, and it vas not too
terrible...But zese fools--zese dret-ful people!" he said with deep
disgust. "Some day, my dear Chorge, you must write a bitter book. You
must tell all zese people just how horrible zey are. Myself--I haf no
talent. I cannot write a book. I can do nozzing but admire vhat ozzers
do and know if it is good. But you must tell zese dret-ful people vhat
zey are...I haf a little fantasy," he went on with a look of impish
glee. "Ven I feel bad--yen I see all zese dret-ful people valking up
and down in ze Kurf&uuml;rstendamm and sitting at ze tables and putting
food into zeir faces--zen I imagine zat I haf a little ma-chine gun. So
I take zis little ma-chine gun and go up and down, and ven I see one of
zese dret-ful people I go--ping-ping-ping-pingping!" As he uttered
these words in a rapid, childish key, he took aim with his hand and
hooked his finger rapidly. "0 Gott!" he cried ecstatically. "I should
so enchoy it if I could go around wiz zis little ma-chine gun and use
it on all zese stupid fools! But I cannot. My ma-chine gun is only in
imagination. Wiz you it is different. You haf a ma-chine gun zat you
can truly use. And you must use it," he said earnestly. "Some day you
must write zis bitter book, and you must tell zese fools vhere zey
belong. Only," he added quickly, and turned anxiously towards George,
"you must not do it yet. Or if you do, you must not say some sings in
zis book zat vill make zese people angry wiz you here."</p>

<p>"What kind of things do you mean, Franz?"</p>

<p>"Zese sings about"--he lowered his voice and glanced quickly towards
the door--"about politics--about ze Party. Sings zat vould bring zem
down on you. It would be quite dret-ful if you did."</p>

<p>"Why would it?"</p>

<p>"Because," he said, "you have a great name here. I don't mean wiz
zese fools, zese stupid people, but wiz ze people left who still read
books. I may tell you," he said earnestly, "zat you have ze best name
here now of any foreign writer. If you should spoil it now--if you
should write some sings now zat zey vould not like--it vould be a pity.
Ze <i>Reichschriftskammer</i> vould forbid your books--vould tell us
zat ve could no longer read you--and ve could not get your books. And
zat vould be a pity. Ve do so like you here--I mean ze people who
understand. Zey know so vell about you. Zey understand ze vay you feel
about sings. And I may tell you zat ze translations are quite
marvellous. Ze man who does zem is a poet, and he luffs you--he gets
you in, ze vay you feel--your images--ze rhythmus of your writing. And
ze people find it very vonderful. Zey cannot believe zat zey are
reading a translation. Zey say zat it must haf been written in Cherman
in ze beginning. And-0 Gott!" he shouted gleefully again--"zey call you
everysing--ze American Homer, ze American epic writer. Zey like and
understand you so much. Your writing is so full of juice, so round and
full of blood. Ze feeling is like feeling zat ve haf. Wiz many people
you haf ze greatest name of any writer in ze world to-day."</p>

<p>"That's a good deal more than I've got at home, Franz."</p>

<p>"I know. But zen, I notice, in America zey lull everyvun a year--and
zen zey spit upon him. Here, wiz many people you haf zis great name,"
he said earnestly, "and it vould be too dret-ful--it vould be such a
pity--if you spoil it now. You vill not?" he said, and again looked
anxiously and earnestly at George.</p>

<p>George looked off in space and did not answer right away; then he
said:</p>

<p>"A man must write what he must write. A man must do what he must
do."</p>

<p>"Zen you mean zat if you felt zat you had to say some sings--about
politics--about zese stupid fools--about----"</p>

<p>"What about life?" George said. "What about people?"</p>

<p>"You vould say it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I would."</p>

<p>"Efen if it did you harm? Efen if it spoiled you here? Efen if ve
could no longer read vhat you write?" With his small face peering
earnestly at George, he waited anxiously for his reply.</p>

<p>"Yes, Franz, even if that happened."</p>

<p>Heilig was silent a moment, and then, with apparent hesitancy, he
said:</p>

<p>"Efen if you write somesing--and zey say to you zat you cannot come
back?"</p>

<p>George, too, was silent now. There was much to think of. But at last
he said:</p>

<p>"Yes, even if they told me that."</p>

<p>Heilig straightened sharply, with a swift intake of anger and
impatience. "Zen I vill tell you somesing," he said harshly. "You are
one big fool." He rose, flung his cigarette away, and began to pace
nervously up and down the room. "Vhy should you go and spoil yourself?"
he cried. "Vhy should you go and write sings now zat vill make it so
zat you cannot come back. You do so luff it here!" he cried; then
turned sharply, anxiously, and said: "You do, of gourse?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do--better than almost any other place on earth."</p>

<p>"And ve alzo!" cried Heilig, pacing up and down. "Ve do so luff you,
too. You are no stranger to us, Chorge. I see ze people look at you ven
you go by upon ze street and zey all smile at you. Zere is somesing
about you zat zey like. Ze little girls in ze shirt shop yen ye vent to
buy ze shirt for you--zey all said: 'Who is he?' Zey all vanted to know
about you. Zey kept ze shop open two hours late, till nine o'clock zat
night, so zat ze shirt vould be ready for you. Efen ven you speak zis
poor little Cherman zat you speak, all ze people like it. Ze vaiters in
ze restaurants come and do sings for you before everybody else, and not
because zey vant a tip from you. You are at home here. Everybody
understands you. You have zis famous name--to us you are zis great
writer. And for a little politics," he said bitterly, "because zere are
zese stupid fools, you vould now go and spoil it all."</p>

<p>George made no answer. So Heilig, still walking feverishly up and
down, went on:</p>

<p>"Vhy should you do it? You are no politician. You are no propaganda
Party man. You are not one of zese Gott-tam little New York
<i>Salon-Kommunisten</i>." He spat the word out viciously, his pale
eyes narrowed into slits. "May I now tell you somesing?" He paused
abruptly, looking at George. "I hate zese bloody little people--zese
damned aest'etes--zese little propaganda literary men." Puckering his
face into an expression of mincing disdain, advancing with two fingers
pressed together in the air before him, and squinting at them with
delicately lidded eyes, he coughed in an affected way--"U-huh,
u-huh!"--and then, in a tone of mincing parody, he quoted from an
article he had read: "'HI may say so, ze transparence of <i>ze
Darstellung</i> in Vebber's vork...' U-huh, u-huh!" he coughed again.
"Zis bloody little fool who wrote zat piece about you in <i>Die
Dame</i>--zis damned little aest'ete wiz zese phrases about 'ze
transparence of ze <i>Darstellung</i>'--may I tell you somesing?" he
shouted violently. "I spit upon zese bloody people! Zey are everyvhere
ze same. You find zem in London, Paris, Vienna. Zey are bad enough in
Europe--but in America!" he shouted, his face lighting up with impish
glee--"O Gott! If I may tell you so, zey are perfectly dret-ful! Vhere
do you get zem from? Efen ze European aest'ete says: 'My Gott! zese
bloody men, zese awful people, zese demned aest'etes from ze Oo Ess
Ah--zey are too dretful!'"</p>

<p>"Are you talking now of Communists? You began on them, you
know!"</p>

<p>"Veil now," he said, curtly and coldly, with the arrogant dismissal
that was becoming more and more characteristic of him, "it does not
matter. It does not matter vhat zey call zemselves. Zey are all ze
same. Zey are zese little expressionismus, surr&eacute;alismus,
<i>Kommunismus</i> people--but really zey can call zemselves anysing,
everysing, for zey are nozzing. And may I tell you zat I hate zem. I am
so tired of all zese belated little people," he said, and turned away
with an expression of weariness and disgust. "It does not matter. It
simly does not matter vhat zey say. For zey know nozzing."</p>

<p>"You think then, Franz, that all of Communism is like that--that all
Communists are just a crowd of parlour fakes?"</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>die Kommunisten</i>," said Heilig wearily. "No, I do not
sink zat zey are all fakes. And <i>Kommunismus</i>"--he shrugged his
shoulders--"vell, zen, I sink zat it is very good. I sink zat some day
ze vorld may live like zat. Only, I do not sink zat you and I will see
it. It is too great a dream. And zese sings are not for you. You are
not one of zese little propaganda Party people--you are a writer. It is
your duty to look around you and to write about ze vorld and people as
you see zem. It is not your duty to write propaganda speeches and call
zem books. You could not do zat. It is quite impossible."</p>

<p>"But suppose I write about the world and people as I see them, and
come in conflict with the Party--what then?"</p>

<p>"Zen," he said roughly, "you vill be one big fool. You can write
everysing you need to write wizout zese Party people coming down on
you. You do not need to mention zem. And if you do mention zem, and do
not say nice sings, zen ye can no longer read you, and you cannot come
back. And for vhat vould you do it? If you vere some little propaganda
person in New York, you could say zese sings and zen it vould not
matter. Because zey can say anysing zey like--but zey know nozzing of
us, and it costs zem nozzing. But you--you have so much to lose."</p>

<p>Heilig paced back and forth in feverish silence, puffing on his
cigarette, then all at once he turned and demanded truculently:</p>

<p>"You sink it is so bad here now?--ze vay sings are wiz ze Party and
zese stupid people? You sink it vould be better if zere vas anozzer
party, like in America? Zen," he said, not waiting for an answer, "I
sink you are mistaken. It is bad here, of gourse, but I sink it vill be
soon no better wiz you. Zese bloody fools--you find zem everyvhere. Zey
are ze same wiz you, only in a different vay." Suddenly he looked at
George earnestly and searchingly. "You sink zat you are free in
America--no?" He shook his head and went on: "I do not sink so. Ze only
free ones are zese dret-ful people. Here, zey are free to tell you vhat
you must read, vhat you must believe, and I sink zat is also true in
America. You must sink and feel ze vay zey do--you must say ze sings
zey vant you to say--or zey kill you. Ze only difference is zat here
zey haf ze power to do it. In America zey do not haf it yet, but just
vait--zey vill get it. Ve Chermans haf shown zem ze vay. And zen, you
vould be more free here zan in New York, for here you haf a better
name, I sink, zan in America. Here zey admire you. Here you are
American, and you could efen write and say sings zat no Cherman could
do, so long as you say nozzing zat is against ze Party. Do you sink zat
you could do zat in New York?"</p>

<p>He paced the floor in silence for a long moment, pausing to look
searchingly at George. At length he answered his own question:</p>

<p>"No, you could not. Zese people here--zey say zat zey are Nazis. I
sink zat zey are more honest. In New York, zey call zemselves by some
fine name. Zey are ze <i>Salon-Kommunisten</i>. Zey are ze Daughters of
ze Revolution. Zey are ze American Legion. Zey are ze business men, ze
Chamber of Commerce. Zey are one sing and anozzer, but zey are all ze
same, and I sink zat zey are Nazis, too. You vill find everyvhere zese
bloody people. Zey are not for you. You are not a propaganda man."</p>

<p>Again there was a silence. Heilig continued to pace the floor,
waiting for George to say something; when he did not, Heilig went on
again. And in his next words he revealed a depth of cynicism and
indifference which was greater than George had ever before suspected,
and of which he would not have thought Heilig's sensitive soul was
capable.</p>

<p>"If you write somesing now against ze Nazis," said Heilig, "you vill
please ze Chews, but you cannot come back to Chermany again, and zat
for all of us vould be quite dret-ful. And may I tell you some-sing?"
he cried harshly and abruptly, and glared at George. "I do not like
zese Gott-tam Chews any more zan I like zese ozzer people. Zey are just
as bad. Ven all is going yell wiz zem, zey say: 'Ve spit upon you and
your bloody country because ye are so vunderful.' And yen sings are
going bad wiz zem, zey become zese little Chewish men zat veep and
wring zeir hands and say: 'Ve are only zese poor, downtrodden Chews,
and look vhat zey are doing to us.' And may I tell you," he cried
harshly, "zat I do not care. I do not sink it matters very much. I sink
zat it is stupid vhat zese bloody fools are doing to zese Chews--but I
do not care. It does not matter. I haf seen zese Chews yen zey vere
high and full of power, and really zey vere dret-ful. Zey vere only for
zemselves. Zey spit upon ze rest of us. So it does not matter," he
repeated harshly. "Zey are as bad as all ze ozzers, zese great, fat
Chews. If I had my little ma-chine gun, I vould shoot zem, too. Ze only
sing I care about more is vhat zese dret-ful fools viii do to
Chermany--to ze people." Anxiously, he looked at George and said: "You
do so like ze people, Chorge?"</p>

<p>"Enormously," said George, almost in a whisper, and he was filled
with such an overwhelming sadness--for Germany, for the people, and for
his friend--that he could say no more. Heilig caught the full
implications of George's whispered tone. He glanced at him sharply.
Then he sighed deeply, and his bitterness dropped away.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said quietly, "you must, of gourse." Then he added gently:
"Zey are really a good lot. Zey are big fools, of gourse, but zey are
not too bad."</p>

<p>He was silent a moment. He ground out his cigarette in the ashtray,
sighed again, and then said, a little sadly:</p>

<p>"Veil, zen, you must do vhat you must do. But you are one big fool."
He looked at his watch and put his hand upon George's arm. "Come on,
old shap. Now it is time to go."</p>

<p>George got up, and for a moment they stood looking at each other,
then they clasped each other by the hand.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Franz," George said.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, dear Chorge," said Heilig quietly. "Ve shall miss you
very much."</p>

<p>"And I you," George answered. Then they went out.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="chapter6-40"></a>40. Last Farewell</h2>

<p>When they got downstairs the bill was made up and ready, and George
paid it. There was no need to count it up, because there never had been
a cheat or error in their reckoning. George distributed extra largess
to the head porter--a grey, chunky, sternly able Prussian--and to the
head waiter. He gave a mark to the smiling boy beside the lift, who
clicked his heels together and saluted. He took one final look at the
faded, ugly, curiously pleasant furnishings of the little foyer, and
said good-bye again, and went swiftly down the steps into the
street.</p>

<p>The porter was already there. He had the baggage on the kerb. A taxi
was just drawing up, and he stowed the baggage in. George tipped him
and shook hands. He also tipped the enormous doorman, a smiling,
simple, friendly fellow who had always patted him upon the back as he
went in and out. Then he got into the taxi, sat down by Heilig, and
gave the driver the address--Bahnhof Am Zoo.</p>

<p>The taxi wheeled about and started up along the other side of the
Kurf&uuml;rstendamm, turned and crossed into the Joachimtalen-strasse,
and, three minutes later, drew in before the station. They still had
some minutes to wait before the train, which was coming from the
Friedrich-strasse, would be there. They gave the baggage to a porter,
who said he would meet them on the platform. Then Heilig thrust a coin
into the machine and bought a platform ticket. They passed by the
ticket inspectors and went up the stairs.</p>

<p>A considerable crowd of travellers was already waiting on the
platform. A train was just pulling in out of the west, from the
direction of Hanover and Bremen. A number of people got off. On other
tracks the glittering trains of the Stadtbahn were moving in and out;
their beautiful, shining cars--deep maroon, red, and golden
yellow--going from east to west, from west to east, and to all the
quarters of the city's compass, were heavily loaded with morning
workers. George looked down the tracks towards the east, in the
direction from which his train must come, and saw the semaphores, the
lean design of tracks, the tops of houses, and the massed greens of the
Zoologic Garden. The Stadtbahn trains kept sliding in and out, swiftly,
almost noiselessly, discharging streams of hurrying people, taking in
others. It was all so familiar, so pleasant, and so full of morning. It
seemed that he had known it for ever, and he felt as he always did when
he left a city--a sense of sorrow and regret, of poignant unfulfilment,
a sense that here were people he could have known, friends he could
have had, all lost now, fading, slipping from his grasp, as the
inexorable moment of the departing hour drew near.</p>

<p>Far down the platform the doors of the baggage elevator clanged, and
the porters pulled trucks loaded with great piles of baggage out upon
the platform. And presently George saw his porter advancing with a
truck, and among the bags and trunks upon it he could see his own. The
porter nodded to him, indicating at about what point he ought to
stand.</p>

<p>At this same moment he turned and saw Else coming down the platform
towards him. She walked slowly, at her long and rhythmic stride. People
followed her with their eyes as she passed by. She was wearing a rough
tweed jacket of a light, coarse texture and a skirt of the same
material. Everything about her had a kind of incomparable style. She
could have worn anything with the same air. Her tall figure was
stunning, a strange and moving combination of delicacy and power. Under
her arm she was carrying a book, and as she came up she gave it to
George. He took her hands, which for so large a woman were amazingly
lovely and sensitive, long, white, and slender as a child's, and George
noticed that they were cold, and that the fingers trembled.</p>

<p>"Else, you have met Herr Heilig, haven't you? Franz, you remember
Frau von Kohler?"</p>

<p>Else turned and surveyed Heilig coldly and sternly. Heilig answered
her look with a stare that was equally unrelenting and hostile. There
was a formidable quality in the mutual suspicion they displayed as
their eyes met. George had observed the same phenomenon many times
before in the encounters of Germans who were either total strangers or
who did not know each other well. At once their defences would be up,
as if each distrusted the other on sight and demanded full credentials
and assurances before relenting into any betrayal of friendliness and
confidence. George was used to this sort of thing by now. It was what
was to be expected. Just the same, it never failed to be alarming to
him when it happened. He could not accustom himself to it and accept it
as an inevitable part of life, as so many of these Germans seemed to
have done, because he had never seen anything like it at home, or
anywhere else in the world before.</p>

<p>Moreover, between these two, the usual manifestations of suspicion
were heightened by an added quality of deep, instinctive dislike. As
they stood regarding each other, something flashed between them that
was as cold and hard as steel, as swift and naked as a rapier thrust.
These feelings of distrust and antagonism were communicated in a single
moment's silence; then Else inclined her head slightly and sternly and
said in her excellent English, which had hardly a trace of accent and
revealed its foreignness only by an occasional phrase and the undue
precision of her enunciation:</p>

<p>"I believe we have met, at Grauschmidt's party for George."</p>

<p>"I belief so," Heilig said. And then, after surveying her a moment
longer with a look of truculent hostility, he said coldly: "And
Grauschmidt's drawing in ze <i>Tageblatt</i>--you did not like
it--no?"</p>

<p>"Of George!" she spoke derisively, incredulously. Her stern face was
suddenly illuminated with a radiant smile. She laughed scornfully and
said: "This drawing by your friend, Grauschmidt--you mean the one that
made George look like a wonderful and charming sugar-tenor?"</p>

<p>"You did not like it, zen?" said Heilig coldly.</p>

<p>"But <i>ja!</i>" she cried. "As a drawing of a
<i>Zuckertenor</i>--as a drawing of Herr Grauschmidt, the way he is
himself, the way he sees and feels--it is quite perfect! But George! It
looks no more like George than you do!"</p>

<p>"Zen I may tell you somesing," said Heilig coldly and venomously. "I
sink zat you are very stupid. Ze drawing vas egg-zellent--everybody
sought so. Grauschmidt himself said zat it vas vun of ze very best zat
he has effer done. He likes it very much."</p>

<p>"But nat&uuml;rlich!" Else said ironically, and laughed scornfully
again. "Herr Grauschmidt likes so many things. First of all, he likes
himself. He likes everything he does. And he likes music of Puccini,"
she went on rapidly. "He sings <i>Ave Maria</i>. He likes sob-songs of
Hilbach. He likes dark rooms with a red light and silken pillows. He is
romantic and likes to talk about his feelings. He thinks: 'We
artists!'"</p>

<p>Heilig was furious. "If I may tell you somesing----" he began.</p>

<p>But Else now could not be checked. She took a short and angry step
away, then turned again, with two spots of passionate colour in her
cheeks:</p>

<p>"Your friend, Herr Grauschmidt," she continued, "likes to talk of
art. He says: 'This orchestra is wonderful!'--he never hears the music.
He goes to see Shakespeare, saying; 'Mayer is a wonderful actor.'
He----"</p>

<p>"If I may tell you somesing----" Heilig choked.</p>

<p>"He likes little girls with high heels," she panted. "He is in the
Ess Ah. When he shaves, he wears a hair-dress cap. Of course his nails
are polished. He has a lot of photographs--of himself and other great
people!" And, panting but triumphant, she turned and walked away a few
paces to compose herself.</p>

<p>"Zese bloody people!" Heilig grated. "0 Gott, but zey are dretful!"
Turning to George, he said venomously: "If I may tell you somesing--zis
person--zis voman--zis von Kohler zat you like so much--she <i>iss</i>
a fool!"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, Franz. I don't think she is. You know what I think
of her."</p>

<p>"Vell, zen," said Heilig, "you are wrong. You are mistaken. If I may
say so, you are again also one big fool. Vell, zen, it does not
matter," he cried harshly. "I vill go and buy some cigarettes, and you
can try to talk to zis damn stupid voman." And, still choking with
rage, he turned abruptly and walked away down the platform.</p>

<p>George went up to Else. She was still excited, still breathing
rapidly. He took her hands and they were trembling. She said:</p>

<p>"This bitter little man--this man whose name it means 'the holy
one'--he is so full of bitterness--he hates me. He is so jealous for
you. He wants to keep you for himself. He has told you lies. He has
tried to say things against me. I hear them!" she went on excitedly.
"People come to me with them! I do not listen to them!" she cried
angrily. "0 George, George!" she said suddenly, and took him by the
arms. "Do not listen to this bitter little man. Last night," she
whispered, "I had a strange dream. It was a so strange, a so good and
wonderful dream that I had for you. You must not listen to this bitter
man!" she cried earnestly, and shook him by the arms. "You are
religious man. You are artist. And the artist is religious man."</p>

<p>Just then Lewald appeared on the platform and came towards them. His
pink face looked fresh and hearty as always. His constant exuberance
had in it a suggestion of alcoholic stimulation. Even at this hour of
the morning he seemed to be bubbling over with a veiny exhilaration. As
he barged along, swinging his great shoulders and his bulging belly,
people all along the platform caught the contagion of his gleeful
spirits and smiled at him, and yet their smiles, were also tinged with
respect. In spite of his great pink face and his enormous belly, there
was nothing ridiculous in Lewald's appearance. One's first impression
was that of a strikingly handsome man. One did not think of him as
being fat; rather, one thought of him as being big. And as he rolled
along, he dominated the scene with a sense of easy and yet massive
authority. One would scarcely have taken him for a business man, and a
very shrewd and crafty one to boot. Everything about him suggested a
natural and instinctive Bohemianism. Looking at him, one felt that
here, probably, was an old army man, not of the Prussian military type,
but rather a fellow who had done his service and who had thoroughly
enjoyed the army life--the boisterous camaraderie of men, the eating
and drinking bouts, the adventures with the girls--as, indeed, he
had.</p>

<p>A tremendous appetite for life was plainly legible all over him.
People recognized it the moment they saw him, and that is why they
smiled. He seemed so full of wine, so full of spacious, hearty
unconventionality. His whole manner proclaimed him to be the kind of
man who has burst through all the confines of daily, routine living
with the force of a natural element. He was one of those men who,
immediately somehow, shine out luminously in all the grey of life, one
of those men who carry about their persons a glamorous aura of warmth,
of colour, and of temperament. In any crowd he stood out in dominant
and exciting isolation, drawing all eyes to himself with a vivid
concentration of interest, so that one would remember him later even
though one had seen him only for an instant, just as one would remember
the one room in an otherwise empty house that had furniture and a fire
in it.</p>

<p>So now, as he approached, even when he was still some yards away, he
began to shake his finger at George waggishly, at the same time moving
his great head from side to side. As he came up, he sang out in a
throaty, vinous voice the opening phrases of an obscene song which he
had taught to George, and which the two of them had often sung together
during those formidable evenings at his house:</p>

<p>"<i>Lecke du, lecke du, lecke du die Katze am Arsch...</i>"</p>

<p>Else flushed, but Lewald checked himself quickly at the penultimate
moment and, wagging his finger at George again, cried:</p>

<p>"<i>Ach du!</i>" And then, in an absurdly sly and gleeful croon, his
small eyes twinkling roguishly: "Naught-ee boy-ee! Naught-ee
boy-ee!"--wagging a finger all the time. "My old Chorge!" he cried
suddenly and heartily. "There haf you been--you naught-ee boy-ee? I
look for you last night and I cannot see you anyvheres!"</p>

<p>Before George could answer, Heilig returned, smoking a cigarette.
George remembered that the two men had met before, but now they gave no
sign of recognition. Indeed, Lewald's hearty manner dropped away at
sight of the little Heilig, and his face froze into an expression of
glacial reserve and suspicion. George was so put out by this that he
forgot his own manners, and instead of presenting Else to Lewald, he
stammered out an introduction of Heilig. Lewald then acknowledged the
other's presence with a stiff and formal little bow. Heilig merely
inclined his head slightly and returned Lewald's look coldly. George
was feeling very uncomfortable and embarrassed when Lewald took the
situation in hand again. Turning his back on Heilig, he now resumed his
former manner of hearty exuberance and, seizing George's arm in one
meaty fist and pounding affectionately upon it with the other, he cried
out loudly:</p>

<p>"Chorge! Vhere haf you been, you naught-ee boy-ee? Vhy do you not
come in to see me dese last days? I vas eggsbecting you."</p>

<p>"Why--I--I--" George began, "I really meant to, Karl. But I knew you
would be here to see me off, and I just didn't get around to dropping
in at your office again. I've had a great deal to do, you know."</p>

<p>"And I <i>also</i>!" cried Lewald, his voice rising in droll
emphasis on the last word. "I <i>alzo!</i>" he repeated. "But me--I
alvays haf time for mein friends," he said accusingly, still beating
away on George's arm to show that his pretended hurt had not really
gone very deep.</p>

<p>"Karl," George now said, "you remember Frau von Kohler, don't
you?"</p>

<p>"<i>Aber nat&uuml;rlich!</i>" he cried with the boisterous gallantry
that always marked his manner with women. "Honourable lady," he said in
German, "how are you? I shall not be likely to forget the pleasure you
gave me by coming to one of my parties. But I have not seen you since
that evening, and I have seen less and less of old Chorge since then."
Relapsing into English at this point, he turned to George again and
shook his finger at him, saying: "You naught-ee boy-ee, you!"</p>

<p>This playful gallantry had no effect on Else. Her face did not relax
any of its sternness. She just looked at Lewald with her level gaze and
made no effort to conceal the scorn she felt for him. Lewald, however,
appeared not to notice, for once more he turned to her and addressed
her in his exuberant German:</p>

<p>"Honourable lady, I can understand the reason why the Chorge has
deserted me. He has found more exciting adventures than anything the
poor old Lewald had to offer him." Here he turned back to George again
and, with his small eyes twinkling mischievously, he wagged his finger
beneath George's nose and crooned slyly, absurdly: "Naught-ee boy-ee!
Naught-ee boy-ee!"--as if to say: "Aha, you rascal, you! I've caught
you now!"</p>

<p>This whole monologue had been delivered almost without a pause in
Lewald's characteristic manner--a manner that had been famous
throughout Europe for thirty years. His waggishness with George was
almost childishly naive and playful, while his speech to Else was
bluff, high-spirited, hearty, and good-humoured. Through it all he gave
the impression of a man who was engagingly open and sincere, and one
who was full of jolly good will towards mankind. It was the manner
George had seen him use many times--when he was meeting some new,
author, when he was welcoming someone to his office, when he was
talking over the telephone, or inviting friends to a party.</p>

<p>But now again, George was able to observe the profound difference
between the manner and the man. The bluff and hearty openness was just
a mask which Lewald used against the world with all the deceptive grace
and subtlety of a great matador preparing to give the finishing stroke
to a charging bull. Behind that mask was concealed the true image of
the man's soul, which was sly, dexterous, crafty, and cunning. George
noticed again how really small and shrewd were the features. The big
blond head and the broad shoulders and the great, pink, vinous jowls
gave an effect of massive size and grandeur, but that general effect
was not borne out by the smaller details. The mouth was amazingly tiny
and carnal; it was full of an almost obscene humour, and it had a kind
of mousing slyness, as if its fat little chops were fairly watering for
lewd tidbits. The nose was also small and pointed, and there was a
sniffing shrewdness about it. The eyes were little, blue, and twinkled
with crafty merriment. One felt that they saw everything--that they
were not only secretly and agreeably aware of the whole human comedy,
but were also slyly amused at the bluff and ingenuous part that their
owner was playing.</p>

<p>"But come, now!" Lewald cried suddenly, throwing back his shoulders
and seeming to collect himself to earnestness with a jerk. "I bring
somet'ing to you from mein hosband...Was?" He looked round at all three
of them with an expression of innocent, questioning bewilderment as
George grinned.</p>

<p>It was a familiar error of his broken English. He always called his
wife his "hosband", and frequently told George that some day he, too,
would get a "good hosband". But he used the word with an expression of
such droll innocence, his little blue eyes twinkling in his pink face
with a look of cherubic guilelessness, that George was sure he knew
better and was making the error deliberately for its comic effect. Now,
as George laughed, Lewald turned to Else, then to Heilig, with a
puzzled air, and in a lowered voice said rapidly:</p>

<p>"<i>Was, denn? Was meint Chorge? Wie sagt man das? Ist das nicht
richtig englisch?</i>"</p>

<p>Else looked pointedly away as though she had not heard him and
wished to have nothing more to do with him. Heilig's only answer was to
continue looking at him coldly and suspiciously. Lewald, however, was
not in the least put out by the unappreciativeness of his audience. He
turned back to George with a comical shrug, as if the whole thing were
quite beyond him, and then slipped into George's pocket a small flask
of German brandy, saying that it was the gift his "hosband" had sent.
Next he took out a thin and beautifully bound little volume which one
of his authors had written and illustrated. He held it in his hand and
fingered through it lovingly.</p>

<p>It was a comic memoir of Lewald's life, from the cradle to maturity,
done in that vein of grotesque brutality which hardly escapes the
macabre, but which nevertheless does have a power of savage caricature
and terrible humour such as no other race can equal. One of the
illustrations showed the infant Lewald as the infant Hercules
strangling two formidable-looking snakes, which bore the heads of his
foremost publishing rivals. Another showed the adolescent Lewald as
Gargantua, drowning out his native town of Kolberg in Pomerania. Still
another pictured Lewald as the young publisher, seated at a table in
Aenna Maentz caf&eacute; and biting large chunks out of a
drinking-glass and eating them--an operation which he had actually
performed on various occasions in the past, in order, as he said, "to
make propaganda for meinself and mein business."</p>

<p>Lewald had inscribed and autographed this curious little book for
George, and underneath the inscription had written the familiar and
obscene lines of the song: "<i>Lecke du, lecke du, lecke du die Katze
am Arsch.</i>" Now he closed the book and thrust it into George's
pocket.</p>

<p>And even as he did so there was a flurry of excitement in the crowd.
A light flashed, the porters moved along the platform. George looked up
the tracks. The train was coming. It bore down swiftly, sweeping in
round the edges of the Zoologic Garden. The huge snout of the
locomotive, its fenders touched with trimmings of bright red, advanced
bluntly, steamed hotly past, and came to a stop. The dull line of the
coaches was broken vividly in the middle with the glittering red of the
Mitropa dining-car.</p>

<p>Everybody swung into action. George's porter, heaving up his heavy
baggage, clambered quickly up the steps and found a compartment for
him. There was a blur of voices all round, an excited tumult of
farewell.</p>

<p>Lewald caught George by the hand, and with his other arm around
George's shoulder half-pounded and half-hugged him, saying: "My old
Chorge, <i>auf wiedersehen!</i>"</p>

<p>Heilig shook hands hard and fast, his small and bitter face
contorted as if he were weeping, while he said in a curiously vibrant,
deep, and tragic voice: "Good-bye, good-bye, dear Chorge, <i>auf
wiedersehen.</i>"</p>

<p>The two men turned away, and Else put her arms round him. He felt
her shoulders shake. She was weeping, and he heard her say: "Be good
man. Be great one that I know. Be religious man." And as her embrace
tightened, she half-gasped, half-whispered: "Promise." He nodded. Then
they came together: her thighs widened, dosed about his leg, her
voluptuous figure yielded, grew into him, their mouths clung fiercely,
and for the last time they were united in the embrace of love.</p>

<p>Then he climbed into the train. The guard slammed the door. Even as
he made his way down the narrow corridor towards his compartment, the
train started. These forms, these faces, and these lives all began to
slide away.</p>

<p>Heilig kept walking forward, waving his hat, his face still
contorted with the grimace of his sorrow. Behind him, Else walked along
beside the train, her face stern and lonely, her arm lifted in
farewell. Lewald whipped off his hat and waved it, his fair hair in
disarray above his flushed and vinous face. The last thing George heard
was his exuberant voice raised in a shout of farewell. "Old Chorge,
<i>auf wiedersehen!</i>" And then he cupped his hands round his mouth
and yelled: "<i>Lecke du</i>----!" George saw his shoulders heave with
laughter.</p>

<p>Then the train swept out around the curve. And they were lost.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="chapter6-41"></a>41. Five Passengers for Paris</h2>

<p>The train gathered speed. The streets and buildings in the western I
part of the city slipped past--those solid, ugly streets, those
massive, ugly buildings in the Victorian German style, which yet, with
all the pleasant green of trees, the window-boxes bright with red
geraniums, the air of order, of substance, and of comfort, had always
seemed as familiar and as pleasant to George as the quiet streets and
houses of a little town. Already they were sweeping through
Charlottenburg. They passed the station without halting, and on the
platforms George saw, with the old and poignant feeling of regret and
loss, the people waiting for the Stadtbahn trains. Upon its elevated
track the great train swept on smoothly towards the west, gathering
momentum steadily. They passed the Funkturma. Almost before he knew it
they were rushing through the outskirts of the city towards the open
country. They passed an aviation field. He saw the hangars and a flock
of shining 'planes. And as he looked, a great silver-bodied 'plane
moved out, sped along the runway, lofted its tail, broke slowly from
the earth, and vanished.</p>

<p>And now the city was left behind. Those familiar faces, forms, and
voices of just six minutes past now seemed as remote as dreams,
imprisoned there as in another world--a world of massive brick and
stone and pavements, a world hived of four million lives, of hope and
fear and hatred, of anguish and despair, of love, of cruelty and
devotion, that was called Berlin.</p>

<p>And now the land was stroking past, the level land of Brandenburg,
the lonely flatland of the north which he had always heard was so ugly,
and which he had found so strange, so haunting, and so beautiful. The
dark solitude of the forest was around them now, the loneliness of the
kiefern-trees, tall, slender, towering, and as straight as sailing
masts, bearing upon their tops the slender burden of their needled and
eternal green. Their naked poles shone with that lovely gold-bronze
colour which is like the material substance of a magic light. And all
between was magic, too. The forest dusk beneath the kieferntrees was
gold-brown also, the earth gold-brown and barren, and the trees
themselves stood alone and separate, a polelike forest filled with
haunting light.</p>

<p>Now and then the light would open and the woods be gone, and they
would sweep through the level cultivated earth, tilled thriftily to the
very edges of the track. He could see the clusters of farm buildings,
the red-tiled roofs, the cross-quarterings of barns and houses. Then
they would find the haunting magic of the woods again.</p>

<p>George opened the door of his compartment and went in and took a
seat beside the door. On the other side, in the corner by the window, a
young man sat and read a book. He was an elegant young man and dressed
most fashionably. He wore a sporting kind of coat with a small and
fancy check, a wonderful vest of some expensive doelike grey material,
cream-grey trousers pleated at the waist, also of a rich, expensive
weave, and grey suede gloves. He did not look American or English.
There was a foppish, almost sugared elegance about his costume that one
felt, somehow, was Continental. Therefore it struck George with a sense
of shock to see that he was reading an American book, a popular work in
history which had the title, <i>The Saga of Democracy</i>, and bore the
imprint of a well-known firm. But while he pondered on this puzzling
combination of the familiar and the strange there were steps outside
along the corridor, voices, the door was opened, and a woman and a man
came in.</p>

<p>They were Germans. The woman was small and no longer young, but she
was plump, warm, seductive-looking, with hair so light it was the
colour of bleached straw, and eyes as blue as sapphires. She spoke
rapidly and excitedly to the man who accompanied her, then turned to
George and asked if the other places were unoccupied. He replied that
he thought so, and looked questioningly at the dapper young man in the
corner. This young man now spoke up in somewhat broken German, saying
that he believed the other seats were free, and adding that he had got
on the train at the Friedrich-strasse station and had seen no one else
in the compartment. The woman immediately and vigorously nodded her
head in satisfaction and spoke with rapid authority to her companion,
who went out and presently returned with their baggage--two valises,
which he arranged upon the rack above their heads.</p>

<p>They were a strangely assorted pair. The woman, although most
attractive, was obviously much the older of the two. She appeared to be
in her late thirties or early forties. There were traces of fine
wrinkles at the corners of her eyes, and her face gave an impression of
physical maturity and warmth, together with the wisdom that comes from
experience, but it was also apparent that some of the freshness and
resilience of youth had gone out of it. Her figure had an almost
shameless sexual attraction, the kind of naked allure that one often
sees in people of the theatre--in a chorus girl or in the strip-tease
woman of a burlesque show. Her whole personality bore a vague
suggestion of the theatrical stamp. In everything about her there was
that element of heightened vividness which seems to set off and define
people who follow the stage.</p>

<p>Beside her assurance, her air of practice and authority, her sharply
vivid stamp, the man who accompanied her was made to seem even younger
than he was. He was probably twenty-six or thereabouts, but he looked a
mere stripling. He was a tall, blond, fresh-complexioned, and rather
handsome young German who conveyed an indefinable impression of
countrified and slightly bewildered innocence. He appeared nervous,
uneasy, and inexperienced in the art of travel. He kept his head down
or averted most of the time, and did not speak unless the woman spoke
to him. Then he would flush crimson with embarrassment, the two flags
of colour in his fresh, pink face deepening to beetlike red.</p>

<p>George wondered who they were, why they were going to Paris, and
what the relation between them could be. He felt, without exactly
knowing why, that there was no family connection between them. The
young man could not be the woman's brother, and it was also evident
that they were not man and wife. It was hard not to fall back upon an
ancient parable and see in them the village hayseed in the toils of the
city siren--to assume that she had duped him into taking her to Paris,
and that the fool and his money would soon be parted. Yet there was
certainly nothing repulsive about the woman to substantiate this
conjecture. She was decidedly a most attractive and engaging creature.
Even her astonishing quality of sexual magnetism, which was displayed
with a naked and almost uncomfortable openness, so that one felt it the
moment she entered the compartment, had nothing vicious in it. She
seemed, indeed, to be completely unconscious of it, and simply
expressed herself sensually and naturally with the innocent warmth of a
child.</p>

<p>While George was busy with these speculations the door of the
compartment opened again and a stuffy-looking little man with a long
nose looked in, peered about truculently, and rather suspiciously,
George thought, and then demanded to know if there was a free seat in
the compartment. They all told him that they thought so. Upon receiving
this information, he, too, without another word, disappeared down the
corridor, to reappear again with a large valise. George helped him to
stow it away upon the rack. It was so heavy that the little man could
probably not have managed it by himself, yet he accepted this service
sourly and without a word of thanks, hung up his overcoat, and fidgeted
and worried around, took a newspaper from his pocket, sat down opposite
George and opened it, banged the compartment door shut rather
viciously, and, after peering round mistrustfully at all the other
people, rattled his paper and began to read.</p>

<p>While he read his paper George had a chance to observe this
sour-looking customer from time to time. Not that there was anything
sinister about the man--decidedly there was not. He was just a drab,
stuffy, irascible little fellow of the type that one sees a thousand
times a day upon the streets, muttering at taxi-cabs or snapping at
imprudent drivers--the type that one is always afraid he is going to
encounter on a trip but hopes fervently he won't. He looked like the
kind of fellow who would always be slamming the door of the compartment
to, always going over and banging down the window without asking anyone
else about it, always fidgeting and fuming about and trying by every
crusty, crotchety, cranky, and ill-tempered method in his equipment to
make himself as unpleasant, and his travelling companions as
uncomfortable, as possible.</p>

<p>Yes, he was certainly a well-known type, but aside from this he was
wholly unremarkable. If one had passed him in the streets of the city,
one would never have taken a second look at him or remembered him
afterwards. It was only when he intruded himself into the intimacy of a
long journey and began immediately to buzz and worry around like a
troublesome hornet that he became memorable.</p>

<p>It was not long, in fact, before the elegant young gentleman in the
corner by the window almost ran afoul of him. The young fellow took out
an expensive-looking cigarette-case, extracted a cigarette, and then,
smiling engagingly, asked the lady if she objected to his smoking. She
immediately answered, with great warmth and friendliness, that she
minded not at all. George received this information with considerable
relief, and took a packet of cigarettes from his pocket and was on the
point of joining his unknown companion in the luxury of a smoke when
old Fuss-and-Fidget rattled his paper viciously, glared sourly at the
elegant young man and then at George, and, pointing to a sign upon the
wall of the compartment, croaked dismally:</p>

<p>"<i>Nicht Raucher</i>."</p>

<p>Well, all of them had known that at the beginning, but they had not
supposed that Fuss-and-Fidget would make an issue of it. The young
fellow and George glanced at each other with a slightly startled look,
grinned a little, caught the lady's eye, which was twinkling with the
comedy of the occasion, and were obediently about to put their
cigarettes away unsmoked when old Fuss-and-Fidget rattled his paper,
looked sourly round at them a second time, and then said bleakly that
as far as he was concerned it was all right--he didn't personally mind
their smoking--he just wanted to point out that they were in a
non-smoking compartment. The implication plainly was that from this
time on the crime was on their own heads, that he had done what he
could as a good citizen to warn them, but that if they proceeded with
their guilty plot against the laws of the land, it was no further
concern of his. Being thus reassured, they produced their cigarettes
again and lighted up.</p>

<p>Now while George smoked, and while old Fuss-and-Fidget read his
paper, George had further opportunity to observe this unpleasant
companion of the voyage. And his observations, intensified as they were
by subsequent events, became fixed as an imperishable image in his
mind. The image which occurred to him as he sat there watching the man
was that of a sour-tempered Mr. Punch. If you can imagine Mr. Punch
without his genial spirits, without his quick wit, without his shrewd
but kind intelligence, if you can imagine a crotchety and cranky Mr.
Punch going about angrily banging doors and windows shut, glaring round
at his fellow-travellers, and sticking his long nose into everybody's
business, then you will get some picture of this fellow. Not that he
was hunchbacked and dwarfed like Mr. Punch. He was certainly small, he
was certainly a drab, unlovely little figure of a man, but he was not
dwarfed. But his face had the ruddy glow that one associates with Mr.
Punch, and its contour, like that of Mr. Punch, was almost cherubic,
except that the cherub had gone sour. The nose also was somewhat
Punchian. It was not grotesquely hooked and beaked, but it was a long
nose, and its fleshy tip drooped over as if it were fairly sniffing
with suspicion, fairly stretching with eagerness to pry around and
stick itself into things that did not concern it.</p>

<p>George fell asleep presently, leaning against the side of the door.
It was a fitful and uneasy coma of half-sleep, the product of
excitement and fatigue--never comfortable, never whole--a dozing sleep
from which he would start up from time to time to look about him, then
doze again. Time after time he came sharply awake to find old
Fussand-Fidget's eyes fixed on him in a look of such suspicion and
ill-temper that it barely escaped malevolence. He woke up once to find
the man's gaze fastened on him in a stare that was so protracted, so
unfriendly, that he felt anger boiling up in him. It was on the tip of
his tongue to speak hotly to the fellow, but he, as if sensing George's
intent, ducked his head quickly and busied himself again with his
newspaper.</p>

<p>The man was so fidgety and nervous that it was impossible to sleep
longer than a few minutes at a time. He was always crossing and
uncrossing his legs, always rattling his newspaper, always fooling with
the handle of the door, doing something to it, jerking and pulling it,
half opening the door and banging it to again, as if he were afraid it
was not securely closed. He was always jumping up, opening the door,
and going out into the corridor, where he would pace up and down for
several minutes, turn and look out of the windows at the speeding
landscape, then fidget back and forth in the corridor again, sour-faced
and distempered-looking, holding his hands behind him and twiddling his
fingers nervously and impatiently as he walked.</p>

<p>All this while, the train was advancing across the country at
terrific speed. Forest and field, village and farm, tilled land and
pasture stroked past with the deliberate but devouring movement of high
velocity. The train slackened a little as it crossed the Elbe, but
there was no halt. Two hours after its departure from Berlin it was
sweeping in beneath the arched, enormous roof of the Hanover station.
There was to be a stop of ten minutes. As the train slowed down, George
awoke from his doze. But fatigue still held him, and he did not get
up.</p>

<p>Old Fuss-and-Fidget arose, however, and, followed by the woman and
her companion, went out on the platform for a little fresh air and
exercise.</p>

<p>George and the dapper young man in the corner were now left alone
together. The latter had put down his book and was looking out of the
window, but after a minute or two he turned to George and said in
English, marked by a slight accent:</p>

<p>"Where are we now?"</p>

<p>George told him they were at Hanover.</p>

<p>"I'm tired of travelling," the young man said with a sigh. "I shall
be glad when I get home."</p>

<p>"And where is home for you?" George asked.</p>

<p>"New York," he said, and, seeing a look of slight surprise on
George's face, he added quickly: "Of course I am not American by birth,
as you can see from the way I talk. But I am a naturalised American,
and my home is in New York."</p>

<p>George told him that he lived there, too. Then the young man asked
if George had been long in Germany.</p>

<p>"All summer," George replied. "I arrived in May."</p>

<p>"And you have been here ever since--in Germany?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said George, "except for ten days in the Tyrol."</p>

<p>"When you came in this morning I thought at first that you were
German. I believe I saw you on the platform with some German
people."</p>

<p>"Yes, they were friends of mine."</p>

<p>"But then when you spoke I saw you could not be a German from your
accent. When I saw you reading the Paris <i>Herald</i> I concluded that
you were English or American.</p>

<p>"I am American, of course."</p>

<p>"Yes, I can see that now. I," he said, "am Polish by birth. I went
to America when I was fifteen years old, but my family still lives in
Poland."</p>

<p>"And you have been to see them, naturally?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I have made a practice of coming over every year or so to
visit them. I have two brothers living in the country." It was evident
that he came from landed people. "I am returning from there now," he
said. He was silent for a moment, and then said with some emphasis:
"But not again! Not for a long time will I visit them. I have told them
that it is enough--if they want to see me now, they must come to New
York. I am sick of Europe," he went on. "Every time I come I am fed up.
I am tired of all this foolish business, these politics, this hate,
these armies, and this talk of war--the whole damned stuffy atmosphere
here!" he cried indignantly and impatiently, and, thrusting his hand
into his breast pocket, he pulled out a paper--"Will you look at
this?"</p>

<p>"What is it?" George said.</p>

<p>"A paper--a permit--the damn thing stamped and signed which allows
me to take twenty-three marks out of Germany. Twenty-three marks!" he
repeated scornfully--"as if I want their God-damn money!"</p>

<p>"I know," George said. "You've got to get a paper every time you
turn round. You have to declare your money when you come in, you have
to declare it when you go out. If you send home for money, you have to
get a paper for that, too. I made a little trip to Austria as I told
you. It took three days to get the papers that would allow me to take
my own money out. Look here!" he cried, and reached in his pocket and
pulled out a fistful of papers. "I got all of these in one summer."</p>

<p>The ice was broken now. Upon a mutual grievance they began to warm
up to each other. It quickly became evident to George that his new
acquaintance, with the patriotic fervour of his race, was passionately
American. He had married an American girl, he said. New York, he
asserted, was the most magnificent city on earth, the only place he
cared to live, the place he never wished to leave again, the place to
which he was aching to return.</p>

<p>And America?</p>

<p>"Oh," he said, "it will be good after all this to be back there
where all is peace and freedom--where all is friendship--where all is
love."</p>

<p>George felt some reservations to this blanket endorsement of his
native land, but he did not utter them. The man's fervour was so
genuine that it would have been unkind to try to qualify it. And
besides, George, too, was homesick now, and the man's words, generous
and whole-hearted as they were, warmed him with their pleasant glow. He
also felt, beneath the extravagance of the comparison, a certain truth.
During the past summer, in this country which he had known so well,
whose haunting beauty and magnificence had stirred him more deeply than
had any other he had ever known, and for whose people he had always had
the most affectionate understanding, he had sensed for the first time
the poisonous constrictions of incurable hatreds and insoluble
politics, the whole dense weave of intrigue and ambition in which the
tormented geography of Europe was again enmeshed, the volcanic
imminence of catastrophe with which the very air was laden, and which
threatened to erupt at any moment.</p>

<p>And George, like the other man, was weary and sick at heart,
exhausted by these pressures, worn out with these tensions of the
nerves and spirit, depleted by the cancer of these cureless hates which
had not only poisoned the life of nations but had eaten in one way or
another into the private lives of all his friends, of almost everyone
that he had known here. So, like his new-found fellow countryman, he
too felt, beneath the extravagance and intemperance of the man's
language, a certain justice in the comparison. He was aware, as indeed
the other must have been, of the huge sum of all America's lacks. He
knew that all, alas, was not friendship, was not freedom, was not love
beyond the Atlantic. But he felt, as his new friend must also have
felt, that the essence of America's hope had not been wholly ruined,
its promise of fulfilment not shattered utterly. And like the other
man, he felt that it would be very good to be back home again, out of
the poisonous constrictions of this atmosphere--back home where,
whatever America might lack, there was still air to breathe in, and
winds to clear the air.</p>

<p>His new friend now said that he was engaged in business in New York.
He was a member of a brokerage concern in Wall Street. This seemed to
call for some similar identification on George's part, and he gave the
most apt and truthful statement he could make, which was that he worked
for a publishing house. The other then remarked that he knew the family
of a New York publisher, that they were, in fact, good friends of his.
George asked him who these people were, and he answered:</p>

<p>"The Edwards family."</p>

<p>Instantly, a thrill of recognition pierced George. A light flashed
on, and suddenly he knew the man. He said:</p>

<p>"I know the Edwardses. They are among the best friends I have, and
Mr. Edwards is my publisher. And you"--George said--"your name is
Johnnie, isn't it? I have forgotten your last name, but I have heard
it."</p>

<p>He nodded quickly, smiling. "Yes, Johnnie Adamowski," he said. "And
you?--what is your name?"</p>

<p>George told him.</p>

<p>"Of course," he said. "I know of you."</p>

<p>So instantly they were shaking hands delightedly, with that kind of
stunned but exuberant surprise which reduces people to the banal
conclusion that "It's a small world after all." George's remark was
simply: "I'll be damned!" Adamowski's, more urbane, was: "It is quite
astonishing to meet you in this way. It is very strange--and yet in
life it always happens."</p>

<p>And now, indeed, they began to establish contact at many points.
They found that they knew in common scores of people. They discussed
them enthusiastically, almost joyfully. Adamowski had been away from
home just one short month, and George but five, but now, like an
explorer returning from the isolation of a polar voyage that had lasted
several years, George eagerly demanded news of his friends, news from
America, news from home.</p>

<p>By the time the other people returned to the compartment and the
train began to move again, George and Adamowski were deep in
conversation. Their three companions looked somewhat startled to hear
this rapid fire of talk and to see this evidence of acquaintance
between two people who had apparently been strangers just ten minutes
before. The little blonde woman smiled at them and took her seat; the
young man also. Old Fuss-and-Fidget glanced quickly, sharply, from one
to the other of them and listened attentively to all they said, as if
he thought that by straining his ears to catch every strange syllable
he might be able somehow to fathom the mystery of this sudden
friendship.</p>

<p>The cross-fire of their talk went back and forth, from George's
corner of the compartment to Adamowski's. George felt a sense of
embarrassment at the sudden intrusion of this intimacy in a foreign
language among fellow-travellers with whom he had heretofore maintained
a restrained formality. But Johnnie Adamowski was evidently a creature
of great social ease and geniality. He was troubled not at all. From
time to time he smiled in a friendly fashion at the three Germans as if
they, too, were parties to the conversation and could understand every
word of it.</p>

<p>Under this engaging influence, everyone began to thaw out visibly.
The little blonde woman began to talk in an animated way to her young
man. After a while Fuss-and-Fidget chimed in with those two, so that
the whole compartment was humming with the rapid interplay of English
and German.</p>

<p>Adamowski now asked George if he would not like some
refreshment.</p>

<p>"Of course I myself am not hungry," Adamowski said indifferently.
"In Poland I have had to eat too much. They eat all the time, these
Polish people. I had decided that I would eat no more until I got to
Paris. I am sick of food. But would you like some Polish fruits?" he
said, indicating a large paper-covered package at his side. "I believe
they have prepared some things for me," he said casually--"some fruits
from my brother's estate, some chickens and some partridges. I do not
care for them myself. I have no appetite. But wouldn't you like
something?"</p>

<p>George told him no, that he was not hungry either. Thereupon
Adamowski suggested that they might seek out the <i>Speisewagen</i> and
get a drink.</p>

<p>"I still have these marks," he said indifferently. "I spent a few
for breakfast, but there are seventeen or eighteen left. I shall not
want them any longer. I should not have used them. But now that I have
met you, I think it would be nice if I could spend them. Shall we go
and see what we can find?"</p>

<p>To this George agreed. They arose, excused themselves to their
companions, and were about to go out when old Fuss-and-Fidget surprised
them by speaking up in broken English and asking Adamowski if he would
mind changing seats. He said with a nervous, forced smile that was
meant to be ingratiating that Adamowski and the other gentleman,
nodding at George, could talk more easily if they were opposite each
other, and that for himself, he would be glad of the chance to look out
the window. Adamowski answered indifferently, and with just a trace of
the unconscious contempt with which a Polish nobleman might speak to
someone in whom he felt no interest:</p>

<p>"Yes, take my seat, of course. It does not matter to me where I
sit."</p>

<p>They went out and walked forward through several coaches of the
hurtling train, carefully squeezing past those passengers who, in
Europe, seem to spend as much time standing in the narrow corridors and
staring out of the windows as in their own seats, and who flatten
themselves against the wall or obligingly step back into the doors of
compartments as one passes. Finally they reached the Speisewagen,
skirted the hot breath of the kitchen, and seated themselves at a table
in the beautiful, bright, clean coach of the Mitropa service.</p>

<p>Adamowski ordered brandy lavishly. He seemed to have a Polish
gentleman's liberal capacity for drink. He tossed his glass off at a
single gulp, remarking rather plaintively:</p>

<p>"It is very small. But it is good and does no harm. We shall have
mote."</p>

<p>Pleasantly warmed by brandy, and talking together with the ease and
confidence of people who had known each other for many years--for,
indeed, the circumstances of their meeting and the discovery of their
many common friends did give them just that feeling of old
intimacy--they now began to discuss the three strangers in their
compartment.</p>

<p>"The little woman--she is rather nice," said Adamowski, in a tone
which somehow conveyed the impression that he was no novice in such
appraisals. "I think she is not very young, and yet, quite charming,
isn't she? A personality."</p>

<p>"And the young man with her?" George inquired. "What do you make of
him? You don't think he is her husband?"</p>

<p>"No, of course not," replied Adamowski instantly. "It is most
curious," he went on in a puzzled tone. "He is much younger, obviously,
and not the same--he is much simpler than the lady."</p>

<p>"Yes. It's almost as if he were a young fellow from the country, and
she----"</p>

<p>"Is like someone in the theatre," Adamowski nodded. "An actress. Or
perhaps some music-hall performer."</p>

<p>"Yes, exactly. She is very nice, and yet I think she knows a great
deal more than he does."</p>

<p>"I should like to know about them," Adamowski went on speculatively,
in the manner of a man who has a genuine interest in the world about
him. "These people that one meets on trains and ships--they fascinate
me. You see some strange things. And these two--they interest me. I
should like so much to know who they are."</p>

<p>"And the other man?" George said. "The little one? The nervous,
fidgety fellow who keeps staring at us--who do you suppose he is?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that one," said Adamowski indifferently, impatiently. "I do not
know. I do not care. He is some stuffy little man--it doesn't
matter...But shall we go back now?" he said. "Let's talk to them and
see if we can find out who they are. We shall never see them again
after this. I like to talk to people in trains."</p>

<p>George agreed. So his Polish friend called the waiter, asked for the
bill, and paid it--and still had ten or twelve marks left of his waning
twenty-three. Then they got up and went back through the speeding train
to their compartment.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="chapter6-42"></a>42. The Family of Earth</h2>

<p>The woman smiled at them as they came in, and all three of their 1
fellow-passengers looked at them in a way that showed wakened curiosity
and increased interest. It was evident that George and Adamowski had
themselves been subjects of speculation during their absence.</p>

<p>Adamowski now spoke to the others. His German was not very good but
it was coherent, and his deficiencies did not bother him at all. He was
so self-assured, so confirmed in his self-possession, that he could
plunge boldly into conversation in a foreign language with no sense
whatever of personal handicap. Thus encouraged, the three Germans now
gave free expression to their curiosity, to the speculations which the
meeting of George and Adamowski and their apparent recognition of each
other had aroused.</p>

<p>The woman asked Adamowski where he came from--"<i>Was fur ein
Landsmann sind sie?</i>"</p>

<p>He replied that he was an American.</p>

<p>"<i>Ach, so?</i>" She looked surprised, then added quickly: "But not
by birth? You were not born in America?"</p>

<p>"No," said Adamowski. "I am Polish by birth. But I live in America
now. And my friend here"--they all turned to stare curiously at
George---"is an American by birth."</p>

<p>They nodded in satisfaction. And the woman, smiling with
good-humoured and eager interest, said:</p>

<p>"And your friend--he is an artist, isn't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Adamowski.</p>

<p>"A painter?" The woman's tone was almost gleeful as she pursued
further confirmation of her own predictions.</p>

<p>"He is not a painter. He is <i>ein Dichter</i>."</p>

<p>The word means "poet", and George quickly amended it to "<i>ein
Schriftsteller</i>"--a writer.</p>

<p>All three of them thereupon looked at one another with nods of
satisfaction, saying, ah, they thought so, it was evident. Old
Fussand-Fidget even spoke up now, making the sage observation that it
was apparent "from the head". The others nodded again, and the woman
then turned once more to Adamowski, saying:</p>

<p>"But you--you are not an artist, are you? You do something
else?"</p>

<p>He replied that he was a business man--"<i>ein
Gesch&auml;ftsmann</i>"--that he lived in New York, and that his
business was in Wall Street. The name apparently had imposing
connotations for them, for they all nodded in an impressed manner and
said "Ali!" again.</p>

<p>George and Adamowski went on then and told them of the manner of
their meeting, how they had never seen each other before that morning,
but how each of them had known of the other through many mutual
friends. This news delighted everyone. It was a complete confirmation
of what they had themselves inferred. The little blonde lady nodded
triumphantly and burst out in excited conversation with her companion
and with Fuss-and-Fidget, saying:</p>

<p>"What did I tell you? I said the same thing, didn't I? It's a small
world after all, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Now they were all really wonderfully at ease with one another, all
talking eagerly, excitedly, naturally, like old friends who had just
met after a long separation. The little lady began to tell them all
about herself. She and her husband, she said, were proprietors of a
business near the Alexander-platz. No--smiling--the young man was not
her husband. He, too, was a young artist, and was employed by her. In
what sort of business? She laughed--one would never guess. She and her
husband manufactured manikins for show-window displays. No, it was not
a shop, exactly--there was a trace of modest pride here--it was more
like a little factory. They made their own figures. Their business, she
implied, was quite a large one. She said that they employed over fifty
workers, and formerly had had almost a hundred. That was why she had to
go to Paris as often as she could, for Paris set the fashion in
manikins just as it did in clothes.</p>

<p>Of course, they did not buy the Paris models. <i>Mein
Gott!</i>--that was impossible with the money situation what it was.
Nowadays it was hard enough for a German business person even to get
out of his own country, much less to buy anything abroad. Nevertheless,
hard as it was, she had to get to Paris somehow once or twice a year,
just in order to keep up with "what was going on." She always took an
artist with her, and this young man was making his first trip in this
capacity. He was a sculptor by profession, but he earned money for his
art by doing commercial work in her business. He would make designs and
draw models of the latest show-window manikins in Paris, and would
duplicate them when he returned; then the factory would turn them out
by the hundreds.</p>

<p>Adamowski remarked that he did not see how it was possible, under
present circumstances, for a German citizen to travel anywhere. It had
become difficult enough for a foreigner to get in and out of Germany.
The money complications were so confusing and so wearisome.</p>

<p>George added to this an account of the complications that had
attended his own brief journey to the Austrian Tyrol. Ruefully he
displayed the pocketful of papers, permits, visas, and official stamps
which he had accumulated during the summer.</p>

<p>Upon this common grievance they were all vociferously agreed. The
lady affirmed that it was stupid, exhausting, and, for a German with
business outside the country, almost impossible. She added quickly,
loyally, that of course it was also necessary. But then she went on to
relate that her three-or four-day trips to Paris could only be managed
through some complicated trade arrangement and business connection in
France, and as she tried to explain the necessary details of the plan
she became so involved in the bewildering complexities of cheques and
balances that she finally ended by waving her hand charmingly in a
gesture of exhausted dismissal, saying:</p>

<p>"<i>Ach, Gott!</i> It is all too complicated, too confusing! I
cannot tell you how it is--I do not understand it myself!"</p>

<p>Old Fuss-and-Fidget put in here with confirmations of his own. He
was, he said, an attorney in Berlin--"<i>ein Rechtsanwalt</i>"--and had
formerly had extensive professional connections in France and in other
portions of the Continent. He had visited America as well, and had been
there as recently as 1930, when he had attended an international
congress of lawyers in New York. He even spoke a little English, which
he unveiled with evident pride. And he was going now, he said, to
another international congress of lawyers which was to open in Paris
the next day, and which would last a week. But even so brief a trip as
this now had its serious difficulties. As for his former professional
activities in other countries, they were now, alas, impossible.</p>

<p>He asked George if any of his books had been translated and
published in Germany, and George told him they had. The others were all
eagerly and warmly curious, wanting to know the titles and George's
name. Accordingly, he wrote out for them the German titles of the
books, the name of the German publisher, and his own name. They all
looked interested and pleased. The little lady put the paper away in
her pocket-book and announced enthusiastically that she would buy the
books on her return to Germany. Fuss-and-Fidget, after carefully
copying the paper, folded the memorandum and tucked it in his wallet,
saying that he, too, would buy the books as soon as he came home
again.</p>

<p>The lady's young companion, who had shyly and diffidently, but with
growing confidence, joined in the conversation from time to time, now
took from an envelope in his pocket several postcard photographs of
sculptures he had made. They were pictures of muscular athletes,
runners, wrestlers, miners stripped to the waist, and the voluptuous
figures of young nude girls. These photographs were passed round,
inspected by each of them, and praised and admired for various
qualities.</p>

<p>Adamowski now picked up his bulky paper package, explained that it
was filled with good things from his brother's estate in Poland, opened
it, and invited everyone to partake. There were some splendid pears and
peaches, some fine bunches of grapes, a plump broiled chicken, some fat
squabs and partridges, and various other delicacies. The three Germans
protested that they could not deprive him of his lunch. But Adamowski
insisted vigorously, with the warmth of generous hospitality that was
obviously characteristic of his nature. On the spur of the moment he
reversed an earlier decision and informed them that he and George were
going to the dining-car for luncheon anyway, and that if they did not
eat the food in the package it would go to waste. On this condition
they all helped themselves to fruit, which they pronounced delicious,
and the lady promised that she would later investigate the chicken.</p>

<p>At length, with friendly greetings all round, George and his</p>

<p>Polish friend departed a second time and went forward to the
<i>Speisewagen</i>.</p>

<p>They had a long and sumptuous meal. It began with brandy, proceeded
over a fine bottle of Bernkasteler, and wound up over coffee and more
brandy. They were both determined to spend the remainder of their
German money--Adamowski his ten or twelve marks, George his five or
six--and this gave them a comfortable feeling in which astute economy
was thriftily combined with good living.</p>

<p>During the meal they discussed their companions again. They were
delighted with them and immensely interested in the information they
had gathered from them. The woman, they both agreed, was altogether
charming. And the young man, although diffident and shy, was very nice.
They even had a word of praise for old Fussand-Fidget now. After his
crusty shell had been cracked, the old codger was not bad. He really
was quite friendly underneath.</p>

<p>"And it goes to show," said Adamowski quietly, "how good people
really are, how easy it is to get along with one another in this world,
how people really like each other--if only----"</p>

<p>"--if only----" George said, and nodded.</p>

<p>"--if only it weren't for these God-damned politicians," Adamowski
concluded.</p>

<p>At the end they called for their bill. Adamowski dumped his marks
upon the table and counted them.</p>

<p>"You'll have to help me out," he said. "How many have you got?"</p>

<p>George dumped his out. Together, they had enough to pay the bill and
to give the waiter something extra. And there was also enough left over
for another double jolt of brandy and a good cigar.</p>

<p>So, grinning with satisfaction, in which their waiter joined amiably
as he read their purpose, they paid the bill, ordered the brandy and
cigars, and, full of food, drink, and the pleasant knowledge of a job
well done, they puffed contentedly on their cigars and observed the
landscape.</p>

<p>They were now running through the great industrial region of western
Germany. The pleasant landscape was gone, and everything in sight had
been darkened by the grime and smoke of enormous works. The earth was
dotted with the steely skeletons of great smelting and refining plants,
and disfigured with mountainous dumps and heaps of slag. It was brutal,
smoky, dense with life and labour and the grim warrens of industrial
towns. But these places, too, had a certain fascination--the thrill of
power in the raw.</p>

<p>The two friends talked about the scene and about their trip.
Adamowski said they had done well to spend their German money. Outside
of the Reich its exchange value would be lower, and they were already
almost at the border; since their own coach went directly through to
Paris, they would have no additional need of German currency for
porters' fees.</p>

<p>George confided to him, somewhat apprehensively, that he had some
thirty dollars in American currency for which he had no German permit.
Almost all of his last week in Berlin had been consumed, he said, in
the red tape of departure--pounding wearily from one steamship office
to another in an effort to secure passage home, cabling to Fox Edwards
for more money, then getting permits for the money. At the last moment
he had discovered that he still had thirty dollars left for which he
had no official permit. When he had gone in desperation to an
acquaintance who was an official in a travel agency, and had asked him
what to do, this man had told him wearily to put the money in his
pocket and say nothing; that if he tried now to get a permit for it and
waited for the authorities to act on it, he would miss the boat; so to
take the chance, which was, at most, he thought, a very slight one, and
go ahead.</p>

<p>Adamowski nodded in agreement, but suggested that George take the
uncertified money, thrust it in the pocket of his vest, where he would
not seem to hide it, and then, if he were discovered and questioned, he
could say that he had put the money there and had forgotten to declare
it. This he decided to do, and made the transfer then and there.</p>

<p>This conversation brought them back to the thorny problem of the
money regulations and the difficulties of their fellow-travellers who
were Germans. They agreed that the situation was hard on their
new-found friends, and that the law which permitted foreigners and
citizens alike to take only ten marks from the country, unless
otherwise allowed, was, for people in the business circumstances of the
little blonde woman and old Fuss-and-Fidget, very unfair indeed.</p>

<p>Then Adamowski had a brilliant inspiration, the fruit of his
generous and spontaneous impulses.</p>

<p>"But why----" he said--"why can't we help them?"</p>

<p>"How do you mean? In what way can we help them?"</p>

<p>"Why," he said, "I have here a permit that allows me to take
twenty-three marks out of the country. You have no permit, but everyone
is allowed----"</p>

<p>"--to take ten marks," George said. "So you mean, then," he
concluded, "that each of us has spent his German money----"</p>

<p>"--but can still take as much as is allowed out of the country.
Yes," he said. "So we could at least suggest it to them."</p>

<p>"You mean that they should give us some of their marks to keep in
our possession until we get across the frontier?"</p>

<p>Adamowski nodded. "Yes. I could take twenty-three. You could take
ten. It is not much, of course, but it might help."</p>

<p>No sooner said than seized upon. They were almost jubilantly elated
at this opportunity to do some slight service for these people to whom
they had taken such, a liking. But even as they sat there smiling
confirmation at each other, a man in uniform came through the car,
paused at their table--which was the only one now occupied, all the
other diners having departed--and authoritatively informed them that
the Pass-Control had come aboard the train, and that they must return
at once to their compartment to await examination.</p>

<p>They got up immediately and hastened back through the swaying
coaches. George led the way, and Adamowski whispered at his shoulder
that they must now make haste and propose their offer to their
companions quickly, or it would be too late.</p>

<hr align="center" width="15%">
<p>As soon as they entered the compartment they told their three German
friends that the officials were already on the train and that the
inspection would begin shortly. This announcement caused a flurry of
excitement. They all began to get ready. The woman busied herself with
her purse. She took out her passport, and then, with a worried look,
began to count her money.</p>

<p>Adamowski, after watching her quietly for a moment, took out his
certificate and held it open in his hand, remarking that he was
officially allowed twenty-three marks, that he had had that sum at the
beginning, but that now he had spent it. George took this as his cue
and said that he, too, had spent all of his German money, and that,
although he had no permit, he was allowed ten marks. The woman looked
quickly, eagerly, from one to the other and read the friendship of
their purpose.</p>

<p>"Then you mean----" she began. "But it would be wonderful, of
course, if you would!"</p>

<p>"Have you as much as twenty-three marks above what you are allowed?"
asked Adamowski.</p>

<p>"Yes," she nodded quickly, with a worried look. "I have more than
that. But if you would take the twenty-three and keep them till we are
past the frontier----"</p>

<p>He stretched out his hand. "Give them to me," he said.</p>

<p>She gave them to him instantly, and the money was in his pocket in
the wink of an eye.</p>

<p>Fuss-and-Fidget now counted out ten marks nervously, and without a
word passed them across to George. George thrust the money in his
pocket, and they all sat back, a little flushed, excited but
triumphant, trying to look composed.</p>

<p>A few minutes later an official opened the door of the compartment,
saluted, and asked for their passports. He inspected Adamowski's first,
found everything in order, took his certificate, saw his twenty-three
marks, stamped the passport, and returned it to him.</p>

<p>Then he turned to George, who gave him his passport and the various
papers certifying his possession of American currency. The official
thumbed through the pages of the passport, which were now almost
completely covered with the stamps and entries which had been made
every time George cashed a cheque for register-marks. On one page the
man paused and frowned, scrutinising carefully a stamp showing
re-entrance into Germany from Kufstein, on the Austrian border; then he
consulted again the papers George had handed him. He shook his head.
Where, he asked, was the certificate from Kufstein?</p>

<p>George's heart jumped and pounded hard. He had forgotten the
Kufstein certificate! There had been so many papers and documents of
one kind and another since then that he no longer thought the Kufstein
certificate was needed. He began to paw and thumb through the mass of
papers that remained in his pocket. The officer waited patiently, but
with an air of perturbation in his manner. Everyone else looked at
George apprehensively, except Adamowski, who said quietly:</p>

<p>"Just take your time. It ought to be there somewhere."</p>

<p>At last George found it! And as he did, his own sharp intake of
relief found echo among his companions. As for the official, he, too,
seemed glad. He smiled quite kindly, took the paper and inspected it,
and returned the passport.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, during the anxious minutes that George had taken to paw
through his papers, the official had already inspected the passports of
the woman, her companion, and Fuss-and-Fidget. Everything was
apparently in order with them, save that the lady had confessed to the
possession of forty-two marks, and the official had regretfully
informed her that he would have to take from her everything in excess
of ten. The money would be held at the frontier and restored to her, of
course, when she returned. She smiled ruefully, shrugged her shoulders,
and gave the man thirty-two marks. All other matters were now evidently
in order, for the man saluted and withdrew.</p>

<p>So it was over, then! They all drew deep breaths of relief, and
commiserated the charming lady upon her loss. But they were all quietly
jubilant, too, to know that her loss had been no greater, and that
Adamowski had been able in some degree to lessen it.</p>

<p>George asked Fuss-and-Fidget if he wanted his money returned now or
later. He replied that he thought it would be better to wait until they
had crossed the frontier into Belgium. At the same time he made a
casual remark, to which none of them paid any serious attention just
then, to the effect that for some reason, which they did not follow,
his ticket was good only to the frontier, and that he would utilise the
fifteen minutes' wait at Aachen, which was the frontier town, to buy a
ticket for the remainder of the trip to Paris.</p>

<p>They were now approaching Aachen. The train was beginning to slacken
speed. They were going once more through a lovely countryside, smiling
with green fields and gentle hills, unobtrusively, mildly, somehow
unmistakably European. The seared and blasted district of the mines and
factories was behind them. They were entering the outskirts of a
pleasant town.</p>

<p>This was Aachen. Within a few minutes more, the train was slowing to
a halt before the station. They had reached the frontier. Here there
would be a change of engines. All of them got out--Fuss-and-Fidget
evidently to get a ticket, the others to stretch their legs and get a
breath of air.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="chapter6-43"></a>43. The Capture</h2>

<p>Adamowski and George stepped out on the platform together and walked
forward to inspect the locomotive. The German engine, which had here
reached the end of its journey and would soon be supplanted by its
Belgian successor, was a magnificent machine of tremendous power and
weight, almost as big as one of the great American engines. It was
beautifully streamlined for high velocity, and its tender was a
wonderful affair, different from any other that George had ever seen.
It seemed to be a honeycomb of pipes. One looked in through some
slanting bars and saw a fountainlike display composed of thousands of
tiny little jets of steaming water. Every line of this intricate and
marvellous apparatus bore evidence of the organising skill and
engineering genius that had created it.</p>

<p>Knowing how important are the hairline moments of transition, how
vivid, swift, and fugitive are the poignant first impressions when a
traveller changes from one country to another, from one people to
another, from one standard of conduct and activity to another, George
waited with intense interest for the approach of the Belgian locomotive
in order to see what it might indicate of the differences between the
powerful, solid, and indomitable race they were leaving and the little
people whose country they were now about to enter.</p>

<p>While Adamowski and George were engaged in observations and
speculations on this subject, their own coach and another, which was
also destined for Paris, were detached from the German train and
shifted to a string of coaches on the opposite side of the platform.
They were about to hasten back when a guard informed them that they
still had ample time, and that the train was not scheduled to depart
for another five minutes. So they waited a little longer, and Adamowski
remarked that it was a pitiful evidence of the state Europe was in that
a crack train between the two greatest cities on the Continent should
be carrying only two through coaches, and these not even filled.</p>

<p>But the Belgian locomotive still did not come, and now, glancing up
at the station clock, they saw that the moment for departure had
arrived. Fearful of being left behind if they waited any longer, they
started back along the platform. They found the little blonde-haired
lady and, flanking her on each side, they hastened towards their coach
and their own compartment.</p>

<p>As they approached, it was evident that something had happened.
There were no signs of departure. The conductor and the station guard
stood together on the platform. No warning signal had been given. When
they came alongside of their car, people were clustered in the
corridor, and something in the way they stood indicated a subdued
tension, a sense of crisis, that made George's pulse beat quicker.</p>

<p>George had observed this same phenomenon several times before in the
course of his life and he knew the signs. A man has leaped or fallen,
for example, from a high building to the pavement of a city street; or
a man has been shot or struck by a motor-car, and now lies dying
quietly before the eyes of other men--and always the manifestation of
the crowd is just the same. Even before you see the faces of the
people, something about their backs, their posture, the position of
their heads and shoulders tells you what has happened. You do not know,
of course, the precise circumstances, but you sense immediately the
final stage of tragedy. You know that someone has just died or is
dying. And in the terrible eloquence of backs and shoulders, the
feeding silence of the watching men, you also sense another tragedy
which 'is even deeper. This is the tragedy of man's cruelty and his
lust for pain--the tragic weakness which corrupts him, which he
loathes, but which he cannot cure. As a child, George had seen it on
the faces of men standing before the window of a shabby little
undertaker's place, looking at the bloody, riddled carcass of a negro
which the mob had caught and killed. Again, as a boy of fourteen, he
had seen it on the faces of men and women at a dance, as they watched a
fight in which one man beat another man to death.</p>

<p>And now, here it was again. As George and his two companions
hastened along beside the train and saw the people gathered in the
corridor in that same feeding posture, waiting, watching, in that same
deadly fascinated silence, he was sure that once again he was about to
witness death.</p>

<p>That was the first thought that came to him--and it came also,
instantaneously, without a word of communication between them, to
Adamowski and the little blonde woman--the thought that someone had
died. But as they started to get on the train, what suddenly stunned
them and stopped them short, appalled, was the realisation that the
tragedy, whatever it was, had happened in their own compartment. The
shades were tightly drawn, the door closed and locked, the whole place
sealed impenetrably. They stared in silence, rooted to the platform.
Then they saw the woman's young companion standing at the window in the
corridor. He motioned to them quickly, stealthily, a gesture warning
them to remain where they were. And as he did so it flashed over all
three of them that the victim of this tragic visitation must be the
nervous little man who had been the companion of their voyage since
morning. The stillness of the scene and the shuttered blankness of that
closed compartment were horrible. They all felt sure that this little
man who had begun by being so disagreeable, but who had gradually come
out of his shell and become their friend, and to whom they had all been
talking only fifteen minutes before, had died, and that authority and
the law were now enclosed there with his body in the official ceremony
that society demands.</p>

<p>Even as they stared appalled and horror-stricken at that fatally
curtained compartment, the lock clicked sharply, the door was opened
and closed quickly, and an official came out. He was a burly fellow in
a visored cap and a jacket of olive green--a man of forty-five or more
with high, blunt cheek-bones, a florid face, and tawny moustaches
combed out sprouting in the Kaiser Wilhelm way. His head was shaven,
and there were thick creases at the base of his skull and across his
fleshy neck. He came out, climbed down clumsily to the platform,
signalled and called excitedly to another officer, and climbed back
into the train again.</p>

<p>He belonged to a familiar and well-known type, one which George had
seen and smiled at often, but one which now became, under these ominous
and unknown circumstances, sinisterly unpleasant. The man's very weight
and clumsiness, the awkward way he got down from the train and climbed
up again, the thickness of his waist, the width and coarseness of his
lumbering buttocks, the way his sprouting moustaches quivered with
passion and authority, the sound of his guttural voice as he shouted to
his fellow-officer, his puffing, panting air of official
indignation--all these symptoms which ran true to type now became
somehow loathsome and repellent. All of a sudden, without knowing why,
George felt himself trembling with a murderous and incomprehensible
anger. He wanted to smash that fat neck with the creases in it. He
wanted to pound that inflamed and blunted face into a jelly. He wanted
to kick square and hard, bury his foot dead centre in the obscene
fleshiness of those lumbering buttocks. Like all Americans, he had
never liked the police and the kind of personal authority that is
sanctified in them. But his present feeling, with its murderous rage,
was a good deal more than that. For he knew that he was helpless, that
all of them were, and he felt impotent, shackled, unable to stir
against the walls of an unreasonable but unshakable authority.</p>

<p>The official with the sprouting moustaches, accompanied by the
colleague he had summoned, opened the curtained door of the compartment
again, and now George saw that two other officers were inside. And the
nervous little man who had been their companion--no, he was not
dead!--he sat all huddled up, facing them. His face was white and
pasty. It looked greasy, as if it were covered with a salve of cold,
fat sweat. Under his long nose his mouth was trembling in a horrible
attempt at a smile. And in the very posture of the two men as they bent
over him and questioned him there was something revolting and
unclean.</p>

<p>But the official with the thick, creased neck had now filled the
door and blotted out the picture. He went in quickly, followed by his
colleague. The door closed behind them, and again there was nothing but
the drawn curtains and that ill-omened secrecy.</p>

<p>All the people who had gathered round had got this momentary glimpse
and had simply looked on with stupefied surprise. Now those who stood
in the corridor of the train began to whisper to one another. The
little blonde woman went over and carried on a whispered conversation
with the young man and several other people who were standing at the
open window. After conferring with them with subdued but growing
excitement for a minute or two, she came back, took George and
Adamowski by the arm, and whispered:</p>

<p>"Come over here. There is something I want to tell you."</p>

<p>She led them across the platform, out of hearing. Then, as both of
the men said in lowered voices: "What is it?"--she looked round
cautiously and whispered:</p>

<p>"That man--the one in our compartment--he was trying to get out of
the country--and they've caught him!"</p>

<p>"But why? What for? What has he done?" they asked, bewildered.</p>

<p>Again she glanced back cautiously and, drawing them together till
their three heads were almost touching, she said in a secretive whisper
that was full of awe and fright:</p>

<p>"They say he is a Jew! And they found money on him! They searched
him--they searched his baggage--he was taking money out!"</p>

<p>"How much?" asked Adamowski.</p>

<p>"I don't know," she whispered. "A great deal, I think. A hundred
thousand marks, some say. Anyhow, they found it!"</p>

<p>"But how?" George began. "I thought everything was finished. I
thought they were done with all of us when they went through the
train."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. "But don't you remember something about the ticket?
He said something about not having a ticket the whole way. I suppose he
thought it would be safer--wouldn't arouse suspicion in Berlin if he
bought a ticket only to Aachen. So he got off the train here to buy his
ticket for Paris--and that's when they caught him!" she whispered.
"They must had have their eye on him! They must have suspected him!
That's why they didn't question him when they came through the train!"
George remembered now that "they" had not. "But they were watching for
him, and they caught him here!" she went on. "They asked him where he
was going, and he said to Paris. They asked him how much money he was
taking out. He said ten marks. Then they asked him how long he was
going to remain in Paris, and for what purpose, and he said he was
going to be there a week, attending this congress of lawyers that he
spoke about. They asked him, then, how he proposed to stay in Paris a
week if all he had was ten marks. And I think," she whispered, "that
that's where he got frightened! He began to lose his head! He said he
had twenty marks besides, which he had put into another pocket and
forgotten. And then, of course, they had him! They searched him! They
searched his baggage! And they found more"--she whispered in an awed
tone--"much, much more!"</p>

<p>They all stared at one another, too stunned to say a word. Then the
woman laughed in a low, frightened sort of way, a little, uncertain:
"O-hoh-hoh-hoh-hoh," ending on a note of incredulity.</p>

<p>"This man"--she whispered again--"this little Jew----".</p>

<p>"I didn't know he was a Jew," George said. "I should not have
thought so."</p>

<p>"But he is!" she whispered, and looked stealthily round again to see
if they were being overheard or watched. "And he was doing what so many
of the others have done--he was trying to get out with his money!"
Again she laughed, the uncertain little "Hohhoh-hoh" that mounted to
incredulous amazement. Yet George saw that her eyes were troubled,
too.</p>

<p>All of a sudden George felt sick, empty, nauseated. Turning half
away, he thrust his hands into his pockets--and drew them out as though
his fingers had been burned. The man's money--he still had it!
Deliberately, now, he put his hand into his pocket again and felt the
five two-mark pieces. The coins seemed greasy, as if they were covered
with sweat. George took them out and closed them in his fist and
started across the platform towards the train. The woman seized him by
the arm.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" she gasped. "What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to give the man his money. I won't see him again. I can't
keep it."</p>

<p>Her face went white. "Are you mad?" she whispered. "Don't you know
that that will do no good? You'll only get yourself arrested! And, as
for him--he's in trouble enough already. You'll only make it so much
worse for him. And besides," she faltered, "God knows what he has done,
what he has said already. If he has lost his head completely--if he has
told that we have transferred money to one another--we'll all be in for
it!"</p>

<p>They had not thought of this. And as they realised the possible
consequences of their good intentions, they just stood there, all
three, and stared helplessly at one another. They just stood there,
feeling dazed and weak and hollow. They just stood there and
prayed.</p>

<p>And now the officers were coming out of the compartment. The
curtained door opened again, and the fellow with the sprouting
moustaches emerged, carrying the little man's valise. He clambered down
clumsily onto the platform and set the valise on the floor between his
feet. He looked round. It seemed to George and the others that he
glared at them. They just stood still and hardly dared to breathe. They
thought they were in for it, and expected now to see all of their own
baggage come out.</p>

<p>But in a moment the other three officials came through the door of
the compartment with the little man between them. They stepped down to
the platform and marched him along, white as a sheet, grease standing
out in beads all over his face, protesting volubly in a voice that had
a kind of anguished lilt in it. He came right by the others as they
stood there. The man's money sweated in George's hand, and he did not
know what to do. He made a movement with his arm and started to speak
to him. At the same time he was hoping desperately that the man would
not speak. George tried to look away from him, but could not. The
little man came towards them, protesting with every breath that the
whole thing could be explained, that it was an absurd mistake. For just
the flick of an instant as he passed the others he stopped talking,
glanced at them, white-faced, still smiling his horrible little forced
smile of terror; for just a moment his eyes rested on them, and then,
without a sign of recognition, without betraying them, without giving
any indication that he knew them, he went on by.</p>

<p>George heard the woman at his side sigh faintly and felt her body
slump against him. They all felt weak, drained of their last energies.
Then they walked slowly across the platform and got into the train.</p>

<p>The evil tension had been snapped now. People were talking
feverishly, still in low tones but with obvious released excitement.
The little blonde woman leaned from the window of the corridor and
spoke to the fellow with the sprouting moustaches, who was still
standing there.</p>

<p>"You--you're not going to let him go?" she asked hesitantly, almost
in a whisper. "Are--are you going to keep him here?"</p>

<p>He looked at her stolidly. Then a slow, intolerable smile broke
across his brutal features. He nodded his head deliberately, with the
finality of a gluttonous and full-fed satisfaction:</p>

<p>"<i>Ja</i>," he said. "<i>Er bleibt</i>." And, shaking his head ever
so slightly from side to side: "<i>Geht nicht</i>!" he said.</p>

<p>They had him. Far down the platform the passengers heard the shrill,
sudden fife of the Belgian engine whistle. The guard cried warning. All
up and down the train the doors were slammed. Slowly the train began to
move. At a creeping pace it rolled right past the little man. They had
him, all right. The officers surrounded him. He stood among them, still
protesting, talking with his hands now. And the men in uniform said
nothing. They had no need to speak. They had him. They just stood and
watched him, each with a faint suggestion of that intolerable slow
smile upon his face. They raised their eyes and looked at the
passengers as the train rolled past, and the line of travellers
standing in the corridors looked back at them and caught the obscene
and insolent communication in their glance and in that intolerable slow
smile.</p>

<p>And the little man--he, too, paused once from his feverish effort to
explain. As the car in which he had been riding slid by, he lifted his
pasty face and terror-stricken eyes, and for a moment his lips were
stilled of their anxious pleading. He looked once, directly and
steadfastly, at his former companions, and they at him. And in that
gaze there was all the unmeasured weight of man's mortal anguish.
George and the others felt somehow naked and ashamed, and somehow
guilty. They all felt that they were saying farewell, not to a man, but
to humanity; not to some pathetic stranger, some chance acquaintance of
the voyage, but to mankind; not to some nameless cipher out of life,
but to the fading image of a brother's face.</p>

<p>The train swept out and gathered speed--and so they lost him:</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="chapter6-44"></a>44. The Way of no Return</h2>

<p>"Well," said Adamowski, turning to George, "I think this is a sad
end to our journey."</p>

<p>George nodded but said nothing. Then they all went back into their
compartment and took their former seats.</p>

<p>But it seemed strange and empty now. The ghost of absence sat there
ruinously. The little man had left his coat and hat; in his anguish he
had forgotten them. Adamowski rose and took them; and would have given
them to the conductor, but the woman said:</p>

<p>"You'd better look into the pockets first. There may be something in
them. Perhaps"--quickly, eagerly, as the idea took her--"perhaps he has
left money there," she whispered.</p>

<p>Adamowski searched the pockets. There was nothing of any value in
them. He shook his head. The woman began to search the cushions of the
seats, thrusting her hands down around the sides.</p>

<p>"It might just be, you know," she said, "that he hid money here."
She laughed excitedly, almost gleefully. "Perhaps we'll all be
rich!"</p>

<p>The young Pole shook his head. "I think they would have found it if
he had." He paused, peered out of the window, and thrust his his hand
into his pocket. "I suppose we're in Belgium now," he said. "Here's
your money." And he returned to her the twenty-three marks she had
given him.</p>

<p>She took the money and put it in her purse. George still had the
little man's ten marks in his hand and was looking at them. The woman
glanced up, saw his face, then said quickly, warmly: "But you're upset
about this thing! You look so troubled."</p>

<p>George put the money away. Then he said:</p>

<p>"I feel exactly as if I had blood-money in my pocket."</p>

<p>"No," she said. She leaned over, smiling, and put her hand
reassuringly upon his arm. "Not blood-money--Jew-money!" she whispered.
"Don't worry about it. He had plenty more!" George's eyes met
Adamowski's. Both were grave.</p>

<p>"This is a sad ending to our trip," Adamowski said again, in a low
voice, almost to himself.</p>

<p>The woman tried to talk them out of their depression, to talk
herself into forgetfulness. She made an effort to laugh and joke.</p>

<p>"These Jews!" she cried. "Such things would never happen if it were
not for them! They make all the trouble. Germany has had to protect
herself. The Jews were taking all the money from the country. Thousands
of them escaped, taking millions of marks with them. And now, when it's
too late, we wake up to it! It's too bad that foreigners must see these
things--that they've got to go through these painful experiences--it
makes a bad impression. They don't understand the reason. But it's the
Jews!" she whispered.</p>

<p>The others said nothing, and the woman went on talking, eagerly,
excitedly, earnestly, persuasively. But it was as if she were trying to
convince herself, as if every instinct of race and loyalty were now
being used in an effort to excuse or justify something that had filled
her with sorrow and deep shame. For even as she talked and laughed, her
clear blue eyes were sad and full of trouble. And at length she gave it
up and stopped. There was a heavy silence. Then, gravely, quietly, the
woman said:</p>

<p>"He must have wanted very badly to escape."</p>

<p>They remembered, then, all that he had said and done throughout the
journey. They recalled how nervous he had been, how he had kept opening
and shutting the door, how he had kept getting up to pace along the
corridor. They spoke of the suspicion and distrust with which he had
peered round at them when he first came in, and of the eagerness with
which he had asked Adamowski to change places with him when the Pole
had got up to go into the dining-car with George. They recalled his
explanations about the ticket, about having to buy passage from the
frontier to Paris. All of these things, every act and word and gesture
of the little man, which they had dismissed at the time as trivial or
as evidence simply of an irascible temper, now became invested with a
new and terrible meaning.</p>

<p>"But the ten marks!" the woman cried at length, turning to George.
"Since he had all this other money, why, in God's name, did he give ten
marks to you? It was so stupid!" she exclaimed in an exasperated tone.
"There was no reason for it!"</p>

<p>Certainly they could find no reason, unless he had done it to divert
suspicion from their minds about his true intent. This was Adamowski's
theory, and it seemed to satisfy the woman. But George thought it more
likely that the little man was in such a desperate state of nervous
frenzy and apprehension that he had lost the power to reason clearly
and had acted blindly, wildly, on the impulse of the moment. But they
did not know. And now they would never find out the answer.</p>

<p>George was still worried about getting the man's ten marks returned
to him. The woman said that she had given the man her name and her
address in Paris, and that if he were later allowed to complete his
journey he could find her there. George then gave her his own address
in Paris and asked her to inform the man where he was if she should
hear from him. She promised, but they all knew that she would never
hear from him again.</p>

<p>Late afternoon had come. The country had closed in around them. The
train was winding through a pleasant, romantic landscape of hills and
woods. In the slant of evening and the waning light there was a sense
of deep, impenetrable forest and of cool, darkling waters.</p>

<p>They had long since passed the frontier, but the woman, who had been
looking musingly and a little anxiously out of the window, hailed the
conductor as he passed along the corridor and asked him if they were
really in Belgium now. He assured her that they were. Adamowski gave
him the little man's hat and coat, and explained the reason. The
conductor nodded, took them, and departed.</p>

<p>The woman had her hand upon her breast, and now when the conductor
had gone she sighed slowly with relief. Then, quietly and simply, she
said:</p>

<p>"Do not misunderstand me. I am a German and I love my country.
But--I feel as if a weight has lifted from me <i>here</i>." She put her
hand upon her breast again. "You cannot understand, perhaps, just how
it feels to us, but--" and for a moment she was silent, as if painfully
meditating what she wished to say. Then, quickly, quietly: "We are so
happy to be--<i>out!</i>"</p>

<p><i>Out?</i> Yes, that was it. Suddenly George knew just how she
felt. He, too, was "out" who was a stranger to her land, and yet who
never had been a stranger in it. He, too, was "out" of that great
country whose image had been engraved upon his spirit in childhood and
youth, before he had ever seen it. He, too, was "out" of that land
which had been so much more to him than land, so much more than place.
It had been a geography of heart's desire, an unfathomed domain of
unknown inheritance. The haunting beauty of that magic land had been
his soul's dark wonder. He had known the language of its spirit before
he ever came to it, had understood the language of its tongue the
moment he had heard it spoken. He had framed the accents of its speech
most brokenly from that first hour, yet never with a moment's trouble,
strangeness, or lack of comprehension. He bad been at home in it, and
it in him. It seemed that he had been born with this knowledge.</p>

<p>He had known wonder in this land, truth and magic in it, sorrow,
loneliness, and pain in it. He had known love in it, and for the first
time in his life he had tasted there the bright, delusive sacraments of
fame. Therefore it was no foreign land to him. It was the other part of
his heart's home, a haunted part of dark desire, a magic domain of
fulfilment. It was the dark, lost Helen that had been forever burning
in his blood--the dark, lost Helen he had found.</p>

<p>And now it was the dark, found Helen he had lost. And he knew now,
as he had never known before, the priceless measure of his loss. He
knew also the priceless measure of his gain. For this was the way that
henceforth would be forever closed to him--the way of no return. He was
"out". And, being "out", he began to see another way, the way that lay
before him. He saw now that you can't go home again--not ever. There
was no road back. Ended now for him, with the sharp and clean finality
of the closing of a door, was the time when his dark roots, like those
of a pot-bound plant, could be left to feed upon their own substance
and nourish their own little self-absorbed designs. Henceforth they
must spread outward--away from the hidden, secret, and unfathomed past
that holds man's spirit prisoner--outward, outward towards the rich and
life-giving soil of a new freedom in the wide world of all humanity.
And there came to him a vision of man's true home, beyond the ominous
and cloud-engulfed horizon of the here and now, in the green and
hopeful and still-virgin meadows of the future.</p>

<p>"Therefore," he thought, "old master, wizard Faust, old father of
the ancient and swarm-haunted mind of man, old earth, old German land
with all the measure of your truth, your glory, beauty, magic, and your
ruin; and dark Helen burning in our blood, great queen and mistress,
sorceress--dark land, dark land, old ancient earth I
love--farewell!"</p>

<h2><a name="book7"></a>BOOK VII. - A WIND IS RISING, AND THE RIVERS
FLOW</h2>

<p><i>The experiences of that final summer in Germany had a profound
effect upon George Webber. He had come face to face with something old
and genuinely evil in the spirit of man which he had never known
before, and it shook his inner world to its foundations. Not that it
produced a sudden revolution in his way of thinking. For years his
conception of the world and of his own place in it had been gradually
changing, and the German adventure merely brought this process to its
climax. It threw into sharp relief many other related phenomena which
George had observed in the whole temper of the times, and it made plain
to him, once and for all, the dangers that lurk in those latent
atavistic urges which man has inherited from his dark past.</i></p>

<p><i>Hitlerism, he saw, was a recrudescence of an old barbarism. Its
racial nonsense and cruelty, its naked worship of brute force, its
suppression of truth and resort to lies and myths, its ruthless
contempt for the individual, its anti-intellectual and anti-moral dogma
that to one man alone belongs the right of judgment and decision, and
that for all others virtue lies in blind, unquestioning obedience--each
of these fundamental elements of Hitlerism was a throwback to that
fierce and ancient tribalism which had sent waves of hairy Teutons
swooping down out of the north to destroy the vast edifice of Roman
civilisation. That primitive spirit of greed and lust and force had
always been the true enemy of mankind.</i></p>

<p><i>But this spirit was not confined to Germany. It belonged to no
one race. It was a terrible part of the universal heritage of man. One
saw traces of it everywhere. It took on many disguises, many labels.
Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin--each had his own name for it. And America
had it, too, in various forms. For wherever ruthless men conspired
together for their own ends, wherever the rule of dog-eat-dog was
dominant, there it bred. And wherever one found it, one also found that
its roots sank down into something primitive in man's ugly past. And
these roots would somehow have to be eradicated, George felt, if man
was to win his ultimate freedom and not be plunged back into savagery
and perish utterly from the earth.</i></p>

<p><i>When George realised all this he began to look for atavistic
yearnings in himself. He found plenty of them. Any man can find them if
he is honest enough to look for them. The whole year that followed his
return from Germany, George occupied himself with this effort of
self-appraisal. And at the end of it he knew, and with the knowledge
came the definite sense of new direction towards which he had long been
groping, that the dark ancestral cave, the womb from which mankind
emerged into the light, forever pulls one back--but that you can*
go home again.</i></p>

<blockquote>[* The 1947 UK edition was used to make this ebook. In
that edition the word "can" appears. In another edition the word
"can't" appears.<br>--ebook editor.]</blockquote>

<p><i>The phrase had many implications for, him. You can't go back home
to your family, back home to your childhood, back home to romantic
love, back home to a young man's dreams of glory and of fame, back home
to exile, to escape to Europe and some foreign land, back home to
lyricism, to singing just for singing's sake, back home to
aestheticism, to one's youthful idea of "the artist" and the
all-sufficiency of "art" and "beauty" and "love", back home to the
ivory tower, back home to places in the country, to the cottage in
Bermuda, away from all the strife and conflict of the world, back home
to the father you have lost and have been looking for, back home to
someone who can help you, save you, ease the burden for you, back home
to the old forms and systems of things which once seemed everlasting
but which are changing all the time--back home to the escapes of Time
and Memory.</i></p>

<p><i>In a way, the phrase summed up everything he had ever learned.
And what he now knew led inexorably to a decision which was the hardest
he had ever bad to make. Throughout the year he wrestled with it,
talked about it with his friend and editor, Foxhall Edwards, and fought
against doing what he realised he would have to do. For the time had
come to leave Fox Edwards. They bad reached a parting of the ways. Not
that Fox was one of the new barbarians. God, no! But Fox--well,
Fox--Fox understood. And George knew that whatever happened, Fox would
always remain his friend.</i></p>

<p><i>So in the end, after all their years together, they parted. And
when it was over, George sat down and wrote to Fox. He wanted to leave
the record clear. And this is what he wrote:</i></p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="chapter7-45"></a>45. Young Icarus</h2>

<p>I have of late, dear Fox [George wrote], been thinking of you very I
much, and of your strange but most familiar face. I never knew a man
like you before, and if I had not known you, I never could have
imagined you. And yet, to me you are inevitable, so that, having known
you, I cannot imagine what life would have been for me without you. You
were a polestar in my destiny. You were the magic thread in the great
web which, being woven now, is finished and complete: the circle of our
lives rounds out, full swing, and each of us in his own way now has
rounded it: there is no further circle we can make. This, too--the end
as the beginning--was inevitable: therefore, dear friend and parent of
my youth, farewell.</p>

<p>Nine years have passed since first I waited in your vestibule. And I
was not repulsed. No: I was taken in, was welcomed, was picked up and
sustained just when my spirit reached its lowest ebb, was given life
and hope, the restoration of my self-respect, the vindication of my
self-belief, the renewal of my faith by the assurance of your own
belief; and I was carried on, through all the struggle, doubt,
confusion, desperation, effort of the years that were to follow, by
your help and by the noble inspiration of your continued faith.</p>

<p>But now it ends--the road we were to go together. We two alone know
how completely it has ended. But before I go, because few men can ever
know, from first to last, a circle of such whole, superb finality, I
leave this picture of it.</p>

<p>You may think it a little premature of me to start summing up my
life at the age of thirty-seven. That is not my purpose here. But,
although thirty-seven is not an advanced age at which one can speak of
having learned many things, neither is it too early to have learned a
few. By that time a man has lived long enough to be able to look back
over the road he has come and see certain events and periods in a
proportion and a perspective which he could not have had before. And
because certain of the periods of my life represent to me, as I now
look back on them, stages of marked change and development, not only in
the spirit which animates the work I do, but also in my views on men
and living, and my own relation to the world, I am going to tell you
about them. Believe me, it is not egotism that prompts me to do this.
As you will see, my whole experience swings round, as though through a
pre-destined orbit, to you, to this moment, to this parting. So bear
with me--and then, farewell.</p>

<p>To begin at the beginning (all is clear from start to finish):</p>

<p>Twenty years ago, when I was seventeen years old and a sophomore at
Pink Rock College, I was very fond, along with many of my fellows, of
talking about my "philosophy of life". That was one of our favourite
subjects of conversation, and we were most earnest about it. I'm not
sure now what my "philosophy" was at that time, but I am sure I had
one. Everybody had. We were deep in philosophy at Pine Rock. We juggled
such formidable terms as "concepts", "categorical imperatives", and
"moments of negation" in a way that would have made Spinoza blush.</p>

<p>And if I do say so, I was no slouch at it myself. At the age of
seventeen I had an A-1 rating as a philosopher. "Concepts" held no
terrors for my young life, and "moments of negation" were my meat. I
could split a hair with the best of them. And now that I have turned to
boasting, I may as well tell you that I made a One in Logic, and it was
said to be the only One that had been given in that course for many a
year. So when it comes to speaking of philosophy, I am, you see, a
fellow who is privileged to speak.</p>

<p>I don't know how it goes with students of this generation, but to
those of us who were in college twenty years ago philosophy was serious
business. We were always talking about "God". In our interminable
discussions we were for ever trying to get at the inner essence of
"truth", "goodness", and "beauty". We were full of notions about all
these things. And I do not laugh at them to-day. We were young, we were
impassioned, and we were sincere.</p>

<p>One of the most memorable events-of my college career occurred one
day at noon when I was walking up a campus path and encountered, coming
towards me, one of my classmates whose name was D. T. Jones. D.
T.--sometimes known more familiarly as Delirium Tremens--was also a
philosopher. And the moment I saw him approaching I knew that D. T. was
in the throes. He came from a family of Primitive Baptists, and he was
red-haired, gaunt, and angular, and now as he came towards me
everything about him--hair, eyebrows, eyelids, eyes, freckles, even his
large and bony hands--shone forth in the sunlight with an excessive and
almost terrifying redness.</p>

<p>He was coming up from a noble wood in which we held initiations and
took our Sunday strolls. It was also the sacred grove to which we
resorted, alone, when we were struggling with the problems of
philosophy. It was where we went when we were going through what was
known as "the wilderness experience", and it was the place from which,
when "the wilderness experience" was done, we triumphantly emerged.</p>

<p>D. T. was emerging now. He had been there, he told me later, all
night long. His "wilderness experience" had been a good one. He came
bounding towards me like a kangaroo, leaping into the air at intervals,
and the only words he said were:</p>

<p>"I've had a Concept!"</p>

<p>Then, leaving me stunned and leaning for support against an ancient
tree, he passed on down the path, high-bounding every step or two, to
carry the great news to the whole brotherhood.</p>

<p>And still I do not laugh at it. We took philosophy seriously in
those days, and each of us had his own. And, together, we had our own
"Philosopher". He was a venerable and noble-hearted man--one of those
great figures which almost every college had some years ago, and which
I hope they still have. For half a century he had been a dominant
figure in the life of the entire state. In his teaching he was a
Hegelian. The process of his scholastic reasoning was intricate: it
came up out of ancient Greece and followed through the whole series of
"developments" down to Hegel. After Hegel--well, he did not supply the
answer. But it didn't matter, for <i>after</i> Hegel we had
<i>him</i>--he was our own Old Man.</p>

<p>Our Philosopher's "philosophy", as I look back upon it, does not
seem important now. It seems to have been, at best, a tortuous and
patched-up scheme of other men's ideas. But what <i>was</i> important
was the man himself. He was a great teacher, and what he did for us,
and for others before us for fifty years, was not to give us his
"philosophy"--but to communicate to us his own alertness, his
originality, his power to think. He was a vital force because he
supplied to many of us, for the first time in our lives, the
inspiration of a questioning intelligence. He taught us not to be
afraid to think, to question; he taught us to examine critically the
most sacrosanct of our native prejudices and superstitions. So of
course, throughout the state, the bigots hated him; but his own
students worshipped him to idolatry. And the seed he planted grew--long
after Hegel, "concepts", "moments of negation", and all the rest of it
had vanished into the limbo of forgotten things.</p>

<p>It was at about this time that I began to write. I was editor of the
college newspaper, and I wrote stories and poems for our literary
magazine, <i>The Burr</i>, of which I was also a member of the
editorial staff. The war was going on then. I was too young to be in
service, but my first literary attempts may be traced to the patriotic
inspiration of the war. I remember one poem (my first, I believe) which
was aimed directly at the luckless head of Kaiser Bill. It was called,
defiantly: "The Gauntlet", and was written in the style and meter of
"The Present Crisis", by James Russell Lowell. I remember, too, that it
took a high note from the very beginning. The poet, it is said, is the
prophet and the bard--the awakened tongue of all his folk. I was all of
that. In the name of embattled democracy I let the Kaiser have the
works. And I remember two lines in particular that seemed to me to ring
out with the very voice of outraged Freedom:</p>

<blockquote>"Thou hast given us the challenge--<br>
Pay, thou dog, the cost, and go!"</blockquote>

<p>I remember these lines because they were the occasion of an
editorial argument. The more conservative members of the magazine's
staff felt that the epithet, "thou dog", was too strong--not that the
Kaiser didn't deserve it, but that it jarred rudely upon the high moral
elevation of the poem and upon the literary quality of <i>The Burr</i>.
Over my vigorous protest, and without regard for the meter of the line,
the two words were deleted.</p>

<p>Another poem that I wrote that year was a cheerful one about a
peasant in a Flanders field who ploughed up a skull, and then went on
quietly about his work while the great guns blasted away and "the
grinning skull its grisly secret kept". I also remember a short
story--my first--which was called "A Winchester of Virginia", and was
about the recreant son of an old family who recovered his courage and
vindicated his tarnished honour in the charge over the top that took
his life. These, so far as I can recall them, were my first creative
efforts; it will be seen what an important part the last war played in
them.</p>

<p>I mention all this merely to fix the point from which I started.
This was the beginning of the road.</p>

<p>In recent years there have been several attempts to explain what has
happened to me since that time in terms of something that happened to
me in college. I believe, Fox, that I never told you about that
episode. Not that I was ashamed of my part in it or was afraid to talk
about it. It just never came up; in a way, I had forgotten it. But now,
at this moment of our parting, I think I had better speak of it,
because it is vitally important to me to make one thing clear: that I
am not the victim or the embittered martyr of anything that ever
happened in the past. Oh, yes, there was a time, as you well know, when
I was full of bitterness. There was a time when I felt that life had
betrayed me. But that preciousness is gone now, and with it has gone my
bitterness. This is the simple truth.</p>

<p>But to get back to this episode I spoke of:</p>

<p>As you know, Fox, when my first book was published, feeling ran high
against me at home. Then it was that an effort was made to explain what
was called the "bitterness" of the book in terms of my disfranchisement
when I was at college. Now, the Pine Rock case is famous in Old
Catawba, but the names of its chief actors had been almost forgotten
when the book appeared. Then, because I was one of them, people began
to talk about the case again, and the whole horrible tragedy was
exhumed.</p>

<p>It was recalled how five of us (and God have mercy on the souls of
those others who kept silent at the time) had taken our classmate Bell
out to the playing-field one night, blindfolded him, and compelled him
to dance upon a barrel. It was recalled how he stumbled and toppled
from the barrel, fell on a broken bottle-neck, severed his jugular, and
bled to death within five minutes. It was recalled, then, how the five
of us--myself and Randy Shepperton, John Brackett, Stowell Anderson,
and Dick Carr--were expelled, brought up for trial, released in the
custody of our parents or nearest relatives, and deprived of the rights
of citizenship by legislative act.</p>

<p>All this was true. But the construction which people put upon it
when the book appeared was false. None of us, I think, was "ruined" and
"embittered"--and our later records prove that we were not. There is no
doubt that the tragic consequences of our act (and of the five who
suffered disfranchisement, at least three--I will not say which
three--were present only in the group of onlookers) left its dark and
terrible imprint on our young lives. But, as Randy whispered to me on
that dreadful night, as we stood there white-faced and helpless in the
moonlight, watching that poor boy as he bled to death:</p>

<p>"We're not guilty of anything--except of being plain damned
fools!"</p>

<p>That was the way we felt that night--all of us--as we knelt, sick
with horror, around the figure of that dying boy. And I know that was
the way Bell felt, too, for he saw the terror and remorse in our white
faces and, dying though he was, he tried to smile and speak to us. The
words would not come, but all of us knew that if he could have spoken
he would have said that he was sorry for us--that he knew there was no
evil in us--no evil but our own stupidity.</p>

<p>We had killed the boy--our thoughtless folly killed him--but with
his dying breath that would have been his only judgment on us. And we
broke the heart of Plato Grant, our Old Man, our own Philosopher; but
all <i>he</i> said to us that night as he turned towards us from poor
Bell was, quietly:</p>

<p>"My God, boys, what have you done?"</p>

<p>And that was all. Even Bell's father said no more to us. And after
the first storm had passed, the cry of outrage and indignation that
went up throughout the state--that was our punishment: the knowledge of
the <i>Done</i> inexorable, the merciless insistence in our souls of
that fatal and irrevocable "Why?"</p>

<p>Swiftly people came to see and feel this, too. The first outburst of
wrath that resulted in our disfranchisement was quickly over. Even out
citizenship was quietly restored to us within three years. (As for
myself, I was only eighteen when it happened, and cannot even be said
to have missed a legal vote because of it.) Each of us was allowed to
return to college the next year after our expulsion, and finish the
full course. The sentiment of people everywhere not only softened: the
verdict quickly became: "They didn't mean to do it. They were just
damned fools." Later, by the time of our re-enfranchisement, public
sentiment actually became liberal in its tone of pardon. "They've been
punished enough," people said by then. "They were just kids--and they
didn't mean to do it. Besides"--this became an argument in our
favour--"it cost a life, but it killed hazing in the state."</p>

<p>As to the later record of the five--Randy Shepperton is dead now;
but John Brackett, Stowell Anderson, and Dick Carr have all enjoyed a
more than average measure of success in their communities. When I last
saw Stowell Anderson--he is an attorney, and the political leader of
his district--he told me quietly that, far from having been damaged in
his career by the experience, he thought he had been helped.</p>

<p>"People," he said, "are willing to forget a past mistake if they see
you're regular. They're not only willing to forgive--on the whole, I
think they're even glad to give a helping hand."</p>

<p>"If they see you're regular!" Without commenting on the meanings of
that, I think it sums up the matter in a nutshell. There has not only
been no question since about the "regularity" of the other
three--Brackett, Anderson, and Carr--but I think any natural tendencies
they may have had towards regularity were intensified by their
participation in the Pine Rock case. I believe, too, that the
denunciations of my "irregularity", following the publication of my
first book, might have been even more virulent and vicious than they
were had it not been for the respectable fellowship of Brackett,
Anderson, and Carr.</p>

<p>Well, Fox, I have taken the trouble to tell you about this
unrecorded incident in my life because I thought you might hear of it
some time and might possibly put a strained construction on it. There
were those in Libya Hill who thought it offered a reasonable and
complete explanation of what had happened to me when I wrote the book.
So, too, you might come to believe that it twisted and embittered me
and somehow had something to do with what has happened now. With
nine-tenths of your mind and heart you understand perfectly why I have
to leave you, but with that remaining tenth you are still puzzled, and
I can see that you will go on wondering about it. You have, from time
to time, tried to reason with me about what you called, half seriously,
my "radicalism". I don't believe there is any radicalism in me--or, if
there is, it is certainly not what the word implies when you use
it.</p>

<p>So, believe me, the Pine Rock case has nothing to do with it. It
explains nothing. Rather, the natural assumption, for me as for the
others who were involved in it, would be that the experience should
have established me in a more staunch and regular conformity than I
should otherwise have known.</p>

<p>You have a friend, Fox, named Hunt Conroy. You introduced me to him.
He is only a few years my senior, but he is very fixed in his assertion
of what he calls "The Lost Generation"--a generation of which, as you
know, he has been quite vociferously a member, and in which he has
tried enthusiastically to include me. Hunt and I used to argue about
it.</p>

<p>"You belong to it, too," he used to say grimly. "You came along at
the same time. You can't get away from it. You're a part of it whether
you want to be or not."</p>

<p>To which my vulgar response was:</p>

<p>"Don't you-hoo me!"</p>

<p>If Hunt <i>wants</i> to belong to The Lost Generation--and it really
is astonishing with what fond eagerness some people hug the ghost of
desolation to their breast--that's <i>his</i> affair. But he can't have
me. If I have been elected, it was against my knowledge and my
will--and I resign. I do not feel that I belong to a Lost Generation,
and I have never felt so. Indeed, I doubt very much the existence of a
Lost Generation, except insofar as every generation, groping, must be
lost. Recently, however, it has occurred to me that if there is such a
thing as a Lost Generation in this country, it is probably made up of
those men of advanced middle age who still speak the language that was
spoken before 1929, and who know no other. These men indubitably
<i>are</i> lost. But I am not one of them.</p>

<p>Although I don't believe, then, that I was ever part of any Lost
Generation anywhere, the fact remains that, as an individual, I was
lost. Perhaps that is one reason, Fox, why for so long I needed you so
desperately. For I was lost, and was looking for someone older and
wiser to show me the way, and I found you, and you took the place of my
father who had died. In our nine years together you did help me find
the way, though you could hardly have been aware just how you did it,
and the road now leads off in a direction contrary to your intent. For
the fact is that now I no longer feel lost, and I want to tell you
why.</p>

<p>When I returned to Pine Rock and finished my course and graduated--I
was only twenty then--I don't suppose it would have been possible to
find a more confused and baffled person than I was. I had been sent to
college-to "prepare myself for life", as the phrase went in those days,
and it almost seemed that the total effect of my college training was
to produce in me a state of utter unpreparedness. I had come from one
of the most conservative parts of America, and from one of the most
conservative elements in those parts. All of my antecedents, until a
generation before, had been country people whose living had been in one
way or another drawn out of the earth.</p>

<p>My father, John Webber, had been all of his life a working man. He
had done hard labour with his hands since the time he was twelve years
old. As I have often told you, he was a man of great natural ability
and intelligence. But, like many other men who have been deprived of
the advantages of formal education, he was ambitious for his son: he
wanted more than anything else in the world to see me go to college. He
died just before I was prepared to enter, but it was on the money he
left me that I went. It is only natural that people like my father
should endow formal education with a degree of practicality which it
does not and should not posssess. College seemed to him a kind of magic
door which not only opened to a man all the reserves of learning, but
also admitted him to free passage along any high road to material
success which he might choose to follow after he had passed through the
pleasant academic groves. It was only natural, too, that such a man as
my father should believe that this success could be most easily arrived
at along one of the more familiar and more generally approved
roads.</p>

<p>The road he had chosen for me before his death was a branch of
engineering. He stubbornly opposed the Joyner choice, which was the
law. The old man had small use for the law as a profession, and very
little respect for the lawyer as a man; his usual description of
lawyers was "a gang of shysters". When I went to see him as he lay
dying, his last advice to me was:</p>

<p>"Learn to <i>do</i> something, learn to <i>make</i>
something--that's what college should be for."</p>

<p>His bitterest regret was that the poverty of his early years had
prevented him from learning any skill beyond that of a carpenter and a
mason. He was a good carpenter, a good mason--in his last days he liked
to call himself a builder, which indeed he was--but I think he felt in
himself, like a kind of dumb and inarticulate suffering, the unachieved
ability to <i>design</i> and <i>shape</i>. Certainly he would have been
profoundly disappointed if he could have known what strange forms his
own desires for "doing" and for "making" were to achieve in me. I
cannot say what extremity--law or writing--would have filled him with
the most disgust.</p>

<p>But by the time I left college it was already apparent that whatever
talents I might have, they were neither for engineering nor the law. I
had not the technical ability for the one, and, in view of what I was
to discover for myself in later years, I think I was too honest for the
other. But what to do? My academic career, with the crowning disgrace
of complicity in the Pine Rock case and temporary expulsion from
college, had not been distinguished by any very glittering records in
scholarship except that One in Logic. I had failed both my father and
the Joyner side of the house in any ambitions they had had for me. My
father was dead, and the Joyners were now done with me.</p>

<p>For all these reasons, it was difficult to admit, even to myself,
the stirrings of an urge so fantastic and impractical as the desire to
write. It would only have confirmed the worst suspicions that my people
had of me--suspicions, I fear, which had begun to eat into my own
opinion of myself. Consequently, the first admission I made to myself
was evasive. I told myself that I wanted to go into journalism. Now,
looking back at it, I can see the reason for this decision clearly
enough. I doubt very much that I had, at the age of twenty, the burning
enthusiasm for newspaper work which I thought I had, but I managed to
convince myself of it because newspaper work would provide me with the
only means I knew whereby I could, in some fashion, write, and also
earn a living, and thus prove to the world and to myself that I was not
wasting my time.</p>

<p>To have confessed openly to my family that I wanted to be a writer
would have been impossible. To be a writer was, in modern phrase, "nice
work if you could get it". In the Joyner consciousness, as well as in
my own, "a writer" was a very remote kind of person. He was a romantic
figure like Lord Byron, or Longfellow, or--or--Irvin S. Cobb--who in
some magical way was gifted with the power to put words together into
poems or stories or novels which got printed in books or in the pages
of magazines like the <i>Saturday Evening Post</i>. He was therefore,
quite obviously, a very strange, mysterious sort of creature who lived
a very strange, mysterious, and glittering sort of life, and who came
from some strange and mysterious and glittering world very far away
from the life and world <i>we</i> knew. For a boy who had grown up in
the town of Libya Hill to assert openly that he wanted to be a writer
would have seemed to everyone at that time to border on lunacy. It
would have harked back to the days of Uncle Rance Joyner, who wasted
his youth learning to play the violin, and who in later life borrowed
fifty dollars from Uncle Mark to take a course in phrenology. I had
always been told that there was a strong resemblance between myself and
Uncle Rance, and now I knew that if I confessed my secret desires,
everyone would have thought the likeness more pronounced than ever.</p>

<p>It was a painful situation, and one which is now amusing to look
back on. But it was also very human--and very American. Even today I
don't think the Joyners have altogether recovered from their own
astonishment at the fact that I have actually become "a writer". This
attitude, which was also my own at the age of twenty, was to shape the
course of my life for years.</p>

<p>So, fresh from college, I took what remained of the small
inheritance my father had left me, and, with an exultant sense that I
had packed my secret into my suitcase along with my extra pants, I
started out, boy and baggage, on the road to fame and glory. That is to
say, I came to New York to look for a job on a newspaper.</p>

<p>I did look for the job, but not too hard, and I didn't find it.
Meanwhile I had enough money to live on and I began to write. Later,
when the money ran out, I condescended to become an instructor in one
of the great educational factories of the city. This was another
compromise, but it had one virtue--it enabled me to live and go on
writing.</p>

<p>During the first year in New York I shared an apartment with a group
of boys, transplanted Southerners like myself, whom I had known in
college. Through one of them I made the acquaintance of some artistic
young fellows who were living in what I swiftly learned to call "The
Village". Here, for the first time, I was thrown into the company of
sophisticated young men of my own age--at least they seemed very
sophisticated to me. For instead of being like me, an uncouth yokel
from the backwoods, all rough edges, who felt within himself the timid
but unspoken flutterings of a desire to write, these young gentlemen
had come down from Harvard, they had the easy manner of men of the
world, and they casually but quite openly told me that they <i>were</i>
writers. And so they were. They wrote, and were published, in some of
the little experimental magazines which were springing up on all sides
during that period. How I envied them!</p>

<p>They were not only able to assert openly that they were writers, but
they also asserted openly that a great many other people that I had
thought were writers--most dismally were not. When I made hesitant
efforts to take part in the brilliant conversation that flashed around
me, I began to discover that I would have to be prepared for some very
rude shocks. It was decidedly disconcerting, for example, to ask one of
these most superior young men, so carelessly correct in their rough
tweeds and pink cheeks: "Have you ever read Gals-worthy's
<i>Strife?</i>"--and to have him raise his eyebrows slowly, exhale a
slow column of cigarette smoke, slowly shake his head, and then say in
an accent of resigned regret: "I can't read him. I simply can't read
him. Sorry----" with a rising inflection as if to say that it was too
bad, but that it couldn't be helped.</p>

<p>They were sorry about a great many things and people. The theatre
was one of their most passionate concerns, but it seemed that there was
hardly a dramatist writing in those days who escaped their censure.
Shaw was amusing, but he was not a dramatist--he had never really
learned how to write a play. O'Neill's reputation was grossly
exaggerated: his dialogue was clumsy, and his characters stock types.
Barrie was insufferable on account of his sentimentality. As for Pinero
and others of that ilk, their productions were already so dated that
they were laughable.</p>

<p>In a way, this super-criticality was a very good thing for me. It
taught me to be more questioning about some of the most venerated names
and reputations whose authority had been handed down to me by my
preceptors and accepted by me with too little thought. But the trouble
with it was that I soon became involved, along with the others, in a
niggling and over-refined aestheticism which was not only pallid and
precious, but too detached from life to provide the substance and the
inspiration for high creative work.</p>

<p>It is interesting to look back now and see just what it was we
believed fifteen years ago--those of us who were the bright young
people of the time and wanted to produce something of value in the
arts. We talked a great deal about "art" and "beauty"--a great deal
about "the artist". A great deal too much, in fact. For the artist as
we conceived him was a kind of aesthetic monster. Certainly he was not
a living man. And if the artist is not first and foremost a living
man--and by this I mean a man of life, a man who belongs to life, who
is connected with it so intimately that he draws his strength from
it--then what manner of man is he?</p>

<p>The artist we talked about was not such a man at all. Indeed, if he
had any existence outside of our imagination he must have been one of
the most extraordinary and inhuman freaks that nature ever created.
Instead of loving life and believing in life, our "artist" hated life
and fled from it. That, in fact, was the basic theme of most of the
stories, plays, and novels we wrote. We were forever portraying the
sensitive man of talent, the young genius, crucified by life,
misunderstood and scorned of men, pilloried and driven out by the
narrow bigotry and mean provincialism of the town or village, betrayed
and humiliated by the cheapness of his wife, and finally crushed,
silenced, torn to pieces by the organised power of the mob. So
conceived, the artist that we talked about so much, instead of being in
union with life, was in perpetual conflict with it. Instead of
belonging to the world he lived in, he was constantly in a state of
flight from it. The world itself was like a beast of prey, and the
artist, like some wounded faun, was for ever trying to escape from
it.</p>

<p>It seems to me now, as I look back on it, that the total deposit of
all this was bad. It gave to young people who were deficient in the
vital materials and experiences of life, and in the living contacts
which the artist ought to have with life, the language and formulas of
an unwholesome preciosity. It armed them with a philosophy, an
aesthetic, of escapism. It tended to create in those of us who were
later to become artists not only a special but a privileged character:
each of us tended to think of himself as a person who was exempt from
the human laws that govern other men, who was not subject to the same
desires, the same feelings, the same passions--who was, in short, a
kind of beautiful disease in nature, like a pearl in an oyster.</p>

<p>The effect of all this upon such a person as myself may easily be
deduced. Now, for the first time, I was provided with a protective
armour, a glittering and sophisticated defence to shield my own
self-doubts, my inner misgivings, my lack of confidence in my power and
ability to accomplish what I wanted to do. The result was to make me
arrogantly truculent where my own desires and purposes were concerned.
I began to talk the jargon just as the others did, to prate about "the
artist", and to refer scornfully and contemptuously to the bourgeoisie,
the Babbitts, and the Philistines--by which all of us meant anyone who
did not belong to the very small and precious province we had fashioned
for ourselves.</p>

<p>Looking back, in an effort to see myself as I was in those days, I
am afraid I was not a very friendly or agreeable young man. I was
carrying a chip on my shoulder, and daring the whole world to knock it
off. And the reason I so often took a high tone with people who, it
seemed to me, doubted my ability to do the thing I wanted to do, was
that, inwardly, I was by no means sure that I could do it myself. It
was a form of whistling to keep one's courage up.</p>

<p>That was the kind of man I was when you first knew me, Fox. Ah, yes,
I spoke about the work I wished to do in phrases of devotion and
humility, but there was not much of either in me. Inside, I was full of
the disdainful scorn of the small and precious mob. I felt superior to
other people and thought I belonged to a rare breed. I had not yet
learned that one cannot really be superior without humility and
tolerance and human understanding. I did not yet know that in order to
belong to a rare and higher breed one must first develop the true power
and talent of selfless immolation.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="chapter7-46"></a>46. Even Two Angels Not Enough</h2>

<p>Since childhood [George wrote to Fox] I had wanted what all men want
in youth: to be famous, to be loved. These two desires went back
through all the steps, degrees, and shadings of my education; they
represented what we younglings of the time had been taught to believe
in and to want.</p>

<p>Love and Fame. Well, I have had them both.</p>

<p>You told me once, Fox, that I did not want them, that I only thought
I did. You were right. I wanted them desperately before I had them, but
once they were mine, I found that they were not enough. And I think, if
we speak truth, the same thing holds for every man who ever lived and
had the spark of growth in him.</p>

<p>It has never been dangerous to admit that Fame is not enough--one of
the world's greatest poets called it "that last infirmity of Noble
mind"--but it is dangerous, for reasons which everybody understands, to
admit the infirmity of Love. Perhaps Love's image may suffice some men.
Perhaps, as in a drop of shining water, Love may hold in microcosm the
reflection of the sun and the stars and the 'heavens and the whole
universe of man. Mighty poets dead and gone have said that this was
true, and people have professed it ever since. As for that, I can only
say that I do not think a frog pond or a Walden Pond contains the image
of the ocean, even though there be water in both of them.</p>

<p>"Love is enough, though the world be a-waning," wrote William
Morris. We have his word for it, and can believe it or not as we like.
Perhaps it was true for him, yet I doubt it. It may have been true at
the moment he wrote it, but not in the end, not when all was said and
done.</p>

<p>As for myself, I did not find it so.</p>

<p>For, even while I was most securely caught up and enclosed within
the inner circle of Love's bondage, I began to discover a larger world
outside. It did not dawn upon me in a sudden and explosive sense, the
way the world of Chapman's Homer burst upon John Keats:</p>

<blockquote>"Then felt I like some watcher of the skies<br>
When a new planet swims into his ken."</blockquote>

<p>It did not come like that at all. It came in on me little by little,
almost without my knowing it.</p>

<p>Up to that time I had been merely the sensitive young fellow in
conflict with his town, his family, the life around him--then the
sensitive young fellow in love, and so concerned with his little
Universe of Love that he thought it the whole universe. But gradually I
began to observe things in life which shocked me out of this complete
absorption with the independent entities of self. I caught glimpses of
the great, the rich, the fortunate ones of all the earth living
supinely upon the very best of everything and taking the very best for
granted as their right. I saw them enjoying a special privilege which
had been theirs so long that it had become a vested interest: they
seemed to think it was a law ordained of nature that they should be for
ever life's favourite sons. At the same time I began to be conscious of
the submerged and forgotten Helots down below, who with their toil and
sweat and blood and suffering unutterable supported and nourished the
mighty princelings at the top.</p>

<p>Then came the cataclysm of 1929 and the terrible days that followed.
The picture became clearer now--clear enough for all with eyes to see.
Through those years I was living in the jungle depths of Brooklyn, and
I saw as I had never seen before the true and terrifying visage of the
disinherited of life. There came to me a vision of man's inhumanity to
man, and as time went on it began to blot out the more personal and
self-centred vision of the world which a young man always has. Then it
was, I think, that I began to learn humility. My intense and passionate
concern for the interests and designs of my own little life were coming
to seem petty, trifling, and unworthy, and I was coming more and more
to feel an intense and passionate concern for the interests and designs
of my fellow-men and of all humanity.</p>

<p>Of course I have vastly oversimplified the process in my telling of
it. While it was at work in me I was but dimly aware of it. It is only
now, as I look back upon those years, that I can see in true
perspective the meaning of what was happening to me then. For human
nature is, alas, a muddy pool, too full of sediment, too murky with the
deposits of time, too churned up by uncharted currents in the depths
and on the surface, to reflect a sharp, precise, and wholly faithful
image. For that, one has to wait until the waters settle down, It
follows, then, that one can never hope, however much he wishes that he
could, to shed the old integuments of the soul as easily and completely
as a snake sloughs off its outworn skin.</p>

<p>For, even at the time when this new vision of the outer world was
filtering in and making its strange forms manifest to me, I was also
more involved than I had ever been before with my inner struggle. Those
were the years of the greatest doubt and desperation I had ever known.
I was wrestling with the problems of my second book, and I could take
in what my eyes beheld only in brief glimpses, flashes, snatches,
fragments. As I was later to discover, the vision etched itself upon
some sensitive film within, but it was not until that later time, when
the second book was finished and out of the way, that I saw it whole
and knew what the total experience had done to me.</p>

<p>And all the while, of course, I was still enamoured of that fair
Medusa, Fame. My desire for her was a relic of the past. All the guises
of Fame's loveliness--phantasmal, ghostwise, like something flitting in
a wood--I had dreamed of since my early youth, until her image and the
image of the loved one had a thousand times been merged together. I had
always wanted to be loved and to be famous. Now I had known Love, but
Fame was still elusive. So in the writing of my second book I courted
her.</p>

<p>Then, for the first time, I saw her. I met Mr. Lloyd McHarg. That
curious experience should have taught me something. And in a way I
suppose it did. For in Lloyd McHarg I met a truly great and honest man
who had aspired to Fame and won her, and I saw that it had been an
empty victory. He had her more completely than I could ever hope to
have her, yet it was apparent that, for him, Fame was not enough. He
needed something more, and he had not found it.</p>

<p>I say I should have learned from that. And yet, how could I? Does
one ever really learn from others till one is ready for the lesson? One
may read the truth in another's life and see it plain and still not
make the application to oneself. Does not one's glorious sense of
"I"--this wonderful, unique "I" that never was before since time began
and never will be again hereafter--does not this "I" of tender favour
come before the eye of judgment and always plead exception. I thought:
"Yes, I see how it is with Lloyd McHarg, but with me it will be
different--because I am I." That is how it has always been with me. I
could never learn anything except the hard way. I must experience it
for myself before I knew.</p>

<p>So with Fame. In the end I had to have her. She was another
woman--of all Love's rivals, as I was to find by a strange paradox, the
only one by women and by Love beloved. And I had her, as she may be
had--only to discover that Fame, like Love, was not enough.</p>

<p>By then life's weather had soaked in, although I was not fully
conscious yet what seepings had begun, or where, in what directions,
the channel of my life was flowing. All I knew was that I was exhausted
from my labour, respiring from the race, conscious only, as is a spent
runner, that the race was over, the tape breasted, and that in such
measure I had won. This was the only thought within me at the time: the
knowledge that I had met the ordeal a second time and at last had
conquered--conquered my desperation and self-doubt, the fear that I
might never come again to a whole and final accomplishment.</p>

<p>Then the circle went full swing, the cycle drew to its full close.
For several months, emptied, hollow, worn out, my life marked time
while my exhausted spirit drew its breath. But after a while the world
came in again, upon the flood tide of reviving energy. The world came
in, the world kept coming in, and there was something in the world, and
in my heart, that I had not known was there.</p>

<p>I had gone back for rest, for recreation, for oblivion, to that land
which, of all the foreign lands that I had visited, I loved the best.
Many times during the years of desperate confinement and labour on the
book I had thought of it with intense longing, as men in prison,
haltered to all the dusty shackles of the hour, have longed for the
haunted woods and meadows of Cockaigne. Many times I had gone back to
it in my dreams--to the sunken bell, the Gothic towns, the plash of
waters in the midnight fountain, the Old Place, the broken chime, and
the blonde flesh of secret, lavish women. Then at last came the day
when I walked at morning through the Brandenburger Tor, and into the
enchanted avenues of the faery green Tiergarten, and found that Fame
had come to me. It was May, and I walked below the blossoms of the
great horse-chestnut trees, and felt like Tamerlane, that it was
passing fine to be a king and move in triumph through Persepolis--and
be a famous man.</p>

<p>After those long and weary years of labour, and the need of proof to
give some easement to my tormented soul, this was the easement I had
dreamed of, the impossible thing so impossibly desired, now brought
magically to fulfilment. And now it seemed to me, who had so often gone
a stranger and unknown to the great cities of the world, that Berlin
was mine. For weeks there was a round of pleasure and celebration, and
the wonderful thrill of meeting in a foreign land and in a foreign
tongue a hundred friends, now for the first time known and captured.
There was the sapphire sparkle in the air, the enchanted brevity of
northern darkness, the glorious wine in slender bottles, and morning,
and green fields, and pretty women--all of these were mine now, they
seemed to have been created for me, to have been waiting for me, and to
exist now in all their loveliness just for my possession.</p>

<p>The weeks passed so--and then it happened. Little by little the
world came in. At first it sifted in almost unnoticed, like dark down
dropped in passing from some avenging angel's wing. Sometimes it came
to me in the desperate pleading of an eye, the naked terror of a
startled look, the swift concealment of a sudden fear. Sometimes it
just came and went as light comes, just soaked in, just soaked in--in
fleeting words and speech and actions.</p>

<p>After a while, however, in the midwatches of the night, behind thick
walls and bolted doors and shuttered windows, it came to me full flood
at last in confessions of unutterable despair. I don't know why it was
that people so unburdened themselves to me, a stranger, unless it was
because they knew the love I bore them and their land. They seemed to
feel a desperate need to talk to someone who would understand. The
thing was pent up in them, and my sympathy for all things German had
burst the dam of their reserve and caution. Their tales of woe and fear
unspeakable gushed forth and beat upon my ears. They told me stories of
their friends and relatives who had said unguarded things in public and
disappeared without a trace, stories of the Gestapo, stories of
neighbours' quarrels and petty personal spite turned into political
persecution, stories of concentration camps and pogroms, stories of
rich Jews stripped and beaten and robbed of everything they had and
then denied the right to earn a pauper's wage, stories of well-bred
Jewesses despoiled and turned out of their homes and forced to kneel
and scrub off anti-Nazi slogans scribbled on the pavements while young
barbarians dressed like soldiers formed a ring and prodded them with
bayonets and made the quiet places echo with the shameless laughter of
their mockery. It was a picture of the Dark Ages come again--shocking
beyond belief, but true as the hell that man forever creates for
himself.</p>

<p>Thus it was that the corruption of man's living faith and the
inferno of his buried anguish came to me--and I recognised at last, in
all its frightful aspects, the spiritual disease which was poisoning
unto death a noble and a mighty people.</p>

<p>But even as I saw it and knew it for what it was, there came to me,
most strangely, another thing as well. For while I sat the night
through in the darkened rooms of German friends, behind the bolted
doors and shuttered windows--while their whispered voices spoke to me
of the anguish in their hearts, and I listened, stricken in my chair to
see the tears and the graven lines of mortal sorrow form on faces which
only a short time before, in the presence of others, had been masked in
expressions of carefree unconcern--while I heard and saw these things
my heart was torn asunder, and from its opened depths came forth into
my consciousness a knowledge that I had not fully known was there. For
then it was, most curiously, that all the grey weather of unrecorded
days in Brooklyn, which had soaked through into my soul, came flooding
back upon me. Came back, too, the memory of my exploration of the
jungle trails of night. I saw again the haggard faces of the homeless
men, the wanderers, the disinherited of America, the aged workers who
had worked and now could work no more, the callow boys who had never
worked and now could find no work to do, and who, both together, had
been cast loose by a society that had no need of them and left to shift
in any way they could--to find their food in garbage cans, to seek for
warmth and fellowship in foul latrines like the one near New York's
City Hall, to sleep wrapped up in old newspapers on the concrete floors
of subway corridors.</p>

<p>It all came back to me, all the separate fragments of the vision I
had seen, together with the sinister remembrance of that upper world of
night, glittering with its riches, and its soft, sophisticated
pleasures, and its cold indifference to the misery and injustice on
which its very life was founded. It all came back, but now it was an
integrated picture.</p>

<p>So it was, in this far place and under these profoundly moving and
disturbing alien circumstances, that I realised fully, for the first
time, how sick America was, and saw, too, that the ailment was akin to
Germany's--a dread world-sickness of the soul. One of my German
friends, Franz Heilig, later told me this same thing. In Germany it was
hopeless: it had already gone too far to be checked now by any measures
short of death, destruction, and total ruin. But in America, it seemed
to me, it was not mortal, not incurable--not yet. It was desperate, and
would become more desperate still if in America, as in Germany, men
became afraid to look into the face of fear itself, to probe behind it,
to see what caused it, and then to speak the truth about it. America
was young, America was still the New World of mankind's hope, America
was not like this old and worn-out Europe which seethed and festered
with a thousand deep and uncorrected ancient maladies. America was
still resilient, still responsive to a cure--if only--if only--men
could somehow cease to be afraid of truth. For the plain and searching
light of truth, which had here, in Germany, been darkened to
extinction, was the remedy, the only one, that could cleanse and heal
the suffering soul of man.</p>

<p>After such a night of seeing whole at last, day would come again,
the cool glow of morning, the bronze gold of the kiefern-trees, the
still green pools of lucid water, the enchanted parks and gardens--but
none of it was the same as it had been before. For now I knew that
there was something else in life as new as morning and as old as hell,
a universal ill of man seen here in Germany at its darkest, and here
articulated for the first time in a word, regimented now in a scheme of
phrases and a system of abominable works. And day by day the thing
soaked in, and kept soaking in, until everywhere, in every life I met
and touched, I saw the ruin of its unutterable pollutions.</p>

<p>So now another layer had been peeled off the gauzes of the seeing
eye. And what the eye had seen and understood, I knew that it could
nevermore forget or again be blind to.</p>

<h2><a name="chapter7-47"></a>47. Ecciesiasticus</h2>

<p>Now I have told you [George wrote to Fox] some of the things that
have happened to me and the effect they had upon me. But what has all
of this to do with you?--you may ask. I am coming to that now.</p>

<p>In the beginning I spoke about my "philosophy of life" when I was a
student in college twenty years ago. I didn't tell you what it was
because I don't think I really had one then. I'm not sure I have one
now. But I think it is interesting and important that I should have
thought I had one at the age of seventeen, and that people still talk
about "a philosophy of life" as though it were a concrete object that
you could pick up and handle and take the weight and dimensions of.
Just recently I was asked to contribute to a book called <i>Modern-Day
Philosophies</i>. I tried to write something for it but gave it up,
because I was unwilling and unready to say that I had a "modern-day
philosophy". And the reason that I was unwilling and unready was not
that I felt confusion and doubt about what I think and now believe, but
that I felt confusion and doubt about saying it in formalistic and
final terms.</p>

<p>That was what was wrong with most of us at Pine Rock College twenty
years ago. We had a "concept" about Truth and Beauty and Love and
Reality--and that hardened our ideas about what all these words stood
for. After that, we had no doubt about them--or, at any rate, could not
admit that we did. This was wrong, because the essence of belief is
doubt, the essence of reality is questioning. The essence of Time is
Flow, not Fix. The essence of faith is the knowledge that all flows and
that everything must change. The growing man is Man-Alive, and his
"philosophy" must grow, must flow, with him. When it does not, we
have--do we not?--the Unfixed Man, the Eternal Trifler, the Ape of
Fashion--the man too fixed to-day, unfixed to-morrow--and his body of
beliefs is nothing but a series of fixations.</p>

<p>I cannot attempt, therefore, to define for you your own
"philosophy"--for to define so is to delimit the "closed" and academic
man, and you, thank God, are not of that ilk. And to define so would be
to call upon me once again your own and curious scorn, your sudden
half-amused contemptuousness. For how could anyone pin down neatly the
essence of your New Englandness--so sensitively proud, so shy, so
shrinking and alone, but at bottom, as I think, so unafraid?</p>

<p>I shall not define you, then, dear Fox. But I may state, may I not?
I may say how "it seems to me"?--how Fox appears?--and what I think of
it?</p>

<p>Well, first of all, Fox seems to me to be Ecclesiasticus. I think
that this is fair, and, insofar as definition goes, I think you will
agree. Do you know of any definition that could possibly go further? I
do not. In thirty-seven years of thinking, feeling, dreaming, working,
striving, voyaging, and devouring, I have come across no other that
could fit you half so well. Perhaps something has been written,
painted, sung, or spoken in the world that would define you better: if
it has, I have not seen it; and if I did see it, then I should feel
like one who came upon a Sistine Chapel greater than the first, which
no man living yet has heard about.</p>

<p>So far as I can see from nine years of observing you, yours is the
way of life, the way of thought, of feeling, and of acting, of the
Preacher in Ecclesiastes. I know of no better way. For of all that I
have ever seen or learned, that book seems to me the noblest, the
wisest, and the most powerful expression of man's life upon this
earth--and also earth's highest flower of poetry, eloquence, and truth.
I am not given to dogmatic judgments in the matter of literary
creation, but if I had to make one I could only say that Ecclesiastes
is the greatest single piece of writing I have ever known, and the
wisdom expressed in it the most lasting and profound.</p>

<p>And I should say that it expresses your own position as perfectly as
anything could. I have read it over many times each year, and I do not
know of a single word or stanza in it with which you would not
instantly agree.</p>

<p>You would agree--to quote just a few precepts which come to mind
from that noble book--that a good name is better than precious
ointment; and I think you would also agree that the day of death is
better than the day of one's birth. You would agree with the great
Preacher that all things are full of labour; that man cannot utter it;
that the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with
hearing. I know you would agree also that the thing that hath been, is
that which shall be; and that that which is done, is that which shall
be done: and that there is no new thing under the sun. You would agree
that it is vexation of spirit to give one's heart to know wisdom, and
to know madness and folly. I know you would agree--for you have so
admonished me many times--that to everything there is a season, and a
time to every purpose under the heaven.</p>

<p>"Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher; all is vanity." You would
agree with him in that; but you would also agree with him that the fool
foldeth his hands together and eateth his own flesh. You would agree
with all your being that "Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with
thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom,
in the grave, whither thou goest."</p>

<p>Is this abridgement and this definition just, dear Fox? Yes, for I
have seen every syllable of it in you a thousand times. I have learned
every accent of it from yourself. You said one time, when I had spoken
of you in the dedication of a book, that what I had written would be
your epitaph. You were mistaken. Your epitaph was written many
centuries ago: Ecclesiastes is your epitaph. Your portrait had been
drawn already in the portrait the great Preacher had given of himself.
You are he, his words are yours so perfectly that if he had never lived
or uttered them, all of him, all of his great and noble Sermon, could
have been derived afresh from you.</p>

<p>If I could, therefore, define your own philosophy--and his--I think
I should define it as the philosophy of a <i>hopeful</i> fatalism. Both
of you are in the essence pessimists, but both of you are also
pessimists with hope. From both of you I learned much, many true and
hopeful things. I learned, first of all, that one must work, that one
must do what work he can, as well and ably as he can, and that it is
only the fool who repines and longs for what is vanished, for what
might have been but is not. I learned from both of you the stein lesson
of acceptance: to acknowledge the tragic underweft of life into which
man is born, through which he must live, out of which he must die. I
learned from both of you to accept that essential fact without
complaint, but, having accepted it, to try to do what was before me,
what I could do, with all my might.</p>

<p>And, curiously--for here comes in the strange, hard paradox of our
twin polarity--it was just here, I think, where I was so much and so
essentially in confirmation with you, that I began to disagree. I think
almost that I could say to you: "I believe in everything you say, but I
do not agree with you"--and so state the root of our whole trouble, the
mystery of our eventual cleavage and our final severance. The little
tongues will wag--have wagged, I understand, already--will propose a
thousand quick and ready explanations (as they have)--but really, Fox,
the root of the whole thing is here.</p>

<p>In one of the few letters that you ever wrote to me--a wonderful and
moving one just recently--you said:</p>

<p>"I know that you are going now. I always knew that it would happen.
I will not try to stop you, for it had to be. And yet, the strange
thing is, the hard thing is, I have never known another man with whom I
was so profoundly in agreement on all essential things."</p>

<p>And that is the strange, hard thing, and wonderful and mysterious;
for, in a way the little clacking tongues can never know about, it is
completely true. Still, there is our strange paradox: it seems to me
that in the orbit of our world you are the North Pole, I the South--so
much in balance, in agreement--and yet, dear Fox, the whole world lies
between.</p>

<p>'Tis true, our view of life was very much the same. When we looked
out together, we saw man burned with the same sun, frozen by the same
cold, beat upon by the hardships of the same impervious weathers, duped
by the same gullibility, self-betrayed by the same folly, misled and
baffled by the same stupidity. Each on the opposing hemisphere of his
own pole looked out across the spinning orbit of this vexed, tormented
world, and at the other, and what each saw, the picture that each got,
was very much the same. We not only saw the stupidity and the folly and
the gullibility and the self-deception of man, but we saw his nobility,
courage, and aspiration, too. We saw the wolves that preyed upon him
and laid him waste--the wild scavangers of greed, of fear, of
privilege, of power, of tyranny, of oppression, of poverty and disease,
of injustice, cruelty, and wrong--Land in what we saw of this as well,
dear Fox, we were agreed.</p>

<p>Why, then, the disagreement? Why, then, the struggle that ensued,
the severance that has now occurred? We saw the same things, and we
called them by the same names. We abhorred them with the same
indignation and disgust--and yet, we disagreed, and I am making my
farewell to you. Dear friend, the parent and the guardian of my spirit
in its youth, the thing has happened and we know it. Why?</p>

<p>I know the answer, and the thing I have to tell you now is this:</p>

<p>Beyond the limits of my own mortality, the stern acknowledgment that
man was born to live, to suffer, and to die--your own and the great
Preacher's creed--I am not, cannot be, confirmed to more fatality.
Briefly, you thought the ills which so beset mankind were irremediable:
that just as man was born to live, to suffer, and to die, so was he
born to be eternally beset and preyed upon by all the monsters of his
own creation--by fear and cruelty, by tyranny and power, by poverty and
wealth. You felt, with the stern fatality of resignation which is the
granite essence of your nature, that these things were doomed to be,
and be for ever, because they had always been, and were inherent in the
tainted and tormented soul of man.</p>

<p>Dear Fox, dear friend, I heard you and I understood you--but could
not agree. You felt--I heard you and I understood--that if old monsters
were destroyed, new ones would be created in their place. You felt that
if old tyrannies were overthrown, new ones, as sinister and evil, would
reign after them. You felt that all the glaring evils in the woad
around us--the monstrous and perverse unbalance between power and
servitude, between want and plenty, between privilege and burdensome
discrimination--were inevitable because they had always been the curse
of man and were the prime conditions of his being. The gap between us
widened. You stated and affirmed--I heard you, but could not agree.</p>

<p>To state your rule and conduct plainly, I think I never knew a
kinder or a gentler man, but I also never knew a man more fatally
resigned. In practice--in life and conduct--I have seen the Sermon of
the Preacher work out in you like a miracle. I have seen you grow
haggard and grey because you saw a talent wasted, a life misused, work
undone that should be done. I have seen you move mountains to save
something which, you felt, was worth the effort and could be saved. I
have seen you perform prodigies of labour and patience to pull a
drowning man of talent out of the swamp of failure into which his life
was sinking; and at each successive slipping back, so far from
acknowledging defeat with resignation and regret, you made your eyes
flash fire and you will toughen to the hardness of forged steel as I
saw you strike your hand upon the table and heard you whisper, with an
almost savage intensity of passion: "He must not go. He is not lost. I
<i>will</i> not, and he <i>must</i> not, let it happen!"</p>

<p>To give this noble virtue of your life the etching of magnificence
it deserves, it is your due to have it stated here. For, without it,
there can be no proper understanding of your worth, your true
dimension. To describe the acquiescence of your stern fatality without
first describing the inspired tenacity of your effort would be to give
a false and insufficient picture of the strangest and the most
familiar, the most devious and the most direct, the simplest and the
most complex figure that this nation and this generation have
produced.</p>

<p>To say that you looked on at all the suffering and injustice of this
vexed, tormented world with the toleration of resigned fatality without
telling also of your own devoted and miraculous effort to save what
could be saved, would not do justice to you. No man ever better
fulfilled the injunction of the Preacher to lay about him and to do the
work at hand with all his might. No man ever gave himself more wholly,
not only to the fulfilment of that injunction for himself, but to the
task of saving others who had failed to do it, and who might be saved.
But no man ever accepted the irremediable with more quiet unconcern. I
think you would risk your life to save that of a friend who put himself
uselessly and wantonly in peril, but I know, too, that you would accept
the fact of unavoidable death without regret. I have seen you grow
grey-faced and hollow-eyed with worry over the condition of a beloved
child who was suffering from a nervous shock or ailment that the
doctors could not diagnose. You found the cause eventually and checked
it; but I know that if the cause had been fatal and incurable, you
would have accepted that fact with a resignation as composed as your
own effort was inspired.</p>

<p>All of this makes the paradox of our great difference as bard and
strange as the paradox of our polarity. And in this lies the root of
trouble and the seed of severance. Your own philosophy has led you to
accept the order of things as they are because you have no hope of
changing them; and if you could change them, you feel that any other
order would be just as bad. In everlasting terms--those of
eternity--you and the Preacher may be right: for there is no greater
wisdom than the wisdom of Ecclesiastes, no acceptance finally so true
as the stern fatalism of the rock. Man was born to live, to suffer, and
to die, and what befalls him is a tragic lot. There is no denying this
in the final end. <i>But we must, dear Fox, deny it all along the
way</i>.</p>

<p>Mankind was fashioned for eternity, but Man-Alive was fashioned for
a day. New evils will come after him, but it is with the present evils
that he is now concerned. And the essence of all faith, it seems to me,
for such a man as I, the essence of religion for people of my belief,
is that man's life can be, and will be, better; that man's greatest
enemies, in the forms in which they now exist--the forms we see on
every hand of fear, hatred, slavery, cruelty, poverty, and need--can be
conquered and destroyed. But to conquer and destroy them will mean
nothing less than the complete revision of the structure of society as
we know it. They cannot be conquered by the sorrowful acquiescence of
resigned fatality. They cannot be destroyed by the philosophy of
acceptance--by the tragic hypothesis that things as they are, evil as
they are, are as good and as bad as, under any form-they will ever be.
The evils that we hate, you no less than I, cannot be overthrown with
shrugs and sighs and shakings of the head how, ever wise. It seems to
me that they but mock at us and only become more bold when we retreat
before them and take refuge in the affirmation of man's tragic average.
To believe that new monsters will arise as vicious as the old, to
believe that the great Pandora's box of human frailty, once opened,
will never show a diminution of its ugly swarm, is to help, by just
that much, to make it so for ever.</p>

<p>You and the Preacher may be right for all eternity, but we
Men-Alive, dear Fox, are right for Now. And it is for Now, and for us
the living, that we must speak, and speak the truth, as much of it as
we can see and know. With the courage of the truth within us, we shall
meet the enemy as they come to us, and they <i>shall</i> be ours. And
if, once having conquered them, new enemies approach, we shall meet
them from that point, from there proceed. In the affirmation of that
fact, the continuance of that unceasing war, is man's religion and his
living faith.</p>

<h2><a name="chapter7-48"></a>48. Credo</h2>

<p>I have never before made a statement of belief [George wrote in his
conclusion to Fox], although I have believed in many things and said
that I believed in them. But I have never stated my belief in concrete
terms because almost every element of my nature has been opposed to the
hard framework, the finality, of formulation.</p>

<p>Just as you are the rock of life, I am the web; just as you are
Time's granite, so, I think, am I Time's plant. My life, more than that
of anyone I know, has taken on the form of growth. No man that I have
known was ever more deeply rooted in the soil of Time and Memory, the
weather of his individual universe, than was I. You followed me through
the course of that whole herculean conflict. For four years, as I lived
and worked and explored the jungle depths of Brooklyn--jungle depths
coincident with those of my own soul--you were beside me, you followed,
and you stuck.</p>

<p>You never had a doubt that I would finish--make an end--round out
the cycle--come to the whole of it. The only doubt was mine, enhanced,
tormented by my own fatigue and desperation, and by the clacking of the
feeble and malicious little tongues which, knowing nothing, whispered
that I would never make an end again because I could not begin. We both
knew how grotesquely false this was--so false and so grotesque that it
was sometimes the subject of an anguished and exasperated laugh. The
truth was so far different that my own fears were just the opposite:
that I might never make an end to anything again because I could never
get through telling what I knew, what I felt and thought and <i>had</i>
to say about it.</p>

<p>That was a giant web in which I was caught, the product of my huge
inheritance--the torrential recollectiveness, derived out of my
mother's stock, which became a living, million-fibred integument that
bound me to the past, not only of my own life, but of the very earth
from which I came, so that nothing in the end escaped from its inrooted
and all-feeling explorativeness. The way the sunlight came and went
upon a certain day, the way grass felt between bare toes, the immediacy
of noon, the slamming of an iron gate, the halting skreak upon the
corner of a street car, the liquid sound of shoe leather on the
pavements as men came home to lunch, the smell of turnip greens, the
clang of ice-tongs, and the clucking of a hen--and then Time fading
like a dream, Time melting to oblivion, when I was two years old. Not
only this, but all lost sounds and voices, forgotten memories exhumed
with a constant pulsing of the 'brain's great ventricle, until I lived
them in my dreams, carrying the stupendous and unceasing burden of them
through the unresting passages of sleep. Nothing that had ever been was
lost. It all came back in an endless flow, even the blisters of the
paint upon the mantelpiece in my father's house, the smell of the old
leather sofa with my father's print upon it, the smell of dusty bottles
and of cobwebs in the cellar, the casual stomping of a slow, gaunt hoof
upon the pulpy lumber of a livery stable floor, the proud lift and
flourish of a whisking tail, and the oaty droppings. I lived again
through all times and weathers I had known--through the fag-ends of
wintry desolation in the month of March and the cold, bleak miseries of
ragged red at sunset, the magic of young green in April, the blind
horror and suffocation of concrete places in mid-summer sun where no
limits were, and October with the smell of fallen leaves and wood smoke
in the air. The forgotten moments and unnumbered hours came back to me
with all the enormous cargo of my memory, together with lost voices in
the mountains long ago, the voices of the kinsmen dead and never seen,
and the houses they had built and died in, and the rutted roads they
trod upon, and every unrecorded moment that Aunt Maw had told me of the
lost and obscure lives they led long, long ago. So did it all revive in
the ceaseless pulsings of the giant ventricle, so did the plant go
back, stem by stem, root by root, and filament by filament, until it
was complete and whole, compacted of the very earth that had produced
it, and of which it was itself the last and living part.</p>

<p>You stayed beside me like the rock you are until I unearthed the
plant, followed it back through every fibre of its pattern to its last
and tiniest enrootment in the blind, dumb earth. And now that it is
finished, and the circle come full swing--we, too, are finished, and I
have a thing to say:</p>

<p>I believe that we are lost here in America, but I believe we shall
be found. And this belief, which mounts now to the catharsis of
knowledge and conviction, is for me--and I think for all of us----not
only our own hope, but America's everlasting, living dream. I think the
life which we have fashioned in America, and which has fashioned
us--the forms we made, the cells that grew, the honeycomb that was
created--was self-destructive in its nature, and must be destroyed. I
think these forms are dying, and must die, just as I know that America
and the people in it are deathless, undiscovered, and immortal, and
must live.</p>

<p>I think the true discovery of America is before us. I think the true
fulfilment of our spirit, of our people, of our mighty and immortal
land, is yet to come. I think the true discovery of our own democracy
is still before us. And I think that all these things are certain as
the morning, as inevitable as noon. I think I speak for most men living
when I say that our America is Here, is Now, and beckons on before us,
and that this glorious assurance is not only our living hope, but our
dream to be accomplished.</p>

<p>I think the enemy is here before us, too. But I think we know the
forms and faces of the enemy, and in the knowledge that we know him,
and shall meet him, and eventually must conquer him is also our living
hope. I think the enemy is here before us with a thousand faces, but I
think we know that all his faces wear one mask. I think the enemy is
single selfishness and compulsive greed. I think the enemy is blind,
but has the brutal power of his blind grab. I do not think the enemy
was born yesterday, or that he grew to manhood forty years ago, or that
he suffered sickness and collapse in 1929, or that we began without the
enemy, and that our vision faltered, that we lost the way, and suddenly
were in his camp. I think the enemy is old as Time, and evil as Hell,
and that he has been here with us from the beginning. I think he stole
our earth from us, destroyed our wealth, and ravaged and despoiled our
land. I think he took our people and enslaved them, that he polluted
the fountains of our life, took unto himself the rarest treasures of
our own possession, took our bread and left us with a crust, and, not
content, for the nature of the enemy is insatiate--tried finally to
take from us the crust.</p>

<p>I think the enemy comes to us with the face of innocence and says to
us:</p>

<p>"I am your friend."</p>

<p>I think the enemy deceives us with false words and lying phrases,
saying:</p>

<p>"See, I am one of you--I am one of your children, your son, your
brother, and your friend. Behold how sleek and fat I have become--and
all because I am just one of you, and your friend. Behold how rich and
powerful I am--and all because I am one of you--shaped in your way of
life, of thinking, of accomplishment. What I am, I am because I am one
of you, your humble brother and your friend. Behold," cries Enemy, "the
man I am, the man I have become, the thing I have accomplished--and
reflect. Will you destroy this thing? I assure you that it is the most
precious thing you have. It is yourselves, the projection of each of
you, the triumph of your individual lives, the thing that is rooted in
your blood, and native to your stock, and inherent in the traditions of
America. It is the thing that all of you may hope to be," says Enemy,
"for"--humbly--"am I not just one of you? Am I not just your brother
and your son? Am I not the living image of what each of you may hope to
be, would wish to be, would desire for his own son? Would you destroy
this glorious incarnation of your own heroic self? If you do, then,"
says Enemy, "you destroy yourselves--you kill the thing that is most
gloriously American, and in so killing, kill yourselves."</p>

<p>He lies! And now we know he lies! He is not gloriously, or in any
other way, ourselves. He is not our friend, our son, our brother. And
he is not American! For, although he has a thousand familiar and
convenient faces, his own true face is old as Hell.</p>

<p>Look about you and see what he has done.</p>

<p>Dear Fox, old friend, thus we have come to the end of the road that
we were to go together. My tale is finished--and so farewell.</p>

<p>But before I go, I have just one more thing to tell you:</p>

<p>Something has spoken to me in the night, burning the tapers of the
waning year; something has spoken in the night, and told me I shall
die, I know not where. Saying:</p>

<p>"To lose the earth you know, for greater knowing; to lose the life
you have, for greater life; to leave the friends you loved, for greater
loving; to find a land more kind than home, more large than
earth----</p>

<p>"--Whereon the pillars of this earth are founded, towards which the
conscience of the world is tending--a wind is rising, and the rivers
flow."</p>
