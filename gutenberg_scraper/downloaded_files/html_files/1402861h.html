<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>RECOLLECTIONS OF A FEW AUSTRALIAN
POETS</h2>

<p>My father was a poet and a friend of poets, but his time was so
fully occupied by his duties as a physician and as the leader of
the Swedenborgian church in Sydney that, as a small boy, I never
thought of him except as a beneficent but seldom-seen angel who
wore a pith helmet and went to the Turkish bath for refreshment. He
was broadly-built, and I recollect a happy evening when he crawled
about the floor, a realistic elephant, with one or two of us on his
back. His kind blue eyes and his great fair beard were a joy to the
heart of many an ailing child, and his presence must often have
done even more good than medicine.</p>

<p>It was his friendship with poets that accounted for my only
interview with the most distinguished Australian writer of his
time. I was playing solitarily in the paved courtyard in front of
our home in Richmond Terrace, when a rather haggard man, whose
trousers seemed to flap about his legs, came in from the Domain.
After a moment's hesitation he approached me and said, "I suppose
you'd like a penny." I supposed so too, and answered accordingly.
He regarded me with deep melancholy, shook his head, exclaimed, "I
wish I had one to give you," and walked up the steps to the front
door. Disappointment impressed upon my memory that simple
conversation with Henry Kendall.</p>

<p>Another versifier, whom I remember well, used to come&mdash;a
few years later I suppose&mdash;to read his lines to my father and
consult him as to their merit. If my father found fault with the
metre, this poet controverted the objection by triumphantly
counting the syllables on his fingers. Once he brought a political
epigram, which he repeated magnificently:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pin10">Better that in cold obstruction Old
obstructionists should lie And our veins be filled with new blood
Running deep and running high.</p>

<p>"Better than what?" asked my father with polite interest. The
question was evidently unexpected and disconcerting.</p>

<p>Probably the first poet in whom I took a warm personal interest
was Dowell O'Reilly, who, when I made his acquaintance, was
teaching the boys in his mother's school at Parramatta. He sought
me out, at a school cadet camp, because he had read stray verses of
mine which engaged his sympathy, and we formed an immediate
friendship. My home was at Gladesville, and more than once I walked
up to Parramatta&mdash;eight miles&mdash;in the evening, talked
with Dowell till nearly morning, and then walked home again; such
was the charm of his companionship. He did not sleep under the same
roof with the rest of the family but in what had been a fowl-house,
though, when I knew it, it had been converted into very comfortable
quarters. The window opened upon the interior of a large cage,
occupied by pigeons, and sometimes Dowell would throw a handful of
wheat on his floor for the birds. They were friendly and
picturesque, though not as fastidiously careful of their manners as
they might have been.</p>

<p>Dowell O'Reilly was an athletic young fellow in those days, an
enthusiastic cricketer, a lieutenant in a volunteer regiment, and a
fellow of happy disposition. He had vast ambitions and fiery
enthusiasm and a great heart. Humorous and quick-witted and
glib-tongued, he soon developed into a public speaker whom nobody
could hear without appreciation, so that he naturally chose
politics as the quickest and most effective way of using his
talents for the public benefit. By way of introducing himself to
what was to be his constituency he delivered a lecture in
Parramatta on "The French Revolution." The town crier had made a
slight mistake, and had publicly announced that the subject of the
address was to be "French Revelations," and consequently the size
of Dowell's audience was amazing; nevertheless, his oratory gave
them no opportunity to feel regret. But in the political sphere, as
elsewhere, though he had some success he met with many
disappointments, his ardency was dimmed, and his faith in human
nature tarnished. He seemed to have no firm anchorage, but was
tossed on the surface of theories and events. Still, he retained to
the end much of his old impulsiveness, his power of affection, his
eagerness to acknowledge merit, and his pathetic belief in his
ability to summarize the characters of his friends and enemies. As
a protection against the shafts and poison-gas of the Philistine,
he kept his armour of bright humour and his mask of whimsical
irony. His face was wonderfully expressive, and, even when he did
not seize advantage for a quip, his lifted brows and laughing eyes
were eloquent. I remember well his extraordinary look of dismay and
astonishment and delight when a poet, for whom we both had an
affection, said solemnly and sonorously, "I am very fond of birds,
myself. I never allow my boys to shoot them within half a mile of
the house."</p>

<p>As the editor of the Sydney University undergraduates' journal,
<i>Hermes,</i> I received, one afternoon, a song, with musical
accompaniment, printed on yellow paper; and I think there was an
anonymous note, begging for a review. Blankly ignorant of music, I
published a notice in which I gave my sufficiently favourable
opinion of the verses, and almost ignored the accompaniment. That
led to an acquaintance with the author of the lyric, a rallying
song for "The men of the New Australia." She was Miss M. J.
Cameron, now better known to Australia as Mary Gilmore, and she had
sent the sulphur-tinted publication merely to secure some
encouragement for the young collaborating composer. She was not a
student of the University, but she had a room in a terrace opposite
the main building, and there I would meet her sometimes in the
evening. Her alert manner and abrupt speech went well with an
active and original mind which gave a wonderful interest to her
talk. When she had endured my conversation longer than politeness
demanded, she would turn me out without ceremony, and, I hope,
slept the better for her weariness. One night she took me wandering
over districts that were strange to me, and we called at the house
of the burly, kind-hearted John Farrell, ex-brewer, poet, staunch
single-taxer, and able journalist. As I mention elsewhere, it was
she who introduced me to Henry Lawson, and then tactfully waved us
into the street while the night was yet young. Of all the women I
know, there is none who better understands the nature of men than
the greatly sympathetic poet of <i>The Passionate Heart.</i> It is
pleasant to recall that recently she introduced me to another
poet&mdash;Shaw Neilson, who combines hard manual labour and the
delicate handling of felicitous rhythms&mdash;and that she repeated
her old tactics.</p>

<p>Lawson and I used to wander into all sorts of queer corners and
neglected backwaters in Sydney and he pointed out to me the
localities which he fancifully associated with the scenes described
by the one novelist with whose work he was fairly
familiar&mdash;Charles Dickens. He was never a great reader, and,
at the height of his powers, devoted more of his time to the
perusal of Deadwood Dick's adventures than to anything that could
be called literature. I remember his borrowing only one book from
me in all the years of our friendship; it was <i>Barrack Room
Ballads.</i> His knowledge of Edgar Poe and Bret Harte, he told me,
came from his mother, who used to read aloud to her family.</p>

<p>Looking back over the crowded years in which Lawson's reputation
spread and strengthened until, at his death, he was deemed worthy
of a public funeral, and thereafter was recognized throughout our
continent, and even in Europe, as the most typically Australian of
our literary figures, I am glad to remember that, from the day when
I read one of his earliest contributions to the <i>Bulletin,</i> I
knew his worth&mdash;I hope without the exaggeration which is
habitual with some of his later admirers&mdash;and was the first to
give a lecture on his work and possibly the first to publish an
article in recognition of his pre-eminence. When the article was
written, he had not yet published a book; the lecture was delivered
in hope of increasing the sales of his then forthcoming volume,
<i>In the Days when the World was Wide.</i> He and I together
selected and revised the poems for that volume, and I still
perceive, with some annoyance, my own handiwork in a passage where
neither of us could find the exact word and he insisted on adopting
my desperate suggestion instead of recasting the line.</p>

<p>He used to compose his poems gradually, without setting them
down upon paper. Shut in from outward disturbance by his deafness,
he would walk along, with that intense look of his, fitting his
words to the chosen metre. Sometimes he would say, "Here's a bit of
a piece I have in mind;" and then, with an almost mechanical
insistence on the metrical beat, he would recite a few lines. He
could store the stanzas in his head without trouble. The trouble
came with the writing.</p>

<p>Though Lawson had a childlike instinct for strongly-marked
metres, he had no feeling whatever for subtleties of rhythm. He
took up a copy of Whitman's <i>Leaves of Grass</i> one day, and
glanced piercingly at a few pages. "I can't make anything out of
that," he complained; "the lines don't seem to match. Look at this
now! It begins all right&mdash;'To get betimes in Boston Town, I
rose this morning early,' but the next line ought to be, 'Tum tumty
tumty tumty tum amang the rigs o' barley,' or something like that."
In one poem of his I thought I detected signs of a greater delicacy
of ear. It was an early piece, describing the dream of a mother
whose little girl had been drowned, and its refrain was the call of
the phantom child&mdash;.</p>

<p class="pin10">"Come, mamma! come!<br>
Quick! follow me!<br>
Step out on the leaves of the water-lily!"</p>

<p>The use of the unaccented syllable for the rhyme has the kind of
beauty that Rossetti often obtained by similar means. I asked
Lawson how he came to use such a rhyme. He was apologetic. He
should have made it clear, he explained, that he was imitating a
child's way of stressing the word&mdash;"putting all the weight on
the last syllable."</p>

<p>One afternoon, in the dim parlour at McGrath's, Lawson
introduced me to his friend Roderic Quinn, who sat and ruminated
and said little, though the glint of his beaming eyes showed how
humorously observant he was; and I dare say there was a good deal
in both of us to amuse him. Rod and I have never seen much of each
other, but enough for mutual good-will. His best poetry, I suspect,
is better than he knows. Often his truest images seem to mean less
to him than to an imaginative reader. Chris Brennan once objected
to the last line but one in "The Hidden Tide," because the moon
that shines therein is so much more than "the full moon of peace;"
the words "of peace" set a false limit. Again, in "The Red-tressed
Maiden," Quinn is so extraordinarily anxious to indicate that his
ancient but ever-youthful girl is fire, that he seems to forget
that fire is a primeval symbol of creative, vital and purifying
love&mdash;the grace and wrath of God; but, because his imagery is
beautifully true, one can dream over his comforting fire and divine
meaning beyond meaning.</p>

<p>I met Brennan first in the quadrangle of the University of
Sydney, in the year in which he took his Bachelor's degree and I
entered as a freshman. Jack Peden introduced us. The common-room
was still humming with stories of Brennan's pranks as an undergrad,
and he had set a standard for raggedness of gown and dilapidation
of trencher cap&mdash;the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of academic fashion.
A travelling scholarship took him to Germany, and several years had
passed when I met him again. Then began a close friendship, which I
hope nothing can break, though in substantial results it has been
entirely onesided: he has had nothing to gain from me, whereas
intercourse with him is a perennial education. The extent and
thoroughness of his learning reduces fine scholars to a humble
docility. His thought ranges everywhere, deeply penetrating. All
essentially human qualities are developed in him and combined in a
most impressive unity. It would be grossly unjust to view him from
only one angle. He is so comprehensive, his nature so spacious,
that in him contraries meet and are reconciled. Those who are
baffled and lost in the mosses of the borderland are apt to
disbelieve in the rich region that spreads beyond. People who have
only heard him boom and laugh have little conception of the
intimate secrets of his nature&mdash;his sensitiveness, his
tenderness and spiritual delicacy. Finding his attitude defiant or
evasive, they are unable to realize that this is the protective
guise of shyness. He is a turbulent sea concealing its lucid deep.
He hides often behind his scholarship, for always he is ready to
impart knowledge, to open the treasury of his mind to anybody who
is interested; and nobody who listens can fail to be interested.
His poetry is of the kind that gains 'more and more appreciation
with the lapse of time&mdash;as people catch up with it, one might
say. After a hundred years, when most of us have been forgotten,
his honoured name will be familiar. His is not a poetry of
occasional felicities and lucky shots. Every line is firmly moulded
and genuinely poetic. Have a look at the cluster of his poems in
Percival Serle's <i>Australasian Anthology,</i> and notice how
thin, how pale and diffuse, the verses contributed by many other
Australian writers suddenly appear by contrast. His poetic quality
is essential.</p>

<p>Among all the poets who have attended our University of Sydney
as students, Brennan easily takes first place, though there are
several who have striking merits. Dowell O'Reilly, for example, and
L. H. Allen, and H. M. Green. A poet cannot be made, but literary
talent can be fostered and the evidence is clear enough that young
poets are not daunted by the academic discipline of Sydney, but
that people who are interested in the development of Australian
literature should be grateful to an institution where literary
gifts are recognized and encouraged.</p>

<p>Among the younger poets who are now gaining recognition, there
are two university men who seem to me to show remarkable promise.
One is R. D. FitzGerald, in whom joy gushes up with the force and
constancy of an artesian spring and expresses itself with
spontaneous power. The other is Raymond McGrath, who handles words
with an artist's instinctive feeling for sound and colour values;
for McGrath is a pictorial artist and an architect as well as a
poet.</p>

<p>I diffidently bask in a little reflected glory from FitzGerald,
inasmuch as I happen to be his uncle. At first, I thought, his
parents seemed inclined to discourage his uncommercial talent. I
suspect that this was because they had a kinsman who wrote verse
and had Bohemian friends, and could easily have been regarded as an
awful example. But the superstition that a poet is necessarily an
unpractical idler has long been exploded, even in Australia.
FitzGerald is an able surveyor.</p>

<p>McGrath and I have been friends ever since he was good enough to
show me some of his verses in the first year of his university
course and to listen without impatience to my criticisms.</p>

<p>Victor Daley, whose ideas became so naturally incarnate in
lovely imagery that he seemed to be able to write poetry on demand,
was the centre of a group of which I was not a member. With him I
was never intimate until he was dying at Killara, though I saw him
occasionally in happier days. I think the first occasion was when
he was beating up a party for a merrymaking on a visiting yacht;
when Bertram Stevens mentioned my name, he tried to include me
among the revellers. I pleaded a strict engagement. "Break it," he
commanded. I told him I had no desire to break it. "With whom is
it," he asked, "a man or a woman?" "A woman, of course." "Then you
can be no true Bohemian," he cried theatrically, "for no woman on
earth is worthy of such a sacrifice as this." I recalled his words,
at a later meeting, on hearing him say, with melancholy intonation,
"I must give up Bohemianism; it makes too many demands on a
fellow." That is the danger, no doubt, when Bohemia becomes an -ism
and its traditions are fossilized to Draconic law. The Bohemianist
is atrociously conventional, and, for the sake of strict
conformity, he may even find inebriety forced upon him by his
conscience and may regard frowsiness as a virtue. Daley was
fastidious, and he shrank from any such rigid code of morals.</p>

<p>Looking far back, I see myself as a curious kid gazing at a boy
named Bartie Paterson. He took no notice of me. He had been
shooting pelicans on the Parramatta River, a sport that seems
somehow to have fallen into disuse. When I was a schoolboy and he
was a man, we lived in the same suburb. He and some other bachelors
had an establishment of their own at Gladesville, when he first
thought of attempting verse. He had been reading the poems of
Gordon and of Cholmondeley Pennell, and believed that he could
compose ballads, with a swinging metre in harmony with a rushing
action, at least as well as they. Knowing that I was already a
writer of verse, he asked me if I would collaborate with him. I was
astonished, for that kind of verse was scarcely in my line; and the
idea of collaboration was promptly dropped. Soon afterwards some of
Banjo's most successful ballads were appearing in the
<i>Bulletin.</i></p>

<p>There are many other things I could tell you of my meetings with
poets. For example I might describe how I entered the apparently
deserted library of the Supreme Court in Melbourne, and, noticing a
stream of grey smoke floating upward from behind a desk, peeped
round the barricade and found a poet whose eyes appeared now and
then to be covered with a filmy dreaminess from behind which he
looked mystically into infinity&mdash;that was Bernard O'Dowd. Or I
might tell you of the shy idealist, dark-bearded and earnest-eyed,
who has somehow been absorbed into the later personality of Arthur
Adams. And how many others there are! the exuberant Hugh McCrae,
who discovered an unexpected fauna in the Australian bush, was
photographed as a smooth-skinned Pan playing his pipes in the
shrubbery, and finds himself surrounded by a poetic progeny of
skipping fauns; Zora Cross who achieved her reputation by an
extraordinary intensity, and added to it by writing the finest of
Australian elegies; Arthur Bayldon who astonished the Bushmen by
swimming miraculously in inland tanks, while his limbs were
trussed, and whose courage and exaltation of spirit give worth to
the books for which he secured a sufficient sale by personal
canvassing; McKee Wright, who read his delicately-moulded
quantitative verse with a voice that passed over the rhythm
soothingly, as a soft hand over the curves of a cat; and Dora
Wilcox, Dorothea Mackellar, Furnley Maurice, H. M. Green, L. H.
Allen, Arthur Maquarie and the rest! But enough for the
present.</p>

<p>I have recalled a few personalities and incidents that have
interested me, and my only excuse is a hope that somebody else may
also be interested.</p>

<p>If you believe the often-repeated sneer that artists are
jealous, quarrelsome creatures who are easily excited to petty
malice against each other, let me assure you that that is not my
experience. It is certainly not true of those artists for whom
words and phrases are the materials of creation. As I think of the
poets whom I know and have known and of my relations with them, the
air about me grows bright and warm with friendliness.</p>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>LITERARY GROUPS</h2>

<p><i>(Inaugural Address to the Sydney University Literary
Society)</i>
</p>

<p>That I-a lecturer whose talk so many of you are forced to endure
at painfully regular intervals&mdash;should be asked to address you
now is a proof of extraordinary kindness on your part, or of
extraordinary cruelty; I am not sure which. You are compelled to
attend my lectures. Is it from a stern sense of justice that you
compel me now to maunder at an unaccustomed hour? But really I am
as much the victim of fate as you. Still, I believe in compulsory
lectures, because they bring together, in impressive surroundings,
a number of young enthusiasts of similar tastes and aspirations.
And no young people are more likely to gain enormous benefit from
this enforced companionship than those who delight in literature
and aim at literary expression. Nothing clarifies thought more than
the effort to communicate it; nothing expands and corrects it more
effectively than free discussion. And if you desire your literary
purpose to be clear and precise&mdash;to move directly to its goal
instead of wavering uncertainly towards it&mdash;nothing will help
you more than the necessity of exercising your critical faculty on
the work of others. At first you will find your own work so near
that it will not be easy to focus a critical eye on it; you will be
too ready to offer yourself explanations and excuses. You will not
find it easy to stand off and take an impartial view, and your
personal interest will possibly blur your judgment. But when you
are accustomed to taking the critical attitude towards your
friends' attempts, you will very soon be able to join with the
others in detecting the genuine merits and defects of your own.</p>

<p>Hitherto there has been no attempt, at this University, to
organize the literary group for that mutual criticism which is the
most effective form of mutual help. At all times academic birds of
the literary feather must have found comfort and encouragement in
each other's company; and, as the students increased in number, the
need of a Literary Society became more imperative. You have
recognized the call and have answered to it. The result of your
organization, it may be hoped, will not be overlooked in future
histories of Australian literature.</p>

<p>We had nothing to hold us together in the old days, except our
magazine <i>Hermes.</i> There was no Union building, and our
common-room was a bleak place, furnished with cane-seated benches
and sawdust-bedded spittoons. <i>Hermes</i> was not the organ of
the Undergraduates' Association, but the private property of the
editors. Just before I came to the University, the men who were
working most actively for the struggling journal were Dick
Windeyer, H. R. Curlewis, Leslie Curnow, Jim Pickburn, Vallack and
Chris Brennan. On turning up the file in the Fisher, I get the
impression of an academic fashion&mdash;a mixture of assumed
seriousness and extreme flippancy. The most consistently flippant
of the group seems to have been Brennan, the most purposely earnest
was Windeyer; Curlewis held the balance by being seriously
humorous. When I arrived, Pickburn was still an undergraduate, and
during my course and for a while afterwards he and I conducted
<i>Hermes.</i> There were others on the staff, but, as always
happens, the work fell on the small minority. He supplied the
brilliance and I suffered the anxieties and heavy yoke of
copy-collecting. He was the only colleague in whom I had
trust&mdash;the only one in whom I recognized a genuine literary
talent; and his high enjoyment of the immediate present and facile
methods of making the most of the moment prevented him from
developing his gifts. He knew no discipline. He was wayward and
exuberant, an able speaker, an accomplished parodist; and one
always felt&mdash;this particular one always felt&mdash;that he was
squandering mental treasure. His admiration of heroic sacrifice and
his sympathy with the oppressed made him an almost fanatical lover
of William Morris. Honours students may be interested in his
translation of "The Battle with Grendle's Mother" into the verse of
<i>Sigurd the Volsung</i>; it was issued on 23 May, 1892. But he
shone chiefly as a writer of light, brisk prose and of hilarious
verse. When an irreproachably attired Englishman filled for one
year the chair of the mathematical professor, it was Pickburn who
put into his mouth the Swinburnian chant beginning&mdash;</p>

<p class="pin10">Lo, I am a man<br>
Most faultless of raiment<br>
I am he that began,<br>
When Gurney away went,<br>
To lecture on high mathematics in Sydney for similar payment.</p>

<p>It was he, too, who produced an excellent drinking-song, of
which I recall the opening lines&mdash;</p>

<p class="pin10">Or ever we sever and part<br>
I must drown the dull care of my heart;<br>
All you who think with me, come here and drink with me,<br>
Drink, ere we sever and part.</p>

<p>The evening students of those days were in evil case, and we day
men knew nothing of them and never thought of them. The Union has
made a difference since then. I doubt if Dowell O'Reilly wrote
anything for <i>Hermes</i> while he was attending evening lectures,
but I had made friends with him elsewhere, and soon he was quite a
constant contributor. When the paper was issued three times a term,
and the proprietors had to disguise their multifarious
contributions by anonymity and a variety of pseudonyms, a constant
contributor was like an angel with manna. He began at the end of
1891 with a story galled "A Theosophical Romance" and a revised
version of one of his brief but much-polished lyrics&mdash;"The
Loves of the Rivers." Later he contributed a metrical serial, "The
Rime of a Hairpin," in six Fyttes, characteristically fantastic and
satirical. But his most memorable contribution was a delicately
beautiful poem, "The Sea Maiden," as light and lovely as foam
itself. This we printed on 17 October 1893. He was always at his
best when a seawind blew his verses into shape.</p>

<p>You must understand that we young University writers were not
and could not be closely associated. Even Pickburn I should not
have seen with any frequency, after he became a law student, had we
not both been active members of that excellent body, the Dramatic
Society; and the best of our helpers were no longer at the
University.</p>

<p>Among those of our contributors who have since gained some
celebrity as men of letters was Brennan. He had ceased to be the
perpetrator of high spirited jokes and nonsensical paragraphs. His
first published poem was a sonnet which appeared in <i>Hermes</i>
on 6 November, 1891, after his departure for Europe with a
scholarship, and it expresses very plainly the austere courage of
an intellectual adventurer:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pin10">Farewell, the pleasant harbourage of faith,<br>
The calm repose 'neath sunny skies and bright&mdash;<br>
Or was it darkness, vainly thought the light,<br>
And all we worshipped but a fleeting wraith?<br>
Me from that haven, with vexation fraught,<br>
Doubt drives to wander: in adventurous bark<br>
I follow e'er, 'neath lowering skies and dark,<br>
O'er gulphs of gloom and misty seas of thought<br>
Upon their oar-blades' vanished track, who sped<br>
To greet the rising sun, if sun there be.<br>
Yet never unto them that light was shown,<br>
Nor ever, since these mingled with the dead,<br>
Hath sun arisen on that shoreless sea,<br>
Nor man won way into the vast Unknown.</p>

<p>This was, I believe, Brennan's first attempt at poetry, and if
it has not the strong individual note of his collected verses, it
has the advantage of being universally intelligible. The following
number contained a sonnet in reply, laboriously compiled by some
theological students at St Paul's, who thought that a skiff that
had been driven from the shores of Roman Catholicism might be lured
from dim horizons to the safety of an Anglican roadstead.</p>

<p>All that we can reasonably hope, Brennan once said to me, is
that we may survive, by virtue of one or two pieces printed and
reprinted in anthologies. He and Dowell are sure of that measure of
immortality, if of no more. But the worst of the unencouraged
University <i>littérateur</i> is that he is apt to allow his
ambitions to be swamped by the waves of worldly interest, or to
abandon his pilgrimage for the sake of some more alluring quest. I
can think of many a man whose promise thus remains unfulfilled. And
sometimes a cruel destiny cuts the branch that might have grown
full straight.</p>

<p>There was a very interesting group just before the war. You will
see the names of a couple of them in the <i>Oxford Book of
Australasian Verse.</i> In that volume you may read the sonnet in
which Duncan Hall tells how he feels the majesty of Night and hears
"The shudder of her plumes among the pines." But Duncan is more
widely known for his comprehensive book on <i>The British
Commonwealth of Nations</i>&mdash;work of a kind which begins to
grow obsolete almost before it is completed&mdash;and at present he
is in Geneva, preparing, for the League of Nations, reports on the
drug-traffic. He has rightly followed the most insistent call.</p>

<p>Of that same group was Roderick Kidston who then listened to the
voice of Oine.</p>

<p class="pin10">In a land of many waters, by a sun-forsaken
lea,<br>
Oine, fairest of the siren daughters, gave her heart to me;<br>
And her voice was low and tender, and her tresses floated free,<br>
But her eyes in magic splendour mocked the foaming-crested sea.</p>

<p>His poems were sometimes thin in substance but always had a
sufficiency of poetic meaning, and he was a master of melodious
rhyme and rhythm. Perhaps he attained a limited perfection too
early and despaired of further triumph. He sits now in the
unfertile dust of the law.</p>

<p>An intimate comrade of his was the brilliant young wit, Adrian
Consett Stephen, who bade fair to be a dramatist of distinction.
But then came the war, and darkness.</p>

<p>I have not forgotten another notable group&mdash;that which
included Leslie Holdsworth Allen and Henry Mackenzie Green. The
University Librarian knows more about it than I.</p>

<p>What I wish to emphasize is that all of those young literary
entrants of the past would have profited by such an association as
you have happily founded, and that Australian literature would have
gained appreciably.</p>

<p>And outside the University, too, there is no association that
will provide for writers and other artists the kind of social
intercourse which would give incentives to the original worker.
What we want, I suppose, is a place where we can go when we please
with a sure and certain hope of meeting congenial spirits, and
where we can talk and listen as we please, on the topics that we
find of common interest.</p>

<p>There is a Junior Literary Society, of course. It admits young
writers "provided they are over sixteen years," but I've not been
told at what age the membership must cease, nor the degree of
youthfulness which disqualifies one for enrolment. I am not feeling
old, myself, but I doubt if they would admit me, after finding out
that I was writing for the press in the eighties. Mrs Curlewis
("Ethel Turner") is the president, but, as her books prove, she is
eternally young. As long as you are no older than she, the Junior
Literary Society should attract you. It provides a springboard for
diving into journalism of the more literary kind, and encourages an
enthusiasm for artistic effort. I hope that it may presently supply
your own society with annual recruits.</p>

<p>The Women Writers have their own organization, but what they do
no man may dare to guess. And there is a Fellowship of Australian
Writers, which gathers once a month in a noisy room to hear
discussions and lectures, but has no premises of its own.</p>

<p>Casting an eye over the last thirty years, or thereabouts, I see
the phantoms of several little clubs in Sydney&mdash;regular
gatherings of men who took a special interest in literature or
included it in their devotion to art at large.</p>

<p>One of these was the Dawn and Dusk Club which clustered about
that lover of smooth verse and beautiful images, Victor Daley. I'm
not sure that it was bound by any severe regulations, or that its
meetings were more notable for intellectual communion than for
conviviality; but it was satirically stated that it derived its
name from its practice of meeting at dusk and parting at dawn. Had
I been a member, no doubt I should be able now to rebut the
slander. Roderic Quinn was one of the happy band, and with him were
Billy Melville, Bertram Stevens, who was always defying his
philistine instincts by giving his hat a Bohemian tilt, and Fred
Broomfield, who swaggered and boomed with melodramatic fervour,
talked with vociferant eloquence, and swept up the ends of his
moustache with the air of a Bobadil. The late George Taylor was
another haunter of Dawn and Dusk, and, indeed, was the chronicler
of the Club. His little book, <i>Those were the Days,</i> will
interest you all.</p>

<p>The Boy Authors were a very different crew. Though I was
privileged to attend their meetings, I understood that I was not a
fully qualified member, but at best an out-patient. The name of the
club indicated no more, I suppose, than that they were of the
coming race&mdash;that they had the buoyancy and faith and force of
a new generation. They tolerated a few visitors, but they
themselves were the real thing. The world would never be the same
again when once they had "arrived." They had all the confidence of
creative genius. Among them was a vigorous young man, not, strictly
speaking, an author, but a painter and a boxer, whose name was
George Lambert&mdash;a fellow of power and ambition, to whom
difficulties were a pressing invitation. He had the deep humility
of the true artist, though humility was almost the last quality
which his friends would have ascribed to him; he knew precisely
what he could do, he judged his own potentiality aright, and he was
aware of the need of development. It must have been he who set the
tone of the whole club. Strength of character is always an
impressive quality.</p>

<p>W. B. Beattie, another Boy Author, was a musician, a teacher of
singing, but he had lately blossomed into literature, and "The Love
Story of Tamar Niell" was being published in the short-lived
<i>Australian Magazine,</i> with illustrations by his friend
Lambert. It was a highly original story, for the name of the hero
was Chelub. I remember watching Beattie languidly dropping sheet
after sheet of a voluptuous romance on the floor, as he reached the
end of the manuscript page. He read his own words unemotionally, as
if they were the list on a washing bill&mdash;as if his lovely
princess, who rose pinkly glowing from her bath of snow, were no
more than a frog in a puddle, and his ecstatic prince a small boy
waiting to nab it.</p>

<p>Arthur Adams also was there. He had not yet lost the ingenuous
shyness which he brought from Maoriland, and he uttered his verses
with a world of tender appreciation. Since then he has attempted to
veil his native sentimentalism with a figleaf of worldliness.</p>

<p>There was a more prosaic style about Souter&mdash;the artist who
is haunted by impossible cats that he created in an unguarded
moment. He was a watchful critic, humorously awake to
absurdity.</p>

<p>Women attended the meetings, too&mdash;after unavailing protests
from some of the members. The lady who was to become Mrs Lambert
wrote short stories, and, as Lambert considered that she, at least,
ought to have a chance to read them, of course she had to be
admitted. And Louise Mack, looking round and fluffy and infantile,
settled into a cosy chair like a chicken in a broken egg-shell. In
those days, the presence of women seemed inevitably to mean a
suppression of normal thirst, so the meetings closed with the
distribution of sweet biscuits and small cups of coffee.</p>

<p>One evening, Brennan was invited to come and read something of
his own composition. He came, perched uneasily, and read&mdash;</p>

<p class="pin10">Because this curse is on the dawn, to yield<br>
her secrecy distill'd of nuptial tears,<br>
and day dismantles, casual, nor reveres<br>
whate'er august our brooding dream reveal'd;<br>
because that night to whom we next appeal'd,<br>
no more gestation of inviolate spheres,<br>
shameless, is mimic of the day, nor fears<br>
the scant occurrence of her stars repeal'd:<br>
<br>
Therefore, if never in some awful heart<br>
a gather'd peace, impregnable, apart,<br>
cherish us in that shrine of steadfast fire,<br>
<br>
be these alone our care, excluding hence<br>
some form undesecrate of all desire,<br>
the wings of silence, adamantine, dense.</p>

<p>The wings of silence folded heavily over the astounded company,
till Louise Mack timidly asked the poet if he would mind reading
his sonnet again. With fitting solemnity he read it again. There
were murmurs of thanks, and inarticulate ejaculations. Criticism
was stricken dumb. For once at least the educational purpose of the
Boy Authors lay gasping for breath.</p>

<p>That society lasted only a few months. Perhaps its vitality was
drained by the departure of Lambert for Europe. It was otherwise
with the Casual Club, which survived for many years. The Casuals
began as a tiny group gathered for reasonable conversation by R. F.
Irvine. They dined together in town once a fortnight, and then
repaired to some artist-member's studio, where they sat and smoked
and said the wisest things they could force their brains to
formulate. In those days one could get a fairly good meal for a
shilling, and when we took to haunting a dining-room where we paid
eighteen-pence each, and had the privilege of drinking a kind of
red ink which, though it was called "ordinaire," would not have
proved a satisfactory substitute for the fluid sold by stationers,
one member at least complained that the expense was excessive, and
pined in exile. The rest of us became extravagant. We abandoned
ordinaire and bought burgundy, which the proprietor evidently kept
in a very dusty place. The waiter treated the dirty bottles
reverently and carried them round in a basket to match. That is the
height of luxury; but even then we were not contented but sought
out new inventions. We bought supplies on our way to the studio,
and a regiment of bottles stood to attention and then manoeuvred
about the table while we talked. The talk became less deliberately
sapient, but not less brilliant. The number of members increased.
Sometimes visitors came and dined with us and were granted an
opportunity to converse with us. Hornell, the English artist whose
pictures are made up of a harmony of flowers and foliage and
blossomy childhood, was one of our guests; another was Jack London,
who talked about the ways of prize-fighters; and I have vivid
recollections of the burly Randolph Bedford, breezily telling
stories that require the full force of his personality to produce
their extraordinary effect. One evening, too, a well-known
journalist dropped in, and I knew by the dignity of his bearing
that all was not well. Our burgundy tipped the scale towards
insobriety, and he grew portentously irritable, till at last he
challenged the meekest of us to a duel. We escaped the swashbuckler
by scattering, as if the "casualty" were over; but we gathered a
little later in a wine-shop.</p>

<p>When a studio was not to be had, a wine-shop was a comfortable
rendezvous, and there was one which provided an excellent retreat
among portly barrels in a rather dimly-lighted cellar.</p>

<p>The club had only one rule&mdash;that every member should be, ex
officio, a vice-president; there were no other office-bearers. It
was generally agreed that there should be no speeches.</p>

<p>In the course of time, some members discontinued their
attendance, though not their membership&mdash;once a casual, always
a casual, dead or alive&mdash;and new members drifted in. One of
the eldest in years among us was the youngest in
spirit&mdash;Julian Ashton, the veteran artist, a sturdy fighter in
the cause of art, and consequently a firm opponent of many of his
fellow painters. The talk, when it turned on art, was illuminating
to all of us. Julian Ashton learned what he had not realized
earlier, that words must be selected and placed as carefully as
colours, and immediately he tried to apply this new lore by writing
some prose sketches, which he ventured, in defiance of all
precedent, to read to us. In all his talk there was a flavour of
what would be called cynicism in a less happy and genial spirit. He
thought this was the result of long observation, the fruit of
experience, an opening of the eyes to reality. Of course it was
temperamental. He sucked it with his mother's milk. It was always
welcome. Would one ever quarrel with the bitterness of beer at its
best?</p>

<p>If he was the youngest member, his son Howard was the most
elderly; his scornful maturity was decisive. He was as incompletely
equipped with doubts as a fossil with nerves. Even Arthur Adams,
who had adopted all the cynical certainties of the <i>Bulletin</i>
office, seemed a simpering youth by contrast. But let me hasten to
add that Howard Ashton was then, as he is now, a thoughtful,
original, and able artist; and I should not venture to jest at his
expense if I were not aware that his sympathies are as liberal as
his knowledge is wide and his talent manifold. One passion of his
childhood he retained under the veil of scientific research: he
swapped locusts with collectors who foraged in other lands.</p>

<p>The most buoyantly enthusiastic member was Lionel Lindsay, who
blew in like a sea-breeze, and spoke in quick brief sentences, with
rapidly repeated monosyllables that he fired like a Lewis gun.</p>

<p>We had two men who shone as wits. First came Norman Gough, the
French lecturer, whose swift word-play was so slick that its
flashes were a dance of white sparkles. W. B. Beattie was no less
witty, but his manner was less vivacious and his jests, over which
he himself chuckled infectiously, were even more telling.</p>

<p>Dowell O'Reilly, watchful and eager-eyed, was slyly provocative.
He was equally a delight to look upon, whether he were obstinately
argumentative&mdash;patting his arguments with his pipe-stem, as if
they were foundation-stones&mdash;or joyously absorbing the general
chatter.</p>

<p>But I cannot describe them all&mdash;Harry Weston (with his air
of innocent surprise at his own jokes), Souter (using a Scottish
accent, and scratching the palm of his hand on his stubby head),
Bertram Stevens (who had the reputation of an impartial Boswell),
J. J. Quinn (the beaming authority on French fiction), Sid Long
(whose refined taste for good wine made him a little untrustworthy
as custodian of our surplus supplies), Leon Gellert (who went to
the war to find out if he were a coward, and came back, as he said,
convinced that he was), Hal Eyre (the cartoonist, a dryly humorous
raconteur), Radcliffe Brown (the bearded young anthropologist, who
left us to become Director of Education at Tonga), H. S. Nicholas,
Arundel Orchard, Carl Kaeppel, Vivian Crockett, the universally
informative A. W. Jose, the wandering Austrian, Hemmer (who was
afterwards deported for his follies), and the rest of the varied
company which was held together by good-fellowship and a devotion
to art.</p>

<p>In its latter years the club was dominated by Brennan. His
scholarship was broad and deep, his artistic interests varied, his
voice a thunder from the Olympian throne. What he said came with
authority. Whatever the topic, his knowledge was a charm that could
command silence in all but the flippant or foolish. The club had
found its Johnson, and became gradually a group of admirers and
disciples. Its tone changed. It lost some of its effervescence. Its
very existence depended on its dictator.</p>

<p>I offer none of these other clubs as a model for you. If you
have any originality you need no model, but will create your own
manners, breathe an atmosphere that no predecessors have inspired,
and help each other in ways peculiar to yourselves; but there are
some qualities that you must have in common with these
others&mdash;a joy in life, an impulse to artistic expression, a
willingness to learn, a 'readiness to be of service. A true
comradeship will then bind you together, and the world in which you
live will be the better for it.</p>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>HENRY LAWSON</h2>

<p>Was it a taste for the gruesome that caused a Grammar School
boy, so many long years ago, to cut from the <i>Bulletin</i> a poem
that presented a haunting vision of a dead but unresting
figure?&mdash;</p>

<p class="pin10">Heaven! Shall his ghastly, sodden<br>
Corpse float round for days and days?<br>
Shall it dash 'neath cliffs untrodden?<br>
Rocks where nought but sea-drift strays?<br>
<br>
God in Heaven! Hide the floating,<br>
Falling, rising face from me.</p>

<p>These, at any rate, were the first of Lawson's words to impress
my imagination, and from that day I saved from the papers what I
found of his work, and waited for a meeting which I felt to be
inevitable. Several years passed. I came to the University and was
swept by the general current to a degree. Early in 1894, Miss M. J.
Cameron, a school-teacher from Old Junee, who was saving the money
required of intending settlers for the Communist colony in
Paraguay, asked me to have tea with her and Mrs Lane at Enmore.
Lawson, who had recently returned from his wanderings along the
Darling, was to be present. They had begun the meal before I
arrived, for I had some difficulty in finding the house, and, as I
stepped into the room, I saw facing me, with head bent forward and
eyes dark and deep and eloquent looking up at me, a lank, shy,
bearded young man. He rose rather awkwardly, mumbled a brief
greeting and sat once more, watchful and silent. By an incautious
movement of his arm, he clumsily upset his tea, and was filled with
mute confusion. The talking was maintained chiefly by the two
women. I was thinking of Lawson, and he spoke only with his
appealing eyes. But at last we two emerged into the night together,
and his tongue was loosed. We drank each other's health at the
nearest bar, and walked down to the Quay, happy in a new
comradeship. He was full of his experiences in the bush, where his
deafness, sensitiveness, diffidence and a melancholy tendency to
dwell upon the pains of life had exposed him to misunderstanding
and misery. As we turned the corner of George Street, near the
Quay, he stopped and stared at me with all the grey wisdom of
youthful disillusion. I was talking of democracy and the future
that the workers were about to win for us all. "Now listen," he
said. "I know what I'm talking about. I couldn't say it in public
because my living depends partly on what I'm writing for the
<i>Worker;</i> but you can take it from me, Jack, the Australian
worker is a brute and nothing else." Such was the bitterness in his
heart, after association with the careless, rough company of the
shearing-sheds. It was a mood, but one that was characteristic of
his shrinking self-consciousness. His condemnation was harsh and
unjust, but it was honest and heartfelt. Read his sketch of "A
Rough Shed," which is true in every detail, but shows only one side
of the truth&mdash;and you will understand. He was to make full
amends in many a tale and poem commemorating the courage,
generosity and self-sacrifice of the Australian worker.</p>

<p>He was lodging in North Sydney with an extremely tolerant aunt,
whose temper was not in the least roughened, even when we once
broke our way into her house in the small hours, and ate what was
intended for the family breakfast. She merely supposed I must be
another poet.</p>

<p>For several years we were closely associated, wandering together
into strange nooks and corners and enjoying our Bohemian adventures
cheerfully and irresponsibly. We shared a common purse; I mean
that, when we were together, the one who happened to have money
spent it, and the other accepted the arrangement as a matter of
course. A gift was not a gift between us, but a natural sharing of
the bounty of Providence. Sometimes when our supplies were on the
ebb, we would save our last florin for a final flourish. There was
a broad, cool, low-ceiled bar, where the best free-lunch in Sydney
was to be had, and adjoining it was a sheltered winter-garden.
Behold us at a marble table with foaming tankards of ale at
sixpence each. We made significant signs to a waiter, whom we had
tipped liberally when we could afford it, and he brought us gratis
a meal of choice dainties, as much as we could eat. Magnificently
replete, we lolled indolently in the winter-garden, smoking
sixpenny cigars, and then lounged into the street, penniless and
content. But ordinarily, three-penny beer and scraps of bread with
little squares of cheese sufficed. Even so, we were sometimes
surprised by the sudden simultaneous assaults of penury and hunger.
I remember one night when three of us sat on the kerbstone in
Dailey Street, and happily shared a dry tea-cake&mdash;the largest
meal we could get for fourpence. Each of us had tried in turn to
charm a pretty shop-girl into adding a small pat of butter, not for
cash but for love, but the eye of the proprietor was on her, and
she rejected our prayers with a reluctance that was almost
tearful.</p>

<p>It was after a similar accident that Henry and I found ourselves
astray, very late, with insufficient money for a bed. The Domain
had a broad and hospitable breast, but already a fine rain was
visible at every lamp-post. Besides, in the Domain one was liable
to lose one's boots. Henry said he knew of a Dago lodging-house, in
the vicinity, where the price of a doss was not too high, but he
doubted if it was very savoury, and he feared that the temper of
the Dagoes, stirred out of their sleep, might result in violence.
Still, we required a roof, and we dared damnation. The dingy door
opened after repeated knockings from without and an incoherent
growl from a window. A dirty-looking pirate with a lighted
candle-end clawed us hastily into a dark, narrow passage, shut the
door and asked our business. He spoke a kind of English, but his
expression was foreign and unfriendly. He said he had no room. We
indicated the floor of the bare passage. He expostulated. We stood
our ground. "No room!" he said with a snarling emphasis, and,
beckoning, he led us up a rickety staircase, of which the
hand-rail, broken away at its lower end, swung over empty gloom
when I inadvertently put a little pressure on it. He opened a door
and threw a dim light upon rows of men sleeping on the floor. Some
had blankets, some lay merely in their clothes. A fair number had
ancient mattresses, but those who were on the boards were probably
subject to less disturbance. Here and there, shoulders heaved
impatiently and legs straightened or drew up as the candle rays
fell on the forlorn crew. A rank odour pushed at us. I entered the
room, stepping gingerly over the slumbering figures, but in the
dark I made a false step. I trod on a man&mdash;not on any thick or
squashy part of his fat body, but on some unimportant outlying
portion. I don't know what language he talked, and as the sympathy
of the crowd seemed to be distinctly with him, we waited for no
interpretation. "I tell you so!" exploded the landlord, shaking his
greasy black curls at us as he drove us into outer darkness.</p>

<p>One day I helped Henry in his moving from a cheap lodging-house
near the Cathedral, to McGrath's Hotel. His worldly goods were in a
large sack, and I was rather surprised at its weight. We took turns
in carrying the load on our backs. Everything in that bag was in
admired confusion&mdash;togs, scraps of copy, photographs, and a
general miscellany. He promised to show me a particular photograph,
and dived into the mass. His head and shoulders were out of sight
but the movements of the sack indicated that he was rummaging
actively, and, somehow or other, he found at last what he was
seeking as well as some manuscript which he had given up as
irretrievably lost. He emerged, red, ruffled and triumphant.</p>

<p>It was at McGrath's that I obtained an insight into his mode of
composition. He asked me if I minded acting as his amanuensis, for
he always hated the labour of pen-driving; and we went to the
parlour with a few sheets of paper. He walked up and down, sorting
in his head a heap of couplets almost as disorderly as his luggage
in the sack. For weeks he had been composing what was to be a poem.
As he selected and recited the verses, I scribbled them down.
Sometimes, after reflection, he altered a phrase. Sometimes he
changed his mind as to the most effective order of the couplets.
"Stop a bit, Jack," he would say, "I think we'll stick that verse
in, a bit lower down." It was an eloquent, swinging poem, partly
heroic in tone and partly ironical and humorous, and it was
probably the longest piece he had ever put together. He afterwards
submitted it to Mr George Robertson of Angus and Robertson's, who
thought that it would be better if the comic element were omitted.
Nothing easier. So adaptable was Lawson's gunyah style of poetic
architecture that he published the work as two separate poems. "The
Star of Australasia" and "After the War" are the titles adopted in
the final version.</p>

<p>A number of Lawson's friends used to meet us occasionally at
McGrath's. There I first met the fair, observant, smiling Roderic
Quinn, who stretched his long legs and beamed benevolently over his
pint. "Peter Anderson" rushed in in the intervals of
rent-collecting. Frequently the broad, jolly face of "Dan the
Wreck" appeared. No seediness of costume or cloudiness of linen
could quell his geniality. He had been to the Grammar School and
retained a few shreds of Latin, so he bore the reputation of a
scholar with bluff dignity&mdash;or dignified bluff. "Arma virumque
cano," he assured me at our first meeting; and I agreed that it was
an excellent procedure.</p>

<p>Then there was Jack Moses, teetotal traveller for wines, who was
known all over the country for his recitations, his humour and good
nature. I don't believe there was ever a better-hearted friend than
Jack, or one who regarded Lawson with more affection and respect.
He seemed to have made himself responsible for the poet's hats. I
have seen him take Lawson's hard-hitter as we walked along George
Street, gaze at its dim and indented crown with disapproval, and
drive his fist and arm through it. That was his way of proving that
he must provide a new one. Lawson told me that once, when the hat
was just a little too good for such treatment, Jack made him swap
it for the ragged headgear of a street beggar. He remembered, ten
minutes later, that he had hidden half-a-sovereign in the lining.
But the beggar had vanished. I met Jack at the Cathedral on the day
of the funeral and we gripped hands, neither of us able to say a
word of what was in our hearts.</p>

<p>On the wall of my room hung a pair of foils. I was a little
dubious when Lawson proposed to try his skill with them, but he was
so eager that I consented. I explained the difference between
lungeing and prodding, and gave him a hasty lesson in thrust and
parry. The ordinary methods were too fine for his vigorous temper.
He made the blade swish and whistle as he swung it, and if I hadn't
known something of single-sticks I should bear the marks of that
combat still. To hold a weapon excited him. He felt gallant and
exultantly martial. What a panic he created when he found a sword
in a wine bodega and hunted the proprietor on pretence of a
chivalrous regard for the poor man's wife!</p>

<p>All that was before Lawson married. Neither of us were married
in fact. Later we saw less of each other; but we never forgot.</p>

<p>His wife had sympathy, patience, humour, energy and resource,
and she needed them all. She did her best for Lawson, encouraging
him in his moods of depression, and guarding him against himself
and others. And, in those old days, he understood and was grateful.
No one who saw them in their home could doubt the love that bound
them. He spoke to me with deep gratitude of her staunchness and
self-sacrifice. He congratulated me on my love of a dark girl. "The
dark ones are the best, old man," he said. Mrs Lawson was dark.</p>

<p>A boy was born to them in New Zealand, a girl in Sydney. Then
they went to London. I was at the boat, where Henry, bright and
hopeful, stood with a child in his arms. He was fond of children,
and nothing wrought upon his heart more swiftly and deeply than
their light, tender love and pity. He tried to appear at his best
in their company. They seemed to know so much. After the return to
Sydney, a time came when Mrs Lawson boldly faced the future alone,
fighting for her children. She steeled herself to work with
incessant energy, to find opportunities to earn a living for her
delicate boy and gentle girl. She had to part from them, having
secured them a healthy home in the country, while she was battling
on their behalf. At last she was able to keep them with her, and
she brought them up nobly, and taught them to honour their father.
And they know that no better mother lives in all the world.</p>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>OUR COUNTRY</h2>

<p>The inartistic visitor is apt to complain of monotony in the
scenery of Australia. If he has witnessed no more than some part of
our coast, he says that the place is gum-trees, rocks and gullies,
varied by rocks, gullies and gum-trees. If he has travelled inland,
and has seen, at the beginning of the day, flat land with tormented
trees, and, when the day's journey was over, still tormented trees
on the stretching plain, he moans at the interminable sameness.
"Your foliage is all of one tone of grey," he says, petulantly,
"hard and changeless." He has come looking for something to which
he is accustomed&mdash;the almost garish brilliance of colouring
and the persistent contrasts in some country where such brightness
of growing things is happy compensation for the lack of our clear
flooding light&mdash;and he is blinded by prejudice and unjust
without intention. He is like one who has long been accustomed to
flutes and fiddles and pianos, and who hears for the first time a
carillon; the new instrument has unanticipated effects. Before the
listener can adjust himself to the fresh conditions, he is
impudently loud in condemnation. Ours is a country of vast spaces
and endless munificence. For the full range of its almost infinite
variety you must travel far, and, if your soul is awake to it, you
will find beauty at every step from the extravagant lushness of
tropical jungles to the clear-cut snowy slopes where the clouds
hold counsel, from the green-gold brakes of the sugar-cane to the
shining cherries that demand the discipline of frost.</p>

<p>Traditions die hard. It was an Englishman who described our
country, in awkward sibilant verses, as&mdash;</p>

<p class="pin10">A land where bright blossoms are scentless<br>
And songless bright birds,</p>

<p>repeating the accusations of early settlers, who were pleased to
regard Australia as a land of paradoxes; but the lyre-bird, with
all his musical mockery, and the manifold fragrance of our spring
have not yet shamed the libellous lips even of some Australians to
absolute silence. And there are still some among our countrymen
whose eyes are open but their sense is shut, so that in their
ancestral trance they are unaware of the subtle and glorious
changes of our seasons. One has to tell them that the face of
spring blushes in the pride of youthful life; to show the vital red
flush glowing on every bush-clad hill; to insist that the spreading
gum-leaves are "like spear blades dipped in blood," and that in
every glen the ferns advance their croziers of delicate rosy tints.
This one may observe with exultation in the Sydney district where I
happen to live. Of course, too, though there is no month when the
bush is void of bloom, there are seasons when the flowers rejoice
multitudinously in the light. And inland where, in a dry season,
the grey plains bake, and the red soil cracks, and the heat quivers
visibly up in a crystal silence, or the dust advances, a body of
threatening darkness, and the roly-polies, globular skeletons of
perished plants, run and leap fantastically for miles and miles,
there is no time when beauty is not present, brooding and menacing
though her aspect be till the rains come and bring a resurgence of
riotous life and splendid colour.</p>

<p>And if it be true that the eucalyptus generally dominates our
scenery, who but the pitifully ignorant will babble that gum-trees
are all alike? Look with me at these two&mdash;that with the dark
grey, fibrous crumbly bark on its trunk, while its boughs are
smooth and silvery, and every branch and branchlet curves upward
making an interlaced pattern adorned with broad but rather scanty
leaves of dull green that reflect the light in silver flashes; and
this, with the smooth bark of pale terra-cotta tint from the foot
of its knobbed bole to the end of each of its erratically contorted
boughs, its thick clusters of narrow leaves in a lighter green
mottling the undergrowth with shade. How many kinds of gum-trees
there are I neither know nor care to know; to the eye of love their
variety seems inexhaustible. And an artist will find in a single
tree a multiplicity of charm that custom cannot stale. A gaunt
grey-blotched giant of the bush, with the long strips and cylinders
of dry discarded bark hanging about him, will stand like a sentry
sternly at watch in the noontide glare; but amid the evening
shadows his outline will soften and he will seem like a waiting
lover in sheltering dusk; and in one of those mornings when the
early sun turns to a silvery film the mist as it floats upward
aslant, he will become etherealized, an ecstatic spiritual calm
embodied or an old tree transfigured to an image of peaceful
joy.</p>

<p>In the mass the gum-trees proclaim Australia. They give some of
their most unmistakable characteristics to many of our landscapes.
Before the war, a German scholar, Robert Schachner, spent a year or
two in our land, studying its social and industrial conditions, and
becoming more and more attracted by its loveliness. On the eve of
his return to Europe, he went back to the Blue Mountains to gaze
for the last time across a valley where the heads of innumerable
gum-trees were like a sea swept by huge waves that surged against
the bases of islanded rocks and swept about the cliffs, pushing
upward at vast shores where the mordant wind has revealed, in the
crumbling sandstone, broad bands and splashes of red and cream and
yellow. All the valley and the hills were suffused daintily with
hazy blue, and across the uneven surface of that sea crawled the
indigo shadows of white glowing clouds. "Of all that I have seen in
Australia," said Schachner, "this alone I shall see nowhere
else."</p>

<p>From the precipice beside him a stream leaped into the gorge,
falling in waves that felt the support of the air and floated
downward swaying and curving in their own ghostly mist, and finally
"rolling a slumbrous sheet of foam below." For those hills are full
of clear creeks that dance and sing in the cool shade, and fall
where they may in veils and lucent fringes and long wavering lines.
Yet the queen of all Australian waterfalls is not in the Mother
State, but in the island of Tasmania. Not for size or grandeur, but
for enthralling beauty, one returns to the glancing cascades of
Russell Falls.</p>

<p>And what differences one may notice in our streams, whether they
be these hurrying waters of the hills or broad placid streams that
loiter as if enchanted by their own lily-decked attractiveness.
Between steep banks, where the thick pale gumtrees gather, flow the
inland rivers on meandering pilgrimage. On a coastal river one may
voyage between fields of maize and sugar-cane and rest the eyes on
blue hills that flank the valley. And one stream of sweet water
that calls to the tired spirit is hemmed in by rugged precipitous
crags, clothed with such trees and shrubs as perch upon ledges and
cling by crevices; and the short steep talus is thick with a tangle
of wild growth. It is an abode of peace and friendliness, of
blessed quietude, in harmony with clear reflections of blue and
green and the still trunks of tall white trees that grow sparsely
just above the average floodline. All is well till the noise of
guns shatter the silence with blasphemous reverberations of
stupidity and tyranny.</p>

<p>It is not the purpose of the writer to attempt impossibly to
enumerate the elements that combine in the beauty of Australia, but
merely to glance here and there and idly sketch this fragmentary
scene or that, not fully, but by suggestion&mdash;to sing, as it
were, as they come to his memory, a few bars of the songs that have
thrilled his heart. And as he hails from Sydney, his reader will
expect him to say something of the most beautiful of
harbours&mdash;its estuaries winding among wooded hills; its
verdant gardens sloping to the shores; its innumerable inlets; the
rich green weeds that shine at low-tide about its rocks; the
jade-coloured waters at the Quay; the stretches of sunlit turkis
blue; the jewel dance of lights when the night is like a pall of
deep-blue velvet; and, in short, that fascinating splendour that
alters with every change of light and atmosphere. But one who has
watched the spread of population about the harbour for half a
century is saddened by the reflection that the beauty created by
Nature is more often marred than enhanced by the meddling of Man.
Greed and vulgarity do their worst. Where there should be groves of
native trees behind our beaches, for example, there are staring
walls of brick and stucco. It is to the honour of our best
architects that they adapt dwelling-houses to their chosen
situation, harmonizing the buildings in line and colour with their
surroundings and skilfully making alliance with the forms and
forces of Nature; but all our houses are not designed by men of
taste, and there is unfortunately no committee of artists empowered
to protect us against piles of horror. Still, Nature has been so
profuse in her gifts that her generosity triumphs in spite of the
wanton insults she sustains.</p>

<p>If generalization were legitimate, I might venture to say that
Australians have not much aesthetic sense. It is only a few years
since some observant person told them that there was a beauty in
"gum-tips." They have been engaged, ever since, in destroying the
charm of every gum-sapling within easy reach. They cultivate in
their gardens a few Australian plants which they are assured are
beautiful, but they neglect others which appeal without a human
champion. Few people cultivate, for example, the
blue-berry&mdash;<i>Elaeocarpus reticulatus (E. cyaneus).</i> But
those that have eyes to see, let them see.</p>

<p>Our artists are doubly to be congratulated&mdash;first that they
live in a land of lavish beauty, and secondly, that they have taken
such full advantage of their wealth of opportunity.</p>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>TRAV'LIN</h2>

<p>In Australia, we have tramps of two kinds, and neither class
exclusive of the other. On the one hand there are those whom
circumstances saddle with a swag; on the other are the born
wanderers, the men who have not where to lay their heads, but who
drift into the open ways simply because the wind calls to them.
When home grows too hot, a man must move. When work is not to be
had in one place, it must be looked for in another. And so the
rolled-up blanket is heaved to the shoulder, and away goes another
vagabond on the track. And when the shearing-season commences,
there is a flow of swagmen to the inland districts. When the sheds
are cut out, the attractions of the towns are irresistible. These
fellows do not concern us. They are trudging to clutch money or to
spend it, for the most part; or maybe, in some cases, because it
has been spent. The type is too common to be interesting. But
occasionally the wind and sunlight winnow and burn away the
conventionality&mdash;the husks of vulgar aspiration&mdash;from a
man's soul; and then, if no new interest enthrall him, he is a
wanderer for ever. Perhaps, when the season is dreary&mdash;when
cold and cheerless skies face a sodden drooping landscape&mdash;he
may take to work and a roofed-in fire for a time, but the fret is
on him, and glowing green and infinite blue will call him forth
again on the quest. He seeks the face of Beauty, and because he
does not know for what his heart cries out, he grows lonely, and
perhaps daft. There are many hatters on the track. Old men totter
towards a dusty sunset rather than submit to confinement in an
"asylum." Young men march from station to station until their only
conscious object is the filling of their tucker-bags. But their
hunger is not to be satisfied with a ration of flour and tea. Even
when their mouths are filled with the last poor meal of crumbled
earth, I think the keenness of their appetite is yet undulled. On
the northern tableland in winter a frost-bitten outcast staggers on
gangrened feet until he finds a corner where he may die in comfort;
after a hellish summer of drought, the dry leathery shell of a man
is found on the western plains. But the fret of the wanderer is
never to be overcome by death.</p>

<p>Many men feel the curse of custom and long for a simpler life.
Many are eager for the knowledge which only comes to the man who
can "loaf and invite his soul." Many love sunlight and seashine and
the glitter of leaves. They need not tramp for ever, hopelessly,
madly, towards an unseen goal. Most of them are trammelled by
duties. Some are almost Respectable. I advise them to spend their
holidays on the track, sleeping in caves and under trees, with
tramps and the stars for congenial company. If you need a change,
why not be yourself for a while? Strip off your coat and trousers
and shirt of false comfort, conventionality and miscalled Decency,
and bathe freely in the flood of life. Incidentally you may find
out what you can do without&mdash;and do better. You are not the
swathed-up mummy you seem to be, trust me. You are alive and as
free as need be. Do not think of staying at home. In the sordid
city you are, perhaps, a pauper alien. If you wish really to be at
home&mdash;in the citadel where you are master of yourself and have
the wealth of the world at your command&mdash;off you go, adrift on
the open road.</p>

<p>And whither must you travel? What matter? I can only give you
bare hints of places I have wandered in myself. In New South Wales
there are many temples where Pan may be fitly worshipped. The
inland country is great in distances, but a country of sheep is a
country of flies. To slouch along a blazing track, with the weight
of a swag and water-bag sending a blade of pain down between your
shoulders into your chest, while the flies swarm busily with
tickling feet and sucking trunks over every inch of sunburnt
flesh&mdash;this is the fate of the luckless trav'ler of our land
of the golden fleece. There is nothing more maddening than those
flies, and no amount of fury will prevent their crowding and
fighting for place about your eyes like pigs about a trough. Only
at night can the beneficent Pan prevail over the hordes of
Beelzebub. The broad, silent night is good, when your limbs feel
the luxury of rest that none but the weary know. The white blaze of
the stars is glorious; but one need not walk so far to see the
stars. The coastal slope of this State is the really beautiful part
of it&mdash;the part which our brethren find most ready to the
spoiling hand. In the Blue Mountains, if you know how to make your
way along the ranges without losing yourself among deceptive spurs
and bewildering gullies, you will find pleasant byways and secluded
beauty, where you may worship at shrines undesecrated, so far, by
the offerings of the profane&mdash;sardine-tins and greasy
newspapers. And along the main road (if you know where to look) you
will sojourn in pleasant hostelries (namely, broad sandstone caves)
where guests are welcomed free of charge. All are on equal
terms&mdash;hearty shearers, perennially flowing with cheerful
obscenity of speech; drink-ruined artisans seeking new fields of
labour and intoxication; quaint old grey-beards who hate the
monotony of settled life, searching for a temporary billet; young
men from the land, slow and drawling, afoot for the city; the
reckless black-sheep of his family, whose humour baffles all
inquiry, as ripples hide the secrets of a pond; the low-browed
ruffian who may be off with your boots and blankets while you
sleep, and will stop at no small obstacle if he thinks that you
have money in your pouch&mdash;a suicide tramp is no surprising
object; and many another. Among the rest you may even chance on a
simple-minded bush poet, with a fringe of corks dangling on strings
about the brim of his hat to keep off the flies. He will
laboriously compose descriptive verses and sell them, if possible,
to a local journal. The rest will "bum" the neighbouring township
for their tucker. None will stay long. If you spend each night of
your holiday in the same cave&mdash;especially in rainy weather, at
the beginning or end of the shearing-season&mdash;you may have no
lack of human comradeship, and may learn a lesson of sympathy with
the unfortunate, the vicious and the criminal. (Pardon me, Madam, I
did not say with vice and crime. Even the Chief Justice must be
sympathetic&mdash;must be a possible assassin or burglar&mdash;or
what right has he on the bench?) The manufactured tragedy and
comedy of the modern theatre will, perhaps, appeal to you less
forcibly for a while thereafter, but that wild sea of dark
tree-tops is as fine a scene as the blue water which formed a
fitting background for the simplicity and pomp of Attic drama.</p>

<p class="cpb">* * *</p>

<p>It was on the mountains that I met old Harry and his mate Tom,
just after they had been attacked by garrotters, at Katoomba. Tom
told me how it happened:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Arry always was an old fool&mdash;wasn't you, 'Arry?"</p>

<p>"Fool yerself," said Harry, complacently, spitting into the
fire.</p>

<p>"It ain't long since I met 'Arry, you know, but it was jest
about time some one begun to take care of 'im. I was at the
Ringer's Arms in Bathurst, where I'd been doing a few little jobs
for the missus for a few days. And one day she come out in the yard
and says, 'Tom,' she says, 'jest come through inter the bar and see
yer own shadder.' 'Garn,' I says. 'Fair do,' she says, 'there's an
old bloke in there wot's the very high tentacle dead spit o' yer,'
she says. So in I goes, and there stud 'Arry, like me as two
flamin' peas&mdash;same beard, same size, same way o' liftin' a
glass."</p>

<p>The superficial resemblance he referred to was very slight. Any
two unshaven long-hoarys of average size would present as many
points of similarity. But I only said: "A long-lost twin brother I
suppose?"</p>

<p>"No! Never seen 'im before that minute. But the missus says,
'Ow's that fer a feller's double?' an' everybody in the bar said it
wuz wonderful, an' 'Arry shouted the lot. An' after a bit we got
talkin' together, an' we 'ad a few drinks&mdash;'Arry paid for
'em&mdash;an' we got quite chummy, an' we've bin mates ever since.
And 'Arry told me 'ow he was pretty well off up in Goulburn. He
owns a tannery there, don't y' 'Arry? But he got to thinkin' o' th'
old days when he use' ter 'ump his bluey like the rest of us, an'
'e thort of 'ow 'e 'adn't bin to Sydney fur twenty bloomin' years.
An' 'e ups an' says: 'I'm goin' down,' 'e says, 'to see the
champeen boat-race, an' I'm goin' to walk there an' back,' 'e says.
So 'e puts thirty quid in notes into 'is pocket, an' waltzes down
the road with 'is matilder till 'e runs across me in Bathurst. An'
after tellin' me this, 'e tells me 'ow 'e finds the track lonesome
without a mate, an' the end of it was, I come on with 'im. Well, 'e
soon showed 'e was a goat with money. 'E'd yank out a handful o'
notes if 'e was on'y buyin' a plug o' terbacker, an' wotever I said
cudn't stop 'im. But, night before yestiddy, 'e shouted a crowd in
Blackheath, an' I seen some ugly-lookin' blokes in the bar lookin'
at the bundle o' money when 'e changed a note. Tried to make 'im
drunk after that, they did, but I was too fly for 'em. I told 'im
afterwards 'e was a fool&mdash;didn't I 'Arry?&mdash;an' I fixed it
up we wouldn't camp till we'd got a good way on the road. It got
dark early with a lot o' thick clouds, but we went on, although it
got that thick at last you cudn't see the edges o' the trees. By
and by, 'Arry says, 'Where are we, Tom?' 'e says, 'I reckon it's
time we camped,' 'e says. 'Well,' I says, 'I'm beggered if I know,
but wait a bit,' I says, 'there seems to be somethin' here I
oughter know.' An' I lights a match an' has a look, an' sure
enough, we were alongside o' the Explorers' Tree, near Katoomba y'
know. I'd put down me swag while I was lookin', and now I got out
me plug and opened me knife to cut a fill. 'Arry says: 'Come on;'
so I heaves up me swag, with the knife and plug in me 'and. Then,
in the dark an arm was crooked round me neck so's to hold me head
back, while I felt a hand inside me coat. But 'e 'ad more than me
neck. In hoistin' the swag I'd lifted me elbow up level with me
face, an' it jest happened that he gripped right round me arm an' I
wasn't bein' choked at all. And me knife bein' in me left 'and, I
jest stabbed with it over me shoulder where 'is 'ead or neck seemed
to be, an' 'e gives a yell and lets go, an' I 'eard 'im go for the
fence an' over, an' then I 'eard a bump an' a scrape an' a thud
down the railway cutting, an' some one says; 'Are y' 'urt Jim,' an'
there was somebody else runnin' down the road. An' then&mdash;it
wasn't till then&mdash;I 'eard 'Arry about twenty yards ahead
singin' out to me askin' what was the matter."</p>

<p>"It was all over in what you might call the shakin' of a sheep's
tail," explained Harry.</p>

<p>"So we reported it to the pleece in Katoomba, an' we went back
an' traced the blood across the line an' into the bush, an' then we
left it till mornin'. But you know what a rain there was night
before last. There wasn't no traces in daylight."</p>

<p class="cpb">* * *</p>

<p>If you have only a little time to spare, and would like to
travel through country where there is a greater variety and
tenderer charm of scenery, I advise you to saunter down through the
Illawarra and Shoalhaven districts. Tourists and manufacturers and
other go-ahead people will have the place spoiled before long, so
you had better go now. There you will find broad panoramic views as
bright as ever painter dared to put on canvas&mdash;long stretches
of coast with dazzling white lines of foam between a brilliant sea
and beaches like golden sickles, and a series of headlands growing
dim and more dim till the most distant fades into purple mist where
the sea-line and the sky are blent in a region of dreams. You will
see broad flat meadows with sleek dairy cattle luxuriously chewing
the cud; green rounded foothills where the sunlight and shadow play
over brown furrows, and chase each other across young crops that
blaze like sheets of green fire. And on the higher slopes are the
thick tangles of semi-tropical jungle, with cool shadows and
drip-dropping water, and graceful ferns and palms and festooned
creepers, and fresh and sudden gushes of song from birds that flit
like happy spirits through the fragrant dusk.</p>

<p>If you have more time, go northward along the coast, to the
rivers that water some of the most beautiful valleys in the world.
Do not waste your time and mine by getting me to babble about it.
Find out for yourself.</p>

<p class="cpb">* * *</p>

<p>Whenever the spring arrives the hunger of the trav'ler is upon
me. Bricks and mortar are offensive, and yet certain bonds keep us
tethered to the city, and I cannot drift away through the moist
haze into the outer regions of "the track." I feel my chrysalis
cracking down the back to let me out with quicker nerves for the
new life. But what is to be must be. As I lie on the edge of a
field to pencil down these few inconsecutive and lazy notes, I
watch the illumination of the crimson leaves of some buckwheat
which the frost has failed to kill (a branch of bush-apple overhung
and protected the soft, sappy growth). A kind of wild bee or fly
hovers motionless with triangular blurs in the place of
wings&mdash;makes a horizontal dart of several inches, and again
halts. Many spiders creep about under the shade of the weeds, and
just now I had to flick away a scorpion which seemed determined to
take refuge under my arm. I can hear a spine-bill singing in the
bush; and a wagtail is chattering everlasting compliments to his
mate&mdash;<i>"Sweet pretty creature&mdash;sweet pretty little
creature&mdash;pretty little, pretty little creature."</i> Across
the horse-paddock a pair of Jacky Winters are calling to each
other. A few hundred yards away there is, I know, a yellow robin's
nest, containing three eggs, dull green speckled with brown. In the
morning the swallows, which have built their mud homes under the
veranda, sing like canaries about my window. As I think of all
this&mdash;and of how much more!&mdash;a final crack of my shell
follows on a vigorous wrench, and I stretch my wings to fly for the
bush. Old clothes, familiar swag and nose-bag, battered billy and
longing heart&mdash;to-morrow the open road!</p>

<p class="cpb">* * *</p>

<p>So I wrote in the first year of the Commonwealth. Since then, an
age of high-pressure and disastrous hurry has made many of our
youth almost incapable of genuine indolence. Instead of enjoying
happiness, the crowds are madly pursuing pleasures in the strange
belief that they can be accumulated and that the sum of them will
be abiding joy. The wayfarer can no longer slouch comfortably along
the open road, but has to be on the alert and ready to jump from
the course of swerving motor-cars. But the motor-car is a curse to
its user as well as to the furtive pedestrian. Motorists believe
that they have special advantages for seeing the country, and this
strange deception persists till its victims become blind to
everything but broad effects and mere dashes of colour. From a car,
all the intimate detail of the landscape is obliterated, and the
friendliness, the feeling of close kinship with what is gathered by
the senses, is dulled and gradually lost. The loveliness of a tuft
of grass, or the delicate mottling of a post with lichen, or the
inverted depth of blue sky in a watery rut enters unbidden the
consciousness of the man afoot, but is ignored by the motorist, to
whom the passing beauty is a smudge. A road, to please the staring
votaries of speed, must be black or grey and glassily polished by
innumerable tyres. The old roads, which here were brown and there
might be an earthy red that harmonized restfully with the green
grass at its edges, must give way to the long unlovely streaks
which are constructed without the slightest effort to meet the
demand of the soul for what is beautiful.</p>

<p>It is impossible to saunter in a motor-car. Nobody in a car is
free. I sit jammed between people for whom a general motion in any
direction is insanely regarded as desirable progress. For a moment
I see a clear stream with mossy rocks and smooth foam-fringed
little falls, and I should like to follow it up in the deep shadows
of overhanging shrubs, and rejoice with the ferns whose eager life
is evident in the flush of uncoiling fronds. I see soft-looking
leaves that I should like to touch lovingly. I want to bathe all my
senses in what is flashing back from our inhuman machine&mdash;to
smell the warm moist earth, let the lapping water flow over naked
limbs, put my tongue against cool aromatic growths, remain still to
watch the birds and hear their songs. I could merge myself in this
environment, and become a part of it. Phut! It's gone. We are
aliens.</p>

<p>Where are we to find rest? The car penetrates everywhere. The
fastnesses of the hills are invaded. The stillness of the valley is
desecrated. The haunts of meditative fancy are bestrewn with tins
and paper. Vulgarity is rampant in the sullen bush, and every quiet
solitude has been transformed to a wilderness of monkeys.</p>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>DOWELL O'REILLY</h2>

<p>There can be no better way for two young men to gain an intimate
knowledge of each other than to tramp together for the sake of mere
enjoyment. During the day, they may often be far apart, unless some
convention of strict continuous companionship mar the fraternal
freedom, but, when the lazy labour of the road ends in the indolent
relaxation of the camp, and tucker and tobacco have made a
temporary home, a resting-place in the wide universe, the time
comes for careless self-revelation. Talk in those hours when the
little circle of light and warmth seems lit in a friendly
infinitude of darkness, and the heart is exalted in its loneliness,
has now and then hardly more definite limit of reticence than idle
soliloquy. Though I had enjoyed a close friendship with Dowell
O'Reilly for two or three years, it was in January 1894, that I saw
most clearly what manner of man he was, for in that month he and I
shouldered our swags and drifted haphazard through Tasmania. Yet it
is not of our talks together that I would tell you now, but rather
of the way in which he met the accidents of our wayfaring and the
people into whose lives we sauntered and from whose memories we
passed like a summer cloud.</p>

<p>He had something of the chameleon nature that takes colour from
environment, and that was why "Raggles," to use his adopted name,
was so delightful a travelling companion. He became a creature of
the wild, consciously, humorously, and he and I drifted on a stream
of common inclination, hither and thither, almost without
consulting each other. And just as he seemed native to road and
river and forest and lake, so that the gracious loneliness of
nature was never disturbed by him, so he adapted himself without
effort to the manners and moods of such friends as each day gave
and took. His quick sympathies knew how to evoke confidence. The
tones of his voice varied like an actor's to the occasion. A mile
beyond New Norfolk we met an old woman, whose bright eyes were set
in a harsh wrinkled face over which elf-locks of grey hair
straggled. Her back was bent to a great load of dry saplings and
fallen boughs, the ends of which trailed on the wet road behind
her. "Good morning, Mother!" was Dowell's salutation. In a few
moments, in spite of her protests, he had shouldered her wood and
we were heading again for the little town. His tenderness to the
rugged woman was musical in every intonation of his voice, and his
few questions brought out a vivid story. There was abundance of
firewood rotting each side of the road, but the owner, whose name
she gave, was accustomed, through "pure doggery," to prosecute
anybody who set a leg across his fences, so she had to drag her
supply from a distance. She had no family left. Once she had been
better off, and sold milk and butter, but competition in washing
New Norfolk linen had forced her to sell her cows one by one.
Luckily she could live on "the half o' nothing," but if it were not
for the hop-picking she'd have less than the half of that. I
remember his wistful smile as he bade her good-bye&mdash;a smile of
humorous understanding&mdash;and her hearty handgrip.</p>

<p>Sometimes his adaptability was shown in more purely laughable
fashion, as in our dealings with a Hobart cabman, whom we hired to
carry our bags of decent clothes to the railway station for
transmission to Launceston. The quiet streets were almost free of
traffic, and the cabman turned easily on his box-seat and chatted
with us, giving occasional encouragement but no visible guidance to
his leisurely horse. It must have been Dowell who introduced the
topic of beer. The cabman flew amiably to the lure. Did we like
good beer? We did. And plenty of it, cheap? That also. And we had
no particular train to catch? We were almost at the station, but
our chuckling driver turned his horse's head, and we went up into
the town again. The cabman led the way, at Dowell's invitation,
down a couple of steps to a bar, with sanded floor, and there, at
threepence a head, we enjoyed great glass jugs of cool foaming ale.
Then we completed our journey to the station, while Dowell and his
new crony talked as if they had known each other all their lives;
and when the luggage had been delivered, the good cabman was loud
in his disappointment that we wouldn't allow him to drive us back
to the bar and make return of courtesies. "It wouldn't be any loss,
you know," he explained; "I'd only be spending your fare." Humanly
he was right, though his logic was rickety. (Thirty years later,
when I revisited Hobart, I sought that sanded bar in vain.)</p>

<p>In Launceston, where we stayed a night or two at a homely
old-fashioned tavern, there was a typical maid of all work. She
warmed to Dowell, for the sole reason that he knew the tone of
frank friendliness, tinged delicately with condescension, which
would touch her heart, and was able to cheer her rather bleak
Sunday with prophecies of some glad to-morrow when "Mr Right" was
to provide all that she craved. I happened to walk into the room as
she was making the bed, and, when I saw how softly she was
smoothing one of the pillows, wondered how she had guessed that
Dowell slept on that side. How sentimentally pleased she would have
been had she known that in his pocket was the just-received
acquiescent answer to a proposal of marriage!</p>

<p>Ready as he was in assuming an interest in what interested other
persons, there was always a basis of sympathy for the assumption,
even when his tricksy spirit gave it an ironical aspect. It was so,
I felt, even when he discoursed with a Presbyterian minister in
solemn denunciation of "vestments." The three of us were walking in
single file on a narrow path that led through the snake-haunted
moors near Great Lake. The minister was in front with his eyes on
the track, and I was in the rear. Dowell had draped an exceedingly
dirty handkerchief across his haunches, and twitched it to a jig
whenever the word "vestments" was uttered. His abundant sympathies
were divided between the serious churchman and irreverent me.</p>

<p>Even when his insinuating friendliness had a practical aim, it
was genuine, and that was why he was so successful a mendicant,
when we were in need. Those to whom he appealed, if they had
hearts, were glad in response. I was taciturn and shy, a mere
Asticot to his Beloved Vagabond. Was it not he who accosted in the
streets of New Norfolk the veteran berry orchardist, Mr Plunkett,
and secured from him an invitation to the raspberry mazes at Glen
Fern, where the picking was in full swing? And do I not remember
that night at Bridgewater, when I asked an old lady, after looking
over her fence, if she could spare a few potatoes? The idiom of her
doubtful reply proved her Irish, and Dowell's voice was beautifully
tinged with brogue as he put in a coaxing word. She gave us the
potatoes. "An' I'm sure you must have sons of your own," said
Dowell, beaming grateful affection, "an' you so kind to two boys
and them strangers." The random shaft struck deep. She had had a
boy; O'Reilly reminded her of him; but now she had no son. By no
means abashed, Dowell was lord of the conjuncture, and when the old
lady returned to the house a few minutes later, I was aware that
she was the happier for having met him.</p>

<p>How quick he was to seize the essentials of a situation and turn
them to advantage! We reached The Cressy one night, after a walk of
twenty-seven miles by bush and road, and Dowell was ripe for homely
comforts, so, instead of camping tinder a hedge, we sought an
hotel. The landlord left us in the parlour while he went to consult
his wife, who was apparently the manager. As he returned, I heard
her final directions: "Put 'em in the Professor's room." I had
never heard of professors who liked tramps in their bedrooms; but
fear of making intrusion was soon dissipated. This particular
professor must have been a legendary fugitive, for the room that
still bore his name was a tiny three-walled attic in which there
was barely room for two men to lie. Dowell looked at the kennel
with distaste, and, as soon as the landlord had gone creaking down
the dark narrow staircase, remarked that a window that wouldn't
open offered no facilities for escape in the event of fire; nor was
this his only objection. "No matter," he said at last, "I'll see
that we're given a better room." I urged him not to make a fuss,
but he asserted with decision that he would not ask for what we
wanted, and yet we should get it. He made his toilet with more than
ordinary care, used a brush and comb, shook and dusted his coat,
tied his neckerchief neatly and wiped his boots with his blanket.
At the tea-table his manners were the essence of refinement.
Without being importunate, he made it evident that he was
momentarily disconcerted by the lack of a serviette. Then his gaze
wandered over the tablecloth, till out hostess asked him,
pleasantly enough, what he was seeking. Apologetically, he
confessed that it was a butter knife; but "it was really of no
consequence." In conversation with the landlord, he talked
intelligently of horse-racing and politics, but kept making
accidental incursions into art and literature and then
self-reproachfully subsiding to the more popular topics. After tea,
he listened with keen appreciation to the piano playing of the
children, and asked who was the teacher of the younger musician,
who was evidently regarded by the father as an infant prodigy. The
conversation naturally turned to music, and Dowell's talk, crammed
with technical terms, was as unintelligible to me as to his other
hearers. "Quite right!" said the landlord at intervals. At bedtime
Dowell shook hands with the landlady with respect and heartiness.
We were on our way towards the narrow staircase when the landlord
called to us, "This way, sir!" and escorted us, with lighted
candle, to a well-furnished room on the ground-floor. And there lay
our swags on the bed.<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>So far I have given examples of Dowell's success in moving
people by word, manner and expression to active sympathy, but he
met with failure now and then, though very seldom, One afternoon,
when the clouds were gathering, we wandered about New Norfolk
looking for a roof to shelter us for the night. A casual passer-by
told us that Mr X, the wealthiest man in the district, had some
sheds where swagmen sometimes camped. Following directions, we
found three bare and weather-beaten little houses. One of Mr X's
employees, who lived close by, saw us approaching these huts, and
told us that they were in his care, and that he had orders not to
allow any trespassing. "I'm sorry," he confessed; "it's going to be
a rough night; but you can't expect me to lose my job for ye." He
advised us to see the boss. O'Reilly wished he had had a shave, and
his regrets deepened when, as we marched along Mr X's avenue of
blue-gums towards his comfortable home, we saw three young ladies
on the veranda. Still, he brightened at every step of our advance,
for he always seemed fairly confident of his charm when girls were
to be met. While he was still glancing with arch admiration, I was
asking if we might sleep in one of the old houses across the road.
The eldest of the ladies, regarding even poor Dowell with scorn,
replied loftily, "I don't think so, but I'll ask Pa." She went
inside, and a little later out strode "Pa," with his face red, his
grey hair ruffled, and the edges of his trouser-legs hitched over
the tags of his boots. Dowell, with an air of manly frankness and
thorough confidence in human goodwill, stated the case&mdash;that
we were sorry if we had disturbed him, but need not keep him long,
for all that we required was a shelter, however poor, against the
weather. But the old man was very grim. He snapped "No" at us, as
if it were a symbolic bite. Dowell grew eloquent in his claim for
compassion and trust. The night, he remarked, was thickening, the
sky was menacing, and we, poor harmless wayworn wanderers, were
faced with the dire necessity of sleeping in the open air. He
promised that we would leave everything as we found it. "Just what
the last two tramps said," was the comment of Mr X; "and they used
the lining-boards for their fire," Scowling and growling, the old
man turned his back, and the interview was over.</p>

<p>It was not long, however, before we met with a signal example of
hospitality. A couple of miles from the town, we noticed, in a
paddock, a fine belt of timber at some distance from the road, so
situated that a camp there would be sheltered from observation by
inequalities of the ground. A closer view confirmed favourable
impressions. By the time it was dark, we had cut an abundance of
bushy saplings, built a thick gunyah, and strewn a springy bed of
foliage. Before this luxurious nest we made a huge fire against a
solid back-log. Then into the cheerful radiance strolled a man. We
nodded. He looked about. Desperately assuming a childlike
innocence, I blurted, "No harm, I suppose, in camping here for the
night?" He shook his head at once. "I don't mind," he said. There
was a long pause before he added, "'Tain't my land."</p>

<p>In the highlands to the north of Bothwell, Dowell was rebuffed
once more. The day was far spent, the wind bit shrewdly, and, in
that country of igneous rock and stark forest, there was no place
to camp, without more preparation than we cared to make. Imagine
our relief when the bush-track brought us to the home of a
shepherd. Light shone from a window of the small slab cottage. Dogs
barked, voices were heard, and a door opened. A large-bearded man
stood in the doorway, and over each shoulder and at each side were
the necks and heads of peering girls. "This will do us," Dowell
murmured. He played the unfortunate hero to perfection, and his
handsome animated face must have had its effect on the girls,
though their father was adamant. "You can see for yourself," said
the shepherd, "that I've scarcely got room for my own family." I
asked if we might shelter in a smaller and older building that
loomed about a hundred yards away in the clearing. "If the sheep
and pigs'll let you," he assented; "that's the remains of where I
lived before I built this place." There was one room of that ruin
in fair order, though the door was off its hinges and there was no
window frame. The sheep left quietly, but the pigs retired
unwillingly and noisily from their sleeping-quarters. Some fowls,
that had been roosting above on a joist, fluttered protestingly
out. With shingles we shovelled out the more solid dirt, and
scraped the flooring boards. Then, in the dimness of the night, we
cut great bundles of grass and reeds that grew beside the creek,
and made of them a carpet and a bed. It was no comfortable camp.
Dowell looked wistfully out of the window-space towards the
shepherd's house, and sighed. We used the door as a necessary
barricade against the pigs, fastening it in place with wall-slabs
from another part of the dilapidated building. Early in the
morning, a white rooster found his way into our sty, and I woke to
find that he had pecked all the soft bread out of our last
half-loaf. I crumbled a fragment of crust and sprinkled it gently
on the blanketed form of the sleeping Dowell. The rooster sprang
greedily to the attack. There was a sudden outcry from Dowell, a
flapping of the blanket, and a wild squawk from the terrified fowl.
"I don't care how soon we leave this place," admitted Raggles. It
was the only occasion on which he was very nearly ill-humoured. He
regained his faith in human nature when, on the shore of Lake
Crescent, we found a solitary shepherd who had just cooked his
breakfast, and who, hearing that we were still fasting, cheerfully
shared it with us.</p>

<p>Truly we found the Tasmanians a hospitable people, and almost
invariably I fared the better for having so attractive a companion.
At Bothwell it was certainly Dowell's easy talk that caused young
Evans, the storekeeper, to introduce us to his wife and partner,
invite us to dinner, and even offer the diffident Dowell a loan of
his razor. And Wilson, the police inspector on the road to Great
Lake, having heard from Evans that we were coming, welcomed us
heartily and gave us a couple of meals and a night's lodging. And
the shepherds, too, about the shores of Great Lake, treated us as
guests. Old Jack Early gave us his best bunk to sleep in, and
furnished it with an ample possum-fur coverlet. Doran entertained
us at lunch in the midst of his splendid tribe of young Dorans, to
say nothing of the wombats that pushed about our legs as we sat at
table. Palmer, the gigantic red-bearded youth, who drummed heavily
on his chest as he cried "It's good to be alive, ain't it?" was a
little uncertain at first whether he should shoot us as detectives
in search of possum-trappers and trout-spearers, or fraternize and
be glad of our company; but he took us to his savage heart at last.
And then there were the Brandums!</p>

<p>Mrs Brandum's neat weather-board cottage commanded a magnificent
lake view from its panelled front door and its lace-curtained
windows. Inside, the place was miraculously, not to say painfully,
tidy and clean. The bedrooms had dressing-tables with lace cloths,
and the curtained beds were adorned with spotless coverlets. Every
chair displayed its immaculate antimacassar. The fireplaces were
daintily proportioned to the rooms.</p>

<p>I call the house Mrs Brandum's because it was evidently built
and furnished to suit the taste of that brisk, practical
grey-haired Scottish lady, who spent her life, so far as I could
gather, in household tasks, the tanning of native skins, and the
working of antimacassars, though her bookshelf showed that she was
willing also to read such books as came her way.</p>

<p>Behind the house was a bark hut, such as most of the shepherds
inhabited&mdash;a dark, low-browed, smoky place with a fireplace
constructed to accommodate great logs. There, in the evening, sat
Mr Brandum, "old Dan," smoking his cutty, for tobacco was forbidden
amid the antimacassars. He was a typical old shepherd, grey-bearded
and brown-faced, rugged in character, dress and general appearance,
and an alien to his wife's precise and persistent culture.</p>

<p>At first, Dowell was a great favourite with Mrs Brandum, for he
showed a bright interest in her belongings and
acquirements&mdash;her tanned trout skins, her vegetable
patch&mdash;and that really was interesting&mdash;, her volumes of
fiction and theology, her knitting, and her excellent cookery; but
all this was changed when a Scottish minister arrived and began to
revive memories of her native land. The Rev. Mr Thompson spent the
evening in the house, interchanging scraps of dialect with his
enraptured hostess, while Dowell and I swapped yarns with Dan in
the hut. Mrs Brandum may be forgiven if she regretted that her best
bedroom had been assigned to her two swagmen, while her redheaded
compatriot, who dreamed exclamatorily that he was being attacked by
snakes, had to suffer the indignity of second-best.</p>

<p>"How long do you think we ought to stop here?" Dowell asked, as
we were preparing for bed. I took a mental view of the bed of young
turnips, and replied that a couple of days more would be a fair
thing. "Well, I'm sorry," he admitted, "but I told Thompson we
might be going down over the Tiers in the morning. No matter! I'll
catch him early and tell him we've altered our plans." Man
proposes. After breakfast came family devotions. We pushed our
chairs back to the walls, and listened while the minister read the
parable of the prodigal son. Then we turned and knelt. The first
few words of the prayer were of the commonplace exacted on all such
occasions, but, with a sinking heart, I heard Mr Thompson&mdash;his
beard was of Judas' own colour&mdash;proceed to offer up a humble
supplication for "our young friends, who are about to leave us this
morning on a perilous journey." He was right. I have never met a
more convincing illustration of the efficacy of prayer.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>HENRY LAWSON'S GHOST</h2>

<p>At Gerringong there are two empty cottages on the slope behind a
long pale-brown beach. On the door of the smaller and older of the
buildings there are chalked many inscriptions to inform the weary
wayfarer that this is a "haunted house" and to warn him to "look
out for the ghost at 12." The verandas and partition of both houses
are gradually disappearing, for wood is scarce. Once there were
thick curtain-poles, a cedar mantelpiece and two cupboards in the
more recent abode. The cupboard doors, I recollect, kindled with
almost miraculous rapidity. The white pine lining is a
tradition&mdash;a sweet dream of the distant past. The flooring is
hard and unsatisfactory, but can be put to profitable use by a man
with a tomahawk. Even now there are traces of what was once a
garden, and evidence that a sanguine agriculturist planted his beds
with aloes and tomatoes. The whole of the surrounding estate is a
grazing-ground for cattle.</p>

<p>It was almost dark when we reached the familiar camp. Certainly
the light was not bright enough to justify a walk to the scrub at
the northern end of the beach in search of firewood. The foam shone
white along the edge of the dusky sea. 'Arry took the billy and
fetched water from the swamp which lies between the camp and the
beach, while I lit a fire in the fireplace of the haunted
house.</p>

<p>"Why not the big house?" said my mate slinging the billy on the
wire hook which was suspended from an iron bar in the chimney.</p>

<p>"This is cleaner," I explained.</p>

<p>"Smaller, and not so much room for the dirt," he amended,
unrolling his swag in a corner near the fire. "I wonder why they
say this place is haunted."</p>

<p>"Dunno! I reckon somebody put up a notice for a joke, and others
have added their little say. There's a new inscription there on the
wall to say: 'Prepare to die when the ghost tramps on the front
verander.' That must have been written by some fellow who was
wakened by the cows."</p>

<p>"No," said 'Arry, "here's the ghost now. Have you got the
tobacco?"</p>

<p>There was a shuffling step outside, as somebody made his way
carefully over the ruins of the veranda. Then the door was thrust
open and in stepped a traveller. He was small and dark, with a
Jewish face and bright eyes. He advanced and lowered his swag. In
accordance with etiquette he asked: "Any room, mates?" and I
answered: "Lots!" He asked the way to the water, but was obviously
glad when we offered to make enough tea for three. He took a piece
of raw steak from his nose-bag, and grilled it on a zigzagged piece
of hoop-iron that he found on the hearth. All the while, he chatted
of the usual topics of the road, told us which were the best places
for "tucker," and jeered at the wages offered by the Illawarra
pastoralists. "The local chaps take anything, and don't know any
better," he said. "A fellow who's never been out of the district
cuts a bit of a figure on eight bob a week." As he spoke he slapped
down his hissing steak on a slab of bread and said: "Billy's
boiling, I think, mates! in with the tea!" Then a happy thought
struck him. The ends of his moustache lifted, and wrinkles rayed
from the outer corners of his eyes, as he asked: "Ever read them
stories called <i>While the Billy Boils</i>?"</p>

<p>We had.</p>

<p>"Pretty good, ain't they?"</p>

<p>We thought they were.</p>

<p>"Read <i>When the World was Wide</i>?"</p>

<p>We passed favourable judgment on the volume of poems.</p>

<p>"Yes, some likes 'em," he murmured. He chewed a tough bit of
steak for a few minutes, and finally bolted it in despair. Then he
added: "Some don't."</p>

<p>We railed on the unappreciative.</p>

<p>He was sitting on his swag directly in front of the fire; we
were lounging on either side. He looked from one of us to the
other, and said: "You like poetry, an' you know what's good when
you see it. I don't mind telling you&mdash;perhaps, I'd better not,
though&mdash;O, bust it! I'm drinking your tea, too! well, I wrote
them poems; my name's Henry Lawson."</p>

<p>He looked round for admiration, and got it. When I considered
that Lawson's portrait had been thoroughly published throughout
Australia, I was charmed by the audacity of the little
impostor.</p>

<p>"Oh," I said, "do have some more tea!" And I refilled his
pannikin.</p>

<p>"If you don't believe me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, we do," 'Arry assured him, and I corroborated with
"Easily."</p>

<p>"I can prove it. You know Lawson's style&mdash;my style.
Something about it a chap can't mistake."</p>

<p>"Oh, there is&mdash;strong individuality."</p>

<p>"Well, run your eye over that."</p>

<p>He took a couple of dirty sheets of paper from his pocket and
handed them to me. I unfolded them and read these lines, which were
written in a neat round hand:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pin10">BILLY'S SWAG<br>
<br>
It was just before the diggers made a rush for Lie-an'-Rot,<br>
That the swaggie who was gone on Jimmy Nowlett's girl was shot;<br>
He was drinkin' in the shanty where she useter serve the grog,<br>
When Jimmy got the needle an' told him he must shog;<br>
But the gleam of Mary Carey's single eye was like a star<br>
Above a mighty tempest, as they bumped about the bar.<br>
<br>
They bit each other's noses as along the floor they rolled,<br>
(O, there's nothing in the present like the gory days of old!)<br>
They plugged each other's peepers an' they gripped each other's
hair,<br>
An' Mary laughed an' sooled 'em; but her dad begun to swear,<br>
For over every inch of floor an' wall they whirled an' crashed,<br>
Till every bit of glass about the bloomin' bar was smashed.<br>
<br>
In the corner by the counter was a sorter canvas bag<br>
Where Carey kept his cartridges with bits of oily rag,<br>
An' the lovers tumbled over, an' the back o' Billy's head<br>
Went bangin' on the canvas, an'&mdash;next
minute&mdash;he&mdash;was dead.<br>
He'd bumped agin' a cartridge, an' it freed him from his pain,<br>
For it went off like a blast an' lodged a bullet in his brain.<br>
<br>
We buried him in secret an' a belt of mulga scrub,<br>
An' fought about his blankets at the back o' Carey's pub;<br>
But I often think about him when I open out his swag<br>
Or pull my tea an' sugar from his swellin' tucker bag;&mdash;<br>
Of course he doesn't want 'em now, he's got his bed and board<br>
An' a rum-an'-nectar, maybe, at the shanty of the Lord.<br></p>

<p>I was astounded. The hand was the hand of Lawson, or a very
close imitator of his style. Had this bead-eyed little Jew written
the verses? If not, how had they come into his possession? "They
are pretty lines," I said, "pretty and pathetic."</p>

<p>He waved the paper aside when I held it towards him. "If you
think it's a good pome," he remarked diffidently, "you'd better
keep it. It's never been printed. Sometime, when you're on your
uppers in the city, you can publish it. You ought to be able to get
a couple of quid for it, if you tell 'em who wrote it. I don't
think it's quite as good as some of the pieces in the book,
myself."</p>

<p>I thanked him for his gift, and stowed it carefully away. The
conversation drifted to other topics. Lawson was enthusiastic in
his praise of Banjo Paterson. "Not but what I didn't like him at
first," he admitted. "First time I ever met him, we had a
fight&mdash;nothin' much you know; just a spar round&mdash;on the
Lavender Bay wharf. But, bless you he didn't mind. Took it well, he
did. Come up to me with his handkerchief to his nose and says:
'Shake hands, old man. You're a bit smarter with them paws o' yours
than you look.' And we've been friends ever since."</p>

<p>"I'd always heard Lawson was a bit hard of hearing," 'Arry said,
"but you seem to hear all right."</p>

<p>"Well, in Sydney, you know, a man has to protect himself agin'
these interviewers. If you sham stone deaf, it helps to keep 'em
off."</p>

<p>He related his discreditable experiences in Maori-land, and his
adventures in New Guinea. His revelations became more confidential,
more interesting, more unprintable. He represented himself as a
sentimental but unprincipled vagabond, and he libelled all the
best-known writers and journalists in Sydney. He gave a full and
brilliant account of a spree which he had enjoyed with a well-known
editor who is generally credited with a demeanour of almost
puritanic severity. He was carried away by the torrent of his own
eloquence, and the volcanic flow of his lurid unveracity swept over
politicians, actresses and the clergy. Nothing daunted him. He was
the most superb liar I have ever met.</p>

<p>When he was tired, and we could no longer supply him with any
more names to hang his purple stories on, he abruptly bade us good
night; and in a few moments no sounds were to be heard save the
roaring of the sea, the clicking of the sinking fire, 'Arry's deep
and regular breathing, and the snoring of "Henry Lawson."</p>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>A SNAPSHOT</h2>

<p>It was all Jim's fault.</p>

<p>Because he was a mounting member of the junior bar when he was
at home, he thought he carried an air of respectability with him
even in the bush. But after six weeks' wandering, with a swag and
without a razor, he lost much of his urban charm. I kept telling
him that he ought to wash every day, precedent or no precedent. I
anticipated a terrible degeneration at the outset, when I saw him
wrap raw steak and a copy of Shakespeare in the same bandanna
handkerchief. If it had not been for his untidy appearance, we
never should have come into collision with the police at all. And
his attempt to prove an alibi only made my explanations incredible.
As for his midnight recitation of <i>Sigurd the Volsung</i> in the
stuffy little lock-up, it was in bad taste, and was not calculated
to improve the temper of the sergeant.</p>

<p>We were having a smoke-oh on the wavy little path near Cox's
River when the man with scattered whiskers overtook us. He allowed
his skinny old moke to stop, and slid to the ground. He was so
thin&mdash;so obviously a skeleton with only enough fleshy covering
to satisfy the requirements of decency&mdash;that if he had
collapsed rattling into a heap, I should hardly have been
surprised. But he shuffled a few steps and then dropped suddenly,
as though his knee-joints had given way, and there he crouched. He
had nodded when he first came up, so he smoked in silence for a few
minutes, reaching from between his outstretched knees and clutching
fitfully at a tuft of grass. At last he said it was hot; and we
admitted that it was. He painfully discussed the weather of the
past week, smoked, spat, turned his rickety head on one side and
cocked a hollow eye at the blue, and prognosticated. Jim sat
leering at him, and grunted affirmatives. I tried variations on the
theme. Conversation flagged, and the man with scattered whiskers
was depressed and reflectively chewed his knuckles. After a pause,
he asked us where we came from.</p>

<p>"Jenolan Caves." I gave him the name of the last settlement we
had passed through.</p>

<p>It seemed at first as though that had closed the discussion, but
another idea was clutched from the grass-tuft.</p>

<p>"It's pretty dark in them caves, ain't it?"</p>

<p>"Black as the inside of a dark cell," I agreed.</p>

<p>There was a startled look in his haggard eyes, but it was not
until I noticed Jim's sinister grin that I realized that my simile
was ill-chosen.</p>

<p>"Not that I've ever been in one," I said hastily. "I don't look
much like a criminal, do I?"</p>

<p>He looked at me, shifted his gaze to Jim, and mumbled: "No,
mate, no. But looks goes for little."</p>

<p>I might have felt annoyed, but that his latter words seemed from
his manner to be no more than the utterance of a reassuring
reflexion. Jim, of course.</p>

<p>I tried humour, and it only increased his melancholy. His laughs
were mirthless snorts, delivered in couples. I told him stories
about snakes and fish, and they did not surprise him&mdash;only
reminded him of still more extraordinary occurrences. He related
his fantastical legends without interest and without hope of
exciting interest in his hearers.</p>

<p>The whisky flask happened to be in my inner coat-pocket, and it
still contained enough liquor for a nip, or a nip and a half if the
first man went easy. Under pretence of gaining shelter to light my
pipe, though the day was breathless, I went to a tree a few paces
behind the wretched traveller, and, glancing inquiringly over his
head at Jim, I exposed the neck of the flask. The man with
scattered whiskers turned suddenly, without a premonitory creak,
and saw me hastily thrusting something away, and wrinkling my
forehead at Jim. He too looked at Jim, and was in time to catch him
scowling blackly and shaking his unkempt locks at me.</p>

<p>"Are you going far to-night?" I asked weakly.</p>

<p>The man with scattered whiskers leaped at a chance of escape. "I
am that," he said. "So long, mates! I must be gettin'."</p>

<p>He "got" with unexpected agility. In a moment or two he had
flung himself at his horse, hauled himself aboard, and violently
prodded the creature's ribs with his large loose boots. The steed
woke with a start, jumped indignantly, and jerked itself over the
rise in a lumbering canter.</p>

<p>That the traveller had not gone very far before nightfall became
evident when he overtook us next day at the foot of Nellie's Glen.
He was afoot now, and carried slung on his shoulders two
half-filled sacks tied together by the mouths. We were seated in
the shade beside a waterhole. Perhaps he would have passed us, but
Jim called out: "Hello! Come and have a drink. My shout."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;er&mdash;," he began diffidently.</p>

<p>Jim cut him short: "Sit down!"</p>

<p>He sat.</p>

<p>There was dead silence.</p>

<p>It became painful.</p>

<p>I was determined to put the gentleman at his ease&mdash;to
remove from his mind the impression left upon it by Jim's
forbidding appearance. I thought hard. At that time Butler, the
murderer who used to take men prospecting and come back from the
mountain gullies without them, was supposed to be on the high seas.
Everybody was talking about him and wondering whether he had really
taken ship for America, or had given the police the slip and
concealed himself somewhere in Australia. I felt that here was a
subject fresh and cheerful.</p>

<p>I said: "I suppose there's no sort of suspicion that Butler may
be hanging about these parts still?"</p>

<p>"No, mate, no&mdash;oh no!" he jabbered ecstatically. "I 'aven't
'eard 'im mentioned&mdash;not lately&mdash;not what you might call
mentioned. No, there ain't no suspicion. Leastways, the police is
watching for him still, and he'd soon be caught if he was
to&mdash;not but what he couldn't walk safely enough along the main
road if he wanted to&mdash;if he didn't do anything suspicious
like. Small blame to him, I think. I wouldn't give him away."</p>

<p>"Even if you had the chance?" suggested Jim.</p>

<p>His jaw dropped. I saw that Jim was exercising a disturbing
influence upon him again. It disgusted me.</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "I'm off."</p>

<p>"Me too," said the man with scattered whiskers, rising shakily
under the weight of his sacks and setting his face towards
Katoomba.</p>

<p>His rear view was an extraordinary caricature. His clothes hung
upon his scarecrow frame-work in long limp folds. His trousers had
been let down a foot to compensate for the shortness of their legs.
The seat was drooping, a triangular bag, as though he had been
using it as a pocket.</p>

<p>There was a little kodak in our larger billy. "Can't you get a
shot at him?" Jim whispered.</p>

<p>I knew by the stiff jerkiness of the man's walk that he had
overheard; but what a snapshot he would make! I swung my swag to my
shoulder, took the kodak, handed Jim both billies, and stole very
quietly after the quarry. I concealed the camera behind my
nose-bag, and crept closer and closer. When I was well within
range, I pushed the button across to set the shutter. There was a
slight click, and the man with scattered whiskers looked round. His
mouth was open, and his tongue lolled over his lower lip. His eyes
were stretched as wide as he could get them without a rip at the
corners. He cast one glance of despair at me, and ran. I ran too.
Most of the path was in shadow, but here and there a broad band of
sunlight improved the conditions for snapshots. At last I aimed
rapidly and pressed the button. Then I gave up the chase. He tore
away up the steep path, taking the biggest and quickest strides his
trousers would permit. Breathlessly he took a short cut by way of
Bonnie Doon, and I saw him leaping the rocks like a wallaby, and
scooting along the path in the face of the cliff. I never expected
to see him again.</p>

<p>It was all Jim's fault.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>OFF HIS BEAT</h2>

<p>There is an iron tank of water at the High Range half-time
Public School, so travellers used to camp in the playshed. The
school itself is a wooden structure, with a large fireplace; but it
was always locked against the intrusion of wayfarers, until Jim and
I smashed in a pane of the window with a sapling, turned the catch,
and swung back the frame on its hinges. This method of effecting an
entrance was simple, easy, and productive of pleasant results; yet
nobody seemed to have thought of it before. Once in, we soon had
the door in working order. Then we stripped the bark from the roof
of the shed, and rigged ourselves a couple of comfortable bunks
opposite the fireplace.</p>

<p>In the morning, while I was still lying between my blankets, the
upper half of an unsavoury old tramp appeared at the window. His
felt hat was pushed back, and he was noisily scratching his
head.</p>

<p>"Mornin'," he said, in a dull, uninterested tone, and I grunted
a return greeting, and flung my arms out to stretch into working
elasticity.</p>

<p>"You lie pretty late, don't you, mate?" he inquired, with a
monotony of voice that was less suggestive of weariness than of
death or mesmeric somnambulism. "Sun's pretty 'ot out 'ere."</p>

<p>"Billy's just on boiling," said Jim, who was sitting in the
doorway mending his trousers; "better come in and have some
tea."</p>

<p>"I don't mind," droned the grey-bearded vagabond; "I ain't had
any brekfuss yet."</p>

<p>He eased himself of his swag at the door, entered, and sank
stiffly upon the long school form; and there he sat, while his
expressionless gaze crept over the surroundings. Slowly he drew
forth an ancient pipe and a little tobacco dust&mdash;the latter
wrapped in a twist of greasy newspaper&mdash;and with mechanical
continuity of action made preparation for a smoke.</p>

<p>"Got a match, mate?" he said, but without any note of
interrogation in his voice.</p>

<p>We supplied him; and he puffed away, making little popping
explosions every time he ejected a mouthful of smoke.</p>

<p>"What's the road like, on, that way?" He indicated the direction
with his thumb.</p>

<p>"Pretty fair," I told him; "tucker at most of the houses. Not
too many chaps on this road yet&mdash;nor likely to be."</p>

<p>"Which way'd you come?" Jim asked.</p>

<p>"Bourke," he said, with as much expression as a clock striking
one.</p>

<p>"Along the line?"</p>

<p>"No. Railway at Condobolin, and I crossed it again at Tichborne.
I came along through Cowra an' a place called Bolong, and right
along a track through the mountains. I'm not goin' back to the
railway."</p>

<p>"Lonely track?"</p>

<p>"I believe yer. Starvation."</p>

<p>"What's it like out west&mdash;along the Darling?" I
enquired.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, plugging the bowl of his pipe with his thumb,
regardless of the heat, "I've been there a good number o' years,
an' a man could always be sure of his rations; but it's played out
now, all right&mdash;just played out."</p>

<p>He sat gazing against the bare wall of the schoolhouse, but in
his dim, bleared eyes I could see the hopeless life-in-death of the
grey inland plains. Like the chameleon, his soul had changed to
harmonize with its environment, and his existence was a mirror of
flat, dry, monotonous desert.</p>

<p>"Where are you bound for Jim asked, as he pulled on his mended
breeches.</p>

<p>"I thought I'd try the Northern Rivers," he explained, in his
dead-and-buried voice.</p>

<p>I was taking the billy to the fire at the time. I turned and
stared at him, but he was unmoved. He meant it, if he was capable
of meaning anything. Jim winked. I gave the old man a pannikin of
tea and a lump of bread, and then set to work to enlighten his
mind&mdash;if he had a mind. I said:</p>

<p>"If you're going to the Northern Rivers district you'll have to
cross the railway again, unless you go round by the back of
Bourke."</p>

<p>"Not the Western Railway," he persisted.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Not the Bourke Railway."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I crossed it at Tichborne, so I must be to the north side of
it, you see?"</p>

<p>There was hope; he was beginning to show rudimentary reasoning
powers. I said: "That was a branch line&mdash;the line to
Forbes."</p>

<p>"Where am I now?" he asked, as though it did not matter,
anyway.</p>

<p>"Going towards Berrima."</p>

<p>He stopped chewing and tried to think. "Never heard of it," he
said. "Where is it?" and he recommenced his chewing.</p>

<p>"Near the Southern Railway."</p>

<p>The words failed to penetrate. He heard, but did not comprehend.
Perhaps his effort at thought had exhausted him.</p>

<p>"Now you're here, you'd better go up and have a look at Sydney,"
Jim remarked, cheerfully.</p>

<p>The expressionless eyes turned towards the door, as a day-old
infant's sight is attracted by light.</p>

<p>"Not me; I left Sydney in sixty-three, and I'm not going back
there any more."</p>

<p>Possibly a pathetic history lay behind the words. If so, it had
long since ceased to affect its hero.</p>

<p>"What'll you do?" I said, puzzled.</p>

<p>"Go north along the line."</p>

<p>"But then&mdash;don't you see?&mdash;you're south of
Sydney."</p>

<p>"By Gawd!" The exclamation was a bare form of words, without a
rag of emotion to adorn it. After a few minutes interval, he said:
"An' if I go south where do I get?"</p>

<p>"Melbourne."</p>

<p>There was a long silence.</p>

<p>"Where do yous come from?"</p>

<p>"South Coast&mdash;Illawarra and Shoalhaven districts."</p>

<p>"What's it like?"</p>

<p>"Dairy district. Nothing doing&mdash;unless you go in for
coal-mining."</p>

<p>"No chance of work," Jim interjected, decisively; "but there's
no end of tucker."</p>

<p>The old trav'ler picked up his pipe from the desk and put it in
his pocket.</p>

<p>"What more does a man want?" he said, simply. "Ah well." He
hoisted his swag, muttered "So long!" and plodded away mechanically
in the direction of Berrima.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>FROM THE BUSH</h2>

<p>DEAR BROOME,</p>

<p>There was a demonstration when we left Bullah Delah this
morning. A crowd of men clumped on the veranda of the pub and
cheered, and women stood in every doorway. I kissed innumerable
children, and took off my hat right and left. Smith says he can't
stand tommyrot; but then nobody offered him a drink.</p>

<p>We were making for Cooloongolook, but we missed one turning
through there being no signpost. Later on I wished they had
consistently omitted their posts right along. We left a path which
we should certainly have followed if a signboard, ambiguously
placed, hadn't misled us. Gradually our bush road became a
faintly-marked dray-track, and at last petered out in a gully. It
was merely the spoor of a timber-cutter.</p>

<p><i>Later.</i>
</p>

<p>What are we to do? Go back miles, for the second time? Smith
said there was no other possible course, and abused me for leading
him astray. That decided my plans. We rested by the creek for a
while. The gully was deep with fern, and here and there a lovely
white orchid spread its delicate blossoms&mdash;so delicate that a
finger-touch leaves vivid bruises. We sat on the rocks and smoked,
till Smith said: "We'd better hurry, or we'll never get to
Cooloongolook to-night."</p>

<p>I said: "Hurry, then. I'm not going to Cooloongolook."</p>

<p>"Where are you going?"</p>

<p>I pointed with my pipe.</p>

<p>"Up there! Rot! What for?"</p>

<p>"Top of the range, and northward, to the Maclean."</p>

<p>"But there's no track; it's as wild as they make it!"</p>

<p>I filled the billies and started, Smith expostulating till he
was breathless. We climbed laboriously up the steepy spur, through
ferns and rotting foliage, round or over great logs. Our hearts
thudded and our bodies steamed, and the salt sweat stung our eyes.
We gasped in the still heat. The summit appeared to recede before
us. Whenever we rested Smith swore at me faintly. He was so
incongruous&mdash;so grotesquely at variance with the grand silence
of the expectant bush&mdash;that I could not help laughing; yet,
somehow, the humour of the situation seemed as grim to me as the
Dance of Death. The bush mutely protested, and sounded in my ear
some inarticulate threat. The ferns that brushed my hands gave
mysterious warning. But a lyre-bird sang in the myrtle-shade, and
my soul danced in the shower of his notes. Still, there is a mood
in these waiting trees that I have never felt before.</p>

<p>I thought that there would be fairly smooth walking on top of
the range (as there is in the Blue Mountains), but I was badly
mistaken. The tangled jungle on the ridge is worse than the
canopied ferneries of the lower land. Vines&mdash;many of them
armed with strong, hooked claws&mdash;clutch at our arms, trip us,
lasso our swags, and drag us this way and that in their serpent
coils. Often I walked ahead, slashing a way with my sheath-knife,
while Smith stumbled behind, spilling the water, and wailing in
gasps. I try to shut out his voice&mdash;to forget and ignore
him&mdash;but he is as persistent as fate. I thought the bush was
fiercely glad to see him falling, and tearing himself through the
brakes, and panting up the slopes. We pass many
snakes&mdash;copperheads mostly&mdash;and I almost wonder that they
do not feel this irresistible spirit of the solitude urging them to
turn and strike at him with deadly fangs. Once he said he was too
tired out to go a step further. He dropped his swag, and bundled
himself down beside it, and there he lay, with arms thrown wide. I
sat at a little distance from him&mdash;out of range of
conversation. Then he squealed, and I saw him jump up, grabbing at
his legs, slapping himself, squirming, and jerking. He had thrown
his swag upon a nest of hopping ants, and the ground about him was
a flickering swarm of venom. He tore off his clothes, and I got a
stick and scraped away such of the creatures as he couldn't easily
reach. I found it necessary to scrape energetically. He has been in
a sort of high fever ever since&mdash;thirsty and flushed, and
regretting that he hasn't brought his bottle of somebody's patent
painkiller.</p>

<p>We are very travel-worn this evening. My clothes are torn; my
hands and arms are covered with bleeding scratches, and I feel as
though I had been wading to the knees in sand. Smith is a haggard
wreck. We have made a fair course northerly, and have found no
great difficulty in striking the saddles, although they dip low and
are thickly veiled. Of course our rate of progress has not been
great. We see a good many lyre-birds. Once I found the playground
of the bower-birds, and left them a few coloured blanket-threads
for decoration. We have had to go a good way down into the gullies
each time we wanted water, and consequently use it sparingly.
Whereat Smith&mdash;but bust him, anyway! He lost his blessed old
sketching-block to-day!</p>

<p>We've pitched our camp between the roots of an enormous tree, on
one of the saddles. The water is not too far away, in a gully full
of palms, myrtles, orchids, ferns, and creepers. The bush is
beginning to wake in the dusk, and a multitudinous whisper rises
from the sinister shadows. Nature is murmuring against
intrusion.</p>

<p class="cpb">* * *</p>

<p>Smith has found a big leech on his leg, and is gibbering because
he has heard that the Northern Rivers leeches get under a man's
eyelids. We searched, and caught six, looping towards us, or
standing on their tails and wavering. I shouldn't be much surprised
to find Smith sucked nearly dry in the morning; but it's too dark
to shift camp in this network of wilderness. The arms of the bush
are about us. But Smith is her enemy&mdash;an alien, as distasteful
to her as a leprous cabbage-Chinaman would be to a gathering in
high society. The aromatic scent of wild foliage floats from the
dusky jungle, and pleasant sounds are filling the night with
sympathetic thoughts, and the life of the bush flows over and
through me; and yet I am sick at heart.</p>

<p><i>Next day.</i>
</p>

<p>I wish to God I had come on this journey by myself, or with
anybody but Smith! But I'll keep to my word with you, and give you
a letter-diary, telling you everything of note in due order.</p>

<p>This bush is very noisy in the night, when all the wild
creatures are abroad&mdash;mopokes and curlews, and birds whose
notes are strange to me; wombats tearing up earth and rotten logs
in search of roots; wallabies thudding in the scrub; bears grunting
to each other in the trees; bandicoots squealing and tumbling; on
every side a woof of uncouth sound&mdash;squeaking, drumming,
shouting, flapping, and rending; and the leaf-mattressed earth full
of a tiny, creeping rustle; and high up in the tree-tops the brush
of the night-wind's trailing skirts. Once an old bush-giant fell,
somewhere to the south-west, with a groaning rush and crackle,
followed by one grand crash. Spare me the task of recording Smith's
comments.</p>

<p>Early in the morning the birds began their concert, and the bush
was washed from end to end with their fresh, unfaltering notes. A
lyre-bird settled on the ground a few feet from me, and hopped
cautiously towards me, uttering short, enquiring whistles. I lay
still and watched him; but when Smith snorted and heaved in his
blanket, the frightened creature rose, screaming. I got up and
looked about. Within a stone's throw I saw a pair of beautiful
round-breasted wonga pigeons, parading on a log. I went a little
closer and watched them. They showed no fear; probably they had
never before seen anybody in that part of the mountains. I left
them murmuring, breast to breast, and took the billies for water. I
am always the one to get water, light the fire, and cook our food.
I waded slowly down through the thick ferns and decaying foliage.
At each bird-note, blossoms of pure emotion sprang to sudden
fullness, and drenched me with inspiriting fragrance. I sat for a
minute by the creek and let the mood have play. Then a cold breath
whispered up the glen, and I thought of Smith. I hastily filled my
billies to the brim, and scrambled back to our camp.</p>

<p>"How's that for luck, Jack?" said Smith. It was the first time
he had spoken with enthusiasm since the day we left Newcastle.</p>

<p>"What?" I asked, without looking.</p>

<p>"That bird&mdash;blast you!"</p>

<p>I glanced hastily where he pointed. There, with ruffled plumage,
lay the body of a pigeon&mdash;a male wonga. Its head was crushed
and boltered with blood, and its feet were curved in helpless
immobility. A steam of rage rose in my brain, and dimmed my eyes,
and filled my soul with dangerous apathy. As I set down my load, I
asked:</p>

<p>"How did you get him?"</p>

<p>"I chucked a stick at him. He was pretty tame, you know; but it
was a good shot all the same."</p>

<p>"Why did you kill him?"</p>

<p>"Because I wanted fresh meat, of course."</p>

<p>He sat down, and began tearing the feathers from the bird.</p>

<p>"Here, you don't want all that water. I want a bit to clean this
brute."</p>

<p>I poured out some water on the ground, and left just enough for
our cooking. He protested:</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool, Jack! Hang you, don't look at me like that!
I'm not going to be looked at as though I were a murderer, even if
you do eat nothing but nuts and grass!"</p>

<p>He used some of his tea to wash the blood and entrails from the
poor creature's body. But he had not finished roasting the meat
when I shouldered my swag and started.</p>

<p>"Wait a bit!" he shouted. "I haven't half cooked this
pigeon."</p>

<p>I took no notice.</p>

<p>"Aren't you going to wait for a smoke? Oh!"</p>

<p>He thrust the carcase into his pocket, and hurriedly rolled his
blankets. He was afraid of being lost.</p>

<p class="cpb">* * *</p>

<p>We plunged through the thickets until midday, and then halted on
a saddle. I threw the billies to Smith, and told him I thought the
water would be nearer on the western slope.</p>

<p>"Take care," I added, "that you come back the right way."</p>

<p>"You'd better go," he replied, sulkily; "I know nothing about
this mountaineering rot."</p>

<p>But he went.</p>

<p>I can't tell you intelligibly what followed. You have not
endured Smith and his befouling of clear waters. You have not sat
and listened to the almost articulate prompting of the trees. You
don't know what it is to have the bush about you filling you with
primeval passion till you are pure savage. I cannot even attempt
explanation. I don't want to dwell on it, either; so you must pick
your way as best you can.</p>

<p>As soon as he was out of sight, a rush of determination swelled
up and engulfed me like a tide. "Determination" I call it, for lack
of a better word; but I seemed to have surrendered my will to the
vast powers that reign in that solitude. I was their
all-but-passive instrument. With the stealthy watchfulness of a
prowling beast I hid our swags among the ferns in the edge of the
eastern gully, and lay beside them, listening. The day was hot, and
fairly still. He came up and looked about carefully; but I had
concealed all traces of our halting-place. Then he shouted,
carelessly:</p>

<p>"Hey, Jack!"</p>

<p>In the silence a dead branch snapped and fell almost at his
feet. The bush had flung her gage. He sang out louder, and walked
about the saddle, searching. As he passed me I could see the sweat
on his face and could hear his muttering. He cried out as loud as
his lungs would let him, and was answered by the ironical whispers
of the wind. He started north along the range, but missed his way.
I followed him quietly. When he went, shouting wildly, into a
gully, I skirted the dip, and waited among the ferns on the
opposite spur. I heard him labouring through the mazes of that
hostile wilderness. When I caught sight of him I noticed that his
eyes were starting and his jaws twitching. He stopped and cooeed in
a strange voice. Then, as though he had lost time he ran along the
edge of the hill, without noticing that he was going back to his
starting-point. I tracked him with the relentless patience of a
panther. I can't tell you all about it now&mdash;it's too fresh.
When he threw away the billies I picked them up, and hung them on a
tree where I could easily find them.</p>

<p>He shrieked, and tore at random about the range. His clothes
were tattered by the thorny growths; his face and arms were astream
with blood. Three times he blundered across the gullies. And I
moved on his trail and lurked in the coverts of the snakes. At last
he sat down and buried his face in his arms.</p>

<p>I watched him from behind a log. His whole body, retaining its
attitude of rest, was writhing in each separate muscle. He sprang
to his feet, facing me, and stretching his hands towards the sky,
burst into uncontrollable laughter. Good heavens, Broome, do you
know the sound of a madman's laugh? I could have stood his shrieks;
but I knew that if I left him in the ranges now, my life would be a
hollow dome filled with echoing peals of mirthless laughter. That
hideous sound would ring in my ears for ever. With such unnatural
yells did the furies pursue Orestes! In mere self-defence, I rose
to my feet behind the log, and stood glaring. I could feel my face
set stiff against the fore-bones of my skull, and my teeth
impressed upon their protecting flesh. He saw me, and gaped in dead
silence. He shrank and cowered, and by degrees there came into his
eyes a knowledge of what had happened. He knew what I had intended.
So we stared at each other, till I said coldly:</p>

<p>"You'd better come for the swags."</p>

<p>But the stark trees droop their leaves in bitter reproach. I
have broken faith with the bush.</p>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>LOUISA</h2>

<p class="cp"><i>A Memory</i>
</p>

<p>Looking backward across the years, Louisa, I realize that to
thee and to none other did I give my virgin heart. Purged of its
flesh my spirit shall go forth with thee as guiding star.
Sophronia, Rosie, Olive Undine, Alice&mdash;all, all shall be
forgotten: but thou art still the angel of my baptism.</p>

<p>My brother, with his hands plunged deep amid the stamps and
string and pencil-ends of his knicker-bocker pockets, boasted of
his sweetheart an dshamelessly tossed her name to us. Bert Muston
did likewise; and the swaggering amorists exchanged critical
remarks on their respective lady loves. I listened in timid and
wondering silence. How was one to acquire a sweetheart? What was
one to say to her? Did she always confess that she was a
sweetheart? Had my brother&mdash;my brother, good
heaven!&mdash;dared to exchange vows with Hilda Swaine? While I was
yet rapt in the wonder of it, I was suddenly dragged from the
privacy of my meditation, and hustled into combat with my fraternal
braggadocio. He mocked me, and held me up to scorn as one lacking
the joy of a secret devotion&mdash;a devotion which one might
proclaim as a careless challenge to all the world. He summed up all
my deficiencies in a word; I was a kid. I winced, but struck back
blindly. I let them know that I did not babble of such things to
all who had ears, but that I, too, frenziedly abased myself before
the shrine of Venus Vitulina. They demanded the name of the damsel.
I stood upon my dignity, and referred darkly to the decease of the
monkey. My inventive powers were feeble; they required time. But my
brother was insistent. I gracefully yielded them a hint of her
identity, her initials, I told them, were L.C. My brother's brain
was instantly to work. "He means her name is Elsie&mdash;don't you
see?" And while he was mentally running his finger down the list of
our acquaintance I escaped.</p>

<p>When he returned to the charge, after his dismal search for
air-born Elsie, I replied glibly. He did not believe in the
existence of my sweetheart. If she was real, he would have heard of
her, or seen her. I laughed in high disdain. He played boldly,
having nothing to lose: "Where do you see her?" I trumped him; "On
the way to school." I attended a dame's school, and he was a
grammar-school boy. Her name, then&mdash;her name! He swore
secrecy. I knew he lied, but I, with leisure for the task, could
scale the heights of mendacity, and prove myself his equal. "Her
name&mdash;you won't tell&mdash;her name is Louisa." I had thought
of that. What was her other name? I was unprepared, and yet the
word sprang to my lips: "Cady&mdash;Louisa Cady." What power had
inspired me to utter that holy name? Was it thou, O secret
visitant? Was it thou, Louisa?</p>

<p>Slowly the myth formed itself under repeated questionings. From
day to day, I learned from my own tongue, from my own heart, the
truth about Louisa. Her father made hats at the shop where there
was a cabbage-tree hat under a glass case in the window. Her brown
hair was fine and plentiful, and she always wore it brushed out,
and the sun shone right into the middle of it on either shoulder.
Her eyes were very dark. She could play marbles better than my
brother. She wore a pinafore and the dress she had on week-days was
red. She had given me a bottle-oh&mdash;a glass marble out of the
neck of a lemonade bottle. I showed the bottle-oh!</p>

<p>At length my brother came to me, glorying in a new discovery.
Bert Muston had said that they did not make hats at that particular
shop; they only got them from England and sold them. I had no pity.
Louisa, I said, ought to know better than Bert Muston, considering
that her father worked there. Argument could go no further.</p>

<p>Louisa became the constant object of my waking thoughts. Louisa
marched in the endless procession that haunted my pillow. Louisa
even spoke to me in dreams. I longed to see her in the flesh, to
touch her dress as she brushed by me, to bless her with unspoken
worship. Alas, at times I was a doubting Thomas. If a little
brown-haired girl passed me in the street, I strove to invest her
with the divine attributes of my visionary love. It was in vain.
However fair to see, all living maidens fell short of the
perfection of Louisa. Perhaps my wistful gaze was too searching. I
remember that some of the little girls put out their tongues at me.
Louisa would never have&mdash;the very thought was worse than
blasphemy. Louisa, damsel ever young! Louisa in the red frock and
the pinafore! Louisa with the sunbeams in thy hair! Never have
these mortal eyes been blessed with sight of thee, and yet I love
thee still. Thy memory is a fragrant incense in the dimness of my
soul. Louisa&mdash;Oh, Louisa!</p>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>TREES</h2>

<p>In his portraits, partly because of his wig and partly because
of the frozen demeanour of the man who gravely sits for a painter
and remembers his own dignity, George Washington is a remote
creature, more fit for a frontispiece than for a place within "the
red-leaved table of the heart." The story of the cherry-tree shows
him as human, but with an unfortunate trend towards the formal
gravity of the pictures. We would willingly forget though we cannot
forgive his magniloquent declaration that he could not tell a lie,
but we like to remember that to him, as to all other little boys
who have learned to wield a tomahawk, a tree was something to be
cut down. He loved to swing his weapon and feel the edge take the
green wood. He watched the chips fly and the notch gape wider,
heard the leaves tremble together, and rejoiced in the crackle and
crash. The exercise of power delighted him. The small boy has not
learned to create, so he is by nature destructive. And yet, in a
little while, he begins to wake to the beauty about him and to its
mystery, and he is likely enough to become something of a
nature-mystic, feeling a strange comradeship with invisible beings
who dwell in green places. The trees are no longer mere wood, and
the sap that runs in their veins is no longer utterly unlike the
blood that beads on his own scratched fingers. The less he mixes
with other children, the closer is he drawn to his silent friends
in bush and garden; but particularly in the bush, for his wild shy
spirit craves for something that is not orderly and that produces
beauty for its own sake and not to please the inmates of square
rooms.</p>

<p>I was a member of a gang of diminutive ruffians who used to raid
the Botanic Gardens for guavas, nuts and all that a child finds
edible in such a place. We knew every hiding-place, and every hole
through which a rabbit or a boy could dodge. Our triumph was
supreme when we discovered a cinnamon-tree, for green cinnamon was
an exotic delicacy which not even our parents could obtain. We took
long thin strips of the bark, and chewed them surreptitiously in
school, to the envy of those who could not discover where we got
them. We may not have liked the flavour much, but we did enjoy the
glory. Next time we visited the tree we took larger strips and more
of them, and cinnamon bark became an article of trade throughout
the school. We ruminated furtively and there was masticated fibre
everywhere under the desks. But how fleeting is joy! At last our
stocks were depleted. The tree was small, and it was looking
conspicuously naked. Two gardeners were posted to watch it and
capture the vandals. By marching past guiltily we succeeded in
attracting attention. Then we separated into two groups, one of
which betook itself in the direction of the guavas while the other,
with a sly demonstration of silk twists, made for a pond where we
sometimes angled for gold-fish. To our delight, the sentries were
lured from their posts, and, while we sauntered amiably about
distant flower-beds, a desperado, whom we had left in ambush,
stripped from the cinnamon-tree every vestige of bark within reach.
That was a day of perfect happiness.</p>

<p>It cannot be denied that I had taken an intelligent interest in
the tree, but it was a selfish and unsympathetic interest, only a
step higher than that of the baby-boy who loved the old gum-trees
in the Domain because the loose bark at the foot of each grey trunk
harboured beetles and earwigs. It is significant that, though I
remember the appearance of cinnamon bark, I know nothing of the
native beauty of the tree and have no recollection whatever of the
shape of the leaves. Yet a year or two later I was wandering naked
in the bush and thrilling&mdash;as I still do&mdash;at the touch of
living foliage on my body. God seemed afar in his Heaven, but the
gods are always near.</p>

<p>Being lonely, a rebel in the home and an Ishmael among children,
I made a particular friend of a Chinese elm in a thicket of the
garden. To the spirit of that tree I paid reverential tribute. I
burnt the aromatic gum of grass-trees beneath its branches, and its
shelter over me was a blessing. I whispered my fears and hopes with
my lips brushing against its bark. I shed tears above its roots. I
flung my arms about it passionately as I muttered the stories of my
love and hate. I have fallen asleep in its shadow and waked so
calmly that my troubles seemed to have been purged from me during
my slumbers. The turbid waters of many years have gone over me
since then, but the adorations of childhood are not to be
forgotten. It is less than a week since I put an arm around the old
tree and laid my cheek against its trunk for comfort. I ask no
sympathy with my folly. I am still Ishmael, but in the desert where
I take refuge there are trees.</p>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>THE POSSUM</h2>

<p>In the evening, just before the pleasant interval in which one
realizes that the light is growing too dim for comfortable reading,
though it is still too early for lamps, there is a stirring of a
soft body and a little scratching of claws in the long wooden box
which forms the ceiling above the bay window. The possum is awake.
One imagines his wide eyes and upright ears in the darkness, as he
glances about to make sure that his day is really begun and that
the hours of slumber with their strange noises&mdash;clatter, and
heavy footfall, and tumult of children&mdash;are really drawn to
their close. I suppose his dreams are vexed and confused at times
by our incomprehensible interruptions, as ours too may be brought
into strange and monstrous ways by unseen life about us. He listens
and considers and makes his toilet&mdash;scratches his ear,
perhaps, or rubs his whiskers. Then he moves along the rafters very
cautiously towards the only exit from the warm gloom beneath the
iron roof. At that end of the house dwells his consort, a large and
unsociable person, who, for sufficient reasons, prefers to live
apart from him. There is a warning cough, followed by a rush, a
sharp cry of passion, and a fierce struggle above the kitchen.
Furry bodies thump and roll, and claws and teeth are surely at
work, and both combatants are squealing. They tear themselves
apart, and the larger possum retires, coughing resentfully, while
her excited little mate watches in silence, and finally makes for
the doorway. He pushes through the hole under the eaves, and
emerges upon the sloping roof of the porch. The daylight is still a
little too strong, for he is on the western side, so he sits for a
while enjoying the silence and coolness of the air, before he
adventures farther, as a man might pause in the freshness of life
when he had left his cumbersome but comfortable house of moulded
clay. The light thickens. He waddles up the roof, looking rather
ungainly, for his heavy haunches and short forelegs find their true
use only in a world of trunks and branches. Over the ridgecap he
goes, his down-curled tail-tip vanishes, like a farewell blessing
from uplifted crozier, and one hears a dashing of leaves as he
leaps into a sheltering bough of a bloodwood-tree. Then Wilf, who
is eleven years old, a boy who is shy and awkward in the presence
of human creatures, comes out from the back door with a slice of
bread in his hand&mdash;a slice so clumsily cut that the loaf will
convict him when we have our tea. Being sensitive and
tender-hearted, my Wilf is quick to take umbrage, and rough and
uncouth in his primitive methods of self-defence. He is utter boy,
more subtle and less easy to understand than a child of the simpler
and more whimsical sex.</p>

<p>No injustice of haste or impatience glides off and leaves him
unwounded, for the way to his heart is undefended by the drove of
sylphs that watch over Belinda's welfare, and when he is hurt he
strikes back savagely and without judgment. The dogs in the road
greet him without restraint as a friend and equal, and he fondles
even the dirtiest of them with immediate sympathy. It is Wilf,
then, who is most intimate with the possum. He approaches the tree,
and peers up into the branches where the grey fur has become merely
a patch of darkness in the deepening shadows. The possum is still
and watchful. "Hullo Poss!" says Wilf; "I see you, old chap. Come
on, Poss." And he holds out the hunk of bread. The wild animal
understands the free and careless fellowship in the boy's voice,
and he likes the taste of bread. He leaps from one bough to another
on the downward way, and then descends the trunk head foremost till
he is close beside his friend. He stretches out his head,
delicately takes the bread between his teeth, turns with leisurely
care, and runs up the trunk to the first branch, where he sits and,
holding the gift in his forepaws, proceeds to break his fast. And
the other wild creature, the human runagate, looks up at him and
utters kindly words. Meanwhile the large resentful lady has crept
from the shelter of the eaves, and regards the scene with jealous
eyes. Whether her malice or his love be the cause, fur will fly.
One catches rumours of the feud now and then during the night, when
there comes an angry chattering from the gum-trees, or when
scampering feet pad rapidly on the veranda.</p>

<p>Not till the dawn is broken does Poss return to his home. He
drops heavily upon the iron roof from the tree which provides him
with his nearest shelter, playground and food, and one hears him
coming presently along the rafters, plunging heavily, and making a
sound like the irregular trampling of a man who has discovered his
keyhole with difficulty&mdash;a sound so difficult to locate, that
one might easily imagine that some wanderer of the night had missed
his way and was stumbling along the passage. My wife tells me it
took her some time to distinguish certainly between the possum's
step and mine. Why he comes home so heavily I have never learned.
It may be that his encounters with foes and friends leave him so
tired that he simulates involuntarily my work-wearied walk. I have
never heard that gum-leaves are intoxicating, though I have been
rapt into ecstatic dreams by the report that an excellent liqueur
can be distilled from the blossom of the eucalypts. At any rate, we
seldom fail to know when the possum thuds back into his box, and
coils himself for sleep.</p>

<p>I was talking one evening with a friend, the smoke of whose huge
cigar drifted through the moonlit chasms of the bloodwood, when
Poss rose into sight above the ridgecap. "By gosh! What a shot!"
said my friend. I explained that Poss was a lodger. He asked a few
irrelevant questions in his alert manner, while the quiet animal
stared down at him and wondered why he was there. "Lives up in the
roof, does it? Can't you trap it? Possum skins are worth a bit just
now, you know." There really are people who think in that
fashion.</p>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>THE KING OF THE CATS</h2>

<p>It was a night of lucid darkness in August&mdash;a cold, still
night&mdash;a night of expectation, when anything might happen.
Hour after hour, as we lay, we heard, like the keening watchword of
insane sentinels, the melancholy wailing of cats. It was not broken
by winds, nor hurried by the spasms of passion; but rose and fell
with a calm and horrifying precision. It was formal and deliberate,
and reminded one of the decorous woe of paid mourners. It was
disturbing. Even the boys on the veranda stirred uneasily and
whispered excitedly to each other, and it is not easy to rouse the
boys when once they have slipped into the quietude of the
night.</p>

<p>At dawn it seemed as though all the cats but one, ashamed to
expose their ghostliness to the day, had slunk to obscure corners;
but still we heard a short wail, repeated at intervals, and coming
with painful regularity, as a miserable creature ran wearily about
the house. Two wails from the south, one shrill cry as the cat
passed our window, which faced eastward, two as it ran along the
north front, and one, dulled by the bricks between, by the back
door to the west. And so one seemed to measure at once the sides of
the oblong building and the sad animal's rate of tired running.</p>

<p>My wife sighed. "Do find out what is the matter with that cat,"
she murmured. Merlin, our dark, gentle boy, whose eyes are like
wells of darkness, in the depths of which is a glitter of jewelled
laughter, pushed open our door. He is always the earliest to rise,
and he always comes to kiss his mother. "Merlin," I said; "just go
out, will you, and see what on earth ails that cat?"</p>

<p>He went, and, after an absence of five minutes, returned. In his
slow distinct way he reported, "It's not one cat, Dad. It's a lot
of cats."</p>

<p>"I mean the one that's running about the house."</p>

<p>"Yes; but it's not one, and it's not running. It's lots of cats,
and they're just sitting about; but some of them move on when you
go near them."</p>

<p>"How many do you call a lot?"</p>

<p>"Well, there's two at the back door, and a good many round the
front, and I saw five or six over in the garden, where the peaches
grow&mdash;and all round the garden."</p>

<p>"Are there ten, all told?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dad! Of course. And there seems to be a good many in the
bush, too."</p>

<p>My wife was wide awake now. She shuddered at the memory of
fragmentary slumber, as she rose on her elbow, and tried to get a
view of the garden.</p>

<p>"Merlin has done his share now, Jack." She pulled the blanket to
her chin, as she spoke; "Now go, and see what he means." And she
subsided.</p>

<p>I slipped into a suit of pyjamas and went to the back door.
Twenty feet away was a paling fence, and on each of the three
nearest posts sat a tom-cat. Each tom-cat was tabby and very large,
with puffy cheeks and thick whiskers, and each was staring with
wide golden eyes straight at the doorway. I called my wife, and she
came, shivering in her red wrapper.</p>

<p>"What brings them?" she asked. "I never saw such monsters. And
there's another." She pointed at a big tabby in the she-oak. The
problem puzzled her, and she meditated over it with a wrinkled
brow. "It's love," she decided; "they've been serenading."</p>

<p>I thought not. Those particular cats did not look as though
romance would interest them.</p>

<p>I shouted suddenly. Not a cat moved. Then I walked to the front,
and cats scurried from under the geranium bushes, and stole along
the shrubs near the fence. Grey and yellow fur moved in the shadows
under the cypresses, and crouching cats were stealing, with lowered
tails, between the cabbages. They seemed to spring from the earth,
so swiftly and so silently did they slink from their hiding-places,
and make for better cover. I glanced over the cliff into the bush,
and saw a scatter of cats among grey rocks and a tangle of
undergrowth. They passed out of sight like shadows, and, as I
turned away, I felt that innumerable unseen golden eyes watched my
going.</p>

<p>My wife had thought the matter over. She said that there must be
a dead cat about.</p>

<p>"Well," I admitted, "you're generally right when there's no
evidence to mislead you. But do you mean to tell me you think those
furry ghosts have been holding a wake?"</p>

<p>She did.</p>

<p>It was Saturday, and I returned home at noon. Wilf met me.
"Dad," he said, in his offhand manner, "there's such a big dead cat
in the bush."</p>

<p>When I saw the corpse, I wondered why we had not found it
before. It was a huge bulk&mdash;the largest cat I had ever
seen&mdash;and it had been lying on the rock so long that its dull
tabby fur was loose. Cremation seemed the preferable course. I
dropped leaves gently above the gigantic Tom, dodging when the
light wind from the harbour swayed in my direction. Then I heaped
sticks, and threw matches at the heap, till it burst into flames. I
fetched more wood, larger pieces, and built a goodly pyre. The
flames leaped, rich orange, and the heart of the fire glowed like
silver, and, as the rotting sinews felt the fervency, they answered
to it horribly. Slowly the stiff neck moved, and the brown
glistening head rose from the mouldering legs. Ashes and flaming
twigs parted as the mummy budged. The shoulders heaved lifelessly,
and the stiff, straight forelegs, from which the paws were already
burned, pressed down upon the rock. Amid licking flame the hideous
beast rose slowly, and sat like a demon, grinning at me with sharp
teeth, which once were hidden by whiskered lips. From hollow
eye-sockets, lead-grey bubbles slowly bulged and burst
reluctantly.</p>

<p>The cliff, twelve feet in height, was only a few paces from
where I stood. A subdued wail sounded from aloft. I looked up, and
amid the fringe of grass on the edge of the rock I saw a row of
cats gazing fixedly down upon the exequies of their king. They drew
back, and vanished as I turned my head; but I knew they were still
crouching, and waiting. The bones of the dead monarch's legs had
yielded to the heat, and he sank forward. I brought logs, and
heaped them, and threw grass-tree into the flames to make a
fragrance which I love.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>KICKING</h2>

<p>I have never been able to reconcile myself to the amusement of
kicking people. In fact, all kicking is distasteful to me. Long
before I directed my attention deliberately to the subject, I felt
instinctively that kicking a ball was futile, kicking an animal
indecent, and kicking a man, woman or child a rather joyless
entertainment on both sides. The few occasions on which I have
overcome my repugnance have not widened my outlook or enlarged my
sympathies, but&mdash;through no fault of mine, I am
sure&mdash;have merely confirmed me in my prejudice. Don't think I
am trying to justify myself if I relate a couple of my experiences.
I know an explanation is no excuse.</p>

<p>When I was about eighteen, I went to stay with a friend, whose
elderly parents maintained social dignity on a small income. The
father particularly was obliged to add something of pomp to his
manner in order to atone for deafness and a scarcity of cash. The
morning after my arrival I woke rather early, and went barefooted
to my friend's room only to find that he had already risen. At
first I supposed that he had gone to the kitchen to pre pare the
breakfast, and I was on my way to that quarter of the house, when I
heard him splashing in the bathroom.</p>

<p>The door was ajar, so I pushed it open and entered. He was
having rather a dip than a bath, for he was fully clothed, and was
leaning well over the end of the bath and laving his face with
double handfuls of water. His back was towards me, so of course I
kicked. He plunged feebly forward into six inches of water, rolled
over and scrambled to his feet; and then I saw that I had lifted an
impious foot against my friend's father.</p>

<p>Even now, I have a glow of pride at recalling my immediate
realization that it was no time for apologies. I said, "Good
morning!" with great heartiness, and retired to the kitchen before
he had time to think of what he intended to remark. Now, in a way,
that was quite a joyous experience, and yet it was a long while
before I attempted anything like a repetition of it.</p>

<p>The last time I broke away from the inhuman inactivity which
fetters me was comparatively a few years ago. I owe my involuntary
dash for freedom to my wife. She had bought a pair of boots which
were too small for her, and, as her ideas of economy are quite
unpractical in such circumstances, she wouldn't throw the pointed
things away, and buy a better pair, but insisted that she must wear
them out. Consequently, when I asked her to come with me to Manly
and loaf on the sand, she replied that her shoes were giving her
corns, and she didn't think the trip would be pleasurable. I
offered her a pair of my boots&mdash;I have two pairs&mdash;but she
declined. Finally, however, she consented to come with me. The pain
in her feet grew more and more distressing, and in my imagination
her sore feet attained gigantic proportions. They pressed upon my
brain till it could scarcely throb. I was obsessed by corns. My
mental vision was obscured by blistered toes.</p>

<p>From Manly we returned by tram. At the Spit we waited long for a
punt to carry us across Middle Harbour, and, when it came, a great
number of people surged aboard. An empty tram departed for Mosman
before the overcrowded craft reached the southern shore. Then
several hundreds of us waited for the next tram. I let my wife know
that if she kept close behind me, I would make a rush and secure
her a seat on the front&mdash;a pleasant position; one never misses
the accidents.</p>

<p>I mentally measured the distance, and took my station a tram's
length from the terminus. Others were equally eager for front
seats. I looked about, and noticed, at a little distance, three
young men who were clearly from abroad, for they spoke with a
distinctly foreign brogue. I think it was Scotch. They were talking
about me, and enjoying my appearance, for, as I didn't wear a hat,
my hair was somewhat disarranged by the wind&mdash;and there were
other reasons; but there is no need to mention them now. The eldest
of these men was red-haired, and large, and looked as though his
disposition were as warm as his colour. As the tram drew up, I
stepped forward, but the red-haired man shouldered me violently
aside just as I was climbing upon the footboard. I stepped back to
save myself, and felt my heel crush down upon the toes of my
wife.</p>

<p>A cold rage filled my heart, and I acted without undue
hesitation. The red-headed man was mounting to the seat that he and
I had chosen. I waited a fraction of a second until he was
accurately posed, and at the convenient elevation, and then I
kicked. He rose lightly and swiftly into the tram, but immediately
returned and expressed his extreme dissatisfaction at my conduct. I
explained to him quite clearly that I was avenging an injury to my
wife. There was lively altercation, in which the passengers took a
sporting interest, and suddenly the tram started. He plunged for
one compartment, and I for another, in which I found my wife. She
was annoyed. Chivalry is the very mischief for getting a man into
that sort of trouble. In her opinion I had made a fool of myself
and her.</p>

<p>"It was for you," I pleaded; "after being forced to tread on
your foot&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But it wasn't my foot."</p>

<p>Suddenly I became aware of a furious lady in a neighbouring
compartment. She was talking aloud for the benefit of the public at
large, and I was the subject of a discourse which lasted the whole
of the journey. Her view was that I was a lunatic who tempted
Providence by neglecting to wear a hat, and she made no secret of
her loathing for rabid, grey, shaggy, half-dressed larrikins who
rushed into a crowd for the purpose of stamping upon the feet of
highly respectable ladies and kicking gentlemen violently into
trams.</p>

<p>It all lies in the point of view. My prejudice against kicking
is as obstinate as ever.</p>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>UNCONSCIOUS CEREBRATION</h2>

<p>Brimstone would never have entered the field of literature if he
had been allowed to choose his own course. He was driven in by his
wife. And now that he has gained the reputation of a reckless
plagiarist, he believes he can detect beneath her expressions of
trust and sympathy a lurking suspicion and a secret contempt which,
by comparison, almost make the flippant and openly hostile
criticism of his friends and business acquaintances a sufferable
torment. He spends less of his time at home now, and frequents
quiet lounge bars where he can smoke and curse his luck without
aggravation or interruption.</p>

<p>She began to goad him to disaster very shortly after they were
married. "They say every man can write at least one book," she
would say reproachfully, "and I think it's time you proved you are
a man." He spent hours in trying to shew her the fallacy involved
in her remark. She pointed out the financial advantages of literary
fame, and quoted (from Snipped Bits) the prices of stories by
Kipling and Marie Corelli. She told him that his lack of
self-confidence was not a thing to be proud of; and that he knew
very well that he had "lots of imagination and all that sort of
thing;" and that he was wasting valuable time; and that if he
really loved her he would do what she asked him to. And at last he
fell. He started to write a novel. Every night he sat up late in
his dressing-gown, until she was afraid that he would injure his
health. In the morning he would read her what he had written, and
she would pause in the middle of dressing or doing up her hair, and
ask him to read some especially inflated passage over again. She
declared that the story was lovely, and reiterated her praise until
he began to believe in his own genius. When he read the more
pathetic parts, his voice trembled and tears came into his eyes,
and she watched him in sympathetic silence, with parted lips. He
thanked Heaven for a wife with ideas, a helpful mate, a woman who
understood him. Without her loving insight, he might never have
discovered his vocation. She asked him how he ever thought of his
plot&mdash;it was just too delightful. He answered simply and with
an air of easy modesty that it "came." He did not mention that he
had drawn very largely on personal experiences, and events which
had occurred before he had met her. As a matter of fact, his hero
was an idealized reflection of himself, while his leading lady was
sketched from vivid memories of Miss Adelina Wolde. Miss Wolde had
gone to England with her parents. She and Mrs Brimstone had never
met. Consequently she was good "copy."</p>

<p>By the time that he reached Chapter XXII, the author's borrowed
enthusiasm had grown weary, but Mrs Brimstone baited it with
eulogy, and whipped it up with reproach, and Brimstone continued to
sit late in his dressing-gown. She diffidently proposed new
incidents, which he, embedded in the narrative without regard to
their relevance, and he accepted her modifications of the plot
without demur. After each reading, he discussed the next move with
her, and came at last to expect and depend on her suggestions. She
revised the last few chapters, and made substantial
alterations.</p>

<p>The difficulty now was to find a publisher. The first time the
manuscript came back, she was shocked and surprised. But by the
time it had been rejected six times she was confident and almost
jubilant. Even Charlotte Bronte and Marie Corelli and Thomas
Carlyle had met with rebuffs; great and original work seldom finds
ready acceptance. But Brimstone went through stages of despondency,
self-distrust, and impatience, and welcomed home the much-travelled
bundle with scowls and sniffs. However, the eleventh voyage
resulted in an offer of ten pounds down or a small percentage of
the profits of sale.</p>

<p>"Well, dear?" he said.</p>

<p>She threw the letter down impatiently. "It's absurd."</p>

<p>"Still, ten pounds is ten pounds."</p>

<p>"Reggie!" she cried in deep reproach.</p>

<p>"Eh!" he muttered, with the air of a dog caught stealing.</p>

<p>"You'd take the ten pounds&mdash;not the percentage?"</p>

<p>"Well, you know, it's a certainty."</p>

<p>"Is that all your self-confidence? Well, if I were a man, and
had&mdash;! You know that even a trifling share like this will
mount up; perhaps not directly, but in years to come, when the
public realize&mdash;Of course you must take the percentage. But
it's shameful, all the same."</p>

<p>Her eloquent omissions bore him down. He wrote and agreed to
take the percentage.</p>

<p>His interest in his work revived when he saw the printer's
proofs. He was proud and happy when he wrote the corrections and
scribbled hieroglyphics of deletion on the margin. He even flushed
with pleasure when his wife said to lady visitors: "My husband is
very busy just now. He is revising the proofs of his new book." It
made him feel as though he already had an established reputation as
an author. He could not share her private indignation when they
asked how long it would be before it was procurable at the lending
libraries. She thought there should be an Authors' Society formed
for the express purpose of boycotting all establishments which
circulated literature on payment of a subscription. For a whole
week she refrained from taking advantage of her Book Club
membership.</p>

<p>The great book was printed and bound, and press copies were
issued. Mrs Brimstone's anxiety at this period reacted upon her
husband's nerves and he bought stacks of papers and examined them
furtively in his office. He walked about the streets in a tremor of
excitement, and expected his friends to rush up to him with
congratulations.</p>

<p>On Saturday morning Mrs Brimstone hastily glanced at the pages
of the <i>Herald.</i> Suddenly the heading "New Fiction" caught her
eye, and she looked carefully down the column. Then she flushed,
started, and muttered to herself.</p>

<p>"Anything there?" enquired Brimstone, trying to appear calm and
nearly choking himself with toast and emotion. She had forgotten to
pour out his tea.</p>

<p>"It must have been put in by somebody who dislikes you. It's
shameful that such a thing should be allowed."</p>

<p>The novelist gulped hopelessly at his toast.</p>

<p>"Just listen to what they say, Reggie." And she read:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Messrs Grabbett and Keep send us a novel entitled <i>In All
His Glory,</i> by Reginald Brimstone, which we have not the least
hesitation in advising our readers to avoid, not only because it is
incoherent, full of artistic blemishes and grammatical blunders,
and as flat, stale and unprofitable as beer left overnight, but
because it reveals in the author a literary dishonesty which is as
daring as it is discreditable. At least one half (the earlier) of
the plot of <i>In All His Glory</i> has been unskilfully conveyed
from a work which received its meed of praise in these columns
nearly six months ago&mdash;we refer to <i>Winsome Wilhelmina,</i>
by George Burdett. One scene in special (a love scene between
Adolphus Lissome and Felicia Holt) is nothing more than a
ridiculous travesty of a similar scene in Mr Burdett's powerful and
stimulating psychological romance. We print the passage in full
that our readers may form an independent judgment.' And then they
go on with Chapter XXI&mdash;Adolphus was shown into the
drawing-room.'"</p>

<p>"Yes," Brimstone said feebly, "you needn't read that."</p>

<p>But she went on defiantly. Really she was trying to fortify
herself behind this fragment of a masterpiece.</p>

<p class="pin10">Loudly beat the daring heart ensconced in his
manly breast, and long seemed the time that he waited. He was very
ill at ease, and was not able to remain seated in comfort on the
luxurious cushions of the sofa, so he rose and paced to and fro,
stately and dignified as a lion even at this crisis, till he saw
the pale reflection of his own face in the great pier-glass that
stood above the marble mantel. Could it be possible that that white
countenance was his, those mournful hollow eyes, that drooping
moustache, those gently-parted trembling lips? Was this the jovial
hero of the hunting-field? His hyacinthine locks were disordered by
the rude wind of the street, and he raised his delicately-modelled
hand to deftly smootth them into place. His whole figure drooped
with melancholy. Who, he thought, could view me without a pang of
pity, which they say is akin to love? Whilst thus he stood
preparing with what loving care for the approaching interview, the
fair Felicia glided into the room. He was overcome with joy and
confusion, and when he turned he felt that he was flushing with the
rapid irruption of a thousand mingled feelings. He had no time to
properly prepare for her sudden entrance, but stood trembling on
the hearth-rug even as a tall mountain pine lonely on a crag and
shaken by the coming of the lusty wind. She came to him with an
outstretched hand which took his nerveless fingers for a moment and
thrilled him to the core of his soul, and then she asked him to sit
down. He sank upon the foot of the sofa, negligently leaving the
cushion end free, but she gracefully sat on a chair and said the
weather was warm. His heart was bursting with his passionate
affection, but he agreed with her in a pleasant tone of voice.
Something warned him in his secret, heart not to speak on this
occasion, and he felt the said heart sinking; but it was still the
undaunted heart of a hero. He coughed to clear his throat, but what
in any other man might have been mistaken for dread held him
entranced in silence. But she had noticed his cough, and rose to
close the window with charming sympathy. He sprang to assist her,
and his hand touched hers. Volcanic rushed the fire through his
being, and choked his utterance. "I," he began, and stammered he
knew not what. "I am afraid I do not understand you," replied she.
"I am not feeling the draught," he cried. "I see," was her
self-possessed reply. Again he addressed himself to the most
exquisite of her sex. "I"&mdash;here he paused for breath&mdash;"I
have not come to talk about the weather." "No, Mr Lissome?" said
she, "and may I ask what your purpose was?" Then his heart stopped
beating, and the room swam round him, as he whispered: "Miss
Holt&mdash;Felicia&mdash;I can't help it, really; I love you." O,
what a silence, in which he heard flies buzzing, and thought the
veins of his temples would burst. But when she spoke, he yearned
for the silence again, because she said: "If you'll believe me, Mr
Lissome, I'm even more sorry for this than you can be." Then his
mind was in a whirlwind of incongruous elements and despairing he
thought of his mother and the manual reproaches she had given him
when a boy&mdash;so near, alas! are comedy and tragedy! "Is there
another?" he said or gasped. "No, certainly not," said she, "but I
can never love you." He clasped his hat in his hands, forgetting
that the hard felt would retain the impression, and with wild eyes
he exclaimed: "May I not hope?&mdash;I will give you time to
answer." "No," said she with a look of the profoundest sorrow, "but
I will always be your friend." But he turned away and staggered
with a crushed heart towards the door.</p>

<p>Mrs Brimstone concluded with an air of triumph that hardly
matched the sad condition of the rejected lover. "At least," she
said energetically, "this extract will serve to undeceive all
intelligent readers. It's a pity there are so few of them. And do
you notice, dear, the fellow hasn't dared to say anything about the
fine way the situation is handled, or the way the characters are
treated?"</p>

<p>Brimstone admitted that he had observed it.</p>

<p>"And what about this other book, this" (she referred to the
paper) <i>"Winsome Wilhelmina</i>? I've never heard of the
name."</p>

<p>"My dear Cara," he said with a show of decision, "neither have
I. It's too ridiculous altogether. I don't remember ever noticing
anything by this George Burdett, and I'll swear I've never read his
<i>Winsome Whats-his-name</i>."</p>

<p>She fed his indignation, and he went to the city with his head
high in confidence. But grins, nudges and hand-veiled whispers
hemmed him in, and he felt the lack of her presence. His step
gradually lost its elasticity and his eye its fire. He longed to
procure a copy of the book which so resembled his own, but was
afraid of being seen, and hurried past the booksellers' shops with
apprehensive glances before and behind. Some of his friends rallied
him on the "dressing-down" he had got in the <i>Herald.</i> Most of
them professed to believe him when he denied all knowledge of
George Burdett, but they smiled knowingly. Brimstone squirmed.</p>

<p>He arrived home in the evening with a splitting headache. His
misery was abject, and his self-contempt was equal by reaction to
his elation during the season of authorship. His wife received him
with gravity. He flopped heavily into his armchair, lay back, and
intertwined his fingers across the lower buttons of his
waistcoat.</p>

<p>She watched him, knitting her brows. At length she said:
"Reggie, I got a copy of <i>Winsome Wilhelmina</i> to-day, and I've
been reading it."</p>

<p>He rolled his eyes wearily, without turning his head. "Well?" he
queried.</p>

<p>"There is a resemblance in the plot&mdash;certainly a
resemblance, of a kind&mdash;mind, Reggie, I say of a kind."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"But, after all, it's not very strong&mdash;"</p>

<p>He brightened.</p>

<p>"&mdash;except in the scene quoted by the <i>Herald</i>."</p>

<p>"Blow the <i>Herald</i>!"</p>

<p>She respected his state of mind, and had no words of censure for
the vulgarity. Mentally she echoed his sentiment. An open book was
lying face downward on the little side-table. She brought the
volume and placed it in his hands. He sighed, and read:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pin10">Rapt in such reveries, maidenlike, boxed in with
considerations proper to a sex ebullient to emotional fervency, she
received with fatal scarcity of patience the fear-coloured oblong
which bore the name of Lord Markham FitzMarkham. A touch, dainty
and swift, such as all women, and only they, effect or perceive in
result, gave symmetry to the outline of her head by recall of
errant fluffiness; and the stairs pattered to the run of her feet,
anxious, one would suppose, for the interview and its terminal
point. The air of the room was charged with who shall say what
element of warning. Certain it is, the sex that is more delicately
dowered, richer in depth and fuller of glow and glory of
imagination than ours, has senses transcending sense, reaching the
truth of blue skies beyond masculine pinions. She knew his
intention as she opened the door; felt it with subtle
inter-blending of two waves of laughter and dread tremulous with
foam, herself the boat borne on the crest. His folly was the shore
whereon pranced fantastic negroes, acts of idiocy, grimaces, and
nervous stammerings, to greet her arrival. He was posing limp
before the mirror, rehearsing his clown's part not inaptly, clawing
his hair with twitching fingers. Surprised in preliminaries,
anticipated, as it were, in his most grievous brilliancy of
sensationalism, he turned, helpless, open-mouthed, hued in maculate
crimson of lilied suggestiveness. She indicated a sitting posture.
The sofa, on the extreme edge of its least upholstered projection,
supported his perspiring frame. She nestled cosily into a chair, a
practical exposure of male awkwardness. Approaching from afar,
willing to offer herself a target to his blunt shafts of an overfed
Cupid, hoping to present herself within range after slow progress
wide-reaching under cover, the warmth of the summer was flung into
the pool of oonversation. The circles widened, contorting all
reflected things, so that he stood an ape jabbering, oonfessed and
undefended. Echoes of laughter in Cimmerian wastes of clouded mirth
were jogged to angular activity by his cough, an oratorical resort
for those to whom Rosalind's cleanlier shift is denied. She knew
that the champagne-sparkles of Nature's vintage, old in the human
cellar since the primeval Eden press, leaped from sources unbidden
to cream at her eyelids. Say what you will, the very mention of
wine, not flat vintages untasted but by mere men of mud, but of
inextinguishable stilly flavour and tinct of miraculous prenatal
suffusion of sun and air of the sea, projects even the greatest of
word-fingerers, makers of ink-well pyrotechnic scintillation, into
ecstatic Paradises of metaphor, converting sobriety to the figure
of a howling dervish.</p>

<p>"I don't know that I quite understand all this," said Brimstone,
clasping his forehead with his left hand, his little finger resting
across his eyes.</p>

<p>"Let me see," said his wife. "Oh, about the wine? No." She
turned a couple of pages. "Here, dear; go on there."</p>

<p class="pin10">Laughter must be cabined in hypocrisy. She swam to
the window, uncounting on proffered assistance; clumsiness sprang
the mine, when his hand (paw of the ursine blunderer, call it
rather) thumped hers on the ledge, and immediate, as water from
bottle upturned with under-cavity to exact skyward, an intermittent
stream of incoherencies, void of uttered signification, gurgled
with choking blobs. She implied lack of comprehension, and
acknowledged his disowning of objection to free circulation of the
atmospheric flow. He prepared for the plunge, grotesque; painful to
himself, a quaint delight to a spectator; an inexperienced diver
baulked by qualmish spasms. He flung aside his garment of the
weather, her generous gift, and advanced to the edge. She pushed
him, mercifully desirous to drown him expeditiously, with enquiry
of his purpose. He sprang with wind-mill whirlings. "Miss
Wintergold&mdash;Wilhelmina&mdash;I can't help it; I really
can't&mdash;I love you." His hat was in his hand, and he revolved
it foolishly by the edges. She expressed regret for the situation,
for his infatuation of presumptuous aspiring; inwardly writhing to
the tickle of unappeasable mirth.<br>
<br>
"Is there then another?"<br>
<br>
She waved the suggestion away, a feather in the void. He clutched
the camel's straw: "May I hope?"<br>
<br>
Friendship she intimated, with unenthusiastic precision, and he
fled. She watched him from between the blinds, tickling triumphant.
He straightened his cuffs at the street corner, preparing for fresh
onsets, oblivious of a hat indented, suggestive of moony
revels.</p>

<p>Whitefaced and sullenly indignant, Brimstone hung his hand over
the arm of the chair, and let the book fall to the floor. His mouth
twitched, and two deep wrinkles stood upright between his
eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Well, dear?" Mrs Brimstone invited explanation.</p>

<p>"It's like&mdash;it's like&mdash;it's like," he snapped rapidly,
to her surprise and horror.</p>

<p>"Reggie!"</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, my dear. I can't explain it. I don't know. But
whoever the person is who wrote that book, she might write it so's
to be understood."</p>

<p>"But it's a man," she said, her triumph overlaid with
compassion.</p>

<p>"Well, he! a man, of course&mdash;so it is, I forgot." He was
subdued.</p>

<p>"Are you sure you never read the book, dear?" she prompted him
soothingly, like a mother inducing her child to contradict what he
knows is fact.</p>

<p>"Certainly! I swear I never saw the stuff in my life. It's a
case of what the doctors call unconscious cerebration, I
suppose&mdash;two brains at the same work simultaneously, taking
their notions from the air where they're afloat, without either
knowing about the other."</p>

<p>"But really, Reggie!"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's pretty common, they say. Darwin and another fellow
both invented evolution at the same moment," he said recklessly.
"It often happens."</p>

<p>"Isn't it more likely, dear, that you read the <i>Herald's</i>
review? I dare say it gave a sketch of the plot, and quoted this
scene in full. You may have glanced over it in the train. It would
be so easy to forget."</p>

<p>"No," he said, ruffled beyond precedent, "nobody could be more
absolutely certain of anything&mdash;." He broke off suddenly,
realizing that he was blocking one of his holes of escape.
"Um!&mdash;perhaps it is possible," he muttered sulkily. "It may be
so, dear."</p>

<p>"Anyway, dear," she said, with the calm dignity of one who held
aloof from slippery ways, "I think perhaps you made a mistake in
writing. It&mdash;well, it doesn't seem to be your vocation.
Really, I think, it would be better&mdash;I don't want to make you
feel discouraged, and I don't want to blame you&mdash;please don't
think that&mdash;but wouldn't it be better to stick to your office
work and leave authorship to those who have made a study of
it?"</p>

<p>No married man is amazed at a woman's changes of front.
Brimstone was angry but frightened. He felt hysterical, so he got
his hat in silence, and walked out into the cool evening air.</p>

<p>"So Adelina is writing under an assumed name, is she?" he
murmured savagely to himself. He shook his head and snapped his
teeth viciously. "But if I'd known <i>that</i> was what she thought
of it all, I'm hanged if I'd have been so cut up about it."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>ROBSON</h2>

<p>Cyril Harwood, for the past three years, had spent all his
available holidays at Burgess's. It was a pleasant place. The
whitewashed farmhouse stood just above the highest floodmark on
grassy slopes that were backed by rugged sandstone ridges. Before
it stretched a broad alluvial flat along the edge of which the line
of thick foliage, from which a few great spotted gums lifted their
bunches of flat hanging leaves, marked the far-flung loop of a
rives full of still reflections. It had the double charm of unmixed
wilderness and pastoral decorum, for the bush began just behind the
house, and its waiting spirit brooded over miles of gorge and
commanding pinnacles of rock, but on the smooth slopes beyond the
quiet stream one could distinguish white farmhouses, about which
drawling but quickwitted men did their day's work with leisurely
strength. Yet it was no mere holiday inclination that led Cyril
regularly to the hills, where the wallabies thudded, and the
paddocks, where fat dairy-cows chewed everlastingly with an
expression like that of their contented masters. He had long
thought of "going on the land," and from Burgess and his neighbours
he gained many hints that he hoped might be of value. Unmarried and
unassuming, he had spent the years of his earlier manhood quite
agreeably but inexpensively, and, at the age of thirty, he had in
the bank a small stock of capital which the death of his father, a
moderately successful medical practitioner, had suddenly increased
to quite respectable dimensions. His mother had died ten years ago,
and he was the only surviving member of the family, with the
exception of an elder brother, who does not come into the story. He
was in no hurry, but he dreamed of farming. His work in the
statistician's office was a bore, and discontent moved in him like
water that is thinking of coining to the boil. This Easter he was
particularly troubled, almost bad-tempered.</p>

<p>Burgess, a long-necked, hook-nosed man, who resembled a
partially-plucked parrot, met the car and shook the hand of the
alighting visitor.</p>

<p>"Fine weather for this time o' year, Mr Harwood," he said. "And
how are ye? The missus is sick; I suppose Middlehurst, here, told
ye?" He indicated the chauffeur.</p>

<p>"How are you? Yes," replied Harwood, "and I thought of turning
back. Hope she's no worse? Better?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit. Why, if all visitors that came were like you, and
took as much interest in stock an' crops, I'd be well enough off,
after a bit, to pay 'em for coming." He chuckled, and looked more
like a cockatoo than ever. "Come in for a while, Middle-hurst. No?
Right. So long!"</p>

<p>As the car snorted and backed and turned, he led Harwood to the
shelter of the flagged veranda at the back of the house.</p>

<p>"They dunno' what's the matter with her. I don't think Whipple
is much of a doctor, anyways. So I've got my niece to come over
from Wattle Hollow to look after the place. Cooking, you know, and
cleaning up and the likes o' that. Here, Jinny," he exclaimed, as
he caught sight of a bright eye and half a curly head at the
kitchen door, "tell your mother to come here a moment."</p>

<p>Jinny disappeared and then came partially into sight once more,
clinging to the skirt of a young woman, whose sleeves were rolled
above her elbows.</p>

<p>"This is my niece, Mr Harwood&mdash;Mrs Robson. You've heard
about Mr Harwood, Daisy."</p>

<p>"Often," she said. "When things seem to be going a little wrong,
Uncle often says he wishes you were here to lend a hand."</p>

<p>Her voice was as gentle as the look of her large dark eyes. The
compliment was almost a caress, and, for once in his life, Harwood
nearly felt shy. He took her hand for a moment, with an
unreasonable expectation of feeling it soft and yielding, and was
disconcerted to find it firm and strong. It was moist and warm, and
a breath of soapsuds from beyond the kitchen betrayed unmistakably
her recent activities.</p>

<p>"I'll wring," he exclaimed.</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>"No," she said, "that won't do at all. Go and see Auntie. She's
lonely and likes to talk, and she's expecting you. I've put her
stretcher on the other veranda."</p>

<p>"Of course, of course. Silly of me. I'll help you later, though,
if Mr Burgess doesn't round me up to bring the cows in."</p>

<p>"They're in," said Burgess with a grin; "or Toni and Sally would
a' bin up here to meet you. They're milkin', an' I'm goin' back to
the shed meself now. Go round an' see the missus." He strode
off.</p>

<p>On the front veranda, which looked on a little garden full of
old-fashioned plants, Harwood found at one end two young women,
evidently boarders, who sat and smoked cigarettes, the one with
awkward vigour and the other with languid grace. "I told her she
was being a fool, and she said he could spend his money as he
pleased," he heard the lean and rather bleak-looking lady say. The
other blew a long stream of smoke and answered: "Why not? She
hasn't much." "Shocking, I call it," snapped the first, glaring
suddenly at Harwood. At the other end, behind the rickety
flower-stand with its array of spindling geraniums and lanky
begonias, he was welcomed feebly by Mrs Burgess, propped up on
pillows and looking flushed. She seemed to gather strength
spasmodically as she talked. She had no wish to listen, but was
eager to describe all the symptoms of her sickness. Harwood put on
an appearance of cheerfulness and sympathetic interest, but he
suspected that the illness was more serious than she herself
thought, in spite of her querulous pride in all her pains. He told
Burgess so, later, and recommended a hospital. Burgess, whose life
was one of routine, frowned and spat thoughtfully at a March
fly.</p>

<p>At the tea-table, Harwood made the acquaintance of the two
boarders, Miss Lancaster, who pressed her lips together and bowed
like a clockwork figure in want of oil, and Miss Vindin, who
murmured like a sleepily seductive cat. Neither interested him, and
he decided that, if Mrs Robson didn't object, he'd have the rest of
his meals with her and Burgess in the kitchen. Tom and Sally had
already protested against his exile, he learned later from Burgess,
but Mrs Robson thought he might like a chance to meet the ladies.
Very good of her. He wondered if she meant it.</p>

<p>After tea he strolled into the kitchen and insisted on washing
up. Mrs Robson, who knew he had done it before, let him have his
own way, and dried the crockery as he placed it on the tray. She
talked freely on every topic except herself. When he tried
unostentatiously to get her to reveal anything of her own life, she
quietly parried. He saw the glint of laughter in her eyes. With a
man's approval of methods foreign to his own nature, he noticed the
neatness of the kitchen and the general air of cleanliness about
the place. It looked different, somehow. As he looked at the
orderly rows of utensils, he wondered if they'd be easier to find
than when they lay untidily within reach. The cats, he observed,
still slept in the corner, but their straw was in a box, not strewn
on the boards. Her arms were well-shaped, and her movements had a
quiet firmness, a deftness that was graceful and soothing. Or was
it soothing? He looked at her eyes and she met his look with a
smile. He felt like a diver who plunges into deep cool water, finds
no bottom, and returns breathless. He began to feel adventurous.
The click of her golden ring on a plate recalled him.</p>

<p>Soon the things were cleared away, and they sat about the table,
talking. Jinny, whose shyness had almost worn off, was on Harwood's
knee, and he tore some leaves from his note-book and made grotesque
drawings to please her&mdash;pigs in bonnets, cows of the age of
fable, and a cockatoo that bore a dangerous resemblance to Mr
Burgess. After the child had gone to sleep, with her pictures in
her hand, and had been duly carried off to bed, there was a game of
cards in which Sally, a freckled cheerful girl, took a hand, while
her young brother looked on and annoyed her by making suggestions
that revealed the weakness of her play. Mrs Robson played well, and
Harwood was glad she was his partner, because it gave him an excuse
for sitting opposite her and studying her face. She had a way of
pursing her lips slightly in moments of consideration. He found it
charming, alluring. It made him restless. Damn Robson, anyway. But
who was Robson?</p>

<p>She thanked him for his help, as she shook hands with him before
retiring. "As though the sun should thank us for letting light come
in," he thought. Afterwards he sat on the doorstep with Burgess,
and they smoked and discussed farm interests.</p>

<p>"Dunno what I'd a' done, if Daisy hadn't come," said Burgess.
"She's a handy gell. Sally couldn't a' managed on her own. A good
gell, Daisy!"</p>

<p>"I suppose she is," replied Harwood. "Lucky her husband could
spare her."</p>

<p>"She's a widder," said Burgess shortly, and sucked at his
pipe.</p>

<p>Harwood said "Oh!" He wondered if he hadn't said it
unnecessarily loudly. But it passed. So he needn't have damned
Robson. Perhaps he was damned already. No; she was too fond of
laughter for her life to have been sordid or constantly unhappy.
Poor old Robson! And yet in the dark depths of her eyes, wasn't
there something that spoke of old pain? In the soft obscurity of
the night he seemed to see those eyes like windows to the
unfathomable sky. Oh, hang Robson! He was out of it now, anyway.
But was he? If it came to fighting, it was harder to grip a phantom
than a living man.</p>

<p>The piano was being played in the sitting-room, and he heard
Miss Vindin's cooing voice in a song of sentimental regrets. She
was perhaps informing him, in her own way, of what he had missed by
washing up.</p>

<p>In her own room Mrs Robson, in her nightdress, took out her
hairpins and shook down her thick hair. She sat with her face
half-shadowed by it, and gazed into the reflection of her own eyes.
They looked back at her inscrutably. She solemnly poked out the
pink end of her tongue, shook her head impatiently, and sighed.
Finally she jerked the gold circlet impatiently from her finger,
threw it into a drawer, which she closed as though she were
thrusting a dead mouse out of sight, and slid into her bed.</p>

<p>To Harwood the holidays seemed shorter than of old. He worked on
the farm with his usual energy, but he felt that he was living for
the moments he spent in the kitchen. It was not till the evening of
Sunday that he saw her alone and by that time he had lost all taste
for popularity, and was comically rueful, in his own sight, over
the affection that brought Tom and Sally to his feet, and the
comradeship that planted Burgess solemnly at his side. Only in one
respect had he made any progress. To the rest she was Daisy, and,
as though accidently acquiescing in the domestic habit, he too
addressed her by her baptismal name. She gave him a sidelong look
when first he uttered the word, but answered as if she had noticed
nothing unusual. Still, undoubtedly it placed them on better terms.
But, after all, did it? He was not sure. He had heard no more of
Robson. He wondered how long her married life had lasted&mdash;oh,
hang Robson! Dead or alive, hang him! Jinny was perhaps three years
old, perhaps older, or younger. He was inexperienced in estimating
the age of infants. Dear little kid, anyway. Robson's kid. There it
was again. But like her mother. A very dear little kid. He caught
himself noting small differences and trying to reconstruct Robson.
He was throwing out from his mind the fragments of that dinosaurian
monster when he managed to intercept Daisy between the bedroom,
where she had just tucked the blanket about Jinny, and the kitchen,
where Tom and Sally were still laughing over one of his jokes.</p>

<p>"It's a lovely night," he said. "Don't go in yet."</p>

<p>They stepped off the end of the low veranda, and as he touched
her hand to steady her&mdash;a quite unnecessary
precaution&mdash;he thought she shivered.</p>

<p>"Are you cold? Shall I get a wrap?" he said.</p>

<p>"No. I'm not cold."</p>

<p>They sauntered to the gate in the shadow of cypress and native
apple. She was silent, crooning in her heart a sad farewell. He
spoke of the scents that blew from the garden and the bitter
fragrance of a patch of burnt grass. They leaned together on the
gate, and there was silence. She waited, with beating heart, to
welcome and dismiss.</p>

<p>"Daisy!" he said suddenly.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. I know. I know," she answered.</p>

<p>"Daisy, I want you. Since the world was made I've been wanting
you, Daisy, I think. And now you're here." He reached for her hand,
but she drew it away, and stood before him quietly, wearily.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. I know. I believe what you say. I know. But it's
impossible. I can't tell you. I can't. But it's impossible."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because I know&mdash;yes, you love me." She stayed his abrupt
movement with a gesture. "And I can't give you everything.
It's&mdash;oh, it's cruel; but I can't tell you." She was gasping
as though for breath. "You are good to me."</p>

<p>"Mr Harwood!" bawled Tom from the kitchen door.</p>

<p>"Quick," he whispered. "What is it? Is there anybody else with a
claim? Are you true against your own feelings&mdash;true to another
man, or a memory?"</p>

<p>"No." He heard the shudder in her voice.</p>

<p>In a moment he threw his arms about her, pressed her tightly to
him, kissed her hair, for her head drooped and her face was hidden
against his coat, and released her as Tom came along the track. He
heard her catch her breath.</p>

<p>"I thought it was you," said the boy with great
self-satisfaction. "Dad wants to know if you're going to have a
game."</p>

<p>"Right-oh, Tom!" he answered lightly. "But we'll have to do
without Daisy. She's tired out. I think she's going to bed."</p>

<p>"Good shot!" was Tom's happy comment. "Dad'll let me take a
hand."</p>

<p>A minute or two later Daisy lay on her bed, face downward,
heaving with silent sobs. At last she rolled over, gave one long
trembling sigh, sat up, lit a candle, and examined her swollen face
in the mirror. "Well," she muttered, with a wry smile, "he wouldn't
want you, if he could see you now, I'm glad he can't."</p>

<p>Harwood, on his way to bed, stood for a minute or two at her
door, his muscles tense and his heart longing. From the veranda,
close at hand, came the hard voice of one of the boarders: "Well,
he's a fellow of pretty vulgar tastes. A gentleman doesn't wash up.
As for her, it's easy to see she's setting her cap at him." And
then the indolent tones of the other: "Oh, I don't know. He's not
so bad, Madge. And if she likes him, why not?" He grinned grimly,
withdrew as softly as he could, and approached the house from the
front, whistling "Rackety-Coo."</p>

<p>Next day he had to get back to town, and she gave him no
opportunity of seeing her alone. The car arrived. He bade farewell
to Mrs Burgess, whose thin handsome face looked more drawn than
ever, though she could still take a communicative interest in the
unpleasant details of her complaint. He chased Sally round the car,
according to his wont, and gave her a kiss which she said was like
the smack of a whip. There was handshaking and the usual sorry
cheerfulness of a departure. To Daisy he said, "I'll be back in the
summer;" and at her simple statement, "I'll be at Wattle Hollow
then," he returned, "So shall I." Burgess turned his back and
winked at a cow that was chewing the cud just at the other side of
the fence.</p>

<p>When Harwood looked back, the others were lost to sight behind
the cypresses; she stood, a lonely figure, at the gate.</p>

<p>He had forgotten to bid farewell to the boarders.</p>

<p>One evening, a couple of months later, he found at his dingy
lodgings a letter from Burgess. It announced the death of Mrs
Burgess. "Things were upset a while. I suppose they are upset now,"
he wrote; "I always thought that feller Whipple wasn't much good.
Poor Sarah, I thought she was getting a bit better, because she
left off talking about her simtoms, but she took real bad all of a
sudden. Lucky Daisy was here. She's a good girl. She says she will
stay on while I want her now but I don't know. I feel Ide like to
ask poor Sarah about that."</p>

<p>Harwood was genuinely sorry. He liked the Burgesses, and he knew
how lost the farmer would feel without his helpmate. He wrote a
sympathetic note of condolence. Then he wrote another
letter:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My dear Girl,</p>

<p>"The worry and trouble has been largely your share, and it makes
me mad to think I couldn't be there to take it over, as much as a
man could. I want to share sorrow and joy with you, Daisy; to make
the one lighter and the other brighter. In the summer, I'll see
you. I know you are not indifferent to nie, dear Girl. Whatever it
is, I've got to know. I hope it's something I can heave into the
river. In any case, I've got to know, so you can spend the time
from now to Christmas in putting the story together. And when next
my arms are round you I'll keep them there if Tom brings all the
neighbours." And thereafter the letter became rather incoherent. He
received no reply. He hardly expected one.</p>

<p>In January he arrived at the river for a stay of two weeks.
There had been rain shortly before, and, though the weather was
hot, the place was delightfully green. He welcomed the freshness
and beauty of the landscape as a happy promise of good fortune.
They were all waiting for him. He was frank and eager&mdash;spoke
to her first, and held her hand while he nodded at the two younger
people. She looked at him with a grave smile and heightened
colour.</p>

<p>"Daisy, I'm glad to see you. Have you put it together?" was his
greeting.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied doubtfully, "but it won't stay together. A
hot wind blows it to bits."</p>

<p>"What's that?" interposed Burgess. "No hot wind lately. How are
you, Mr Harwood?" He shook hands rather listlessly. "Is it a
puzzle?"</p>

<p>"It is," assented Harwood.</p>

<p>The atmosphere of the place seemed to have changed. Somehow, in
spite of the green grass and the blue sky and the shining river,
there was a touch of desolation, of decay, upon the farm. The house
was as spotless and neat as at Easter, of course; and from a
derisive remark of Tom's he gathered that Daisy had spent the day
before his arrival in an unprecedented, universal, double-banked
cleanup. But he noticed indications of neglect
outside&mdash;unmended fences, a cultivation patch, overgrown with
weeds, and a hundred smaller signs that the grip of the master had
relaxed.</p>

<p>Burgess unburdened himself as they fed the pigs.</p>

<p>"They like that, don't they?" he remarked, as a crowd of little
black pigs shouldered at the trough, while two of the greediest
stood thigh-deep in the skimmed milk and refuse. "I wish I could
feel like that about my tucker. It ain't the same, Mr Harwood. Poor
Sarah made more difference than you'd think. I had my eye on Sarah
when I was a kid, no more than fifteen, an' I told her nothing for
years. It was a hard job. Not but what she knew, of course. I
wanted a place to put her in, an' there were bad seasons and tries
that didn't work, and I s'pose I was a bit of a failure. It wasn't
till the old man died an' left me the farm that I got me chance. I
might a' kept her before, I know. P'raps I was wrong. I don't know
what poor Sarah would say to that. I wanted a place real fit for
her."</p>

<p>"I understand," Harwood said gently. "And she must have
understood too."</p>

<p>"She did. She did that. Oh, yes," he reflected, and fixed his
eye on the pigs. "It's just fifteen years since I brought her over
from Wattle Hollow&mdash;just fifteen years, Mr Harwood; and the
prettiest woman in the district, and the best. Well, it ain't the
same. Not but what Daisy don't do her best. She's a good gell. But
it ain't the same."</p>

<p>They took up the empty kerosene-tin buckets, and as they walked
up the slope, he began again. "I wouldn't have any boarders this
year. You don't count. But it wouldn't hardly be fair to
Daisy&mdash;she has enough to do without 'em&mdash;and Lord knows I
don't want 'em."</p>

<p>"Perhaps they'd have been company," ventured Harwood.</p>

<p>"No!" was the abrupt reply. "And there's more I'd like to say.
Wait here a while. Put down those buckets. Are you still thinkin'
o' takin' a farm, Mr Harwood? Because, if you are, I'll let you
have this one cheap."</p>

<p>"But what do you mean to do?"</p>

<p>"Go down near Sydney, and take a cheap place, or a lodging, or
anything. Sally's runnin' wild, and she's pretty near fourteen. I
want to send her to a good school for a year or two, an' I want to
be where I can see her pretty often. An' when I say pretty often, I
mean pretty often."</p>

<p>"I see," said Harwood. "What terms?"</p>

<p>Burgess had thought it all out, and went into figures. The offer
was reasonable, and it was within Harwood's means. He considered it
for a few moments in silence. Then he said, "Before I go, I'll tell
you."</p>

<p>Burgess looked him in the eye. "Right," he said gravely, "an' I
wish you luck."</p>

<p>The two men shook hands.</p>

<p>After the tea-things had been washed, Jinny claimed him for a
romp. Then Sally reached the cards from the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>"Daisy and I are going for a pull on the river," Harwood
announced calmly.</p>

<p>"Good shot! I'll take one oar," cried Tom.</p>

<p>"What about me?" Sally asked.</p>

<p>"You and Tom can stop with your father. I'll take you to-morrow
night. To-night Daisy and I are going by ourselves."</p>

<p>"Well, you are mean, Daisy," Tom expostulated. "You won't leave
us out, will you."</p>

<p>"Do you really mean it?" said Sally.</p>

<p>And Daisy said, "Yes."</p>

<p>He pushed the boat out into the stream, and noticed how pale her
face looked in the moonlight. He turned the prow against the
current.</p>

<p>"Up?" she said. "It's more snaggy that way."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "I know; and one can only go a mile in this
direction. and it's five down to the weir. But there are fewer
boats up here. And, besides, we needn't go far."</p>

<p>After pulling steadily for a few minutes he ran the boat ashore
in the thick shadow under an osier, tied the painter to an
overhanging bough, and silently helped her ashore. There they lay
side by side on a slope of grass. There was a faint fragrance of
maidenhair fern, and across the flats came the regular hooting of a
more-pork.</p>

<p>He raised her limp hand to his lips.</p>

<p>"Well?" he said.</p>

<p>She turned suddenly to him, hid her face on his breast, and
cried, shaken from head to foot with violent sobs. He stroked her
hair, put an arm protectingly about her, and waited.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," she said at last, as the storm of sobs subsided.
She swabbed her eyes with a handkerchief, and blew her nose. "I
can't help being a fool." And she took his arm and thrust it gently
away, and lay back, looking with wide eyes at the branches above
her.</p>

<p>"I've deceived you," she said, with a forced calmness. "I was
very young. I thought he loved me. I thought I loved him. One
night&mdash;one night I was mad. He was doing a harvesting job at
our place. He'd been a sailor, but deserted his ship. When I told
him that I&mdash;well it was Jinny. Next day he was gone. I didn't
want him then. I knew him. I loved Jinny, not him." She lay still
with a white face, mottled by the light of the moon. "You
understand? I've deceived you. I'm not a widow."</p>

<p>"Thank God," he said, as he drew her to him and pressed his lips
on hers. And through the vast silence that encircled them she heard
clearly the notes of the more-pork.</p>

<p>It was half an hour before he thought again of the phantom who
had been his rival. Then he took her left hand in his and felt the
fingers. She withdrew the hand with a happy sigh, produced a gold
ring from her pocket, and gave it to him without a word. There was
a flash in the moonlight, and a sharp plop from the surface of the
river.</p>

<p>"There goes Robson," he said.</p>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>FLUELLEN</h2>

<p class="cp"><i>(A Specimen of Method and Result in
Shakespeare-Study)</i>
</p>

<p>The two greatest bores in literature are Dugald Dalgetty and
Fluellen, and Fluellen would be worse than Dalgetty if we had a
scene or two more of him; as matters stand, we may grant them a
dead heat in dreariness. The traditions of the stage and the study
present Shakespeare's Welshman as a diverting comic character and a
man of courage and military efficiency: according to Shakespeare,
he is a dull prater, a coward, and certainly no soldier. That he is
a bore is proved by experiment. Shake off the hypnosis induced by a
contemplation of Shakespeare as known to the critics, and pretend
for a few moments that Fluellen is the creation of Bernard Shaw, or
of any American humorist; well, there you are!</p>

<p>We meet the fellow first at the siege of Harfleur. Henry has led
a charge against the breach, and as soon as all immediate danger is
past, the poltroon crew&mdash;Nym, Bardolph, and Pistol&mdash;come
up from the rear. Only one man has hung back further than they.
Fluellen, redfaced and abusive, knowing well from their bearing and
inaction that they are utter curs, assumes an air of valour,
follows them up and, under protection of his military rank, beats
them toward the breach. It may be objected that we are not clearly
told from which direction he came, and that possibly he had taken
part in the charge. That is quite true; he may have been the first
to sneak away from the fighting. In any case, he does not follow
his victims to the breach, but stays at a safe distance and talks.
Gower brings him an order from his superior officer, the Duke of
Gloucester. He is to go immediately to the mines, for the Duke
wishes to speak to him. Fluellen ignores the order, and criticizes
the work done by the miners. He thinks the Irishman, Mackmorrice,
who has directed the operations, is an ass; and why? Because the
valiant Mackmorrice is no scholar, and knows nothing of the
military methods of the Romans. Fluellen's military knowledge is
mere pedantry and has no bearing on the actual fighting. In modern
tactics he is a fool. Henry says he is "a little out of fashion;"
he is, in fact, hopelessly out of date. We learn from Holinshed
that the mines were the direct cause of the town's capitulation:
and this Welsh babbler would abandon them, because they are "not
according to the disciplines of the war" as it might have been
waged by Sulla or Caesar. He praises the Scots captain, Jamy,
because Jamy is cautious enough to agree with him when he blithers
about ancient warfare. When Mackmorrice, who takes a soldierly
delight in burrowing and throat-cutting, is angry at the
abandonment of the mines, Fluellen wishes to argue with him from
the standpoint of an antique Roman. He has no taste for blows with
mattock or blade, for he is a talker in the hour of action, a windy
skulker. "It is no time to discourse," blares Mackmorrice, and even
the prudent Jamy is shamed into a momentary determination to do
good service; but Fluellen still holds forth in his ridiculous
jargon, and betrays a conceit that is founded on schoolboy reading
and the merit of his ancestors. Then a parley is sounded from the
walls of the town. For the time being, the fighting is over, so the
tongue-wagging hero rushes off to his place among the warriors.</p>

<p>It soon becomes evident that the Duke of Gloucester is sick of
him, for, when next we come across him, he is under the command of
Exeter, who, with an advance party, is holding the bridge over the
Ternoise. A sharp action has been taking place, but Fluellen is
well in the rear and has his back to the river when he is met by
Gower, who has been sent by the King for a report on the safety of
Exeter's force. The shirker hastens to divert attention from
himself by praising the Duke and Pistol. He knows so little about
modern military rank that he calls the latter "an aunchient
lieutenant" (an impossible title), and proves himself a poor judge
of character by his inability to distinguish bluster from courage.
It is clear that, in his flight, he has observed Pistol waving a
sword and bellowing encouragement to the men in front, so he has no
doubt that the swasher is as valiant as Mark Antony and was about
to do gallant service. "I did <i>see</i> him do as gallant
service&mdash;," he lies. He flatters himself that he has merited
some love at the hands of Exeter; probably he had talked to him
about Pompey. Pistol comes up and begins an oration in defence of
Bardolph, and pauses for breath just as he is in the midst of a
detailed description of the goddess Fortune. He is on the pedant's
own ground. Before he can resume his speech, Fluellen interposes a
lecture, in pidgin-English, on classical symbolism. Pistol hears
him out, and returns to the attack; for, though Henry of Monmouth
may desert his friends and snuffle their funeral sermons, the
blustering ancient retains some sense of decency. Fluellen will not
use his influence to protect a criminal. He thinks he knows what
Pompey would have done, and is ready to hang a man on Roman
precedents. He may not have a true sense of justice, but he knows
what belongs to an antiquary. Properly contemptuous, Pistol insults
his captain, who would immediately have handed him over to the
guard if he had known his business, but instead, believing him to
be a man of courage, meekly puts up with the affront with, "It is
well!...very good!" As soon as he hears that his adversary is a
"counterfeit rascal," he begins to whip up his own courage. He will
act "when time will serve" and will tell him his mind. On the
arrival of the rearguard he must suddenly invent an excuse for his
absence from the skirmish, so he pretends he has a message from the
bridge. He gives the King a vague and fanciful account of the
action, and once more diverts attention from himself by directing
it to the Duke. When asked what loss the English have sustained, he
is in some confusion. He begins at first to babble of the
"perdition of the athversary," though he can give no intelligible
account of it. He knows nothing of the English loss, but
desperately refers to the fate of Bardolph, of whose case he has
just heard from Pistol. To make it appear like an actual loss of
life he inconsistently pretends that the execution has already been
carried out. No doubt he is delighted when the interview is broken
off by the arrival of Montjoy.</p>

<p>On the eve of Agincourt the pedantic bore chatters to Gower
about the necessity for silence in the camp, for, though he seems
to have no knowledge of his own General's orders, he is confident
that there was no tiddle-taddle in Pompey's camp. Pompey, one
concludes, had no time for Roman Fluellens. The King approvingly
notes that there is "much care and valour in this Welshman;" but
this is what we might have anticipated, for Henry is a moron. He
could not see through the conspirators or the two dishonest
Bishops, and even believes that he himself is sincere.</p>

<p>Honours are easy on the field of Agincourt. Even Pistol can
catch a Frenchman: but where is Fluellen? He keeps out of sight
until the prisoners have been murdered. Then he bravely lifts up
his voice, and we hear him denouncing the French for their raid,
which, he says, was not in accordance with precedent. It is all a
book matter to him&mdash;a breach of law, not an offence against
humanity. Accordingly he can consistently praise the gallantry of
Henry's order that every soldier should cut his prisoner's throat.
Smugly patriotic, he is delighted at the reflection that the royal
murderer was born in Wales. His laboured comparison of Henry of
Monmouth with Alexander of Macedon is a masterpiece of dreary
asininity. He exhibits his usual bad manners in his familiarity
with the King, whom he addresses abruptly with an insolent
assumption of equality. Taking it for granted that his Majesty is
no student, he tries to impress him with a reference to the
Chronicles, and impudently pretends to have read in them an account
of an incident which is entirely his own invention. To cap this, he
says, in his self-satisfied manner, "I need not to be ashamed of
your Majesty, praised be God, so long as your Majesty is an honest
man!" What superb insolence! And when the King appeals to him on a
point of honour, he answers as a man of untainted reputation, a
hero and a champion of truth, and boldly appeals to his conscience
in support of his arguments. To Gower, whom we remember as a quiet
gentleman who knows how to keep out of harm's way, he gives a
certificate of military merit:&mdash;"Gower is a good Captain, and
is good knowledge and literatured in the wars." We have heard him
speak similarly of poor Jamy. When Henry gives him the glove to
wear in his cap he swaggers, never believing that it will be
challenged, and is excessively eager to protest that he is a
fire-eater. "I would fain see the man...that shall find himself
aggrieved at this glove," he says truculently, "...but I would fain
see it once, and please God of his grace that I might see!" Like
many other essentially irreligious scamps, he is very fond of a
blasphemous invocation of the Almighty. And, of course, Henry, the
unconscious hypocrite and pious fraud, is taken in, and mistakes
bragging and bad temper for ready valour. When Williams challenges
the glove, Fluellen throws words at him and slinks behind Gower.
From this point of vantage he speaks with his usual ostentation of
bravery:&mdash;"Stand away, Captain Gower! I will give treason his
payment into plowes, I warrant you!" And then, as Williams begins
to look formidable, "I charge you in his Majesty's name, apprehend
him." Why should he charge Gower to act? He and Gower are of equal
rank. Why does he not effect the arrest himself? When the man is in
safe custody, Fluellen regains confidence and covers him with the
vilest abuse. Is this conduct proper to an officer and a gentleman?
He is bitterly vindictive and clamours for the execution of the
prisoner. But what a change when the King displays good-will toward
Williams! Anything to curry favour! Fluellen spends a whole
shilling and condescendingly advises Williams to keep out of
brawls. A little later, Henry proclaims that it is to be a capital
offence to take from God the credit of the victory of Agincourt,
and naturally Fluellen is the first to seek a way to make the
decree null and void. He desires to retain the right of advertising
the number of the slain, though we may easily estimate his share of
the slaying, and to Henry's reminder that God was, as usual, on the
English side, he replies, with irreverent irony, "Yes...he did us
great good."</p>

<p>After Gower has informed him that Pistol is a pretender,
Fluellen doubtless watches his enemy narrowly and assures himself
that there is nothing to be feared from him. He decides that the
fellow will not dare to resist him, if he put on a bold front, and
he spends the several years that elapse between Act IV and Act V in
screwing his courage to the sticking-place. Then, taking good care
to have the support of a friend and to catch his adversary alone,
he forces Pistol to eat a leek. Throughout the scene there is
evidence that the blows which he showers upon the unhappy ancient
are directed at the head. This is no ordinary drubbing; its purpose
is to reduce the victim to a state of semi-consciousness and
complete helplessness. No wonder Gower, in disgust, begs his friend
to desist. "Enough, Captain!" he says, "you have astonished him!"
Pistol is the last of the roystering crew who once were the
comrades of Falstaff and the seal of his utter degradation is
this&mdash;he is forced to accept a beating and a groat from the
hands of the abject Fluellen.</p>

<p>The portrait of Fluellen is painted with such vigour of dislike
that one would naturally surmise that it was drawn directly from a
living model. The model has been found. One William Fluellen and
eight other persons, among whom was Mr John Shakespeare, the dirty
wretch who heaped a mountain of manure beside his front door, were
named by Sir Thomas Lucy and other commissioners in a list dated 25
September 1592, "for not coming monthly to the church according to
Her Majesty's laws." That is Fluellen all over. He neglected his
duty to Heaven, and sat at home reading Plutarch (or, perhaps, only
pretending to read) and hatching malicious plots against his
neighbours. And upon his head be the curse of all who have been
forced in their schooldays to endure his tediousness!</p>
