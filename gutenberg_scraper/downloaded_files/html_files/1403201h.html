  <h2><a id="story1"
     name="story1"></a>I. &mdash; THE AFFAIR OF SAMUEL'S DIAMONDS</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Harmsworth London Magazine</i>, Nov 1902</h3>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">I have already recorded many of the adventures of my friend
  Martin Hewitt, but among them there have been more of a certain few which
  were discovered to be related together in a very extraordinary manner; and it
  is to these that I am now at liberty to address myself. There may have been
  others&mdash;cases which gave no indication of their connection with these;
  some of them indeed I may have told without a suspicion of their connection
  with the Red Triangle; but the first in which that singular accompaniment
  became apparent was the matter of Samuel's diamonds. The case exhibited many
  interesting features, and I was very anxious to report it, with perhaps even
  less delay than I had thought judicious in other cases; but Hewitt restrained
  me.</p>

  <p>"No, Brett," he said, "there is more to come of this. This particular case
  is over, it is true, but there is much behind. I've an idea that I shall see
  that Red Triangle again. I may, or, of course, I may not; but there is deep
  work going on&mdash;very deep work, and whether we see more of it or not, I
  must keep prepared. I can't afford to throw a single card upon the table. So,
  as many notes as you please, Brett, for future reference; but no publication
  yet&mdash;none of your journalism!"</p>

  <p>Hewitt was right. It was not so long before we heard more of the Red
  Triangle, and after that more, though the true connection of some of the
  cases with the mysterious symbol and the meaning of the symbol itself
  remained for a time undiscovered. But at last Hewitt was able to unmask the
  hideous secret, and for ever put an end to the evil influence that gathered
  about the sign; and now there remains no reason why the full story should not
  be told.</p>

  <p>I have told elsewhere of my first acquaintance with Martin Hewitt, of his
  pleasant and companionable nature, his ordinary height, his stoutness, his
  round, smiling face&mdash;those characteristics that aided him so well in his
  business of investigator, so unlike was his appearance and manner to that of
  the private detective of the ordinary person's imagination. Therefore I need
  only remind my readers that my bachelor chambers were, during most of my
  acquaintance with Hewitt, in the old building near the Strand, in which
  Hewitt's office stood at the top of the first flight of stairs; where the
  plain ground-glass of the door bore as inscription the single word "Hewitt,"
  and the sharp lad, Kerrett, first received visitors in the outer office.</p>

  <p>Next door to this old house, at the time I am to speak of, a much newer
  building stood, especially built for letting out in offices. It happened that
  one day as Hewitt left his office for a late lunch, he became aware of a
  pallid and agitated Jew who was pervading the front door of this adjoining
  building. The man exhibited every sign of nervous expectancy, staring this
  way and that up and down the busy street, and once or twice rushing aimlessly
  half-way up the inner stairs, and as often returning to the door.
  Apprehension was plain on his pale face, and he was clearly in a state that
  blinded his attention to the ordinary matters about him, just as happens when
  a man is in momentary and nervous expectation of some serious event.</p>

  <p>Noting these things as he passed, with no more than the observation that
  was his professional habit, Hewitt proceeded to his lunch. This done with, he
  returned to his office, perceiving, as he passed the next-door building, that
  the distracted Jew was no longer visible. It seemed plain that the person or
  the event he had awaited with such obvious nervousness had arrived and
  passed; one more of the problems, anxieties or crises that join and unravel
  moment by moment in the human ant-hill of London, had perhaps closed for good
  or ill within the past half-hour; perhaps it had only begun.</p>

  <p>A message awaited Hewitt at his office&mdash;an urgent message. The
  housekeeper had come in from next door, Kerrett reported, with an urgent
  request that Mr. Martin Hewitt would go immediately to the offices of Mr.
  Denson, on the third floor. The housekeeper seemed to know little or nothing
  of the business, except that a Mr. Samuel was alone in Mr. Denson's office,
  and had sent the message.</p>

  <p>With no delay Hewitt transferred himself to the next-door offices. There
  the housekeeper, who inhabited a uniform and a glass box opposite the foot of
  the first flight of stairs, directed Hewitt, with the remark that the
  gentleman was very impatient and very much upset. "Third floor, sir, second
  door on the right; name Denson on the door. There's no lift."</p>

  <p>"W.F. Denson" was the complete name, followed by the line "Foreign and
  Commission Agent." This Hewitt read with some little difficulty, for the door
  was open, and on the threshold stood that same agitated Jew whom Hewitt had
  seen at the front door.</p>

  <p>A little less actively perturbed now, he was nevertheless still nervously
  pale. "Mr. Martin Hewitt?" he cried, while Hewitt was still only at the head
  of the stairs. "Is it Mr. Martin Hewitt?"</p>

  <p>Hewitt came quietly along the corridor, using eyes and ears as he came.
  The Jew was a man of middle height, very obviously Jewish, and with a slight
  accent that hinted a Continental origin.</p>

  <p>"I have just received your message," Hewitt said, "and, as you see, I am
  here with no delay. Is Mr. Denson in?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;good heafens no&mdash;I would gif anything if he was, Mr.
  Hewitt. Come in, do! I haf been robbed&mdash;robbed by Denson himself,
  wit'out a wort of doubt. It is terrible&mdash;terrible! Fifteen t'ousant
  pounds! It ruins me, Mr. Hewitt, ruins me! Unless you can recover it! If you
  recover it, I will pay&mdash;pay&mdash;oh, I will pay fery well indeed!"</p>

  <p><a id="pic1"
     name="pic1"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>There was a characteristically sudden moderation of the client's emphasis
  when he came to the engagement to pay. Hewitt had observed it in other
  clients, but it did not disturb him.</p>

  <p>"First," he said, "you must tell me your difficulty. You say you have been
  robbed of fifteen thousand pounds&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Tiamonts, Mr. Hewitt&mdash;tiamonts! All from the case&mdash;here is the
  case, empty&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Let us be methodical. We will shut the door and sit down." Hewitt pressed
  his client into a chair and produced his note-book. "It will be better to
  begin at the beginning. First, I should like to know your name, and a few
  such particulars as that."</p>

  <p>"Lewis Samuel, Hatton Garden&mdash;150, Hatton Garden&mdash;tiamont
  merchant."</p>

  <p>"Yes. And what is your connection with Mr. Denson?"</p>

  <p>"Business&mdash;just business," Samuel responded. He pronounced it
  "pishness," and it seemed his favourite word. "Like this; I will tell you. I
  haf known him some time, and did at first small pishness. He bought a little
  tiamont and haf it set in pracelet, and he pay&mdash;straightforward
  pishness. Then he bought some very good paste stones, all set in gold, and he
  pay&mdash;quite straightforward pishness. At the same time he says, 'I am
  pishness man myself, Mr. Samuel,' he says, 'and I like to make a little
  moneys as well as pay out sometimes. Don't you want any little agencies done?
  I do all foreign commissions, and I can forwart and receive and clear at dock
  and custom house. If you send any tiamonts I can consign and
  insure&mdash;very cheapest rates to you, special. If you want brokerage or
  buy and sell for you, confidential, I can do it with lowest commission.
  Especially I haf good connection with America. I haf many rich Americans,
  principals and customers,' he says, 'and often I could do pishness for you
  when they come over.'"</p>

  <p>"By which he meant he might sell them diamonds?" Hewitt queried.</p>

  <p>"Just so, Mr. Hewitt&mdash;reg'lar pishness. And after that two or three
  little parcels of tiamonts he bought&mdash;for American customers, he says.
  But he says he can do bigger pishness soon. Ay, so he has&mdash;goot heavens,
  he has! But I tell you. I do also one or two small pishnesses with him, and
  that is all right&mdash;he treat me very well and I pay when it suits. Then
  he says, 'Samuel,' he says, very friendly now inteet, 'Samuel, could you get
  a nice large lot of tiamonts for an American customer I expect here soon?'
  And I say, 'Of course I can.' 'Enough,' he says, 'to fit out a rich man's
  wife&mdash;that is, to pegin. He is not long rich, and he will want more
  soon&mdash;ah, she will make him pay! But to pegin&mdash;a good fit-out of
  tiamonts, eh?'</p>

  <p>"I tell him yes, and I offer usual commission. But no, says Denson, he
  wants no commission; he will make his own profit. That I don't mind so long
  as I get mine; so I agree to put the tiamonts in at a price. The American, he
  says, is to come over about a big company deal, and when it is through he
  will pay well. So last week I pring a peautiful collection all cut but unset,
  and I wait out in that room while Denson shows them to his customer."</p>

  <p>"You mean you let them out of your sight?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;that is not so uncommon; reg'lar pishness. You see I was out
  here&mdash;this is the only way out. Denson was in the inner office with the
  stones and the American. Neither could get out without passing here. And I
  had done pishness with him alretty."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"You see I wait downstairs with my case&mdash;this case&mdash;till Denson
  sends down. He doesn't want me to show&mdash;fery natural, you see, in
  pishness. When I sell to make a profit, perhaps for somebody else, I don't
  want that somebody to know my customer, else he sells direct and I lose my
  profit&mdash;fery natural. See?"</p>

  <p>"Of course, I understand. It's a point of business among you gentlemen to
  keep your own customers to yourselves. And often, no doubt, diamonds pass
  through several hands before reaching the eventual customer, leaving a profit
  in each."</p>

  <p>"Always, Mr. Hewitt&mdash;always, you might say. Well, you see, Denson
  sends down that his customer is in, and I come up. Denson comes out from the
  inner office, takes my case, and I wait in there."</p>

  <p>The case which Samuel showed Hewitt was of black leather, perhaps eighteen
  inches long by a foot wide. The arrangement of the office was simple. In
  this, the outer room, a small space was partitioned off by means of a ground
  glass screen, and it was in there that Samuel meant that he had waited.</p>

  <p>"Well, he took the case in, and I could hear some sound of
  talking&mdash;but not much, you see, the door being shut. After a time the
  door opens and I hear Denson say: 'Very well, think over it; but don't be
  long or you'll lose the chance. Excuse me while I put them back in the safe.'
  Then he shuts the door and brings the case to me and goes back. But of course
  I stay till I haf looked very carefully through all the tiamonts, in the
  different compartments of the case, in case one might haf dropped on the
  floor, or got changed, you know. That is pishness."</p>

  <p>"Just so. And they were all right?"</p>

  <p>"All right and same as the list&mdash;I know well a tiamont that I haf
  seen once. So I go away, and afterwards Denson tells me that the American
  liked much the stones but wouldn't quite come up to price. That, of course,
  is fery usual pishness. 'But he will rise, Samuel,' Denson says. 'I know him
  quite well, and them tiamonts is as good as sold with a good profit for me;
  and a good one for you, too, I bet,' he says. I was putting the lot to him
  for fifteen t'ousant pounds, and it would have been a nice profit in that for
  me. And then Denson he chaffs me and he says, 'Ah! Samuel,' he says, 'wasn't
  you afraid my customer and me would hook it out o' the window with all your
  stones?' I don't like that sort o' joke in pishness, you see, but I say, 'All
  right&mdash;I wasn't afraid o' that. The window was a mile too high, and
  besides I could see it from where I was a-sitting.' And so I could, you see,
  plain enough to see if it was opened."</p>

  <p>The ground-glass partition, in fact, cut off a part of the window of the
  outer office, which, being at an angle with the inner room, gave a side view
  of the window that lighted that apartment.</p>

  <p>"Denson laughed at that," Samuel went on. "'Ha-ha!' says he, 'I never
  thought of that. Then you could see the American's hat hanging up just by the
  window&mdash;rum hat, ain't it?' And that was quite true, for I had noticed
  it&mdash;a big, grey wideawake, almost white."</p>

  <p>Hewitt nodded approvingly. "You are quite right," he said, "to tell me
  everything you recollect, even of the most trivial sort; the smallest thing
  may be very valuable. So you took your diamonds away the first time, last
  week. What next?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I came again, just the same, to-day, by appointment. Just the same
  I sat in that place, and just the same Denson took the case into the inner
  room. 'He's come to buy this time, I can see,' Denson whispers, and winks.
  'But he'll fight hard over the price. We'll see!' and off he goes into the
  other room. Well, I waited. I waited and I waited a long time. I looked out
  sideways at the window, and there I see the American's big wideawake hat
  hanging up just inside the other window, same as last time. So I think they
  are a long time settling the price, and I wait some more. But it is such a
  very long time, and I begin to feel uneasy. Of course, I know you cannot sell
  fifteen t'ousant wort' of tiamonts in five minutes&mdash;that is not
  reasonable pishness. But I could hear nothing at all now&mdash;not a sound.
  And the boy&mdash;the boy that came down to call me up&mdash;he wasn't come
  back. But there I could see the big wideawake hat still hanging inside the
  window, and of course I knew there was only one door out of the inner room,
  right before me, so it seemed foolish to be uneasy. So I waited longer still,
  but now it was so late, I thought they should have come out to lunch before
  this, and then I was fery uneasy&mdash;fery uneasy inteet. So I thought I
  would pretend to be a new caller, and I opened the outer office door and
  banged it, and walked in very loud and knocked on the boy's table. I thought
  Denson would come when he heard that, but no&mdash;there was not a sound. So
  I got more uneasy, and I opened the window and leaned out as far as I could,
  to look in at the other window. There I could see nothing but the big hat and
  the back of a chair and a bit of the room&mdash;empty. So I went and banged
  the outer door again, and called out, 'Hi! Mr. Denson, you're wanted! Hi!
  d'y'ear?' and knocked with my umbrella on the inner door; and, Mr.
  Hewitt&mdash;you might have knocked me down with half a feather when I got no
  answer at all&mdash;not a sound! I opened the door, Mr. Hewitt, and there was
  nobody there&mdash;nobody! There was my leather case on the table,
  open&mdash;and empty! Fifteen t'ousant pounds in tiamonts, Mr.
  Hewitt&mdash;it ruins me!"</p>

  <p>Hewitt rose, and flung wide the inner office door. "This is certainly the
  only door," he said, "and that is the only window&mdash;quite well in view
  from where you sat. There is the wideawake hat still hanging there&mdash;see,
  it is quite new; obviously brought for you to look at, it would seem. The
  door and the window were not used, and the chimney is
  impossible&mdash;register grate. But there was one other
  way&mdash;there."</p>

  <p>The inner wall of each of the rooms was the wall of the corridor into
  which all the offices opened, and this corridor was lighted&mdash;and the
  offices partly ventilated&mdash;by a sort of hinged casement or fanlight
  close up by the ceiling, oblong, and extending the most of the length of each
  room. Plainly an active man, not too stout, might mount a chair-back, and
  climb very quietly through the opening. "That's the only way," said Hewitt,
  pointing.</p>

  <p>"Yes," answered Samuel, nodding and rubbing his knuckles together
  nervously. "I saw it&mdash;saw it when it was too late. But who'd have
  thought o' such a thing beforehand? And the American&mdash;either there
  wasn't an American at all, or he got out the same way. But, anyway, here I
  am, and the tiamonts are gone, and there is nothing here but the
  furniture&mdash;not worth twenty pound!"</p>

  <p>"Well," Hewitt said, "so far, I think I understand, though I may have
  questions to ask presently. But go on."</p>

  <p>"Go on? But there is no more, Mr. Hewitt! Quite enough, don't you think?
  There is no more&mdash;I am robbed!"</p>

  <p>"But when you found the empty room, and the case, what did you do? Send
  for the police?"</p>

  <p>The Jew's face clouded slightly. "No, Mr. Hewitt," he said, "not for the
  police, but for you. Reason plain enough. The police make a great fuss, and
  they want to arrest the criminal. Quite right&mdash;I want to arrest him, and
  punish him too, plenty. But most I want the tiamonts back, because if not it
  ruins me. If it was to make choice between two things for me, whether to
  punish Denson or get my tiamonts, then of course I take the tiamonts, and let
  Denson go&mdash;I cannot be ruined. But with the police, if it is their
  choice, they catch the thief first, and hold him tight, whether it loses the
  property or not; the property is only second with them&mdash;with me it is
  first and second, and all. So I take no more risks than I can help, Mr.
  Hewitt. I have sent for you to get first the stones&mdash;afterwards the
  thief if you can. But first my property; you can perhaps find Denson and make
  him give it up rather than go to prison. That would be better than having him
  taken and imprisoned, and perhaps the stones put away safe all the time ready
  for him when he came out."</p>

  <p>"Still, the police can do things that I can't," Hewitt interposed; "stop
  people leaving or landing at ports, and the like. I think we should see
  them."</p>

  <p>Samuel was anxiously emphatic. "No, Mr. Hewitt," he said, "certainly not
  the police. There are reasons&mdash;no, <i>not</i> the police, Mr. Hewitt, at
  any rate, not till you have tried. I cannot haf the police&mdash;just
  yet."</p>

  <p>Martin Hewitt shrugged his shoulders. "Very well," he said, "if those are
  your instructions, I'll do my best. And so you sent for me at once, as soon
  as you discovered the loss?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, at once."</p>

  <p>"Without telling anybody else?"</p>

  <p>"I haf tolt nobody."</p>

  <p>"Did you look about anywhere for Denson&mdash;in the street, or what
  not?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;what was the good? He was gone; there was time for him to go
  miles."</p>

  <p>"Very good. And speaking of time, let me judge how far he may have gone.
  How long were you kept waiting?"</p>

  <p>"Two hours and a quarter, very near&mdash;within five minutes."</p>

  <p>"By your watch?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;I looked often, to see if it was so long waiting as it
  seemed."</p>

  <p>"Very good. Do you happen to have a piece of Denson's writing about
  you?"</p>

  <p>Samuel looked round him. "There's nothing about here," he said, "but
  perhaps we can find&mdash;oh here&mdash;here's a post-card." He took the card
  from his pocket, and gave it to Hewitt.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing else to tell me, then?" queried Hewitt. "Are you sure
  that you have forgotten nothing that has happened since you first
  arrived&mdash;<i>nothing at all</i>?" There was meaning in the emphasis, and
  a sharp look in Hewitt's eyes.</p>

  <p>"No, Mr. Hewitt," Samuel answered, hastily; "there is nothing else I can
  tell you."</p>

  <p>"Then I will think it over at once. You had better go back quietly to your
  office, and think it over yourself, <i>in case</i> you have forgotten
  something; and I need hardly warn you to keep quiet as to what has passed
  between us&mdash;unless you tell the police. I think I shall take the liberty
  of a glance over Mr. Denson's office, and since his office boy still stays
  away, I will lend him my clerk for a little. He will keep his eyes open if
  any callers come, and his ears too. Wait while I fetch him."</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">It was at this point that my humble part in the case began,
  for Hewitt hurried first to my rooms.</p>

  <p>"Brett," he exclaimed, "are you engaged this afternoon?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;nothing important."</p>

  <p>"Will you do me a small favour? I have a rather interesting case. I want a
  man watched for an hour or so, and I haven't a soul to do it. Kerrett
  <i>may</i> be known, and I <i>am</i> known. Besides, there is another job for
  Kerrett."</p>

  <p>Of course, I expressed myself willing to do what I could.</p>

  <p>"Capital," replied Hewitt. "Come along&mdash;you like these adventures, I
  know, or I wouldn't have asked you; and you know the dodges in this sort of
  observation. The man is one Samuel, a Jew, of 150 Hatton Garden, diamond
  dealer. I'll tell you more afterwards. Kerrett and I are going into the
  offices next door, and I want you to wait thereabout. Presently I will come
  downstairs with him and he will go away. An hour or so will be enough,
  probably."</p>

  <p>I followed Hewitt downstairs. He took Kerrett with him and locked his
  office door. I saw them both disappear within the large new building, and I
  waited near a convenient postal pillar-box, prepared to seem very busy with a
  few old letters from my pocket until my man's back was turned.</p>

  <p>In a very few minutes Hewitt reappeared, this time with a man&mdash;a Jew,
  obviously&mdash;whom I remembered having seen already at the door of that
  office more than an hour before, as I had passed on the way from the
  bookseller's at the corner. The man walked briskly up the street, and I, on
  the opposite side, did the same, a little in the rear.</p>

  <p>He turned the corner, and at once slackened his pace and looked about him.
  He took a peep back along the street he had left, and then hailed a cab.</p>

  <p>For a hundred yards or more I was obliged to trot, till I saw another cab
  drop its fare just ahead, and managed to secure it and give the cabman
  instructions to follow the cab in front, before it turned a corner. The chase
  was difficult, for the horse that drew me was a poor one, and half a dozen
  times I thought I had lost sight of the other cab altogether; but my cabman
  was better than his animal, and from his high perch he kept the chase in
  view, turning corners and picking out the cab ahead among a dozen others with
  surprising certainty. We went across Charing Cross Road by way of Cranborne
  Street, past Leicester Square, through Coventry Street and up the Quadrant
  and Regent Street. At Oxford Circus the Jew's cab led us to the left, and
  along Oxford Street we chased it past Bond Street end. Suddenly my cab pulled
  up with a jerk, and the driver spoke through the trapdoor. "That fare's
  getting down, sir," he said, "at the corner o' Duke Street."</p>

  <p>I thrust a half-crown up through the hole and sprang out. "'E's crossing
  the road, sir," the cabman finally reported, and I hurried across the street
  accordingly.</p>

  <p>The man I was watching was strikingly Jewish enough, and easy to
  distinguish in a crowd. I had almost overtaken him before he had gone a dozen
  yards up the northern end of Duke Street. He walked on into Manchester
  Square. There a small, neat brougham, with blinds drawn, was being driven
  slowly round the central garden. I saw Samuel walk hurriedly up to this
  brougham, which stopped as he approached. He stepped quickly into the
  carriage and shut the door behind him. The brougham resumed its slow
  progress, and I loitered, keeping it in view, though the blinds were drawn so
  close that it was impossible to guess who might be Samuel's companion, if he
  had one. I think I have said that when the Jew came to the office door with
  Hewitt I perceived that he was a man I had seen before that day. I was now
  convinced that I had also seen that same brougham, at the same time; but of
  this presently.</p>

  <p><a id="pic3"
     name="pic3"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1403201h-images/Triangle-1-3.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>The carriage made one slow circuit, and then Samuel got out and shut the
  door quickly again. I took the precaution of turning my back and letting him
  overtake and pass me on his way back through Duke Street. At the end of the
  street he mounted an omnibus going east, and I took another seat in the same
  vehicle. The rest was uninteresting. He went direct to No. 150 Hatton Garden,
  and there remained. I read his name on the door-post among a score of others,
  and after a twenty-minutes' wait I returned to my rooms. I had no doubt that
  it was the meeting in the brougham that Hewitt wished reported, and I
  remembered his rule was never to watch a man a moment after the main object
  was secured.</p>

  <p>Hewitt was out, and he did not return till after dusk. Then he came
  straightway to my rooms.</p>

  <p>"Well, Brett," he said, "what's the report? As a matter of fact, Samuel is
  my client, as I shall explain presently. I don't like spying on a client, as
  a rule, but I was convinced that he was keeping something back from me, and
  there was something odd about his whole story. But what did you see?"</p>

  <p>I told Hewitt the tale of my pursuit as I have told it here. "I came
  away," I concluded, "after it seemed that he was settled in his office for a
  bit. But there is another thing you should know. When he first came out with
  you I recognised him at once as a man I had seen at that same door a little
  after two o'clock&mdash;say a quarter past."</p>

  <p>"Yes?" answered Hewitt. "I saw him there myself a little
  sooner&mdash;something like two, I should say. What was he doing?"</p>

  <p>"Well," I replied, "he was doing pretty well what he did in Manchester
  Square. For as a matter of fact the brougham also was here then&mdash;just
  outside the next-door office. I think I might swear to that same
  brougham&mdash;though of course I didn't notice it so particularly that first
  time."</p>

  <p>Hewitt whistled. "Oh!" he said. "Tell me about this. Did he get into the
  brougham this time?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. He came out of the office door with a black leather case in his hand
  and a very scared look on his face. And he popped into the brougham, leather
  case, scared look and all."</p>

  <p>"Ho&mdash;ho!" said Hewitt, thoughtfully, and whistled again. "A black
  leather case, eh! Come, come, the plot thickens. And what happened? Did the
  carriage go off?"</p>

  <p>"No; I saw nothing more&mdash;shouldn't have noticed so much, in fact, if
  the whole thing hadn't looked a trifle curious. Nervous, pallid Jew with a
  black case&mdash;as though he thought it was dynamite and might go off at any
  moment&mdash;closed brougham, blinds drawn, Jew skipped in and banged the
  door, but brougham didn't move; and I fancied&mdash;perhaps only
  fancied&mdash;that I saw a woman's black veil inside. But then I turned in
  here and saw no more."</p>

  <p>Hewitt sat thoughtfully silent for a few moments. Then he rose and said,
  "Come next door, and I'll tell you how we stand. The housekeeper will let us
  in, and we'll see if you can identify that black case anywhere."</p>

  <p>It seemed that Hewitt had by this established a good understanding with
  the housekeeper next door. "Nobody's been, sir," the man said, as he admitted
  us and closed the heavy doors. "Office boy not come back, nor nothing."</p>

  <p>We went up to Denson's office on the third floor, the door of which the
  housekeeper opened; and having turned on the electric light, he left us.</p>

  <p>"Now, is that anything like the case?" Hewitt asked, when the housekeeper
  was gone; and he lifted from under the table the very black case I had seen
  Samuel take into the brougham.</p>

  <p>I said that I felt as sure of the case as of the brougham. And then Hewitt
  told me the whole tale of Samuel and his loss of fifteen thousand pounds'
  worth of diamonds, just as it appears earlier in this narrative.</p>

  <p>"Now, see here," said Hewitt, when he had made me acquainted with his
  client's tale, "there is something odd about all this. See this post-card
  which Samuel gave me. It is from Denson, and it makes this morning's
  appointment. See! 'Be down below at eleven sharp' is the message. He came and
  he waited just two hours and a quarter, as he tells me, being certain to the
  time within five minutes. That brings, us to a quarter-past one&mdash;the
  time when he finds he is robbed; and he came downstairs in a very agitated
  state at a quarter-past one, as I have since ascertained. At two I pass and
  see him still dancing distractedly on the front steps&mdash;certainly very
  much like a man who has had a serious misfortune, or expects one. At a
  quarter-past two&mdash;that was about it, I think?" (I nodded) "At a
  quarter-past two you see him, still agitated, diving into the brougham with
  this black case in his hand; and a little afterward&mdash;after all this,
  mind&mdash;he tells me this story of a robbery of diamonds from that very
  case, and assures me that he sent for me the moment he discovered the
  loss&mdash;that is to say, at a quarter-past one, a positive lie&mdash;and
  has told nobody else. He further assures me that he has told me everything
  that has happened up to the moment he meets me. Then he goes away&mdash;to
  his office, as he tells me. But you find him posting to Manchester Square in
  a cab, and there once more plunging into that same mysterious closed
  brougham. Now why should he do that? He has seen the person in that brougham,
  presumably, an hour before, and there can be nothing more to communicate,
  except the result of his interview with me&mdash;a thing I warned him to keep
  to himself. It's odd, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"It is. What can be his motive?"</p>

  <p>"I want to know his motive. I object to working for a client who deceives
  me&mdash;indeed, it's unsafe. I may be making myself an accomplice in some
  criminal scheme. You observe that he never called for the police&mdash;a
  natural impulse in a robbed man. Indeed, he expressly vetoes all
  communication with the police."</p>

  <p>"Of course he gave reasons."</p>

  <p>"But the reasons are not good enough. I can't stop a man leaving this
  country anywhere round the coast except by going to the police."</p>

  <p>"Can it be," I suggested, "that Samuel and Denson are working in
  collusion, and have perhaps insured the stones, and now want your help to
  make out a case of loss?"</p>

  <p>"Scarcely that, I think, for more than one reason. First, it isn't a risk
  any insurer would take, in the circumstances. Next, the insurer would
  certainly want to know why the police were not informed at once. But there is
  more. I have not been idle this while, as you would know. I will tell you
  some of the things I have ascertained. To begin with, Samuel is known in
  Hatton Garden only as a dealer on a very small and peddling scale. A dabbler
  in commissions, in fact, rather than a buyer and seller of diamonds in
  quantities on his own account. His office is nothing but a desk in a small
  room he shares with two others&mdash;small dealers like himself. When I spoke
  to the people most likely to know, of his offering fifteen thousand pounds'
  worth of diamonds on his own account, they laughed. An investment of two or
  three hundred pounds in stones was about his limit, they said. Now that fact
  offers fresh suggestions, doesn't it?" Hewitt looked at me significantly.</p>

  <p>"You mean," I said after a little consideration, "that Samuel may have
  been entrusted with the diamonds to sell by the real owner, and has made all
  these arrangements with Denson to get the gems for themselves and represent
  them as stolen?"</p>

  <p>Hewitt nodded thoughtfully. "There's that possibility," he said. "Though
  even in that case the owner would certainly want to know why the police had
  not been told, and I don't know what satisfactory answer Samuel could make.
  And more, I find that no such robbery has been reported to any of the
  principal dealers in Hatton Garden to-day; and, so far as I can ascertain,
  none of them has entrusted Samuel with anything like so large a quantity of
  diamonds as he talks of&mdash;lately, at any rate."</p>

  <p>"Isn't it possible that the diamonds are purely imaginary?" I suggested.
  "Mightn't there be some trick played on that basis? Perhaps a trick on the
  American customer&mdash;if there was one."</p>

  <p>Hewitt was thoughtful. "There are many possibilities," he said, "which I
  must consider. The diamonds may even be stolen property to begin with; that
  would account for a great deal, though perhaps not all. But the whole thing
  is so oddly suspicious, that unless my client is willing to let me a great
  deal further into his confidence to-morrow morning I shall throw up the
  case."</p>

  <p>"Did you direct any inquiries after Denson?"</p>

  <p>"Of course; which brings me to the other things I have ascertained. He has
  not been here long&mdash;a few months. I cannot find that he has been doing
  any particular business all the time with anybody except Samuel. With him,
  however, he seems to have been very friendly. The housekeeper speaks of them
  as being 'very thick together.' The rooms are cheaply furnished, as you see.
  And here is another thing to consider. The housekeeper vows that he never
  left his glass box at the foot of the stairs from the time Samuel went
  upstairs first to the time when he came down again, vastly agitated, at a
  quarter-past one, and sent a message; and during all that time <i>Denson
  never passed the box</i>! And the main door is the only way out."</p>

  <p>"But wasn't he there at all?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, he was there, certainly, when Samuel came. But note, now. Observe
  the sequence of things as we know them now. First, there is Denson in his
  office; I can find nothing of any American visitor, and I am convinced that
  he is a total fiction, either of Denson's or Samuel and Denson together.
  Denson is in his office. To him comes Samuel. Neither leaves the place till
  Samuel comes down at a quarter-past one o'clock. I told you he sent some sort
  of message. The housekeeper tells me that he called a passing commissionaire
  and gave him something, though whether it was a telegram or a note he did not
  see; nor does he know the commissionaire, nor his number&mdash;though he
  could easily be found if it became necessary, no doubt. Samuel sends the
  message, and waits on the steps, watching, in an agitated manner (as would be
  natural, perhaps, in a man engaged in an anxious and ticklish piece of
  illegality) for an hour, when this mysterious brougham appears. He takes this
  black case into the brougham, and he obviously brings it out again, for here
  it is. Whatever has happened, he brings it out empty. Then he sends the
  housekeeper for me. When at length I arrive, Denson has certainly gone, but
  there was an opportunity for that while the housekeeper was absent on the
  message to my office&mdash;<i>after</i> all Samuel's agitation, and after he
  had carried his case to and from the brougham."</p>

  <p>"The whole thing is odd enough, certainly, and suspicious enough. Have you
  found anything else?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Denson lives, or lived, in a boarding house in Bloomsbury. He has
  only been there two months, however, and they know practically nothing of
  him. To-day he came home at an unusual time, letting himself in with his
  latchkey, and went away at once with a bag, but the accounts of the exact
  time are contradictory. One servant thought it was before twelve, and another
  insisted that it was after one. He has not been back."</p>

  <p>"And the office boy&mdash;can't you get some information out of him?"</p>

  <p>"He hasn't been seen since the morning. I expect Denson told him to take a
  whole holiday. I can't find where he lives, at the moment, but no doubt he
  will turn up to-morrow. Not that I expect to get much from him. But I shan't
  bother. Unless Mr. Samuel will answer satisfactorily some very plain
  questions I shall ask&mdash;and I don't expect he will&mdash;I shall throw up
  the commission. He called, by the way, not long ago, but I was out. We shall
  see him in the morning, I expect."</p>

  <p>A look round Denson's office taught me no more than it had taught Hewitt
  already. There were two small rooms, one inside the other, with ordinary and
  cheap office furniture. It was quite plain that any man of ordinary activity
  and size could have got out of the inner room into the corridor by the means
  which Samuel suggested&mdash;through the hinged wall-light, near the ceiling.
  Hewitt had meddled with nothing&mdash;he would do no more till he was
  satisfied of the <i>bonâ fides</i> of his client; certainly he would not
  commit himself to breaking open desks or cupboards. And so, the time for my
  attendance at the office approaching&mdash;I was working on the <i>Morning
  Ph[oe]nix</i> then, and ten at night saw my work begin&mdash;we shut Denson's
  office, and went away.</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">In the morning I was awakened by an impatient knocking at my
  bedroom door. Going to bed at two or three I was naturally a late riser, and
  this was about nine. I scrambled sleepily out of bed, and turned the key.
  Hewitt was standing in my sitting-room, with a newspaper in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Sorry to break your morning sleep, Brett," he said, "but something
  interesting has happened in regard to that business you helped me with
  yesterday, and you may like to know. Crawl back into bed if you like."</p>

  <p>But I was already in my dressing-gown, and groping for my clothes. "No,
  no, come in and tell me," I said. "What is it?"</p>

  <p>Hewitt sat on the bed. "I'll tell you in due order," he said. "First, I
  saw Samuel again last night&mdash;after you had gone away. You remember I
  went back to my office; I had a letter or two to write which I had set aside
  in the afternoon. Well, I wrote the letters, shut up, and went downstairs. I
  opened the outer door, and there was Samuel, in the act of ringing the
  housekeeper's bell. He said he was very anxious, and couldn't sleep without
  coming to hear if I had made any progress; he had called before, but I was
  out. I half thought of taking him back to my office, but decided that it
  wasn't worth while. So I walked along to the corner of the Strand, till I got
  him well under the lights. Then I stopped and talked to him. 'You ask about
  the progress in your case, Mr. Samuel,' I said. 'Now, I have sometimes met
  people who seem to consider me a sort of prophet, seer, or diviner. As a
  matter of fact, I am nothing but a professional investigator, and even if I
  were possessed of such an amazing genius as I lay no claim to, I could never
  succeed in a case, nor even make progress in it, if my client started me with
  false information, or only told me half the truth. More, when I find that
  such is the state of affairs, and that if I am to succeed I must begin by
  investigating my client before I proceed with his case, I throw that case up
  on the instant&mdash;invariably. Do you understand that? Now I must tell you
  that I have made no progress with your case, none; for that very
  reason.'"</p>

  <p>"He protested, of course&mdash;vowed he had told me the simple truth, and
  so forth. I replied by asking him certain definite questions. First, I asked
  him whose the diamonds were. He repeated that they were his own. To that I
  simply replied, 'Good evening, Mr. Samuel,' and turned away. He came after me
  beseechingly, and prevaricated. He said something about another party having
  an interest, but the matter being confidential. To that I responded by asking
  him with whom he had communicated before sending for me, and who was the
  person in the brougham which he had twice entered. That flabbergasted him. He
  said that he couldn't answer those questions without bringing other parties
  into the matter, to which I answered that it was just those other parties
  that I meant to know about, if I were to move a step in the matter. At this
  he got into a sad state&mdash;imploring, actually imploring, me not to desert
  him. He said he should do something desperate&mdash;something
  terrible&mdash;that night if I didn't relieve his mind, and undertake the
  case. What he meant he'd do I didn't know, of course, but it didn't move me.
  I said finally that I would deal only with principals, and that until I had
  the personal instructions of the actual owner of the diamonds, in addition to
  a complete explanation of the brougham incident, I should do nothing, and I
  recommended him to go to the police; and with that I left him."</p>

  <p>"And you got nothing more from him than that?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing more; but it was something, you see. He admitted, to all intents,
  that the diamonds were not his own. And now see here. I suppose I left him
  about ten o'clock. Here is a paragraph in one of this morning's newspapers.
  It is only in the one paper; the matter seems to have occurred rather late
  for press."</p>

  <p>Hewitt gave me the paper in his hand, pointing to the following
  paragraph:</p>

  <blockquote>
    "Horrible Discovery.&mdash;A shocking discovery was made just before
    midnight last night, near the York column, where a police-constable found
    the dead body of a man lying on the stone steps. The body, which was fully
    clothed in the ordinary dress of a labouring man, bore plain marks of
    strangulation, and it was evident that a brutal murder had been committed.
    A singular circumstance was the presence of a curious reddish mark upon the
    forehead, at first taken for a wound, but soon discovered to be a mark
    apparently drawn or impressed on the skin. At the time of going to press,
    no arrest had been made, and so far the affair appears a mystery."
  </blockquote>

  <p>"Well," I said, "this certainly seems curious, especially in the matter of
  the mark on the forehead. But what has it all to do&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"To do with Samuel and his diamonds, you mean? I'll tell you. <i>That dead
  man is Denson!</i>"</p>

  <p>"Denson?" I exclaimed. "Denson? How?"</p>

  <p>"I get it from the housekeeper next door. It seems that when the police
  came to examine the body they found, among other things&mdash;money and a
  watch, and the like&mdash;a piece of an addressed envelope, used to hold a
  few pins&mdash;the pins stuck in and the paper rolled up, you know. There was
  just enough of it to guess the address by&mdash;that of the office next door;
  and it was the only clue they had. So they came along here at once and
  knocked up the housekeeper. He went with them and instantly recognised
  Denson, disguised in labourer's clothes, but Denson, he says,
  unmistakably."</p>

  <p>"And the mark on the forehead?"</p>

  <p>"That is very odd. It is an outlined triangle, rather less than an inch
  along each side. It is quite red, he says, and seems to be done in a greasy,
  sticky sort of ink or colour."</p>

  <p>"Was anything found&mdash;the diamonds?"</p>

  <p>"No. He says there was money&mdash;two or three five-pound notes, I
  believe, some small change, a watch, keys and so forth; but there's not a
  word of diamonds."</p>

  <p>I paused in my dressing. "Does that mean that the murderer has got them?"
  I asked. Hewitt pursed his lips and shook his head. "It <i>may</i> mean
  that," he said, "but does it look altogether like it when five-pound notes
  are left? On the other hand, there is the disguise; the only reason that we
  know of for that would be that he was bolting with the diamonds. But the
  really puzzling thing is the mark on the forehead. Why that? Of course, the
  picturesque and romantic thing to suppose is that it is the mark of some
  criminal club or society. But criminal associations, such as exist, don't do
  silly things like that. When criminals rob and murder, they don't go leaving
  their tracks behind them purposely&mdash;they leave nothing that could
  possibly draw attention to them if they can help it; also, they don't leave
  five-pound notes. But I'm off to have a look at that mark. Inspector Plummer
  is in charge of the case&mdash;you remember Plummer, don't you, in the
  Stanway Cameo case, and two or three others? Well, Plummer is an old friend
  of mine, and not only am I interested in this matter myself, but now that it
  becomes a case of murder, I must tell the police all I know, merely as a
  loyal citizen. I've an idea they will want to ask our friend Mr. Samuel some
  very serious questions."</p>

  <p>"Will you go now?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I must waste no more time. You get your breakfast and look out for
  me, or for a message."</p>

  <p>Hewitt was off to Vine Street, and I devoted myself to my toilet and my
  breakfast, vastly mystified by this tragic turn in a matter already puzzling
  enough.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">It was not a messenger, but Hewitt himself, who came back in
  less than an hour. "Come," he said, "Plummer is below, and we are going next
  door, to Denson's office. I've an idea that we may get at something at last.
  The police are after Samuel hot-foot. They think he should be made sure of in
  any case without delay; and I must say they have some reason, on the face of
  it."</p>

  <p>We joined Plummer at once&mdash;I have already spoken of Plummer in my
  accounts of several of Hewitt's cases in which I met him&mdash;and we all
  turned into the office next door. There we found a very frightened and
  bewildered office boy, whom Denson had given a holiday yesterday, after
  sending him down to Samuel. He had come to his work as usual, only to meet
  the housekeeper's tale of the murder of his master and the end of his
  business prospects. He had little or no information to impart. He had only
  been employed for a month or six weeks, and during that time his work had
  been practically nothing.</p>

  <p>Plummer nodded at this information, and sniffed comprehensively at the
  office furniture. "I know this sort o' stuff," he said. "This is the way they
  fit up long firm offices and such. This place was taken for the job, that's
  plain, by one or both of 'em."</p>

  <p>The boy's address was taken, and he was given a final holiday, and asked
  to send up the housekeeper as he went out. Plummer passed Hewitt a bunch of
  keys.</p>

  <p>The housekeeper entered. "Now, Hutt," said Martin Hewitt, "you were saying
  yesterday, I think, that the main front door was the only entrance and exit
  for this building?"</p>

  <p>"That's so, sir&mdash;the only one as anybody can use, except me."</p>

  <p>"Oh! then there <i>is</i> another, then?"</p>

  <p>"Well, not exactly to say an entrance, sir. There's a small private door
  at the back into the court behind, but that's only opened to take in coals
  and such, and I always have the key. This house isn't like yours, sir; you
  have no back way into the court as we have. It's a convenience,
  sometimes."</p>

  <p>"Ah, I've no doubt. Do you happen to have the key with you?"</p>

  <p>"It's on the bunch hanging up in my box, sir. Shall I fetch it?"</p>

  <p>"I should like to see it, if you will."</p>

  <p>The housekeeper disappeared, and presently returned with a large bunch of
  keys.</p>

  <p>"This is the one, Mr. Hewitt," he explained, lifting it from among the
  rest.</p>

  <p>Hewitt examined it closely, and then placed beside it one from the bunch
  Plummer had given him. "It seems you're not the only person who ever had a
  key exactly like that, Hutt," he said. "See here&mdash;this was found in Mr.
  Denson's pocket."</p>

  <p>Plummer nodded sagaciously. "All in the plant," he said. "See&mdash;it's
  brand new; clean as a new pin, and file marks still on it."</p>

  <p>"Take us to this back door, Hutt," Hewitt pursued. "We'll try this key. Is
  there a back staircase?"</p>

  <p>There <i>was</i> a small back staircase, leading to the coal-cellars, and
  only used by servants. Down this we all went, and on a lower landing we
  stopped before a small door. Hewitt slipped the key in the lock and turned
  it. The door opened easily, and there before us was the little courtyard
  which I think I have mentioned in one of my other narratives&mdash;the
  courtyard with a narrow passage leading into the next street.</p>

  <p>Martin Hewitt seemed singularly excited. "See there," he said, "that is
  how Denson left the building without passing the housekeeper's box! And now
  I'm going to make another shot. See here. This key on Denson's bunch
  attracted my attention because of its noticeable newness compared with most
  of the others. <i>Most</i> of the others, I say, because there is one other
  just as bright&mdash;see! This small one. Now, Hutt, do you happen to have a
  key like that also?"</p>

  <p>Hutt turned the key over in his hand and glanced from it to his own bunch.
  "Why, yes, sir!" he said presently. "Yes, sir! It's the same as the key of
  the fire-hose cupboards!"</p>

  <p>"Does that key fit them all? How many fire-hose cupboards are there?"</p>

  <p>"Two on each floor, sir, one at each end, just against the mains. And one
  key fits the lot."</p>

  <p>"Show us the nearest to this door."</p>

  <p>A short, narrow passage led to the main ground-floor corridor, where a
  cupboard lettered "Fire Hose" stood next the main and its fittings. "We have
  to keep the hose-cupboards locked," the housekeeper explained apologetically,
  "'cause o' mischievous boys in the offices."</p>

  <p>This key fitted as well as the other. A long coil of brown leather hose
  hung within, and in a corner lay a piece of chamois leather evidently used
  for polishing the brass fittings. This Hewitt pulled aside, and there beneath
  it lay another and cleaner piece of chamois leather, neatly folded and tied
  round with cord. Hewitt snatched it up. He unfastened the cord; he unrolled
  the leather, which was sewn into a sort of bag or satchel; and when at last
  he spread wide the mouth of this satchel, light seemed to spring from out of
  it, for there lay a glittering heap of brilliants!</p>

  <p>"What!" cried Plummer, who first got his speech. "Diamonds! Samuel's
  diamonds!"</p>

  <p><a id="pic4"
     name="pic4"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1403201h-images/Triangle-1-4.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>"Diamonds, at any rate," replied Hewitt, "whether Samuel's or somebody
  else's. But they can't have been there long. How often is this cupboard
  opened?"</p>

  <p>"Every Saturday reg'lar, sir," replied the housekeeper; "just to dust it
  out and see things is right."</p>

  <p>"Now, see here!" said Martin Hewitt, "I've had luck in my conjectures as
  yet, and I'll try again. Here is what I believe has happened. Every word that
  Samuel told me about the theft of those diamonds was true, except as to their
  ownership. Denson has planned all along to rob him of as big a collection of
  diamonds as he could prompt him to get together, and he has played up to this
  for months. His smaller dealings one way and another were ground-bait. Very
  artfully he let Samuel take the diamonds safely away once, in order that he
  should be less watchful and less suspicious the second time. This second time
  he does the trick exactly as we see. He hangs up the imaginary American's
  hat, he escapes by the fanlight, and he goes out by the back way to avoid the
  housekeeper's observation. He has arranged beforehand for this, too. He has
  seized an opportunity when the housekeeper has been out of his box to get wax
  impressions of these two keys, and he has made copies of them. And here we
  come on a curious thing. It is easy enough to understand why he should
  foresee and get himself a key for the back door, in order to make his escape.
  But why the key of the hose-cupboard? Why, indeed, should he leave the
  diamonds behind him at all? It is plain that he meant to come back for
  them&mdash;probably at night. He would have been wholly free from observation
  in that quiet courtyard, and he could let himself in, get the diamonds, and
  leave again without exciting the smallest alarm or suspicion. But why take
  all the trouble? Why not stick to the plunder from the beginning? The plain
  inference is that he feared somebody or something. He feared being stopped
  and searched, or he feared being waylaid <i>sometime during yesterday</i>. By
  whom? There's the puzzle, and I can't see the bottom of it, I confess. If I
  could, perhaps I might know something of last night's murder.</p>

  <p>"As to Samuel's prevarications, there is only one explanation that will
  fit, now that the rest is made clear. He must have been entrusted with these
  diamonds by a private owner, for sale&mdash;secretly. Some lady of
  conspicuous position in difficulties, probably&mdash;perhaps unknown to her
  husband. Such things occur every day. A common expedient is to sell the
  stones and have good paste substituted, in the same settings. Samuel would be
  just the man to carry through a transaction of that sort. That would account
  for everything. The jewels are <i>en suite</i>, cut, but unset&mdash;taken
  from a set of jewellery, and paste substituted. Samuel arranges it all for
  the lady, finds a customer&mdash;Denson&mdash;who treats him exactly as he
  has told us. When he realises the loss Samuel doesn't know what to do. He
  mustn't call the police, being bound to secrecy on the lady's behalf. He
  sends her a hasty message, and remains keeping watch by Denson's office. She
  hurries to him with all possible secrecy, keeping her carriage blinds down;
  he dashes into the brougham to describe the disaster, taking his case with
  him in his frantic desire to explain things fully. The lady fears publicity,
  and won't hear of the police&mdash;she instructs him to consult me: and
  consequently, of course, when I recommend communicating with the police he
  won't listen to the suggestion. Samuel has arranged with the lady to hurry
  off and report progress as soon as he has consulted me, and this he does, the
  lady having appointed Manchester Square for the interview. Perhaps she hints
  some suspicion of Samuel's honesty&mdash;rather natural, perhaps, in the
  circumstances. That terrifies him more than ever, and leads to his frantic
  appeals to me when I throw the case up. Come, there's my guess at the facts
  of the case, and I'll back it with twopence and a bit more. Eh, Plummer?"</p>

  <p>"I don't take your bet," answered Plummer. "The thing's plain enough;
  except the murder. There's something deeper there."</p>

  <p>Hewitt became grave. "That's true," he said, "and something I can see no
  way into, as yet. But come&mdash;you take this parcel of diamonds, as
  representing the law. And here comes one of your men, I think."</p>

  <p>We had been approaching the front door during this talk, and now a police
  constable appeared, and saluted Plummer. "Samuel's just been brought in,
  sir," he reported. "He's half dead with fright, and he's sent a message to
  Lady H&mdash;&mdash; in P&mdash;&mdash; Square; and he says he wants Mr.
  Martin Hewitt to come and speak for him."</p>

  <p>"Poor Samuel!" Hewitt commented. "Come, we'll go and make him happy. Here
  are the diamonds, and, those safely accounted for, there's no evidence to
  connect him with the murder. We'll get him out of the mess as soon as
  possible."</p>

  <p>And so they did. Hewitt's reading of the case was correct to a tittle, as
  it turned out, and with very little delay Samuel was released. But with the
  message from the police station, the fat was in the fire as regarded Lady
  H&mdash;&mdash;. Her husband necessarily became acquainted with everything,
  and there was serious domestic trouble.</p>

  <p>Samuel was glad enough to get quit of the business with no worse than a
  bad fright, as may well be supposed. He showed himself most grateful to
  Hewitt in after times, giving him excellent confidential advice and
  information more than once in matters connected with the diamond trade. He is
  still in business, I believe, in a much larger way, and I have no doubt he is
  the wiser for his experience, and for the lesson which Hewitt did not forget
  to rub well in: that it is useless and worse to place a confidential matter
  in the hands of a man of Hewitt's profession, and at the same time withhold
  particulars of the case, however unessential they may appear to be.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">But meantime, on the way to Vine Street I asked Hewitt what
  led him to suppose that the new key on Denson's bunch fitted a lock in that
  particular office building.</p>

  <p>"Call it a lucky guess, if you like," Hewitt answered; "but as a matter of
  fact it was prompted by pure common sense. Plummer showed me the things found
  on the body, and I saw at once that the keys offered the only chance of
  immediate information. I went through them one by one. There was his
  latchkey&mdash;the key with which he had gone into his lodgings to fetch away
  the disguise. There was another largish key, equally old&mdash;probably the
  key of his office door. There were other smaller keys, also old&mdash;plainly
  belonging to bags and trunks and drawers and so forth. And then there was the
  large, perfectly new key. What was that? It was not the key of any bag or
  drawer, clearly&mdash;it was the key of a door&mdash;a door with a lever
  lock. What door? Had Denson some other office? Perhaps he had, but first it
  was best to begin by trying it on places we were already acquainted with. At
  once I thought of Denson's disappearance unobserved by the housekeeper. Could
  this be the key of some private exit from the office building? I resolved to
  test that conjecture first, and it turned out to be the right one. Being
  successful so far, of course I turned to the other new key and tried that, as
  you saw."</p>

  <p>"But what of that triangular mark on the man's forehead?"</p>

  <p>Martin Hewitt became deeply thoughtful. "That," he said, "is a matter
  wholly beyond me at present, as indeed is the whole business of the murder.
  Whether we shall ever know more I can't guess, but the matter is
  deep&mdash;deep and difficult and dark. As to the mark itself, that seems to
  have been impressed from an engraved stamp of some sort. It is a plain
  equilateral triangle in red outline, measuring about an inch on each side. It
  is in a greasy, sticky sort of red ink, which may be smeared, but is very
  difficult, if not impossible, to rub away. What it means I can't at present
  conjecture. I have told you my reasons for not thinking it the sign of any
  gang of criminals. But whose sign is it? Surely not that of some
  self-constituted punisher of crime? For such a person, with no risk to
  himself, could have handed Denson over to the police, if he knew of his
  offence. Can he have been murdered by an accomplice? But he used no
  accomplice; if one thing is plain in all that story of the stolen diamonds it
  is that Denson did the thing wholly by himself. Besides, an accomplice would
  have taken the keys and have gone and secured the diamonds for himself; else
  why the murder at all? But no keys were taken&mdash;nothing was taken, as far
  as we can tell. And why was the body placed in that conspicuous position? It
  is pretty certain that the crime cannot have happened where the body was
  found&mdash;somebody must have heard or seen a struggle in such a place as
  that. As it is, I should say, the body was probably brought quietly to the
  spot in a cab, or some such conveyance.</p>

  <p>"But mystery envelops this crime everywhere. So far as I can see, there is
  no clue whatever beyond the Red Triangle, which, as yet, I cannot understand.
  The strangling points to the murder being committed by a powerful man,
  certainly, and it is a form of crime that may have been perpetrated silently.
  But beyond that I can see nothing. The apparent motivelessness of the thing
  makes the mystery all the darker, and the circumstances we are acquainted
  with, instead of helping us, seem to complicate the puzzle.</p>

  <p>"What was it that Denson feared when he left those diamonds behind him,
  when he might have carried them away? And why should he fear it in daytime
  and not at night, since it would seem plain that he meant to have returned
  for the stones at night? Where did he go to disguise himself
  yesterday&mdash;we know it was not in his lodgings&mdash;and where has he
  left the clothes he discarded?"</p>

  <p>All these doubts and mysteries were destined to be cleared up, in more or
  less degree; but it was not till Hewitt and I had witnessed other singular
  adventures that the answer came to the problem, the real meaning of the Red
  Triangle was made apparent, and its connection with the theft of Samuel's
  diamonds grew clear. For indeed the connection proved in the end to be very
  intimate indeed. Once, a little later, we were allowed to see a shade farther
  into the mystery, as I shall tell in the proper place; but even then the real
  secret remained hidden from us till the appointed end.</p>

  <p>So ended the case of Samuel's diamonds, so far as concerned Samuel himself
  and the owner; but the case of the Red Triangle had only begun.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="story2"
     name="story2"></a>II. &mdash; THE CASE OF MR. JACOB MASON</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Harmsworth London Magazine</i>, Dec 1902</h3>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">THE mystery of Denson's death remained a mystery, despite
  all the police could do. The coroner's jury returned a verdict of "Murder by
  some person or persons unknown"&mdash;which, indeed, was all that could be
  expected of them; for they had no more before them than the bare fact that
  the body, disguised in the clothes of a labourer, had been found on the steps
  near the Duke of York's column, just before midnight, by a police constable.
  But for the housekeeper's identification, even the name of the victim would
  have been unknown. The jury certainly wasted some time in idle speculation as
  to the strange triangular mark found on the forehead, without a speck of
  evidence to help them; but in the end they returned their verdict, and went
  home.</p>

  <p>But the police knew a little more than the jury, though that little rather
  confused than helped them. They exercised their judgment at the inquest in
  withholding all evidence of the theft of diamonds on which the victim had
  been engaged, the curious particulars of which I have already related. In
  this they followed their usual course in cases where the evidence withheld
  could give the jury no help in arriving at their verdict, and at the same
  time might easily hamper further investigations if revealed. For the theft
  had been frustrated by Martin Hewitt's exertions, as we have seen, and in any
  case the thief was now dead and beyond the reach of human punishment. The one
  matter now remaining for the police was inquiry into the murder of this same
  thief, and the one object of their exertions the apprehension of the murderer
  or murderers.</p>

  <p>The case, as I have already said, was in the hands of Inspector Plummer,
  an intelligent officer and an old friend of Hewitt's. A few days' work after
  the inquest yielded Plummer so little result that he called at Hewitt's
  office to talk matters over.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," Plummer began, "it's no use asking if you've heard anything
  more of that matter of Denson's murder?"</p>

  <p>Hewitt shook his head. "I haven't heard a word," he said. "If I had, it
  would have come on to you at once. But I hope you've had some luck
  yourself?"</p>

  <p>"Not a scrap; time wasted; and the few off-chance clues I tried have led
  nowhere, so that I'm where I was at the start. The thing is quite the oddest
  in all my experience. See how we stand. Here's a man, Denson, who has just
  pulled off one of the cleverest jewel robberies ever attempted. He so
  arranges it that he walks safely off with fifteen thousand pounds' worth of
  diamonds, leaving the victim, Samuel, stuck patiently in an office for an
  hour or two before he even begins to suspect anything is wrong, and
  <i>then</i> unable to set the police after him, for the reasons you
  discovered. But this Denson doesn't carry the plunder off straightway, as he
  so easily might have done&mdash;he conceals it in the very house where the
  robbery was committed, taking with him a key by aid of which he may return
  and get it. Why? As you explained, it was probably because he feared
  somebody&mdash;feared being stopped and searched <i>on the day of the
  robbery</i>&mdash;not after, since it was plain he meant to return for his
  booty at night. Who could this have been, and why did Denson fear him?
  Mystery number one. Then this Denson is found dead that same night disguised
  in the clothes of a labourer, in a most conspicuous spot in London&mdash;the
  last place in the world one would expect a murderer to select for depositing
  his victim's body, for it is evidently <i>not</i> the place where the murder
  was committed. More, on the forehead there is this extraordinary impressed
  mark of a Red Triangle. Now, what can all that mean? Robbery, perhaps one
  thinks. But the body isn't robbed! There are three five-pound notes on it,
  besides a sovereign or two and some small change, a watch and chain, keys and
  all the rest of it. Then one guesses at the diamonds. Perhaps it was an
  accomplice in the robbery, who finds that Denson is about to bolt with the
  whole lot. But if there's one thing plain in this amazing business it is that
  Denson <i>had</i> no accomplice; he did the whole thing alone, as you
  discovered, and he needed no help. More than that, if this were the work of
  an accomplice why didn't he get the jewels? There were the keys to his hand
  and he left them! And would such a person actually go out of his way to put
  the body where it must be discovered at once, instead of concealing it till
  he could himself get away with the diamonds? Of course not. But there was no
  accomplice, and it's useless to labour that farther. All these arguments
  apply equally against the theory that it was the work of some criminal gang.
  They would have taken all they could get, notes, keys, diamonds and all, and
  they wouldn't have been so foolish as to exhibit the body with that
  extraordinary mark; criminal gangs are not such fools as to take unnecessary
  chances and gratuitously leave tracks behind them, as you know well enough.
  Well then, there we stand. So far, do you see any more in it than I do?"</p>

  <p>Hewitt shook his head. "No," he said, "I can't say I do. All the
  considerations you have mentioned have already occurred to me. I talked them
  over, in fact, with my friend Brett. My connection with the case ceased, of
  course, with the discovery of the jewels, and about the murder I know no more
  than has been told me. I never saw the body, and so had no opportunity of
  picking up any overlooked clue; though doubtless you have seen to that. I
  know not a tittle more than you have just summarised, and on that alone the
  thing seems mystery pure and unadulterated."</p>

  <p>"All there is beyond that was ascertained by the divisional surgeon on
  examination of the body. The man died from strangulation, as you know, and
  the natural presumption from that was that the murderer must have been a
  powerful man. But the surgeon is of the positive opinion&mdash;he is certain,
  in fact&mdash;that Denson was strangled with an instrument&mdash;a
  tourniquet."</p>

  <p>"A tourniquet?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, a surgeon's tourniquet, such as is used to compress a leg or arm and
  so stop a flow of blood. He considers the marks unmistakable. Now that might
  point to the murderer being a medical man."</p>

  <p>"Conjecturally, yes; though, of course, it justifies nothing more than
  conjecture."</p>

  <p>"Precisely. Well, that was something, but precious little. A tourniquet is
  a common thing enough&mdash;no more than a band with screw fittings, and
  there was nothing to show that the tourniquet used was any different from a
  thousand others; and I can see no particular reason why a doctor should
  commit a murder like this any more than any other man; in which the
  divisional surgeon agreed with me. And doctor or none, that Red Triangle was
  altogether unaccounted for. About that, too, by the way, the divisional
  surgeon told me a little, but a very useless little. The mark was not
  properly dried, owing to its slightly greasy nature, and although it was
  almost impossible to remove it wholly, it <i>was</i> possible to scrape off a
  little of the ink, or colour. Here is a little of it on a paper&mdash;quite
  dried now, of course."</p>

  <p>Plummer carefully took from his pocket a small folded paper, unfolded it,
  and revealed a smaller paper within. On this were two little smears of a
  bright red colour. "There&mdash;that's the stuff," he said. "The surgeon
  examined it, and he reports it to be rather oddly constituted&mdash;so as to
  bear some affinity of meaning, possibly, to the triangle. For the stuff is a
  compound of three substances&mdash;animal, vegetable and mineral; there is a
  fine vegetable oil, he says, some waxy preparation, certainly of animal
  origin, and a mineral&mdash;cinnabar: vermilion, in fact. But though there
  <i>may</i> be some connection between the triangle and the substances
  representing the three natural kingdoms, it gives nothing
  practical&mdash;nothing to go on."</p>

  <p>Martin Hewitt had been closely examining the marks on the paper, and now
  he answered, "I'm not so sure of that, though, Plummer. I think at least that
  it gives us another conjecture. I should guess that the man you want, as well
  as being acquainted with the use of the tourniquet, has at some time
  travelled in, or to, China."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Unless I am wider of the mark than usual, this is the pigment used on
  Chinese seals. A Chinaman's seal acts for his signature on all sorts of
  documents; it is impressed or printed by hand pressure from a little engraved
  stone die, precisely as this triangle seems to have been, and the ink or
  colour is almost always red, compounded of vermilion, wax, and oil of
  sesamum."</p>

  <p>Plummer sat up with a whistle. "Phew! Then it may have been done by a
  Chinaman!"</p>

  <p>Hewitt shrugged his shoulders. "It's possible," he said; "of course,
  though, the sign, the triangle, is not a Chinese character. As a character,
  of course it is the Greek <i>Delta</i>. But it may be no character at all. In
  the signs of the ancient Cabala, the triangle, apex upward as it was in this
  case, was the symbol of fire; apex downward, it signified water."</p>

  <p>Plummer patted the side of his head distractedly. "Heavens!" he said,
  "don't tell me I'm to search all China, and Greece, and&mdash;wherever the
  cabalistic pundits come from!"</p>

  <p>"Well, no," Hewitt answered with a smile. "I think I should, at any rate,
  begin in this country. I rather think you might make a beginning at Denson.
  That is what I should do if the case were mine. See if anything can be
  ascertained of his previous life&mdash;probably under another name or names.
  <i>He</i> may have been in China. Yes, certainly, as we stand at present, I
  should begin at Denson."</p>

  <p>"I think I will," the inspector replied, "though there's precious little
  to begin on there. I'd like to have you with me on this job, but, of course,
  that's impossible, since it's purely a police matter. But something, some
  information, may come your way, and in that case you'll let me know at once,
  of course."</p>

  <p>"Of course I shall&mdash;it's a serious matter, as well as a strange one.
  I wish you all luck!"</p>

  <p>Plummer departed to grapple with his difficulties, but in fact it was
  Hewitt who first heard fresh news of the Red Triangle, and that from a wholly
  unexpected quarter.</p>

  <p>It was, indeed, only two days after Plummer's visit that Kerrett brought
  into Hewitt's private room the card of the Rev. James Potswood, with a
  request for a consultation. Mr. Potswood's name was known to Hewitt, as,
  indeed, it was to many people, as that of a most devoted clergyman, rector of
  a large parish in north-west London, who devoted not only all his time and
  personal strength to his work, but also spent every penny of his private
  income on his parish. It was not a small income that Mr. Potswood spent in
  this unselfish way, for he came of a wealthy family, and though a good part
  of his parish was inhabited by well-to-do people, there was quite enough
  poverty and distress in the poorer quarters to cause this excellent man often
  to regret that his resources were not even larger. He was a spare active
  grey-whiskered man of nearly sixty, with prominent and not very handsome
  features, though his face was full of frank and simple kindliness.</p>

  <p>"My errand, Mr. Hewitt," he said, "is of a rather vague, not to say
  visionary, character, and I doubt if you can help me. But at any rate I will
  explain the trouble as well as I can. In the first place, am I right in
  supposing that you were in some way professionally engaged in connection with
  that extraordinary case of murder a week or so ago&mdash;the case in which a
  man named Denson was found dead on the steps by the Duke of York's
  column?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;and no," Hewitt answered. "I was professionally engaged on a
  certain matter about which you will not wish me to particularise&mdash;since
  it is the business of a client&mdash;and in course of it I came upon the
  other affair."</p>

  <p>"Then before I ask what you know of that mysterious event, Mr. Hewitt, I
  will tell you my story, so that you may judge whether you are able to reveal
  anything, or to do anything. Of course, what I say is in the strictest
  confidence."</p>

  <p>"Of course."</p>

  <p>"I have a parishioner, a Mr. Jacob Mason, of whom I have seen very little
  of late years&mdash;scarcely anything at all, in fact, till a few days ago.
  He is fairly well to do, I believe, living a somewhat retired life in a house
  not far from my rectory. For many years he has laboured at natural
  science&mdash;chemistry in particular&mdash;and he has a very excellently
  fitted laboratory attached to his house. He is a widower, with no children of
  his own, but his orphan niece, a Miss Creswick, lives under his guardianship.
  Mr. Mason was never a very regular church-goer, but years ago I saw much more
  of him than I have of late. I must be perfectly frank with you, Mr. Hewitt,
  if you are to help me, and therefore I must tell you that we disagreed on
  points of religion, in such a way that I found it difficult to maintain my
  former regard for Mr. Mason. He had a curiously fantastic mind, and he was
  constantly being led to tamper with things that I think are best left
  alone&mdash;what is called spiritualism, for instance, and that horrible form
  of modern superstition which we hear whispers of at times from the
  Continent&mdash;the alleged devil-propitiation or worship. It was not that he
  did anything I thought morally wrong, you understand&mdash;except that he
  dabbled. And he was always running after some new thing&mdash;animal
  magnetism, or telepathy, or crystal-gazing, or theosophy, or some one of the
  score of such things that have an attraction for a mind of that sort. And it
  was a characteristic of each new enthusiasm with him that it prompted him to
  try to convert <i>me</i>; and that in such terms&mdash;terms often applied to
  the doctrines of that religion of which I am a humble minister&mdash;as I
  could in nowise permit in my presence. So that our friendly intercourse,
  though not interrupted by any definite breaking off, fell away to almost
  nothing. For which reason I was a little surprised to receive a visit from
  Mr. Mason on the afternoon of the day on which the newspapers printed the
  report of the finding of the body of Denson. You may remember that only one
  morning paper mentioned the matter, and that very briefly; but there were
  full reports in all the evening papers."</p>

  <p>"Yes, the discovery was made very late the previous night."</p>

  <p>"So I gathered. Well, I was told that Mr. Mason had been shown into my
  study, and there I found him. He was in an extremely nervous and agitated
  state, and he had an evening paper in his hand. With scarcely a preliminary
  word he burst out, 'Have you seen this in the paper? This&mdash;this murder?
  There&mdash;there's the report.' And he thrust the paper into my hands.</p>

  <p>"I had not seen or heard anything of the matter, in fact, till that
  moment, and now he gave me little leisure to read the report. He walked up
  and down the room, nervously clasping his hands, sometimes together,
  sometimes at his sides, sometimes before him, shaking his head in a
  shuddering sort of way, and bursting out once or twice as though the words
  were uncontrollable, 'What ought I to do? What <i>can</i> I do?'</p>

  <p>"I looked up from the paper, and he went on, 'Have you read it? It's a
  murder&mdash;a horrid murder. The poor wretched fellow was trying to escape,
  but he couldn't. It's a murder!'</p>

  <p>"'It certainly seems so,' I said. 'But what&mdash;did you know this man,
  Denson?'</p>

  <p>"'No, of course not,' Mason replied, 'but there it is, plain enough, and
  here's another paper with just the same report, but a little shorter.' He
  pulled the second paper from his pocket. 'I got what different papers I
  could, but these are the two fullest. It's plain enough it's a brutal murder,
  isn't it? And the man was a merchant, or an agent, or something, in
  Portsmouth Street, but he was found in labourer's clothes&mdash;proof that he
  feared it and was trying to escape it; but he couldn't&mdash;he
  couldn't&mdash;no! nor anybody. It's awful, awful!'</p>

  <p>"'But I don't understand,' I said. 'Won't you sit down?' For Mason
  continued to pace distractedly about the room. 'What is it you think this
  unfortunate man was trying to escape? And what am I to do in the matter?'</p>

  <p>"He stopped, pressed both hands to his head, and seemed to control himself
  by a great effort. 'You must excuse me,' he said. 'I'm a bit run down lately,
  and my nerves are all wrong. I'm talking rather wildly, I'm afraid. I really
  hardly know why I came to you, except that I haven't a soul I can talk to
  about&mdash;well, about anything, scarcely.'</p>

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>"He took a chair, and sat for a little while with his head forward on his
  hand and his eyes directed towards the floor. Then he said, in a musing way,
  rather as though he was thinking aloud than talking to me, 'You were right,
  after all, Potswood, and I was a fool to disregard your warnings. I oughtn't
  to have dabbled&mdash;I should have left those things alone.'</p>

  <p>"I said nothing, thinking it best not to disturb him, but to leave him
  free to say what he wanted to say in his own way. He remained quiet for a
  minute or two more, and then sat up with an appearance of much greater
  composure. 'You mustn't mind me, Potswood,' he said. 'As I've told you, I'm
  in a bad state of nerves, and at best I'm an impulsive sort of person, as you
  know. I needn't have bothered you like this&mdash;I came rushing round here
  without thinking, and if the house had been a bit farther off I should have
  come to my senses before I reached you. After all, there's nothing so much to
  disturb one's-self about, and this man&mdash;this Denson&mdash;may very well
  have deserved his fate. Don't you think that likely?'</p>

  <p>"He added this last question with an involuntary eagerness that scarcely
  accorded with the indifferent tone with which he had begun. I answered
  guardedly. I said of course nobody could say what the unhappy man's sins
  might have been, but that whatever they were they could never justify the
  fearful sin of murder. 'And,' I added, 'if you know anything of the matter,
  Mason, or have the smallest suspicion as to who is the guilty person, I'm
  sure you won't hesitate in your duty.'</p>

  <p>"'My duty?' he said. 'Oh yes, of course; my duty. You mean, of course,
  that any law-abiding citizen who knows of evidence should bring it out. Just
  so. Of course <i>I</i> haven't any evidence&mdash;that paper gave me the
  first news of the thing.'</p>

  <p>"'I think,' I rejoined, 'that anybody who was possessed of even less than
  evidence&mdash;of any suspicion which might lead to evidence&mdash;should go
  at once and place the authorities in possession of all he knows or
  suspects.'</p>

  <p>"'Yes,' he said&mdash;very calmly now, though it seemed at cost of a great
  effort&mdash;'so he should; so he should, no doubt, in any ordinary case. But
  sometimes there are difficulties, you know&mdash;great difficulties.' He
  stopped and looked at me furtively and uneasily. 'A man might fear for his
  own safety&mdash;he might even know that to say what he knew would be to
  condemn himself to sudden death; and more, perhaps, more. Suppose&mdash;it
  might be, you know&mdash;suppose, for instance, a man was placed between the
  alternatives of neglecting this duty and of breaking a&mdash;well an oath, a
  binding oath of a very serious&mdash;terrible&mdash;character? An oath, we
  will say, made previously, without any foreknowledge of the crime?'</p>

  <p>"I said that any such oath taken without foreknowledge of the crime could
  not have contemplated such an event, and that however wrong the taking of
  such an oath might have been in itself, to assist in concealing such a crime
  as this murder was infinitely worse&mdash;infinitely worse than taking the
  oath, and infinitely worse than breaking it. Though as to the latter, I
  repeated that any such engagement made without contemplation or foreknowledge
  of such a crime would seem to be void in that respect. I went
  further&mdash;much further. I conjured him to make no secret of anything he
  might know, and not to burden his conscience with complicity&mdash;for that
  was what concealment would amount to&mdash;in such a terrible crime. I added
  some further exhortations which I need not repeat now, and presently his
  assumed calmness departed utterly, and he became even more agitated than when
  first he came. He would say nothing further, however, and in the end he went
  away, saying he would 'think over the matter very seriously.'</p>

  <p>"It was quite plain to me that my poor friend was suffering acutely from
  the burden of some terrible secret, and that in his impulsive way he had
  rushed to confide in me at the first shock of the news of this murder, and
  that afterwards his courage had failed him. But I conceived it my duty not to
  allow such a matter to stand thus. Therefore, giving Mason a few hours for
  calm consideration, I called on him in the evening. I was told that he was
  not very well and had gone to bed; he had, however, left a message, in case I
  should call, to the effect that he would come and see me in the morning. I
  waited the whole of that next morning and the whole of the afternoon, and saw
  nothing of him. In the evening urgent parish work took me away, but next
  morning I called again at Mason's house and saw him. This time he avoided the
  subject&mdash;tried to dodge it, in fact. But I was not to be denied, and the
  result was another scene of alternate agitation and forced calmness. I will
  not weary you, Mr. Hewitt, with useless repetition, but I may say that I have
  seen Mason twice since then without bringing him to any definite resolve. As
  a matter of fact, I believe that he is restrained from saying anything
  further by fear&mdash;sheer terror. He has even gone so far as to deny
  absolutely that he knows anything of the matter&mdash;and then has
  contradicted himself a minute afterwards. At last, this morning, I have
  brought him a degree further. In the last few days I made it my business to
  acquaint myself, as far as possible, with the exact circumstances of the
  tragedy, so far as they are known, and in course of my inquiries I saw the
  housekeeper of the offices next door&mdash;the man who identified the body as
  Denson's. He either could not, or would not, tell me very much, but he
  <i>did</i> say that you had been working in some way in connection with the
  case, and that you knew as much of it as anybody. That gave me an idea. This
  morning I told Mason that not only he, but I also had a duty in respect to
  this matter, and my duty was to see that nothing in connection with such a
  crime as this should be hushed up on any consideration or for anybody's
  fancies. I said that if he liked he need tell me no more, but might take
  <i>you</i> into consultation professionally, as your client, allowing me
  first to see you and to assure you that, consistently with his own safety, he
  was anxious to further the ends of justice. I said that, as your client, your
  first duty would be to protect him, that your professional practice would
  keep your mouth absolutely sealed, and that you already knew a good deal
  about the crime&mdash;perhaps more than he suspected. I protested that this
  seemed to me the very least he could do, and I warned him that if he refused
  to do even this, I should have to consider whether it was consistent with my
  character, as a clergyman and a loyal citizen, any longer to conceal the fact
  that he was keeping back information that might lead to the apprehension of
  the murderer. This frightened him, and between the fear of the threat and the
  fear that you might already know more than he suspected, he authorised
  me&mdash;he was even eager about it&mdash;to come and see you; always, of
  course, under a pledge of strict professional secrecy."</p>

  <p>"So far your account is quite clear, Mr. Potswood," Hewitt said. "You have
  done your best, now I must do mine. You wish me to see Mason at once, no
  doubt?"</p>

  <p>"I arranged to bring you to his house, if you were willing and your
  engagements permitted, at three this afternoon. Will that do? I have been
  keeping you, I see&mdash;it is past one already. Will you lunch with me at my
  club?"</p>

  <p>"With great pleasure&mdash;more especially as I have a few questions to
  ask as we go along. Is it far?"</p>

  <p>"Just at this end of Pall Mall&mdash;we will walk, if you like."</p>

  <p>"Tell me now," said Hewitt as they went, "anything you know about Mr.
  Mason's habits, family connections, and so forth, as fully and as minutely as
  you please. Has he any friends connected with China, for instance?"</p>

  <p>"China? Why, no, I think not; except&mdash;but I'll tell you all I know.
  Mr. Mason has no family connections, so far as I am aware&mdash;at any rate,
  in London&mdash;except his niece, Miss Creswick. She is within a few months
  of twenty-one, a charming girl, but horribly shut in, for Mason has almost no
  visitors. Miss Creswick was his sister's daughter; she lost her mother first
  and then her father, and was left to the guardianship of her uncle. He was
  also trustee under the will, and he has, I believe, discretion to keep charge
  of her property, if he thinks fit, till she reaches the age of twenty-five;
  though in case of his death she is to inherit in the ordinary way, on coming
  of age. She is a very dutiful and, indeed, an affectionate niece; though I
  must say he is scarcely fair to her, keeping her, as he does, so completely
  secluded from the society of young people of her own age. Mere
  thoughtlessness, I think; he has had no children of his own, his mind is
  wholly occupied with his science and his fads, and he makes himself a recluse
  without a thought of the girl. And that brings me to what I was about to say
  at first, when you asked me if Mr. Mason had any friends connected with
  China. There is a young doctor&mdash;Lawson is his name&mdash;some very
  distant connection of the family, I think, who had a professional appointment
  of some sort in Shanghai for a year or two, but who is now in London trying
  to work up a small practice of his own. If you hadn't mentioned China I
  shouldn't have thought of him, since he never goes to the house now&mdash;or,
  at any rate, is supposed not to go."</p>

  <p>"Doesn't go to the house? And why is that?"</p>

  <p>"Well, there was a disagreement. What it was I don't quite know, but in
  the first place it had some connection with some of Mason's
  experiments&mdash;something which Lawson declined to help him with for
  professional reasons, or else something he declined to do for Lawson, I don't
  know which. But the thing went further, for, as a matter of fact, there was
  something between the young people&mdash;Lawson is only
  twenty-eight&mdash;and Mason put an end to that. It had been something like a
  formal engagement, I think, but in the quarrel&mdash;Mason was always
  quarrelling with somebody when he <i>had</i> friends, and that's why he has
  so few now&mdash;in the quarrel things were said that ended in a rupture.
  Whether young Lawson was fortune-hunting or not I cannot say, but Mason
  certainly accused him of it, and promised to keep back the girl's money as
  long as he could. In the meantime Mason declared an end to the engagement,
  and poor Helen was broken-hearted; for as I have said, she is an affectionate
  girl, and she hadn't a friend to confide in. But I'm boring you&mdash;you
  don't want to know all these things, surely?"</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, I can't possibly know too much, and the particulars
  can't possibly be too minute. Nine cases out of ten I bring to an issue by
  means of a triviality. You were saying a little while back that there were
  almost <i>no</i> visitors at Mr. Mason's house; but you said 'almost,' and
  that means there are some. Who are they?"</p>

  <p>"Very occasionally&mdash;rarely, in fact&mdash;there are one or two
  members of learned societies with whom he had been in correspondence, or who
  are old friends. There is a Professor Hutton and a Dr. Burge, I believe; but
  they don't appear once in six months; and there is Mr. Everard Myatt, who is
  more frequent. He does not profess to be a great man of science, but he is
  interested in chemistry as an amateur, and is, I fancy, a sort of disciple of
  Mason's. He has noticed a sad difference in Mason just lately, and he even
  called on me yesterday, though I hardly knew him by sight, in the hope that I
  would back up his urgent suggestion that Mason should go off for a change and
  a rest. Beyond these I don't think I know of a single visitor. But here we
  are at the Megatherium."</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">Mr. Jacob Mason's house stood in its own grounds in a quiet
  suburban road. It was not a very large house, but it straggled about
  comfortably in the manner of detached houses built in the suburbs at a time
  when space was less valuable than now, and it consisted of two floors only.
  The front door was not far from the road, and was clearly visible to
  passengers who might chance to look through either of the two iron gates that
  opened one on each end of the semi-circular drive.</p>

  <p>All these things Martin Hewitt noticed as the Rev. Mr. Potswood pushed
  open one of these gates, and the two walked up the drive. The front door
  stood in a portico, and a French window gave access to the roof of this
  portico from a bedroom or dressing-room. As Hewitt and his companion
  approached the house the French window was pushed open, and a man
  appeared&mdash;a middle-aged, slightly stoutish man with a short, grey beard;
  commonplace enough in himself, but now convulsed with noisy anger, shaking
  his fists and stamping on the portico-roof.</p>

  <p><a id="pic6"
     name="pic6"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1403201h-images/Triangle-2-2.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>"Get out!" he shouted. "Don't come near my house again, or I'll have you
  flung out! Go away and take your friends with you! D'you hear? Go away, sir,
  and don't come here annoying me! Go! Go at once!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Potswood absolutely staggered with amazement. "Why," he gasped, "it's
  Mason! He's mad&mdash;clean mad! Why, Mason, my poor friend, don't you know
  me?"</p>

  <p>"Get out, I say!" cried Mason. "Give me no more of your talk! I won't have
  you here!" And now Hewitt caught a glimpse of a girl's face at the window
  behind the man&mdash;a pale and handsome face, drawn with anxiety and
  fear.</p>

  <p>Hewitt seized the clergyman quickly by the arm. "Come," he whispered
  hurriedly, "come away at once. There is a reason for this. Get away at once.
  If you can answer back angrily, do so, but at any rate, come away."</p>

  <p>He hurried back to the gate, half dragging the astounded rector, who was
  all too honest a soul to be able to counterfeit an anger he did not feel,
  even if his amazement had not made him speechless. Hewitt closed the gate
  behind him and said as he walked, "Where is the rectory? We will go there. He
  may have sent a message while you were out."</p>

  <p>Mechanically the rector took the first turning. "But he's mad!" he
  protested. "Mad, poor fellow! Merciful heavens, Mr. Hewitt, his whole tale
  must have been a delusion! A mere madman's fancy! Poor fellow! We must go
  back, Mr. Hewitt&mdash;we really must! We can't leave that poor girl there
  alone with a raving maniac!"</p>

  <p>"No," Hewitt insisted, "come to the rectory. That is no madness, Mr.
  Potswood. Couldn't you see the colour of the man under the eyes, and the
  shaking of his beard? That was not anger and it was not madness. It was
  terror, Mr. Potswood&mdash;sheer, sick terror! Terror, or some emotion very
  much like it."</p>

  <p>"But, if terror, why that outburst? What does it mean? If it were terror,
  why not rather welcome our company and help?"</p>

  <p>"Don't you see, Mr. Potswood?" answered Hewitt. "Don't you guess? <i>Mason
  is watched, and he knows it!</i> He was acting his anger before unseen
  eyes&mdash;and he knew they were on him!"</p>

  <p>"God be merciful to us all," ejaculated the clergyman. "Poor
  man&mdash;poor sinner! What is this unspeakable thing which has him in its
  clutches? What had he done to give himself over to such a power?"</p>

  <p>"We can tell nothing, and guess nothing, as yet," Hewitt answered. "Let us
  see if he has sent you a message. It seems likely. If he has it may help us.
  If not&mdash;then I think we must do something decisive at once. But don't
  hurry so! It is hard to restrain one's self, I know, but there may be eyes on
  us, Mr. Potswood, and we must not seem to be persisting in our errand."</p>

  <p>So they went through the quiet streets for the two or three furlongs that
  seemed so many miles to the good parson. Arrived at the rectory, Mr. Potswood
  pushed impatiently through the gate, and was hurrying toward the house, when
  he perceived a bent little old man standing among some shrubs with his own
  gardener, who was digging.</p>

  <p>"There's Mason's gardener!" the rector exclaimed, and went to meet
  him.</p>

  <p>The old man touched his hat, looked sharply towards Hewitt, who was
  waiting near the rectory door, and then disappeared round a corner of the
  house, the rector following. In a few seconds Mr. Potswood reappeared, with a
  slip of paper in his hand. "Here," he said, "see this! The old man was told
  to give it to nobody but me, and in nobody else's presence. He's been waiting
  since one o'clock."</p>

  <p>Scrawled on the paper, in trembling and straggling letters, were these
  words:&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
    "You must not bring Mr. Martin Hewitt to my house this afternoon. I am
    watched. It is hopeless. Do not desert me. Bring him to-night after dark at
    eight. I shall want his best skill, and you shall know all. After dark.
    Come to the back gate in the lane, which will be ajar, and through the
    conservatory at the side, where my niece will be waiting at eight, after
    dark. Burn this and do not let it out of your sight first. Send a line by
    this man to say you will do as I ask, but do not say what it is, for fear
    of accidents. Send at once. Do come at eight, with Mr. Hewitt."
  </blockquote>

  <p>"We must do as he says," remarked Hewitt. "We know nothing of this matter,
  and we must be guided till we do. Just write an unsigned note&mdash;'All
  shall be as you request,' or words to that effect, and be sure the man gives
  it to him. Let him out behind through the churchyard, if possible, and tell
  him not to go straight from one house to the other. Is he an intelligent
  man?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;uncommonly shrewd, I believe. He says he can't have been
  followed. He knows several gardeners hereabout, and he seems to have called
  on each of them on his way&mdash;in at the front of the garden and out at the
  back each time, after a few minutes' conversation. Gipps is rather a cunning
  old fellow."</p>

  <p>"Ah," said Hewitt admiringly, "that's the sort of messenger I often want.
  I'll give him half a crown for himself and the money to pay for a telegram on
  his way. He knows nothing essential, of course?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;only that his master is in some sort of trouble, and warned him
  that he might be followed."</p>

  <p>"That is good. I shall telegraph to Detective-Inspector Plummer, of
  Scotland Yard. All right&mdash;I quite understand that all I have heard is
  confidential. I shall tell Plummer nothing till I may&mdash;indeed, as yet I
  have very little to tell that would help him. But I think it will be well to
  have the police within call&mdash;we may want them at a moment's notice; I
  have no police powers, you see, and Plummer has the Denson case in hand. I
  will ask him to be here, at this house, before a quarter to eight, if you
  will allow me."</p>

  <p>And so the telegram went to Plummer, and Hewitt, accepting the rector's
  invitation to an early dinner before starting on their visit, resigned
  himself to wait. He did not like the waste of time, as he frankly told Mr.
  Potswood. He would have preferred to see Mason at once, at any risk, and to
  take what means he thought necessary without delay. But as it seemed that the
  risk was to be chiefly Mason's, and as Mason knew all of which both he and
  the rector were ignorant, Mason must be allowed to choose his own time.</p>

  <p>The excellent Mr. Potswood endured agonies of suspense, though he also
  insisted that Mason's wishes must be observed exactly. "What is it
  all&mdash;what can it be?" he ejaculated again and again. "What dreadful
  influence can thus compass a man about, here in London, in these times?"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">It was autumn, and night fell early. Dinner was over at
  last, and they had scarcely left the table when Plummer arrived, anxious and
  eager.</p>

  <p>"You'll have to trust me a little, Plummer," Hewitt said, when he had made
  him known to the rector. "I can tell you nothing now&mdash;know nothing, in
  fact, or very little more than nothing. The fact is, I'm going to see a man
  who promises information to me alone, in confidence, as his client, and I
  don't know how long I may have to keep you in the dark. But this is where the
  trail lies hot, and I know that's where you want to be. More, if you're
  wanted suddenly you'll be at hand. You have a man or two with you, I suppose,
  as I suggested?"</p>

  <p>"Three of the best of them. They will follow us up. Is it far?"</p>

  <p>"No, close enough. It is a house in a walled garden&mdash;not a high wall.
  We go in at a gate from the lane behind, and I think you should wait at that
  gate, and put your men at hand. We mustn't go in as a crowd. The rector had
  better go first, and you and I will follow on the opposite side of the
  road."</p>

  <p>So the procession was formed, and it was still some three minutes short of
  eight o'clock when Hewitt and Plummer joined the clergyman at the door in the
  garden wall behind Mason's house. The door was ajar as had been promised in
  Mason's note. Leaving Plummer on guard without, Martin Hewitt and the rector
  stepped as silently as possible through the little kitchen garden and across
  a strip of lawn toward where a dull light illuminated the conservatory, at
  the right-hand end of the house. The door of the conservatory was ajar also,
  and this the rector pushed open.</p>

  <p>"Miss Creswick!" the rector called, in a loud whisper. "Miss Creswick!"
  And with that a girl appeared within.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Mr. Potswood," she said, "I'm so glad you've come! I can't think
  what's wrong with poor uncle! I'm afraid he must be going mad! He is
  terrified at something, and he has been getting worse, till he could hardly
  speak or walk. Dr. Lawson has been&mdash;about an hour ago, and since then
  uncle has been much quieter, in his study."</p>

  <p>They were entering the dimly-lighted drawing-room now. "Dr. Lawson?"
  queried the rector. "Rather an unusual visitor, isn't he? How long has he
  been gone?"</p>

  <p>Miss Creswick flushed slightly through all her paleness and grief. "I
  don't know," she said. "He let himself out, I fancy. He said he could not
  stay long when he came, but I didn't hear him go; I have been upstairs, and
  the servants are in the kitchen&mdash;they say uncle's mad, and I'm really
  afraid he is!"</p>

  <p>They left the drawing-room, and walked along the corridor and the hall to
  the opposite side of the house, where the study lay. Miss Creswick tapped
  gently at the door, but there was no answer. She tapped again, louder, and
  then came the faint sound of a quick step on the carpet, and then a slight
  scraping noise, as when a door is closed over a carpet it will scarcely pass.
  "That's the window into the garden," said Miss Creswick. "Why is he going
  out? Uncle! Uncle Jacob!"</p>

  <p>But now the silence was wholly unbroken. Hewitt snatched quickly at the
  door-handle. "Locked!" he said. "Come&mdash;the quickest way into the
  garden!"</p>

  <p>They ran out at the front door, and round toward the study window. It was
  a French window, exactly at the opposite end of the house to the
  conservatory, and now the gas-light streamed out through one half of it,
  which stood curtainless and ajar, while the curtain was drawn across the
  other half. Hewitt was the least familiar with the place, but he was quickest
  on his legs, and more seriously alarmed than the others. He reached the
  window first&mdash;and instantly turned and thrust the rector back against
  Miss Creswick. "Quick! take her away," he said; "we are too late!" and in the
  same moment, even as Hewitt dashed over the threshold, he snatched a whistle
  from his pocket, and blew his hardest.</p>

  <p><a id="pic7"

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>There on the floor lay Mason, his face dreadful and staring and black;
  tight in his neck was the band of a tourniquet, and fresh and wet on his
  forehead was the Red Triangle.</p>

  <p>Hewitt snatched at the screw of the tourniquet behind the neck, and
  loosened it as quickly as hands could turn. But it was too late. Too late,
  the examining surgeon afterwards said, by a quarter of an hour.</p>

  <p>Plummer was at the window with his men at his heels even before the
  tourniquet was half unscrewed.</p>

  <p>"Round the wall of the garden," shouted Hewitt, "and whistle up the
  police! He's only this moment out!"</p>

  <p>The house was alive with shouts and screams. The rector came running back,
  and Hewitt, busy with his useless attempt at restoration, called now for a
  doctor. People were scampering in the street, and Hewitt left the victim to
  the care of the rector, and himself joined Plummer, all in fewer seconds than
  it may be told in.</p>

  <p>But Plummer and his men were beaten, for nothing&mdash;not so much as a
  moving shadow&mdash;was seen in the garden or about the walls. Worse, the
  general trampling would obliterate possible tracks. Plummer set a guard of
  police about the wall, and came in for consultation with Hewitt.</p>

  <p>The body was carried into another room, and Hewitt and Plummer began an
  examination of the study.</p>

  <p>"No signs of a struggle," commented Plummer, "and there was no noise, they
  say. That's very odd."</p>

  <p>"From what I have seen and heard to-day," said Hewitt, "it is as I should
  have expected. I believe the man was almost killed by terror before he was
  strangled&mdash;dazed, stricken dumb, paralysed, deafened by
  it&mdash;everything but blinded, poor wretch. And to have been blinded would
  have been a mercy."</p>

  <p>And then, as they made their examination systematically, calmly and
  without flurry, Hewitt told the whole tale of his day's adventures, together
  with all he had heard from the rector. "The man's dead," he said, "and his
  confidence is at an end. Indeed, I never had it&mdash;the case, so far as I
  am concerned, is over before I have even touched it. I haven't had a chance,
  Plummer; and the thing is deep and dark, deep and dark. Oh, if only the man
  had let me come to him in the daylight, spite of all! This might all have
  been averted.... There has been a close search here, too. See how everything
  is turned over. But, stay!"</p>

  <p>A low fire smouldered in the grate, and on it lay ashes of many burnt
  papers. Hewitt passed the shovel carefully under these ashes, lifted them out
  and placed them gently on the table under the light of the gas-pendant.</p>

  <p>"I must leave you," said Plummer. "There'll be an inspector here from the
  station in a moment&mdash;he won't interfere with you, and if anybody can get
  information out of this room it's you. The next thing for me is plain. I must
  make sure of Dr. Lawson, if he can be found."</p>

  <p>"That is quite right, without a doubt," Hewitt responded. "I may find
  anything or nothing in this room, and, meanwhile, he was the last person
  known to have been here, and the only visitor, and he was not heard to go
  out, unless we heard him go when we were outside the study door. More, it was
  plainly some one familiar with the place who was able to get away so quickly
  by the window and the garden."</p>

  <p>"And his interest in getting rid of Mason, too&mdash;the girl of age in a
  few months, and all obstacles to getting hold of her, and her money, removed.
  And&mdash;and the surgical tourniquet, the Chinese colour and
  everything!"</p>

  <p>"Quite right, you must make sure of him, as you say. You will get his
  address from the rector. Meanwhile I'll try to begin my little contribution
  to the case&mdash;to begin it as best I can, after all the chances have made
  it useless."</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">It was after nine when Plummer returned. The rector had just
  rejoined Hewitt in the study, having left poor Miss Creswick, utterly broken
  down, in her room, in charge of a scarcely less terrified servant. Plummer
  tapped, and pushed the study door open.</p>

  <p>"That's done clean and sure enough," he said, with professional calmness.
  "And he's a cool hand, is that Dr. Lawson. But have you found anything more?
  We shall want all we can get."</p>

  <p>"We shall," Hewitt assented, "and we shall find more than we've got now,
  or I'm grievously mistaken. But tell me first what you've done."</p>

  <p>He removed the blotting pad, on which the paper ashes still lay, and very
  carefully shut it away in a wide drawer where no draught could disturb it; he
  also shut another drawer which stood open.</p>

  <p>"We had no difficulty in finding Dr. Lawson," Plummer began. "We met him,
  in fact, leaving his surgery. I went back with him into the gas-light, and
  there put it to him plump. Well, he was staggered, badly. Any man would be,
  of course. But he pulled himself together wonderfully soon, and the first
  thing he said was that he was just on his way to Mason's house. I thought at
  first, of course, that he meant to deny that he had been there already, and I
  gave him the usual warning about what he said being used in evidence. But he
  went on, and I've got it all safely noted. He admitted that he had been here,
  at about seven o'clock or just before, and he said he came because Mr. Mason
  sent for him. That doesn't seem likely, does it, on the facts as we know
  them?"</p>

  <p>"Why, no," said the rector. "The last time he was here he was ordered out,
  and I know of no reason why he should have been asked to come to-day. We must
  ask if anybody was sent."</p>

  <p>"I have asked," replied Plummer, "just now, and none of the servants was
  sent. But Lawson's story is that he <i>was</i> sent for and came, though he
  said he shouldn't say what Mason wanted to see him about till he knew more of
  the case. Looks as though he hadn't quite got his story ready yet, doesn't
  it? He had thought over the point about not being seen to go away, though; he
  said he had let himself out at about half-past seven, being familiar with the
  ways of the house. And he said that Mason was rather unwell&mdash;nervously
  upset&mdash;when he left him, but that was all."</p>

  <p>"It's terrible," said the rector, "terrible. It seems impossible to
  believe it of young Lawson; and yet&mdash;and yet!" And then after a
  pause&mdash;"Good heavens!" he burst out again. "Why, I only realise it now!
  There is the other crime, too! Denson! Two murders! Two&mdash;and most
  certainly by the same hand! Mr. Plummer, I <i>can't</i> believe it! Oh,
  there's more behind, more behind, Mr. Hewitt."</p>

  <p>"There <i>is</i> more," said Hewitt, "as you will see when I tell you the
  little I have been able to ascertain. There <i>is</i> more behind, though I
  see little of it yet. First&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>There was a sharp knock at the front door, followed by a ring, muffled in
  the distant kitchen. Hewitt started up. "Who is this late visitor at this
  unvisited house?" he said. "If it is the police, well enough. But if anybody
  else&mdash;<i>anybody</i>&mdash;you may call me Doctor, or anything you
  please, except Martin Hewitt. Don't forget that!"</p>

  <p>There were hurried steps in the hall, a question or two, and the study
  door was pushed open. Two servants&mdash;they would not venture from the
  kitchen singly this dreadful night&mdash;made a confused announcement of "Mr.
  Myatt," and were instantly pushed aside by Mr. Myatt himself, anxious and
  agitated.</p>

  <p>The late Mr. Mason's closest scientific friend was a palish, black-bearded
  man, of above middle height, with stooping shoulders and a very quick pair of
  eyes. There was something about his face that somehow reminded Hewitt of
  portraits he had seen of John Knox, and yet it was not such a face as his; it
  seemed oddly unlike in its very likeness.</p>

  <p>"What is this dreadful news, Mr. Potswood?" he cried. "I heard people
  talking in the next street on my way home. Is it true? But the servants have
  told me so. They say our poor friend&mdash;but there has been an arrest,
  hasn't there?"</p>

  <p><a id="pic8"
     name="pic8"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1403201h-images/Triangle-2-4.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>The rector nodded gravely.</p>

  <p>"And who? Tell me about it, Mr. Potswood&mdash;tell me!"</p>

  <p>"I think I must see how Miss Creswick is doing," said Hewitt, speaking
  across to Plummer and making for the door.</p>

  <p>"Certainly, doctor, certainly!" answered Plummer with a nod.</p>

  <p>Hewitt closed the door behind him, leaving the rector in the full tide of
  his account of the day's events; but Hewitt's way took him to the kitchen,
  where the servants were cowering and whispering together, frightened and
  bewildered.</p>

  <p>"Is there any paint or varnish of any sort in the place?" he asked
  sharply. "Give me anything there is&mdash;black, if possible&mdash;and a
  brush, quickly."</p>

  <p>"There's&mdash;there's Brunswick black, sir, for the stove," said the
  cook.</p>

  <p>"That will do; be quick. Oh, there's Gipps, the gardener! You're just the
  man I want, Gipps. Come and find me a board or a plank, quick as you please!"
  And Hewitt pushed the old gardener before him into the garden by the kitchen
  door.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">A quarter of an hour later, Mr. Everard Myatt, having heard
  all that was to be told of his friend's terrible death and the arrest of Mr.
  Lawson, turned to go, meeting Hewitt at the study door on his way.</p>

  <p>"And how is poor Miss Creswick by now, doctor?" he asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>Hewitt shook his head. "No better than you could expect," he said, "but,
  on the whole, no worse. She mustn't be seen to-night, of course, but,
  perhaps, if you could call round in the morning with the
  rector&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of course&mdash;of course! Poor girl&mdash;and Dr. Lawson suspected,
  too&mdash;what a terrible blow for her! Anything I can do, doctor, of course,
  as I said to Mr. Potswood&mdash;anything I can do I will do as gladly as such
  sad circumstances permit."</p>

  <p>The rector had been coming to the door with Mr. Myatt, but Plummer,
  catching a sign from Hewitt, restrained him unseen, and Hewitt and the
  visitor walked into the hall together.</p>

  <p>"They have put out the light, it seems," Hewitt said. "I wonder
  why&mdash;unless people from the crowd have been coming into the garden and
  staring in through the glass panels. I wonder if we can find the door-handle.
  Yes, here it is. Dark outside, too! Good-night&mdash;mind how you go on the
  steps!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Myatt checked and stumbled in the dark porch, and reached quickly
  downward.</p>

  <p>"There's a board standing across the porch," he said.</p>

  <p>"A board?" replied Hewitt. "So there is. Let me move it, or it'll upset
  somebody. Good-night!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Myatt strode off into the dark night, and Hewitt, noiselessly lifting
  the board he had himself placed in position, hastened back to the study.</p>

  <p>He swung up the board, all sticky and shiny with Brunswick black, and laid
  it across a spread newspaper, on the table. There on the top, in the midst of
  the black varnish, were the prints of all five finger-tips of a hand, where
  Mr. Myatt had felt for the obstruction in the porch.</p>

  <p>Hewitt opened the drawer he had shut a little while back, and took
  therefrom a sheet of writing-paper. And when, with the lens from his pocket,
  he began to examine that paper in comparison with the finger-marks on the
  board, Plummer and the rector could see that there were also two distinct
  finger-marks on the paper and one faint one&mdash;all red. Plummer came to
  look.</p>

  <p>"What's this?" he said. "Was this what you were going to tell us
  about?"</p>

  <p>Hewitt did not reply for a few moments, but continued his examination.
  Then he rose and turned to Plummer.</p>

  <p>"You've still got that piece of paper in your pocket, I suppose," he said,
  "with the little red smudges of colour put there by the police surgeon?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;here it is," and the detective took it from his waistcoat
  pocket.</p>

  <p>"Thanks," said Hewitt. "Now, see here. That is a little of the red stuff
  taken from the mark on Denson's forehead a week ago, and found to consist of
  vermilion, oil and wax. You have seen the second impression of that awful
  mark on the forehead of your poor friend Mason, Mr. Potswood, to-night. This
  room has been searched for papers before we began, and papers have been
  burnt. In the search this drawer was opened&mdash;containing, as you see,
  nothing but a supply of new headed note-paper. The note-paper was hastily
  lifted to see if anything else lay beneath, and here, on the bottom sheet,
  these finger-marks were left in that same adhesive, freely marking
  red&mdash;a sort of stuff that sticks to and marks whatever it touches. The
  hand that lifted that paper was the hand that impressed that ghastly mark;
  and the hand that left its print on this black varnish was Mr. Everard
  Myatt's! Now compare the two!"</p>

  <p>Plummer had snatched the lens, and was narrowly comparing the marks ere
  Hewitt had well finished speaking.</p>

  <p><a id="pic9"
     name="pic9"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1403201h-images/Triangle-2-5.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>"They are!" he cried, as the rector bent excitedly over him. "They are the
  same! See&mdash;forefinger and middle finger&mdash;the same, every line!"</p>

  <p>"I needn't tell you," pursued Hewitt, "certainly I needn't tell Plummer,
  that that is the most certain and scientific method of identification known.
  The police know that&mdash;and use it. But now there is some more. You saw me
  take that charred paper from the fire. Sometimes words may be read on charred
  paper&mdash;it depends on the paper and the ink. Most of the cinders were too
  much broken to yield any information, though we may try again by daylight.
  But one was suggestive. See it!" Hewitt very carefully pulled out the flat
  drawer that held the cinders.</p>

  <p>"You see," he went on, "that one&mdash;this&mdash;is different from the
  rest. It has retained its original form better, and has been less broken,
  because of being of thicker paper. It is a crumpled envelope. Look at the
  flap&mdash;it has never been closed down. Moreover, on that same flap you may
  read in embossed letters, still visible, part of the name of this house.
  Plain inference&mdash;this was an envelope intended for a letter never sent,
  and so crumpled up and dropped into the waste-paper basket. But why should
  such an apparently unimportant thing as that be carefully brought from the
  waste-paper basket and burnt? Somebody was anxious that the smallest scrap of
  paper evidencing a certain correspondence should be destroyed. But look
  closely at the front of the envelope&mdash;the ink shows a rather lighter
  grey than the paper. The address is incomplete&mdash;at any rate, no more
  than some of the first line and a little of the second is at all visible now;
  but it is plain that the first line begins with an E. The letters immediately
  following are not distinct, but next there is a capital M beginning a name
  which is clearly Myatt or Myall. Now, <i>that</i> is why, when Myatt came
  here, I took the first steps to hand to get an impression of his finger-tips,
  in order to compare them with the marks on that paper."</p>

  <p>"But why," asked the astonished rector, "why did he come back?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing but a bold measure to see how things were going&mdash;he came as
  his own spy, that's all. He's a keen and dangerous man. Don't you remember
  telling me how he called on you yesterday, though you hardly knew him by
  sight, merely to ask you to persuade Mason to take a holiday? It struck me as
  a little odd at the time. He was pumping you, Mr. Potswood&mdash;he wanted to
  find what Mason had been saying! And he is not alone&mdash;plainly he is not
  alone, for poor Mason knew they were watching everywhere. But come&mdash;this
  is no time for speculation. Plummer&mdash;you must hold him
  safely&mdash;we'll pick up evidence enough when you've got him. I wouldn't
  leave it, Plummer&mdash;I'd take him to-night!"</p>

  <p>"You're right&mdash;right, as usual, Mr. Hewitt," Plummer agreed. "More
  especially as the rector was&mdash;well, a little incautious in talking to
  him just now."</p>

  <p>"I? What did I say?" Mr. Potswood asked, astonished. "I had no
  suspicions&mdash;how could I have&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, Mr. Potswood," the detective replied, "you had no suspicions, and for
  that very reason, in the excitement of the narrative, you called Mr. Martin
  Hewitt by his right name at least twice! And after I had called him 'doctor,'
  too!" he added regretfully.</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" asked Hewitt.</p>

  <p>The poor rector was sadly abashed. "But I really wasn't aware of it, Mr.
  Hewitt!" he protested. "I hardly think I could&mdash;but, there, perhaps I
  did! Of course, if Inspector Plummer remembers it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He'll be off!" exclaimed Hewitt. "With that hint, and finding the black
  stuff on his hands, he'll smell a rat instantly! Come, Mr. Potswood&mdash;you
  can show us the nearest way to his house, at any rate! Come&mdash;we may get
  him yet!"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">But the good rector's slip of the tongue was fatal, and
  Myatt was not yet to meet the fate that fitted him. The house was not
  far&mdash;less than a mile away. It was a detached house, but quite a small
  one&mdash;smaller than Mason's. Plummer blocked every exit with a man, but
  his caution was wasted. Myatt was gone.</p>

  <p>There was the house and the furniture and two servants, just as it might
  have been any day in the year when Myatt was out for an hour. But now he was
  out for good. The police watched and waited all night, and all the next day;
  they waited and watched for a week, and the house was under observation after
  that, but Myatt never returned. He had made his plans, it was plain, for just
  such a flight, whenever the necessity might arise; and when he was assured
  that danger threatened, he simply vanished in the dark of a London night.
  Search brought no information&mdash;not a scrap of telltale paper lay in
  Calton Lodge&mdash;not a letter, not a line. Though, indeed, the police were
  to see more of Myatt's work yet&mdash;and so was Hewitt.</p>

  <p>Dr. Lawson's detention did not last the night out. The unhappy Mason had
  indeed sent to him, by a chance messenger, having grown desperate in long
  waiting for the return of Gipps from the rectory. Mason was ready to call in
  any aid, to recall any of the friendships he had sacrificed in the past. But
  Lawson was long in coming, having received the note after a long professional
  round, and when at last he arrived, Mason was a little reassured by the
  promise of Hewitt's visit. Therefore, he did not tell the doctor so much as
  he might have done. Nevertheless, he talked wildly and vaguely, so that Dr.
  Lawson feared some disturbance of his reason. The doctor quieted and soothed
  him, however, and when he left he promised to return after his consultation
  hour at the surgery was over. He must have been watched away from the house,
  and then the blow fell that sealed for ever the lips of Jacob Mason.</p>

  <p>Poor Miss Creswick was taken from the old house in which she could no
  longer remain, and for a few months she stayed at the rectory, tended
  lovingly by the rector's excellent wife&mdash;stayed there, in fact, till her
  wedding-day, which took place early the next year; so that for her and Dr.
  Lawson the tragedy ended in happiness, after all.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"God forgive me," cried the rector in the grey of the
  morning, when it became clear that Myatt had escaped&mdash;"God forgive me!
  Through my stupidity a horrible creature has been set loose in the world to
  work his diabolical will afresh!"</p>

  <p>"Never mind," said Hewitt. "It was not stupidity, Mr.
  Potswood&mdash;nothing but your openness of character. You were not trained
  to the cunning that we must use in my profession. And there will be more than
  Myatt to take&mdash;he was not alone! It is plain that Mason was found to be
  wavering in whatever horrible allegiance he had bound himself, and he was
  watched. No, Myatt was not alone!"</p>

  <p>"No, I fear not," replied the clergyman. "I fear not: there is horrible
  mystery still. The watching and besetting that terrified him so much; the
  fact that he seems to have yielded up his life without a struggle&mdash;and
  that with help so near; and the connection&mdash;what could it have
  been?&mdash;between Mason and the other victim&mdash;Denson. That is a deep
  mystery indeed! And that horrible sign! Mr. Hewitt, you have done
  much&mdash;but not all!"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Martin Hewitt, "not nearly all. It is even doubtful whether
  or not it will be my lot to come across the thing again; but it will be in
  the hands of the police. And, after all, we have achieved something. For we
  know that if Myatt can be captured we shall be at the heart of the
  mystery."</p>

  <h2><a id="story3"
     name="story3"></a>III. &mdash; THE CASE OF THE LEVER KEY</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Harmsworth London Magazine</i>, Jan 1903</h3>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">IN some of the cases which we now know to have been
  connected with the Red Triangle, there was nothing, in the first place, to
  show any such association. In some of these cases the connection has become
  apparent only since the final clearing up of the whole mystery, and with
  these cases we have no present concern; but in others it revealed itself
  during the investigation of the case. It was to this second category that the
  next case belonged&mdash;the next at all connectible, that is, after that of
  the mysterious death of Mr. Jacob Mason and the flight of Everard Myatt.</p>

  <p>The case was remarkable in other respects also; first, because in one of
  its features it had a resemblance to the case of Samuel's diamonds, which
  first brought the Red Triangle to Hewitt's notice; next, because in its
  course Hewitt encountered what he declared to be the most ingenious and
  baffling cryptogram that he had ever seen in the length of his strange
  experience; and thirdly, because I was the means of placing that cryptogram
  in his hands, owing to one of those odd chances that arise again and again in
  real life&mdash;are, indeed, so common as to pass almost unregarded&mdash;and
  yet might be thought improbable if offered in the guise of a mere story.
  Hewitt has often alluded to the curious persistence of such chances in his
  experience. I think I have elsewhere mentioned a certain police officer's
  prolonged search after a criminal for whose arrest he held a warrant, ending
  in the discovery&mdash;because of a misdirected call&mdash;that the man had
  been living all the time next door to himself; and I have also told of the
  other detective inspector, who, being sent in search of a criminal of whom he
  had but the meagrest and most unsatisfactory particulars, and whom he
  scarcely hoped ever to run down, actually <i>fell over</i> the man as he was
  leaving the office where he had received his information, in the doorway of
  which the fellow had stooped to tie his shoe-lace! But, as Hewitt would say,
  nothing but the exceptional nature of the surrounding circumstances makes
  these things seem extraordinary. What more ordinary experience, for example,
  than to meet a friend in some London street&mdash;perhaps one friend of the
  only dozen or so you have among the four millions of people about you? The
  odds against you two, of all the millions, choosing the one street of the
  thousands in London to walk down at the same minute of time, would seem
  incalculable; and yet the chance comes off so often as to be a matter of the
  most ordinary experience.</p>

  <p>On this occasion I was expecting orders from my editor to produce certain
  articles on the subject of the London hospitals. It will be remembered that
  the matter was very much in the air a few years ago, and as nothing is
  professionally more uncomfortable than to be called on suddenly for an
  accurate and reasonable leading article on a subject one knows nothing about,
  I wrote to my friend, Barton McCarthy, who is house-surgeon at St.
  Augustine's, and he replied by an offer to tell me anything I cared to ask if
  I would call at the hospital.</p>

  <p>I set out accordingly some little time after a breakfast even later than
  ordinary, and called in at Hewitt's office on my way downstairs, to say that
  I should not be lunching at our usual place that day.</p>

  <p>"No," Hewitt answered, "nor shall I, I expect. I'm off to the City, at
  once. I have an urgent message to go immediately to Kingsley, Bell and
  Dalton's, in Broad Street, where a big bond robbery has just been discovered.
  Perhaps I can give you a lift in my cab?"</p>

  <p>We hurried off together accordingly. Hewitt knew nothing of the case he
  had to examine, and so could tell me nothing, beyond the short urgent request
  that he would come at once, and that the matter involved the loss of bonds to
  a very large amount; and he dropped me at a convenient spot, whence my walk
  to the hospital was but a short one.</p>

  <p>I saw my friend McCarthy, and bothered him very successfully for nearly an
  hour, getting all the information I had expected, and more, during a very
  interesting walk through the great hospital.</p>

  <p>"You get some idea in a place like this," said McCarthy, as we came at
  last into the receiving room for accident cases, "you get some idea, Brett,
  of the size of this great London machine working about us. You might walk
  about the streets for a week and never see a serious accident, or even an
  accident at all, and yet, you see, here they come all day long&mdash;a stream
  of people damaged or killed in the machine."</p>

  <p>A decent workman was having a gashed hand dressed and strapped, and a
  navvy with bandages about his head was being led away by a friend. Nurses and
  dressers were waiting ready to take their orderly turns at the incoming
  casualties, and as we looked a more serious case was brought in on an
  ambulance by two policemen. The patient was a ragged, disreputable-looking
  fellow of middle age, in grimy and tattered clothes, whose head had been
  roughly bandaged by the policemen who brought him. He had been knocked down
  and kicked on the head by a butcher's cart-horse, it seemed, in Moorgate
  Street, and he was quite insensible. A very short examination showed that the
  case was nothing trivial, and McCarthy sent me to sit in his private room to
  wait lunch, while he gave the matter his personal attention.</p>

  <p>When he returned he brought a small crumpled envelope in his hand. "That
  case is put to bed," he said, "still insensible."</p>

  <p>"Is it very bad?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Slight fracture of the occipital, and, of course, concussion of the
  brain&mdash;probably contusion, too, I expect we shall find presently. Not so
  over serious for a healthy man, but I'm afraid he's an old soaker&mdash;the
  sort that crumple up at a touch. Nobody knows him, and there's nothing to
  identify him in the pockets&mdash;a few coppers, an old knife, and so on. So
  we can't send to tell his friends&mdash;unless we bring in your friend Martin
  Hewitt to trace 'em out, which would come too expensive. Besides," McCarthy
  added, dropping into a seat before his desk, "if he's got any friends they'll
  come, sooner or later, when they miss him. This is the only thing he'd got
  beside what's in the pockets&mdash;he'd been sent on a message,
  probably."</p>

  <p>My friend held up the crumpled envelope and took from it a small key.
  "He'd got this envelope gripped tightly in his hand," he said, "but there was
  no address on it, so we tore it open in the hope of finding one inside. But
  there was nothing there but the key. If you were a very promising pupil of
  your friend Hewitt, I should expect you to take a glance at it and tell us
  the man's address at once, together with his age, birthplace, when
  vaccinated, and the residence of his maternal grandmother. But you're not, so
  I'll let you off."</p>

  <p>McCarthy turned the key idly about in his hand and tried it on a lock in
  his desk. "Stopped up," he remarked, withdrawing it, and peeping into the
  barrel; "not dirt, either&mdash;stopped up with paper! What's that for?"</p>

  <p>He took a pin to clear the barrel, and the paper came away quite readily.
  It was a tight little roll, which the surgeon pulled out into a small strip
  rather less than three inches long and about half-an-inch broad.</p>

  <p>"Hullo!" he exclaimed. "Look here! Here's a job for Martin Hewitt, after
  all! Figures! What does that mean? And what an amazing place to put them in!
  A key barrel! By Jove, Brett, this looks like one of your favourite
  adventures. Somebody sends a key in an envelope, and a row of
  incomprehensible figures rolled up inside the key. Look at it!"</p>

  <p>I took the key and the paper. The key was of a good sort; small, inscribed
  "Tripp's Patent" on the bow, and it evidently belonged to a superior lever
  lock. The paper which had come from the barrel was very thin and
  tough&mdash;a kind I have seen used in typewriters. It had been very
  carefully and closely rolled, and then pushed into the key so that its
  natural tendency to open out held it tightly within. Written upon it with a
  fine pen appeared a series of very minute figures, thus:&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="quote">9, 8, 14, 4, 20, 18, 5, 9; 15, 19, 20,<br>
  0, 3, 9, 8, 5; 3, 23, 0, 0, 5, 13, 14,<br>
  19; 19, 20, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 1; 5, 20, 0,<br>
  0, 0, 0, 3, 22; 1, 15, 0, 0, 0, 0, 18,<br>
  5; 1, 8, 20, 11, 18, 9, 5, 20; 12, 5,<br>
  23, 14, 14, 1, 1, 20.</p><br>

  <p>"Well," inquired McCarthy, "what do you make of it?"</p>

  <p>"Not much as yet," I admitted. "But it's pretty certain it must be a
  cryptogram or code-writing of some sort; and if that's the case, I
  <i>think</i> I might back myself to read it&mdash;with a little time." For I
  well remembered the case of the "Flitterbat Lancers," and the lesson in
  cypher-reading which Hewitt then gave me.</p>

  <p>"Come," my friend replied, much interested, "let's see how you do it.
  Meantime we'll get on with our lunch."</p>

  <p>I took a pencil and a spare sheet of paper, and I studied those figures
  all through lunch and for some little time after. It soon became plain that
  the problem was much more difficult than it looked, and I said so. "At the
  first glance," I said, "it looked a fairly easy cypher; but as a matter of
  fact, I don't think it's easy at all. One assumes, of course, that the
  figures stand for letters, and on that assumption two or three peculiarities
  are noticeable. First, the highest number written here is 23, so that all the
  letters indicated, in whatever order they may come, are within the compass of
  the twenty-six letters of the alphabet. Next, the numbers most frequently
  repeated, if we except the noughts, are 5 and 20, which occur seven times
  each. Now, the vowel most frequently occurring in average English writing is
  e, and you will at once perceive that e is number five in the alphabet,
  counting from the beginning. More, if we go on counting so, we shall find
  that 20 is <i>t</i>, which is one of the most frequently occurring
  consonants. This would seem to hint that the cypher is of the very simplest
  description, consisting of the mere substitution of figures for letters in
  the exact order of the alphabet. But what, then, of the noughts? What can
  they mean? More especially when we consider that in three places there are
  actually four noughts in succession; for, of course, no letter is repeated
  four times successively in any English word, nor in any foreign word that I
  can imagine. But let us put down the letters in substitution for the figures,
  on the supposition that the figures stand for letters in their alphabetical
  order, leaving the noughts as they are. Then we get this."</p>

  <p>I rapidly pencilled the letters on the spare paper, thus:&mdash;<i>i, h,
  n, d, t, r, e, i; 0, s, t, 0, c, i, h, e; c, w, 0, 0, e, m, n, s; s, t, 0, 0,
  0, 0, f, a; e, t, 0, 0, 0, 0, c, v; a, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, r, e; a, h, t, k, r, i,
  e, t; l, e, w, n, n, a, a, t.</i></p>

  <p>"See there," I said. "Now, I can make nothing of that. When I come to
  examine the comparative frequency of the different letters, I find them much
  as they might be expected to be in a sentence of normal English, and any
  change would destroy the proportion. <i>E</i> and <i>t</i> are the most
  frequent, and then come <i>a, n, i, r, s,</i> and <i>c</i>. But as they stand
  they all mean nothing. It is possible that this may be one of the difficult
  variable letter cyphers, which Hewitt might read, but I can't. But even then,
  if the values of the letters change as they would do, they would get out of
  their normal proportions of frequency; so that a variable letter cypher seems
  unlikely. And there is another oddity. Look, and you will see that, counting
  the noughts in, the letters go in groups of eight, with a semi-colon at the
  end of each group. Now, it is impossible that the message can be a sentence
  in which every word has exactly eight letters&mdash;or, at least, I should
  think so. It can scarcely be that the semi-colon itself means a
  letter&mdash;it would be singular for one letter to occur with such curious
  regularity as that. There is no other visible division between the words, nor
  any single one of the usual aids by which the reader of secret cypher is able
  to take a hold of his work. No, I'm afraid I must give it up; for the
  present, at any rate. But I really think it is a thing that would vastly
  interest Hewitt, if I might show it to him. I suppose I mustn't?"</p>

  <p>"Well," McCarthy answered, "perhaps it isn't strictly according to rule,
  but I think I might venture to lend it to you till to-morrow, if that will
  do. Indeed, I think, on second thoughts, that I may consider myself quite
  justified, since it may lead to the man's identification, and it will be a
  sufficient answer to any inquiry to say that I have shown it to Mr. Martin
  Hewitt for that purpose. But you'll be careful of it, won't you? Do you want
  the key, too?"</p>

  <p>"I think, if I may, I will take the key and the envelope all together. You
  can never tell what may or what may not help him, and the three things may
  hang together, and perhaps explain each other in some mysterious way."</p>

  <p>"Very good&mdash;here's the whole bag of tricks. It's a queer business
  altogether, and I must say I feel inquisitive; certainly, if Hewitt can get
  anything out of those figures I shall be mighty curious to know how he does
  it. You'll come in again to-morrow, then?"</p>

  <p>I promised I would, and walked off with the crumpled envelope, the little
  key, and the puzzling strip of figures. Since the lesson from Hewitt which I
  have alluded to, I had often amused myself with cryptogram reading, and I had
  never found a cypher message in a newspaper "agony-column" the meaning of
  which I could not get at with a little trouble. But this was something
  altogether beyond me; and if I have any reader who prides himself on his
  ability to read secret cypher, I recommend him to try his skill on this one
  before he reads further.</p>

  <p>The circumstances, too, seemed as puzzling as the writing itself. Why, if
  any person wished to send a note and a key in a closed envelope, should he
  take the trouble to pack the note inside the key? Why, especially when the
  note was already written in so baffling a cypher? Whither had this ragged
  messenger been going with the mysterious package, and who had sent him, and
  why?</p>

  <p>Guessing and musing, I reached home, and found that Hewitt had returned
  before me. I made my way into his office, and came on him sitting at his desk
  with a large lens, attentively examining a broken brass padlock.</p>

  <p>"Am I bothering you?" I asked. "Are you on the bond robbery, now?"</p>

  <p>Martin Hewitt nodded, with a jerk of the hand toward the padlock. "It's a
  tough job," he said, "and I shall shut myself up presently and think hard
  over it; just now I can't see my way into it at all. But what have you got
  there?"</p>

  <p>"Never mind," I said, "you're too busy now. I came across something very
  odd at the hospital, which I thought would interest you&mdash;that's
  all."</p>

  <p>"Very well, let me see it. I haven't begun my bout of cogitation yet. Show
  me."</p>

  <p>I put the envelope, the key and the paper on the table before him. Hewitt,
  with a glance of surprise, picked up the key and examined it. "That's
  curious," he said, and straightway began fitting the key to the broken
  padlock on the desk.</p>

  <p>"Why, man alive!" he cried, with a sudden burst of excitement, "where did
  you get this? This&mdash;this is the article&mdash;the key&mdash;the very
  thing I want!" He sprang to his feet and stared in my face in sheer
  amazement. "Heavens, Brett, the thing's almost supernatural! I've a broken
  lever padlock here, and of all things in the world I wanted to find the one
  key that fitted it; and you calmly walk in and clap down the very thing under
  my nose! Where did you get it?"</p>

  <p><a id="pic11"
     name="pic11"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

    <img src="1403201h-images/Triangle-3-2.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>I told him the tale of the man who had been knocked down in Moorgate
  Street, and I explained exactly how the paper, the key and the envelope were
  found in relation to each other, and why I had brought them.</p>

  <p>"And when was the man knocked over?" Hewitt asked.</p>

  <p>"Some time between one and two o'clock, I should say," I replied. "They
  brought him in well before two, at any rate."</p>

  <p>Hewitt stared into vacancy for a moment, thinking hard. Then he said,
  "Brett, I believe you've saved my reputation&mdash;not that it could have
  suffered much, perhaps, in such a desperate case. But as a fact I had already
  advised the calling in of the police, and should, perhaps, even have given up
  the part of the case still left me. But this ought to put me on the proper
  track. You see, every one of these patent lever locks differs in some slight
  degree from all the rest, and only its own key will fit it; and here, by this
  amazing piece of good luck, is the one key for this very lock, and the man
  who had it is detained in hospital. Come, I'm off to see him. Insensible, you
  say, when you left?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," I answered, "and likely to be so for some time, McCarthy thinks; so
  you probably won't get much information out of him just yet. But the
  cypher&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'll examine the cypher as I go along, I think. But I should like to take
  a look at the man, at any rate, even if he can't tell me anything. Will you
  give me a note to your friend McCarthy?"</p>

  <p>"Of course," I answered, readily, and sat down to scribble the few lines
  necessary to introduce Hewitt.</p>

  <p>When I had finished, Hewitt, who had been examining the cryptogram
  meanwhile, remarked: "This cypher is something out of the common, Brett. I
  certainly don't expect to be able to read it in the cab-journey&mdash;perhaps
  not in a week of study. The man who devised this is a man of abilities
  altogether beyond the average."</p>

  <p>"I have had my best try at it," I said, "but it beats me wholly. I brought
  it purely as a matter of curiosity, to show you; it was the merest chance
  that I brought the key as well."</p>

  <p>"And if you hadn't I should probably have put the cypher aside until the
  case was over, and so have missed the whole thing. Another lesson never to
  despise what seem like trifles. If you have studied the cypher you have no
  doubt observed&mdash;but there, we'll talk that over afterwards, and the
  whole case if you like. I'll go now, and I'll tell you all about the business
  when time permits."</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">Here is the case of the bond robbery as it had been
  presented to Martin Hewitt that morning, while I was at St. Augustine's
  Hospital, and as I learned it from him later. I had been a little puzzled to
  hear Hewitt say that the case had seemed so desperately hopeless that he
  advised the calling in of the police, because my experience had rather been
  that it was Hewitt who was commonly called in&mdash;often too late&mdash;when
  the police were beaten, and I had never before heard of a case in which this
  order of things was reversed. It turned out, however, as will be seen, that
  in the state of the matter as it first presented itself the only measures
  that seemed possible were such as it was in the power of the police alone to
  adopt.</p>

  <p>Messrs. Kingsley, Bell, and Dalton were an old-established firm of brokers
  whose operations were not enormous nor much in the eye of the public, but who
  carried on a steady and reputable business in a set of offices high up in a
  great building in Broad Street&mdash;a building so large that the notice
  "Offices to let" was a permanent fixture in the front porch. The firm's
  clients were chiefly steady-going investors of the old-fashioned sort, who
  wished to avoid all speculative fireworks, and to deal through a firm whose
  habits were conformable to their own. The last Kingsley had left the firm and
  soon afterward died, some few years back, and now the head of the firm was
  Mr. Robert Stanstead Bell, a gentleman of some sixty years of age. There were
  a couple of sleeping partners&mdash;relations&mdash;but the one other active
  partner was Mr. Clarence Dalton, a young man but recently advanced to
  partnership, and, it was said, likely to become Mr. Bell's son-in-law
  whenever the old gentleman's daughter Lilian should be married.</p>

  <p>The steady, even round of business to which Kingsley, Bell, and Dalton,
  and their clerks were accustomed was suddenly interrupted by an appalling
  loss. It was discovered that bonds were missing from the safe, bonds to the
  amount of some £25,000; and whence, how, or when they were taken was an utter
  mystery. It was this loss which had occasioned the urgent message to
  Hewitt.</p>

  <p>When Hewitt reached the spot he was shown at once into an inner office,
  where Mr. Bell sat waiting. The old gentleman was in a sad state of
  agitation, and it was with some difficulty that Hewitt got from him a
  reasonably connected account of the trouble.</p>

  <p>"The loss comes at such a time, Mr. Hewitt," the senior partner explained,
  "that I don't know but it may ruin us utterly, unless my clients' property
  can be recovered. We have had to pay out heavy sums of late to the
  representatives of dead or retiring partners, and other circumstances combine
  with these to make the matter in this way even more terribly serious than the
  very large amount of the loss would seem to suggest. So I beg you will do
  what you can."</p>

  <p>"That of course," responded Hewitt. "But please tell me, as clearly as you
  can, the precise circumstances of the case. Where were the bonds taken
  from?"</p>

  <p>"This safe," Mr. Bell answered, turning toward a very large and heavy one,
  which might almost have been called a small strong room. "They were kept,
  together with others, in this box, one of several, as you see. The box was
  fastened, like the rest, with a Tripp's patent lever padlock, the only key of
  which I kept, together with the key of the safe."</p>

  <p>The box indicated was one of ordinary thin sheet iron, japanned
  black&mdash;something like what is called a deed box.</p>

  <p>"The padlock has been broken open, I see," Hewitt observed.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but I did that myself this morning. It had been blocked up in some
  way, so that the key wouldn't turn&mdash;doubtless in order to cause delay
  when next the box should come to be opened. As it was I might have desisted
  and put off opening it till later, but I had a reason for wishing to refer at
  once to a list which was in the box, and so I decided to break the padlock.
  It was more difficult than one might expect, with such a small padlock."</p>

  <p>"And then you discovered your loss?"</p>

  <p>"Then I discovered the loss, Mr. Hewitt, though it was a mere chance even
  then. For see! All the bonds have not been taken, and those left are placed
  on the top, while the space below is filled with dummies. I hardly know why I
  turned them over&mdash;for the list was at the top&mdash;but I did, and
  then&mdash;&mdash;" Mr. Bell finished with a despairing gesture.</p>

  <p>"And this was some time this morning?"</p>

  <p>"At about half-past eleven."</p>

  <p>"And when did you last open the box before that?"</p>

  <p>"Ten days ago at least, I should think&mdash;and even then the bonds may
  have been gone, for I only opened it to refer to the same list, and I
  examined nothing else."</p>

  <p>"You say that some bonds are left and others are gone. I presume those
  taken are such as would be easy to negotiate, and those left are such as
  would be difficult. Is that the fact?"</p>

  <p>"Precisely."</p>

  <p>"Then the thief evidently knows the ropes, and altogether the matter would
  seem awkward. For anything short of ten days, you see, and quite possibly for
  even a longer time than that, these bonds have been in the undisturbed
  possession of some person who could easily dispose of them, and would
  certainly do so without a moment's delay."</p>

  <p>Mr. Bell nodded sadly. "Quite true," he said.</p>

  <p>"But now tell me a little more. You say you yourself keep the only key of
  the padlock, as well as the key of the safe. So that you open the safe every
  morning yourself and close it at night?"</p>

  <p>"Just so."</p>

  <p>"And do you never entrust the keys to anybody else?"</p>

  <p>"The key of the safe is on a separate bunch from the key of the box. This
  second bunch, with the key of the box, is <i>always</i> in my pocket, and not
  a soul else ever touches it. The other bunch, with the outer key of the safe,
  I sometimes hand to my partner, or to the head clerk, Mr. Foster, if
  something is wanted from the safe when I am busy. Though, as a rule, the safe
  door is open so long as I am about the place. Nothing but the books can be
  taken out without the use of other keys for the drawers and boxes, which I
  keep on the private bunch."</p>

  <p>"And would it be possible for anybody&mdash;anybody at all, mind&mdash;to
  get at that private bunch of keys in such a way, for instance, as to be able
  to take a wax impression of the key of that bond-box?"</p>

  <p>"No, certainly not," Mr. Bell answered with decision. "Certainly not. At
  any rate, not in this office," he added.</p>

  <p>"Ah, not in this office. Anywhere else?"</p>

  <p>"No, nor anywhere else, I should think," the other replied, though this
  time a little more thoughtfully. "There's only my own family at home and the
  servants and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Anybody who has access to this room of the office?" Hewitt asked
  keenly.</p>

  <p>Mr. Bell seemed a little startled.</p>

  <p>"Why, no," he said, "nobody at home comes to the office&mdash;not even a
  visitor, except, of course, my junior partner, who visits the room pretty
  frequently."</p>

  <p>"Very well. You don't remember ever mislaying the keys temporarily, I
  suppose, either here or at home?"</p>

  <p>"No-o," Mr. Bell replied slowly. "I can't say that I do remember anything
  of the sort. No&mdash;and I believe I should be sure to remember if I
  had."</p>

  <p>"Ah! And when you realised your loss what did you do? Told your partner
  first, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;he doesn't know of the discovery. He went out just before I made
  it, and I don't expect him in again to-day." But as Mr. Bell spoke there grew
  plain in his face the pallor of a new fear.</p>

  <p>Martin Hewitt observed it, but kept his thoughts to himself. "Well," he
  said, "you didn't tell your partner. Nor the police?"</p>

  <p>"No, Mr. Hewitt. You see, of course, the first thing the police attempt is
  to catch and punish the thief, and they make the recovery of the property a
  subsidiary object. But for me, Mr. Hewitt, the recovery of the property, as I
  have explained, is the one great consideration. Punish the thief by all
  means, but first save me from ruin, Mr. Hewitt! That is why I sent for you;
  for that, and because I thought it might be advisable to keep the matter
  quiet, till you had taken some steps."</p>

  <p>"There is something in that consideration, certainly. So you have told
  nobody of the loss, except me?"</p>

  <p>"Nobody but Foster, my head clerk&mdash;an old and faithful servant. It
  was he, in fact, who suggested sending for you. As he put it very forcibly,
  you can act for <i>me</i> and my interests, while the police act for
  themselves, and&mdash;very properly, of course, as police&mdash;in the
  interest of the community."</p>

  <p>"Very well. I see you have several clerks in the outer office. Do they
  ever come into this room?"</p>

  <p>"Never, unless they are sent for."</p>

  <p>"If you and your partner were out, and one of the clerks came in
  <i>without</i> being sent for, the rest would know it, of course?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly."</p>

  <p>"I observe three private rooms opening out of this. What are they?"</p>

  <p>"This is a sort of extra inner room where I have private interviews with
  clients&mdash;I was in there with a client for half an hour this morning
  before I discovered the loss. The next is a mere little box of a room where
  the correspondence clerk sits and works. The other is a larger place&mdash;it
  is shared between my partner, Mr. Clarence Dalton, and the head clerk, Mr.
  Foster."</p>

  <p>"Now let me have your broken padlock&mdash;and the key. I see you have
  forced up the front plate with a screw-driver. I will borrow that
  screw-driver, if you please, and force it off completely."</p>

  <p>Hewitt's client produced a screw-driver from a drawer, and in a very few
  moments the interior of the little padlock lay uncovered. Hewitt examined the
  lock attentively for some few minutes, trying the key several times against
  the levers. Then he stood up and said&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Mr. Bell, you have made a mistake. This is not your lock at all!"</p>

  <p>"Not my lock!" exclaimed the broker. "What do you mean? I tell you it is
  the lock of that box, and I broke it open myself!"</p>

  <p>"Yes," answered Hewitt calmly, "it was on that box, and you broke it open
  yourself; but all the same it is not your lock. Let me explain. These are
  very good little padlocks, with an excellent lever action, 'dogged against
  detent,' as the technical phrase goes; so that only the key properly made for
  each lock will open it. They are so good, indeed, as locks, that it would be
  a waste of time to try picking them, when, because of their small size, it is
  so very easy to break them apart, just as you have done yourself, and just as
  I could probably have done in half the time, having had rather more
  experience. Now that is what has been done with <i>your</i> lock by the
  person who has your bonds. But of course a broken lock has one disadvantage
  as compared with a skilfully picked lock&mdash;it shows at the first glance
  what has happened. In this case, Mr. Bell, <i>your</i> lock has been broken
  and taken away, and the thief, having first provided himself with another
  padlock of precisely the same make and size, has substituted <i>that</i>,
  locked it with its proper key and so left it!"</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>"What! Then that was why&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That, of course, was why you supposed it to be out of order when you
  attempted to open it with <i>your</i> key. As a matter of fact, it is even
  now in perfectly good order, except for the damage we have jointly committed
  with the screw-driver. And now, observe! That lock was shut by another key;
  if the man that did that is as sharp as I suppose he is, he will have got rid
  of that key at once. But perhaps he hasn't; and if not, then the man who has
  that key is the thief. At any rate, the key is the clue we must hunt for. Let
  us have your clerks in one by one, and look at their keys. Some are out at
  lunch by this time, probably?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I said they might be wanted, so kept them. I thought you might
  prefer to see them before they went out."</p>

  <p>"Very well thought of, but perhaps scarcely judicious, on the whole.
  Because if there <i>is</i> a guilty person among them it may give him a hint;
  and the odds are rather against its being very useful, considering the
  possibility&mdash;even probability&mdash;that the bonds and the collateral
  evidence left here days ago. But we'll look at their keys, by all means, and
  then they may go to lunch as soon as you please. Let me do the talking, or
  perhaps you'll start a scare. Send for the nearest clerks first, then the
  others. As each comes in, mention his name, so that I can hear it. Say, 'Oh,
  Mr. Brown'&mdash;or Jones, or what not&mdash;'have you some keys about you?'
  Don't mention my name, and I will do the rest. Push to the door of the safe,
  and lock this drawer in the table."</p>

  <p>Mr. Bell did as Hewitt directed, and then called the head clerk, Mr.
  Foster, from his room, with the prescribed inquiry about keys.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Mr. Foster," Hewitt added pleasantly, "I'm not sure that the lock is
  quite in order, but I promised to open it for Mr. Bell, so we'll try."</p>

  <p>Mr. Foster, a slim, active old gentleman, grown grey in the firm's
  service, pulled a bunch of keys from his pocket, and Hewitt scrutinised each
  narrowly. "No," he said, "I'm afraid none of these will do. Stay," he added
  suddenly, and turning his back, carried the bunch to the window. "No," he
  concluded, as he came back to the table and tried one of the keys
  fruitlessly. "No, I'm afraid none of those will do. Thank you, Mr. Foster.
  You don't happen to have any more, do you?"</p>

  <p>No, Mr. Foster hadn't any more, and he retired to his room. Then Mr. Bell
  called the correspondence clerk, Mr. Henning. Mr. Henning was a much younger
  man than the head clerk&mdash;twenty-six or so&mdash;pale and blue-eyed, with
  weak whiskers and a straggling moustache. His keys were just as readily
  produced as Mr. Foster's, but again Hewitt's examination was unsuccessful.
  The only other key he had belonged to the typewriter, and <i>that</i> did not
  fit.</p>

  <p>Then came Mr. Potter, the book-keeper, round, and tubby, and puffy, and
  his keys went under inspection in the same way, taking a little longer this
  time, with two separate dashes to the light of the window. Then there was Mr.
  Robson, young and spruce, Mr. Clancy, older and less tidy, and four or five
  more. All the keys were examined, all with the same lack of success, and all
  the clerks were sent away to take their turns at lunch.</p>

  <p>"No," Hewitt reported, as soon as he and Mr. Bell were alone again, "it
  was certainly none of those keys. Though indeed, my little attempt was
  desperate at best. A man would be a fool to keep <i>that</i> key longer than
  he needed it, and especially to string it with his others. Still, of course,
  it is by just such blunders as that that nine criminals out of ten are
  discovered. And now let me take a good look at that box and its
  contents."</p>

  <p>He lifted the box from the safe to the table, and narrowly scrutinised its
  exterior, especially about the hasp, where the padlock had been. "Either the
  thief was an experienced hand," he said, "or he took some steady practice
  with a few such padlocks as this before setting to work. There are no signs
  of banging about or slipping of tools anywhere."</p>

  <p>"But, of course, banging or anything violent would have been noticed in a
  place like this," Mr. Bell remarked.</p>

  <p>"In office hours, yes," responded Hewitt. "But we mustn't forget that
  office hours are only seven or eight out of the twenty-four."</p>

  <p>"But you don't suspect burglary, do you?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid, as yet, I've precious little ground for suspecting anything
  definite," Hewitt answered; "but we must keep awake to every possibility. Now
  let us see the dummies." He turned them over, and loosened them wherever they
  were tied. "Yes," he remarked, "quite neatly done. Filled in with ordinary
  blank foolscap, such as, no doubt, you have in your office&mdash;but, then,
  it is in every other office, too; every stationer has it by the ream. No
  marks anywhere&mdash;no old newspapers, nothing that could give the shadow of
  a clue." He dropped the last of the papers, and turned to his client. "Mr.
  Bell," he said, "this thing has been thought out to the last inch. There is
  something like genius in this robbery&mdash;if genius is the capacity for
  taking pains. My advice to you is to call in the Scotland Yard people at
  once."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean you can do nothing?" asked Mr. Bell despairingly. "Don't tell
  me that, Mr. Hewitt!"</p>

  <p>"No, I don't mean that," Hewitt answered. "I mean that until I have had
  time to think the thing over very thoroughly I can't tell what I can or ought
  to do. Meantime, I think the police should know; not because I think they can
  see farther into the thing than I can&mdash;for, indeed, I don't think they
  can; but simply because the thief is getting a longer start every moment, and
  the police are armed with powers that are not at my disposal. They can get
  search warrants, stop people at ports and railway stations, arrest
  suspects&mdash;do a score of things that will be necessary. Send to Scotland
  Yard and get Detective Inspector Plummer, if he's available&mdash;he's as
  good a man as they have. Tell him that you've engaged me, or, better still,
  write a note to the Scotland Yard authorities, and let me have it, to send or
  not as I think best, after I have turned the thing over in my mind. I shall
  take one good look round this office, and then run back to my rooms for an
  hour or two's hard consideration of whatever I may see. One or two small
  things I <i>have</i> seen already&mdash;though I'd rather not mention them
  till I've made up my mind how they bear. Matters seem likely to have gone so
  far that perhaps the regular police course of catching the thief first will
  be the best plan, if it can be done. Meantime, it will be my business to keep
  my eye first on the recovery of the bonds. But I think we must have the
  police, Mr. Bell. Now, I'll take my general look round."</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">After Martin Hewitt had rushed off to St. Augustine's
  Hospital with the key, the envelope, and the cypher I had brought him, I
  heard nothing of him till dusk fell&mdash;about six. Then I received this
  telegram:&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
    "Cypher read. Most interesting case. If you can spare an hour be outside
    120 Broad Street at six thirty.&mdash;Hewitt."
  </blockquote>

  <p>I had to be at my office between eight and nine, and to keep Hewitt's
  appointment I should probably have to sacrifice my dinner. But I was
  particularly curious to know the meaning of that cypher, and just as curious
  to know how it could be read; and, moreover, I knew that any case that Hewitt
  called interesting would probably be interesting above the common. So I took
  my hat and sought a cab.</p>

  <p>I was first at the meeting-place&mdash;indeed, a little before my time.
  No. 120 Broad Street was a great new building of offices, most, if not all,
  closed at this time&mdash;a fact indicated by the shutting of one of the
  halves of the big front door, where a char-woman was sweeping the steps under
  the board which announced that offices were to be let. I waited nearly a
  quarter of an hour, and then at last a hansom stopped and deposited Hewitt
  and another older gentleman before me.</p>

  <p><a id="pic13"
     name="pic13"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1403201h-images/Triangle-3-4.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>"Hope we haven't kept you waiting, Brett," Hewitt said. "This is Mr. Bell,
  of Kingsley, Bell and Dalton; it took me a little longer than I expected to
  reach him. His offices are shut, and the clerks all gone, but we are going to
  turn up the lights for a bit. The lift man is gone too, I expect, so we shall
  have a good long stair-climb."</p>

  <p>As to the lift man Hewitt was right, and during our long climb I received,
  briefly, an account of the loss Mr. Bell's firm had suffered. "I have told
  Mr. Bell," Hewitt said, "that it was you who happened across the key in such
  an odd fashion, and when I wired I was sure he would be glad to let you see
  the upshot of your strange bit of luck. I was also pretty sure that you would
  like to see it, too. For I really believe that this case&mdash;which I
  confess seemed pretty near hopeless a few hours ago&mdash;is coming to an
  issue now, and here."</p>

  <p>"Did you get any information out of the man in the hospital?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Not a scrap," Hewitt replied. "He was still insensible, and though I saw
  his clothes, and they told me a good deal about the gentleman's personal
  habits&mdash;which are not dazzlingly noble, to put it mildly&mdash;they told
  me nothing else whatever, except that he had recently been knocked down in
  the mud, which I knew already. But the cypher has told me something, as I
  will explain presently."</p>

  <p>By this time we had reached the high floor in which the offices stood, and
  Mr. Bell, all wonder and pale agitation, unlocked the outer door, and turned
  on the electric light.</p>

  <p>"Now," cried Hewitt, "show me your ventilators!"</p>

  <p>There were some, it seemed, in the top panes of the windows, but these
  were not what Hewitt wanted. There were others in the form of upright
  chambers or flues, made of metal, and painted the same colour as the walls
  about them. They rose from the floor in corners and wall angles, and could be
  shut or opened by means of lids over their upper ends. These were more to
  Hewitt's mind, and he went about from one to another, groping under the lids,
  and poking down into the flues with a walking-stick. There was a
  wire-grating, or diaphragm, it seemed, in each of them, two or three feet
  down, and we could hear the end of the stick raking on this at each
  investigation. One after another of these ventilators Hewitt examined, till
  he had examined them all, in outer and inner rooms, without result; and I
  could see that he was disappointed.</p>

  <p>"There must be another somewhere," he said, and hunted afresh.</p>

  <p>But plainly he had tried them all, and now he could do no more than try
  them all again, with as little result.</p>

  <p>"It <i>is</i> a ventilator," he said, positively. "Unless&mdash;&mdash;"
  he broke off thoughtfully and stood silent for a few moments. "Ah! of
  course!" he resumed presently. "We'll send for the housekeeper and a candle.
  Which is the nearest empty office&mdash;the nearest office to let? Is there
  one on this floor?"</p>

  <p>"I think not," Mr. Bell answered. "But there's one on the floor below,
  just opposite the lift&mdash;I see the bill on the door every day as I come
  up."</p>

  <p>"We'll try that, then. I'll rake out every ventilator in this palatial
  edifice before I'll call myself beaten. Come, call the housekeeper. Is there
  a speaking tube? Tell him to bring a light."</p>

  <p>The housekeeper came, wonderingly, with a watch-man's oil-lantern, and we
  all went to the floor below. Opposite the lift was a glass door from which a
  bill had recently been torn.</p>

  <p>"Why, it's let!" said Mr. Bell.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," assented the housekeeper. "Let a day or two ago to a Mr.
  Catherton Hunt. Or, at least, a deposit was paid."</p>

  <p>"But see&mdash;the door's not locked," Hewitt observed, pushing it open.
  "I think we'll trespass on Mr. Catherton Hunt's new offices, since they seem
  quite empty, and he hasn't taken possession. Come&mdash;ventilators!"</p>

  <p>It was a small office&mdash;an outer room of moderate size, and one
  smaller inner room. Hewitt at once attacked the ventilators in the larger
  apartment&mdash;there were two of them&mdash;but retired disappointed from
  each. There was one ventilator only in the small room. Hewitt tilted the lid,
  which was at about the level of his eyes, thrust in his hand, and drew forth
  a bundle of folded papers; thrust in his hand again and drew forth another
  bundle; did it again, and drew forth more!</p>

  <p>Mr. Bell fell upon the first bundle almost as a dog falls upon a bone; and
  now he snatched eagerly at each successive paper or bundle, till Hewitt raked
  the grating with his stick, and declared that there were no more. "Is that
  all?" he asked.</p>

  <p><a id="pic14"
     name="pic14"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1403201h-images/Triangle-3-5.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>Mr. Bell went tremblingly from paper to paper, and, at last, said that he
  believed it really was. "I can verify it by the list upstairs," he added, "if
  you are sure there are no more."</p>

  <p>"No more," repeated Hewitt, rattling his stick in the ventilator again.
  "Let us go and verify, by all means."</p>

  <p>We sent the puzzled housekeeper away, and returned to the office above,
  and presently Mr. Bell, now beginning so far to recover from his amazement as
  to express incoherent gratitude, reported that the bonds were correct and
  complete to the last and least.</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Hewitt, "then my part of the business is done, though I
  must say I've had luck, or rather, Brett has had it for me. But the police
  must come on now. I think, Mr. Bell, we'll go along to Scotland Yard when we
  leave here. They'll be wanting to see Mr. Catherton Hunt, I expect, whoever
  he is&mdash;and somebody in your office, too, if I'm not sadly mistaken."</p>

  <p>"Who?" gasped Mr. Bell.</p>

  <p>"That, perhaps, you can help to point out. See here&mdash;do you know
  whose figures they are?" and Hewitt produced the small slip of paper
  containing the cypher.</p>

  <p>"They're very small," remarked Mr. Bell, putting on his glasses; "very
  small indeed; but I think&mdash;why they're Henning's, I do believe!"</p>

  <p>"Ah! one or two other little things seemed to point that way. Henning is
  your correspondence clerk, I believe, and I expect this thin little slip is a
  specimen of your typewriter paper. Have you any of his written figures for
  comparison?"</p>

  <p>"Well no&mdash;I hardly think&mdash;you see he typewrites his letters, and
  although I know his writing very well I can't at the moment put my hand on
  any figures of his."</p>

  <p>"Never mind&mdash;it's mere matter of curiosity; the police will ask him
  questions in the morning. What <i>I</i> believe has happened is this. Our
  friend Henning&mdash;if he's the man&mdash;has a friend outside a great deal
  cleverer than himself&mdash;though he would seem to have his share of
  cunning, too. Between them they resolved to rob you in the way they have
  done&mdash;temporarily. Henning was to take advantage of his position in that
  little inner room to get at the safe some day when it was open and when you
  were engaged in your own private inner room with a client, so leaving the
  safe unwatched. He was provided with a spare patent padlock and key, of the
  sort you used on that black box, and his confederate had drilled him in the
  trick of breaking that particular sort of padlock open, with other spare
  specimens. He got his opportunity this morning."</p>

  <p>"Only this morning?"</p>

  <p>"This morning, I think, else we should never have got these bonds back,
  nor even have heard of them again. I think you said you were engaged with a
  client for half an hour?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, from about half-past ten to eleven."</p>

  <p>"That was his chance, and he took it. He broke the padlock, took out the
  bonds, substituted the dummies he had already prepared in his own desk, and
  locked the box again with the new padlock. Meantime Hunt had paid a deposit,
  pending references, on the office below&mdash;the nearest empty room. Of
  course, he wouldn't get the key until the tenancy was finally
  accepted&mdash;which he never intended it should be. But he easily arranged
  to have the door left unlocked for a day or two, on some convenient
  excuse&mdash;arranging decorations, or what not. And the bill was taken down,
  so that prospective and prospecting tenants were kept away. The bonds being
  stolen, Henning took the first opportunity of carrying them to the empty
  office&mdash;probably piecemeal&mdash;a thing he could easily manage almost
  under your nose, before you were aware of your loss. There he was to conceal
  them, either in the chimney, under the boards, or in the ventilator, as he
  might find convenient&mdash;and he found the ventilator most convenient. Then
  he was to apprise his confederate of the fact that the robbery had been
  effected in order that Hunt might come and quietly fetch the plunder away.
  The message was to take an ingenious form. Hunt was to have a fellow waiting
  about in the street, and as soon as Henning could get out&mdash;say to
  lunch&mdash;he was just to <i>send the key</i> by this messenger&mdash;the
  key with which he had locked the new padlock on the black box. You see the
  advantages of that simple arrangement. First, the key, which is evidence, is
  got rid of in a safe and effectual way&mdash;a thing that couldn't be done as
  well by merely flinging it away on or near the premises, where it might be
  found. Next, the message is perfectly secret&mdash;the messenger could never
  guess what the key meant, nor could any other person not in the confederate's
  confidence. And, at the same time, the key tells all that is necessary; the
  robbery has been effected&mdash;come and remove the plunder.</p>

  <p>"But something unforeseen happens. No sooner are the bonds stolen and
  safely hidden than you go to the box, find something wrong with the lock,
  break it open and discover the loss. This was a thing that they trusted would
  not happen till after the bonds were safely got away. More, I am sent for,
  the clerks are kept in from lunch, and so on. Henning gets into a funk, and
  resolves to send a message of special urgency to his confederate. For that
  purpose he uses a cypher which the two have agreed upon&mdash;the most
  ingenious cypher I have ever seen used for the purpose. He doesn't wish to
  make his message any more conspicuous than he need, so he writes his cypher
  on this scrap of paper and rolls it inside the key&mdash;probably another
  expedient agreed upon in case of necessity. Then the key goes into an
  envelope, for greater security of the cypher message, and the messenger gets
  it when Henning is at last released for lunch. What happened to the message
  we know; and here it is.</p>

  <p>"Now I will not weary you with a detailed account of the different ways in
  which I attacked this cypher, but I will take the shortest possible cut to
  the true interpretation. A very short examination of the cryptogram shows
  that while no number is included above 23, the numbers, in their relative
  frequency, roughly agree with the relative frequency of the corresponding
  letters of the alphabet, <i>a</i> for 1, <i>b</i> for 2, and so on."</p>

  <p>Here I handed Hewitt the pencilled note I had made at the hospital, with
  letters substituted for the figures, thus:&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="quote"><i>i, h, n, d, t, r, e, i; 0, s, t, 0, c, i, h, e; c, w, 0,
  0, e, m, n, s; s, t, 0, 0, 0, 0, f, a; e, t, 0, 0, 0, 0, c, v; a, o, 0, 0, 0,
  0, r, e; a, h, t, k, r, i, e, t; l, e, w, n, n, a, a, t.</i></p><br>

  <p>Hewitt took the paper and went on. "If that were all the thing would be
  childishly simple. But you will see that we seem as far from the solution as
  ever; for the letters as they stand mean nothing, though in fact they are in
  normal relative frequency; so that if they mean other letters, all the rules
  are upset, and we are at a standstill. I admit that for a long time the thing
  bothered me. But a peculiarity struck me. Not only were the figures, or
  letters, disposed in groups of <i>eight</i>, but there were also <i>eight</i>
  such groups&mdash;sixty-four altogether. What did that suggest? What but a
  chessboard?"</p>

  <p>"A chessboard?" I queried.</p>

  <p>"Just so&mdash;a chessboard. Eight squares each way&mdash;sixty-four
  altogether. So I drew a rough representation of a chessboard, and set out the
  letters on it, in their order, like this:&mdash;</p>
  <pre>
i h n d t r e i
o s t o c i h e
c w o o e m n s
s t o o o o f a
e t o o o o c v
a o o o o o r e
a h t k r i e t
l e w n n a a t
</pre>

  <p>"Now, there was my chessboard with my letters on it. I tried reading them
  downward, across, upward and diagonally, in the direction of the moves of
  different chess pieces&mdash;king, queen, rook and bishop. Nothing came of
  that, whatever I did; the thing was as unreadable as ever. But there remained
  one chess-move to try&mdash;the eccentric move of the knight; the move of one
  square forward, backward or sideways, and then one square diagonally, or, as
  it has sometimes been more concisely expressed, the move to the next square
  but one of a different colour from that on which it rests. I tried the
  knight's move, and I read the cypher.</p>

  <p>"I began at the top left-hand corner, just as one does in reading a book.
  I read the moves downward&mdash;<i>i</i> to <i>w</i>, <i>e</i> and <i>h</i>,
  and found that led to nothing. So I took the one alternative move, and, with
  a little consideration, skipped along from <i>i</i> to <i>t</i> in the second
  line of squares, <i>t</i> in the top line, <i>h</i> in the second line,
  <i>e</i> in the third, <i>r</i> in the top and <i>e</i> in the second. That
  gave me an idea. There were the letters <i>i, t, t</i>, followed by the word
  <i>here</i>. I tried back from the <i>i</i> again, and taking in the reverse
  order the <i>w, e</i> and <i>h</i> which I had first given up, I read my own
  name, as you can see it, from the <i>h</i> on the bottom line but one, moving
  upward. So I had the words <i>Hewitt here</i>. I need not carry you through
  all the steps, which will now be plain enough to you. But I found that the
  message actually began in the <i>right</i>-hand corner, and read thus, the
  noughts counting for nothing&mdash;</p>

  <p>"<i>'Invent loss disc take at once Martin Hewitt here fear watch.'</i></p>

  <p>"The noughts were plainly merely inserted to fill in unneeded squares, and
  keep the rest of the figures in their proper relative places when the cypher
  was written in line. At first I was a little puzzled to understand what
  seemed to be the first word <i>invent</i>. But it was quite clear that
  <i>loss disc</i> meant 'loss discovered,' so I concluded that here in the
  beginning was a contraction also, and that <i>in</i> was a separate word. In
  that case <i>vent</i> could be a contraction for no other word but
  'ventilator,' in accordance with the sense of the words. So I concluded that
  the meaning of the whole sentence was simply this: 'The plunder is in the
  ventilator, the loss is discovered, take away the booty at once; Martin
  Hewitt is here, and I fear I may be watched.' There is the reading, and our
  little adventure this evening is what it has led to.</p>

  <p>"Of course, the confederate wouldn't go groping about the squares so
  painfully as I have had to do. To him the reading would be simple enough, for
  the order of the moves would be preconcerted. Each of the conspirators would
  have, as a guide, both to reading and writing the cypher, a drawn set of
  squares, numbered in the order of the moves&mdash;1 where we have the
  <i>i</i>, 2 where we have the <i>n</i>, 3 where we have the <i>v</i>, and so
  on. With that before him, either reading or writing in this extraordinary
  cryptogram would be easy and quick enough. And now for Scotland Yard!"</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p class="first">We learned late on the following day that Henning had not
  appeared at the office. From that we assumed that he must have met his
  confederate in the evening, and, finding that he had not received the message
  sent, conceived that something was wrong, and made himself safe. The
  confederate, Hunt, however, made his appearance early next morning, but
  escaped.</p>

  <p>What happened is best told in Plummer's words when he called on Hewitt in
  the afternoon.</p>

  <p>"I went round this morning," he said, "as I said I would last night. I
  took a good man with me, and we got the dummy bonds that had been put in
  Bell's box and popped 'em in the ventilator, where the real ones had been
  hidden. You see, we'd got nothing <i>legal</i> against Catherton Hunt as yet,
  but if we could only grab him with those dummy bonds on him it might help,
  with the other evidence we could scrape up (and especially if we could take
  Henning), to sustain a charge of conspiracy to steal. Well, he came so quick
  he was on us before we were quite ready. We'd got the dummies in their place,
  and I was in front of the door telling my man the likeliest corner to wait
  in, when suddenly up pops the lift right in front of me, with a gentleman in
  it&mdash;clean-shaven. I looked at him and he looked at me. I had a sort of
  distant notion that I might have seen him before, and it's pretty certain he
  had something more than a distant notion about me. 'Down again,' he says to
  the lift man, before the gate was swung, 'I've forgotten something!' And down
  the lift went. You'll understand I had no idea he was the man we wanted; but
  as the lift went down and my eyes were on the man's face, I saw who he was!
  When he stood straight before me I had no more than a vague notion that I'd
  seen him somewhere before. But down the lift went, and in the flash of time
  when he'd nearly disappeared, and the bottom part of his face was hidden by
  the sill of the lift opening&mdash;the part of his face where his beard had
  been when we met him last&mdash;I saw it was Myatt!"</p>

  <p>"Myatt? Good heavens!"</p>

  <p>"Everard Myatt, Mr. Hewitt, the man that murdered Mr. Jacob Mason! Everard
  Myatt, for a thousand, with his beard shaved! And we've lost him again! What
  could we do? We shouted and ran downstairs, and that was all. He'd gone, of
  course. And when we asked the hall porter he told us that Mr. Catherton Hunt
  had just come down the lift and hurried out!"</p>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Harmsworth London Magazine</i>, February
  1903</h3>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">EVERARD MYATT&mdash;or Catherton Hunt&mdash;was lost again.
  Martin Hewitt had been wholly successful, for he had recovered Mr. Bell's
  missing bonds; but the police caught neither of the conspirators.
  Investigation at Henning's lodgings showed that careful preparations must
  have been made for an immediate flight if it should become necessary, and the
  flight had taken place. The man in the hospital, who had been knocked down in
  carrying from one to the other the extraordinary message that Hewitt
  deciphered, remained insensible for a few days, and could not be questioned
  till some time later still. Then he professed to have forgotten all about the
  message on which he was going when he met his accident, and the medical men
  in attendance informed the police that it was quite possible that the
  fellow's statement was true. He said that he <i>did</i> carry messages
  sometimes, when he could get a job, but he could remember nothing of the
  message of the key, nor of who had sent him, nor where he was to go.
  Nevertheless, the police, although they professed to accept his statement,
  kept a wary eye on him after his discharge from the hospital, for they had a
  very great suspicion that he knew more than he chose to tell. But nothing
  more was heard of the accomplices till another case of Martin Hewitt's
  brought the news, and that in a manner strange enough.</p>

  <p>The matter began, as so many matters of Hewitt's did, with the receipt of
  a telegram, followed immediately by another. For the first having been handed
  in at a country office not very long before eight the previous evening, it
  was not delivered at Hewitt's office till the morning, in accordance with the
  ancient manners and customs observed in the telegraphic system of this
  country. It had been despatched from Throckham, in Middlesex, and it was
  simply a very urgently worded request to Hewitt to come at once, signed
  "Claire Peytral." The second telegram, which came even as Hewitt was reading
  the first, on his arrival at his office, ran thus:&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
    "Did you receive telegram? See newspapers. Matter life or death. Would come
    personally but cannot leave mother. Pray answer.&mdash;Peytral."
  </blockquote>

  <p>The answer went instantly that Hewitt would come by the next train, for he
  had seen the morning paper and from that knew the urgency of the case. But a
  consultation of the railway guide showed that trains to Throckham were fewer
  than one might suppose, considering the proximity of the village to London,
  and that the next would leave in about an hour and a quarter; so that I saw
  Hewitt before he started. He came up to my rooms, in fact, as I was beginning
  to breakfast.</p>

  <p>"See here," he said, "I am sent for in the Throckham case. Have you seen
  the report?"</p>

  <p>As a leader writer, I had little business with the news side of my paper,
  and indeed I had no more than a vague recollection of some such heading as:
  "Tragedy in a barn," in one evening paper of the day before, and "Murder at
  Throckham" in another. So I could claim no very exact knowledge of the
  affair.</p>

  <p>"Here you have a paper, I see," Hewitt said, reaching for it. "Perhaps
  their report is fuller than that in mine." He gave me his own newspaper and
  began searching in the other. "No," he said presently, "much the same. News
  agency report to both papers, no doubt."</p>

  <p>The report which I read ran as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
    "Singular Tragedy.&mdash;An extraordinary occurrence is reported from
    Throckham, a small village within fifteen miles of London, involving a
    tragic fatality that has led to a charge of murder. On Thursday evening an
    old barn, for some time disused, was discovered to be on fire, and it was
    only by extraordinary exertions on the part of the villagers that the fire
    was extinguished. Upon an examination of the place yesterday morning the
    body of Mr. Victor Peytral, a gentleman who had lived in the neighbourhood
    for some time, and who had been missing since shortly before the discovery
    of the fire, was found in the ruins. The body was burnt almost beyond
    recognition, but not so much as to conceal the fact that the unfortunate
    gentleman had not perished in the fire, but had been the victim of foul
    play. The throat was very deeply cut, and there can be no doubt that the
    murderer must have fired the barn with the object of destroying all traces
    of the crime. The police have arrested Mr. Percy Bowmore, a frequent
    visitor at the house of the deceased."
  </blockquote>

  <p>"My telegram," said Hewitt, "is plainly from a relative of this Mr.
  Peytral who is dead&mdash;perhaps a daughter, since she speaks of being
  unable to leave her mother. In that case, probably an only child, since there
  is no other to leave."</p>

  <p>"Unless the others are too young," I suggested.</p>

  <p>"Just so," Hewitt replied. "Well, Brett," he added, "to-day is
  Saturday."</p>

  <p>Saturday was, of course, my "off" day, and I understood Hewitt to hint
  that if I pleased I might accompany him to Throckham. "Saturday it is," I
  said, "and I have no engagements. Would you care for me to come?"</p>

  <p>"As you please, of course. I can guess very little of the case as yet,
  naturally, beyond what I have read in the paper; but the subtle sense of my
  experience tells me that there is all the chance of an interesting case in
  this. That's <i>your</i> temptation. As for myself, I don't mind admitting
  that&mdash;especially in these country cases, where the resources of
  civilisation are not always close at hand&mdash;I'm never loth to have a
  friend with me who isn't too proud to be made use of. That's <i>my</i>
  temptation!"</p>

  <p>No persuasion was needed, and in due time we set out together.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">It is my experience that places are to be found within
  twenty miles of London far more rural, far sleepier, far less influenced by
  the great city that lies so near, than places thrice and four times as far
  away. They are just too far out to be disturbed by suburban traffic, and too
  near to feel the influence of the great railway lines. These main lines go
  by, carrying their goods and their passengers to places far beyond, and it is
  only by awkward little branch lines, with slow and rare trains, that any part
  of this mid-lying belt is reached, and even then it is odds but that one must
  drive a good way to his destination.</p>

  <p>Throckham was just such a place as I speak of, and that was the reason why
  we had such ample time to catch the first of the half-dozen leisurely trains
  by which one might reach the neighbourhood during the day. The station was
  Redfield, and Throckham was three miles beyond it.</p>

  <p>At Redfield a coachman with a dogcart awaited Hewitt&mdash;only one
  gentleman having been expected, as the man explained, in offering to give
  either of us the reins. But Hewitt wished to talk to the coachman, and I
  willingly took the back seat, understanding very well that my friend would
  get better to work if he first had as many of the facts as possible from a
  calm informant before discussing them with the dead man's relations, probably
  confused and distracted with their natural emotions.</p>

  <p>The coachman was a civil and intelligent fellow, and he gave Hewitt all he
  knew of the case with perfect clearness, as I could very well hear.</p>

  <p>"It isn't much I can tell you, sir," he said, "beyond what I expect you
  know. I suppose you didn't know Mr. Peytral, my master, that's dead?"</p>

  <p>"No. But he was a foreigner, I suppose&mdash;French, from the name."</p>

  <p>"Well, no, sir," the coachman replied, thoughtfully; "not French exactly,
  I think, though sometimes he talked French to the mistress. They came from
  somewhere in the West Indies, I believe, and there's a trifle of&mdash;well,
  of dark blood in 'em, sir, I should think; though, of course, it ain't for me
  to say."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;there are many such families in the French West Indies. Did you
  ever hear of Alexandre Dumas?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir, can't say I did."</p>

  <p>"Well, he was a very great Frenchman indeed, but he had as much 'dark
  blood' as your master had&mdash;probably more; and it came from the West
  Indies, too. But go on."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Peytral, you must understand, sir, has lived here a year or
  two&mdash;I've only been with him nine months. He talked English
  always&mdash;as good as you or me; and he was always called <i>Mr.</i>
  Peytral&mdash;not Monsieur, or Signor, or any o' them foreign titles. I think
  he was naturalised. Mrs. Peytral, she's an invalid&mdash;came here an
  invalid, I'm told. She never comes out of her bedroom 'cept on an invalid
  couch, which is carried. Miss Claire, she's the daughter, an' the only one,
  and she was hoping you'd ha' been down last night, sir, by the last train.
  She's in an awful state, as you may expect, sir."</p>

  <p>"Naturally, to lose her father in such a terrible way."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, but it's wuss than that even, for her. You see, this Mr.
  Bowmore, that they've took up, he's been sort of keepin' company with Miss
  Claire for some time, an' there's no doubt she was very fond of him. That
  makes it pretty bad for her, takin' it both ways, you see."</p>

  <p>"Of course&mdash;terrible. But tell me how the thing happened, and why
  they took this Mr. Bowmore."</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, it ain't exactly for me to say, and, of course, I don't know
  the rights of it, bein' only a servant, but they say there was a sudden
  quarrel last night between Mr. Peytral and Mr. Bowmore. I think myself that
  Mr. Peytral was getting a bit excitable lately, whatever it was. On Thursday
  night, just after dinner, he went strolling off in the dusk, alone, and
  presently Mr. Bowmore&mdash;he came down in the afternoon&mdash;went
  strolling off after him. It seems they went down toward the Penn's Meadow
  barn, Mr. Peytral first, and Mr. Bowmore catching him up from behind. A man
  saw them&mdash;a gamekeeper. He was lyin' quiet in a little wood just the
  other side of Penn's Meadow, an' they didn't see him as they came along
  together. They were quarrelling, it seems, though Grant&mdash;that's the
  gamekeeper&mdash;couldn't hear exactly what about; but he heard Mr. Peytral
  tell Mr. Bowmore to go away. He 'preferred to be alone' and he'd 'had enough'
  of Mr. Bowmore, from what Grant could make out. 'Get out o' my sight, sir, I
  tell you!' the old gentleman said at last, stamping his foot, and shaking his
  fist in the young gentleman's face. And then Bowmore turned and walked
  away."</p>

  <p>"One moment," Hewitt interposed. "You are telling me what Grant saw and
  heard. How did it come to your knowledge?"</p>

  <p>"Told me hisself, sir&mdash;told me every word yesterday. Told me twice,
  in fact. First thing in the morning when they found the body, and then again
  after he'd been to Redfield and had it took down by the police. It was
  because of that they arrested Mr. Bowmore, of course."</p>

  <p>"Just so. And is this gamekeeper Grant in the same employ as
  yourself?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, sir! Mr. Peytral's is only just an acre or two of garden and a
  paddock. Grant's master is Colonel White, up at the Hall."</p>

  <p>"Very good. You were saying that Mr. Peytral told Mr. Bowmore to get out
  of his sight, and that Mr. Bowmore walked away. What then?"</p>

  <p>"Well, Grant saw Mr. Bowmore walk away, but it was only a feint&mdash;a
  dodge, you see, sir. He walked away to the corner of the little wood where
  Grant was, and then he took a turn into the wood and began following Mr.
  Peytral up, watching him from among the trees. Came close by where Grant was
  sitting, following up Mr. Peytral and watching him; and so Grant lost sight
  of 'em."</p>

  <p>"Did Grant say what he was doing in the wood?"</p>

  <p>"He said he'd found marks of rabbit-snares there, and he was watching to
  see if anybody came to set any more."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;quite an ordinary part of his duty, of course. What next?"</p>

  <p>"Well, Grant didn't see any more. He waited a bit, and then moved off to
  another part of the wood, and he didn't notice anything else particular till
  the barn was on fire. It was dark, then, of course."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;you must tell me about the fire. Who discovered it?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, a man going home along the lane. He ran and called some people, and
  they fetched the fire-engine from the village and pumped out of the
  horse-pond just close by. It was pretty much of a wreck by the time they got
  the fire out, but it wasn't all gone, as you might have expected. You see, it
  had been out of use for some time, sir, and there was mostly nothing but old
  broken ploughs and lumber there; and what's more, there was a deal of rain
  early in the week, as you may remember, sir, so the thatch was pretty sodden,
  being out o' repair and all&mdash;and so was the timber, for the matter o'
  that, for there's no telling when it was last painted. So the fire didn't go
  quite so fierce as it might, you see; else I should expect it had been all
  over before they got to work on it."</p>

  <p>"Not at all a likely sort of place to catch fire, it would seem, either,"
  Hewitt commented. "Old ploughs and such lumber are not very combustible."</p>

  <p>"Quite so, sir; that's what makes 'em think it so odd, I suppose. But
  there <i>was</i> a bundle or two of old pea-straw there, shied in last
  summer, they say, being over bundles from the last load, and there left."</p>

  <p>"And when was Mr. Bowmore seen next?"</p>

  <p>"He came strolling back, sir, and told the young lady he'd left her father
  outside, or something of that sort, I think; said nothing of the quarrel, I
  believe. But he said the barn was on fire&mdash;which he must have known
  pretty early, sir, for 'tis a mile from the house off that way;" and the
  coachman pointed with his whip.</p>

  <p>"Nothing was suspected of the murder, it seems, till yesterday
  morning?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir. Miss Claire got frightful worried when her father didn't come
  home, as you would expect, and specially at him not coming home all night.
  But when the fire was quite put out, o' course the people went away home to
  bed, and it wasn't till the morning that anybody went in to turn the place
  over. Then they found the body."</p>

  <p>"Badly burnt, I believe?"</p>

  <p>"Horrid burnt, sir. If it wasn't for Mr. Peytral's being missing, I doubt
  if they'd have known it was him at all. It took a doctor's examination to see
  clear that the throat had been cut. But cut it had been, and deep, so the
  doctor said. And now the body's gone over to Redfield mortuary."</p>

  <p>Hewitt asked a few questions more, and got equally direct answers, except
  where the coachman had to confess ignorance. But presently we were at the
  house to which Hewitt had been summoned.</p>

  <p>It was a pleasant house enough, standing alone, apart from the village, a
  little way back from a loop of road that skirted a patch of open green. As we
  came in at the front gate, I caught an instant's glimpse of a pale face at an
  upper window, and before we could reach the drawing-room door Miss Claire
  Peytral had met us.</p>

  <p>She was a young lady of singular beauty, which the plain signs of violent
  grief and anxiety very little obscured. Her complexion, of a very delicate
  ivory tinge, was scarcely marred by the traces of sleeplessness and tears
  that were nevertheless clear to see. Her eyes were large and black, and her
  jetty hair had a slight waviness that was the only distinct sign about her of
  the remote blend of blood from an inferior race.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Mr. Hewitt," she cried, "I am so glad you have come at last! I have
  been waiting&mdash;waiting so long! And my poor mother is beginning to
  suspect!"</p>

  <p>"You have not told her, then?"</p>

  <p>"No, it will kill her when she knows, I'm sure&mdash;kill her on the spot.
  I have only said that father is ill at&mdash;at Redfield. Oh, what shall I
  do?"</p>

  <p><a id="pic16"
     name="pic16"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1403201h-images/Triangle-4-2.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>The poor girl seemed on the point of breakdown, and Hewitt spoke sharply
  and distinctly.</p>

  <p>"What you must do is this," he said. "You must attend to me, and tell me
  all I want to know as accurately and as tersely as you can. In that case I
  will do whatever I can, but if you give way you will cripple me. It all
  depends on you, remember. This is my intimate friend, Mr. Brett, who is good
  enough to offer to help us. Now, first, I think I know the heads of the case,
  from the newspapers, and, more especially, from your coachman. But when you
  sent for me, no doubt you had some definite idea or intention in your mind.
  What was it?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, he is innocent, Mr. Hewitt&mdash;he is, really! The only friend I
  have in the world&mdash;the only friend we all have!"</p>

  <p>"Steady&mdash;steady," Hewitt said, pressing her kindly and firmly into a
  seat. "You <i>must</i> keep steady, you know, if I am to do anything. I
  expected that would be your belief. Now tell me why you are so sure."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Hewitt, if you knew him you wouldn't ask. He would never injure my
  poor father&mdash;he went out after him purely out of kindness, because I was
  uneasy. He would never hurt him, Mr. Hewitt, never, never! I can't say it
  strongly enough&mdash;he never would! Oh! my poor father, and
  now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Steady again!" cried Hewitt, more sharply still. I could see that he
  feared the hysterical breakdown that might come at any moment after the
  lengthened suspense Miss Peytral had suffered. "Listen, now&mdash;you mustn't
  frighten yourself too much. If Mr. Bowmore is innocent&mdash;and you say you
  are so certain of it&mdash;then I've no doubt of finding a way to prove it if
  only you'll make your best effort to help me, and keep your wits about you.
  As far as I can see at present there's nothing against him that we need be
  afraid of if we tackle it properly, and, of course, the police make arrests
  of this sort by way of precaution in a case like this, on the merest hint.
  Come now, you say you were uneasy when your father went out after dinner on
  Thursday night. Why?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know, quite, Mr. Hewitt. It was my mother that was uneasy,
  really, about something she never explained to me. My father had taken to
  going out in the evening after dinner, just in the way he did on Thursday
  night. I don't know why, but I think it had something to do with my mother's
  anxiety."</p>

  <p>"Did he dress for dinner?"</p>

  <p>"No, not lately. He used to dress always, but he has dropped it of
  late."</p>

  <p>Hewitt paused for a moment, thoughtfully. Then he said, "Mrs. Peytral is
  an invalid, I know, and no doubt none the better for her anxiety. But if it
  could be managed I should like to ask her a few questions. What do you
  think?"</p>

  <p>But this Miss Peytral was altogether against. Her mother was suffering
  from spinal complaint, it appeared, with very serious nervous complications,
  and there was no answering for the result of the smallest excitement. She
  never saw strangers, and, if it could possibly be avoided, it must be avoided
  now.</p>

  <p>"Very well, Miss Peytral, I will first go and look at some things I must
  see, and I will do without your mother's help as long as I possibly can. But
  now you must answer a few more questions yourself, please."</p>

  <p>Hewitt's questions produced little more substantial information, it seemed
  to me, than he had already received. Mr. Peytral had taken the house in which
  we were sitting&mdash;it was called "The Lodge" simply&mdash;two years ago.
  Before that the family had lived in Surrey, but they had not moved direct
  from there; there was a journey to America between, on some business of Mr.
  Peytral's, and it was on the return voyage that they had met Mr. Percy
  Bowmore. Mr. Bowmore had no friends nearer than Canada, and he was reading
  for the Bar&mdash;in a very desultory way, as I gathered. Miss Peytral's
  childhood had been passed in the West Indies, at the town of San Domingo, in
  fact, where her father had been a merchant. Her mother had been a helpless
  invalid ever since Miss Peytral could remember. As to the engagement with
  Bowmore, it would seem to have had the full approval of both parents all
  along. But a rather curious change had come over her father, she thought, a
  few months ago. What it was that had caused it she could not say, but he grew
  nervous and moody, often absent-minded, and sometimes even short-tempered and
  snappish, a thing she had never known before. Also he read the daily papers
  with much care and eagerness. It was plain that Miss Peytral had no idea of
  any cause which might have led to a quarrel between Bowmore and her father,
  and Hewitt's most cunning questions failed to elicit the smallest suggestion
  of reason for such an occurrence.</p>

  <p>Ten days or so ago, Mr. Peytral had returned from a short walk after
  dinner, very much agitated; and from that day he had made a practice of going
  out immediately after dinner every evening regularly, walking off across the
  paddock, and so away in the direction of Penn's Meadow. The first visit of
  Percy Bowmore after this practice had begun was on Thursday, but the presence
  of the visitor made no difference, as Miss Peytral had expected it would. Her
  father rose abruptly after dinner and went off as before; and this time Mrs.
  Peytral, who had been brought down to dinner, displayed a singular uneasiness
  about him. She had experienced the same feeling, curiously enough, on other
  occasions, Miss Peytral remarked, when her husband had been unwell or in
  difficulties, even at some considerable distance. This time the feeling was
  so strong that she begged Bowmore to hurry after Mr. Peytral and accompany
  him in his walk. This the young man had done; but he returned alone after a
  while, saying simply that he had lost sight of Mr. Peytral, whom he had
  supposed might have come home by some other way; and mentioning also that he
  had been told that Penn's Meadow barn was on fire.</p>

  <p>When it grew late, and Mr. Peytral failed to return, Bowmore went out
  again and made inquiry in all directions. It grew necessary to concoct a
  story to appease Mrs. Peytral, who had been taken back to her bedroom.
  Bowmore spent the whole night in fruitless search and inquiry, and then, with
  the morning, came the terrible news of the discovery in the burnt barn; and
  late in the afternoon Bowmore was arrested.</p>

  <p>The poor girl had a great struggle to restrain her feelings during the
  conversation, and, at its close, Hewitt had to use all his tact to keep her
  going. Physical exhaustion, as well as mental trouble, were against her, and
  stimulus was needed. So Hewitt said, "Now you must try your best, and if you
  will keep up as well as you have done a little longer, perhaps I may have
  good news for you soon. I must go at once and examine things. First, I should
  like to have brought to me every single pair of boots or shoes belonging to
  your father. Send them, and then go and look after your mother. Remember, you
  are helping all the time."</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">Hewitt examined the boots and shoes with great rapidity, but
  with a singularly quick eye for peculiarities.</p>

  <p>"He liked a light shoe," he said, "and he preferred to wear shoes rather
  than boots. There are few boots, and those not much worn, although he was
  living in the country. Trod square on the right foot, inward on the left, and
  wore the left heel more than the right. It's plain he hated nails, for these
  are all hand-sewn, with scarcely as much as a peg visible in the lot; and
  they are all laced, boots and shoes alike. Come, this is the best-worn pair;
  it is also a pair of the same sort the maid tells me he must have been
  wearing, since they are missing; low shoes, laced; we'll take them with
  us."</p>

  <p>We left the house and sought our friend the coachman. He pointed out quite
  clearly the path by which his master had gone on his last walk; showed us the
  gate, still fastened, over which he had climbed to gain the adjoining meadow,
  and put us in the way of finding the small wood and the barn.</p>

  <p>Both within and without the gate there was a small patch bare of grass,
  worn by feet; and here Martin Hewitt picked up his trail at once.</p>

  <p>"The ground has hardened since Thursday night," he said; "and so much the
  better&mdash;it keeps the marks for us. Do you see what is here?"</p>

  <p>There were footmarks, certainly, but so beaten and confused that I could
  make nothing of them. Hewitt's practised eye, however, read them as I might
  have read a rather illegibly written letter.</p>

  <p>"Here is the right foot, plain enough," he said, carefully fitting the
  shoe he had brought in the mark. "He alighted on that as he came over the
  gate. Half over it is another footmark&mdash;Bowmore's, I expect, for I can
  see signs of others, in both directions&mdash;going and coming. But we shall
  know better presently."</p>

  <p>He rose, and we followed the irregular track across the meadow. Like most
  such field-tracks, its direction was plainly indicated by the thin and beaten
  grass, with a bare spot here and there. Hewitt troubled to take no more than
  a glance at each of these spots as we passed, but that was all he needed. The
  meadow was bounded by a hedge, with a stile; and at the farther side of this
  stile my friend knelt again, with every sign of attention.</p>

  <p>"A little piece of luck," he reported. "The left shoe has picked up a tiny
  piece of broken thorn-twig just here. See the mark? The shoe was a little
  soddened in the sole by this time, and the thorn stuck. I hope it stuck
  altogether. If it did it may help us wonderfully when we get to the barn, for
  the trouble there will be the trampling all round of the people at the
  fire."</p>

  <p>So we went on till we reached the edge of the little wood. The field-path
  skirted this, and here Hewitt dropped on his knees and set to work with great
  minuteness.</p>

  <p>"Keep away from the track, Brett," he warned me, "or you may make it
  worse. The police have been here, I see, and quite recently, coming from the
  direction of Redfield. Here are two pairs of unmistakable police boots and
  another heavy pair with them; no doubt they brought the gamekeeper along with
  them, to have things fully explained."</p>

  <p>From the corner of the wood to a point forty yards along the path; back to
  the corner again, and then into the wood Hewitt went, carefully examining
  every inch of the ground as he did so. Then at last he rejoined me.</p>

  <p>"I think the gamekeeper has told the truth," he said. "It's pretty plain,
  thanks to the soft ground hereabout, notwithstanding the policemen's boots.
  Here they came together&mdash;the thorn-twig sticks to the shoe still, you
  see&mdash;and here they stopped. The marks face about, and Bowmore's steps
  are retraced to the corner of the wood. Peytral's turn again and go on, and
  Bowmore's turn into the edge of the wood and come along among the trees. You
  don't see them in the grassy parts quite as well as I do, I expect, but there
  they are. We'll keep after Peytral's prints. Bowmore's come back in the same
  track, I see."</p>

  <p>The next stile led to Penn's Meadow. This meadow&mdash;a large
  one&mdash;stretched over a rather steep hump of land, at the other side of
  which the barn stood. From the stile two paths could be discerned&mdash;one
  rising straight over the meadow in the direction of the barn, and the other
  skirting it to the left, parallel with the hedge.</p>

  <p>"Here the footprints part," Hewitt observed, musingly; "and what does that
  mean? Man[oe]uvring&mdash;or what?"</p>

  <p>He thought a moment, and then went on: "We'll leave the tracks for the
  present and see the barn. That is straight ahead, I take it."</p>

  <p>When we reached the top of the rise the barn came in view, a blackened and
  sinister wreck. The greater part of the main structure was still standing,
  and even part of the thatched roof still held its place, scorched and broken.
  Off to the right from where we stood the village roofs were visible, giving
  indication of the position of the road to Redfield. A single human figure was
  in sight&mdash;that of a policeman on guard before the barn.</p>

  <p>"Now we must get rid of that excellent fellow," said Hewitt, "or he'll be
  offering objections to the examination I want to make. I wonder if he knows
  my name?"</p>

  <p>We walked down to the barn, and Hewitt, assuming the largest possible air,
  addressed the policeman.</p>

  <p>"Constable," he said, "I am here officially&mdash;here is my card. Of
  course you will know the name if you have had any wide
  experience&mdash;London experience especially. I am looking into this case on
  behalf of Miss Peytral&mdash;co-operating with the police, of course. Where
  is your inspector?"</p>

  <p>He was a rather stupid countryman, this policeman, but he was visibly
  impressed&mdash;even flurried&mdash;by Hewitt's elaborate bumptiousness. He
  saluted, tried to look unnaturally sagacious, and confessed that he couldn't
  exactly say where the inspector was, things being put about so just now. He
  might be in Throckham village, but more likely he was at Redfield.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" Hewitt replied, with condescension. "Now, if he is in the village,
  you will oblige me, constable, by telling him that I am here. If he is not
  there, you will return at once. I will be responsible here till you come
  back. Don't be very long, now."</p>

  <p>The man was taken by surprise, and possibly a trifle doubtful. But Hewitt
  was so extremely lofty and so very peremptory and official, that the inferior
  intelligence capitulated feebly, and presently, after another uneasy salute,
  the village policeman had vanished in the direction of the road. The moment
  he had disappeared Hewitt turned to the ruined barn. The door was gone, and
  the scorched and charred lumber that littered the place had a look of
  absolute ghostliness&mdash;perhaps chiefly the effect of my imagination in
  the knowledge of the ghastly tragedy that the place had witnessed. Well in
  from the doorway was a great scatter of light ashes&mdash;plainly the
  pea-straw that the coachman had spoken of. And by these ashes and partly
  among them, marked in some odd manner on the floor, was a horrible black
  shape that I shuddered to see, as Hewitt pointed it out with a moving
  forefinger, which he made to trace the figure of a prostrate human form.</p>

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>"Did you never see that before in a burnt house?" Hewitt asked in a hushed
  voice. "I have, more than once. That sort of thing always leaves a strange
  stain under it, like a shadow."</p>

  <p>But business claimed Martin Hewitt, and he stepped carefully within.
  Scarcely had he done so, when he stood suddenly still, with a low whistle,
  pointing toward something lying among the dirt and ashes by the foot of that
  terrible shape.</p>

  <p>"See?" he said. "Don't disturb anything, but look!"</p>

  <p>I crept in with all the care I could command, and stooped. The place was
  filled with such a vast confusion of lumber and cinder and ash that at first
  I failed to see at all what had so startled Hewitt's attention. And even when
  I understood his direction, all I saw was about a dozen little wire loops,
  each a quarter of an inch long or less, lying among a little grey ash that
  clung about the ends of some of the loops in clots. Even as I looked another
  thing caught Hewitt's eye. Among the straw-ashes there lay some cinders of
  paper and card, and near them another cinder, smaller, and plainly of some
  other substance. Hewitt took my walking-stick, and turned this cinder over.
  It broke apart as he did so, and from within it two or three little charred
  sticks escaped. Hewitt snatched one up and scrutinised it closely.</p>

  <p>"Do you see the tin ferrule?" he said. "It has been a brush; and that was
  a box of colours!" He pointed to the cinder at his feet. "That being so," he
  went on, "that paper and card was probably a sketch-book. Brett! come outside
  a bit. There's something amazing here!"</p>

  <p>We went outside, and Hewitt faced me with a curious expression that for
  the life of me I could not understand.</p>

  <p>"Suppose," he said, "<i>that Mr. Victor Peytral is not dead after
  all</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Not dead?" I gasped; "but&mdash;but he is! We know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It seems to me," Hewitt pursued, with his eyes still fixed on mine, "that
  we know very little indeed of this affair, as yet. The body was
  unrecognisable, or very near it. You remember what the coachman said? 'If it
  wasn't for Mr. Peytral's being missing,' he said, 'I doubt if they'd have
  known it was him at all.' I think those were his exact words. More, you must
  remember that the body has not been seen by either of Peytral's
  relatives."</p>

  <p>"But then," I protested, "if it isn't his body whose is it?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, indeed," Hewitt responded, "whose is it? Don't you see the
  possibilities of the thing? There's a colour-box and a sketch-book burned.
  Who carried a colour-box and a sketch-book? Not Peytral, or we should have
  heard of it from his daughter; she made a particular point of her father's
  evening strolls being quite aimless, so far as her knowledge or conjecture
  went; she knew nothing of any sketching. And another thing&mdash;don't you
  see what <i>those</i> things mean?" He pointed toward the place of the little
  wire loops.</p>

  <p>"Not at all."</p>

  <p>"Man, don't you see they've been boot-buttons? When the boots shrivelled,
  the threads were burnt and the buttons dropped off. Boot-buttons are made of
  a sort of composition that burns to a grey ash, once the fire really gets
  hold of them&mdash;as you may try yourself, any time you please. You can see
  the ash still clinging to some of the shanks; and there the shanks are, lying
  in two groups, six and six, as they fell! Now Peytral came out in laced
  shoes."</p>

  <p>"But if Peytral isn't dead, where is he?"</p>

  <p>"Precisely," rejoined Hewitt, with the curious expression still in his
  eyes. "As you say, where is he? And as you said before, who is the dead man?
  Who is the dead man, and where is Peytral, and why has he gone? Don't you see
  the possibilities of the case <i>now</i>?"</p>

  <p>Light broke upon me suddenly. I saw what Hewitt meant. Here was a possible
  explanation of the whole thing&mdash;Peytral's recent change of temper, his
  evening prowlings, his driving away of Bowmore, and lastly, of his
  disappearance&mdash;his flight, as it now seemed probable it was. The case
  had taken a strange turn, and we looked at one another with meaning eyes. It
  might be that Hewitt, begged by the unhappy girl we had but just left to
  prove the innocence of her lover, would by that very act bring her father to
  the gallows.</p>

  <p>"Poor girl!" Hewitt murmured, as we stood staring at one another. "Better
  she continued to believe him dead, as she does! Brett, there's many a good
  man would be disposed to fling these proofs away for the girl's sake and her
  mother's, seeing how little there can be to hurt Bowmore. But justice must be
  done, though the blow fall&mdash;as it commonly does&mdash;on innocent and
  guilty together. See, now, I've another idea. Stay on guard while I try."</p>

  <p>He hurried out toward the farther side of the broad band of trampled
  ground which surrounded the burnt barn, and began questing to and fro, this
  way and that, receding farther from me as he went, and nearing the horse-pond
  and the road. At last he vanished altogether, and left me alone with the
  burnt barn, my thoughts, and&mdash;that dim Shape on the barn floor. It was
  broad day, but I felt none too happy; and I should not have been at all
  anxious to keep the police watch at night.</p>

  <p>Perhaps Hewitt had been gone a quarter of an hour, perhaps a little more,
  when I saw him again, hurrying back and beckoning to me. I went to meet
  him.</p>

  <p>"It's right enough," he cried. "I've come on his trail again! There it is,
  thorn-mark and all, by the roadside, and at a stile&mdash;going to
  Redfield&mdash;probably to the station. Come, we'll follow it up! Where's
  that fool of a policeman? Oh, the muddle they <i>can</i> make when they
  really try!"</p>

  <p>"Need we wait for him?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, better now, with those proofs lying there; and we must tell him not
  to be bounced off again as I bounced him off. There he comes!"</p>

  <p>The heavy figure of the local policeman was visible in the distance, and
  we shouted and beckoned to hurry him. Agility was no part of that policeman's
  nature, however, and beyond a sudden agitation of his head and his shoulders,
  which we guessed to be caused by a dignified spasm of leisurely haste, we saw
  no apparent acceleration of his pace.</p>

  <p>As we stood and waited we were aware of a sound of wheels from the
  direction of Redfield, and as the policeman neared us from the right, so the
  sound of wheels approached us from the left. Presently a fly hove in
  sight&mdash;the sort of dusty vehicle that plies at every rural railway
  station in this country; and as he caught sight of us in the road the driver
  began waving his whip in a very singular and excited manner. As he drew
  nearer still he shouted, though at first we could not distinguish his words.
  By this time the policeman, trotting ponderously, was within a few yards. The
  passenger in the fly, a thin, dark, elderly man, leaned over the side to look
  ahead at us, and with that the policeman pulled up with a great gasp and
  staggered into the ditch.</p>

  <p>"'Ere 'e is!" cried the fly-driver, regardless of the angry remonstrances
  of his fare. "'Ere 'e is! 'E's all right! It ain't 'im! 'Ere he is!"</p>

  <p><a id="pic18"

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1403201h-images/Triangle-4-4.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>"Shut your mouth, you fool!" cried the angry fare. "<i>Will</i> you stop
  making a show of me?"</p>

  <p>"Not me!" cried the eccentric cabman. "I don't want no fare, sir! I'm
  drivin' you 'ome for honour an' glory, an' honour an' glory I'll make it!
  'Ere 'e is!"</p>

  <p>Hewitt took in the case in a flash&mdash;the flabbergasted policeman, the
  excited cabman and the angry passenger. He sprang into the road and cried to
  the cabman, who pulled up suddenly before us.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Victor Peytral, I believe?" said Martin Hewitt.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," answered the dark gentleman snappishly, "but I don't know
  you!"</p>

  <p>"There has been a deal of trouble here, Mr. Peytral, over your absence
  from home, as no doubt you have become aware; and I was telegraphed for by
  your daughter. My name is Hewitt&mdash;Martin Hewitt."</p>

  <p>Peytral's face changed instantly. "I know your name well, Mr. Hewitt," he
  said. "There's a matter&mdash;but who is this?"</p>

  <p>"My friend, Mr. Brett, who is good enough to help me to-day. If I may
  detain you a moment, I should like a word with you aside."</p>

  <p>"Certainly."</p>

  <p>Mr. Peytral alighted, and the two walked a little apart.</p>

  <p>I saw Hewitt talking and pointing toward the burnt barn, and I well
  guessed what he was saying. He was giving Peytral warning of what he had
  discovered in the barn, explaining that he must give the information to the
  police, and asking if, in those circumstances, Peytral wished to go home, or
  to make other arrangements. Often Hewitt's duty to his clients and his duty
  as a law-upholding citizen between them put him in some such delicate
  position.</p>

  <p>But there was no hesitation in Mr. Victor Peytral. Plainly he feared
  nothing, and he was going home.</p>

  <p>"Very well, then," I heard Hewitt say as they turned towards us, "perhaps
  we had better go on slowly and let my friend cut across the fields first to
  break the news. Brett&mdash;I knew you would be useful, sooner or later."</p>

  <p>And so I hurried off, with the happy though delicate mission to restore
  both father and lover to Miss Claire Peytral.</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p class="first">Miss Peytral had to be put to bed under care of a nurse, for
  the revulsion was very great, and so was her physical prostration. Bowmore,
  now set free, and in himself a very pleasant young fellow, came with hurried
  inquiries and congratulations, and then rushed off to London to cable to his
  friends in Canada, for fear of the effect of newspaper telegrams.</p>

  <p>When at last Hewitt and I sat with Mr. Peytral in his study, "Mr. Hewitt,"
  said Peytral, "I am not sure how far explanations may go between us. There is
  more in that death in the barn than the police will ever guess."</p>

  <p>Peytral was haggard and drawn, for, as he had let slip already, he had
  scarce slept an hour since leaving home on Thursday.</p>

  <p>"I am tired," he said, "and worn out, but that is not a novelty with me;
  and I'm not sure but we may be of use to each other. Did my daughter tell you
  why she sent Mr. Bowmore after me on Thursday night?"</p>

  <p>Hewitt explained the thing as briefly as possible, just as he had heard it
  from Miss Peytral.</p>

  <p>"Ah," said Peytral, thoughtfully. "So she thought my manner became moody a
  few months back. It did, no doubt, for I had memories; and more, I had
  apprehensions. Mr. Hewitt, I think I read in the papers that you were in some
  way engaged in the extraordinary case of the murder of Mr. Jacob Mason?"</p>

  <p>"That is quite correct. I was."</p>

  <p>"There was another case, a little while before, which possibly you may not
  have heard of. A man was found strangled near the York column, by Pall Mall,
  with just such a mark on his forehead as was found on Mr. Mason's."</p>

  <p>"I know that case, too, as well as the other."</p>

  <p>"Do you know the name of the murderer?"</p>

  <p>"I think I do. We speak in confidence, of course, as client and
  professional man?"</p>

  <p>"Of course. What was his name?"</p>

  <p>"I have heard two&mdash;Everard Myatt and Catherton Hunt."</p>

  <p>"Neither is his real name, and I doubt if anybody but himself knows it.
  Twenty years ago and more I knew him as Mayes. He was a Jamaican. Mr. Hewitt,
  that man's foul life has been justly forfeit a thousand times, but if it
  belongs to anybody it belongs to me!"</p>

  <p><a id="pic19"
     name="pic19"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1403201h-images/Triangle-4-5.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>It was terrible to see the sudden fiery change in the old man. His
  lassitude was gone in a flash, his eyes blazed and his nostrils dilated.</p>

  <p>For a little while he sat so, his mouth awork with passion; then he sank
  back in his chair with a sigh.</p>

  <p>"I am getting old," he said, more quietly, "and perhaps I am not strong
  enough to lose my temper.... Well, as I said, Mayes was a Jamaican, a
  renegade white. Do you remember that in the black rebellion of 1865, there
  was a traitorous white man among the negroes? Eyre hanged a few rebels, and
  rightly, but the worst creature on all that island escaped&mdash;probably
  escaped by the aid of that very white skin that should have ensured him a
  greater punishment than the rest. He escaped to Hayti. Now you have probably
  heard something of Hayti, and of the common state of affairs there?"</p>

  <p>We both had heard, and, indeed, the matter had been particularly brought
  to Hewitt's notice by the case which I have told elsewhere as "The Affair of
  the Tortoise." As for me, I had read Sir Spenser St. John's book on the black
  republic, and I had been greatly impressed by the graphic picture it gives of
  the horrible, blood-stained travesty of regular government there prevailing.
  Nothing in the worst of the South American Republics is to be remotely
  compared to it. In the worst periods there was not a crime imaginable that
  could not be, and was not, committed openly and with impunity by anybody on
  the right side of the so-called "government"; and the "government" was
  nothing but an organised crime in itself.</p>

  <p>"Well," Peytral pursued, "then I need not expatiate on it, and you will
  understand the sort of place that Mayes fled to, and how it suited him. He
  was a man of far greater ability than any of the coarse scoundrels in power,
  and he was worse than all of them. He was not such a fool as to aim at
  ostensible political power&mdash;that way generally led to assassination. He
  was the jackal, the contriver, the power behind the throne, the instigator of
  half the devilry set going in that unhappy place, and he profited by it with
  little risk; he was the confidential adviser of that horrible creature
  Domingue. If you know anything of Hayti you will know what that means.</p>

  <p>"At this time I was comparatively a young man, and a merchant at
  Port-au-Prince. It was a bad place, of course, and business was risky enough,
  but, for that very reason, profits were large, and that was an attraction to
  a sanguine young man like myself. I did very well, and I had thoughts of
  getting out of it with what I had made. But it was a fatal thing to be
  supposed wealthy in Port-au-Prince, unless you were a villain in power, or
  partner with one. I was neither, and I was judged a suitable victim by Mayes.
  Not I alone, either&mdash;no, nor even only I and my fortune. Gentlemen,
  gentlemen, my poor wife, who now lies&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Peytral's utterance failed him. He rose as if choking, and Hewitt rose to
  quiet him. "Never mind," he said, "sit quiet now. We understand. Rest a
  moment."</p>

  <p>The old man sank back in his chair, and for a little while buried his face
  in his hands. Then he went on.</p>

  <p>"I needn't go into details," he said, huskily. "It is enough to say that
  every devilish engine of force and cunning was put in operation against me.
  So it came that at last, on a hint from a hanger-on of the police-office, who
  had enough humanity in him to remember a kindness he had experienced at my
  hands, that we took flight in the middle of the night&mdash;my poor wife,
  myself, and our three children, with nothing in the world but our bare lives
  and the clothes we wore. I might have tried to get aboard a foreign ship in
  the harbour, but I knew that would be useless. I should have been given up on
  whatever criminal charge Mayes chose to present, and my wife and children
  with me. I had hope of somehow getting to San Cristobel, where I had a
  friend&mdash;over the border in the other Government of the island, the
  Dominican Republic. That was eighty miles away and more, across swamps, and
  forests and mountains. Well, we did it&mdash;we did it. We did it, Mr.
  Hewitt, and I dream of it still. They hunted us, sir&mdash;hunted us with
  dogs. We hid from them a whole day among the rank weeds&mdash;up to our
  shoulders in the water of a pestilential fever-swamp; Claire, the baby, on
  her mother's back, and both the boys on mine. They died&mdash;they died next
  day. My two beautiful boys, gentlemen, died in my arms, and I was too weak
  even to bury them!"</p>

  <p>There was another long pause, and the man's head was bowed in his hands
  once more. Presently he went on again, but at first without lifting his
  head.</p>

  <p>"We did it, gentlemen," he said&mdash;"we did it. We crawled into San
  Cristobel at the end of five days; and from that moment my dear wife has
  never once stood upright on her feet. So we came out of it, and the baby,
  Claire, was the one that suffered least. She was too young to understand, and
  her mother&mdash;her mother saved her, when I could not save the boys!"</p>

  <p>He paused again, and presently sat up, pale, but in full command of
  himself. "You will excuse me, gentlemen, I am sure, and make allowances for
  my feelings," he said. "There is not a great deal more to tell. Mayes did not
  last long in Hayti. Domingue was overthrown, and Mayes left the island, I was
  told, and made for another part of the world. Years afterward I heard of his
  being in China, though what truth there may have been in the rumour I cannot
  say.</p>

  <p>"My friend in San Cristobel&mdash;he was a cousin, in fact&mdash;put me on
  my legs again, and after a while he helped me to begin business at San
  Domingo, under my present name, Peytral, which, in fact, was my mother's
  maiden name. There came a sudden push in trade with the United States about
  this time, and I went into my affairs with the more energy to distract my
  thoughts. In fifteen years&mdash;to cut a long story short&mdash;I had made
  the small competency which I have brought to England with me, with the idea
  of a peaceful end to my life and my wife's; though I doubt if I am to have
  that now. I doubt it, and I will tell you why. Mr. Hewitt, when I went away
  without warning on Thursday night I was dogging Mayes!"</p>

  <p>Hewitt nodded, with no sign of surprise. "And the man killed in the
  barn?"</p>

  <p>"That is one more of his thousand crimes, without a doubt. Though it
  differs. Do you know what drew my attention to the murders of the men Denson
  and Mason, and so set me thinking? In each case the murder was by
  strangulation, and the medical evidence at the inquests showed that it was
  effected by means of a tourniquet. In fact, in the second case, the
  tourniquet itself was left behind."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Hewitt replied, "I loosened it myself&mdash;but, unfortunately, I
  was too late."</p>

  <p>"Well, now," Peytral went on, "in Hayti, in my time, Mayes's enemies had a
  habit of dying suddenly in the night, by strangulation, and a tourniquet was
  always the instrument. And just as murder was quite a popular procedure in
  that accursed place, so strangulation by tourniquet became for a while the
  most common form of the crime. It was rapid, effective, and silent, you see.
  So that a murder by tourniquet, quite an unknown thing in this country, took
  my attention at once, and when another followed it so soon, I felt something
  like certainty. And the triangle was suggestive, too."</p>

  <p>"Were Mayes's victims marked in that way in Hayti?"</p>

  <p>"No, there was no mark. But"&mdash;here Mr. Peytral's features assumed a
  curious expression&mdash;"there are things which are not believed in this
  country&mdash;which are laughed at, in fact, and called superstition. You
  know something of Hayti, and therefore you must have heard of
  Voodoo&mdash;the witchcraft and devil-worship of the West Indies. Well, Mayes
  was as deep in that as he was in every other species of wickedness. It sounds
  foolish, perhaps, here in civilised England, and you may laugh, but I tell
  you that Mayes could make men do as he wished, with their consent or against
  it! And he used a thing&mdash;it was generally known that he used a thing
  marked with a triangle&mdash;a Red Triangle&mdash;by the use of which he
  could bend men to his will!"</p>

  <p>Hewitt was listening intently, with no sign of laughter at all,
  notwithstanding his client's apprehension. And I remembered the case of Mr.
  Jacob Mason, and how that victim had so fervently expressed his wish to the
  excellent clergyman, Mr. Potswood, that he had never dabbled in the strange
  devilries of Myatt&mdash;or Mayes, as we were now learning to call him.</p>

  <p>"At any rate," Peytral resumed, "you will understand that the conjunction
  of the tourniquet with the Red Triangle in the two cases you know of caused
  me some excitement. My daughter, as you have said, noticed a change in my
  habits from that time; my wife did more&mdash;she knew the reason. Mr.
  Hewitt, I am an older man, but there is hotter blood in my veins than in
  yours. My father was English&mdash;though you might scarcely suppose
  it&mdash;but my mother, to whose name I have reverted, was a French Creole.
  So perhaps my natural instincts come nearer to those of our savage ancestry
  than do yours. Whether or not you will understand me I do not know, but I can
  tell you that even now, in cold blood&mdash;for my paroxysm has exhausted
  itself and me&mdash;it seems to me that it would be my duty, not to say my
  sacred duty, to tear that man to pieces with my hands whenever and wherever I
  could put them on him! My old passions may have slept, I find, but they are
  alive still, and I found them waking when I realised that Mayes was alive and
  in England. The words 'sane' and 'insane' are elastic in their application,
  but I doubt if you would have called me strictly sane of late. I evolved mad
  schemes for the destruction of this wretch, and I was ready to devote myself
  and everything I possessed to the purpose. More than once I contemplated
  coming to you&mdash;seeing that you had met the man in one of his
  villainies&mdash;with the idea of enlisting your aid. But I reflected that
  you would probably make yourself no party to a plan of private revenge, and I
  hesitated. And then&mdash;then, a little more than a week ago, I saw the man
  himself! Changed, without doubt, but not half as much changed as I am myself.
  Nevertheless, sure as I am of him now, I hesitated then. For it was here in
  the meadow that you know, near the barn, and the thing seemed so likely to be
  illusion that I almost suspected my senses. It was dusk, and he was walking
  and talking with another man, a good deal younger. And presently, while I was
  still confounded with surprise, and as they passed behind a clump of trees,
  Mayes was gone, and I saw his companion alone. He was a young man&mdash;an
  artist, it would seem, with sketch-book and colours."</p>

  <p>I started, and Hewitt and I glanced at each other. Peytral saw it and
  paused. "Never mind," said Hewitt. "Please go on."</p>

  <p>"After that I came out every night, in the hope of seeing my enemy again.
  On several evenings I saw the young artist waiting by the barn expectantly,
  but nobody joined him. I found that this young man was lodging at a cottage
  in the village, and I resolved not to lose sight of him.</p>

  <p>"At last, on Thursday night, I saw Mayes again. Mr. Bowmore was here, and
  when I left the house he troubled me much by coming after me. I was obliged
  to tell him that I wished to be alone, and I was in a nervously explosive
  state when I did it. He seemed reluctant to go; my anger blazed out, and I
  violently ordered him off. From what he has told me it seems that he followed
  me still, but lost sight of me near Penn's Meadow. Well, be that as it may, I
  saw Mayes and the young artist again. I watched from a rather awkward spot,
  and dusk was falling, so that I could not see all that passed; but presently
  I was aware that Mayes was making off by the road alone, and I followed
  him.</p>

  <p>"From that moment I think I really was mad, though my madness did not
  drive me to attack him at once. I had a feeling of curiosity to see where he
  would go, and a curious cruel idea of letting him run for a little
  first&mdash;as a cat feels, I suppose, with a mouse. You may judge that I was
  not in my normal state of mind from the fact that all through yesterday and
  part of to-day I never as much as thought of telegraphing home to say that I
  had gone to London. For it was to London I followed him. I took no ticket at
  the station&mdash;I got on the platform by stealth, and entered the train
  unobserved, for he and one boy were the only passengers, and I feared
  attracting attention. It was easy enough, in such a station as Redfield, and
  I paid my fare at London. And after all I lost him! Lost him in London!"</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"Like a fool. I saw him enter a house, and waited. Followed him again, and
  waited at another. I might have flung him into the river from the Embankment,
  and I refrained. And then&mdash;whether it began at a dark corner or in a
  group of people I cannot tell, but I suddenly discovered that I was following
  a stranger&mdash;a stranger of about Mayes's form and stature. It was what I
  should have expected, and provided for, in London streets at night!</p>

  <p>"If I have been mad, it was then I was worst. I suppose by that time it
  must have been too late to get back home, but I never thought of that. I ran
  the streets the whole night, like a fool, hunting for Mayes. I kept on all
  day yesterday. I waited and watched hours at the two houses he had visited;
  and it was not till early this morning that I flung myself on a bed in a
  private hotel in Euston Road. I slept a little, and my paroxysm was over.
  Perhaps I am more fortunate than I am disposed to think, since I am as yet in
  no danger of trial for murder."</p>

  <p>This passionate, wayward, stricken man was plainly the object of
  fascinated interest to Hewitt. My friend waited a moment, and then
  said&mdash;"The houses he called at&mdash;I should like to know them. And
  where you lost sight of him."</p>

  <p>Peytral sat back, and gazed thoughtfully for fully half a minute in
  Hewitt's face. "Do you know," he said at length, "I don't think I'll answer
  that question now. I'd like to leave it for a day or two. Yesterday I
  wouldn't have told you, even on the rack&mdash;no, not a word! I should have
  said, 'Take your own chances, and get him if you can. As for me, I consider
  him <i>my</i> prey, and what scent I have picked up I shall use myself!' A
  mad fancy, you will think, perhaps. For me the question is, was I sanest then
  or now? I will take a day or two to think."</p>

  <h3>V</h3>

  <p class="first">In less than a day or two the identity of the victim of the
  burnt barn was established. For Hewitt had his idea, and he communicated with
  Plummer, of Scotland Yard. The man with the buttoned boots and the
  sketch-book was the artist who had been staying at the cottage in the
  village, but who, singularly enough, had never been seen to draw, and had
  left no drawings behind him. He had warned the people of the cottage that he
  might be away for a night or two, and he had stayed away for two nights
  before; so that his disappearance did not disturb them, and when they heard
  that Mr. Peytral's body had been found in the barn they accepted the news as
  fact. They recognised at once a photograph produced by Plummer as that of
  their late lodger. And the photograph had been procured from Messrs.
  Kingsley, Bell and Dalton, the intended victims in the bond case, and it was
  one of Henning, their vanished correspondence clerk!</p>

  <p>That his death would be convenient to Mayes, the greater scoundrel, was
  plain enough. The bond robbery had been brought to naught, thanks to Martin
  Hewitt, and Henning was now useless. Worse, he might be caught, or give
  himself up, and was thus a perpetual danger. And probably he wanted money.
  This being so, it was a singular fact that at the inquest the surgeon who had
  examined the wound gave it as his most positive opinion that it had been
  self-inflicted. And it was inflicted with a razor, Henning's own, as was very
  clearly proved after inquiry. For the razor was found in the barn by the
  police, entangled with the blackened frame of an old lantern. Here was still
  another puzzle; one to which the final revelation of the mystery of the Red
  Triangle gave an answer, as will be seen in due place.</p>

  <h2><a id="story5"
     name="story5"></a>V. &mdash; THE CASE OF THE ADMIRALTY CODE</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Harmsworth London Magazine</i>, March 1903</h3>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">QUICK on the heels of the case of the Burnt Barn followed
  the next of the Red Triangle affairs. Indeed, the interval was barely two
  days. Mr. Victor Peytral, it will be remembered, had declined to reveal to
  Hewitt the addresses of the two houses in London which he had seen Mayes
  visit, desiring to think the matter over for a few days first; but before any
  more could be heard from him, news of another sort was brought by Inspector
  Plummer.</p>

  <p>It may give some clue to the period whereabout the whole mystery of the
  Red Triangle began to be cleared up if I say that at the time of Plummer's
  visit this country was on the very verge of war with a great European State.
  It is a State with which the present relations of England are of the
  friendliest description, and, since the dreaded collision was happily
  averted, there is no need to particularise in the matter now, especially as
  the name of the country with which we were at variance matters nothing as
  regards the course of events I am to relate. Though most readers will
  recognise it at once when I say that the war, had it come to that, would have
  been a naval war of great magnitude; and that during the time of tension
  swift but quiet preparations were going forward at all naval depôts, and
  movements and dispositions of our fleet were arranged that extended to the
  remotest parts of the ocean.</p>

  <p>It was at the height of the excitement, and, as I have said, two days
  after the return of Hewitt and myself from Throckham, when the case of the
  Burnt Barn had been disposed of, that Detective-Inspector Plummer called. I
  was in Hewitt's office at the time, having, in fact, called in on my way to
  learn if he had heard more from Mr. Victor Peytral, for, as may be imagined,
  I was as eager to penetrate the mystery of the Triangle as Hewitt
  himself&mdash;perhaps more so, since Hewitt was a man inured to mysteries. I
  had hardly had time to learn that Peytral had not yet made up his mind so far
  as to write, when Plummer pushed hurriedly into the room.</p>

  <p>"Excuse my rushing in like this," he said, "but your lad told me that it
  was Mr. Brett who was with you, and the matter needs hurry. You've heard no
  more of that fellow&mdash;Myatt, Hunt, Mayes, whatever his name is
  last&mdash;since the barn murder, of course? Has Peytral given you the tip he
  half promised?"</p>

  <p>Hewitt shook his head again. "Brett has this moment come to ask the same
  question," he said. "I have heard nothing."</p>

  <p>"I must have it," said Plummer, emphatically. "Do you think he will tell
  me?"</p>

  <p>Hewitt shook his head again. "Scarcely likely," he said. "He's an odd
  fellow, this Mr. Peytral&mdash;a foreigner, with revenge in his blood. I have
  done him and his daughter some little service, and he told me all his private
  history; but he seemed even then disposed to keep Mayes to himself and let
  nobody interfere with his own vengeance. But I will wire if you like. What is
  it?"</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you," said Plummer, pushing the door close behind him. "I'll
  tell you&mdash;in confidence, of course&mdash;because you've seen more of
  this mysterious rascal than I have, and&mdash;equally in confidence, of
  course&mdash;Mr. Brett may hear, too, since he's been in several of the cases
  already. Well, of course, we all know well enough that we want this
  creature&mdash;Mayes, we may as well call him, I suppose, now&mdash;for three
  murders, at least, to say nothing of other things. That's all very well, and
  we might have got him with time. But now we want him for something else; and
  it's such a thing that <i>we must have him at once</i>, or else"&mdash;and
  Plummer pursed his lips and snapped his fingers significantly. "We can't wait
  over this, Mr. Hewitt; <i>we've got to have that man to-day</i>, if it can be
  done. And there's more than ordinary depending on it. It's the country this
  time. The Admiralty telegraphic code has been stolen!"</p>

  <p>"By Mayes?"</p>

  <p>Plummer shrugged his shoulders. "That's to be proved," he said; "but he
  was seen leaving the office at about the time the loss occurred, and that's
  enough to set me after him; and there's not another clue of any sort. Mr.
  Hewitt, I wish you were in the official service!"</p>

  <p>Hewitt smiled. "You flatter me," he said, "as you have done before. But
  why in this case particularly?"</p>

  <p>"It's a case altogether out of the ordinary, and one of a string of such,
  all of which you have at your fingers' ends. And I don't mind confessing that
  this man Mayes is a little too big a handful for one&mdash;for me, at any
  rate. I wish you could work with me over this; in fact, in the special
  circumstances I've a good mind to ask to have you retained, as an exceptional
  measure. But the thing's urgent, and there's red-tape!"</p>

  <p>Hewitt had taken a glance at his desk tablet, which he now flung down.</p>

  <p>"I'll do it for love," he said, "if necessary. My appointment list is
  uncommonly slack just now, and even if it weren't, I'd make a considerable
  sacrifice rather than be out of this. This fellow Mayes is a dangerous man;
  and I feel it a point of honour that he shall not continue to escape.
  Moreover, I have begun to form a certain theory as to the Red Triangle, and
  all there is at the back of it&mdash;a theory I would rather keep to myself
  till I see a little more, since as it stands it may only strike you as
  fantastic, and if it is wrong it may lead some of us off the track; but it is
  a theory I wish to test to the end. So I'm with you, Plummer, if you'll allow
  it; and you can make your official application for a special retainer or not,
  just as you please."</p>

  <p>Plummer was plainly delighted.</p>

  <p>"Most certainly I will," he said. "Shall I give you the heads of the case,
  or will you come to the Admiralty and see for yourself?"</p>

  <p>"Both, I think," said Hewitt. "But first I will send a telegram to
  Peytral. Then you can give me the heads of the case as we go along, and I
  will look at the place for myself. I am in this case heart and soul, pay or
  no pay&mdash;and I expect my friend Brett would like to be in it, too. Is
  there any objection?"</p>

  <p>"Well," Plummer answered, a little doubtfully, "we're glad of outside
  help, of course, but I'm not sure, officially&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of course you are always glad of outside help," Hewitt interrupted, "and
  in this case we may possibly find Brett more useful than you think. Consider
  now. He has seen a good deal of these cases&mdash;quite as much as you, in
  fact&mdash;but he is the only one of the three of us whom Mayes does not know
  by sight. Remember, Mayes saw us both in the affair of Mr. Jacob Mason, and
  he saw you again in the case of the Lever Key&mdash;escaped, in fact, because
  he instantly recognised you. I'll answer for Brett's discretion, and I'm sure
  he'll be glad to help, even if, for official reasons, you may not find it
  possible to admit him wholly into your counsels."</p>

  <p>Of course I willingly assented, and the conditions understood, Plummer
  offered no further objection. Hewitt despatched his telegram, and in a very
  few minutes we were in a cab on the way to the Admiralty.</p>

  <p>"This is the way of it," Plummer said. "You will remember that when we
  lost Mayes at the end of the Lever Key case, I was waiting for him in that
  city office, with an assistant, and that we only saw him for an instant in
  the lift. Well, that assistant was a very intelligent man of mine, named
  Corder&mdash;a fellow with a wonderful memory for a face. Now Corder is on
  another case just now, and we'd put him on, dressed like a loafer, to hang
  about Whitehall and the neighbourhood, watching for some one we want. Well,
  this morning there came an urgent message to the Yard from the Admiralty, to
  ask for a responsible official at once, and I was sent. As I came along I saw
  Corder lounging about, and of course I took no notice&mdash;it would not do
  for us people from the Yard to recognise each other too readily in the
  street. But Corder came up, and made pretence to ask me for a match to light
  his pipe; and under cover of that he told me that he had seen Mayes not an
  hour before, coming out of the Admiralty. At this, of course, I pricked up my
  ears. I didn't know what they wanted me for, but if there was mischief, and
  that fellow had been there, it was likely at least that he might have been in
  it. Corder was quite positive that it was the man, although he had only seen
  him for a moment in the lift. He hadn't seen him go into the Admiralty
  office, but he was passing as he came out, and noted the time exactly, so
  that he might report to me at the first opportunity. The time was 11.32, and
  Mayes jumped into a hansom and drove off. He walked right out into the middle
  of the road to stop the hansom&mdash;you know how wide the road is
  there&mdash;so that Corder couldn't hear his direction to the cabman, but he
  took the number as the cab went off. Corder ought to have collared him then
  and there, I think, but he was in a difficult position. It would have
  endangered the case he was on, which is very important; and besides, he
  didn't realise how much we wanted him for, having only been brought in as an
  assistant at the tail of our bond case. Still less did he guess&mdash;any
  more than myself&mdash;what I was going to hear at the Admiralty office."</p>

  <p>"At any rate," interrupted Hewitt, "you've got the number of the cab?"</p>

  <p>"Here it is," Plummer answered, "and I've already set a man to get hold of
  the cabman. You'd better note the number&mdash;92,873."</p>

  <p>Hewitt duly noted the number, and advised me to do the same, in case I
  should chance to meet the cab during the afternoon; and as we neared our
  destination Plummer gave us the rest of the case in outline.</p>

  <p>"In the office," he said, "I found them in a great state. A copy of the
  code, or cypher, in which confidential orders and other messages are sent to
  the fleet all over the world, and in which reports and messages are sent
  back, had disappeared during the morning. It was in charge of a Mr. Robert
  Telfer, a clerk of responsibility and undoubted integrity. He kept it in a
  small iron safe, which is let into the wall of his private room. It was safe
  when he arrived in the morning, and he immediately used it in order to code a
  telegram, and locked it in the safe again at 10.20. Two hours later, at
  12.20, he went to the safe for it again, in order to de-code a message just
  received, and it was gone! And the lock of the safe is one that would take
  hours to pick, I should judge. There isn't a shade of a clue, so far as I can
  see, except this circumstance of Mayes being seen leaving by
  Corder&mdash;just between Telfer's two visits to the safe, you perceive. And
  of course there may be nothing in that, except for the character of the man.
  And that's all there is to go on, as far as I can see. I needn't tell you how
  important the thing is at a time like this, and how much would be paid for
  that secret code by a certain foreign Government. We have made hurried
  arrangements to have certain places watched, and as soon as I have taken you
  to the office I must rush off and make a few more arrangements still. But
  here we are."</p>

  <p>Mr. Robert Telfer's room was at the side of a long and gloomy corridor on
  the upper floor, and the door was distinguished merely by a number and the
  word "Private" painted thereon. We found Mr. Telfer sitting alone, and
  plainly in a state of great nervous tension. He was a man of forty or
  thereabout, thin, alert, and using a single eye-glass. Plummer introduced us
  by name, and rapidly explained our business.</p>

  <p>"I told you the name of the party I am after, Mr. Telfer," Plummer said,
  "and I went straight to Mr. Martin Hewitt, as being most likely to have
  information of him. Mr. Hewitt, whose name you know already, of course, is
  kind enough, seeing we're in a bad pinch, and pushed for time, to come in and
  give us all the help he can. Both he and his friend, Mr. Brett, know a good
  deal of the doings of the person we're after, and their assistance is likely
  to be of the very greatest value. Do you mind giving Mr. Hewitt any
  information he may ask? I must rush over to the Yard to put some other
  inquiries on foot, and to set an observation or two, but I'll be back
  presently."</p>

  <p>"Certainly," Mr. Telfer answered, "I'm only too anxious to give any
  information whatever&mdash;so long as it is nothing departmentally
  forbidden&mdash;which will help to put this horrible matter right. Please ask
  me anything, and be patient if my answers are not very clear. I have been
  much overworked lately, as you may imagine, and have had very little sleep;
  and now this terrible misfortune has upset me completely; for, of course, I
  am held responsible for that copy of the code, and if it isn't recovered, and
  quickly, I am ruined&mdash;to say nothing, of course, of the far more serious
  consequences in other directions."</p>

  <p>"That is the safe in which it was kept, I presume?" Hewitt said,
  indicating a small one let into the wall. "May I examine it?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly." Mr. Telfer turned and produced the keys from his pocket. "The
  code was here, lying on this shelf when I needed it this morning at ten. I
  took it out, used it, returned it to the same place exactly, and locked the
  safe door. Then I took the draft of the telegram, together with the copy in
  cypher, into the Controller's room, gave it into safe hands, and returned
  here."</p>

  <p>Hewitt narrowly examined the lock of the safe with his pocket lens. "There
  are no signs of the lock having been picked," he said, "even if that were
  possible. As a matter of fact, this is a lock that would take half a day to
  pick, even with a heavy bag of tools. No, I don't think that was the way of
  it. You have no doubt about locking the safe door at 10.20, I suppose, before
  you went to the Controller's room?"</p>

  <p><a id="pic20"
     name="pic20"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1403201h-images/Triangle-5-1.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>"No possible doubt whatever. You see, I left the whole bunch of keys
  hanging in the lock while I coded the telegram. It was a short one, and was
  soon done. Then I returned the code to its place, locked the safe, and then
  used another key on the bunch to lock a drawer in this desk. I had no
  occasion to go to the safe again till about 12.20, when the Controller's
  secretary came here with a telegram to be de-coded. The safe was still locked
  then, but when it was opened the code was gone."</p>

  <p>"You had had no occasion to go to the safe in the meantime?"</p>

  <p>"None at all. I locked it at 10.20, and I unlocked it two hours later, and
  that was all."</p>

  <p>"You were not in the room the whole of the time, of course?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no. I have told you that at 10.20 I went to the Controller's room,
  and after that I went out two or three times on one occasion or another. But
  each time I locked the door of the room."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you did? That is important. And you took all your keys with you, I
  presume?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, all. The keys on the bunch I took in my pocket, of course, and the
  room door key I also took. There are one or two rather important papers on my
  desk, you see, and anybody from the corridor might come in if the door were
  left unlocked."</p>

  <p>"The lock of the door would be a good deal easier to pick than that of the
  safe," Hewitt observed, after examining it. "But that would be of no great
  use with the safe locked. Shortly, then, the facts are these. You locked the
  code safely away at 10.20, you left the room two or three times, but each
  time the door, as well as the safe, was locked, and the keys in your pocket;
  and then, at 12.20, or two hours exactly after the code had been put safely
  away, you opened the safe again in presence of the Controller's secretary,
  and the code had vanished. That is the whole matter in brief, I take it?"</p>

  <p>"Precisely." Mr. Telfer was pallid and bewildered. "It seems a total
  impossibility," he said; "a total, absolute, physical impossibility; but
  there it is."</p>

  <p>"But as no such thing as a physical impossibility ever happens," Hewitt
  replied calmly, "we must look further. Now, are there any other ways into
  this room than by that door into the corridor? I see another door here. What
  is that?"</p>

  <p>"That door has been locked for ages. The room on the other side is one
  like this, with a door in the corridor; it is used chiefly to store old
  documents of no great importance, and I believe that whole stacks of them, in
  bundles, are piled against the other side of that same door. We will send for
  the key and see, if you like."</p>

  <p>The key was sent for, and the door from the corridor opened. As Telfer had
  led us to expect, the place was full of old papers in bundles and parcels,
  thick with ancient dust, and these things were piled high against the door
  next his room, and plainly had not been disturbed for months, or even
  years.</p>

  <p>"There remains the skylight," said Hewitt, "for I perceive, Mr. Telfer,
  that your room is lighted from above, and has no window; while the grate is a
  register. There seems to be no opening in that skylight but the revolving
  ventilator. Am I right?"</p>

  <p>"Quite so. There is no getting in by the skylight without breaking it,
  and, as you see, it has not been broken. Certainly there are men on the roof
  repairing the leads, but it is plain enough that nobody has come that way.
  The thing is wholly inexplicable."</p>

  <p>"At present, yes," Hewitt said, musingly. He stood for a few moments in
  deep thought.</p>

  <p>"Plummer is longer away than I expected," he said presently. "By the way,
  what was the external appearance of the missing code?"</p>

  <p>"It was nothing but a sort of thin manuscript book, made of a few sheets
  of foolscap size, sewn in a cover of thickish grey paper. I left it in the
  safe doubled lengthwise, and tied with tape in the middle."</p>

  <p>"Its loss is a very serious thing, of course?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, terribly, terribly serious, Mr. Hewitt," Telfer replied,
  despairingly. "I am responsible, and it will put an end to my career, of
  course. But the consequences to the country are more important, and they may
  be disastrous&mdash;enormously so. A great sum would be paid for that code on
  the Continent, I need hardly say."</p>

  <p>"But now that you know it is taken, surely the code can be changed?"</p>

  <p>"It's not so easy as it seems, Mr. Hewitt," Telfer answered, shaking his
  head. "It means time, and I needn't tell you that with affairs in their
  present state we can't afford one moment of time. Some expedients are being
  attempted, of course, but you will understand that any new code would have to
  be arranged with scattered items of the fleet in all parts of the world, and
  that probably with the present code in the hands of the enemy. Moreover, all
  our messages already sent will be accessible with very little trouble, and
  they contain all our strategical coaling and storing dispositions for a great
  war, Mr. Hewitt; and they can't, they <i>can't</i> be altered at a moment's
  notice! Oh, it is terrible!... But here is Inspector Plummer. No news, I
  suppose, Mr. Plummer?"</p>

  <p>"Well, no," Plummer answered deliberately. "I can't say I've any news for
  <i>you</i>, Mr. Telfer, just yet. But I want to talk about a few things to
  Mr. Hewitt. Hadn't we better go and see if your telegram is answered, Mr.
  Hewitt? Unless you've heard."</p>

  <p>"No, I haven't," Hewitt replied. "We'll go on at once. Good-day for the
  present, Mr. Telfer. I hope to bring good news when next I see you."</p>

  <p>"I hope so, too, Mr. Hewitt, most fervently," Telfer answered; and his
  looks confirmed his words.</p>

  <p>We walked in silence through the corridor, down the stairs, and out by the
  gates into the street. Then Plummer turned on his heel and faced Hewitt.</p>

  <p><a id="pic21"

  </div><br>

  <p>"That man's a wrong 'un," he said, abruptly, jerking his thumb in the
  direction of the office we had just left. "I'll tell you about it in the
  cab."</p>

  <p>As soon as our cab was started on its way back to Hewitt's office Plummer
  explained himself.</p>

  <p>"He's been watched," he said, "has Mr. Telfer, when he didn't know it; and
  he'll be watched again for the rest of to-day, as I've arranged. What's more,
  he won't be allowed to leave the office this evening till I have seen him
  again, or sent a message. No need to frighten him too soon&mdash;it mightn't
  suit us. But he's in it, alone or in company!"</p>

  <p>"How do you know?"</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you. It seems the lead roofs are being repaired at the
  Admiralty, and the plumbers are walking about where they like. Now I needn't
  tell you I've had a man or two fishing about among the doorkeepers and so on
  at the Admiralty, and one of them found a plumber he knew slightly, working
  on the roof. That plumber happens to be no fool&mdash;a bit smarter than the
  detective-constable, it seems to me, in fact. Anyhow, he seems to have got
  more out of my man than my man got out of him; and soon after I reached the
  Yard he turned up, asking to see me. He said he'd heard that a valuable paper
  was missing (he didn't know what) from the room with the skylight in the top
  floor, where the gentleman with the single eye-glass was, and where the safe
  was let in the wall; and he wanted to know what would be the reward for
  anybody giving information about it. Of course I couldn't make any promise,
  and I gave him to understand that he would have to leave the amount of the
  reward to the authorities, if his information was worth anything; also, that
  we were getting to work fast, and that if he wished to be first to give
  information he'd better be quick about it; but I promised to make a special
  report of his name and what he had to say if it were useful. And it will be,
  or I'm vastly mistaken! For just you see here. Our friend, Mr. Telfer, says
  he put that code safely away at 10.20 in the safe, and that he never went to
  the safe again till 12.20, when the Controller's secretary was with him;
  never went to it for anything whatever, observe. Well, the plumber happened
  to be near the skylight at half-past eleven, and he is prepared to swear that
  he saw Mr. Telfer&mdash;'the gent with the eye-glass,' as he calls
  him&mdash;go to the safe, unlock it, take out a grey paper, folded
  lengthwise, with red tape round it, re-lock the safe, and carry that paper
  out into the corridor! The plumber was kneeling by a brazier, it seems, which
  was close by the skylight, and he is so certain of the time because he was
  regulating his watch by Westminster Hall clock, and compared it when the
  half-hour struck, which was just while Telfer was absent in the corridor with
  the paper. He was only gone a second or two, and you will remember that
  Corder saw Mayes leaving the premises within two minutes of that time!"</p>

  <p>"Yes!"</p>

  <p>"Well, Telfer was back in a second or two, <i>without the paper</i>, and
  went on with his affairs as before. That's pretty striking, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Hewitt answered thoughtfully, "it is."</p>

  <p>"It was a sort of shot in the dark on the part of the plumber, for he knew
  nothing else&mdash;nothing about Telfer legitimately having the keys of the
  safe, nor any of the particulars we have been told. He merely knew that a
  paper was missing, and having seen a paper taken out of the safe he got it
  into his head that he had possibly witnessed the theft; and he kept his
  knowledge to himself till he could see somebody in authority. Mighty keen,
  too, about a reward!"</p>

  <p>"And now you are having Telfer supervised?"</p>

  <p>"I am. Not that we're likely to get the code from him; that's passed out,
  sure enough, in Mayes's hands&mdash;or else his pockets."</p>

  <p>To this confident expression of opinion Hewitt offered no reply, and
  presently we alighted at his office, eager to learn if Peytral had given the
  information Hewitt so much desired. Sure enough a telegram was there, and it
  ran thus:</p>

  <blockquote>
    "On the night you know of, Mayes went first to 37 Raven Street,
    Blackfriars, then to 8 Norbury Row, Barbican. Message follows."
  </blockquote>

  <p>"Now we're at work," Hewitt said, briskly, "and for a while we part. I
  shall make a few changes of dress, and go to take a look at 37 Raven Street,
  Blackfriars. Will you two go on to Norbury Row? You'll have to be careful,
  Plummer, and not show yourself. That is where Brett will be useful, since he
  isn't known; if anybody is to be seen let it be him. I shall be very careful
  myself&mdash;though I shall have some little disguise; and I fancy I shall
  not be so likely to be seen as you."</p>

  <p>"What are we to do?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, of course, if you see Mayes in the open, grab him instantly. I
  needn't tell Plummer <i>that</i>. I think Plummer would naturally seize him
  on the spot, rush him off to the nearest station and go back with enough men
  to clear out No. 8 Norbury Row. If you don't see him you'll keep an
  observation, according to Plummer's discretion. But, unless some exceptional
  chance occurs, I hope you won't go rushing in till we communicate with each
  other&mdash;we must work together, and I may have news. My instinct seems to
  tell me that yours is the right end of the stick, at Barbican. But we must
  neglect nothing, and that is why I want you to hold on there while I make the
  necessary examination at the other end. Do you know this Norbury Row,
  Plummer?"</p>

  <p>"I think I know every street and alley in the City," Plummer answered.
  "There is a very good publican at the corner of Norbury Row, who's been
  useful to the police a score of times. He keeps his eyes open, and I shall be
  surprised if he can't give us <i>some</i> information about No. 8, anyhow.
  Moon's his name, and the house is 'The Compasses.' I shall go there first.
  And if you've any message to send, send it through him. I'll tell him."</p>

  <p>On the stairs Plummer and I encountered another of his assistants. "I've
  got the cab, sir," he reported. "Waiting outside now. Took up a fare in
  Whitehall, opposite the Admiralty, and drove him to Charterhouse Street; got
  down just by the Meat Market. That's all the man seems to know."</p>

  <p>Plummer questioned the cabman, and found that as a matter of fact that was
  all he did know. So, telling him to wait to take us our little journey, we
  returned and reported his information to Hewitt.</p>

  <p>"Just as I expected," he said, quietly. "He stopped the cab a bit short of
  his destination, of course,&mdash;just as you will, no doubt. There's not a
  great deal in the evidence, but it confirms my idea."</p>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">We followed Mayes's example by stopping the cab in
  Charterhouse Street, and walking the short remaining distance to Barbican.
  Norbury Row was an obscure street behind it, at the corner of which stood
  "The Compasses," the public-house which Plummer had mentioned. We did not
  venture to show ourselves in Norbury Row, but hastened into the nearest door
  of "The Compasses," which chanced to be that of the private bar.</p>

  <p>A stout, red-faced, slow-moving man with one eye and a black patch, stood
  behind the bar. Plummer lifted his finger and pointed quickly toward the
  bar-parlour; and at the signal the one-eyed man turned with great
  deliberation and pulled a catch which released the door of that apartment,
  close at our elbows. We stepped quickly within, and presently the one-eyed
  man came rolling in by the other door.</p>

  <p>"Well, good art'noon, Mr. Plummer, sir," he said, with a long intonation
  and a wheeze. "Good art'noon, sir. You've bin a stranger lately."</p>

  <p>"Good afternoon, Mr. Moon," Plummer answered, briskly. "We've come for a
  little information, my friend and I, which I'm sure you'll give us if you
  can."</p>

  <p>"All the years I've been knowed to the police," answered Mr. Moon, slower
  and wheezier as he went on, "I've allus give 'em all the information I could,
  an' that's a fact. Ain't it, Mr. Plummer?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course, and we don't forget it. What we want
  now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Allus tell 'em what&mdash;ever I knows," rumbled Mr. Moon, turning to me,
  "allus; an' glad to do it, too. 'Cause why? Ain't they the police? Very well
  then, I tells 'em. Allus tells 'em!"</p>

  <p>Plummer waited patiently while Mr. Moon stared solemnly at me after this
  speech. Then, when the patch slowly turned in my direction and the eye in
  his, he resumed, "We want to know if you know anything about No. 8 Norbury
  Row?"</p>

  <p>"Number eight," Mr. Moon mused, gazing abstractedly out of the window;
  "num&mdash;ber eight. Ground-floor, Stevens, packing-case maker; first-floor,
  Hutt, agent in fancy-goods; second-floor, dunno. Name o' Richardson,
  bookbinder, on the door, but that's bin there five or six year now, and it
  ain't the same tenant. Richardson's dead, an' this one don't bind no books as
  I can see. I don't even remember seein' him <i>very</i> often. Tallish,
  darkish sort o' gent he is, and don't seem to have many visitors. Well, then
  there's the top-floor&mdash;but I s'pose it's the same tenant. Richardson
  used to have it for his workshop. That's all."</p>

  <p>"Have you got a window we can watch it from?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Moon turned ponderously round and without a word led the way to the
  first floor, puffing enormously on the stairs.</p>

  <p>"You <i>can</i> see it from the club-room," he said at length, "but this
  'ere little place is better."</p>

  <p>He pushed open a door, and we entered a small sitting-room. "That's the
  place," he said, pointing. "There's a new packing-case a-standing outside
  now."</p>

  <p>Norbury Row presented an appearance common enough in parts of the city a
  little way removed from the centre. A street of houses that once had
  sheltered well-to-do residents had gradually sunk in the world to the
  condition of tenement-houses, and now was on the upward grade again, being
  let in floors to the smaller sort of manufacturers, and to such agents and
  small commercial men as required cheap offices. No. 8 was much like the rest.
  A packing-case maker had the ground-floor, as Moon had said, and a token of
  his trade, in the shape of a new packing-case, stood on the pavement. The
  rest of the building showed nothing distinctive.</p>

  <p>"There y'are, gents," said Mr. Moon, "if you want to watch, you're
  welcome, bein' the p'lice, which I allus does my best for, allus. But you'll
  have to excuse me now, 'cos o' the bar."</p>

  <p>Mr. Moon stumped off downstairs, leaving Plummer and myself watching at
  the window.</p>

  <p>"Your friend the publican seems very proud of helping the police," I
  remarked.</p>

  <p>Plummer laughed. "Yes," he said, "or at any rate, he is anxious we shan't
  forget it. You see, it's in some way a matter of mutual accommodation. We
  make things as easy as possible for him on licensing days, and as he has a
  pretty extensive acquaintance among the sort of people we often want to get
  hold of, he has been able to show his gratitude very handsomely once or
  twice."</p>

  <p>The house on which our eyes were fixed was a little too far up the street
  for us to see perfectly through the window of the second-floor, though we
  could see enough to indicate that it was furnished as an office. We agreed
  that the unknown second-floor tenant was more likely to be our customer, or
  connected with him, than either of the others. Still, we much desired a
  nearer view, and presently, since the coast seemed clear, Plummer announced
  his intention of taking one.</p>

  <p>He left me at the post of observation, and presently I saw him lounging
  along on the other side of the way, keeping close to the houses, so as to
  escape observation from the upper windows. He took a good look at the names
  on the door-post of No. 8, and presently stepped within.</p>

  <p>I waited five or six minutes, and then saw him returning as he had
  come.</p>

  <p>"It's the top floors we want," he said, when he rejoined me in Mr. Moon's
  sitting-room. "The packing-case maker is genuine enough, and very busy. So is
  the fancy-goods agent. I went in, seeing the door wide open, and found the
  agent, a little, shop-walkery sort of chap, hard at work with his clerk among
  piles of cardboard boxes. I wouldn't go further, in case I were spotted. Do
  you think you'd be cool enough to do it without arousing suspicion? Mayes
  doesn't know you, you see. What do you think? We don't want to precipitate
  matters till we hear from Hewitt, but on the other hand I don't want to sit
  still as long as anything can be ascertained. You might ask a question about
  book-binding."</p>

  <p>"Of course," I said. "If you will let me I'll go at once&mdash;glad of the
  chance to get a peep. I'll bespeak a quotation for binding and lettering a
  thousand octavos in paste grain, on behalf of some convenient firm of
  publishers. That would be technical enough, I think?"</p>

  <p>I took my hat and walked out as Plummer had done, though, of course, I
  approached the door of No. 8 with less caution. The packing-case maker's men
  were hammering away merrily, and as I mounted the stairs I saw the little
  fancy-goods agent among his cardboard boxes, just as Plummer had said. The
  upper part of the house was a silent contrast to the busy lower floors, and
  as I arrived at the next landing I was surprised to see the door ajar.</p>

  <p>I pushed boldly in, and found myself alone in a good-sized room plainly
  fitted as an office. There were two windows looking on the street, and one at
  the back, more than half concealed behind a ground glass partition or screen.
  I stepped across and looked out of this window. It looked on a narrow space,
  or well, of plain brick wall, containing nothing but a ladder, standing in
  one corner. And the only other window giving on this narrow square space was
  in the opposite wall, but much lower, on the ground level.</p>

  <p>I saw these things in a single glance, and then I turned&mdash;to find
  myself face to face with a tallish, thin, active man, with a pale, shaven,
  ascetic face, dark hair, and astonishingly quick glittering black eyes. He
  stood just within the office door, to which he must have come without a
  sound, looking at me with a mechanical smile of inquiry, while his eyes
  searched me with a portentous keenness.</p>

  <p><a id="pic22"

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>"Oh," I said, with the best assumption of carelessness I could command, "I
  was looking for you, Mr. Richardson. Do you care to give a quotation for
  binding at per thousand crown octavo volumes in paste grain, plain, with
  lettering on back?"</p>

  <p>"No," answered the man with the eyes, "I don't; I'm afraid my carelessness
  has led you into a mistake. I am not Richardson the bookbinder. He was my
  predecessor in this office, and I have neglected to paint out his name on the
  door-post."</p>

  <p>I hastened to apologise. "I am sorry to have intruded," I said. "I found
  the door ajar and so came in. You see the publishing season is beginning, and
  our regular binders are full of work, so that we have to look elsewhere.
  Good-day!"</p>

  <p>"Good-day," the keen man responded, turning to allow me to pass through
  the door. "I'm sorry I cannot be of service to you&mdash;on this
  occasion."</p>

  <p>From first to last his eyes had never ceased to search me, and now as I
  descended the stairs I could <i>feel</i> that they were fixed on me
  still.</p>

  <p>I took a turn about the houses, in order not to be observed going direct
  to "The Compasses," and entered that house by way of the private bar, as
  before.</p>

  <p>"That is Mayes, and no other," said Plummer, when I had made my report and
  described the man with the eyes. "I've seen him twice, once with his beard
  and once without. The question now is, whether we hadn't best sail in
  straight away and collar him. But there's the window at the back, and a
  ladder, I think you said. Can he reach it?"</p>

  <p>"I think he might&mdash;easily."</p>

  <p>"And perhaps there's the roof, since he's got the top floor too. Not good
  enough without some men to surround the house. We must go gingerly over this.
  One thing to find out is, what is the building behind? Ah, how I wish Mr.
  Hewitt were here now! If we don't hear from him soon we must send a message.
  But we mustn't lose sight of No. 8 for a moment."</p>

  <p>There was a thump at the sitting-room door, and Mr. Moon came puffing in
  and shouldered himself confidentially against Plummer. "Bloke downstairs
  wants to see you," he said, in a hoarse grunt that was meant for a low
  whisper. "Twigged you outside, I think, an' says he's got somethink
  partickler to tell yer. I believe 'e's a 'nark'; I see him with one o' your
  chaps the other day."</p>

  <p>"I'll go," Plummer said to me hurriedly. "Plainly somebody's spotted me in
  the street, and I may as well hear him."</p>

  <p>I knew very well, of course, what Moon meant by a 'nark.' A 'nark' is an
  informer, a spy among criminals who sells the police whatever information he
  can scrape up. Could it be possible that this man had anything to tell about
  Mayes? It was scarcely likely, and I made up my mind that Plummer was merely
  being detained by some tale of a petty local crime.</p>

  <p>But in a few minutes he returned with news of import. "This fellow is most
  valuable," he said. "He knows a lot about Mayes, whom, of course, he calls by
  another name; but the identity's certain. He saw me looking in at No. 8, he
  says, and guessed I must be after him. He seems to have wondered at Mayes's
  mysterious movements for a long time, and so kept his eye on him and made
  inquiries. It seems that Mayes sometimes uses a back way, through the window
  you saw on the opposite side of the little area, by way of that ladder you
  mentioned. It's quite plain this fellow knows something, from the particulars
  about that ladder. He wants half a sovereign to show me the way through a
  stable passage behind and point out where our man can be trapped to a
  certainty. It'll be a cheap ten shillingsworth, and we mustn't waste time. If
  Hewitt comes, tell him not to move till I come back or send a message, which
  I can easily do by this chap I'm going with. And be sure to keep your eye on
  the front door of No. 8 while I'm gone."</p>

  <p>The thing had begun to grow exciting, and the fascination of the pursuit
  took full possession of my imagination. I saw Plummer pass across the end of
  the street in company with a shuffling, out-at-elbows-looking man with dirty
  brown whiskers, and I set myself to watch the door of the staircase by the
  packing-case maker's with redoubled attention, hoping fervently that Mayes
  might emerge, and so give me the opportunity of capping the extraordinary
  series of occurrences connected with the Red Triangle by myself seizing and
  handing him over to the police.</p>

  <p>So I waited and watched for something near another quarter of an hour.
  Then there came another thump at the door, and once more I beheld Mr.
  Moon.</p>

  <p>"Man askin' for you in the bar, sir," he said.</p>

  <p>"Asking for me?" I asked, a little astonished. "By name?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Brett, 'e said, sir. He's the same chap, you know. He's got a message
  from Inspector Plummer, 'e says."</p>

  <p>"May he come up here?" I asked, mindful of maintaining my watch.</p>

  <p>"Certainly, sir, if you like. I'll bring him."</p>

  <p>Presently the shuffling man with the dirty whiskers presented himself. He
  was a shifty, villainous-looking fellow of middle height, looking a "nark"
  all over. He pulled off his cap and delivered his message in a rum-scented
  whisper. "Inspector Plummer says the front way don't matter now," he said.
  "'E can cop 'im fair the other way if you'll go round to him at once. If Mr.
  Martin Hewitt's here 'e'd rather 'ave 'im, but on'y one's to come now."</p>

  <p>Naturally, I thought, Plummer would prefer Hewitt; but in this case I
  should for once be ahead of my friend, and have the pleasure of relating the
  circumstances of the capture to him, instead of listening, as usual, to his
  own quiet explanations of the manner in which the case had been brought to a
  successful issue. So I took my hat and went.</p>

  <p>"Best let me go in front," whispered the "nark." "You bein' a toff might
  be noticed." It was a reasonable precaution, and I followed him
  accordingly.</p>

  <p>We went a little way down Barbican, and presently, taking a very narrow
  turning, plunged into a cluster of alleys, through which, however, I could
  plainly perceive that our way lay in the direction of the back of the house
  in Norbury Row. At length my guide stopped at what seemed a stable yard,
  pushed open a wicket gate, and went in, keeping the gate open for me to
  follow.</p>

  <p>It was, indeed, a stable yard, littered with much straw, which the "nark"
  carefully picked to walk on as noiselessly as possible, motioning me to do
  the same. It was a small enough yard, and dark, and when my guide very
  carefully opened the door of a stable I saw that that was darker still.</p>

  <p>He pushed the door wide so as to let a little light fall on another door
  which I now perceived in the brick wall which formed the side of the stable.
  After listening intently for a moment at this door, the guide stepped back
  and favoured me with another puff of rum and a whisper. "There's no light in
  that there passage," he said, "an' we'd better not strike one. I'll catch
  hold of your hand."</p>

  <p><a id="pic23"
     name="pic23"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1403201h-images/Triangle-5-4.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>He pulled the stable door to, and took me by the hand. I heard the inner
  door open quietly, and we stepped cautiously forward. We had gone some five
  or six yards in the darkness when I felt something cold touch the wrist of
  the hand by which I was being led. There was a loud click, my hand was
  dropped, and I felt my wrist held fast, while I could hear my late guide
  shuffling away in the darkness.</p>

  <p>I could not guess whether to cry out or remain quiet. I called after the
  man in a loud whisper, but got no answer. I used my other hand to feel at my
  right wrist, and found that it was clipped in one of a pair of handcuffs, the
  other being locked in a staple in the wall. I tugged my hardest to loosen
  this staple, but it held firm. The thing had been so sudden and stealthy that
  I scarce had time to realise that I was in serious danger, and that,
  doubtless, Plummer had preceded me, when a light appeared at an angle ahead.
  It turned the corner, and I perceived, coming toward me, carrying a lamp, the
  pale man of the eyes, whom I had encountered not an hour before&mdash;in a
  word, Mayes.</p>

  <p>His eyes searched me still, but he approached me with a curiously polite
  smile.</p>

  <p>"No, Mr. Brett," he said, "my name is not Richardson, and I am not a
  bookbinder. Not that I am particular about such a thing as a name, for you
  have heard of me under more than one already, and you are quite at liberty to
  call me Richardson if you like. I am sorry to have to talk to you in this
  uncomfortable place, but the circumstances are exceptional. But, at least, I
  should give you a chair."</p>

  <p>He stepped back a little way and pressed a bell-button. Presently the
  fellow who had decoyed me there appeared, and Mayes ordered him to bring me a
  chair at once, which he did, with stolid obedience. I sat in it, so that my
  wrist rested at somewhere near the level of my shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Brett," Mayes pursued, when his man was gone, "I am not so implacable
  a person as you perhaps believe me; in fact, I can assure you that my
  disposition is most friendly."</p>

  <p>"Then unfasten this handcuff," I said.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry that that is a little precaution I find it necessary to take
  till we understand each other better. I am glad to see you, Mr. Brett, though
  I am sure you will not think me rude if I say that I should have preferred
  Mr. Martin Hewitt in your place. But perhaps his turn will come later. I have
  a proposition to make, Mr. Brett. I should like you to join me."</p>

  <p>"To join you?"</p>

  <p>"Exactly." He nodded pleasantly. "You needn't shrink; I shan't ask you to
  do anything vulgar, or even anything that, with your present prejudices, you
  might consider actively criminal. You can help me, you see, in your own
  profession as a journalist; and in other ways. And my enterprise is greater
  than you may imagine. Join me, and you shall be a great man in an entirely
  new sphere. A small matter of initiation is necessary, and that is all. You
  have only to consent to that."</p>

  <p>I said nothing.</p>

  <p>"You seem reluctant. Well, perhaps it is natural, in your present
  ignorance. This is no vulgar criminal organisation that I have, understand. I
  have taken certain measures to provide myself with the necessary tools in the
  shape of money, and so forth, but my aims are larger than you
  suspect&mdash;perhaps larger than you can understand. And I work with a means
  more wonderful than you have experience of. For instance, here is to-day's
  work. You know about the lost Naval Code, of course&mdash;it is what you came
  about. That document is now lying in the desk you stood by in the room where
  we spoke of paste grain book covers and the like. It was there then at your
  elbow. It will be sold for many thousands of pounds by to-morrow, and all the
  puny watchings and dodgings that have been devised cannot prevent it. The
  money will go to aid me in the attainment of the power of which you may have
  a part, if you wish. The means of attaining this I scruple no more about than
  you did to-day about the story of the bookbindings." He bowed with a slight
  smile and went on.</p>

  <p>"Come now, Mr. Brett, put aside your bourgeois prejudices and join me.
  Your friend Plummer is coming gladly, I feel sure, and he will be useful,
  too. And from what I have seen from Mr. Martin Hewitt, I have no doubt I can
  make it right with him. If I can't it will be very bad for him, I can assure
  you; you have heard and seen something of my powers, and I need say no more.
  But Hewitt is a man of sense, and will come in, of course, and you had better
  come with your friends. I want one or two superior men. Mason&mdash;you know
  about Jacob Mason, of course&mdash;Mason was a fool, and he was
  lost&mdash;inevitably. The others"&mdash;he made a gesture of
  contempt&mdash;"they are mere vulgar tools. They will have their rewards if
  they are faithful, of course; if not&mdash;well, you remember Denson in the
  Samuel diamond business? He was <i>not</i> faithful, and there was an end of
  him. I may tell you that Denson was made an example, for one was needed. I
  assigned him a certain operation, and, having brought it to success, he
  endeavoured to embezzle&mdash;did embezzle&mdash;the proceeds. He was made a
  conspicuous example, in a most conspicuous public place, to impress the
  others. They didn't know <i>him</i>, but they knew well enough what the Red
  Triangle meant! Ah, my excellent recruit&mdash;for so I count you
  already&mdash;there is more in that little sign than you can imagine! It is
  more than a sign&mdash;it is an implement of very potent power; and you shall
  learn its whole secret in that little form of initiation I spoke of. See now,
  a present example. Telfer, the Admiralty clerk, gave up that document at my
  mere spoken word. He will deny it to his dying day, and he will be ruined for
  the act; but he gave me the paper himself, at my mere order. If he were one
  of my own&mdash;if he had passed through the initiation I offer you, I would
  have protected him; as it is, he must take his punishment, and though it is
  only I who will benefit, he will still deny the fact! Ha! Mr. Brett, do you
  begin to perceive that I do not boast when I tell of powers beyond your
  understanding?"</p>

  <p>Truly I was amazed, though I could not half understand. The circumstances
  of the loss of the Admiralty code had been so inexplicable, and now these
  incredible suggestions of the prime actor in the matter were more mysterious
  still.</p>

  <p>"Ha! you are amazed," he went on, "but if you will come further into my
  counsels I will amaze you more. What are you now? A drudge of a journalist,
  and if ever you make a thousand a year to feed yourself with you will be
  lucky. Come to me and you shall be a man of power. There is a place beyond
  the sea where I may be king, and you a viceroy. Don't think I am raving! It
  is true enough that I am an enthusiast, but I have power, power to do
  anything I please, I tell you! What are the greatest powers among men on this
  earth? Some will say the pen, or the sword, or love, or what not. Men of the
  world will say, money and lies; and they will be very nearly right. Money and
  lies will move continents, but I have one greater power still&mdash;the very
  apex of the triangle! That power I revealed to Jacob Mason. He thought to
  betray it, and it killed him. That power I will reveal to you, if you will
  accept the alternative I offer."</p>

  <p>"The alternative?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, the alternative, for an alternative it is, of course. If you will go
  through the form of initiation, I shall keep you here a little till I can
  trust you&mdash;which will be very soon. But if not&mdash;well, Mr. Brett, I
  wish to be as friendly as you please, but having been at the trouble of
  catching you, and having got you here safely, you who know so much now, you
  who could be so dangerous if you ever got away&mdash;eh? Well, you know my
  methods, and you have seen them exemplified, and you will understand."</p>

  <p>There was no anger in his voice as he uttered this threat, nor even, I
  thought, in his eyes. But what there was was worse.</p>

  <p>"But I'm sure you will not make things unpleasant," he concluded. "You
  will go through the little form I have arranged, if only for curiosity. Just
  think over it for a moment, while I go to close my little office."</p>

  <p>He took the lamp and turned away, but as he reached the angle of the
  passage, there came a sound that checked his steps. I could hear a noise of
  feet and hurried voices, and then suddenly arose a shout in a voice which
  seemed to be Plummer's. "Here!" it cried. "Help! This way, Hewitt!
  Brett!"</p>

  <p>I shouted back at the top of my voice, wondering where Plummer was, and
  what it might all mean. And with that Mayes turned, and I saw that he was
  about to make for the door I had entered by. I resolved he should not pass me
  if I could prevent it, and I sprang up and seized my chair in my left hand,
  shouting aloud for help as I did so.</p>

  <p>Mayes came with a bound, and flung his lighted lamp full at my head. It
  struck the chair and smashed to a thousand pieces, and in that instant of
  time Mayes was on me. Plainly he had no weapon, or he would have used it; but
  I was at disadvantage enough, with my right wrist chained to the wall. I
  clung with all my might, and endeavoured to swing my enemy round against the
  wall in order that I might clasp my hands about him, and I shouted my loudest
  as I did it. But the chair and the broken glass hampered me, and Mayes was
  desperate. The agony in my right wrist was unbearable, and just as I was
  conscious of a rush of approaching feet a heavy blow took me full in the
  face, and I felt Mayes rush over me while I fell and hung from the wrist.</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>I had a stunned sense of lights and voices and general confusion, and then
  I remembered nothing.</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">I came to myself on the floor of a lighted room, with
  Hewitt's face over mine. My wrist seemed broken, though it was free, there
  was oil and blood on my clothes, and in my left hand I still gripped a piece
  of Mayes's coat.</p>

  <p>"Stop him!" I cried. "He's gone by the stable! Have they got him?"</p>

  <p>"No good, Brett," Hewitt answered soberly. "You did your best, but he's
  gone, and Peytral after him!"</p>

  <p>"Peytral?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. He brought his own message to town. But see if you can stand
  up."</p>

  <p>I was well enough able to do that, and, indeed, I had only fainted from
  the pain of the strain on my wrist. Several policemen were in the room,
  beside Hewitt and Plummer. Mayes's stronghold was in the hands of his
  enemies.</p>

  <p>Then I suddenly remembered.</p>

  <p>"The Admiralty code!" I cried. "It was in the office desk. Have you got
  it?"</p>

  <p>"No," Hewitt answered. "Come, Plummer, up the ladder!"</p>

  <p>Little time was lost in forcing Mayes's desk, and there the document was
  found, grey cover, red tape and all intact. The police were left to make a
  vigorous search for any possible copy, and the original was handed to
  Plummer, as chief representative of the law present. He had been trapped
  precisely as I had been, except that he had been led further, and shut in a
  cellar as well as fastened by the wrist. Mayes, it seemed, had wasted very
  little time in attempting to pervert him, and I have no doubt that, whatever
  fate might have been reserved for me, Plummer would never have left the place
  alive had it not been for the timely irruption of Hewitt, with Peytral and
  the police.</p>

  <p>In half an hour Peytral returned. He had dashed out in chase of the
  fugitive, but failed even to see him&mdash;lost him wholly in the courts, in
  fact. For some little while he persevered, but found it useless.</p>

  <p>The dirty-whiskered man made no attempt to escape, though there was talk
  of another man having got away in the confusion by way of the stable roof.
  The police were left in charge of the place, and we deferred a complete
  exploration till the next day.</p>

  <p>Hewitt's tale was simple enough. He had endued himself in somewhat seedy
  clothes, and had visited 37 Raven Street, Blackfriars, which he found to be
  merely a tenement house. It took some time to make inquiries there, with the
  necessary caution, because of the number of lodgers; and then the inquiries
  led to nothing. It was an experience common enough in his practice, but none
  the less an annoying delay, and when he returned to his office he found Mr.
  Peytral already awaiting him. Peytral described his following of Mayes at
  much greater length and detail than before, and he and Hewitt had come on to
  Norbury Row at once and asked news of Mr. Moon.</p>

  <p>Mr. Moon's description of the successive disappearances of Plummer and
  myself, and of our continued absence, so aroused Hewitt's suspicions that he
  instantly procured help from the nearest station, and approached the door of
  Mayes's office. A knock being unanswered, the door was instantly broken in.
  The room was found to be unoccupied, but the ladder was still standing at the
  open window, by which Mayes had descended to the back premises. Down this
  ladder Hewitt went, with the police after him. The rest I had seen
  myself.</p>

  <p>"But what," I said, "what is this mystery? Why did Telfer give up the
  code, and what is the power that Mayes talks of?"</p>

  <p>"It is a power," replied Hewitt, "that I have suspected for some time, and
  now I am quite sure of it. A secret, dangerous and terrible power which I
  have encountered before, though never before have I known its possibilities
  carried so far. It is hypnotism!"</p>

  <p>"Hypnotism!" I exclaimed. "But can a person be hypnotised against his
  will?"</p>

  <p>"In a sense, in most cases, he cannot. That is the explanation of Mayes's
  proposals to you to go through a 'form of initiation.' If you had consented,
  the 'form' would have been a process of hypnotism. Once or twice repeated,
  and you would have been wholly under his control, so that if he willed it and
  forbade you, you could tell nothing of what he wished kept secret, and you
  would have committed any crime he might suggest. Consider poor Jacob Mason!
  Remember how he struggled to tell what he knew, oppressed by the horror of
  it, and how it all ended! And remember Henning the clerk, Mayes's tool in
  that case of bond robbery! What has happened to him? He committed suicide, as
  you know, immediately after Mayes had left him at the barn. Brett, this power
  of hypnotism, a power for healing in the hands of a good man, may become a
  terrible power for evil in the hands of a villain!"</p>

  <p>"But Telfer, to-day? He seems to have known nothing of Mayes, and he was
  not one of his regular creatures&mdash;Mayes himself told me so."</p>

  <p>"About that I don't know. But I expect we shall find that he has been
  willingly hypnotised at some time or another, perhaps more than once, by this
  same scoundrel Mayes. Possibly in one of Mayes's appearances in respectable
  society, at an evening party, or the like. In a case of that sort the
  hypnotist may impress a certain formula&mdash;a word, a name, or a
  number&mdash;on the subject's mind, by the repetition of which, at any future
  time, that same subject may be instantly hypnotised. So that, once having
  become hypnotised, on any innocent occasion, the subject is in the power of
  the hypnotist, more or less, ever after. The hypnotist says: 'When I repeat
  such and such a sentence or number to you in future, you will be hypnotised,'
  and hypnotised the subject duly is, instantly. Supposing such a case in this
  matter of Mr. Telfer, it would only be necessary for Mayes to meet him in the
  corridor, repeat his formula and command the victim to bring out the paper he
  specified. This done he could similarly order him to <i>forget the whole
  transaction</i>, and this the victim would do, infallibly."</p>

  <p>It is only necessary to say here, parenthetically, that later inquiry
  proved the truth of Hewitt's supposition. Twice or three times Mr. Telfer had
  been hypnotised in a friend's chambers, by a plausible tall man whose
  acquaintance his host had made at some public scientific gathering. And in
  the end it became possible to identify this man with Mayes.</p>

  <p>Mr. Moon, of "The Compasses," was of great comfort to me that evening. My
  cuts and bruises were washed in his house, and my inner man revived with his
  food and drink.</p>

  <p>"Allus glad to oblige the p'lice," said Mr. Moon; "allus. 'Cos why? Ain't
  they the p'lice? Very well then!"</p>

     name="story6"></a>VI. &mdash; THE ADVENTURE OF CHANNEL MARSH</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Harmsworth London Magazine</i>, April 1903</h3>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">MAYES'S stronghold was taken, but Mayes had escaped us once
  again; the cage was in our hands, but the bird had flown.</p>

  <p>Martin Hewitt, however, had his plans, as he was soon to show. The
  recovery of the Admiralty code was a good stroke, and was a satisfactory
  ending to an important case; but that, and even the capture of the curious
  premises behind the Barbican, made but a halting-place in his pursuit of
  Mayes, and as soon as I was in some degree recovered from my struggle, and
  the captured place had been hastily searched, the chase was resumed without a
  moment's delay; and that adventure was entered upon which saw the end of the
  Red Triangle and its unholy doings&mdash;which came terribly near to seeing
  the end of Hewitt himself, in fact.</p>

  <p>I have not described the den near the Barbican with any great
  particularity, but I have said that the office, accessible from the open
  street, was only connected with the hidden premises behind&mdash;premises, as
  was afterwards discovered, held under a separate tenancy&mdash;by an
  easily-shifted ladder. It was in these hidden premises, approached by the
  maze of courts and the stable-yard, that the main evidences of Mayes's way of
  life were observable. The passage where my wrist had been locked to the wall,
  and the room or cellar in which Plummer had been confined, were the only
  parts of the lower premises fitted for the detention of prisoners, with the
  exception of one very low and wholly unlighted cellar, entered by a trapdoor
  and a very steep flight of brick steps. This place smelt horribly faint and
  stagnant; but it produced on my mind, both then and when I examined it later,
  an effect of horror and repulsion more than could be accounted for by the
  smell alone. Of its history nothing was discovered, and perhaps the feeling
  (though others experienced it as well as myself) was the effect of mere
  fancy; but I have never got rid of a conviction that that black cellar, or
  rather pit&mdash;for it was very narrow&mdash;had been the instrument of
  crimes never to be told.</p>

  <p>There were one or two rooms sparely furnished&mdash;one as a bedroom, a
  larger room, with a long table, a sofa, and several chairs; and in one of the
  smaller rooms was found a stove, ladles and crucibles for the melting down of
  metals&mdash;gold or silver. It was in this same room also that the table
  stood, in the drawers of which were found papers, letters and
  formulæ&mdash;things giving more than a hint of the use to which Mayes had
  put his friendship with Mr. Jacob Mason, for of every possible manner and
  detail in which science&mdash;more particularly the science of
  chemistry&mdash;could aid in the commission of crime, there were notes in
  these same drawers.</p>

  <p>But most of these things were observed in detail later. The thing that set
  us once more on the trail of Mayes, that very night and that very hour, was
  found in the isolated office facing the street. It was a cheque-book, quite
  full of unused cheques.</p>

  <p>"This cheque-book," said Hewitt to Inspector Plummer and myself, "was in
  the drawer below that in which we discovered the Admiralty code. The Eastern
  Consolidated is the bank, as you see&mdash;Upper Holloway branch. Now we must
  follow this at once, before waiting to search any further. There may be
  something more important as a clue, or there may not, but at any rate, while
  we are looking for it we are losing time. This may bring us to him at
  once."</p>

  <p>"You mean that he may have some address in Holloway," suggested Plummer,
  "and we may get it from the bank?"</p>

  <p>"There's that possibility, and another," Hewitt answered. "He has had to
  bolt without warning or preparation, with nothing but the clothes he ran
  in&mdash;probably very little money. Money he will want at once, and he would
  rather not wait till the morning to get it; if he can get it at once it will
  mean thirteen or fourteen hours' start at least. More, he will know very well
  that this place will be searched, that this cheque-book will be discovered
  soon enough, and that consequently the bank will be watched. This is what he
  will do&mdash;what he is doing now, very likely. He will knock up the
  resident manager of that bank and try to get a cheque cashed to-night. I
  don't think that can be done; in which case he will probably try to make some
  arrangement to have money sent him. Either way, we must be at the Upper
  Holloway branch of the Eastern Consolidated Bank as soon as a hansom can get
  us there."</p>

  <p>Thus it was settled, and Hewitt and Plummer went off at once, leaving
  Plummer's men, with the City police, in charge of the raided premises;
  leaving some of them also to make inquiries in the neighbourhood. Mr. Victor
  Peytral had shown himself anxious to accompany Hewitt and Plummer, but had
  been dissuaded by Hewitt. I guessed that Hewitt feared that some hasty
  indiscretion on the part of this terribly wronged man might endanger his
  plans. Peytral, however, seemed tractable enough, and left immediately after
  them; he had business, he said, which he expected would occupy him for a day
  or two, and when it was completed he would see us again.</p>

  <p>As for myself I only remained long enough to ascertain that the police
  could find no trace of the direction of Mayes's flight in the immediate
  neighbourhood. They had little to aid them. He had gone without a hat, and
  his dress was in some degree disordered by his struggle with me; but the
  latter defect he might easily have remedied in the courts as he ran, and they
  could gather no tidings of a hatless man. So I took my way to my office, my
  wrist growing stiffer and more painful as I went, so that I was not sorry to
  arrange for another member of the staff to take my duty for the night, and to
  get to bed a few hours earlier than usual, after the day's fatigue and
  excitement.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">Going to bed uncommonly soon I woke correspondingly early in
  the morning; but I was no earlier than Hewitt, who was at my door, in fact,
  ere my breakfast was well begun.</p>

  <p>"Well," I asked eagerly, almost before my friend had entered, "have you
  got him at last?"</p>

  <p>"Not yet," Hewitt answered. "But he did exactly as I had expected. Plummer
  and I knocked up the bank manager, who lives over the premises at the Upper
  Holloway branch. He was a very decent fellow&mdash;rather young for the
  post&mdash;but he was naturally a bit surprised, possibly irritated, at being
  bothered by one and another after office hours. I showed him the cheque-book,
  and asked him if it belonged to any customer of his.</p>

  <p>"'Why, yes,' he said, examining the numbers, 'I remember this because it
  is the first of a new series, and we issued it the day before yesterday to a
  new customer. Where did you get it?'</p>

  <p>"'We are very anxious to see that customer,' I said. 'Has he been here
  this evening?'</p>

  <p>"The manager seemed a trifle surprised, but answered readily enough.
  'Yes,' he said, 'he was here not an hour ago.'</p>

  <p>"'Wanting to draw money?' I asked. But that the manager wouldn't tell me,
  of course. So that it was necessary for Plummer to step in and reveal the
  facts that this was a police matter, and that he was a detective-inspector.
  That made some difference. The manager told us that our man had opened an
  account at the bank only two days before; and I'd like you to guess what name
  he had opened it under."</p>

  <p>"Not Myatt?" I said. "After the chase&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, not Myatt."</p>

  <p>"Catherton Hunt?"</p>

  <p>"No, nor Catherton Hunt. He had opened it in the name of Mayes!"</p>

  <p>"What! his actual name?"</p>

  <p>"His actual original name, according to Peytral. The account was
  transferred, it would seem, from another bank; and I have an idea we may find
  that he has been shifting his money about from one bank to another as safety
  suggested, using his real name with it. You remember we could find no trace
  of a banking account when the police raided and ransacked Calton Lodge after
  Mason was killed? Quite probably he has had small current accounts in other
  names at various times to aid in his schemes, but his main account has always
  stood in his real name; and by that, you see, we get some confirmation of
  Peytral's story. Well, as I say, the account was opened in the name of Mayes,
  and the cheque-book was issued which we discovered last night. The Upper
  Holloway branch saw no more of its customer till yesterday evening, long
  after hours, when he drove up in a hansom."</p>

  <p>"Oh," I said, "in a hansom, was it? The men left behind could get no news
  of him."</p>

  <p>"Yes, we ascertained that last night; we called back, of course, the last
  thing. I expect he got the first cab visible and drove off to a hatter's a
  fair distance away, and then on to the bank. At any rate, he knocked up the
  manager and told him that he had a sudden need for money that very night;
  could he have some?</p>

  <p>"The manager told him it would be impossible. Even if he had been willing
  to do it, against all regulations, it would still be impossible. For the
  strong-room and every cash receptacle in it was locked with two separate
  locks with different keys, and though he had one of these keys himself, it
  was useless without the other, which was in the possession of his second in
  command, who lived some distance out of London. This course is the usual
  precaution adopted in branch banks of this sort; opening and closing, morning
  and evening, have to be done by chief and assistant together. And I tell you,
  Brett, I believe that it was only the being informed of this fact that
  prevented Mayes from trying some of his hypnotic tricks on the bank manager;
  in which case there would have been a big bank robbery&mdash;perhaps
  something worse in addition."</p>

  <p>"Murder?"</p>

  <p>"Murder with a tourniquet, perhaps&mdash;perhaps with some other weapon;
  but, at any rate, probably with the Red Triangle. You know, of
  course&mdash;indeed I told you, I think&mdash;that in most cases&mdash;not
  all&mdash;it is necessary to get the subject's consent to the <i>first</i>
  exercise of hypnotism on him. I told you also it is possible for the
  practised hypnotist, while the subject is under the influence of the
  <i>first</i> experiment, to suggest to him a certain word or formula, or even
  a silent sign, which shall bring him under the influence at any other time,
  whenever the hypnotist chooses to repeat it&mdash;just as must have been done
  with Mr. Telfer, in the case of the Admiralty code. The first suggestion
  would not be the difficult thing it might seem&mdash;it would only require a
  little time and persuasion. Nothing would be said about hypnotism, of course;
  perhaps something about a little physical experiment, or the like, and then
  in a moment or two the subject would be in this creature's power for ever.
  Remember the little 'ceremony of initiation' that the scoundrel attempted to
  persuade you to submit to! That meant hypnotism&mdash;perhaps death.</p>

  <p>"But this is mere speculation. Mayes found that the keys on the premises
  were not enough to release his money, even if the strict rules of the bank
  had permitted the cashing of a cheque out of hours. But the manager suggested
  that perhaps some neighbouring tradesman would exchange cash for a cheque,
  and, with the view of obliging the new customer, went with him as far as the
  shop of Mr. Isaac Trenaman, a grocer and cheesemonger with a rather large
  shop at the corner of the road. Mr. Trenaman, introduced and assured by the
  manager, was willing to give as much cash as he could find in the till
  against Mr. Mayes's cheque, and did so to the extent of twenty-seven pounds,
  a cheque for which sum was duly drawn on one of the tradesman's own cheque
  forms, and left with him. This done, the bank's new customer took himself
  off, with thanks and apologies; carrying with him, however, two blank cheque
  forms from Mr. Trenaman's book, the pennies for which he punctiliously paid
  over the counter. Having no cheque forms with him, he explained, he might
  find them useful if he could come across some friend who could provide the
  cash he wished to use that night. And having completed this business so far,
  this charming new customer of the bank made off into the night."</p>

  <p>"And is that all you know of his movements?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, as yet. He seems to have made no very definite excuse to the manager
  for wanting the money in such a hurry&mdash;just said something had occurred
  which made cash necessary, and was very polite and apologetic, generally. The
  manager formed a notion that it must be for some gambling purpose&mdash;he
  fancied that Mayes said something distantly alluding to that, but wasn't
  sure."</p>

  <p>"Did you ask about the address given to the bank?"</p>

  <p>"Of course; but there we gained nothing. The manager couldn't remember it
  exactly, and the books, of course, were locked up. But we know it
  already&mdash;for what the manager <i>could</i> remember was that it was an
  office address, and somewhere near Barbican! So that we are back at the
  Barbican den again, where I am going now, with Plummer, to give a day to a
  minute investigation of the whole place. Meanwhile a watch is being set at
  the bank in Holloway."</p>

  <p>"Do you expect him back there, then?"</p>

  <p>"Hardly. You see he knows that by this time we must have found his
  cheque-book, and will be on the watch. But there is just a chance&mdash;a
  very remote one&mdash;that he may send a message; perhaps send somebody to
  cash a cheque. Though I don't expect it, for he is no fool&mdash;he is,
  indeed, a sort of genius&mdash;and that would be a mistake, I think. Still,
  he is bold, and that is where his money is, and he may make a dash at it. So
  a couple of Plummer's men are to be waiting there, this morning, in the
  manager's office, and if anybody comes from Mayes he will be detained.
  Perhaps you would like to be with them? You can't be of much use with me, and
  the job will be dull. But there you <i>may</i> have a chance of excitement,
  and you will be useful to come and report if anything does happen. Why, you
  may even bag Mayes himself!"</p>

  <p>"Of course&mdash;I'll go anywhere you please. They told you last night, I
  suppose, that Peytral had business, and had gone off?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, and I'm not sorry. He is too dangerous a man to have about us, with
  his hot blood and the terrible injuries he keeps in memory. As likely as not,
  if we get Mayes, we should next have to collar Peytral for shooting him, or
  something. So I'm not sorry he is out of it for a bit. But can you start now?
  Plummer is in my office and the two men are in a cab outside. The bank opens
  at nine, and that is in Upper Holloway."</p>

  <p>I seized my hat and made ready.</p>

  <p>"You should keep your eyes open," Hewitt hinted, "before you get to the
  bank and when you leave, as well as while you're there. Do you remember how
  poor Mason was watched? Well, there is probably some watching going on now.
  Last night, on our way to the bank and back, I believe Plummer and I were
  watched pretty closely."</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">Plummer's two plain-clothes men and I reached the
  neighbourhood of the bank with a quarter of an hour to spare, or rather more.
  We dismissed the cab at some little distance from the spot, and approached
  singly, so that it was not difficult for us to slip in separately among the
  dozen or fifteen clerks as they arrived. We passed directly into the
  manager's room, the door of which opened into the space left for the public
  before the counter. From this room the whole of the outer office was visible
  through the glass of the partition. The manager, Mr. Blockley, a quick,
  intelligent man of thirty-six or so, gave us chairs and pointed out how best
  we could watch the counter without ourselves being observed.</p>

  <p>"If a letter is sent," he said, "it will be brought here to me, of course,
  and I will bring the messenger in. If a cheque is presented from Mayes, I
  have told the cashier to slide that big ledger off his desk accidentally with
  his elbow. That will be your signal, and then you can do whatever you think
  proper. I don't think I can do any more than that."</p>

  <p>We took our positions and waited. I felt pretty sure that if Mayes sent at
  all it would be early, for obvious reasons. And I was right, for the very
  first customer was our man.</p>

  <p>He stepped in briskly scarcely a minute after the manager had ceased
  speaking, and I remembered having seen him waiting at the street corner as I
  came along. He was a well-dressed, smart enough looking man, in frock coat
  and tall hat. He took a letter-case from his pocket, picked out a cheque from
  the rest of the papers in it, and passed it under the wire grille of the
  counter.</p>

  <p>The cashier took it, turned it over, and shifted mechanically to post the
  amount in the book on his desk. As he did so his elbow touched the heavy
  ledger which the manager had pointed out to us, and it fell with a crash. The
  cashier calmly put his pen behind his ear, and stooped to pick up the book,
  but even as he did it the two Scotland Yard men were out before the counter,
  and had sidled up to the stranger, one on each side.</p>

  <p>"May we see that cheque, if you please?" asked one, and the cashier turned
  its face toward him. "Ah, just so; a hundred pounds&mdash;Mayes. We must just
  trouble you to come with us, if you please. There is some explanation wanted
  about that cheque."</p>

  <p>I had followed the two men from the manager's room, and now I saw that
  while one had laid his hand on the stranger's shoulder the other had taken
  him by the opposite arm. "Why," said the former, looking into his face, "it's
  Broady Sims!"</p>

  <p>"All right," the man growled resignedly. "It's a cop. I'll go quiet."</p>

  <p>But as he spoke I saw the free hand steal out behind him and pitch away a
  crumpled fragment of paper. One of the policemen saw it too, followed it with
  his eyes, and saw me snatch it up.</p>

  <p>"That's right, sir," he said, "take care of that; and we'll have a cab, in
  case anything else drops accidentally. It's just a turning over, Broady,
  that's what it is."</p>

  <p>I spread out the piece of paper, and was astonished to find inscribed on
  it just such another series of figures, in groups of eight, as was found in
  the cypher message in the Case of the Lever Key.</p>

  <p>Here was a great find&mdash;a secret message as clear to me as to Mayes
  himself, and as likely as not the scrap of paper that would hang him! I took
  one of the plain-clothes men aside while the other kept his hold of Broady
  Sims.</p>

  <p>"This is very important," I said. "It is a cypher message which Mr. Hewitt
  can read&mdash;or I, myself, in fact, with a little time. Must you take it
  with you? If so, I'll make a copy now."</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, we're responsible, you see," the man said, "so I think we must
  take it; so perhaps you'd better make a copy, as you suggest."</p>

  <p>"Very well," I said, "that is done in a few seconds. You can take your man
  off, and I will go direct to Mr. Hewitt and Inspector Plummer with the copy."
  And with that I made the copy, which read thus:&mdash;</p>
  <pre>
23, 19, 15, 1, 9, 14, 9, 2; 20, 8, 1,<br>
20, 14, 14, 20, 8; 14, 5, 12, 4, 9, 7,<br>
5, 14; 3, 8, 18, 23, 0, 14, 1, 8; 22,<br>
9, 6, 1, 18, 3, 5, 1; 19, 14, 15, 21,<br>
9, 0, 20, 12; 18, 12, 21, 1, 6, 23, 20,<br>
12; 9, 18, 15, 5, 18, 13, 12, 20.
</pre>

  <p>It struck me to ask the manager if the cheque just presented were one of
  those procured from Mr. Trenaman the night before, and I found that it was.
  Then I left the policemen with their prisoner and made for the nearest
  cab-rank. This cypher message, no doubt conveying Mayes's instructions to the
  man just captured, was probably of the utmost importance, and Hewitt must see
  it at once; and as the cab ambled along towards Barbican I busied myself in
  deciphering the figures according to the plan of the knight's move in chess,
  as Hewitt had explained to me. I could only see two noughts among the
  numbers, so plainly it was a longer message than the one then
  deciphered&mdash;one of sixty-two letters, in fact. I turned the figures into
  the letters corresponding in the alphabet, <i>a</i> for 1, <i>b</i> for 2,
  and so on, as Hewitt had done, and I arranged these letters in the squares of
  a roughly drawn chessboard, so that they stood thus:&mdash;</p>
  <pre>
w s o a i n i b
t h a t n n t h
n e l d i g e n
c h r w o n a h
v i f a r c e a
s n o u i o t l
r l u a f w t l
i r o e r m l t
</pre>

  <p>The letters thus set out, to read off the message was a simple task
  enough, in view of the key Hewitt had given me. I began, as in the case of
  the Lever Key message, at the right-hand top corner, and taking the knight's
  move from <i>b</i> to <i>e</i> in the last square but one of the third line,
  thence to <i>a</i> at the end of the fifth line, and so to <i>t</i> in the
  seventh line, and from that to <i>r</i> (fifth square in bottom line),
  <i>u</i> in seventh line and so on, in the order shown by the Lever Key
  message, a copy of which I kept as a curiosity in my pocket-book. So I read
  the message through, and I set it down thus:&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>Be at ruin Channel Marsh to-night twelve; wait in hall for instruc. Word
    final.</i>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The general meaning of this seemed clear enough. The man whom the
  policeman had recognised as Broady Sims was to be at some spot&mdash;a ruined
  building, it would seem&mdash;in a place called Channel Marsh, at midnight,
  there to wait in the hall for instructions; no doubt for instructions where
  to take the hundred pounds he was to have got from the bank. "Word final" was
  not so clear, though I judged&mdash;and I think rightly&mdash;that it meant
  that the word "final" was to be used as a password by which the two
  messengers should know each other.</p>

  <p>I was almost at my destination, and was cogitating the message and its
  meaning, when the cab checked at some traffic in Barbican, just by the
  "Compasses" public-house, and Mr. Victor Peytral hailed me and climbed on the
  step of the cab.</p>

  <p>"I was just going to see if Mr. Hewitt was at the place," he said, "and if
  so to ask him for news. But I am rather in a hurry, and perhaps you can tell
  me?"</p>

  <p>"We are on the track, I think," I answered, "and I have just come across
  this, which I am taking to Hewitt," and with that I showed him my translation
  of the cypher, and gave him its history in half a dozen sentences.</p>

  <p>"That's good," Peytral answered. "I don't know Channel Marsh, do you? But
  probably Mr. Hewitt does. I won't keep you any longer&mdash;I see you're
  hurrying. But I hope to see you again before long."</p>

  <p>He dropped off the step and disappeared, and the cab went on round the
  corner by the "Compasses."</p>

  <p>I found Hewitt and Plummer in the office where, on pretence of
  bookbindery, I had first seen Mayes face to face the day before. They were
  near the completion of their examination of this office and all its contents,
  and soon would begin as systematically on the premises behind. I gave Hewitt
  my copy of the cypher message, and my translation, with an exact account of
  how it had come into my possession.</p>

  <p>Martin Hewitt studied the message for a minute or two, and then relapsed
  into grave thought. So he sat for some little time, while Plummer left the
  room by the window and descended the ladder to speak with his men on guard
  below.</p>

  <p>Presently Hewitt looked up and said: "Brett, this message is most
  important&mdash;probably as important as you suppose it to be. But at the
  same time I believe you have made a great mistake about it."</p>

  <p>"But I haven't misread it, have I? Is there any other
  way&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, you haven't misread it; you've read every word as it was intended to
  be read. But it is a very different thing from what you suppose it to
  be."</p>

  <p>"What is it, then?"</p>

  <p>Martin Hewitt put the paper on the table and looked keenly in my face. "It
  is a trap," he said. "It is a trap to catch <i>me</i>&mdash;unless I flatter
  myself unduly."</p>

  <p><a id="pic27"
     name="pic27"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>I could not understand. "A trap?" I repeated. "But how?"</p>

  <p>"Why should Mayes need to send his confederate instructions by written
  note? We know the nature of his hold over his subordinates, and we know that
  it means personal communication. Also, the cheque was in Mayes's own hands
  last night. More, Mayes knows very well that I have read that
  cypher&mdash;has known it for some time; otherwise how could we have
  discovered the bonds in the case of the Lever Key? Also, Mayes knows that we
  have his cheque-book and know his bank. Didn't I assure you we were watched
  last night? I believe he knows all we have done. In such circumstances he
  might risk his jackal's liberty by sending him on the desperate chance of
  cashing a cheque, but, knowing the risk, he would never have let him come
  with information on him. And least of all would he have let him come carrying
  a vital secret written in that very cypher which he knows I read many weeks
  ago. And then see how that message, instead of being concealed, was
  positively brought to your notice! That man Broady Sims is a cunning rascal,
  and the police know him of old as a skilful swindler and bill-forger. A man
  like that doesn't get rid of a compromising scrap of paper by trundling it
  out under your nose just at the moment he is arrested, when the attention of
  everybody is directed to him; no, he would wait his opportunity, and then he
  would probably slip it into his mouth and swallow it. As it is, he would seem
  to have succeeded in dropping this paper full in your sight, with an
  elaborate pretence of secrecy. Now this is what has been done, Brett. That
  man has been sent to cash a cheque, with very little hope of success, or
  none, because the first move that Mayes would anticipate on our part would be
  the watching for him and his cheques at the bank in Upper Holloway. If by any
  chance the cheques had been cashed, well and good, no harm would have been
  done, and then Mayes could have gone on to arrange for drawing the rest of
  his balance&mdash;could probably have quite safely come himself to draw it.
  But if on the other hand, as he fully anticipated, Sims was arrested, what
  then? Nothing was lost but a penny cheque-form, and even Sims&mdash;though
  Mayes would care nothing about that&mdash;could only be searched and then
  released, for the cheque was perfectly genuine, and there was no charge
  against him. But since he would certainly be searched, that cypher note was
  given him, with instructions to make a conspicuous show of attempting to get
  rid of it. Now that note was written in a cypher which Mayes knew was as
  plain as print&mdash;to whom? To <i>me</i>. I am on his trail, and this note
  is deliberately flung in my way, open as the day, but with every appearance
  of secrecy. I am his dangerous enemy, and he knows it&mdash;as he told you,
  in fact, yesterday. If he can clear me away, he can take breath and make
  himself safe. The purpose of this note is to induce me to go, alone, to this
  place on Channel Marsh to-night at twelve, in the hope of learning where to
  find Mayes. There I am to be got rid of&mdash;murdered in some way, for which
  preparation will be made. Mayes judges my character pretty well. He knows
  that, in such circumstances as he represents, Sims being kept away from his
  appointment, I should certainly go and take his place, and use his password,
  to learn what I could. And, Brett, <i>that is precisely what I shall
  do</i>!"</p>

  <p>"What? You will go?" I exclaimed. "But you mustn't&mdash;the danger! We'd
  better both go together."</p>

  <p>Hewitt smiled. "Why not forty of us?" he said. "No. Here is a chance of
  bagging our man, for, however I am to be arranged for&mdash;whether by shot,
  steel, or the tourniquet, I make no doubt it is Mayes himself who is to do
  it. You shall come, however, you and Plummer at least. But we will not go in
  a bunch&mdash;you shall follow me and watch, ready to help when needful. This
  Channel Marsh is an empty, dark space between two channels of the Lea. It is
  among the Hackney Marshes, lying between Stratford and Homerton, and I fancy
  there is a deserted house there, though I can't remember ever having seen it.
  Do you know it?"</p>

  <p>"No; not in the least."</p>

  <p>"Well, I must reconnoitre to-day, and that with a lot of care. I think I
  told you I was convinced of being watched, and that is a thing you can't
  prevent in a place like London, if it is skilfully done. Now, Brett, you have
  done very well this morning. If you want to be on the scene of action
  to-night at twelve, you must get leave from your editor, mustn't you? How's
  your wrist?"</p>

  <p>It was still extremely stiff, and I told Hewitt that I doubted my ability
  to hold a pen for two or three days.</p>

  <p>"Very well, then; get off and convey your excuses as soon as you please. I
  shall have a talk with Plummer, and then I shall take a few hours to myself,
  by myself, in somebody else's clothes. Be in your rooms all the evening, for
  you may expect a message."</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p class="first">It was at a little past nine in the evening that I next saw
  Hewitt. He came into my rooms in an incongruous get-up. He wore corduroy
  trousers, a very dirty striped jersey, a particularly greasy old jacket, and
  a twisted neckcloth; but over all was an excellent overcoat, and on his head
  a tall hat of high polish.</p>

  <p>"Brought to me by Kerrett," he said, in explanation of the hat and
  overcoat. "He's been waiting with them for a long time in a court by Milford
  Lane. A good hat and overcoat will cover anything, and I preferred to enter
  this building in my own character. I've been wearing that this afternoon,"
  and he pulled out of his pocket an old peaked cap with ear-pieces tied over
  the top.</p>

  <p>"You mustn't bring your best clothes," he went on, "or you'll spoil them
  scrambling about boats and groping in ditches. I have done my ditch-groping
  for the day, and I'm going to change. You had best be putting on older things
  while I get into newer."</p>

  <p>"What sort of place is this Channel Marsh?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, I should think there must be a great many better places to spend a
  night in. It must be the dreariest, wettest flat within many miles of London,
  and I should like to see the portrait of the man who had the idea of building
  a house there. For a house there is, or rather the ruins of it&mdash;deserted
  for years, and half carried away by rats and people who wanted slates and
  firewood and water pipes."</p>

  <p>"Is that the place where you intend waiting to-night?"</p>

  <p>"It is. I haven't examined it nearly so closely as I should like, for fear
  of raising a scare. Channel Marsh is almost an island, with a narrow neck of
  an entrance at each end. A foot-track runs the whole length, and a person in
  the ruined house can easily see anybody entering the Marsh from either end.
  For that reason I reconnoitred from a boat&mdash;the boat you will go in
  to-night. I think it is the very dirtiest old tub I ever saw, so that it
  suited my rig out. I discovered it at a wharf some little way down the river,
  and I paid a shilling for the hire of it. Channel Marsh is banked a bit on
  one side, and I crept up under cover of the bank. I learned very little,
  beyond the general lie of the land, because I was so mighty cautious. I
  judged it better to be content with half an examination, rather than drive
  away the game. And even as it is I've an idea I have been seen. I lay up
  among some reeds till dark, but after that I am <i>sure</i> there was
  somebody on the Marsh&mdash;and skulking, too, like me. So after waiting and
  scouting for a little I gave it up and paddled quietly back."</p>

  <p>"But look here, Hewitt," I said, "this seems a bit mad. Why go and risk
  yourself as you talk of doing? You believe Mayes will be there, at the ruin,
  or will come there at twelve. Very well, then, why can't the police send
  enough men to surround the place and capture him for certain?"</p>

  <p>Hewitt smiled and shook his head. "My dear Brett," he said, "you haven't
  seen the place, and I have. It will be hard enough job for you and Plummer to
  get near the spot unobserved, guided by a man who knows every inch. A
  trampling crowd of policemen would have as much chance as a herd of
  elephants, and on such light nights as we are having now they would be seen a
  mile off. And who knows what scouts he may have out? No, as I say, it will be
  a great piece of luck if you get through unobserved as it is, and even now
  I'm not perfectly certain that I couldn't do best alone. However,
  arrangements are made now, and you are coming, three of you."</p>

  <p>"Then what are the arrangements?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Just these. You are to leave here first. Make the best of your way to
  Mile End Gate, where an old inn stands in the middle of the road. Go to the
  corner of the turning opposite this, at the south side of the road. At eleven
  o'clock a four-wheeler will drive up, with Plummer and one of his men in it.
  The man is one who knows all the geography of Channel Marsh, and he also
  knows exactly where to find the boat I used to-day. You will drive to a
  little way beyond Bow Bridge, and then Plummer's man will lead you to the
  boat. You had better scull and leave the others to look out. They will know
  what to do. You will pull along to a place where you can watch till you see
  me coming on to the Marsh by the path. As soon as you see me you will slip
  quietly along to a place the policeman will show you, close to the ruin, and
  watch again. That's all. I don't know whether or not you think it worth while
  to take a pistol. I certainly shall; but then I'm most likely to want it.
  Plummer will have one."</p>

  <p>I thought it well worth while, and I took my regulation "Webley"&mdash;a
  relic of my old Volunteer captaincy. Then, by way of the underground railway,
  I gained the neighbourhood of Mile End, and interested myself about its back
  streets till the time approached to look for Plummer's cab.</p>

  <p>Plummer was more than punctual&mdash;indeed, he was two or three minutes
  before his time. The cab drew near the kerb and scarcely stopped, so quickly
  did I scramble in.</p>

  <p>"Good," said Plummer; "we're well ahead of time. Mr. Hewitt quite
  right?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," I said. "I left him so an hour and a half ago at his office." And
  we sat silent while the cab rattled and rumbled over the stony road to Bow
  Bridge, and the shopkeepers on the way put up their shutters and extinguished
  their lights.</p>

  <p>Bow Bridge was reached and passed, and presently we stopped the cab and
  alighted. Here Styles, Plummer's man, took the lead, and a little way farther
  along the road we turned into a dark and muddy lane on the left. We
  floundered through this for some hundred and fifty yards or so, and then
  suddenly drew in at an opening on the right. Here we stood for a few moments
  while our guide groped his way down toward the muddy water we could smell,
  rather than see, a little way before us.</p>

  <p>There were a few broken steps and a broad black thing which was the boat.
  We got into it as silently as we could manage, and cast off. It was a clumsy,
  broad-beamed, leaky old conveyance, and that it was as dirty as Hewitt had
  described it I could feel as I groped for the sculls and got them out. The
  night was light and dark by turns&mdash;changing with the clouds. We shipped
  the rudder, and Styles steered, or I should probably have run ashore more
  than once, for the banks were not always distinct, and the channel was narrow
  and dark. We passed the black forms of several factories with tall chimneys,
  and then drew out among the Marshes, flat and grey, with wisps of mist lying
  here and there. So we went in silence for a while, till at last we drew in
  against the bank on the left and laid hold by a post at a landing-place.</p>

  <p>"This is the Channel Marsh," whispered Styles, as we climbed cautiously
  ashore. "We can't see the house very well from here, but there's where Mr.
  Hewitt will come through."</p>

  <p>Looking over the top of the low bank, we could discern a path which
  traversed the length of the marsh, entering it by a broken gate at a neck of
  land which we must have passed on our way. Here we crouched and waited. We
  had heard the half-hour struck on some distant clock soon after entering the
  boat, and now we waited anxiously for the three-quarters. So long did the
  time seem to my excited perceptions that I had quite decided that the clock
  must have stopped, or, at any rate, did not chime quarters, when at last the
  strokes came, distant and plaintive, over the misty flats.</p>

  <p>"A quarter of an hour," Plummer remarked. "He won't be a minute late, nor
  a minute too early, from what I know of him. How long will it take him from
  that gate to the ruin?"</p>

  <p>"Eight or nine minutes, good," Styles answered.</p>

  <p>"Then we shall see him in seven minutes or six minutes, as the case may
  be," Plummer rejoined in the same low tones.</p>

  <p>Slowly the minutes dragged, with not a sound about us save the sucking and
  lapping of the muddy river and the occasional flop of a water-rat. The dark
  clouds were now fewer, and the moon was high and only partially obscured by
  the thinner clouds that traversed its face. More than once I fancied a sound
  from the direction of the ruin, and then I doubted my fancy; when at last
  there was a sound indeed, but from the opposite direction, and in a moment we
  saw Hewitt, muffled close about the neck, walking briskly up the path.</p>

  <p>We regained the boat with all possible speed and silence, and I pulled my
  best, regardless of my stiff wrist. During our watch I had had time to
  perceive the wisdom of the arrangements which had been made. We had been
  watching from a place fairly out of sight from the ruin, yet sufficiently
  near it to be able to reach its neighbourhood before Hewitt; and certainly it
  was better to approach the actual spot at the same time as Hewitt himself,
  for then, if he were being watched for, the attention of the watcher would be
  diverted from us.</p>

  <p>Presently we reached the reed-bed that Hewitt had spoken of, and I could
  see a sort of little creek or inlet. Here I ceased to pull, and Styles
  cautiously punted us into the creek with one of the sculls. The boat grounded
  noiselessly in the mud, and we crept ashore one at a time through mud and
  sedge.</p>

  <p>The creek was edged with a bank of rough, broken ground, grown with coarse
  grass and bramble, and as we peeped over this bank the ruined house stood
  before us&mdash;so near as to startle me by its proximity. It must have been
  a large house originally&mdash;if, indeed, it was ever completed. Now it
  stood roofless, dismantled, and windowless, and in many places whole rods of
  brickwork had fallen and now littered the ground about. The black gap of the
  front door stood plain to see, with a short flight of broken steps before it,
  and by the side of these a thick timber shore supported the front wall. It
  struck me then that the ruin was perhaps largely due to a failure of the
  marshy foundation.</p>

  <p>The place seemed silent and empty. Hewitt's footsteps were now plain to
  hear, and presently he appeared, walking briskly as before. He could not see
  us, and did not look for us, but made directly for the broken steps. He
  mounted these, paused on the topmost, and struck a match. It seemed a rather
  large hall, and I caught a momentary glimpse of bare rafters and plasterless
  wall. Then the match went out and Hewitt stepped within.</p>

  <p><a id="pic28"
     name="pic28"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1403201h-images/Triangle-6-4.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>Almost on the instant there came a loud jar, and a noise of falling
  bricks; and then, in the same instant of time I heard a terrific crash, and
  saw Hewitt leap out at the front door&mdash;leap out, as it seemed, from a
  cloud of dust and splinters.</p>

  <p>I sprang to my feet, but Plummer pulled me down again. "Steady!" he said,
  "lie low! He isn't hurt. Wait and see before we show ourselves."</p>

  <p>It seemed that the floor above had fallen on the spot where Hewitt had
  been standing. He had alighted from his leap on hands and knees, but now
  stood facing the house, revolver in hand, watching.</p>

  <p>There was a moment's pause, a sound of movement from the upper part of the
  ruin, another quiet moment, and then a bang and a flash from high on the wall
  to the right. Hewitt sprang to shelter behind the heavy shore, and another
  shot followed him, scoring a white line across the thick timber.</p>

  <p>Plummer was up, and Styles and I were after him.</p>

  <p>"There he is!" cried Plummer, "up on the coping!" I pulled out my own
  pistol.</p>

  <p>"Don't shoot!" cried Hewitt. "We'll take him alive!"</p>

  <p>Far to the right, on the topmost coping of the front wall, I could see a
  crouching figure. I saw it rise to its knees, and once more raise an arm to
  take aim at Hewitt; and then, with a sudden cry, another human figure
  appeared from behind the coping and sprang upon the first. There was a moment
  of struggle, and then the rotten coping crumbled, and down, down, came bricks
  and men together.</p>

  <p>I sickened. I can only explain my feeling by saying that never before had
  I seen anything that seemed so long in falling as those two men. And then
  with a horrid crash they struck the broken ground, and the pistol fired again
  with the shock.</p>

  <p>We reached them in a dozen strides, and turned them over, limp, oozing,
  and lifeless. And then we saw that one was Mayes, and the other&mdash;Victor
  Peytral!</p>

  <p>We kept no silence now, but Plummer blew his whistle loud and long, and I
  fired my revolver into the air, chamber after chamber. Styles started off at
  a run along the path towards the town lights, to fetch what aid he might.</p>

  <p>But even then we had doubt if any aid would avail Mayes. He was the under
  man in the fall, and he had dropped across a little heap of bricks. He now
  lay unconscious, breathing heavily, with a terrible wound at the back of the
  head, and Hewitt foretold&mdash;and rightly&mdash;that when the doctor did
  come he would find a broken spine. Peytral, on the other hand, though
  unconscious, showed no sign of injury, and just before the doctor came sighed
  heavily and turned on his side.</p>

  <p>First there came policemen, and then in a little time a hastily dressed
  surgeon, and after him an ambulance. Mayes was carried off to hospital, but
  with a good deal of rubbing and a little brandy, Peytral came round well
  enough to be helped over the Marshes to a cab.</p>

  <p>The trap which had been laid for Hewitt was simple, but terribly
  effective. The floor above the hall&mdash;loose and broken
  everywhere&mdash;was supported on rafters, and the rafters were crossed
  underneath and supported at the centre by a stout beam. The rafters had been
  sawn through at both ends, and the rotten floor had been piled high with
  broken brick and stone to a weight of a ton or more. The end of a loose beam
  had been wedged obliquely under the end of the one timber now supporting the
  whole weight, so that a pull on the opposite end of this long lever would
  force away the bricks on which the beam rested and let the whole weight fall.
  It was the jar of the beam and the fall of the first few loose bricks that
  had so far warned Hewitt as to enable him to leap from under the floor almost
  as it fell.</p>

  <p>Peytral's sudden appearance, when we had time to reflect on it, gave us a
  suspicion as to some at least of the espionage to which Hewitt had been
  subjected&mdash;a suspicion confirmed, later, by Peytral himself after his
  recovery from the shock of the fall. For fresh news of his enemy had
  re-awakened all his passion, and since he alone could not find him, he was
  willing enough to let Hewitt do the tracking down, if only he himself might
  clutch Mayes's throat in the end. This explained the "business" that had
  called him away after the Barbican stronghold had been captured; finding both
  Hewitt and Plummer somewhat uncommunicative, and himself somewhat "out of
  it," he had drawn off, and had followed Hewitt's every movement, confident
  that he would be led to his old enemy at last. What I had told him of the
  cypher message had led him to hunt out Channel Marsh in the afternoon, and to
  return at midnight. He, of course, regarded the message, as I did myself at
  the time, as a perfectly genuine instruction from Mayes to Sims, and he came
  to the rendezvous wholly in ignorance as to what Hewitt was doing, and with
  no better hope than that he might hear something that would lead him in the
  direction of Mayes. He had entered the marsh after dark from the upper end,
  and had lain concealed by the other channel till near midnight; then he had
  crept to the rear of the ruin and climbed to where an opening seemed to offer
  a good chance of hearing what might pass in the hall. He had heard Hewitt
  approach from the front, and the crash that followed. The rest we had
  seen.</p>

  <h3>V</h3>

  <p class="first">Mayes never recovered consciousness, and was dead when we
  visited the hospital the day after; both skull and spine were badly
  fractured. And the very last we saw of the Red Triangle was the implement
  with which it had been impressed, which was found in his pocket.</p>

  <p>It was a small triangular prism of what I believe is called soapstone. It
  was perhaps four inches long, and the face at the end corresponded with the
  mark that Hewitt had seen on the forehead of Mr. Jacob Mason. It fitted
  closely in a leather case, in the end of which was a small, square metal box
  full of the red, greasy pigment with which the mark had been impressed.</p>

  <p>It was from Broady Sims that we learnt the exact use and meaning of this
  implement: though he would not say a word till he had seen with his own eyes
  Mayes lying dead in the mortuary. Then he gasped his relief and said, "That's
  the end of something worse than slavery for me! I'll turn straight after
  this."</p>

  <p>Sims's story was long, and it went over ground that concerns none of
  Hewitt's adventures. But what we learned from it was briefly this. It had
  been Mayes's way to meet clever criminals as they left gaol after a term of
  imprisonment. In this manner he had met Sims. He had made great promises, had
  spoken of great ideas which they could put into execution together, had lent
  him money, and then at last had "initiated" him, as he called it. He had put
  him to lie back in a chair and had directed his gaze on the Red Triangle held
  in the air before him: and then the Triangle had descended gently, and he
  felt sleepy, till at the cold touch of the thing on his forehead his senses
  had gone. This was done more than once, and in the end the victim found that
  Mayes had only to raise the Triangle before him to send him to sleep
  instantly. Then he found that he must do certain things, whether he wanted or
  not. And it ended in complete subservience; so that Mayes could set him to
  perpetrate a robbery and then appropriate the proceeds for himself, for by
  post-hypnotic suggestion he could force him to bring and hand over every
  penny. More, the poor wretch was held in constant terror, for he knew that
  his very life depended on the lift of his master's hand. He could be sent
  into lethargy by a gesture and killed in that state. That very thing was
  done, in fact, as we have seen, in two cases.</p>

  <p>Sims was but one of a gang of such criminals, brought to heel and made
  victims. Their minds and souls, such as they were, had passed into the
  miscreant's keeping, and terror reinforced the power of hypnotism. They
  committed crimes, and when they failed they took the punishment; when they
  succeeded Mayes took the gains, or at any rate the greater part of them. He
  went, also, among people who were not yet criminals, and by degrees made them
  so, to his own profit. The case of Henning, the correspondence clerk, was one
  that had come under Hewitt's eyes. He used his faculty also with great
  cunning in other ways&mdash;as we had seen in the matter of the Admiralty
  code. And it was even said among the gang that a man he had once hypnotised
  he could force by suggestion to commit suicide when he became useless or
  inconvenient.</p>

  <p>Sims and the ragged fellow who had decoyed me into Mayes's den were the
  only members of the gang whom we could identify after his death, but many
  others must have shared their relief; and I sincerely hope&mdash;though I
  hardly expect&mdash;that they all availed themselves of their liberty to
  abandon their evil courses. As in fact the two I speak of did, and took to
  honest work.</p>

  <p>All that had remained mysterious in the earlier cases now became clear. In
  the first, the case of Samuel's diamonds, Denson had been put into the office
  where Samuel had found him, by Mayes, with the express design of effecting a
  diamond robbery. The robbery was effected, and the unhappy Denson formed a
  plan of making a bolt of it himself with the diamonds. He was, perhaps, what
  is called a difficult subject in hypnotism&mdash;amenable enough to direct
  influence, but not sufficiently retentive of post-hypnotic suggestion. He hid
  the jewels and adopted a disguise, but Mayes was watching him better than he
  supposed. The diamonds were lost, but Denson was found and done to
  death&mdash;probably not in that retreat near Barbican, but at night in some
  empty street. The diamonds were not found on him, and the body, with the mark
  of the Triangle still on it, was taken by night to a central spot in London
  and there left. Mayes probably thought that a notable example like this, so
  boldly displayed and so conspicuously reported in the Press, would impress
  his auxiliaries throughout London with the terror that was one of his
  weapons; for they would well understand the meaning of the Red Triangle, and
  they would receive a striking illustration of the consequences of rebellion
  or bad faith. The money and the watch were left in the pockets because they
  were trifles after the loss of fifteen thousand pounds' worth of diamonds,
  and their presence in the pockets made the murder the less easy to
  understand&mdash;which was a point gained. And as to the keys&mdash;Mayes
  knew nothing of where the diamonds were hidden, and so had no use for them.
  For where could he use them? Denson had left his lodgings, and as to the
  office, that, he would guess, would be in the hands of the police, on
  Samuel's complaint. The immediate result of this affair on the only honest
  member of Mayes's circle I have told in the case of Mr. Jacob Mason. He was
  not yet thoroughly in Mayes's hands, but he had "dabbled," as he remorsefully
  confessed, and Mayes had already found him useful. He was dangerous, and his
  end came quickly. Another victim who had probably begun innocently enough was
  Henning, the clerk to Kingsley, Bell and Dalton, and his death in the Penn's
  Meadow barn leaves a mystery that never can be positively cleared up. Was it
  murder or was it suicide by post-hypnotic suggestion? It will be remembered
  that the fire burst out in the barn after Mayes had left it.</p>

  <p>The case of Mr. Telfer was explained clearly enough by Hewitt at the time;
  but it is an example of the snares that lie open for the most innocent person
  who allows himself to be made the subject of hypnotic experiments at the
  hands of persons with whom, and with whose objects, he is not thoroughly
  acquainted. And it must be remembered that at this time there are persons
  advertising to teach the practice of hypnotism to anybody who will pay; to
  anybody who may use the terrible power as he pleases. More, the danger is so
  great that it has led two eminent men of science to issue a public protest
  and warning, with an urgent plea that the practice of hypnotism be restricted
  by law at least as closely as that of vivisection.</p>

  <p>As to what would have happened if Plummer and I had yielded to Mayes's
  threats so far as to undergo the "initiation" he proposed, at the time we
  were helpless in his hands&mdash;of that I have little doubt. I cannot
  suppose that he would have wasted much time over me, once I had fallen
  lethargic. When Hewitt burst in he would have found me lying dead, with the
  Red Triangle on my forehead. It would have saved Mayes a lot of noise and
  struggle, at least.</p>

  <p>But I often wonder whether or not there was anything in his reference to
  the place beyond the sea, where he would make me a great man if I did as he
  wished. Was it his design, having accumulated sufficient wealth, to return
  and take his natural place among the enlightened rulers of Hayti? He would
  not have been so much worse than some of the others.</p>
