<p style="text-indent:0">THAT there wagon rolled up the trail and
stopped in front of our cabin one morning jest after sun-up. We all
come out to see who it was, because strangers ain't common on Bear
Creek&mdash;and not very often welcome, neither. They was a long,
hungry-looking old coot driving, and four or five growed boys
sticking their heads out.</p>

<p>"Good mornin', folks," said the old coot, taking off his hat.
"My name is Joshua Richardson. I'm headin' a wagon-train of
immigrants which is lookin' for a place to settle. The rest of
'em's camped three miles back down the trail. Everybody we met in
these here Humbolt Mountings told us we'd hev to see Mister Roaring
Bill Elkins about settlin' here-abouts. Be you him?"</p>

<p>"I'm Bill Elkins," says pap suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Well, Mister Elkins," says Old Man Richardson, wagging his
chin-whiskers, "we'd admire it powerful if you folks would let us
people settle somewheres about."</p>

<p>"Hmmmm!" says pap, pulling his beard. "Whar you all from?"</p>

<p>"Kansas," says Old Man Richardson.</p>

<p>"Ouachita," says pap, "git my shotgun."</p>

<p>"Don't you do no sech thing, Ouachie," says maw. "Don't be
stubborn, Willyum. The war's been over for years."</p>

<p>"That's what I say," hastily spoke up Old Man Richardson. "Let
bygones be bygones, I says!"</p>

<p>"What," says pap ominously, "is yore honest opinion of General
Sterlin' Price?"</p>

<p>"One of nature's noblemen!" declares Old Man Richardson
earnestly.</p>

<p>"Hmmmmm!" says pap. "You seem to have considerable tact and
hoss-sense for a Red-laig. But they hain't no more room on Bear
Creek fer no more settlers, even if they was Democrats. They's nine
er ten families now within a rech of a hunnert square miles, and I
don't believe in over-crowdin' a country."</p>

<p>"But we're plumb tuckered out!" wailed Old Man Richardson. "And
nowheres to go! We hev been driv from pillar to post, by settlers
which got here ahead of us and grabbed all the best land. They
claims it whether they got any legal rights or not."</p>

<p>"Legal rights be damned," snorted pap. "Shotgun rights is what
goes in this country. But I know jest the place fer you. It's ten
er fifteen days' travel from here, in Arizony. It's called Bowie
Knife Canyon, and hit's jest right fer farmin' people, which I
jedge you all be."</p>

<p>"We be," says Old Man Richardson. "But how we goin' to git
there?"</p>

<p>"My son Breckinridge will be plumb delighted to guide you
there," says pap. "Won't you, Breckinridge?"</p>

<p>"No, I won't," I said. "Why the tarnation have <i>I</i> got to
be picked on to ride herd on a passle of tenderfooted
mavericks&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He'll git you there safe," says pap, ignoring my remarks. "He
dotes on lendin' folks a helpin' hand, don't you,
Breckinridge?"</p>

<p>Seeing the futility of argyment, I merely snarled and went to
saddle Cap'n Kidd. I noticed Old Man Richardson and his boys
looking at me in a very pecooliar manner all the time, and when I
come out on Cap'n Kidd, him snorting and bucking and kicking the
rails out of the corral like he always does, they turnt kind of
pale and Old Man Richardson said: "I wouldn't want to impose on
yore son, Mister Elkins. After all, we wasn't intendin' to go to
that there canyon, in the first place&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm guidin' you to Bowie Knife Canyon!" I roared. "Maybe you
warn't goin' there before I saddled my hoss, but you air now!
C'm'on."</p>

<p>I then cut loose under the mules' feet with my .45s to kind of
put some ginger in the critters, and they brayed and sot off down
the trail jest hitting the high places with Old Man Richardson
hanging onto the lines and bouncing all over the seat and his sons
rolling in the wagon-bed.</p>

<p>We come into camp full tilt, and some of the men grabbed their
guns and the women hollered and jerked up their kids, and one
feller was so excited he fell into a big pot of beans which was
simmering over a fire and squalled out that the Injuns was trying
to burn him alive.</p>

<p>Old Man Richardson had his feet braced again the front-gate,
pulling back on the lines as hard as he could and yelling bloody
murder, but the mules had the bits betwixt their teeth. So I rode
to their heads and grabbed 'em by the bridles and throwed 'em back
onto their haunches, and Old Man Richardson ought to of knew the
stop would be sudden. T'warn't my fault he done a dive off of the
seat and hit on the wagon-tongue on his head. And it warn't my
fault neither that one of the mules kicked him and t'other'n bit
him before I could ontangle him from amongst them. Mules is mean
critters howsoever you take 'em.</p>

<p>Everybody hollered amazing, and he riz up and mopped the blood
offa his face and waved his arms and hollered: "Ca'm down,
everybody! This hain't nawthin' to git excited about. This gent is
Mister Breckinridge Elkins, which has kindly agreed to guide us to
a land of milk and honey down in Arizony."</p>

<p>They received the news without enthusiasm. They was about fifty
of 'em, mostly women, chillern, and half-grown young 'uns. They
warn't more'n a dozen fit fighting men in the train. They all
looked like they'd been on the trail a long time. And they was all
some kin to Old Man Richardson&mdash;sons and daughters, and
grandchillern, and nieces and nephews, and their husbands and
wives, and sech like. They was one real purty gal, the old man's
youngest daughter Betty, who warn't yet married.</p>

<p>They'd jest et breakfast and was hitched up when we arrove, so
we pulled out without no more delay. I rode along of Old Man
Richardson's wagon, which went ahead with the others strung out
behind, and he says to me: "If this here Bowie Knife Canyon is sech
a remarkable place, why ain't it already been settled?"</p>

<p>"Aw, they was a settlement there," I said, "but the Apaches kilt
some, and Mexicans bandits kilt some, and about three years ago the
survivors got to fightin' amongst theirselves and jest kind of kilt
each other off."</p>

<p>He yanked his beard nervously and said: "I dunno! I dunno! Maybe
we had ought to hunt a more peaceful spot than that there sounds
like."</p>

<p>"You won't find no peaceful spots west of the Pecos," I assured
him. "Say no more about it. I've made up our minds that Bowie Knife
Canyon is the place for you all, and we're goin' there!"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't think of argyin' the p'int," he assured me hastily.
"What towns does we pass on our way."</p>

<p>"Jest one," I said. "War Smoke, right on the Arizona line. Tell
yore folks to keep out of it. It's a hangout for every kind of a
outlaw. I jedge yore boys ain't handy enough with weppins to mix in
sech company."</p>

<p>"We don't want no trouble," says he. "I'll tell 'em."</p>

<p>So we rolled along, and the journey was purty uneventful except
for the usual mishaps which generally happens to tenderfeet. But we
progressed, until we was within striking distance of the Arizona
border. And there we hit a snag. The rear wagon bogged in a creek
we had to cross a few miles north of the line. They'd been a head
rise, and the wagons churned the mud so the last one stuck fast. It
was getting on toward sun-down, and I told the others to go on and
make camp a mile west of War Smoke, and me and the folks in the
wagon would foller when we got it out.</p>

<p>But that warn't easy. It was mired clean to the hubs, and the
mules was up to their bellies. We pried and heaved and hauled, and
night was coming on, and finally I said: "If I could git them
cussed mules out of my way, I might accomplish somethin'."</p>

<p>So we unhitched 'em from the wagon, but they was stuck too, and
I had to wade out beside 'em and lift 'em out of the mud one by one
and tote 'em to the bank. A mule is a helpless critter. But then,
with them out of the way, I laid hold of the tongue and hauled the
wagon out of the creek in short order. Them Kansas people sure did
look surprized, I dunno why.</p>

<p>Time we'd scraped the mud offa the wagon and us, and hitched up
the mules again, it was night, and so it was long after dark when
we come up to the camp the rest of the train had made in the place
I told 'em. Old Man Richardson come up to me looking worried, and
he says: "Mister Elkins, some of the boys went into that there town
in spite of what I told 'em."</p>

<p>"Don't worry," I says. "I'll go git 'em."</p>

<p>I clumb on Cap'n Kidd without stopping to eat supper, and rode
over to War Smoke, and tied my hoss outside the only saloon they
was there. It was a small town, and awful hard looking. As I went
into the saloon I seen the four Richardson boys, and they was
surrounded by a gang of cut-throats and outlaws. They was a Mexican
there, too, a tall, slim cuss, with a thin black mustash, and gilt
braid onto his jacket.</p>

<p>"So you theenk you settle in Bowie Knife Canyon, eh?" he says,
and one of the boys said: "Well, that's what we was aimin' to
do."</p>

<p>"I theenk not," he said, grinning like a cougar, and I seen his
hands steal to the ivory-handled guns at his hips. "You never heard
of Señor Gonzeles Zamora? No? Well, he is a beeg <i>hombre</i> in
thees country, and he has use for thees canyon in hees
business."</p>

<p>"Start the fireworks whenever yo're ready, Gomez," muttered a
white desperado. "We're backin' yore play."</p>

<p>The Richardson boys didn't know what the deal was about, but
they seen they was up agen real trouble, and they turnt pale and
looked around like trapped critters, seeing nothing but hostile
faces and hands gripping guns.</p>

<p>"Who tell you you could settle thees canyon?" ast Gomez. "Who
breeng you here? Somebody from Kansas? Yes? No?"</p>

<p>"No," I said, shouldering my way through the crowd. "My folks
come from Texas. My granddaddy was at San Jacinto. You remember
that?"</p>

<p>His hands fell away from his guns and his brown hide turnt ashy.
The rest of them renegades give back, muttering: "Look out, boys!
It's Breckinridge Elkins!"</p>

<p>They all suddenly found they had business at the bar, or playing
cards, or something, and Gomez found hisself standing alone. He
licked his lips and looked sick, but he tried to keep up his
bluff.</p>

<p>"You maybe no like what I say about Señor Zamora?" says he. "But
ees truth. If I tell him gringoes come to Bowie Knife Canyon, he
get very mad!"</p>

<p>"Well, suppose you go tell him now," I said, and so as to give
him a good start, I picked him up and throwed him through the
nearest winder.</p>

<p>He picked hisself up and staggered away, streaming blood and Mex
profanity, and them in the saloon maintained a kind of pallid
silence. I hitched my guns for'ard, and said to the escaped convict
which was tending bar, I says: "You don't want me to pay for that
winder, do you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" says he, polishing away with his rag at a spittoon he
must of thought was a beer mug. "Oh, no, no, no, no! We needed that
winder busted fer the ventilation!"</p>

<p>"Then everybody's satisfied," I suggested, and all the
hoss-thieves and stagecoach bandits in the saloon give me a hearty
agreement.</p>

<p>"That's fine," I says. "Peace is what I aim to have, if I have
to lick every &mdash;&mdash; in the joint to git it. You boys git
back to the camp."</p>

<p>They was glad to do so, but I lingered at the bar, and bought a
drink for a train-robber I'd knowed at Chawed Ear onst, and I said:
"Jest who is this cussed Zamora that Mex was spielin' about?"</p>

<p>"I dunno," says he. "I never heard of him before."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't say you was lyin'," I said tolerantly. "Yo're jest
sufferin' from loss of memory. Frequently cases like that is cured
and their memory restored by a severe shock or jolt like a lick
onto the head. Now then, if I was to take my six-shooter butt and
drive yore head through that whiskey barrel with it, I bet it'd
restore yore memory right sudden."</p>

<p>"Hold on!" says he in a hurry. "I jest remembered that Zamora is
the boss of a gang of Mexicans which claims Bowie Knife Canyon. He
deals in hosses."</p>

<p>"You mean he steals hosses," I says, and he says: "I ain't
argyin'. Anyway, the canyon is very convenient for his business,
and if you dump them immigrants in his front yard, he'll be very
much put out."</p>

<p>"He sure will," I agreed. "As quick as I can git my hands onto
him."</p>

<p>I finished my drink and strode to the door and turnt suddenly
with a gun in each hand. The nine or ten fellers which had drawed
their guns aiming to shoot me in the back as I went through the
door, they dropped their weppins and throwed up their hands and
yelled: "Don't shoot!" So I jest shot the lights out, and then went
out and got onto Cap'n Kidd whilst them idjits was hollering and
falling over each other in the dark, and rode out of War Smoke,
casually shattering a few winder lights along the street as I
went.</p>

<p>When I got back to camp the boys had already got there, and the
whole wagon train was holding their weppins and scairt most to
death.</p>

<p>"I'm mighty relieved to see you back safe, Mister Elkins," says
Old Man Richardson. "We heard the shootin' and was afeared them
bullies had kilt you. Le's hitch up and pull out right now!"</p>

<p>Them tenderfoots is beyond my comprehension. They'd of all
pulled out in the dark if I'd let 'em, and I believe most of 'em
stayed awake all night, expecting to be butchered in their sleep. I
didn't say nothing to them about Zamora. The boys hadn't understood
what Gomez was talking about, and they warn't no use getting 'em
worse scairt than what they generally was.</p>

<p><br>
Well, we pulled out before daylight, because I aimed to rech the
canyon without another stop. We kept rolling and got there purty
late that night. It warn't really no canyon at all, but a whopping
big valley, well timbered, and mighty good water and grass. It was
a perfect place for a settlement, as I p'inted out, but tenderfoots
is powerful pecooliar. I happened to pick our camp site that night
on the spot where the Apaches wiped out a mule-train of Mexicans
six years before, and it was too dark to see the bones scattered
around till next morning. Old Man Richardson was using what he
thought was a round rock for a piller, and when he woke up the next
morning and found he'd been sleeping with his head onto a human
skull he like to throwed a fit.</p>

<p>And when I wanted to stop for the noonday meal in that there
grove where the settlers hanged them seven cattle-rustlers three
years before, them folks got the willies when they seen some of the
ropes still sticking onto the limbs, and wouldn't on no account eat
their dinner there. You got no idee what pecooliar folks them
immigrants is till you've saw some.</p>

<p>Well, we stopped a few miles further on, in another grove in the
midst of a wide rolling country with plenty of trees and tall
grass, and I didn't tell 'em that was where them outlaws murdered
the three Grissom boys in their sleep. Old Man Richardson said it
looked like as good a place as any to locate the settlement. But I
told him we was going to look over the whole derned valley before
we chosed a spot. He kind of wilted and said at least for God's
sake let 'em rest a few days.</p>

<p>I never seen folks which tired out so easy, but I said all
right, and we camped there that night. I hadn't saw no signs of
Zamora's gang since we come into the valley, and thought likely
they was all off stealing hosses somewhere. Not that it made any
difference.</p>

<p><br>
Early next morning Ned and Joe, the old man's boys, they wanted to
look for deer, and I told 'em not to go more'n a mile from camp,
and be keerful, and they said they would, and sot out to the
south.</p>

<p>I went back of the camp a mile or so to the creek where Jim
Dornley ambushed Tom Harrigan four years before, and taken me a
swim. I stayed longer'n I intended to, it was sech a relief to get
away from them helpless tenderfoots for a while, and when I rode
back into camp, I seen Ned approaching with a stranger&mdash;a
young white man, which carried hisself with a air of great
importance.</p>

<p>"Hey, pap!" hollered young Ned as they dismounted. "Where's
Mister Elkins? This feller says we can't stay in Bowie Knife
Canyon!"</p>

<p>"Who're you?" I demanded, emerging from behind a wagon, and the
stranger's eyes bugged out as he seen me.</p>

<p>"My name's George Warren," says he. "A wagon train of us just
came into the valley from the east yesterday. We're from
Illinois."</p>

<p>"And by what right does you order people outa this canyon?" I
ast.</p>

<p>"We got the fightin'est man in the world guidin' us," says he.
"I thought he was the biggest man in the world till I seen you. But
he ain't to be fooled with. When he heard they was another train in
the valley, he sent me to tell you to git. You better, too, if you
got any sense!"</p>

<p>"We don't want no trouble!" quavered Old Man Richardson.</p>

<p>"You got a nerve!" I snorted, and I pulled George Warren's hat
down so the brim come off and hung around his neck like a collar,
and turnt him around and lifted him off the ground with a boot in
the pants, and then throwed him bodily onto his hoss. "Go back and
tell yore champeen that Bowie Knife Canyon belongs to us!" I
roared, slinging a few bullets around his hoss' feet. "And we gives
him one hour to hitch up and clear out!"</p>

<p>"I'll git even for this!" wept George Warren, as he streaked it
for his home range. "You'll be sorry, you big polecat! Jest wait'll
I tell Mister&mdash;" I couldn't catch what else he said.</p>

<p>"Now I bet he's mad," says Old Man Richardson. "We better go.
After all&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shet up!" I roared. "This here valley's our'n, and I intends to
defend our rights to the last drop of yore blood! Hitch them mules
and swing the wagons in a circle! Pile yore saddles and plunder
betwixt the wheels. I got a idee you all fights better behind
breastworks. Did you see their camp, Ned?"</p>

<p>"Naw," says he, "but George Warren said it lies about three
miles east of our'n. Me and Joe got separated and I was swingin'
east around the south end of that ridge over there, when I met this
George Warren. He said he was out lookin' for a hoss before sun-up
and seen our camp and went back and told their guide, and he sent
him over to tell us to git out."</p>

<p>"I'm worried about Joe," said Old Man Richardson. "He ain't come
back."</p>

<p>"I'll go look for him," I said. "I'll also scout their camp, and
if the odds ain't more'n ten to one, we don't wait for 'em to
attack. We goes over and wipes 'em out <i>pronto.</i> Then we hangs
their fool sculps to our wagon bows as a warnin' to other sech
scoundrels."</p>

<p>Old Man Richardson turnt pale and his knees knocked together,
but I told him sternly to get to work swinging them wagons, and
clumb onto Cap'n Kidd and lit out.</p>

<p>Reason I hadn't saw the smoke of the Illinois camp was on
account of a thick-timbered ridge which lay east of our camp. I
swung around the south end of that ridge and headed east, and I'd
gone maybe a mile and a half when I seen a man riding toward
me.</p>

<p>When he seen me he come lickety-split, and I could see the sun
shining on his Winchester barrel. I cocked my .45-90 and rode
toward him and we met in the middle of a open flat. And suddenly we
both lowered our weppins and pulled up, breast to breast, glaring
at each other.</p>

<p>"Breckinridge Elkins!" says he.</p>

<p>"Cousin Bearfield Buckner!" says I. "Air you the man which sent
that unlicked cub of a George Warren to bring <i>me</i> a
defiance?"</p>

<p>"Who else?" he snarled. He always had a awful temper.</p>

<p>"Well," I says, "this here is our valley. You all got to move
on."</p>

<p>"What you mean, move on?" he yelled. "I brung them pore critters
all the way from Dodge City, Kansas, where I encountered 'em bein'
tormented by some wuthless buffalo hunters which is no longer in
the land of the livin'. I've led 'em through fire, flood, hostile
Injuns and white renegades. I promised to lead 'em into a land of
milk and honey, and I been firm with 'em, even when they weakened
theirselves. Even when they begged on bended knees to be allowed to
go back to Illinois, I wouldn't hear of it, because, as I told 'em,
I knowed what was best for 'em. I had this canyon in mind all the
time. And now you tells me to move on!"</p>

<p>Cousin Bearfield rolled an eye and spit on his hand. I jest
waited.</p>

<p>"What sort of a reply does you make to my request to go on and
leave us in peace?" he goes on. "George Warren come back to camp
wearin' his hat brim around his neck and standin' up in the
stirrups because he was too sore to set in the saddle. So I set 'em
fortifyin' the camp whilst I went forth to reconnoiter. That word I
sent you, I now repeats in person. Yo're my blood-kin, but
principles comes first!"</p>

<p>"Me, too," I said. "A Nevada Elkins' principles is as loftey as
a Texas Buckner's any day. I whupped you a year ago in Cougar
Paw&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's a cussed lie!" gnashed he. "You taken a base advantage
and lammed me with a oak log when I warn't expectin' it!"</p>

<p>"Be that as it may," says I, "&mdash;ignorin' the fack that you
had jest beaned me with a rock the size of a water-bucket&mdash;the
only way to settle this dispute is to fight it out like gents. But
we got to determine what weppins to use. The matter's too deep for
fists."</p>

<p>"I'd prefer butcher knives in a dark room," says he, "only they
ain't no room. If we jest had a couple of sawed-off shotguns, or
good double-bitted axes&mdash;I tell you, Breck, le's tie our left
hands together and work on each other with our bowies."</p>

<p>"Naw," I says, "I got a better idee. We'll back our hosses
together, and then ride for the oppersite sides of the flat. When
we git there we'll wheel and charge back, shootin' at each other
with our Winchesters. Time they're empty we'll be clost enough to
use our pistols, and when we've emptied them we'll be clost enough
to finish the fight with our bowies."</p>

<p>"Good idee!" agreed Bearfield. "You always was a brainy,
cultured sort of a lobo, if you wasn't so damn stubborn. Now, me,
I'm reasonable. When I'm wrong, I admit it."</p>

<p>"You ain't never admitted it so far," says I.</p>

<p>"I ain't never been wrong yet!" he roared. "And I'll kyarve the
gizzard of the buzzard which says I am! Come on! Le's git
goin'."</p>

<p>So we started to gallop to the oppersite sides of the flat when
I heard a voice hollering: "Mister Elkins! Mister Elkins!"</p>

<p>"Hold on!" I says. "That's Joe Richardson."</p>

<p>Next minute Joe come tearing out of the bresh from the south on
a mustang I hadn't never seen before, with a Mexican saddle and
bridle on. He didn't have no hat nor shirt, and his back was
criss-crossed with bloody streaks. He likewise had a cut in his
sculp which dribbled blood down his face.</p>

<p>"Mexicans!" he panted. "I got separated from Ned and rode
further'n I should ought to had. About five miles down the canyon I
run into a big gang of Mexicans&mdash;about thirty of 'em. One was
that feller Gomez. Their leader was a big feller they called
Zamora.</p>

<p>"They grabbed me and taken my hoss, and whupped me with their
quirts. Zamora said they was goin' to wipe out every white man in
the canyon. He said his scouts had brung him news of our camp, and
another'n east of our'n, and he aimed to destroy both of 'em at one
sweep. Then they all got onto their hosses and headed north, except
one man which I believe they left there to kill me before he
follered 'em. He hit me with his six-shooter and knocked me down,
and then put up his gun and started to cut my throat with his
knife. But I wasn't unconscious like he thought, and I grabbed his
gun and knocked <i>him</i> down with it, and jumped on his hoss and
lit out. As I made for camp I heard you and this gent talkin' loud
to each other, and headed this way."</p>

<p>"Which camp was they goin' for first?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"I dunno," he said. "They talked mostly in Spanish I can't
understand."</p>

<p>"The duel'll have to wait," I says. "I'm headin' for our
camp."</p>

<p>"And me for mine," says Bearfield. "Lissen: le's decide it this
way: one that scuppers the most Greasers wins and t'other'n takes
his crowd and pulls out!"</p>

<p><i>"Bueno!"</i> I says, and headed for camp.</p>

<p>The trees was dense. Them bandits could of passed either to the
west or the east of us without us seeing 'em. I quickly left Joe,
and about a quarter of a mile further on I heard a sudden burst of
firing and screaming, and then silence. A little bit later I bust
out of the trees into sight of the camp, and I cussed earnestly.
Instead of being drawed up in a circle, with the men shooting from
between the wheels and holding them bandits off like I expected,
them derned wagons was strung out like they was heading back north.
The hosses was cut loose from some of 'em, and mules was laying
acrost the poles of the others, shot full of lead. Women was
screaming and kids was squalling, and I seen young Jack Richardson
laying face down in the ashes of the campfire with his head in a
puddle of blood.</p>

<p>Old Man Richardson come limping toward me with tears running
down his face. "Mexicans!" he blubbered. "They hit us like a
harrycane jest a little while ago! They shot Jack down like he was
a dog! Three or four of the other boys is got knife slashes or
bullet marks or bruises from loaded quirt-ends! As they rode off
they yelled they'd come back and kill us all!"</p>

<p>"Why'n't you throw them wagons round like I told you?" I
roared.</p>

<p>"We didn't want no fightin'!" he bawled. "We decided to pull out
of the valley and find some more peaceful place&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And now Jack's dead and yore stock's scattered!" I raged. "Jest
because you didn't want to fight! What the hell you ever cross the
Pecos for if you didn't aim to fight nobody? Set the boys to
gatherin' sech stock as you got left&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But them Mexicans taken Betty!" he shrieked, tearing his scanty
locks. "Most of 'em headed east, but six or seven grabbed Betty
right out of the wagon and rode off south with her, drivin' the
hosses they stole from us!"</p>

<p>"Well, git yore weppins and foller me!" I roared. "For Lord's
sake forgit they is places where sheriffs and policemen pertecks
you, and make up yore minds to <i>fight!</i> I'm goin' after
Betty."</p>

<p>I headed south as hard as Cap'n Kidd could run. The reason I
hadn't met them Mexicans as I rode back from the flat where I met
Cousin Bearfield was because they swung around the north end of the
ridge when they headed east. I hadn't gone far when I heard a
sudden burst of firing, off to the east, and figgered they'd hit
the Illinois camp. But I reckoned Bearfield had got there ahead of
'em. Still, it didn't seem like the shooting was far enough off to
be at the other camp. But I didn't have no time to study it.</p>

<p>Them gal-thieves had a big start, but it didn't do no good. I
hadn't rode over three miles till I heard the stolen hosses running
ahead of me, and in a minute I bust out into a open flat and seen
six Mexicans driving them critters at full speed, and one of 'em
was holding Betty on the saddle in front of him. It was that
blasted Gomez.</p>

<p>I come swooping down onto 'em, with a six-shooter in my right
hand and a bowie knife in my left. Cap'n Kidd needed no guiding.
He'd smelt blood and fire and he come like a hurricane on Jedgment
Day, with his mane flying and his hoofs burning the grass.</p>

<p>The Mexicans seen I'd ride 'em down before they could get acrost
the flat and they turnt to meet me, shooting as they come. But
Mexicans always was rotten shots. As we come together I let
<i>bam</i> three times with my .45, and: "Three!" says I.</p>

<p>One of 'em rode at me from the side and clubbed his rifle and
hit at my head, but I ducked and made one swipe with my bowie.
"Four!" says I. Then the others turnt and high-tailed it, letting
the stolen hosses run where they wanted to. One of 'em headed
south, but I was crowding Gomez so clost he whirled around and lit
a shuck west.</p>

<p>"Keep back or I keel the girl!" he howled, lifting a knife, but
I shot it out of his hand, and he give a yowl and let go of her and
she fell off into the high grass. He kept fogging it.</p>

<p>I pulled up to see if Betty was hurt, but she warn't&mdash;jest
scairt. The grass cushioned her fall. I seen her pap and sech of
the boys as was able to ride was all coming at a high run, so I
left her to 'em and taken in after Gomez again. Purty soon he
looked back and seen me overhauling him, so he reched for his
Winchester which he'd evidently jest thought of using, when about
that time his hoss stepped into a prairie dog hole and throwed him
over his head. Gomez never twitched after he hit the ground. I
turnt around and rode back, cussing disgustedly, because a Elkins
is ever truthful, and I couldn't honestly count Gomez in my
record.</p>

<p>But I thought I'd scuttle that coyote that run south, so I
headed in that direction. I hadn't gone far when I heard a lot of
hosses running somewhere ahead of me and to the east, and then
presently I bust out of the trees and come onto a flat which run to
the mouth of a narrer gorge opening into the main canyon.</p>

<p>On the left wall of this gorge-mouth they was a ledge about
fifty foot up, and they was a log cabin on that ledge with
loop-holes in the walls. The only way up onto the ledge was a log
ladder, and about twenty Mexicans was running their hosses toward
it, acrost the flat. Jest as I reched the aidge of the bushes, they
got to the foot of the wall and jumped off their hosses and run up
that ladder like monkeys, letting their hosses run any ways. I seen
a big feller with gold ornaments on his sombrero which I figgered
was Zamora, but before I could unlimber my Winchester they was all
in the cabin and slammed the door.</p>

<p>The next minute cousin Bearfield busted out of the trees a few
hundred yards east of where I was and started recklessly acrost the
flat. Imejitely all them Mexicans started shooting at him, and he
grudgingly retired into the bresh again, with terrible language. I
yelled, and rode toward him, keeping to the trees.</p>

<p>"How many you got?" he bellered as soon as he seen me.</p>

<p>"Four," I says, and he grinned like a timber wolf and says: "I
got five! I was ridin' for my camp when I heard the shootin' behind
me, and so I knowed it was yore camp they hit first. I turnt around
to go back and help you out&mdash;"</p>

<p>"When did I ever ast you for any help?" I bristled, but he said:
"But purty soon I seen a gang of Mexicans comin' around the north
end of the ridge, so I taken cover and shot five of 'em out of
their saddles. They must of knowed it was me, because they
high-tailed it."</p>

<p>"How could they know that, you conceited jackass?" I snorted.
"They run off because they probably thought a whole gang had
ambushed 'em."</p>

<p>Old Man Richardson and his boys had rode up whilst we was
talking, and now he broke in with some heat, and said: "That hain't
the question! The p'int is we got 'em hemmed up on that ledge for
the time bein', and can git away before they come down and massacre
us."</p>

<p>"What you talkin' about?" I roared. <i>"They're</i> the ones
which is in need of gittin' away. If any massacrein' is did around
here, we does it!"</p>

<p>"It's flyin' in the face of Providence!" he bleated, but I told
him sternly to shet up, and Bearfield says: "Send somebody over to
my camp to bring my warriors," so I told Ned to go and he pulled
out.</p>

<p>Then me and Bearfield studied the situation, setting our hosses
in the open whilst bullets from the cabin whistled all around us,
and the Richardsons hid in the bresh and begged us to be
keerful.</p>

<p>"That ledge is sheer on all sides," says Bearfield. "Nobody
couldn't climb down onto it from the cliff. And anybody tryin' to
climb that ladder in the teeth of twenty Winchesters would be plum
crazy."</p>

<p>But I says, "Look, Bearfield, how the ledge overhangs about ten
foot to the left of that ladder. A man could stand at the foot of
the bluff there and them coyotes couldn't see to shoot him."</p>

<p>"And," says Bearfield, "he could sling his rope up over that
spur of rock at the rim, and they couldn't shoot it off. Only way
to git to it would be to come out of the cabin and rech down and
cut it with a knife. Door opens toward the ladder, and they ain't
no door in the wall on that side. A man could climb right up onto
the ledge before they knowed it&mdash;if they didn't shoot him
through the loop-holes as he come over the rim."</p>

<p>"You stay here and shoot 'em when they tries to cut the rope," I
says.</p>

<p>"You go to hell!" he roared. "I see through yore hellish plot.
You aims to git up there and kill all them Mexes before I has a
chance at 'em. You thinks you'll outwit me! By golly, I got my
rights, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aw, shet up," I says disgustedly. "We'll both go." I hollered
to Old Man Richardson: "You all lay low in the bresh and shoot at
every Mex which comes outa the cabin."</p>

<p>"What you goin' to do now?" he hollered. "Don't be
rash&mdash;"</p>

<p>But me and Bearfield was already headed for the ledge at a dead
run.</p>

<p>This move surprized the Mexicans, because they knowed we
couldn't figger to ride our hosses up that ladder. Being surprized
they shot wild and all they done was graze my sculp and nick
Bearfield's ear. Then, jest as they begun to get their range and
started trimming us clost, we swerved aside and thundered in under
the overhanging rock.</p>

<p>We clumb off and tied our hosses well apart, otherwise they'd of
started fighting each other. The Mexicans above us was yelling most
amazing but they couldn't even see us, much less shoot us. I
whirled my lariat, which is plenty longer and stronger than the
average lasso, and roped the spur of rock which jutted up jest
below the rim.</p>

<p>"I'll go up first," says I, and Bearfield showed his teeth and
drawed his bowie knife.</p>

<p>"You won't neither!" says he. "We'll cut kyards! High man
wins!"</p>

<p>So we squatted, and Old Man Richardson yelled from the trees:
"For God's sake, what are you doin' now? They're fixin' to roll
rocks down onto you!"</p>

<p>"You tend to yore own business," I advised him, and shuffled the
cards which Bearfield hauled out of his britches. As it turnt out,
the Mexes had a supply of boulders in the cabin. They jest opened
the door and rolled 'em toward the rim. But they shot off the ledge
and hit beyond us.</p>

<p>Bearfield cut, and yelped: "A ace! You cain't beat that!"</p>

<p>"I can equal it," I says, and drawed a ace of diamonds.</p>

<p>"I wins!" he clamored. "Hearts beats diamonds!"</p>

<p>"That rule don't apply here," I says. "It war a draw,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, you&mdash;!" says Bearfield, leaning for'ard to grab the
deck, and jest then a rock about the size of a bushel basket come
bounding over the ledge and hit a projection which turnt its
course, so instead of shooting over us, it fell straight down and
hit Bearfield smack between the ears.</p>

<p>It stunned him for a instant, and I jumped up and started
climbing the rope, ignoring more rocks which come thundering down.
I was about half-way up when Bearfield come to, and he riz with a
beller of rage. "Why, you dirty, double-crossin' so-and-so!" says
he, and started throwing rocks at me.</p>

<p>They was a awful racket, the Mexicans howling, and guns banging,
and Bearfield cussing, and Old Man Richardson wailing: "They're
crazy, I tell you! They're both crazy as mudhens! I think everybody
west of the Pecos must be maneyacks!"</p>

<p>Bearfield grabbed the rope and started climbing up behind me,
and about that time one of the Mexicans run to cut the rope. But
for onst my idiotic follerers was on the job. He run into about
seven bullets that hit him all to onst, and fell down jest above
the spur where the loop was caught onto.</p>

<p>So when I reched my arm over the rim to pull myself up they
couldn't see me on account of the body. But jest as I was pulling
myself up, they let go a boulder at random and it bounded along and
bounced over the dead Mexican and hit me right smack in the face.
It was about as big as a pumpkin.</p>

<p>I give a infuriated beller and swarmed up onto the ledge and it
surprized 'em so that most of them missed me clean. I only got one
slug through the arm. Before they had time to shoot again I made a
jump to the wall and flattened myself between the loop-holes, and
grabbed the rifle barrels they poked through the loop-holes and
bent 'em and rooint 'em. Bearfield was coming up the rope right
behind me, so I grabbed hold of the logs and tore that whole side
of the wall out, and the roof fell in and the other walls come
apart.</p>

<p>In a instant all you could see was logs falling and rolling and
Mexicans busting out into the open. Some got pinned by the falling
logs and some was shot by my embattled Kansans and Bearfield's
Illinois warriors which had jest come up, and some fell offa the
ledge and broke their fool necks.</p>

<p>One of 'em run agen me and tried to stab me so I throwed him
after them which had already fell off the ledge, and hollered:
"Five for me, Bearfield!"</p>

<p>"&mdash;&mdash;!" says Bearfield, arriving onto the scene with
blood in his eye and his bowie in his hand. Seeing which a big
Mexican made for him with a butcher knife, which was pore jedgment
on his part, and in about the flick of a mustang's tail Bearfield
had a sixth man to his credit.</p>

<p>This made me mad. I seen some of the Mexicans was climbing down
the ladder, so I run after 'em, and one turnt around and missed me
so close with a shotgun he burnt my eyebrows. I taken it away from
him and hit him over the head with it, and yelled: "Six for me,
too, Cousin Bearfield!"</p>

<p>"Lookout!" he yelled. "Zamora's gittin' away!"</p>

<p>I seen Zamora had tied a rope to the back side of the ledge and
was sliding down it. He dropped the last ten feet and run for a
corral which was full of hosses back up the gorge, behind the
ledge.</p>

<p>We seen the other Mexicans was all laid out or running off up
the valley, persued by our immigrants, so I went down the ladder
and Bearfield slid down my rope. Zamora's rope wouldn't of held our
weight. We grabbed our hosses and lit out up the gorge, around a
bend of which Zamora was jest disappearing.</p>

<p>He had a fast hoss and a long start, but I'd of overtook him
within the first mile, only Cap'n Kidd kept trying to stop and
fight Bearfield's hoss, which was about as big and mean as he was.
After we'd run about five miles, and come out of the gorge onto a
high plateau, I got far enough ahead of Bearfield so Cap'n Kidd
forgot about his hoss, and then he settled down to business and run
Zamora's hoss right off his laigs.</p>

<p>They was a steep slope on one side of us, and a five hundred
foot drop on the other, and Zamora seen his hoss was winded, so he
jumped off and started up the slope on foot. Me and Bearfield
jumped off, too, and run after him. Each one of us got him by a
laig as he was climbing up a ledge.</p>

<p>"Leggo my prisoner!" roared Bearfield.</p>

<p>"He's my meat," I snarled. "This makes me seven! I wins!"</p>

<p>"You lie!" bellered Bearfield, jerking Zamora away from me and
hitting me over the head with him. This made me mad so I grabbed
Zamora and throwed him in Bearfield's face. His spurs jabbed
Bearfield in the belly, and my cousin give a maddened beller and
fell on me fist and tush, and in the battle which follered we
forgot all about Zamora till we heard a man scream. He'd snuck away
and tried to mount Cap'n Kidd. We stopped fighting and looked
around jest in time to see Cap'n Kidd kick him in the belly and
knock him clean over the aidge of the cliff.</p>

<p>"Well," says Bearfield disgustedly, "that decides nothin', and
our score is a draw."</p>

<p>"It was my hoss which done it," I said. "It ought a count for
me."</p>

<p>"Over my corpse it will!" roared Bearfield. "But look here, it's
nearly night. Le's git back to the camps before my follerers start
cuttin' yore Kansans' throats. Whatever fight is to be fought to
decide who owns the canyon, it's betwixt you and me, not them."</p>

<p>"All right," I said. "If my Kansas boys ain't already kilt all
yore idjits, we'll fight this out somewhere where we got better
light and more room. But I jest expect to find yore Illinoisans
writhin' in their gore."</p>

<p>"Don't worry about them," he snarled. "They're wild as painters
when they smells gore. I only hope they ain't kilt <i>all</i> yore
Kansas mavericks."</p>

<p>So we pulled for the valley. When we got there it was dark, and
as we rode outa the gorge, we seen fires going on the flat, and
folks dancing around 'em, and fiddles was going at a great
rate.</p>

<p>"What the hell is this?" bellered Bearfield, and then Old Man
Richardson come up to us, overflowing with good spirits. "Glad to
see you gents!" he says. "This is a great night! Jack warn't kilt,
after all. Jest creased. We come out of that great fight whole and
sound&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what you doin'?" roared Bearfield. "What's my people doin'
here?"</p>

<p>"Oh," says Old Man Richardson, "we got together after you gents
left and agreed that the valley was big enough for both parties, so
we decided to jine together into one settlement, and we're
celebratin'. Them Illinois people is fine folks. They're as
peace-lovin' as we are."</p>

<p>"Blood-thirsty painters!" I sneers to Cousin Bearfield.</p>

<p>"I ain't no bigger liar'n you air," he says, more in sorrer than
in anger. "Come on. They ain't nothin' more we can do. We air
swamped in a mess of pacifism. The race is degeneratin'. Le's head
for Bear Creek. This atmosphere of brotherly love is more'n I can
stand."</p>

<p>We set our hosses there a minnit and watched them pilgrims dance
and listened to 'em singing. I squints across at Cousin Bearfield's
face and doggoned if it don't look almost human in the firelight.
He hauls out his plug of tobaccer and offers me first chaw. Then we
headed yonderly, riding stirrup to stirrup.</p>

<p>Must of been ten miles before Cap'n Kidd retches over and bites
Cousin Bearfield's hoss on the neck. Bearfield's hoss bites back,
and by accident Cap'n Kidd kicks Cousin Bearfield on the ankle. He
lets out a howl and thumps me over the head, and I hit him, and
then we gits our arms around each other and roll in the bresh in a
tangle.</p>

<p>We fit fer two hours, I reckon, and we'd been fighting yet if we
hadn't scrambled under Cap'n Kidd's hoofs where he was feeding. He
kicked Cousin Bearfield one way and me the other.</p>

<p>I got up after a while and went hunting my hat. The bresh
crackled, and in the moonlight I could see Cousin Bearfield on his
hands and knees. "Whar air ye, Cousin Breckinridge?" says he. "Air
you all right?"</p>

<p>Well, mebbe my clothes was tore more'n his was and a lip split
and a rib or two busted, but I could still see, which was more'n he
could say with both his eyes swole that way. "Shore I'm all right,"
I says. "How air <i>you,</i> Cousin Bearfield?"</p>

<p>He let out a groan and tried to git up. He made 'er on the
second heave and stood there swaying. "Why, I'm fine," he says.
"Plumb fine. I feel a whole lot better, Breck. I was afraid fer a
minnit back there, whilst we was ridin' along, that that daggone
brotherly love would turn out to be catchin'."</p>
