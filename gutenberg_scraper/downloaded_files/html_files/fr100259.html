  <h3>ILLUSTRATED WITH PHOTOGRAVURES FROM<br>
  THE ORIGINAL ENGRAVINGS BY JOHN FRANKLIN</h3>

  <h3>Serialised in <i>The Sunday Times</i>, 3 Jan 1841-26 Dec 1841<br>
  First book edition published by Hugh Cunningham, London, 1841</h3>

  <br>

  <p class="intro">The portion of the ensuing Tale relating to the Grocer of
  Wood-street, and his manner of victualling his house, and shutting up himself
  and his family within it during the worst part of the Plague of 1665, is
  founded on a narrative, which I have followed pretty closely in most of its
  details, contained in a very rare little volume, entitled, "<i>Preparations
  against the Plague, both of Soul and Body</i>," the authorship of which I
  have no hesitation in assigning to <span class="smcap">Defoe</span>. Indeed,
  I venture to pronounce it his masterpiece. It is strange that this matchless
  performance should have hitherto escaped attention, and that it should not
  have been reprinted with some one of the countless impressions of the
  "<i>History of the Plague of London</i>," to which it forms an almost
  necessary accompaniment. The omission, I trust, will be repaired by
  <span class="smcap">Mr. Hazlitt</span> the younger, <span class=
  "smcap">Defoe's</span> last and best editor, in his valuable edition of the
  works of that great novelist and political writer, now in the course of
  publication. It may be added, that a case precisely similar to that of the
  Grocer, and attended with the same happy results, occurred during the Plague
  of Marseilles, in 1720.</p>

  <p class="intro">For my acquaintance with this narrative, as well as for the
  suggestion of its application to the present purpose, I am indebted to my
  friend, <span class="smcap">Mr. James Crossley</span>, of Manchester.</p>

     name="bk1">BOOK THE FIRST &mdash; APRIL, 1665</a></h2>

  <h2>I. &mdash; THE GROCER OF WOOD-STREET AND HIS FAMILY</h2>

  <p>One night, at the latter end of April, 1665, the family of a citizen of
  London carrying on an extensive business as a grocer in Wood-street,
  Cheapside, were assembled, according to custom, at prayer. The grocer's name
  was Stephen Bloundel. His family consisted of his wife, three sons, and two
  daughters. He had, moreover, an apprentice; an elderly female serving as
  cook; her son, a young man about five-and-twenty, filling the place of porter
  to the shop and general assistant; and a kitchen-maid. The whole household
  attended; for the worthy grocer, being a strict observer of his religious
  duties, as well as a rigid disciplinarian in other respects, suffered no one
  to be absent, on any plea whatever, except indisposition, from morning and
  evening devotions; and these were always performed at stated times. In fact,
  the establishment was conducted with the regularity of clockwork, it being
  the aim of its master not to pass a single hour of the day unprofitably.</p>

    <p class="caption">The Grocer and His Family at Prayers</p>
  </div>

  <p>The ordinary prayers gone through, Stephen Bloundel offered up along and
  fervent supplication to the Most High for protection against the devouring
  pestilence with which the city was then scourged. He acknowledged that this
  terrible visitation had been justly brought upon it by the wickedness of its
  inhabitants; that they deserved their doom, dreadful though it was; that,
  like the dwellers in Jerusalem before it was given up to ruin and desolation,
  they "had mocked the messengers of God and despised His word;" that in the
  language of the prophet, "they had refused to hearken, and pulled away the
  shoulder, and stopped their ears that they should not hear; yea, had made
  their heart like an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law and the
  words which the Lord of Hosts had sent in his spirit by the former prophets."
  He admitted that great sins require great chastisement, and that the sins of
  London were enormous; that it was filled with strifes, seditions, heresies,
  murders, drunkenness, revellings, and every kind of abomination; that the
  ordinances of God were neglected, and all manner of vice openly practised;
  that, despite repeated warnings and afflictions less grievous than the
  present, these vicious practices had been persisted in. All this he humbly
  acknowledged. But he implored a gracious Providence, in consideration of his
  few faithful servants, to spare the others yet a little longer, and give them
  a last chance of repentance and amendment; or, if this could not be, and
  their utter extirpation was inevitable, that the habitations of the devout
  might be exempted from the general destruction&mdash;might be places of
  refuge, as Zoar was to Lot. He concluded by earnestly exhorting those around
  him to keep constant watch upon themselves; not to murmur at God's dealings
  and dispensations; but so to comport themselves, that "they might be able to
  stand in the day of wrath, in the day of death, and in the day of judgment."
  The exhortation produced a powerful effect upon its hearers, and they arose,
  some with serious, others with terrified looks.</p>

  <p>Before proceeding further, it may be desirable to show in what manner the
  dreadful pestilence referred to by the grocer commenced, and how far its
  ravages had already extended. Two years before, namely, in 1663, more than a
  third of the population of Amsterdam was carried off by a desolating plague.
  Hamburgh was also grievously afflicted about the same time, and in the same
  manner. Notwithstanding every effort to cut off communication with these
  states, the insidious disease found its way into England by means of some
  bales of merchandise, as it was suspected, at the latter end of the year
  1664, when two persons died suddenly, with undoubted symptoms of the
  distemper, in Westminster. Its next appearance was at a house in Long Acre,
  and its victims two Frenchmen, who had brought goods from the Levant.
  Smothered for a short time, like a fire upon which coals had been heaped, it
  broke out with fresh fury in several places.</p>

  <p>The consternation now began. The whole city was panic-stricken: nothing
  was talked of but the plague&mdash;nothing planned but means of arresting its
  progress&mdash;one grim and ghastly idea possessed the minds of all. Like a
  hideous phantom stalking the streets at noon-day, and scaring all in its
  path, Death took his course through London, and selected his prey at
  pleasure. The alarm was further increased by the predictions confidently made
  as to the vast numbers who would be swept away by the visitation; by the
  prognostications of astrologers; by the prophesyings of enthusiasts; by the
  denunciations of preachers, and by the portents and prodigies reported to
  have occurred. During the long and frosty winter preceding this fatal year, a
  comet appeared in the heavens, the sickly colour of which was supposed to
  forebode the judgment about to follow. Blazing stars and other meteors, of a
  lurid hue and strange and preternatural shape, were likewise seen. The sun
  was said to have set in streams of blood, and the moon to have shown without
  reflecting a shadow; grisly shapes appeared at night&mdash;strange clamours
  and groans were heard in the air&mdash;hearses, coffins, and heaps of
  unburied dead were discovered in the sky, and great cakes and clots of blood
  were found in the Tower moat; while a marvellous double tide occurred at
  London Bridge. All these prodigies were currently reported, and in most cases
  believed.</p>

  <p>The severe frost, before noticed, did not break up till the end of
  February, and with the thaw the plague frightfully increased in violence.
  From Drury-lane it spread along Holborn, eastward as far as Great Turnstile,
  and westward to Saint Giles's Pound, and so along the Tyburn-road. Saint
  Andrew's, Holborn, was next infected; and as this was a much more populous
  parish than the former, the deaths were more numerous within it. For a while,
  the disease was checked by Fleet Ditch; it then leaped this narrow boundary,
  and ascending the opposite hill, carried fearful devastation into Saint
  James's, Clerkenwell. At the same time, it attacked Saint Bride's; thinned
  the ranks of the thievish horde haunting Whitefriars, and proceeding in a
  westerly course, decimated Saint Clement Danes.</p>

  <p>Hitherto, the city had escaped. The destroyer had not passed Ludgate or
  Newgate, but environed the walls like a besieging enemy. A few days, however,
  before the opening of this history, fine weather having commenced, the
  horrible disease began to grow more rife, and laughing all precautions and
  impediments to scorn, broke out in the very heart of the
  stronghold&mdash;namely, in Bearbinder-lane, near Stock's Market, where nine
  persons died.</p>

  <p>At a season so awful, it may be imagined how an impressive address, like
  that delivered by the grocer, would be received by those who saw in the
  pestilence, not merely an overwhelming scourge from which few could escape,
  but a direct manifestation of the Divine displeasure. Not a word was said.
  Blaize Shotterel, the porter, and old Josyna, his mother, together with
  Patience, the other woman-servant, betook themselves silently, and with
  troubled countenances, to the kitchen. Leonard Holt, the apprentice, lingered
  for a moment to catch a glance from the soft blue eyes of Amabel, the
  grocer's eldest daughter (for even the plague was a secondary consideration
  with him when she was present), and failing in the attempt, he heaved a deep
  sigh, which was luckily laid to the account of the discourse he had just
  listened to by his sharp-sighted master, and proceeded to the shop, where he
  busied himself in arranging matters for the night.</p>

  <p>Having just completed his twenty-first year, and his apprenticeship being
  within a few months of its expiration, Leonard Holt began to think of
  returning to his native town of Manchester, where he intended to settle, and
  where he had once fondly hoped the fair Amabel would accompany him, in the
  character of his bride. Not that he had ever ventured to declare his passion,
  nor that he had received sufficient encouragement to make it matter of
  certainty that if he did so declare himself, he should be accepted; but being
  both "proper and tall," and having tolerable confidence in his good looks, he
  had made himself, up to a short time prior to his introduction to the reader,
  quite easy on the point.</p>

  <p>His present misgivings were occasioned by Amabel's altered manner towards
  him, and by a rival who, he had reason to fear, had completely superseded him
  in her good graces. Brought up together from an early age, the grocer's
  daughter and the young apprentice had at first regarded each other as brother
  and sister. By degrees, the feeling changed; Amabel became more reserved, and
  held little intercourse with Leonard, who, busied with his own concerns,
  thought little about her. But, as he grew towards manhood, he could not
  remain insensible to her extraordinary beauty&mdash;for extraordinary it was,
  and such as to attract admiration wherever she went, so that the "Grocer's
  Daughter" became the toast among the ruffling gallants of the town, many of
  whom sought to obtain speech with her. Her parents, however, were far too
  careful to permit any such approach. Amabel's stature was lofty; her limbs
  slight, but exquisitely symmetrical; her features small, and cast in the most
  delicate mould; her eyes of the softest blue; and her hair luxuriant, and of
  the finest texture and richest brown. Her other beauties must be left to the
  imagination; but it ought not to be omitted that she was barely eighteen, and
  had all the freshness, the innocence, and vivacity of that most charming
  period of woman's existence. No wonder she ravished every heart. No wonder,
  in an age when love-making was more general even than now, that she was beset
  by admirers. No wonder her father's apprentice became desperately enamoured
  of her, and proportionately jealous.</p>

  <p>And this brings us to his rival. On the 10th of April, two gallants, both
  richly attired, and both young and handsome, dismounted before the grocer's
  door, and, leaving their steeds to the care of their attendants, entered the
  shop. They made sundry purchases of conserves, figs, and other dried fruit,
  chatted familiarly with the grocer, and tarried so long, that at last he
  began to suspect they must have some motive. All at once, however, they
  disagreed on some slight matter&mdash;Bloundel could not tell what, nor,
  perhaps, could the disputants, even if their quarrel was not
  preconcerted&mdash;high words arose, and in another moment, swords were
  drawn, and furious passes exchanged. The grocer called to his eldest son, a
  stout youth of nineteen, and to Leonard Holt, to separate them. The
  apprentice seized his cudgel&mdash;no apprentice in those days was without
  one&mdash;and rushed towards the combatants, but before he could interfere,
  the fray was ended. One of them had received a thrust through the sword arm,
  and his blade dropping, his antagonist declared himself satisfied, and with a
  grave salute walked off. The wounded man wrapped a lace handkerchief round
  his arm, but immediately afterwards complained of great faintness. Pitying
  his condition, and suspecting no harm, the grocer led him into an inner room,
  where restoratives were offered by Mrs. Bloundel and her daughter Amabel,
  both of whom had been alarmed by the noise of the conflict. In a short time,
  the wounded man was so far recovered as to be able to converse with his
  assistants, especially the younger one; and the grocer having returned to the
  shop, his discourse became so very animated and tender, that Mrs. Bloundel
  deemed it prudent to give her daughter a hint to retire. Amabel reluctantly
  obeyed, for the young stranger was so handsome, so richly dressed, had such a
  captivating manner, and so distinguished an air, that she was strongly
  prepossessed in his favour. A second look from her mother, however, caused
  her to disappear, nor did she return. After waiting with suppressed anxiety
  for some time, the young gallant departed, overwhelming the good dame with
  his thanks, and entreating permission to call again. This was peremptorily
  refused, but, notwithstanding the interdiction, he came on the following day.
  The grocer chanced to be out at the time, and the gallant, who had probably
  watched him go forth, deriding the remonstrances of the younger Bloundel and
  Leonard, marched straight to the inner room, where he found the dame and her
  daughter. They were much disconcerted at his appearance, and the latter
  instantly rose with the intention of retiring, but the gallant caught her arm
  and detained her.</p>

  <p>"Do not fly me, Amabel," he cried, in an impassioned tone, "but suffer me
  to declare the love I have for you. I cannot live without you."</p>

  <p>Amabel, whose neck and cheeks were crimsoned with blushes, cast down her
  eyes before the ardent regards of the gallant, and endeavoured to withdraw
  her hand.</p>

  <p>"One word only," he continued, "and I release you. Am I wholly indifferent
  to you! Answer me&mdash;yes or no!"</p>

  <p>"Do <i>not</i> answer him, Amabel," interposed her mother. "He is
  deceiving you. He loves you not. He would ruin you. This is the way with all
  these court butterflies. Tell him you hate him, child, and bid him
  begone."</p>

  <p>"But I cannot tell him an untruth, mother," returned Amabel, artlessly,
  "for I do <i>not</i> hate him."</p>

  <p>"Then you love me," cried the young man, falling on his knees, and
  pressing her hand to his lips. "Tell me so, and make me the happiest of
  men."</p>

  <p>But Amabel had now recovered from the confusion into which she had been
  thrown, and, alarmed at her own indiscretion, forcibly withdrew her hand,
  exclaiming in a cold tone, and with much natural dignity, "Arise, sir. I will
  not tolerate these freedoms. My mother is right&mdash;you have some ill
  design."</p>

  <p>"By my soul, no!" cried the gallant, passionately. "I love you, and would
  make you mine."</p>

  <p>"No doubt," remarked Mrs. Bloundel, contemptuously, "but not by
  marriage."</p>

  <p>"Yes, by marriage," rejoined the gallant, rising. "If she will consent, I
  will wed her forthwith."</p>

  <p>Both Amabel and her mother looked surprised at the young man's
  declaration, which was uttered with a fervour that seemed to leave no doubt
  of its sincerity; but the latter, fearing some artifice, replied, "If what
  you say is true, and you really love my daughter as much as you pretend, this
  is not the way to win her; for though she can have no pretension to wed with
  one of your seeming degree, nor is it for her happiness that she should, yet,
  were she sought by the proudest noble in the land, she shall never, if I can
  help it, be lightly won. If your intentions are honourable, you must address
  yourself, in the first place, to her father, and if he agrees (which I much
  doubt) that you shall become her suitor, I can make no objection. Till this
  is settled, I must pray you to desist from further importunity."</p>

  <p>"And so must I," added Amabel. "I cannot give you a hope till you have
  spoken to my father."</p>

  <p>"Be it so," replied the gallant. "I will tarry here till his return."</p>

  <p>So saying, he was about to seat himself, but Mrs. Bloundel prevented
  him.</p>

  <p>"I cannot permit this, sir," she cried. "Your tarrying here may, for aught
  I know, bring scandal upon my house;&mdash;I am sure it will be disagreeable
  to my husband. I am unacquainted with your name and condition. You may be a
  man of rank. You may be one of the profligate and profane crew who haunt the
  court. You may be the worst of them all, my Lord Rochester himself. He is
  about your age, I have heard, and though a mere boy in years, is a veteran in
  libertinism. But, whoever you are, and whatever your rank and station may be,
  unless your character will bear the strictest scrutiny, I am certain Stephen
  Bloundel will never consent to your union with his daughter."</p>

  <p>"Nay, mother," observed Amabel, "you judge the gentleman unjustly. I am
  sure he is neither a profligate gallant himself, nor a companion of
  such&mdash;especially of the wicked Earl of Rochester."</p>

  <p>"I pretend to be no better than I am," replied the young man, repressing a
  smile that rose to his lips at Mrs. Bloundel's address; "but I shall reform
  when I am married. It would be impossible to be inconstant to so fair a
  creature as Amabel. For my rank, I have none. My condition is that of a
  private gentleman,&mdash;my name, Maurice Wyvil."</p>

  <p>"What you say of yourself, Mr. Maurice Wyvil, convinces me you will meet
  with a decided refusal from my husband," returned Mrs. Bloundel.</p>

  <p>"I trust not," replied Wyvil, glancing tenderly at Amabel. "If I should be
  so fortunate as to gain <i>his</i> consent, have I <i>yours</i>?"</p>

  <p>"It is too soon to ask that question," she rejoined, blushing deeply. "And
  now, sir, you must go, indeed, you must. You distress my mother."</p>

  <p>"If I do not distress <i>you</i>, I will stay," resumed Wyvil, with an
  imploring look.</p>

  <p>"You <i>do</i> distress me," she answered, averting her gaze.</p>

  <p>"Nay, then, I must tear myself away," he rejoined. "I shall return
  shortly, and trust to find your father less flinty-hearted than he is
  represented."</p>

  <p>He would have clasped Amabel in his arms, and perhaps snatched a kiss, if
  her mother had not rushed between them.</p>

  <p>"No more familiarities, sir," she cried angrily; "no court manners here.
  If you look to wed my daughter, you must conduct yourself more decorously;
  but I can tell you, you have no chance&mdash;none whatever."</p>

  <p>"Time will show," replied Wyvil, audaciously. "You had better give her to
  me quietly, and save me the trouble of carrying her off,&mdash;for have her I
  will."</p>

  <p>"Mercy on us!" cried Mrs. Bloundel, in accents of alarm; "now his wicked
  intentions are out."</p>

  <p>"Fear nothing, mother," observed Amabel, coldly. "He will scarcely carry
  me off without my own consent; and I am not likely to sacrifice myself for
  one who holds me in such light esteem."</p>

  <p>"Forgive me, Amabel," rejoined Wyvil, in a voice so penitent that it
  instantly effaced her displeasure; "I meant not to offend. I spoke only the
  language of distraction. Do not dismiss me thus, or my death will lie at your
  door."</p>

  <p>"I should be sorry for that," she replied; "but, inexperienced as I am, I
  feel this is not the language of real regard, but of furious passion."</p>

  <p>A dark shade passed over Wyvil's handsome features, and the almost
  feminine beauty by which they were characterized gave place to a fierce and
  forbidding expression. Controlling himself by a powerful effort, he replied,
  with forced calmness, "Amabel, you know not what it is to love. I will not
  stir hence till I have seen your father."</p>

  <p>"We will see that, sir," exclaimed Mrs. Bloundel, angrily. "What, ho! son
  Stephen! Leonard Holt! I say. This gentleman <i>will</i> stay here, whether I
  like or not. Show him forth."</p>

  <p>"That I will, right willingly," replied the apprentice, rushing before the
  younger Bloundel, and flourishing his formidable cudgel. "Out with you, sir!
  Out with you!"</p>

  <p>"Not at your bidding you, saucy knave," rejoined Wyvil, laying his hand
  upon his sword: "and if it were not for the presence of your mistress and her
  lovely daughter, I would crop your ears for your insolence."</p>

  <p>"Their presence shall not prevent me from making my cudgel and your
  shoulders acquainted, if you do not budge," replied the apprentice,
  sturdily.</p>

  <p>Enraged by the retort, Wyvil would have drawn his sword, but a blow on the
  arm disabled him.</p>

  <p>"Plague on you, fellow!" he exclaimed; "you shall rue this to the last day
  of your existence."</p>

  <p>"Threaten those who heed you," replied Leonard, about to repeat the
  blow.</p>

  <p>"Do him no further injury!" cried Amabel, arresting his hand, and looking
  with the greatest commiseration at Wyvil. "You have dealt with him far too
  rudely already."</p>

  <p>"Since I have your sympathy, sweet Amabel," rejoined Wyvil, "I care not
  what rude treatment I experience from this churl. We shall soon meet again."
  And bowing to her, he strode out of the room.</p>

  <p>Leonard followed him to the shop-door, hoping some further pretext for
  quarrel would arise, but he was disappointed. Wyvil took no notice of him,
  and proceeded at a slow pace towards Cheapside.</p>

  <p>Half an hour afterwards, Stephen Bloundel came home. On being informed of
  what had occurred, he was greatly annoyed, though he concealed his vexation,
  and highly applauded his daughter's conduct. Without further comment, he
  proceeded about his business, and remained in the shop till it was closed.
  Wyvil did not return, and the grocer tried to persuade himself they should
  see nothing more of him. Before Amabel retired to rest, he imprinted a kiss
  on her snowy brow, and said, in a tone of the utmost kindness, "You have
  never yet deceived me, child, and I hope never will. Tell me truly, do you
  take any interest in this young gallant?"</p>

  <p>Amabel blushed deeply.</p>

  <p>"I should not speak the truth, father," she rejoined, after a pause, "if I
  were to say I do not."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry for it," replied Bloundel, gravely. "But you would not be
  happy with him. I am sure he is unprincipled and profligate:&mdash;you must
  forget him."</p>

  <p>"I will try to do so," sighed Amabel. And the conversation dropped.</p>

  <p>On the following day, Maurice Wyvil entered the grocer's shop. He was more
  richly attired than before, and there was a haughtiness in his manner which
  he had not hitherto assumed. What passed between him and Bloundel was not
  known, for the latter never spoke of it; but the result may be gathered from
  the fact that the young gallant was not allowed an interview with the
  grocer's daughter.</p>

  <p>From this moment the change previously noticed took place in Amabel's
  demeanour towards Leonard. She seemed scarcely able to endure his presence,
  and sedulously avoided his regards. From being habitually gay and cheerful,
  she became pensive and reserved. Her mother more than once caught her in
  tears; and it was evident, from many other signs, that Wyvil completely
  engrossed her thoughts. Fully aware of this, Mrs. Bloundel said nothing of it
  to her husband, because the subject was painful to him; and not supposing the
  passion deeply rooted, she hoped it would speedily wear away. But she was
  mistaken&mdash;the flame was kept alive in Amabel's breast in a manner of
  which she was totally ignorant. Wyvil found means to deceive the vigilance of
  the grocer and his wife, but he could not deceive the vigilance of a jealous
  lover. Leonard discovered that his mistress had received a letter. He would
  not betray her, but he determined to watch her narrowly.</p>

  <p>Accordingly, when she went forth one morning in company with her younger
  sister (a little girl of some five years old), he made an excuse to follow
  them, and, keeping within sight, perceived them enter Saint Paul's Cathedral,
  the mid aisle of which was then converted into a public walk, and generally
  thronged with town gallants, bullies, bona-robas, cut-purses, and rogues of
  every description. In short, it was the haunt of the worst of characters of
  the metropolis. When, therefore, Amabel entered this structure, Leonard felt
  certain it was to meet her lover. Rushing forward, he saw her take her course
  through the crowd, and attract general attention from her
  loveliness&mdash;but he nowhere discerned Maurice Wyvil.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, however, she struck off to the right, and halted near one of the
  pillars, and the apprentice, advancing, detected his rival behind it. He was
  whispering a few words in her ear, unperceived by her sister. Maddened by the
  sight, Leonard hurried towards them, but before he could reach the spot Wyvil
  was gone, and Amabel, though greatly confused, looked at the same time so
  indignant, that he almost regretted his precipitation.</p>

  <p>"You will, of course, make known to my father what you have just seen?"
  she said in a low tone.</p>

  <p>"If you will promise not to meet that gallant again without my knowledge,
  I will not," replied Leonard.</p>

  <p>After a moment's reflection, Amabel gave the required promise, and they
  returned to Wood-street together. Satisfied she would not break her word, the
  apprentice became more easy, and as a week elapsed, and nothing was said to
  him on the subject, he persuaded himself she would not attempt to meet her
  lover again.</p>

  <p>Things were in this state at the opening of our tale, but upon the night
  in question, Leonard fancied he discerned some agitation in Amabel's manner
  towards him, and in consequence of this notion, he sought to meet her gaze,
  as before related, after prayers. While trying to distract his thoughts by
  arranging sundry firkins of butter, and putting other things in order, he
  heard a light footstep behind him, and turning at the sound, beheld
  Amabel.</p>

  <p>"Leonard," she whispered, "I promised to tell you when I should next meet
  Maurice Wyvil. He will be here to-night." And without giving him time to
  answer, she retired.</p>

  <p>For awhile, Leonard remained in a state almost of stupefaction, repeating
  to himself, as if unwilling to believe them, the words he had just heard. He
  had not recovered when the grocer entered the shop, and noticing his haggard
  looks, kindly inquired if he felt unwell. The apprentice returned an evasive
  answer, and half determined to relate all he knew to his master, but the next
  moment he changed his intention, and, influenced by that chivalric feeling
  which always governs those, of whatever condition, who love profoundly,
  resolved not to betray the thoughtless girl, but to trust to his own
  ingenuity to thwart the designs of his rival, and preserve her Acting upon
  this resolution, he said he had a slight headache, and instantly resumed his
  occupation.</p>

  <p>At nine o'clock, the whole family assembled at supper. The board was
  plentifully though plainly spread, but the grocer observed, with some
  uneasiness, that his apprentice, who had a good appetite in ordinary, ate
  little or nothing. He kept his eye constantly upon him, and became convinced
  from his manner that something ailed him. Not having any notion of the truth,
  and being filled with apprehensions of the plague, his dread was that Leonard
  was infected by the disease. Supper was generally the pleasantest meal of the
  day at the grocer's house, but on this occasion it passed off cheerlessly
  enough, and a circumstance occurred at its close which threw all into
  confusion and distress. Before relating this, however, we must complete our
  description of the family under their present aspect.</p>

  <p>Tall, and of a spare frame, with good features, somewhat austere in their
  expression, and of the cast which we are apt to term precise and puritanical,
  but tempered with great benevolence, Stephen Bloundel had a keen, deep-seated
  eye, overshadowed by thick brows, and suffered his long-flowing grey hair to
  descend over his shoulders. His forehead was high and ample, his chin square
  and well defined, and his general appearance exceedingly striking. In age he
  was about fifty. His integrity and fairness of dealing, never once called in
  question for a period of thirty years, had won him the esteem of all who knew
  him; while his prudence and economy had enabled him, during that time, to
  amass a tolerable fortune. His methodical habits, and strong religious
  principles, have been already mentioned. His eldest son was named after him,
  and resembled him both in person and character, promising to tread in his
  footsteps. The younger sons require little notice at present. One was twelve,
  and the other only half that age; but both appeared to inherit many of their
  father's good qualities. Basil, the elder, was a stout, well-grown lad, and
  had never known a day's ill-health; while Hubert, the younger, was thin,
  delicate, and constantly ailing.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Bloundel was a specimen of a city dame of the best kind. She had a
  few pardonable vanities, which no arguments could overcome&mdash;such as a
  little ostentation in dress&mdash;a little pride in the neatness of her
  house&mdash;and a good deal in the beauty of her children, especially in that
  of Amabel&mdash;as well as in the wealth and high character of her husband,
  whom she regarded as the most perfect of human beings. These slight failings
  allowed for, nothing but good remained. Her conduct was exemplary in all the
  relations of life. The tenderest of mothers, and the most affectionate of
  wives, she had as much genuine piety and strictness of moral principles as
  her husband. Short, plump, and well-proportioned, though somewhat, perhaps,
  exceeding the rules of symmetry&mdash;she had a rich olive complexion, fine
  black eyes, beaming with good nature, and an ever-laughing mouth, ornamented
  by a beautiful set of teeth. To wind up all, she was a few years younger than
  her husband.</p>

  <p>Amabel has already been described. The youngest girl, Christiana, was a
  pretty little dove-eyed, flaxen-haired child, between four and five years
  old, and shared the fate of most younger children, being very much caressed,
  and not a little spoiled by her parents.</p>

  <p>The foregoing description of the grocer's family would be incomplete
  without some mention of his household. Old Josyna Shotterel, the cook, who
  had lived with her master ever since his marriage, and had the strongest
  attachment for him, was a hale, stout dame, of about sixty, with few
  infirmities for her years, and with less asperity of temper than generally
  belongs to servants of her class. She was a native of Holland, and came to
  England early in life, where she married Blaize's father, who died soon after
  their union. An excellent cook in a plain way&mdash;indeed, she had no
  practice in any other&mdash;she would brew strong ale and mead, or mix a
  sack-posset with, any innkeeper in the city. Moreover, she was a careful and
  tender nurse, if her services were ever required in that capacity. The
  children looked upon her as a second mother; and her affection for them,
  which was unbounded, deserved their regard. She was a perfect storehouse of
  what are termed "old women's receipts;" and there were few complaints (except
  the plague) for which she did not think herself qualified to prescribe and
  able to cure. Her skill in the healing art was often tested by her charitable
  mistress, who required her to prepare remedies, as well as nourishing broths,
  for such of the poor of the parish as applied to her for relief at times of
  sickness.</p>

  <p>Her son, Blaize, was a stout, stumpy fellow, about four feet ten, with a
  head somewhat too large for his body, and extremely long arms. Ever since the
  plague had broken out in Drury-lane, it haunted him like a spectre, and
  scattered the few faculties he possessed. In vain he tried to combat his
  alarm&mdash;in vain his mother endeavoured to laugh him out of it. Nothing
  would do. He read the bills of mortality daily; ascertained the particulars
  of every case; dilated upon the agonies of the sufferers; watched the
  progress of the infection, and calculated the time it would take to reach
  Wood-street. He talked of the pestilence by day, and dreamed of it at night;
  and more than once alarmed the house by roaring for assistance, under the
  idea that he was suddenly attacked. By his mother's advice, he steeped rue,
  wormwood, and sage in his drink, till it was so abominably nauseous that he
  could scarcely swallow it, and carried a small ball in the hollow of his
  hand, compounded of wax, angelica, camphor, and other drugs. He likewise
  chewed a small piece of Virginian snake-root, or zedoary, if he approached
  any place supposed to be infected. A dried toad was suspended round his neck,
  as an amulet of sovereign virtue. Every nostrum sold by the quacks in the
  streets tempted him; and a few days before, he had expended his last crown in
  the purchase of a bottle of plague-water. Being of a superstitious nature, he
  placed full faith in all the predictions of the astrologers, who foretold
  that London should be utterly laid waste, that grass should grow in the
  streets, and that the living should not be able to bury the dead. He quaked
  at the terrible denunciations of the preachers, who exhorted their hearers to
  repentance, telling them a judgment was at hand, and shuddered at the wild
  and fearful prophesying of the insane enthusiasts who roamed the streets. His
  nativity having been cast, and it appearing that he would be in great danger
  on the 20th of June, he made up his mind that he should die of the plague on
  that day. Before he was assailed by these terrors, he had entertained a
  sneaking attachment for Patience, the kitchen-maid, a young and buxom damsel,
  who had no especial objection to him. But of late, his love had given way to
  apprehension, and his whole thoughts were centred in one idea, namely,
  self-preservation.</p>

  <p>By this time supper was over, and the family were about to separate for
  the night, when Stephen, the grocer's eldest son, having risen to quit the
  room, staggered and complained of a strange dizziness and headache, which
  almost deprived him of sight, while his heart palpitated frightfully. A
  dreadful suspicion seized his father. He ran towards him, and assisted him to
  a seat. Scarcely had the young man reached it, when a violent sickness seized
  him; a greenish-coloured froth appeared at the mouth, and he began to grow
  delirious. Guided by the convulsive efforts of the sufferer, Bloundel tore
  off his clothes, and after a moment's search, perceived under the left arm a
  livid pustule. He uttered a cry of anguish. His son was plague-stricken.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch1-2"
     name="ch1-2">II. &mdash; THE COFFIN-MAKER.</a></h2>

  <p>The first shock over, the grocer bore the affliction manfully, and like
  one prepared for it. Exhibiting little outward emotion, though his heart was
  torn with anguish, and acting with the utmost calmness, he forbade his wife
  to approach the sufferer, and desired her instantly to retire to her own room
  with her daughters; and not to leave it on any consideration whatever,
  without his permission.</p>

  <p>Accustomed to regard her husband's word as law, Mrs. Bloundel, for the
  first time in her life, disputed his authority, and, falling on her knees,
  besought him, with tears in her eyes, to allow her to nurse her son. But he
  remained inflexible, and she was forced to comply.</p>

  <p>He next gave similar directions to old Josyna respecting his two younger
  sons, with this difference only, that when they were put to rest, and the
  door was locked upon them, she was to return to the kitchen and prepare a
  posset-drink of canary and spirits of sulphur, together with a poultice of
  mallows, lily-roots, figs, linseed, and palm-oil, for the patient.</p>

  <p>These orders given and obeyed, with Leonard Holt's assistance-for Blaize,
  who had crept into a corner, in extremity of terror, was wholly incapable of
  rendering any help-he conveyed his son to the adjoining room, on the ground
  floor, where there was a bed, and placing him within it, heaped blankets upon
  him to promote profuse perspiration, while the apprentice lighted a fire.</p>

  <p>Provided with the most efficacious remedies for the distemper, and
  acquainted with the mode of treating it prescribed by the College of
  Physicians, Bloundel was at no loss how to act, but, rubbing the part
  affected with a stimulating ointment, he administered at the same time doses
  of mithridate, Venice treacle, and other potent alexipharmics.</p>

  <p>He had soon the satisfaction of perceiving that his son became somewhat
  easier; and after swallowing the posset-drink prepared by old Josyna, who
  used all the expedition she could, a moisture broke out upon the youth's
  skin, and appeared to relieve him so much, that, but for the ghastly paleness
  of his countenance, and the muddy look of his eye, his father would have
  indulged a hope of his recovery.</p>

  <p>Up to this time, the grocer had acted for himself, and felt confident he
  had acted rightly; but he now deemed it expedient to call in advice, and,
  accordingly, commissioned his apprentice to fetch Doctor Hodges, a physician,
  residing in Great Knightrider-street, Doctors' Commons, who had recently
  acquired considerable reputation for his skilful treatment of those attacked
  by the plague, and who (it may be incidentally mentioned) afterwards gave to
  the medical world a curious account of the ravages of the disorder, as well
  as of his own professional experiences during this terrible period. He
  likewise told him&mdash;and he could not repress a sigh as he did so&mdash;to
  give notice to the Examiner of Health (there were one or two officers, so
  designated, appointed to every parish, at this awful season, by the city
  authorities) that his house was infected.</p>

  <p>While preparing to set out, Leonard again debated with himself whether he
  should acquaint his master with Maurice Wyvil's meditated visit. But
  conceiving it wholly impossible that Amabel could leave her mother's room,
  even if she were disposed to do so, he determined to let the affair take its
  course. On his way to the shop, he entered a small room occupied by Blaize,
  and found him seated near a table, with his hands upon his knees, and his
  eyes fixed upon the ground, looking the very image of despair. The atmosphere
  smelt like that of an apothecary's shop, and was so overpowering, that
  Leonard could scarcely breathe. The table was covered with pill-boxes and
  phials, most of which were emptied, and a dim light was afforded by a candle
  with a most portentous crest of snuff.</p>

  <p>"So you have been poisoning yourself, I perceive," observed Leonard,
  approaching him.</p>

  <p>"Keep off!" cried the porter, springing suddenly to his feet. "Don't touch
  me, I say. Poisoning myself! I have taken three rufuses, or pestilential
  pills; two spoonfuls of alexiteral water; the same quantity of
  anti-pestilential decoction; half as much of Sir Theodore Mayerne's
  electuary; and a large dose of orvietan. Do you call that poisoning myself? I
  call it taking proper precaution, and would recommend you to do the same.
  Beside this, I have sprinkled myself with vinegar, fumigated my clothes, and
  rubbed my nose, inside and out, till it smarted so intolerably, I was obliged
  to desist, with balsam of sulphur."</p>

  <p>"Well, well, if you don't escape the plague, it won't be your fault,"
  returned Leonard, scarcely able to refrain from laughing. "But I have
  something to tell you before I go."</p>

  <p>"What is the matter?" demanded Blaize, in alarm. "Where&mdash;where are
  you going?"</p>

  <p>"To fetch the doctor," replied Leonard.</p>

  <p>"Is Master Stephen worse?" rejoined the porter.</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, I hope he is better," replied Leonard "I shall be back
  directly, but as I have to give notice to the Examiner of Health that the
  house is infected, I may be detained a few minutes longer than I anticipate.
  Keep the street-door locked; I will fasten the yard-gate, and do not for your
  life let any one in, except Doctor Hodges, till I return. Do you
  hear?&mdash;do you understand what I say?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I hear plain enough," growled Blaize. "You say that the house is
  infected, and that we shall all be locked up."</p>

  <p>"Dolt!" exclaimed the apprentice, "I said no such thing." And he repeated
  his injunctions, but Blaize was too much terrified to comprehend them. At
  last, losing all patience, Leonard cried in a menacing tone, "If you do not
  attend to me, I will cudgel you within an inch of your life, and you will
  find the thrashing harder to bear even than the plague itself. Rouse
  yourself, fool, and follow me."</p>

  <p>Accompanied by the porter, he hurried to the yard-gate, saw it bolted
  within-side, and then returned to the shop, where, having found his cap and
  cudgel, he directed Blaize to lock the door after him, cautioning him, for
  the third time, not to admit any one except the doctor. "If I find, on my
  return, that you have neglected my injunctions," he concluded, "as sure as I
  now stand before you, I'll break every bone in your body."</p>

  <p>Blaize promised obedience, adding in a supplicating tone, "Leonard, if I
  were you, I would not go to the Examiner of Health. Poor Stephen may not have
  the plague, after all. It's a dreadful thing to be imprisoned for a month,
  for that's the time appointed by the Lord Mayor. Only a week ago I passed
  several houses in Holborn, shut up on account of the plague, with a watchman
  at the door, and I never shall forget the melancholy faces I saw at the
  windows. It was a dreadful spectacle, and has haunted me ever since."</p>

  <p>"It cannot be helped," rejoined Leonard, with a sigh. "If we disobey the
  Lord Mayor's orders, and neglect giving information, we shall all be sent to
  Newgate, while poor Stephen will be taken to the pest-house. Besides, the
  searchers will be here before morning. They are sure to learn what has
  happened from Doctor Hodges."</p>

  <p>"True, true," replied Blaize; "I had forgotten that. Let me go with you,
  dear Leonard. I dare not remain here longer."</p>

  <p>"What! would you leave your kind good master, at a time like this, when he
  most needs your services?" rejoined Leonard, reproachfully. "Out, cowardly
  hound! I am ashamed of you. Shake off your fears, and be a man. You can but
  die once; and what matters it whether you die of the plague or the
  cholic?"</p>

  <p>"It matters a great deal," replied Blaize. "I am afraid of nothing but the
  plague. I am sure I shall be its next victim in this house. But you are
  right&mdash;I cannot desert my kind master, nor my old mother. Farewell,
  Leonard. Perhaps we may never meet again. I may be dead before you come back.
  I feel very ill already."</p>

  <p>"No wonder, after all the stuff you have swallowed," returned Leonard.
  "But pluck up your courage, or you will bring on the very thing you are
  anxious to avoid. As many people have died from fear as from any other cause.
  One word before I go. If any one should get into the house by scaling the
  yard-wall, or through the window, instantly alarm our master."</p>

  <p>"Certainly," returned Blaize, with a look of surprise, "But do you expect
  any one to enter the house in that way?"</p>

  <p>"Ask no questions, but do as I bid you," rejoined Leonard, opening the
  door, and about to go forth.</p>

  <p>"Stop a moment," cried Blaize, detaining him, and drawing from his pocket
  a handful of simples. "Won't you take some of them with you to guard against
  infection? There's wormwood, woodsorrel, masterwort, zedoary, and angelica;
  and lastly, there is a little bottle of the sovereign preservative against
  the plague, as prepared by the great Lord Bacon, and approved by Queen
  Elizabeth. Won't you take <i>that</i>?"</p>

  <p>"I have no fear," replied Leonard, shutting the door in his face. And as
  he lingered for a moment while it was locked, he heard Blaize say to himself,
  "I must go and take three more rufuses and a large dose of diascordium."</p>

  <p>It was a bright moonlight night, and as the apprentice turned to depart,
  he perceived a figure hastily retreating on the other side of the way. Making
  sure it was Maurice Wyvil, though he could not distinguish the garb of the
  person&mdash;that side of the street being in the shade&mdash;and stung by
  jealousy, he immediately started in pursuit. The fugitive struck down
  Lad-lane, and run on till he came to the end of Lawrence-lane, where, finding
  himself closely pressed, he suddenly halted, and pulling his hat over his
  brows to conceal his features, fiercely confronted his pursuer.</p>

  <p>"Why do you follow me thus, rascal?" he cried, drawing his sword. "Would
  you rob me? Begone, or I will call the watch."</p>

  <p>"It <i>is</i> his voice!" cried the apprentice. "I have news for you, Mr.
  Maurice Wyvil. You will not see Amabel to-night. The plague is in her
  father's house."</p>

  <p>"The plague!" exclaimed Wyvil, in an altered tone, and dropping the point
  of his sword. "Is she smitten by it?"</p>

  <p>The apprentice answered by a bitter laugh, and without tarrying longer to
  enjoy his rival's distress, set off towards Cheapside. Before reaching the
  end of Lawrence-lane, however, he half-repented his conduct, and halted to
  see whether Wyvil was following him; but as he could perceive nothing of him,
  he continued his course.</p>

  <p>Entering Cheapside, he observed, to his surprise, a crowd of persons
  collected near the Cross, then standing a little to the east of Wood-street.
  This cross, which was of great antiquity, and had undergone many mutilations
  and alterations since its erection in 1486, when it boasted, amongst other
  embellishments, images of the Virgin and Saint Edward the Confessor, was
  still not without some pretensions to architectural beauty. In form it was
  hexagonal, and composed of three tiers, rising from one another like the
  divisions of a telescope, each angle being supported by a pillar surmounted
  by a statue, while the intervening niches were filled up with sculptures,
  intended to represent some of the sovereigns of England. The structure was of
  considerable height, and crowned by a large gilt cross. Its base was
  protected by a strong wooden railing. About a hundred yards to the east,
  there stood a smaller hexagonal tower, likewise ornamented with carvings, and
  having a figure on its conical summit blowing a horn. This was the Conduit.
  Midway between these buildings the crowd alluded to above was collected.</p>

  <p>As Leonard drew near, he found the assemblage was listening to the
  exhortations of an enthusiast, whom he instantly recognised from a
  description he had heard of him from Blaize. The name of this half-crazed
  being was Solomon Eagle. Originally a Quaker, upon the outbreak of the plague
  he had abandoned his home and friends, and roamed the streets at night,
  denouncing doom to the city. He was a tall gaunt man, with long jet-black
  hair hanging in disordered masses over his shoulders. His eyes were large and
  black, and blazed with insane lustre, and his looks were so wild and
  terrific, that it required no great stretch of imagination to convert him
  into the genius of the pestilence. Entirely stripped of apparel except that
  his loins were girt with a sheep-skin, in imitation of Saint John in the
  Wilderness, he bore upon his head a brazier of flaming coals, the lurid light
  of which falling upon his sable locks and tawny skin, gave him an unearthly
  appearance.</p>

  <p>Impelled by curiosity, Leonard paused for a moment to listen, and heard
  him thunder forth the following denunciation:&mdash;"And now, therefore, as
  the prophet Jeremiah saith, 'I have this day declared it to you, but ye have
  not obeyed the voice of the Lord your God, nor anything for the which he hath
  sent me unto you. Now, therefore, know certainly that ye shall die by the
  sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence.' Again, in the words of the
  prophet Amos, the Lord saith unto YOU by my mouth, 'I have sent among you the
  pestilence after the manner of Egypt, yet have you not returned unto me.
  Therefore, will I do this unto thee, O Israel; and because I will do this
  unto thee, prepare to meet thy God?' Do you hear this, O sinners? God will
  proceed against you in the day of His wrath, though He hath borne with you in
  the day of His patience? O how many hundred years hath He spared this city,
  notwithstanding its great provocations and wickedness! But now He will no
  longer show it pity, but will pour out His wrath upon it I Plagues shall come
  upon it, and desolation; and it shall be utterly burnt with fire,&mdash;for
  strong is the Lord who judgeth it!"</p>

  <p>His address concluded, the enthusiast started off at a swift pace,
  shrieking, in a voice that caused many persons to throw open their windows to
  listen to him, "Awake! sinners, awake'&mdash;the plague is at your
  doors!&mdash;the grave yawns for you!&mdash;awake, and repent!" And followed
  by the crowd, many of whom kept up with him, he ran on vociferating in this
  manner till he was out of hearing.</p>

  <p>Hurrying forward in the opposite direction, Leonard glanced at the ancient
  and picturesque houses on either side of the way,&mdash;now bathed in the
  moonlight, and apparently hushed in repose and security,&mdash;and he could
  not repress a shudder as he reflected that an evil angel was, indeed, abroad,
  who might suddenly arouse their slumbering inmates to despair and death. His
  thoughts took another turn as he entered the precincts of Saint Paul's, and
  surveyed the venerable and majestic fabric before him. His eyes rested upon
  its innumerable crocketed pinnacles, its buttresses, its battlements, and
  upon the magnificent rose-window terminating the choir. The apprentice had no
  especial love for antiquity, but being of an imaginative turn, the sight of
  this reverend structure conjured up old recollections, and brought to mind
  the noble Collegiate Church of his native town.</p>

  <p>"Shall I ever see Manchester again?" he sighed: "shall I take Amabel with
  me there? Alas! I doubt it. If I survive the plague, she, I fear, will never
  be mine."</p>

  <p>Musing thus, he scanned the roof of the cathedral, and noticing its
  stunted central tower, could not help thinking how much more striking its
  effects must have been, when the lofty spire it once supported was standing.
  The spire, it may be remarked, was twice destroyed by lightning; first in
  February, 1444, and subsequently in June, 1561, when it was entirely burnt
  down, and never rebuilt. Passing the Convocation House, which then stood at
  one side of the southern transept, Leonard struck down Paul's Chain, and
  turning to the right, speeded along Great Knightrider-street, until he
  reached an old habitation at the corner of the passage leading to Doctors'
  Commons.</p>

  <p>Knocking at the door, an elderly servant presently appeared, and in answer
  to his inquiries whether Doctor Hodges was at home, stated that he had gone
  out, about half an hour ago, to attend Mr. Fisher, a proctor, who had been
  suddenly attacked by the plague at his residence in Bartholomew-close, near
  Smithfield.</p>

  <p>"I am come on the same errand," said Leonard, "and must see your master
  instantly."</p>

  <p>"If you choose to go to Bartholomew-close," replied the servant, "you may
  probably meet with him. Mr. Fisher's house is the last but two, on the right,
  before you come to the area in front of the church."</p>

  <p>"I can easily find it," returned Leonard, "and will run there as fast as I
  can. But if your master should pass me on the road, beseech him to go
  instantly to Stephen Bloundell's, the grocer, in Wood-street."</p>

  <p>The servant assenting, Leonard hastily retraced his steps, and traversing
  Blow-bladder-street and Saint-Martin's-le-Grand, passed through Aldersgate.
  He then shaped his course through the windings of Little Britain and entered
  Duck-lane. He was now in a quarter fearfully assailed by the pestilence. Most
  of the houses had the fatal sign upon their doors&mdash;a red cross, of a
  foot long, with the piteous words above it, "Lord have mercy upon us," in
  characters so legible that they could be easily distinguished by the
  moonlight, while a watchman, with a halberd in his hand, kept guard
  outside.</p>

  <p>Involuntarily drawing in his breath, Leonard quickened his pace. But he
  met with an unexpected and fearful interruption. Just as he reached the
  narrow passage leading from Duck-lane to Bartholomew-close, he heard the
  ringing of a bell, followed by a hoarse voice, crying, "Bring out your
  dead&mdash;bring out your dead!" he then perceived that a large,
  strangely-shaped cart stopped up the further end of the passage, and heard a
  window open, and a voice call out that all was ready. The next moment a light
  was seen at the door, and a coffin was brought out and placed in the cart.
  This done, the driver, who was smoking a pipe, cracked his whip, and put the
  vehicle in motion.</p>

  <p>Shrinking into a doorway, and holding a handkerchief to his face, to avoid
  breathing the pestilential effluvia, Leonard saw that there were other
  coffins in the cart, and that it was followed by two persons in long black
  cloaks. The vehicle itself, fashioned like an open hearse, and of the same
  sombre colour, relieved by fantastical designs, painted in white, emblematic
  of the pestilence, was drawn by a horse of the large black Flanders breed,
  and decorated with funeral trappings. To Leonard's inexpressible horror, the
  cart again stopped opposite him, and the driver ringing his bell, repeated
  his doleful cry. While another coffin was brought out, and placed with the
  rest, a window in the next house was opened, and a woman looking forth
  screamed, "Is Anselm Chowles, the coffin-maker, there?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, here I am, Mother Malmayns," replied one of the men in black cloaks,
  looking up as he spoke, and exhibiting features so hideous, and stamped with
  such a revolting expression, that Leonard's blood curdled at the sight. "What
  do you want with me?" he added.</p>

  <p>"I want you to carry away old Mike Norborough," replied the woman.</p>

  <p>"What, is the old miser gone at last?" exclaimed Chowles, with an
  atrocious laugh. "But how shall I get paid for a coffin?"</p>

  <p>"You may pay yourself with what you can find in the house," replied Mother
  Malmayns; "or you may carry him to the grave without one, if you prefer
  it."</p>

  <p>"No, no, that won't do," returned Chowles. "I've other customers to attend
  to who <i>will</i> pay; and, besides, I want to get home. I expect friends at
  supper. Good-night, Mother Malmayns. You know where to find me, if you want
  me. Move on, Jonas, or you will never reach Saint Sepulchre's."</p>

  <p>The woman angrily expostulated with him, and some further parley
  ensued,&mdash;Leonard did not tarry to hear what, but rushing past them,
  gained Bartholomew-close.</p>

  <p>He soon reached the proctor's house, and found it marked with the fatal
  cross. Addressing a watchman at the door, he learnt, to his great dismay,
  that Doctor Hodges had been gone more than a quarter of an hour. "He was too
  late," said the man. "Poor Mr. Fisher had breathed his last before he
  arrived, and after giving some directions to the family as to the precautions
  they ought to observe, the doctor departed."</p>

  <p>"How unfortunate!" exclaimed Leonard, "I have missed him a second time.
  But I will run back to his house instantly."</p>

  <p>"You will not find him at home," returned the watchman "He is gone to
  Saint Paul's, to attend a sick person."</p>

  <p>"To Saint Paul's at this hour!" cried the apprentice. "Why, no one is
  there, except the vergers or the sexton."</p>

  <p>"He is gone to visit the sexton, who is ill of the plague," replied the
  watchman. "I have told you all I know about him. You can do what you think
  best."</p>

  <p>Determined to make another effort before giving in, Leonard hurried back
  as fast as he could. While threading Duck-lane, he heard the doleful bell
  again, and perceived the dead-cart standing before a house, from which two
  small coffins were brought. Hurrying past the vehicle, he remarked that its
  load was fearfully increased, but that the coffin-maker and his companion had
  left it. Another minute had not elapsed before he reached Aldersgate, and
  passing through the postern, he beheld a light at the end of Saint
  Anne's-lane, and heard the terrible voice of Solomon Eagle, calling to the
  sleepers to awake and repent.</p>

  <p>Shutting his ears to the cry, Leonard did not halt till he reached the
  great western door of the cathedral, against which he knocked. His first
  summons remaining unanswered, he repeated it, and a wicket was then opened by
  a grey-headed verger, with a lantern in his hand, who at first was very angry
  at being disturbed; but on learning whom the applicant was in search of, and
  that the case was one of urgent necessity, he admitted that the doctor was in
  the cathedral at the time.</p>

  <p>"Or rather, I should say," he added, "he is in Saint Faith's. I will
  conduct you to him, if you think proper. Doctor Hodges is a good man,&mdash;a
  charitable man," he continued, "and attends the poor for nothing. He is now
  with Matthew Malmayns, the sexton, who was taken ill of the plague yesterday,
  and will get nothing but thanks&mdash;if he gets those&mdash;for his fee.
  But, follow me, young man, follow me."</p>

  <p>So saying, he shut the wicket, and led the way along the transept. The
  path was uneven, many of the flags having been removed, and the verger often
  paused to throw a light upon the ground, and warn his companion of a
  hole.</p>

  <p>On arriving at the head of the nave, Leonard cast his eyes down it, and
  was surprised at the magical effect of the moonlight upon its magnificent
  avenue of pillars; the massive shafts on the left being completely
  illuminated by the silvery beams, while those on the right lay in deep
  shadow.</p>

  <p>"Ay, it is a noble structure," replied the old verger, noticing his look
  of wonder and admiration, "and, like many a proud human being, has known
  better days. It has seen sad changes in my time, for I recollect it when good
  Queen Bess ruled the land. But come along, young man,&mdash;you have
  something else to think of now."</p>

  <p>Bestowing a momentary glance upon the matchless choir, with its groined
  roof, its clerestory windows, its arched openings, its carved stalls, and its
  gorgeous rose-window, Leonard followed his conductor through a small doorway
  on the left of the southern transept, and descending a flight of stone steps,
  entered a dark and extensive vault, for such it seemed. The feeble light of
  the lantern fell upon ranks of short heavy pillars, supporting a ponderous
  arched roof.</p>

  <p>"You are now in Saint Faith's," observed the verger, "and above you is the
  choir of Saint Paul's."</p>

  <p>Leonard took no notice of the remark, but silently crossing the nave of
  this beautiful subterranean church (part of which still exists), traversed
  its northern aisle. At length the verger stopped before the entrance of a
  small chapel, once dedicated to Saint John the Baptist, but now devoted to a
  less sacred purpose. As they advanced, Leonard observed a pile of dried
  skulls and bones in one corner, a stone coffin, strips of woollen shrouds,
  fragments of coffins, mattocks, and spades. It was evidently half a charnel,
  half a receptacle for the sexton's tools.</p>

  <p>"If you choose to open that door," said the verger, pointing to one at the
  lower end of the chamber, "you will find him you seek. I shall go no
  further."</p>

  <p>Summoning up all his resolution, Leonard pushed open the door. A frightful
  scene met his gaze. At one side of a deep, low-roofed vault, the architecture
  of which was of great antiquity, and showed that it had been a place of
  burial, was stretched a miserable pallet, and upon it, covered by a single
  blanket, lay a wretch, whose groans and struggles proclaimed the anguish he
  endured. A lamp was burning on the floor, and threw a sickly light upon the
  agonized countenance of the sufferer. He was a middle-aged man, with features
  naturally harsh, but which now, contracted by pain, had assumed a revolting
  expression. An old crone, who proved to be his mother, and a young man, who
  held him down in bed by main force, tended him. He was rambling in a
  frightful manner; and as his ravings turned upon the most loathly matters, it
  required some firmness to listen to them.</p>

  <p>At a little distance from him, upon a bench, sat a stout, shrewd-looking,
  but benevolent little personage, somewhat between forty and fifty. This was
  Doctor Hodges. He had a lancet in his hand, with which he had just operated
  upon the sufferer, and he was in the act of wiping it on a cloth. As Leonard
  entered the vault, the doctor observed to the attendants of the sick man, "He
  will recover. The tumour has discharged its venom. Keep him as warm as you
  can, and do not let him leave his bed for two days. All depends upon that. I
  will send him proper medicines and some blankets shortly. If he takes cold,
  it will be fatal."</p>

  <p>The young man promised to attend to the doctor's injunctions, and the old
  woman mumbled her thanks.</p>

  <p>"Where is Judith Malmayns?" asked Doctor Hodges: "I am surprised not to
  see her. Is she afraid of the distemper?"</p>

  <p>"Afraid of it!&mdash;not she," replied the old woman. "Since the plague
  has raged so dreadfully, she has gone out as a nurse to the sick, and my poor
  son has seen nothing of her."</p>

  <p>Leonard then recollected that he had heard the woman, who called out of
  the miser's house, addressed as Mother Malmayns by the coffin-maker, and had
  no doubt that she was the sexton's wife. His entrance having been so
  noiseless that it passed unnoticed, he now stepped forward, and, addressing
  Doctor Hodges, acquainted him with his errand.</p>

  <p>"What!" exclaimed the doctor, as soon as he concluded, "a son of Stephen
  Bloundel, the worthy grocer of Wood-street, attacked by the plague! I will go
  with you instantly, young man. I have a great regard for your master&mdash;a
  very great regard. There is not a better man living. The poor lad must be
  saved, if possible." And hastily repeating his instructions to the attendants
  of the sick man, he left the vault with the apprentice.</p>

  <p>They found the verger in the charnel, and before quitting it, the doctor
  drew a small flask of canary from his pocket, and applied it to his lips.</p>

  <p>"This is my anti-pestilential drink," he remarked with a smile, "and it
  has preserved me from contagion hitherto. You must let us out of the south
  door, friend," he added to the verger, "for I shall be obliged to step home
  for a moment, and it will save time. Come with me, young man, and tell me
  what has been done for the grocer's son."</p>

  <p>As they traversed the gloomy aisle of Saint Faith, and mounted to the
  upper structure, Leonard related all that had taken place since poor
  Stephen's seizure. The doctor strongly expressed his approval of what had
  been done, and observed, "It could not be better. With Heaven's help, I have
  no doubt we shall save him, and I am truly glad of it for his father's
  sake."</p>

  <p>By this time they had reached the southern door, and the verger having
  unlocked it, they issued forth. It was still bright moonlight, and Leonard,
  whose mind was greatly relieved by the assurances of the physician, felt in
  some degree reconciled to the delay, and kept up his part in the conversation
  promoted by his companion. The doctor, who was an extremely kind-hearted man,
  and appeared to have a great regard for the grocer, made many inquiries as to
  his family, and spoke in terms of the highest admiration of the beauty of his
  eldest daughter. The mention of Amabel's name, while it made Leonard's cheek
  burn, rekindled all his jealousy of Wyvil, and he tried to make some excuse
  to get away, but his companion would not hear of it.</p>

  <p>"I tell you there is no hurry," said the doctor; "all is going on as well
  as possible. I will make your excuses to your master."</p>

  <p>"On reaching the doctor's house they were ushered into a large room,
  surrounded with bookshelves and cases of anatomical preparations. Hodges
  seated himself at a table, on which a shaded lamp was placed, and writing out
  a prescription, desired his servant to get it made up at a neighbouring
  apothecary's, and to take it, with a couple of blankets, to the sexton of
  Saint Paul's. He then produced a bottle of medicated canary, and pouring out
  a large glass for the apprentice, drained another himself.</p>

  <p>"I will answer for its virtue," he said: "it is a sure preservative
  against the plague."</p>

  <p>Having furnished himself with several small packets of simples, a few pots
  of ointment, one or two phials, and a case of surgical instruments, he told
  Leonard he was ready to attend him.</p>

  <p>"We will go round by Warwick-lane," he added. "I must call upon Chowles,
  the coffin-maker. It will not detain us a moment; and I have an order to give
  him."</p>

  <p>The mention of this name brought to Leonard's mind the hideous attendant
  on the dead-cart, and he had no doubt he was the person in question. It did
  not become him, however, to make a remark, and they set out.</p>

  <p>Mounting Addle-hill, and threading Ave-Maria-lane, they entered
  Warwick-lane, and about half-way up the latter thoroughfare, the doctor
  stopped before a shop, bearing on its immense projecting sign the
  representation of a coffin lying in state, and covered with scutcheons,
  underneath which was written, "ANSELM CHOWLES, COFFIN-MAKER."</p>

  <p>"I do not think you will find Mr. Chowles at home," observed Leonard: "for
  I saw him with the dead-cart not half an hour ago."</p>

  <p>"Very likely," returned the doctor; "but I shall see one of his men. The
  coffin-maker's business is now carried on in the night time," he added, with
  a sigh; "and he drives a flourishing trade. These sad times will make his
  fortune."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he rapped with his cane at the door, which, after a little
  delay, was opened by a young man in a carpenter's dress, with a hammer in his
  hand. On seeing who it was, this person exhibited great confusion, and would
  have retired; but the doctor, pushing him aside, asked for his master.</p>

  <p>"You cannot see him just now, sir," replied the other, evidently
  considerably embarrassed. "He is just come home greatly fatigued, and is
  about to retire to rest."</p>

  <p>"No matter," returned the doctor, entering a room, in which three or four
  other men were at work, hastily finishing coffins; "I <i>must</i> see
  him."</p>

  <p>No further opposition being offered, Hodges, followed by the apprentice,
  marched towards an inner room. Just as he reached the door, a burst of loud
  laughter, evidently proceeding from a numerous party, arose from within, and
  a harsh voice was heard chanting the following strains:</p>

  <p>SONG OF THE PLAGUE. To others the Plague a foe may be, To me 'tis a
  friend&mdash;not an enemy; My coffins and coffers alike it fills, And the
  richer I grow the more it kills. <i>Drink the Plague! Drink the
  Plague!</i></p>

  <p>For months, for years, may it spend its rage On lusty manhood and
  trembling age; Though half mankind of the scourge should die, My coffins will
  sell&mdash;so what care I? <i>Drink the Plague! Drink the Plague!</i></p>

  <p>Loud acclamations followed the song, and the doctor, who was filled with
  disgust and astonishment, opened the door. He absolutely recoiled at the
  scene presented to his gaze. In the midst of a large room, the sides of which
  were crowded with coffins, piled to the very ceiling, sat about a dozen
  personages, with pipes in their mouths, and flasks and glasses before them.
  Their seats were coffins, and their table was a coffin set upon a bier.
  Perched on a pyramid of coffins, gradually diminishing in size as the pile
  approached its apex, Chowles was waving a glass in one hand, and a bottle in
  the other, when the doctor made his appearance.</p>

  <p>A more hideous personage cannot be imagined than the coffin-maker. He was
  clothed in a suit of rusty black, which made his skeleton limbs look yet more
  lean and cadaverous. His head was perfectly bald, and its yellow skin,
  divested of any artificial covering, glistened like polished ivory. His
  throat was long and scraggy, and supported a head unrivalled for ugliness.
  His nose had been broken in his youth, and was almost compressed flat with
  his face. His few remaining teeth were yellow and discoloured with large gaps
  between them. His eyes were bright, and set in deep cavernous recesses, and,
  now that he was more than half-intoxicated, gleamed with unnatural lustre.
  The friends by whom he was surrounded were congenial
  spirits,&mdash;searchers, watchmen, buriers, apothecaries, and other
  wretches, who, like himself, rejoiced in the pestilence, because it was a
  source of profit to them.</p>

  <p>At one corner of the room, with a part-emptied glass before her, and
  several articles in her lap, which she hastily pocketed on the entrance of
  the doctor, sat the plague-nurse, Mother Malmayns; and Leonard thought her,
  if possible, more villainous-looking than her companions. She was a rough,
  raw-boned woman, with sandy hair and light brows, a sallow, freckled
  complexion, a nose with wide nostrils, and a large, thick-lipped mouth. She
  had, moreover, a look of mingled cunning and ferocity inexpressibly
  revolting.</p>

  <p>Sharply rebuking Chowles, who, in springing from his lofty seat, upset
  several of the topmost coffins, the doctor gave him some directions, and,
  turning to the nurse, informed her of her husband's condition, and ordered
  her to go to him immediately Mother Malmayns arose, and glancing
  significantly at the coffin-maker, took her departure.</p>

  <p>Repeating his injunctions to Chowles in a severe tone, the doctor
  followed; and seeing her take the way towards Saint Paul's, proceeded at a
  brisk pace along Paternoster-row with the apprentice. In a few minutes they
  reached Wood-street, and knocking at the door, were admitted by Blaize.</p>

  <p>"Heaven be praised, you are come at last!" exclaimed the porter. "Our
  master began to think something had happened to you."</p>

  <p>"It is all my fault," returned Doctor Hodges; "but how is the young
  man?"</p>

  <p>"Better, much better, as I understand," replied Blaize; "but I have not
  seen him."</p>

  <p>"Come, that's well," rejoined Hodges. "Lead me to his room."</p>

  <p>"Leonard will show you the way," returned the porter, holding back.</p>

  <p>Glancing angrily at Blaize, the apprentice conducted the doctor to the
  inner room, where they found the grocer, with the Bible on his knee, watching
  by the bedside of his son. He was delighted with their appearance, but looked
  inquisitively at his apprentice for some explanation of his long absence.
  This Hodges immediately gave; and, having examined the sufferer, he relieved
  the anxious father by declaring, that, with due care, he had little doubt of
  his son's recovery.</p>

  <p>"God be praised!" exclaimed Bloundel, falling on his knees.</p>

  <p>Hodges then gave minute directions to the grocer as to how he was to
  proceed, and told him it would be necessary for some time to keep his family
  separate. To this Bloundel readily agreed. The doctor's next inquiries were,
  whether notice had been given to the Examiner of Health, and the grocer
  referring to Leonard, the latter acknowledged that he had forgotten it, but
  undertook to repair his omission at once.</p>

  <p>With this view, he quitted the room, and was hastening towards the shop,
  when he observed a figure on the back stairs. Quickly mounting them, he
  overtook on the landing Maurice Wyvil.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch1-3"
     name="ch1-3">III. &mdash; THE GAMESTER AND THE BULLY.</a></h2>

  <p>Before proceeding further, it will be necessary to retrace our steps for a
  short time, and see what was done by Maurice Wyvil after the alarming
  announcement made to him by the apprentice. Of a selfish nature and
  ungovernable temper, and seeking only in the pursuit of the grocer's daughter
  the gratification of his lawless desires, he was filled, in the first
  instance, with furious disappointment at being robbed of the prize, at the
  very moment he expected it to fall into his hands. But this feeling was
  quickly effaced by anxiety respecting his mistress, whose charms, now that
  there was every probability of losing her (for Leonard's insinuation had led
  him to believe she was assailed by the pestilence), appeared doubly
  attractive to him; and scarcely under the governance of reason, he hurried
  towards Wood-street, resolved to force his way into the house, and see her
  again, at all hazards. His wild design, however, was fortunately prevented.
  As he passed the end of the court leading to the ancient inn (for it was
  ancient even at the time of this history), the Swan-with-two-Necks, in
  Lad-lane, a young man, as richly attired as himself, and about his own age,
  who had seen him approaching, suddenly darted from it, and grasping his
  cloak, detained him.</p>

  <p>"I thought it must be you, Wyvil," cried this person. "Where are you
  running so quickly? I see neither angry father, nor jealous apprentice, at
  your heels. What has become of the girl? Are you tired of her already?"</p>

  <p>"Let me go, Lydyard," returned Wyvil, trying to extricate himself from his
  companion's hold, who was no other than the gallant that had accompanied him
  on his first visit to the grocer's shop, and had played his part so adroitly
  in the scheme devised between them to procure an interview with
  Amabel,&mdash;"let me go, I say, I am in no mood for jesting."</p>

  <p>"Why, what the plague is the matter?" rejoined Lydyard. "Has your mistress
  played you false? Have you lost your wager?"</p>

  <p>"The plague <i>is</i> the matter," replied Wyvil, sternly. "Amabel is
  attacked by it. I must see her instantly."</p>

  <p>"The devil!" exclaimed Lydyard. "Here is a pretty termination to the
  affair. But if this is really the case, you must <i>not</i> see her. It is
  one thing to be run through the arm,&mdash;which you must own I managed as
  dexterously as the best master of fence could have done,&mdash;and lose a few
  drops of blood for a mistress, but it is another to brave the plague on her
  account."</p>

  <p>"I care for nothing," replied Wyvil; "I <i>will</i> see her."</p>

  <p>"This is madness!" remonstrated Lydyard, still maintaining his grasp.
  "What satisfaction will it afford you to witness her sufferings&mdash;to see
  the frightful ravages made upon her charms by this remorseless
  disease,&mdash;to throw her whole family into consternation, and destroy the
  little chance she may have of recovery, by your presence? What good will this
  do? No,&mdash;you must pay your wager to Sedley, and forget her."</p>

  <p>"I cannot forget her," replied Wyvil. "My feelings have undergone a total
  change. If I <i>am</i> capable of real love, it is for her."</p>

  <p>"Real love!" exclaimed Lydyard, in an incredulous tone. "If the subject
  were not too serious, I should laugh in your face. No doubt you would marry
  her, and abandon your design upon the rich heiress, pretty Mistress Mallet,
  whom old Rowley recommended to your attention, and whom the fair Stewart has
  more than half-won for you?"</p>

  <p>"I would," replied the other, energetically.</p>

  <p>"Nay, then, you are more insane than I thought you," rejoined Lydyard,
  relinquishing his hold; "and the sooner you take the plague the better. It
  may cure your present brain fever. I shall go back to Parravicin, and the
  others. You will not require my assistance further."</p>

  <p>"I know not," replied Wyvil, distractedly; "I have not yet given up my
  intention of carrying off the girl."</p>

  <p>"If you carry her oft in this state," rejoined the other, "it must be to
  the pest-house. But who told you she was attacked by the plague?"</p>

  <p>"Her father's apprentice," replied Wyvil.</p>

  <p>"And you believed him?" demanded Lydyard, with a derisive laugh.</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly," replied Wyvil. "Why not?"</p>

  <p>"Because it is evidently a mere trick to frighten you from the house,"
  rejoined Lydyard. "I am surprised so shallow a device should succeed with
  <i>you</i>."</p>

  <p>"I wish I could persuade myself it was a trick," returned Wyvil. "But the
  fellow's manner convinced me he was in earnest."</p>

  <p>"Well, I will not dispute the point, though I am sure I am right,"
  returned Lydyard. "But be not too precipitate. Since the apprentice has seen
  you, some alteration may be necessary in your plans. Come with me into the
  house. A few minutes can make no difference."</p>

  <p>Wyvil suffered himself to be led up the court, and passing through a door
  on the left, they entered a spacious room, across which ran a long table,
  furnished at one end with wine and refreshments, and at the other with cards
  and dice.</p>

  <p>Three persons were seated at the table, the most noticeable of whom was a
  dissipated-looking young man, dressed in the extremity of the prevailing
  mode, with ruffles of the finest colbertine, three inches in depth, at his
  wrists; a richly-laced cravat round his throat; white silk hose, adorned with
  gold clocks; velvet shoes of the same colour as the hose, fastened with
  immense roses; a silver-hilted sword, supported by a broad embroidered silk
  band; and a cloak and doublet of carnation-coloured velvet, woven with gold,
  and decorated with innumerable glittering points and ribands. He had a
  flowing wig of flaxen hair, and a broad-leaved hat, looped with a diamond
  buckle, and placed negligently on the left side of his head. His figure was
  slight, but extremely well formed; and his features might have been termed
  handsome, but for their reckless and licentious expression. He was addressed
  by his companions as Sir Paul Parravicin.</p>

  <p>The person opposite to him, whose name was Disbrowe, and who was likewise
  a very handsome young man, though his features were flushed and disturbed,
  partly by the wine he had drunk, and partly by his losses at play, was
  equipped in the splendid accoutrements of a captain in the king's body-guard.
  His left hand convulsively clutched an empty purse, and his eyes were fixed
  upon a large sum of money, which he had just handed over to the knight, and
  which the latter was carelessly transferring to his pocket.</p>

  <p>The last of the three, whose looks betrayed his character&mdash;that of a
  sharper and a bully&mdash;called himself Major Pillichody, his pretensions to
  military rank being grounded upon his service (so ran his own statement,
  though it was never clearly substantiated) in the king's army during the
  civil wars. Major Pillichody was a man of remarkably fierce exterior. Seamed
  with many scars, and destitute of the left eye, the orifice of which was
  covered, with a huge black patch; his face was of a deep mulberry colour,
  clearly attesting his devotion to the bottle; while his nose, which was none
  of the smallest, was covered with "bubukles, and whelks, and knobs, and
  flames of fire." He was of the middle size, stoutly built, and given to
  corpulency, though not so much so as to impair his activity. His attire
  consisted of a cloak and doublet of scarlet cloth, very much stained and
  tarnished, and edged with gold lace, likewise the worse for wear; jack-boots,
  with huge funnel tops; spurs, with enormous rowels, and a rapier of
  preposterous length. He wore his own hair, which was swart and woolly, like
  that of a negro; and had beard and moustaches to match. His hat was fiercely
  cocked; his gestures swaggering and insolent; and he was perpetually racking
  his brain to invent new and extra-ordinary oaths.</p>

  <p>"So soon returned!" cried Parravicin, as Wyvil appeared. "Accept my
  congratulations?"</p>

  <p>"And mine!" cried Pillichody. "We wild fellows have but to be seen to
  conquer. Sugar and spice, and all that's nice!" he added, smacking his lips,
  as he filled a glass from a long-necked bottle on the table; "May the
  grocer's daughter prove sweeter than her father's plums, and more melting
  than his butter! Is she without? Are we to see her?"</p>

  <p>Wyvil made no answer, but, walking to the other end of the room, threw
  himself into a chair, and, covering his face with his hands, appeared wrapped
  in thought. Lydyard took a seat beside him, and endeavoured to engage him in
  conversation; but, finding his efforts fruitless, he desisted.</p>

  <p>"Something is wrong," observed Parravicin, to the major. "He has been
  foiled in his attempt to carry off the girl. Sedley has won his wager, and it
  is a heavy sum. Shall we resume our play?" he added, to Disbrowe.</p>

  <p>"I have nothing more to lose," observed the young man, filling a large
  goblet to the brim, and emptying it at a draught. "You are master of every
  farthing I possess."</p>

  <p>"Hum!" exclaimed Parravicin, taking up a pack of cards, and snapping them
  between his finger and thumb. "You are married, Captain Disbrowe?"</p>

  <p>"What if I am?" cried the young man, becoming suddenly pale; "what if I
  am?" he repeated.</p>

  <p>"I am told your wife is beautiful," replied Parravicin.</p>

  <p>"Beautiful!" ejaculated Pillichody; "by the well-filled coffers of the
  widow of Watling-street! she is an angel. Beautiful is not the word: Mrs.
  Disbrowe is divine!"</p>

  <p>"You have never seen her," said the young man, sternly.</p>

  <p>"Ha!&mdash;fire and fury! my word doubted," cried the major, fiercely. "I
  have seen her at the play-houses, at the Mulberry-garden, at court, and at
  church. Not seen her! By the one eye of a Cyclops, but I have! You shall hear
  my description of her, and judge of its correctness. <i>Imprimis</i>, she has
  a tall and majestic figure, and might be a queen for her dignity."</p>

  <p>"Go on," said Disbrowe, by no means displeased with the commencement.</p>

  <p>"Secondly," pursued Pillichody, "she has a clear olive complexion, bright
  black eyes, hair and brows to match, a small foot, a pretty turn-up nose, a
  dimpling cheek, a mole upon her throat, the rosiest lips imaginable, an
  alluring look&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No more," interrupted Disbrowe. "It is plain you have never seen
  her."</p>

  <p>"Unbelieving pagan!" exclaimed the major, clapping his hand furiously upon
  his sword. "I have done more&mdash;I have spoken with her."</p>

  <p>"A lie!" replied Disbrowe, hurling a dice-box at his head.</p>

  <p>"Ha!" roared Pillichody, in a voice of thunder, and pushing back his chair
  till it was stopped by the wall. "Death and fiends! I will make mincemeat of
  your heart, and send it as a love-offering to your wife."</p>

  <p>And, whipping out his long rapier, he would have assaulted Disbrowe, if
  Sir Paul had not interposed, and commanded him authoritatively to put up his
  blade.</p>

  <p>"You shall have your revenge in a safer way," he whispered.</p>

  <p>"Well, Sir Paul," rejoined the bully, with affected reluctance, "as you
  desire it, I will spare the young man's life. I must wash away the insult in
  burgundy, since I cannot do so in blood."</p>

  <p>With this, he emptied the flask next him, and called to a drawer, who was
  in attendance, in an imperious tone, to bring two more bottles.</p>

  <p>Parravicin, meanwhile, picked up the dice-box, and, seating himself,
  spread a large heap of gold on the table.</p>

  <p>"I mentioned your wife, Captain Disbrowe," he said, addressing the young
  officer, who anxiously watched his movements, "not with any intention of
  giving you offence, but to show you that, although you have lost your money,
  you have still a valuable stake left."</p>

  <p>"I do not understand you, Sir Paul," returned Disbrowe, with a look of
  indignant surprise.</p>

  <p>"To be plain, then," replied Parravicin, "I have won from you two hundred
  pounds&mdash;all you possess. You are a ruined man, and, as such, will run
  any hazard to retrieve your losses. I give you a last chance. I will stake
  all my winnings, nay, double the amount, against your wife. You have a key of
  the house you inhabit, by which you admit yourself at all hours; so at least
  the major informs me. If I win, that key shall be mine. I will take my chance
  for the rest. Do you understand me now?"</p>

  <p>"I do," replied the young man, with concentrated fury. "I understand that
  you are a villain. You have robbed me of my money, and would rob me of my
  honour."</p>

  <p>"These are harsh words, sir," replied the knight, calmly; "but let them
  pass. We will play first, and fight afterwards. But you refuse my challenge
  ?"</p>

  <p>"It is false!" replied Disbrowe, fiercely, "I accept it." And producing a
  key, he threw it on the table. "My life is, in truth, set on the die," he
  added, with a desperate look&mdash;"for if I lose, I will not survive my
  shame."</p>

  <p>"You will not forget our terms," observed Parravicin. "I am to be your
  representative to-night. You can return home to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"Throw, sir&mdash;throw," cried the young man, fiercely.</p>

  <p>"Pardon, me," replied the knight; "the first cast is with you. A single
  main decides it."</p>

  <p>"Be it so," returned Disbrowe, seizing the box. And as he shook the dice
  with a frenzied air, the major and Lydyard drew near the table, and even
  Wyvil roused himself to watch the result.</p>

  <p>"Twelve!" cried Disbrowe, as he removed the box. "My honour is saved! My
  fortune retrieved&mdash;Huzza!"</p>

  <p>"Not so fast," returned Parravicin, shaking the box in his turn. "You were
  a little too hasty," he added, uncovering the dice. "I am twelve, too. We
  must throw again."</p>

  <p>"This to decide," cried the young officer, again rattling the dice.
  "Six!"</p>

  <p>Parravicin smiled, took the box, and threw ten.</p>

  <p>"Perdition!" ejaculated Disbrowe, striking his brow with his clenched
  hand. "What devil tempted me to my undoing?&mdash;My wife trusted to this
  profligate! Horror!&mdash;it must not be!"</p>

  <p>"It is too late to retract," replied Parravicin, taking up the key, and
  turning with a triumphant look to his friends.</p>

  <p>Disbrowe noticed the smile, and stung beyond endurance, drew his sword,
  and called to the knight to defend himself.</p>

  <p>In an instant, passes were exchanged. But the conflict was brief. Fortune,
  as before, declared herself in favour of Parravicin. He disarmed his
  assailant, who rushed out of the room, uttering the wildest ejaculations of
  rage and despair.</p>

  <p>"I told you you should have your revenge," observed the knight to
  Pillichody, as soon as Disbrowe was gone. "Is his wife really as beautiful as
  you represent her?"</p>

  <p>"Words are too feeble to paint her charms," replied the major. "Shafts of
  Cupid! she must be seen to be appreciated."</p>

  <p>"Enough!" returned Parravicin. "I have not made a bad night's work of it,
  so far. I'faith, Wyvil, I pity you. To lose a heavy wager is provoking
  enough&mdash;but to lose a pretty mistress is the devil."</p>

  <p>"I have lost neither yet," replied Wyvil, who had completely recovered his
  spirits, and joined in the general merriment occasioned by the foregoing
  occurrence. "I have been baffled, not defeated. What say you to an exchange
  of mistresses? I am so diverted with your adventure, that I am half inclined
  to give you the grocer's daughter for Disbrowe's wife. She is a superb
  creature&mdash;languid as a Circassian, and passionate as an Andalusian."</p>

  <p>"I can't agree to the exchange, especially after your rapturous
  description," returned Parravicin, "but I'll stake Mrs. Disbrowe against
  Amabel. The winner shall have both. A single cast shall decide, as
  before."</p>

  <p>"No," replied Wyvil, "I could not resign Amabel, if I lost. And the luck
  is all on your side to-night."</p>

  <p>"As you please," rejoined the knight, sweeping the glittering pile into
  his pocket. "Drawer, another bottle of burgundy. A health to our mistresses!"
  he added, quaffing a brimmer.</p>

  <p>"A health to the grocer's daughter!" cried Wyvil, with difficulty
  repressing a shudder, as he uttered the pledge.</p>

  <p>"A health to the rich widow of Watling-street," cried Pillichody, draining
  a bumper, "and may I soon call her mine!"</p>

  <p>"I have no mistress to toast," said Lydyard; "and I have drunk wine
  enough. Do not forget, gentlemen, that the plague is abroad."</p>

  <p>"You are the death's-head at the feast, Lydyard," rejoined Parravicin,
  setting down his glass. "I hate the idea of the plague. It poisons all our
  pleasures. We must meet at noon to-morrow, at the Smyrna, to compare notes as
  to our successes. Before we separate, can I be of any further service to you,
  Wyvil? I came here to enjoy <i>your</i> triumph; but, egad, I have found so
  admirable a bubble in that hot-headed Disbrowe, whom I met at the Smyrna, and
  brought here to while away the time, that I must demand your congratulations
  upon <i>mine</i>."</p>

  <p>"You have certainly achieved an easy victory over the husband," returned
  Wyvil; "and I trust your success with the wife will be commensurate. I
  require no further assistance. What I have to do must be done alone. Lydyard
  will accompany me to the house, and then I must shift for myself."</p>

  <p>"Nay, we will all see you safe inside," returned Parravicin, "We shall
  pass by the grocer's shop. I know it well, having passed it a hundred times,
  in the vain hope of catching a glimpse of its lovely inmate."</p>

  <p>"I am glad it <i>was</i> a vain hope," replied Wyvil. "But I must scale a
  wall to surprise the garrison."</p>

  <p>"In that case you will need the rope-ladder," replied Lydyard; "it is in
  readiness."</p>

  <p>"I will carry it," said Pillichody, picking up the ladder which was lying
  in a corner of the room, and throwing it over his shoulders. "Bombs and
  batteries! I like to be an escalader when the forts of love are stormed."</p>

  <p>The party then set out. As they proceeded, Parravicin ascertained from the
  major that Disbrowe's house was situated in a small street leading out of
  Piccadilly, but as he could not be quite sure that he understood his
  informant aright, he engaged him to accompany him and point it out.</p>

  <p>By this time they had reached Wood-street, and keeping in the shade,
  reconnoitred the house. But though Wyvil clapped his hands, blew a shrill
  whistle, and made other signals, no answer was returned, nor was a light seen
  at any of the upper windows. On the contrary, all was still and silent as
  death.</p>

  <p>The grocer's was a large, old-fashioned house, built about the middle of
  the preceding century, or perhaps earlier, and had four stories, each
  projecting over the other, till the pile seemed completely to overhang the
  street. The entire front, except the upper story, which was protected by
  oaken planks, was covered with panels of the same timber, and the projections
  were supported by heavy beams, embellished with grotesque carvings. Three
  deeply-embayed windows, having stout wooden bars, filled with minute diamond
  panes, set in leaden frames, were allotted to each floor; while the like
  number of gables, ornamented with curiously-carved coignes, and long-moulded
  leaden spouts, shooting far into the street, finished the roof. A huge sign,
  with the device of Noah's Ark, and the owner's name upon it, hung before the
  door.</p>

  <p>After carefully examining the house, peeping through the chinks in the
  lower shutters, and discovering the grocer seated by the bedside of his son,
  though he could not make out the object of his solicitude, Wyvil decided upon
  attempting an entrance by the backyard. To reach it, a court and a narrow
  alley, leading to an open space surrounded by high walls, had to be
  traversed. Arrived at this spot, Wyvil threw one end of the rope ladder over
  the wall, which was about twelve feet high, and speedily succeeding in
  securing it, mounted, and drawing it up after him, waved his hand to his
  companions, and disappeared on the other side. After waiting for a moment to
  listen, and hearing a window open, they concluded he had gained admittance,
  and turned to depart.</p>

  <p>"And now for Mrs. Disbrowe!" cried Parravicin. "We shall find a coach or a
  chair in Cheapside. Can I take you westward, Lydyard?"</p>

  <p>But the other declined the offer, saying, "I will not desert Wyvil. I feel
  certain he will get into some scrape, and may need me to help him out of it.
  Take care of yourself, Parravicin. Beware of the plague, and of what is worse
  than the plague, an injured husband. Good-night, major."</p>

  <p>"Farewell, sir," returned Pillichody, raising his hat. "A merry watching,
  and a good catching, as the sentinels were wont to say, when I served King
  Charles the First. Sir Paul, I attend you."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch1-4"
     name="ch1-4">IV. &mdash; THE INTERVIEW.</a></h2>

  <p>Maurice Wyvil, as his friends conjectured, had found his way into the
  house. Creeping through the window, and entering a passage, he moved
  noiselessly along till he reached the head of the kitchen stairs, where,
  hearing voices below, and listening to what was said, he soon ascertained
  from the discourse of the speakers, who were no other than old Josyna and
  Patience, that it was not the grocer's daughter, but one of his sons, who was
  attacked by the plague, and that Amabel was in perfect health, though
  confined in her mother's bedroom.</p>

  <p>Overjoyed at the information he had thus acquired, he retired as
  noiselessly as he came, and after searching about for a short time,
  discovered the main staircase, and ascended it on the points of his feet. He
  had scarcely, however, mounted a dozen steps, when a door opened, and Blaize
  crawled along the passage, groaning to himself, and keeping his eyes bent on
  the ground. Seeing he was unnoticed, Wyvil gained the landing, and treading
  softly, placed his ear at every door, until at last the musical accents of
  Amabel convinced him he had hit upon the right one.</p>

  <p>His heart beat so violently that, for a few seconds, he was unable to
  move. Becoming calmer, he tried the door, and finding it locked, rapped with
  his knuckles against it. The grocer's wife demanded who was there. But Wyvil,
  instead of returning an answer, repeated his application. The same demand
  followed, and in a louder key. Still no answer. A third summons, however, so
  alarmed Mrs. Bloundel, that, forgetful of her husband's injunctions, she
  opened the door and looked out; but, as Wyvil had hastily retired into a
  recess, she could see no one.</p>

  <p>Greatly frightened and perplexed, Mrs. Bloundel rushed to the head of the
  stairs, to see whether there was any one below; and as she did so, Wyvil
  slipped into the room, and locked the door. The only object he
  beheld&mdash;for he had eyes for nothing else&mdash;was Amabel, who, seeing
  him, uttered a faint scream. Clasping her in his arms, Wyvil forgot, in the
  delirium of the moment, the jeopardy in which he was placed.</p>

  <p>"Do you know what has happened?" cried Amabel, extricating herself from
  his embrace.</p>

  <p>"I know all," replied her lover; "I would risk a thousand deaths for your
  sake. You must fly with me."</p>

  <p>"Fly!" exclaimed Amabel; "at such a time as this?&mdash;my brother
  dying&mdash;the whole house, perhaps, infected! How can you ask me to fly?
  Why have you come hither? You will destroy me."</p>

  <p>"Not so, sweet Amabel," replied Wyvil, ardently. "I would bear you from
  the reach of this horrible disease. I am come to save you, and will not stir
  without you."</p>

  <p>"What shall I do?" cried Amabel, distractedly. "But I am rightly punished
  for my disobedience and ingratitude to my dear father. Oh! Wyvil, I did not
  deserve this from you."</p>

  <p>"Hear me, Amabel," cried her lover; "I implore your forgiveness. What I
  have done has been from irresistible passion, and from no other cause. You
  promised to meet me to-night. Nay, you half consented to fly with me. I have
  prepared all for it. I came hither burning with impatience for the meeting. I
  received no signal, but encountering your father's apprentice, was informed
  that you were attacked by the plague. Imagine my horror and distress at the
  intelligence. I thought it would have killed me. I determined, however, at
  all risks, to see you once more&mdash;to clasp you in my arms before you
  died&mdash;to die with you, if need be. I accomplished my purpose. I entered
  the house unobserved. I overheard the servants say it was your brother who
  was ill, not you. I also learnt that you were in your mother's room. I found
  the door, and by a fortunate device, obtained admittance. Now you know all,
  and will you not fly with me?"</p>

  <p>"How <i>can</i> I fly?" cried Amabel, gazing wildly round the room, as if
  in search of some place of refuge or escape, and, noticing her little sister,
  Christiana, who was lying asleep in the bed&mdash;"Oh! how I envy that
  innocent!" she murmured.</p>

  <p>"Think of nothing but yourself," rejoined Wyvil, seizing her hand. "If you
  stay here, it will be to perish of the plague. Trust to me, and I will secure
  your flight."</p>

  <p>"I cannot&mdash;I dare not," cried Amabel, resisting him with all her
  force.</p>

  <p>"You <i>must</i> come," cried Wyvil, dragging her along.</p>

  <p>As he spoke, Mrs. Bloundel, who had been down to Blaize's room to
  ascertain what was the matter, returned. Trying the door, and finding it
  fastened, she became greatly alarmed, and called to Amabel to open it
  directly.</p>

  <p>"It is my mother," cried Amabel. "Pity me, Heaven! I shall die with
  shame."</p>

  <p>"Heed her not," replied Wyvil, in a deep whisper; "in her surprise and
  confusion at seeing me, she will not be able to stop us. Do not hesitate.
  There is not a moment to lose."</p>

  <p>"What is the matter, child?" cried Mrs. Bloundel. "Why have you fastened
  the door? Is there any one in the room with you?"</p>

  <p>"She hears us," whispered Amabel. "What shall I do? You must not be
  seen?"</p>

  <p>"There is no use in further concealment," cried Wyvil. "You are mine, and
  twenty mothers should not bar the way."</p>

  <p>"Hold!" cried Amabel, disengaging herself by a sudden effort. "I have gone
  too far&mdash;but not so far as you imagine. I am not utterly lost."</p>

  <p>And before she could be prevented, she rushed to the door, threw it open,
  and flung herself into her mother's arms, who uttered an exclamation of
  terror at beholding Wyvil. The latter, though filled with rage and confusion,
  preserved an unmoved exterior, and folded his arms upon his breast.</p>

  <p>"And so it was you who knocked at the door!" cried Mrs. Bloundel,
  regarding the gallant with a look of fury&mdash;"it was you who contrived to
  delude me into opening it! I do not ask why you have come hither like a thief
  in the night, because I require no information on the subject. You are come
  to dishonour my child&mdash;to carry her away from those who love her and
  cherish her, and would preserve her from such mischievous serpents as you.
  But, Heaven be praised! I have caught you before your wicked design could Be
  effected. Oh! Amabel, my child, my child!" she added, straining her to her
  bosom, "I had rather&mdash;far rather&mdash;see you stricken with the plague,
  like your poor brother, though I felt there was not a hope of your recovery,
  than you should fall into the hands of this Satan!"</p>

  <p>"I have been greatly to blame, dear mother," returned Amabel, bursting
  into tears; "and I shall neither seek to exculpate myself, nor conceal what I
  have done. I have deceived you and my father. I have secretly encouraged the
  addresses of this gentleman. Nay, if the plague had not broken out in our
  house to-night, I should have flown from it with him."</p>

  <p>"You shock me, greatly, child," returned Mrs. Bloundel; "but you relieve
  me at the same time. Make a clean breast, and hide nothing from me."</p>

  <p>"I have nothing more to tell, dear mother," replied Amabel, "except that
  Maurice Wyvil has been in the room ever since you left it, and might,
  perhaps, have carried me off in spite of my resistance, if you had not
  returned when you did."</p>

  <p>"It was, indeed, a providential interference," rejoined Mrs. Bloundel.
  "From what a snare of the evil one&mdash;from what a pitfall have you been
  preserved!"</p>

  <p>"I feel I have had a narrow escape, dear mother," replied Amabel. "Pardon
  me. I do not deserve your forgiveness. But I will never offend you more."</p>

  <p>"I forgive you from my heart, child, and will trust you," returned Mrs.
  Bloundel, in a voice broken by emotion.</p>

  <p>"That is more than I would," thought Maurice Wyvil. "A woman who has once
  deceived those she holds dear, will not fail to do so a second time. The
  fairest promises are forgotten when the danger is past."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Wyvil, if you have a particle of regard for me, you will instantly
  leave the house," said Amabel, turning to him.</p>

  <p>"If had my own way, he should leave it through the window," said Mrs.
  Bloundel; "and if he tarries a minute longer, I will give the alarm."</p>

  <p>"You hear this, sir," cried Amabel:&mdash;"go, I entreat you."</p>

  <p>"I yield to circumstance, Amabel," replied Wyvil; "but think not I resign
  you. Come what will, and however I may be foiled, I will not desist till I
  make you mine."</p>

  <p>"I tremble to hear him," cried Mrs. Bloundel, "and could not have believed
  such depravity existed. Quit the house, sir, directly, or I will have you
  turned out of it."</p>

  <p>"Do not remain another moment," implored Amabel. "Do not, do not!"</p>

  <p>"Since I have no other way of proving my love, I must perforce obey,"
  returned Wyvil, trying to snatch her hand and press it to his lips; but she
  withdrew it, and clung more closely to her mother. "We part," he added,
  significantly, "only for a time."</p>

  <p>Quitting the room, he was about to descend the stairs, when Mrs. Bloundel,
  who had followed to see him safely off the premises, hearing a noise below,
  occasioned by the return of Leonard with the doctor, cautioned him to wait. A
  further delay was caused by Blaize, who, stationing himself at the foot of
  the stairs, with a light in his hand, appeared unwilling to move.
  Apprehensive of a discovery, Mrs. Bloundel then directed the gallant to the
  back staircase, and he had got about halfway down, when he was surprised by
  Leonard Holt, as before related.</p>

  <p>At the very moment that Wyvil was overtaken on the landing by the
  apprentice, Amabel appeared at the door of her chamber with a light. The
  different emotions of each party at this unexpected rencontre may be
  imagined. Leonard Holt, with a breast boiling with jealous rage, prepared to
  attack his rival. He had no weapon about him, having left his cudgel in the
  shop, but he doubled his fists, and, nerved by passion, felt he had the force
  of a Hercules in his arm. Wyvil, in his turn, kept his hand upon his sword,
  and glanced at his mistress, as if seeking instructions how to act. At
  length, Mrs. Bloundel, who formed one of the group, spoke.</p>

  <p>"Leonard Holt," she said, "show this person out at the door. Do not lose
  sight of him for an instant; and, as soon as he is gone, try to find out how
  he entered the house."</p>

  <p>"He entered it like a robber," returned Leonard, looking fiercely at the
  gallant, "and if I did my strict duty, I should seize him and give him in
  charge to the watch. He has come here for the purpose of stealing my master's
  chief valuable&mdash;his daughter."</p>

  <p>"I am aware of it," replied Mrs. Bloundel, "and nothing but consideration
  for my husband prevents my delivering him up to justice. As it is, he may go
  free. But should he return&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If I catch him here again," interrupted Leonard, "I will shoot him as I
  would a dog, though I should be hanged for the deed. Have you considered well
  what you are doing, madam? I would not presume beyond my station, but there
  are seasons when an inferior may give wholesome advice. Are you certain you
  are acting as your worthy husband would, in allowing this person to depart?
  If you have any doubt, speak. Fear nothing. Unarmed as I am, I am a match for
  him, and will detain him."</p>

  <p>"Do not heed what Leonard says, dear mother," interposed Amabel. "For my
  sake, let Mr. Wyvil go."</p>

  <p>"I <i>have</i> considered the matter, Leonard," returned Mrs. Bloundel,
  "and trust I am acting rightly. At all events, I am sure I am sparing my
  husband pain."</p>

  <p>"It is mistaken tenderness," rejoined Leonard, "and Heaven grant you may
  not have cause to repent it. If I had your permission, I would so deal with
  this audacious intruder, that he should never venture to repeat his
  visit."</p>

  <p>"You know that you speak safely, fellow," rejoined Wyvil, "and you,
  therefore, give full license to your scurrile tongue. But a time will come
  when I will chastise your insolence."</p>

  <p>"No more of this," cried Mrs. Bloundel. "Do as I bid you, Leonard; and, as
  you value my regard, say nothing of what has occurred to your master."</p>

  <p>Sullenly acquiescing, the apprentice preceded Wyvil to the shop, and
  opened the door.</p>

  <p>As the other passed through it, he said, "You spoke of chastising me just
  now. If you have courage enough&mdash;which I doubt&mdash;to make good your
  words, and will wait for me for five minutes, near Saint Alban's Church in
  this street, you shall have the opportunity."</p>

  <p>Wyvil did not deign a reply, but wrapping his cloak around him, strode
  away. He had not proceeded far, when it occurred to him that, possibly,
  notwithstanding his interdiction, some of his companions might be waiting for
  him, and hurrying down the passage leading to the yard, he found Lydyard, to
  whom he recounted his ill-success.</p>

  <p>"I shall not, however, abandon my design," he said. "These failures are
  only incentives to further exertion."</p>

  <p>"In the meantime, you must pay your wager to Sedley," laughed Lydyard,
  "and as the house is really infected with the plague, it behoves you to call
  at the first apothecary's shop we find open, and get your apparel fumigated.
  You must not neglect due precautions."</p>

  <p>"True," replied Wyvil, "and as I feel too restless to go home at present,
  suppose we amuse ourselves by calling on some astrologer, to see whether the
  stars are favourable to my pursuit of this girl."</p>

  <p>"A good idea," replied Lydyard. "There are plenty of the 'Sons of Urania,'
  as they term themselves, hereabouts.</p>

  <p>"A mere juggler will not serve my turn," returned Wyvil.</p>

  <p>"William Lilly, the almanack-maker, who predicted the plague, and, if old
  Rowley is to be believed, has great skill in the occult sciences, lives
  somewhere in Friday-street, not a stone's throw from this place. Let us go
  and find him out."</p>

  <p>"Agreed," replied Lydyard.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch1-5"
     name="ch1-5">V. &mdash; THE POMANDER-BOX.</a></h2>

  <p>Any doubts entertained by Leonard Holt as to the manner in which his rival
  entered the house, were removed by discovering the open window in the passage
  and the rope-ladder hanging to the yard-wall. Taking the ladder away, and
  making all as secure as he could, he next seized his cudgel, and proceeded to
  Blaize's room, with the intention of inflicting upon him the punishment he
  had threatened: for he naturally enough attributed to the porter's
  carelessness all the mischief that had just occurred. Not meeting with him,
  however, and concluding he was in the kitchen, he descended thither, and
  found him in such a pitiable plight, that his wrath was instantly changed to
  compassion.</p>

  <p>Stretched upon the hearth before a blazing sea-coal fire, which seemed
  large enough to roast him, with his head resting upon the lap of Patience,
  the pretty kitchen-maid, and his left hand upon his heart, the porter loudly
  complained of a fixed and burning pain in that region; while his mother, who
  was kneeling beside him, having just poured a basin of scalding posset-drink
  down his throat, entreated him to let her examine his side to see whether he
  had any pestilential mark upon it, but he vehemently resisted her
  efforts.</p>

  <p>"Do you feel any swelling, myn lief zoon?" asked old Josyna, trying to
  remove his hand.</p>

  <p>"Swelling!" ejaculated Blaize,&mdash;"there's a tumour as big as an
  egg."</p>

  <p>"Is id possible?" exclaimed Josyna, in great alarm. "Do let me look ad
  id."</p>

  <p>"No, no, leave me alone," rejoined Blaize. "Don't disturb me further. You
  will catch the distemper if you touch the sore."</p>

  <p>"Dat wond hinder me from drying to zaave you," replied his mother,
  affectionately. "I must see vad is de madder vid you, or I cannod cure
  you."</p>

  <p>"I am past your doctoring, mother," groaned Blaize. "Leave me alone, I
  say. You hurt me shockingly!"</p>

  <p>"Poor child!" cried Josyna, soothingly, "I'll be as dender as possible.
  I'll nod give you de leasd pain&mdash;nod de leasd bid."</p>

  <p>"But I tell you, you <i>do</i> give me a great deal," rejoined Blaize. "I
  can't bear it. Your fingers are like iron nails. Keep them away."</p>

  <p>"Bless us! did I ever hear de like of dad!" exclaimed Josyna. "Iron nails!
  if you think so, myn arm zoon, you musd be very ill indeed."</p>

  <p>"I <i>am</i> very ill," groaned her son. "I am not long for this
  world."</p>

  <p>"Oh! don't say so, dear Blaize," sobbed Patience, letting fall a plentiful
  shower of tears on his face. "Don't say so. I can't bear to part with
  you."</p>

  <p>"Then don't survive me," returned Blaize. "But there's little chance of
  your doing so. You are certain to take the plague."</p>

  <p>"I care not what becomes of myself, if I lose you, Blaize," responded
  Patience, bedewing his countenance with another shower; "but I hope you won't
  die yet."</p>

  <p>"Ah! it's all over with me&mdash;all over," rejoined Blaize. "I told
  Leonard Holt how it would be. I said I should be the next victim. And my
  words are come true."</p>

  <p>"You are as clever as a conjurer," sobbed Patience; "but I wish you hadn't
  been right in this instance. However, comfort yourself. I'll die with you.
  We'll be carried to the grave in the same plague-cart."</p>

  <p>"That's cold comfort," returned Blaize, angrily. "I beg you'll never
  mention the plague-cart again. The thought of it makes me shiver all
  over&mdash;oh!" And he uttered a dismal and prolonged groan.</p>

  <p>At this juncture, Leonard thought it time to interfere.</p>

  <p>"If you are really attacked by the plague, Blaize," he said, advancing,
  "you must have instant advice. Doctor Hodges is still upstairs with our
  master. He must see you."</p>

  <p>"On no account," returned the porter, in the greatest alarm, and springing
  to his feet. "I am better&mdash;much better. I don't think I am ill at
  all."</p>

  <p>"For the first time, I suspect the contrary," replied the apprentice,
  "since you are afraid of owning it. But this is not a matter to be trifled
  with. Doctor Hodges will soon settle the point." And he hurried out of the
  room to summon the physician.</p>

  <p>"Oh! mother!&mdash;dear Patience!" roared Blaize, capering about in an
  ecstasy of terror; "don't let the doctor come near me. Keep me out of his
  sight. You don't know what horrid things are done to those afflicted with my
  complaint. But I do,&mdash;for I have informed myself on the subject. Their
  skins are scarified, and their sores blistered, lanced, cauterized, and
  sometimes burned away with a knob of red-hot iron, called 'the button.'"</p>

  <p>"But iv id is necessary, myn goed Blaize, you musd submid," replied his
  mother. "Never mind de hod iron or de lance, or de blisder, iv dey make you
  well. Never mind de pain. It will soon be over."</p>

  <p>"Soon over!" bellowed Blaize, sinking into a chair. "Yes, I feel it will.
  But not in the way you imagine. This Doctor Hodges will kill me. He is fond
  of trying experiments, and will make me his subject. Don't let him&mdash;for
  pity's sake, don't."</p>

  <p>"But I musd, myn lief jonger," replied his mother, "I musd."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Patience!" supplicated Blaize, "you were always fond of me. My mother
  has lost her natural affection. She wishes to get rid of me. Don't take part
  with her. My sole dependence is upon you."</p>

  <p>"I will do all I can for you, dear Blaize," blubbered the kitchen-maid.
  "But it is absolutely necessary you should see the doctor."</p>

  <p>"Then I won't stay here another minute," vociferated Blaize. "I'll die in
  the street rather than under his hands."</p>

  <p>And bursting from them, he would have made good his retreat, but for the
  entrance of Leonard and Hodges.</p>

  <p>At the sight of the latter, Blaize ran back and endeavoured to screen
  himself behind Patience.</p>

  <p>"Is this the sick man?" remarked Hodges, scarcely able to refrain from
  laughing. "I don't think he can be in such imminent danger as you led me to
  suppose."</p>

  <p>"No, I am better&mdash;much better, thank you," returned Blaize, still
  keeping Patience between him and the doctor. "The very sight of you has
  frightened away the plague."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" exclaimed Hodges, smiling, "then it is the most marvellous cure
  I ever yet effected. But, come forward, young man, and let us see what is the
  matter with you."</p>

  <p>"You neither lance nor cauterize an incipient tumour, do you, doctor?"
  demanded Blaize, without abandoning his position.</p>

  <p>"Eh, day!" exclaimed Hodges, "have we one of the faculty here? I see how
  it is, friend. You have been reading some silly book about the disease, and
  have frightened yourself into the belief that you have some of its symptoms.
  I hope you haven't been doctoring yourself, likewise. What have you
  taken?"</p>

  <p>"It would be difficult to say what he has <i>not</i> taken," remarked
  Leonard. "His stomach must be like an apothecary's shop."</p>

  <p>"I have only used proper precautions," rejoined Blaize, testily.</p>

  <p>"And what may those be&mdash;eh?" inquired the doctor. "I am curious to
  learn."</p>

  <p>"Come from behind Patience," cried Leonard, "and don't act the fool
  longer, or I will see whether your disorder will not yield to a sound
  application of the cudgel."</p>

  <p>"Don't rate him thus, good Master Leonard," interposed Patience. "He is
  very ill&mdash;he is, indeed."</p>

  <p>"Then let him have a chance of getting better," returned the apprentice.
  "If he <i>is</i> ill, he has no business near you. Come from behind her,
  Blaize, I say. Now speak," he added, as the porter crept tremblingly forth,
  "and let us hear what nostrums you have swallowed. I know you have dosed
  yourself with pills, electuaries, balsams, tinctures, conserves, spirits,
  elixirs, decoctions, and every other remedy, real or imaginary. What else
  have you done?"</p>

  <p>"What Dr. Hodges, I am sure, will approve," replied Blaize, confidently.
  "I have rubbed myself with vinegar, oil of sulphur, extract of tar, and
  spirit of turpentine."</p>

  <p>"What next?" demanded Hodges.</p>

  <p>"I placed saltpetre, brimstone, amber, and juniper upon a chafing-dish to
  fumigate my room," replied Blaize; "but the vapour was so overpowering, I
  could not bear it."</p>

  <p>"I should be surprised if you could," replied the doctor. "Indeed, it is
  astonishing to me, if you have taken half the remedies Leonard says you have,
  and which, taken in this way, are no remedies at all, since they counteract
  each other&mdash;that you are still alive. But let us see what is the matter
  with you. What ails you particularly?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," replied Blaize, trembling; "I am quite well."</p>

  <p>"He complains of a fixed pain near de haard, docdor," interposed his
  mother, "and says he has a large dumour on his side. But he wond let me
  examine id."</p>

  <p>"That's a bad sign," observed Hodges, shaking his head. "I am afraid it's
  not all fancy, as I at first supposed. Have you felt sick of late, young
  man?"</p>

  <p>"Not of late," replied Blaize, becoming as white as ashes; "but I do
  now."</p>

  <p>"Another bad symptom," rejoined the doctor. "Take off your doublet and
  open your shirt."</p>

  <p>"Do as the doctor bids you," said Leonard, seeing that Blaize hesitated,
  "or I apply the cudgel."</p>

  <p>"Ah! bless my life! what's this?" cried Hodges, running his hand down the
  left side of the porter, and meeting with a large lump. "Can it be a
  carbuncle?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's a terrible carbuncle," replied Blaize; "but don't cauterize it,
  doctor."</p>

  <p>"Let me look at it," cried Hodges, "and I shall then know how to
  proceed."</p>

  <p>And as he spoke, he tore open the porter's shirt, and a silver ball, about
  as large as a pigeon's egg, fell to the ground. Leonard picked it up, and
  found it so hot that he could scarcely hold it.</p>

  <p>"Here is the terrible carbuncle," he cried, with a laugh, in which all the
  party, except Blaize, joined.</p>

  <p>"It's my pomander-box," said the latter. "I filled it with a mixture of
  citron-peel, angelica seed, zedoary, yellow saunders, aloes, benzoin,
  camphor, and gum-tragacanth, moistened with spirit of roses; and after
  placing it on the chafing-dish to heat it, hung it by a string round my neck,
  next my dried toad. I suppose, by some means or other, it dropped through my
  doublet, and found its way to my side. I felt a dreadful burning there, and
  that made me fancy I was attacked by the plague."</p>

  <p>"A very satisfactory solution of the mystery," replied the doctor,
  laughing; "and you may think yourself well off with the blister which your
  box has raised. It will be easier to bear than the cataplasm I should have
  given you, had your apprehensions been well founded. As yet, you are free
  from infection, young man; but if you persist in this silly and pernicious
  practice of quacking yourself, you will infallibly bring on some fatal
  disorder&mdash;perhaps the plague itself. If your mother has any regard for
  you she will put all your medicines out of your reach. There are few known
  remedies against this frightful disease; and what few there are, must be
  adopted cautiously. My own specific is sack."</p>

  <p>"Sack!" exclaimed Blaize, in astonishment. "Henceforth, I will drink
  nothing else. I like the remedy amazingly."</p>

  <p>"It must be taken in moderation," said the doctor: "otherwise it is as
  dangerous as too much physic."</p>

  <p>"I have a boddle or doo of de liquor you commend, docdor, in my private
  cupboard," observed Josyna. "Will you dasde id?"</p>

    <p><a id="pic3"

    <p class="caption">Blaize Tasting the Plague Medicines</p>
  </div>


  <p>"With great pleasure," replied Hodges, "and a drop of it will do your son
  no harm."</p>

  <p>The wine was accordingly produced, and the doctor pronounced it excellent,
  desiring that a glass might always be brought him when he visited the
  grocer's house.</p>

  <p>"You may rely upon id, mynheer, as long as my small sdore lasds," replied
  Josyna.</p>

  <p>Blaize, who, in obedience to the doctor's commands, had drained a large
  glass of sack, felt so much inspirited by it, that he ventured, when his
  mother's back was turned, to steal a kiss from Patience, and to whisper in
  her ear, that if he escaped the plague, he would certainly marry her&mdash;an
  assurance that seemed to give her no slight satisfaction. His new-born
  courage, however, was in some degree damped by Leonard, who observed to him
  in an undertone:</p>

  <p>"You have neglected my injunctions, sirrah, and allowed the person I
  warned you of to enter the house. When a fitting season arrives, I will not
  fail to pay off old scores."</p>

  <p>Blaize would have remonstrated, and asked for some explanation, but the
  apprentice instantly left him, and set out upon his errand to the Examiner of
  Health. Accompanied by his mother, who would not even allow him to say
  good-night to Patience, the porter then proceeded to his own room, where the
  old woman, to his infinite regret, carried off his stores of medicine in a
  basket, which she brought with her for that purpose, and locked the door upon
  him.</p>

  <p>"This has escaped her," said Blaize, as soon as she was gone, opening a
  secret drawer in the cupboard. "How fortunate that I kept this reserve. I
  have still a tolerable supply in case of need. Let me examine my stock. First
  of all, there are plague-lozenges, composed of angelica, liquorice, flower of
  sulphur, myrrh, and oil of cinnamon. Secondly, an electuary of bole-armoniac,
  hartshorn-shavings, saffron, and syrup of wood-sorrel. I long to taste it.
  But then it would be running in the doctor's teeth. Thirdly, there is a phial
  labelled <i>Aqua Theriacalis Stillatitia</i>&mdash;in plain English,
  distilled treacle-water. A spoonful of this couldn't hurt me. Fourthly, a
  packet of powders, entitled <i>Manus Christi</i>&mdash;an excellent mixture.
  Fifthly, a small pot of diatesseron, composed of gentian, myrrh, bayberries,
  and round aristolochia. I must just taste it. Never mind the doctor! He does
  not know what agrees with my constitution as well as I do myself. Physic
  comes as naturally to me as mother's milk. Sixthly, there is <i>Aqua
  Epidemica</i>, commonly called the Plague-Water of Matthias&mdash;delicious
  stuff! I will only just sip it. What a fine bitter it has! I'm sure it must
  be very wholesome. Next, for I've lost my count, comes salt of
  vipers&mdash;next, powder of unicorn's horn&mdash;next, oil of scorpions from
  Naples&mdash;next, dragon-water&mdash;all admirable. Then there are cloves of
  garlics&mdash;sovereign fortifiers of the stomach&mdash;and, lastly, there is
  a large box of my favourite rufuses. How many pills have I taken? Only half a
  dozen! Three more may as well go to keep the others company."</p>

  <p>And hastily swallowing them, as if afraid of detection, he carefully shut
  the drawer, and then crept into bed, and, covering himself with blankets,
  endeavoured to compose himself to slumber.</p>

  <p>Doctor Hodges, meantime, returned to the grocer, and acquainted him that
  it was a false alarm, and that the porter was entirely free from
  infection.</p>

  <p>"I am glad to hear it," replied Bloundel; "but I expected as much. Blaize
  is like the shepherd's boy in the fable: he has cried 'wolf' so often, that
  when the danger really arrives, no one will heed him."</p>

  <p>"I must now take my leave, Mr. Bloundel," said Hodges. "I will be with you
  the first thing to-morrow, and have little doubt I shall find your son going
  on well. But you must not merely take care of him, but of yourself, and your
  household. It will be well to set a chafing-dish in the middle of the room,
  and scatter some of these perfumes occasionally upon it!" and producing
  several small packets, he gave them to the grocer. "If you ever smoke a pipe,
  I would advise you to do so now."</p>

  <p>"I never smoke," replied Bloundel, "and hold it as a filthy and
  mischievous habit, which nothing but necessity should induce me to
  practise."</p>

  <p>"It is advisable now," returned Hodges, "and you should neglect no
  precaution. Take my word for it, Mr. Bloundel, the plague is only beginning.
  When the heats of summer arrive, its ravages will be frightful. Heaven only
  knows what will become of us all!"</p>

  <p>"If my poor son is spared, and we escape contagion," returned Bloundel, "I
  will put into execution a scheme which has occurred to me, and which (under
  Providence!) will, I trust, secure my family from further hazard."</p>

  <p>"Ah, indeed! what is that?" inquired Hodges.</p>

  <p>"We must talk of it some other time," returned Bloundel "Good-night,
  doctor, and accept my thanks for your attention. To-morrow, at as early an
  hour as you can make convenient, I shall hope to see you." And with a
  friendly shake of the hand, and a reiteration of advice and good wishes,
  Hodges departed.</p>

  <p>Soon after this the apprentice returned, and by his master's directions,
  placed a chafing-dish in the middle of the room, supplying it with the drugs
  and herbs left by the doctor. About four o'clock, a loud knocking was heard.
  Instantly answering the summons, Leonard found four men at the shop-door, two
  of whom he knew, by red wands they carried, were searchers; while their
  companions appeared to be undertakers, from their sable habits and long black
  cloaks.</p>

  <p>Marching unceremoniously into the shop, the searchers desired to see the
  sick man; and the apprentice then perceived that one of the men in black
  cloaks was the coffin-maker, Chowles. He could not, however, refuse him
  admittance, and led the way to the grocer's chamber. As they entered it,
  Bloundel arose, and placing his finger to his lips in token of silence,
  raised the blankets, and exhibited the blotch, which had greatly increased in
  size, under the arm of his slumbering son. The foremost of the searchers, who
  kept a phial of vinegar to his nose all the time he remained in the room,
  then demanded in a low tone whether there were any other of the household
  infected? The grocer replied in the negative. Upon this, Chowles, whose
  manner showed he was more than half intoxicated, took off his hat, and bowing
  obsequiously to the grocer, said, "Shall I prepare you a coffin, Mr.
  Bloundel?&mdash;you are sure to want one, and had better give the order in
  time, for there is a great demand for such articles just now. If you like, I
  will call with it tomorrow night. I have a plague-cart of my own, and bury
  all my customers."</p>

  <p>"God grant I may not require your services, sir!" replied the grocer,
  shuddering. "But I will give you timely notice."</p>

  <p>"If you are in want of a nurse, I can recommend an experienced one," added
  Chowles. "Her last employer is just dead."</p>

  <p>"I may need assistance," replied the grocer, after a moment's reflection.
  "Let her call to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"She understands her business perfectly, and will save you a world of
  trouble," replied Chowles; "besides securing me the sale of another coffin,"
  he added to himself.</p>

  <p>He then quitted the room with the searchers, and Leonard felt
  inexpressibly relieved by their departure.</p>

  <p>As soon as the party gained the street, the fourth person, who was
  provided with materials for the task, painted a red cross of the prescribed
  size&mdash;namely, a foot in length&mdash;in the middle of the door; tracing
  above it, in large characters, the melancholy formula&mdash;"LORD, HAVE MERCY
  UPON US!"</p>

  <h2><a id="ch1-6"
     name="ch1-6">VI. &mdash; THE LIBERTINE PUNISHED.</a></h2>

  <p>Sir Paul Parravicin and Major Pillichody arrived without any particular
  adventure at the top of the Haymarket, where the former dismissed the coach
  he had hired in Cheapside, and they proceeded towards Piccadilly on foot. Up
  to this time the major had been in very high spirits, boasting what he would
  do, in case they encountered Disbrowe, and offering to keep guard outside the
  door while the knight remained in the house. But he now began to alter his
  tone, and to frame excuses to get away. He had noticed with some uneasiness,
  that another coach stopped lower down the Haymarket, at precisely the same
  time as their own; and though he could not be quite certain of the fact, he
  fancied he perceived a person greatly resembling Captain Disbrowe alight from
  it. Mentioning the circumstance to his companion, he pointed out a tall
  figure following them at some distance; but the other only laughed at him,
  and said, "It may possibly be Disbrowe&mdash;but what if it is? He cannot get
  into the house without the key; and if he is inclined to measure swords with
  me a second time, he shall not escape so lightly as he did the first."</p>

  <p>"Right, Sir Paul, right," returned Pillichody, "exterminate
  him&mdash;spare him not. By Bellerophon! that's my way. My only apprehension
  is lest he should set upon us unawares. The bravest are not proof against the
  dagger of an assassin."</p>

  <p>"There you wrong Disbrowe, major, I am persuaded," returned Parravicin.
  "He is too much a man of honour to stab a foe behind his back."</p>

  <p>"It may be," replied Pillichody, "but jealousy will sometimes turn a man's
  brain. By the snakes of Tisiphone! I have known an instance of it myself. I
  once made love to a tailor's wife, and the rascal coming in unawares, struck
  me to the ground with his goose, and well nigh murdered me."</p>

  <p>"After such a mischance, I am surprised you should venture to carry on so
  many hazardous intrigues," laughed the knight. "But you proposed just now to
  keep watch outside the house. If it is Disbrowe who is following us, you had
  better do so."</p>

  <p>"Why, Sir Paul&mdash;you see,"&mdash;stammered the major, "I have just
  bethought me of an engagement."</p>

  <p>"An engagement at this hour&mdash;impossible!" cried Parravicin.</p>

  <p>"An assignation, I ought to say," returned Pillichody.</p>

  <p>"Couches of Cytheraea!&mdash;an affair like your own. You would not have
  me keep a lady waiting."</p>

  <p>"It is strange you should not recollect it till this moment," replied
  Parravicin. "But be your inamorata whom she may&mdash;even the rich widow of
  Watling-street, of whom you prate so much&mdash;you must put her off
  to-night."</p>

  <p>"But, Sir Paul&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I will have no denial," replied the knight, peremptorily. If you refuse,
  you will find me worse to deal with than Disbrowe. You must remain at the
  door till I come out. And now let us lose no more time. I am impatient to
  behold the lady."</p>

  <p>"Into what a cursed scrape have I got myself!" thought the major, as he
  walked by the side of his companion, ever and anon casting wistful glances
  over his shoulder. "I am fairly caught on the horns of a dilemma. I
  instinctively feel that Disbrowe <i>is</i> dogging us. What will become of
  me? The moment this harebrained coxcomb enters the house, I will see whether
  a light pair of heels cannot bear me out of harm's way."</p>

  <p>By this time, they had reached a passage known as Bear-alley (all traces
  of which have been swept away by modern improvements), and threading it, they
  entered a narrow thoroughfare, called Castle-street. Just as they turned the
  corner, Pillichody again noticed the figure at the further end of the alley,
  and, but for his fears of the knight, would have instantly scampered off.</p>

  <p>"Are we far from the house?" inquired Parravicin.</p>

  <p>"No," replied the major, scarcely able to conceal his trepidation. "It is
  close at hand&mdash;and so is the lady's husband."</p>

  <p>"So much the better," replied the knight; "it will afford you some
  amusement to beat him off. You may affect not to know him, and may tell him
  the lady's husband is just come home&mdash;her <i>husband</i>!&mdash;do you
  take, Pillichody?"</p>

  <p>"I do&mdash;ha! ha! I do," replied the major, in a quavering tone.</p>

  <p>"But you don't appear to relish the jest," rejoined Parravicin,
  sneeringly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, I relish it exceedingly," replied Pillichody; "her
  husband&mdash;ha!&mdash;ha!&mdash;and Disbrowe is the disappointed
  lover&mdash;capital! But here we are&mdash;and I wish we were anywhere else,"
  he added to himself.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure you are right?" asked Parravicin, searching for the key.</p>

  <p>"Quite sure," returned Pillichody. "Don't you see some one behind that
  wall?"</p>

  <p>"I see nothing," rejoined the knight. "You are afraid of shadows,
  major."</p>

  <p>"Afraid!" ejaculated Pillichody. "Thousand thunders! I am afraid of
  nothing."</p>

  <p>"In that case, I shall expect to find you have slain Disbrowe, on my
  return," rejoined Parravicin, unlocking the door.</p>

  <p>"The night is chilly," observed the major, "and ever since my campaigns in
  the Low Countries, I have been troubled with rheumatism. I should prefer
  keeping guard inside."</p>

  <p>"No, no, you must remain where you are," replied the knight, shutting the
  door.</p>

  <p>Pillichody was about to take to his heels, when he felt himself arrested
  by a powerful arm. He would have roared for aid, but a voice, which he
  instantly recognised, commanded him to keep silence, if he valued his
  life.</p>

  <p>"Is your companion in the house?" demanded Disbrowe, in a hollow tone.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to say he is, Captain Disbrowe," replied the bully. "I did my
  best to prevent him, but remonstrance was in vain."</p>

  <p>"Liar," cried Disbrowe, striking him with his clenched hand. "Do you think
  to impose upon me by such a pitiful fabrication? It was you who introduced me
  to this heartless libertine&mdash;you who encouraged me to play with him,
  telling me I should easily strip him of all he possessed&mdash;you who
  excited his passion for my wife, by praising her beauty&mdash;and it was you
  who put it into his head to propose that fatal stake to me."</p>

  <p>"There you are wrong, Captain Disbrowe," returned Pillichody, in a
  supplicatory tone. "On my soul, you are! I certainly praised your wife (as
  who would not?), but I never advised Parravicin to play for her. That was his
  own idea entirely."</p>

  <p>"The excuse shall not avail you," cried Disbrowe, fiercely. "To you I owe
  all my misery. Draw and defend yourself."</p>

  <p>"Be not so hasty, captain," cried Pillichody, abjectedly. "I have injured
  you sufficiently already. I would not have your blood on my head. On the
  honour of a soldier, I am sorry for the wrong I have done you, and will
  strive to repair it."</p>

  <p>"Repair it!" shrieked Disbrowe. "It is too late." And seizing the major's
  arm, he dragged him by main force into the alley.</p>

  <p>"Help! help!" roared Pillichody. "Would you murder me?"</p>

  <p>"I will assuredly cut your throat, if you keep up this clamour," rejoined
  Disbrowe, snatching the other's long rapier from his side. "Coward!" he
  added, striking him with the flat side of the weapon, "this will teach you to
  mix yourself up in such infamous affairs for the future."</p>

  <p>And heedless of the major's entreaties and vociferations, he continued to
  belabour him, until compelled by fatigue to desist; when the other,
  contriving to extricate himself, ran off as fast as his legs could carry him.
  Disbrowe looked after him for a moment, as if uncertain whether to follow,
  and then hurrying to the house, stationed himself beneath the porch.</p>

  <p>"I will stab him as he comes forth," he muttered, drawing his sword, and
  hiding it beneath his mantle.</p>

  <p>Parravicin, meanwhile, having let himself into the house, marched boldly
  forward, though the passage was buried in darkness, and he was utterly
  unacquainted with it. Feeling against the wall, he presently discovered a
  door, and opening it, entered a room lighted by a small silver lamp placed on
  a marble slab. The room was empty, but its furniture and arrangements
  proclaimed it the favourite retreat of the fair mistress of the abode.
  Parravicin gazed curiously round, as if anxious to gather from what he saw
  some idea of the person he so soon expected to encounter. Everything
  betokened a refined and luxurious taste. A few French romances, the last
  plays of Etherege, Dryden, and Shadwell, a volume of Cowley, and some amorous
  songs, lay on the table; and not far from them were a loomask, pulvil purse,
  a pair of scented gloves, a richly-laced mouchoir, a manteau girdle, palatine
  tags, and a golden bodkin for the hair.</p>

  <p>Examining all these things, and drawing his own conclusions as to the
  character of their owner, Parravicin turned to a couch on which a cittern was
  thrown, while beside it, on a cushion, were a pair of tiny embroidered velvet
  slippers. A pocket-mirror, or sprunking-glass, as it was then termed, lay on
  a side-table, and near it stood an embossed silver chocolate-pot, and a small
  porcelain cup with a golden spoon inside it, showing what the lady's last
  repast had been. On another small table, covered with an exquisitely white
  napkin, stood a flask of wine, a tall-stemmed glass, and a few cakes on a
  China dish, evidently placed there for Disbrowe's return.</p>

  <p>As Parravicin drew near this table, a slip of paper, on which a few lines
  were traced, attracted his attention, and taking it up, he read as
  follows:</p>

  <p>"It is now midnight, and you promised to return early. I have felt your
  absence severely, and have been suffering from a violent headache, which has
  almost distracted me. I have also been troubled with strange and
  unaccountable misgivings respecting you. I am a little easier now, but still
  far from well, and about to retire to rest. At what hour will this meet your
  eye?"</p>

  <p>"MARGARET."</p>

  <p>"Charming creature!" exclaimed Parravicin, as the paper dropped from his
  hand; "she little dreamed, when she wrote it, who would read her billet.
  Disbrowe does not deserve such a treasure. I am sorry she is unwell. I hope
  she has not taken the plague. Pshaw, what could put such an idea into my
  head? Lydyard's warning, I suppose. That fellow, who is the veriest rake
  among us, is always preaching. Confound him! I wish he had not mentioned it.
  A glass of wine may exhilarate me." And pouring out a bumper, he swallowed it
  at a draught. "And so the fond fool is pining for her husband, and has some
  misgivings about him. Egad! it is well for her she does not know what has
  really taken place. She'll learn that soon enough. What's this?" he added,
  glancing at a picture on the wall. "Her miniature! It must be; for it answers
  exactly to Pillichody's description. A sparkling brunette, with raven hair,
  and eyes of night. I am on fire to behold her: but I must proceed with
  prudence, or I may ruin all. Is there nothing of Disbrowe's that I could put
  on for the nonce? 'Fore Heaven! the very thing I want!"</p>

  <p>The exclamation was occasioned by his observing a loose silken robe lying
  across a chair. Wrapping it round him, and throwing down his hat, he took the
  lamp and went up stairs.</p>

  <p>Daring as he was, Parravicin felt his courage desert him, as having found
  the door of Mrs. Disbrowe's chamber, he cautiously opened it. A single glance
  showed him that the room was more exquisitely, more luxuriously furnished
  than that he had just quitted. Articles of feminine attire, of the richest
  kind, were hung against the walls, or disposed on the chairs. On one side
  stood the toilette-table, with its small mirror then in vogue, and all its
  equipage of silver flasks, filligree cassets, japan patch-boxes,
  scent-bottles, and pomatum-pots.</p>

  <p>As he entered the room, a faint voice issuing from behind the rich damask
  curtains of the bed, demanded, "Is it you, Disbrowe?"</p>

  <p>"It is, Margaret," replied Parravicin, setting down the lamp, and speaking
  with a handkerchief at his mouth, to disguise his voice and conceal his
  features.</p>

  <p>"You are late&mdash;very late," she rejoined, "and I have been ill. I
  fancied myself dying."</p>

  <p>"What has been the matter with you sweet, Meg?" asked Parravicin,
  approaching the bed, and seating himself behind the curtains.</p>

  <p>"I know not," she replied. "I was seized with a dreadful headache about an
  hour ago. It has left me; but I have a strange oppression at my chest, and
  breathe with difficulty."</p>

  <p>"You alarm me, my love," rejoined Parravicin. "Were you ever attacked thus
  before?"</p>

  <p>"Never," she replied. "Oh! Disbrowe! if you knew how I have longed for
  your return, you would blame yourself for your absence. You have grown sadly
  neglectful of late. I suspect you love some one else. If I thought
  so&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What if you thought so, Margaret?" demanded Parravicin.</p>

  <p>"What!" cried Mrs. Disbrowe, raising herself in the bed. "I would requite
  your perfidy&mdash;terribly requite it!"</p>

  <p>"Then learn that Captain Disbrowe <i>is</i> faithless," cried Parravicin,
  throwing back the curtains, and disclosing himself. "Learn that he loves
  another, and is with her now. Learn that he cares so little for you, that he
  has surrendered you to me."</p>

  <p>"What do I hear?" exclaimed Mrs. Disbrowe. "Who are you, and what brings
  you here?"</p>

  <p>"You may guess my errand from my presence," replied the knight. "I am
  called Sir Paul Parravicin, and am the most devoted of your admirers."</p>

  <p>"My husband surrender me to a stranger! It cannot be!" cried the lady,
  distractedly.</p>

  <p>"You see me here, and may judge of the truth of my statement," rejoined
  the knight. "Your husband gave me this key, with which I introduced myself to
  the house."</p>

  <p>"What motive could he have for such unheard-of baseness&mdash;such
  barbarity?" cried Mrs. Disbrowe, bursting into tears.</p>

  <p>"Shall I tell you, madam?" replied Parravicin. "He is tired of you, and
  has taken this means of ridding himself of you."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Disbrowe uttered a loud scream, and fell back in the bed. Parravicin
  waited for a moment; but not hearing her move, brought the lamp to see what
  was the matter. She had fainted, and was lying across the pillow, with her
  night-dress partly open, so as to expose her neck and shoulders.</p>

  <p>The knight was at first ravished with her beauty; but his countenance
  suddenly fell, and an expression of horror and alarm took possession of it.
  He appeared rooted to the spot, and instead of attempting to render her any
  assistance, remained with his gaze fixed upon her neck.</p>

  <p>Rousing himself at length, he rushed out of the room, hurried down stairs,
  and without pausing for a moment, threw open the street-door. As he issued
  from it, his throat was forcibly griped, and the point of a sword was placed
  at his breast.</p>

  <p>"You are now in my power, villain," cried Disbrowe, "and shall not escape
  my vengeance."</p>

  <p>"You are already avenged," replied Parravicin, shaking off his assailant.
  "Your wife has the plague."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch1-7"
     name="ch1-7">VII. &mdash; THE PLAGUE NURSE.</a></h2>

  <p>"And so my husband has got the plague," muttered Mother Malmayns, as she
  hastened towards Saint Paul's, after the reproof she had received from Doctor
  Hodges. "Well, it's a disorder that few recover from, and I don't think he
  stands a better chance than his fellows. I've been troubled with him long
  enough. I've borne his ill-usage and savage temper for twenty years, vainly
  hoping something would take him off; but though he tried his constitution
  hard, it was too tough to yield. However, he's likely to go now. If I find
  him better than I expect, I can easily make all sure. That's one good thing
  about the plague. You may get rid of a patient without any one being the
  wiser. A wrong mixture&mdash;a pillow removed&mdash;a moment's chill during
  the fever&mdash;a glass of cold water&mdash;the slightest thing will do it.
  Matthew Malmayns, you will die of the plague, that's certain. But I must be
  careful how I proceed. That cursed doctor has his eye upon me. As luck would
  have it, I've got Sibbald's ointment in my pocket. That is sure to do its
  business&mdash;and safely."</p>

  <p>Thus ruminating, she shaped her course towards the southwest corner of the
  cathedral, and passing under the shrouds and cloisters of the Convocation
  House, raised the latch of a small wooden shed fixed in the angle of a
  buttress. Evidently well acquainted with the place, she was not long in
  finding a lantern and materials to light it, and inserting her fingers in a
  crevice of the masonry, from which the mortar had been removed, she drew
  forth a key.</p>

  <p>"It has not been stirred since I left it here a month ago," she muttered.
  "I must take care of this key, for if Matthew <i>should</i> die, I may not be
  able to enter the vaults of Saint Faith's without it; and as I know all their
  secret places and passages, which nobody else does, except my husband, I can
  make them a storehouse for the plunder I may obtain during the pestilence. If
  it rages for a year, or only half that time, and increases in violence (as
  God grant it may), I will fill every hole in those walls with gold."</p>

  <p>With this, she took up the lantern, and crept along the side of the
  cathedral, until she came to a flight of stone steps. Descending them, she
  unlocked a small but strong door, cased with iron, and fastening it after
  her, proceeded along a narrow stone passage, which brought her to another
  door, opening upon the south aisle of Saint Faith's.</p>

  <p>Pausing for a moment to listen whether any one was within the sacred
  structure&mdash;for such was the dead and awful silence of the place, that
  the slightest whisper or footfall, even at its farthest extremity, could be
  distinguished&mdash;she crossed to the other side, glancing fearfully around
  her as she threaded the ranks of pillars, whose heavy and embrowned shafts
  her lantern feebly illumined, and entering a recess, took a small stone out
  of the wall, and deposited the chief part of the contents of her pocket
  behind it, after which she carefully replaced the stone. This done, she
  hurried to the charnel, and softly opened the door of the crypt.</p>

  <p>Greatly relieved by the operation he had undergone, the sexton had sunk
  into a slumber, and was, therefore, unconscious of the entrance of his wife,
  who, setting down the lantern, advanced towards the pallet. His mother and
  the young man were still in attendance, and the former, on seeing her
  daughter-in-law, exclaimed, in low but angry accents&mdash;"What brings you
  here, Judith? I suppose you expected to find my son dead. But he will
  disappoint you. Doctor Hodges said he would recover&mdash;did he not
  Kerrich?" she added, appealing to the young man, who nodded acquiescence. "He
  will recover, I tell you."</p>

  <p>"Well, well," replied Judith, in the blandest tone she could assume; "I
  hope he will. And if the doctor says so, I have no doubt of it. I only heard
  of his illness a few minutes ago, and came instantly to nurse him."</p>

  <p>"<i>You</i> nurse him?" cried the old woman; "if you show him any
  affection now, it will be for the first time since your wedding-day."</p>

  <p>"How long has he been unwell?" demanded Judith, with difficulty repressing
  her anger.</p>

  <p>"He was seized the night before last," replied the old woman; "but he
  didn't know what was the matter with him when it began. I saw him just before
  he went to rest, and he complained of a slight illness, but nothing to
  signify. He must have passed a frightful night, for the vergers found him in
  the morning running about Saint Faith's like a madman, and dashing his spades
  and mattocks against the walls and pillars. They secured him, and brought him
  here, and on examination, he proved to have the plague."</p>

  <p>"You surprise me by what you say," replied Judith. "During the last month,
  I have nursed more than a dozen patients, and never knew any of them so
  violent. I must look at his sore."</p>

  <p>"The doctor has just dressed it," observed the old woman.</p>

  <p>"I don't mind that," rejoined Judith, turning down the blanket, and
  examining her husband's shoulder. "You are right," she added, "he is doing as
  well as possible."</p>

  <p>"I suppose I shan't be wanted any more," observed Kerrich, "now you're
  come back to nurse your husband, Mrs. Malmayns? I shall be glad to get home
  to my own bed, for I don't feel well at all."</p>

  <p>"Don't alarm yourself," replied Judith. "There's a bottle of plague
  vinegar for you. Dip a piece of linen in it, and smell at it, and I'll insure
  you against the pestilence."</p>

  <p>Kerrich took the phial, and departed. But the remedy was of little avail.
  Before daybreak, he was seized with the distemper, and died two days
  afterwards.</p>

  <p>"I hope poor Kerrich hasn't got the plague?" said the old woman, in a
  tremulous tone.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid he has," replied the daughter-in-law, "but I didn't like to
  alarm him."</p>

  <p>"Mercy on us!" cried the other, getting up. "What a dreadful scourge it
  is."</p>

  <p>"You would say so, if you had seen whole families swept off by it, as I
  have," replied Judith. "But it mostly attacks old persons and children."</p>

  <p>"Lord help us!" cried the crone, "I hope it will spare me. I thought my
  age secured me."</p>

  <p>"Quite the reverse," replied Judith, desirous of exciting her
  mother-in-law's terrors; "quite the reverse. You must take care of
  yourself."</p>

  <p>"But you don't think I'm ill, do you?" asked the other, anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, and let me look at you," returned Judith.</p>

  <p>And the old woman tremblingly obeyed.</p>

  <p>"Well, what do you think of me&mdash;what's the matter?" she asked, as her
  daughter-in-law eyed her for some minutes in silence. "What's the matter, I
  say?"</p>

  <p>But Judith remained silent.</p>

  <p>"I insist upon knowing," continued the old woman.</p>

  <p>"Are you able to bear the truth?" returned her daughter-in-law.</p>

  <p>"You need say no more," groaned the old woman. "I know what the truth must
  be, and will try to bear it. I will get home as fast as I can, and put my few
  affairs in order, so that if I am carried off, I may not go unprepared."</p>

  <p>"You had better do so," replied her daughter-in-law.</p>

  <p>"You will take care of my poor son, Judith," rejoined the old woman,
  shedding a flood of tears. "I would stay with him, if I thought I could do
  him any good; but if I really am infected, I might only be in the way. Don't
  neglect him&mdash;as you hope for mercy hereafter, do not."</p>

  <p>"Make yourself easy, mother," replied Judith. "I will take every care of
  him."</p>

  <p>"Have you no fears of the disorder yourself?" inquired the old woman.</p>

  <p>"None whatever," replied Judith. "I am <i>a safe woman</i>."</p>

  <p>"I do not understand you," replied her mother-in-law, in surprise.</p>

  <p>"I have had the plague," replied Judith; "and those who have had it once,
  never take it a second time."</p>

  <p>This opinion, entertained at the commencement of the pestilence, it may be
  incidentally remarked, was afterwards found to be entirely erroneous; some
  persons being known to have the distemper three or four times.</p>

  <p>"You never let us know you were ill," said the old woman.</p>

  <p>"I could not do so," replied Judith, "and I don't know that I should have
  done if I could. I was nursing two sisters at a small house in Clerkenwell
  Close, and they both died in the night-time, within a few hours of each
  other. The next day, as I was preparing to leave the house, I was seized
  myself, and had scarcely strength to creep up-stairs to bed. An old
  apothecary, named Sibbald, who had brought drugs to the house, attended me,
  and saved my life. In less than a week, I was well again, and able to move
  about, and should have returned home, but the apothecary told me, as I had
  had the distemper once, I might resume my occupation with safety. I did so,
  and have found plenty of employment."</p>

  <p>"No doubt," rejoined the old woman; "and you will find plenty
  more&mdash;plenty more."</p>

  <p>"I hope so," replied the other.</p>

  <p>"Oh! do not give utterance to such a dreadful wish, Judith," rejoined her
  mother-in-law. "Do not let cupidity steel your heart to every better
  feeling."</p>

  <p>A slight derisive smile passed over the harsh features of the
  plague-nurse.</p>

  <p>"You heed me not," pursued the old woman. "But a time will come when you
  will recollect my words."</p>

  <p>"I am content to wait till then," rejoined Judith.</p>

  <p>"Heaven grant you a better frame of mind!" exclaimed the old woman. "I
  must take one last look of my son, for it is not likely I shall see him
  again."</p>

  <p>"Not in this world," thought Judith.</p>

  <p>"I conjure you, by all that is sacred, not to neglect him," said the old
  woman.</p>

  <p>"I have already promised to do so," replied Judith, impatiently.
  "Good-night, mother."</p>

  <p>"It will be a long good-night to me, I fear," returned the dame. "Doctor
  Hodges promised to send some blankets and medicine for poor Matthew. The
  doctor is a charitable man to the poor, and if he learns I am sick, he may,
  perhaps, call and give me advice."</p>

  <p>"I am sure he will," replied Judith. "Should the man bring the blankets, I
  will tell him to acquaint his master with your condition. And now take this
  lantern, mother, and get home as fast as you can."</p>

  <p>So saying, she almost pushed her out of the vault, and closed the door
  after her.</p>

  <p>"At last I am rid of her," she muttered. "She would have been a spy over
  me. I hope I have frightened her into the plague. But if she dies of fear, it
  will answer my purpose as well. And now for my husband."</p>

  <p>Taking up the lamp, and shading it with her hand, she gazed at his ghastly
  countenance.</p>

  <p>"He slumbers tranquilly," she muttered, after contemplating him for some
  time, adding with a chuckling laugh, "it would be a pity to waken him."</p>

  <p>And seating herself on a stool near the pallet, she turned over in her
  mind in what way she could best execute her diabolical purpose.</p>

  <p>While she was thus occupied, the messenger from Doctor Hodges arrived with
  a bundle of blankets and several phials and pots of ointment. The man offered
  to place the blankets on the pallet, but Judith would not let him.</p>

  <p>"I can do it better myself, and without disturbing the poor sufferer," she
  said. "Give my dutiful thanks to your master. Tell him my husband's mother,
  old widow Malmayns, fancies herself attacked by the plague, and if he will be
  kind enough to visit her, she lodges in the upper attic of a baker's house,
  at the sign of the Wheatsheaf, in Little Distaff-lane, hard by."</p>

  <p>"I will not fail to deliver your message to the doctor," replied the man,
  as he took his departure.</p>

  <p>Left alone with her husband a second time, Judith waited till she thought
  the man had got out of the cathedral, and then rising and taking the lamp,
  she repaired to the charnel, to make sure it was untenanted. Not content with
  this, she stole out into Saint Faith's, and gazing round as far as the feeble
  light of her lamp would permit, called out in a tone that even startled
  herself, "Is any one lurking there?" but receiving no other answer than was
  afforded by the deep echoes of the place, she returned to the vault. Just as
  she reached the door, a loud cry burst upon her ear, and rushing forward, she
  found that her husband had wakened.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" roared Malmayns, raising himself in bed, as he perceived her, "are
  you come back again, you she-devil? Where is my mother? Where is Kerrich?
  What have you done with them?"</p>

  <p>"They have both got the plague," replied his wife. "They caught it from
  you. But never mind them. I will watch over you as long as you live."</p>

  <p>"And that will be for years, you accursed jade," replied the sexton; "Dr.
  Hodges says I shall recover."</p>

  <p>"You have got worse since he left you," replied Judith. "Lie down, and let
  me throw these blankets over you."</p>

  <p>"Off!" cried the sick man, furiously. "You shall not approach me. You want
  to smother me."</p>

  <p>"I want to cure you," replied his wife, heaping the blankets upon the
  pallet. "The doctor has sent some ointment for your sore."</p>

  <p>"Then let him apply it himself," cried Malmayns, shaking his fist at her.
  "You shall not touch me. I will strangle you if you come near me."</p>

  <p>"Matthew," replied his wife, "I have had the plague myself, and know how
  to treat it better than any doctor in London. I will cure you, if you will
  let me."</p>

  <p>"I have no faith in you," replied Malmayns, "but I suppose I must submit.
  Take heed what you do to me, for if I have but five minutes to live, it will
  be long enough to revenge myself upon you."</p>

  <p>"I will anoint your sore with this salve," rejoined Judith, producing a
  pot of dark-coloured ointment, and rubbing his shoulder with it. "It was
  given me by Sibbald, the apothecary of Clerkenwell He is a friend of Chowles,
  the coffin-maker. You know Chowles, Matthew?"</p>

  <p>"I know him for as great a rascal as ever breathed," replied her husband,
  gruffly. "He has always cheated me out of my dues, and his coffins are the
  worst I ever put under ground."</p>

  <p>"He is making his fortune now," said Judith.</p>

  <p>"By the plague, eh?" replied Matthew. "I don't envy him. Money so gained
  won't stick to him. He will never prosper."</p>

  <p>"I wish <i>you</i> had his money, Matthew," replied his wife, in a coaxing
  tone.</p>

  <p>"If the plague hadn't attacked me when it did, I should have been richer
  than Chowles will ever be," replied the sexton,&mdash;"nay, I am richer as it
  is."</p>

  <p>"You surprise me," replied Judith, suddenly pausing in her task. "How have
  you obtained your wealth?"</p>

  <p>"I have discovered a treasure," replied, the sexton, with a mocking
  laugh,&mdash;"a secret hoard&mdash;a chest of gold&mdash;ha! ha!"</p>

  <p>"Where&mdash;where?" demanded his wife, eagerly.</p>

  <p>"That's a secret," replied Matthew.</p>

  <p>"I must have it from him before he dies," thought his wife. "Had we better
  not secure it without delay?" she added, aloud. "Some other person may find
  it."</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's safe enough," replied Matthew. "It has remained undiscovered for
  more than a hundred years, and will continue so for a hundred to come, unless
  I bring it forth."</p>

  <p>"But you <i>will</i> bring it forth, won't you?" said Judith.</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly," replied Matthew, "if I get better. But not otherwise. Money
  would be of no use to me in the grave."</p>

  <p>"But it would be of use to <i>me</i>," replied his wife.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it might," replied the sexton; "but if I die, the knowledge of
  the treasure shall die with me."</p>

  <p>"He is deceiving me," thought Judith, beginning to rub his shoulder
  afresh.</p>

  <p>"I suspect you have played me false, you jade," cried Malmayns, writhing
  with pain. "The stuff you have applied burns like caustic, and eats into my
  flesh."</p>

  <p>"It is doing its duty," replied his wife, calmly watching his agonies.
  "You will soon be easier."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I shall&mdash;in death," groaned the sufferer. "I am parched with
  thirst. Give me a glass of water."</p>

  <p>"You shall have wine, Matthew, if you prefer it. I have a flask in my
  pocket," she replied. "But what of the treasure&mdash;where is it?"</p>

  <p>"Peace!" he cried. "I will baulk your avaricious hopes. You shall never
  know where it is."</p>

  <p>"I shall know as much as you do," she rejoined, in a tone of incredulity.
  "I don't believe a word you tell me. You have found no treasure."</p>

  <p>"If this is the last word I shall ever utter, I <i>have</i>," he returned;
  &mdash;"a mighty treasure. But you shall never possess
  it&mdash;never!&mdash;ah! ah!"</p>

  <p>"Nor shall you have the wine," she replied; "there is water for you," she
  added, handing him a jug, which he drained with frantic eagerness. "He is a
  dead man," she muttered.</p>

  <p>"I am chilled to the heart," grasped the sexton, shivering from head to
  foot, while chill damps gathered on his brow. "I have done wrong in drinking
  the water, and you ought not to have given it me."</p>

  <p>"You asked for it," she replied. "You should have had wine but for your
  obstinacy. But I will save you yet, if you will tell me where to find the
  treasure."</p>

  <p>"Look for it in my grave," he returned, with a hideous grin.</p>

  <p>Soon after this, he fell into a sort of stupor. His wife could now have
  easily put a period to his existence, but she still hoped to wrest the secret
  from him. She was assured, moreover, that his recovery was hopeless. At the
  expiration of about two hours, he was aroused by the excruciating anguish of
  his sore. He had again become delirious, and raved as before about coffins,
  corpses, graves, and other loathsome matters. Seeing, from his altered looks
  and the livid and gangrenous appearance which the tumour had assumed, that
  his end was not far off, Judith resolved not to lose a moment, but to try the
  effect of a sudden surprise. Accordingly, she bent down her head, and shouted
  in his ear, "What has become of your treasure, Matthew?"</p>

  <p>The plan succeeded to a miracle. The dying man instantly raised
  himself.</p>

  <p>"My treasure!" he echoed with a yell that made the vault ring again. "Well
  thought on! I have not secured it. They are carrying it off. I must prevent
  them." And throwing off the coverings, he sprang out of bed.</p>

  <p>"I shall have it now," thought his wife. "You are right," she
  added,&mdash;"they are carrying it off. The vergers have discovered it. They
  are digging it up. We must instantly prevent them."</p>

  <p>"We must!" shrieked Malmayns. "Bring the light! bring the light!" And
  bursting open the door, he rushed into the adjoining aisle.</p>

  <p>"He will kill himself, and discover the treasure into the bargain," cried
  Judith, following him. "Ah! what do I see! People in the church. Curses on
  them! they have ruined my hopes."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch1-8"
     name="ch1-8">VIII. &mdash; THE MOSAICAL RODS.</a></h2>

  <p>In pursuance of their design of seeking out an astrologer, Maurice Wyvil
  and Lydyard crossed Cheapside and entered Friday-street. They had not
  proceeded far, when they perceived a watchman standing beneath a porch with a
  lantern in his hand, and thinking it an intimation that the house was
  attacked by the plague, they hurried to the opposite side of the street, and
  called to the watchman to inquire whether he knew where Mr. Lilly lived.</p>

  <p>Ascertaining that the house they sought was only a short distance off,
  they repaired thither, and knocking at the door, a small wicket, protected by
  a grating, was open within it, and a sharp female voice inquired their
  business.</p>

  <p>"Give this to your master, sweetheart," replied Wyvil, slipping a purse
  through the grating; "and tell him that two gentlemen desire to consult
  him."</p>

  <p>"He is engaged just now," replied the woman, in a much softer tone; "but I
  will take your message to him."</p>

  <p>"You have more money than wit," laughed Lydyard. "You should have kept
  back your fee till you had got the information."</p>

  <p>"In that case I should never have received any," replied Wyvil. "I have
  taken the surest means of obtaining admission to the house."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, the door was unbolted by the woman, who proved to be young
  and rather pretty. She had a light in her hand, and directing them to follow
  her, led the way to a sort of anteroom, divided, as it appeared, from a
  larger room by a thick black curtain. Drawing aside the drapery, their
  conductress ushered them into the presence of three individuals, who were
  seated at a table strewn with papers, most of which were covered with
  diagrams and, astrological calculations.</p>

  <p>One of these persons immediately rose on their appearance, and gravely but
  courteously saluted them. He was a tall man, somewhat advanced in life, being
  then about sixty-three, with an aquiline nose, dark eyes, not yet robbed of
  their lustre, grey hair waving over his shoulders, and a pointed beard and
  moustache. The general expression of his countenance was shrewd and
  penetrating, and yet there were certain indications of credulity about it,
  showing that he was as likely to be imposed upon himself as to delude others.
  It is scarcely necessary to say that this way Lilly.</p>

  <p>The person on his right, whose name was John Booker, and who, like
  himself, was a proficient in astrology, was so buried in calculation, that he
  did not raise his eyes from the paper on the approach of the strangers. He
  was a stout man, with homely but thoughtful features, and though not more
  than a year older than Lilly, looked considerably his senior. With the
  exception of a few silver curls hanging down the back of his neck, he was
  completely bald; but his massive and towering brow seemed to indicate the
  possession of no ordinary intellectual qualities. He was a native of
  Manchester, and was born in 1601, of a good family. "His excellent verses
  upon the twelve months," says Lilly, in his autobiography, "framed according
  to the configurations of each month, being blessed with success according to
  his predictions, procured him much reputation all over England. He was a very
  honest man," continues the same authority; "abhorred any deceit in the art he
  studied; had a curious fancy in judging of thefts; and was successful in
  resolving love-questions. He was no mean proficient in astronomy; understood
  much in physic! was a great admirer of the antimonial cup; and not unlearned
  in chemistry, which he loved well, but did not practise." At the period of
  this history, he was clerk to Sir Hugh Hammersley, alderman.</p>

  <p>The third person,&mdash;a minor canon of Saint Paul's, named Thomas
  Quatremain,&mdash;was a grave, sallow-complexioned man, with a morose and
  repulsive physiognomy. He was habited in the cassock of a churchman of the
  period, and his black velvet cap lay beside him on the table. Like Booker, he
  was buried in calculations, and though he looked up for a moment as the
  others entered the room, he instantly resumed his task, without regard to
  their presence.</p>

  <p>After looking earnestly at his visitors for a few moments, and appearing
  to study their features, Lilly motioned them to be seated; but they declined
  the offer.</p>

  <p>"I am not come to take up your time, Mr. Lilly," said Wyvil, "but simply
  to ask your judgment in a matter in which I am much interested."</p>

  <p>"First permit me to return you your purse, sir, since it is from you, I
  presume, that I received it," replied the astrologer. "No information that I
  can give deserves so large a reward as this."</p>

  <p>Wyvil would have remonstrated. But seeing the other resolute, he was fain
  to concede the point.</p>

  <p>"What question do you desire to have resolved, sir?" pursued Lilly.</p>

  <p>"Shall I be fortunate in my hopes?" rejoined Wyvil.</p>

  <p>"You must be a little more precise," returned the astrologer. "To what do
  your hopes relate?&mdash;to wealth, dignity, or love?"</p>

  <p>"To the latter," replied Wyvil.</p>

  <p>"So I inferred from your appearance, sir," rejoined Lilly, smiling. "Venus
  was strong in your nativity, though well-dignified; and I should, therefore,
  say you were not unfrequently entangled in love affairs. Your inamorata, I
  presume, is young, perhaps fair,&mdash;blue-eyed, brown-haired, tall,
  slender, and yet perfectly proportioned."</p>

  <p>"She is all you describe," replied Wyvil.</p>

  <p>"Is she of your own rank?" asked Lilly.</p>

  <p>"Scarcely so," replied Wyvil, hesitating before he answered the
  question.</p>

  <p>"I will instantly erect a scheme," replied the astrologer, rapidly tracing
  a figure on a sheet of paper. "The question refers to the seventh house. I
  shall take Venus as the natural significatrix of the lady. The moon is in
  trine with the lord of the ascendant,&mdash;so far, good; but there is a
  cross aspect from Mars, who darts forth malicious rays upon them. Your suit
  will probably be thwarted. But what Mars bindeth, Venus dissolveth. It is not
  wholly hopeless. I should recommend you to persevere."</p>

  <p>"Juggler!" exclaimed "Wyvil between his teeth.</p>

  <p>"I am no juggler!" replied Lilly, angrily; "and to prove I am not, I will
  tell you who you are who thus insult me, though you have not announced
  yourself, and are desirous of preserving your <i>incognito</i>. You are the
  Earl of Rochester, and your companion is Sir George Etherege."</p>

  <p>"'Fore heaven! we are discovered," cried the earl; "but whether by art,
  magic, or from previous acquaintance with our features, I pretend not to
  determine."</p>

  <p>"In either case, my lord,&mdash;for it is useless, since you have avowed
  yourself, to address you longer as Wyvil," replied Etherege,&mdash;"you owe
  Mr. Lilly an apology for the insult you have offered him. It was as
  undeserved as uncalled for; for he described your position with Amabel
  exactly."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry for what I said," replied the earl, with great frankness, "and
  entreat Mr. Lilly to overlook it, and impute it to its real
  cause,&mdash;disappointment at his judgment."</p>

  <p>"I wish I could give you better hopes, my lord," replied Lilly; "but I
  readily accept your apology. Have you any further questions to ask me?"</p>

  <p>"Not to-night," replied the earl; "except that I would gladly learn
  whether it is your opinion that the plague will extend its ravages?"</p>

  <p>"It will extend them so far, my lord, that there shall neither be buriers
  for the dead, nor sound to look after the sick," replied Lilly. "You may have
  seen a little tract of mine published in 1651,&mdash;some fourteen years
  ago,&mdash;called '<i>Monarchy or No Monarchy in England</i>,' in which, by
  an hieroglyphic, I foretold this terrible calamity."</p>

  <p>"I heard his majesty speak of the book no later than yesterday," replied
  Rochester. "He has the highest opinion of your skill, Mr. Lilly, as he cannot
  blind himself to the fact that you foretold his father's death. But this is
  not the only visitation with which you threaten our devoted city."</p>

  <p>"It is threatened by Heaven, not by me, my lord," replied Lilly. "London
  will be devoured by plague and consumed by fire."</p>

  <p>"In our time?" asked Etherege.</p>

  <p>"Before two years have passed over our heads," returned the astrologer.
  "The pestilence originated in the conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in
  Sagittarius, on the 10th of last October, and the conjunction of Saturn and
  Mars in the same sign, on the 12th of November. It was harbingered also by
  the terrible comet of January, which appeared in a cadent and obscure house,
  denoting sickness and death: and another and yet more terrible comet, which
  will be found in the fiery triplicity of Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius, will be
  seen before the conflagration."</p>

  <p>"My calculations are, that the plague will be at its worst in August and
  September, and will not cease entirely till the beginning of December,"
  observed Booker, laying aside his pen.</p>

  <p>"And I doubt not you are right, sir," said Lilly, "for your calculations
  are ever most exact."</p>

  <p>"My labour is not thrown away, Mr. Lilly," cried Quatremain, who had
  finished his task at the same time. "I have discovered what I have long
  suspected, that treasure <i>is</i> hidden in Saint Paul's Cathedral. Mercury
  is posited in the north angle of the fourth house; the dragon's tail is
  likewise within it; and as Sol is the significator, it must be gold."</p>

  <p>"True," replied Lilly.</p>

  <p>"Furthermore," proceeded Quatremain, "as the sign is earthy, the treasure
  must be buried in the vaults."</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly," replied Booker.</p>

  <p>"I am all impatience to search for it," said Quatremain. "Let us go there
  at once, and make trial of the mosaical rods."</p>

  <p>"With all my heart," replied Lilly. "My lord," he added to Rochester, "I
  must pray you to excuse me. You have heard what claims my attention."</p>

  <p>"I have," returned the earl, "and should like to accompany you in the
  quest, if you will permit me."</p>

  <p>"You must address yourself to Mr. Quatremain," rejoined Lilly. "If he
  consents, I can make no objection."</p>

  <p>The minor canon, on being appealed to, signified his acquiescence, and
  after some slight preparation, Lilly produced two hazel rods, and the party
  set out.</p>

  <p>A few minutes' walking brought them to the northern entrance of the
  cathedral, where they speedily aroused the poor verger, who began to fancy he
  was to have no rest that night. On learning their purpose, however, he
  displayed the utmost alacrity, and by Quatremain's directions went in search
  of his brother-verger, and a mason, who, being employed at the time in making
  repairs in the chantries, lodged within the cathedral.</p>

  <p>This occasioned a delay of a few minutes, during which Rochester and
  Etherege had an opportunity, like that enjoyed a short time before by Leonard
  Holt, of beholding the magnificent effect of the columned aisles by
  moonlight. By this time the other verger, who was a young and active man, and
  the mason, arrived, and mattocks, spades, and an iron bar being procured, and
  a couple of torches lighted, they descended to Saint Faith's.</p>

  <p>Nothing more picturesque can be conceived than the effect of the
  torchlight on the massive pillars and low-browed roof of the subterranean
  church. Nor were the figures inappropriate to the scene. Lilly, with the
  mosaical rods in his hand, which he held at a short distance from the floor,
  moving first to one point, then to another; now lingering within the gloomy
  nave, now within the gloomier aisles; the grave minor canon, who kept close
  beside him, and watched his movements with the most intense anxiety; Booker,
  with his venerable head uncovered, and his bald brow reflecting the gleam of
  the torches; the two court gallants in their rich attire; and the vergers and
  their comrade, armed with the implements for digging;&mdash;all constituted a
  striking picture. And as Rochester stepped aside to gaze at it, he thought he
  had never beheld a more singular scene.</p>

  <p>Hitherto, no success had attended the searchers. The mosaical rods had
  continued motionless. At length, however, Lilly reached a part of the wall
  where a door appeared to have been stopped up, and playing the rods near it,
  they turned one over the other.</p>

  <p>"The treasure is here!" he exclaimed. "It is hidden beneath this
  flag."</p>

  <p>Instantly, all were in action. Quatremain called to his assistants to
  bring their mattocks and the iron bar. Rochester ran up and tendered his aid;
  Etherege did the same; and in a few moments the flag was forced from its
  position.</p>

  <p>On examination, it seemed as if the ground beneath it had been recently
  disturbed, though it was carefully trodden down. But without stopping to
  investigate the matter, the mason and the younger verger commenced digging.
  When they were tired, Lilly and Quatremain took their places, and in less
  than an hour they had got to the depth of upwards of four feet. Still nothing
  had been found, and Lilly was just about to relinquish his spade to the
  mason, when, plunging it more deeply into the ground, it struck against some
  hard substance.</p>

  <p>"It is here&mdash;we have it!" he cried, renewing his exertions.</p>

  <p>Seconded by Quatremain, they soon cleared off the soil, and came to what
  appeared to be a coffin or a large chest. Both then got out of the pit to
  consider how they should remove the chest; the whole party were discussing
  the matter, when a tremendous crash, succeeded by a terrific yell, was heard
  at the other end of the church, and a ghastly and half-naked figure, looking
  like a corpse broken from the tomb, rushed forward with lightning swiftness,
  and shrieking&mdash;"My treasure!&mdash;my treasure!&mdash;you shall not have
  it!"&mdash;thrust aside the group, and plunged into the excavation.</p>

  <p>When the bystanders recovered sufficient courage to drag the unfortunate
  sexton out of the pit, they found him quite dead.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch1-9"
     name="ch1-9">IX. &mdash; THE MINIATURE.</a></h2>

  <p>According to his promise, Doctor Hodges visited the grocer's house early
  on the following day, and the favourable opinion he had expressed respecting
  Stephen Bloundel was confirmed by the youth's appearance. The pustule had
  greatly increased in size; but this the doctor looked upon as a good sign:
  and after applying fresh poultices, and administering a hot posset-drink, he
  covered the patient with blankets, and recommending as much tranquillity as
  possible, he proceeded, at Bloundel's request, to ascertain the state of
  health of the rest of the family. Satisfied that all the household (including
  Blaize, who, being a little out of order from the quantity of medicine he had
  swallowed, kept his bed) were uninfected, he went upstairs, and finding the
  two boys quite well, and playing with their little sister Christiana, in the
  happy unconsciousness of childhood, he tapped at the door of Mrs. Bloundel's
  chamber, and was instantly admitted. Amabel did not raise her eyes at his
  entrance, but continued the employment on which she was engaged. Her mother,
  however, overwhelmed him with inquiries as to the sufferer, and entreated him
  to prevail upon her husband to let her take his place at the sick bed.</p>

  <p>"I cannot accede to your request, madam," replied Hodges; "because I think
  the present arrangement the best that could be adopted."</p>

  <p>"And am I not to see poor Stephen again?" cried Mrs. Bloundel, bursting
  into tears.</p>

  <p>"I hope you will soon see him again, and not lose sight of him for many
  years to come," replied the doctor. "As far as I can judge, the danger is
  over, and, aided by your husband's care and watchfulness, I have little doubt
  of bringing the youth round."</p>

  <p>"You reconcile me to the deprivation, doctor," rejoined Mrs. Bloundel;
  "but can you insure my husband against the distemper?"</p>

  <p>"I can insure no one against contagion," replied Hodges; "but there is
  much in his favour. He has no fear, and takes every needful precaution. You
  must hope for the best. I think it right to tell you, that you will be
  separated from him for a month."</p>

  <p>"Separated from my husband for a month, doctor!" cried Mrs. Bloundel. "I
  must see him to-day. I have something of importance to say to him."</p>

  <p>At this point of the conversation Amabel for the first time looked up. Her
  eyes were red and inflamed with weeping, and her looks betrayed great
  internal suffering.</p>

  <p>"You cannot see my father, mother," she said in a broken and supplicatory
  tone.</p>

  <p>"But she can write to him, or send a message by me," rejoined Hodges. "I
  will deliver it when I go downstairs."</p>

  <p>"What my mother has to say cannot be confided to a third party, sir,"
  returned Amabel.</p>

  <p>"Better defer it, then," said the doctor, who, as he looked hard at her,
  and saw the colour mount to her cheeks, began to suspect something of the
  truth. "Whatever you have to say, Mrs. Bloundel, may be very well delayed;
  for the house is now closed, with a watchman at the door, and will continue
  so for a month to come. No one can quit it, except members of our profession,
  searchers, nurses, and other authorized persons, during that time."</p>

  <p>"But can no one enter it, do you think?" asked Mrs. Bloundel.</p>

  <p>"No one would desire to do so, I should conceive, except a lover," replied
  Hodges, with a sly look at Amabel, who instantly averted her gaze. "Where a
  pretty girl is concerned, the plague itself has no terrors."</p>

  <p>"Precisely my opinion, doctor," rejoined Mrs. Bloundel; "and as I cannot
  consult my husband, perhaps you will favour me with your advice as to how I
  ought to act, if such a person as you describe should get into the
  house."</p>

  <p>"I seldom meddle with family matters," rejoined Hodges; "but I feel so
  much interest in all that relates to Mr. Bloundel, that I am induced to
  depart from my rule on the present occasion. It is evident you have lost your
  heart," he added, to Amabel, whose blushes told him he was right; "but not, I
  hope, to one of those worthless court-gallants, who, as I learn from common
  report, are in the habit of toasting you daily. If it is so, you must subdue
  your passion; for it cannot lead to good. Be not dazzled by a brilliant
  exterior, which often conceals a treacherous heart; but try to fix your
  affections on some person of little pretension, but of solid worth. Never, I
  grieve to say, was there a season when such universal profligacy prevailed as
  at present. Never was it so necessary for a young maiden, possessed of beauty
  like yours, to act with discretion. Never was a court so licentious as that
  of our sovereign, Charles the Second, whose corrupt example is imitated by
  every one around him, while its baneful influence extends to all classes.
  Were I to echo the language of the preachers, I should say it was owing to
  the wickedness and immorality of the times that this dreadful judgment of the
  plague has been inflicted upon us; but I merely bring it forward as an
  argument to prove to you, Amabel, that if you would escape the moral
  contagion by which you are threatened, you must put the strictest guard upon
  your conduct."</p>

  <p>Amabel faintly murmured her thanks.</p>

  <p>"You speak as my husband himself would have spoken," said Mrs. Bloundel.
  "Ah! we little thought, when we prayed that the pestilence might be averted
  from us, that a worse calamity was behind, and that one of the most
  profligate of the courtiers you have mentioned would find his way to our
  house."</p>

  <p>"One of the most profligate of them?" cried Hodges. "Who, in Heaven's
  name?"</p>

  <p>"He calls himself Maurice Wyvil," replied Mrs. Bloundel.</p>

  <p>"I never heard of such a person," rejoined the doctor. "It must be an
  assumed name. Have you no letter or token that might lead to his discovery?"
  he added, turning to Amabel.</p>

  <p>"I have his portrait," she replied, drawing a small miniature from her
  bosom.</p>

  <p>"I am glad I have seen this," said the doctor, slightly starting as he
  cast his eyes upon it. "I hope it is not too late to save you, Amabel," he
  added, in a severe tone. "I hope you are free from contamination?"</p>

  <p>"As I live, I am," she replied. "But you recognise the likeness?"</p>

  <p>"I do," returned Hodges. "It is the portrait of one whose vices and
  depravity are the town's cry, and whose name coupled with that of a woman, is
  sufficient to sully her reputation."</p>

  <p>"It is the Earl of Rochester," said Mrs. Bloundel.</p>

  <p>"You have guessed aright," replied the doctor; "it is."</p>

  <p>Uttering an exclamation of surprise and terror, Amabel fell back in her
  chair.</p>

  <p>"I thought it must be that wicked nobleman," cried Mrs. Bloundel. "Would
  you believe it, doctor, that he forced himself into the house&mdash;nay, into
  this room&mdash;last night, and would have carried off my daughter, in spite
  of her resistance, if I had not prevented him."</p>

  <p>"I can believe anything of him," replied Hodges. "But your husband, of
  course, knows nothing of the matter?"</p>

  <p>"Not as yet," replied Mrs. Bloundel; "but I authorize you to tell him
  all."</p>

  <p>"Mother, dear mother," cried Amabel, flinging herself on her knees before
  her, "I implore you not to add to my father's present distress. I might not
  have been able to conquer my attachment to Maurice Wyvil, but now that I find
  he is the Earl of Rochester, I regard him with abhorrence."</p>

  <p>"If I could believe you sincere," said Mrs. Bloundel, "I might be induced
  to spare your father the pain which the knowledge of this unfortunate affair
  would necessarily inflict."</p>

  <p>"I am sincere,&mdash;indeed I am," replied Amabel.</p>

  <p>"To prove that the earl could not have had honourable intentions towards
  you, Amabel," said the doctor, "I may mention that he is at this moment
  urging his suit with Mistress Mallet,&mdash;a young heiress."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" exclaimed Amabel."</p>

  <p>"I was in attendance upon Mistress Stewart, the king's present favourite,
  the day before yesterday," continued Hodges, "and heard his majesty entreat
  her to use her influence with Mistress Mallet in Rochester's behalf. After
  this, you cannot doubt the nature of his intentions towards yourself."</p>

  <p>"I cannot&mdash;I cannot," rejoined Amabel. "He is perfidy itself. But is
  Mistress Mallet very beautiful, doctor?"</p>

  <p>"Very beautiful, and very rich," he replied, "and the earl is desperately
  in love with her. I heard him declare laughingly to the king, that if she
  would not consent to marry him, he would carry her off."</p>

  <p>"Just what he said to me," exclaimed Amabel&mdash;"perjured and faithless
  that he is!"</p>

  <p>"Harp on that string, doctor," whispered Mrs. Bloundel. "You understand
  her feelings exactly."</p>

  <p>"Strangely enough," pursued the doctor, who, having carefully examined the
  miniature, had opened the back of the case, and could not repress a smile at
  what he beheld&mdash;"strangely enough, this very picture will convince you
  of the earl's inconstancy. It was evidently designed for Mistress Mallet,
  and, as she would not accept it, transferred to you."</p>

  <p>"How do you know this, sir?" inquired Amabel, in a mortified tone.</p>

  <p>"Hear what is written within it," answered Hodges, laying the open case
  before her, and reading as follows: "'To the sole possessor of his heart, the
  fair Mistress Mallet, this portrait is offered by her devoted
  slave&mdash;ROCHESTER.' 'The <i>sole</i> possessor of his heart!' So you have
  no share in it, you perceive, Amabel. 'Her devoted slave!' Is he your slave
  likewise? Ha! ha!"</p>

  <p>"It <i>is</i> his writing," cried Amabel. "This note," she added,
  producing a billet, "is in the same hand. My eyes are indeed open to his
  treachery."</p>

  <p>"I am glad to hear it," replied Hodges, "and if I can preserve you from
  the snares of this noble libertine, I shall rejoice as much as in curing your
  brother of the plague. But can you rely upon yourself, in case the earl
  should make another attempt to see you?"</p>

  <p>"I can," she averred confidently.</p>

  <p>"In that case there is nothing to apprehend," rejoined Hodges; "and I
  think it better on many accounts not to mention the subject to your father.
  It would only distract his mind, and prevent him from duly discharging the
  painful task he has undertaken. Were I in your place, Amabel, I would not
  only forget my present perfidious lover, but would instantly bestow my
  affections on some worthy person."</p>

  <p>"It would gladden me if she would do so," said Mrs. Bloundel.</p>

  <p>"There is your father's apprentice, Leonard Holt, a good-looking,
  well-grown lad," pursued the doctor; "and I much mistake if he is insensible
  to your attractions."</p>

  <p>"I am sure he loves her dearly, doctor," replied Mrs. Bloundel. "He is as
  well-principled as well-looking. I have never had a fault to find with him
  since he came to live with us. It will rejoice me, and I am sure would not
  displease my husband, to see our child united to Leonard Holt."</p>

  <p>"Well, what say you, Amabel?" asked Hodges. "Can you give him a hope?"</p>

  <p>"Alas, no!" replied Amabel; "I have been deceived once, but I will not be
  deceived a second time. I will never wed."</p>

  <p>"So every woman says after her first disappointment," observed Hodges;
  "but not one in ten adheres to the resolution. When you become calmer, I
  would recommend you to think seriously of Leonard Holt."</p>

  <p>At this moment, a tap was heard at the door, and opening it, the doctor
  beheld the person in question.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter?" cried Hodges. "I hope nothing is amiss."</p>

  <p>"Nothing whatever," replied Leonard, "but my master wishes to see you
  before you leave the house."</p>

  <p>"I will go to him at once," replied the doctor. "Good day, Mrs. Bloundel.
  Take care of your daughter, and I hope she will take care of herself. We have
  been talking about you, young man," he added in a low tone to the apprentice,
  "and I have recommended you as a husband to Amabel."</p>

  <p>"There was a time, sir," rejoined Leonard, in a tone of deep emotion,
  "when I hoped it might be so, but that time is past."</p>

  <p>"No such thing," replied the doctor. "Now is the time to make an
  impression. Her heart is on the rebound. She is satisfied of her lover's
  treachery. Her mother is on your side. Do not neglect the present
  opportunity, for another may not arrive." With this he pushed Leonard into
  the room, and, shutting the door upon him, hurried downstairs.</p>

  <p>"You have arrived at a seasonable juncture, Leonard," observed Mrs.
  Bloundel, noticing the apprentice's perplexity, and anxious to relieve it.
  "We have just discovered that the person calling himself Maurice Wyvil is no
  other than the Earl of Rochester."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" exclaimed Leonard.</p>

  <p>"Yes, indeed," returned Mrs. Bloundel. "But this is not all. Amabel has
  promised to forget him, and I have urged her to think of you."</p>

  <p>"Amabel," said Leonard, advancing towards her, and taking her hand, "I can
  scarcely credit what I hear. Will you confirm your mother's words?"</p>

  <p>"Leonard," returned Amabel, "I am not insensible to your good qualities,
  and no one can more truly esteem you than I do. Nay, till I unfortunately saw
  the Earl of Rochester, whom I knew not as such, I might have loved you. But
  now I cannot call my heart my own. I have not the affection you deserve to
  bestow upon you. If I can obliterate this treacherous man's image from my
  memory&mdash;and Heaven, I trust, will give me strength to do so&mdash;I will
  strive to replace it with your own."</p>

  <p>"That is all I ask," cried Leonard, dropping on his knee before her, and
  pressing his lips to her hand.</p>

  <p>"Nothing would make me happier than to see you united, my children," said
  Mrs. Bloundel, bending affectionately over them.</p>

  <p>"And I would do anything to make you happy, dear mother," replied Amabel,
  gently withdrawing her hand, from that of the apprentice.</p>

  <p>"Before I leave you," said Leonard, rising, "I must give you this note. I
  found it lying before your chamber door as I passed this morning. How it came
  there I know not, but I can give a shrewd guess as to the writer. I ought to
  tell you, that but for what has just occurred, I should not have delivered it
  to you."</p>

  <p>"It is from Wyvil&mdash;I mean Rochester," said Amabel, taking the note
  with a trembling hand.</p>

  <p>"Let me see it, child," cried Mrs. Bloundel, snatching it from her, and
  breaking the seal. "Insolent!" she exclaimed, as she cast her eyes over it.
  "I can scarcely contain my indignation. But let him cross my path again, and
  he shall find whether I cannot resent such shameful usage."</p>

  <p>"What does he say, dear mother ?" asked Amabel.</p>

  <p>"You shall hear," replied Mrs. Bloundel, "though I blush to repeat his
  words: 'Amabel, you are mine. No one shall keep you from me. Love like mine
  will triumph over all obstacles!'&mdash;Love like his, forsooth!" she
  remarked; "let him keep such stuff as that for Mistress Mallet, or his other
  mistresses. But I will go on: 'I may be foiled ninety-nine times, but the
  hundredth will succeed. We shall soon meet again. 'MAURICE WYVIL.'"</p>

  <p>"Never!" cried Amabel. "We will never meet again. If he holds me thus
  cheaply, I will let him see that he is mistaken. Leonard Holt, I have told
  you the exact state of my feelings. I do not love you now, but I regard you
  as a true friend, and love may come hereafter. If in a month's time you claim
  my hand; if my father consents to our union, for you are aware that my mother
  will not oppose it&mdash;I am yours."</p>

  <p>Leonard attempted to speak, but his voice was choked with emotion, and the
  tears started to his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Farewell," said Amabel. "Do not let us meet till the appointed time. Rest
  assured, I will think of you as you deserve."</p>

  <p>"We could not meet till that time, even if you desired it," said Leonard,
  "for your father has forbidden any of the household, except old Josyna, to
  approach you till all fear of contagion is at an end, and I am now
  transgressing his commands. But your mother, I am sure, will acquit me of
  intentional disobedience."</p>

  <p>"I do," replied Mrs. Bloundel; "it was the doctor who forced you into the
  room. But I am heartily glad he did so."</p>

  <p>"Farewell, Amabel," said Leonard. "Though I shall not see you, I will
  watch carefully over you." And gazing at her with unutterable affection, he
  quitted the chamber.</p>

  <p>"You must now choose between the heartless and depraved nobleman, who
  would desert you as soon as won," observed Mrs. Bloundel, "and the honest
  apprentice, whose life would be devoted to your happiness."</p>

  <p>"I <i>have</i> chosen," replied her daughter.</p>

  <p>Doctor Hodges found the grocer writing at a small table, close to the
  bedside of his son.</p>

  <p>"I am happy to tell you, Mr. Bloundel," he said, in a low tone, as he
  entered the room, "that all your family are still free from infection, and
  with due care will, I hope, continue so. But I entirely approve of your
  resolution of keeping apart from them till the month has expired. If your son
  goes on as he is doing now, he will be as strong as ever in less than a
  fortnight. Still, as we cannot foresee what may occur, it is better to err on
  the cautious side."</p>

  <p>"Pray be seated for a moment," rejoined the grocer, motioning the other to
  the chair. "I mentioned to you last night that in case my son recovered, I
  had a plan which I trusted (under Providence!) would preserve my family from
  the further assaults of the pestilence."</p>

  <p>"I remember your alluding to it," replied Hodges, "and should be glad to
  know what it is."</p>

  <p>"I must tell it you in confidence," rejoined Bloundel, "because I think
  secresy essential to its entire accomplishment. My plan is a very simple one,
  and only requires firmness in its execution&mdash;and that quality, I think,
  I possess. It is your opinion, I know, as it is my own, that the plague will
  increase in violence and endure for months&mdash;probably, till next winter.
  My intention is to store my house with provisions, as a ship is victualled
  for a long voyage, and then to shut it up entirely till the scourge
  ceases."</p>

  <p>"If your project is practicable," said Hodges, after a moment's
  reflection, "I have no doubt it will be attended, with every good result you
  can desire. This house, which is large and roomy, is well adapted for your
  purpose. But you must consider well whether your family will submit to be
  imprisoned during the long period you propose."</p>

  <p>"They shall remain close prisoners, even if the pestilence lasts for a
  twelvemonth," replied the grocer. "Whoever quits the house, when it is once
  closed, and on whatever plea, be it wife, son, or daughter, returns not. That
  is my fixed resolve."</p>

  <p>"And you are right," rejoined Hodges, "for on that determination the
  success of your scheme entirely depends."</p>

  <p>While they were thus conversing, Leonard entered the chamber, and informed
  his master that Chowles, the coffin-maker, and Mrs. Malmayns, the
  plague-nurse, desired to see him.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Malmayns!" exclaimed Hodges, in surprise. "I heard that something
  very extraordinary occurred last night in Saint Faith's. With your
  permission, Mr. Bloundel, she shall be admitted; I want to ask her a few
  questions. You had better hesitate about engaging her," he observed to the
  grocer, as Leonard departed, "for she is a woman of very indifferent
  character, though she may (for aught I know) be a good and fearless
  nurse."</p>

  <p>"If there is any doubt about her, I <i>cannot</i> hesitate," returned
  Bloundel.</p>

  <p>As he said this, the door was opened by Leonard, and Chowles and Judith
  entered the room. The latter, on seeing the doctor, looked greatly
  embarrassed.</p>

  <p>"I have brought you the nurse I spoke of, Mr. Bloundel," said Chowles,
  bowing, "and am come to inquire whether you want a coffin to-night."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Bloundel is not likely to require a coffin at present, Chowles,"
  returned the doctor, severely; "neither does his son stand in need of a
  nurse. How is your husband, Mrs. Malmayns?"</p>

  <p>"He is dead, sir," replied Judith.</p>

  <p>"Dead!" echoed the doctor. "When I left him at one o'clock this morning,
  he was doing well. Your attendance seems to have accelerated his end."</p>

  <p>"His death was occasioned by an accident, sir," replied Judith. "He became
  delirious about three o'clock, and, in spite of all my efforts to detain him,
  started out of bed, rushed into Saint Faith's, and threw himself into a pit,
  which Mr. Lilly and some other persons had digged in search of treasure."</p>

  <p>"This is a highly improbable story, Mrs. Malmayns," returned Hodges, "and
  I must have the matter thoroughly investigated before I lose sight of
  you."</p>

  <p>"I will vouch for the truth of Mrs. Malmayn's statement," interposed
  Chowles.</p>

  <p>"You!" cried Hodges, contemptuously.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I," replied the coffin-maker. "It seems that the sexton had found a
  chest of treasure buried in Saint Faith's, and being haunted by the idea that
  some one was carrying it off, he suddenly sprang out of bed, and rushed to
  the church, where, sure enough, Mr. Lilly, Mr. Quatremain, the Earl of
  Rochester, and Sir George Etherege, having, by the help of mosaical rods,
  discovered this very chest, were digging it up. Poor Matthew instantly
  plunged into the grave, and died of a sudden chill."</p>

  <p>"That is not impossible," observed Hodges, after a pause. "But what has
  become of the treasure?"</p>

  <p>"It is in the possession of Mr. Quatremain, who has given notice of it to
  the proper authorities," replied Chowles. "It consists, as I understand, of
  gold pieces struck in the reign of Philip and Mary, images of the same metal,
  crosses, pyxes, chalices, and other Popish and superstitious vessels, buried,
  probably, when Queen Elizabeth came to the throne, and the religion
  changed."</p>

  <p>"Not unlikely," replied Hodges. "Where is your husband's body, Mrs.
  Malmayns?"</p>

  <p>"It has been removed to the vault which he usually occupied," replied
  Judith. "Mr. Chowles has undertaken to bury it to-night."</p>

  <p>"I must see it first," replied Hodges, "and be sure that he has not met
  with foul play."</p>

  <p>"And I will accompany you," said Chowles. "So you do not want a coffin,
  Mr. Bloundel?"</p>

  <p>The grocer shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Good day, Mr. Bloundel," said Hodges. "I shall visit you to-morrow, and
  hope to find your son as well as I leave him. Chowles, you will be answerable
  for the safe custody of Mrs. Malmayns."</p>

  <p>"I have no desire to escape, sir," replied the nurse. "You will find
  everything as I have represented."</p>

  <p>"We shall see," replied the doctor. "If not, you will have to tend the
  sick in Newgate."</p>

  <p>The trio then proceeded to Saint Paul's, and descended to the vaults.
  Hodges carefully examined the body of the unfortunate sexton, but though he
  entertained strong suspicions, he could not pronounce positively that he had
  been improperly treated; and as the statement of Mrs. Malmayns was fully
  borne out by the vergers and others, he did not think it necessary to pursue
  the investigation further. As soon as he was gone, Judith accompanied the
  coffin-maker to his residence, where she remained, till the evening, when she
  was suddenly summoned, in a case of urgency, by a messenger from Sibbald, the
  apothecary of Clerkenwell.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch1-10"
     name="ch1-10">X. &mdash; THE DUEL.</a></h2>

  <p>After Parravicin's terrible announcement, Disbrowe offered him no further
  violence, but, flinging down his sword, burst open the door, and rushed
  upstairs. His wife was still insensible, but the fatal mark that had betrayed
  the presence of the plague to the knight manifested itself also to him, and
  he stood like one entranced, until Mrs. Disbrowe, recovering from her swoon,
  opened her eyes, and, gazing at him, cried&mdash;"You here!&mdash;Oh
  Disbrowe, I dreamed you had deserted me&mdash;had sold me to another."</p>

  <p>"Would it were a dream!" replied her husband.</p>

  <p>"And was it not so?" she rejoined, pressing her hand to her temples. "It
  is true! oh! yes, I feel it is. Every circumstance rushes upon me plainly and
  distinctly. I see the daring libertine before me. He stood where you stand,
  and told me what you had done."</p>

  <p>"What did he tell you, Margaret?" asked Disbrowe in a hollow voice.</p>

  <p>"He told me you were false&mdash;that you loved another, and had abandoned
  me."</p>

  <p>"He lied!" exclaimed Disbrowe, in a voice of uncontrollable fury. "It is
  true that, in a moment of frenzy, I was tempted to set you&mdash;yes,
  <i>you</i>, Margaret&mdash;against all I had lost at play, and was compelled
  to yield up the key of my house to the winner. But I have never been
  faithless to you&mdash;never."</p>

  <p>"Faithless or not," replied his wife, bitterly, "it is plain you value me
  less than play, or you would not have acted thus."</p>

  <p>"Reproach me not, Margaret," replied Disbrowe; "I would give worlds to
  undo what I have done."</p>

  <p>"Who shall guard me against the recurrence of such conduct?" said Mrs.
  Disbrowe, coldly. "But you have not yet informed me how I was saved."</p>

  <p>Disbrowe averted his head.</p>

  <p>"What mean you?" she cried, seizing his arm. "What has happened? Do not
  keep me in suspense? Were you my preserver?"</p>

  <p>"Your preserver was the plague," rejoined Disbrowe, in a sombre tone.</p>

  <p>The unfortunate lady then, for the first time, perceived that she was
  attacked by the pestilence, and a long and dreadful pause ensued, broken only
  by exclamations of anguish from both.</p>

  <p>"Disbrowe!" cried Margaret, at length, raising herself in bed, "you have
  deeply&mdash;irrecoverably injured me. But promise me one thing."</p>

  <p>"I swear to do whatever you may desire," he replied.</p>

  <p>"I know not, after what I have heard, whether you have courage for the
  deed," she continued. "But I would have you kill this man."</p>

  <p>"I will do it," replied Disbrowe.</p>

  <p>"Nothing but his blood can wipe out the wrong he has done me," she
  rejoined. "Challenge him to a duel&mdash;a mortal duel. If he survives, by my
  soul, I will give myself to him."</p>

  <p>"Margaret!" exclaimed Disbrowe.</p>

  <p>"I swear it," she rejoined. "And you know my passionate nature too well to
  doubt I will keep my word."</p>

  <p>"But you have the plague!"</p>

  <p>"What does that matter? I may recover."</p>

  <p>"Not so," muttered Disbrowe. "If I fall, I will take care you do not
  recover. I will fight him to-morrow," he added aloud.</p>

  <p>He then summoned his servants, but when they found their mistress was
  attacked by the plague, they framed some excuse to leave the room, and
  instantly fled the house. Driven almost to his wits' end, Disbrowe went in
  search of other assistance, and was for a while unsuccessful, until a
  coachman, to whom he applied, offered, for a suitable reward, to drive to
  Clerkenwell&mdash;to the shop of an apothecary named Sibbald (with whose name
  the reader is already familiar), who was noted for his treatment of plague
  patients, and to bring him to the other's residence. Disbrowe immediately
  closed with the man, and in less than two hours Sibbald made his appearance.
  He was a singular and repulsive personage, with an immense hooked nose, dark,
  savage-looking eyes, a skin like parchment, and high round shoulders, which
  procured him the nickname of Aesop among his neighbours. He was under the
  middle size, and of a spare figure, and in age might be about sixty-five.</p>

  <p>On seeing Mrs. Disbrowe, he at once boldly asserted that he could cure
  her, and proceeded to apply his remedies. Finding the servants fled, he
  offered to procure a nurse for Disbrowe, and the latter, thanking him,
  eagerly embraced the offer. Soon after this he departed. In the evening the
  nurse, who (as may be surmised) was no other than Judith Malmayns, arrived,
  and immediately commenced her functions.</p>

  <p>Disbrowe had no rest that night. His wife slept occasionally for a few
  minutes, but, apparently engrossed by one idea, never failed when she awoke
  to urge him to slay Parravicin; repeating her oath to give herself to the
  knight if he came off victorious. Worn out at length, Disbrowe gave her a
  terrible look, and rushed out of the room.</p>

  <p>He had not been alone many minutes when he was surprised by the entrance
  of Judith. He eagerly inquired whether his wife was worse, but was informed
  she had dropped into a slumber.</p>

  <p>"Hearing what has passed between you," said the nurse, "and noticing your
  look when you left the room, I came to tell you, that if you fall in this
  duel, your last moments need not be embittered by any thoughts of your wife.
  I will take care she does not recover."</p>

  <p>A horrible smile lighted up Disbrowe's features.</p>

  <p>"You are the very person I want," he said. "When I would do evil, the
  fiend rises to my bidding. If I am slain, you know what to do. How shall I
  requite the service?"</p>

  <p>"Do not concern yourself about that, captain," rejoined Judith. "I will
  take care of myself."</p>

  <p>About noon, on the following day, Disbrowe, without venturing to see his
  wife, left the house, and proceeded to the Smyrna, where, as he expected, he
  found Parravicin and his companions.</p>

  <p>The knight instantly advanced towards him, and, laying aside for the
  moment his reckless air, inquired, with a look of commiseration, after his
  wife.</p>

  <p>"She is better," replied Disbrowe, fiercely. "I am come to settle accounts
  with you."</p>

  <p>"I thought they were settled long ago," returned Parravicin, instantly
  resuming his wonted manner. "But I am glad to find you consider the debt
  unpaid."</p>

  <p>Disbrowe lifted the cane he held in his hand, and struck the knight with
  it forcibly on the shoulder. "Be that my answer," he said.</p>

  <p>"I will have your life first, and your wife afterwards," replied
  Parravicin, furiously.</p>

  <p>"You shall have her if you slay me, but not otherwise," retorted Disbrowe.
  "It must be a mortal duel."</p>

  <p>"It must," replied Parravicin. "I will not spare you this time."</p>

  <p>"Spare him!" cried Pillichody. "Shield of Agamemnon! I should hope not.
  Spit him as you would a wild boar."</p>

  <p>"Peace, fool!" cried Parravicin. "Captain Disbrowe, I shall instantly
  proceed to the west side of Hyde Park, beneath the trees. I shall expect you
  there. On my return I shall call on your wife."</p>

  <p>"I pray you do so, sir," replied Disbrowe, disdainfully.</p>

  <p>Both then quitted the coffee-house, Parravicin attended by Rochester and
  Pillichody, and Disbrowe accompanied by a military friend, whom he
  accidentally encountered. Each party taking a coach, they soon reached the
  ground,&mdash;a retired spot, completely screened from observation by trees.
  The preliminaries were soon arranged, for neither would admit of delay. The
  conflict then commenced with great fury on both sides; but Parravicin, in
  spite of his passion, observed far more caution than his antagonist; and,
  taking advantage of an unguarded movement, occasioned by the other's
  impetuosity, passed his sword through his body.</p>

  <p>Disbrowe fell.</p>

  <p>"You are again successful," he groaned, "but save my wife&mdash;save
  her."</p>

  <p>"What mean you?" cried Parravicin, leaning over him, as he wiped his
  sword.</p>

  <p>But Disbrowe could make no answer. His utterance was choked by a sudden
  effusion of blood on the lungs, and he instantly expired. Leaving the body in
  care of the second, Parravicin and his friends returned to the coach, where
  the major rejoiced greatly at the issue of the duel; but the knight looked
  grave, and pondered upon the words of the dying man. After a time, however,
  he recovered his spirits, and dined with his friends at the Smyrna; but they
  observed that he drank more deeply than usual. His excesses did not, however,
  prevent him from playing with his usual skill, and he won a large sum from
  Rochester at hazard.</p>

  <p>Flushed with success, and heated with wine, he walked up to Disbrowe's
  residence about an hour after midnight. As he approached the house, he
  observed a strangely-shaped cart at the door, and, halting for a moment, saw
  a body, wrapped in a shroud, brought out. Could it be Mrs. Disbrowe? Rushing
  forward, to one of the assistants in black cloaks&mdash;and who was no other
  than Chowles&mdash;he asked whom he was about to inter.</p>

  <p>"It is a Mrs. Disbrowe," replied the coffin-maker. "She died of grief,
  because her husband was killed this morning in a duel; but as she had the
  plague, it must be put down to that. We are not particular in such matters,
  and shall bury her and her husband together; and as there is no money left to
  pay for coffins, they must go to the grave without them. What, ho! Mother
  Malmayns, let Jonas have the captain as soon as you have stripped him. I must
  be starting."</p>

  <p>And as the body of his victim was brought forth, Parravicin fell against
  the wall in a state almost of stupefaction.</p>

  <p>At this moment Solomon Eagle, with his brazier on his head, suddenly
  turned the corner of the street, and stationing himself before the dead-cart,
  cried in a voice of thunder, "Woe to the libertine! woe to the homicide! for
  he shall perish in everlasting fire! Woe! woe!"</p>

     name="bk2">BOOK THE SECOND &mdash; MAY, 1665</a></h2>

  <h2>I. &mdash; PROGRESS OF THE PESTILENCE</h2>

  <p>Towards the middle of May, the bills of mortality began to swell greatly
  in amount, and though but few were put down to the plague, and a large number
  to the spotted fever (another frightful disorder raging at the period), it is
  well known that the bulk had died of the former disease. The rigorous
  measures adopted by the authorities (whether salutary or not has been
  questioned), in shutting up houses and confining the sick and sound within
  them for forty days, were found so intolerable, that most persons were
  disposed to run any risk rather than be subjected to such a grievance, and
  every artifice was resorted to for concealing a case when it occurred. Hence,
  it seldom happened, unless by accident, that a discovery was made. Quack
  doctors were secretly consulted, instead of the regular practitioners; the
  searchers were bribed to silence; and large fees were given to the
  undertakers and buriers to lay the deaths to the account of some other
  disorder. All this, however, did not blind the eyes of the officers to the
  real state of things. Redoubling their vigilance, they entered houses on mere
  suspicion; inflicted punishments where they found their orders disobeyed or
  neglected; sent the sound to prison,&mdash;the sick to the pest-house; and
  replaced the faithless searchers by others upon whom they could place
  reliance. Many cases were thus detected; but in spite of every precaution,
  the majority escaped; and the vent was no sooner stopped in one quarter than
  it broke out with additional violence in another.</p>

  <p>By this time the alarm had become general. All whose business or pursuits
  permitted it, prepared to leave London, which they regarded as a devoted
  city, without delay. As many houses were, therefore, closed from the absence
  of the inhabitants as from the presence of the plague, and this added to the
  forlorn appearance of the streets, which in some quarters were almost
  deserted. For a while, nothing was seen at the great outlets of the city but
  carts, carriages, and other vehicles, filled with goods and movables, on
  their way to the country; and, as may be supposed, the departure of their
  friends did not tend to abate the dejection of those whose affairs compelled
  them to remain behind.</p>

  <p>One circumstance must not be passed unnoticed, namely, the continued
  fineness and beauty of the weather. No rain had fallen for upwards of three
  weeks. The sky was bright and cloudless; the atmosphere, apparently, pure and
  innoxious; while the heat was as great as is generally experienced in the
  middle of summer. But instead of producing its usual enlivening effect on the
  spirits, the fine weather added to the general gloom and apprehension,
  inasmuch as it led to the belief (afterwards fully confirmed), that if the
  present warmth was so pernicious, the more sultry seasons which were near at
  hand would aggravate the fury of the pestilence. Sometimes, indeed, when the
  deaths were less numerous, a hope began to be entertained that the distemper
  was abating, and confidence was for a moment restored; but these
  anticipations were speedily checked by the reappearance of the scourge, which
  seemed to baffle and deride all human skill and foresight.</p>

  <p>London now presented a lamentable spectacle. Not a street but had a house
  in it marked with a red cross&mdash;some streets had many such. The bells
  were continually tolling for burials, and the dead-carts went their
  melancholy rounds at night and were constantly loaded. Fresh directions were
  issued by the authorities; and as domestic animals were considered to be a
  medium of conveying the infection, an order, which was immediately carried
  into effect, was given to destroy all dogs and cats. But this plan proved
  prejudicial rather than the reverse, as the bodies of the poor animals, most
  of which were drowned in the Thames, being washed ashore, produced a horrible
  and noxious effluvium, supposed to contribute materially to the propagation
  of the distemper.</p>

  <p>No precautionary measure was neglected; but it may be doubted whether any
  human interference could have averted the severity of the scourge, which,
  though its progress might be checked for a few days by attention, or
  increased in the same ratio by neglect, would in the end have unquestionably
  fulfilled its mission. The College of Physicians, by the king's command,
  issued simple and intelligible directions, in the mother tongue, for the
  sick. Certain of their number, amongst whom was the reader's acquaintance,
  Doctor Hodges, were appointed to attend the infected; and two out of the
  Court of Aldermen were required to see that they duly executed their
  dangerous office. Public prayers and a general fast were likewise enjoined.
  But Heaven seemed deaf to the supplications of the doomed
  inhabitants&mdash;their prayers being followed by a fearful increase of
  deaths. A vast crowd was collected within Saint Paul's to hear a sermon
  preached by Doctor Sheldon, Archbishop of Canterbury,&mdash;a prelate greatly
  distinguished during the whole course of the visitation, by his unremitting
  charity and attention to the sick; and before the discourse was concluded,
  several fell down within the sacred walls, and, on being conveyed to their
  own homes, were found to be infected. On the following day, too, many others
  who had been present were seized with the disorder.</p>

  <p>A fresh impulse was given to the pestilence from an unlooked for cause. It
  has been mentioned that the shutting up of houses and seclusion of the sick
  were regarded as an intolerable grievance, and though most were compelled to
  submit to it, some few resisted, and tumults and disturbances ensued. As the
  plague increased, these disturbances became more frequent, and the mob always
  taking part against the officers, they were frequently interrupted in the
  execution of their duty.</p>

  <p>About this time a more serious affray than usual occurred, attended-with
  loss of life and other unfortunate consequences, which it may be worth while
  to relate, as illustrative of the peculiar state of the times. The wife of a
  merchant, named Barcroft, residing in Lothbury, being attacked by the plague,
  the husband, fearing his house would be shut up, withheld all information
  from the examiners and searchers. His wife died, and immediately afterwards
  one of his children was attacked. Still he refused to give notice. The
  matter, however, got wind. The searchers arrived at night, and being refused
  admittance, they broke into the house. Finding undoubted evidence of
  infection, they ordered it to be closed, stationed a watchman at the door,
  and marked it with the fatal sign. Barcroft remonstrated against their
  proceedings, but in vain. They told him he might think himself well off that
  he was not carried before the Lord Mayor, who would undoubtedly send him to
  Ludgate; and with other threats to the like effect, they departed.</p>

  <p>The unfortunate man's wife and child were removed the following night in
  the dead-cart, and, driven half-mad by grief and terror, he broke open the
  door of his dwelling, and, plunging a sword in the watchman's breast, who
  opposed his flight, gained the street. A party of the watch happened to be
  passing at the time, and the fugitive was instantly secured. He made a great
  clamour, however,&mdash;calling to his neighbours and the bystanders to
  rescue him, and in another moment the watch was beaten off, and Barcroft
  placed on a post, whence he harangued his preservers on the severe restraints
  imposed upon the citizens, urging them to assist in throwing open the doors
  of all infected houses, and allowing free egress to their inmates.</p>

  <p>Greedily listening to this insane counsel, the mob resolved to act upon
  it. Headed by the merchant, they ran down Thread-needle-street, and, crossing
  Stock's Market, burst open several houses in Bearbinder-lane, and drove away
  the watchmen. One man, more courageous than the others, tried to maintain his
  post, and was so severely handled by his assailants, that he died a few days
  afterwards of the injuries he had received. Most of those who had been
  imprisoned within their dwellings immediately issued forth, and joining the
  mob, which received fresh recruits each moment, started on the same
  errand.</p>

  <p>Loud shouts were now raised of&mdash;"Open the doors! No plague prisoners!
  No plague prisoners!" and the mob set off along the Poultry. They halted,
  however, before the Great Conduit, near the end of Bucklersbury, and opposite
  Mercer's Hall, because they perceived a company of the Train-bands advancing
  to meet them. A council of war was held, and many of the rabble were disposed
  to fly; but Barcroft again urged them to proceed, and they were unexpectedly
  added by Solomon Eagle, who, bursting through their ranks, with his brazier
  on his head, crying, "Awake! sleepers, awake! the plague is at your doors!
  awake!" speeded towards the Train-bands, scattering sparks of fire as he
  pursued his swift career. The mob instantly followed, and, adding their
  shouts to his outcries, dashed on with such fury that the Train-bands did not
  dare to oppose them, and, after a slight and ineffectual resistance, were put
  to rout.</p>

  <p>Barcroft, who acted as leader, informed them that there was a house in
  Wood-street shut up, and the crowd accompanied him thither. In a few minutes
  they had reached Bloundel's shop, but finding no one on guard&mdash;for the
  watchman, guessing their errand, had taken to his heels&mdash;they smeared
  over the fatal cross and inscription with a pail of mud gathered from the
  neighbouring kennel, and then broke open the door. The grocer and his
  apprentice hearing the disturbance, and being greatly alarmed at it, hurried
  to the shop, and found it full of people.</p>

  <p>"You are at liberty Mr. Bloundel," cried the merchant, who was acquainted
  with the grocer. "We are determined no longer to let our families be
  imprisoned at the pleasure of the Lord Mayor and aldermen. We mean to break
  open all the plague houses, and set free their inmates."</p>

  <p>"For Heaven's sake, consider what you are about, Mr. Barcroft," cried the
  grocer. "My house has been closed for nearly a month. Nay, as my son has
  entirely recovered, and received his certificate of health from Doctor
  Hodges, it would have been opened in three days hence by the officers; so
  that I have suffered all the inconvenience of the confinement, and can speak
  to it. It is no doubt very irksome, and may be almost intolerable to persons
  of an impatient temperament: but I firmly believe it is the only means to
  check the progress of contagion. Listen to me, Mr. Barcroft&mdash;listen to
  me, good friends, and hesitate before you violate laws which have been made
  expressly to meet this terrible emergency."</p>

  <p>Here he was checked by loud groans and upbraidings from the
  bystanders.</p>

  <p>"He tells you himself that the period of his confinement is just over,"
  cried Barcroft. "It is plain he has no interest in the matter, except that he
  would have others suffer as he has done. Heed him not, my friends; but
  proceed with the good work. Liberate the poor plague prisoners. Liberate
  them. On! on!"</p>

  <p>"Forbear, rash men" cried Bloundel, in an authoritative voice. "In the
  name of those you are bound to obey, I command you to desist."</p>

  <p>"Command us!" cried one of the bystanders, raising his staff in a menacing
  manner. "Is this your gratitude for the favour we have just conferred upon
  you? Command us, forsooth! You had better repeat the order, and see how it
  will be obeyed."</p>

  <p>"I <i>do</i> repeat it," rejoined the grocer, firmly. "In the Lord Mayor's
  name, I command you to desist, and return to your homes."</p>

  <p>The man would have struck him with his staff, if he had not been himself
  felled to the ground by Leonard. This was the signal for greater outrage. The
  grocer and his apprentice were instantly assailed by several others of the
  mob, who, leaving them both on the floor covered with bruises, helped
  themselves to all they could lay hands on in the shop, and then quitted the
  premises.</p>

  <p>It is scarcely necessary to track their course further; and it may be
  sufficient to state, that they broke open upwards of fifty houses in
  different streets. Many of the plague-stricken joined them, and several
  half-naked creatures were found dead in the streets on the following morning.
  Two houses in Blackfriars-lane were set on fire, and the conflagration was
  with difficulty checked; nor was it until late on the following day that the
  mob could be entirely dispersed. The originator of the disturbance, Barcroft,
  after a desperate resistance, was shot through the head by a constable.</p>

  <p>The result of this riot, as will be easily foreseen, was greatly to
  increase the pestilence; and many of those who had been most active in it
  perished in prison of the distemper. Far from being discouraged by the
  opposition offered to their decrees, the city authorities enforced them with
  greater rigour than ever, and, doubling the number of the watch, again shut
  up all those houses which had been broken open during the late tumult.</p>

  <p>Bloundel received a visit from the Lord Mayor, Sir John Lawrence, who,
  having been informed of his conduct, came to express his high approval of it,
  offering to remit the few days yet unexpired of his quarantine. The grocer,
  however, declined the offer, and with renewed expressions of approbation, Sir
  John Lawrence took his leave.</p>

  <p>Three days afterwards, the Examiner of Health pronounced the grocer's
  house free from infection. The fatal mark was obliterated from the door; the
  shutters were unfastened; and Bloundel resumed his business as usual. Words
  are inadequate to describe the delight that filled the breast of every member
  of his family, on their first meeting after their long separation. It took
  place in the room adjoining the shop. Mrs. Bloundel received the joyful
  summons from Leonard, and, on descending with her children, found her husband
  and her son Stephen anxiously expecting her. Scarcely able to make up her
  mind as to which of the two she should embrace first, Mrs. Bloundel was
  decided by the pale countenance of her son, and rushing towards him, she
  strained him to her breast, while Amabel flew to her father's arms. The
  grocer could not repress his tears; but they were tears of joy, and that
  night's happiness made him ample amends for all the anxiety he had recently
  undergone.</p>

  <p>"Well, Stephen, my dear child," said his mother, as soon as the first
  tumult of emotion had subsided,&mdash;"well, Stephen," she said, smiling at
  him through her tears, and almost smothering him with kisses, "you are not so
  much altered as I expected; and I do not think, if I had had the care of you,
  I could have nursed you better myself. You owe your father a second life, and
  we all owe him the deepest gratitude for the care he has taken of you."</p>

  <p>"I can never be sufficiently grateful for his kindness," returned Stephen,
  affectionately.</p>

  <p>"Give thanks to the beneficent Being who has preserved you from this great
  danger, my son, not to me," returned Bloundel. "The first moments of our
  reunion should be worthily employed."</p>

  <p>So saying, he summoned the household, and, for the first time for a month,
  the whole family party assembled, as before, at prayer. Never were
  thanksgivings more earnestly, more devoutly uttered. All arose with bright
  and cheerful countenances; and even Blaize seemed to have shaken off his
  habitual dread of the pestilence. As he retired with Patience, he observed to
  her, "Master Stephen looks quite well, though a little thinner. I must
  ascertain from him the exact course of treatment pursued by his father. I
  wonder whether Mr. Bloundel would nurse <i>me</i> if I were to be suddenly
  seized with the distemper?"</p>

  <p>"If he wouldn't, I <i>would</i>," replied Patience.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, thank you," replied Blaize. "I begin to think we shall get
  through it. I shall go out to-morrow and examine the bills of mortality, and
  see what progress the plague is making. I am all anxiety to know. I must get
  a fresh supply of medicine, too. My private store is quite gone, except three
  of my favourite rufuses, which I shall take before I go to bed to-night.
  Unluckily, my purse is as empty as my phials."</p>

  <p>"I can lend you a little money," said Patience. "I haven't touched my last
  year's wages. They are quite at your service."</p>

  <p>"You are too good," replied Blaize; "but I won't decline the offer. I
  heard a man crying a new anti-pestilential elixir, as he passed the house
  yesterday. I must find him out and buy a bottle. Besides, I must call on my
  friend Parkhurst, the apothecary.&mdash;You are a good girl, Patience, and
  I'll marry you as soon as the plague ceases."</p>

  <p>"I have something else to give you," rejoined Patience. "This little bag
  contains a hazel-nut, from which I have picked the kernel, and filled its
  place with quicksilver, stopping the hole with wax. Wear it round your neck,
  and you will find it a certain preservative against the pestilence."</p>

  <p>"Who told you of this remedy?" asked Blaize, taking the bag.</p>

  <p>"Your mother," returned Patience.</p>

  <p>"I wonder I never heard of it," said the porter.</p>

  <p>"She wouldn't mention it to you, because the doctor advised her not to put
  such matters into your head," replied Patience. "But I couldn't help
  indulging you. Heigho! I hope the plague will soon be over."</p>

  <p>"It won't be over for six months," rejoined Blaize, shaking his head. "I
  read in a little book, published in 1593, in Queen Elizabeth's reign, and
  written by Simon Kelway, 'that when little children flock together, and
  pretend that some of their number are dead, solemnizing the burial in a
  mournful sort, it is a certain token that a great mortality is at hand.' This
  I have myself seen more than once. Again, just before the great sickness of
  1625, the churchyard wall of St. Andrew's, Holborn, fell down. I need not
  tell you that the same thing occurred after the frost this winter."</p>

  <p>"I heard of it," replied Patience: "but I did not know it was a bad
  sign."</p>

  <p>"It is a dreadful sign," returned Blaize, with a shudder "The thought of
  it brings back my old symptoms. I must have a supper to guard against
  infection&mdash;a slice of toasted bread, sprinkled with, vinegar, and
  powdered with nutmeg."</p>

  <p>And chattering thus, they proceeded to the kitchen.</p>

  <p>Before supper could be served, Dr. Hodges made his appearance. He was
  delighted to see the family assembled together again, and expressed a hearty
  wish that they might never more be divided. He watched Amabel and Leonard
  carefully, and seemed annoyed that the former rather shunned than favoured
  the regards of the apprentice.</p>

  <p>Leonard, too, looked disconcerted; and though he was in possession of his
  mistress's promise, he did not like to reclaim it. During the whole of the
  month, he had been constantly on the watch, and had scarcely slept at night,
  so anxious was he to prevent the possibility of any communication taking
  place between Rochester and his mistress. But, in spite of all his caution,
  it was possible he might be deceived. And when on this, their first meeting,
  she returned his anxious gaze with averted looks, he felt all his jealous
  misgivings return.</p>

  <p>Supper, meanwhile, proceeded. Doctor Hodges was in excellent spirits, and
  drank a bottle of old sack with great relish. Overcome by the sight of his
  wife and children, the grocer abandoned himself to his feelings. As to his
  wife, she could scarcely contain herself, but wept and laughed by
  turns&mdash;now embracing her husband, now her son, between whom she had
  placed herself. Nor did she forget Doctor Hodges; and such was the exuberance
  of her satisfaction, that when the repast was ended, she arose, and, flinging
  her arms about his neck, termed him the preserver of her son.</p>

  <p>"If any one is entitled to that appellation it is his father," replied
  Hodges, "and I may say, that in all my experience I have never witnessed such
  generous self-devotion as Mr. Bloundel has exhibited towards his son. You
  must now be satisfied, madam, that no person can so well judge what is proper
  for the safety of his family as your husband."</p>

  <p>"I never doubted it, sir," replied Mrs. Bloundel.</p>

  <p>"I must apprise you, then, that he has conceived a plan by which he trusts
  to secure you and his children and household from any future attack,"
  returned Hodges.</p>

  <p>"I care not what it is, so it does not separate me from him," replied Mrs.
  Bloundel.</p>

  <p>"It does not," replied the grocer. "It will knit us more closely together
  than we have yet been. I mean to shut up my house, having previously stored
  it with provisions for a twelvemonth, and shall suffer no member of my family
  to stir forth as long as the plague endures."</p>

  <p>"I am ready to remain within doors, if it continues twenty years," replied
  his wife. "But how long do you think it <i>will</i> last, doctor?"</p>

  <p>"Till next December, I have no doubt," returned Hodges.</p>

  <p>"So long?" exclaimed Amabel.</p>

  <p>"Ay, so long," repeated the doctor. "It has scarcely begun now. Your
  father is right to adopt these precautions. It is the only way to insure the
  safety of his family."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;&mdash;" cried Amabel.</p>

  <p>"I am resolved," interrupted Bloundel, peremptorily. "Who ever leaves the
  house&mdash;if but for a moment&mdash;never returns."</p>

  <p>"And when do you close it, father?" asked Amabel.</p>

  <p>"A week hence," replied the grocer; "as soon as I have laid in a
  sufficient stock of provisions."</p>

  <p>"And am I not to leave the house for a year?" cried Amabel, with a
  dissatisfied look.</p>

  <p>"Why should you wish to leave it?" asked her father, curiously.</p>

  <p>"Ay, why?" repeated Leonard, in a low tone. "I shall be here."</p>

  <p>Amabel seemed confused, and looked from her father to Leonard. The former,
  however, did not notice her embarrassment, but observed to Hodges&mdash;"I
  shall begin to victual the house to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"Amabel," whispered Leonard, "you told me if I claimed your hand in a
  month, you would yield it to me. I require the fulfilment of your
  promise."</p>

  <p>"Give me till to-morrow," she replied, distractedly.</p>

  <p>"She has seen Rochester," muttered the apprentice, turning away.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch2-2"
     name="ch2-2">II. &mdash; IN WHAT MANNER THE GROCER VICTUALLED HIS
     HOUSE.</a></h2>

  <p>Leonard Holt was wrong in his suspicions. Amabel had neither seen nor
  heard from Rochester. But, if the truth must be told, he was never out of her
  mind, and she found, to her cost, that the heart will not be controlled.
  Convinced of her noble lover's perfidy, and aware she was acting wrongfully
  in cherishing a passion for him, after the exposure of his base designs
  towards herself, no reasoning of which she was capable could banish him from
  her thoughts, or enable her to transfer her affections to the apprentice.</p>

  <p>This conflict of feeling produced its natural result. She became
  thoughtful and dejected&mdash;was often in tears&mdash;had no
  appetite&mdash;and could scarcely rouse herself sufficiently to undertake any
  sort of employment. Her mother watched her with great anxiety, and
  feared&mdash;though she sought to disguise it from herself&mdash;what was the
  real cause of her despondency.</p>

  <p>Things were in this position at the end of the month, and it occasioned no
  surprise to Mrs. Bloundel, though it afflicted her deeply, to find that
  Amabel sedulously avoided the apprentice's regards on their first meeting.
  When Doctor Hodges was gone, and the rest of the family had retired, she
  remarked to her husband, "Before you shut up the house as you propose, I
  should, wish one important matter settled."</p>

  <p>The grocer inquired what she meant.</p>

  <p>"I should wish to have Amabel married," was the answer.</p>

  <p>"Married!" exclaimed Bloundel, in astonishment. "To whom?"</p>

  <p>"To Leonard Holt."</p>

  <p>Bloundel could scarcely repress his displeasure.</p>

  <p>"It will be time enough to talk of that a year hence," he answered.</p>

  <p>"I don't think so," returned his wife; "and now, since the proper time for
  the disclosure of the secret has arrived, I must tell you that the gallant
  who called himself Maurice Wyvil, and whom you so much dreaded, was no other
  than the Earl of Rochester."</p>

  <p>"Rochester!" echoed the grocer, while an angry flush stained his cheek;
  "has that libertine dared to enter my house?"</p>

  <p>"Ay, and more than once," replied Mrs. Bloundel.</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" cried her husband, with difficulty controlling his indignation.
  "When was he here?&mdash;tell me quickly."</p>

  <p>His wife then proceeded to relate all that had occurred, and he listened
  with profound attention to her recital. At its close, he arose and paced the
  chamber for some time in great agitation.</p>

  <p>At length he suddenly paused, and, regarding his wife with great
  sternness, observed, in a severe tone, "You have done very wrong in
  concealing this from me, Honora&mdash;very wrong."</p>

  <p>"If I have erred, it was to spare you uneasiness," returned Mrs. Bloundel,
  bursting into tears. "Doctor Hodges agreed with me that it was better not to
  mention the subject while you had so many other anxieties pressing upon
  you."</p>

  <p>"I have a stout heart, and a firm reliance on the goodness of Heaven,
  which will enable me to bear up against most evils," returned the grocer.
  "But on this point I ought, under any circumstances, to have been consulted.
  And I am greatly surprised that Doctor Hodges should advise the
  contrary."</p>

  <p>"He was influenced, like myself, by the kindliest feelings towards you,"
  sobbed Mrs. Bloundel.</p>

  <p>"Well, well, I will not reproach you further," returned the grocer,
  somewhat moved by her tears. "I have no doubt you conceived you were acting
  for the best. But I must caution you against such conduct for the future."
  After a pause, he added, "Is it your opinion that our poor deluded child
  still entertains any regard for this profligate nobleman?"</p>

  <p>"I am sure she does," replied Mrs. Bloundel; "and it is from that
  conviction that I so strongly urge the necessity of marrying her to Leonard
  Holt."</p>

  <p>"I will never compel her to do anything to endanger her future happiness,"
  returned the grocer. "She must not marry Leonard Holt without loving him. It
  is better to risk an uncertain evil, than to rush upon a certain one."</p>

  <p>"Then I won't answer for the consequences," replied his wife.</p>

  <p>"What!" cried Bloundel; "am I to understand you have no reliance on
  Amabel? Has all our care been thrown away?"</p>

  <p>"I do not distrust her," returned Mrs. Bloundel; "but consider whom she
  has to deal with. She is beset by the handsomest and most fascinating man of
  the day&mdash;by one understood to be practised in all the arts most
  dangerous to our sex&mdash;and a nobleman to boot. Some allowance must be
  made for her."</p>

  <p>"I will make none," rejoined Bloundel, austerely. "She has been taught to
  resist temptation in whatever guise it may present itself; and if the
  principles I have endeavoured to implant within her breast had found lodgment
  there, she <i>would</i> have resisted it. I am deeply grieved to find this is
  not the case, and that she must trust to others for protection, when she
  ought to be able to defend herself."</p>

  <p>The subject was not further discussed, and the grocer and his wife shortly
  afterwards retired to rest.</p>

  <p>On the following morning, Bloundel remarked to the apprentice as they
  stood together in the shop, "Leonard, you are aware I am about to shut up my
  house. Before doing so, I must make certain needful arrangements. I will not
  disguise from you that I should prefer your remaining with me, but at the
  same time I beg you distinctly to understand that I will not detain you
  against your will. Your articles are within two months of expiring; and, if
  you desire it, I will deliver them to you to-morrow, and release you from the
  rest of your time."</p>

  <p>"I do not desire it, sir," replied Leonard; "I will remain as long as I
  can be serviceable to you."</p>

  <p>"Take time for reflection," rejoined his master, kindly. "In all
  probability, it will be a long confinement, and you may repent, when too
  late, having subjected yourself to it."</p>

  <p>"Last month's experience has taught me what I have to expect," remarked
  Leonard, with a smile. "My mind is made up, I will stay with you."</p>

  <p>"I am glad of it," returned Bloundel, "and now I have something further to
  say to you. My wife has acquainted me with the daring attempt of the Earl of
  Rochester to carry off Amabel."</p>

  <p>"Has my mistress, also, told you of my attachment to your daughter?"
  demanded Leonard, trembling, in spite of his efforts to maintain a show of
  calmness.</p>

  <p>Bloundel nodded an affirmative.</p>

  <p>"And of Amabel's promise to bestow her hand upon me, if I claimed it at
  the month's end?" continued the apprentice.</p>

  <p>"No!" replied the grocer, a good deal surprised&mdash;"I heard of no such
  promise. Nor was I aware the matter had gone so far. But have you claimed
  it?"</p>

  <p>"I have," replied Leonard; "but she declined giving an answer till
  to-day."</p>

  <p>"We will have it, then, at once," cried Bloundel "Come with me to
  her."</p>

  <p>So saying, he led the way to the inner room, where they found Amabel and
  her mother. At the sight of Leonard, the former instantly cast down her
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Amabel," said her father, in a tone of greater severity than he had ever
  before used towards her, "all that has passed is known to me. I shall take
  another and more fitting opportunity to speak to you on your ill-advised
  conduct. I am come for a different purpose. You have given Leonard Holt a
  promise (I need not tell you of what nature), and he claims its
  fulfilment."</p>

  <p>"If he insists upon my compliance," replied Amabel, in a tremulous voice,
  "I must obey. But it will make me wretched."</p>

  <p>"Then I at once release you," replied Leonard. "I value your happiness far
  more than my own."</p>

  <p>"You deserve better treatment, Leonard," said Bloundel; "and I am sorry my
  daughter cannot discern what is for her good. Let us hope that time will work
  a change in your favour."</p>

  <p>"No," replied the apprentice, bitterly; "I will no longer delude myself
  with any such vain expectation."</p>

  <p>"Amabel," observed the grocer, "as your father&mdash;as your
  wellwisher&mdash;I should desire to see you wedded to Leonard. But I have
  told your mother, and now tell you, that I will not control your
  inclinations, and will only attempt to direct you so far as I think likely to
  be conducive to your happiness. On another point, I must assume a very
  different tone. You can no longer plead ignorance of the designs of the
  depraved person who besets you. You may not be able to forget him&mdash;but
  you can avoid him. If you see him alone again&mdash;if but for a
  moment&mdash;I cast you off for ever. Yes, for ever," he repeated, with stern
  emphasis.</p>

  <p>"I will never voluntarily see him again," replied Amabel, tremblingly.</p>

  <p>"You have heard my determination," rejoined her father. "Do you still
  adhere to your resolution of remaining with me, Leonard?" he added, turning
  to the apprentice. "If what has just passed makes any alteration in your
  wishes, state so, frankly."</p>

  <p>"I will stay," replied Leonard.</p>

  <p>"There will be one advantage, which I did not foresee, in closing my
  house," remarked the grocer aside to the apprentice. "It will effectually
  keep away this libertine earl."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps so," replied the other. "But I have more faith in my own
  vigilance than in bolts and bars."</p>

  <p>Bloundel and Leonard then returned to the shop, where the former
  immediately began to make preparations for storing his house; and in the
  prosecution of his scheme he was greatly aided by the apprentice.</p>

  <p>The grocer's dwelling, as has been stated, was large and commodious. It
  was three stories high; and beneath the ground-floor there were kitchens and
  extensive cellars. Many of the rooms were spacious, and had curiously carved
  fireplaces, walls pannelled with fine brown oak, large presses, and
  cupboards.</p>

  <p>In the yard, at the back of the house, there was a pump, from which
  excellent water was obtained. There were likewise three large cisterns,
  supplied from the New River. Not satisfied with this, and anxious to obtain
  water in which no infected body could have lain, or clothes have been washed,
  Bloundel had a large tank placed within the cellar, and connecting it by
  pipes with the pump, he contrived an ingenious machine, by which he could
  work the latter from within the house&mdash;thus making sure of a constant
  supply of water direct from the spring.</p>

  <p>He next addressed himself to the front of the house, where he fixed a
  pulley, with a rope and hook attached to it, to the beam above one of the
  smaller bay windows on the second story. By this means, he could let down a
  basket or any other article into the street, or draw up whatever he desired;
  and as he proposed using this outlet as the sole means of communication with
  the external world when his house was closed, he had a wooden shutter made in
  the form of a trap-door, which he could open and shut at pleasure.</p>

  <p>Here it was his intention to station himself at certain hours of the day,
  and whenever he held any communication below, to flash off a pistol, so that
  the smoke of the powder might drive back the air, and purify any vapour that
  found entrance of its noxious particles.</p>

  <p>He laid down to himself a number of regulations, which will be more easily
  shown and more clearly understood, on arriving at the period when his plans
  came to be in full operation. To give an instance, however&mdash;if a letter
  should be conveyed to him by means of the pulley, he proposed to steep it in
  a solution of vinegar and sulphur; and when dried and otherwise fumigated, to
  read it at a distance by the help of strong glasses.</p>

  <p>In regard to provisions, after a careful calculation, he bought upwards of
  three thousand pounds' weight of hard sea-biscuits, similar to those now
  termed captain's biscuits, and had them stowed away in hogsheads. He next
  ordered twenty huge casks of the finest flour, which he had packed up with
  the greatest care, as if for a voyage to Barbadoes or Jamaica. As these were
  brought in through the yard an accident had well-nigh occurred which might
  have proved fatal to him. While superintending the labours of Leonard and
  Blaize, who were rolling the casks into the house&mdash;having stowed away as
  many as he conveniently could in the upper part of the premises&mdash;he
  descended to the cellar, and, opening a door at the foot of a flight of steps
  leading from the yard, called to them to lower the remaining barrels with
  ropes below. In the hurry, Blaize rolled a cask towards the open door, and in
  another instant it would have fallen upon the grocer, and perhaps have
  crushed him, but for the interposition of Leonard. Bloundel made no remark at
  the time; but he never forgot the service rendered him by the apprentice.</p>

  <p>To bake the bread required an oven, and he accordingly built one in the
  garret, laying in a large stock of wood for fuel. Neither did he neglect to
  provide himself with two casks of meal.</p>

  <p>But the most important consideration was butcher's meat; and for this
  purpose he went to Rotherhithe, where the plague had not yet appeared, and
  agreed with a butcher to kill him four fat bullocks, and pickle and barrel
  them as if for sea stores. He likewise directed the man to provide six large
  barrels of pickled pork, on the same understanding. These were landed at
  Queenhithe, and brought up to Wood-street, so that they passed for
  newly-landed grocery.</p>

  <p>Hams and bacon forming part of his own trade, he wrote to certain farmers
  with whom he was in the habit of dealing, to send him up an unlimited supply
  of flitches and gammons; and his orders being promptly and abundantly
  answered, he soon found he had more bacon than he could possibly consume. He
  likewise laid in a good store of tongues, hung beet, and other dried
  meats.</p>

  <p>As to wine, he already had a tolerable stock; but he increased it by half
  a hogshead of the best canary he could procure; two casks of malmsey, each
  containing twelve gallons; a quarter-cask of Malaga sack; a runlet of
  muscadine; two small runlets of aqua vitae; twenty gallons of aniseed water;
  and two eight-gallon runlets of brandy. To this he added six hogsheads of
  strongly-hopped Kent ale, calculated for keeping, which he placed in a cool
  cellar, together with three hogsheads of beer, for immediate use.
  Furthermore, he procured a variety of distilled waters for medicinal
  purposes, amongst which he included a couple of dozen of the then fashionable
  and costly preparation, denominated plague-water.</p>

  <p>As, notwithstanding all his precautions, it was not impossible that some
  of his household might be attacked by the distemper, he took care to provide
  proper remedies, and, to Blaize's infinite delight, furnished himself with
  mithridates, Venice treacle, diascorium, the pill rufus (oh! how the porter
  longed to have the key of the medicine chest!), London treacle, turpentine,
  and other matters. He likewise collected a number of herbs and simples; as
  Virginian snakeweed, contrajerva, pestilence-wort, angelica, elecampane,
  zedoary, tormentil, valerian, lovage, devils-bit, dittany, master-wort, rue,
  sage, ivy-berries, and walnuts; together with bole ammoniac, terra sigillata,
  bezoar-water, oil of sulphur, oil of vitriol, and other compounds. His store
  of remedies was completed by a tun of the best white-wine vinegar, and a
  dozen jars of salad-oil.</p>

  <p>Regulating his supplies by the provisions he had laid in, he purchased a
  sufficient stock of coals and fagots to last him during the whole period of
  his confinement; and he added a small barrel of gunpowder, and a like
  quantity of sulphur for fumigation.</p>

  <p>His eatables would not have been complete without cheese; and he therefore
  ordered about six hundredweight from Derbyshire, Wiltshire, and
  Leicestershire, besides a couple of large old cheeses from Rostherne, in
  Cheshire&mdash;even then noted for the best dairies in the whole county.
  Several tubs of salted butter were sent him out of Berkshire, and a few pots,
  from Suffolk.</p>

  <p>It being indispensable, considering the long period he meant to close his
  house, to provide himself and his family with every necessary, he procured a
  sufficient stock of wearing apparel, hose, shoes and boots. Spice, dried
  fruit, and other grocery articles, were not required, because he already
  possessed them. Candles also formed an article of his trade, and lamp-oil;
  but he was recommended by Doctor Hodges, from a fear of the scurvy, to
  provide a plentiful supply of lemon and lime juice.</p>

  <p>To guard against accident, he also doubly stocked his house with glass,
  earthenware, and every article liable to breakage. He destroyed all vermin,
  such as rats and mice, by which the house was infested; and the only live
  creatures he would suffer to be kept were a few poultry. He had a small hutch
  constructed near the street-door, to be used by the watchman he meant to
  employ; and he had the garrets fitted up with beds to form an hospital, if
  any part of the family should be seized with the distemper, so that the sick
  might be sequestered from the sound.</p>

     name="ch2-3">III. &mdash; THE QUACK DOCTORS.</a></h2>

  <p>Patience, it may be remembered, had promised Blaize to give him her
  earnings to enable him to procure a fresh supply of medicine, and about a
  week after he had received the trifling amount (for he had been so constantly
  employed by the grocer that he had no opportunity of getting out before), he
  sallied forth to visit a neighbouring apothecary, named Parkhurst, from whom
  he had been in the habit of purchasing drugs, and who occupied a small shop
  not far from the grocer's, on the opposite side of the street. Parkhurst
  appeared overjoyed to see him, and, without giving him time to prefer his own
  request, inquired after his master's family&mdash;whether they were all well,
  especially fair Mistress Amabel&mdash;and, further, what was the meaning of
  the large supplies of provision which he saw daily conveyed to the premises?
  Blaize shook his head at the latter question, and for some time refused to
  answer it. But being closely pressed by Parkhurst, he admitted that his
  master was about to shut up his house.</p>

  <p>"Shut up his house!" exclaimed Parkhurst. "I never heard of such a
  preposterous idea. If he does so, not one of you will come out alive. But I
  should hope that he will be dissuaded from his rash design."</p>

  <p>"Dissuaded!" echoed Blaize. "You don't know my master. He's as obstinate
  as a mule when he takes a thing into his head. Nothing will turn him.
  Besides, Doctor Hodges sanctions and even recommends the plan."</p>

  <p>"I have no opinion of Doctor Hodges," sneered the apothecary. "He is not
  fit to hold a candle before a learned friend of mine, a physician, who is now
  in that room. The person I speak of thoroughly understands the pestilence,
  and never fails to cure every case that comes before him. No shutting up
  houses with him. He is in possession of an infallible remedy."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" exclaimed Blaize, pricking up his ears. "What is his name?"</p>

  <p>"His name!" cried Parkhurst, with a puzzled look. "How strange it should
  slip my memory! Ah, now I recollect. It is Doctor Calixtus Bottesham."</p>

  <p>"A singular name, truly," remarked Blaize; "but it sounds like that of a
  clever man."</p>

  <p>"Doctor Calixtus Bottesham is a wonderful man," returned the apothecary.
  "I have never met with his like. I would trumpet forth his merits through the
  whole city, but that it would ruin my trade. The plague is our harvest, as my
  friend Chowles, the coffin-maker, says, and it will not do to stop
  it&mdash;ha! ha!"</p>

  <p>"It is too serious a subject to laugh at," returned Blaize, gravely. "But
  are the doctor's fees exorbitant?"</p>

  <p>"To the last degree," replied Parkhurst. "I am afraid to state how much he
  asks."</p>

  <p>"I fear I shall not be able to consult him, then," said Blaize, turning
  over the coin in his pocket; "and yet I should greatly like to do so."</p>

  <p>"Have no fear on that score," returned the apothecary. "I have been able
  to render him an important service, and he will do anything for me. He shall
  give you his advice gratis."</p>

  <p>"Thank you! thank you!" cried Blaize, transported with delight.</p>

  <p>"Wait here a moment, and I will ascertain whether he will see you,"
  replied Parkhurst.</p>

  <p>So saying, he quitted the porter, who amused himself during his absence by
  studying the labels affixed to the jars and bottles on the shelves. He had
  much ado to restrain himself from opening some of them, and tasting their
  contents.</p>

  <p>Full a quarter of an hour elapsed before the apothecary appeared.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to have detained you so long," he said; "but I had more
  difficulty with the doctor than I expected, and for some time he refused to
  see you on any terms, because he has a violent antipathy to Doctor Hodges,
  whom he regards as a mere pretender, and whose patient he conceives you to
  be."</p>

  <p>"I am not Doctor Hodges' patient," returned Blaize; "and I regard him as a
  pretender myself."</p>

  <p>"That opinion will recommend you to Doctor Bottesham," replied Parkhurst;
  "and since I have smoothed the way for you, you will find him very affable
  and condescending. He has often heard me speak of your master; and if it were
  not for his dislike of Doctor Hodges, whom he might accidentally encounter,
  he would call upon him."</p>

  <p>"I wish I could get my master to employ him instead of the other," said
  Blaize.</p>

  <p>"I wish so too," cried Parkhurst, eagerly. "Do you think it could be
  managed?"</p>

  <p>"I fear not," returned Blaize.</p>

  <p>"There would be no harm in making the trial," replied Parkhurst. "But you
  shall now see the learned gentleman. I ought to apprise you that he has two
  friends with him&mdash;one a young gallant, named Hawkswood, whom he has
  recently cured of the distemper, and who is so much attached to him that he
  never leaves him; the other, a doctor, like himself, named Martin Furbisher,
  who always accompanies him in his visits to his patients, and prepares his
  mixtures for him. You must not be surprised at their appearance. And now come
  with me."</p>

  <p>With this, he led the way into a small room at the back of the shop, where
  three personages were seated at the table, with a flask of wine and glasses
  before them. Blaize detected Doctor Bottesham at a glance. He was an
  ancient-looking man, clad in a suit of rusty black, over which was thrown a
  velvet robe, very much soiled and faded, but originally trimmed with fur, and
  lined with yellow silk. His powers of vision appeared to be feeble, for he
  wore a large green shade over his eyes, and a pair of spectacles of the same
  colour. A venerable white beard descended almost to his waist. His head was
  protected by a long flowing grey wig, over which he wore a black velvet cap.
  His shoulders were high and round, his back bent, and he evidently required
  support when he moved, as a crutch-headed staff was reared against his chair.
  On his left was a young, handsome, and richly-attired gallant, answering to
  the apothecary's description of Hawkswood; and on the right sat a stout
  personage precisely habited like himself, except that he wore a broad-leaved
  hat, which completely overshadowed his features. Notwithstanding this attempt
  at concealment, it was easy to perceive that Doctor Furbisher's face was
  covered with scars, that he had a rubicund nose, studded with carbuncles, and
  a black patch over his left eye.</p>

  <p>"Is this the young man who desires to consult me?" asked Doctor Calixtus
  Bottesham, in the cracked and quavering voice of old age, of Parkhurst.</p>

  <p>"It is," replied the apothecary, respectfully. "Go forward," he added to
  Blaize, "and speak for yourself."</p>

  <p>"What ails you?" pursued Bottesham, gazing at him through his spectacles.
  "You look strong and hearty."</p>

  <p>"So I am, learned sir," replied Blaize, bowing to the ground; "but
  understanding from Mr. Parkhurst that you have an infallible remedy against
  the plague, I would gladly procure it from you, as, if I should be attacked,
  I may not have an opportunity of consulting you."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" demanded Bottesham. "I will come to you if you send for
  me."</p>

  <p>"Because," replied Blaize, after a moment's hesitation, "my master is
  about to shut up his house, and no one will be allowed to go forth, or to
  enter it, till the pestilence is at an end."</p>

  <p>"Your master must be mad to think of such a thing," rejoined Bottesham.
  "What say you, brother Furbisher?&mdash;is that the way to keep off the
  plague?"</p>

  <p>"Gallipots of Galen! no," returned the other; "it is rather the way to
  invite its assaults."</p>

  <p>"When does your master talk of putting this fatal design&mdash;for fatal
  it will be to him and all his household&mdash;into execution?" demanded
  Bottesham.</p>

  <p>"Very shortly, I believe," replied Blaize. "He meant to begin on the first
  of June, but as the pestilence is less violent than it was, Doctor Hodges has
  induced him to defer his purpose for a few days."</p>

  <p>"Doctor Hodges!" exclaimed Bottesham, contemptuously. "It was an
  unfortunate day for your master when he admitted that sack-drinking impostor
  into his house."</p>

  <p>"I have no great opinion of his skill," replied Blaize, "but,
  nevertheless, it must be admitted that he cured Master Stephen in a wonderful
  manner."</p>

  <p>"Pshaw!" exclaimed Bottesham, "that was mere accident. I heard the
  particulars of the case from Parkhurst, and am satisfied the youth would have
  recovered without his aid. But what a barbarian Mr. Bloundel must be to think
  of imprisoning his family in this way!"</p>

  <p>"He certainly does not consult my inclinations in the matter," returned
  Blaize.</p>

  <p>"Nor those of his wife and daughter, I should imagine," continued
  Bottesham. "How do <i>they</i> like it?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot exactly say," answered Blaize. "What a dreadful thing it would
  be if I should be attacked by the plague, and no assistance could be
  procured!"</p>

  <p>"It would be still more dreadful if so angelic a creature as Bloundel's
  daughter is represented to be&mdash;for I have never seen her&mdash;should be
  so seized," observed Bottesham. "I feel so much interested about her that I
  would do anything to preserve her from the fate with which she is
  menaced."</p>

  <p>"Were it not inconsistent with your years, learned sir, I might suspect
  you of a tenderer feeling towards her," observed Blaize, archly. "But, in
  good sooth, her charms are so extraordinary, that I should not be surprised
  at any effect they might produce."</p>

  <p>"They would produce no effect on me," replied Bottesham. "I am long past
  such feelings. But in regard to yourself. You say you are afraid of the
  plague. I will give you an electuary to drive away the panic;" and he
  produced a small jar, and handed it to the porter. "It is composed of
  conserve of roses, gillyflowers, borage, candied citron, powder of
  <i>laetificans Galeni</i>, Roman zedoary, doronicum, and saffron. You must
  take about the quantity of a large nutmeg, morning and evening."</p>

  <p>"You make me for ever your debtor, learned sir," rejoined Blaize. "What a
  charming mixture!"</p>

  <p>"I will also add my remedy," said Furbisher. "It is a powder compounded of
  crabs' eyes, burnt hartshorn, the black tops of crabs' claws, the bone from a
  stag's heart, unicorn's horn, and salt of vipers. You must take one or two
  drams&mdash;not more&mdash;in a glass of hot posset-drink, when you go to
  bed, and swallow another draught of the same potion to wash it down."</p>

  <p>"I will carefully observe your directions," replied Blaize, thankfully
  receiving the powder.</p>

  <p>"Of all things," said Bottesham, claiming the porter's attention by
  tapping him on the head with his cane, "take care never to be without
  vinegar. It is the grand specific, not merely against the plague, but against
  all disorders. It is food and physic, meat and medicine, drink and julep,
  cordial and antidote. If you formerly took it as a sauce, now take it as a
  remedy. To the sound it is a preservative from sickness, to the sick, a
  restorative to health. It is like the sword which is worn not merely for
  ornament, but for defence. Vinegar is my remedy against the plague. It is a
  simple remedy, but an effectual one. I have cured a thousand patients with
  it, and hope to cure a thousand more. Take vinegar with all you eat, and
  flavour all you drink with it. Has the plague taken away your appetite,
  vinegar will renew it. Is your throat ulcerated, use vinegar as a gargle. Are
  you disturbed with phlegmatic humours, vinegar will remove them. Is your
  brain laden with vapours, throw vinegar on a hot shovel, and inhale its
  fumes, and you will obtain instantaneous relief. Have you the headache, wet a
  napkin in vinegar, and apply it to your temples, and the pain will cease. In
  short, there is no ailment that vinegar will not cure. It is the grand
  panacea; and may be termed the elixir of long life."</p>

  <p>"I wonder its virtues have not been found out before," observed Blaize,
  innocently.</p>

  <p>"It is surprising how slow men are in discovering the most obvious
  truths," replied Bottesham. "But take my advice, and never be without
  it."</p>

  <p>"I never will," returned Blaize. "Heaven be praised, my master has just
  ordered in three tuns. I'll tap one of them directly."</p>

  <p>"That idea of the vinegar remedy is borrowed from Kemp's late treatise on
  the pestilence and its cure," muttered Furbisher. "Before you enter upon the
  new system, young man," he added aloud to Blaize, "let me recommend you to
  fortify your stomach with a glass of canary."</p>

  <p>And pouring out a bumper, he handed it to the porter, who swallowed it at
  a draught.</p>

  <p>"And now," said Bottesham, "to return to this mad scheme of your
  master's&mdash;is there no way of preventing it?"</p>

  <p>"I am aware of none," replied Blaize.</p>

  <p>"Bolts and bars!" cried Furbisher, "something must be done for the fair
  Amabel. We owe it to society not to permit so lovely a creature to be thus
  immured. What say you, Hawkswood?" he added to the gallant by his side, who
  had not hitherto spoken.</p>

  <p>"It would be unpardonable to permit it&mdash;quite unpardonable," replied
  this person.</p>

  <p>"Might not some plan be devised to remove her for a short time, and
  frighten him out of his project?" said Bottesham. "I would willingly assist
  in such a scheme. I pledge you in a bumper, young man. You appear a trusty
  servant."</p>

  <p>"I am so accounted, learned sir," replied Blaize, upon whose brain the
  wine thus plentifully bestowed began to operate&mdash;"and I may add, justly
  so."</p>

  <p>"You really will be doing your master a service if you can prevent him
  from committing this folly," rejoined Bottesham.</p>

  <p>"Let us have a bottle of burnt malmsey, with a few bruised raisins in it,
  Mr. Parkhurst. This poor young man requires support. Be seated, friend."</p>

  <p>With some hesitation, Blaize complied, and while the apothecary went in
  search of the wine, he observed to Bottesham, "I would gladly comply with
  your suggestion, learned sir, if I saw any means of doing so."</p>

  <p>"Could you not pretend to have the plague?" said Bottesham. "I could then
  attend you."</p>

  <p>"I should be afraid of playing such a trick as that," replied Blaize.
  "Besides, I do not see what purpose it would answer."</p>

  <p>"It would enable me to get into the house," returned Bottesham, "and then
  I might take measures for Amabel's deliverance."</p>

  <p>"If you merely wish to get into the house," replied Blaize, "that can be
  easily managed. I will admit you this evening."</p>

  <p>"Without your master's knowledge?" asked Bottesham, eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Of course," returned Blaize.</p>

  <p>"But he has an apprentice?" said the doctor.</p>

  <p>"Oh! you mean Leonard Holt," replied Blaize. "Yes, we must take care he
  doesn't see you. If you come about nine o'clock, he will be engaged with my
  master in putting away the things in the shop."</p>

  <p>"I will be punctual," replied Bottesham, "and will bring Doctor Furbisher
  with me. We will only stay a few minutes. But here comes the burnt malmsey.
  Fill the young man's glass, Parkhurst. I will insure you against the plague,
  if you will follow my advice."</p>

  <p>"But will you insure me against my master's displeasure, if he finds me
  out?" said Blaize.</p>

  <p>"I will provide you with a new one," returned Bottesham. "You shall serve
  me if you wish to change your place."</p>

  <p>"That would answer my purpose exactly," thought Blaize. "I need never be
  afraid of the plague if I live with him. I will turn over your proposal,
  learned sir," he added, aloud.</p>

  <p>After priming him with another bumper of malmsey, Blaise's new friends
  suffered him to depart. On returning home, he proceeded to his own room, and
  feeling unusually drowsy, he threw himself on the bed, and almost instantly
  dropped asleep. When he awoke, the fumes of the liquor had, in a great
  degree, evaporated, and he recalled, with considerable self-reproach, the
  promise he had given, and would gladly have recalled it, if it had been
  possible. But it was now not far from the appointed hour, and he momentarily
  expected the arrival of the two doctors. The only thing that consoled him was
  the store of medicine he had obtained, and, locking it up in his cupboard, he
  descended to the kitchen. Fortunately, his mother was from home, so that he
  ran no risk from her; and, finding Patience alone, after some hesitation, he
  let her into the secret of his anticipated visitors. She was greatly
  surprised, and expressed much uneasiness lest they should be discovered; as,
  if they were so, it would be sure to bring them both into trouble.</p>

  <p>"What can they want with Mistress Amabel?" she cried. "I should not wonder
  if Doctor Calixtus Bottesham, as you call him, turns out a lover in
  disguise."</p>

  <p>"A lover!" exclaimed Blaize. "Your silly head is always running upon
  lovers. He's an old man&mdash;old enough to be your grandfather, with a long
  white beard, reaching to his waist. He a lover! Mr. Bloundel is much more
  like one."</p>

  <p>"For all that, it looks suspicious," returned Patience; "and I shall have
  my eyes about me on their arrival."</p>

  <p>Shortly after this, Blaize crept cautiously up to the back yard, and,
  opening the door, found, as he expected, Bottesham and his companion.
  Motioning them to follow him, he led the way to the kitchen, where they
  arrived without observation. Patience eyed the new-comers narrowly, and felt
  almost certain, from their appearance and manner, that her suspicions were
  correct. All doubts were removed when Bottesham, slipping a purse into her
  hand, entreated her, on some plea or other, to induce Amabel to come into the
  kitchen. At first she hesitated; but having a tender heart, inclining her to
  assist rather than oppose the course of any love-affair, her scruples were
  soon overcome. Accordingly she hurried upstairs, and chancing to meet with
  her young mistress, who was about to retire to her own chamber, entreated her
  to come down with her for a moment in the kitchen. Thinking it some
  unimportant matter, but yet wondering why Patience should appear so urgent,
  Amabel complied. She was still more perplexed when she saw the two strangers,
  and would have instantly retired if Bottesham had not detained her.</p>

  <p>"You will pardon the liberty I have taken in sending for you," he said,
  "when I explain that I have done so to offer you counsel."</p>

  <p>"I am as much at a loss to understand what counsel you can have to offer,
  sir, as to guess why you are here," she replied.</p>

  <p>"Amabel," returned Bottesham, in a low tone, but altering his voice, and
  slightly raising his spectacles so as to disclose his features; "it is
  I&mdash;Maurice Wyvil."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" she exclaimed, in the utmost astonishment.</p>

  <p>"I told you we should meet again," he rejoined; "and I have kept my
  word."</p>

  <p>"Think not to deceive me, my lord," she returned, controlling her emotion
  by a powerful effort. "I am aware you are not Maurice Wyvil, but the Earl of
  Rochester. Your love is as false as your character. Mistress Mallet is the
  real object of your regards. You see I am acquainted with your perfidy."</p>

  <p>"Amabel, you are deceived," replied Rochester. "On my soul, you are. When
  I have an opportunity of explaining myself more fully, I will prove to you
  that I was induced by the king, for an especial purpose, to pay feigned
  addresses to the lady you have named. But I never loved her. You alone are
  the possessor of my heart, and shall be the sharer of my title. You shall be
  Countess of Rochester."</p>

  <p>"Could I believe you?" she cried.</p>

  <p>"You <i>may</i> believe me," he answered. "Do not blight my hopes and your
  own happiness a second time. Your father is about to shut up his house for a
  twelvemonth, if the plague lasts so long. This done, we shall meet no more,
  for access to you will be impossible. Do not hesitate, or you will for ever
  rue your irresolution."</p>

  <p>"I know not what to do," cried Amabel, distractedly.</p>

  <p>"Then I will decide for you," replied the earl, grasping her hand.
  "Come!"</p>

  <p>While this was passing, Furbisher, or rather, as will be surmised,
  Pillichody, had taken Blaize aside, and engaged his attention by dilating
  upon the efficacy of a roasted onion filled with treacle in the expulsion of
  the plague. Patience stationed herself near the door, not with a view of
  interfering with the lovers, but rather of assisting them; and at the very
  moment that the earl seized his mistress's hand, and would have drawn her
  forward, she ran towards them, and hastily whispered, "Leonard Holt is coming
  downstairs."</p>

  <p>"Ah! I am lost!" cried Amabel.</p>

  <p>"Fear nothing," said the earl. "Keep near me, and I will soon dispose of
  him."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, the apprentice entered the kitchen, and, greatly surprised by
  the appearance of the strangers, angrily demanded from Blaize who they
  were.</p>

  <p>"They are two doctors come to give me advice respecting the plague,"
  stammered the porter.</p>

  <p>"How did they get into the house?" inquired Leonard.</p>

  <p>"I let them in through the back door," replied Blaize.</p>

  <p>"Then let them out by the same way," rejoined the apprentice. "May I ask
  what you are doing here?" he added, to Amabel.</p>

  <p>"What is that to you, fellow?" cried Rochester, in his assumed voice.</p>

  <p>"Much, as you shall find, my lord," replied the apprentice; "for, in spite
  of your disguise, I know you. Quit the house instantly with your companion,
  or I will give the alarm, and Amabel well knows what the consequences will
  be."</p>

  <p>"You must go, my lord," she replied.</p>

  <p>"I will not stir unless you accompany me," said Rochester.</p>

  <p>"Then I have no alternative," rejoined Leonard. "You know your father's
  determination&mdash;I would willingly spare you, Amabel."</p>

  <p>"Oh, goodness! what <i>will</i> become of us?" cried Patience&mdash;"if
  there isn't Mr. Bloundel coming downstairs."</p>

  <p>"Amabel," said Leonard, sternly, "the next moment decides your fate. If
  the earl departs, I will keep your secret."</p>

  <p>"You hear that, my lord," she cried; "I command you to leave me."</p>

  <p>And disengaging herself from him, and hastily passing her father, who at
  that moment entered the kitchen, she rushed upstairs.</p>

  <p>On hearing the alarm of the grocer's approach, Pillichody took refuge in a
  cupboard, the door of which stood invitingly open, so that Bloundel only
  perceived the earl.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter?" he cried, gazing around him. "Whom have we
  here?"</p>

  <p>"It is a quack doctor, whom Blaize has been consulting about the plague,"
  returned Leonard.</p>

  <p>"See him instantly out of the house," rejoined the grocer, angrily, "and
  take care he never enters it again. I will have no such charlatans here."</p>

  <p>Leonard motioned Rochester to follow him, and the latter reluctantly
  obeyed.</p>

  <p>As soon as Bloundel had retired, Leonard, who had meanwhile provided
  himself with his cudgel, descended to the kitchen, where he dragged
  Pillichody from his hiding-place, and conducted him to the back door. But he
  did not suffer him to depart without belabouring him soundly. Locking the
  door, he then went in search of Blaize, and administered a similar
  chastisement to him.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch2-4"
     name="ch2-4">IV. &mdash; THE TWO WATCHMEN.</a></h2>

  <p>On the day following the events last related, as Leonard Holt was standing
  at the door of the shop,&mdash;his master having just been called out by some
  important business,&mdash;a man in the dress of a watchman, with a halberd in
  his hand, approached him, and inquired if he was Mr. Bloundel's
  apprentice.</p>

  <p>Before returning an answer, Leonard looked hard at the newcomer, and
  thought he had never beheld so ill-favoured a person before. Every feature in
  his face was distorted. His mouth was twisted on one side, his nose on the
  other, while his right eyebrow was elevated more than an inch above the left;
  added to which he squinted intolerably, had a long fell of straight sandy
  hair, a sandy beard and moustache, and a complexion of the colour of
  brickdust.</p>

  <p>"An ugly dog," muttered Leonard to himself, as he finished his scrutiny;
  "what can he want with me? Suppose I should be Mr. Bloundel's apprentice," he
  added, aloud, "what then, friend?"</p>

  <p>"Your master has a beautiful daughter, has he not?" asked the ill-favoured
  watchman.</p>

  <p>"I answer no idle questions," rejoined Leonard, coldly.</p>

  <p>"As you please," returned the other, in an offended tone. "A plan to carry
  her off has accidentally come to my knowledge. But, since incivility is all I
  am likely to get for my pains in coming to acquaint you with it, e'en find it
  out yourself."</p>

  <p>"Hold!" cried the apprentice, detaining him; "I meant no offence. Step
  indoors for a moment. We can converse there more freely."</p>

  <p>The watchman, who, notwithstanding his ill-looks, appeared to be a
  good-natured fellow, was easily appeased. Following the apprentice into the
  shop, on the promise of a handsome reward, he instantly commenced his
  relation.</p>

  <p>"Last night," he said, "I was keeping watch at the door of Mr. Brackley, a
  saddler in Aldermanbury, whose house having been attacked by the pestilence
  is now shut up, when I observed two persons, rather singularly attired, pass
  me. Both were dressed like old men, but neither their gait nor tone of voice
  corresponded with their garb."</p>

  <p>"It must have been the Earl of Rochester and his companion," remarked
  Leonard.</p>

  <p>"You are right," replied the other; "for I afterwards heard one of them
  addressed by that title. But to proceed. I was so much struck by the
  strangeness of their appearance, that I left my post for a few minutes, and
  followed them. They halted beneath a gateway, and, as they conversed together
  very earnestly, and in a loud tone, I could distinctly hear what they said.
  One of them, the stoutest of the two, complained bitterly of the indignities
  he had received from Mr. Bloundel's apprentice (meaning you, of course),
  averring that nothing but his devotion to his companion had induced him to
  submit to them; and affirming, with many tremendous oaths, that he would
  certainly cut the young man's throat the very first opportunity."</p>

  <p>"He shall not want it then," replied Leonard contemptuously; "neither
  shall he lack a second application of my cudgel when we meet. But what of his
  companion? What did he say?"</p>

  <p>"He laughed heartily at the other's complaints," returned the watchman,
  "and told him to make himself easy, for he should soon have his revenge.
  'To-morrow night,' he said, 'we will carry off Amabel, in spite of the
  apprentice or her father; and, as I am equally indebted with yourself to the
  latter, we will pay off old scores with him.'"</p>

  <p>"How do they intend to effect their purpose?" demanded Leonard.</p>

  <p>"That I cannot precisely tell," replied the watchman. "All I could hear
  was, that they meant to enter the house by the back yard about midnight. And
  now, if you will make it worth my while, I will help you to catch them in
  their own trap."</p>

  <p>"Hum!" said Leonard. "What is your name?"</p>

  <p>"Gregory Swindlehurst," replied the other.</p>

  <p>"To help me, you must keep watch with me to-night," rejoined Leonard. "Can
  you do so?"</p>

  <p>"I see nothing to hinder me, provided I am paid for my trouble," replied
  Gregory. "I will find some one to take my place at Mr. Brackley's. At what
  hour shall I come?"</p>

  <p>"Soon after ten," said Leonard. "Be at the shop-door, and I will let you
  in."</p>

  <p>"Count upon me," rejoined Gregory, a smile of satisfaction illumining his
  ill-favoured countenance. "Shall I bring a comrade with me? I know a trusty
  fellow who would like the job. If Lord Rochester should have his companions
  with him, assistance will be required."</p>

  <p>"True," replied Leonard. "Is your comrade a watchman, like yourself?"</p>

  <p>"He is an old soldier, who has been lately employed to keep guard over
  infected houses," replied Gregory. "We must take care his lordship does not
  overreach us."</p>

  <p>"If he gets into the house without my knowledge, I will forgive him,"
  replied the apprentice.</p>

  <p>"He won't get into it without mine," muttered Gregory, significantly. "But
  do you not mean to warn Mistress Amabel of her danger?"</p>

  <p>"I shall consider of it," replied the apprentice.</p>

  <p>At this moment Mr. Bloundel entered the shop, and Leonard, feigning to
  supply his companion with a small packet of grocery, desired him, in a low
  tone, to be punctual to his appointment, and dismissed him. In justice to the
  apprentice, it must be stated that he had no wish for concealment, but was
  most anxious to acquaint his master with the information he had just
  obtained, and was only deterred from doing so by a dread of the consequences
  it might produce to Amabel.</p>

  <p>The evening passed off much as usual. The family assembled at prayer; and.
  Blaize, whose shoulders still ached with the chastisement he had received,
  eyed the apprentice with sullen and revengeful looks. Patience, too, was
  equally angry, and her indignation was evinced in a manner so droll, that at
  another season it would have drawn a smile from Leonard.</p>

  <p>Supper over, Amabel left the room. Leonard followed her, and overtook her
  on the landing of the stairs.</p>

  <p>"Amabel," he said, "I have received certain intelligence that the Earl of
  Rochester will make another attempt to enter the house, and carry you off
  to-night."</p>

  <p>"Oh! when will he cease from persecuting me?" she cried.</p>

  <p>"When you cease to encourage him," replied the apprentice, bitterly.</p>

  <p>"I do <i>not</i> encourage him, Leonard," she rejoined, "and to prove that
  I do not, I will act in any way you think proper tonight."</p>

  <p>"If I could trust you," said Leonard, you might be of the greatest service
  in convincing the earl that his efforts are fruitless."</p>

  <p>"You <i>may</i> trust me," she rejoined.</p>

  <p>"Well, then," returned Leonard, "when the family have retired to rest,
  come downstairs, and I will tell you what to do."</p>

  <p>Hastily promising compliance, Amabel disappeared; and Leonard ran down the
  stairs, at the foot of which he encountered Mrs. Bloundel.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Nothing&mdash;nothing," replied the apprentice, evasively.</p>

  <p>"That-will not serve my turn," she rejoined. "Something, I am certain,
  troubles you, though you do not choose to confess it. Heaven grant your
  anxiety is not occasioned by aught relating to that wicked Earl of Rochester!
  I cannot sleep in my bed for thinking of him. I noticed that you followed
  Amabel out of the room. I hope you do not suspect anything."</p>

  <p>"Do not question me further, madam, I entreat," returned the apprentice.
  "Whatever I may suspect, I have taken all needful precautions. Rest easy, and
  sleep soundly, if you can. All will go well."</p>

  <p>"I shall never rest easy, Leonard," rejoined Mrs. Bloundel, "till you are
  wedded to my daughter. Then, indeed, I shall feel happy. My poor child, I am
  sure, is fully aware how indiscreet her conduct has been; and when this noble
  libertine desists from annoying her&mdash;or rather, when he is effectually
  shut out&mdash;we may hope for a return of her regard for you."</p>

  <p>"It is a vain hope, madam," replied Leonard; "there will be no such
  return. I neither expect it nor desire it."</p>

  <p>"Have you ceased to love her?" asked Mrs. Bloundel, in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Ceased to love her!" echoed Leonard, fiercely. "Would I had done
  so!&mdash;would I <i>could</i> do so! I love her too well&mdash;too
  well."</p>

  <p>And repeating the words to himself with great bitterness, he hurried
  away.</p>

  <p>"His passion has disturbed his brain," sighed Mrs. Bloundel, as she
  proceeded to her chamber. "I must try to reason him into calmness
  to-morrow."</p>

  <p>Half an hour after this, the grocer retired for the night; and Leonard,
  who had gone to his own room, cautiously opened the door, and repaired to the
  shop. On the way he met Amabel. She looked pale as death, and trembled so
  violently, that she could scarcely support herself.</p>

  <p>"I hope you do not mean to use any violence towards the earl, Leonard?"
  she said in a supplicating voice.</p>

  <p>"He will never repeat his visit," rejoined the apprentice, gloomily.</p>

  <p>"Your looks terrify me," cried Amabel, gazing with great uneasiness at his
  stern and determined countenance. "I will remain by you. He will depart at my
  bidding."</p>

  <p>"Did he depart at your bidding before?" demanded Leonard,
  sarcastically.</p>

  <p>"He did not, I grant," she replied, more supplicatingly than before. "But
  do not harm him&mdash;for mercy's sake, do not&mdash;take my life sooner. I
  alone have offended you."</p>

  <p>The apprentice made no reply, but, unlocking a box, took out a brace of
  large horse-pistols and a sword, and thrust them into his girdle.</p>

  <p>"You do not mean to use those murderous weapons?" cried Amabel.</p>

  <p>"It depends on circumstances," replied Leonard. "Force must be met by
  force."</p>

  <p>"Nay, then," she rejoined, "the affair assumes too serious an aspect to be
  trifled with. I will instantly alarm my father."</p>

  <p>"Do so," retorted Leonard, "and he will cast you off for ever."</p>

  <p>"Better that, than be the cause of bloodshed," she returned. "But is there
  nothing I can do to prevent this fatal result?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Leonard. "Make your lover understand he is unwelcome to
  you. Dismiss him for ever. On that condition, he shall depart unharmed and
  freely."</p>

  <p>"I will do so," she rejoined.</p>

  <p>Nothing more was then said. Amabel seated herself and kept her eyes fixed
  on Leonard, who, avoiding her regards, stationed himself near the door.</p>

  <p>By-and-by a slight tap was heard without, and the apprentice cautiously
  admitted Gregory Swindlehurst and his comrade. The latter was habited like
  the other watchman, in a blue night-rail, and was armed with a halberd. He
  appeared much stouter, much older, and, so far as could be discovered of his
  features&mdash;for a large handkerchief muffled his face&mdash;much uglier
  (if that were possible) than his companion. He answered to the name of
  Bernard Boutefeu. They had no sooner entered the shop, than Leonard locked
  the door.</p>

  <p>"Who are these persons?" asked Amabel, rising in great alarm.</p>

  <p>"Two watchmen whom I have hired to guard the house," replied Leonard.</p>

  <p>"We are come to protect you, fair mistress," said Gregory, "and, if need
  be, to cut the Earl of Rochester's throat."</p>

  <p>"Oh heavens!" exclaimed Amabel.</p>

  <p>"Ghost of Tarquin!" cried Boutefeu, "we'll teach him to break into the
  houses of quiet citizens, and attempt to carry off their daughters against
  their will. By the soul of Dick Whittington, Lord Mayor of London! we'll maul
  and mangle him."</p>

  <p>"Silence! Bernard Boutefeu," interposed Gregory. "You frighten Mistress
  Amabel by your strange oaths."</p>

  <p>"I should be sorry to do that," replied Boutefeu&mdash;"I only wish to
  show my zeal for her. Don't be afraid of the Earl of Rochester, fair
  mistress. With all his audacity, he won't dare to enter the house when he
  finds we are there."</p>

  <p>"Is it your pleasure that we should thrust a halberd through his body, or
  lodge a bullet in his brain?" asked Gregory, appealing to Amabel.</p>

  <p>"Touch him not, I beseech you," she rejoined. "Leonard, I have your
  promise that, if I can prevail upon him to depart, you will not molest
  him."</p>

  <p>"You have," he replied.</p>

  <p>"You hear that," she observed to the watchmen.</p>

  <p>"We are all obedience," said Gregory.</p>

  <p>"Bless your tender heart!" cried Boutefeu, "we would not pain you for the
  world."</p>

  <p>"A truce to this," said Leonard. "Come to the yard, we will wait for him
  there."</p>

  <p>"I will go with you," cried Amabel. "If any harm should befall him, I
  should never forgive myself."</p>

  <p>"Remember what I told you," rejoined Leonard, sternly; "it depends upon
  yourself whether he leaves the house alive."</p>

  <p>"Heed him not," whispered Gregory. "I and my comrade will obey no one but
  you."</p>

  <p>Amabel could not repress an exclamation of surprise.</p>

  <p>"What are you muttering, sirrah?" demanded Leonard, angrily.</p>

  <p>"Only that the young lady may depend on our fidelity," replied Gregory.
  "There can be no offence in that. Come with us," he whispered to Amabel.</p>

  <p>The latter part of his speech escaped Leonard, but the tone in which it
  was uttered was so significant, that Amabel, who began to entertain new
  suspicions, hesitated.</p>

  <p>"You must come," said Leonard, seizing her hand.</p>

  <p>"The fault be his, not mine," murmured Amabel, as she suffered herself to
  be drawn along.</p>

  <p>The party then proceeded noiselessly towards the yard. On the way, Amabel
  felt a slight pressure on her arm, but, afraid of alarming Leonard, she made
  no remark.</p>

  <p>The back-door was opened, and the little group stood in the darkness. They
  had not long to wait. Before they had been in the yard five minutes, a noise
  was heard of footsteps and muttered voices in the entry. This was followed by
  a sound like that occasioned by fastening a rope-ladder against the wall, and
  the next moment two figures were perceived above it. After dropping the
  ladder into the yard, these persons, the foremost of whom the apprentice
  concluded was the Earl of Rochester, descended. They had no sooner touched
  the ground than Leonard, drawing his pistols, advanced towards them.</p>

  <p>"You are my prisoner, my lord," he said, in a stern voice, "and shall not
  depart with life, unless you pledge your word never to come hither again on
  the same errand."</p>

  <p>"Betrayed!" cried the earl, laying his hand upon his sword.</p>

  <p>"Resistance is in vain, my lord," rejoined Leonard. "I am better armed
  than yourself."</p>

  <p>"Will nothing bribe you to silence, fellow?" cried the earl. "I will give
  you a thousand pounds, if you will hold your tongue, and conduct me to my
  mistress."</p>

  <p>"I can scarcely tell what stays my hand," returned Leonard, in a furious
  tone. "But I will hold no further conversation with you. Amabel is present,
  and will give you your final dismissal herself."</p>

  <p>"If I receive it from her own lips," replied the earl, "I will instantly
  retire&mdash;but not otherwise."</p>

  <p>"Amabel," said Leonard in a low tone to her, "you hear what is said.
  Fulfil your promise."</p>

  <p>"Do so," cried a voice, which she instantly recognised, in her
  ear&mdash;"I am near you."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Do you hesitate?" cried the apprentice, sternly.</p>

  <p>"My lord," said Amabel, in a faint voice, "I must pray you to retire, your
  efforts are in vain. I will never fly with you."</p>

  <p>"That will not suffice," whispered Leonard; "you must tell him you no
  longer love him."</p>

  <p>"Hear me," pursued Amabel; "you who present yourself as Lord Rochester, I
  entertain no affection for you, and never wish to behold you again."</p>

  <p>"Enough!" cried Leonard.</p>

  <p>"Admirable!" whispered Gregory. "Nothing could be better."</p>

  <p>"Well," cried the supposed earl, "since I no longer hold a place in your
  affections, it would be idle to pursue the matter further. Heaven be praised,
  there are other damsels quite as beautiful, though not so cruel. Farewell for
  ever, Amabel."</p>

  <p>So saying he mounted the ladder, and, followed by his companion,
  disappeared on the other side.</p>

  <p>"He is gone," said Leonard, "and I hope for ever. Now let us return to the
  house."</p>

  <p>"I am coming," rejoined Amabel.</p>

  <p>"Let him go," whispered Gregory. "The ladder is still upon the wall; we
  will climb it."</p>

  <p>And as the apprentice moved towards the house, he tried to drag her in
  that direction.</p>

  <p>"I cannot&mdash;will not fly thus," she cried.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter?" exclaimed Leonard, suddenly turning.</p>

  <p>"Further disguise is useless," replied the supposed Gregory Swindlehurst.
  "I am the Earl of Rochester. The other was a counterfeit."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" exclaimed Leonard, rushing towards them, and placing a pistol
  against the breast of his mistress? "Have I been duped? But it is not yet too
  late to retrieve my error. Move a foot further, my lord,&mdash;and do you,
  Amabel, attempt to fly with him, and I fire."</p>

  <p>"You cannot mean this?" cried Rochester. "Raise your hand against the
  woman you love?"</p>

  <p>"Against the woman who forgets her duty, and the libertine who tempts her,
  the arm that is raised is that of justice," replied Leonard. "Stir another
  footstep, and I fire."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, his arms were suddenly seized by a powerful grasp from
  behind, and, striking the pistols from his hold, the earl snatched up Amabel
  in his arms, and, mounting the ladder, made good his retreat.</p>

  <p>A long and desperate struggle took place between Leonard and his
  assailant, who was no other than Pillichody, in his assumed character of
  Bernard Boutefeu. But notwithstanding the superior strength of the bully, and
  the advantage he had taken of the apprentice, he was worsted in the end.</p>

  <p>Leonard had no sooner extricated himself, than, drawing his sword, he
  would have passed it through Pillichody's body, if the latter had not stayed
  his hand by offering to tell him where he would find his mistress, provided
  his life were spared.</p>

  <p>"Where has the earl taken her?" cried Leonard, scarcely able to articulate
  from excess of passion.</p>

  <p>"He meant to take her to Saint Paul's,&mdash;to the vaults below the
  cathedral, to avoid pursuit," replied Pillichody. "I have no doubt you will
  find her there."</p>

  <p>"I will go there instantly and search," cried Leonard, rushing up the
  ladder.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch2-5"
     name="ch2-5">V. &mdash; THE BLIND PIPER AND HIS DAUGHTER</a></h2>

  <p>Scarcely knowing how he got there, Leonard Holt found himself at the great
  northern entrance of the cathedral. Burning with fury, he knocked at the
  door; but no answer being returned to the summons, though he repeated it
  still more loudly, he shook the heavy latch with such violence as to rouse
  the sullen echoes of the aisles. Driven almost to desperation, he retired a
  few paces, and surveyed the walls of the vast structure, in the hope of
  descrying some point by which he might obtain an entrance.</p>

  <p>It was a bright moonlight night, and the reverend pile looked so
  beautiful, that, under any other frame of mind, Leonard must, have been
  struck with admiration. The ravages of time could not now be discerned, and
  the architectural incongruities which, seen in the broad glare of day, would
  have offended the eye of taste, were lost in the general grand effect. On the
  left ran the magnificent pointed windows of the choir, divided by massive
  buttresses,&mdash;the latter ornamented with crocketed pinnacles. On the
  right, the building had been new-faced, and its original character, in a
  great measure, destroyed by the tasteless manner in which the repairs had
  been executed. On this side, the lower windows were round-headed and
  separated by broad pilasters, while above them ran a range of small circular
  windows. At the western angle was seen one of the towers (since imitated by
  Wren), which flanked this side of the fane, together with a part of the
  portico erected, about twenty-five years previously, by Inigo Jones, and
  which, though beautiful in itself, was totally out of character with the
  edifice, and, in fact, a blemish to it.</p>

  <p>Insensible alike to the beauties or defects of the majestic building, and
  regarding it only as the prison of his mistress, Leonard Holt scanned it
  carefully on either side. But his scrutiny was attended with no favourable
  result.</p>

  <p>Before resorting to force to obtain admission, he determined to make the
  complete circuit of the structure, and with this view he shaped his course
  towards the east.</p>

  <p>He found two small doors on the left of the northern transept, but both
  were fastened, and the low pointed windows beneath the choir, lighting the
  subterranean church of Saint Faith's, were all barred. Running on, he
  presently came to a flight of stone steps at the north-east corner of the
  choir, leading to a portal opening upon a small chapel dedicated to Saint
  George. But this was secured like the others, and, thinking it vain to waste
  time in trying to force it, he pursued his course.</p>

  <p>Skirting the eastern extremity of the fane&mdash;then the most beautiful
  part of the structure, from its magnificent rose window&mdash;he speeded past
  the low windows which opened on this side, as on the other upon Saint
  Faith's, and did not pause till he came to the great southern portal, the
  pillars and arch of which differed but slightly in character from those of
  the northern entrance.</p>

  <p>Here he knocked as before, and was answered, as on the former occasion, by
  sullen echoes from within. When these sounds died away, he placed his ear to
  the huge key-hole in the wicket, but could not even catch the fall of a
  footstep. Neither could he perceive any light, except that afforded by the
  moonbeams, which flooded the transept with radiance.</p>

  <p>Again hurrying on, he passed the cloister-walls surrounding the
  Convocation House; tried another door between that building and the church of
  Saint Gregory, a small fane attached to the larger structure; and failing in
  opening it, turned the corner and approached the portico,&mdash;the principal
  entrance to the cathedral being then, as now, on the west.</p>

  <p>Erected, as before mentioned, from the designs of the celebrated Inigo
  Jones, this magnificent colonnade was completed about 1640, at which time
  preparations were made for repairing the cathedral throughout, and for
  strengthening the tower, for enabling it to support a new spire. But this
  design, owing to the disorganised state of affairs, was never carried into
  execution.</p>

  <p>At the time of the Commonwealth, while the interior of the sacred fabric
  underwent every sort of desecration and mutilation,&mdash;while stones were
  torn from the pavement, and monumental brasses from tombs,&mdash;while carved
  stalls were burnt, and statues plucked from their niches,&mdash;a similar
  fate attended the portico. Shops were built beneath it, and the sculptures
  ornamenting its majestic balustrade were thrown down.</p>

  <p>Amongst other obstructions, it appears that there was a "high house in the
  north angle, which hindered the masons from repairing that part of it." The
  marble door-cases, the capitals, cornices, and pillars were so much injured
  by the fires made against them, that it required months to put them in order.
  At the Restoration, Sir John Denham, the poet, was appointed surveyor-general
  of the works, and continued to hold the office at the period of this
  history.</p>

  <p>As Leonard drew near the portico, he perceived, to his surprise, that a
  large concourse of people was collected in the area in front of it; and,
  rushing forward, he found the assemblage listening to the denunciations of
  Solomon Eagle, who was standing in the midst of them with his brazier on his
  head. The enthusiast appeared more than usually excited. He was tossing aloft
  his arms in a wild and frenzied manner, and seemed to be directing his
  menaces against the cathedral itself.</p>

  <p>Hoping to obtain assistance from the crowd, Leonard resolved to await a
  fitting period to address them. Accordingly, he joined them, and listened to
  the discourse of the enthusiast.</p>

  <p>"Hear me!" cried the latter, in a voice of thunder. "I had a vision last
  night and will relate it to you. During my brief slumbers, I thought I was
  standing on this very spot, and gazing as now upon yon mighty structure. On a
  sudden the day became overcast, and ere long it grew pitchy dark. Then was
  heard a noise of rushing wings in the air, and I could just discern many
  strange figures hovering above the tower, uttering doleful cries and
  lamentations. All at once these figures disappeared, and gave place to, or,
  it may be, were chased away by, others of more hideous appearance. The latter
  brought lighted brands which they hurled against the sacred fabric, and, in
  an instant, flames burst forth from it on all sides. My brethren, it was a
  fearful, yet a glorious sight to see that vast pile wrapped in the devouring
  element! The flames were so vivid&mdash;so intense&mdash;that I could not
  bear to look upon them, and I covered my face with my hands. On raising my
  eyes again the flames were extinguished, but the building was utterly in
  ruins&mdash;its columns cracked&mdash;its tower hurled from its
  place&mdash;its ponderous roof laid low. It was a mournful spectacle, and a
  terrible proof of the Divine wrath and vengeance. Yes, my brethren, the
  temple of the Lord has been profaned, and it will be razed to the ground. It
  has been the scene of abomination and impiety, and must be purified by fire.
  Theft, murder, sacrilege, and every other crime have been committed within
  its walls, and its destruction will follow. The ministers of Heaven's
  vengeance are even now hovering above it. Repent, therefore, ye who listen to
  me, and repent speedily; for sudden death, plague, fire, and famine, are at
  hand. As the prophet Amos saith, 'The Lord will send a fire, the Lord will
  commission a fire, the Lord will kindle a fire;' and the fire so commissioned
  and so kindled shall consume you and your city; nor shall one stone of those
  walls be left standing on another. Repent, or burn, for he cometh to judge
  the earth. Repent, or burn, I say!"</p>

  <p>As soon as he concluded, Leonard Holt ran up the steps of the portico, and
  in a loud voice claimed the attention of the crowd.</p>

  <p>"Solomon Eagle is right," he cried; "the vengeance of Heaven will descend
  upon this fabric, since it continues to be the scene of so much wickedness.
  Even now it forms the retreat of a profligate nobleman, who has this night
  forcibly carried off the daughter of a citizen."</p>

  <p>"What nobleman?" cried a bystander.</p>

  <p>"The Earl of Rochester," replied Leonard. "He has robbed Stephen Bloundel,
  the grocer of Wood-street, of his daughter, and has concealed her, to avoid
  pursuit, in the vaults of the cathedral."</p>

  <p>"I know Mr. Bloundel well," rejoined the man who had made the inquiry, and
  whom Leonard recognised as a hosier named Lamplugh, "and I know the person
  who addresses us. It is his apprentice. We must restore the damsel to her
  father, friends."</p>

  <p>"Agreed!" cried several voices.</p>

  <p>"Knock at the door," cried a man, whose occupation of a smith was
  proclaimed by his leathern apron, brawny chest, and smoke-begrimed visage, as
  well as by the heavy hammer which he bore upon his shoulder. "If it is not
  instantly opened, we will break it down. I have an implement here which will
  soon do the business."</p>

  <p>A rush was then made to the portal, which rang with the heavy blows dealt
  against it. While this was passing, Solomon Eagle, whose excitement was
  increased by the tumult, planted himself in the centre of the colonnade, and
  vociferated&mdash;"I speak in the words of the prophet Ezekiel:&mdash;'Thou
  hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the
  iniquity of thy traffic. Therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst
  of thee, and will bring thee to ashes upon the earth, in the sight of all
  them that behold thee!'"</p>

  <p>The crowd continued to batter the door until they were checked by
  Lamplugh, who declared he heard some one approaching, and the next moment the
  voice of one of the vergers inquired in trembling tones, who they were, and
  what they wanted.</p>

  <p>"No matter who we are," replied Leonard, "we demand admittance to search
  for a young female who has been taken from her home by the Earl of Rochester,
  and is now concealed within the vaults of the cathedral."</p>

  <p>"If admittance is refused us, we will soon let ourselves in," vociferated
  Lamplugh.</p>

  <p>"Ay, that we will," added the smith.</p>

  <p>"You are mistaken, friends," returned the verger, timorously. "The Earl of
  Rochester is not here."</p>

  <p>"We will not take your word for it," rejoined the smith. "This will show
  you we are not to be trifled with."</p>

  <p>So saying, he raised his hammer, and struck such a tremendous blow against
  the door, that the bolts started in their sockets.</p>

  <p>"Hold! hold!" cried the verger; "sooner than violence shall be committed,
  I will risk your admission."</p>

  <p>And he unfastened the door.</p>

  <p>"Keep together," shouted the smith, stretching out his arms to oppose the
  progress of the crowd. "Keep together, I say."</p>

  <p>"Ay, ay, keep together," added Lamplugh, seconding his efforts.</p>

  <p>"Conduct us to the Earl of Rochester, and no harm shall befall you," cried
  Leonard, seizing the verger by the collar.</p>

  <p>"I tell you I know nothing about him," replied the man. "He is not
  here."</p>

  <p>"It is false! you are bribed to silence," rejoined the apprentice. "We
  will search till we find him."</p>

  <p>"Search where you please," rejoined the verger; "and if you <i>do</i> find
  him, do what you please with me."</p>

  <p>"Don't be afraid of that, friend," replied the smith; "we will hang you
  and the earl to the same pillar."</p>

  <p>By this time, the crowd had pushed aside the opposition offered by the
  smith and Lamplugh. Solomon Eagle darted along the nave with lightning
  swiftness, and, mounting the steps leading to the choir, disappeared from
  view. Some few persons followed him, while others took their course along the
  aisles. But the majority kept near the apprentice.</p>

  <p>Snatching the lamp from the grasp of the verger, Leonard Holt ran on with
  his companions till they came to the beautiful chapel built by Thomas Kempe,
  bishop of London. The door was open, and the apprentice, holding the light
  forward, perceived there were persons inside. He was about to enter the
  chapel, when a small spaniel rushed forth, and, barking furiously, held him
  in check for a moment. Alarmed by the noise, an old man in a tattered garb,
  and a young female, who were slumbering on benches in the chapel, immediately
  started to their feet, and advanced towards them.</p>

  <p>"We are mistaken," said Lamplugh; "this is only Mike Macascree, the blind
  piper and his daughter Nizza. I know them well enough."</p>

  <p>Leonard was about to proceed with his search, but a slight circumstance
  detained him for a few minutes, during which time he had sufficient leisure
  to note the extraordinary personal attractions of Nizza Macascree.</p>

  <p>In age she appeared about seventeen, and differed in the character of her
  beauty, as well as in the natural gracefulness of her carriage and demeanour,
  from all the persons he had seen in her humble sphere of life. Her features
  were small, and of the utmost delicacy. She had a charmingly-formed
  nose&mdash;slightly <i>retrouss</i>&mdash;a small mouth, garnished with
  pearl-like teeth, and lips as fresh and ruddy as the dew-steeped rose. Her
  skin was as dark as a gipsy's, but clear and transparent, and far more
  attractive than the fairest complexion. Her eyes were luminous as the stars,
  and black as midnight; while her raven tresses, gathered beneath a spotted
  kerchief tied round her head, escaped in many a wanton curl down her
  shoulders. Her figure was slight, but exquisitely proportioned; and she had
  the smallest foot and ankle that ever fell to the lot of woman. Her attire
  was far from unbecoming, though of the coarsest material; and her fairy feet
  were set off by the daintiest shoes and hose. Such was the singular and
  captivating creature that attracted the apprentice's attention.</p>

  <p>Her father, Mike Macascree, was upwards of sixty, but still in the full
  vigour of life, with features which, though not ill-looking, bore no
  particular resemblance to those of his daughter. He had a good-humoured,
  jovial countenance, the mirthful expression of which even his sightless orbs
  could not destroy. Long white locks descended upon his shoulders, and a
  patriarchal beard adorned his chin. He was wrapped in a loose grey gown,
  patched with different coloured cloths, and supported himself with a staff.
  His pipe was suspended from his neck by a green worsted cord.</p>

  <p>"Lie down, Bell," he cried to his dog; "what are you barking at thus? Lie
  down, I say."</p>

  <p>"Something is the matter, father," replied Nizza. "The church is full of
  people."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" exclaimed the piper.</p>

  <p>"We are sorry to disturb you," said Leonard; "but we are in search of a
  nobleman who has run away with a citizen's daughter, and conveyed her to the
  cathedral, and we thought they might have taken refuge in this chapel."</p>

  <p>"No one is here except myself and daughter," replied the piper. "We are
  allowed this lodging by Mr. Quatremain, the minor canon."</p>

  <p>"All dogs are ordered to be destroyed by the Lord Mayor," cried the smith,
  seizing Bell by the neck. "This noisy animal must be silenced."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no! do not hurt her!" cried Nizza. "My father loves poor Bell almost
  as well as he loves me. She is necessary to his existence. You must
  not&mdash;will not destroy her!"</p>

  <p>"Won't I?" replied the smith, gruffly; "we'll see that."</p>

  <p>"But we are not afraid of contagion, are we, father?" cried Nizza,
  appealing to the piper.</p>

  <p>"Not in the least," replied Mike, "and we will take care the poor beast
  touches no one else. Do not harm her, sir&mdash;for pity's sake, do not. I
  should miss her sadly."</p>

  <p>"The Lord Mayor's commands must be obeyed," rejoined the smith,
  brutally.</p>

  <p>As if conscious of the fate awaiting her, poor Bell struggled hard to get
  free, and uttered a piteous yell.</p>

  <p>"You are not going to kill the dog?" interposed Leonard.</p>

  <p>"Have you anything to say to the contrary?" rejoined the smith, in a tone
  calculated, as he thought, to put an end to further interference.</p>

  <p>"Only this," replied Leonard, "that I will not allow it."</p>

  <p>"You won't&mdash;eh?" returned the smith, derisively.</p>

  <p>"I will not," rejoined Leonard, "so put her down and come along."</p>

  <p>"Go your own way," replied the smith, "and leave me to mine."</p>

  <p>Leonard answered by snatching Bell suddenly from his grasp. Thus
  liberated, the terrified animal instantly flew to her mistress.</p>

  <p>"Is this the return I get for assisting you?" cried the smith, savagely.
  "You are bewitched by a pair of black eyes. But you will repent your
  folly."</p>

  <p>"I shall never forget your kindness," replied Nizza, clasping Bell to her
  bosom, and looking gratefully at the apprentice. "You say you are in search
  of a citizen's daughter and a nobleman. About half an hour ago, or scarcely
  so much, I was awakened by the opening of the door of the southern transept,
  and peeping out, I saw three persons&mdash;a young man in the dress of a
  watchman, but evidently disguised, and a very beautiful young woman,
  conducted by Judith Malmayns, bearing a lantern,&mdash;pass through the
  doorway leading to Saint Faith's. Perhaps they are the very persons you are
  in search of."</p>

  <p>"They are," returned Leonard; "and you have repaid me a hundredfold for
  the slight service I have rendered you by the information. We will instantly
  repair to the vaults. Come along."</p>

  <p>Accompanied by the whole of the assemblage, except the smith, who skulked
  off in the opposite direction, he passed through the low doorway on the right
  of the choir, and descended to Saint Faith's. The subterranean church was
  buried in profound darkness, and apparently wholly untenanted. On reaching
  the charnel, they crossed it, and tried the door of the vault formerly
  occupied by the sexton. It was fastened, but Leonard knocking violently
  against it, it was soon opened by Judith Malmayns, who appeared much
  surprised, and not a little alarmed, at the sight of so many persons. She was
  not alone, and her companion was Chowles. He was seated at a table, on which
  stood a flask of brandy and a couple of glasses, and seemed a good deal
  confused at being caught in such a situation, though he endeavoured to cover
  his embarrassment by an air of effrontery.</p>

  <p>"Where is the Earl of Rochester?&mdash;where is Amabel?" demanded Leonard
  Holt.</p>

  <p>"I know nothing about either of them," replied Judith. "Why do you put
  these questions to me?"</p>

  <p>"Because you admitted them to the cathedral," cried the apprentice,
  furiously, "and because you have concealed them. If you do not instantly
  guide me to their retreat, I will make you a terrible example to all such
  evil-doers in future."</p>

  <p>"If you think to frighten me by your violence, you are mistaken," returned
  Judith, boldly. "Mr. Chowles has been here more than two hours&mdash;ask him
  whether he has seen any one."</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," replied Chowles. "There is no Amabel&mdash;no Earl of
  Rochester here. You must be dreaming, young man."</p>

  <p>"The piper's daughter affirmed the contrary," replied Leonard. "She said
  she saw this woman admit them."</p>

  <p>"She lies," replied Judith, fiercely. But suddenly altering her tone, she
  continued, "If I <i>had</i> admitted them, you would find them here."</p>

  <p>Leonard looked round uneasily. He was but half convinced, and yet he
  scarcely knew what to think.</p>

  <p>"If you doubt what I say to you," continued Judith, "I will take you to
  every chamber in the cathedral. You will then be satisfied that I speak the
  truth. But I will not have this mob with me. Your companions must remain
  here."</p>

  <p>"Ay, stop with me and make yourselves comfortable," cried Chowles. "You
  are not so much used to these places as I am, I prefer a snug crypt, like
  this, to the best room in a tavern&mdash;ha! ha!"</p>

  <p>Attended by Judith, Leonard Holt searched every corner of the subterranean
  church, except the vestry, the door of which was locked, and the key removed;
  but without success. They then ascended to the upper structure, and visited
  the choir, the transepts, and the nave, but with no better result.</p>

  <p>"If you still think they are here," said Judith, "we will mount to the
  summit of the tower?"</p>

  <p>"I will never quit the cathedral without them," replied Leonard.</p>

  <p>"Come on, then," returned Judith.</p>

  <p>So saying, she opened the door in the wall on the left of the choir, and,
  ascending a winding stone staircase to a considerable height, arrived at a
  small cell contrived within the thickness of the wall, and desired Leonard to
  search it. The apprentice unsuspectingly obeyed. But he had scarcely set foot
  inside when the door was locked behind him, and he was made aware of the
  treachery practised upon him by a peal of mocking laughter from his
  conductress.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch2-6"
     name="ch2-6">VI. &mdash; OLD LONDON FROM OLD SAINT PAUL'S.</a></h2>

  <p>After repeated, but ineffectual efforts to burst open the door, Leonard
  gave up the attempt in despair, and endeavoured to make his situation known
  by loud outcries. But his shouts, if heard, were unheeded, and he was soon
  compelled from exhaustion to desist. Judith having carried away the lantern,
  he was left in total darkness; but on searching the cell, which was about
  four feet wide and six deep, he discovered a narrow grated loophole. By dint
  of great exertion, and with the help of his sword, which snapped in twain as
  he used it, he managed to force off one of the rusty bars, and to squeeze
  himself through the aperture. All his labour, however, was thrown away. The
  loophole opened on the south side of the tower, near one of the large
  buttresses, which projected several yards beyond it on the left, and was more
  than twenty feet above the roof; so that it would be certain destruction to
  drop from so great a height.</p>

  <p>The night was overcast, and the moon hidden behind thick clouds. Still,
  there was light enough to enable him to discern the perilous position in
  which he stood. After gazing below for some time, Leonard was about to return
  to the cell, when, casting his eyes upwards, he thought he perceived the end
  of a rope about a foot above his head, dangling from the upper part of the
  structure. No sooner was this discovery made, than it occurred to him that he
  might possibly liberate himself by this unlooked for aid; and, regardless of
  the risk he ran, he sprang upwards and caught hold of the rope. It was firmly
  fastened above, and sustained his weight well.</p>

  <p>Possessed of great bodily strength and activity, and nerved by
  desperation, Leonard Holt placed his feet against the buttress, and impelled
  himself towards one of the tall pointed windows lighting the interior of the
  tower; but though he reached the point at which he aimed, the sway of the
  rope dragged him back before he could obtain a secure grasp of the stone
  shaft; and, after another ineffectual effort, fearful of exhausting his
  strength, he abandoned the attempt, and began to climb up the rope with his
  hands and knees. Aided by the inequalities of the roughened walls, he soon
  gained a range of small Saxon arches ornamenting the tower immediately
  beneath the belfry, and succeeded in planting his right foot on the moulding
  of one of them; he instantly steadied himself, and with little further effort
  clambered through an open window.</p>

  <p>His first act on reaching the belfry was to drop on his knees, and return
  thanks to Heaven for his deliverance. He then looked about for an outlet; but
  though a winding staircase existed in each of the four angles of the tower,
  all the doors, to his infinite disappointment, were fastened on the other
  side. He was still, therefore, a prisoner.</p>

  <p>Determined, however, not to yield to despair, he continued his search, and
  finding a small door opening upon a staircase communicating with the summit
  of the tower, he unfastened it (for the bolt was on his own side), and
  hurried up the steps. Passing through another door bolted like the first
  within side, he issued upon the roof. He was now on the highest part of the
  cathedral, and farther from his hopes than ever; and so agonizing were his
  feelings, that he almost felt tempted to fling himself headlong downwards.
  Beneath him lay the body of the mighty fabric, its vast roof, its crocketed
  pinnacles, its buttresses and battlements scarcely discernible through the
  gloom, but looking like some monstrous engine devised to torture him.</p>

  <p>Wearied with gazing at it, and convinced of the futility of any further
  attempt at descent, Leonard Holt returned to the belfry, and, throwing
  himself on the boarded floor, sought some repose. The fatigue he had
  undergone was so great, that, notwithstanding his anxiety, he soon dropped
  asleep, and did not awake for several hours. On opening his eyes, it was just
  getting light, and shaking himself, he again prepared for action. All the
  events of the night rushed upon his mind, and he thought with unutterable
  anguish of Amabel's situation. Glancing round the room, it occurred to him
  that he might give the alarm by ringing the enormous bells near him; but
  though he set them slightly in motion, he could not agitate the immense
  clappers sufficiently to produce any sound.</p>

  <p>Resolved, however, to free himself at any hazard, he once more repaired to
  the summit of the tower, and leaning over the balustrade, gazed below. It was
  a sublime spectacle, and, in spite of his distress, filled him with
  admiration and astonishment. He had stationed himself on the south side of
  the tower, and immediately beneath him lay the broad roof of the transept,
  stretching out to a distance of nearly two hundred feet. On the right,
  surrounded by a double row of cloisters, remarkable for the beauty of their
  architecture, stood the convocation, or chapter-house. The exquisite building
  was octagonal in form, and supported by large buttresses, ornamented on each
  gradation by crocketed pinnacles. Each side, moreover, had a tall pointed
  window, filled with stained glass, and was richly adorned with trefoils and
  cinquefoils. Further on, on the same side, was the small low church dedicated
  to Saint Gregory, overtopped by the south-western tower of the mightier
  parent fane.</p>

  <p>It was not, however, the cathedral itself, but the magnificent view it
  commanded, that chiefly attracted the apprentice's attention. From the
  elevated point on which he stood, his eye ranged over a vast tract of country
  bounded by the Surrey hills, and at last settled upon the river, which in
  some parts was obscured by a light haze, and in others tinged with the ruddy
  beams of the newly-risen sun. Its surface was spotted, even at this early
  hour, with craft, while innumerable vessels of all shapes and sizes were
  moored, to its banks. On. the left, he noted the tall houses covering London
  Bridge; and on the right, traced the sweeping course of the stream as it
  flowed from Westminster. On this hand, on the opposite bank, lay the flat
  marshes of Lambeth; while nearer stood the old bull-baiting and bear-baiting
  establishments, the flags above which could be discerned above the tops of
  the surrounding habitations. A little to the left was the borough of
  Southwark, even then a large and populous district&mdash;the two most
  prominent features in the scene being Winchester House, and Saint Saviour's
  old and beautiful church.</p>

  <p>Filled with wonder at what he saw, Leonard looked towards the east, and
  here an extraordinary prospect met his gaze. The whole of the city of London
  was spread out like a map before him, and presented a dense mass of ancient
  houses, with twisted chimneys, gables, and picturesque roofs&mdash;here and
  there overtopped by a hall, a college, an hospital, or some other lofty
  structure. This vast collection of buildings was girded in by grey and
  mouldering walls, approached by seven gates, and intersected by innumerable
  narrow streets. The spires and towers of the churches shot up into the clear
  morning air&mdash;for, except in a few quarters, no smoke yet issued from the
  chimneys. On this side, the view of the city was terminated by the
  fortifications and keep of the Tower. Little did the apprentice think, when
  he looked at the magnificent scene before him, and marvelled at the countless
  buildings he beheld, that, ere fifteen months had elapsed, the whole mass,
  together with the mighty fabric on which he stood, would be swept away by a
  tremendous conflagration. Unable to foresee this direful event, and lamenting
  only that so fair a city should be a prey to an exterminating pestilence, he
  turned towards the north, and suffered his gaze to wander over
  Finsbury-fields, and the hilly ground beyond them&mdash;over Smithfield and
  Clerkenwell, and the beautiful open country adjoining Gray's-inn-lane.</p>

  <p>So smiling and beautiful did these districts appear, that ha could
  scarcely fancy they were the chief haunts of the horrible distemper. But he
  could not blind himself to the fact that in Finsbury-fields, as well as in
  the open country to the north of Holborn, plague-pits had been digged and
  pest-houses erected; and this consideration threw such a gloom over the
  prospect, that, in order to dispel the effect, he changed the scene by
  looking towards the west. Here his view embraced all the proudest mansions of
  the capital, and tracing the Strand to Charing Cross, long since robbed of
  the beautiful structure from which it derived its name, and noticing its
  numerous noble habitations, his eye finally rested upon Whitehall: and he
  heaved a sigh as he thought that the palace of the sovereign was infected by
  as foul a moral taint as the hideous disease that ravaged the dwellings of
  his subjects.</p>

  <p>At the time that Leonard Holt gazed upon the capital, its picturesque
  beauties were nearly at their close. In a little more than a year and a
  quarter afterwards, the greater part of the old city was consumed by fire;
  and though it was rebuilt, and in many respects improved, its original and
  picturesque character was entirely destroyed.</p>

  <p>It seems scarcely possible to conceive a finer view than can be gained
  from the dome of the modern cathedral at sunrise on a May morning, when the
  prospect is not dimmed by the smoke of a hundred thousand chimneys&mdash;when
  the river is just beginning to stir with its numerous craft, or when they are
  sleeping on its glistening bosom&mdash;when every individual house, court,
  church, square, or theatre, can be discerned&mdash;when the eye can range
  over the whole city on each side, and calculate its vast extent. It seems
  scarcely possible, we say, to suppose at any previous time it could be more
  striking; and yet, at the period under consideration, it was incomparably
  more so. Then, every house was picturesque, and every street a collection of
  picturesque objects. Then, that which was objectionable in itself, and
  contributed to the insalubrity of the city, namely, the extreme narrowness of
  the streets, and overhanging stories of the houses, was the main source of
  their beauty. Then, the huge projecting signs with their fantastical
  iron-work&mdash;the conduits&mdash;the crosses (where crosses
  remained)&mdash;the maypoles&mdash;all were picturesque; and as superior to
  what can now be seen, as the attire of Charles the Second's age is to the
  ugly and disfiguring costume of our own day.</p>

  <p>Satiated with this glorious prospect, Leonard began to recur to his own
  situation, and carefully scrutinizing every available point on the side of
  the Tower, he thought it possible to effect his descent by clambering down
  the gradations of one of the buttresses. Still, as this experiment would be
  attended with the utmost danger, while, even if he reached the roof, he would
  yet be far from his object, he resolved to defer it for a short time, in the
  hope that ere long seine of the bell-ringers, or other persons connected with
  the cathedral, might come thither and set him free.</p>

  <p>While thus communing with himself, he heard a door open below; and
  hurrying down the stairs at the sound, he beheld, to his great surprise and
  joy, the piper's daughter, Nizza Macascree.</p>

  <p>"I have searched for you everywhere," she cried, "and began to think some
  ill had befallen you. I overheard Judith Malmayns say she had shut you up in
  a cell in the upper part of the tower. How did you escape thence?"</p>

  <p>Leonard hastily explained.</p>

  <p>"I told you I should never forget the service you rendered me in
  preserving the life of poor Bell," pursued Nizza, "and what I have done will
  prove I am not unmindful of my promise I saw you search the cathedral last
  night with Judith, and noticed that she returned from the tower unaccompanied
  by you. At first I supposed you might have left the cathedral without my
  observing you, and I was further confirmed in the idea by what I subsequently
  heard."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" exclaimed Leonard. "What did you hear?"</p>

  <p>"I followed Judith to the vaults of Saint Faith's," replied Nizza, "and
  heard her inform your companions that you had found the grocer's daughter,
  and had taken her away."</p>

  <p>"And this false statement imposed upon them?" cried Leonard.</p>

  <p>"It did," replied Nizza. "They were by this time more than half
  intoxicated by the brandy given them by Chowles, the coffin-maker, and they
  departed in high dudgeon with you."</p>

  <p>"No wonder!" exclaimed Leonard.</p>

  <p>"They had scarcely been gone many minutes," pursued Nizza, "when, having
  stationed myself behind one of the massive pillars in the north aisle of
  Saint Faith's&mdash;for I suspected something was wrong&mdash;I observed
  Judith and Chowles steal across the nave, and proceed towards the vestry. The
  former tapped at the door, and they were instantly admitted by Mr.
  Quatremain, the minor canon. Hastening to the door, which was left slightly
  ajar, I perceived two young gallants, whom I heard addressed as the Earl of
  Rochester and Sir George Etherege, and a young female, who I could not doubt
  was Amabel. The earl and his companion laughed heartily at the trick Judith
  had played you, and which the latter detailed to them; but Amabel took no
  part in their merriment, but, on the contrary, looked very grave, and even
  wept."</p>

  <p>"Wept, did she?" cried Leonard, in a voice of much emotion. "Then, there
  is hope for her yet."</p>

  <p>"You appear greatly interested in her," observed Nizza, pausing, in her
  narration. "Do you love her?"</p>

  <p>"Can you ask it?" cried Leonard, passionately.</p>

  <p>"I would advise you to think no more of her, and to fix your heart
  elsewhere," returned Nizza.</p>

  <p>"You know not what it is to love," replied the apprentice, "or you would
  not offer such a counsel."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not," replied Nizza; "but I am sorry you have bestowed your heart
  upon one who so little appreciates the boon."</p>

  <p>And, feeling she had said too much, she blushed deeply, and cast down her
  eyes.</p>

  <p>Unconscious of her confusion, and entirely engrossed by the thought of his
  mistress, Leonard urged her to proceed.</p>

  <p>"Tell me what has become of Amabel&mdash;where I shall find her?" he
  cried.</p>

  <p>"You will find her soon enough," replied Nizza. "She has not left the
  cathedral. But hear me to an end. On learning you were made a prisoner, I ran
  to the door leading to the tower, but found that Judith had locked it, and
  removed the key. Not daring to give the alarm&mdash;for I had gathered from
  what was said that the three vergers were in the earl's pay&mdash;I
  determined to await a favourable opportunity to release you. Accordingly I
  returned to the vestry door, and again played the eaves-dropper. By this
  time, another person, who was addressed as Major Pillichody, and who, it
  appeared, had been employed in the abduction, had joined the party. He
  informed the earl that Mr. Bloundel was in the greatest distress at his
  daughter's disappearance, and advised him to lose no time in conveying her to
  some secure retreat. These tidings troubled Amabel exceedingly, and the earl
  endeavoured to pacify her by promising to espouse her at daybreak, and, as
  soon as the ceremony was over, to introduce her in the character of his
  countess to her parents."</p>

  <p>"Villain!" cried Leonard; "but go on."</p>

  <p>"I have little more to tell," replied Nizza, "except that she consented to
  the proposal, provided she was allowed to remain till six o'clock, the hour
  appointed for the marriage, with Judith."</p>

  <p>"Bad as that alternative is, it is better than the other," observed
  Leonard. "But how did you procure the key of the winding staircase?"</p>

  <p>"I fortunately observed where Judith had placed it," replied Nizza, "and
  when she departed to the crypt near the charnel, with Amabel, I possessed
  myself of it. For some time I was unable to use it, because the Earl of
  Rochester and Sir George Etherege kept pacing to and fro in front of the
  door, and their discourse convinced me that the marriage was meant to be a
  feigned one, for Sir George strove to dissuade his friend from the step he
  was about to take; but the other only laughed at his scruples. As soon as
  they retired, which is not more than half an hour ago, I unlocked the door,
  and hurried up the winding stairs. I searched every chamber, and began to
  think you were gone, or that Judith's statement was false. But I resolved to
  continue my search until I was fully satisfied on this point, and accordingly
  ascended to the belfry. You are aware of the result."</p>

  <p>"You have rendered me a most important service," replied Leonard; "and I
  hope hereafter to prove my gratitude. But let us now descend to the choir,
  where I will conceal myself till Amabel appears. This marriage must be
  prevented."</p>

  <p>Before quitting the belfry, Leonard chanced to cast his eyes on a stout
  staff left there, either by one of the bell-ringers or some chance visitant,
  and seizing it as an unlooked-for prize, he ran down the steps, followed by
  the piper's daughter.</p>

  <p>On opening the lowest door, he glanced towards the choir, and there before
  the high altar stood Quatremain in his surplice, with the earl and Amabel,
  attended by Etherege and Pillichody. The ceremony had just commenced. Not a
  moment was to be lost. Grasping his staff, the apprentice darted along the
  nave, and, rushing up to the pair, exclaimed in a loud voice, "Hold! I forbid
  this marriage. It must not take place!"</p>

  <p>"Back, sirrah!" cried Etherege, drawing his sword, and opposing the
  approach of the apprentice. "You have no authority to interrupt it. Proceed,
  Mr. Quatremain."</p>

  <p>"Forbear!" cried a voice of thunder near them&mdash;and all turning at the
  cry, they beheld Solomon Eagle, with his brazier on his head, issue from
  behind the stalls. "Forbear!" cried the enthusiast, placing himself between
  the earl and Amabel, both of whom recoiled at his approach. "Heaven's altar
  must not be profaned with these mockeries! And you, Thomas Quatremain, who
  have taken part in this unrighteous transaction, make clean your breast, and
  purge yourself quickly of your sins, for your hours are numbered. I read in
  your livid looks and red and burning eyeballs that you are smitten by the
  pestilence."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch2-7"
     name="ch2-7">VII. &mdash; PAUL'S WALK.</a></h2>

  <p>It will now be necessary to ascertain what took place at the grocer's
  habitation subsequently to Amabel's abduction. Leonard Holt having departed,
  Pillichody was preparing to make good his retreat, when he was prevented by
  Blaize, who, hearing a noise in the yard, peeped cautiously out at the
  back-door, and inquired who was there?</p>

  <p>"Are you Mr. Bloundel?" rejoined Pillichody, bethinking him of a plan to
  turn the tables upon the apprentice.</p>

  <p>"No, I am his porter," replied the other.</p>

  <p>"What, Blaize!" replied Pillichody. "Thunder and lightning! don't you
  remember Bernard Boutefeu, the watchman?"</p>

  <p>"I don't remember any watchman of that name, and I cannot discern your
  features," rejoined Blaize. "But your voice sounds familiar to me. What are
  you doing there?"</p>

  <p>"I have been trying to prevent Leonard Holt from carrying off your
  master's daughter, the fair Mistress Amabel," answered Pillichody. "But he
  has accomplished his villanous purpose in spite of me."</p>

  <p>"The devil he has!" cried Blaize. "Here is a pretty piece of news for my
  master. But how did you discover him?"</p>

  <p>"Chancing to pass along the entry on the other side of that wall about a
  quarter of an hour ago," returned Pillichody, "I perceived a rope-ladder
  fastened to it, and wishing to ascertain what was the matter, I mounted it,
  and had scarcely got over into the yard, when I saw two persons advancing. I
  concealed myself beneath the shadow of the wall, and they did not notice me;
  but I gathered from their discourse who they were and what was their design.
  I allowed Amabel to ascend, but just as the apprentice was following, I laid
  hold of the skirt of his doublet, and, pulling him back, desired him to come
  with me to his master. He answered by drawing his sword, and would have
  stabbed me, but I closed with him, and should have secured him if my foot had
  not slipped. While I was on the ground, he dealt me a severe blow, and ran
  after his mistress."</p>

  <p>"Just like him," replied Blaize. "He took the same cowardly advantage of
  me last night."</p>

  <p>"No punishment will be too severe for him," rejoined Pillichody, "and I
  hope your master will make a terrible example of him."</p>

  <p>"How fortunate I was not gone to bed!" exclaimed Blaize, "I had just taken
  a couple of rufuses, and was about to put on my nightcap, when, hearing a
  noise without, and being ever on the alert to defend my master's property,
  even at the hazard of my life, I stepped forth and found you."</p>

  <p>"I will bear testimony to your vigilance and courage," returned
  Pillichody; "but you had better go and alarm your master, I will wait
  here."</p>

  <p>"Instantly I-instantly!" cried Blaize, rushing upstairs.</p>

  <p>On the way to Mr. Bloundel's chamber, he met Patience, and told her what
  he had heard. She was inclined to put a very different construction on the
  story; but as she bore the apprentice no particular good-will, she determined
  to keep her opinion to herself, and let affairs take their course. The grocer
  was soon aroused, and scarcely able to credit the porter's intelligence, and
  yet fearing something must be wrong, he hastily attired himself, and
  proceeded to Amabel's room. It was empty, and it was evident from the state
  in which everything was left, that she had never retired to rest. Confounded
  by the sight, Bloundel then hurried downstairs in search of the apprentice,
  but he was nowhere to be found. By this time, Mrs. Bloundel had joined him,
  and on hearing Blaize's story, utterly scouted it.</p>

  <p>"It cannot be," she cried. "Leonard could have no motive for acting thus.
  He had our consent to the union, and the sole obstacle to it was Amabel
  herself. Is it likely he would run away with her?"</p>

  <p>"I am sure I do not know," replied Patience, "but he was desperately in
  love, that's certain; and when people are in love, I am told they do very
  strange and unaccountable things. Perhaps he may have carried her off against
  her will."</p>

  <p>"Very likely," rejoined Blaize. "I thought I heard a scream, and should
  have called out at the moment, but a rufus stuck in my throat and prevented
  me."</p>

  <p>"Where is the person who says he intercepted them?" asked Bloundel.</p>

  <p>"In the yard," answered Blaize.</p>

  <p>"Bid him come hither," rejoined his master. "Stay, I will go to him
  myself."</p>

  <p>With this, the whole party, including old Josyna and Stephen&mdash;the two
  boys and little Christiana not having been disturbed&mdash;proceeded to the
  yard, where they found Pillichody in his watchman's dress, who related his
  story more circumstantially than before.</p>

  <p>"I don't believe a word of it," cried Mrs. Bloundel; "and I will stake my
  life it is one of the Earl of Rochester's tricks."</p>

  <p>"Were I assured that such was the case," said the grocer, in a stern
  whisper to his wife, "I would stir no further in the matter. My threat to
  Amabel was not an idle one."</p>

  <p>"I may be mistaken," returned Mrs. Bloundel, almost at her wit's end with
  anxiety. "Don't mind what I say. Judge for yourself. Oh dear! what
  <i>will</i> become of her?" she mentally ejaculated.</p>

  <p>"Lanterns and links!" cried Pillichody. "Do you mean to impeach my
  veracity, good mistress? I am an old soldier, and as tenacious of my honour
  as your husband is of his credit."</p>

  <p>"This blustering will not serve your turn, fellow," observed the grocer,
  seizing him by the collar. "I begin to suspect my wife is in the right, and
  will at all events detain you."</p>

  <p>"Detain me! on what ground?" asked Pillichody.</p>

  <p>"As an accomplice in my daughter's abduction," replied Bloundel. "Here,
  Blaize&mdash;Stephen, hold him while I call the watch. This is a most
  mysterious affair, but I will soon get at the bottom of it."</p>

  <p>By the grocer's directions, Pillichody, who very quietly entered the
  house, and surrendered his halberd to Blaize, was taken to the kitchen.
  Bloundel then set forth, leaving Stephen on guard at the yard door, while his
  wife remained in the shop, awaiting his return.</p>

  <p>On reaching the kitchen with the prisoner, Blaize besought his mother,
  who, as well as Patience, had accompanied him thither, to fetch a bottle of
  sack. While she went for the wine, and the porter was stalking to and fro
  before the door with the halberd on his shoulder, Patience whispered to
  Pillichody, "I know who you are. You came here last night with the Earl of
  Rochester in the disguise of a quack doctor."</p>

  <p>"Hush!" cried Pillichody, placing his finger on his lips.</p>

  <p>"I am not going to betray you," returned Patience, in the same tone. "But
  you are sure to be found out, and had better beat a retreat before Mr.
  Bloundel returns."</p>

  <p>"I won't lose a moment," replied Pillichody, starting to his feet.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" cried Blaize, suddenly halting.</p>

  <p>"I only got up to see whether the wine was coming," replied
  Pillichody.</p>

  <p>"Yes, here it is," replied Blaize, as his mother reappeared; "and now you
  shall have a glass of such sack as you never yet tasted."</p>

  <p>And pouring out a bumper, he offered it to Pillichody. The latter took the
  glass; but his hand shook so violently that he could not raise it to his
  lips.</p>

  <p>"What ails you, friend?" inquired Blaize, uneasily.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," replied Pillichody; "but I feel extremely unwell."</p>

  <p>"He looks to me as if he had got the plague," observed Patience, to
  Blaize.</p>

  <p>"The plague!" exclaimed the latter, letting fall the glass, which shivered
  to pieces on the stone floor. "And I have touched him. Where is the
  vinegar-bottle? I must sprinkle myself directly, and rub myself from head to
  foot with oil of hartshorn and spirits of sulphur. Mother! dear mother! you
  have taken away my medicine-chest. If you love me, go and fetch me a little
  conserve of Roman wormwood and mithridate. You will find them in two small
  jars."</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, do," cried Patience; "or he may die with fright."</p>

  <p>Moved by their joint entreaties, old Josyna again departed; and her back
  was no sooner turned, than Patience said in an undertone to
  Pillichody,&mdash;"Now is your time. You have not a moment to lose."</p>

  <p>Instantly taking the hint, the other uttered a loud cry, and springing up,
  caught at Blaize, who instantly dropped the halberd, and fled into one corner
  of the room.</p>

  <p>Pillichody then hurried upstairs, while Blaize shouted after him, "Don't
  touch him, Master Stephen. He has got the plague! he has got the plague!"</p>

  <p>Alarmed by this outcry, Stephen suffered Pillichody to pass; and the
  latter, darting across the yard, mounted the rope-ladder, and quickly
  disappeared. A few minutes afterwards, Bloundel returned with the watch, and
  was greatly enraged when he found that the prisoner had got off. No longer
  doubting that he had been robbed of his daughter by the Earl of Rochester, he
  could not make up his mind to abandon her to her fate, and his conflicting
  feelings occasioned him a night of indescribable anxiety. The party of watch
  whom he had summoned searched the street for him, and endeavoured to trace
  out the fugitives,&mdash;but without success; and they returned before
  daybreak to report their failure.</p>

  <p>About six o'clock, Mr. Bloundel, unable to restrain himself longer,
  sallied forth with Blaize in search of his daughter and Leonard. Uncertain
  where to bend his steps, he trusted to chance to direct him, resolved, if he
  were unsuccessful, to lay a petition for redress before the throne.
  Proceeding along Cheapside, he entered Paternoster-row, and traversed it till
  he came to Paul's Alley,&mdash;a narrow passage leading to the north-west
  corner of the cathedral. Prompted by an unaccountable impulse, he no sooner
  caught sight of the reverend structure, than he hastened, towards it, and
  knocked against the great northern door.</p>

  <p>We shall, however, precede him, and return to the party at the altar. The
  awful warning of Solomon Eagle so alarmed Quatremain, that he let fall his
  prayer-book, and after gazing vacantly round for a few moments, staggered to
  one of the stalls, where, feeling a burning pain in his breast, he tore open
  his doublet, and found that the enthusiast had spoken the truth, and that he
  was really attacked by the pestilence. As to Amabel, on hearing the terrible
  denunciation, she uttered a loud cry, and would have fallen to the ground but
  for the timely assistance of the apprentice, who caught her with one arm,
  while with the other he defended himself against the earl and his
  companions.</p>

  <p>But, in spite of his resistance, they would have soon compelled him to
  relinquish his charge, if Solomon Eagle, who had hitherto contented himself
  with gazing sternly on what was passing, had not interfered; and, rushing
  towards the combatants, seized Rochester and Etherege, and hurled them
  backwards with almost supernatural force. When they arose, and menaced him
  with their swords, he laughed loudly and contemptuously, crying, "Advance, if
  ye dare! and try your strength against one armed by Heaven, and ye will find
  how far it will avail."</p>

  <p>At this juncture, Leonard Holt heard a musical voice behind him, and
  turning, beheld Nizza Macascree. She beckoned him to follow her; and, raising
  Amabel in his arms, he ran towards the door leading to Saint Faith's, through
  which his conductress passed. All this was the work of a moment, and when
  Rochester and Etherege, who rushed after him, tried the door, they found it
  fastened withinside.</p>

  <p>Just then, a loud knocking was heard at the northern entrance of the
  cathedral, and a verger answering the summons, Mr. Bloundel and Blaize were
  admitted. On beholding the newcomers, Rochester and his companions were
  filled with confusion. Equally astonished at the recounter, the grocer
  grasped his staff, and rushing up to the earl, demanded, in a voice that made
  the other, despite his natural audacity, quail&mdash;"Where is my child, my
  lord? What have you done with her?"</p>

  <p>"I know nothing about her," replied Rochester, with affected
  carelessness.&mdash;"Yes, I am wrong," he added, as if recollecting himself;
  "lam told she has run away with your apprentice."</p>

  <p>Pillichody, who had changed his attire since his escape from the grocer's
  dwelling, thought he might now venture to address him without fear of
  discovery, and, setting his arms a-kimbo, and assuming a swaggering
  demeanour, strutted forward and said, "Your daughter has just been wedded to
  Leonard Holt, Mr. Bloundel."</p>

  <p>"It is false," cried Bloundel, "as false as the character you just
  personated, for I recognise you as the knave who recently appeared before me
  as a watchman."</p>

  <p>"I pledge you my word as a nobleman," interposed Rochester, "that your
  daughter has just descended to Saint Faith's with your apprentice."</p>

  <p>"I can corroborate his lordship's assertion," said Etherege.</p>

  <p>"And I," added Pillichody. "By the holy apostle to whom this fane is
  dedicated! it is so."</p>

  <p>"To convince you that we speak the truth, we will go with you and assist
  you to search," said Rochester.</p>

  <p>Attaching little credit to what he heard, and yet unwilling to lose a
  chance of recovering his daughter, the grocer rushed to the door indicated by
  his informant, but found it fastened.</p>

  <p>"You had better go to the main entrance," said one of the vergers; "I have
  the keys with me, and will admit you."</p>

  <p>"I will keep guard here till you return," said another verger</p>

  <p>Accompanied by Rochester and Etherege, Bloundel then proceeded to the
  chief door of the subterranean church. It was situated at the south of the
  cathedral, between two of the larger buttresses, and at the foot of a flight
  of stone steps. On reaching it, the verger produced his keys, but they were
  of no avail, for the door was barred withinside. After many fruitless
  attempts to obtain admission, they were fain to give up the attempt.</p>

  <p>"Well, if we cannot get in, no one shall get out," observed the verger.
  "The only key that opens this door is in my possession, so we have them safe
  enough."</p>

  <p>The party then returned to the cathedral, where they found Blaize,
  Pillichody, and the two other vergers keeping watch at the door near the
  choir. No one had come forth.</p>

  <p>Rochester then walked apart with his companions, while Bloundel, feeling
  secure so long as he kept the earl in view, folded his arms upon his breast,
  and determined to await the result.</p>

  <p>By this time, the doors being opened, a great crowd was soon collected
  within the sacred structure. Saint Paul's Churchyard, as is well known, was
  formerly the great mart for booksellers, who have not, even in later times,
  deserted the neighbourhood, but still congregate in Paternoster-row,
  Ave-Maria-lane, and the adjoining streets. At the period of this history they
  did not confine themselves to the precincts of the cathedral, but, as has
  been previously intimated, fixed their shops against the massive pillars of
  its nave. Besides booksellers, there were seamstresses, tobacco-merchants,
  vendors of fruit and provisions, and Jews&mdash;all of whom had stalls within
  the cathedral, and who were now making preparations for the business of the
  day. Shortly afterwards, numbers who came for recreation and amusement made
  their appearance, and before ten o'clock, Paul's Walk, as the nave was
  termed, was thronged, by apprentices, rufflers, porters, water-carriers,
  higglers, with baskets on their heads, or under their arms, fish-wives,
  quack-doctors, cutpurses, bonarobas, merchants, lawyers, and serving-men, who
  came to be hired, and who stationed themselves near an oaken block attached
  to one of the pillars, and which was denominated, from the use it was put to,
  the "serving-man's log." Some of the crowd were smoking, some laughing,
  others gathering round a ballad-singer, who was chanting one of Rochester's
  own licentious ditties; some were buying quack medicines and remedies for the
  plague, the virtues of which the vendor loudly extolled; while others were
  paying court to the dames, many of whom were masked. Everything seemed to be
  going forward within this sacred place, except devotion. Here, a man, mounted
  on the carved marble of a monument, bellowed forth the news of the Dutch war,
  while another, not far from him, on a bench, announced in lugubrious accents
  the number of those who had died on the previous day of the pestilence.
  There, at the very font, was a usurer paying over a sum of money to a
  gallant&mdash;it was Sir Paul Parravicin&mdash;who was sealing a bond for
  thrice the amount of the loan. There, a party of choristers, attended by a
  troop of boys, were pursuing another gallant, who had ventured into the
  cathedral booted and spurred, and were demanding "spur-money" of him&mdash;an
  exaction which they claimed as part of their perquisites.</p>

    <p class="caption">Paul's Walk</p>
  </div>


  <p>An admirable picture of this curious scene has been given by Bishop Earle,
  in his <i>Microcosmographia</i>, published in 1629. "Paul's Walk," he writes,
  "is the land's epitome, or you may call it the lesser isle of Great Britain.
  It is more than this&mdash;it is the whole world's map, which you may here
  discern in its perfectest motion, jostling and turning. It is a heap of
  stones and men, with a vast confusion of languages; and were the steeple not
  sanctified, nothing could be liker Babel. The noise in it is like that of
  bees, a strange humming, or buzzing, mixed of walking, tongues, and feet: it
  is a kind of still roar, or loud whisper. It is the great exchange of all
  discourse, and no business whatsoever, but is here stirring and afoot. It is
  the synod of all parts politic, jointed and laid together in most serious
  posture, and they are not half so busy at the Parliament. It is the market of
  young lecturers, whom you may cheapen here at all rates and sizes. It is the
  general mint of all famous lies, which are here, like the legends of Popery,
  first coined and stamped in the church. All inventions are emptied here, and
  not a few pockets. The best sign of the Temple in it is that it is the
  thieves' sanctuary, who rob more safely in a crowd than a wilderness, while
  every pillar is a bush to hide them. It is the other expense of the day,
  after plays and taverns; and men have still some oaths to swear here. The
  visitants are all men without exceptions; but the principal inhabitants are
  stale knights and captains out of service, men of long rapiers and short
  purses, who after all turn merchants here, and traffic for news. Some make it
  a preface to their dinner, and travel for an appetite; but thirstier men make
  it their ordinary, and board here very cheap. Of all such places it is least
  haunted by hobgoblins, for if a ghost would walk here, he could not."</p>

  <p>Decker, moreover, terms Paul's Walk, or the "Mediterranean Isle," in his
  "Gull's Hornbook"&mdash;"the only gallery wherein the pictures of all your
  true fashionate and complimental gulls are, and ought to be, hung up." After
  giving circumstantial directions for the manner of entering the walk, he
  proceeds thus: "Bend your course directly in the middle line that the whole
  body of the church may appear to be yours, where in view of all, you may
  publish your suit in what manner you affect most, either with the slide of
  your cloak from the one shoulder or the other." He then recommends the gull,
  after four or five turns in the nave, to betake himself to some of the
  semsters' shops the new tobacco office, or the booksellers' stalls, "where,
  if you cannot read, exercise your smoke, and inquire who has written against
  the divine weed." Such, or something like it, was Paul's Walk at the period
  of this history.</p>

  <p>The grocer, who had not quitted his post, remained a silent and sorrowful
  spectator of the scene. Despite his anxiety, he could not help moralizing
  upon it, and it furnished him with abundant food for reflection. As to
  Rochester and his companions, they mingled with the crowd&mdash;though the
  earl kept a wary eye on the door&mdash;chatted with the prettiest
  damsels&mdash;listened to the newsmongers, and broke their fast at the stall
  of a vendor of provisions, who supplied them with tolerable viands, and a
  bottle of excellent Rhenish. Blaize was soon drawn away by one of the quacks,
  and, in spite of his master's angry looks, he could not help purchasing one
  of the infallible antidotes offered for sale by the charlatan. Parravicin had
  no sooner finished his business with the usurer than he strolled along the
  nave, and was equally surprised and delighted at meeting with his friends,
  who briefly explained to him why they were there.</p>

  <p>"And how do you expect the adventure to terminate?" asked Parravicin,
  laughing heartily at the recital.</p>

  <p>"Heaven knows," replied the earl. "But what are you doing here?"</p>

  <p>"I came partly to replenish my purse, for I have had a run of ill luck of
  late," replied the knight; "and partly to see a most beautiful creature, whom
  I accidentally discovered here yesterday."</p>

  <p>"A new beauty!" cried Rochester. "Who is she?"</p>

  <p>"Before I tell you, you must engage not to interfere with me," replied
  Parravicin. "I have marked her for my own."</p>

  <p>"Agreed," replied Rochester. "Now, her name?"</p>

  <p>"She is the daughter of a blind piper, who haunts the cathedral," replied
  Parravicin, "and her name is Nizza Macascree. Is it not charming? But you
  shall see her."</p>

  <p>"We must not go too far from the door of Saint Faith's," rejoined
  Rochester. "Can you not contrive to bring her hither?"</p>

  <p>"That is more easily said than done," replied Parravicin. "She is as coy
  as the grocer's daughter. However, I will try to oblige you."</p>

  <p>With this, he quitted his companions, and returning shortly afterwards,
  said, "My mistress has likewise disappeared. I found the old piper seated at
  the entrance of Bishop Kempe's chapel, attended by his dog&mdash;but he
  missed his daughter when he awoke in the morning, and is in great trouble
  about her."</p>

  <p>"Strange!" cried Etherege; "I begin to think the place is enchanted."</p>

  <p>"It would seem so, indeed," replied Rochester.</p>

  <p>While they were thus conversing, Pillichody, who was leaning against a
  column, with his eye fixed upon the door leading to Saint Faith's, observed
  it open, and the apprentice issue from it accompanied by two masked females.
  All three attempted to dart across the transept and gain the northern
  entrance, but they were Intercepted. Mr. Bloundel caught hold of Leonard's
  arm, and Rochester seized her whom he judged by the garb to be Amabel, while
  Parravicin, recognising Nizza Macascree, as he thought, by her dress,
  detained her.</p>

  <p>"What is the meaning of all this, Leonard?" demanded the grocer,
  angrily.</p>

  <p>"You shall have an explanation instantly," replied the apprentice; "but
  think not of me&mdash;think only of your daughter."</p>

  <p>"My father!&mdash;my father!" cried the damsel, who had been detained by
  Parravicin, taking off her mask, and rushing towards the grocer.</p>

  <p>"Who then have I got?" cried Rochester.</p>

  <p>"The piper's daughter, I'll be sworn," replied Etherege.</p>

  <p>"You are right," replied Nizza, unmasking. "I changed dresses with Amabel,
  and hoped by so doing to accomplish her escape, but we have been baffled.
  However, as her father is here, it is of little consequence."</p>

  <p>"Amabel," said the grocer, repulsing her, "before I receive you again, I
  must be assured that you have not been alone with the Earl of Rochester."</p>

  <p>"She has not, sir," replied the apprentice. "Visit your displeasure on my
  head. I carried her off and would have wedded her."</p>

  <p>"What motive had you for this strange conduct?" asked Bloundel,
  incredulously.</p>

  <p>Before Leonard could answer, Pillichody stepped forward, and said to the
  grocer, "Mr. Bloundel, you are deceived&mdash;on the faith of a soldier you
  are."</p>

  <p>"Peace, fool!" said Rochester, "I will not be outdone in generosity by an
  apprentice. Leonard Holt speaks the truth."</p>

  <p>"If so," replied Bloundel, "he shall never enter my house again. Send for
  your indentures to-night," he continued sharply, to Leonard, "but never
  venture to approach me more."</p>

  <p>"Father, you are mistaken," cried Amabel. "Leonard Holt is not to blame. I
  alone deserve your displeasure."</p>

  <p>"Be silent!" whispered the apprentice; "you destroy yourself. I care not
  what happens to me, provided you escape the earl."</p>

  <p>"Come home, mistress," cried the grocer, dragging her through the crowd
  which had gathered round them.</p>

  <p>"Here is a pretty conclusion to the adventure!" cried Parravicin; "but
  where is the apprentice&mdash;and where is the pretty Nizza Macascree? 'Fore
  heaven," he added, as he looked around for them in vain, "I should not wonder
  if they have eloped together."</p>

  <p>"Nor I," replied Rochester. "I admire the youth's spirit, and trust he may
  be more fortunate with his second mistress than with his first."</p>

  <p>"It shall be my business to prevent that," rejoined Parravicin. "Help me
  to search for her."</p>

  <p>* * * * *</p>

  <h2><a id="ch2-8"
     name="ch2-8">VIII. &mdash; THE AMULET.</a></h2>

  <p>As the grocer disappeared with his daughter, Nizza Macascree, who had
  anxiously watched the apprentice, observed him turn deadly pale, and stagger;
  and instantly springing to his side, she supported him to a neighbouring
  column, against which he leaned till he had in some degree recovered from the
  shock. He then accompanied her to Bishop Kempe's beautiful chapel in the
  northern aisle, where she expected to find her father; but it was empty.</p>

  <p>"He will be back presently," said Nizza. "He is no doubt making the rounds
  of the cathedral. Bell will take care of him. Sit down on that bench while I
  procure you some refreshment. You appear much in need of it."</p>

  <p>And without waiting for a reply, she ran off, and presently afterwards
  returned with a small loaf of bread and a bottle of beer.</p>

  <p>"I cannot eat," said Leonard, faintly. But seeing that his kind provider
  looked greatly disappointed, he swallowed a few mouthfuls, and raised the
  bottle to his lips. As he did so, a sudden feeling of sickness seized him,
  and he set it down untasted.</p>

  <p>"What ails you?" asked Nizza, noticing his altered looks with
  uneasiness.</p>

  <p>"I know not," he replied. "I have never felt so ill before."</p>

  <p>"I thought you were suffering from agitation," she rejoined, as a fearful
  foreboding crossed her.</p>

  <p>"I shall be speedily released from further trouble," replied the
  apprentice. "I am sure I am attacked by the plague."</p>

  <p>"Oh! say not so!" she rejoined. "You may be mistaken."</p>

  <p>But though she tried to persuade herself she spoke the truth, her heart
  could not be deceived.</p>

  <p>"I scarcely desire to live," replied the apprentice, in a melancholy tone,
  "for life has lost all charms for me. But do not remain here, or you may be
  infected by the distemper."</p>

  <p>"I will never leave you," she hastily rejoined; "that is," she added,
  checking herself, "till I have placed you in charge of some one who will
  watch over you."</p>

  <p>"No one will watch over me," returned Leonard. "My master has dismissed me
  from his service, and I have no other friend left. If you will tell one of
  the vergers what is the matter with me, he will summon the Examiner of
  Health, who will bring a litter to convey me to the pest-house."</p>

  <p>"If you go thither your fate is sealed," replied Nizza.</p>

  <p>"I have said I do not desire to live," returned the apprentice.</p>

  <p>"Do not indulge in these gloomy thoughts, or you are certain to bring
  about a fatal result," said Nizza. "Would I knew how to aid you! But I still
  hope you are deceived as to the nature of your attack."</p>

  <p>"I cannot be deceived," replied Leonard, whose countenance proclaimed the
  anguish he endured. "Doctor Hodges, I think, is interested about me," he
  continued, describing the physician's residence&mdash;"if you will inform him
  of my seizure, he may, perhaps, come to me."</p>

  <p>"I will fly to him instantly," replied Nizza; and she was about to quit
  the chapel, when she was stopped by Parravicin and his companions.</p>

  <p>"Let me pass," she said, trying to force her way through them.</p>

  <p>"Not so fast, fair Nizza," rejoined Parravicin, forcing her back, "I must
  have a few words with you. Have I overrated her charms?" he added to
  Rochester. "Is she not surpassingly beautiful?"</p>

  <p>"In good sooth she is," replied the earl, gazing at her with
  admiration.</p>

  <p>"By the nut-brown skin of Cleopatra!" cried Pillichody, "she beats Mrs.
  Disbrowe, Sir Paul."</p>

  <p>"I have never seen any one so lovely," said the knight, attempting to
  press her hand to his lips.</p>

  <p>"Release me, sir," cried Nizza, struggling to free herself.</p>

  <p>"Not till I have told you how much I love you," returned the knight,
  ardently.</p>

  <p>"Love me!" she echoed, scornfully.</p>

  <p>"Yes, love you," reiterated Parravicin. "It would be strange if I, who
  profess myself so great an admirer of beauty, did otherwise. I am
  passionately enamoured of you. If you will accompany me, fair Nizza, you
  shall change your humble garb for the richest attire that gold can purchase,
  shall dwell in a magnificent mansion, and have troops of servants at your
  command. In short, my whole fortune, together with myself, shall be placed at
  your disposal."</p>

  <p>"Do not listen to him, Nizza," cried Leonard Holt, in a faint voice.</p>

  <p>"Be assured I will not," she answered. "Your insulting proposal only
  heightens the disgust I at first conceived for you," she added to the knight:
  "I reject it with scorn, and command you to let me pass."</p>

  <p>"Nay, if you put on these airs, sweetheart," replied Parravicin,
  insolently, "I must alter my tone likewise. I am not accustomed to play the
  humble suitor to persons of your condition."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not," replied Nizza; "neither am I accustomed to this
  unwarrantable usage. Let me go. My errand is one of life and death. Do not
  hinder me, or you will have a heavy crime on your soul&mdash;heavier, it may
  be, than any that now loads it."</p>

  <p>"Where are you going?" asked Parravicin, struck by her earnest manner.</p>

  <p>"To fetch assistance," she replied, "for one suddenly assailed by the
  pestilence."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" exclaimed the knight, trembling, and relinquishing his grasp. "My
  path is ever crossed by that hideous spectre. Is it your father who is thus
  attacked?"</p>

  <p>"No," she replied, pointing to Leonard, "it is that youth."</p>

  <p>"The apprentice!" exclaimed Rochester. "I am sorry for him. Let us be
  gone," he added to his companions. "It may be dangerous to remain here
  longer."</p>

  <p>With this they all departed except Parravicin.</p>

  <p>"Come with us, Nizza," said the latter; "we will send assistance to the
  sufferer."</p>

  <p>"I have already told you my determination," she rejoined; "I will not stir
  a footstep with you. And if you have any compassion in your nature, you will
  not detain me longer."</p>

  <p>"I will not leave you here to certain destruction," said the knight. "You
  shall come with me whether you will or not."</p>

  <p>And as he spoke, he advanced towards her, while she retreated towards
  Leonard, who, rising with difficulty, placed himself between her and her
  persecutor.</p>

  <p>"If you advance another footstep," cried the apprentice, "I will fling
  myself upon you, and the contact may be fatal."</p>

  <p>Parravicin gazed, furiously at him, and half unsheathed his sword. But the
  next moment he returned it to the scabbard, and exclaiming, "Another time!
  another time!" darted after his companions.</p>

  <p>He was scarcely gone, when Leonard reeled against the wall, and before
  Nizza could catch him, fell in a state of insensibility on the floor.</p>

  <p>After vainly attempting to raise him, Nizza flew for assistance, and had
  just passed through the door of the chapel, when she met Judith Malmayns and
  Chowles. She instantly stopped them, and acquainting them with the
  apprentice's condition, implored them to take charge of him while she went in
  search of Doctor Hodges.</p>

  <p>"Before you go," said Judith, "let me make sure that he is attacked by the
  plague. It may be some other disorder."</p>

  <p>"I hope so, indeed," said Nizza, pausing; "but I fear the contrary."</p>

  <p>So saying, she returned with them to the chapel. Raising the apprentice
  with the greatest ease, Judith tore open his doublet.</p>

  <p>"Your suspicion is correct," she said, with a malignant smile. "Here is
  the fatal sign upon his breast."</p>

  <p>"I will fetch Doctor Hodges instantly," cried Nizza.</p>

  <p>"Do so," replied Judith; "we will convey him to the vaults in Saint
  Faith's, where poor Mr. Quatremain has just been taken. He will be better
  there than in the pest-house."</p>

  <p>"Anything is better than that," said Nizza, shuddering.</p>

  <p>As soon as she was gone, Chowles took off his long black cloak, and,
  throwing it over the apprentice, laid him at full length upon the bench, and,
  assisted by Judith, carried him towards the choir. As they proceeded, Chowles
  called out, "Make way for one sick of the plague!" and the crowd instantly
  divided, and gave them free passage. In this way they descended to Saint
  Faith's, and, shaping their course to the vault, deposited their burden on
  the very bed lately occupied by the unfortunate sexton.</p>

  <p>"He has come here to die," observed Judith to her companion. "His attack
  is but a slight one, and he might with care recover. But I can bargain with
  the Earl of Rochester for his removal."</p>

  <p>"Take heed how you make such a proposal to his lordship," returned
  Chowles. "From what I have seen, he is likely to, revolt at it."</p>

  <p>"Every man is glad to get rid of a rival," rejoined Judith.</p>

  <p>"Granted," replied Chowles; "but no man will <i>pay</i> for the riddance
  when the plague will accomplish it for him for nothing."</p>

  <p>"With due attention, I would answer for that youth's recovery," said
  Judith. "It is not an incurable case, like Mr. Quatremain's. And so Doctor
  Hodges, when he comes, will pronounce it."</p>

  <p>Shortly after this, Nizza Macaseree appeared with a countenance fraught
  with anxiety, and informed them that Doctor Hodges was from home, and would
  not probably return till late at night.</p>

  <p>"That's unfortunate," said Judith. "Luckily, however, there are other
  doctors in London, and some who understand the treatment of the plague far
  better than he does&mdash;Sibbald, the apothecary of Clerkenwell, for
  instance."</p>

  <p>"Do you think Sibbald would attend him?" asked Nizza, eagerly.</p>

  <p>"To be sure he would," replied Mrs. Malmayns, "if he were paid for it. But
  you seem greatly interested about this youth. I have been young, and know
  what effect good looks and a manly deportment have upon our sex. He has won
  your heart! Ha! ha! You need not seek to disguise it. Your blushes answer for
  you."</p>

  <p>"A truce to this," cried Nizza, whose cheeks glowed with shame and
  anger.</p>

  <p>"You can answer a plain question, I suppose," returned Judith. "Is his
  life dear to you?"</p>

  <p>"Dearer than my own?" replied Nizza.</p>

  <p>"I thought as much," returned Judith. "What will you give me to save
  him?"</p>

  <p>"I have nothing," rejoined Nizza, with a troubled look&mdash;"nothing but
  thanks to give you."</p>

  <p>"Think again," said Judith. "Girls like you, if they have no money, have
  generally some trinket&mdash;some valuable in their possession."</p>

  <p>"That is not my case," said Nizza, bursting into tears. "I never received
  a present in my life, and never desired one till now."</p>

  <p>"But your father must have some money?" said Judith, inquisitively.</p>

  <p>"I know not," replied Nizza, "but I will ask him. What sum will content
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Bring all you can," returned Judith, "and I will do my best."</p>

  <p>Nizza then departed, while Judith, with the assistance of Chowles, covered
  Leonard with blankets, and proceeded to light a fire. Long before this, the
  sick youth was restored to animation. But he was quite light-headed and
  unconscious of his situation, and rambled about Amabel and her father. After
  administering such remedies as she thought fit, and as were at hand, Judith
  sat down with the coffin-maker beside a small table, and entered into
  conversation with him.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Chowles, in an indifferent tone, as he poured out a glass of
  brandy, "is it to be kill or cure?"</p>

  <p>"I have not decided," replied Judith, pledging him.</p>

  <p>"I still do not see what gain there would be in shortening his career,"
  observed Chowles.</p>

  <p>"If there would be no gain, there would be gratification," replied Judith.
  "He has offended me."</p>

  <p>"If that is the case, I have nothing further to say," returned Chowles.
  "But you promised the piper's daughter to save him."</p>

  <p>"We shall see what she offers," rejoined Judith; "all will depend upon
  that."</p>

  <p>"It is extraordinary," observed Chowles, after a pause, "that while all
  around us are sick or dying of the pestilence, we should escape
  contagion."</p>

  <p>"We are not afraid of it," replied Judith. "Besides, we are part of the
  plague ourselves. But I <i>have</i> been attacked, and am, therefore,
  safe."</p>

  <p>"True," replied Chowles; "I had forgotten that. Well, if I fall ill, you
  Sha'n't nurse me."</p>

  <p>"You won't be able to help yourself then," returned Judith.</p>

  <p>"Eh!" exclaimed Chowles, shifting uneasily on his seat.</p>

  <p>"Don't be afraid," returned Judith, laughing at his alarm. "I'll take
  every care of you. We are necessary to each other."</p>

  <p>"So we are," replied Chowles; "so we are; and if nothing else could, that
  consideration would make us true to each other."</p>

  <p>"Of course," assented Judith. "Let us reap as rich a harvest as we can,
  and when the scourge is over, we can enjoy ourselves upon the spoils."</p>

  <p>"Exactly so," replied Chowles. "My business is daily-hourly on the
  increase. My men are incessantly employed, and my only fear is that an order
  will be issued to bury the dead without coffins."</p>

  <p>"Not unlikely," replied Mrs. Malmayns. "But there are plenty of ways of
  getting money in a season like this. If one fails, we must resort to another.
  I shall make all I can, and in the shortest manner."</p>

  <p>"Right!" cried Chowles, with, an atrocious laugh. "Right! ha! ha!"</p>

  <p>"I have found out a means of propagating the distemper," pursued Judith,
  in a low tone, and with a mysterious air, "of inoculating whomsoever I please
  with the plague-venom. I have tried the experiment on Mr. Quatremain and that
  youth, and you see how well it has answered in both instances."</p>

  <p>"I do," replied Chowles, looking askance at her. "But why destroy the poor
  minor canon?"</p>

  <p>"Because I want to get hold of the treasure discovered by the help of the
  Mosaical rods in Saint Faith's, which by right belonged to my husband, and
  which is now in Mr. Quatremain's possession," replied Judith.</p>

  <p>"I understand," nodded Chowles.</p>

  <p>While they were thus conversing, Nizza Macascree again returned, and
  informed them that she could not find her father. "He has left the
  cathedral," she said, "and will not, probably, return till nightfall."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry for it, on your account," observed Judith, coldly.</p>

  <p>"Why, you will not have the cruelty to neglect the poor young man till
  then&mdash;you will take proper precautions?" exclaimed Nizza.</p>

  <p>"Why should I exert myself for one about whose recovery I am indifferent?"
  said Judith.</p>

  <p>"Why?" exclaimed Nizza. "But it is in vain to argue with you. I must
  appeal to your avarice, since you are deaf to the pleadings of humanity. I
  have just bethought me that I have an old gold coin, which was given me years
  ago by my father. He told me it had been my mother's, and charged me not to
  part with it. I never should have done so, except in an emergency like the
  present."</p>

  <p>As she spoke, she drew from her bosom a broad gold piece. A hole was bored
  through it, and it was suspended from her neck by a chain of twisted
  hair.</p>

  <p>"Let me look at it," said Judith taking the coin. "Who gave you this?" she
  asked, in an altered tone.</p>

  <p>"My father?" replied Nizza; "I have just told you so. It was my
  mother's."</p>

  <p>"Impossible!" exclaimed Judith!</p>

  <p>"Have you ever seen it before?" inquired Nizza, astonished at the change
  in the nurse's manner.</p>

  <p>"I have," replied Judith, "and in very different hands."</p>

  <p>"You surprise me," cried Nizza. "Explain yourself, I beseech you."</p>

  <p>"Not now&mdash;not now," cried Judith, hastily returning the coin. "And
  this is to be mine in case I cure the youth?"</p>

  <p>"I have said so," replied Nizza.</p>

  <p>"Then make yourself easy," rejoined Judith; "he shall be well again in
  less than two days."</p>

  <p>With this, she set a pan on the fire, and began to prepare a poultice, the
  materials for which she took from a small oaken chest in one corner of the
  vault. Nizza looked on anxiously, and while they were thus employed, a knock
  was heard at the door, and Chowles opening it, found the piper and one of the
  vergers.</p>

  <p>"Ah! is it you, father?" cried Nizza, rushing to him.</p>

  <p>"I am glad I have found you," returned the piper, "for I began to fear
  some misfortune must have befallen you. Missing you in the morning, I
  traversed the cathedral in search of you with Bell, well knowing, if you were
  in the crowd, she would speedily discover you."</p>

  <p>His daughter then hastily recounted what had happened. When the piper
  heard that she had promised the piece of gold to the plague-nurse, a cloud
  came over his open countenance.</p>

  <p>"You must never part with it," he said&mdash;"never. It is an amulet, and
  if you lose it, or give it away, your good luck will go with it."</p>

  <p>"Judith Malmayns says she has seen it before," rejoined Nizza.</p>

  <p>"No such thing," cried the piper hastily, "she knows nothing about it. But
  come with me. You must not stay here longer."</p>

  <p>"But, father&mdash;dear father!&mdash;I want a small sum to pay the nurse
  for attending this poor young man," cried Nizza.</p>

  <p>"I have no money," replied the piper; "and if I had, I should not throw it
  away in so silly a manner. Come along; I shall begin think you are in love
  with the youth."</p>

  <p>"Then you will not be far wide of the mark," observed Judith,
  coarsely.</p>

  <p>The piper uttered an angry exclamation, and taking his daughter's hand,
  dragged her out of the vault.</p>

  <p>"You will not get your fee," laughed Chowles, as they were left alone.</p>

  <p>"So it appears," replied Judith, taking the pan from the fire; "there is
  no use in wasting a poultice."</p>

  <p>Shortly after this, the door of the vault again opened, and Parravicin
  looked in. He held a handkerchief sprinkled with vinegar to his face, and had
  evidently, from the manner in which he spoke, some antidote against the
  plague in his mouth.</p>

  <p>"Nizza Macascree has been here, has she not?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"She has just left with her father," replied Judith.</p>

  <p>Parravicin beckoned her to follow him, and led the way to the north aisle
  of Saint Faith's.</p>

  <p>"Is the apprentice likely to recover?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Humph!" exclaimed Judith; "that depends upon circumstances. Nizza
  Macascree offered me a large reward to cure him."</p>

  <p>"Is he any connexion of hers?" asked the knight, sharply.</p>

  <p>"None whatever," returned Judith, with a significant smile. "But he may
  possibly be so."</p>

  <p>"I thought as much," muttered the knight.</p>

  <p>"He never <i>shall</i> recover," said Judith, halting, and speaking in a
  low tone, "if you make it worth my while."</p>

  <p>"You read my wishes," replied Parravicin, in a sombre tone. "Take this
  purse, and free me from him."</p>

  <p>"He will never more cross your path," replied Judith, eagerly grasping the
  reward.</p>

  <p>"Enough!" exclaimed Parravicin. "What has passed between us must be
  secret."</p>

  <p>"As the grave which shall soon close over the victim," she rejoined.</p>

  <p>Parravicin shuddered, and hurried away, while Judith returned at a slow
  pace, and chinking the purse as she went to the vault.</p>

  <p>She had scarcely passed through the door, when Nizza Macascree appeared
  from behind one of the massive pillars. "This dreadful crime must be
  prevented," she cried&mdash;"but how? If I run to give the alarm, it may be
  executed, and no one will believe me. I will try to prevent it myself."</p>

  <p>Crossing the channel, she was about to enter the vault, when Chowles
  stepped forth. She shrank backwards, and allowed him to pass, and then trying
  the door, found it unfastened.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch2-9"
     name="ch2-9">IX. &mdash; HOW LEONARD WAS CURED OF THE PLAGUE.</a></h2>

  <p>Nizza Macascree found Judith leaning over her intended victim, and
  examining the plague-spot on his breast. The nurse was so occupied by her
  task that she did not hear the door open, and it was not until the piper's
  daughter was close beside her, that she was aware of her presence. Hastily
  drawing the blankets over the apprentice, she then turned, and regarded Nizza
  with a half-fearful, half-menacing look.</p>

  <p>"What brings you here again?" she inquired, sharply.</p>

  <p>"Ask your own heart, and it will tell you," rejoined Nizza, boldly. "I am
  come to preserve the life of this poor youth."</p>

  <p>"If you think you can nurse him better than I can, you can take my place
  and welcome," returned Judith, affecting not to understand her; "I have
  plenty of other business to attend to, and should be glad to be released from
  the trouble."</p>

  <p>"Can she already have effected her fell purpose?" thought Nizza, gazing at
  the apprentice, whose perturbed features proclaimed that his slumber procured
  him no rest from suffering. "No&mdash;no&mdash;she has not had time. I accept
  your offer," she added, aloud.</p>

  <p>"But what will your father say to this arrangement?" asked Judith.</p>

  <p>"When he knows my motive, he will not blame me," answered Nizza. "Here I
  take my place," she continued, seating herself, "and will not quit it till he
  is out of danger."</p>

  <p>"Your love for this youth borders upon insanity," cried Judith, angrily.
  "You shall not destroy yourself thus."</p>

  <p>"Neither shall you destroy him," retorted Nizza. "It is to prevent the
  commission of the crime you meditate, and for which you have been
  <i>paid</i>, that I am determined to remain with him."</p>

  <p>As she said this, a singular and frightful change took place in the
  nurse's appearance. A slight expression of alarm was at first visible, but it
  was instantly succeeded by a look so savage and vindictive, that Nizza almost
  repented having provoked the ire of so unscrupulous a person. But summoning
  up all her resolution, she returned Judith's glance with one as stern and
  steady, if not so malignant as her own. A deep silence prevailed for a few
  minutes, during which each fancied she could read the other's thoughts. In
  Nizza's opinion, the nurse was revolving some desperate expedient, and she
  kept on her guard, lest an attack should be made upon her life. And some such
  design did, in reality, cross Judith; but abandoning it as soon as formed,
  she resolved to have recourse to more secret, but not less certain
  measures.</p>

  <p>"Well," she said, breaking silence, "since you are determined to have your
  own way, and catch the plague, and most likely perish from it, I shall not
  try to hinder you. Do what you please, and see what will come of it."</p>

  <p>And she made as if about to depart; but finding Nizza did not attempt to
  stop her, she halted.</p>

  <p>"I cannot leave you thus," she continued; "if you <i>will</i> remain, take
  this ointment," producing a small jar, "and rub the plague-spot with it. It
  is a sovereign remedy, and will certainly effect a cure."</p>

  <p>"I will not touch it," returned Nizza.</p>

  <p>"His death, then, be upon your head," rejoined Judith, quitting the vault,
  and closing the door after her.</p>

  <p>Greatly relieved by her departure, Nizza began to consider what she should
  do, and whether it would be possible to remove the apprentice to some safer
  place. "While occupied with these reflections, the object of her solicitude
  heaved a deep sigh, and opening his eyes, fixed them upon her. It was
  evident, however, that he did not know her, but as far as could be gathered
  from his ravings, mistook her for Amabel. By degrees he grew calmer, and the
  throbbing anguish of the tumour in some measure subsiding, his faculties
  returned to him.</p>

  <p>"Where am I?" he exclaimed, pressing his hand forcibly to his brow, "and
  what is the matter with me?"</p>

  <p>"You are in a vault, near Saint Faith's," replied Nizza, "and&mdash;I will
  not deceive you&mdash;the disorder you are labouring under is the
  plague."</p>

  <p>"The plague!" echoed Leonard, with a look of horror. "Ah! now I recollect.
  I was attacked immediately after Amabel's departure with her father. Heaven
  be praised! she is safe. That is some consolation amid all this misery. Could
  my master behold me now, he would pity me, and so perhaps would his
  daughter."</p>

  <p>"Heed her not," rejoined Nizza, in a slightly reproachful tone, "she does
  not deserve consideration. To return to yourself. You are not safe here.
  Judith Malmayns has been hired to take away your life. Are you able to move
  hence?"</p>

  <p>"I hope so," replied Leonard, raising himself on his arm.</p>

  <p>"Wrap a blanket round you, then, and follow me," said Nizza, taking up the
  lamp and hastening to the door. "Ah!" she exclaimed, with a cry of
  anguish&mdash;"it is locked."</p>

  <p>"This building is destined to be my prison, and that treacherous woman my
  gaoler," groaned Leonard, sinking backwards.</p>

  <p>"Do not despair," cried Nizza; "I will accomplish your deliverance."</p>

  <p>So saying, she tried, by knocking against the door and by loud outcries,
  to give the alarm. But no answer was returned, and she soon became convinced
  that Judith had fastened the door of the charnel, which, it will be
  remembered, lay between the vault and the body of Saint Faith's. Hence, no
  sound could teach the outer structure. Disturbed by what had just occurred.
  Leonard's senses again wandered; but, exerting all her powers to tranquillize
  him, Nizza at last succeeded so well that he sunk into a slumber.</p>

  <p>Almost regarding his situation as hopeless, she took up the lamp, and
  searching the vault, found the pan containing the half-made poultice. The
  fire smouldered on the hearth, and replenishing it from a scanty supply in
  one corner, she heated the poultice and applied it to the tumour. This done,
  she continued her search. But though she found several phials, each bearing
  the name of some remedy for the pestilence, her distrust of Judith would not
  allow her to use any of them. Resuming her seat by the couch of the sufferer,
  and worn out with fatigue and anxiety, she presently dropped asleep.</p>

  <p>She was awakened after awhile by a slight noise near her, and beheld
  Judith bending over the apprentice, with a pot of ointment in her hand, which
  she was about to apply to the part affected. The poultice had already been
  removed. Uttering a loud cry, Nizza started to her feet, and snatching the
  ointment from the nurse, threw it away. As soon as the latter recovered from
  her surprise, she seized her assailant, and forced her into the seat she had
  just quitted.</p>

  <p>"Stir not till I give you permission," she cried, fiercely; "I wish to
  cure this young man, if you will let me."</p>

  <p>"You intend to murder him," replied Nizza; "but while I live you shall
  never accomplish your atrocious purpose. Help! help!" And she uttered a
  prolonged piercing scream.</p>

  <p>"Peace! or I will strangle you," cried Judith, compressing Nizza's slender
  throat with a powerful gripe.</p>

  <p>And she would, in all probability, have executed her terrible threat, if a
  secret door in the wall had not suddenly opened and admitted Solomon Eagle. A
  torch supplied the place of his brazier, and he held it aloft, and threw its
  ruddy light upon the scene. On seeing him, Judith relinquished her grasp, and
  glared at him with a mixture of defiance and apprehension; while Nizza, half
  dead with terror, instantly rushed towards him, and throwing herself at his
  feet, besought him to save her.</p>

  <p>"No harm shall befall you," replied Solomon Eagle, extending his arm over
  her. "Tell me what has happened."</p>

  <p>Nizza hastily explained the motive of Judith's attack upon her life. The
  plague-nurse endeavoured to defend herself, and, in her turn, charged her
  accuser with a like attempt. But Solomon Eagle interrupted her.</p>

  <p>"Be silent, false woman!" he cried, "and think not to delude me with these
  idle fabrications. I fully believe that you would have taken the life of this
  poor youth, and, did I not regard you as one of the necessary agents of
  Heaven's vengeance, I would instantly deliver you up to justice. But the
  measure of your iniquities is not yet filled up. Your former crimes are not
  unknown to me. Neither is the last dark deed, which you imagined concealed
  from every human eye, hidden from me."</p>

  <p>"I know not what you mean," returned Judith, trembling, in spite of
  herself.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you, then," rejoined Solomon Eagle, catching her hand, and
  dragging her into the furthest corner of the vault. "Give ear to me," he
  continued, in a low voice, "and doubt, if you can, that I have witnessed what
  I relate. I saw you enter a small chamber behind the vestry, in which Thomas
  Quatremain, who once filled the place of minor canon in this cathedral, was
  laid. No one was there beside yourself and the dying man. Your first business
  was to search his vestments, and take away his keys."</p>

  <p>"Ha!" exclaimed Judith, starting.</p>

  <p>"While securing his keys," pursued Solomon Eagle, "the owner awakened, and
  uttered a low, but angry remonstrance. Better he had been silent. Dipping a
  napkin in an ewer of water that stood beside him, you held the wet cloth over
  his face, and did not remove it till life was extinct. All this I saw."</p>

  <p>"But you will not reveal it," said Judith, tremblingly.</p>

  <p>"I will not," replied Solomon Eagle, "for the reasons I have just stated;
  namely, that I look upon you as one of the scourges appointed by Heaven."</p>

  <p>"And so I am," rejoined Judith, with impious exultation; "it is my mission
  to destroy and pillage, and I will fulfil it."</p>

  <p>"Take heed you do not exceed it," replied Solomon Eagle. "Lift a finger
  against either of these young persons, and I will reveal all. Yes," he
  continued, menacingly, "I will disclose such dreadful things against you,
  that you will assuredly be adjudged to a gibbet higher than the highest tower
  of this proud fane."</p>

  <p>"I defy you, wretch!" retorted Judith. "You can prove nothing against
  me."</p>

  <p>"Defy me?&mdash;ha!" cried Solomon Eagle, with a terrible laugh. "First,"
  he added, dashing her backwards against the wall&mdash;"first, to prove my
  power. Next," he continued, drawing from her pockets a bunch of keys, "to
  show that I speak the truth. These were taken from the vest of the murdered
  man. No one, as yet, but ourselves, knows that he is dead."</p>

  <p>"And who shall say which of the two is the murderer?" cried Judith.
  "Villain! I charge you with the deed."</p>

  <p>"You are, indeed, well fitted for your appointed task," returned Solomon
  Eagle, gazing at her with astonishment, "for sometimes Heaven, for its own
  wise purpose, will allow the children of hell to execute its vengeance upon
  earth. But think not you will always thus escape. No, you may pursue your
  evil course for a while&mdash;you, and your companion in crime; but a day of
  retribution will arrive for both&mdash;a day when ye shall be devoured,
  living, by flames of fire&mdash;when all your sins shall arise before your
  eyes, and ye shall have no time for repentance&mdash;and when ye shall pass
  from one fierce fire to another yet fiercer, and wholly unquenchable!"</p>

  <p>As he concluded, he again dashed her against the wall with such violence
  that she fell senseless upon the ground.</p>

  <p>"And now," he said, turning to Nizza Macascree, who looked on in alarm and
  surprise, "what can I do for you?"</p>

  <p>"Bear this youth to a place of safety," was her answer.</p>

  <p>Solomon Eagle answered by lifting up the pallet upon which Leonard was
  laid, with as much ease as if it had been an infant's cradle, and calling on
  Nizza to bring the torch, passed with his burden through the secret door.
  Directing her to close it after them, he took his way alone a narrow stone
  passage, until he came to a chink in the wall commanding a small chamber, and
  desired her to look through it. She obeyed, and beheld, stretched upon a
  couch, the corpse of a man.</p>

  <p>"It is Mr. Quatremain, the minor canon," she said, retiring.</p>

  <p>"It is," returned Solomon Eagle, "and it will be supposed that he died of
  the plague. But his end was accelerated by Judith Malmayns."</p>

  <p>Without allowing her time for reply, he pursued his course, traversing
  another long, narrow passage.</p>

  <p>"Where are we?" asked Nizza, as they arrived at the foot of a spiral stone
  staircase.</p>

  <p>"Beneath the central tower of the cathedral," replied Solomon Eagle. "I
  will take you to a cell known only to myself, where this youth will be in
  perfect safety."</p>

  <p>Ascending the staircase, they passed through an arched door, and entered
  the great northern ambulatory. Nizza gazed down for a moment into the nave,
  but all was buried in darkness, and no sound reached her to give her an idea
  that any one was below. Proceeding towards the west, Solomon Eagle arrived at
  a small recess in the wall opposite one of the broad-arched openings looking
  into the nave, and entering it, pressed against a spring at the further
  extremity, and a stone door flying open, discovered a secret cell, on the
  floor of which his brazier was burning. Depositing his burden on the floor,
  he said to Nizza, "He is now safe. Go in search of proper assistance, and I
  will watch by him till you return."</p>

  <p>Nizza did not require a second exhortation, but quitting the cell, and
  noticing its situation, swiftly descended the winding staircase, and hurrying
  along the northern aisle, proceeded to a small chamber beneath the tower at
  its western extremity, which she knew was occupied by one of the vergers.
  Speedily arousing him, she told him her errand, and implored him to remain on
  the watch till she returned with Doctor Hodges. The verger promised
  compliance; and, opening a wicket in the great doorway, allowed her to go
  forth. A few seconds brought her to the doctor's dwelling, and though it was
  an hour after midnight, her summons was promptly answered by the old porter,
  who conveyed her message to his master. Doctor Hodges had just retired to
  rest; but, on learning in whose behalf his services were required, he sprang
  out of bed, and hastily slipped on his clothes.</p>

  <p>"I would not, for half I am worth, that that poor youth should perish," he
  cried. "I take a great interest in him&mdash;a very great interest. He must
  not be neglected. How comes he at Saint Paul's, I wonder? But I can obtain
  information on that point as I go thither. No time must be lost."</p>

  <p>Ruminating thus, he swallowed a glass of sack, and providing himself with
  a case of instruments, and such medicines as he thought he might require, he
  descended to Nizza. On the way to the cathedral, she acquainted him with what
  had befallen Leonard during the last four-and-twenty hours, and the only
  circumstance that she kept back was Judith's attempt on his life. This she
  intended to reveal at a more fitting opportunity. The doctor expressed
  somewhat emphatically his disapproval of the conduct of Mr. Bloundel, but
  promised to set all to rights without loss of time.</p>

  <p>"The only difficulty I foresee," he observed, "is that the poor youth is
  attacked by the pestilence; and though I may succeed in curing him, his
  master will probably have shut up his house before I can accomplish my
  object, in which case, all chance of his union with Amabel will be at an
  end."</p>

  <p>"So much the better," rejoined Nizza, sharply; "she does not deserve
  him."</p>

  <p>"There I agree with you," returned Hodges. "But could you point out any
  one who does?" he added, with a slight but significant laugh.</p>

  <p>No answer was returned; and as they had just reached the portico of the
  cathedral, they entered the sacred structure in silence.</p>

  <p>As they ascended the winding stairs, loud outcries resounded along the
  ambulatory, and echoed by the vaulted roof of the nave, convinced them that
  the sufferer was again in a state of frenzy, produced by fever and the
  anguish of his sore; and on reaching the cell they found him struggling
  violently with Solomon Eagle, who held him down by main force.</p>

  <p>"He is in a fearfully excited state, truly," observed Hodges, as he drew
  near, "and must not be left for a moment, or he will do himself a mischief. I
  must give him a draught to allay the fever, and compose his nerves&mdash;for
  in this state I dare not have recourse to the lancet."</p>

  <p>With this he dressed the tumour; and pouring the contents of a large phial
  which he had brought with him in a cup, he held it to the burning lips of the
  apprentice, who eagerly quaffed it. It was soon apparent that the dose
  produced a salutary effect, and a second was administered. Still the
  sufferer, though calmer, continued to ramble as before&mdash;complained that
  his veins were filled with molten lead&mdash;entreated them to plunge him in
  a stream, so that he might cool his intolerable thirst, and appeared to be in
  great agony. Doctor Hodges watched by him till daybreak, at which time he
  sank into a slumber; and Solomon Eagle, who had never till then relinquished
  his hold of him, now ventured to resign his post. The doctor was then about
  to depart; but at the urgent solicitation of Nizza, who had stationed herself
  at the door of the cell, he agreed to remain a little longer.</p>

  <p>Two hours after this, the doors of the cathedral were opened, and a large
  crowd soon assembled within the nave, as on the preceding day. The tumult of
  voices reached the cell and awakened the sleeper. Before he could be
  prevented he started from his bed, and dashing aside the feeble opposition
  offered by Nizza and the doctor, ran along the ambulatory, uttering a loud
  and fearful cry. Finding the door of the winding staircase open, he darted
  through it, and in a few seconds reappeared in the aisle. Hearing the cries,
  several persons rushed to meet him; but on beholding his haggard looks and
  strange appearance&mdash;he was merely wrapped in a blanket,&mdash;they
  instantly recoiled. Mean-time, Doctor Hodges, who had run to one of the
  arched openings looking on the nave, called out to them to secure the
  fugitive. But all fled at his approach; and when he reached the door of the
  southern transept, the verger, instead of attempting to stop him, retreated
  with a cry of alarm. As he passed through the outlet, one man bolder than the
  rest caught hold of him, and endeavoured to detain him. But, leaving the
  blanket in his hands, and without other covering than his shirt, the
  apprentice dashed across the churchyard&mdash;next shaped his course down
  Saint Bennet's-hill&mdash;then crossed Thames-street,&mdash;and finally
  speeding along another narrow thoroughfare, reached Paul's Wharf. Gazing for
  a moment at the current sweeping past him&mdash;it was high-tide,&mdash;he
  plunged head foremost into it from the high embankment, and on rising to the
  surface, being a strong and expert swimmer, struck out for the opposite
  shore. Those who beheld him were filled with amazement; but such was the
  alarm occasioned by his appearance, that none ventured to interfere with him.
  He had not crossed more than a fourth part of the stream when Doctor Hodges
  arrived at the wharf; but neither promises of reward nor threats could induce
  any of the watermen to follow him. The humane physician would have sprung
  into a boat, but feeling he should be wholly unable to manage it, he most
  reluctantly abandoned his purpose. Scarcely doubting what the result of this
  rash attempt would be, and yet unable to tear himself away, he lingered on
  the wharf till he saw Leonard reach the opposite bank, where an attempt was
  made by a party of persons to seize him. But instead of quietly surrendering
  himself, the apprentice instantly leapt into the river again, and began to
  swim back towards the point whence he had started. Amazed at what he saw, the
  doctor ordered his servant, who by this time had joined the group, to bring a
  blanket, and descending to the edge of the river, awaited the swimmer's
  arrival. In less than ten minutes he had reached the shore, and clambering on
  the bank, fell from exhaustion.</p>

  <p>"This is a violent effort of nature, which has accomplished more than
  science or skill could do," said Hodges, as he gazed on the body, and saw
  that the pestilential tumour had wholly disappeared&mdash;"he is completely
  cured of the plague."</p>

  <p>And throwing the blanket over him, he ordered him to be conveyed to his
  own house.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch2-10"
     name="ch2-10">X. &mdash; THE PEST-HOUSE IN FINSBURY FIELDS.</a></h2>

  <p>Not a word passed between the grocer and his daughter, as he took her home
  from Saint Paul's. Amabel, in fact, was so overpowered by conflicting
  emotions that she could not speak; while her father, who could not help
  reproaching himself for the harshness he had displayed towards Leonard Holt,
  felt no disposition to break silence. They found Mrs. Bloundel at the
  shop-door, drowned in tears, and almost in a state of distraction. On seeing
  them, she rushed towards her daughter, and straining her to her bosom, gave
  free vent to the impulses of her affection. Allowing the first transports of
  joy to subside, Mr. Bloundel begged, her to retire to her own room with
  Amabel, and not to leave it till they had both regained their composure, when
  he wished to have some serious conversation with them.</p>

  <p>His request complied with, the grocer then retraced his steps to the
  cathedral with the intention of seeking an explanation from Leonard, and, if
  he saw occasion to do so, of revoking his severe mandate. But long before he
  reached the southern transept, the apprentice had disappeared, nor could he
  learn what had become of him. While anxiously pursuing his search among the
  crowd, and addressing inquiries to all whom he thought likely to afford him
  information, he perceived a man pushing his way towards him. As this person
  drew near, he recognised Pillichody, and would have got out of his way had it
  been possible.</p>

  <p>"You are looking for your apprentice, I understand, Mr. Bloundel," said
  the bully, raising his hat&mdash;"if you desire, it, I will lead you to
  him."</p>

  <p>Unwilling as he was to be obliged to one whom he knew to be leagued with
  the Earl of Rochester, the grocer's anxiety overcame his scruples, and,
  signifying his acquiescence, Pillichody shouldered his way through the crowd,
  and did not stop till they reached the northern aisle, where they were
  comparatively alone.</p>

  <p>"Your apprentice is a fortunate spark, Mr. Bloundel," he said. "No sooner
  does he lose one mistress than he finds another. Tour daughter is already
  forgotten, and he is at this moment enjoying a tender <i>tte--tte</i> in
  Bishop Kempe's chapel with Nizza Macascree, the blind piper's daughter."</p>

  <p>"It is false, sir," replied the grocer, incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Unbelieving dog!" cried Pillichody, in a furious tone, and clapping his
  hand upon his sword, "it is fortunate for you that the disparity of our
  stations prevents me from compelling you to yield me satisfaction for the
  insult you have offered me. But I caution you to keep better guard upon your
  tongue for the future, especially when addressing one who has earned his
  laurels under King Charles the Martyr."</p>

  <p>"I have no especial reverence for the monarch you served under," replied
  Bloundel; "but he would have blushed to own such a follower."</p>

  <p>"You may thank my generosity that I do not crop your ears, base
  Roundhead," rejoined Pillichody; "but I will convince you that I speak the
  truth, and if you have any shame in your composition, it will be summoned to
  your cheeks."</p>

  <p>So saying, he proceeded to Bishop Kempe's chapel, the door of which was
  slightly ajar, and desired the grocer to look through the chink. This
  occurred at the precise time that the apprentice was seized with sudden
  faintness, and was leaning for support upon Nizza Macascree's shoulder.</p>

  <p>"You see how lovingly they are seated together," observed Pillichody, with
  a smile of triumph. "Bowers of Paphos! I would I were as near the rich widow
  of Watling-street. Will you speak with him?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Bloundel, turning away; "I have done with him for ever. I
  have been greatly deceived."</p>

  <p>"True," chuckled Pillichody, as soon as the grocer was out of hearing;
  "but not by your apprentice, Mr. Bloundel. I will go and inform Parravicin
  and Rochester that I have discovered the girl. The knight must mind what he
  is about, or Leonard Holt will prove too much for him. Either I am greatly
  out, or the apprentice is already master of Nizza's heart."</p>

  <p>To return to Amabel. As soon as she was alone with her mother, she threw
  herself on her knees before her, and, imploring her forgiveness, hastily
  related all that had occurred.</p>

  <p>"But for Leonard Holt," she said, "I should have been duped into a false
  marriage with the earl, and my peace of mind would have been for ever
  destroyed. As it is, I shall never be easy till he is restored to my father's
  favour. To have done wrong myself is reprehensible enough; but that another
  should suffer for my fault is utterly inexcusable."</p>

  <p>"I lament that your father should be deceived," rejoined Mrs. Bloundel,
  "and I lament still more that Leonard Holt should be so unjustly treated.
  Nevertheless, we must act with the utmost caution. I know my husband too well
  to doubt for a moment that he will hesitate to fulfil his threat. And now, my
  dear child," she continued, "do not the repeated proofs you have received of
  this wicked nobleman's perfidy, and of Leonard's devotion&mdash;do they not,
  I say, open your eyes to the truth, and show you which of the two really
  loves you, and merits your regard?"</p>

  <p>"I will hide nothing from you, mother," replied Amabel. "In spite of his
  perfidy, in spite of my conviction of his unworthiness, I still love the Earl
  of Rochester. Nor can I compel myself to feel any regard, stronger than that
  of friendship, for Leonard Holt."</p>

  <p>"You distress me, sadly, child," cried Mrs. Bloundel. "What will become of
  you! I wish my husband would shut up his house. That might put an end to the
  difficulty. I am not half so much afraid of the plague as I am of the Earl of
  Rochester. But compose yourself, as your father desired, that when he sends
  for us we may be ready to meet him with cheerfulness."</p>

  <p>Mr. Bloundel, however, did <i>not</i> send for them. He remained in the
  shop all day, except at meal-times, when he said little, and appeared to be
  labouring under a great weight of anxiety. As Amabel took leave of him for
  the night, he dismissed her with coldness; and though he bestowed his
  customary blessing upon her, the look that accompanied it was not such as it
  used to be.</p>

  <p>On the following day things continued in the same state. The grocer was
  cold and inscrutable, and his wife, fearing he was meditating some severe
  course against Amabel, and aware of his inflexible nature, if a resolution
  was once formed, shook off her habitual awe, and thus addressed him:</p>

  <p>"I fear you have not forgiven our daughter. Be not too hasty in your
  judgment. However culpable she may appear, she has been as much deceived as
  yourself."</p>

  <p>"It may be so," replied Bloundel. "Still she has acted with such
  indiscretion that I can never place confidence in her again, and without
  confidence affection is as nought. Can I say to him who may seek her in
  marriage, and whom I may approve as a husband,&mdash;'Take her! she has never
  deceived me, and will never deceive you?' No. She <i>has</i> deceived me, and
  will, therefore, deceive others. I do not know the precise truth of the story
  of her abduction (if such it was) by Leonard Holt, neither do I wish to know
  it, because I might be compelled to act with greater severity than I desire
  towards her. But I know enough to satisfy me she has been excessively
  imprudent, and has placed herself voluntarily in situations of the utmost
  jeopardy."</p>

  <p>"Not voluntarily," returned Mrs. Bloundel. "She has been lured into
  difficulties by others."</p>

  <p>"No more!" interrupted the grocer, sternly. "If you wish to serve her,
  keep guard upon your tongue. If you have any preparations to make, they must
  not be delayed. I shall shut up my house to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"Whether Leonard returns or not?" asked Mrs. Bloundel.</p>

  <p>"I shall wait for no one," returned her husband, peremptorily.</p>

  <p>They then separated, and Mrs. Bloundel hastened to her daughter to
  acquaint her with the result of the interview.</p>

  <p>In the afternoon of the same day, the grocer, who began to feel extremely
  uneasy about Leonard, again repaired to Saint Paul's to see whether he could
  obtain any tidings of him, and learnt, to his great dismay, from one of the
  vergers, that a young man, answering to the description of the apprentice,
  had been attacked by the pestilence, and having been taken to the vaults of
  Saint Faith's, had made his escape from his attendants, and, it was supposed,
  had perished. Horror-stricken by this intelligence, he descended to the
  subterranean church, where he met Judith Malmayns and Chowles, who confirmed
  the verger's statement.</p>

  <p>"The poor young man, I am informed," said Chowles, "threw himself into the
  Thames, and was picked up by a boat, and afterwards conveyed, in a dying
  state, to the pest-house in Finsbury Fields, where you will probably find
  him, if he is still alive."</p>

  <p>Mr. Bloundel heard no more. Quitting the cathedral, he hastened to
  Finsbury Fields, and sought out the building to which he had been directed.
  It was a solitary farm-house, of considerable size, surrounded by an
  extensive garden, and had only been recently converted to its present
  melancholy use. Near it was a barn, also fitted up with beds for the sick. On
  approaching the pest-house, Mr. Bloundel was greatly struck with the contrast
  presented by its exterior to the misery he knew to be reigning within. Its
  situation was charming,&mdash;in the midst, as has just been stated, of a
  large and, until recently, well-cultivated garden, and seen under the
  influence of a bright and genial May day, the whole place looked the picture
  of healthfulness and comfort. But a closer view speedily dispelled the
  illusion, and showed that it was the abode of disease and death. Horrid
  sounds saluted the ears; ghastly figures met the eyes; and the fragrance of
  the flowers was overpowered by the tainted and noisome atmosphere issuing
  from the open doors and windows. The grocer had scarcely entered the gate
  when he was arrested by an appalling shriek, followed by a succession of
  cries so horrifying that he felt half disposed to fly. But mustering up his
  resolution, and breathing at a phial of vinegar, he advanced towards the
  principal door, which stood wide open, and called to one of the assistants.
  The man, however, was too busy to attend to him, and while waiting his
  leisure, he saw no fewer than three corpses carried out to an outbuilding in
  the yard, where they were left till they could be taken away at night for
  interment.</p>

  <p>Sickened by the sight, and blaming himself for entering near this
  contagious spot, Mr. Bloundel was about to depart, when a young chirurgeon
  stepped out to him, and, in reply to his inquiries after Leonard, said:
  "Twelve persons were brought in here last night, and five this morning, but I
  do not remember any of their names. You can go through the rooms and search
  for your apprentice, if you think proper."</p>

  <p>Mr. Bloundel hesitated, but his humanity overcame his apprehension, and
  murmuring a prayer that he might be preserved from infection, he followed his
  conductor into the house. Prepared as he was for a dreadful spectacle, the
  reality far exceeded his anticipations. Along both sides of a large room,
  occupying nearly the whole of the ground-floor, were rows of pallets, on
  which were laid the sick, many of whom were tied down to their couches.
  Almost all seemed in a hopeless state, and the cadaverous hue of their
  countenances proclaimed that death was not far off. Though the doors and
  windows were open, and the room was filled with vapours and exhalations,
  arising from pans of coal and plates of hot iron, on which drugs were
  burning, nothing could remove the putrid, and pestilential smell that
  pervaded the chamber. The thick vapour settled on the panes of the windows,
  and on the roof, and fell to the ground in heavy drops. Marching quickly past
  each bed, the grocer noted the features of its unfortunate occupant; but
  though there were many young men, Leonard was not among the number. His
  conductor then led him to an upper room, where he found the chirurgeons
  dressing the sores of their patients, most of whom uttered loud shrieks while
  under their hands. Here an incident occurred which deeply affected the
  grocer. A poor young woman, who had been brought to the pest-house with her
  child on the previous evening, had just expired, and the infant, unable to
  obtain its customary nourishment, uttered the most piteous cries. It was
  instantly removed by a nurse and proper food given it; but Mr. Bloundel was
  informed that the plague-tokens had already appeared, and that it would not
  probably live over the night. "I have no doubt," said the young chirurgeon,
  "it will be buried with its mother." And so it happened.</p>

  <p>The grocer turned away to hide his emotion, and endeavoured through his
  blinded gaze to discover Leonard, but, as will be anticipated, without
  success. Stunned by the cries and groans that pierced his ears, and almost
  stifled by the pestilential effluvia, he rushed out of the house, and gladly
  accepted a glass of sack offered him by his conductor, which removed the
  dreadful nausea that affected him.</p>

  <p>"I now remember that the two last persons brought here were taken to the
  barn," observed the chirurgeon; "I will go with you thither, if you think
  proper."</p>

  <p>The grocer assented, and the chirurgeon crossed the yard, and opened the
  door of the barn, on the floor of which upwards of twenty beds were laid.
  Passing between them, Mr. Bloundel narrowly scrutinized every countenance;
  but, to his great relief, recognised no one. One couch alone remained to be
  examined. The poor sufferer within it had drawn the coverings over his face,
  and when they were removed he was found quite dead! He was a young man; and
  the agony he had endured in the last struggle was shown by his collapsed
  frame and distorted features. It was not, however, Leonard; and, so far
  satisfied, though greatly shocked, Mr. Bloundel hurried out.</p>

  <p>"Thank Heaven he is not here!" he exclaimed to his conductor.</p>

  <p>"You have not seen the dead bodies in the outhouse," returned the other;
  "it is possible his may be among them."</p>

  <p>"I trust not," rejoined the grocer, shuddering; "but as I have gone thus
  far, I will not leave my errand unaccomplished. Suffer me to look at
  them."</p>

  <p>The chirurgeon then led the way to a spacious outbuilding, once used for
  cattle, in the midst of which stood a large frame supporting six bodies,
  covered only with a sheet. Mr. Bloundel could not overcome his repugnance to
  enter this shed; but the chirurgeon, who appeared habituated to such scenes,
  and to regard them lightly, threw off the sheet, and raised the corpses, one
  by one, that he might the better view them. One peculiarity Mr. Bloundel
  noticed; namely, that the limbs of these unfortunate victims of the
  pestilence did not stiffen, as would have been the case if they had died of
  any other disorder; while the blotches that appeared on the livid flesh made
  them objects almost too horrible to look upon. In many cases the features
  were frightfully distorted&mdash;the tongues of the poor wretches swollen and
  protruding&mdash;the hands clenched, and the toes bent towards the soles of
  the feet. Everything denoted the dreadful pangs that must have attended
  dissolution.</p>

  <p>Greatly relieved to find that the whole of this ghastly group were
  strangers to him, Mr. Bloundel thanked the chirurgeon, and departed.
  Convinced that he had been deceived by the coffin-maker, he now began to hope
  that the whole story was false; but he determined not to rest till he had
  thoroughly investigated the matter. Before doing so, however, he thought it
  advisable to return home, and accordingly shaped his course toward
  Cripplegate, and, passing through the postern, stopped at an apothecary's
  shop, and got his apparel fumigated and sprinkled with spirits of hartshorn
  and sulphur.</p>

  <p>On reaching Wood-street, he noticed, with some uneasiness, a number of
  persons gathered together before his dwelling. His fears were speedily
  relieved by finding that the assemblage was collected by a preacher, who was
  pronouncing an exhortation to them in tones almost as loud and emphatic as
  those of Solomon Eagle. The preacher's appearance was very remarkable, and
  attracted the attention of the grocer, who joined the crowd to listen to him.
  As far as could be judged, he was a middle-aged man, with black hair floating
  over his shoulders, earnest features, and a grey eye of extraordinary
  brilliancy. His figure was slight and erect, and his gestures as impassioned
  as his looks. He spoke with great rapidity; and his eloquence, combined with
  his fervent manner and expression, completely entranced his audience. He was
  habited in a cassock and bands, and had taken off his cap, which was held by
  an attendant, who stood near the stool on which he was mounted. The latter
  differed materially from his master. His closely-cropped hair, demure looks,
  sugar-loaf hat, and suit of rusty sable, seemed to proclaim him a Puritan;
  but his twinkling eye&mdash;for he had but one, and wore a black patch over
  the orifice&mdash;his inflamed cheeks, and mulberry nose contradicted the
  idea.</p>

  <p>As soon as the preacher distinguished Mr. Bloundel, he addressed his
  discourse to him; and, alluding to his religious habits and general
  excellence of character, held him up as an example to others. The grocer
  would fain have retreated; but the preacher besought him to stay, and was
  proceeding in the same strain, when a sudden interruption took place. A
  slight disturbance occurring amid the crowd, the attendant attempted to check
  it, and in doing so received a sound buffet on the ears. In endeavouring to
  return the blow, he struck another party, who instantly retaliated, and a
  general affray commenced&mdash;some taking one side, some the other. In the
  midst of the confusion three persons forced their way towards the preacher,
  knocked him from his stool, and, assailing him with the most opprobrious
  epithets, dealt him several seemingly severe blows, and would have further
  maltreated him, if Mr. Bloundel had not interposed, and, pushing aside his
  assailants, gave him his hand, and led him into his dwelling, the door of
  which he closed. Shortly afterwards, the crowd dispersing, the preacher's
  companion entered the shop in search of his master.</p>

  <p>"I hope you have sustained no injury during this tumult, reverend and dear
  sir?" he asked, with great apparent solicitude.</p>

  <p>"I am not much hurt," replied the preacher; "but I have received a blow on
  the head, which has stunned me. The faintness will go off presently. You were
  the cause of this disturbance, Bambolio."</p>

  <p>"I, Doctor Maplebury?" replied Bambolio. "I endeavoured to stop it. But
  your reverence looks extremely ill. I am sure, sir," he added to Mr.
  Bloundel, "after the high character my master gave you in his discourse, and
  which I am persuaded you deserve, you will extend your hospitality towards
  him."</p>

  <p>"Readily," replied the grocer. "Here, Blaize, assist the reverend
  gentleman within, and bid your mistress come down stairs immediately."</p>

  <p>Doctor Maplebury was then conveyed between the porter and Bambolio into
  the inner room, where he sank into a chair in a complete state of exhaustion.
  The next moment Mrs. Bloundel made her appearance with Amabel. The latter no
  sooner beheld the preacher, than she started and trembled so violently, that
  she could scarcely support herself; but her mother, who only saw a fainting
  man, flew to his assistance, and called to Patience to bring restoratives.
  These applied, Doctor Maplebury was soon able to rouse himself sufficiently
  to gaze round the room, and fix his eyes on Amabel.</p>

  <p>"So our old friends are here again," said Patience in a low tone to
  Blaize, as they left the room together.</p>

  <p>"Old friends! What do you mean?" rejoined the porter.</p>

  <p>"Why, the Earl of Rochester and Major Pillichody," replied Patience. "I
  knew them at a glance, and so did Mistress Amabel. But if I hadn't discovered
  them, the major would soon have let me into the secret by the way in which he
  squeezed my hand."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" exclaimed Blaize, angrily. "I'll go and acquaint my master with
  the trick directly."</p>

  <p>"Do so," replied Patience, "and the house will be shut up to-morrow. Our
  only chance of averting that calamity is in the earl."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch2-11"
     name="ch2-11">XI. &mdash; HOW THE GROCER SHUT UP HIS HOUSE.</a></h2>

  <p>Placed in a warm bed, and carefully tended by the humane physician,
  Leonard Holt slept tranquilly for some hours, and when he awoke, though so
  weak as scarcely to be able to lift an arm, he was free from all ailment.
  Feeling ravenously hungry, he made known his wants; and, provisions being set
  before him, he was allowed to eat and drink in moderation. Greatly revived by
  the meal, he arose and attired himself in habiliments provided for him by
  Hodges, who, finding him fully equal to conversation, questioned him as to
  all that had occurred prior to his seizure.</p>

  <p>"You have acted nobly," observed the doctor, at the close of his recital;
  "and if Amabel had a spark of generosity in her composition, she would
  worthily requite you. But I do not expect it. How different is her conduct
  from that of the piper's pretty daughter. The latter really loves you; and I
  would advise you as a friend to turn your thoughts to her. She will make you
  happy: whereas the indulgence of your present hopeless passion&mdash;for
  hopeless it is&mdash;can only lead to wretchedness."</p>

  <p>"Would I could follow your advice!" replied Leonard; "but, alas! I cannot.
  Amabel does not love the Earl of Rochester more blindly, more constantly,
  than I love her; and I could as soon change my nature as transfer my
  affection to another."</p>

  <p>"I am truly sorry for it," rejoined Hodges, in a tone of deep sympathy.
  "And you still desire to return to your master?"</p>

  <p>"Unquestionably," replied Leonard. "If I am banished the house, I shall
  wander round it night and day like a ghost."</p>

  <p>"I will accompany you there this evening," rejoined Hodges, "and I trust I
  shall be able to arrange matters without compromising Amabel. I wish I could
  forward your suit more efficiently; but I see no chance of it, and, to deal
  plainly with you, I do not think a marriage with her would be for your
  happiness. The brilliant qualities of your noble rival at present so dazzle
  her eyes, that your own solid worth is completely overlooked. It will be well
  if her father can preserve her from ruin."</p>

  <p>"The earl shall die by my hand rather than he shall succeed in his
  infamous purpose," cried Leonard, fiercely.</p>

  <p>"No more of this!" exclaimed Hodges. "If you would have me take an
  interest in you, you will never give utterance to such a sentiment again.
  Amabel has another guardian, more powerful even than her father&mdash;the
  plague. Ere long the earl, who has a sufficient value for his own safety,
  will fly the city."</p>

  <p>"I hope the pestilence will number him among its victims," observed
  Leonard, in a sombre tone.</p>

  <p>At this juncture the old porter entered the room, and informed his master
  that the piper's daughter was below, and had called to inquire after the
  apprentice.</p>

  <p>Hodges desired she might be shown upstairs, and the next moment Nizza was
  ushered into the room. On beholding the improved appearance of Leonard, she
  could not repress an exclamation of delight, while a deep blush suffused her
  cheeks.</p>

  <p>"You are surprised to find him quite well," observed Hodges, with a smile.
  "Nay, you may approach him with safety. There is no fear of contagion
  now."</p>

  <p>"Having satisfied myself on that point, I will take my leave," rejoined
  Nizza, in some confusion.</p>

  <p>"Not till you have allowed me to return my thanks, I trust," said Leonard,
  advancing towards her, and taking her hand. "I owe my life to you."</p>

  <p>"Then pay the debt by devoting it to her," rejoined Hodges. "Excuse me for
  a few minutes. I have business to attend to, but will be back again
  directly."</p>

  <p>Left alone together, the young couple felt so much embarrassment that for
  some minutes neither could utter a word. At length Nizza, who had suffered
  her hand to remain in that of Leonard, gently withdrew it.</p>

  <p>"Circumstances have given me a claim to your confidence," she faltered,
  "and you will not misconstrue my motive, when I ask you whether you still
  retain the same affection as formerly for Amabel?"</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately for myself, I do," replied Leonard.</p>

  <p>"And unfortunately for me too," sighed Nizza. "Doctor Hodges says he can
  restore you to your master's favour. You will therefore return home, and we
  shall meet no more."</p>

  <p>"In these precarious times, those who part, though even for a few days,
  can feel no certainty of meeting again," rejoined Leonard. "But I hope we
  shall be more fortunate."</p>

  <p>"You mistake me," replied Nizza. "Henceforth I shall sedulously avoid you.
  Till I saw you, I was happy, and indifferent to all else, my affections being
  centred in my father and in my dog. Now I am restless and miserable. My
  former pursuits are abandoned, and I think only of you. Despise me if you
  will after this frank avowal. But believe that I would not have made it if I
  had not resolved to see you no more."</p>

  <p>"Despise you!" echoed Leonard. "On no! I shall ever feel the deepest
  gratitude towards you; but perhaps it is better we should meet no more."</p>

  <p>"And yet you throw yourself in the way of Amabel," cried Nizza. "You have
  not resolution to fly from the danger which you counsel me to shun."</p>

  <p>"It is too true," replied Leonard; "but she is beset by temptations from
  which I hope to preserve her."</p>

  <p>"That excuse will not avail me," returned Nizza, bitterly. "You cannot
  live without her. But I have said enough&mdash;more than enough," she added,
  correcting herself. "I must now bid you farewell&mdash;for ever. May you be
  happy with Amabel, and may she love you as I love you!"</p>

  <p>As she said this she would have rushed out of the room, if she had not
  been stopped by Doctor Hodges.</p>

  <p>"Whither so fast?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"Oh! let me go&mdash;let me go, I implore of you!" she cried, bursting
  into an agony of tears.</p>

  <p>"Not till you have composed yourself," rejoined the doctor. "What is the
  matter? But I need not ask. I wonder Leonard can be insensible to charms like
  yours, coupled with such devotion. Everything seems to be at cross purposes,
  and it requires some one more skilled in the affairs of the heart than an old
  bachelor like myself to set them right. Sit down. I have a few questions of
  importance to ask you before you depart."</p>

  <p>And partly by entreaty, partly by compulsion, he made her take a chair;
  and as soon as she was sufficiently composed to answer him, questioned her as
  to what she knew relating to Judith Malmayns and Chowles.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Quatremain, the minor canon, has died of the plague in one of the
  vaults of Saint Faith's," he observed; "and I more than suspect, from the
  appearance of the body, has not met with fair play."</p>

  <p>"Your suspicion is well founded, sir," replied Nizza. "Solomon Eagle told
  me that the unfortunate man's end was hastened by the plague-nurse. Nor is
  this her sole crime. She was hired to make away with Leonard Holt in the same
  manner, and would have accomplished her purpose but for the intervention of
  Solomon Eagle."</p>

  <p>"Neither she nor her partner in guilt, the coffin-maker, shall escape
  justice this time," replied Hodges. "I will instantly cause her to be
  arrested, and I trust she will expiate her offences at Tyburn. But to change
  the subject. I am sincerely interested about you, Nizza, and I wish I could
  make Leonard as sensible of your merits as I am myself. I still hope a change
  will take place in his feelings."</p>

  <p>"My heart tells me the contrary," replied Nizza. "There is no hope for
  either of us. Farewell, Leonard!" and she rushed out of the room.</p>

  <p>Soon after this Hodges quitted the apprentice, and going before a
  magistrate, detailed all that had come to his knowledge concerning the
  criminal practices of Judith Malmayns and Chowles. In the course of the day
  the accused parties were arrested, and, after a long examination, conveyed to
  Newgate. Solomon Eagle could not be found, neither could Sir Paul Parravicin.
  It appeared that Mr. Quatremain's residence had been entered on that very
  morning, and the box of treasure discovered in Saint Faith's abstracted. But
  though the strongest suspicion of the robbery attached to Chowles and Judith,
  it could not be brought home to them.</p>

  <p>We shall now proceed to Wood-street, and ascertain what took place there.
  Refreshments were placed before the supposed Doctor Maplebury by the grocer,
  while his attendant was sent to the kitchen, and directions given to Blaize
  to take every care of him; old Josyna was occupied about her own concerns;
  and Pillichody, perceiving from the porter's manner that his disguise was
  detected, laid aside concealment altogether, and endeavoured to win the other
  over to his patron's interests.</p>

  <p>"If this marriage takes place," he said, "I am authorized by my noble
  friend to state that he will appoint you his steward with a large salary, and
  that will be a very different situation from the one you hold at present. A
  nobleman's steward! Think of that. You will have a retinue of servants under
  your control, and will live quite as well as his lordship."</p>

  <p>"I have some scruples," hesitated Blaize.</p>

  <p>"Scruples! pshaw!" cried Pillichody. "You can have no hesitation in
  benefiting yourself. If you remain here, the house will be shut up, and you
  will be kept a close prisoner for months in the very heart of an infected
  city, and I dare say will be buried in yonder cellar; whereas, if you go with
  the Earl of Rochester, you will dwell in a magnificent country
  mansion&mdash;a palace, I ought to call it&mdash;enjoy every luxury, and
  remain there till the plague is over."</p>

  <p>"That last reason decides me," replied Blaize. "But I suppose his lordship
  will provide himself with a medicine chest?"</p>

  <p>"He has already got one as large as this table," said Pillichody, "and you
  shall have the key of it."</p>

  <p>"Enough!" exclaimed Blaise. "I am yours."</p>

  <p>"Pray, what am I to be?" asked Patience, who had listened to the foregoing
  conversation with a smile at Blaize's credulity.</p>

  <p>"You, sweetheart!" exclaimed Pillichody. "I will take care of you. You
  shall be my housekeeper."</p>

  <p>"Hold!" cried Blaize. "I cannot admit that. Patience and I are
  engaged."</p>

  <p>"Since you are promoted to such an important situation, you can make a
  better match," observed Patience. "I release you from the engagement."</p>

  <p>"I don't choose to be released," returned Blaize; "I will marry you on the
  same day that the earl weds Amabel."</p>

  <p>"That will be to-night, or to-morrow at the latest," said Pillichody.
  "Consent, sweetheart," he added, in a whisper to Patience; "if we can once
  get you and your pretty mistress out of the house, we will leave this
  simpleton fool in the lurch."</p>

  <p>"No, I will never consent to such a thing," returned Patience, in the same
  tone.</p>

  <p>"What's that you are saying?" inquired Blaize, suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"Major Pillichody says he will marry me, if you won't," returned
  Patience.</p>

  <p>"I have just told you I will," rejoined Blaize. "But he must not continue
  his attentions. I feel I shall be very jealous."</p>

  <p>"I am glad to hear it," returned Patience, bursting into a loud laugh,
  "for that proves you love me."</p>

  <p>"Well," observed Pillichody, "I won't interfere with a friend; and as
  there is no knowing what may occur, it will be as well to prepare
  accordingly."</p>

  <p>So saying, he fell to work upon the provisions loading the board, and ate
  and drank as if determined to lay in a stock for the next two days.</p>

  <p>Meantime the earl made rapid progress in the good opinion both of Mr.
  Bloundel and his wife. Adapting his discourse precisely to their views, and
  exerting his matchless conversational powers to their full extent, he so
  charmed them that they thought they could listen to him for ever. While thus
  engaged, he contrived ever and anon to steal a glance at Amabel, and on these
  occasions, his eyes were quite as eloquent and intelligible as his
  tongue.</p>

  <p>Among other topics interesting to the grocer, the persecution to which his
  daughter had been recently subjected was brought forward. Mr. Bloundel could
  not reprobate the earl's conduct more strongly than his guest did; and he
  assailed himself with such virulence that, in spite of her uneasiness, Amabel
  could not repress a smile. In short, he so accommodated himself to the
  grocer's opinion, and so won upon his regard, that the latter offered him an
  asylum in his house during the continuance of the pestilence. This was
  eagerly accepted, and the earl, hazarding a look at Amabel at the moment,
  perceived her change colour and become greatly agitated. Mrs. Bloundel also
  noticed her confusion, but attributing it to any other than the right cause,
  begged her, in a low tone, to control herself.</p>

  <p>At length, the opportunity for which the earl had been secretly sighing
  occurred. Mr. Bloundel called his wife out of the room for a moment, and as
  their eldest son, Stephen, was in the shop, and the two other children
  upstairs, Amabel was left alone with her lover. The door was no sooner closed
  than he sprang towards her and threw himself at her feet.</p>

  <p>"Shall I avail myself of your father's offer, sweetheart?" he cried.
  "Shall I remain here with you&mdash;the happiest of prisoners&mdash;or will
  you once more accompany me? This time, our marriage shall not be
  interrupted."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not, my lord," she replied, gravely; "but it will be a mock
  ceremonial, like the last. Do not attempt to deceive me. I am fully aware of
  your intentions, and after the awful fate of the wretched instrument of your
  purposed criminality, you will not readily get another person to tempt in
  like manner the vengeance of Heaven. I have had a severe struggle with
  myself. But at length I have triumphed over my irresolution. I will not
  disguise from you that I love you still,&mdash;and must ever, I fear,
  continue to love you. But I will not be yours on the terms you propose.
  Neither will I leave this house with you, nor suffer you to remain in it, in
  any other than your proper character. On my father's return I will disclose
  all to him. If your designs are honourable, I am sure he will no longer
  oppose my union with you. If not, we part for ever."</p>

  <p>"Be prudent, sweet girl, I entreat of you," cried the earl imploringly.
  "Your indiscretion will ruin all. There are a thousand reasons why your
  father should not be consulted on the matter."</p>

  <p>"There are none that weigh with me," she interrupted, decidedly. "I have
  been bewildered&mdash;beside myself,&mdash;but, thank Heaven, I have
  recovered before it is too late."</p>

  <p>"You are beside yourself at this moment," cried Rochester, unable to
  control his anger and mortification, "and will bitterly repent your folly.
  Neither your supplications nor my rank will have any weight with your father,
  prejudiced as he is against me. Fly with me, and I swear to make you mine,
  without a moment's loss of time. Will not my plighted word content you?"</p>

  <p>"No, my lord, you have broken it already," returned Amabel. "My father
  shall know the truth."</p>

  <p>A dark shade passed over Rochester's countenance, and a singular and most
  forbidding expression, which Amabel had once before noticed, took possession
  of it. His love for her seemed changed to hate, and she tremblingly averted
  her gaze. At this juncture, the door opened, and the grocer and his wife
  entered the room. The former started, on seeing Amabel and the supposed
  preacher in such close propinquity, and a painful suspicion of the truth
  crossed his mind. He was not, however, kept long in suspense. Throwing off
  his wig, and letting his own fair ringlets fall over his shoulders, the earl
  tore open his cassock, and disclosed his ordinary rich attire. At the same
  time, his face underwent an equally striking change,&mdash;each feature
  resuming its original expression; and the grocer, though he witnessed the
  whole transformation, could scarcely believe that the same individual he had
  recently beheld stood before him.</p>

  <p>"You now know who I am, Mr. Bloundel, and what brought me hither," said
  Rochester, with a haughty salutation.</p>

  <p>"I do, my lord," replied the grocer, "and I give you full credit for your
  daring and ingenuity. After the manner in which I have been imposed upon
  myself, I can make allowance for others." He then turned to Amabel, and said,
  in a severe tone, "You are no longer my daughter."</p>

  <p>"Father!" she cried, rushing towards him and throwing herself at his feet,
  "do not cast me off for ever. I am not now to blame. It is owing to my
  determination to disclose all to you that the earl has thus revealed himself.
  I might have deceived you further&mdash;might have fled with him."</p>

  <p>"Forgive her! oh, forgive her!" cried Mrs. Bloundel&mdash;"or, if any ill
  happens to her, you will be answerable for it."</p>

  <p>"Is this the truth, my lord?" asked the grocer.</p>

  <p>Rochester bowed stiffly in acquiescence.</p>

  <p>"Then you are again my child," said Bloundel, raising her, and pressing
  her to his bosom. "What are your intentions towards her?" he continued,
  addressing the earl.</p>

  <p>"They may be readily surmised," replied Rochester, with a scornful
  laugh.</p>

  <p>"Will you wed her, if I agree to the union," asked Bloundel, trembling
  with concentrated rage.</p>

  <p>Amabel looked at her lover as if her life hung on his answer.</p>

  <p>Rochester affected not to hear the question, but, as it was repeated still
  more peremptorily, he repeated carelessly,&mdash;"I will consider of it."</p>

  <p>"Deceived! deceived!" cried Amabel, falling on her mother's neck, and
  bursting into tears.</p>

  <p>"This outrage shall not pass unpunished," cried Bloundel. And before the
  earl could draw his sword or offer any resistance, he threw himself upon him,
  and hurling him to the ground, set his foot upon his bosom.</p>

  <p>"Do not kill him," shrieked Amabel, terrified by the stern expression of
  her father's countenance.</p>

  <p>"What are you about to do?" gasped Rochester, struggling ineffectually to
  get free.</p>

  <p>"Bid Stephen bring a cord," cried the grocer.</p>

  <p>"You are not going to hang him?" inquired Mrs. Bloundel.</p>

  <p>"Do as I bid you," rejoined her husband, "and lose no time."</p>

  <p>As she was about to leave the room, the door opened, and Doctor Hodges
  entered, followed by Leonard and Stephen.</p>

  <p>"Mercy on us! what's the matter?" cried the former, in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"You are just arrived in time to prevent mischief," replied Mrs. Bloundel.
  "Pray interfere between them. My husband will attend to you."</p>

  <p>"Arise, my lord," said Mr. Bloundel, removing his foot from the prostrate
  nobleman; "you are sufficiently punished by being found in this disgraceful
  condition. Remember that your life has been at my disposal."</p>

  <p>Thus liberated, Rochester sprang to his feet, and regarding the group with
  a menacing and disdainful look, walked up to Amabel, and saying to her, "You
  shall yet be mine," strode out of the room. He then marched along the
  passage, and called to Pillichody, who instantly answered the summons.
  Accompanied by Hodges, the grocer followed them to the shop, where the bully
  not departing so quickly as he desired, and refusing to be more expeditious,
  he kicked him into the street. This done, and the door fastened, he tarried
  only till he had received all needful explanations from the friendly
  physician, and then returning to the inner room, warmly greeted Leonard, and
  congratulated him on his extraordinary recovery from the plague.</p>

  <p>Happiness was thus once more restored to every member of the grocer's
  family, except Amabel, who still continued downcast and dejected, and
  entreated permission to retire to her own room. A cheerful evening was then
  passed by the others, and the doctor did not offer to take his departure till
  the clock struck eleven.</p>

  <p>"It is the last night I shall spend here for some months," he said;
  "perhaps the last I shall ever spend here, and I have stayed longer than I
  intended, but I did not like to abridge my enjoyment." After shaking hands
  cordially with the whole party, he added in an under tone, as he took leave
  of Leonard, "Do not forget Nizza Macascree."</p>

  <p>On the following day the grocer nailed up the shutters, and locked and
  barred the doors of his house.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="bk3"
     name="bk3">BOOK THE THIRD JUNE, 1665.</a></h2>

  <h2>I. &mdash; THE IMPRISONED FAMILY</h2>

  <p>The first few days of their confinement were passed by the grocer's family
  in a very uncomfortable manner. No one, except Mr. Bloundel, appeared
  reconciled to the plan, and even he found it more difficult of accomplishment
  that he had anticipated. The darkness of the rooms, and the want of
  ventilation caused by the closed windows and barred doors, gave the house the
  air of a prison, and occasioned a sense of oppression almost intolerable.
  Blaize declared it was "worse than being in Newgate, and that he must take an
  additional rufus to set right his digestion;" while Patience affirmed "that
  it was like being buried alive, and that she would not stand it." Mr.
  Bloundel paid no attention to their complaints, but addressed himself
  seriously to the remedy. Insisting upon the utmost attention being paid to
  cleanliness, he had an abundant supply of water drawn, with which the floors
  of every room and passage were washed down daily. By such means the house was
  kept cool and wholesome; and its inmates, becoming habituated to the gloom,
  in a great degree recovered their cheerfulness.</p>

  <p>The daily routine of the establishment was as follows. The grocer arose at
  dawn, and proceeded to call up the whole of his family. They then assembled
  in a large room on the second story, where he offered up thanks that they had
  been spared during the night, and prayed for their preservation during the
  day. He next assigned a task to each, and took care to see it afterwards duly
  fulfilled; well knowing that constant employment was the best way to check
  repining and promote contentment. Heretofore the servants had always taken
  their meals in the kitchen, but now they always sat down to table with him.
  "I will make no distinction at this season," he said; "all shall fare as I
  fare, and enjoy the same comforts as myself. And I trust that my dwelling may
  be as sure a refuge amid this pestilential storm as the ark of the patriarch
  proved when Heaven's vengeance was called forth in the mighty flood."</p>

  <p>Their devotions ended, the whole party repaired to one of the lower rooms,
  where a plentiful breakfast was provided, and of which they all partook. The
  business of the day then began, and, as has just been observed, no one was
  suffered to remain idle. The younger children were allowed to play and
  exercise themselves as much as they chose in the garret, and Blaize and
  Patience were occasionally invited to join them. A certain portion of the
  evening was also devoted to harmless recreation and amusements. The result
  may be anticipated. No one suffered in health, while all improved in spirits.
  Prayers, as usual, concluded the day, and the family retired to rest at an
  early hour.</p>

  <p>This system of things may appear sufficiently monotonous, but it was
  precisely adapted to the exigencies of the case, and produced a most salutary
  effect. Regular duties and regular employments being imposed upon each, and
  their constant recurrence, so far from being irksome, soon became agreeable.
  After a while the whole family seemed to grow indifferent to the external
  world&mdash;to live only for each other, and to think only of each
  other&mdash;and to Leonard Holt, indeed, that house was all the world. Those
  walls contained everything dear to him, and he would have been quite content
  never to leave them if Amabel had been always near. He made no attempt to
  renew his suit&mdash;seldom or never exchanging a word with her, and might
  have been supposed to have become wholly indifferent to her. But it was not
  so. His heart was consumed by the same flame as before. No longer, however, a
  prey to jealousy&mdash;no longer apprehensive of the earl&mdash;he felt so
  happy, in comparison with what he had been, that he almost prayed that the
  term of their imprisonment might be prolonged. Sometimes the image of Nizza
  Macascree would intrude upon him, and he thought, with a feeling akin to
  remorse, of what she might suffer&mdash;for he was too well acquainted with
  the pangs of unrequited love not to sympathise deeply with her. As to Amabel,
  she addressed herself assiduously to the tasks enjoined by her father, and
  allowed her mind to dwell as little as possible on the past, but employed all
  her spare time in devotional exercises.</p>

  <p>It will be remembered that the grocer had reserved a communication with
  the street, by means of a shutter opening from a small room in the upper
  story. Hither he would now frequently repair, and though he did not as yet
  think it necessary to have recourse to all the precautionary measures he
  intended eventually to adopt&mdash;such as flashing a pistol when he looked
  forth&mdash;yet he never opened the shutter without holding a phial of
  vinegar, or a handkerchief wetted with the same liquid, to his face.</p>

  <p>Before closing his house he had hired a porter, who occupied the hutch at
  his door, and held himself in readiness to execute any commission, or perform
  any service that might be required. Fresh vegetables, poultry, eggs, butter,
  and milk, were brought by a higgler from the country, and raised by means of
  a basket or a can attached to the pulley. Butcher's meat was fetched him from
  Newgate-market by the porter. This man, whose name was Ralph Dallison, had
  been formerly in the employ of the grocer, who, knowing his character, could
  place entire reliance on him. Dallison reported the progress of the
  pestilence daily, and acquainted him with the increasing amount of the bills
  of mortality. Several houses, he said, were infected in Cheapside, and two in
  Wood-street, one of which was but a short distance from the grocer's
  habitation. A watchman was stationed at the door, and the red cross marked
  upon it, and on the following night the grocer heard the sound of the doleful
  bell announcing the approach of the pest-cart.</p>

  <p>The weather still continued as serene and beautiful as ever, but no
  refreshing showers fell&mdash;no soft and healthful breezes blew&mdash;and it
  was now found to be true, what had been prognosticated&mdash;viz, that with
  the heats of summer the plague would fearfully increase. The grocer was not
  incommoded in the same degree as his neighbours. By excluding the light he
  excluded the heat, and the care which he took to have his house washed down
  kept it cool. The middle of June had arrived, and such dismal accounts were
  now brought him of the havoc occasioned by the scourge, that he would no
  longer take in fresh provisions, but began to open his stores. Dallison told
  him that the alarm was worse than ever&mdash;that vast numbers were
  endeavouring to leave the city, but no one could now do so without a
  certificate, which was never granted if the slightest suspicion was attached
  to the party.</p>

  <p>"If things go on in this way," said the porter, "London will soon be
  deserted. No business is conducted, as it used to be, and everybody is viewed
  with distrust. The preachers, who ought to be the last to quit, have left
  their churches, and the Lord's day is no longer observed. Many medical men
  even have departed, declaring their services are no longer of any avail. All
  public amusements are suspended, and the taverns are only open to the profane
  and dissolute, who deride God's judgments, and declare they have no fear.
  Robberies, murders, and other crimes, have greatly increased, and the most
  dreadful deeds are now committed with impunity. You have done wisely, sir, in
  protecting yourself against them."</p>

  <p>"I have reason to be thankful that I have done so," replied Bloundel. And
  he closed his shutter to meditate on what he had just heard.</p>

  <p>And there was abundant food for reflection. Around him lay a great and
  populous city, hemmed in, as by a fire, by an exterminating plague, that
  spared neither age, condition, nor sex. No man could tell what the end of all
  this would be&mdash;neither at what point the wrath of the offended Deity
  would stop&mdash;nor whether He would relent, till He had utterly destroyed a
  people who so contemned his word. Scarcely daring to hope for leniency, and
  filled with a dreadful foreboding of what would ensue, the grocer addressed a
  long and fervent supplication to Heaven, imploring a mitigation of its
  wrath.</p>

  <p>On joining his family, his grave manner and silence showed how powerfully
  he had been affected. No one questioned him as to what had occurred, but all
  understood he had received some distressing intelligence.</p>

  <p>Amid his anxiety one circumstance gave him unalloyed satisfaction. This
  was the change wrought in Amabel's character. It has been stated that she had
  become extremely devout, and passed the whole of the time not appointed for
  other occupations, in the study of the Scriptures, or in prayer. Her manner
  was extremely sedate, and her conversation assumed a tone that gave her
  parents, and especially her father, inexpressible pleasure. Mrs. Bloundel
  would have been equally delighted with the change, if it had tended to
  forward her own favourite scheme of a union with Leonard; but as this was not
  the case, though she rejoiced in the improvement, she still was not entirely
  satisfied. She could not help noting also, that her daughter had become pale
  and thin, and though she uttered no complaint, Mrs. Bloundel began to fear
  her health was declining. Leonard Holt looked on in wonder and admiration,
  and if possible his love increased, though his hopes diminished; for though
  Amabel was kinder to him than before, her kindness seemed the result rather
  of a sense of duty than regard.</p>

  <p>Upon one occasion they were left alone together, and instead of quitting
  the room, as she had been accustomed, Amabel called to Leonard, who was about
  to depart, and requested him to stay. The apprentice instantly obeyed; the
  colour forsook his cheek, and his heart beat violently.</p>

  <p>"You desire to speak with me, Amabel," he said:&mdash;"Ha! you have
  relented?&mdash;Is there any hope for me?"</p>

  <p>"Alas! no," she replied; "and it is on that very point I have now detained
  you. You will, I am sure, rejoice to learn that I have at length fully
  regained my peace of mind, and have become sensible of the weakness of which
  I have been guilty&mdash;of the folly, worse than folly, I have committed. My
  feelings are now under proper restraint, and viewing myself with other eyes,
  I see how culpable I have been. Oh! Leonard, if you knew the effort it has
  been to conquer the fatal passion that consumed me, if I were to tell you of
  the pangs it has cost me, of the tears I have shed, of the heart-quakes
  endured, you would pity me."</p>

  <p>"I do, indeed, pity you," replied Leonard, "for my own sufferings have
  been equally severe. But I have not been as successful as you in subduing
  them."</p>

  <p>"Because you have not pursued the right means, Leonard," she rejoined.
  "Fix your thoughts on high; build your hopes of happiness on Heaven;
  strengthen your faith; and you will soon find the victory easy. A short time
  ago I thought only of worldly pleasures, and was ensnared by vanity and
  admiration, enchained to one whom I knew to be worthless, and who pursued me
  only to destroy me. Religion has preserved me from the snare, and religion
  will restore you to happiness. But you must devote yourself to Heaven, not
  lightly, but with your whole soul. You must forget me&mdash;forget
  yourself&mdash;forget all but the grand object. And this is a season of all
  others, when it is most needful to lead a life of piety, to look upon
  yourself as dead to this world, and to be ever prepared for that to come. I
  shudder to think what might have been my portion had I perished in my
  sin."</p>

  <p>"Yours is a most happy frame of mind," returned Leonard, "and I would I
  had a chance of attaining the same tranquillity. But if you have conquered
  your love for the earl,&mdash;if your heart is disengaged, why deny me a
  hope?"</p>

  <p>"My heart is <i>not</i> disengaged, Leonard," she replied; "it is
  engrossed by Heaven. While the plague is raging around us thus&mdash;while
  thousands are daily carried off by that devouring scourge&mdash;and while
  every hour, every moment, may be our last, our thoughts ought always to be
  fixed above. I have ceased to love the earl, but I can never love another,
  and therefore it would be unjust to you, to whom I owe so much, to hold out
  hopes that never can be realized."</p>

  <p>"Alas! alas!" cried Leonard, unable to control his emotion.</p>

  <p>"Compose yourself, dear Leonard," she cried, greatly moved. "I would I
  could comply with your wishes. But, alas! I cannot. I could only give you,"
  she added, in a tone so thrilling, that it froze the blood in his
  veins&mdash;"a breaking, perhaps a broken heart!"</p>

  <p>"Gracious heaven!" exclaimed Leonard, becoming as pale as death; "is it
  come to this?"</p>

  <p>"Again, I beg you to compose yourself," she rejoined, calmly&mdash;"and I
  entreat you not to let what I have told you pass your lips. I would not alarm
  my father, or my dear and anxious mother, on my account. And there may be no
  reason for alarm. Promise me, therefore, you will be silent."</p>

  <p>Leonard reluctantly gave the required pledge.</p>

  <p>"I have unwittingly been the cause of much affliction to you," pursued
  Amabel&mdash;"and would gladly see you happy, and there is one person, I
  think, who would make you so&mdash;I mean Nizza Macascree. From what she said
  to me when we were alone together in the vaults of Saint Faith's, I am sure
  she is sincerely attached to you. Could you not requite her love?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Leonard. "There is no change in affection like mine."</p>

  <p>"Pursue the course I have advised," replied Amabel, "and you will find all
  your troubles vanish. Farewell! I depend upon your silence!"</p>

  <p>And she quitted the room, leaving Leonard in a state of indescribable
  anxiety.</p>

  <p>Faithful, however, to his promise, he made no mention of his uneasiness to
  the grocer or his wife, but indulged his grief in secret. Ignorant of what
  was passing, Mr. Bloundel, who was still not without apprehension of some
  further attempt on the part of the earl, sent Dallison to make inquiries
  after him, and learnt that he was at Whitehall, but that the court had fixed
  to remove to Hampton Court at the end of June. The porter also informed him
  that the city was emptying fast&mdash;that the Lord Mayor's residence was
  literally besieged with applications for bills of health&mdash;that officers
  were stationed at the gates&mdash;and that, besides these, barriers and
  turnpikes were erected on all the main roads, at which the certificates were
  required to be exhibited&mdash;and that such persons as escaped without them
  were driven back by the inhabitants of the neighbouring villages, who refused
  to supply them with necessaries; and as they could not return home, many had
  perished of want, or perhaps of the pestilence, in the open fields. Horses
  and coaches, he added, were not to be procured, except at exorbitant prices;
  and thousands had departed on foot, locking up their houses, and leaving
  their effects behind them.</p>

  <p>"In consequence of this," added Dallison, "several houses have been broken
  open; and though the watch had been trebled, still they cannot be in all
  places at once; and strong as the force is, it is not adequate to the present
  emergency. Bands of robbers stalk the streets at night, taking vehicles with
  them, built to resemble pest-carts, and beating off the watch, they break
  open the houses, and carry off any goods they please."</p>

  <p>This intelligence greatly alarmed the grocer, and he began to fear his
  plans would be defeated in an unexpected manner. He engaged Dallison to
  procure another trusty companion to take his place at night, and furnished
  him with money to purchase arms. He no longer slept as tranquilly as before,
  but frequently repaired to his place of observation to see that the watchman
  was at his post, and that all was secure. For the last few days, he had
  remarked with some uneasiness that a youth frequently passed the house and
  gazed at the barred windows, and he at first imagined he might be leagued
  with the nocturnal marauders he had heard of; but the prepossessing
  appearance of the stripling, who could not be more than sixteen, and who was
  singularly slightly made, soon dispelled the idea. Still, as he constantly
  appeared at the same spot, the grocer began to have a new apprehension, and
  to suspect he was an emissary of the Earl of Rochester, and he sent Dallison
  to inquire his business. The youth returned an evasive answer, and withdrew;
  but the next day he was there again. On this occasion, Mr. Bloundel pointed
  him out to Leonard Holt, and asked him if he had seen him before. The youth's
  back being towards them, the apprentice unhesitatingly answered in the
  negative, but as the subject of investigation turned the next moment, and
  looked up, revealing features of feminine delicacy and beauty, set off by
  long flowing jet-black ringlets, Leonard started, and coloured.</p>

  <p>"I was mistaken," he said, "I <i>have</i> seen him before."</p>

  <p>"Is he one of the Earl of Rochester's pages?" asked Mr. Bloundel.</p>

  <p>"No," replied Leonard, "and you need not be uneasy about him. I am sure he
  intends no harm."</p>

  <p>Thus satisfied, the grocer thought no more about the matter. He then
  arranged with Leonard that he should visit the window at certain hours on
  alternate nights with himself, and appointed the following night as that on
  which the apprentice's duties should commence.</p>

  <p>On the same night, however, an alarming incident occurred, which kept the
  grocer and his apprentice for a long time on the watch. The family had just
  retired to rest when the report of fire-arms was heard close to the street
  door, and Mr. Bloundel hastily calling up Leonard, they repaired to the room
  overlooking the street, and found that a desperate struggle was going on
  below. The moon being overclouded, and the lantern extinguished, it was too
  dark to discern the figures of the combatants, and in a few seconds all
  became silent, except the groans of a wounded man. Mr. Bloundel then called
  out to know what was the matter, and ascertained from the sufferer, who
  proved to be his own watchman, that the adjoining house, being infected, had
  been shut up by the authorities; and its owner, unable to bear the restraint,
  had burst open the door, shot the watchman stationed at it, and firing
  another pistol at the poor wretch who was making the statement, because he
  endeavoured to oppose his flight, had subsequently attacked him with his
  sword. It was a great grief to Mr. Bloundel not to be able to aid the
  unfortunate watchman, and he had almost determined to hazard a descent by the
  pulley, when a musical voice was heard below, and the grocer soon understood
  that the youth, about whom his curiosity had been excited, was raising the
  sufferer, and endeavouring to stanch his wounds. Finding this impossible,
  however, at Mr. Bloundel's request, he went in search of assistance, and
  presently afterwards returned with a posse of men, bearing halberds and
  lanterns, who carried off the wounded man, and afterwards started in pursuit
  of the murderer.</p>

  <p>Mr. Bloundel then entered into conversation with the youth, who informed
  him that his name was Flitcroft, that he was without a home, all his
  relations having died of the plague, and that he was anxious to serve as a
  watchman in place of the poor wretch who had just been removed. Leonard
  remonstrated against this arrangement, but Mr. Bloundel was so much pleased
  with Flitcroft's conduct that he would listen to no objection. Accordingly
  provisions were lowered down in a basket to the poor youth, and he stationed
  himself in the hutch. Nothing material occurred during the day. Flitcroft
  resigned his post to Dallison, but returned in the evening.</p>

  <p>At midnight, Leonard took his turn to watch. It was a bright moonlight
  night, but though he occasionally looked out into the street, and perceived
  Flitcroft below, he gave no intimation of his presence. All at once, however,
  he was alarmed by a loud cry, and opening the shutter, perceived the youth
  struggling with two persons, whom he recognised as Sir Paul Parravicin and
  Pillichody.</p>

  <p>He shouted to them to release their captive, but they laughed at his
  vociferations, and in spite of his resistance dragged the youth away.
  Maddened at the sight, Leonard lowered the rope as quickly as he could with
  the intention of descending by it. At this moment, Flitcroft turned an
  agonized look behind him, and perceiving what had been done, broke suddenly
  from his captors, and before he could be prevented, sprang into the basket,
  and laid hold of the rope. Leonard, who had seen the movement, and divined
  its object, drew up the pulley with the quickness of thought; and so
  expeditiously was the whole accomplished, that ere the knight and his
  companion reached the spot, Flitcroft was above their heads, and the next
  moment was pulled through the window, and in safety by the side of
  Leonard.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch3-2"
     name="ch3-2">II. &mdash; HOW FIRES WERE LIGHTED IN THE STREETS.</a></h2>

  <p>Nizza Macascree, for it is useless to affect further mystery, as soon as
  she could find utterance, murmured her thanks to the apprentice, whose
  satisfaction at her deliverance was greatly diminished by his fears lest his
  master should disapprove of what he had done. Seeing his uneasiness, and
  guessing the cause, Nizza hastened to relieve it.</p>

  <p>"I reproach myself bitterly for having placed you in this situation!" she
  said, "but I could not help it, and will free you from my presence the moment
  I can do so with safety. When I bade you farewell, I meant it to be for ever,
  and persuaded myself I could adhere to my resolution. But I was deceived. You
  would pity me, were I to tell you the anguish I endured. I could not
  accompany my poor father in his rambles; and if I went forth at all, my steps
  involuntarily led me to Wood-street. At last, I resolved to disguise myself,
  and borrowed this suit from a Jew clothesman, who has a stall in Saint
  Paul's. Thus equipped, I paced backwards and forwards before the house, in
  the hope of obtaining a glimpse of you, and fortune has favoured me more than
  I expected, though it has led to this unhappy result. Heaven only knows what
  will become of me!" she added, bursting into tears. "Oh! that the pestilence
  would select me as one of its victims. But, like your own sex, it shuns all
  those who court it."</p>

  <p>"I can neither advise you," replied Leonard, in sombre tone, "nor help
  you. Ah!" he exclaimed, as the sounds of violent blows were heard against the
  door below&mdash;"your persecutors are trying to break into the house."</p>

  <p>Rushing to the window, and gazing downwards, he perceived Sir Paul
  Parravicin and Pillichody battering against the shop door, and endeavouring
  to burst it open. It was, however, so stoutly barricaded, that it resisted
  all their efforts.</p>

  <p>"What is to be done?" cried Leonard. "The noise will certainly alarm my
  master, and you will be discovered."</p>

  <p>"Heed me not," rejoined Nizza, distractedly, "you shall not run any risk
  on my account. Let me down the pulley. Deliver me to them. Anything is better
  than that you should suffer by my indiscretion."</p>

  <p>"No, no," replied Leonard; "Mr. Bloundel shall know all. His love for his
  own daughter will make him feel for you. But come what will, I will not
  abandon you."</p>

  <p>As he spoke a timid knock was heard at the door, and a voice without
  exclaimed, in accents of the utmost trepidation, "Are you there,
  Leonard?&mdash;Robbers are breaking into the house. We shall all be
  murdered."</p>

  <p>"Come in, Blaize," returned Leonard, opening the door and admitting the
  porter&mdash;"you may be of some assistance to me."</p>

  <p>"In what way?" demanded Blaize. "Ah! who's this?" he added, perceiving
  Nizza&mdash;"what is this page doing here?"</p>

  <p>"Do not concern yourself about him but attend to me," replied Leonard. "I
  am about to drive away those persons from the door. You must lower me down in
  the basket attached to the pulley."</p>

  <p>"And will you dare to engage them?" asked Blaize, peeping out at the
  shutter. "They are armed. As I live, one is Major Pillichody, the rascal who
  dared to make love to Patience. I have half a mind to go down with you, and
  give him a sound drubbing."</p>

  <p>"You shall not encounter this danger for me," interposed Nizza,
  endeavouring to stay Leonard, who, having thrust a sword into his girdle, was
  about to pass through the window.</p>

  <p>"Do not hinder me," replied the apprentice, breaking from her. "Take hold
  of the rope, Blaize, and mind it does not run down too quickly."</p>

  <p>With this, he got into the basket, and as the porter carefully obeyed his
  instructions, he reached the ground in safety. On seeing him, Pillichody
  bolted across the street, and flourishing his sword, and uttering tremendous
  imprecations, held himself in readiness to beat an immediate retreat. Not so
  Parravicin. Instantly assailing the apprentice, he slightly wounded him in
  the arm. Seeing how matters stood, and that victory was pretty certain to
  declare itself for his patron, Pillichody returned, and, attacking the
  apprentice, by their combined efforts, he was speedily disarmed. Pillichody
  would have passed his sword through his body, but the knight stayed his
  hand.</p>

  <p>"The fool has placed himself in our power," he said, "and he shall pay for
  his temerity; nevertheless, I will spare his life provided he assist us to
  get into the house, or will deliver up Nizza Macascree."</p>

  <p>"I will do neither," replied Leonard, fiercely.</p>

  <p>Parravicin raised his sword, and was about to strike, when, at the moment,
  the basket was again quickly lowered to the ground. It bore Nizza Macascree,
  who, rushing between them, arrested the stroke.</p>

  <p>"Oh! why have you done this?" cried Leonard, in a tone of reproach.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you why," rejoined Parravicin, triumphantly; "because she saw
  you were unable to defend her, and, like a true woman, surrendered herself to
  the victor. Take care of him, Pillichody, while I secure the girl. Spit him,
  if he attempts to stir."</p>

  <p>And twining his arms round Nizza, notwithstanding her shrieks and
  resistance, he bore her away. Infuriated by the sight, Leonard Holt threw
  himself upon Pillichody, and a desperate struggle took place between them,
  which terminated this time successfully for the apprentice. Wresting his long
  rapier from the bully, Leonard rushed after Parravicin, and reached the end
  of Wood-street, just in time to see him spring into a coach, and drive off
  with his prize. Speeding after them along Blowbladder-street, and Middle-row,
  as Newgate-street was then termed, the apprentice shouted to the coachman to
  stop, but no attention being paid to his vociferations, and finding pursuit
  unavailing, he came to a halt. He then more slowly retraced his steps, and on
  arriving at the grocer's residence, found the basket drawn up. Almost afraid
  to call out, he at length mustered courage enough to shout to Blaize to lower
  it, and was answered by Mr. Bloundel, who, putting his head through the
  window, demanded in a stern tone why he had left the house?</p>

  <p>Leonard briefly explained.</p>

  <p>"I deeply regret your imprudence," replied his master; "because I can now
  no more admit you. It is my fixed determination, as you well know, not to
  suffer any member of my family who may quit my house, to enter it again."</p>

  <p>"I shall not attempt to remonstrate with you, sir," replied Leonard. "All
  I pray of you is to allow me to occupy this hutch, and to act as your
  porter."</p>

  <p>"Willingly," rejoined Mr. Bloundel; "and as you have had the plague, you
  will run no risk of infection. You shall know all that passes within doors;
  and I only lament that you should have banished yourself from the asylum
  which I hoped to afford you."</p>

  <p>After some further conversation between them, a bundle was lowered by the
  grocer, containing a change of clothes and a couple of blankets. On receiving
  these, Leonard retired to the hutch, and tying a handkerchief round his
  wounded arm, wrapped himself in a night trail, and stretching himself on the
  ground, in spite of his anxiety, soon sank asleep. He awoke about four
  o'clock in the morning, with a painful consciousness of what had taken place
  during the night. It was just beginning to grow light, and he walked across
  the street to gaze at the house from which he was exiled. Its melancholy,
  uninhabited look did not serve to cheer him. It seemed totally altered since
  he knew it first. The sign, which then invited the passers-by to enter the
  shop and deal with its honest owner, now appeared no longer significant,
  unless&mdash;and it will be remembered it was the Noah's Ark&mdash;it could
  be supposed to have reference to those shut up within. The apprentice looked
  at the habitation with misgiving, and, instead of regarding it as a sanctuary
  from the pestilence, could not help picturing it as a living tomb. The last
  conversation he had had with Amabel also arose forcibly to his recollection,
  and the little likelihood there appeared of seeing her again gave him acute
  agony. Oppressed by this painful idea, and unable to exclude from his
  thoughts the unhappy situation of Nizza Macascree, he bent his steps,
  scarcely knowing whither he was going, towards Saint Paul's.</p>

  <p>Having passed so much of his time of late in the cathedral, Leonard began
  to regard it as a sort of home, and it now appeared like a place of refuge to
  him. Proceeding to the great western entrance, he seated himself on one of
  the large blocks of stone left there by the masons occupied in repairing the
  exterior of the fane. His eye rested upon the mighty edifice before him, and
  the clear sparkling light revealed numberless points of architectural
  grandeur and beauty which he had never before noticed. The enormous
  buttresses and lofty pinnacles of the central tower were tinged with the
  beams of the rising sun, and glowed as if built of porphyry. While gazing at
  the summit of this tower, and calling to mind the magnificent view he had
  recently witnessed from it at the same hour, if a wish could have transported
  him thither at that moment, he would have enjoyed it again. But as this could
  not be, he tried to summon before his mental vision the whole glorious
  prospect&mdash;the broad and shining river, with its moving or motionless
  craft&mdash;the gardens, the noble mansions, the warehouses, and mighty
  wharfs on its banks&mdash;London Bridge, with its enormous pile of
  habitations&mdash;the old and picturesque city, with its innumerable towers,
  and spires, and girdle of grey walls&mdash;the green fields and winding lanes
  leading to the lovely hills around it&mdash;all these objects arose obedient
  to his fancy, and came arrayed in colouring as fresh as that wherein they had
  before appeared to him. While thus occupied, his gaze remained riveted on the
  summit of the central tower, and he fancied he perceived some one leaning
  over the balustrade; but as little beyond the upper part of the figure could
  be discerned, and as it appeared perfectly motionless, he could not be quite
  sure that his eyes did not deceive him. Having gazed at the object for some
  minutes, during which it maintained the same attitude, he continued his
  survey of the pile, and became so excited by the sublime emotions inspired by
  the contemplation, as to be insensible to aught else.</p>

  <p>After a while he arose, and was about to proceed towards the portico,
  when, chancing to look at the top of the tower, he remarked that the figure
  had disappeared, and while wondering who it could be, he perceived a person
  emerge from one of the tall windows in the lower part of the tower. It was
  Solomon Eagle, and he no longer wondered at what he had seen. The enthusiast
  was without his brazier, but carried a long stout staff. He ran along the
  pointed roof of the nave with inconceivable swiftness, till, reaching the
  vast stone cross, upwards of twelve feet in height, ornamenting the western
  extremity, he climbed its base, and clasping the transverse bar of the sacred
  symbol of his faith with his left arm, extended his staff with his right, and
  described a circle, as if pointing out the walls of the city. He then raised
  his staff towards heaven to invoke its vengeance, and anon pointed it
  menacingly downwards. After this he broke into loud denunciations; but though
  the apprentice could not hear the words, he gathered their purport from his
  gestures.</p>

  <p>By this time a few masons had assembled, and producing their implements,
  commenced working at the blocks of stone. Glancing at the enthusiast, one of
  them observed with a smile to his companion, "There is Solomon Eagle
  pronouncing his morning curse upon the city. I wonder whether the judgments
  he utters against it will come to pass."</p>

  <p>"Assuredly, Phil Gatford," replied the other mason, gravely; "and I look
  upon all the work we are now doing as labour thrown away. Was he not right
  about the plague? Did he not foretell the devouring scourge by which we are
  visited? And he will be right also about the fire. Since he has doomed it,
  this cathedral will be consumed by flames, and one stone will not be left
  standing on another."</p>

  <p>"It is strange, Ned Turgis," observed Gatford, "that, though Solomon Eagle
  may always be seen at daybreak at the top of the tower or on the roof of the
  cathedral&mdash;sometimes at one point and sometimes at another&mdash;no one
  can tell where he hides himself at other times. He no longer roams the
  streets at night, but you may remember when the officers of justice were in
  search of him, to give evidence against Mother Malmayns and Chowles, he was
  not to be found."</p>

  <p>"I remember it," replied Turgis; "but I have no doubt he was hidden in
  some out-of-the-way corner of the cathedral&mdash;perhaps among the immense
  wooden beams of the clerestory."</p>

  <p>"Or in some of the secret passages or cells contrived in the thickness of
  the walls," rejoined the first speaker. "I say, Ned Turgis, if the plague
  increases, as there is every likelihood it will, Solomon Eagle will be the
  only preacher left in Saint Paul's. Neither deans, prebends, minor-canons,
  nor vicars will attend. As it is, they have almost abandoned it."</p>

  <p>"Shame on them!" exclaimed Leonard Holt, who, being much interested in the
  conversation of the masons, had silently approached them. "At this season,
  more than ever, they are bound to attend to their duty."</p>

  <p>"Why, so I think," rejoined Gatford; "but I suppose they consider
  self-preservation their first duty. They aver that all assemblages, whether
  called together for religious purposes or not, are dangerous, and likely to
  extend the pestilence."</p>

  <p>"And yet crowds are permitted to assemble for purposes of amusement, if
  not for worship, in those holy walls," returned Leonard.</p>

  <p>"Not so," replied Gatford. "Very few persons now come there, and none for
  amusement. Paul's Walk is completely deserted. The shops and stalls have been
  removed, and the pillars to which they were attached are restored to their
  former appearance."</p>

  <p>"I am glad to hear it," rejoined Leonard. "I would far rather the sacred
  edifice were altogether abandoned than be what it has been of late&mdash;a
  den of thieves."</p>

  <p>"It was a stable and a magazine of arms in the time of the Commonwealth,"
  remarked Gatford.</p>

  <p>"And if Solomon Eagle's foreboding come to pass, it will be a heap of
  ruins in our own time," rejoined Turgis. "But I see the prophet of ill has
  quitted his post, and retired to his hiding-place."</p>

  <p>Looking up as this was said, Leonard saw that the enthusiast had
  disappeared. At this moment the great door of the cathedral was thrown open,
  and, quitting the masons, he ascended the broad steps under the portico, and
  entered the fane, where he found that the information he had received was
  correct, and that the stalls and other disfigurements to the pillars had been
  removed. After pacing the solitary aisles for some time, he made inquiries
  from the verger concerning Solomon Eagle.</p>

  <p>"I know nothing about him," replied the man, reluctantly. "I believe he
  always appears at daybreak on some part of the roof, but I am as ignorant as
  yourself where he hides himself. The door of the winding staircase leading to
  the central tower is open. You can ascend it, and search for him, if you
  think proper."</p>

  <p>Acting upon the suggestion, Leonard mounted to the belfry, and from thence
  to the summit of the tower. Having indulged himself with a brief survey of
  the glorious view around, he descended, and glanced into every cell and
  chamber as he passed, in the hopes of meeting with the enthusiast, but he was
  disappointed. At length, as he got about half-way down, he felt his arm
  forcibly grasped, and, instantly conjecturing who it was, offered no
  resistance. Without uttering a word, the person who had seized him dragged
  him up a few steps, pushed aside a secret door, which closed behind them with
  a hollow clangour, and leading him along a dark narrow passage, opened
  another door, and they emerged upon the roof. He then found that his
  suspicion was correct, and that his mysterious guide was no other than
  Solomon Eagle.</p>

  <p>"I am glad to find you have recovered from the pestilence," said the
  enthusiast, regarding him with a friendly glance; "it proves you are favoured
  by Heaven. I saw you in the open space before the cathedral this morning, and
  instantly recognised you. I was in the belfry when you descended, but you did
  not perceive me, and I wished to be certain you were alone before I
  discovered myself."</p>

  <p>"You have ceased to roam the streets at night, and rouse the slumbering
  citizens to repentance?" asked Leonard.</p>

  <p>"For the present I have," returned Solomon Eagle. "But I shall appear
  again when I am required. But you shall now learn why I have brought you
  hither. Look along those streets," he added, pointing to the thoroughfares
  opening in different directions. "What see you?"</p>

  <p>"I see men piling heaps of wood and coals at certain distances, as if they
  were preparing bonfires," replied Leonard. "And yet it cannot be. This is no
  season for rejoicing."</p>

  <p>"It has been supposed that the lighting of many thousand fires at once
  will purify the air," replied Solomon Eagle; "and therefore the Lord Mayor
  has given orders that heaps of fuel shall be placed before every house in
  every street in the city, and that all these heaps shall be kindled at a
  certain hour. But it will be of no avail. The weather is now fine and
  settled, and the sky cloudless. But the offended Deity will cause the
  heaviest rain to descend, and extinguish their fires. No&mdash;the way to
  avert the pestilence is not by fire, but by prayer and penitence, by
  humiliation and fasting. Let this sinful people put on sackcloth and ashes.
  Let them beseech God, by constant prayer, to forgive them, and they may
  prevail, but not otherwise."</p>

  <p>"And when are these fires to be lighted?" asked the apprentice.</p>

  <p>"To-night, at midnight," replied Solomon Eagle.</p>

  <p>He then took Leonard by the hand, and led him back the same way he had
  brought him. On reaching the spiral staircase, he said, "If you desire to
  behold a sight, such as a man has seldom witnessed, ascend to the summit of
  this tower an hour after midnight, when all these fires are lighted. A small
  door on the left of the northern entrance shall be left open. It will conduct
  you to the back of the choir, and you must then find your way hither as well
  as you can."</p>

  <p>Murmuring his thanks, Leonard hurried down the spiral staircase, and
  quitting the cathedral, proceeded in the direction of Wood-street.
  Preparations were everywhere making for carrying the Lord Mayor's orders into
  effect; and such was the beneficial result anticipated, that a general
  liveliness prevailed, on reaching his master's residence, he found him at the
  shutter, curious to know what was going forward; and having informed him, the
  grocer immediately threw him down money to procure wood and coal.</p>

  <p>"I have but little faith in the experiment," he said, "but the Lord
  Mayor's injunctions must be obeyed."</p>

  <p>With the help of Dallison, who had now arrived, Leonard Holt soon procured
  a large heap of fuel, and placed it in the middle of the street. The day was
  passed in executing other commissions for the grocer, and he took his meals
  in the hutch with the porter. Time appeared to pass with unusual slowness,
  and not he alone, but anxious thousands, awaited the signal to kindle their
  fires. The night was profoundly dark and sultry, and Leonard could not help
  thinking that the enthusiast's prediction would be verified, and that rain
  would fall. But these gloomy anticipations vanished as the hour of midnight
  was tolled forth by the neighbouring clocks of Saint Michael's and Saint
  Alban's. Scarcely had the strokes died away, when Leonard seized a light and
  set fire to the pile. Ten thousand other piles were kindled at the same
  moment, and in an instant the pitchy darkness was converted into light as
  bright as that of noonday.</p>

  <p>Anxious to behold this prodigious illumination at its best, Leonard Holt
  committed the replenishing of the pile and the custody of the house to
  Dallison, and hastened to Saint Paul's. A great fire was burning at each
  angle of the cathedral, but without pausing to notice the effect of the
  flames upon the walls of the building, he passed through the door to which he
  had been directed, and hastening to the spiral staircase beyond the choir,
  ascended it with swift steps. He did not pause till he reached the summit of
  the tower, and there, indeed, a wondrous spectacle awaited him. The whole
  city seemed on fire, and girded with a flaming belt&mdash;for piles were
  lighted at certain distances along the whole line of walls. The groups of
  dark figures collected round the fires added to their picturesque effect; and
  the course of every street could be traced by the reflection of the flames on
  the walls and gables of the houses. London Bridge was discernible from the
  fires burning upon it&mdash;and even upon the river braziers were lighted on
  all the larger craft, which cast a ruddy glow upon the stream.</p>

  <p>After gazing at this extraordinary sight for some time, Leonard began to
  descend. As yet he had seen nothing of Solomon Eagle, and searching for him
  in vain in the belfry, he quitted the cathedral. From a knot of persons
  gathered round one of the fires he learnt that the enthusiast was addressing
  the crowd at the west side of the building, and proceeding thither he
  perceived him standing on the edge of the balustrade of the south-western
  tower, surmounting the little church of Saint Gregory. His brazier was placed
  on one of the buttresses, and threw its light on the mighty central tower of
  the fabric, and on a large clock-face immediately beneath. Solomon Eagle was
  evidently denouncing the city, but his words were lost in the distance. As he
  proceeded, a loud clap of thunder pealed overhead.</p>

  <p>"It comes&mdash;it comes!" cried the enthusiast, in a voice that could be
  distinctly heard in the death-like stillness that followed the thunder. "The
  wrath of Heaven is at hand."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, a bright flash cut the air, and a bolt struck down, one of
  the pinnacles of the great tower. Flash after flash followed in quick
  succession, and the enthusiast, who seemed wrapped in flame, extended his
  arms towards Heaven, as if beseeching a further display of its vengeance.
  Suddenly the lightning ceased to flash and the thunder to roll. A few heavy
  drops of rain fell. These were succeeded by a deluging shower of such
  violence, that in less than a quarter of an hour every fire within the city
  was extinguished, and all was darkness and despair.</p>

  <p>The deepest gloom and despondency prevailed that night throughout London.
  The sudden storm was regarded as a manifestation of the displeasure of
  Heaven, and as an intimation that the arrows of its wrath were not to be
  turned aside by any human efforts. So impressed were all with this feeling,
  that when, in less than half an hour, the rain entirely ceased, the clouds
  cleared off, and the stars again poured down their lustre, no one attempted
  to relight the quenched embers, fearing to provoke the Divine vengeance. Nor
  was a monitor wanting to enforce the awful lesson. Solomon Eagle, with his
  brazier on his head, ran through the streets, calling on the inhabitants to
  take to heart what had happened, to repent, and prepare for their doom.</p>

  <p>"The Lord will not spare you," he cried, as he stationed himself in the
  open space before St. Stephen's, Walbrook. "He will visit your sins upon you.
  Pray, therefore, that ye may not be destroyed, both body and soul. Little
  time is allowed you for repentance. Many that hear me shall not live till
  tomorrow; few shall survive the year!"</p>

  <p>"Thou, thyself, shalt not survive the night, false prophet," cried a voice
  from a neighbouring window. And immediately afterwards the barrel of a gun
  was thrust forth and a shot fired at the enthusiast. But though Solomon Eagle
  never altered his position, he was wholly uninjured&mdash;the ball striking a
  bystander, who fell to the ground mortally wounded.</p>

  <p>"You have shot your own son, Mr. Westwood," cried one of the spectators,
  rushing up to the fallen man. "Who will henceforth doubt that Solomon Eagle
  is under the care of a special providence?"</p>

  <p>"Not I," replied another spectator. "I shall never disregard his words in
  future."</p>

  <p>Setting down his brazier, the enthusiast bent over the dead man&mdash;for
  dead he was&mdash;and noted the placid smile upon his features. By this time
  the unfortunate father had joined the group, and, on seeing the body of his
  son, wrung his hands in a pitiable manner, and gave utterance to the wildest
  expression of despair. No one attempted to seize him, till at length Solomon
  Eagle, rising from his kneeling posture, laid his hand upon his arm, and
  regarding him sternly, said, "What wrong have I done you, that you should
  seek to slay me?"</p>

  <p>"What wrong?" rejoined Westwood&mdash;"such wrong as can never be
  repaired. Your fearful prophecies and denunciations so terrified my daughter,
  that she died distracted. My brokenhearted wife was not long in following
  her; and now you have made me the murderer of my son. Complete the tragedy,
  and take my life."</p>

  <p>"I have no desire to do so," replied Solomon Eagle, in a tone of
  commiseration. "My wish is to save your soul, and the souls of all who listen
  to me. I wonder not that your anger was at first stirred against me; but if
  your heart had been properly directed, indignation would have soon given way
  to better feelings. My mission is not to terrify, but to warn. Why will ye
  thus continue impenitent when ye are spoken to, not by my voice alone, but by
  a thousand others?&mdash;by the thunder&mdash;by the rain&mdash;by the
  pestilence!&mdash;and ye shall be spoken to, if ye continue senseless, by
  fire and by famine. Look at these quenched embers&mdash;at these flooded
  streets&mdash;they are types of your vain struggle with a superior power.
  Now, mark me what you must do to free the city from contagion. You must
  utterly and for ever abandon your evil courses. You must pray incessantly for
  remission of your sins. You must resign yourselves without repining to such
  chastisement as you have provoked, and must put your whole trust and
  confidence in God. Do this, and do it heartily; it is possible that His wrath
  may be averted."</p>

  <p>"I feel the force of your words," faltered Westwood&mdash;"would I had
  felt it sooner!"</p>

  <p>"Repentance never comes too late," rejoined the enthusiast. "Let this be
  an example to you all."</p>

  <p>And snatching up his brazier, he continued his course at the same
  lightning speed as before. The unfortunate father was taken into his own
  dwelling, whither likewise the body of his son was conveyed. A strict watch
  was kept over him during the night, and in the morning he was removed to
  Newgate, where he perished, in less than a week, of the distemper.</p>

  <p>The aspect of the streets on the following day was deplorable enough. Not
  that the weather was unfavourable. On the contrary, it was bright and sunny,
  while the heated atmosphere, cooled, by the showers, felt no longer
  oppressive. But the sight of the half-burnt fires struck a chill into every
  bosom, and it was not until the heaps were removed, that the more timorous
  ventured forth at all. The result, too, of the experiment was singularly
  unfortunate. Whether it was from the extraordinary heat occasioned by the
  lighting of so many fires, or that the smoke did not ascend, and so kept down
  the pestilential effluvia, or that the number of persons who met together
  spread the contagion, certain it was that the pestilence was more widely
  extended than before, and the mortality fearfully increased.</p>

  <p>On the commencement of the storm, Leonard Holt hurried back to
  Wood-street, and reached his master's dwelling just as the rain began to
  descend in torrents. Mr. Bloundel was at the window, and a few words only
  passed between him and the apprentice when the latter was compelled to take
  refuge in the hutch. Here he found Dallison the watchman, and they listened
  in awe-struck silence to the heavy showers, and to the hissing of the blazing
  embers in their struggle against the hostile element. By-and-by the latter
  sound ceased. Not a light could be seen throughout the whole length of the
  street, nor was there any red reflection of the innumerable fires as
  heretofore in the sky. It was evident all were extinguished; and the pitiless
  pelting of the rain, the roar of the water-spouts, and the rush of the
  over-filled kennels, now converted into rivulets, could alone be heard After
  awhile the storm cleared off, and Leonard and his companion issued from their
  retreat, and gazed in silence at the drenched heap before them. While thus
  occupied, the window above them opened, and the grocer appeared at it.</p>

  <p>"This is, indeed, a sad and striking lesson," he said, "and I hope will
  not be lost upon those who have witnessed it. It shows the utter impotency of
  a struggle against the Divine will, and that when a man relies upon himself
  for preservation, he depends upon a broken reed. If I did not place myself
  under Heaven's protection, I should be sure that all my own precautions were
  unavailing. I am now about to call up my family to prayer. You can join us in
  our supplications, and I trust they will not be unheard."</p>

  <p>Closing the window, the grocer retired, and Leonard returned to the hutch,
  where he fell upon his knees, and as soon as he supposed the family were
  gathered together, commenced his own prayers. He pictured the whole group
  assembled&mdash;the fervour of the grocer excited to an unwonted pitch by
  what had just occurred&mdash;the earnest countenances of his wife and the
  younger children&mdash;and the exalted looks of Amabel. He could not see
  her&mdash;neither could he hear her voice&mdash;but he fancied how she
  looked, and in what terms she prayed&mdash;and it was no slight satisfaction
  to him to think that his own voice ascended to Heaven coupled with hers.</p>

  <p>On quitting the hutch, he found Dallison conversing with Doctor Hodges.
  The physician expressed great surprise at seeing him, and inquired how he
  came to have left his master's house. Leonard related all that had happened,
  and besought his assistance in Nizza's behalf.</p>

  <p>"I will do all I can for her," replied Hodges, "for I feel greatly
  interested about her. But who is this Sir Paul Parravicin? I never heard of
  him."</p>

  <p>"I know nothing more of him than what I have told you, sir," replied
  Leonard. "He is a friend of the Earl of Rochester."</p>

  <p>"It must be a feigned name," rejoined Hodges; "but I will speedily find
  him out. You must lodge at my house tonight. It will be better for you than
  sleeping in that damp shed. But, first, I must have a word or two with your
  master. I have been abroad all night, and came hither to ascertain what he
  thought of this plan of the fires, and what he had done. How do you give the
  signal to him?"</p>

  <p>"There is a cord within the hutch by which you can sound a bell within his
  chamber," returned Leonard; "I will ring it."</p>

  <p>Accordingly, he did so, and the summons was almost instantly answered by
  the grocer. A kindly greeting passed between the latter and Hodges, who
  inquired whether all was going on satisfactorily within, and whether anything
  could be done for the family.</p>

  <p>"I would not have disturbed you at this unseasonable hour," he said, "but
  chancing to be in your neighbourhood, and thinking it likely you would be on
  the watch, I called to have a word with you. Though I could not foresee what
  would happen, I entirely disapproved of these fires as likely to increase
  rather than check the pestilence."</p>

  <p>"The hand of Heaven has extinguished them because they were lighted in
  opposition to its decrees," replied Bloundel; "but you have asked me whether
  all is going on well within. I should answer readily in the affirmative, but
  that my wife expresses much anxiety respecting Amabel. We have no longer any
  apprehension of misconduct. She is all we could desire&mdash;serious and
  devout. But we have fears for her health. The confinement may be too much for
  her. What would you recommend?"</p>

  <p>"I must see her to be able to speak confidently," replied Hodges.</p>

  <p>"I know not how that can be accomplished, unless you choose to ascend by a
  basket attached to the pulley," replied the grocer, with some hesitation,
  "and it is against my plan to admit you."</p>

  <p>"But your daughter's life, my good friend," rejoined Hodges; "think of
  that. If I choose to risk life and limb to visit her, you may surely risk the
  chance of contagion to admit me. But you need have no fear. Sprinkle your
  room with spirits of sulphur, and place a phial of vinegar so that I can use
  it on my first entrance into the house, and I will answer for the safety of
  your family."</p>

  <p>These preparations made, Mr. Bloundel lowered the basket, into which
  Hodges got, and grasping the rope, not without some misgiving on his part, he
  was drawn up. Leonard witnessed his ascent with a beating heart, and could
  scarcely repress a feeling of envy when he saw him pass through the window,
  and knew that he would soon be in the presence of Amabel. But this feeling
  quickly changed into one of deep anxiety concerning her. Her father's account
  of her had increased the uneasiness he previously felt, and he was as anxious
  to know the doctor's opinion of her, as if his own fate had depended upon it.
  He was kept in this painful state of suspense for nearly an hour, when voices
  were heard at the window, and presently afterwards Hodges was carefully let
  down. Bidding the grocer farewell, he desired Leonard to follow him, and led
  the way towards Cheapside. They proceeded a short distance in silence, when
  the latter ventured to remark, "You say nothing about Amabel, sir? I fear you
  found her seriously indisposed."</p>

  <p>"Do not question me about her just now," rejoined the doctor, in a subdued
  emotion. "I would rather not discuss the subject."</p>

  <p>Nothing more was said; for though the apprentice would willingly have
  continued the conversation, his companion's evident disinclination to pursue
  it compelled him to desist. In this way, they reached the doctor's residence,
  where Leonard was immediately shown to a comfortable bed.</p>

  <p>It was late when he awoke next day, and as the doctor was gone forth, he
  partook of a plentiful breakfast which was placed before him, and repaired to
  Wood-street, but his master having no commissions for him to execute, he went
  back again. By this time, Doctor Hodges had returned, and calling him into
  his library told him he wished to speak with him.</p>

  <p>"You were right last night," he said, "in construing my silence into alarm
  for Amabel. In truth, I fear she is rapidly sinking into a decline, and
  nothing will arrest the progress of the insidious disease but instant removal
  to the country. To this she will not consent, neither do I know how it could
  be accomplished. It is pitiable to see so lovely a creature dying, as I fear
  she is, of a broken heart."</p>

  <p>Leonard covered his face with his hands, and wept aloud.</p>

  <p>"We have not yet spoken of Nizza Macascree," said Hodges, after a pause,
  tapping him kindly on the shoulder. "I think I have discovered a trace of
  her."</p>

  <p>"I am glad to hear it," replied Leonard, rousing himself. "She is another
  victim of these profligates. But I will be revenged upon them all."</p>

  <p>"I have before enjoined you to restrain your indignation, just though it
  be," returned Hodges. "I have not yet found out whither she has been taken.
  But I have a clue which, unless I am mistaken, will lead me to it. But I must
  now dismiss you, I have other affairs to attend to, and must give a dangerous
  and difficult case, on which I have been consulted, undisturbed
  consideration. Make my house your home as long as you think proper."</p>

  <p>Warmly thanking the doctor, Leonard then withdrew. Shortly after this, he
  walked forth, and ascertaining that he was not required by his master,
  determined to satisfy himself by actual observation of the extent of the
  ravages of the plague.</p>

  <p>With this view, he shaped his course along Lad-lane, and traversing
  Cateaton-street, entered Lothbury. The number of houses which he here found
  closed, with red crosses on the doors, and the fatal inscription above them,
  convinced him that the deplorable accounts he had heard were not exaggerated.
  In passing some of these habitations, he saw such ghastly faces at the
  windows, and heard such lamentable cries, that he was glad to hurry on and
  get out of sight and hearing. In Throgmorton-street, nearly opposite Drapers'
  Hall, a poor wretch suddenly opened a casement, and before his attendants
  could force him back, threw himself from a great height to the ground, and
  broke his neck. Another incident, of an equally distressing nature, occurred.
  A young and richly-dressed young man issued from a tavern in Broad-street,
  and with a wild and inflamed countenance, staggered along. He addressed some
  insulting language to Leonard, but the latter, who desired no quarrel,
  disregarded his remarks, and let him pass. The next person encountered by the
  drunken man was a young female. Suddenly catching her in his arms, he
  imprinted a kiss upon her lips: and then, with a frightful laugh, shouted, "I
  have given you the plague! Look here!" and tearing aside the collar of his
  shirt, he exhibited a large tumour. The young woman uttered a shriek of
  terror and fainted, while her ruthless assailant took to his heels, and
  running as long as his strength lasted, fell down, and was taken to the
  pest-house, where he was joined that same night by his victim. And this was
  by no means an uncommon occurrence. The distemper acted differently on
  different temperaments. Some it inflamed to an ungovernable pitch of madness,
  others it reduced to the depths of despair, while in many cases it brought
  out and aggravated the worst parts of the character. Wives conveyed the
  infection intentionally to their husbands, husbands to their wives, parents
  to their children, lovers to the objects of their affection, while, as in the
  case above mentioned, many persons ran about like rabid hounds, striving to
  communicate it to all they met. Greatly shocked at what had occurred, and yet
  not altogether surprised at it, for his mind had become familiarized with
  horrors, Leonard struck down Finch-lane, and proceeded towards Cornhill. On
  the way, he noticed two dead bodies lying at the mouth of a small alley, and
  hastening past, was stopped at the entrance to Cornhill by a butcher's
  apprentice, who was wheeling away the body of an old man, who had just died
  while purchasing meat at a stall at Stock's Market. Filled with unutterable
  loathing at this miserable spectacle, Leonard was fain to procure a glass of
  canary to recruit his spirits.</p>

  <p>Accordingly he proceeded to the Globe Tavern at the corner of
  Birchin-lane. As he entered the house, a lively strain of music caught his
  ear, and glancing in the direction of the sound, he found it proceeded from
  the blind piper, Mike Macascree, who was playing to some half-dozen
  roystering youths. Bell lay at her master's feet; and as Leonard approached
  the party, she pricked up her ears, and being called by name, instantly
  sprang towards him, and manifested the strongest delight. The piper stopped
  playing to listen to what was going forward but the young men urged him to
  proceed, and again filled his glass.</p>

  <p>"Don't drink any more, Mike," said Leonard, "but step aside with me. I've
  something to say to you&mdash;something about your daughter."</p>

  <p>"My daughter!" exclaimed the piper, in a half-angry, half-sorrowful voice,
  while a slight moisture forced itself through his orbless lids. "I don't want
  to hear anything about her, except that she is dead. She has deserted me, and
  disgraced herself."</p>

  <p>"You are mistaken," rejoined Leonard; "and if you will come with me, I
  will explain the truth to you."</p>

  <p>"I will listen to no explanation," rejoined the piper, furiously, "she has
  given me pain enough already. I'm engaged with this jovial company. Fill my
  glass, my masters&mdash;there, fill it again," he added, draining it eagerly,
  and with the evident wish to drown all thought. "There, now you shall have
  such a tune, as was never listened to by mortal ears."</p>

  <p>A loud laugh from the young men followed this proposition, and the piper
  played away so furiously, that it added to their merriment. Touched with
  compassion, Leonard walked aside, hoping, when the party broke up, to be able
  to have a word with the poor man. But the piper's excitement increased. He
  played faster and drank harder, until it was evident he was no longer in a
  condition to speak rationally. Leonard, therefore, addressed himself to the
  drawer, and desired him to look after the piper, engaging to return before
  midnight to see how he went on. The drawer promising compliance, Leonard
  departed; and not feeling disposed to continue his walk, returned to
  Wood-street.</p>

  <p>Nothing particular occurred during the evening. Leonard did not see Doctor
  Hodges, who was engaged in his professional duties; and after keeping watch
  before the grocer's till nearly midnight, he again retraced his steps to the
  Globe. The drawer was at the door, and about to close the house.</p>

  <p>"You will be sorry to learn the fate of the poor piper," he said.</p>

  <p>"Why, what has happened to him?" cried Leonard.</p>

  <p>"He is dead of the plague," was the reply.</p>

  <p>"What, so suddenly!" exclaimed the apprentice. "You are jesting with
  me."</p>

  <p>"Alas! it is no jest," rejoined the drawer, in a tone that convinced the
  apprentice of his sincerity. "His entertainers quitted him about two hours
  ago, and in spite of my efforts to detain him, he left the house, and sat
  down on those steps. Concluding he would fall asleep, I did not disturb him,
  and his dog kept careful watch over him. I forgot all about him till a short
  time ago, when hearing the pest-cart pass, I went forth, and learnt that the
  drivers having found him dead, as they supposed, of the pestilence, had
  placed their forks under his belt, and thrown him upon the other dead
  bodies."</p>

  <p>"And where is the dog?" cried Leonard.</p>

  <p>"She would not quit her master," replied the drawer, "so the men threw her
  into the cart with him, saying, they would bury her in the plague-pit, as all
  dogs were ordered to be destroyed."</p>

  <p>"This must be prevented," cried Leonard. "Which way did the dead-cart
  go?"</p>

  <p>"Towards Moorgate," replied the drawer.</p>

  <p>Leonard heard no more; but dashing through a narrow passage opposite the
  Conduit, passed Bartholomew-lane, and traversing Lothbury, soon reached
  Coleman-street and the old city gate, to which he had been directed. Here he
  learnt that the dead-cart had passed through it about five minutes before,
  and he hurried on towards Finsbury Fields. He had not proceeded far when he
  heard a sound as of a pipe at a distance, furiously played, and accompanied
  by the barking of a dog. These sounds were followed by cries of alarm, and he
  presently perceived two persons running towards him, with a swiftness which
  only could be occasioned by terror. One of them carried a lantern, and
  grasping his arm, the apprentice detained him.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"The devil's the matter," replied the man&mdash;"the piper's ghost has
  appeared in that cart, and is playing his old tunes again."</p>

  <p>"Ay, it's either his spirit, or he is come to life again," observed the
  other man, stopping likewise. "I tossed him into the cart myself, and will
  swear he was dead enough then."</p>

  <p>"You have committed a dreadful mistake," cried Leonard. "You have tossed a
  living man into the cart instead of a dead one. Do you not hear those
  sounds?" And as he spoke, the notes of the pipe swelled to a louder strain
  than ever.</p>

  <p>"I tell you it is the devil&mdash;or a ghost," replied the driver; "I will
  stay here no longer."</p>

  <p>"Lend me your lantern, and I will go to the cart," rejoined Leonard.</p>

  <p>"Take it," replied the man; "but I caution you to stay where you are. You
  may receive a shock you will never survive."</p>

  <p>Paying no attention to what was said, Leonard ran towards the cart, and
  found the piper seated upon a pile of dead bodies, most of them stripped of
  their covering, with Bell by his side, and playing away at a prodigious
  rate.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch3-3"
     name="ch3-3">III. &mdash; THE DANCE OF DEATH.</a></h2>

  <p>The condition of the prisons at this season was really frightful. In
  Newgate, in particular, where the distemper broke out at the beginning of
  June, it raged with such violence that in less than a week, more than half
  the prisoners were swept off, and it appeared probable, that, unless its fury
  abated, not a soul would be left alive within it. At all times, this crowded
  and ill-kept prison was infested by the gaol-fever and other pestilential
  disorders, but these were mild in comparison with the present terrible
  visitation. The atmosphere was noisome and malignant; the wards were never
  cleansed; and many poor wretches, who died in their cells, were left there
  till the attendants on the dead-cart chose to drag them forth. No restraint
  being placed upon the sick, and the rules of the prison allowing them the
  free use of any strong liquors they could purchase, the scenes that occurred
  were too dreadful and revolting for description, and could only be paralleled
  by the orgies of a pandemonium. Many reckless beings, conscious that they
  were attacked by a fatal disorder, drank as long as they could raise the' cup
  to their lips, and after committing the wildest and most shocking
  extravagances, died in a state of frenzy.</p>

  <p>Newgate became thus, as it were, the very focus of infection, where the
  plague assumed its worst aspect, and where its victims perished far more
  expeditiously than elsewhere. Two of the turnkeys had already died of the
  distemper, and such was the alarm entertained, that no persons could be found
  to supply their places. To penetrate the recesses of the prison, was almost
  to insure destruction, and none but the attendants of the dead-cart and the
  nurses attempted it. Among the latter was Judith. Employed as a nurse on the
  first outburst of the plague, she willingly and fearlessly undertook the
  office. The worse the disease became the better pleased she appeared; and she
  was so utterly without apprehension, that when no one would approach the cell
  where some wretched sufferer lay expiring, she unhesitatingly entered it. But
  it was not to render aid, but to plunder, that she thus exercised her
  functions. She administered no medicine, dressed no tumours, and did not
  contribute in the slightest degree to the comfort of the miserable wretches
  committed to her charge. All she desired was to obtain whatever valuables
  they possessed, or to wring from them any secret that might afterwards be
  turned to account. Foreseeing that Newgate must ere long be depopulated, and
  having no fears for herself, she knew that she must then be liberated, and be
  able once more to renew her mischievous practices upon mankind. Her
  marvellous preservation throughout all the dangers to which she was exposed
  seemed almost to warrant the supposition that she had entered into a compact
  with the pestilence, to extend its ravages by every means in her power, on
  the condition of being spared herself.</p>

  <p>Soon after the outbreak of the plague in Newgate, all the debtors were
  liberated, and if the keepers had had their own way, the common felons would
  have been likewise released. But this could not be, and they were kept to
  perish as before described. Matters, however, grew so serious, that it became
  a question whether the few miserable wretches left alive ought to be longer
  detained, and at last the turnkeys refusing to act any longer, and delivering
  their keys to the governor, the whole of the prisoners were set free.</p>

  <p>On the night of their liberation, Chowles and Judith proceeded to the
  vaults of Saint Faith's, to deposit within them the plunder they had obtained
  in the prison. They found them entirely deserted. Neither verger, sexton, nor
  any other person, was to be seen, and they took up their quarters in the
  crypt. Having brought a basket of provisions and a few bottles of wine with
  them, they determined to pass the night in revelry; and, accordingly, having
  lighted a fire with the fragments of old coffins brought from the charnel,
  they sat down to their meal. Having done full justice to it, and disposed of
  the first flask, they were about to abandon themselves to unrestrained
  enjoyment, when their glee was all at once interrupted by a strange and
  unaccountable noise in the adjoining church. Chowles, who had just commenced
  chanting one of his wild melodies, suddenly stopped, and Judith set down the
  glass she had raised to her lips untested. What could it mean? Neither of
  them could tell. It seemed like strains of unearthly music, mixed with
  shrieks and groans as of tortured spirits, accompanied by peals of such
  laughter as might be supposed to proceed, from demons.</p>

  <p>"The dead are burst forth from their tombs," cried Chowles, in a quavering
  voice, "and are attended by a legion of evil spirits."</p>

  <p>"It would seem so," replied Judith, rising. "I should like to behold the
  sight. Come with me."</p>

  <p>"Not for the world!" rejoined Chowles, shuddering, "and I would recommend
  you to stay where you are. You may behold your dead husband among them."</p>

  <p>"Do you think so?" rejoined Judith, halting.</p>

  <p>"I am sure of it," cried Chowles, eagerly. "Stay where you are&mdash;stay
  where you are."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, there was another peal of infernal laughter, and the strains
  of music grew louder each moment.</p>

  <p>"Come what may, I will see what it is," said Judith, emptying her glass,
  as if seeking courage from the draught. "Surely," she added, in a taunting
  tone, "you will come with me."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid of nothing earthly," rejoined Chowles&mdash;"but I do not
  like to face beings of another world."</p>

  <p>"Then I will go alone," rejoined Judith.</p>

  <p>"Nay, that shall never be," replied Chowles, tottering after her.</p>

  <p>As they opened the door and crossed the charnel, such an extraordinary
  combination of sounds burst upon their ears that they again paused, and
  looked anxiously at each other. Chowles laid his hand on his companion's arm,
  and strove to detain her, but she would not be stayed, and he was forced to
  proceed. Setting down the lamp on the stone floor, Judith passed into the
  subterranean church, where she beheld a sight that almost petrified her. In
  the midst of the nave, which was illumined by a blue glimmering light, whence
  proceeding it was impossible to determine, stood a number of grotesque
  figures, apparelled in fantastic garbs, and each attended by a skeleton. Some
  of the latter grisly shapes were playing on tambours, others on psalteries,
  others on rebecs&mdash;every instrument producing the strangest sound
  imaginable. Viewed through the massive pillars, beneath that dark and
  ponderous roof, and by the mystic light before described, this strange
  company had a supernatural appearance, and neither Chowles nor Judith doubted
  for a moment that they beheld before them a congregation of phantoms. An
  irresistible feeling of curiosity prompted them to advance. On drawing
  nearer, they found the assemblage comprehended all ranks of society. There
  was a pope in his tiara and pontifical dress; a cardinal in his cap and
  robes; a monarch with a sceptre in his hand, and arrayed in the habiliments
  of royalty; a crowned queen; a bishop wearing his mitre, and carrying his
  crosier; an abbot, likewise in his mitre, and bearing a crosier; a duke in
  his robes of state; a grave canon of the church; a knight sheathed in armour;
  a judge, an advocate, and a magistrate, all in their robes; a mendicant friar
  and a nun; and the list was completed by a physician, an astrologer, a miser,
  a merchant, a duchess, a pedler, a soldier, a gamester, an idiot, a robber, a
  blind man, and a beggar&mdash;each distinguishable by his apparel.</p>

  <p>By-and-by, with a wild and gibbering laugh that chilled the beholders'
  blood, one of the tallest and grisliest of the skeletons sprang forward, and
  beating his drum, the whole ghostly company formed, two and two, into a
  line&mdash;a skeleton placing itself on the right of every mortal. In this
  order, the fantastic procession marched between the pillars, the unearthly
  music playing all the while, and disappeared at the further extremity of the
  church. With the last of the group, the mysterious light vanished, and
  Chowles and his companion were left in profound darkness.</p>

  <p>"What can it mean?" cried Judith, as soon as she recovered her speech.
  "Are they human, or spirits?"</p>

  <p>"Human beings don't generally amuse themselves in this way," returned
  Chowles. "But hark!&mdash;I still hear the music.&mdash;They are
  above&mdash;in Saint Paul's."</p>

  <p>"Then I will join them," said Judith. "I am resolved to see the end of
  it."</p>

  <p>"Don't leave me behind," returned Chowles, following her. "I would rather
  keep company with Beelzebub and all his imps than be alone."</p>

  <p>Both were too well acquainted with the way to need any light. Ascending
  the broad stone steps, they presently emerged into the cathedral, which they
  found illumined by the same glimmering light as the lower church, and they
  perceived the ghostly assemblage gathered into an immense ring, and dancing
  round the tall skeleton, who continued beating his drum, and uttering a
  strange gibbering sound, which was echoed by the others. Each moment the
  dancers increased the swiftness of their pace, until at last it grew to a
  giddy whirl, and then, all at once, with a shriek of laughter, the whole
  company fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>Chowles and Judith, then, for the first time, understood, from the
  confusion that ensued, and the exclamations uttered, that they were no
  spirits they had to deal with, but beings of the same mould as themselves.
  Accordingly, they approached the party of masquers, for such they proved, and
  found on inquiry that they were a party of young gallants, who, headed by the
  Earl of Rochester&mdash;the representative of the tall skeleton&mdash;had
  determined to realize the Dance of Death, as once depicted on the walls of an
  ancient cloister at the north of the cathedral, called Pardon-churchyard, on
  the walls of which, says Stowe, were "artificially and richly painted the
  Dance of Macabre, or Dance of Death, commonly called the Dance of Paul's, the
  like whereof was painted about Saint Innocent's, at Paris. The metres, or
  poesy of this dance," proceeds the same authority, "were translated out of
  Trench into English by John Lydgate, monk of Bury, and, with the picture of
  Death leading all estates, painted about the cloister, at the special request
  and expense of Jenkin Carpenter, in the reign of Henry the Sixth."
  Pardon-churchyard was pulled down by the Protector Somerset, in the reign of
  Edward the Sixth, and the materials employed in the erection of his own
  palace in the Strand. It was the discussion of these singular paintings, and
  of the designs on the same subject ascribed to Holbein, that led the Earl of
  Rochester and his companions to propose the fantastic spectacle above
  described. With the disposition which this reckless nobleman possessed to
  turn the most solemn and appalling subjects to jest, he thought no season so
  fitting for such an entertainment as the present&mdash;just as in our own
  time the lively Parisians made the cholera, while raging in their city, the
  subject of a carnival pastime. The exhibition witnessed by Chowles and Judith
  was a rehearsal of the masque intended to be represented in the cathedral on
  the following night.</p>

  <p>Again marshalling his band, the Earl of Rochester beat his drum, and
  skipping before them, led the way towards the south door of the cathedral,
  which was thrown open by an unseen hand, and the procession glided through it
  like a troop of spectres. Chowles, whose appearance was not unlike that of an
  animated skeleton, was seized with a strange desire to join in what was going
  forward, and taking off his doublet, and baring his bony arms and legs, he
  followed the others, dancing round Judith in the same manner that the other
  skeletons danced round their partners.</p>

  <p>On reaching the Convocation House, a door was opened, and the procession
  entered the cloisters; and here Chowles, dragging Judith into the area
  between him and the beautiful structure they surrounded, began a dance of so
  extraordinary a character that the whole troop collected round to witness it.
  Rochester beat his drum, and the other representatives of mortality who were
  provided with musical instruments struck up a wild kind of accompaniment, to
  which Chowles executed the most grotesque flourishes. So wildly excited did
  he become, and such extravagances did he commit, that even Judith stared
  aghast at him, and began to think his wits were fled. Now he whirled round
  her&mdash;now sprang high into the air&mdash;now twined his lean arms round
  her waist&mdash;now peeped over one shoulder, now over the other&mdash;and at
  last griped her neck so forcibly, that he might perhaps have strangled her,
  if she had not broken from him, and dealt him a severe blow that brought him
  senseless to the ground. On recovering, he found himself in the arched
  entrance of a large octagonal chamber, lighted at each side by a lofty
  pointed window filled with stained glass. Round this chamber ran a wide stone
  bench, with a richly-carved back of the same material, on which the masquers
  were seated, and opposite the entrance was a raised seat, ordinarily allotted
  to the dean, but now occupied by the Earl of Rochester. A circular oak table
  stood in the midst of the chamber, covered with magnificent silver dishes,
  heaped with the choicest viands, which were handed to the guests by the
  earl's servants, all of whom represented skeletons, and it had a strange
  effect, to behold these ghastly objects filling the cups of the revellers,
  bending obsequiously before some blooming dame, or crowding round their
  spectral-looking lord.</p>

  <p>At first, Chowles was so confused, that he thought he must have awakened
  in another world, but by degrees he called to mind what had occurred, and
  ascertained from Judith that he was in the Convocation House. Getting up, he
  joined the train of grisly attendants, and acquitted himself so well that the
  earl engaged him as performer in the masque. He was furthermore informed
  that, in all probability, the king himself, with many of his favourite
  nobles, and the chief court beauties, would be present to witness the
  spectacle.</p>

  <p>The banquet over, word was brought that chairs and coaches were without,
  and the company departed, leaving behind only a few attendants, who remained
  to put matters in order.</p>

  <p>While they were thus occupied, Judith, who had fixed her greedy eyes upon
  the plate, observed, in an under-tone, to Chowles, "There will be fine
  plunder for us. We must manage to carry off all that plate while they are
  engaged in the masque."</p>

  <p>"You must do it yourself, then," returned Chowles, in the same
  tone&mdash;"for I shall have to play a principal part in the entertainment,
  and as the king himself will be present, I cannot give up such an opportunity
  of distinguishing myself."</p>

  <p>"You can have no share in the prize, if you lend no assistance," replied
  Judith, with a dissatisfied look.</p>

  <p>"Of course not," rejoined Chowles; "on this occasion it is all yours. The
  Dance of Death is too much to my taste to be given up."</p>

  <p>Perceiving they were noticed, Chowles and Judith then left the Convocation
  House, and returned to the vault in Saint Faith's, nor did they emerge from
  it until late on the following day.</p>

  <p>Some rumour of the masque having gone abroad, towards evening a crowd,
  chiefly composed of the most worthless order of society, collected under the
  portico at the western entrance, and the great doors being opened by Chowles,
  they entered the cathedral. Thus was this sacred building once more
  invaded&mdash;once again a scene of noise, riot, and confusion&mdash;its
  vaulted roofs instead of echoing the voice of prayer, or the choral hymn,
  resounded with loud laughter, imprecations, and licentious discourse. This
  disorder, however, was kept in some bounds by a strong body of the royal
  guard, who soon afterwards arrived, and stationing themselves in parties of
  three or four at each of the massive columns flanking the aisles, maintained
  some show of decorum. Besides these, there were others of the royal
  attendants, bearing torches, who walked from place to place, and compelled
  all loiterers in dark corners to proceed to the nave.</p>

  <p>A little before midnight, the great doors were again thrown open, and a
  large troop of richly-attired personages, all wearing masks, were admitted.
  For a short time they paced to and fro between its shafted pillars gazing at
  the spectators grouped around, and evidently, from their jests and laughter,
  not a little entertained by the scene. As the clock struck twelve, however,
  all sounds were hushed, and the courtly party stationed themselves on the
  steps leading to the choir. At the same moment, also, the torches were
  extinguished, and the whole of the building buried in profound darkness.
  Presently after, a sound was heard of footsteps approaching the nave, but
  nothing could be discerned. Expectation was kept on the rack for some
  minutes, during which many a stifled cry was heard from those whose courage
  failed them at this trying juncture. All at once, a blue light illumined the
  nave, and partially revealed the lofty pillars by which it was surrounded. By
  this light the whole of the ghostly company could be seen drawn up near the
  western door. They were arranged two and two, a skeleton standing as before
  on the right of each character. The procession next marched slowly and
  silently towards the choir, and drew up at the foot of the steps, to give the
  royal party an opportunity of examining them. After pausing there for a few
  minutes, Rochester, in the dress of the larger skeleton, started off, and,
  beating his drum, was followed by the pope and his attendant skeleton. This
  couple having danced together for some minutes, to the infinite diversion of
  the spectators, disappeared behind a pillar, and were succeeded by the
  monarch and a second skeleton. These, in their turn, gave way to the cardinal
  and his companion, and so on till the whole of the masquers had exhibited
  themselves, when at a signal from the earl the party re-appeared, and formed
  a ring round him. The dance was executed with great spirit, and elicited
  tumultuous applause from all the beholders. The earl now retired, and Chowles
  took his place. He was clothed in an elastic dress painted of a leaden and
  cadaverous colour, which fitted closely to his fleshless figure, and defined
  all his angularities. He carried an hour-glass in one hand and a dart in the
  other, and in the course of the dance kept continually pointing the latter at
  those who moved around him. His feats of the previous evening were nothing to
  his present achievements. His joints creaked, and his eyes flamed like
  burning coals. As he continued, his excitement increased. He bounded higher,
  and his countenance assumed so hideous an expression, that those near him
  recoiled in terror, crying, "Death himself had broke loose among them." The
  consternation soon became general. The masquers fled in dismay, and scampered
  along the aisles scarcely knowing whither they were going. Delighted with the
  alarm he occasioned, Chowles chased a large party along the northern aisle,
  and was pursuing them across the transept upon which it opened, when he was
  arrested in his turn by another equally formidable figure, who suddenly
  placed himself in his path.</p>

  <p>"Hold!" exclaimed Solomon Eagle&mdash;for it was the enthusiast&mdash;in a
  voice of thunder, "it is time this scandalous exhibition should cease. Know
  all ye who make a mockery of death, that his power will be speedily and
  fearfully approved upon you. Thine not to escape the vengeance of the Great
  Being whose temple you have profaned. And you, O king! who have sanctioned
  these evil doings by your presence, and who by your own dissolute life set a
  pernicious example to all your subjects, know that your city shall be utterly
  laid waste, first by plague and then by fire. Tremble! my warning is as
  terrible and true as the handwriting on the wall."</p>

  <p>"Who art thou who holdest this language towards me?" demanded Charles.</p>

  <p>"I am called Solomon Eagle," replied the enthusiast, "and am charged with
  a mission from on high to warn your doomed people of their fate. Be warned
  yourself, sire! Your end will be sudden. You will be snatched away in the
  midst of your guilty pleasure, and with little time for repentance. Be
  warned, I say again."</p>

  <p>With this he turned to depart.</p>

  <p>"Secure the knave," cried Charles, angrily. "He shall be soundly scourged
  for his insolence."</p>

  <p>But bursting through the guard, Solomon Eagle ran swiftly up the choir and
  disappeared, nor could his pursuers discover any traces of him.</p>

  <p>"Strange!" exclaimed the king, when he was told of the enthusiast's
  escape. "Let us go to supper. This masque has given me the vapours."</p>

  <p>"Pray Heaven it have not given us the plague," observed the fair Stewart,
  who stood beside him, taking his arm.</p>

  <p>"It is to be hoped not," rejoined Charles; "but, odds fish! it is a most
  dismal affair."</p>

  <p>"It is so, in more ways than one," replied Rochester, "for I have just
  learnt that all my best plate has been carried off from the Convocation
  House. I shall only be able to offer your majesty and your fair partner a
  sorry supper."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch3-4"
     name="ch3-4">IV. &mdash; THE PLAGUE-PIT.</a></h2>

  <p>On being made acquainted by Leonard, who helped him out of the pest-cart,
  with the danger he had run, the piper uttered a cry of terror, and swooned
  away. The buriers, seeing how matters stood, and that their superstitious
  fears were altogether groundless, now returned, and one of them, producing a
  phial of vinegar, sprinkled the fainting man with it, and speedily brought
  him to himself. But though so far recovered, his terror had by no means
  abated, and he declared his firm conviction that he was infected by the
  pestilence.</p>

  <p>"I have been carried towards the plague-pit by mistake," he said. "I shall
  soon be conveyed thither in right earnest, and not have the power of
  frightening away my conductors on the road."</p>

  <p>"Pooh! pooh!" cried one of the buriers, jestingly. "I hope you will often
  ride with us, and play us many a merry tune as you go. You shall always be
  welcome to a seat in the cart."</p>

  <p>"Be of good cheer," added Leonard, "and all will be well. Come with me to
  an apothecary's shop, and I will procure a cordial for you, which shall
  speedily dispel your qualms."</p>

  <p>The piper shook his head, and replied, with a deep groan, that he was
  certain all was over with him.</p>

  <p>"However, I will not reject your kindness," he added, "though I feel I am
  past the help of medicine."</p>

  <p>"With this, he whistled to Bell, who was skipping about Leonard, having
  recognised him on his first approach, and they proceeded towards the second
  postern in London-wall, between Moorgate and Cripplegate; while the buriers,
  laughing heartily at the adventure, took their way towards the plague-pit,
  and discharged their dreadful load within it. Arrived in Basinghall-street,
  and looking round, Leonard soon discovered by the links at the door, as well
  as by the crowd collected before it&mdash;for day and night the apothecaries'
  dwellings were besieged by the sick&mdash;the shop of which he was in search.
  It was long before they could obtain admittance, and during this time the
  piper said he felt himself getting rapidly worse; but, imagining he was
  merely labouring under the effect of fright, Leonard paid little attention to
  his complaints. The apothecary, however, no sooner set eyes upon him, than he
  pronounced him infected, and, on examination, it proved that the fatal tokens
  had already appeared.</p>

  <p>"I knew it was so," cried the piper. "Take me to the pest-house&mdash;take
  me to the pest-house!"</p>

  <p>"His desire had better be complied with," observed the apothecary. "He is
  able to walk thither now, but I will not answer for his being able to do so
  two hours hence. It is a bad case," he added in an under-tone to Leonard.</p>

  <p>Feeing the apothecary, Leonard set out with the piper, and passing through
  Cripplegate, they entered the open fields. Here they paused for a moment, and
  the little dog ran round and round them, barking gleefully.</p>

  <p>"Poor Bell!" cried the piper; "what will become of thee when I am
  gone?"</p>

  <p>"If you will entrust her to me, I will take care of her," replied
  Leonard.</p>

  <p>"She is yours," rejoined the piper, in a voice hoarse with emotion. "Be
  kind to her for my sake, and for the sake of her unfortunate mistress."</p>

  <p>"Since you have alluded to your daughter," returned Leonard, "I must tell
  you what has become of her. I have not hitherto mentioned the subject,
  fearing it might distress you."</p>

  <p>"Have no further consideration, but speak out," rejoined the piper. "Be it
  what it may, I will bear it like a man."</p>

  <p>Leonard then briefly recounted all that had occurred, describing Nizza's
  disguise as a page, and her forcible abduction by Parravicin. He was
  frequently interrupted by the groans of his hearer, who at last gave vent to
  his rage and anguish in words.</p>

  <p>"Heaven's direst curse upon her ravisher!" he cried. "May he endure worse
  misery than I now endure. She is lost for ever."</p>

  <p>"She may yet be preserved," rejoined Leonard. "Doctor Hodges thinks he has
  discovered her retreat, and I will not rest till I find her."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;no, you will never find her," replied the piper, bitterly; "or
  if you do, it will be only to bewail her ruin."</p>

  <p>His rage then gave way to such an access of grief, that, letting his head
  fall on Leonard's shoulder, he wept aloud.</p>

  <p>"There is a secret connected with that poor girl," he said, at length,
  controlling his emotion by a powerful effort, "which must now go to the grave
  with me. The knowledge of it would only add to her distress."</p>

  <p>"You view the matter too unfavourably," replied Leonard; "and if the
  secret is of any moment, I entreat you to confide it to me. If your worst
  apprehensions should prove well founded, I promise you it shall never be
  revealed to her."</p>

  <p>"On that condition only, I will confide it to you," replied the piper;
  "but not now&mdash;not now&mdash;to-morrow morning, if I am alive."</p>

  <p>"It may be out of your power then," returned Leonard, "For your daughter's
  sake, I urge you not to delay."</p>

  <p>"It is for her sake I am silent," rejoined the piper. "Come
  along&mdash;come along" he added, hurrying forward. "Are we far from the
  pest-house? My strength is failing me."</p>

  <p>On arriving at their destination, they were readily admitted to the
  asylum; but a slight difficulty arose, which, however, was speedily obviated.
  All the couches were filled, but on examining them it was found that one of
  the sick persons had just been released from his sufferings, and the body
  being removed, the piper was allowed to take its place. Leonard remained by
  him for a short time, but, overpowered by the pestilential effluvia, and the
  sight of so many miserable objects, he was compelled to seek the open air.
  Returning, however, shortly afterwards, he found the piper in a very
  perturbed state. On hearing Leonard's voice he appeared greatly relieved,
  and, taking his gown from beneath his pillow, gave it to him, and desired him
  to unrip a part of the garment, in which it was evident something was sewn.
  The apprentice complied, and a small packet dropped forth.</p>

  <p>"Take it," said the piper; "and if I die,&mdash;and Nizza should happily
  be preserved from her ravisher, give it her. But not otherwise&mdash;not
  otherwise. Implore her to forgive me&mdash;to pity me."</p>

  <p>"Forgive you&mdash;her father?" cried Leonard, in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"That packet will explain all," replied the piper in a troubled tone. "You
  promised to take charge of poor Bell," he added, drawing forth the little
  animal, who had crept to the foot of the bed, "here she is. Farewell! my
  faithful friend," he added, pressing his rough lips to her forehead, while
  she whined piteously, as if beseeching him to allow her to remain; "farewell
  for ever."</p>

  <p>"Not for ever, I trust," replied Leonard, taking her gently from him.</p>

  <p>"And now you had better go," said the piper. "Return, if you can,
  to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"I will,&mdash;I will," replied Leonard; and he hurried out of the
  room.</p>

  <p>He was followed to the door by the young chirurgeon&mdash;the same who had
  accompanied Mr. Bloundel during his inspection of the pest-house,&mdash;and
  he inquired of him if he thought the piper's case utterly hopeless.</p>

  <p>"Not utterly so," replied the young man. "I shall be able to speak more
  positively in a few hours. At present, I think, with care and attention,
  there <i>is</i> a chance of his recovery."</p>

  <p>Much comforted by this assurance, Leonard departed, and afraid to put Bell
  to the ground lest she should run back to her master, he continued to carry
  her, and endeavoured to attach her to him by caresses and endearments. The
  little animal showed her sense of his kindness by licking his hands, but she
  still remained inconsolable, and ever and anon struggled to get free. Making
  the best of his way to Wood-street, he entered the hutch, and placing a
  little straw in one corner for Bell, threw himself on a bench and dropped
  asleep. At six o'clock he was awakened by the barking of the dog, and opening
  the door beheld Dallison. The grocer was at the window above, and about to
  let down a basket of provisions to them. To Leonard's eager inquiries after
  Amabel, Mr. Bloundel replied by a melancholy shake of the head, and soon
  afterwards withdrew. With a sad heart, the apprentice then broke his
  fast,&mdash;not forgetting at the same time the wants of his little
  companion,&mdash;and finding he was not required by his master, he proceeded
  to Doctor Hodges' residence. He was fortunate enough to find the friendly
  physician at home, and, after relating to him what had occurred, committed
  the packet to his custody.</p>

  <p>"It will be safer in your keeping than mine," he said; "and if anything
  should happen to me, you will, I am sure, observe the wishes of the poor
  piper."</p>

  <p>"Rely upon it, I will," replied Hodges. "I am sorry to tell you I have
  been misled as to the clue I fancied I had obtained to Nizza's retreat. We
  are as far from the mark as ever."</p>

  <p>"Might not the real name of the villain who has assumed the name of Sir
  Paul Parravicin be ascertained from the Earl of Rochester?" rejoined
  Leonard.</p>

  <p>"So I thought," replied Hodges; "and I made the attempt yesterday, but it
  failed. I was at Whitehall, and finding the earl in the king's presence,
  suddenly asked him where I could find his friend Sir Paul Parravicin. He
  looked surprised at the question, glanced significantly at the monarch, and
  then carelessly answered that he knew no such person."</p>

  <p>"A strange idea crosses me," cried Leonard. "Can it be the king who has
  assumed this disguise?"</p>

  <p>"At one time I suspected as much," rejoined Hodges; "but setting aside
  your description of the person, which does not tally with that of Charles, I
  am satisfied from other circumstances it is not so. After all, I should not
  wonder if poor Bell," smoothing her long silky ears as she lay in the
  apprentice's arms, "should help us to discover her mistress. And now," he
  added, "I shall go to Wood-street to inquire after Amabel, and will then
  accompany you to the pest-house. From what you tell me the young chirurgeon
  said of the piper, I do not despair of his recovery."</p>

  <p>"Poor as his chance may appear, it is better, I fear, than Amabel's,"
  sighed the apprentice.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" exclaimed Hodges, in a sorrowful tone, "hers is slight indeed."</p>

  <p>And perceiving that the apprentice was greatly moved, he waited for a
  moment till he had recovered himself, and then, motioning him to follow him,
  they quitted the house together.</p>

  <p>On reaching Mr. Bloundel's habitation, Leonard pulled the cord in the
  hutch, and the grocer appeared at the window.</p>

  <p>"My daughter has not left her bed this morning," he said, in answer to the
  doctor's inquiries, "and I fear she is much worse. My wife is with her. It
  would be a great satisfaction to me if you would see her again."</p>

  <p>After some little hesitation, Hodges assented, and was drawn up as before.
  He returned in about half an hour, and his grave countenance convinced
  Leonard that his worst anticipations were correct. He therefore forbore to
  question him, and they walked towards Cripplegate in silence.</p>

  <p>On emerging into the fields, Hodges observed to his companion, "It is
  strange that I who daily witness such dreadful suffering should be pained by
  the gradual and easy decline of Amabel. But so it is. Her case touches me
  more than the worst I have seen of the plague."</p>

  <p>"I can easily account for the feeling," groaned Leonard.</p>

  <p>"I am happy to say I have prevailed on her, if she does not improve in a
  short time,&mdash;and there is not the slightest chance of it,&mdash;to try
  the effect of a removal to the country. Her father also consents to the
  plan."</p>

  <p>"I am glad to hear it," replied Leonard. "But whither will she go, and who
  will watch over her?"</p>

  <p>"That is not yet settled," rejoined Hodges.</p>

  <p>"Oh! that I might be permitted to undertake the office!" cried Leonard,
  passionately.</p>

  <p>"Restrain yourself," said Hodges, in a tone of slight rebuke. "Fitting
  attendance will be found, if needed."</p>

  <p>The conversation then dropped, and they walked briskly forward. They were
  now within a short distance of the pest-house, and Leonard, hearing footsteps
  behind him, turned and beheld a closed litter, borne by two stout porters,
  and evidently containing a plague-patient. He stepped aside to let it pass,
  when Bell, suddenly pricking her ears, uttered a singular cry, and bursting
  from him, flew after the litter, leaping against it and barking joyfully. The
  porters, who were proceeding at a quick pace, tried to drive her away, but
  without effect, and she continued her cries until they reached the gates of
  the pest-house. In vain Leonard whistled to her, and called her back. She
  paid no attention whatever to him.</p>

  <p>"I almost begin to fear," said Hodges, unable to repress a shudder, "that
  the poor animal will, indeed, be the means of discovering for us the object
  of our search."</p>

  <p>"I understand what you mean," rejoined Leonard, "and am of the same
  opinion as yourself. Heaven grant we may be mistaken!"</p>

  <p>And as he spoke, he ran forward, and, followed by Hodges, reached the
  pest-house just as the litter was taken into it.</p>

  <p>"Silence that accursed dog," cried one of the porters, "and bid a nurse
  attend us. We have a patient for the women's ward."</p>

  <p>"Let me see her," cried Hodges. "I am a physician."</p>

  <p>"Readily, sir," replied the porter. "It is almost over with her, poor
  soul! It would have saved time and trouble to take her to the plague-pit at
  once. She cannot last many hours. Curse the dog! Will it never cease
  howling?"</p>

  <p>Leonard here seized Bell, fearing she might do some mischief, and with a
  sad foreboding beheld the man draw back the curtains of the litter. His fears
  proved well founded. There, stretched upon the couch, with her dark hair
  unbound, and flowing in wild disorder over her neck, lay Nizza Macascree. The
  ghastly paleness of her face could not, however, entirely rob it of its
  beauty, and her dark eyes were glazed and lustreless. At the sight of her
  mistress, poor Bell uttered so piteous a cry, that Leonard, moved by
  compassion, placed her on the pillow beside her, and the sagacious animal did
  not attempt to approach nearer, but merely licked her cheek. Roused by the
  touch, Nizza turned to see what was near her, and recognising the animal,
  made a movement to strain her to her bosom, but the pain she endured was so
  intense that she sank back with a deep groan.</p>

  <p>"From whom did you receive this young woman?" demanded Hodges, of one of
  the porters.</p>

  <p>"She was brought to us by two richly-attired lacqueys," replied the man,
  "in this very litter. They paid us to carry her here without loss of
  time."</p>

  <p>"You have an idea whose servants they were?" pursued Hodges.</p>

  <p>"Not the least," replied the fellow; "but I should judge, from the
  richness of their dress, that they belonged to some nobleman."</p>

  <p>"Did they belong to the royal household?" inquired Leonard.</p>

  <p>"No, no," rejoined the man. "I am certain as to that."</p>

  <p>"The poor girl shall not remain here," observed Hodges, to the apprentice.
  "You must convey her to my residence in Great Knightrider-street," he added,
  to the porters.</p>

  <p>"We will convey her wherever you please," replied the men, "if we are paid
  for our trouble."</p>

  <p>And they were about to close the curtains, when Nizza, having caught sight
  of the apprentice, slightly raised herself, and cried, in a voice of the
  utmost anxiety, "Is that you, Leonard?"</p>

  <p>"It is," he replied, approaching her.</p>

  <p>"Then I shall die happy, since I have seen you once more," she said. "Oh,
  do not stay near me. You may catch the infection."</p>

  <p>"Nizza," said Leonard, disregarding the caution, and breathing the words
  in her ear; "allay my fears by a word. You have not fallen a victim to the
  villain who carried you away?"</p>

  <p>"I have not, Leonard," she replied, solemnly, "I resisted his
  importunities, his threats, his violence, and would have slain myself rather
  than have yielded to him. The plague, at length, came to my rescue, and I
  have reason to be grateful to it; for it has not only delivered me from him,
  but has brought me to you."</p>

  <p>"I must now impose silence upon you," interposed Hodges, laying his finger
  on his lips; "further conversation will be hurtful."</p>

  <p>"One question more, and I have done," replied Nizza. "How came Bell with
  you&mdash;and where is my father? Nothing has happened to him?" she
  continued, observing Leonard's countenance change. "Speak! do not keep me in
  suspense. Your silence fills me with apprehension. Speak, I implore you. He
  is dead?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Leonard, "he is not dead&mdash;but he is an inmate of this
  place."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" exclaimed Nizza, falling back senseless upon the pillow.</p>

  <p>And in this state she was conveyed with the greatest expedition to the
  doctor's residence.</p>

  <p>Leonard only tarried to visit the piper, whom he found slightly delirious,
  and unable to hold any conversation with him, and promising to return in the
  evening, he set out after the litter. Nizza was placed in the best apartment
  of the doctor's house, and attended by an experienced and trustworthy nurse.
  But Hodges positively refused to let Leonard see her again, affirming that
  the excitement was too much for her, and might militate against the chance of
  her recovery.</p>

  <p>"I am not without hopes of bringing her through," he said, "and though it
  will be a severe struggle, yet, as she has youth and a good constitution on
  her side, I do not despair. If she herself would second me, I should be yet
  more confident."</p>

  <p>"How mean you?" inquired Leonard.</p>

  <p>"I think if she thought life worth a struggle&mdash;if, in short, she
  believed you would return her attachment, she would rally," answered
  Hodges.</p>

  <p>"I cannot consent to deceive her thus," rejoined Leonard, sadly. "My heart
  is fixed elsewhere."</p>

  <p>"Your heart is fixed upon one who will soon be in her grave," replied the
  doctor.</p>

  <p>"And with her my affections will be buried," rejoined Leonard, turning
  away to hide his tears.</p>

  <p>So well was the doctor's solicitude rewarded, that three days after Nizza
  had come under his care, he pronounced her out of danger. But the violence of
  the attack left her so weak and exhausted, that he still would not allow an
  interview to take place between her and Leonard. During all this time Bell
  never left her side, and her presence was an inexpressible comfort to her.
  The piper, too, was slowly recovering, and Leonard, who daily visited him,
  was glad to learn from the young chirurgeon that he would be able to leave
  the pest-house shortly. Having ascertained from Leonard that his daughter was
  under the care of Doctor Hodges, and likely to do well, the piper begged so
  earnestly that the packet might not be delivered to her, that, after some
  consultation with Hodges, Leonard restored it to him. He was delighted to get
  it back, felt it carefully over to ascertain that the seals were unbroken,
  and satisfied that all was safe, had it again sewn up in his gown, which he
  placed under his pillow.</p>

  <p>"I would rather disclose the secret to her by word of mouth than in any
  other way," he said.</p>

  <p>Leonard felt doubtful whether the secret would now be disclosed at all,
  but he made no remark.</p>

  <p>Night was drawing on as he quitted the pest-house, and he determined to
  take this opportunity of visiting the great plague-pit, which lay about a
  quarter of a mile distant, in a line with the church of
  All-Hallows-in-the-Wall, and he accordingly proceeded in that direction. The
  pit which he was about to visit was about forty feet long, twenty wide, and
  the like number deep. Into this tremendous chasm the dead were promiscuously
  thrown, without regard to sex or condition, generally stripped of their
  clothing, and covered with a slight layer of earth and quick lime.</p>

  <p>The sun was setting as Leonard walked towards this dismal place, and he
  thought he had never witnessed so magnificent a sight. Indeed, it was
  remarked that at this fatal season the sunsets were unusually splendid. The
  glorious orb sank slowly behind Saint Paul's, which formed a prominent object
  in the view from the fields, and threw out its central tower, its massive
  roof, and the two lesser towers flanking the portico, into strong relief.
  Leonard gazed at the mighty fabric, which seemed dilated to twice its size by
  this light, and wondered whether it was possible that it could ever be
  destroyed, as predicted by Solomon Eagle.</p>

  <p>Long after the sun had set, the sky was stained with crimson, and the grey
  walls of the city were tinged with rosy radiance. The heat was intense, and
  Leonard, to cool himself, sat down in the thick grass&mdash;for, though the
  crops were ready for the scythe, no mowers could be found&mdash;and, gazing
  upwards, strove to mount in spirit from the tainted earth towards heaven.
  After a while he arose, and proceeded towards the plague-pit. The grass was
  trampled down near it, and there were marks of frequent cart-wheels upon the
  sod. Great heaps of soil, thrown out of the excavation, lay on either side.
  Holding a handkerchief steeped in vinegar to his face, Leonard ventured to
  the brink of the pit. But even this precaution could not counteract the
  horrible effluvia arising from it. It was more than half filled with dead
  bodies; and through the putrid and heaving mass many disjointed limbs and
  ghastly faces could be discerned, the long hair of women and the tiny arms of
  children appearing on the surface. It was a horrible sight&mdash;so horrible,
  that it possessed a fascination peculiar to itself, and, in spite of his
  loathing, Leonard lingered to gaze at it. Strange and fantastic thoughts
  possessed him. He fancied that the legs and arms moved&mdash;that the eyes of
  some of the corpses opened and glared at him&mdash;and that the whole rotting
  mass was endowed with animation. So appalled was he by this idea that he
  turned away, and at that moment beheld a vehicle approaching. It was the
  dead-cart, charged with a heavy load to increase the already redundant
  heap.</p>

  <p>The same inexplicable and irresistible feelings of curiosity that induced
  Leonard to continue gazing upon the loathly objects in the pit, now prompted
  him to stay and see what would ensue. Two persons were with the cart, and one
  of them, to Leonard's infinite surprise and disgust, proved to be Chowles. He
  had no time, however, for the expression of any sentiment, for the cart
  halted at a little distance from him, when its conductors, turning it round,
  backed it towards the edge of the pit. The horse was then taken out, and
  Chowles calling to Leonard, the latter involuntarily knelt down to guide its
  descent, while the other assistant, who had proceeded to the further side of
  the chasm, threw the light of a lantern full upon the grisly load, which was
  thus shot into the gulf below.</p>

  <p>Shovelling a sufficient quantity of earth and lime into the pit to cover
  the bodies, Chowles and his companion departed, leaving Leonard alone. He
  continued there a few moments longer, and was about to follow them, when a
  prolonged and piercing cry smote his ear; and, looking in the direction of
  the sound, he perceived a figure running with great swiftness towards the
  pit. As no pursuers appeared, Leonard could scarcely doubt that this was one
  of the distracted persons he had heard of, who, in the frenzy produced by the
  intolerable anguish of their sores, would often rush to the plague-pit and
  bury themselves, and he therefore resolved, if possible, to prevent the fatal
  attempt. Accordingly, he placed himself in the way of the runner, and
  endeavoured, with outstretched arms, to stop him. But the latter dashed him
  aside with great violence, and hurrying to the brink of the pit, uttered a
  fearful cry, and exclaiming, "She is here! she is here!&mdash;I shall find
  her amongst them!"&mdash;flung himself into the abyss.</p>

  <p>As soon as he could shake off the horror inspired by this dreadful action,
  Leonard ran to the pit, and, gazing into it, beheld him by the imperfect
  light struggling in the horrible mass in which he was partially immersed. The
  frenzied man had now, however, begun to repent his rashness, and cried out
  for aid. But this Leonard found it impossible to afford him; and, seeing he
  must speedily perish if left to himself, he ran after the dead-cart, and
  overtaking it just as it reached Moor-gate, informed Chowles what had
  happened, and begged him to return.</p>

  <p>"There will be no use in helping him out," rejoined Chowles, in a tone of
  indifference. "We shall have to take him back in a couple of hours. No,
  no&mdash;let him remain where he is. There is scarcely a night that some
  crazy being does not destroy himself in the same way. We never concern
  ourselves about such persons except to strip them of their apparel."</p>

  <p>"Unfeeling wretch!" cried Leonard, unable to restrain his indignation.
  "Give me your fork, and I will pull him out myself."</p>

  <p>Instead of surrendering the implement, Chowles flourished it over his head
  with the intention of striking the apprentice, but the latter nimbly avoided
  the blow, and snatching it from his grasp, ran back to the plague-pit. He was
  followed by Chowles and the burier, who threatened him with loud oaths.
  Regardless of their menaces, Leonard fixed the hook in the dress of the
  struggling man, and exerting all his strength, drew him out of the abyss. He
  had just lodged him in safety on the brink when Chowles and his companion
  came up.</p>

  <p>"Keep off!" cried Leonard, brandishing his fork as he spoke; "you shall
  neither commit robbery nor murder here. If you will assist this unfortunate
  gentleman, I have no doubt you will be well rewarded. If not, get hence, or
  advance at your peril."</p>

  <p>"Well," returned Chowles, who began to fancy something might be made of
  the matter, "if you think we should be rewarded, we would convey the
  gentleman back to his own home provided we can ascertain where it is. But I
  am afraid he may die on the way."</p>

  <p>"In that case you can apply to his friends," rejoined Leonard. "He must
  not be abandoned thus."</p>

  <p>"First, let us know who he is," returned Chowles. "Is he able to
  speak?"</p>

  <p>"I know not," answered Leonard. "Bring the lantern this way, and let us
  examine his countenance."</p>

  <p>Chowles complied, and held the light over the unfortunate person. His
  attire was rich, but in great disorder, and sullied by the loathsome mass in
  which he had been plunged. He was in the flower of youth, and his features
  must have been remarkable for their grace and beauty, but they were now of a
  livid hue, and swollen and distorted by pain. Still Leonard recognised
  them.</p>

  <p>"Gracious Heaven!" he exclaimed. "It is Sir Paul Parravicin."</p>

  <p>"Sir Paul Parravicin!" echoed Chowles. "By all that's wonderful, so it is!
  Here is a lucky chance! Bring the dead-cart hither, Jonas&mdash;quick, quick!
  I shall put him under the care of Judith Malmayns."</p>

  <p>And the burier hurried off as fast as his legs could carry him.</p>

  <p>"Had I known who it was," exclaimed Leonard, gazing with abhorrence at the
  miserable object before him, "I would have left him to die the death he so
  richly merits!"</p>

  <p>A deep groan broke from the sufferer.</p>

  <p>"Have no fear, Sir Paul," said Chowles. "You are in good hands. Every care
  shall be taken of you, and you shall be cured by Judith Malmayns."</p>

  <p>"She shall not come near me," rejoined Parravicin, faintly. "You will take
  care of me?" he added in an imploring tone, to Leonard.</p>

  <p>"You appeal in vain to me," rejoined the apprentice, sternly. "You are
  justly punished for your treatment of Nizza Macascree."</p>

  <p>"I am&mdash;I am," groaned Parravicin, "but she will be speedily avenged.
  I shall soon join her in that pit."</p>

  <p>"She is not there," replied Leonard, bitterly, "She is fast recovering
  from the plague."</p>

  <p>"Is she not dead?" demanded Parravicin, with frightful eagerness. "I was
  told she was thrown into that horrible chasm."</p>

  <p>"You were deceived," replied Leonard. "She was taken to the pest-house by
  your orders, and would have perished if she had not found a friend to aid
  her. She is now out of danger."</p>

  <p>"Then I no longer desire to die," cried Parravicin, desperately. "I will
  live&mdash;live."</p>

  <p>"Do not delude yourself," replied Leonard, coldly; "you have little chance
  of recovery, and should employ the short time left you in praying to Heaven
  for forgiveness of your sins."</p>

  <p>"Tush!" exclaimed Parravicin, fiercely, "I shall not weary Heaven with
  ineffectual supplications. I well know I am past all forgiveness. No," he
  added, with a fearful imprecation, "since Nizza is alive, I will not
  die."</p>

  <p>"Right, Sir Paul, right," rejoined Chowles; "put a bold face on it, and I
  will answer for it you will get over the attack. Have no fear of Judith
  Malmayns," he added, in a significant tone. "However she may treat others,
  she will cure <i>you</i>."</p>

  <p>"I will make it worth her while to do so," rejoined Parravicin.</p>

  <p>"Here is the cart," cried Chowles, seeing the vehicle approach. "I will
  take you in the first place to Saint Paul's. Judith must see you as soon as
  possible."</p>

  <p>"Take me where you please," rejoined Parravicin, faintly; "and remember
  what I have said. If I die, the nurse will get nothing&mdash;if I am cured,
  she shall be proportionately rewarded."</p>

  <p>"I will not forget it," replied Chowles. And with the help of Jonas he
  placed the knight carefully in the cart. "You need not trouble yourself
  further about him," he added to Leonard.</p>

  <p>"Before be quits this place I must know who he is," rejoined the latter,
  placing himself at the horse's head.</p>

  <p>"You know his name as well as I do," replied Chowles.</p>

  <p>"Parravicin is not his real name," rejoined Leonard.</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" exclaimed Chowles, "this is news to me. But no matter who he is,
  he is rich enough to pay well. So stand aside, and let us go. We have no time
  to waste in further parleying."</p>

  <p>"I will not move till my question is answered," replied Leonard.</p>

  <p>"We will see to that," said Jonas, approaching him behind, and dealing him
  so severe a blow on the head that he stretched him senseless on the ground?
  "Shall we throw him into the pit?" he added to Chowles.</p>

  <p>The latter hesitated for a moment, and then said, "No, no, it is not worth
  while. It may bring us into trouble. We have no time to lose." And they then
  put the cart in motion, and took the way to Saint Paul's.</p>

  <p>On coming to himself, Leonard had some difficulty in recalling what had
  happened; and when the whole train of circumstances rushed upon his mind, he
  congratulated himself that he had escaped further injury. "When I think of
  the hands I have been placed in," he murmured, "I cannot but be grateful that
  they did not throw me into the pit, where no discovery could have been made
  as to how I came to an end. But I will not rest till I have ascertained the
  name and rank of Nizza's persecutor. I have no doubt they have taken him to
  Saint Paul's, and will proceed thither at once."</p>

  <p>With this view, he hastened towards the nearest city gate, and passing
  towards it, shaped his course towards the cathedral. It was a fine starlight
  night, and though there was no moon, the myriad lustres glowing in the deep
  and cloudless vault rendered every object plainly distinguishable. At this
  hour, little restraint was placed upon the sick, and they wandered about the
  streets uttering dismal cries. Some would fling themselves upon bulks or
  steps, where they were not unfrequently found the next morning bereft of
  life. Most of those not attacked by the distemper kept close house; but there
  were some few reckless beings who passed the night in the wildest revelry,
  braving the fate awaiting them. As Leonard passed Saint Michael's church, in
  Basinghall-street, he perceived, to his great surprise, that it was lighted
  up, and at first supposed some service was going on within it, but on
  approaching he heard strains of lively and most irreverent music issuing from
  within. Pushing open the door, he entered the sacred edifice, and found it
  occupied by a party of twenty young men, accompanied by a like number of
  females, some of whom were playing at dice and cards, some drinking, others
  singing Bacchanalian melodies, others dancing along the aisles to the notes
  of a theorbo and spinet. Leonard was so inexpressibly shocked by what he
  beheld, that unable to contain himself he mounted the steps of the pulpit,
  and called to them in a loud voice to desist from their scandalous conduct,
  and no longer profane the house of God. But they treated his remonstrances
  with laughter and derision, and some of the party forming themselves into a
  group round the pulpit, entreated him to preach to them.</p>

  <p>"We want a little variety," said one of the group, a good-looking young
  man, upon whom the wine had evidently made some impression&mdash;"we are
  tired of drinking and play, and may as well listen to a sermon, especially an
  original one. Hold forth to us, I say."</p>

  <p>"I would, hold forth till daybreak, if I thought it would produce any
  impression," returned Leonard. "But I perceive you are too hardened to be
  aroused to repentance."</p>

  <p>"Repentance!" cried another of the assemblage. "Do you know whom you
  address? These gentlemen are the Brotherhood of Saint Michael, and I am the
  principal. We are determined to enjoy the few days or hours we may have
  left&mdash;that is all. We are not afraid of the future, and are resolved to
  make the most of the present."</p>

  <p>"Ay, ay," cried the others, with a great shout of laughter, which,
  however, was interrupted by a cry of anguish from one of the party.</p>

  <p>"There is another person seized," said the principal; "take him away,
  brothers. This is owing to listening to a sermon. Let us return to our
  wine."</p>

  <p>"Will you not accept this awful warning?" cried Leonard. "You will all
  share your companion's fate."</p>

  <p>"We anticipate nothing else," returned the principal; "and are therefore
  resolved to banish reflection. A week ago, the Brotherhood of Saint Michael
  consisted of forty persons. We are already diminished to half the number, but
  are not the less merry on that account. On the contrary, we are more jovial
  than ever. We have agreed that whoever shall be seized with the distemper,
  shall be instantly conveyed to the pest-house, so that the hilarity of the
  others shall not be interrupted. The poor fellow who has just been attacked
  has left behind him a beautiful mistress. She is yours if you choose to join
  us."</p>

  <p>"Ay, stop with us," cried a young and very pretty woman, taking his hand
  and drawing him towards the company who were dancing beneath the aisles.</p>

  <p>But Leonard disengaged himself, and hurried away amid the laughter and
  hootings of the assemblage. The streets, despite their desolate appearance,
  were preferable to the spot he had just quitted, and he seemed to breathe
  more freely when he got to a little distance from the polluted fane. He had
  now entered Wood-street, but all was as still as death, and he paused to gaze
  up at his master's window, but there was no one at it. Many a lover, unable
  to behold the object of his affections, has in some measure satisfied the
  yearning of his heart by gazing at her dwelling, and feeling he was near her.
  Many a sad heart has been cheered by beholding a light at a window, or a
  shadow on its closed curtains, and such would have been Leonard's feelings if
  he had not been depressed by the thought of Amabel's precarious state of
  health.</p>

  <p>While thus wrapt in mournful thought, he observed three figures slowly
  approaching from the further end of the street, and he instinctively withdrew
  into a doorway. He had reason to congratulate himself upon the precaution,
  as, when the party drew nearer, he recognised, with a pang that shot to his
  heart, the voice of Rochester. A moment's observation from his place of
  concealment showed him that the earl was accompanied by Sir George Etherege
  and Pillichody. They paused within a short distance of him, and he could
  distinctly hear their conversation.</p>

  <p>"You have not yet told us why you brought us here my lord," said Etherege
  to Rochester, after the latter had gazed for a few moments in silence at the
  house. "Are you resolved to make another attempt to carry off the
  girl&mdash;and failing in it, to give her up for ever!"</p>

  <p>"You have guessed my purpose precisely," returned Rochester. "Doctor
  Hodges has informed a friend of mine that the pretty Amabel has fallen into a
  decline. The poor soul is, doubtless, pining for me; and it would be the
  height of inhumanity to let her perish."</p>

  <p>Leonard ground his teeth-with suppressed rage.</p>

  <p>"Then you mean to make her Countess of Rochester, after all," laughed
  Etherege. "I thought you had determined to carry off Mistress Mallett."</p>

  <p>"Old Bowley declares he will send me to the Tower if I do," replied
  Rochester; "and though his threats would scarcely deter me from acting as I
  think proper, I have no inclination for marriage at present. What a pity,
  Etherege, that one cannot in these affairs have the money oneself, and give
  the wife to one's friend."</p>

  <p>"That is easily accomplished," replied Etherege, laughingly; "especially
  where you have a friend so devoted as myself. But do you mean to carry off
  Amabel to-night?"</p>

  <p>"Ay, now we come to business," interposed Pillichody. "Bolts and
  barricadoes! your lordship has only to say the word, and I will break into
  the house, and bear her off for you."</p>

  <p>"Your former conduct is a good guarantee for your present success, truly,"
  returned Rochester, with a sneer. "No, no; I shall postpone my design for the
  present. I have ascertained, from the source whence I obtained information of
  Amabel's illness, that she is to be removed into the country. This will
  exactly suit my purpose, and put her completely in my power."</p>

  <p>"Then nothing is to be done to-night?" said Pillichody, secretly
  congratulating himself on his escape. "By my sword! I feel equal to the most
  desperate attempt."</p>

  <p>"Your courage and dexterity must be reserved for some more favourable
  occasion," replied Rochester.</p>

  <p>"If not to carry off the girl, I must again inquire why your lordship has
  come hither?" demanded Etherege.</p>

  <p>"To be frank with you, my sole motive was to gaze at the house that
  contains her," replied Rochester, in a voice that bespoke his sincerity. "I
  have before told you that she has a strong hold upon my heart. I have not
  seen her for some weeks, and during that time have endeavoured to obliterate
  her image by making love to a dozen others. But it will not do. She still
  continues absolute mistress of my affections. I sometimes think, if I can
  obtain her in no other way, I shall be rash enough to marry her."</p>

  <p>"Pshaw! this must never be," said Etherege.</p>

  <p>"Were I to lose her altogether, I should be inconsolable," cried
  Rochester.</p>

  <p>"As inconsolable as I am for the rich widow of Watling-street, who died a
  fortnight ago of the plague, and left her wealth to her footman," replied
  Pillichody, drawing forth his handkerchief and applying it to his
  eyes&mdash;"oh! oh!"</p>

  <p>"Silence, fool!" cried Rochester: "I am in no mood for buffoonery. If you
  shed tears for any one, it should be for your master."</p>

  <p>"Truly, I am grieved for him," replied Pillichody; "but I object to the
  term 'master.' Sir Paul Parravicin, as he chooses to be called, is my patron,
  not my master. He permits me a very close familiarity, not to say
  friendship."</p>

  <p>"Well, then, your patron," rejoined Rochester, scornfully. "How is he
  going on to-night?"</p>

  <p>"I feared to tell your lordship," replied Pillichody, "lest it should
  spoil your mirth; but he broke out of his chamber a few hours ago, and has
  not been discovered since. Most likely, he will be found in the plague-pit or
  the Thames in the morning, for he was in such an infuriated state, that it is
  the opinion of his attendants he would certainly destroy himself. You know he
  was attacked two days after Nizza Macascree was seized by the pestilence, and
  his brain has been running upon the poor girl ever since."</p>

  <p>"Alas!" exclaimed Rochester, "it is a sad end. I am wearied of this
  infected city, and shall be heartily glad to quit it. A few months in the
  country with Amabel will be enchanting."</p>

  <p>"<i>Apropos</i> of melancholy subjects," said Etherege, "your masque of
  the Dance of Death has caused great consternation at court. Mistress Stewart
  declares she cannot get that strange fellow who performed such fantastic
  tricks in the skeleton-dance out of her head."</p>

  <p>"You mean Chowles," replied the earl. "He is a singular being,
  certainly&mdash;once a coffin-maker, and now, I believe, a burier of the
  dead. He takes up his abode in a crypt of Saint Faith's and leads an
  incomprehensible life. As we return we shall pass the cathedral, and can see
  whether he is astir."</p>

  <p>"Readily," replied Etherege. "Do you desire to tarry here longer, or shall
  we proceed before you, while you indulge your tender meditations
  undisturbed?"</p>

  <p>"Leave me," replied Rochester; "I shall be glad to be alone for a few
  moments."</p>

  <p>Etherege and Pillichody then proceeded slowly towards Cheapside, while the
  earl remained with his arms folded upon his breast, and his gaze fixed upon
  the house. Leonard watched him with intense curiosity, and had great
  difficulty in controlling himself. Though the earl was armed, while he had
  only his staff, he could have easily mastered him by assailing him unawares.
  But Leonard's generous nature revolted at the unworthy suggestion, and he
  resolved, if he attacked him at all, to give him time to stand upon his
  guard. A moment's reflection, however, satisfied him that his wisest course
  would be to remain concealed. He was now in possession of the earl's plan,
  and, with the help of Doctor Hodges, could easily defeat it; whereas if he
  appeared, it would be evident that he had overheard what had passed, and some
  other scheme, to which he could not be privy, would be necessarily adopted.
  Influenced by this consideration, he suffered the earl to depart unmolested,
  and when he had got to some distance followed him. Rochester's companions
  were waiting for him in Cheapside, and, joining them, they all three
  proceeded towards the cathedral. They entered the great northern door; and
  Leonard, who was now well acquainted with all the approaches, passed through
  the door at the north side of the choir, to which he had been directed on a
  former occasion by Solomon Eagle. He found the party guided by the old
  verger&mdash;the only one of its former keepers who still lingered about the
  place&mdash;and preparing to descend to Saint Faith's. Leonard followed as
  near as he could without exposing himself, and, on gaining the subterranean
  church, easily contrived to screen himself behind the ponderous ranks of
  pillars.</p>

  <p>By this time they had reached the door of the charnel It was closed; but
  Rochester knocked against it, and Chowles presently appeared. He seemed
  greatly surprised at seeing the earl, nor was the latter less astonished when
  he learnt that Parravicin was within the vault. He desired to be shown to his
  friend, and Chowles ushered him into the crypt. Leonard would have followed
  them; but as Etherege and the others declined entering the charnel, and
  remained at the door, he could not do so.</p>

  <p>Shortly after this the sick man was brought out, stretched upon a pallet,
  borne by Chowles and Judith; and the party proceeded slowly, and occasionally
  relieving each other, to the great western entrance, where a coach being
  procured by Pillichody, Parravicin was placed within it, with Judith and
  Chowles; and orders being given in an under-tone to the driver, he departed.
  The others then proceeded towards Ludgate, while Leonard, again disappointed,
  retraced his steps to Wood-street.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch3-5"
     name="ch3-5">V. &mdash; HOW SAINT PATHOS WAS USED AS A
     PEST-HOUSE.</a></h2>

  <p>The distemper had by this time increased to such a frightful extent, that
  the pest-houses being found wholly inadequate to contain the number of sick
  persons sent to them, it was resolved by the civic authorities, who had
  obtained the sanction of the Dean and Chapter of Saint Paul's for that
  purpose, to convert the cathedral into a receptacle for the infected.
  Accordingly, a meeting was held in the Convocation House to make final
  arrangements. It was attended by Sir John Lawrence, the Lord Mayor; by Sir
  George Waterman, and Sir Charles Doe, sheriffs; by Doctor Sheldon, Archbishop
  of Canterbury; by the Duke of Albemarle, the Earl of Craven, and, a few other
  zealous and humane persons. Several members of the College of Physicians were
  likewise present, and, amongst others, Doctor Hodges; and the expediency of
  the measure being fully agreed upon, it was determined to carry it into
  immediate execution.</p>

<p><a id="pic5"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p>
<br>
<div align="center">
    <img src="fr100259-images/OldStPauls-05.jpg"
         alt="Illustration"
       title="Illustration">
    <p class="caption">The Plague Pit</p>
</div>

  <p>The cloisters surrounding the Convocation House were crowded with sick
  persons, drawn thither by the rumour of what was going forward; and when the
  meeting adjourned to the cathedral, these unfortunate beings followed them,
  and were with some difficulty kept aloof from the uninfected by the
  attendants. A very earnest and touching address was next pronounced by the
  archbishop. Calling upon his hearers to look upon themselves as already dead
  to the world,&mdash;to regard the present visitation as a just punishment of
  their sins, and to rejoice that their sufferings would be so soon terminated,
  when, if they sincerely and heartily repented, they would at once be
  transported from the depths of wretchedness and misery to regions of unfading
  bliss; he concluded by stating that he, and all those around him, were
  prepared to devote themselves, without regard to their own safety, to the
  preservation of their fellow-citizens, and that they would leave nothing
  undone to stop the ravages of the devouring scourge.</p>

  <p>It chanced that Leonard Holt was present on this occasion, and as he
  listened to the eloquent discourse of the archbishop, and gazed at the group
  around him, all equally zealous in the good cause, and equally regardless of
  themselves, he could not but indulge a hope that their exertions might be
  crowned with success. It was indeed a touching sight to see the melancholy
  congregation to whom his address was delivered&mdash;many, nay most of whom
  were on the verge of dissolution;&mdash;and Leonard Holt was so moved by the
  almost apostolic fervour of the prelate, that, but for the thought of Amabel,
  he might have followed the example of several of the auditors, and devoted
  himself altogether to the service of the sick.</p>

  <p>His discourse concluded, the archbishop and most of his companions quitted
  the cathedral. Hodges, however, and three of the physicians, remained behind
  to superintend the necessary preparations. Shortly after, a large number of
  pallets were brought in, and ranged along the nave and aisles at short
  distances from each other; and, before night, the interior of the structure
  presented the complete appearance of an hospital. Acting under the directions
  of Doctor Hodges, Leonard Holt lent his assistance in arranging the pallets,
  in covering them with bedding and blankets, and in executing any other
  service required of him. A sufficient number of chirurgeons and nurses were
  then sent for, and such was the expedition used, that on that very night most
  of the pallets were occupied. Thus the cathedral underwent another afflicting
  change. A blight had come over it, mildewing its holy walls, and tainting and
  polluting its altars. Its aisles, once trodden by grave and reverend
  ecclesiastics, and subsequently haunted by rufflers, bullies, and other
  worthless characters, were now filled with miserable wretches, stricken with
  a loathsome and fatal distemper. Its chapels and shrines formerly adorned
  with rich sculptures and costly ornaments, but stripped of them at times when
  they were looked upon as idolatrous and profane, were now occupied by nurses,
  chirurgeons, and their attendants; while every niche and corner was filled
  with surgical implements, phials, drugs, poultices, foul rags, and linen.</p>

  <p>In less than a week after it had been converted into a pest-house, the
  cathedral was crowded to overflowing. Upwards of three hundred pallets were
  set up in the nave, in the aisles, in the transepts, and in the choir, and
  even in the chapels. But these proving insufficient, many poor wretches who
  were brought thither were placed on the cold flags, and protected only by a
  single blanket. At night the scene was really terrific. The imperfect light
  borne by the attendants fell on the couches, and revealed the livid
  countenances of their occupants; while the vaulted roof rang with shrieks and
  groans so horrible and heart-piercing as to be scarcely endured, except by
  those whose nerves were firmly strung, or had become blunted by their
  constant recurrence. At such times, too, some unhappy creature, frenzied by
  agony, would burst from his couch, and rend the air with his cries, until
  overtaken and overpowered by his attendants. On one occasion, it happened
  that a poor wretch, who had been thus caught, broke loose a second time, and
  darting through a door leading to the stone staircase in the northern
  transept gained the ambulatory, and being closely followed, to escape his
  pursuers, sprang through one of the arched openings, and falling from a
  height of near sixty feet, was dashed in pieces on the flagged floor
  beneath.</p>

  <p>A walk through this mighty lazar-house would have furnished a wholesome
  lesson to the most reckless observer. It seemed to contain all the sick of
  the city. And yet it was not so. Hundreds were expiring in their own
  dwellings, and the other pest-houses continued crowded as before. Still, as a
  far greater number of the infected were here congregated, and could be seen
  at one view, the picture was incomparably more impressive. Every part of the
  cathedral was occupied. Those who could not find room inside it crouched
  beneath the columns of the portico on rugs or blankets, and implored the
  chirurgeons as they passed to attend them. Want of room also drove others
  into Saint Faith's, and here the scene was, if possible, more hideous. In
  this dismal region it was found impossible to obtain a free circulation of
  air, and consequently the pestilential effluvia, unable to escape, acquired
  such malignancy, that it was almost certain destruction to inhale it. After a
  time, few of the nurses and attendants would venture thither; and to take a
  patient to Saint Faith's was considered tantamount to consigning him to the
  grave.</p>

  <p>Whether Judith Malmayns had succeeded or not in curing Sir Paul
  Parravicin, it is not our present purpose to relate. Soon after the cathedral
  was converted into a lazar-house she returned thither, and, in spite of the
  opposition of Doctor Hodges, was appointed one of the nurses. It must not be
  supposed that her appointment was the result of any ill design. Such was the
  difficulty of obtaining attendance, that little choice was left, and the
  nurses being all of questionable character, it was supposed she was only a
  shade worse than her fellows, while she was known to be active and
  courageous. And this was speedily proved; for when Saint Faith's was deserted
  by the others, she remained at her post, and quitted it neither night nor
  day. A large pit was digged in the open space at the north-east corner of the
  cathedral, and to this great numbers of bodies were nightly conveyed by
  Chowles and Jonas. But it was soon filled, and they were compelled to resort,
  as before, to Finsbury Fields, and to another vast pit near Aldgate. When not
  engaged in this revolting employment, Chowles took up his quarters in the
  crypt, where, in spite of his propinquity to the sick, he indulged himself in
  his customary revelry. He and Judith had amassed, in one way or other, a vast
  quantity of spoil, and frequently planned how they would spend it when the
  pestilence ceased. Their treasure was carefully concealed in a cell in one of
  the secret passages with which they were acquainted, leading from Saint
  Faith's to the upper structure.</p>

  <p>One night, on his return from Finsbury Fields, as Chowles was seated in
  the crypt, with a pipe in his mouth, and a half-finished flask of wine before
  him, he was startled by the sudden entrance of Judith, who, rushing up to
  him, seized him by the throat, and almost choked him before he could
  extricate himself.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter?&mdash;would you strangle me, you murderous harridan?"
  he cried.</p>

  <p>"Ay, that I would," replied Judith, preparing to renew the attack.</p>

  <p>"Stand off!" rejoined Chowles, springing back, and snatching up a spade,
  "or I will dash out your brains. Are you mad?" he continued, gazing fearfully
  at her.</p>

  <p>"I am angry enough to make me so," she replied, shaking her clenched fists
  at him. "But I will be revenged&mdash;revenged, I tell you."</p>

  <p>"Revenged!" cried Chowles, in astonishment&mdash;"for what! What have I
  done!"</p>

  <p>"You do well to affect ignorance," rejoined Judith, "but you cannot
  deceive me. No one but you can have done it."</p>

  <p>"Done what!" exclaimed Chowles, in increased astonishment. "Has our hoard
  been discovered?"</p>

  <p>"Ay, and been carried off&mdash;by you&mdash;you!" screamed Judith, with a
  look worthy of a fury.</p>

  <p>"By my soul, you are wrong," cried Chowles. "I have never touched
  it,&mdash;never even approached the hiding-place, except in your
  presence."</p>

  <p>"Liar!" returned Judith, "the whole hoard is gone;&mdash;the plunder I
  obtained in Newgate,&mdash;the Earl of Rochester's plate,&mdash;all the
  rings, trinkets, and rich apparel I have picked up since,&mdash;everything is
  gone;&mdash;and who but you can be the robber?"</p>

  <p>"It is difficult to say," rejoined Chowles. "But I swear to you, you
  suspect me wrongfully."</p>

  <p>"Restore it," replied Judith, "or tell me where it is hidden. If not, I
  will be the death of you?"</p>

  <p>"Let us go to the hiding-place," replied Chowles, whose uneasiness was not
  diminished by the menace. "You may be mistaken, and I hope you are."</p>

  <p>Though he uttered the latter part of his speech with seeming confidence,
  his heart misgave him. To conceal his trepidation, he snatched up a lamp, and
  passing through the secret door, hurried along the narrow stone passage. He
  was about to open the cell, when he perceived near it the tall figure of the
  enthusiast.</p>

  <p>"There is the robber," he cried to Judith. "I have found him. It is
  Solomon Eagle. Villain! you have purloined our hoard!"</p>

  <p>"I have done so," replied Solomon Eagle, "and I will carry off all other
  spoil you may obtain. Think not to hide it from me. I can watch you when you
  see me not, and track you when you suppose me afar off."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" exclaimed Chowles, trembling. "I begin to think he is possessed
  of supernatural power," he added, in an undertone to Judith.</p>

  <p>"Go on," pursued Solomon Eagle, "continue to plunder and destroy. Pursue
  your guilty career, and see what reward you will reap."</p>

  <p>"Restore what you have robbed us of," cried Judith in a menacing tone, "or
  dread the consequences."</p>

  <p>"Woman, you threaten idly," returned Solomon Eagle. "Your ill-gotten
  treasure is gone&mdash;whither, you will never know. Get hence!" he added, in
  a terrible tone, "or I will rid the earth of you both."</p>

  <p>So awed were they by his voice and gestures, that they slunk away with a
  discomfited air, and returned to the crypt.</p>

  <p>"If we are always to be robbed in this manner," observed Chowles, "we had
  better shift our quarters, and practise elsewhere."</p>

  <p>"He shall not repeat the offence with impunity," returned Judith. "I will
  speedily get rid of him."</p>

  <p>"Beware!" cried a voice, which they recognised as that of Solomon Eagle,
  though whence proceeding they could not precisely determine. The pair looked
  at each other uneasily, but neither spoke a word.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Leonard Holt did not omit to pay a daily visit to the
  cathedral. It was a painful contemplation, and yet not without deep interest,
  to behold the constant succession of patients, most of whom were swept away
  by the scourge in the course of a couple of days, or even in a shorter
  period. Out of every hundred persons attacked, five did not recover; and
  whether the virulence of the distemper increased, or the summer heats
  rendered its victims more easily assailable, certain it is they were carried
  off far more expeditiously than before. Doctor Hodges was unremitting in his
  attentions, but his zeal and anxiety availed nothing. He had to contend with
  a disease over which medicine exercised little control.</p>

  <p>One morning, as he was about to enter the cathedral, he met Leonard
  beneath the portico, and as soon as the latter caught sight of him, he
  hurried towards him.</p>

  <p>"I have been in search of you," he said, "and was about to proceed to your
  residence. Mr. Bloundel wishes to see you immediately. Amabel is worse."</p>

  <p>"I will go with you at once," replied the doctor.</p>

  <p>And they took the way to Wood-street.</p>

  <p>"From a few words let fall by my master, I imagine he intends sending
  Amabel into the country to-morrow," said Leonard, as they proceeded.</p>

  <p>"I hope so," replied Hodges. "He has already delayed it too long. You will
  be glad to hear that Nizza Macascree is quite recovered. To-morrow, or the
  next day, she will be able to see you with safety."</p>

  <p>"Heaven knows where I may be to-morrow," rejoined Leonard. "Wherever
  Amabel goes, I shall not be far off."</p>

  <p>"Faithful to the last!" exclaimed Hodges. "Well, I shall not oppose you.
  We must take care the Earl of Rochester does not get a hint of our
  proceeding. At this time a chance meeting (were it nothing more) might prove
  fatal to the object of our solicitude."</p>

  <p>Leonard said nothing, but the colour fled his cheek, and his lips slightly
  quivered. In a few seconds more they reached the grocer's house.</p>

  <p>They found him at the window anxiously expecting them; and Doctor Hodges,
  being drawn up in the same way as before, was conducted to Amabel's chamber.
  She was reclining in an easy-chair, with the Bible on her knee; and though
  she was much wasted away, she looked more lovely than ever. A slight hectic
  flush increased the brilliancy of her eyes, which had now acquired that
  ominous lustre peculiar to persons in a decline. There were other distressing
  symptoms in her appearance which the skilful physician well knew how to
  interpret. To an inexperienced eye, however, she would have appeared
  charming. Nothing could exceed the delicacy of her complexion, or the lovely
  mould of her features, which, though they had lost much of their fulness and
  roundness, had gained in expression; while the pencilled brows clearly traced
  upon her snowy forehead, the long dark eyelashes shading her cheek, and the
  rich satin tresses drooping over her shoulders, completed her attractions.
  Her mother stood by her side, and not far from her sat little Christiana,
  amusing herself with some childish toy, and ever and anon stealing an anxious
  glance at her sister. Taking Amabel's arm, and sighing to himself to think
  how thin it was, the doctor placed his finger upon her pulse. Whatever might
  be his secret opinion, he thought fit to assume a hopeful manner, and looking
  smilingly at her, said, "You are better than I expected, but your departure
  to the country must not be deferred."</p>

  <p>"Since it is my father's wish that I should do so," replied Amabel,
  gently, "I am quite willing to comply. But I feel it will be of no avail, and
  I would rather pass the rest of my life here than with strangers. I cannot be
  happier than I am now."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not," replied Hodges; "but a few weeks spent in some salubrious
  spot will remove all apprehensions as to your health. You will find your
  strength return, and with it the desire of life."</p>

  <p>"My life is in the hands of my Maker," replied Amabel, "and I am ready to
  resign it whenever it shall be required of me. At the same time, however
  anxious I may be to quit a world which appears a blank to me, I would make
  every effort, for the sake of those whose happiness is dearer to me than my
  own, to purchase a complete restoration to health. If my father desires me to
  try a removal to the country, and you think it will have a beneficial effect,
  I am ready to go. But do not urge it, unless you think there is a chance of
  my recovery."</p>

  <p>"I will tell you frankly," replied the doctor, "if you remain here, you
  have not many weeks to live."</p>

  <p>"But if I go, will you promise me health?" rejoined Amabel. "Do not
  deceive me. Is there a hope?"</p>

  <p>"Unquestionably," replied the doctor. "Change of air will work
  wonders."</p>

  <p>"I beseech you not to hesitate&mdash;for my sake do not, dearest
  daughter," said Mrs. Bloundel, with difficulty repressing tears.</p>

  <p>"And for mine," added her father, more firmly, yet with deep emotion.</p>

  <p>"I have already expressed my readiness to accede to your wishes," replied
  Amabel. "Whenever you have made arrangements for me, I will set out."</p>

  <p>"And now comes the question&mdash;where is she to go?" remarked
  Hodges.</p>

  <p>"I have a sister, who lives as housekeeper at Lord Craven's seat, Ashdown
  Park," replied Mr. Bloundel. "She shall go thither, and her aunt will take
  every care of her. The mansion is situated amid the Berkshire hills, and the
  air is the purest and best in England."</p>

  <p>"Nothing can be better," replied Hodges; "but who is to escort her
  thither?"</p>

  <p>"Leonard Holt," replied Mr. Bloundel. "He will gladly undertake the
  office."</p>

  <p>"No doubt," rejoined Hodges; "but cannot you go yourself?"</p>

  <p>"Impossible!" returned the grocer, a shade passing over his
  countenance.</p>

  <p>"Neither do I wish it," observed Amabel. "I am content to be under the
  safeguard of Leonard."</p>

  <p>"Amabel," said her father, "you know not what I shall endure in thus
  parting with you. I would give all I possess to be able to accompany you, but
  a sense of duty restrains me. I have taken the resolution to remain here with
  my family during the continuance of the pestilence, and I must abide by it. I
  little thought how severely my constancy would be tried. But hard though it
  be, I must submit I shall commit you, therefore, to the care of an
  all-merciful Providence, who will not fail to watch over and protect
  you."</p>

  <p>"Have no fear for me, father," replied Amabel; "and do not weep, dear
  mother," she added to Mrs. Bloundel, who, unable to restrain her grief, was
  now drowned in tears; "I shall be well cared for. If we meet no more in this
  world, our reunion is certain in that to come. I have given you much pain and
  uneasiness, but it will be an additional grief to me if I think you feel
  further anxiety on my account."</p>

  <p>"We do not, my dear child," replied Mr. Bloundel. "I am well assured all
  is for the best, and if it pleases Heaven to spare you, I shall rejoice
  beyond measure in your return. If not, I shall feel a firm reliance that you
  will continue in the same happy frame, as at present, to the last, and that
  we shall meet above, where there will be no further separation."</p>

  <p>"I cannot bear to part with her," cried Mrs. Bloundel, clasping her arms
  round her daughter&mdash;"I cannot&mdash;I cannot!"</p>

  <p>"Restrain yourself, Honora," said her husband; "you will do her an
  injury."</p>

  <p>"She must not be over excited," interposed Hodges, in a low tone, and
  gently drawing the afflicted mother away. "The sooner," he added to Mr.
  Bloundel, "she now sets out the better."</p>

  <p>"I feel it," replied the grocer. "She shall start to-morrow morning."</p>

  <p>"I will undertake to procure horses," replied Hodges, "and Leonard will be
  ready at any moment."</p>

  <p>With this, he took his leave, and descending by the pulley, communicated
  to Leonard what had occurred.</p>

  <p>In spite of his fears on her account, the prospect of again beholding
  Amabel so transported the apprentice that he could scarcely attend to what
  was said respecting her. When he grew calmer, it was arranged that all should
  be in readiness at an early hour on the following morning; that a couple of
  horses should be provided; and that Amabel should be let down fully equipped
  for the journey. This settled, Leonard, at the doctor's request, accompanied
  him to his residence.</p>

  <p>They were scarcely out of sight, when a man, who had been concealed behind
  the hutch, in such a position that not a word that had passed escaped him,
  issued from his hiding-place, and darting down the first alley on the right,
  made the best of his way to Whitehall.</p>

  <p>Up to this time, Doctor Hodges had not judged it prudent to allow a
  meeting between Leonard and Nizza Macascree, but now, from reasons of his
  own, he resolved no longer to delay it. Accordingly, on reaching his
  dwelling, he took the apprentice to her chamber. She was standing in a
  pensive attitude, near a window which looked towards the river, and as she
  turned on his entrance, Leonard perceived that her eyes were filled with
  tears. Blushing deeply, she advanced towards him, and greeted him with all
  the warmth of her affectionate nature. She had quite recovered her good
  looks, and Leonard could not but admit that, had he seen her before his heart
  was plighted to another, it must have been given to her. Comparisons are
  ungracious, and tastes differ more perhaps as to beauty than on any other
  point; but if Amabel and the piper's daughter had been placed together, it
  would not have been difficult to determine to which of the two the palm of
  superior loveliness should be assigned. There was a witchery in the
  magnificent black eyes of the latter&mdash;in her exquisitely-formed mouth
  and pearly teeth&mdash;in her clear nut-brown complexion&mdash;in her dusky
  and luxuriant tresses, and in her light elastic figure, with which more
  perfect but less piquant charms could not compete. Such seemed to be the
  opinion of Doctor Hodges, for as he gazed at her with unaffected admiration,
  he exclaimed, as if to himself&mdash; "I'faith, if I had to choose between
  the two, I know which it would be."</p>

  <p>This exclamation somewhat disconcerted the parties to whom it referred,
  and the doctor did not relieve their embarrassment by adding, "Well, I
  perceive I am in the way. You must have much to say to each other that can in
  nowise interest me. Excuse me a moment, while I see that the horses are
  ordered."</p>

  <p>So saying, and disregarding Leonard's expostulating looks, he hurried out
  of the room, and shut the door after him.</p>

  <p>Hitherto, the conversation had been unrestrained and agreeable on both
  sides, but now they were left alone together, neither appeared able to utter
  a word. Nizza cast her eyes timidly on the ground, while Leonard caressed
  little Bell, who had been vainly endeavouring by her gamesome tricks to win
  his attention.</p>

  <p>"Doctor Hodges spoke of ordering horses," said Nizza, at length breaking
  silence. "Are you going on a journey?"</p>

  <p>"I am about to take Amabel to Ashdown Park, in Berkshire, to-morrow
  morning," replied Leonard. "She is dangerously ill."</p>

  <p>"Of the plague?" asked Nizza, anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Of a yet worse disorder," replied Leonard, heaving a deep sigh&mdash;"of
  a broken heart."</p>

  <p>"Alas! I pity her from my soul!" replied Nizza, in a tone of the deepest
  commiseration. "Does her mother go with her?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Leonard, "I alone shall attend her. She will be placed under
  the care of a near female relative at Ashdown."</p>

  <p>"Would it not be better,&mdash;would it not be safer, if she is in the
  precarious state you describe, that some one of her own sex should accompany
  her?" said Nizza.</p>

  <p>"I should greatly prefer it," rejoined Leonard, "and so I am sure would
  Amabel. But where is such a person to be found?"</p>

  <p>"I will go with you, if you desire it," replied Nizza, "and will watch
  over her, and tend her as a sister."</p>

  <p>"Are you equal to the journey?" inquired Leonard, somewhat doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"Fully," replied Nizza. "I am entirely recovered, and able to undergo far
  more fatigues than an invalid like Amabel."</p>

  <p>"It will relieve me from a world of anxiety if this can be accomplished,"
  rejoined Leonard. "I will consult Doctor Hodges on the subject on his
  return."</p>

  <p>"What do you desire to consult me about?" cried the physician, who had
  entered the room unobserved at this juncture.</p>

  <p>The apprentice stated Nizza's proposal to him.</p>

  <p>"I entirely approve of the plan," observed the doctor; "it will obviate
  many difficulties. I have just received a message from Mr. Bloundel, by
  Dallison, the porter, to say he intends sending Blaize with you. I will
  therefore provide pillions for the horses, so that the whole party can be
  accommodated."</p>

  <p>He then sat down and wrote out minute instructions for Amabel's treatment,
  and delivering the paper to Leonard, desired him to give it to the
  housekeeper at Ashdown Park.</p>

  <p>"Heaven only knows what the result of all this may be!" he exclaimed. "But
  nothing must be neglected."</p>

  <p>Leonard promised that his advice should be scrupulously attended to; and
  the discourse then turning to Nizza's father, she expressed the utmost
  anxiety to see him before she set out.</p>

  <p>Hodges readily assented. "Your father has been discharged as cured from
  the pest-house," he said, "and is lodged at a cottage, kept by my old nurse,
  Dame Lucas, just without the walls, near Moorgate. I will send for him."</p>

  <p>"On no account," replied Nizza. "I will go to him myself."</p>

  <p>"As you please," returned Hodges. "Leonard shall accompany you. You will
  easily find the cottage. It is about two hundred yards beyond the gate, on
  the right, near the old doghouses."</p>

  <p>"I know the spot perfectly," rejoined Leonard.</p>

  <p>"I would recommend you to put on a mask," observed the doctor to Nizza;
  "it may protect you from molestation. I will find you one below."</p>

  <p>Leading the way to a lower room, he opened a drawer, and, producing a
  small loo mask, gave it her. The youthful pair then quitted the house, Nizza
  taking Bell under her arm, as she intended leaving her with her father. The
  necessity of the doctor's caution was speedily manifested, for as they
  crossed Saint Paul's churchyard they encountered Pillichody, who, glancing
  inquisitively at Nizza, seemed disposed to push his inquiries further by
  attempting to take off her mask; but the fierce look of the apprentice, who
  grasped his staff in a menacing manner, induced him to abandon his purpose.
  He, however, followed them along Cheapside, and would have continued the
  pursuit along the Old Jewry, if Leonard had not come to a halt, and awaited
  his approach. He then took to his heels, and did not again make his
  appearance.</p>

  <p>As they reached the open fields and slackened their pace, Leonard deemed
  it prudent to prepare his companion for her interview with her father by
  mentioning the circumstance of the packet, and the important secret which he
  had stated he had to disclose to her.</p>

  <p>"I cannot tell what the secret can relate to, unless it is to my mother,"
  rejoined Nizza. "She died, I believe, when I was an infant. At all events, I
  never remember seeing her, and I have remarked that my father is averse to
  talking about her. But I will now question him. I have reason to think this
  piece of gold," and she produced the amulet, "is in some way or other
  connected with the mystery."</p>

  <p>And she then explained to Leonard all that had occurred in the vault when
  the coin had been shown to Judith Malmayns, describing the nurse's singular
  look and her father's subsequent anger.</p>

  <p>By this time, they had entered a narrow footpath leading across the fields
  in the direction of a little nest of cottages, and pursuing it, they came to
  a garden-gate. Opening it, they beheld the piper seated beneath a little
  porch covered with eglantine and roses. He was playing a few notes on his
  pipe, but stopped on hearing their approach. Bell, who had been put to the
  ground by Nizza, ran barking gleefully towards him. Uttering a joyful
  exclamation, the piper stretched out his arms, and the next moment enfolded
  his daughter in a strict embrace. Leonard remained at the gate till the first
  transports of their meeting were over, and then advanced slowly towards
  them.</p>

  <p>"Whose footsteps are those?" inquired the piper.</p>

  <p>Nizza explained.</p>

  <p>"Ah, is it Leonard Holt?" exclaimed the piper, extending his hand to the
  apprentice. "You are heartily welcome," he added; "and I am glad to find you
  with Nizza. It is no secret to me that she likes you. She has been an
  excellent daughter, and will make an excellent wife. He who weds her will
  obtain a greater treasure than he expects."</p>

  <p>"Not than he expects," said Leonard.</p>

  <p>"Ay, than he expects," reiterated the piper. "You will one day find out
  that I speak the truth."</p>

  <p>Leonard looked at Nizza, who was blushing deeply at her father's remark.
  She understood him.</p>

  <p>"Father," she said, "I understand you have a secret of importance to
  disclose to me. I am about to make a long journey to-morrow, and may not
  return for some time. At this uncertain season, when those who part know not
  that they shall meet again, nothing of this sort ought to be withheld."</p>

  <p>"You cannot know it while I live," replied the piper, "but I will take
  such precautions that, if anything happens to me, it shall be certainly
  revealed to you."</p>

  <p>"I am satisfied," she rejoined, "and will only ask you one farther
  question, and I beseech you to answer it. Does this amulet refer to the
  secret?"</p>

  <p>"It does," replied her father, sullenly; "and now let the subject be
  dropped."</p>

  <p>He then led the way into the cottage. The good old dame who kept it, on
  learning who they were, and that they were sent by Doctor Hodges, gave them a
  hearty welcome, and placed refreshments before them. Leonard commented upon
  the extreme neatness of the abode and its healthful situation, and expressed
  a hope that it might not be visited by the plague.</p>

  <p>"I trust it will not," rejoined the old woman, shaking her head; "but when
  I hear the doleful bell at night&mdash;when I catch a glimpse of the fatal
  cart&mdash;or look towards yon dreadful place," and she pointed in the
  direction of the plague-pit, which lay only a few hundred yards to the west
  of her habitation&mdash;"I am reminded that the scourge is not far off, and
  that it must needs reach me ere long."</p>

  <p>"Have no fear, Dame Lucas," said the piper; "you see it has pleased a
  merciful Providence to spare the lives of myself, my child, and this young
  man, and if you should be attacked, the same benificent Being may preserve
  you in like manner."</p>

  <p>"The Lord's will be done!" rejoined Dame Lucas. "I know I shall be well
  attended to by Doctor Hodges. I nursed him when he was an infant, and he has
  been like a son to me. Bless his kind heart!" she exclaimed, her eyes filling
  with tears of gratitude, "there is not his like in London."</p>

  <p>"Always excepting my master," observed Leonard, with a smile at her
  enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>"I except no one," rejoined Dame Lucas. "A worthier man never lived, than
  Doctor Hodges. If I die of the plague," she continued, "he has promised not
  to let me be thrown into that horrible pit&mdash;ough!&mdash;but to bury me
  in my garden, beneath the old apple-tree."</p>

  <p>"And he will keep his word, dame, I am sure," replied Leonard. "I would
  recommend you, however, as the best antidote against the plague, to keep
  yourself constantly employed, and to indulge as few gloomy notions as
  possible."</p>

  <p>"I am seldom melancholy, and still more seldom idle," replied the good
  dame. "But despondency will steal on me sometimes, especially when the
  dead-cart passes and I think what it contains."</p>

  <p>While the conversation was going forward, Nizza and the piper withdrew
  into an inner room, where they remained closeted together for some time. On
  their re-appearance, Nizza said she was ready to depart, and taking an
  affectionate farewell of her father, and committing Bell to his charge, she
  quitted the cottage with the apprentice.</p>

  <p>Evening was now advancing, and the sun was setting with the gorgeousness
  already described as peculiar to this fatal period. Filled with the pleasing
  melancholy inspired by the hour, they walked on in silence. They had not
  proceeded far, when they observed a man crossing the field with a bundle in
  his arms. Suddenly, he staggered and fell. Seeing he did not stir, and
  guessing what was the matter, Leonard ran towards him to offer him
  assistance. He found him lying in the grass with his left hand fixed against
  his heart. He groaned heavily, and his features were convulsed with pain.
  Near him lay the body of a beautiful little girl, with long fair hair, and
  finely-formed features, though now disfigured by purple blotches, proclaiming
  the disorder of which she had perished. She was apparently about ten years
  old, and was partially covered by a linen cloth. The man, whose features bore
  a marked resemblance to those of the child, was evidently from his attire
  above the middle rank. His frame was athletic, and as he was scarcely past
  the prime of life, the irresistible power of the disease, which could in one
  instant prostrate strength like his, was terribly attested.</p>

  <p>"Alas!" he cried, addressing the apprentice, "I was about to convey the
  remains of my poor child to the plague-pit. But I have been unable to
  accomplish my purpose. I hoped she would have escaped the polluting touch of
  those loathly attendants on the dead-cart."</p>

  <p>"She <i>shall</i> escape it," replied Leonard; "if you wish it, I will
  carry her to the pit myself."</p>

  <p>"The blessing of a dying man rest on your head," cried the sufferer; "your
  charitable action will not pass unrequited."</p>

  <p>With this, despite the agony he endured, he dragged himself to his child,
  kissed her cold lips, smoothed her fair tresses, and covered the body
  carefully with the cloth. He then delivered it to Leonard, who received it
  tenderly, and calling to Nizza Macascree, who had witnessed the scene at a
  little distance, and was deeply affected by it, to await his return, ran
  towards the plague-pit. Arrived there, he placed his little burden at the
  brink of the excavation, and, kneeling beside it, uttered a short prayer
  inspired by the occasion. He then tore his handkerchief into strips, and
  tying them together, lowered the body gently down. Throwing a little earth
  over it, he hastened to the sick man, and told him what he had done. A smile
  of satisfaction illumined the sufferer's countenance, and holding out his
  hand, on which a valuable ring glistened, he said, "Take it&mdash;it is but a
  poor reward for the service you have rendered me;&mdash;nay, take it," he
  added, seeing that the apprentice hesitated; "others will not be so
  scrupulous."</p>

  <p>Unable to gainsay the remark, Leonard took the ring from his finger and
  placed it on his own. At this moment, the sick man's gaze fell upon Nizza,
  who stood at a little distance from him. He started, and made an effort to
  clear his vision.</p>

  <p>"Do my eyes deceive me?" he cried, "or is a female standing there?"</p>

  <p>"You are not deceived," replied Leonard.</p>

  <p>"Let her come near me, in Heaven's name!" cried the sick man, staring at
  her as if his eyes would start from their sockets. "Who are you?" he
  continued, as Nizza approached.</p>

  <p>"I am called Nizza Macascree, and am the daughter of a poor piper," she
  replied.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" exclaimed the sick man, with a look of deep disappointment. "The
  resemblance is wonderful! And yet it cannot be. My brain is bewildered."</p>

  <p>"Whom does she resemble?" asked Leonard, eagerly.</p>

  <p>"One very dear to me," replied the sick man, with an expression of remorse
  and anguish, "one I would not think of now." And he buried his face in the
  grass.</p>

  <p>"Is there aught more I can do for you?" inquired Leonard, after a
  pause.</p>

  <p>"No," replied the sick man; "I have done with the world. With that child,
  the last tie that bound me to it was snapped. I now only wish to die."</p>

  <p>"Do not give way thus," replied Leonard; "a short time ago my condition
  was as apparently hopeless as your own, and you see I am now perfectly
  recovered."</p>

  <p>"You had something to live for&mdash;something to love," groaned the sick
  man. "All I lived for, all I loved, are gone."</p>

  <p>"Be comforted, sir," said Nizza, in a commiserating tone. "Much happiness
  may yet be in store for you."</p>

  <p>"That voice!" exclaimed the sick man, with a look denoting the approach of
  delirium. "It must be my Isabella. Oh! forgive me! sweet injured saint;
  forgive me!"</p>

  <p>"Your presence evidently distresses him," said Leonard. "Let us hasten for
  assistance. Your name, sir?" he added, to the sick man.</p>

  <p>"Why should you seek to know it?" replied the other. "No tombstone will be
  placed over the plague-pit."</p>

  <p>"Not a moment must be lost if you would save him," cried Nizza.</p>

  <p>"You are right," replied Leonard. "Let us fly to the nearest
  apothecary's."</p>

  <p>Accordingly, they set off at a quick pace towards Moorgate. Just as they
  reached it, they heard the bell ring, and saw the dead-cart approaching.
  Shrinking back while it passed, they ran on till they came to an apothecary's
  shop, where Leonard, describing the state of the sick man, by his entreaties
  induced the master of the establishment and one of his assistants to
  accompany him. Leaving Nizza in the shop, he then retraced his steps with his
  companions. The sick man was lying where he had left him, but perfectly
  insensible. On searching his pockets, a purse of money was found, but neither
  letter nor tablet to tell who he was. Leonard offered the purse to the
  apothecary, but the latter declined it, and desired his assistant, who had
  brought a barrow with him, to place the sick man within it, and convey him to
  the pest-house.</p>

  <p>"He will be better cared for there than if I were to take charge of him,"
  he observed. "As to the money, you can return it if he recovers. If not, it
  of right belongs to you."</p>

  <p>Seeing that remonstrance would be useless, Leonard did not attempt it, and
  while the assistant wheeled away the sick man, he returned with the
  apothecary to his dwelling. Thanking him for his kindness, he then hastened
  with Nizza Macascree to Great Knightrider-street. He related to the doctor
  all that had occurred, and showed him the ring. Hodges listened to the
  recital with great attention, and at its close said, "This is a very singular
  affair, and excites my curiosity greatly. I will go to the pest-house and see
  the sick man to-morrow. And now we will proceed to supper; and then you had
  better retire to rest, for you will have to be astir before daybreak. All is
  in readiness for the journey."</p>

  <p>The last night (for such she considered it) spent by Amabel in her
  father's dwelling, was passed in the kindliest interchanges of affection. Mr.
  Bloundel had much ado to maintain his firmness, and ever and anon, in spite
  of his efforts, his labouring bosom and faltering tones proclaimed the
  struggle within. He sat beside his daughter, with her thin fingers clasped in
  his, and spoke to her on every consolatory topic that suggested itself. This
  discourse, however, insensibly took a serious turn, and the grocer became
  fully convinced that his daughter was not merely reconciled to the early
  death that to all appearance awaited her, but wishful for it. He found, too,
  to his inexpressible grief, that the sense of the Earl of Rochester's
  treachery, combined with her own indiscretion, and the consequences that
  might have attended it, had sunk deep in her heart, and produced the present
  sad result.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Bloundel, it will scarcely be supposed, could support herself so well
  as her husband, but when any paroxysm of grief approached she rushed out of
  the room, and gave vent to her affliction alone. All the rest of the family
  were present, and were equally distressed. But what most strongly affected
  Amabel was a simple, natural remark of little Christiana, who, fixing her
  tearful gaze on her, entreated her "to come back soon."</p>

  <p>Weak as she was, Amabel took the child upon her knee, and said to her, "I
  am going a long journey, Christiana, and, perhaps may never come back. But if
  you attend to what your father says to you, if you never omit, morning and
  evening, to implore the blessing of Heaven, we shall meet again."</p>

  <p>"I understand what you mean, sister," said Christiana. "The place you are
  going to is the grave."</p>

  <p>"You have guessed rightly, Christiana," rejoined Amabel, solemnly. "Do not
  forget my last words to you, and when you are grown into a woman, think upon
  the poor sister who loved you tenderly."</p>

  <p>"I shall always think of you," said Christiana, clasping her arms round
  her sister's neck. "Oh! I wish I could go to the grave instead of you!"</p>

  <p>Amabel pressed her to her bosom, and in a broken voice murmured a blessing
  over her.</p>

  <p>Mr. Bloundel here thought it necessary to interfere, and, taking the
  weeping child in his arms, carried her into the adjoining apartment.</p>

  <p>Soon after this, the household were summoned to prayers, and as the grocer
  poured forth an address to Heaven for the preservation of his daughter, all
  earnestly joined in the supplication. Their devotions ended, Amabel took
  leave of her brothers, and the parting might have been painfully prolonged
  but for the interposition of her father. The last and severest trial was at
  hand. She had now to part from her mother, from whom, except on the occasion
  of her flight with the Earl of Rochester, she had never yet been separated.
  She had now to part with her, in all probability, for ever. It was a
  heart-breaking reflection to both. Knowing it would only renew their
  affliction, and perhaps unfit Amabel for the journey, Mr. Bloundel had
  prevailed upon his wife not to see her in the morning. The moment had,
  therefore, arrived when they were to bid each other farewell. The anguish
  displayed in his wife's countenance was too much for the grocer, and he
  covered his face with his hands. He heard her approach Amabel&mdash;he
  listened to their mutual sobs&mdash;to their last embrace. It was succeeded
  by a stifled cry, and uncovering his face at the sound, he sprang to his feet
  just in time to receive his swooning wife in his arms.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch3-6"
     name="ch3-6">VI. &mdash; THE DEPARTURE.</a></h2>

  <p>It struck four by Saint Paul's as Doctor Hodges, accompanied by Leonard
  and Nizza Macascree, issued from his dwelling, and proceeded towards
  Wood-street. The party was followed by a man leading a couple of horses,
  equipped with pillions, and furnished with saddle-bags, partly filled with
  the scanty luggage which the apprentice and the piper's daughter took with
  them. A slight haze, indicative of the intense heat about to follow, hung
  round the lower part of the cathedral, but its topmost pinnacles glittered in
  the beams of the newly-risen sun. As Leonard gazed at the central tower, he
  descried Solomon Eagle on its summit, and pointed him out to Hodges.
  Motioning the apprentice, in a manner that could not be misunderstood, to
  halt, the enthusiast vanished, and in another moment appeared upon the roof,
  and descended to the battlements, overlooking the spot where the little party
  stood. This was at the northwest corner of the cathedral, at a short distance
  from the portico. The enthusiast had a small sack in his hand, and calling to
  Nizza Macascree to take it, flung it to the ground. The ringing sound which
  it made on its fall proved that it contained gold or silver, while its size
  showed that the amount must be considerable. Nizza looked at it in
  astonishment, but did not offer to touch it.</p>

  <p>"Take it!" thundered Solomon Eagle; "it is your dowry." And perceiving she
  hesitated to comply with the injunction, he shouted to Leonard. "Give it her.
  I have no use for gold. May it make you and her happy!"</p>

  <p>"I know not where he can have obtained this money," observed Hodges; "but
  I am sure in no unlawful manner, and I therefore counsel Nizza to accept the
  boon. It may be of the greatest use to her at some future time."</p>

  <p>His scruples being thus overcome, Leonard took the sack, and placed it in
  one of the saddle-bags.</p>

  <p>"You can examine it at your leisure," remarked Hodges to Nizza. "We have
  no more time to lose."</p>

  <p>Solomon Eagle, meanwhile, expressed his satisfaction at the apprentice's
  compliance by his gestures, and, waving his staff round his head, pointed
  towards the west of the city, as if inquiring whether that was the route they
  meant to take. Leonard nodded an affirmative; and, the enthusiast spreading
  out his arms and pronouncing an audible benediction over them, they resumed
  their course. The streets were silent and deserted, except by the watchmen
  stationed at the infected dwellings, and a few sick persons stretched on the
  steps of some of the better habitations. In order to avoid coming in contact
  with these miserable creatures, the party, with the exception of Doctor
  Hodges, kept in the middle of the road. Attracted by the piteous exclamations
  of the sufferers, Doctor Hodges, ever and anon, humanely paused to speak to
  them; and he promised one poor woman, who was suckling an infant, to visit
  her on his return.</p>

  <p>"I have no hopes of saving her," he observed to Leonard, "but I may
  preserve her child. There is an establishment in Aldgate for infants whose
  mothers have died of the plague, where more than a hundred little creatures
  are suckled by she-goats, and it is wonderful how well they thrive under
  their nurses. If I can induce this poor woman to part with her child, I will
  send it thither."</p>

  <p>Just then, their attention was arrested by the sudden opening of a
  casement, and a middle-aged woman, wringing her hands, cried, with a look of
  unutterable anguish and despair&mdash;"Pray for us, good people! pray for
  us!"</p>

  <p>"We <i>do</i> pray for you, my poor soul!" rejoined Hodges, "as well as
  for all who are similarly afflicted. What sick have you within?"</p>

  <p>"There were ten yesterday," replied the woman. "Two have died in the
  night&mdash;my husband and my eldest son&mdash;and there are eight others
  whose recovery is hopeless. Pray for us! As you hope to be spared yourselves,
  pray for us!" And, with a lamentable cry, she closed the casement.</p>

  <p>Familiarized as all who heard her were with spectacles of horror and tales
  of woe, they could not listen to this sad recital, nor look upon her
  distracted countenance, without the deepest commiseration. Other sights had
  previously affected them, but not in the same degree. Around the little
  conduit standing in front of the Old Change, at the western extremity of
  Cheapside, were three lazars laving their sores in the water; while, in the
  short space between this spot and Wood-street, Leonard counted upwards of
  twenty doors marked with the fatal red cross, and bearing upon them the sad
  inscription, "Lord have mercy upon us!"</p>

  <p>A few minutes' walking brought them to the grocer's habitation, and on
  reaching it, they found that Blaize had already descended. He was capering
  about the street with joy at his restoration to freedom.</p>

  <p>"Mistress Amabel will make her appearance in a few minutes," he said to
  Leonard. "Our master is with her, and is getting all ready for her departure.
  I have not come unprovided with medicine," he added to Doctor Hodges. "I have
  got a bottle of plague-water in one pocket, and a phial of vinegar in the
  other. Besides these, I have a small pot of Mayerne's electuary in my bag,
  another of the grand antipestilential confection, and a fourth of the
  infallible antidote which I bought of the celebrated Greek physician, Doctor
  Constantine Rhodocanaceis, at his shop near the Three-Kings Inn, in
  Southampton-buildings. I dare say you have heard of him?"</p>

  <p>"I <i>have</i> heard of the quack," replied Hodges. "His end was a just
  retribution for the tricks he practised on his dupes. In spite of his
  infallible antidote, he was carried off by the scourge. But what else have
  you got?"</p>

  <p>"Only a few trifles," replied Blaize, with a chap-fallen look. "Patience
  has made me a pomander-ball composed of angelica, rue, zedoary, camphor, wax,
  and laudanum, which I have hung round my neck with a string. Then I have got
  a good-sized box of rufuses, and have swallowed three of them preparatory to
  the journey."</p>

  <p>"A proper precaution," observed Hodges, with a smile.</p>

  <p>"This is not all," replied Blaize. "By my mother's advice, I have eaten
  twenty leaves of rue, two roasted figs, and two pickled walnuts for
  breakfast, washing them down with an ale posset, with pimpernel seethed in
  it."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" exclaimed Hodges. "You must be in a pretty condition for a
  journey. But how could you bear to part with your mother and Patience?"</p>

  <p>"The parting from Patience <i>was</i> heart-breaking," replied Blaize,
  taking out his handkerchief, and applying it to his eyes. "We sat up half the
  night together, and I felt so much overcome that I began to waver in my
  resolution of departing. I am glad I did not give way now," he added, in a
  more sprightly tone. "Fresh air and bright sunshine are very different things
  from the close rooms in that dark house."</p>

  <p>"You must not forget that you were there free from the contagion,"
  rejoined Hodges; "while you are here exposed to its assaults."</p>

  <p>"True," replied Blaize; "that makes a vast difference. I almost wish I was
  back again."</p>

  <p>"It is too late to think of returning," said Hodges. "Mount your horse,
  and I will assist Nizza into the pillion."</p>

  <p>By the time that Blaize, who was but an indifferent horseman, had got into
  the saddle, and Nizza had taken her place behind him, the window opened, and
  Mr. Bloundel appeared at it.</p>

  <p>Amabel had only retired to rest for a few hours during the night. When
  left to herself in her chamber, she continued to pray till exhaustion
  compelled her to seek some repose. Arising about two o'clock, she employed
  herself for more than an hour in further devotion, and then took a last
  survey of every object in the room. She had occupied it from her childhood;
  and as she opened drawer after drawer, and cupboard after cupboard, and
  examined their contents, each article recalled some circumstance connected
  with the past, and brought back a train of long-forgotten emotions. While she
  was thus engaged, Patience tapped at the door, and was instantly admitted.
  The tenderhearted kitchenmaid assisted her to dress, and to put together some
  few articles omitted to be packed by her mother. During this employment she
  shed abundance of tears, and Amabel's efforts to console her only made
  matters worse. Poor Patience was forced at last to sit down, and indulge a
  hearty fit of crying, after which she felt considerably relieved. As soon as
  she was sufficiently recovered to be able to speak, she observed to Amabel,
  "Pardon what I am about to say to you, my dear young mistress, but I cannot
  help thinking that the real seat of your disease is in the heart."</p>

  <p>A slight blush overspread Amabel's pale features, but she made no
  answer.</p>

  <p>"I see I am right," continued Patience, "and indeed I have long suspected
  it. Let me entreat you, therefore, dear young lady, not to sacrifice
  yourself. Only say the word, and I will find means of making your retreat
  known to the Earl of Rochester. Blaize is devoted to you, and will do
  anything you bid him. I cannot wonder you fret after so handsome, so
  captivating a man as the earl, especially when you are worried to death to
  marry a common apprentice like Leonard Holt, who is not fit to hold a candle
  to your noble admirer. Ah! we women can never blind ourselves to the
  advantages of rank and appearance. We are too good judges for that. I hope
  you will soon be restored to your lover, and that the happiness you will
  enjoy will make amends for all the misery you have endured."</p>

  <p>"Patience," said Amabel, whose cheek, as the other spoke, had returned to
  its original paleness&mdash;"Patience," she said, gravely, but kindly, "I
  have suffered you to proceed too far without interruption, and must correct
  the very serious error into which you have fallen. I am so far from pining
  for an interview with the Earl of Rochester, that nothing in the world should
  induce me to see him again. I have loved him deeply," she continued in a
  tremulous tone; "nay, I will not attempt to disguise that I feel strongly
  towards him still, while I will also freely confess that his conduct towards
  me has so preyed upon my spirits, that it has impaired, perhaps destroyed, my
  health. In spite of this, I cannot sufficiently rejoice that I have escaped
  the earl's snares&mdash;I cannot be sufficiently thankful to the merciful
  Being who, while he has thought fit to chastise me, has preserved me from
  utter ruin."</p>

  <p>"Since you are of this mind," returned Patience, in a tone of incredulity,
  "you are more to be rejoiced with than pitied. But we are not overheard," she
  added, almost in a whisper, and glancing towards the door. "You may entirely
  confide in me. The time is arrived when you can escape to your lover."</p>

  <p>"No more of this," rejoined Amabel, severely, "or I shall command you to
  leave the room."</p>

  <p>"This is nothing more than pique," thought Patience. "We women are all
  hypocrites, even to ourselves. I will serve her whether she will or not. She
  <i>shall</i> see the earl. I hope there is no harm in wishing you may be
  happy with Leonard Holt," she added aloud. "<i>He</i> will make you a capital
  husband."</p>

  <p>"That subject is equally disagreeable&mdash;equally painful to me," said
  Amabel.</p>

  <p>"I had better hold my tongue altogether," rejoined Patience, somewhat
  pertly. "Whatever I say seems to be wrong. It won't prevent me from doing as
  I would be done by," she added to herself.</p>

  <p>Amabel's preparations finished, she dismissed Patience, to whom she gave
  some few slight remembrances, and was soon afterwards joined by her father.
  They passed half an hour together, as on the former night, in serious and
  devout conversation, after which Mr. Bloundel left her for a few minutes to
  let down Blaize. On his return he tenderly embraced her, and led her into the
  passage. They had not advanced many steps when Mrs. Bloundel rushed forth to
  meet them. She was in her night-dress, and seemed overwhelmed with
  affliction.</p>

  <p>"How is this, Honora?" cried her husband, in a severe tone. "You promised
  me you would see Amabel no more. You will only distress her."</p>

  <p>"I could not let her go thus," cried Mrs. Bloundel. "I was listening at my
  chamber door to hear her depart, and when I caught the sound of her
  footsteps, I could no longer control myself." So saying, she rushed to her
  daughter, and clasped her in her arms.</p>

  <p>Affectionately returning her mother's embrace, Amabel gave her hand to her
  father, who conducted her to the little room overlooking the street. Nothing
  more, except a deep and passionate look, was exchanged between them. Both
  repressed their emotion, and though the heart of each was bursting, neither
  shed a tear. At that moment, and for the first time, they greatly resembled
  each other; and this was not surprising, for intense emotion, whether of
  grief or joy, will bring out lines in the features that lie hidden at other
  times. Without a word, Mr. Bloundel busied himself in arranging the pulley;
  and calling to those below to prepare for Amabel's descent, again embraced
  her, kissed her pale brow, and, placing her carefully in the basket, lowered
  her slowly to the ground. She was received in safety by Leonard, who carried
  her in his arms, and placed her on the pillion. The pulley was then drawn up,
  and her luggage lowered by Mr. Bloundel, and placed in the saddle-bags by the
  apprentice. Every one saw the necessity of terminating this painful scene. A
  kindly farewell was taken of Hodges. Amabel waved her hand to her father,
  when at this moment Patience appeared at the window, and, calling to Blaize,
  threw a little package tied in a handkerchief to him. Doctor Hodges took up
  the parcel, and gave it to the porter, who, untying the handkerchief, glanced
  at a note it enclosed, and, striking his horse with his stick, dashed off
  towards Cheapside.</p>

  <p>"Pursue him!" cried Amabel to Leonard; "he is flying to the Earl of
  Rochester."</p>

  <p>The intimation was sufficient for the apprentice. Urging his horse into a
  quick pace, he came up with the fugitive, just as he had reached Cheapside.
  Blaize's mad career had been checked by Nizza Macascree, who, seizing the
  bridle, stopped the steed. Leonard, who was armed with a heavy riding-whip,
  applied it unsparingly to Blaize's shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Entreat him to hold his hand, dear, good Mistress Amabel," cried the
  porter; "it was for your sake alone I made this rash attempt. Patience told
  me you were dying to see the Earl of Rochester, and made me promise I would
  ride to Whitehall to acquaint his lordship whither you were going. Here is
  her letter which I was about to deliver." And as he spoke, he handed her the
  note, which was tied with a piece of packthread, and directed in strange and
  almost illegible characters.</p>

  <p>"Do not hurt him more," said Amabel; "he was not aware of the mischief he
  was about to commit. And learn from me, Blaize, that, so far from desiring to
  see the Earl of Rochester, all my anxiety is to avoid him."</p>

  <p>"If I had known that," returned the porter, "I would not have stirred a
  step. But Patience assured me the contrary."</p>

  <p>By this time, Doctor Hodges had come up, and an explanation ensued. It was
  agreed, however, that it would be better not to alarm Mr. Bloundel, but to
  attribute the porter's sudden flight to mismanagement of his steed.
  Accordingly, they returned to the residence of the grocer, who was anxiously
  looking out for them; and after a brief delay, during which the saddlebags
  were again examined and secured, they departed. Mr. Bloundel looked wistfully
  after his daughter, and she returned his gaze as long as her blinding eyes
  would permit her. So unwonted was the sound of horses' feet at this period,
  that many a melancholy face appeared at the window to gaze at them as they
  rode by, and Nizza Macascree shuddered as she witnessed the envious glances
  cast after them by these poor captives. As to Blaize, when they got into
  Cheapside, he was so terrified by the dismal evidences of the pestilence that
  met him at every turn, that he could scarcely keep his seat, and it was not
  until he had drenched himself and his companion with vinegar, and stuffed his
  mouth with myrrh and zedoary, that he felt anything like composure.</p>

  <p>On approaching Newgate Market, they found it entirely deserted. Most of
  the stalls were removed, the shops closed, and the window-shutters nailed up.
  It was never, in fact, used at all, except by a few countrymen and higglers,
  who ventured thither on certain days of the week to sell fresh eggs, butter,
  poultry, and such commodities. The manner of sale was this. The article
  disposed of was placed on a flag on one side of the market, near which stood
  a pump and a trough of water. The vendor then retired, while the purchaser
  approached, took the article, and put its price into the water, whence it was
  removed when supposed to be sufficiently purified.</p>

  <p>As the party passed Grey Friars, the tramp of their horses was mistaken
  for the dead-cart, and a door was suddenly opened and a corpse brought forth.
  Leonard would have avoided the spectacle had it been possible, but they were
  now too close to Newgate, where they were detained for a few minutes at the
  gate, while their bills of health were examined and countersigned by the
  officer stationed there. During this pause Leonard glanced at the grated
  windows of the prison, the debtors' side of which fronted the street. But not
  a single face was to be seen. In fact, as has already been stated, the prison
  was shut up.</p>

  <p>The gate was now opened to them, and descending Snow Hill they entered a
  region completely devastated by the pestilence. So saddening was the sight,
  that Leonard involuntarily quickened his horse's pace, resolved to get out of
  this forlorn district as speedily as possible. He was, however, stopped by an
  unexpected and fearful impediment. When within a short distance of Holborn
  Bridge, he observed on the further side of it a large black vehicle, and,
  unable to make out what it was, though a fearful suspicion crossed him,
  slackened his pace. A nearer approach showed him that it was the pest-cart,
  filled with its charnel load. The horse was in the shafts, and was standing
  quite still. Rising in his stirrups to obtain a better view, Leonard
  perceived that the driver was lying on the ground at a little distance from
  the cart, in an attitude that proclaimed he had been suddenly seized by the
  pestilence, and had probably just expired.</p>

  <p>Not choosing to incur the risk of passing this contagious load, Leonard
  retraced his course as far as Holborn Conduit, then turning into
  Seacole-lane, and making the best of his way to Fleet Bridge, crossed it, and
  entered the great thoroughfare with which it communicated. He had not
  proceeded far when he encountered a small party of the watch, to whom he
  showed his certificate, and recounted the fate of the driver of the
  dead-cart. At Temple Bar he was again obliged to exhibit his passports; and
  while there detained, he observed three other horsemen riding towards them
  from the further end of Fleet-street.</p>

  <p>Though much alarmed by the sight, Leonard did not communicate his
  apprehensions to his companions, but as soon as the guard allowed him to
  pass, called out to Blaize to follow him, and urging his horse to a quick
  pace, dashed up Drury-lane. A few minutes' hard riding, during which nothing
  occurred to give the apprentice further uneasiness, brought them to a road
  skirting the open fields, in which a pest-house had just been built by the
  chivalrous nobleman whose habitation in Berkshire they were about to visit.
  With a courage and devotion that redound more to his honour than the
  brilliant qualities that won him so high a reputation in the court and in the
  field, Lord Craven not merely provided the present receptacle for the sick,
  but remained in London during the whole continuance of the dreadful
  visitation; "braving," says Pennant, "the fury of the pestilence with the
  same coolness that he fought the battles of his beloved mistress, Elizabeth,
  titular Queen of Bohemia, or mounted the tremendous breach of Creutznach."
  The spot where this asylum was built, and which is the present site of
  Golden-square, retained nearly half a century afterwards, the name of the
  Pest-house Fields. Leonard had already been made acquainted by Doctor Hodges
  with the earl's generous devotion to the public welfare, and warmly
  commenting upon it, he pointed out the structure to Amabel. But the speed at
  which she was borne along did not allow her time to bestow more than a hasty
  glance at it. On gaining Hyde-park Corner, the apprentice cast a look
  backwards, and his apprehensions were revived by perceiving the three
  horsemen again in view, and evidently using their utmost exertions to come up
  with them.</p>

  <p>While Leonard was hesitating whether he should make known their danger to
  Amabel, he perceived Solomon Eagle dart from behind a wall on the left of the
  road, and plant himself in the direct course of their pursuers, and he
  involuntarily drew in the rein to see what would ensue. In another moment,
  the horsemen, who were advancing at full gallop, and whom Leonard now
  recognised as the Earl of Rochester, Pillichody, and Sir Paul Parravicin, had
  approached within a few yards of the enthusiast, and threatened to ride over
  him if he did not get of the way. Seeing, however, that he did not offer to
  move, they opened on either side of him, and were passing swiftly by, when,
  with infinite dexterity, he caught hold of the bridle of Rochester's steed,
  and checking him, seized the earl by the leg, and threw him to the
  ground.</p>

  <p>Sir Paul Parravicin pulled up as soon as he could, and, drawing his sword,
  rode back to assist his friend, and punish the aggressor; but the enthusiast,
  nothing daunted, met him in full career, and suddenly lifting up his arms,
  uttered a loud cry, which so startled the knight's high-spirited horse, that
  it reared and flung him. All this was the work of a few seconds. Pillichody
  had been borne forward by the impetuosity of his steed to within a short
  distance of the apprentice, and seeing the fate of his companions, and not
  liking Leonard's menacing gestures, he chipped spurs into his horse, and rode
  up Park-lane.</p>

  <p>Overjoyed at his unexpected deliverance, Leonard, whose attention had been
  completely engrossed by what was passing, now ventured to look at Amabel, and
  became greatly alarmed at her appearance. She was as pale as death, except a
  small scarlet patch on either cheek, which contrasted powerfully with the
  death-like hue of the rest of her countenance. Her hands convulsively clasped
  the back of the pillion; her lips were slightly apart, and her eyes fixed
  upon the prostrate form of the Earl of Rochester. On finding they were
  pursued, and by whom, her first impulse had been to fling herself from the
  pillion, and to seek safety by flight; but controlling herself, she awaited
  the result with forced composure, and was now sinking from the exhaustion of
  the effort.</p>

  <p>"Thank Heaven! we are safe," cried the apprentice; "but I fear the shock
  has been too much for you."</p>

  <p>"It has," gasped Amabel, falling against his shoulder. "Let us
  fly&mdash;oh! let us fly."</p>

  <p>Inexpressibly shocked and alarmed, Leonard twined his left arm round her
  waist so as to hold her on the steed, for she was utterly unable to support
  herself, and glancing anxiously at Nizza Macascree, struck off on the right
  into the road skirting the Park, and in the direction of Tyburn, where there
  was a small inn, at which he hoped to procure assistance. Before reaching
  this place, he was beyond description relieved to find that Amabel had so far
  recovered as to be able to raise her head.</p>

  <p>"The deadly faintness is passed," she murmured; "I shall be better soon.
  But I fear I am too weak to pursue the journey at present."</p>

  <p>Leonard spurred on his steed, and in another instant reached Tyburn, and
  drew up at the little inn. But no assistance could be obtained there. The
  house was closed; there was a red cross on the door; and a watchman,
  stationed in front of it, informed him that all the family had died of the
  plague except the landlord&mdash;"and he will be buried beside them in
  Paddington churchyard before to-morrow morning," added the man; "for his
  nurse tells me it is impossible he can survive many hours."</p>

  <p>As he spoke an upper window was opened, and a woman, thrusting forth her
  head, cried, "Poor Master Sandys has just breathed his last. Come in, Philip,
  and help me to prepare the body for the dead-cart."</p>

  <p>"I will be with you in a minute," rejoined the watchman. "You may possibly
  procure accommodation at the Wheatsheaf at Paddington," he added to Leonard;
  "it is but a short distance up the road."</p>

  <p>Thanking him for the information, Leonard took the course indicated. He
  had not proceeded far, when he was alarmed by hearing a piteous cry of "Stop!
  stop!" proceeding from Blaize; and, halting, found that the porter had been
  so greatly terrified by the watchman's account of the frightful mortality in
  the poor innkeeper's family, that he had applied to his phial of
  plague-water, and in pulling it put had dropped his box of rufuses, and the
  jar of anti-pestilential confection. He had just ascertained his loss, and
  wished to go back, but this Nizza Macascree would not permit. Enraged at the
  delay, Leonard peremptorily ordered the porter to come on; and Blaize,
  casting a rueful glance at his treasures, which he perceived at a little
  distance in the middle of the road, was compelled to obey.</p>

  <p>At Paddington, another disappointment awaited them. The Wheatsheaf was
  occupied by two large families, who were flying from the infected city, and
  no accommodation could be obtained. Leonard looked wistfully at Nizza
  Macascree, as if to ascertain what to do, and she was equally perplexed; but
  the difficulty was relieved by Amabel herself, who said she felt much better,
  and able to proceed a little further. "Do not return to London," she
  continued with great earnestness. "I would rather die on the road than go
  home again. Some cottage will receive us. If not, I can rest for a short time
  in the fields."</p>

  <p>Thinking it best to comply, Leonard proceeded along the Harrow-road. Soon
  after crossing Paddington Green, he overtook a little train of fugitives
  driving a cart filled with children, and laden with luggage. Further on, as
  he surveyed the beautiful meadows, stretching out on either side of him, he
  perceived a line of small tents, resembling a gipsy encampment, pitched at a
  certain distance from each other, and evidently occupied by families who had
  fled from their homes from fear of infection. This gave a singular character
  to the prospect. But there were other and far more painful sights on the
  road, which could not fail to attract attention. For the first half-mile,
  almost at every hundred yards might be seen some sick man, who, unable to
  proceed further, had fallen against the hedge-side, and exhibited his sores
  to move the pity of the passers-by. But these supplications were wholly
  unheeded. Self-preservation was the first object with all, and the travellers
  holding handkerchiefs steeped in vinegar to their faces, and averting their
  heads, passed by on the other side of the way.</p>

  <p>The pestilence, it may be remarked, had visited with extraordinary rigour
  the whole of the higher country at the west and north-west of the metropolis.
  The charmingly-situated, and, at other seasons, healthful villages of
  Hampstead and Highgate, suffered severely from the scourge; and it even
  extended its ravages as far as Harrow-on-the-Hill, which it half depopulated.
  This will account for the circumstance of a large pest-house being erected in
  the neighbourhood of Westbourne Green, which the party now approached. Two
  litters were seen crossing the fields in the direction of the hospital, and
  this circumstance called Leonard's attention to it. Shudderingly averting his
  gaze, he quickened his pace, and soon reached a small farmhouse on the summit
  of the hill rising from Kensal Green. Determined to seek a temporary asylum
  here for Amabel, he opened a gate, and, riding into the yard, fortunately met
  with owner of the house, a worthy farmer, named Wingfield, to whom he
  explained her situation. The man at first hesitated, but, on receiving
  Leonard's solemn assurance that she was free from the plague, consented to
  receive the whole party.</p>

  <p>Assisting Amabel to dismount, Wingfield conveyed her in his arms into the
  house, and delivered her to his wife, bidding her take care of her. The
  injunction was scarcely needed. The good dame, who was a middle-aged woman,
  with pleasing features, which lost none of their interest from being stamped
  with profound melancholy, gazed at her for a moment fixedly, and then
  observed in an under-tone, but with much emotion, to her husband, "Ah!
  Robert, how much this sweet creature resembles our poor Sarah!"</p>

  <p>"Hush! hush! dame," rejoined her husband, hastily brushing away the
  moisture that sprang to his eyes; "take her to your chamber, and see that she
  wants nothing. There is another young woman outside, whom I will send to
  you."</p>

  <p>So saying, he returned to the yard. Meantime, the others had dismounted,
  and Wingfield, bidding Nizza Macascree go in, led the way to the barn, where
  the horses were tied up, and fodder placed before them. This done, he
  conducted his guests to the house, and placing cold meat, bread, and a jug of
  ale before them, desired them to fall to&mdash;an injunction which Blaize,
  notwithstanding his previous repast of roasted figs and pickled walnuts, very
  readily complied with. While they were thus employed, Dame Wingfield made her
  appearance. She said that the poor creature (meaning Amabel) was too ill to
  proceed on her journey that day, and begged her husband to allow her to stop
  till the next morning, when she hoped she would be able to undertake it.</p>

  <p>"To-morrow morning, say you dame?" cried Wingfield; "she may stop till the
  day after, and the day after that, if you desire it, or she wishes it. Go
  tell her so."</p>

  <p>And as his wife withdrew, well pleased at having obtained her request,
  Wingfield addressed himself to Leonard, and inquired the cause of Amabel's
  illness; and as the apprentice saw no necessity for secresy, and felt
  exceedingly grateful for the kind treatment he had experienced, he acquainted
  him with the chief particulars of her history. The farmer appeared greatly
  moved by the recital.</p>

  <p>"She resembles my poor Sarah very strongly," he said. "My daughter was
  hurried into an early grave by a villain who won her affections and betrayed
  her. She now lies in Willesden churchyard, but her seducer is one of the
  chief favourites of our profligate monarch."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean the Earl of Rochester?" cried Leonard.</p>

  <p>"No, no," replied the farmer, whose good-natured countenance had assumed a
  stern expression. "The villain I mean is worse, if possible, than the earl.
  He is called Sir Paul Parravicin."</p>

  <p>"Gracious Heaven!" exclaimed Leonard, in astonishment; "what a strange
  coincidence is this!"</p>

  <p>And he then proceeded to relate to Wingfield the persecution which Nizza
  Macascree had endured from the profligate knight The farmer listened to his
  recital with breathless interest, and when it was ended arose, and, taking a
  hasty turn round the room, halted at the table and struck it forcibly with
  his clenched hand.</p>

  <p>"I hope that man will never cross my path," he said, all the blood
  mounting to his face, and his eye kindling with fury. "As God shall judge me,
  I will kill him if I meet him."</p>

  <p>"Then I hope you never will meet him," observed Leonard. "He has injured
  you enough already, without putting you out of the pale of Divine mercy."</p>

  <p>"These rascals have done us all an injury," observed Blaize. "Patience has
  never been like herself since Major Pillichody entered my master's dwelling,
  and made love to her. I feel quite uneasy to think how the little hussy will
  go on during my absence. She can't get out of the house, that's one
  comfort."</p>

  <p>"You have mentioned another wretch, who was constantly with Sir Paul,"
  cried Wingfield. "Perdition seize them!"</p>

  <p>"Ay, perdition seize them!" echoed Blaize, striking the table in his
  turn&mdash;"especially Major Pillichody."</p>

  <p>"Did you ever suspect Sir Paul to be of higher rank than he pretends?"
  asked Leonard.</p>

  <p>"No," rejoined Wingfield; "what motive have you for the question?"</p>

  <p>Leonard then told him of the inquiries instituted by Doctor Hodges
  relative to Nizza's retreat, and how they had been baffled. "It is strange,"
  he continued, "that Nizza herself never heard the real name of her
  persecutor; neither can she tell where the house to which she was conveyed,
  when in a fainting condition, and from which she was removed when attacked
  with the plague, is situated."</p>

  <p>"It is strange indeed," observed the farmer, musingly.</p>

  <p>Soon after this, Nizza Macascree made her appearance, and informed them
  that Amabel had fallen into a tranquil slumber, which, in all probability,
  would completely renovate her.</p>

  <p>"I hope it will," said Wingfield. "But I shall not part with her
  to-day."</p>

  <p>He then entered into conversation with Nizza, and after a little time,
  proposed to her and Leonard to walk across the fields with him to Willesden,
  to visit his daughter's grave.</p>

  <p>"My wife will take charge of Amabel," he said; "you may safely trust her
  in her hands."</p>

  <p>Leonard could raise no objection, except the possibility that the Earl of
  Rochester and his companions might discover their retreat, and carry off
  Amabel in his absence; but, after a little reflection, considering this
  altogether unlikely, he assented, and they set out. A pleasant walk across
  the fields brought them to the pretty little village of Willesden and its old
  and beautiful church. They proceeded to the grave of poor Sarah Wingfield,
  which lay at the east of the church, beneath one of the tall elms, and Nizza,
  as she stood by the rounded sod covering the remains of the unfortunate girl,
  could not restrain her tears.</p>

  <p>"This might have been my own fate," she said. "What an escape I have
  had!"</p>

  <p>"I did not bring you here to read you a lesson," said Wingfield, in a tone
  of deep emotion, "but because you, who know the temptation to which the poor
  creature who lies there was exposed, will pity her. Not alone did remorse for
  her conduct prey upon her spirits&mdash;not alone did she suffer from
  self-reproach,&mdash;but the scoffs and jeers of her sex, who never forgive
  an erring sister, broke her heart. She is now, however, beyond the reach of
  human malice, and, I trust, at peace."</p>

  <p>As he said this, he walked away to hide his emotion, and presently
  afterwards rejoining them, they quitted the churchyard together.</p>

  <p>As they recrossed the fields, Wingfield observed two men digging a hole in
  the ground, and, guessing their object, paused for a few minutes to watch
  them. Having thrown out the earth to the depth of a couple of feet, one of
  them took a long hooked pole, and attaching it to the body of a victim to the
  pestilence, who had wandered into the fields and died there, dragged it
  towards the pit. As soon as the corpse was pushed into its narrow receptacle,
  the clay was shovelled over it, and trodden down.</p>

  <p>"This is a sad mode of burial for a Christian," observed Wingfield. "But
  it would not do to leave an infected body to rot in the fields, and spread
  the contagion."</p>

  <p>"Such a grave is better than the plague-pit," rejoined Leonard, recalling
  the frightful scenes he had witnessed there.</p>

  <p>On reaching Wingfield's dwelling, they found from the good dame, that
  Amabel had awakened from her slumber greatly refreshed; but she gave it as
  her opinion that she had better remain undisturbed. Accordingly, no one went
  into the room to her except Nizza Macascree. A substantial dinner was
  provided for his guests by the hospitable farmer; and Blaize, who had been
  for some time confined to salt provisions at his master's house, did ample
  justice to the fresh meat and vegetables.</p>

  <p>The meal over, Leonard, who felt exceedingly curious to learn what had
  become of the mysterious stranger whose child he had carried to the
  plague-pit, and who had appeared so strangely interested in Nizza Macascree,
  determined to walk to the pest-house in Finsbury Fields and inquire after
  him. On communicating his intention to his host, Wingfield would have
  dissuaded him; but as Leonard affirmed he had no fear of infection, he
  desisted from the attempt. Just as the apprentice was starting, Blaize came
  up to him, and said,&mdash;"Leonard, I have a great curiosity to see a
  pest-house, and should like to go with you, if you will let me."</p>

  <p>The apprentice stared at him in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"You will never dare to enter it," he said.</p>

  <p>"I will go wherever you go," replied the porter, with a confidence mainly
  inspired by the hospitable farmer's strong ale.</p>

  <p>"We shall see," replied Leonard. "I shall keep you to your word."</p>

  <p>In less than an hour they reached Marylebone Fields (now the Regent's
  Park), and, crossing them, entered a lane, running in pretty nearly the same
  direction as the present New-road. It Drought them to Clerkenwell, whence
  they proceeded to Finsbury Fields, and soon came in sight of the pest-house.
  When Blaize found himself so near this dreaded asylum, all his courage
  vanished.</p>

  <p>"I would certainly enter the pest-house with you," he said to Leonard,
  "but I have used up all my vinegar, and you know I lost my box of rufuses and
  the pot of anti-pestilential confection this morning."</p>

  <p>"That excuse shall not serve your turn," replied Leonard. "You can get
  plenty of vinegar and plague medicine in the pest-house."</p>

  <p>"But I have no money to pay for them," rejoined Blaize.</p>

  <p>"I will lend you some," said Leonard, placing a few pieces in his hand.
  "Now, come along."</p>

  <p>Blaize would fain have run away, but, afraid of incurring the apprentice's
  anger, he walked tremblingly after him. They entered the garden-gate, and
  soon reached the principal door, which, as usual, stood open. Scarcely able
  to support himself, the porter tottered into the large room; but as he cast
  his eyes around, and beheld the miserable occupants of the pallets, and heard
  their cries and groans, he was so scared that he could not move another step,
  but stood like one transfixed with terror. Paying little attention to him,
  Leonard walked forward, and at the further extremity of the chamber found the
  young chirurgeon whom he had formerly seen, and describing the stranger,
  inquired where he was placed.</p>

  <p>"The person you allude to has been removed," returned the chirurgeon.
  "Doctor Hodges visited him this morning, and had him conveyed to his own
  dwelling."</p>

  <p>"Was he sensible at the time?" asked the apprentice.</p>

  <p>"I think not," replied the chirurgeon; "but the doctor appeared to
  recognise in him an old friend, though I did not hear him mention his name;
  and it was on that account, I conclude, that he had him removed."</p>

  <p>"Is he likely to recover?" asked Leonard, whose curiosity was aroused by
  what he heard.</p>

  <p>"That is impossible to say," replied the young man. "But he cannot be in
  better hands than those of Doctor Hodges."</p>

  <p>Leonard perfectly concurred with him, and, after a few minutes' further
  conversation, turned to depart. Not seeing Blaize, he concluded he had gone
  forth, and expected to find him in the garden, or, at all events, in the
  field adjoining. But he was nowhere to be seen. While wondering what had
  become of him, Leonard heard a loud cry, in the voice of the porter, issuing
  from the barn, which, as has already been stated, had been converted into a
  receptacle for the sick; and hurrying thither, he found Blaize in the hands
  of two stout assistants, who had stripped him of his clothes, and were tying
  him down to a pallet. On seeing Leonard, Blaize implored him to deliver him
  from the hands of his persecutors; and the apprentice assuring the assistants
  that the poor fellow was perfectly free from infection, they liberated
  him.</p>

  <p>It appeared, on inquiry, that Blaize had fallen against one of the pallets
  in a state almost of insensibility, and the two assistants, chancing to pass
  at the time, and taking him for a plague patient, had conveyed him to the
  barn. On reaching it, he recovered, and besought them to set him free, but
  they paid no attention to his cries, and proceeded to strip him, and bind him
  to the bed, as before related.</p>

  <p>Thus released, the porter lost no time in dressing himself; and Leonard,
  to allay his terrors, had a strong dose of anti-pestilential elixir
  administered to him. After which, having procured him a box of rufuses, and a
  phial of plague-water, Blaize shook off his apprehension, and they set out at
  a brisk pace for Kensal Green.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch3-7"
     name="ch3-7">VII. &mdash; THE JOURNEY.</a></h2>

  <p>Blaize was destined to experience a second fright. It has been mentioned
  that the infected were sometimes seized with a rabid desire of communicating
  the disorder to such as had not been attacked by it; and as the pair were
  making the best of their way along the Harrow-road, a poor lazar who was
  lying against the hedge-side, and had vainly implored their assistance,
  suddenly started up, and with furious cries and gestures made towards the
  porter. Guessing his intention, Blaize took to his heels, and, folding
  himself closely pressed, broke through the hedge on the right, and speeded
  across the field. In spite of the alarming nature of the occurrence, the
  apprentice could not help laughing at the unwonted agility displayed by the
  fat little porter, who ran so swiftly that it appeared probable he would
  distance his pursuer. To prevent mischief, however, Leonard set off after
  him, and was fast gaining upon the lazar, whose strength was evidently
  failing, when the poor wretch uttered a loud cry, and fell to the ground. On
  coming up, Leonard found him lying with his face in the grass, and convulsed
  by the agonies of death, and perceiving that all was over, hurried after the
  porter, whom he found seated on a gate, at the further end of the field,
  solacing himself with a draught of plague-water.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Leonard!" groaned the latter, "how little do we know what is for our
  good! I was delighted to quit my master's house this morning, but I now wish
  with, all my heart I was back again. I am afraid I shall die of the plague
  after all. Pray what are the first symptoms?"</p>

  <p>"Pooh! pooh! don't think about it, and you will take no harm," rejoined
  Leonard. "Put by your phial, and let us make the best of our way to Farmer
  Wingfield's dwelling."</p>

  <p>Being now in sight of the farm, which, from its elevated situation, could
  be distinguished at a distance of two miles in this direction, they easily
  shaped their course towards it across the fields. When about halfway up the
  hill, Leonard paused to look behind him. The view was exquisite, and it was
  precisely the hour (just before sunset) at which it could be seen to the
  greatest advantage. On the right, his gaze wandered to the beautiful and
  well-wooded heights of Richmond and Wimbledon, beyond which he could trace
  the long line of the Surrey hills, while nearer he perceived Notting Hill,
  now covered with habitations, but then a verdant knoll, crowned by a few
  trees, but without so much as a cottage upon it. On the left stood Hampstead;
  at that time a collection of pretty cottages, but wanting its present chief
  ornament, the church. At the foot of the hill rich meadows, bordered with
  fine hedges, interspersed with well-grown timber, spread out as far as the
  eye could reach. Nothing destroyed the rural character of the prospect; nor
  was there any indication of the neighbourhood of a great city, except the
  lofty tower and massive body of Saint Paul's, which appeared above the tops
  of the intervening trees in the distance.</p>

  <p>As on former occasions, when contemplating the surrounding country from
  the summit of the cathedral, Leonard could not help contrasting the beauty of
  the scene before him with the horrible scourge by which it was ravaged. Never
  had the country looked so beautiful&mdash;never, therefore, was the contrast
  so forcible; and it appeared to him like a lovely mask hiding the hideous and
  ghastly features of death. Tinged by the sombre hue of his thoughts, the
  whole scene changed its complexion. The smiling landscape seemed to darken,
  and the cool air of evening to become hot and noisome, as if laden with the
  deadly exhalations of the pestilence. Nor did the workings of his imagination
  stop here. He fancied even at this distance&mdash;nearly seven
  miles&mdash;that he could discern Solomon Eagle on the summit of Saint
  Paul's. At first the figure looked like a small black speck; but it gradually
  dilated, until it became twice the size of the cathedral, upon the central
  tower of which its feet rested, while its arms were spread abroad over the
  city. In its right hand the gigantic figure held a blazing torch, and in the
  left a phial, from the mouth of which a stream of dark liquid descended. So
  vividly did this phantasm present itself to Leonard, that, almost convinced
  of its reality, he placed his hands before his eyes for a few moments, and,
  on withdrawing them, was glad to find that the delusion was occasioned by a
  black cloud over the cathedral, which his distempered fancy had converted
  into the colossal figure of the enthusiast.</p>

  <p>Blaize, who had taken the opportunity of his companion's abstraction to
  sip a little more plague-water, now approached, and told him that Wingfield
  was descending the hill to meet them. Rousing himself, Leonard ran towards
  the farmer, who appeared delighted to see them back again, and conducted them
  to his dwelling. Owing to the tender and truly maternal attention of Dame
  Wingfield, Amabel was so much better that she was able to join the party at
  supper, though she took no share in the meal. Wingfield listened to the soft
  tones of her voice as she conversed with his wife, and at last, unable to
  control his emotion, laid down his knife and fork, and quitted the table.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter with your husband?" inquired Amabel of her hostess. "I
  hope he is not unwell."</p>

  <p>"Oh! no," replied the good dame; "your voice reminds him of our daughter,
  whose history I have related to you&mdash;that is all."</p>

  <p>"Alas!" exclaimed Amabel, with a sympathizing look, "I will be silent, if
  it pains him to hear me speak."</p>

  <p>"On no account," rejoined Dame Wingfield. "The tears he has shed will
  relieve him. He could not weep when poor Sarah died, and I feared his heart
  would break. Talk to him as you have talked to me, and you will do him a
  world of good."</p>

  <p>Shortly afterwards, the farmer returned to the table, and the meal
  proceeded to its close without further interruption. As soon as the board was
  cleared, Wingfield took a chair by Amabel, who, in compliance with his wife's
  request, spoke to him about his daughter, and in terms calculated to afford
  him consolation. Leonard was enraptured by her discourse, and put so little
  constraint upon his admiration, that Nizza Macascree could not repress a pang
  of jealousy. As to Blaize, who had eaten as much as he could cram, and
  emptied a large jug of the farmer's stout ale, he took his chair to a corner,
  and speedily fell asleep; his hoarse but tranquil breathing proving that the
  alarms he had undergone during the day did not haunt his slumbers. Before
  separating for the night, Amabel entreated that prayers might be said, and
  her request being readily granted, she was about to retire with Nizza, when
  Wingfield detained them.</p>

  <p>"I have been thinking that I might offer you a safe asylum here," he said.
  "If you like it, you shall remain with us till your health is fully
  reinstated."</p>

  <p>"I thank you most kindly for the offer," returned Amabel, gratefully; "and
  if I do not accept it, it is neither because I should not esteem myself safe
  here, nor because I am unwilling to be indebted to your hospitality, but that
  I have been specially advised, as my last chance of recovery, to try the air
  of Berkshire. I have little hope myself, but I owe it to those who love me to
  make the experiment."</p>

  <p>"If such is the case," returned the farmer, "I will not attempt to
  persuade you further. But if at any future time you should need change of
  air, my house shall be entirely at your service."</p>

  <p>Dame Wingfield warmly seconded her husband's wish, and, with renewed
  thanks, Amabel and her companion withdrew. As there was not sufficient room
  for their accommodation within the house, Leonard and the porter took up
  their quarters in the barn, and, throwing themselves upon a heap of straw,
  slept soundly till three o'clock, when they arose and began to prepare for
  their journey. Wingfield was likewise astir, and, after assisting them to
  feed and dress their horses, took them into the house, where a plentiful
  breakfast awaited them. At the close of the meal, Amabel and Nizza, who had
  breakfasted in their own room, made their appearance. All being in readiness
  for their departure, Dame Wingfield took leave of her guests with tears in
  her eyes, and the honest farmer was little less affected. Both gazed after
  them as long as they continued in sight.</p>

  <p>Having ascertained from Wingfield the route they ought to pursue, Leonard
  proceeded about a quarter of a mile along the Harrow-road, and then turned
  off on the left into a common, which brought them to Acton, from whence they
  threaded a devious lane to Brentford. Here they encountered several fugitives
  from the great city, and, as they approached Hounslow, learned from other
  wayfarers that a band of highwaymen, by whom the heath was infested, had
  become more than usually daring since the outbreak of the pestilence, and
  claimed a heavy tax from all travellers. This was bad news to Leonard, who
  became apprehensive for the safety of the bag of gold given to Nizza by the
  enthusiast, and he would have taken another road if it had been practicable;
  but as there was no alternative except to proceed, he put all the money he
  had about him into a leathern purse, trusting that the highwaymen, if they
  attacked them, would be content with this booty.</p>

  <p>When about halfway across the vast heath, which spread around them, in a
  wild but not unpicturesque expanse, for many miles on either side, Leonard
  perceived a band of horsemen, amounting perhaps to a dozen, galloping towards
  them, and, not doubting they were the robbers in question, communicated his
  suspicions to his companions. Neither Amabel nor Nizza Macascree appeared
  much alarmed, but Blaize was so terrified that he could scarcely keep his
  seat, and was with difficulty prevented from turning his horse's head and
  riding off in the opposite direction.</p>

  <p>By this time the highwaymen had come up. With loud oaths, two of their
  number held pistols to the heads of Leonard and Blaize, and demanded their
  money. The apprentice replied by drawing forth his purse, and besought the
  fellow to whom he gave it not to maltreat his companion. The man rejoined
  with a savage imprecation that he "would maltreat them both if they did not
  instantly dismount and let him search the saddle-bags;" and he was proceeding
  to drag Amabel from the saddle, when Leonard struck him a violent blow with
  his heavy riding-whip, which brought him to the ground. He was up again,
  however, in an instant, and would have fired his pistol at the apprentice, if
  a masked individual, who was evidently, from the richness of his attire, and
  the deference paid him by the others, the captain of the band, had not
  interfered.</p>

  <p>"You are rightly served, Dick Dosset," said this person, "for your
  rudeness to a lady. I will have none of my band guilty of incivility, and if
  this young man had not punished you, I would have done so myself. Pass free,
  my pretty damsel," he added, bowing gallantly to Amabel; "you shall not be
  further molested."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Blaize exhibited the contents of his pockets to the other
  highwayman, who having opened the box of rufuses and smelt at the phial of
  plague-water, returned them to him with a look of disgust, and bade him
  follow his companions. As Leonard was departing, the captain of the band rode
  after him, and inquired whether he had heard at what hour the king meant to
  leave Whitehall.</p>

  <p>"The court is about to adjourn to Oxford," he added, "and the king and
  some of his courtiers will cross the heath to-day, when I purpose to levy the
  same tax from his majesty that I do from his subjects."</p>

  <p>Leonard replied, that he was utterly ignorant of the king's movements; and
  explaining whence he came, the captain left him. The intelligence he had thus
  accidentally obtained was far from satisfactory to the apprentice. For some
  distance, their road would be the same as that about to be taken by the
  monarch and his attendants, amongst whom it was not improbable Rochester
  might be numbered; and the possibility that the earl might overtake them and
  discover Amabel filled him with uneasiness. Concealing his alarm, however, he
  urged his steed to a quicker pace, and proceeded briskly on his way, glad, at
  least, that he had not lost Solomon Eagle's gift to Nizza. Amabel's weakly
  condition compelled them to rest at frequent intervals, and it was not until
  evening was drawing in that they descended the steep hill leading to the
  beautiful village of Henley-upon-Thames, where they proposed to halt for the
  night.</p>

  <p>Crossing the bridge, they found a considerable number of the inhabitants
  assembled in the main street and in the market-place, in expectation of the
  king's passing through the town on his way to Oxford, intimation of his
  approach having been conveyed by avant-couriers. Leonard proceeded to the
  principal inn, and was fortunate enough to procure accommodation. Having
  conducted Amabel and Nizza to their room, he was repairing to the stable with
  Blaize to see after their steeds, when a loud blowing of horns was heard on
  the bridge, succeeded by the tramp of horses and the rattling of wheels, and
  the next moment four valets in splendid livery rode up, followed by a
  magnificent coach. The shouts of the assemblage proclaimed that it was the
  king. The cavalcade stopped before the inn, from the yard of which six fine
  horses were brought and attached to the royal carriage, in place of others
  which were removed. Charles was laughing heartily, and desired his
  attendants, who were neither numerous nor well-armed, to take care they were
  not robbed again between this place and Oxford; "Though," added the monarch,
  "it is now of little consequence, since we have nothing to lose."</p>

  <p>"Is it possible your majesty can have been robbed?" asked the landlord,
  who stood cap in hand at the door of the carriage.</p>

  <p>"I'faith, man, it <i>is</i> possible," rejoined the king. "We were stopped
  on Hounslow Heath by a band of highwaymen, who carried off two large coffers
  filled with gold, and would have eased us of our swords and snuff-boxes but
  for the interposition of their captain, who, as we live, is one of the
  politest men breathing&mdash;is he not, Rochester?"</p>

  <p>Leonard Holt, who was among the crowd of spectators, started at the
  mention of this name, and he trembled as the earl leaned forward in answer to
  the king's question. The eyes of the rivals met at this moment, for both were
  within a few yards of each other, and Rochester, whose cheek was flushed with
  anger, solicited the king's permission to alight, but Charles, affirming it
  was getting late, would not permit him, and as the horses were harnessed, and
  the drivers mounted, he ordered them to proceed without delay.</p>

  <p>Inexpressibly relieved by his rival's departure, Leonard returned to the
  house, and acquainted Amabel with what had occurred. Quitting Henley betimes
  on the following morning, they arrived in about three hours at Wallingford,
  where they halted for some time, and, then pursuing their journey, reached
  Wantage at four o'clock, where they tarried for an hour. Up to this hour,
  Leonard had doubted the possibility of reaching their destination that night;
  but Amabel assuring him she felt no fatigue, he determined to push on.
  Accordingly, having refreshed their steeds, they set forward, and soon began
  to mount the beautiful downs lying on the west of this ancient town.</p>

  <p>Crossing these heights, whence they obtained the most magnificent and
  extensive views of the surrounding country, they reached in about
  three-quarters of an hour the pretty little hamlet of Kingston Lisle. Here
  they again paused at a small inn at the foot of a lofty hill, denominated,
  from a curious relic kept there, the Blowing Stone. This rocky fragment,
  which is still in existence, is perforated by a number of holes, which emit,
  if blown into, a strange bellowing sound. Unaware of this circumstance,
  Leonard entered the house with the others, and had just seated, himself, when
  they were, astounded by a strange unearthly roar. Rushing forth, Leonard
  found Blaize with his cheeks puffed out and his mouth applied to the stone,
  into which he was blowing with all his force, and producing the
  above-mentioned extraordinary noise.</p>

  <p>Shortly after this, the party quitted the Blowing Stone, and having toiled
  up the steep sides of the hill, they were amply repaid on reaching its summit
  by one of the finest views they had ever beheld. In fact, the hill on which
  they stood commanded the whole of the extensive and beautiful vale of the
  White Horse, which was spread out before them as far as the eye could reach,
  like a vast panorama, disclosing a thousand fields covered with abundant,
  though as yet immature crops. It was a goodly prospect, and seemed to promise
  plenty and prosperity to the country. Almost beneath them stood the reverend
  church of Uffington overtopping the ancient village clustering round it.
  Numerous other towers and spires could be seen peeping out of groves of
  trees, which, together with the scattered mansions and farmhouses surrounded
  by granges and stacks of hay and beans, gave interest and diversity to the
  prospect. The two most prominent objects in the view were the wooded heights
  of Farringdon on the one hand, and those of Abingdon on the other.</p>

  <p>Proceeding along the old Roman road, still distinctly marked out, and
  running along the ridge of this beautiful chain of hills, they arrived at an
  immense Roman encampment, vulgarly called Uffingham Castle, occupying the
  crown of a hill. A shepherd, who was tending a flock of sheep which were
  browsing on the delicious herbage to be found within the vast circular space
  enclosed by the inner vallum of the camp, explained its purpose, and they
  could not but regard it with interest. He informed them that they were in the
  neighbourhood of the famous White Horse, a figure cut out of the turf on the
  hillside by the Saxons, and visible for many miles. Conducting them to a
  point whence they could survey this curious work, their guide next directed
  them to Ashdown Lodge, which lay, he told them, at about four miles'
  distance. They had wandered a little out of their course, but he accompanied
  them for a mile, until they came in sight of a thick grove of trees clothing
  a beautiful valley, above which could be seen the lofty cupola of the
  mansion.</p>

  <p>Cheered by the sight, and invigorated by the fresh breeze blowing in this
  healthful region, they pressed forward, and soon drew near the mansion, which
  they found was approached by four noble avenues. They had not advanced far,
  when a stalwart personage, six feet two high, and proportionately stoutly
  made, issued from the covert. He had a gun over his shoulder and was attended
  by a couple of fine dogs. Telling them he was called John Lutcombe, and was
  the Earl of Craven's gamekeeper, he inquired their business, and, on being
  informed of it, changed his surly manner to one of great cordiality, and
  informed them that Mrs. Buscot&mdash;such was the name of Amabel's
  aunt&mdash;was at home, and would be heartily glad to see them.</p>

  <p>"I have often heard her speak of her brother, Mr. Bloundel," he said, "and
  am well aware that he is an excellent man. Poor soul! she has been very
  uneasy about him and his family during this awful dispensation, though she
  had received a letter to say that he was about to close his house, and hoped,
  under the blessing of Providence, to escape the pestilence. His daughter will
  be welcome, and she cannot come to a healthier spot than Ashdown, nor to a
  better nurse than Mrs. Buscot."</p>

  <p>With this, he led the way to the court-yard, and, entering the dwelling,
  presently returned with a middle-aged woman, who Amabel instantly knew, from
  the likeness to her father, must be her aunt. Mrs. Buscot caught her in her
  arms, and almost smothered her with kisses. As soon as the first transports
  of surprise and joy had subsided, the good housekeeper took her niece and
  Nizza Macascree into the house, and desired John Lutcombe to attend to the
  others.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch3-8"
     name="ch3-8">VIII. &mdash; ASHDOWN LODGE.</a></h2>

  <p>Erected by Inigo Jones, and still continuing in precisely the same state
  as at the period of this history, Ashdown Lodge is a large square edifice,
  built in the formal French taste of the seventeenth century, with immense
  casements, giving it the appearance of being all glass, a high roof lighted
  by dormer windows, terminated at each angle by a tall and not very ornamental
  chimney, and surmounted by a lofty and lantern-like belvedere, crowned in its
  turn by a glass cupola. The belvedere opens upon a square gallery defended by
  a broad balustrade, and overlooking the umbrageous masses and lovely hills
  around it. The house, as has been stated, is approached by four noble
  avenues, the timber constituting which, is, of course, much finer now than at
  the period under consideration, and possesses a delightful old-fashioned
  garden, and stately terrace. The rooms are lofty but small, and there is a
  magnificent staircase, occupying nearly half the interior of the building.
  Among other portraits decorating the walls, is one of Elizabeth Stuart,
  daughter of James the First, and Queen of Bohemia, for whom the first Earl of
  Craven entertained so romantic an attachment, and to whom he was supposed to
  be privately united. Nothing can be more secluded than the situation of the
  mansion, lying as it does in the midst of a gentle valley, surrounded by a
  thick wood, and without having a single habitation in view. Its chief
  interest, however, must always be derived from its connection with the memory
  of the chivalrous and high-souled nobleman by whom it was erected, and who
  made it occasionally his retreat after the death of his presumed royal
  consort, which occurred about four years previous to the date of this
  history.</p>

  <p>Amabel was delighted with her new abode, and she experienced the kindness
  of a parent from her aunt, with whom, owing to circumstances, she had not
  hitherto been personally acquainted, having only seen her when too young to
  retain any recollection of the event. The widow of a farmer, who had resided
  on Lord Craven's estate near Kingston Lisle, Mrs. Buscot, after her husband's
  death, had been engaged as housekeeper at Ashdown Lodge, and had filled the
  situation for many years to the entire satisfaction of her employer. She was
  two or three years older than her brother, Mr. Bloundel; but the perfect
  health she enjoyed, and which she attributed to the salubrious air of the
  downs, combined with her natural cheerfulness of disposition, made her look
  much the younger of the two. Her features, besides their kindly and
  benevolent expression, were extremely pleasing, and must, some years ago,
  have been beautiful. Even now, what with her fresh complexion, her white
  teeth, and plump figure, she made no slight pretensions to comeliness. She
  possessed the same good sense and integrity of character as her brother,
  together with his strong religious feeling, but entirely unaccompanied by
  austerity.</p>

  <p>Having no children, she was able to bestow her entire affections upon
  Amabel, whose sad story, when she became acquainted with it, painfully
  affected her; nor was she less concerned at her precarious state of health.
  For the first day or two after their arrival, Amabel suffered greatly from
  the effects of the journey; but after that time, she gained strength so
  rapidly, that Mrs. Buscot, who at first had well-nigh despaired of her
  recovery, began to indulge a hope. The gentle sufferer would sit throughout
  the day with her aunt and Nizza Macascree in the gallery near the belvedere,
  inhaling the pure breeze blowing from the surrounding hills, and stirring the
  tree-tops beneath her.</p>

  <p>"I never expected so much happiness," she observed, on one occasion, to
  Mrs. Buscot, "and begin to experience the truth of Doctor Hodges' assertion,
  that with returning health, the desire of life would return. I now wish to
  live."</p>

  <p>"I am heartily glad to hear you say so," replied Mrs. Buscot, "and hold it
  a certain sign of your speedy restoration to health. Before you have been a
  month with me, I expect to bring back the roses to those pale cheeks."</p>

  <p>"You are too sanguine, I fear, dear aunt," rejoined Amabel, "but the
  change that has taken place in my feelings, may operate beneficially upon my
  constitution."</p>

  <p>"No doubt of it, my dear," replied Mrs. Buscot; "no doubt."</p>

  <p>The good dame felt a strong inclination at this moment to introduce a
  subject very near her heart, but, feeling doubtful as to its reception, she
  checked herself. The devoted attachment of the apprentice to her niece had
  entirely won her regard, and she fondly hoped she would be able to wean
  Amabel from all thought of the Earl of Rochester, and induce her to give her
  hand to her faithful lover. With this view, she often spoke to her of
  Leonard&mdash;of his devotion and constancy, his good looks and excellent
  qualities; and though Amabel assented to all she said, Mrs. Buscot was sorry
  to perceive that the impression she desired was not produced. It was not so
  with Nizza Macascree. Whenever Leonard's name was mentioned, her eyes
  sparkled, her cheek glowed, and she responded so warmly to all that was said
  in his praise, that Mrs. Buscot soon found out the state of her heart. The
  discovery occasioned her some little disquietude, for the worthy creature
  could not bear the idea of making even her niece happy at the expense of
  another.</p>

  <p>As to the object of all this tender interest, he felt far happier than he
  had done for some time. He saw Amabel every day, and noted with unspeakable
  delight the gradual improvement which appeared to be taking place in her
  health. The greater part of his time, however, was not passed in her society,
  but in threading the intricacies of the wood, or in rambling over the
  neighbouring downs; and he not only derived pleasure from these rambles, but
  his health and spirits, which had been not a little shaken by the awful
  scenes he had recently witnessed, were materially improved. Here, at last, he
  seemed to have got rid of the grim spectre which, for two months, had
  constantly haunted him. No greater contrast can be conceived than his present
  quiet life offered to the fearful excitement he had recently undergone. For
  hot and narrow thoroughfares reeking with pestilential effluvia, resounding
  with frightful shrieks, or piteous cries, and bearing on every side marks of
  the destructive progress of the scourge&mdash;for these terrible sights and
  sounds&mdash;for the charnel horrors of the plague-pit&mdash;the scarcely
  less revolting scenes at the pest-house&mdash;the dismal bell announcing the
  dead-cart&mdash;the doleful cries of the buriers&mdash;for graves surfeited
  with corruption, and streets filled with the dying and the dead&mdash;and,
  above all, for the ever-haunting expectation that a like fate might be his
  own,&mdash;he had exchanged green hills, fresh breezes, spreading views, the
  song of the lark, and a thousand other delights, and assurances of health and
  contentment. Often, as he gazed from the ridge of the downs into the
  wide-spread vale beneath, he wondered whether the destroying angel had
  smitten any of its peaceful habitations, and breathed a prayer for their
  preservation!</p>

  <p>But the satisfaction he derived from having quitted the infected city was
  trifling compared with that of Blaize, whose sole anxiety was lest he should
  be sent back to London. Seldom straying further than the gates of the
  mansion, though often invited by John Lutcombe to accompany him to some of
  the neighbouring villages; having little to do, and less to think of, unless
  to calculate how much he could consume at the next meal,&mdash;for he had
  banished all idea of the plague,&mdash;he conceived himself at the summit of
  happiness, and waxed so sleek and round, that his face shone like a full
  moon, while his doublet would scarcely meet around his waist.</p>

  <p>One day, about a fortnight after their arrival, and when things were in
  this happy state, Amabel, who was seated as usual in the gallery at the
  summit of the house, observed a troop of horsemen, very gallantly equipped,
  appear at the further end of the northern avenue. An inexpressible terror
  seized her, and she would have fled into the house, but her limbs refused
  their office.</p>

  <p>"Look there!" she cried to Nizza, who, at that moment, presented herself
  at the glass door. "Look there!" she said, pointing to the cavalcade; "what I
  dreaded has come to pass. The Earl of Rochester has found me out, and is
  coming hither to carry me off. But I will die rather than accompany him."</p>

  <p>"You may be mistaken," replied Nizza, expressing a hopefulness, which her
  looks belied; "it may be the Earl of Craven."</p>

  <p>"You give me new life," rejoined Amabel; "but no&mdash;no&mdash;my aunt
  has told me that the good earl will not quit the city during the continuance
  of the plague. And see! some of the horsemen have distinguished us, and are
  waving their hats. My heart tells me the Earl of Rochester is amongst them.
  Give me your arm, Nizza, and I will try to gain some place of
  concealment."</p>

  <p>"Ay, let us fly," replied the other, assisting her towards the door; "I am
  in equal danger with yourself, for Sir Paul Parravicin is doubtless with
  them. Oh! where&mdash;where is Leonard?"</p>

  <p>"He must be below," cried Amabel "But he could not aid us at this
  juncture; we must depend upon ourselves."</p>

  <p>Descending a short staircase, they entered Amabel's chamber, and fastening
  the door, awaited with breathless anxiety the arrival of the horsemen. Though
  the room whither they had retreated was in the upper part of the house, they
  could distinctly hear what was going on below, and shortly afterwards the
  sound of footsteps on the stairs, blended with merry voices and loud
  laughter&mdash;amid which, Amabel could distinguish the tones of the Earl of
  Rochester&mdash;reached them.</p>

  <p>While both were palpitating with fright, the handle of the door was tried,
  and a voice announced that the apprentice was without.</p>

  <p>"All is lost!" he cried, speaking through the keyhole; "the king is here,
  and is accompanied by the Earl of Rochester and other profligates."</p>

  <p>"The king!" exclaimed Amabel, joyfully; "then I am no longer
  apprehensive."</p>

  <p>"As yet, no inquiries have been made after you," continued Leonard,
  unconscious of the effect produced by his intelligence, "but it is evident
  they know you are here. Be prepared, therefore."</p>

  <p>"I <i>am</i> prepared," rejoined Amabel. And as she spoke, she threw open
  the door and admitted Leonard. "Do not stay with us," she added to him. "In
  case of need, I will throw myself on his majesty's protection."</p>

  <p>"It will avail you little," rejoined Leonard, distrustfully.</p>

  <p>"I do not think so," said Amabel, confidently. "I have faith in his
  acknowledged kindness of heart."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you are right," returned Leonard. "Mrs. Buscot is at present with
  his majesty in the receiving-room. Will you not make fast your door?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Amabel, firmly; "if the king will not defend me, I will
  defend myself."</p>

  <p>Leonard glanced at her with admiration, but he said nothing.</p>

  <p>"Is Sir Paul Parravicin here?" asked Nizza Macascree, with great
  anxiety.</p>

  <p>"I have not seen him," replied Leonard; "and I have carefully examined the
  countenances of all the king's attendants."</p>

  <p>"Heaven be praised!" exclaimed Nizza.</p>

  <p>At this juncture, Mrs. Buscot entered the room. Her looks bespoke great
  agitation, and she trembled violently.</p>

  <p>"You have no doubt heard from Leonard that the king and his courtiers are
  below," she said. "His majesty inquired whether you were here, and I did not
  dare to deceive him. He desires to see you, and has sent me for you. What is
  to be done?" she added, with a look of distraction. "I suppose you must
  obey."</p>

  <p>"There is no alternative," replied Amabel; "I will obey his majesty's
  commands as soon as I can collect myself. Take back that answer, dear
  aunt."</p>

  <p>"Has Leonard told you that the Earl of Rochester is here?" pursued Mrs.
  Buscot.</p>

  <p>Amabel replied in the affirmative.</p>

  <p>"God grant that good may come of it!" cried Mrs. Buscot, clasping her
  hands together, as she quitted the room; "but I am sorely afraid."</p>

  <p>A half-suppressed groan from the apprentice told that he shared in her
  apprehensions.</p>

  <p>"Leave us, Leonard," said Amabel; "I would prepare myself for the
  interview."</p>

  <p>The apprentice obeyed, and closing the door after him, stationed himself
  at the foot of the staircase. Left alone with Nizza, Amabel threw herself on
  her knees, and besought the support of Heaven on this trying occasion. She
  then arose, and giving her hand to Nizza, they went down stairs together.
  Leonard followed them at a little distance, and with a beating heart. Two
  gentlemen-ushers were posted, at the door of the chamber occupied by the
  king. Not far from them stood Mrs. Buscot, who, having made known her niece
  to the officials, they instantly admitted her, but ordered Nizza to remain
  outside.</p>

  <p>On entering the room, Amabel at once discovered the king. He was habited
  in a magnificent riding-dress and was seated on a rich fauteuil, around which
  were grouped a dozen gaily-attired courtiers. Amongst these were the Earl of
  Rochester and Sir George Etherege. As Amabel advanced, glances of insolent
  curiosity were directed towards her, and Rochester, stepping forward, offered
  to lead her to the king. She, however, declined the attention. Greatly
  mortified, the earl would have seized her hand; but there was so much dignity
  in her deportment, so much coldness in her looks, that in spite of his
  effrontery, he felt abashed. Charles smiled at his favourite's rebuff, but,
  in common with the others, he could not help being struck by Amabel's
  extraordinary beauty and natural dignity, and he observed, in an under-tone,
  to Etherege, "Is it possible this can be a grocer's daughter?"</p>

  <p>"She passes for such, my liege," replied Etherege, with a smile. "But I
  cannot swear to her parentage."</p>

  <p>"Since I have seen her, I do not wonder at Rochester's extravagant
  passion," rejoined the monarch. "But, odds fish! she seems to care little for
  him."</p>

  <p>Having approached within a short distance of the king, Amabel would have
  prostrated herself before him, but he prevented her.</p>

  <p>"Nay, do not kneel, sweetheart," he said, "I am fully satisfied of your
  loyalty, and never exact homage from one of your sex, but, on the contrary,
  am ever ready to pay it. I have heard much of your attractions, and, what is
  seldom the case in such matters, find they have not been overrated. The
  brightest of our court beauties cannot compare with you."</p>

  <p>"A moment ago, the fair Amabel might be said to lack bloom," observed
  Etherege; "but your majesty's praises have called a glowing colour to her
  cheek."</p>

  <p>"Would you deign to grant me a moment's hearing, my liege?" said Amabel,
  looking steadfastly at the king.</p>

  <p>"Not a moment's hearing merely, sweetheart," returned Charles; "but an
  hour's, if you list. I could dwell on the music of your tones for ever."</p>

  <p>"I thank your majesty for your condescension," she replied; "but I will
  not long trespass on your patience. What I have to say concerns the Earl of
  Rochester."</p>

  <p>"Stand forward, my lord," said Charles to the earl, "and let us hear what
  complaint is to be made against you."</p>

  <p>Rochester advanced, and threw a passionate and half-reproachful glance at
  Amabel.</p>

  <p>"It may be improper for me to trouble your majesty on so light a matter,"
  said Amabel; "but your kindness emboldens me to speak unreservedly. You may
  be aware that this nobleman once entertained, or feigned to entertain, an
  ardent attachment to me."</p>

  <p>"I need scarcely assure you, my liege," interposed Rochester, "that it was
  no feigned passion. And it is needless to add, that however ardently I felt
  towards my fair accuser then, my passion has in nowise abated."</p>

  <p>"I should wonder if it had," rejoined Charles, gallantly. "I will not
  contradict you, my lord," said Amabel; "it <i>is</i> possible you may have
  loved me, though I find it difficult to reconcile your professions of regard
  with your conduct&mdash;but this is not to the purpose. Whether you loved me
  or not, I loved <i>you</i>&mdash;deeply and devotedly. There is no sacrifice
  I would not have made for him," she continued, turning to the king, "and
  influenced by these feelings, and deluded by false promises, I forgot my
  duty, and was rash enough to quit my home with him."</p>

  <p>"All this I have heard, sweetheart," replied Charles. "There is nothing
  very remarkable in it. It is the ordinary course of such affairs. I am happy
  to be the means of restoring your lover to you, and, in fact, came hither for
  that very purpose."</p>

  <p>"You mistake me, my liege," replied Amabel. "I do not desire to have him
  restored to me. Fortunately for myself, I have succeeded in mastering my love
  for him. The struggle has well-nigh cost me my life&mdash;but I
  <i>have</i>conquered."</p>

  <p>"I have yet to learn, sweetheart," observed Charles, with an incredulous
  look, "that woman's love, if deeply fixed, <i>can</i> be subdued."</p>

  <p>"If I had not been supported by religion, my liege, I could <i>not</i>
  have subdued it," rejoined Amabel "Night and day, I have passed in
  supplicating the Great Power that implanted this fatal passion in my breast,
  and, at length, my prayers have prevailed."</p>

  <p>"Aha! we have a devotee here!" thought Charles. "Am I to understand, fair
  saint, that you would reject the earl, if he were to offer you his hand?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Unquestionably," replied Amabel, firmly.</p>

  <p>"This is strange," muttered Charles. "The girl is evidently in earnest.
  What says your lordship?" he added to Rochester.</p>

  <p>"That she shall be mine, whether she loves me or not," replied the earl.
  "My pride is piqued to the conquest."</p>

  <p>"No wonder!&mdash;the resistless Rochester flouted by a grocer's daughter.
  Ha! ha!" observed Charles, laughing, while the rest of the courtiers joined
  in his merriment.</p>

  <p>"Oh! sire," exclaimed Amabel, throwing herself at the king's feet, and
  bursting into tears, "do not abandon me, I beseech you. I cannot requite the
  earl's attachment&mdash;and shall die if he continues his pursuit. Command
  him&mdash;oh! command him to desist."</p>

  <p>"I fear you have not dealt fairly with me, sweetheart," said the king.
  "There is a well-favoured youth without, whom the earl pointed out as your
  father's apprentice. Have you transferred your affections to him?"</p>

  <p>"Your majesty has solved the enigma," observed Rochester, bitterly.</p>

  <p>"You wrong me, my lord," replied Amabel. "Leonard Holt is without. Let him
  be brought into the royal presence and interrogated; and if he will affirm
  that I have given him the slightest encouragement by look or word, or even
  state that he himself indulges a hope of holding a place in my regards, I
  will admit there is some foundation for the charge. I pray your majesty to
  send for him."</p>

  <p>"It is needless," replied Charles, coldly. "I do not doubt your assertion.
  But you will do the earl an injustice as well as yourself, if you do not
  allow him a fair hearing."</p>

  <p>"If you will allow me five minutes alone with you, Amabel, or will take a
  single turn with me on the terrace, I will engage to remove every doubt,"
  insinuated Rochester.</p>

  <p>"You would fail to do so, my lord," replied Amabel. "The time is gone by
  when those accents, once so winning in my ear, can move me."</p>

  <p>"At least give me the opportunity," implored the earl.</p>

  <p>"No," replied Amabel, decidedly, "I will never willingly meet you more;
  for though I am firm in my purpose, I do not think it right to expose myself
  to temptation. And now that I have put your majesty in full possession of my
  sentiments," she added to the king; "now that I have told you with what
  bitter tears I have striven to wash out my error,&mdash;I implore you to
  extend your protecting hand towards me, and to save me from further
  persecution on the part of the earl."</p>

  <p>"I shall remain at this place to-night," returned Charles. "Take till
  to-morrow to consider of it, and if you continue in the same mind, your
  request shall be granted."</p>

  <p>"At least, enjoin the earl to leave me unmolested till then," cried
  Amabel.</p>

  <p>"Hum!" exclaimed the king, exchanging a look with Rochester.</p>

  <p>"For pity, sire, do not hesitate," cried Amabel, in a tone of such agony
  that the good-natured monarch could not resist it.</p>

  <p>"Well, well," he rejoined; "it shall be as you desire. Rochester, you have
  heard our promise, and will act in conformity with it."</p>

  <p>The earl bowed carelessly.</p>

  <p>"Nay, nay, my lord," pursued Charles, authoritatively, "my commands
  <i>shall</i> be obeyed, and if you purpose otherwise, I will place you under
  restraint."</p>

  <p>"Your majesty's wishes are sufficient restraint," rejoined Rochester; "I
  am all obedience."</p>

  <p>"It is well," replied Charles. "Are you satisfied, fair damsel?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly," replied Amabel. And making a profound and grateful reverence
  to the king, she retired.</p>

  <p>Nizza Macascree met her at the door, and it was fortunate she did so, or
  Amabel, whose strength began to fail her, would otherwise have fallen. While
  she was thus engaged, Charles caught sight of the piper's daughter, and being
  greatly struck by her beauty, inquired her name.</p>

  <p>"Odds fish!" he exclaimed, when informed of it by Rochester, "a piper's
  daughter! She is far more beautiful than your mistress."</p>

  <p>"If I procure her for your majesty, will you withdraw your interdiction
  from me?" rejoined the earl.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;that is impossible, after the pledge I have given,"
  replied Charles. "But you must bring this lovely creature to me anon. I am
  enchanted with her, and do not regret this long ride, since it has brought
  her under my notice."</p>

  <p>"Your majesty's wishes shall be obeyed," said Rochester. "I will not wait
  till to-morrow for an interview with Amabel," he added to himself.</p>

  <p>Supported by Nizza Macascree and her aunt, and followed by Leonard, Amabel
  contrived to reach her own chamber, and as soon as she was sufficiently
  recovered from the agitation she had experienced, detailed to them all that
  had passed in her interview with the king. While the party were consulting
  together as to the course to be pursued in this emergency, the tap of a wand
  was heard at the door, and the summons being answered by Mrs. Buscot, she
  found one of the ushers without, who informed her it was the king's pleasure
  that no one should leave the house till the following day, without his
  permission.</p>

  <p>"To insure obedience to his orders," continued the usher, "his majesty
  requires that the keys of the stables be delivered to the keeping of his
  chief page, Mr. Chiffinch, who has orders, together with myself, to keep
  watch during the night."</p>

  <p>So saying, he bowed and retired, while Mrs. Buscot returned with this new
  and alarming piece of intelligence to the others.</p>

  <p>"Why should the mandate be respected?" cried Leonard, indignantly. "We
  have committed no crime, and ought not to be detained prisoners. Trust to me,
  and I will find some means of eluding their vigilance. If you will remain
  here to-morrow," he added to Amabel, "you are lost."</p>

  <p>"Do not expect any rational advice from me, my dear niece," observed Mrs.
  Buscot, "for I am fairly bewildered."</p>

  <p>"Shall I not forfeit the king's protection by disobeying his injunctions?"
  replied Amabel. "I am safer here than if I were to seek a new asylum, which
  would be speedily discovered."</p>

  <p>"Heaven grant you may not have cause to repent your decision!" cried
  Leonard, despondingly.</p>

  <p>"I must now, perforce, quit you, my dear niece," said Mrs. Buscot, "though
  it breaks my heart to do so. His majesty's arrival has thrown everything into
  confusion, and if I do not look after the supper, which is commanded at an
  early hour, it will never be ready. As it is, there will be nothing fit to
  set before him. What with my distress about you, and my anxiety about the
  royal repast, I am well-nigh beside myself."</p>

  <p>With this, she quitted the room, and Amabel signifying to Leonard that she
  desired to be left alone with Nizza Macascree, he departed at the same
  time.</p>

  <p>As Mrs. Buscot had stated, the utmost confusion prevailed below. The royal
  purveyor and cook, who formed part of the king's suite, were busily employed
  in the kitchen, and though they had the whole household at their command,
  they made rather slow progress at first, owing to the want of materials. In a
  short time, however, this difficulty was remedied. Ducks were slaughtered by
  the dozen; fowls by the score, and a couple of fat geese shared the same
  fate. The store ponds were visited for fish by John Lutcombe; and as the
  country abounded with game, a large supply of pheasants, partridges, and
  rabbits was speedily procured by the keeper and his assistants. Amongst
  others, Blaize lent a helping-hand in this devastation of the poultry-yard,
  and he had just returned to the kitchen, and commenced plucking one of the
  geese, when he was aroused by a slap on the shoulder, and looking up, beheld
  Pillichody.</p>

  <p>"What ho! my little Blaize, my physic-taking porter," cried the bully;
  "how wags the world with you? And how is my pretty Patience? How is that
  peerless kitchen-maiden? By the god of love! I am dying to behold her
  again."</p>

  <p>"Patience is well enough, for aught I know," replied Blaize, in a surly
  tone. "But it is useless for you to think of her. She is betrothed to
  me."</p>

  <p>"I know it," replied Pillichody; "but do not suppose you are the sole
  master of her affections. The little charmer has too good taste for that.
  'Blaize,' said she to me, 'will do very well for a husband, but he cannot
  expect me to continue faithful to him.'"</p>

  <p>"Cannot I?" exclaimed the porter reddening. "Fiends take her! but I do!
  When did she say this?"</p>

  <p>"When I last visited your master's house," replied Pillichody. "Sweet
  soul! I shall never forget her tender looks, nor the kisses she allowed me to
  snatch from her honeyed lips when your back was turned. The very recollection
  of them is enchanting."</p>

  <p>"Zounds and fury!" cried Blaize, transported with rage. "If I am only a
  porter, while you pretend to be a major, I will let you see I am the better
  man of the two." And taking the goose by the neck, he swung it round his head
  like a flail, and began to batter Pillichody about the face with it.</p>

  <p>"S'death!" cried the bully, endeavouring to draw his sword, "if you do not
  instantly desist, I will treat you like that accursed bird&mdash;cut your
  throat, pluck, stuff, roast, and eat you afterwards." He was, however, so
  confounded by the attack, that he could offer no resistance, and in
  retreating, caught his foot against the leg of a table, and fell backwards on
  the floor. Being now completely at the porter's mercy, and seeing that the
  latter was preparing to pursue his advantage with a rolling-pin which he had
  snatched from the dresser, he besought him piteously to spare him.</p>

  <p>"Recant all you have said," cried Blaize, brandishing the rolling-pin over
  him. "Confess that you have calumniated Patience. Confess that she rejected
  your advances, if you ever dared to make any to her. Confess that she is a
  model of purity and constancy. Confess all this, villain, or I will break
  every bone in your body."</p>

  <p>"I do confess it," replied Pillichody, abjectly. "She is all you describe.
  She never allowed me greater freedom than a squeeze of the hand."</p>

  <p>"That was too much," replied the porter, belabouring him with the
  rolling-pin. "Swear that you will never attempt such a liberty again, or I
  will pummel you to death. Swear it."</p>

  <p>"I swear," replied Pillichody.</p>

  <p>"Before I allow you to rise, I must disarm you to prevent mischief," cried
  Blaize. And kneeling down upon the prostrate bully, who groaned aloud, he
  drew his long blade from his side. "There, now you may get up," he added.</p>

  <p>So elated was Blaize with his conquest, that he could do nothing for some
  time but strut up and down the kitchen with the sword over his shoulder, to
  the infinite diversion of the other domestics, and especially of John
  Lutcombe, who chanced to make his appearance at the time, laden with a fresh
  supply of game.</p>

  <p>"Why, Blaize, man," cried the keeper, approvingly, "I did not give you
  credit for half so much spirit."</p>

  <p>"No man's courage is duly appreciated until it has been tried," rejoined
  Blaize. "I would combat with you, gigantic John, if Patience's fidelity were
  called in question."</p>

  <p>Pillichody, meanwhile, had retired with a discomfited air into a corner,
  where he seated himself on a stool, and eyed the porter askance, as if
  meditating some terrible retaliation. Secretly apprehensive of this, and
  thinking it becoming to act with generosity towards his foe, Blaize marched
  up to him, and extended his hand in token of reconciliation. To the surprise
  of all, Pillichody did not reject his overtures.</p>

  <p>"I have a great regard for you, friend Blaize," he said, "otherwise I
  should never rest till I had been repaid with terrible interest for the
  indignities I have endured."</p>

  <p>"Nay, heed them not," replied Blaize. "You must make allowances for the
  jealous feelings you excited. I love Patience better than my life."</p>

  <p>"Since you put it in that light," rejoined Pillichody, "I am willing to
  overlook the offence. Snakes and scorpions! no man can be a greater martyr to
  jealousy than myself. I killed three of my most intimate friends for merely
  presuming to ogle the widow of Watling-street, who would have been mine, if
  she had not died of the plague."</p>

  <p>"Don't talk of the plague, I beseech you," replied Blaize, with a shudder.
  "It is a subject never mentioned here."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry I alluded to it, then," rejoined Pillichody. "Give me back my
  sword. Nay, fear nothing. I entirely forgive you, and am willing to drown the
  remembrance of our quarrel in a bottle of sack."</p>

  <p>Readily assenting to the proposition, Blaize obtained the key of the
  cellar from the butler, and adjourning thither with Pillichody, they seated
  themselves on a cask with a bottle of sack and a couple of large glasses on a
  stool between them.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you know why I am come hither?" observed the major, smacking
  his lips after his second bumper.</p>

  <p>"Not precisely," replied Blaize. "But I presume your visit has some
  reference to Mistress Amabel."</p>

  <p>"A shrewd guess," rejoined Pillichody. "And this reminds me that we have
  omitted to drink her health."</p>

  <p>"Her better health," returned Blaize, emptying his glass. "Heaven be
  praised! she has plucked up a little since we came here."</p>

  <p>"She would soon be herself again if she were united to the Earl of
  Rochester," said Pillichody.</p>

  <p>"There you are wrong," replied Blaize. "She declares she has no longer any
  regard for him."</p>

  <p>"Mere caprice, believe me," rejoined Pillichody. "She loves him better
  than ever."</p>

  <p>"It may be so," returned Blaize; "for Patience, who ought to know
  something of the matter, assured me she was dying for the earl; and if she
  had not told me the contrary herself, I should not have believed it."</p>

  <p>"Did she tell you so in the presence of Leonard?" asked Pillichody.</p>

  <p>"Why, now I bethink me, he <i>was</i> present," replied Blaize,
  involuntarily putting his hand to his shoulder, as he recalled the
  horsewhipping he had received on that occasion.</p>

  <p>"I knew it!" cried Pillichody. "She is afraid to confess her attachment to
  the earl. Is Leonard as much devoted to her as ever?"</p>

  <p>"I fancy so," replied Blaize, "but she certainly gives <i>him</i> no
  encouragement."</p>

  <p>"Confirmation!" exclaimed Pillichody. "But fill your glass. We will drink
  to the earl's speedy union with Amabel."</p>

  <p>"Not so loud," cried Blaize, looking uneasily round the cellar. "I should
  not like Leonard to overhear us."</p>

  <p>"Neither should I," returned Pillichody, "for I have something to say to
  you respecting him."</p>

  <p>"You need not propose any more plans for carrying off Amabel," cried
  Blaize, "for I won't take any part in them."</p>

  <p>"I have no such intention," rejoined Pillichody. "The truth is," he added,
  mysteriously, "I am inclined to side with you and Leonard. But as we have
  finished our bottle, suppose we take a turn in the court-yard."</p>

  <p>"With all my heart," replied Blaize.</p>

  <p>Immediately after Amabel's departure Charles proceeded with his courtiers
  to the garden, and continued to saunter up and down the terrace for some
  time, during which he engaged Rochester in conversation, so as to give him no
  pretext for absenting himself. The king next ascended to the belvedere, and
  having surveyed the prospect from it, was about to descend when he caught a
  glimpse of Nizza Macascree on the great staircase, and instantly flew towards
  her.</p>

  <p>"I must have a word with you, sweetheart," he cried, taking her hand,
  which she did not dare to withdraw.</p>

  <p>Ready to sink with confusion, Nizza suffered herself to be led towards the
  receiving-room. Motioning to the courtiers to remain without, Charles entered
  it with his blushing companion, and after putting several questions to her,
  which she answered with great timidity and modesty, inquired into the state
  of her heart.</p>

  <p>"Answer me frankly," he said. "Are your affections engaged?"</p>

  <p>"Since your majesty deigns to interest yourself so much about me," replied
  Nizza, "I will use no disguise. They are."</p>

  <p>"To whom?" demanded the king.</p>

  <p>"To Leonard Holt," was the answer.</p>

  <p>"What! the apprentice who brought Amabel hither!" cried the king. "Why,
  the Earl of Rochester seemed to intimate that he was in love with Amabel. Is
  it so?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot deny it," replied Nizza, hanging down her head.</p>

  <p>"If this is the case, it is incumbent on me to provide you with a new
  lover," replied Charles. "What will you say, sweetheart, if I tell you, you
  have made a royal conquest?"</p>

  <p>"I should tremble to hear it," replied Nizza. "But your majesty is jesting
  with me."</p>

  <p>"On my soul, no!" rejoined the king, passionately. "I have never seen
  beauty equal to yours, sweetheart&mdash;never have been so suddenly, so
  completely captivated before."</p>

  <p>"Oh! do not use this language towards me, my liege," replied Nizza,
  dropping on her knee before him. "I am unworthy your notice. My heart is
  entirely given to Leonard Holt."</p>

  <p>"You will speedily forget him in the brilliant destiny which awaits you,
  child," returned Charles, raising her. "Do not bestow another thought on the
  senseless dolt who can prefer Amabel's sickly charms to your piquant
  attractions. By Heaven! you shall be mine."</p>

  <p>"Never!" exclaimed Nizza, extricating herself from his grasp, and rushing
  towards the door.</p>

  <p>"You fly in vain," cried the king, laughingly pursuing her.</p>

  <p>As he spoke the door opened, and Sir Paul Parravicin entered the room. The
  knight started on seeing how matters stood, and the king looked surprised and
  angry. Taking advantage of their embarrassment, Nizza made good her retreat,
  and hurrying to Amabel's chamber, closed and bolted the door.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter?" cried Amabel, startled by her agitated
  appearance.</p>

  <p>"Sir Paul Parravicin is here," replied Nizza. "I have seen him. But that
  is not all. I am unlucky enough to have attracted the king's fancy. He has
  terrified me with his proposals."</p>

  <p>"Our persecution is never to end," rejoined Amabel; "you are as
  unfortunate as myself."</p>

  <p>"And there is no possibility of escape," returned Nizza, bursting into
  tears; we are snared like birds in the nets of the fowler."</p>

  <p>"You can fly with Leonard if you choose," replied Amabel.</p>

  <p>"And leave you&mdash;impossible!" rejoined Nizza.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing for it, then, but resignation," returned Amabel. "Let us
  put a firm trust in Heaven, and no ill can befall us."</p>

  <p>After passing several hours of the greatest disquietude, they were about
  to retire to rest, when Mrs. Buscot tapped at the door, and making herself
  known, was instantly admitted.</p>

  <p>"Alas!" she cried, clasping her niece round the neck, "I tremble to tell
  you what I have heard. Despite the king's injunctions, the wicked Earl of
  Rochester is determined to see you before morning, and to force you to
  compliance with his wishes. You must fly as soon as it is dark."</p>

  <p>"But how am I to fly, dear aunt?" rejoined Amabel. "You yourself know that
  the keys of the stable are taken away, and that two of the king's attendants
  will remain on the watch all night. How will it be possible to elude their
  vigilance?"</p>

  <p>"Leave Leonard to manage it," replied Mrs. Buscot. "Only prepare to set
  out. John Lutcombe will guide you across the downs to Kingston Lisle, where
  good Mrs. Compton will take care of you, and when the danger is over you can
  return to me."</p>

  <p>"It is a hazardous expedient," rejoined Amabel, "and I would rather run
  all risks, and remain here. If the earl should resort to violence, I can
  appeal to the king for protection."</p>

  <p>"If you have any regard for me, fly," cried Nizza Macascree. "I am lost if
  I remain here till to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"For <i>your</i> sake I will go, then," returned Amabel. "But I have a
  foreboding that I am running into the teeth of danger."</p>

  <p>"Oh! say not so," rejoined Mrs. Buscot. "I am persuaded it is for the
  best. I must leave you now, but I will send Leonard to you."</p>

  <p>"It is needless," replied Amabel. "Let him come to us at the proper time.
  We will be ready."</p>

  <p>To explain the cause of Mrs. Buscot's alarm, it will be necessary to
  return to the receiving-room, and ascertain what occurred after Nizza's
  flight. Charles, who at first had been greatly annoyed by Parravicin's abrupt
  entrance, speedily recovered his temper, and laughed at the other's forced
  apologies.</p>

  <p>"I find I have a rival in your majesty," observed the knight. "It is
  unlucky for me that you have encountered Nizza. Her charms were certain to
  inflame you. But when I tell you I am desperately enamoured of her, I am
  persuaded you will not interfere with me."</p>

  <p>"I will tell you what I will do," replied the good-humoured monarch, after
  a moment's reflection. "I remember your mentioning that you once played with
  a Captain Disbrowe for his wife, and won her from him. We will play for this
  girl in the same manner."</p>

  <p>"But your majesty is a far more skilful player than Disbrowe," replied
  Parravicin, reluctantly.</p>

  <p>"It matters not," rejoined the monarch; "the chances will be more
  equal&mdash;or rather the advantage will be greatly on your side, for you are
  allowed to be the luckiest and best player at my court. If I win, she is
  mine. If, on the contrary, fortune favours you, I resign her."</p>

  <p>"Since there is no avoiding it, I accept the challenge," replied
  Parravicin.</p>

  <p>"The decision shall not be delayed an instant," cried Charles, "What,
  ho!&mdash;dice!&mdash;dice!"</p>

  <p>An attendant answering the summons, he desired that the other courtiers
  should be admitted, and dice brought. The latter order could not be so easily
  obeyed, there being no such articles at Ashdown; and the attendants were
  driven to their wits' ends, when Pillichody chancing to overhear what was
  going forward, produced a box and dice, which were instantly conveyed to the
  king, and the play commenced. Charles, to his inexpressible delight and
  Parravicin's chagrin, came off the winner, and the mortification of the
  latter was increased by the laughter and taunts of the spectators.</p>

  <p>"You are not in your usual luck to-day," observed Rochester to him, as
  they walked aside.</p>

  <p>"For all this, do not think I will surrender Nizza," replied Parravicin,
  in a low tone, "I love her too well for that."</p>

  <p>"I cannot blame you," replied Rochester. "Step this way," he added,
  drawing him to the further end of the room. "It is my intention to carry off
  Amabel to-night, notwithstanding old Rowley's injunctions to the contrary,
  and I propose to accomplish my purpose in the following manner. I will
  frighten her into flying with Leonard Holt, and will then secretly follow
  her. Nizza Macascree is sure to accompany her, and will, therefore, be in
  your power."</p>

  <p>"I see!" cried Parravicin. "A capital project!"</p>

  <p>"Pillichody has contrived to ingratiate himself with Blaize," pursued the
  earl, "and through him the matter can be easily managed. The keys of the
  stables, which are now intrusted to Chiffinch, shall be stolen&mdash;the
  horses set free&mdash;and the two damsels caught in the trap prepared for
  them, while the only person blamed in the matter will be Leonard."</p>

  <p>"Bravo!" exclaimed Parravicin. "I am impatient for the scheme to be put
  into execution."</p>

  <p>"I will set about it at once," returned Rochester.</p>

  <p>And separating from Parravicin, he formed some excuse for quitting the
  royal presence.</p>

  <p>About an hour afterwards, Pillichody sought out Blaize, and told him, with
  a very mysterious air, that he had something to confide to him.</p>

  <p>"You know my regard for the Earl of Rochester and Sir Paul Parravicin," he
  said, "and that I would do anything an honourable man ought to do to assist
  them. But there are certain bounds which even friendship cannot induce me to
  pass. They meditate the worst designs against Amabel and Nizza Macascree, and
  intend to accomplish their base purpose before daybreak. I therefore give you
  notice, that you may acquaint Leonard Holt with the dangerous situation of
  the poor girls, and contrive their escape in the early part of the night. I
  will steal the keys of the stable for you from Chiffinch, and will render you
  every assistance in my power. But if you are discovered, you must not betray
  me."</p>

  <p>"Not for the world!" replied Blaize. "I am sure we are infinitely obliged
  to you. It is a horrible design, and must be prevented. I wish all this
  flying and escaping was over. I desire to be quiet, and am quite sorry to
  leave this charming place."</p>

  <p>"There is no alternative now," rejoined Pillichody.</p>

  <p>"So it appears," groaned Blaize.</p>

  <p>The substance of Pillichody's communication was immediately conveyed to
  Leonard, who told Blaize to acquaint his informer that he should have two
  pieces of gold, if he brought them the keys. To obtain them was not very
  difficult, and the bully was aided in accomplishing the task by the Earl of
  Rochester in the following manner. Chiffinch was an inordinate drinker, and
  satisfied he could turn this failing to account, the earl went into the ball
  where he was stationed, and after a little conversation, called for a flask
  of wine. It was brought, and while they were quaffing bumpers, Pillichody,
  who had entered unperceived, contrived to open a table-drawer in which the
  keys were placed, and slip them noiselessly into his doublet. He then stole
  away, and delivered his prize to Blaize, receiving in return the promised
  reward, and chuckling to himself at the success of his roguery. The keys were
  conveyed by the porter to Leonard, and the latter handed them in his turn to
  John Lutcombe, who engaged to have the horses at the lower end of the south
  avenue an hour before midnight.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch3-9"
     name="ch3-9">IX. &mdash; KINGSTON LISLE.</a></h2>

  <p>About half-past ten, and when it was supposed that the king and his
  courtiers had retired to rest (for early hours were kept in those days), Mrs.
  Buscot and Leonard repaired to Amabel's chamber. The good housekeeper noticed
  with great uneasiness that her niece looked excessively pale and agitated,
  and she would have persuaded her to abandon all idea of flight, if she had
  not feared that her stay might be attended with still worse consequences.</p>

  <p>Before the party set out, Mrs. Buscot crept down stairs to see that all
  was safe, and returned almost instantly, with the very satisfactory
  intelligence that Chiffinch was snoring in a chair in the hall, and that the
  usher had probably retired to rest, as he was nowhere to be seen. Not a
  moment, therefore, was to be lost, and they descended the great staircase as
  noiselessly as possible. So far all had gone well; but on gaining the hall,
  Amabel's strength completely deserted her, and if Leonard had not caught her
  in his arms, she must have fallen. He was hurrying forward with his burden
  towards a passage on the right, when Chiffinch, who had been disturbed by the
  noise, suddenly started to his feet, and commanded him to stop. At this
  moment, a figure enveloped in a cloak darted from behind a door, and
  extinguishing the lamp which Chiffinch had taken from the table, seized him
  with a powerful grasp. All was now buried in darkness, and while Leonard Holt
  was hesitating what to do, he heard a voice, which he knew to be that of
  Pillichody, whisper in his ear, "Come with me&mdash;I will secure your
  retreat. Quick! quick!"</p>

  <p>Suffering himself to be drawn along, and closely followed by Nizza
  Macascree and Mrs. Buscot, Leonard crossed the dining-chamber, not without
  stumbling against some of the furniture by the way, and through an open
  window into the court, where he found Blaize awaiting him. Without waiting
  for thanks, Pillichody then disappeared, and Mrs. Buscot, having pointed out
  the course he ought to pursue, bade him farewell.</p>

  <p>Hurrying across the court, he reached the south avenue, but had not
  proceeded far when it became evident, from the lights at the windows, as well
  as from the shouts and other noises proceeding from the court, that their
  flight was discovered. Encumbered as he was by his lovely burden, Leonard ran
  on so swiftly, that Nizza Macascree and Blaize could scarcely keep up with
  him. They found John Lutcombe at the end of the avenue with the horses, and
  mounting them, set off along the downs, accompanied by the keeper, who acted
  as their guide. Striking off on the right, they came to a spot covered over
  with immense grey stones, resembling those rocky fragments used by the Druids
  in the construction of a cromlech, and, as it was quite dark, it required
  some caution in passing through them. Guided by the keeper, who here took
  hold of the bridle of his horse, Leonard threaded the pass with safety; but
  Blaize was not equally fortunate. Alarmed by the sounds in the rear, and not
  attending to the keeper's caution, he urged his horse on, and the animal
  coming in contact with a stone, stumbled, and precipitated him and Nizza
  Macascree to the ground. Luckily, neither of them fell against the stone, or
  the consequences might have been fatal. John Lutcombe instantly flew to their
  aid, but before he reached them, Nizza Macascree had regained her feet.
  Blaize, however, who was considerably shaken and bruised by the fall, was not
  quite so expeditious, and his dilatoriness so provoked the keeper, that,
  seizing him in his arms, he lifted him into the saddle. Just as Nizza
  Macascree was placed on the pillion behind him, the tramp of horses was heard
  rapidly approaching. In another moment their pursuers came up, and the
  foremost, whose tones proclaimed him the Earl of Rochester, commanded them to
  stop. Inexpressibly alarmed, Amabel could not repress a scream, and guided by
  the sound, the earl dashed to her side, and seized the bridle of her
  steed.</p>

  <p>A short struggle took place between him and Leonard, in which the hitter
  strove to break away; but the earl, drawing his sword, held it to his
  throat.</p>

  <p>"Deliver up your mistress instantly," he cried, in a menacing tone, "or
  you are a dead man."</p>

  <p>Leonard returned a peremptory refusal.</p>

  <p>"Hold!" exclaimed Amabel, springing from the horse; "I will not be the
  cause of bloodshed. I implore you, my lord, to desist from this outrage. You
  will gain nothing by it but my death."</p>

  <p>"Let him touch you at his peril," cried John Lutcombe, rushing towards
  them, and interposing his stalwart person between her and the earl.</p>

  <p>"Stand aside, dog!" cried Rochester furiously, "or I will trample you
  beneath my horse's hoofs."</p>

  <p>"You must first get near me to do it," rejoined the keeper. And as he
  spoke he struck the horse so violent a blow with a stout oaken cudgel with
  which he was provided, that the animal became unmanageable, and dashed across
  the downs to some distance with his rider.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Parravicin having ridden up with Pillichody (for they proved to
  be the earl's companions) assailed Blaize, and commanded him to deliver up
  Nizza Macascree. Scared almost out of his senses, the porter would have
  instantly complied, if the piper's daughter had not kept fast hold of him,
  and reproaching him with his cowardice, screamed loudly for help. Heedless of
  her cries, Parravicin seized her, and strove to drag her from the horse; but
  she only clung the closer to Blaize, and the other, expecting every moment to
  pay another visit to the ground, added his vociferations for assistance to
  hers.</p>

  <p>"Leave go your hold," he cried, to Pillichody, who had seized him on the
  other side by the collar. "Leave go, I say, or you will rend my jerkin
  asunder. What are you doing here? I thought you were to help us to
  escape."</p>

  <p>"So I have done," rejoined Pillichody, bursting into a loud laugh; "and I
  am now helping to catch you again. What a blind buzzard you must be not to
  perceive the net spread for you! Deliver up Nizza Macascree without more ado,
  or, by all the fiends, I will pay you off for your dastardly assault upon me
  this morning."</p>

  <p>"I cannot deliver her up," cried Blaize; "she sticks to me as fast as a
  burr. I shall be torn asunder between you. Help! help!"</p>

  <p>Parravicin, having dismounted, now tore away Nizza Macascree, and was just
  about to transfer her to his own steed, when John Lutcombe, having driven
  away the earl in the manner before described, came to the rescue. One blow
  from his cudgel stretched the knight on the sod, and liberated Nizza
  Macascree, who instantly flew to her preserver. Finding how matters stood,
  and that he was likely to be well backed, Blaize plucked up his courage, and
  grappled with Pillichody. In the struggle they both tumbled to the ground.
  The keeper rushed towards them, and seizing Pillichody, began to belabour him
  soundly. In vain the bully implored mercy. He underwent a severe
  chastisement, and Blaize added a few kicks to the shower of blows proceeding
  from the keeper, crying, as he dealt them, "Who is the buzzard now, I should
  like to know?"</p>

  <p>By this time, Parravicin had regained his legs, and the Earl of Rochester
  having forced back his steed, both drew their swords, and, burning for
  vengeance, prepared to renew the charge. The affair might have assumed a
  serious aspect, if it had not chanced that at this juncture lights were seen
  hurrying along the avenue, and the next moment, a large party issued from
  it.</p>

  <p>"It is the king?" cried Rochester. "What is to be done?"</p>

  <p>"Our prey must be abandoned," rejoined Parravicin; "it will never do to be
  caught here."</p>

  <p>With this he sprang upon his steed, and disappeared across the downs with
  the earl.</p>

  <p>John Lutcombe, on perceiving the approach of the torch-bearers, instantly
  abandoned Pillichody, and assisting Blaize to the saddle, placed Nizza behind
  him. Leonard, likewise, who had dismounted to support Amabel, replaced her in
  the pillion, and in a few seconds the party were in motion. Pillichody, who
  was the only person now left, did not care to wait for the king's arrival,
  but snatching the bridle of his steed, which was quietly grazing at a little
  distance, mounted him, and galloped off in the direction which he fancied had
  been taken by the earl and his companion.</p>

  <p>Guided by the keeper, who ran beside them, the fugitives proceeded for a
  couple of miles at a rapid pace over the downs, when, it not appearing that
  they were followed, John Lutcombe halted for a moment to recover breath. The
  fresh air had in some degree revived Amabel, and the circumstance of their
  providential deliverance raised the spirits of the whole party. Soon after
  this, they reached the ridge of the downs, the magnificent view from which
  was completely hidden by the shades of night, and, tracking the old Roman
  road for about a mile, descended the steep hill in the direction of the
  Blowing Stone. Skirting a thick grove of trees, they presently came to a
  gate, which the keeper opened, and led them through an orchard towards what
  appeared to be in the gloom a moderately-sized and comfortable
  habitation.</p>

  <p>"The owner of this house, Mrs. Compton," observed John Lutcombe to Amabel,
  "is a widow, and the kindest lady in Berkshire. A message has been sent by
  your aunt to beg her to afford you an asylum for a few days, and I will
  answer for it you will be hospitably received."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, the loud barking of a dog was heard, and an old grey-headed
  butler was seen advancing towards them with a lantern in his hand. At the
  same time a groom issued from the stable on the right, accompanied by the dog
  in question, and, hastening towards them, assisted them to dismount. The dog
  seemed to recognise the keeper, and leaped upon him, licked his hand, and
  exhibited other symptoms of delight.</p>

  <p>"What, Ringwood," cried the keeper, patting his head, "dost thou know thy
  old master again? I see you have taken good care of him, Sam," he added to
  the groom. "I knew I was placing him into good hands when I gave him to Mrs.
  Compton."</p>

  <p>"Ay, ay, he can't find a better home, I fancy," said the groom.</p>

  <p>"Will it please you to walk this way, ladies?" interposed the butler. "My
  mistress has been expecting you for some time, and had become quite uneasy
  about you." So saying, he led the way through a garden, filled with the
  odours of a hundred unseen flowers, and ushered them into the house.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Compton, an elderly lady, of very pleasing exterior, received them
  with great kindness, and conducted them to a comfortable apartment,
  surrounded with book-shelves and old family portraits, where refreshments
  were spread out for them. The good old lady seemed particularly interested in
  Amabel, and pressed her, but in vain, to partake of the refreshments. With
  extreme delicacy, she refrained from inquiring into the cause of their visit,
  and seeing that they appeared, much fatigued, rang for a female attendant,
  and conducted them to a sleeping-chamber, where she took leave of them for
  the night. Amabel was delighted with her kind hostess, and, contrary to her
  expectations and to those of Nizza Macascree, enjoyed undisturbed repose. She
  awoke in the morning greatly refreshed, and, after attiring herself, gazed
  through her chamber window. It looked upon a trim and beautiful garden, with
  a green and mossy plot carved out into quaintly-fashioned beds, filled with
  the choicest flowers, and surrounded by fine timber, amid which a tall
  fir-tree appeared proudly conspicuous. Mrs. Compton, who, it appeared, always
  arose with the sun, was busied in tending her flowers, and as Amabel watched
  her interesting pursuits, she could scarcely help envying her.</p>

  <p>"What a delightful life your mistress must lead," she observed to a female
  attendant who was present; "I cannot imagine greater happiness than
  hers."</p>

  <p>"My mistress ought to be happy," said the attendant; "for there is no one
  living who does more good. Not a cottage nor a farm-house in the
  neighbourhood but she visits to inquire whether she can be of any service to
  its inmates; and wherever her services <i>are</i> required, they are always
  rendered. Mrs. Compton's name will never be forgotten in Kingston Lisle."</p>

  <p>At this moment, Amabel caught sight of the benevolent countenance of the
  good old lady looking up at the window, and a kindly greeting passed between
  them. Ringwood, who was a privileged intruder, was careering round the
  garden, and though his mistress watched his gambols round her favourite
  flower-beds with some anxiety, she did not check him. Amabel and Nizza now
  went down stairs, and Mrs. Compton returning from the garden, all the
  household, including Leonard and Blaize, assembled in the breakfast-room for
  morning prayers.</p>

  <p>Breakfast over, Mrs. Compton entered into conversation with Amabel, and
  ascertained all the particulars of her history. She was greatly interested in
  it, but did not affect to conceal the anxiety it gave her.</p>

  <p>"Yours is really a very dangerous position," she said, "and I should be
  acting unfairly towards you if I told you otherwise. However, I will give you
  all the protection in my power, and I trust your retreat may not be
  discovered."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Compton's remark did not tend to dispel Amabel's uneasiness, and both
  she and Nizza Macascree passed a day of great disquietude.</p>

  <p>In the mean time, Leonard and Blaize were treated with great hospitality
  by the old butler in the servants' hall; and though the former was not
  without apprehension that their retreat might be discovered, he trusted, if
  it were so, to some fortunate chance to effect their escape. He did not dare
  to confide his apprehensions to the butler, nor did the other make any
  inquiries; but it being understood that their visit was to be secret, every
  precaution was taken to keep it so. John Lutcombe had tarried no longer than
  enabled him to discuss a jug of ale, and then set out for Ashdown, promising
  to return on the following day; but he had not yet made his appearance.
  Evening arrived, and nothing alarming having occurred, all became
  comparatively easy; and Mrs. Compton herself, who had looked unusually grave
  throughout the day, now recovered her wonted cheerfulness.</p>

  <p>Their satisfaction, however, was not long afterwards disturbed by the
  arrival of a large train of horsemen at the gate, and a stately personage
  alighted, and walked at the head of a gallant train, towards the house. At
  the sight of the new-comers, whom they instantly knew were the king and his
  suite, Amabel and Nizza Macascree flew upstairs, and shutting themselves in
  their chamber, awaited the result in the utmost trepidation. They were not
  kept long in suspense. Shortly after the king's arrival, Mrs. Compton herself
  knocked at the door, and in a tone of deep commiseration, informed Amabel
  that his majesty desired to see her.</p>

  <p>Knowing that refusal was impossible, Amabel complied, and descended to a
  room looking upon the garden, in which she found the king. He was attended
  only by Chiffinch, and received her with a somewhat severe aspect, and
  demanded why she had left Ashdown contrary to his express injunctions?</p>

  <p>Amabel stated her motives.</p>

  <p>"What you tell me is by no means satisfactory," rejoined the king; "but
  since you have chosen to trust to yourself, you can no longer look for
  protection from me."</p>

  <p>"I beseech your majesty to consider the strait into which I was driven,"
  returned Amabel, imploringly.</p>

  <p>"Summon the Earl of Rochester to the presence," said the king, turning
  from her to Chiffinch.</p>

  <p>"In pity, sire," cried Amabel, throwing herself at his feet.</p>

  <p>"Let the injunction be obeyed," rejoined Charles, peremptorily.</p>

  <p>And the chief page departed.</p>

  <p>Amabel instantly arose, and drew herself proudly up. Soon afterwards,
  Rochester made his appearance, and on seeing Amabel, a flush of triumphant
  joy overspread his features.</p>

  <p>"I withdraw my interdiction, my lord," said the king to him. "You are at
  liberty to renew your suit to this girl."</p>

  <p>"Hear me, Lord Rochester," said Amabel, addressing the earl; "I have
  conquered the passion I once felt for you, and regard you only as one who has
  sought my ruin, and from whom I have fortunately escaped. When you learn from
  my own lips that my heart is dead to you, that I never can love you more, and
  that I only desire to be freed from your addresses, I cannot doubt but you
  will discontinue them."</p>

  <p>"Your declaration only inflames me the more, lovely Amabel," replied the
  earl, passionately. "You must, and shall be mine."</p>

  <p>"Then my death will rest at your door," she rejoined.</p>

  <p>"I will take my chance of that," rejoined the earl, carelessly.</p>

  <p>Amabel then quitted the king's presence, and returned to her own chamber,
  where she found Nizza Macascree in a state of indescribable agitation.</p>

  <p>"All has happened that I anticipated," said she to Nizza Macascree. "The
  king will no longer protect me, and I am exposed to the persecutions of the
  Earl of Rochester, who is here."</p>

  <p>As she spoke, an usher entered, and informed Nizza Macascree that the king
  commanded her presence. The piper's daughter looked at Amabel with a glance
  of unutterable anguish.</p>

  <p>"I fear you must go," said Amabel, "but Heaven will protect you!"</p>

  <p>They then tenderly embraced each other, and Nizza Macascree departed with
  the usher.</p>

  <p>Some time having elapsed, and Nizza not returning, Amabel became seriously
  uneasy. Hearing a noise below, she looked forth from the window, and
  perceived the king and all his train departing. A terrible foreboding shot
  through her heart. She gazed anxiously after them, but could not perceive
  Nizza Macascree. Overcome at last by her anxiety, she rushed down stairs, and
  had just reached the last step, when she was seized by two persons. A shawl
  was passed over her head, and she was forced out of the house.</p>

  <h2><a id="bk4"
     name="bk4">BOOK THE FOURTH &mdash; SEPTEMBER, 1665.</a></h2>

  <h2>I. &mdash; THE PLAGUE AT ITS HEIGHT</h2>

  <p>Amabel's departure for Berkshire caused no change in her father's mode of
  life. Everything proceeded as before within his quiet dwelling; and, except
  that the family were diminished in number, all appeared the same. It is true
  they wanted the interest, and indeed the occupation, afforded them by the
  gentle invalid, but in other respects, no difference was observable.
  Devotional exercises, meals, the various duties of the house, and cheerful
  discourse, filled up the day, which never proved wearisome. The result proved
  the correctness of Mr. Bloundel's judgment. While the scourge continued
  weekly to extend its ravages throughout the city, it never crossed his
  threshold; and, except suffering in a slight degree from scorbutic
  affections, occasioned by the salt meats to which they were now confined, and
  for which the lemon and lime-juice, provided against such a contingency,
  proved an efficacious remedy, all the family enjoyed perfect health. For some
  weeks after her separation from her daughter, Mrs. Bloundel continued in a
  desponding state, but after that time she became more reconciled to the
  deprivation, and partially recovered her spirits. Mr. Bloundel did not dare
  to indulge a hope that Amabel would ever return; but though he suffered much
  in secret, he never allowed his grief to manifest itself. The circumstance
  that he had not received any intelligence of her did not weigh much with him,
  because the difficulty of communication became greater and greater, as each
  week the scourge increased in violence, and he was inclined to take no news
  as good news. It was not so in the present case, but of this he was happily
  ignorant.</p>

  <p>In this way, a month passed on. And now every other consideration was
  merged in the alarm occasioned by the daily increasing fury of the
  pestilence. Throughout July the excessive heat of the weather underwent no
  abatement, but in place of the clear atmosphere that had prevailed during the
  preceding month, unwholesome blights filled the air, and, confining the
  pestilential effluvia, spread the contagion far and wide with extraordinary
  rapidity. Not only was the city suffocated with heat, but filled with noisome
  smells, arising from the carcasses with which the close alleys and other
  out-of-the-way places were crowded, and which were so far decomposed as not
  to be capable of removal. The aspect of the river was as much changed as that
  of the city. Numbers of bodies were thrown into it, and, floating up with the
  tide, were left to taint the air on its banks, while strange, ill-omened
  fowl, attracted thither by their instinct, preyed upon them. Below the
  bridge, all captains of ships moored in the Pool, or off Wapping, held as
  little communication as possible with those on shore, and only received fresh
  provisions with the greatest precaution. As the plague increased, most of
  these removed lower down the river, and many of them put out entirely to sea.
  Above the bridge, most of the wherries and other smaller craft had
  disappeared, their owners having taken them up the river, and moored them
  against its banks at different spots, where they lived in them under tilts.
  Many hundreds of persons remained upon the river in this way during the whole
  continuance of the visitation.</p>

  <p>August had now arrived, but the distemper knew no cessation. On the
  contrary, it manifestly increased in violence and malignity. The deaths rose
  a thousand in each week, and in the last week in this fatal month amounted to
  upwards of sixty thousand!</p>

  <p>But, terrible as this was, the pestilence had not yet reached its height.
  Hopes were entertained that when the weather became cooler, its fury would
  abate; but these anticipations were fearfully disappointed. The bills of
  mortality rose the first week in September to seven thousand, and though they
  slightly decreased during the second week&mdash;awakening a momentary
  hope&mdash;on the third they advanced to twelve thousand! In less than ten
  days, upwards of two thousand persons perished in the parish of Aldgate
  alone; while Whitechapel suffered equally severely. Out of the hundred
  parishes in and about the city, one only, that of Saint John the Evangelist
  in Watling-street, remained uninfected, and this merely because there was
  scarcely a soul left within it, the greater part of the inhabitants having
  quitted their houses, and fled into the country.</p>

  <p>The deepest despair now seized upon all the survivors. Scarcely a family
  but had lost half of its number&mdash;many, more than half&mdash;while those
  who were left felt assured that their turn would speedily arrive. Even the
  reckless were appalled, and abandoned their evil courses. Not only were the
  dead lying in the passages and alleys, but even in the main thoroughfares,
  and none would remove them. The awful prediction of Solomon Eagle that "grass
  would grow in the streets, and that the living should not be able to bury the
  dead," had come to pass. London had become one vast lazar-house, and seemed
  in a fair way of becoming a mighty sepulchre.</p>

  <p>During all this time, Saint Paul's continued to be used as a pest-house,
  but it was not so crowded as heretofore, because, as not one in fifty of the
  infected recovered when placed under medical care, it was not thought worth
  while to remove them from their own abodes. The number of attendants, too,
  had diminished. Some had died, but the greater part had abandoned their
  offices from a fear of sharing the fate of their patients. In consequence of
  these changes, Judith Malmayns had been advanced to the post of chief nurse
  at the cathedral. Both she and Chowles had been attacked by the plague, and
  both had recovered. Judith attended the coffin-maker, and it was mainly owing
  to her that he got through the attack. She never left him for a moment, and
  would never suffer any one to approach him&mdash;a necessary precaution, as
  he was so much alarmed by his situation that he would infallibly have made
  some awkward revelations. When Judith, in her turn, was seized, Chowles
  exhibited no such consideration for her, and scarcely affected to conceal his
  disappointment at her recovery. This want of feeling on his part greatly
  incensed her against him, and though he contrived in some degree to appease
  her, it was long before she entirely forgave him. Far from being amended by
  her sufferings, she seemed to have grown more obdurate, and instantly
  commenced a fresh career of crime. It was not, however, necessary now to
  hasten the end of the sick. The distemper had acquired such force and
  malignity that it did its work quickly enough&mdash;often too
  quickly&mdash;and all she sought was to obtain possession of the poor
  patients' attire, or any valuables they might possess worth appropriating. To
  turn to the brighter side of the picture, it must not be omitted that when
  the pestilence was at its height, and no offers could induce the timorous to
  venture forth, or render assistance to the sufferers, Sir John Lawrence the
  Lord Mayor, the Duke of Albermarle, the Earl of Craven, and the Archbishop of
  Canterbury, devoted themselves to the care of the infected, and supplied them
  with every necessary they required. Among the physicians, no one deserves
  more honourable mention than Doctor Hodges, who was unremitting in his
  attentions to the sufferers.</p>

  <p>To return to the grocer. While the plague was thus raging around him, and
  while every house in Wood-street except one or two, from which the inmates
  had fled, was attacked by the pestilence, he and his family had remained
  untouched. About the middle of August, he experienced a great alarm. His
  second son, Hubert, fell sick, and he removed him to one of the upper rooms
  which he had set aside as an hospital, and attended upon him himself. In a
  few days, however, his fears were removed and he found, to his great
  satisfaction, that the youth had not been attacked by the plague, but was
  only suffering from a slight fever, which quickly yielded to the remedies
  applied. About the same time, too, he lost his porter, Dallison. The poor
  fellow did not make his appearance as usual for two days, and intelligence of
  his fate was brought on the following day by his wife, who came to state that
  her husband was dead, and had been thrown into the plague-pit at Aldgate. The
  same night, however, she brought another man, named Allestry, who took the
  place of the late porter, and acquainted his employer with the deplorable
  state of the city.</p>

  <p>Two days afterwards, Allestry himself died, and Mr. Bloundel had no one to
  replace him. He thus lost all means of ascertaining what was going forward;
  but the deathlike stillness around him, broken only by the hoarse tolling of
  a bell, by a wild shriek or other appalling cry, proclaimed too surely the
  terrible state of things. Sometimes, too, a passenger would go by, and would
  tell him the dreadful height to which the bills of mortality had risen,
  assuring him that ere another month had expired, not a soul would be left
  alive in London.</p>

  <p>One night, as Solomon Eagle, who had likewise been miraculously preserved,
  pursued his course through the streets, he paused before Mr. Roundel's house,
  and looking up at the window, at which the latter had chanced to be
  stationed, cried in a loud voice, "Be of good cheer. You have served God
  faithfully, and there shall no evil befall you, neither shall the plague come
  nigh your dwelling." And raising his arms, as if invoking a blessing upon the
  habitation, he departed.</p>

  <p>It was now the second week in September, and as yet Mr. Bloundel had
  received no tidings of his daughter. At any other season he would have been
  seriously uneasy, but now, as has been already stated, all private grief was
  swallowed up in the horror of the general calamity. Satisfied that she was in
  a healthful situation, and that her chance of preservation from the
  pestilence was better than that of any other member of his family, he turned
  his thoughts entirely to them. Redoubling his precautions, he tried by every
  means to keep up the failing spirits of his household, and but rarely
  ventured to open his shutter, and look forth on the external world.</p>

  <p>On the tenth of September, which was afterwards accounted the most fatal
  day of this fatal month, a young man of a very dejected appearance, and
  wearing the traces of severe suffering in his countenance, entered the west
  end of London, and took his way slowly towards the city. He had passed Saint
  Giles's without seeing a single living creature, or the sign of one in any of
  the houses. The broad thoroughfare was completely grown over with grass, and
  the habitations had the most melancholy and deserted air imaginable. Some
  doors and windows were wide open, discovering rooms with goods and furniture
  scattered about, having been left in this state by their inmates; but most
  part of them were closely fastened up.</p>

  <p>As he proceeded along Holborn, the ravages of the scourge were yet more
  apparent. Every house, on either side of the way, had a red cross, with the
  fatal inscription above it, upon the door. Here and there, a watchman might
  be seen, looking more like a phantom than a living thing. Formerly, the dead
  were conveyed away at night, but now the carts went about in the daytime. On
  reaching Saint Andrew's, Holborn, several persons were seen wheeling
  hand-barrows filled with corpses, scarcely covered with clothing, and
  revealing the blue and white stripes of the pestilence, towards a cart which
  was standing near the church gates. The driver of the vehicle, a tall,
  cadaverous-looking man, was ringing his bell, and jesting with another
  person, whom the young man recognised, with a shudder, as Chowles. The
  coffin-maker also recognised him at the same moment, and called to him, but
  the other paid no attention to the summons and passed on.</p>

  <p>Crossing Holborn Bridge, he toiled faintly up the opposite hill, for he
  was evidently suffering from extreme debility, and on gaining the summit was
  obliged to support himself against a wall for a few minutes, before he could
  proceed. The same frightful evidences of the ravages of the pestilence were
  observable here, as elsewhere. The houses were all marked with the fatal
  cross, and shut up. Another dead-cart was heard rumbling along, accompanied
  by the harsh cries of the driver, and the doleful ringing of the bell. The
  next moment the loathly vehicle was seen coming along the Old Bailey. It
  paused before a house, from which four bodies were brought, and then passed
  on towards Smithfield. Watching its progress with fearful curiosity, the
  young man noted how often it paused to increase its load. His thoughts,
  coloured by the scene, were of the saddest and dreariest complexion. All
  around wore the aspect of death. The few figures in sight seemed staggering
  towards the grave, and the houses appeared to be plague-stricken like the
  inhabitants. The heat was intolerably oppressive, and the air tainted with
  noisome exhalations. Ever and anon, a window would be opened, and a ghastly
  face thrust from it, while a piercing shriek, or lamentable cry, was uttered.
  No business seemed going on&mdash;there were no passengers&mdash;no vehicles
  in the streets. The mighty city was completely laid prostrate.</p>

  <p>After a short rest, the young man shaped his course towards Saint Paul's,
  and on reaching its western precincts, gazed for some time at the reverend
  structure, as if its contemplation called up many and painful recollections.
  Tears started to his eyes, and he was about to turn away, when he perceived
  the figure of Solomon Eagle stationed near the cross at the western extremity
  of the roof. The enthusiast caught sight of him at the same moment, and
  motioned him to come nearer. "What has happened?" he demanded, as the other
  approached the steps of the portico.</p>

  <p>The young man shook his head mournfully. "It is a sad tale," he said, "and
  cannot be told now."</p>

  <p>"I can conjecture what it is," replied Solomon Eagle. "But come to the
  small door near the northern entrance of the cathedral at midnight. I will
  meet you there."</p>

  <p>"I will not fail," replied the young man.</p>

  <p>"One of the terrible judgments which I predicted would befall this devoted
  city has come to pass," cried Solomon Eagle. "Another yet remains&mdash;the
  judgment by fire&mdash;and if its surviving inhabitants repent not, of which
  there is as yet no sign, it will assuredly follow."</p>

  <p>"Heaven avert it!" groaned the other, turning away.</p>

  <p>Proceeding along Cheapside, he entered Wood-street, and took his way
  towards the grocer's dwelling. When at a little distance from it, he paused,
  and some minutes elapsed before he could muster strength to go forward. Here,
  as elsewhere, there were abundant indications of the havoc occasioned by the
  fell disease. Not far from the grocer's shop, and in the middle of the
  street, lay the body of a man, with the face turned upwards, while crouching
  in an angle of the wall sat a young woman watching it. As the young man drew
  nearer, he recognised in the dead man the principal of the Brotherhood of
  Saint Michael, and in the poor mourner one of his profligate female
  associates. "What has become of your unhappy companions?" he demanded of the
  woman.</p>

  <p>"The last of them lies there," she rejoined mournfully. "All the rest died
  long ago. My lover was true to his vow; and instead of deploring their fate,
  lived with me and three other women in mirth and revelry till yesterday, when
  the three women died, and he fell sick. He did not, however, give in, but
  continued carousing until an hour before his death."</p>

  <p>Too much shocked to make any reply, the young man proceeded towards the
  hutch. Beneath a doorway, at a little distance from it, sat a watchman with a
  halberd on his shoulder, guarding the house; but it was evident he would be
  of little further use. His face was covered with his hands, and his groans
  proclaimed that he himself was attacked by the pestilence. Entering the
  hutch, the young man pulled the cord of the bell, and the summons was soon
  after answered by the grocer, who appeared at the window. "What, Leonard
  Holt!" he exclaimed, in surprise, on seeing the young man&mdash;"is it
  you?&mdash;what ails you?&mdash;you look frightfully ill."</p>

  <p>"I have been attacked a second time by the plague," replied the
  apprentice, "and am only just recovered from it."</p>

  <p>"What of my child?" cried the grocer eagerly&mdash;"what of her?"</p>

  <p>"Alas! alas!" exclaimed the apprentice.</p>

  <p>"Do not keep me in suspense," rejoined the grocer. "Is she dead?"</p>

  <p>"No, not dead," replied the apprentice, "but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But what?" ejaculated the grocer. "In Heaven's name, speak!"</p>

    <p class="caption">Leonard Holt Conveying the Packet to the Grocer</p>
</div>

  <p>"These letters will tell you all," replied the apprentice, producing a
  packet. "I had prepared them to send to you in case of my death. I am not
  equal to further explanation now."</p>

  <p>With trembling eagerness the grocer lowered the rope, and Leonard having
  tied the packet to it, it was instantly drawn up. Notwithstanding his anxiety
  to ascertain the fate of Amabel, Mr. Bloundel would not touch the packet
  until he had guarded against the possibility of being infected by it. Seizing
  it with a pair of tongs, he plunged it into a pan containing a strong
  solution of vinegar and sulphur, which he had always in readiness in the
  chamber, and when thoroughly saturated, laid it in the sun to dry. On first
  opening the shutter to answer Leonard's summons, he had flashed off a pistol,
  and he now thought to expel the external air by setting fire to a ball
  composed of quick brimstone, saltpetre, and yellow amber, which being placed
  on an iron plate, speedily filled the room with a thick vapour, and prevented
  the entrance of any obnoxious particles. These precautions taken, he again
  addressed himself, while the packet was drying, to Leonard, whom he found
  gazing anxiously at the window, and informed him that all his family had
  hitherto escaped contagion.</p>

  <p>"A special providence must have watched over you, sir," replied the
  apprentice, "and I believe yours is the only family in the whole city that
  has been so spared. I have reason to be grateful for my own extraordinary
  preservation, and yet I would rather it had pleased Heaven to take me away
  than leave me to my present misery."</p>

  <p>"You keep me in a frightful state of suspense, Leonard," rejoined the
  grocer, regarding the packet wistfully, "for I dare not open your letters
  till they are thoroughly fumigated. You assure me my child is living. Has she
  been attacked by the plague?"</p>

  <p>"Would she had!" groaned Leonard.</p>

  <p>"Is she still at Ashdown?" pursued the grocer. "Ah! you shake your head. I
  see!&mdash;I must be beside myself not to have thought of it before. She is
  in the power of the Earl of Rochester."</p>

  <p>"She is," cried Leonard, catching at the angle of the shed for
  support.</p>

  <p>"And I am here!" exclaimed Mr. Bloundel, forgetting his caution, and
  thrusting himself far out of the window, as if with the intention of letting
  himself down by the rope&mdash;"I am here, when I ought to be near her!"</p>

  <p>"Calm yourself, I beseech you, sir," cried Leonard; "a moment's rashness
  will undo all you have done."</p>

  <p>"True!" replied the grocer, checking himself. "I must think of others as
  well as of her. But where is she? Hide nothing from me."</p>

  <p>"I have reason to believe she is in London," replied the apprentice. "I
  traced her hither, and should not have desisted from my search if I had not
  been checked by the plague, which attacked me on the night of my arrival. I
  was taken to the pesthouse near Westbourne Green, where I have been for the
  last three weeks."</p>

  <p>"If she was brought to London, as you state," rejoined the grocer, "I
  cannot doubt but she has fallen a victim to the scourge."</p>

  <p>"It may be," replied Leonard, moodily, "and I would almost hope it is so.
  When you peruse my letters, you will learn that she was carried off by the
  earl from the residence of a lady at Kingston Lisle, whither she had been
  removed for safety; and after being taken from place to place, was at last
  conveyed to an old hall in the neighbourhood of Oxford, where she was
  concealed for nearly a month."</p>

  <p>"Answer me, Leonard," cried the grocer, "and do not attempt to deceive me.
  Has she preserved her honour?"</p>

  <p>"Up to the time of quitting Oxford she had preserved it," replied the
  apprentice. "She herself assured me she had resisted all the earl's
  importunities, and would die rather than yield to him. But I will tell you
  how I obtained an interview with her. After a long search, I discovered the
  place of her concealment, the old hall I have just mentioned, and climbed in
  the night, and at the hazard of my life, to the window of the chamber where
  she was confined. I saw and spoke with her; and having arranged a plan by
  which I hoped to accomplish her deliverance on the following night,
  descended. Whether our brief conference was overheard, and communicated to
  the earl, I know not; but it would seem so, for he secretly departed with her
  the next morning, taking the road, as I subsequently learnt, to London. I
  instantly started in pursuit, and had reached Paddington, when I fell ill, as
  I have related."</p>

  <p>"What you tell me in some measure eases my mind," replied Mr. Bloundel,
  after a pause; "for I feel that my daughter, if alive, will be able to resist
  her persecutor. What has become of your companions?"</p>

  <p>"Nizza Macascree has met with the same fate as Amabel," replied Leonard.
  "She was unfortunate enough to attract the king's attention, when he visited
  Ashdown Lodge in company of the Earl of Rochester, and was conveyed to
  Oxford, where the court is now held, and must speedily have fallen a victim
  to her royal lover if she had not disappeared, having been carried off, it
  was supposed, by Sir Paul Parravicin. But the villain was frustrated in his
  infamous design. The king's suspicion falling upon him, he was instantly
  arrested; and though he denied all knowledge of Nizza's retreat, and was
  afterwards liberated, his movements were so strictly watched, that he had no
  opportunity of visiting her."</p>

  <p>"You do not mention Blaize," said Mr. Bloundel. "No ill, I trust, has
  befallen him?"</p>

  <p>"I grieve to say he has been attacked by the distemper he so much
  dreaded," replied Leonard. "He accompanied me to London, but quitted me when
  I fell sick, and took refuge with a farmer named Wingfield, residing near
  Kensal Green. I accidentally met Wingfield this morning, and he informed me
  that Blaize was taken ill the day before yesterday, and removed to the
  pest-house in Finsbury Fields. I will go thither presently, and see what has
  become of him. Is Doctor Hodges still among the living?"</p>

  <p>"I trust so," replied Mr. Bloundel, "though I have not seen him for the
  last ten days."</p>

  <p>He then disappeared for a few minutes, and on his return lowered a small
  basket containing a flask of canary, a loaf which he himself had baked, and a
  piece of cold boiled beef. The apprentice thankfully received the provisions,
  and retiring to the hutch, began to discuss them, fortifying himself with a
  copious draught of canary. Having concluded his repast, he issued forth, and
  acquainting Mr. Bloundel, who had at length ventured to commence reading the
  contents of the packet by the aid of powerful glasses, that he was about to
  proceed to Dr. Hodges's residence, to inquire after him, set off in that
  direction.</p>

  <p>Arrived in Great Knightrider-street, he was greatly shocked at finding the
  door of the doctor's habitation fastened, nor could he make any one hear,
  though he knocked loudly and repeatedly against it. The shutters of the lower
  windows were closed, and the place looked completely deserted. All the
  adjoining houses were shut up, and not a living being could be discerned in
  the street from whom information could be obtained relative to the physician.
  Here, as elsewhere, the pavement was overgrown with grass, and the very
  houses had a strange and melancholy look, as if sharing in the general
  desolation. On looking down a narrow street leading to the river, Leonard
  perceived a flock of poultry scratching among the staves in search of food,
  and instinctively calling them, they flew towards him, as if delighted at the
  unwonted sound of a human voice. These, and a half-starved cat, were the only
  things living that he could perceive. At the further end of the street he
  caught sight of the river, speeding in its course towards the bridge, and
  scarcely knowing whither he was going, sauntered to its edge. The tide had
  just turned, and the stream was sparkling in the sunshine, but no craft could
  be discovered upon its bosom; and except a few barges moored to its sides,
  all vestiges of the numberless vessels with which it was once crowded were
  gone. Its quays were completely deserted. Boxes and bales of goods lay
  untouched on the wharves; the cheering cries with which the workmen formerly
  animated their labour were hushed. There was no sound of creaking cords, no
  rattle of heavy chains&mdash;none of the busy hum ordinarily attending the
  discharge of freight from a vessel, or the packing of goods and stores on
  board. All traffic was at an end; and this scene, usually one of the
  liveliest possible, was now forlorn and desolate. On the opposite shore of
  the river it appeared to be the same&mdash;indeed, the borough of Southwark
  was now suffering the utmost rigour of the scourge, and except for the rows
  of houses on its banks, and the noble bridge by which it was spanned, the
  Thames appeared as undisturbed as it must have been before the great city was
  built upon its banks.</p>

  <p>The apprentice viewed this scene with a singular kind of interest. He had
  become so accustomed to melancholy sights, that his feelings had lost their
  acuteness, and the contemplation of the deserted buildings and neglected
  wharves around him harmonized with his own gloomy thoughts. Pursuing his walk
  along the side of the river, he was checked by a horrible smell, and looking
  downward, he perceived a carcass in the last stage of decomposition lying in
  the mud. It had been washed ashore by the tide, and a large bird of prey was
  contending for the possession of it with a legion of water-rats. Sickened by
  the sight, he turned up a narrow thoroughfare near Baynard's Castle, and
  crossing Thames-street, was about to ascend Addle-hill, when he perceived a
  man wheeling a hand-barrow, containing a couple of corpses, in the direction
  of the river, with the intention, doubtless, of throwing them into it, as the
  readiest means of disposing of them. Both bodies were stripped of their
  clothing, and the blue tint of the nails, as well as the blotches with which
  they were covered, left no doubt as to the disease of which they had died.
  Averting his gaze from the spectacle, Leonard turned off on the right along
  Carter-lane, and threading a short passage, approached the southern boundary
  of the cathedral; and proceeding towards the great door opposite him, passed
  through it. The mighty lazar-house was less crowded than he expected to find
  it, but its terrible condition far exceeded his worst conceptions. Not more
  than half the pallets were occupied; but as the sick were in a great measure
  left to themselves, the utmost disorder prevailed. A troop of lazars, with
  sheets folded around them, glided, like phantoms, along Paul's Walk, and
  mimicked in a ghastly manner the air and deportment of the gallants who had
  formerly thronged the place. No attempt being made to maintain silence, the
  noise was perfectly stunning; some of the sick were shrieking&mdash;some
  laughing in a wild unearthly manner&mdash;some praying&mdash;some uttering
  loud execrations&mdash;others groaning and lamenting. The holy building
  seemed to have become the abode of evil and tormented spirits. Many dead were
  lying in the beds&mdash;the few attendants who were present not caring to
  remove them; and Leonard had little doubt, that before another sun went down
  the whole of the ghastly assemblage before him would share their fate. If the
  habitations he had recently gazed upon had appeared plague-stricken, the
  sacred structure in which he was now standing seemed yet more horribly
  contaminated. Ill-kept and ill-ventilated, the air was loaded with noxious
  effluvia, while the various abominations that met the eye at every turn would
  have been sufficient to produce the distemper in any one who had come in
  contact with them. They were, however, utterly disregarded by the miserable
  sufferers and their attendants. The magnificent painted windows were dimmed
  by a thick clammy steam, which could scarcely be washed off&mdash;while the
  carved oak screens, the sculptured tombs, the pillars, the walls, and the
  flagged floors were covered with impurities.</p>

  <p>Satisfied with a brief survey of this frightful scene, Leonard turned to
  depart, and was passing the entrance to Saint Faith's, which stood open, when
  he caught sight of Judith standing at the foot of the broad stone steps, and
  holding a lamp in her hand. She was conversing with a tall richly-dressed
  man, whose features he fancied he had seen before, though he could not at the
  moment call them to mind. After a brief conversation, they moved off into the
  depths of the vault, and he lost eight of them. All at once it occurred to
  Leonard that Judith's companion was the unfortunate stranger whose child he
  had interred, and who had been so strangely affected at the sight of Nizza
  Macascree. Determined to ascertain the point, he hurried down the steps and
  plunged into the vault. It was buried in profound darkness, and he had not
  proceeded far when he stumbled over something lying in his path, and found
  from the groan that followed that it was a plague-patient. Before he could
  regain his feet, the unfortunate sufferer whom he had thus disturbed implored
  him, in piteous accents, which, with a shudder, he recognised as those of
  Blaize, to remove him. Leonard immediately gave the poor porter to understand
  that he was near him, and would render him every aid in his power.</p>

  <p>"Your assistance comes too late, Leonard," groaned Blaize&mdash;"it's all
  over with me now, but I don't like to breathe my last in this dismal vault,
  without medicine or food, both of which I am denied by that infernal hag
  Mother Malmayns, who calls herself a nurse, but who is in reality a robber
  and murderess. Oh! the frightful scenes I have witnessed since I have been
  brought here! I told you I should not escape the plague. I shall die of
  it&mdash;I am sure I shall."</p>

  <p>"I thought you were at the pest-house in Finsbury Fields," said
  Leonard.</p>

  <p>"I was taken there," replied Blaize; "but the place was full, and they
  would not admit me, so I was sent to Saint Paul's, where there was plenty of
  room. Yesterday I did pretty well, for I was in the great ward above, and one
  of the attendants obeyed my directions implicitly, and I am certain if they
  had been fully carried out, I should have got well. I will tell you what I
  did. As soon as I was placed on a pallet, and covered with blankets, I
  ordered a drink to be prepared of the inner bark of an ash-tree, green
  walnuts, scabious vervain, and saffron, boiled in two quarts of the strongest
  vinegar. Of this mixture I drank plentifully, and it soon produced a
  plentiful perspiration. I next had a hen&mdash;a live one, of
  course&mdash;stripped of the feathers, and brought to me. Its bill was held
  to the large blotch under my arm, and kept there till the fowl died from the
  noxious matter it drew forth. I next repeated the experiment with a pigeon,
  and derived the greatest benefit from it. The tumour had nearly subsided, and
  if I had been properly treated afterwards, I should now be in a fair way of
  recovery. But instead of nice strengthening chicken-broth, flavoured with
  succory and marigolds; or water-gruel, mixed with rosemary and winter-savory;
  or a panado, seasoned with verjuice or wood-sorrel; instead of swallowing
  large draughts of warm beer; or water boiled with carduus seeds; or a posset
  drink, made with sorrel, bugloss, and borage;&mdash;instead of these
  remedies, or any other, I was carried to this horrible place when I was
  asleep, and strapped to my pallet, as you perceive. Unloose me, if you can do
  nothing else."</p>

  <p>"That I will readily do," replied Leonard; "but I must first procure a
  light." With this, he groped his way among the close ranks of ponderous
  pillars, but though he proceeded with the utmost caution, he could not avoid
  coming in contact with the beds of some of the other patients, and disturbing
  them. At length he descried a glimmer of light issuing from a door which he
  knew to be that of the vestry, and which was standing slightly ajar. Opening
  it, he perceived a lamp burning on the table, and without stopping to look
  around him, seized it, and hurried back to the porter. Poor Blaize presented
  a lamentable, and yet grotesque appearance. His plump person was greatly
  reduced in bulk, and his round cheeks had become hollow and cadaverous. He
  was strapped, as he had stated, to the pallet, which in its turn was fastened
  to the adjoining pillar. A blanket was tightly swathed around him, and a
  large cloth was bound round his head in lieu of a nightcap. Leonard instantly
  set about releasing him, and had just unfastened the straps when he heard
  footsteps approaching, and looking up, perceived the stranger and Judith
  Malmayns advancing towards him.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch4-2"
     name="ch4-2">II. &mdash; THE SECOND PLAGUE-PIT.</a></h2>

  <p>Judith, being a little in advance of her companion, took Leonard in the
  first instance for a chirurgeon's assistant, and called to him, in a harsh
  and menacing voice, to let her charge alone. On drawing near, however, she
  perceived her mistake, and recognising the apprentice, halted with a
  disconcerted look. By this time, the stranger had come up, and remarking her
  embarrassment, inquired the cause of it.</p>

  <p>"Look there," cried Judith, pointing towards the apprentice. "Yonder
  stands the very man you seek."</p>

  <p>"What! Leonard Holt," cried the other, in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Ay, Leonard Holt," rejoined Judith. "You can now put any questions to him
  you think proper."</p>

  <p>The stranger did not require the suggestion to be repeated, but instantly
  hastened to the apprentice. "Do you remember me?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Leonard answered in the affirmative. "I owe you a large debt of
  obligation," continued the stranger, "and you shall not find me slow in
  paying it. But let it pass for the moment. Do you know aught of Nizza
  Macascree? I know she was taken to Oxford by the king, and subsequently
  disappeared."</p>

  <p>"Then you know as much as I do of her, sir," rejoined Leonard.</p>

  <p>"I was right, you see, Mr. Thirlby," interposed Judith, with a malicious
  grin. "I told you this youth would be utterly ignorant of her retreat."</p>

  <p>"My firm conviction is, that she is in the power of Sir Paul Parravicin,"
  observed Leonard. "But it is impossible to say where she is concealed."</p>

  <p>"Then my last hope of finding her has fallen to the ground," replied
  Thirlby, with a look of great distress. "Ever since my recovery from the
  plague, I have been in search of her. I traced her from Ashdown Park to
  Oxford, but she was gone before my arrival at the latter place; and though I
  made every possible inquiry after her, and kept strict and secret watch upon
  the villain whom I suspected, as you do, of carrying her off, I could gain no
  clue to her retreat. Having ascertained, however, that you were seen in the
  neighbourhood of Oxford about the time of her disappearance, I had persuaded
  myself you must have aided her escape. But now," he added, with a groan, "I
  find I was mistaken."</p>

  <p>"You were so," replied Leonard, mournfully; "I was in search of my
  master's daughter, Amabel, who was carried off at the same time by the Earl
  of Rochester, and my anxiety about her made me neglectful of Nizza."</p>

  <p>"I am not ignorant of your devoted attachment to her," remarked the
  stranger.</p>

  <p>"You will never find Amabel again," observed Judith, bitterly.</p>

  <p>"What mean you woman?" asked Leonard.</p>

  <p>"I mean what I say," rejoined Judith. "I repeat, you will never see her
  again."</p>

  <p>"You would not speak thus positively without some motive," returned
  Leonard, seizing her arm. "Where is she? What has happened to her?"</p>

  <p>"That you shall never learn from me," returned Judith, with a triumphant
  glance.</p>

  <p>"Speak, or I will force you to do so," cried Leonard, furiously.</p>

  <p>"Force me!" cried Judith, laughing derisively; "you know not whom you
  threaten."</p>

  <p>"But <i>I</i> do," interposed Thirlby. "This young man <i>shall</i> have
  an answer to this question," he continued, addressing her in an authoritative
  tone. "Do you know anything of the girl?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Judith; "I was merely jesting with him."</p>

  <p>"Shame on you, to trifle with his feelings thus," rejoined Thirlby. "Step
  with me this way, young man, I wish to speak with you."</p>

  <p>"Do not leave me here, Leonard," cried Blaize, "or I shall die before you
  come back."</p>

  <p>"I have no intention of leaving you," rejoined Leonard. "Are you aware
  whether Doctor Hodges is still alive, sir?" he added to Thirlby. "I have just
  been to his residence in Great Knight-rider-street, and found it shut
  up."</p>

  <p>"He has removed to Watling-street," replied the other; "but I have not
  seen him since my return to London. If you wish it, I will go to his house at
  once, and send him to look after your poor friend."</p>

  <p>Leonard was about to return thanks for the offer, when the design was
  frustrated by Blaize himself, who was so terrified by Judith's looks, that he
  could pay no attention to what was going forward; and fearing,
  notwithstanding Leonard's assurance to the contrary, that he should be left
  behind, he started to his feet, and wrapping the blanket about him, ran up
  the steps leading to the cathedral. Leonard and Thirlby followed, and seeing
  him dart into the southern aisle, would have pursued him along it, but were
  afraid of coming in contact with the many sick persons by whom it was
  thronged. They contented themselves, therefore, with watching his course, and
  were not a little surprised and alarmed to find the whole troop of lazars set
  off after him, making the sacred walls ring with their cries. Frightened by
  the clamour, Blaize redoubled his speed, and, with this ghastly train at his
  heels, crossed the lower part of the mid-aisle, and darting through the
  pillars, took refuge within Bishop Kempe's Chapel, the door of which stood
  open, and which he instantly closed after him. Judith, who had followed the
  party from the subterranean church, laughed heartily at the chase of the poor
  porter, and uttered an exclamation of regret at its sudden conclusion.
  Leonard, however, being apprehensive of mischief from the crowd of sick
  persons collected before the door, some of whom were knocking against it and
  trying to force it open, addressed himself to a couple of the attendants, and
  prevailed on them to accompany him to the chapel. The assemblage was speedily
  dispersed, and Blaize hearing Leonard's voice, instantly opened the door and
  admitted him; and, as soon as his fears were allayed, he was placed on a
  pallet within the chapel, and wrapped up in blankets, while such remedies as
  were deemed proper were administered to him. Committing him to the care of
  the attendants, and promising to reward them well for their trouble, Leonard
  told Blaize he should go and bring Doctor Hodges to him. Accordingly, he
  departed, and finding Thirlby waiting for him at the south door, they went
  forth together.</p>

  <p>"I am almost afraid of leaving the poor fellow," said Leonard, hesitating
  as he was about to descends the steps. "Judith Malmayns is so cunning and
  unscrupulous, that she may find some means of doing him an injury."</p>

  <p>"Have no fear," replied Thirlby; "she has promised me not to molest him
  further."</p>

  <p>"You appear to have a strange influence over her, then," observed Leonard.
  "May I ask how you have attained it?"</p>

  <p>"No matter," replied the other. "It must suffice that I am willing to
  exercise it in your behalf."</p>

  <p>"And you are not disposed to tell me the nature of the interest you feel
  in Nizza Macascree?" pursued Leonard.</p>

  <p>"Not as yet," replied Thirlby, with a look and tone calculated to put a
  stop to further inquiries.</p>

  <p>Passing through Saint Austin's Gate, they approached Watling-street, at
  the corner of which stood the house where Doctor Hodges had taken up his
  temporary abode, that he might visit the sick in the cathedral with greater
  convenience, and be more readily summoned whenever his attendance might be
  required. Thirlby's knock at the door was answered, to Leonard's great
  satisfaction, by the old porter, who was equally delighted to see him.</p>

  <p>It did not escape Leonard that the porter treated the stranger with great
  respect, and he inferred from this that he was a person of some
  consideration, as indeed his deportment bespoke him. The old man informed
  them that his master had been summoned on a case of urgency early in the
  morning, and had not yet returned, neither was he aware whither he was gone.
  He promised, however, to acquaint him with Blaize's condition immediately on
  his return&mdash;"and I need not assure you," he added to Leonard, "that he
  will instantly go to him." Thirlby then inquired of the porter whether Mike
  Macascree, the blind piper, was still at Dame Lucas's cottage, in Finsbury
  Fields, and was answered in the affirmative by the old man, who added,
  however, in a voice of much emotion, that the good dame herself was no
  more.</p>

  <p>"She died about a fortnight ago of the plague," he said, "and is buried
  where she desired to be, beneath an old apple-tree in her garden."</p>

  <p>"Alas!" exclaimed Leonard, brushing away a tear, "her own foreboding is
  too truly realised."</p>

  <p>"I am about to visit the old piper," observed Thirlby to the apprentice.
  "Will you go with me?"</p>

  <p>The other readily acquiesced, only stipulating that they should call in
  Wood-street on the way, that he might inquire whether his master wanted him.
  Thirlby agreeing to this, and the old porter repeating his assurance that
  Leonard might make himself quite easy as to Blaize, for he would send his
  master to him the instant he returned, they set out. On reaching Wood-street
  the apprentice gave the customary signal, and the grocer answering it, he
  informed him of his unexpected meeting with Blaize, and of the state in which
  he had left him. Mr. Bloundel was much distressed by the intelligence, and
  telling Leonard that he should not require him again that night, besought him
  to observe the utmost caution. This the apprentice promised, and joining
  Thirlby, who had walked forward to a little distance, they struck into a
  narrow street on the right, and proceeding along Aldermanbury, soon arrived
  at the first postern in the city walls beyond Cripplegate.</p>

  <p>Hitherto, Thirlby had maintained a profound silence, and appeared lost in
  melancholy reflection. Except now and then casting a commiserating glance at
  the wretched objects they encountered on the road, he kept his eyes steadily
  fixed upon the ground, and walked at a brisky pace, as if desirous of getting
  out of the city as quickly as possible. Notwithstanding his weakness, Leonard
  managed to keep up with him, and his curiosity being greatly aroused by what
  had just occurred, he began to study his appearance and features attentively.
  Thirlby was full six feet in height, and possessed a powerful and
  well-proportioned figure, and would have been considered extremely handsome
  but for a certain sinister expression about the eyes, which were large and
  dark, but lighted by a fierce and peculiar fire. His complexion was dark, and
  his countenance still bore the impress of the dreadful disease from which he
  had recently recovered. A gloomy shade sat about his brow, and it seemed to
  Leonard as if he had been led by his passions into the commission of crimes
  of which he had afterwards bitterly repented. His deportment was proud and
  commanding, and though he exhibited no haughtiness towards the apprentice,
  but, on the contrary, treated him with great familiarity, it was plain he did
  so merely from a sense of gratitude. His age was under forty, and his
  habiliments were rich, though of a sombre colour.</p>

  <p>Passing through the postern, which stood wide open, the watchman having
  disappeared, they entered a narrow lane, skirted by a few detached houses,
  all of which were shut up, and marked by the fatal cross. As they passed one
  of these habitations, they were arrested by loud and continued shrieks of the
  most heart-rending nature, and questioning a watchman who stood at an
  adjoining door, as to the cause of them, he said they proceeded from a poor
  lady who had just lost the last of her family by the plague.</p>

  <p>"Her husband and all her children, except one daughter, died last week,"
  said the man, "and though she seemed deeply afflicted, yet she bore her loss
  with resignation. Yesterday, her daughter was taken ill, and she died about
  two hours ago, since when the poor mother has done nothing but shriek in the
  way you hear. Poor soul! she will die of grief, as many have done before her
  at this awful time."</p>

  <p>"Something must be done to pacify her," returned Thirlby, in a voice of
  much emotion,&mdash;"she must be removed from her child."</p>

  <p>"Where can she be removed to?" rejoined the watchman. "Who will receive
  her?"</p>

  <p>"At all events, we can remove the object that occasions her affliction,"
  rejoined Thirlby. "My heart bleeds for her. I never heard shrieks so
  dreadful."</p>

  <p>"The dead-cart will pass by in an hour," said the watchman; "and then the
  body can be taken away."</p>

  <p>"An hour will be too late," rejoined Thirlby. "If she continues in this
  frantic state, she will be dead before that time. You have a hand-barrow
  there. Take the body to the plague-pit at once, and I will reward you for
  your trouble."</p>

  <p>"We shall find some difficulty in getting into the house," said the
  watchman, who evidently felt some repugnance to the task.</p>

  <p>"Not so," replied Thirlby. And pushing forcibly against the door, he burst
  it open, and, directed by the cries, entered a room on the right. The
  watchman's statement proved correct. Stretched upon a bed in one corner lay
  the body of a beautiful girl, while the poor mother was bending over it in a
  state bordering on distraction. On seeing Thirlby, she fled to the further
  end of the room, but did not desist from her cries. In fact, she was unable
  to do so, being under the dominion of the wildest hysterical passion. In vain
  Thirlby endeavoured to make her comprehend by signs the nature of his errand.
  Waving him off, she continued shrieking more loudly than ever. Half-stunned
  by the cries, and greatly agitated by the sight of the child, whose
  appearance reminded him of his own daughter, Thirlby motioned the watchman,
  who had followed him into the room, to bring away the body, and rushed forth.
  His injunctions were obeyed. The remains of the unfortunate girl were wrapped
  in a sheet, and deposited in the hand-barrow. The miserable mother followed
  the watchman to the door, but did not attempt to interfere with him, and
  having seen the body of her child disposed of in the manner above described,
  turned back. The next moment, a heavy sound proclaimed that she had fallen to
  the ground, and her shrieks were hushed. Thirlby and Leonard exchanged sad
  and significant looks, but neither of them went back to see what had happened
  to her. The watchman shook his head, and setting the barrow in motion,
  proceeded along a narrow footpath across the fields. Remarking that he did
  not take the direct road to the plague-pit, Leonard called to him, and
  pointed out the corner in which it lay.</p>

  <p>"I know where the old plague-pit is, as well as you," replied the
  watchman, "but it has been filled these three weeks. The new pit lies in this
  direction." So saying, he pursued his course, and they presently entered a
  field, in the middle of which lay the plague-pit, as was evident from the
  immense mound of clay thrown out of the excavation.</p>

  <p>"That pit is neither so deep nor so wide as the old one," said the
  watchman, "and if the plague goes on at this rate, they will soon have to dig
  another&mdash;that is, if any one should be left alive to undertake the
  job."</p>

  <p>And chuckling as if he had said a good thing, he impelled his barrow
  forward more quickly. A few seconds brought them near the horrible chasm. It
  was more than half full, and in all respects resembled the other pit, except
  that it was somewhat smaller. There was the same heaving and putrefying
  mass,&mdash;the same ghastly objects of every kind,&mdash;the grey-headed old
  man, the dark-haired maiden, the tender infant,&mdash;all huddled together.
  Wheeling the barrow to the edge of the pit, the watchman cast his load into
  it; and without even tarrying to throw a handful of soil over it, turned
  back, and rejoined Thirlby, who had halted at some distance from the
  excavation. While the latter was searching for his purse to reward the
  watchman, they heard wild shrieks in the adjoining field, and the next moment
  perceived the wretched mother running towards them. Guessing her purpose from
  his former experience, Leonard called to the others to stop her, and
  stretching out his arms, placed himself in her path. But all their efforts
  were in vain. She darted past them, and though Leonard caught hold of her,
  she broke from him, and leaving a fragment of her dress in his grasp, flung
  herself into the chasm.</p>

  <p>Well knowing that all help was vain, Thirlby placed a few pieces of money
  in the watchman's hand, and hurried away. He was followed by Leonard, who was
  equally eager to quit the spot. It so chanced that the path they had taken
  led them near the site of the old plague-pit, and Leonard pointed it out to
  his companion. The latter stopped for a moment, and then, without saying a
  word, ran quickly towards it. On reaching the spot, they found that the pit
  was completely filled up. The vast cake of clay with which it was covered had
  swollen and cracked in an extraordinary manner, and emitted such a horrible
  effluvium that they both instantly retreated.</p>

  <p>"And that is the grave of my poor child," cried Thirlby, halting, and
  bursting into a passionate flood of tears. "It would have been a fitting
  resting-place for a guilty wretch like me; but for her it is horrible."</p>

  <p>Allowing time for the violence of his grief to subside, Leonard addressed
  a few words of consolation to him, and then tried to turn the current of his
  thoughts by introducing a different subject. With this view, he proceeded to
  detail the piper's mysterious conduct as to the packet, and concluded by
  mentioning the piece of gold which Nizza wore as an amulet, and which she
  fancied must have some connection with her early history.</p>

  <p>"I have heard of the packet and amulet from Doctor Hodges," said Thirlby,
  "and should have visited the piper on my recovery from the plague, but I was
  all impatience to behold Nizza, and could not brook an instant's delay. But
  you know his cottage. We cannot be far from it."</p>

  <p>"Yonder it is," replied Leonard, pointing to the little habitation, which
  lay at a field's distance from them&mdash;"and we are certain to meet with
  him, for I hear the notes of his pipe."</p>

  <p>Nor was he deceived, for as they crossed the field, and approached the
  cottage, the sounds of a melancholy air played on the pipe became each
  instant more distinct. Before entering the gate, they paused for a moment to
  listen to the music, and Leonard could not help contrasting the present
  neglected appearance of the garden with the neatness it exhibited when he
  last saw it. It was overgrown with weeds, while the drooping flowers seemed
  to bemoan the loss of their mistress. Leonard's gaze involuntarily wandered
  in search of the old apple-tree, and he presently discovered it. It was
  loaded with fruit, and the rounded sod beneath it proclaimed the grave of the
  ill-fated Dame Lucas.</p>

  <p>Satisfied with this survey, Leonard opened the gate, but had no sooner set
  foot in the garden than the loud barking of a dog was heard, and Bell rushed
  forth. Leonard instantly called to her, and on hearing his voice, the little
  animal instantly changed her angry tones to a gladsome whine, and, skipping
  towards him, fawned at his feet. While he stooped to caress her, the piper,
  who had been alarmed by the barking, appeared at the door, and called out to
  know who was there? At the sight of him, Thirlby, who was close behind
  Leonard, uttered a cry of surprise, and exclaiming, "It is he!" rushed
  towards him.</p>

  <p>The cry of recognition uttered by the stranger caused the piper to start
  as if he had received a sudden and violent shock. The ruddy tint instantly
  deserted his cheek, and was succeeded by a deadly paleness; his limbs
  trembled, and he bent forward with a countenance of the utmost anxiety, as if
  awaiting a confirmation of his fears. When within a couple of yards of him,
  Thirlby paused, and having narrowly scrutinized his features, as if to
  satisfy himself he was not mistaken, again exclaimed, though in a lower and
  deeper tone than before, "It is he!" and seizing his arm, pushed him into the
  house, banging the door to after him in such a manner as to leave no doubt in
  the apprentice's mind that his presence was not desired. Accordingly, though
  extremely anxious to hear what passed between them, certain their
  conversation must relate to Nizza Macascree, Leonard did not attempt to
  follow, but, accompanied by Bell, who continued to gambol round him, directed
  his steps towards the grave of Dame Lucas. Here he endeavoured to beguile the
  time in meditation, but in spite of his efforts to turn his thoughts into a
  different channel, they perpetually recurred to what he supposed to be taking
  place inside the house. The extraordinary effect produced by Nizza Macascree
  on Thirlby&mdash;the resemblance he had discovered between her and some
  person dear to him&mdash;the anxiety he appeared to feel for her, as evinced
  by his recent search for her&mdash;the mysterious connection which clearly
  subsisted between him and the piper&mdash;all these circumstances convinced
  Leonard that Thirlby was, or imagined himself, connected by ties of the
  closest relationship with the supposed piper's daughter.</p>

  <p>Leonard had never been able to discern the slightest resemblance either in
  manner or feature, or in those indescribably slight personal peculiarities
  that constitute a family likeness, between Nizza and her reputed
  father&mdash;neither could he now recall any particular resemblance between
  her and Thirlby; still he could not help thinking her beauty and high-bred
  looks savoured more of the latter than the former. He came, therefore, to the
  conclusion that she must be the offspring of some early and unfortunate
  attachment on the part of Thirlby, whose remorse might naturally be the
  consequence of his culpable conduct at that time. His sole perplexity was the
  piper's connection with the affair; but he got over this difficulty by
  supposing that Nizza's mother, whoever she was, must have committed her to
  Macascree's care when an infant, probably with strict injunctions, which
  circumstances might render necessary, to conceal her even from her father.
  Such was Leonard's solution of the mystery; and feeling convinced that he had
  made himself master of the stranger's secret, he resolved to give him to
  understand as much as soon as he beheld him again.</p>

  <p>More than half an hour having elapsed, and Thirlby not coming forth,
  Leonard began to think sufficient time had been allowed him for private
  conference with the piper, and he therefore walked towards the door, and
  coughing to announce his approach, raised the latch and entered the house. He
  found the pair seated close together, and conversing in a low and earnest
  tone. The piper had completely recovered from his alarm, and seemed perfectly
  at ease with his companion, while all traces of anger had disappeared from
  the countenance of the other. Before them on the table lay several letters,
  taken from a packet, the cover of which Leonard recognised as the one that
  had been formerly intrusted to him. Amidst them was the miniature of a
  lady&mdash;at least, it appeared so to Leonard, in the hasty glance he caught
  of it; but he could not be quite sure; for on seeing him, Thirlby closed the
  case, and placing his hand on the piper's mouth, to check his further speech,
  arose.</p>

  <p>"Forgive my rudeness," he said to the apprentice; "but I have been so
  deeply interested in what I have just heard, that I quite forgot you were
  waiting without. I shall remain here some hours longer, but will not detain
  you, especially as I am unable to admit you to our conference. I will meet
  you at Doctor Hodges's in the evening, and shall have much to say to
  you."</p>

  <p>"I can anticipate some part of your communication," replied Leonard. "You
  will tell me you have a daughter still living."</p>

  <p>"You are inquisitive, young man," rejoined Thirlby, sternly.</p>

  <p>"You do me wrong, sir," replied Leonard. "I have no curiosity as regards
  yourself; and if I had, would never lower myself in my own estimation to
  gratify it. Feeling a strong interest in Nizza Macascree, I am naturally
  anxious to know whether my suspicion that a near relationship subsists
  between yourself and her is correct."</p>

  <p>"I cannot enter into further explanation now," returned Thirlby. "Meet me
  at Doctor Hodges's this evening, and you shall know more. And now farewell. I
  am in the midst of a deeply-interesting conversation, which your presence
  interrupts. Do not think me rude&mdash;do not think me ungrateful. My anxiety
  must plead my excuse."</p>

  <p>"None is necessary, sir," replied Leonard. "I will no longer place any
  restraint upon you."</p>

  <p>So saying, and taking care not to let Bell out, he passed through the
  door, and closed it after him. Having walked to some distance across the
  fields, musing on what had just occurred, and scarcely conscious whither he
  was going, he threw himself down on the grass, and fell asleep. He awoke
  after some time much refreshed, and finding he was considerably nearer
  Bishopsgate than any other entrance into the city, determined to make for it.
  A few minutes brought him to a row of houses without the walls, none of which
  appeared to have escaped infection, and passing them, he entered the city
  gate. As he proceeded along the once-crowded but now utterly-deserted
  thoroughfare that opened upon him, he could scarcely believe he was in a spot
  which had once been the busiest of the busy haunts of men&mdash;so silent, so
  desolate did it appear! On reaching Cornhill, he found it equally deserted.
  The Exchange was closed, and as Leonard looked at its barred gates, a
  saddening train of reflection passed through his mind. His head declined upon
  his breast, and he continued lost in a mournful reverie until he was roused
  by a hand laid upon his shoulder, and starting&mdash;for such a salutation at
  this season was alarming&mdash;he looked round, and beheld Solomon Eagle.</p>

  <p>"You are looking upon that structure," said the enthusiast, "and are
  thinking how much it is changed. Men who possess boundless riches imagine
  their power above that of their Maker, and suppose they may neglect and defy
  him. But they are mistaken. Where are now the wealthy merchants who used to
  haunt those courts and chambers?&mdash;why do they not come here as of
  old?&mdash;why do they not buy and sell, and send their messengers and ships
  to the farthest parts of the world? Because the Lord hath smitten them and
  driven them forth&mdash;'From the least of them even to the greatest of
  them,' as the prophet Jeremiah saith, 'every one has been given to
  covetousness.' The balances of deceit have been in their hands. They have
  cozened their neighbours, and greedily gained from them, and will find it
  true what the prophet Ezekiel hath written, that 'the Lord will pour out his
  indignation upon them, and consume them with the fire of his wrath.' Yea, I
  tell you, unless they turn from their evil ways&mdash;unless they cast aside
  the golden idol they now worship, and set up the Holy One of Israel in its
  stead, a fire will be sent to consume them, and that pile which they have
  erected as a temple to their god shall be burnt to the ground."</p>

  <p>Leonard's heart was too full to make any answer, and the enthusiast, after
  a brief pause, again addressed him. "Have you seen Doctor Hodges pass this
  way? I am in search of him."</p>

  <p>"On what account?" asked Leonard anxiously. "His advice, I trust, is not
  needed on behalf of any one in whom I am interested."</p>

  <p>"No matter," replied Solomon Eagle, in a sombre tone; "have you seen
  him?"</p>

  <p>"I have not," rejoined the apprentice; "but he is probably at Saint
  Paul's."</p>

  <p>"I have just left the cathedral, and was told he had proceeded to some
  house near Cornhill," rejoined the enthusiast.</p>

  <p>"If you have been there, you can perhaps tell me how my master's porter,
  Blaize Shotterel, is getting on," said Leonard.</p>

  <p>"I can," replied the enthusiast. "I heard one of the chirurgeons say that
  Doctor Hodges had pronounced him in a fair way of recovery. But I must either
  find the doctor or go elsewhere. Farewell!"</p>

  <p>"I will go with you in search of him," said Leonard.</p>

  <p>"No, no; you must not&mdash;shall not," cried Solomon Eagle.</p>

  <p>"Wherefore not?" asked the apprentice.</p>

  <p>"Do not question me, but leave me," rejoined the enthusiast.</p>

  <p>"Do you know aught of Amabel&mdash;of her retreat?" persisted Leonard, who
  had a strange misgiving that the enthusiast's errand in some way referred to
  her.</p>

  <p>"I do," replied Solomon Eagle, gloomily; "but I again advise you not to
  press me further."</p>

  <p>"Answer me one question at least," cried Leonard. "Is she with the Earl of
  Rochester?"</p>

  <p>"She is," replied Solomon Eagle; "but I shall allay your fears in that
  respect when I tell you she is sick of the plague."</p>

  <p>Leonard heard nothing more, for, uttering a wild shriek, he fell to the
  ground insensible. He was aroused to consciousness by a sudden sense of
  strangulation, and opening his eyes, beheld two dark figures bending over
  him, one of whom was kneeling on his chest. A glance showed him that this
  person was Chowles; and instantly comprehending what was the matter, and
  aware that the coffin-maker was stripping him previously to throwing him into
  the dead-cart, which was standing hard by, he cried aloud, and struggled
  desperately to set himself free. Little opposition was offered; for, on
  hearing the cry, Chowles quitted his hold, and retreating to a short
  distance, exclaimed, with a look of surprise, "Why, the fellow is not dead,
  after all!"</p>

  <p>"I am neither dead, nor likely to die, as you shall find to your cost,
  rascal, if you do not restore me the clothes you have robbed me of," cried
  Leonard, furiously. And chancing to perceive a fork, dropped by Chowles in
  his hasty retreat, he snatched it up, and, brandishing it over his head,
  advanced towards him. Thus threatened, Chowles tossed him a rich suit of
  livery.</p>

  <p>"These are not mine," said the apprentice, gazing at the habiliments.</p>

  <p>"They are better than your own," replied Chowles, "and therefore you ought
  to be glad of the exchange. But give me them back again. I have no intention
  of making you a present."</p>

  <p>"This is the livery of the Earl of Rochester," cried Leonard.</p>

  <p>"To be sure it is," replied Chowles, with a ghastly smile. "One of his
  servants is just dead."</p>

  <p>"Where is the profligate noble?" cried Leonard, eagerly.</p>

  <p>"There is the person who owned these clothes," replied Chowles, pointing
  to the dead-cart. "You had better ask him."</p>

  <p>"Where is the Earl of Rochester, I say, villain?" cried Leonard,
  menacingly.</p>

  <p>"How should I know?" rejoined Chowles. "Here are your clothes," he added,
  pushing them towards him.</p>

  <p>"I will have an answer," cried Leonard.</p>

  <p>"Not from me," replied Chowles. And hastily snatching up the livery, he
  put the cart in motion, and proceeded on his road. Leonard would have
  followed him, but the state of his attire did not permit him to do so. Having
  dressed himself, he hastened to the cathedral, where he soon found the
  attendant who had charge of Blaize.</p>

  <p>"Doctor Hodges has been with him," said the man, in reply to his inquiries
  after the porter, "and has good hopes of him. But the patient is not entirely
  satisfied with the treatment he has received, and wishes to try some remedies
  of his own. Were his request granted, all would soon be over with him."</p>

  <p>"That I am sure of," replied Leonard. "But let us go to him."</p>

  <p>"You must not heed his complaints," returned the attendant. "I assure you
  he is doing as well as possible; but he is so dreadfully frightened at a
  trifling operation which Doctor Hodges finds it necessary to perform upon
  him, that we have been obliged to fasten him to the bed."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" exclaimed Leonard, suspiciously. "Has Judith Malmayns had no
  hand in this arrangement?"</p>

  <p>"Judith Malmayns has been absent during the whole of the afternoon," said
  the man, "and another nurse has taken her place in Saint Faith's. She has
  never been near Blaize since I have had charge of him."</p>

  <p>By this time they had reached the pallet in which the porter was laid. His
  eyes and a small portion of his snub-nose were alone visible, his head being
  still enveloped by the linen cloth, while his mouth was covered by blankets.
  He looked so anxiously at the apprentice, that the latter removed the
  covering from his mouth, and enabled him to speak.</p>

  <p>"I am glad to find you are getting on so well," said Leonard, in a
  cheerful tone. "Doctor Hodges has been with you, I understand?"</p>

  <p>"He has," groaned Blaize; "but he has done me no good&mdash;none whatever.
  I could doctor myself much better, if I might be allowed; for I know every
  remedy that has been prescribed for the plague; but he would adopt none that
  I mentioned to him. I wanted him to place a hot loaf, fresh from the oven, to
  the tumour, to draw it; but he would not consent. Then I asked for a
  cataplasm, composed of radish-roots, mustard-seed, onions and garlic roasted,
  mithridate, salt, and soot from a chimney where wood only has been burnt.
  This he liked no better than the first. Next, I begged for an ale posset with
  pimpernel soaked in it, assuring him that by frequently drinking such a
  mixture, Secretary Naunton drew the infection from his very heart. But the
  doctor would have none of it, and seemed to doubt the fact."</p>

  <p>"What did he do?" inquired Leonard.</p>

  <p>"He applied oil of St. John's wort to the tumour," replied Blaize, with a
  dismal groan, and said, "if the scar did not fall off, he must cauterize it.
  Oh! I shall never be able to bear the pain of the operation."</p>

  <p>"Recollect your life is at stake," rejoined Leonard. "You must either
  submit to it or die."</p>

  <p>"I know I must," replied Blaize, with a prolonged groan; "but it is a
  terrible alternative."</p>

  <p>"You will not find the operation so painful as you imagine," rejoined
  Leonard; "and you know I speak from personal experience."</p>

  <p>"You give me great comfort," said Blaize. "And so you really think I shall
  get better?"</p>

  <p>"I have no doubt of it, if you keep up your spirits," replied Leonard.
  "The worst is evidently over. Behave like a man."</p>

  <p>"I will try to do so," rejoined Blaize. "I have been told that if a circle
  is drawn with a blue sapphire round a plague-blotch, it will fall off.
  Couldn't we just try the experiment?"</p>

  <p>"It will not do to rely upon it," observed the attendant, with a smile.
  "You will find a small knob of red-hot iron, which we call the 'button,' much
  more efficacious."</p>

  <p>"Oh dear! oh dear!" exclaimed Blaize, "I already feel that dreadful button
  burning into my flesh."</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, you won't feel it at all," replied the attendant. "The
  iron only touches the point of the tumour, in which there is no
  sensibility."</p>

  <p>"In that case, I don't care how soon the operation is performed," replied
  Blaize.</p>

  <p>"Doctor Hodges will choose his own time for it," said the attendant. "In
  the mean time, here is a cup of barley-broth for you. You will find it do you
  good."</p>

  <p>While the man applied the cup to the poor porter's lips&mdash;for he would
  not unloose the straps, for fear of mischief&mdash;Leonard, who was sickened
  by the terrible scene around him, took his departure, and quitted the
  cathedral by the great western entrance. Seating himself on one of the great
  blocks of stone left there by the workmen employed in repairing the
  cathedral, but who had long since abandoned their task, he thought over all
  that had recently occurred. Raising his eyes at length, he looked toward the
  cathedral. The oblique rays of the sun had quitted the columns of the
  portico, which looked cold and grey, while the roof and towers were
  glittering in light. In ten minutes more, only the summit of the central
  tower caught the last reflection of the declining orb. Leonard watched the
  rosy gleam till it disappeared, and then steadfastly regarded the reverend
  pile as its hue changed from grey to black, until at length each pinnacle and
  buttress, each battlement and tower, was lost in one vast indistinct mass.
  Night had fallen upon the city&mdash;a night destined to be more fatal than
  any that had preceded it; and yet it was so calm, so beautiful, so clear,
  that it was scarcely possible to imagine that it was unhealthy. The
  destroying angel was, however, fearfully at work. Hundreds were falling
  beneath his touch; and as Leonard wondered how many miserable wretches were
  at that moment released from suffering, it crossed him like an icy chill,
  that among the number might be Amabel. So forcibly was he impressed by this
  idea, that he fell on his knees and prayed aloud.</p>

  <p>He was aroused by hearing the ringing of a bell, which announced the
  approach of the dead-cart, and presently afterwards the gloomy vehicle
  approached from Ludgate-hill, and moved slowly towards the portico of the
  cathedral, where it halted. A great number of the dead were placed within it,
  and the driver, ringing his bell, proceeded in the direction of Cheapside. A
  very heavy dew had fallen; for as Leonard put his hand to his clothes, they
  felt damp, and his long hair was filled with moisture. Reproaching himself
  with having needlessly exposed himself to risk, he was about to walk away,
  when he heard footsteps at a little distance, and looking in the direction of
  the sound, perceived the tall figure of Thirlby. Calling to him, the other,
  who appeared to be in haste, halted for a moment, and telling the apprentice
  he was going to Doctor Hodges's, desired him to accompany him thither, and
  went on.</p>

  <p>* * * * *</p>

  <h2><a id="ch4-3"
     name="ch4-3">III. &mdash; THE HOUSE IN NICHOLAS-LANE.</a></h2>

  <p>On reaching Watling-street, Leonard and his companion found Doctor Hodges
  was from home. This did not much surprise the apprentice, after the
  information he had received from Solomon Eagle, but Thirlby was greatly
  disappointed, and eagerly questioned the porter as to the probable time of
  his master's return. The man replied that it was quite uncertain, adding, "He
  has been in since you were last here, and has seen Blaize. He had not been
  gone to the cathedral many minutes when a gentleman arrived, desiring his
  instant attendance upon a young woman who was sick of the plague."</p>

  <p>"Did you hear her name?" asked Leonard and Thirlby, in a breath.</p>

  <p>"No," replied the porter, "neither did I obtain any information respecting
  her from the gentleman, who appeared in great distress. But I observed that
  my master, on his return, looked much surprised at seeing him, and treated
  him with a sort of cold respect."</p>

  <p>"Was the gentleman young or old?" demanded Leonard, hastily.</p>

  <p>"As far as I noticed," replied the porter, "for he kept his face covered
  with a handkerchief, I should say he was young&mdash;very young."</p>

  <p>"You are sure it was not Lord Rochester?" pursued Leonard.</p>

  <p>"How should I be sure of it," rejoined the porter, "since I have never
  seen his lordship that I am aware of? But I will tell you all that happened,
  and you can judge for yourselves. My master, as I have just said, on seeing
  the stranger, looked surprised and angry, and bowing gravely, conducted him
  to his study, taking care to close the door after him. I did not, of course,
  hear what passed, but the interview was brief enough, and the gentleman,
  issuing forth, said, as he quitted the room, 'You will not fail to come?' To
  which my master replied, 'Certainly not, on the terms I have mentioned.' With
  this, the gentleman hurried out of the house. Shortly afterwards the doctor
  came out, and said to me, 'I am going to attend a young woman who is sick of
  the plague, and may be absent for some time. If Mr. Thirlby or Leonard Holt
  should call, detain them till my return.'"</p>

  <p>"My heart tells me that the young woman he is gone to visit is no other
  than Amabel," said Leonard Holt, sorrowfully.</p>

  <p>"I suspect it is Nizza Macascree," cried Thirlby. "Which way did your
  master take?"</p>

  <p>"I did not observe," replied the porter, "but he told me he should cross
  London Bridge."</p>

  <p>"I will go into Southwark in quest of him," said Thirlby. "Every moment is
  of consequence now."</p>

  <p>"You had better stay where you are," replied the old porter. "It is the
  surest way to meet with him."</p>

  <p>Thirlby, however, was too full of anxiety to listen to reason, and his
  impatience producing a corresponding effect upon Leonard, though from a
  different motive, they set forth together. "If I fail to find him, you may
  expect me back ere long," were Thirlby's last words to the porter. Hurrying
  along Watling-street, and taking the first turning on the right, he descended
  to Thames-street, and made the best of his way towards the bridge. Leonard
  followed him closely, and they pursued their rapid course in silence. By the
  time they reached the north gate of the bridge, Leonard found his strength
  failing him, and halting at one of the openings between the tall houses
  overlooking the river, where there was a wooden bench for the accommodation
  of passengers, he sank upon it, and begged Thirlby to go on, saying he would
  return to Watling-street as soon as he recovered from his exhaustion. Thirlby
  did not attempt to dissuade him from his purpose, but instantly
  disappeared.</p>

  <p>The night, it has before been remarked, was singularly beautiful. It was
  almost as light as day, for the full harvest moon (alas! there was no harvest
  for it to smile upon!) having just risen, revealed every object with perfect
  distinctness. The bench on which Leonard was seated lay on the right side of
  the bridge, and commanded a magnificent reach of the river, that flowed
  beneath like a sheet of molten silver. The apprentice gazed along its banks,
  and noticed the tall spectral-looking houses on the right, until his eye
  finally settled on the massive fabric of Saint Paul's, the roof and towers of
  which rose high above the lesser structures. His meditations were suddenly
  interrupted by the opening of a window in the house near him, while a loud
  splash in the water told that a body had been thrown into it. He turned away
  with a shudder, and at the same moment perceived a watchman, with a halberd
  upon his shoulder, advancing slowly towards him from the Southwark side of
  the bridge. Pausing as he drew near the apprentice, the watchman
  compassionately inquired whether he was sick, and being answered in the
  negative, was about to pass on, when Leonard, fancying he recognised his
  voice, stopped him.</p>

  <p>"We have met somewhere before, friend," he said, "though where, or under
  what circumstances, I cannot at this moment call to mind."</p>

  <p>"Not unlikely," returned the other, roughly, "but the chances are against
  our meeting again."</p>

  <p>Leonard heaved a sigh at this remark. "I now recollect where I met you,
  friend," he remarked. "It was at Saint Paul's, when I was in search of my
  master's daughter, who had been carried off by the Earl of Rochester. But you
  were then in the garb of a smith."</p>

  <p>"I recollect the circumstance, too, now you remind me of it," replied the
  other. "Your name is Leonard Holt as surely as mine is Robert Rainbird. I
  recollect, also, that you offended me about a dog belonging to the piper's
  pretty daughter, Nizza Macascree, which I was about to destroy in obedience
  to the Lord Mayor's commands. However, I bear no malice, and if I did, this
  is not a time to rip up old quarrels."</p>

  <p>"You are right, friend," returned Leonard. "The few of us left ought to be
  in charity with each other."</p>

  <p>"Truly, ought we," rejoined Rainbird. "For my own part, I have seen so
  much misery within the last few weeks, that my disposition is wholly changed.
  I was obliged to abandon my old occupation of a smith, because my master died
  of the plague, and there was no one else to employ me. I have therefore
  served as a watchman, and in twenty days have stood at the doors of more than
  twenty houses. It would freeze your blood were I to relate the scenes I have
  witnessed."</p>

  <p>"It might have done formerly," replied Leonard; "but my feelings are as
  much changed as your own. I have had the plague twice myself."</p>

  <p>"Then, indeed, you <i>can</i> speak," replied Rainbird. "Thank God, I have
  hitherto escaped it! Ah! these are terrible times&mdash;terrible times! The
  worst that ever London knew. Although I have been hitherto miraculously
  preserved myself, I am firmly persuaded no one will escape."</p>

  <p>"I am almost inclined to agree with you," replied Leonard.</p>

  <p>"For the last week the distemper has raged fearfully&mdash;fearfully,
  indeed," said Rainbird; "but yesterday and to-day have far exceeded all that
  have gone before. The distempered have died quicker than cattle of the
  murrain. I visited upwards of a hundred houses in the Borough this morning,
  and only found ten persons alive; and out of those ten, not one, I will
  venture to say, is alive now. It will, in truth, be a mercy if they are gone.
  There were distracted mothers raving over their children,&mdash;a young
  husband lamenting his wife,&mdash;two little children weeping over their dead
  parents, with none to attend them, none to feed them,&mdash;an old man
  mourning over his son cut off in his prime. In short, misery and distress in
  their worst form,&mdash;the streets ringing with shrieks and groans, and the
  numbers of dead so great that it was impossible to carry them off. You
  remember Solomon Eagle's prophecy?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly," replied Leonard; "and I lament to see its fulfilment."</p>

  <p>"'The streets shall be covered with grass, and the living shall not be
  able to bury their dead,'&mdash;so it ran," said Rainbird. "And it has come
  to pass. Not a carriage of any description, save the dead-cart, is to be seen
  in the broadest streets of London, which are now as green as the fields
  without her walls, and as silent as the grave itself. Terrible times, as I
  said before&mdash;terrible times! The dead are rotting in heaps in the
  courts, in the alleys, in the very houses, and no one to remove them. What
  will be the end of it all? What will become of this great city?"</p>

  <p>"It is not difficult to foresee what will become of it," replied Leonard,
  "unless it pleases the Lord to stay his vengeful arm. And something whispers
  in my ear that we are now at the worst. The scourge cannot exceed its present
  violence without working our ruin; and deeply as we have sinned, little as we
  repent, I cannot bring myself to believe that God will sweep his people
  entirely from the face of the earth."</p>

  <p>"I dare not hope otherwise," rejoined Rainbird, "though I would fain do
  so. I discern no symptoms of abatement of the distemper, but, on the
  contrary, an evident increase of malignity, and such is the opinion of all I
  have spoken with on the subject. Chowles told me he buried two hundred more
  yesterday than he had ever done before, and yet he did not carry a third of
  the dead to the plague-pit. He is a strange fellow that Chowles. But for his
  passion for his horrible calling there is no necessity for him to follow it,
  for he is now one of the richest men in London."</p>

  <p>"He must have amassed his riches by robbery, then," remarked Leonard.</p>

  <p>"True," returned Rainbird. "He helps himself without scruple to the
  clothes, goods, and other property, of all who die of the pestilence; and
  after ransacking their houses, conveys his plunder in the dead-cart to his
  own dwelling."</p>

  <p>"In Saint Paul's?" asked Leonard.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;a large house in Nicholas-lane, once belonging to a wealthy
  merchant, who perished, with his family, of the plague," replied Rainbird.
  "He has filled it from cellar to garret with the spoil he has obtained."</p>

  <p>"And how has he preserved it?" inquired the apprentice.</p>

  <p>"The plague has preserved it for him," replied Rainbird. "The few
  authorities who now act have, perhaps, no knowledge of his proceedings; or if
  they have, have not cared to interfere, awaiting a more favourable season, if
  it should ever arrive, to dispossess him of his hoard, and punish him for his
  delinquencies; while, in the mean time, they are glad, on any terms, to avail
  themselves of his services as a burier. Other people do not care to meddle
  with him, and the most daring robber would be afraid to touch infected money
  or clothes."</p>

  <p>"If you are going towards Nicholas-lane," said Leonard, as if struck with
  a sudden idea, "and will point out to me the house in question, you will do
  me a favour."</p>

  <p>Rainbird nodded assent, and they walked on together towards
  Fish-street-hill. Ascending it, and turning off on the right, they entered
  Great Eastcheap, but had not proceeded far when they were obliged to turn
  back, the street being literally choked up with a pile of carcasses deposited
  there by the burier's assistants. Shaping their course along
  Gracechurch-street, they turned off into Lombard-street, and as Leonard gazed
  at the goldsmiths' houses on either side, which were all shut up, with the
  fatal red cross on the doors, he could not help remarking to his companion,
  "The plague has not spared any of these on account of their riches."</p>

  <p>"True," replied the other; "and of the thousands who used formerly to
  throng this street not one is left. Wo to London!&mdash;wo!&mdash;wo!"</p>

  <p>Leonard echoed the sentiment, and fell into a melancholy train of
  reflection. It has been more than once remarked that the particular day now
  under consideration was the one in which the plague exercised its fiercest
  dominion over the city; and though at first its decline was as imperceptible
  as the gradual diminution of the day after the longest has passed, yet still
  the alteration began. On that day, as if death had known that his power was
  to be speedily arrested, he sharpened his fellest arrows, and discharged them
  with unerring aim. To pursue the course of the destroyer from house to
  house&mdash;to show with what unrelenting fury he assailed his
  victims&mdash;to describe their sufferings&mdash;to number the dead left
  within their beds, thrown into the streets, or conveyed to the
  plague-pits&mdash;would be to present a narrative as painful as revolting. On
  this terrible night it was as hot as if it had been the middle of June. No
  air was stirring, and the silence was so profound, that a slight noise was
  audible at a great distance. Hushed in the seemingly placid repose lay the
  great city, while hundreds of its inhabitants were groaning in agony, or
  breathing their last sigh.</p>

  <p>On reaching the upper end of Nicholas-lane, Rainbird stood still for a
  moment, and pointed out a large house on the right, just below the old church
  dedicated to the saint from which the thoroughfare took its name. They were
  about to proceed towards it, when the smith again paused, and called
  Leonard's attention to two figures quickly advancing from the lower end of
  the street. As the apprentice and his companion stood in the shade, they
  could not be seen, while the two persons, being in the moonlight, were fully
  revealed. One of them, it was easy to perceive, was Chowles. He stopped
  before the door of his dwelling and unfastened it, and while he was thus
  occupied, the other person turned his face so as to catch the full radiance
  of the moon, disclosing the features of Sir Paul Parravicin. Before Leonard
  recovered from the surprise into which he was thrown by this unexpected
  discovery, they had entered the house.</p>

  <p>He then hurried forward, but, to his great disappointment, found the door
  locked. Anxious to get into the house without alarming those who had preceded
  him, he glanced at the windows; but the shutters were closed and strongly
  barred. While hesitating what to do, Rainbird came up, and guessing his
  wishes, told him there was a door at the back of the house by which he might
  probably gain admittance. Accordingly they hastened down a passage skirting
  the churchyard, which brought them to a narrow alley lying between
  Nicholas-lane and Abchurch-lane. Tracking it for about twenty yards, Rainbird
  paused before a small yard-door, and trying the latch, found it yielded to
  his touch.</p>

  <p>Crossing the yard, they came to another door. It was locked, and though
  they could have easily burst it open, they preferred having recourse to an
  adjoining window, the shutter of which, being carelessly fastened, was
  removed without noise or difficulty. In another moment they gained a small
  dark room on the ground-floor, whence they issued into a passage, where, to
  their great joy, they found a lighted lantern placed on a chair. Leonard
  hastily possessed himself of it, and was about to enter a room on the left
  when his companion arrested him.</p>

  <p>"Before we proceed further," he said in a low voice, "I must know what you
  are about to do?"</p>

  <p>"My purpose will be explained in a word," replied the apprentice in the
  same tone. "I suspect that Nizza Macascree is confined here by Sir Paul
  Parravicin and Chowles, and if it turns out I am right in my conjecture, I
  propose to liberate her. Will you help me?"</p>

  <p>"Humph!" exclaimed Rainbird, "I don't much fancy the job. However, since I
  am here, I'll not go back. I am curious to see the coffin-maker's hoards.
  Look at yon heap of clothes. There are velvet doublets and silken hose enow
  to furnish wardrobes for a dozen court gallants. And yet, rich as the stuffs
  are, I would not put the best of them on for all the wealth of London."</p>

  <p>"Nor I," replied Leonard. "I shall make free, however, with a sword," he
  added, selecting one from the heap. "I may need a weapon."</p>

  <p>"I require nothing more than my halberd," observed the smith; "and I would
  advise you to throw away that velvet scabbard; it is a certain harbour for
  infection."</p>

  <p>Leonard did not neglect the caution, and pushing open the door, they
  entered a large room which resembled an upholsterer's shop, being literally
  crammed with chairs, tables, cabinets, moveable cupboards, bedsteads,
  curtains, and hangings, all of the richest description.</p>

  <p>"What I heard is true," observed Rainbird, gazing around in astonishment.
  "Chowles must have carried off every thing he could lay hands upon. What can
  he do with all that furniture?"</p>

  <p>"What the miser does with his store," replied Leonard: "feast his eyes
  with it, but never use it."</p>

  <p>They then proceeded to the next room. It was crowded with books,
  looking-glasses, and pictures; many of them originally of great value, but
  greatly damaged by the careless manner in which they were piled one upon
  another. A third apartment was filled with flasks of wine, with casks
  probably containing spirits, and boxes, the contents of which they did not
  pause to examine. A fourth contained male and female habiliments, spread out
  like the dresses in a theatrical wardrobe. Most of these garments were of the
  gayest and costliest description, and of the latest fashion, and Leonard
  sighed as he looked upon them, and thought of the fate of those they had so
  lately adorned.</p>

  <p>"There is contagion enough in those clothes to infect a whole city," said
  Rainbird, who regarded them with different feelings. "I have half a mind to
  set fire to them."</p>

  <p>"It were a good deed to do so," returned Leonard; "but it must not be done
  now. Let us go upstairs. These are the only rooms below."</p>

  <p>Accordingly, they ascended the staircase, and entered chamber after
  chamber, all of which were as full of spoil as those they had just visited;
  but they could find no one, nor was there any symptom that the house was
  tenanted. They next stood still within the gallery, and listened intently for
  some sound to reveal those they sought, but all was still and silent as the
  grave.</p>

  <p>"We cannot be mistaken," observed Leonard. "It is clear this house is the
  receptacle for Chowles's plunder. Besides, we should not have found the
  lantern burning if they had gone forth again. No, no; they must be hidden
  somewhere, and I will not quit the place till I find them." Their search,
  however, was fruitless. They mounted to the garrets, opened every door, and
  glanced into every corner. Still, no one was to be seen.</p>

  <p>"I begin to think Nizza cannot be here," said the apprentice; "but I am
  resolved not to depart without questioning Chowles on the subject."</p>

  <p>"You must find him first," rejoined Rainbird. "If he is anywhere, he must
  be in the cellar, for we have been into every room in this part of the house.
  For my own part, I think you had better abandon the search altogether. No
  good will come of it."</p>

  <p>Leonard, however, was not to be dissuaded, and they went downstairs. A
  short flight of stone steps brought them to a spacious kitchen, but it was
  quite empty, and seemed to have been long disused. They then peeped into the
  scullery adjoining, and were about to retrace their steps, when Rainbird
  plucked Leonard's sleeve to call attention to a gleam of light issuing from a
  door which stood partly ajar, in a long narrow passage leading apparently to
  the cellars.</p>

  <p>"They are there," he said, in a whisper.</p>

  <p>"So I see," replied Leonard, in the same tone. And raising his finger to
  his lips in token of silence, he stole forward on the points of his feet and
  cautiously opened the door.</p>

  <p>At the further end of the cellar&mdash;for such it was&mdash;knelt
  Chowles, examining with greedy eyes the contents of a large chest, which,
  from the hasty glance that Leonard caught of it, appeared to be filled with
  gold and silver plate. A link stuck against the wall threw a strong light
  over the scene, and showed that the coffin-maker was alone. As Leonard
  advanced, the sound of his footsteps caught Chowles's ear, and uttering a cry
  of surprise and alarm, he let fall the lid of the chest, and sprang to his
  feet.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" he cried, looking uneasily round, as if in search of
  some weapon. "Are you come to rob me?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Leonard; "neither are we come to reclaim the plunder you
  have taken from others. We are come in search of Nizza Macascree."</p>

  <p>"Then you have come on a fool's errand," replied Chowles, regaining his
  courage, "for she is not here. I know nothing of her."</p>

  <p>"That is false," replied Leonard. "You have just conducted Sir Paul
  Parravicin to her."</p>

  <p>This assertion on the part of the apprentice, which he thought himself
  justified under the circumstances in making, produced a strong effect on
  Chowles. He appeared startled and confounded. "What right have you to play
  the spy upon me thus?" he faltered.</p>

  <p>"The right that every honest man possesses to check the designs of the
  wicked," replied Leonard. "You admit she is here. Lead me to her hiding-place
  without more ado."</p>

  <p>"If you know where it is," rejoined Chowles, who now perceived the trick
  that had been practised upon him, "you will not want me to conduct you to it.
  Neither Nizza nor Sir Paul Parravicin are here."</p>

  <p>"That is false, prevaricating scoundrel," cried Leonard. "My companion and
  I saw you enter the house with your profligate employer. And as we gained
  admittance a few minutes after you, it is certain no one can have left it.
  Lead me to Nizza's retreat instantly, or I will cut your throat." And seizing
  Chowles by the collar, he held the point of his sword to his breast.</p>

  <p>"Use no violence," cried Chowles, struggling to free himself, "and I will
  take you wherever you please. This way&mdash;this way." And he motioned as if
  he would take them upstairs.</p>

  <p>"Do not think to mislead me, villain," cried Leonard, tightening his
  grasp. "We have searched every room in the upper part of the house, and
  though we have discovered the whole of your ill-gotten hoards, we have found
  nothing else. No one is there."</p>

  <p>"Well, then," rejoined Chowles, "since the truth must out, Sir Paul is in
  the next house. But it is his own abode. I have nothing to do with it,
  nothing whatever. He is accountable for his own actions, and you will be
  accountable to <i>him</i> if you intrude upon his privacy. Release me, and I
  swear to conduct you to him. But you will take the consequences of your
  rashness upon yourself. I only go upon compulsion."</p>

  <p>"I am ready to take any consequences," replied Leonard, resolutely.</p>

  <p>"Come along, then," said Chowles, pointing down the passage.</p>

  <p>"You mean us no mischief?" cried Leonard, suspiciously. "If you do, the
  attempt will cost you your life."</p>

  <p>Chowles made no answer, but moved along the passage as quickly as Leonard,
  who kept fast hold of him and walked by his side, would permit. Presently
  they reached a door, which neither the apprentice nor Rainbird had observed
  before, and which admitted them into an extensive vault, with a short
  staircase at the further end, communicating with a passage that Leonard did
  not require to be informed was in another house.</p>

  <p>Here Chowles paused. "I think it right to warn you you are running into a
  danger from which ere long you will be glad to draw back, young man," he
  said, to the apprentice. "As a friend, I advise you to proceed no further in
  the matter."</p>

  <p>"Waste no more time in talking," cried Leonard, fiercely, and forcing him
  forward as he spoke, "where is Nizza? Lead me to her without an instant's
  delay."</p>

  <p>"A wilful man must have his way," returned Chowles, hurrying up the main
  staircase. "It is not my fault if any harm befalls you."</p>

  <p>They had just gained the landing when a door on the right was suddenly
  thrown open, and Sir Paul Parravicin stood before them. He looked surprised
  and startled at the sight of the apprentice, and angrily demanded his
  business. "I am come for Nizza Macascree," replied Leonard, "whom you and
  Chowles have detained against her will."</p>

  <p>Parravicin glanced sternly and inquiringly at the coffin-maker.</p>

  <p>"I have protested to him that she is not here, Sir Paul," said the latter,
  "but he will not believe me, and has compelled me, by threats of taking my
  life, to bring him and his companion to you."</p>

  <p>"Then take them back again," rejoined Parravicin, turning haughtily upon
  his heel.</p>

  <p>"That answer will not suffice, Sir Paul," cried Leonard&mdash;"I will not
  depart without her."</p>

  <p>"How!" exclaimed the knight, drawing his sword. "Do you dare to intrude
  upon my presence? Begone! or I will punish your presumption." And he prepared
  to attack the apprentice.</p>

  <p>"Advance a footstep," rejoined Leonard, who had never relinquished his
  grasp of Chowles, "and I pass my sword through this man's body. Speak,
  villain," he continued, in a tone so formidable that the coffin-maker shook
  with apprehension&mdash;"is she here or not?" Chowles gazed from him to the
  knight, whose deportment was equally menacing and appeared bewildered with
  terror.</p>

  <p>"It is needless," said Leonard, "your looks answer for you. She
  <i>is</i>."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, I confess she is," replied Chowles.</p>

  <p>"You hear what he says, Sir Paul," remarked Leonard.</p>

  <p>"His fears would make him assert anything," rejoined Parravicin,
  disdainfully. "If you do not depart instantly, I will drive you forth."</p>

  <p>"Sir Paul Parravicin," rejoined Leonard, in an authoritative tone, "I
  command you in the king's name, to deliver up this girl."</p>

  <p>Parravicin laughed scornfully. "The king has no authority here," he
  said.</p>

  <p>"Pardon me, Sir Paul," rejoined Chowles, who began to be seriously alarmed
  at his own situation, and eagerly grasped at the opportunity that offered of
  extricating himself from it&mdash;"pardon me. If it is the king's pleasure
  she should be removed, it materially alters the case, and I can be no party
  to her detention."</p>

  <p>"Both you and your employer will incur his majesty's severest displeasure,
  by detaining her after this notice," remarked Leonard.</p>

  <p>"Before I listen to the young man's request, let him declare that it is
  his intention to deliver her up to the king," rejoined Parravicin,
  coldly.</p>

  <p>"It is my intention to deliver her up to one who has the best right to
  take charge of her," returned Leonard.</p>

  <p>"You mean her father," sneered Parravicin.</p>

  <p>"Ay, but not the person you suppose to be her father," replied Leonard.
  "An important discovery has been made respecting her parentage."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" exclaimed Parravicin, with a look of surprise. "Who has the
  honour to be her father?"</p>

  <p>"A gentleman named Thirlby," replied Leonard.</p>

  <p>"What!" cried Parravicin, starting, and turning pale. "Did you say
  Thirlby?"</p>

  <p>The apprentice reiterated his assertion. Parravicin uttered a deep groan,
  and pressed his hand forcibly against his brow for some moments, during which
  the apprentice watched him narrowly. He then controlled himself by a powerful
  effort, and returned his sword to its scabbard.</p>

  <p>"Come into this room, young man," he said to the apprentice, "and let your
  companion remain outside with Chowles. Fear nothing. I intend you no
  injury."</p>

  <p>"I do not distrust you," replied Leonard, "and if I did, should have no
  apprehension." And motioning Rainbird to remain where he was, he entered the
  room with the knight, who instantly closed the door.</p>

  <p>Parravicin's first proceeding was to question him as to his reasons for
  supposing Nizza to be Thirlby's daughter, and clearly perceiving the deep
  interest his interrogator took in the matter, and the favourable change that,
  from some unknown cause, had been wrought in his sentiments, the apprentice
  did not think fit to hide anything from him. Parravicin's agitation increased
  as he listened to the recital; and at last, overcome by emotion, he sank into
  a chair, and covered his face with his hands. Recovering himself in a short
  time, he arose, and began to pace the chamber to and fro.</p>

  <p>"What I have told you seems to have disturbed you, Sir Paul," remarked
  Leonard. "May I ask the cause of your agitation?"</p>

  <p>"No, man, you may not," replied Parravicin, angrily. And then suddenly
  checking himself, he added, with forced calmness, "And so you parted with Mr.
  Thirlby on London Bridge, and you think he will return to Doctor Hodges's
  residence in Watling-street."</p>

  <p>"I am sure of it," replied Leonard.</p>

  <p>"I must see him without delay," rejoined Parravicin.</p>

  <p>"I will take you to him," remarked Leonard; "but first I must see
  Nizza."</p>

  <p>Parravicin walked to a table, on which stood a small silver bell, and
  ringing it, the summons was immediately answered by an old woman. He was
  about to deliver a message to her, when the disturbed expression of her
  countenance struck him, and he hastily inquired the cause of it.</p>

  <p>"You must not see the young lady to-night, Sir Paul," said the old
  woman.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" demanded the knight, hastily. "Why not?"</p>

  <p>"Because&mdash;but you frighten me so that I dare not speak," was the
  answer.</p>

  <p>"I will frighten you still more if you keep me in this state of suspense,"
  rejoined Parravicin, furiously. "Is she ill?"</p>

  <p>"I fear she has got the plague," returned the old woman. "Now you can see
  her if you think proper."</p>

  <p>"<i>I</i> will see her," said Leonard. "I have no fear of infection."</p>

  <p>The old woman looked hard at Parravicin, as if awaiting his orders. "Yes,
  yes, you can take him to her room," said the knight, who seemed completely
  overpowered by the intelligence, "if he chooses to go thither. But why do you
  suppose it is the plague?"</p>

  <p>"One cannot well be deceived in a seizure of that kind," replied the old
  woman, shaking her head.</p>

  <p>"I thought the disorder never attacked the same person twice," said
  Parravicin.</p>

  <p>"I myself am an instance to the contrary," replied Leonard.</p>

  <p>"And, as you have twice recovered, there may be a chance for Nizza," said
  Parravicin. "This old woman will take you to her. I will hasten to Doctor
  Hodges's residence, and if I should fail in meeting him, will not rest till I
  procure assistance elsewhere. Do not leave her till I return."</p>

  <p>Leonard readily gave a promise to the desired effect, and accompanying him
  to the door, told Rainbird what had happened. The latter agreed to wait below
  to render any assistance that might be required, and went downstairs with
  Parravicin and Chowles. The two latter instantly quitted the house together,
  and hastened to Watling-street.</p>

  <p>With a beating heart, Leonard then followed the old woman to Nizza's
  chamber. They had to pass through a small anteroom, the door of which was
  carefully locked. The suite of apartments occupied by the captive girl were
  exquisitely and luxuriously furnished, and formed a striking contrast to the
  rest of the house. The air was loaded with perfumes; choice pictures adorned
  the walls; and the tables were covered with books and china ornaments. The
  windows, however, were strictly barred, and every precaution appeared to be
  taken to prevent an attempt at escape. Leonard cast an anxious look round as
  he entered the anteroom, and its luxurious air filled him with anxiety. His
  conductress, however, did not allow him time for reflection, but led him into
  another room, still more richly furnished than the first, and lighted by a
  large coloured lamp, that shed a warm glow around it. An old dwarfed African,
  in a fantastic dress, and with a large scimetar stuck in his girdle, stepped
  forward on their approach, and shook his head significantly.</p>

  <p>"He is dumb," said the old woman, "but his gestures are easy to be
  understood. He means that Nizza is worse."</p>

  <p>Leonard heaved a deep sigh. Passing into a third room, they perceived the
  poor girl stretched on a couch placed in a recess at one side. She heard
  their footsteps, and without raising her head, or looking towards them, said,
  in a weak but determined voice&mdash;"Tell your master I will see him no
  more. The plague has again attacked me, and I am glad of it, for it will
  deliver me from him. It will be useless to offer me any remedies, for I will
  not take them."</p>

  <p>"It is not Sir Paul Parravicin," replied the old woman. "I have brought a
  stranger, with whose name I am unacquainted, to see you."</p>

  <p>"Then you have done very wrong," replied Nizza. "I will see no one."</p>

  <p>"Not even me, Nizza?" asked Leonard, advancing. The poor girl started at
  the sound of his voice, and raising herself on one arm, looked wildly towards
  him. As soon as she was satisfied that her fancy did not deceive her, she
  uttered a cry of delight, and falling backwards on the couch, became
  insensible.</p>

  <p>Leonard and the old woman instantly flew to the poor girl's assistance,
  and restoratives being applied, she speedily opened her eyes and fixed them
  tenderly and inquiringly on the apprentice. Before replying to her mute
  interrogatories, Leonard requested the old woman to leave them&mdash;an order
  very reluctantly obeyed&mdash;and as soon as they were left alone, proceeded
  to explain, as briefly as he could, the manner in which he had discovered her
  place of captivity. Nizza listened to his recital with the greatest interest,
  and though evidently suffering acute pain, uttered no complaint, but
  endeavoured to assume an appearance of composure and tranquillity.</p>

  <p>"I must now tell you all that has befallen me since we last met," she
  said, as he concluded. "I will not dwell upon the persecution I endured from
  the king, whose passion increased in proportion to my resistance&mdash;I will
  not dwell upon the arts, the infamous arts, used to induce me to comply with
  his wishes&mdash;neither will I dwell upon the desperate measure I had
  determined to resort to, if driven to the last strait&mdash;nor would I
  mention the subject at all, except to assure you I escaped contamination
  where few escaped it."</p>

  <p>"You need not give me any such assurance," remarked Leonard.</p>

  <p>"While I was thus almost driven to despair," pursued Nizza, "a young
  female who attended me, and affected to deplore my situation, offered to help
  me to escape. I eagerly embraced the offer; and one night, having purloined,
  as she stated, the key of the chamber in which I was lodged, she conducted me
  by a back staircase into the palace-gardens. Thinking myself free, I warmly
  thanked my supposed deliverer, who hurried me towards a gate, at which she
  informed me a man was waiting to guide me to a cottage about a mile from the
  city, where I should be in perfect safety."</p>

  <p>"I see the device," cried Leonard. "But, why&mdash;why did you trust
  her?"</p>

  <p>"What could I do?" rejoined Nizza. "To stay was as bad as to fly, and
  might have been worse. At all events, I had no distrust. My companion opened
  the gate, and called to some person without. It was profoundly dark; but I
  could perceive a carriage, or some other vehicle, at a little distance.
  Alarmed at the sight, I whispered my fears to my companion, and would have
  retreated; but she laid hold of my hand, and detained me. The next moment I
  felt a rude grasp upon my arm. Before I could cry out, a hand was placed over
  my mouth so closely as almost to stifle me; and I was forced into the
  carriage by two persons, who seated themselves on either side of me,
  threatening to put me to death if I made the slightest noise. The carriage
  was then driven off at a furious pace. For some miles it pursued the high
  road, and then struck into a lane, where, in consequence of the deep and
  dangerous ruts, the driver was obliged to relax his speed. But in spite of
  all his caution, one of the wheels sunk into a hole, and in the efforts to
  extricate it, the carriage was overturned. No injury was sustained either by
  me or the others inside, and the door being forced open without much
  difficulty, we were let out. One of my captors kept near me, while the other
  lent his assistance to the coachman to set the carriage to rights. It proved,
  however, to be so much damaged, that it could not proceed; and, after
  considerable delay, my conductors ordered the coachman to remain with it till
  further assistance could be sent; and, taking the horses, one of them,
  notwithstanding my resistance, placed me beside him, and galloped off. Having
  ridden about five miles, we crossed an extensive common, and passed an avenue
  of trees, which brought us to the entrance of an old house. Our arrival
  seemed to be expected; for the instant we appeared, the gate was opened, and
  the old woman you have just seen, and who is called Mrs. Carteret, together
  with a dumb African, named Hassan, appeared at it. Some muttered discourse
  passed between my conductors and these persons, which ended in my being
  committed to the care of Mrs. Carteret who led me upstairs to a
  richly-furnished chamber, and urged me to take some refreshment before I
  retired to rest, which, however, I declined."</p>

  <p>"Still, you saw nothing of Sir Paul Parravicin?" asked Leonard.</p>

  <p>"On going downstairs next morning, he was the first person I beheld,"
  replied Nizza. "Falling upon his knees, he implored my pardon for the
  artifice he had practised, and said he had been compelled to have recourse to
  it in order to save me from the king. He then began to plead his own suit;
  but finding his protestations of passion of no effect, he became yet more
  importunate; when, at this juncture, one of the men who had acted as my
  conductor on the previous night suddenly entered the room, and told him he
  must return to Oxford without an instant's delay, as the king's attendants
  were in search of him. Casting a look at me that made me tremble, he then
  departed; and though I remained more than two months in that house, I saw
  nothing more of him."</p>

  <p>"Did you not attempt to escape during that time?" asked Leonard.</p>

  <p>"I was so carefully watched by Mrs. Carteret and Hassan, that it would
  have been vain to attempt it," she replied. "About a week ago, the two men
  who had conducted me to my place of captivity, again made their appearance,
  and told me I must accompany them to London. I attempted no resistance, well
  aware it would be useless; and as the journey was made by by-roads, three
  days elapsed before we reached the capital. We arrived at night, and I almost
  forgot my own alarm in the terrible sights I beheld at every turn. It would
  have been useless to call out for assistance, for there was no one to afford
  it. I asked my conductors if they had brought me there to die, and they
  answered, sternly, 'It depended on myself.' At Ludgate we met Chowles, the
  coffin-maker, and he brought us to this house. Yesterday, Sir Paul Parravicin
  made his appearance, and told me he had brought me hither to be out of the
  king's way. He then renewed his odious solicitations. I resisted him as
  firmly as before; but he was more determined; and I might have been reduced
  to the last extremity but for your arrival, or for the terrible disorder that
  has seized me. But I have spoken enough of myself. Tell me what has become of
  Amabel?"</p>

  <p>"She, too, has got the plague," replied Leonard, mournfully.</p>

  <p>"Alas! alas!" cried Nizza, bursting into tears; "she is so dear to you,
  that I grieve for her far more than for myself."</p>

  <p>"I have not seen her since I last beheld you," said Leonard, greatly
  touched by the poor girl's devotion. "She was carried off by the Earl of
  Rochester on the same night that you were taken from Kingston Lisle by the
  king."</p>

  <p>"And she has been in his power ever since?" demanded Nizza, eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Ever since," repeated Leonard.</p>

  <p>"The same power that has watched over me, I trust has protected her,"
  cried Nizza, fervently.</p>

  <p>"I cannot doubt it," replied Leonard. "She would now not be alive were it
  otherwise. But I have now something of importance to disclose to you. You
  remember the stranger we met near the plague-pit in Finsbury Fields, and
  whose child I buried?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly," replied Nizza.</p>

  <p>"What if I tell you he is your father?" said Leonard.</p>

  <p>"What!" cried Nizza, in the utmost surprise. "Have I, then, been mistaken
  all these years in supposing the piper to be my father?"</p>

  <p>"You have," replied Leonard. "I cannot explain more to you at present; but
  a few hours will reveal all. Thirlby is the name of your father. Have you
  ever heard it before?"</p>

  <p>"Never," returned Nizza. "It is strange what you tell me. I have often
  reproached myself for not feeling a stronger affection for the piper, who
  always treated me with the kindness of a parent. But it now seems the true
  instinct was wanting. Tell me your reasons for supposing this person to be my
  father."</p>

  <p>As Leonard was about to reply, the door was opened by Mrs. Carteret, who
  said that Sir Paul Parravicin had just returned with Doctor Hodges and
  another gentleman. The words were scarcely uttered, when Thirlby rushed into
  the room, and, flinging himself on his knees before the couch, cried, "At
  last I have found you&mdash;my child! my child!" The surprise which Nizza
  must have experienced at such an address was materially lessened by what
  Leonard had just told her; and, after earnestly regarding the stranger for
  some time, she exclaimed, in a gentle voice, "My father!"</p>

  <p>Thirlby sprang to his feet, and would have folded her in his arms, if
  Doctor Hodges, who by this time had reached the couch, had not prevented him.
  "Touch her not, or you destroy yourself," he cried.</p>

  <p>"I care not if I do," rejoined Thirlby. "The gratification would be
  cheaply purchased at the price of my life; and if I could preserve hers by
  the sacrifice, I would gladly make it."</p>

  <p>"No more of this," cried Hodges, impatiently, "or you will defeat any
  attempt I may make to cure her. You had better not remain here. Your presence
  agitates her."</p>

  <p>Gazing wistfully at his daughter, and scarcely able to tear himself away,
  Thirlby yielded at last to the doctor's advice, and quitted the room. He was
  followed by Leonard, who received a hint to the same effect. On reaching the
  adjoining room, they found Sir Paul Parravicin walking to and fro in an
  agitated manner. He immediately came up to Thirlby, and, in an anxious but
  deferential tone, inquired how he had found Nizza? The latter shook his head,
  and, sternly declining any further conversation, passed on with the
  apprentice to an outer room. He then flung himself into a chair, and appeared
  lost in deep and bitter reflection. Leonard was unwilling to disturb him; but
  at last his own anxieties compelled him to break silence.</p>

  <p>"Can you tell me aught of Amabel?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Alas! no," replied Thirlby, rousing himself. "I have had no time to
  inquire about her, as you shall hear. After leaving you on the bridge, I went
  into Southwark, and hurrying through all the principal streets, inquired from
  every watchman I met whether he had seen any person answering to Doctor
  Hodges's description, but could hear nothing of him. At last I gave up the
  quest, and, retracing my steps, was proceeding along Cannon-street, when I
  descried a person a little in advance of me, whom I thought must be the
  doctor, and, calling out to him, found I was not mistaken. I had just reached
  him, when two other persons turned the corner of Nicholas-lane. On seeing us,
  one of them ran up to the doctor, exclaiming, 'By Heaven, the very person I
  want!' It was Sir Paul Parravicin; and he instantly explained his errand.
  Imagine the feelings with which I heard his account of the illness of my
  daughter. Imagine, also, the horror I must have experienced in recognising in
  her persecutor my&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The sentence was not completed, for at that moment the door was opened by
  Sir Paul Parravicin, who, advancing towards Thirlby, begged, in the same
  deferential tone as before, to have a few words with him.</p>

  <p>"I might well refuse you," replied Thirlby, sternly, "but it is necessary
  we should have some explanation of what has occurred."</p>

  <p>"It is," rejoined Parravicin, "and, therefore, I have sought you." Thirlby
  arose, and accompanied the knight into the outer room, closing the door after
  him. More than a quarter of an hour&mdash;it seemed an age to
  Leonard&mdash;elapsed, and still no one came. Listening intently, he heard
  voices in the next room. They were loud and angry, as if in quarrel. Then all
  was quiet, and at last Thirlby reappeared, and took his seat beside him.</p>

  <p>"Have you seen Doctor Hodges?" inquired the apprentice, eagerly.</p>

  <p>"I have," replied Thirlby&mdash;"and he speaks favourably of my poor
  child. He has administered all needful remedies, but as it is necessary to
  watch their effect, he will remain with her some time longer."</p>

  <p>"And, meanwhile, I shall know nothing of Amabel," cried Leonard, in a tone
  of bitter disappointment.</p>

  <p>"Your anxiety is natural," returned Thirlby, "but you may rest satisfied,
  if Doctor Hodges has seen her, he has done all that human aid can effect. But
  as you must perforce wait his coming forth, I will endeavour to beguile the
  tedious interval by relating to you so much of my history as refers to Nizza
  Macascree."</p>

  <p>After a brief pause, he commenced. "You must know, then, that in my youth
  I became desperately enamoured of a lady named Isabella Morley. She was most
  beautiful&mdash;but I need not enlarge upon her attractions, since you have
  beheld her very image in Nizza. When I first met her she was attached to
  another, but I soon rid myself of my rival. I quarrelled with him, and slew
  him in a duel. After a long and urgent suit, for the successful issue of
  which I was mainly indebted to my rank and wealth, which gave great influence
  with her parents, Isabella became mine. But I soon found out she did not love
  me. In consequence of this discovery, I became madly jealous, and embittered
  her life and my own by constant, and, now I know too well, groundless
  suspicions. She had borne me a son, and in the excess of my jealous fury,
  fancying the child was not my own, I threatened to put it to death. This
  violence led to the unhappy result I am about to relate. Another child was
  born, a daughter&mdash;need I say Nizza, or to give her her proper name,
  Isabella, for she was so christened after her mother&mdash;and one
  night&mdash;one luckless night,&mdash;maddened by some causeless doubt, I
  snatched the innocent babe from her mother's arms, and if I had not been
  prevented by the attendants, who rushed into the room on hearing their
  mistress's shrieks, should have destroyed her. After awhile, I became
  pacified, and on reviewing my conduct more calmly on the morrow, bitterly
  reproached myself, and hastened to express my penitence to my wife. 'You will
  never have an opportunity of repeating your violence,' she said; 'the object
  of your cruel and unfounded suspicions is gone.'&mdash;'Gone!' I exclaimed;
  'whither?' And as I spoke I looked around the chamber. But the babe was
  nowhere to be seen. In answer to my inquiries, my wife admitted that she had
  caused her to be removed to a place of safety, but refused, even on my most
  urgent entreaties, accompanied by promises of amended conduct, to tell me
  where. I next interrogated the servants, but they professed entire ignorance
  of the matter. For three whole days I made ineffectual search for the child,
  and offered large rewards to any one who would bring her to me. But they
  failed to produce her; and repairing to my wife's chamber, I threatened her
  with the most terrible consequences if she persisted in her vindictive
  project. She defied me, and, transported with rage, I passed my sword through
  her body, exclaiming as I dealt the murderous blow, 'You have sent the brat
  to her father&mdash;to your lover, madam.' Horror and remorse seized me the
  moment I had committed the ruthless act, and I should have turned my sword
  against myself, if I had not been stayed by the cry of my poor victim, who
  implored me to hold my hand. 'Do not add crime to crime,' she cried; 'you
  have done me grievous wrong. I have not, indeed, loved you, because my
  affections were not under my control, but I have been ever true to you, and
  this I declare with my latest breath. I freely forgive you, and pray God to
  turn your heart.' And with these words she expired. I was roused from the
  stupefaction into which I was thrown by the appearance of the servants.
  Heaping execrations upon me, they strove to seize me; but I broke through
  them, and gained a garden at the back of my mansion, which was situated on
  the bank of the Thames, not far from Chelsea. This garden ran down to the
  river side, and was defended by a low wall, which I leapt, and plunged into
  the stream. A boat was instantly sent in pursuit of me, and a number of
  persons ran along the banks, all eager for my capture. But being an excellent
  swimmer, I tried to elude them, and as I never appeared again, it was
  supposed I was drowned."</p>

  <p>"And Nizza, or as I ought now to call her, Isabella, was confided, I
  suppose, to the piper?" inquired Leonard.</p>

  <p>"She was confided to his helpmate," replied Thirlby, "who had been nurse
  to my wife. Mike Macascree was one of my father's servants, and was in his
  younger days a merry, worthless fellow. The heavy calamity under which he now
  labours had not then befallen him. On taking charge of my daughter, his wife
  received certain papers substantiating the child's origin, together with a
  miniature, and a small golden amulet. The papers and miniature were delivered
  by her on her death-bed to the piper, who showed them to me to-night."</p>

  <p>"And the amulet I myself have seen," remarked Leonard.</p>

  <p>"To resume my own history," said Thirlby&mdash;"after the dreadful
  catastrophe I have related, I remained concealed in London for some months,
  and was glad to find the report of my death generally believed. I then passed
  over into Holland, where I resided for several years, in the course of which
  time I married the widow of a rich merchant, who died soon after our union,
  leaving me one child." And he covered his face with his hands to hide his
  emotion. After awhile he proceeded:</p>

  <p>"Having passed many years, as peacefully as one whose conscience was so
  heavily burdened as mine could hope to pass them, in Amsterdam, I last summer
  brought my daughter, around whom my affections were closely twined, to
  London, and took up my abode in the eastern environs of the city. There again
  I was happy&mdash;too happy!&mdash;until at last the plague came. But why
  should I relate the rest of my sad story?" he added, in a voice suffocated
  with emotion&mdash;"you know it as well as I do."</p>

  <p>"You said you had a son," observed Leonard, after a pause&mdash;"Is he yet
  living?"</p>

  <p>"He is," replied Thirlby, a shade passing over his countenance. "On my
  return to England I communicated to him through Judith Malmayns, who is my
  foster-sister, that I was still alive, telling him the name I had adopted,
  and adding, I should never disturb him in the possession of his title and
  estates."</p>

  <p>"Title!" exclaimed Leonard.</p>

  <p>"Ay, title!" echoed Thirlby. "The title I once bore was that of Lord
  Argentine."</p>

  <p>"I am glad to hear it," said Leonard, "for I began to fear Sir Paul
  Parravicin was your son."</p>

  <p>"Sir Paul Parravicin, or, rather, the Lord Argentine, for such is his
  rightful title, <i>is</i> my son," returned Thirlby; "and I lament to own I
  am his father. When among his worthless associates,&mdash;nay, even with the
  king&mdash;he drops the higher title, and assumes that by which you have
  known him; and it is well he does so, for his actions are sufficient to
  tarnish a far nobler name than that he bears. Owing to this disguise I knew
  not he was the person who carried off my daughter. But, thank Heaven, another
  and fouler crime has been spared us. All these things have been strangely
  explained to me to-night. And thus, you see, young man, the poor piper's
  daughter turns out to be the Lady Isabella Argentine." Before an answer could
  be returned, the door was opened by Hodges, and both starting to their feet,
  hurried towards him.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch4-4"
     name="ch4-4">IV. &mdash; THE TRIALS OF AMABEL.</a></h2>

  <p>It will now be necessary to return to the period of Amabel's abduction
  from Kingston Lisle. The shawl thrown over her head prevented her cries from
  being heard; and, notwithstanding her struggles, she was placed on horseback
  before a powerful man, who galloped off with her along the Wantage-road.
  After proceeding at a rapid pace for about two miles, her conductor came to a
  halt, and she could distinguish the sound of other horsemen approaching. At
  first she hoped it might prove a rescue; but she was quickly undeceived. The
  shawl was removed, and she beheld the Earl of Rochester, accompanied by
  Pillichody, and some half-dozen mounted attendants. The earl would have
  transferred her to his own steed, but she offered such determined resistance
  to the arrangement, that he was compelled to content himself with riding by
  her aide. All his efforts to engage her in conversation were equally
  unsuccessful. She made no reply to his remarks, but averted her gaze from
  him; and, whenever he approached, shrank from him with abhorrence. The earl,
  however, was not easily repulsed, but continued his attentions and discourse,
  as if both had been favourably received.</p>

  <p>In this way they proceeded for some miles, one of the earl's attendants,
  who was well acquainted with the country, being in fact a native of it,
  serving as their guide. They had quitted the Wantage-road, and leaving that
  ancient town, renowned as the birthplace of the great Alfred, on the right,
  had taken the direction of Abingdon and Oxford. It was a lovely evening, and
  their course led them through many charming places. But the dreariest waste
  would have been as agreeable as the richest prospect to Amabel. She noted
  neither the broad meadows, yet white from the scythe, nor the cornfields
  waving with their deep and abundant, though yet immature crops; nor did she
  cast even a passing glance at any one of those green spots which every lane
  offers, and upon which the eye of the traveller ordinarily delights to
  linger. She rode beneath a natural avenue of trees, whose branches met
  overhead like the arches of a cathedral, and was scarcely conscious of their
  pleasant shade. She heard neither the song of the wooing thrush, nor the cry
  of the startled blackbird, nor the evening hymn of the soaring lark. Alike to
  her was the gorse-covered common, along which they swiftly speeded, and the
  steep hill-side up which they more swiftly mounted. She breathed not the
  delicious fragrance of the new-mown hay, nor listened to the distant lowing
  herds, the bleating sheep, or the cawing rooks. She thought of nothing but
  her perilous situation,&mdash;heard nothing but the voice of
  Rochester,&mdash;felt nothing but the terror inspired by his presence.</p>

  <p>As the earl did not desire to pass through any village, if he could help
  it, his guide led him along the most unfrequented roads; but in spite of his
  caution, an interruption occurred which had nearly resulted in Amabel's
  deliverance. While threading a narrow lane, they came suddenly upon a troop
  of haymakers, in a field on the right, who, up to that moment, had been
  hidden from view by the high hedges. On seeing them, Amabel screamed loudly
  for assistance, and was instantly answered by their shouts. Rochester ordered
  his men to gallop forward, but the road winding round the meadow, the
  haymakers were enabled to take a shorter cut and intercept them. Leaping the
  hedge, a stout fellow rushed towards Amabel's conductor, and seized the
  bridle of his steed. He was followed by two others, who would have instantly
  liberated the captive girl, if the earl had not, with great presence of mind,
  cried out, "Touch her not, as you value your lives! She is ill of the
  plague!"</p>

  <p>At this formidable announcement, which operated like magic upon Amabel's
  defenders, and made them fall back more quickly than the weapons of the
  earl's attendants could have done, they retreated, and communicating their
  fears to their comrades, who were breaking through the hedge in all
  directions, and hurrying to their aid, the whole band took to their heels,
  and, regardless of Amabel's continued shrieks, never stopped till they
  supposed themselves out of the reach of infection. The earl was thus at
  liberty to pursue his way unmolested, and laughing heartily at the success of
  his stratagem, and at the consternation he had created among the haymakers,
  pressed forward.</p>

  <p>Nothing further occurred till, in crossing the little river Ock, near
  Lyford, the horse ridden by Amabel's conductor missed its footing, and
  precipitated them both into the water. No ill consequences followed the
  accident. Throwing himself into the shallow stream, Rochester seized Amabel,
  and placed her beside him on his own steed. A deathly paleness overspread her
  countenance, and a convulsion shook her frame as she was thus brought into
  contact with the earl, who, fearing the immersion might prove dangerous in
  her present delicate state of health, quickened his pace to procure
  assistance. Before he had proceeded a hundred yards, Amabel fainted. Gazing
  at her with admiration, and pressing her inanimate frame to his breast,
  Rochester imprinted a passionate kiss on her cheek.</p>

  <p>"By my soul!" he mentally ejaculated, "I never thought I could be so
  desperately enamoured. I would not part with her for the crown of these
  realms."</p>

  <p>While considering whither he should take her, and much alarmed at her
  situation, the man who acted as guide came to his relief. Halting till the
  earl came up, he said, "If you want assistance for the young lady, my lord, I
  can take you to a good country inn, not far from this, where she will be well
  attended to, and where, as it is kept by my father, I can answer that no
  questions will be asked."</p>

  <p>"Precisely what I wish, Sherborne," replied Rochester. "We will halt there
  for the night. Ride on as fast as you can."</p>

  <p>Sherborne struck spurs into his steed, and passing Kingston Bagpuze,
  reached the high road between Abingdon and Faringdon, at the corner of which
  stood the inn in question,&mdash;a good-sized habitation, with large stables
  and a barn attached to it. Here he halted, and calling out in a loud and
  authoritative voice, the landlord instantly answered the summons; and, on
  being informed by his son of the rank of his guest, doffed his cap, and
  hastened to assist the earl to dismount. But Rochester declined his services,
  and bidding him summon his wife, she shortly afterwards made her appearance
  in the shape of a stout middle-aged dame. Committing Amabel to her care, the
  earl then alighted, and followed them into the house.</p>

  <p>The Plough, for so the inn was denominated, was thrown into the utmost
  confusion by the arrival of the earl and his suite. All the ordinary
  frequenters of the inn were ejected, while the best parlour was instantly
  prepared for the accommodation of his lordship and Pillichody. But Rochester
  was far more anxious for Amabel than himself, and could not rest for a moment
  till assured by Dame Sherborne that she was restored to sensibility, and
  about to retire to rest. He then became easy, and sat down to supper with
  Pillichody. So elated was he by his success, that, yielding to his natural
  inclination for hard drinking, he continued to revel so freely and so long
  with his follower, that daybreak found them over their wine, the one toasting
  the grocer's daughter, and the other Patience, when they both staggered off
  to bed.</p>

  <p>A couple of hours sufficed Rochester to sleep off the effects of his
  carouse. At six o'clock he arose, and ordered his attendants to prepare to
  set out without delay. When all was ready, he sent for Amabel, but she
  refused to come downstairs, and finding his repeated messages of no avail, he
  rushed into her room, and bore her, shrieking to his steed.</p>

  <p>In an hour after this, they arrived at an old hall, belonging to the earl,
  in the neighbourhood of Oxford. Amabel was entrusted to the care of a female
  attendant, named Prudence, and towards evening, Rochester, who was burning
  with impatience for an interview, learnt, to his infinite disappointment,
  that she was so seriously unwell, that if he forced himself into her
  presence, her life might be placed in jeopardy. She continued in the same
  state for several days, at the end of which time, the chirurgeon who attended
  her, and who was a creature of the earl's, pronounced her out of danger.
  Rochester then sent her word by Prudence that he must see her in the course
  of that day, and a few hours after the delivery of the message, he sought her
  room. She was much enfeebled by illness, but received him with great
  self-possession.</p>

  <p>"I cannot believe, my lord," she said, "that you desire to destroy me, and
  when I assure you&mdash;solemnly assure you, that if you continue to
  persecute me thus, my death, will be the consequence, I am persuaded you will
  desist, and suffer me to depart."</p>

  <p>"Amabel," rejoined the earl, passionately, "is it possible you can be so
  changed towards me? Nothing now interferes to prevent our union."</p>

  <p>"Except my own determination to the contrary, my lord," she replied. "I
  can never be yours."</p>

  <p>"Wherefore not?" asked the earl, half angrily, half reproachfully.</p>

  <p>"Because I know and feel that I should condemn myself to wretchedness,"
  she replied. "Because&mdash;for since your lordship will force the truth from
  me, I must speak out&mdash;I have learnt to regard your character in its true
  light,&mdash;and because my heart is wedded to heaven."</p>

  <p>"Pshaw!" exclaimed the earl, contemptuously; "you have been listening so
  long to your saintly father's discourses, that you fancy them applicable to
  yourself. But you are mistaken in me," he added, altering his tone; "I see
  where the main difficulty lies. You think I am about to delude you, as
  before, into a mock marriage. But I swear to you you are mistaken. I love you
  so well that I would risk my temporal and eternal happiness for you. It will
  rejoice me to raise you to my own rank&mdash;to place you among the radiant
  beauties of our sovereign's court, the brightest of whom you will outshine,
  and to devote my whole life to your happiness."</p>

  <p>"It is too late," sighed Amabel.</p>

  <p>"Why too late?" cried the earl, imploringly. "We have gone through severe
  trials, it is true. I have been constantly baffled in my pursuit of you, but
  disappointment has only made me love you more devotedly. Why too late? What
  is to prevent our nuptials from taking place
  to-day&mdash;to-morrow&mdash;when you will? The king himself shall be present
  at the ceremony, and shall give you away. Will this satisfy your scruples. I
  know I have offended you. I know I deserve your anger. But the love that
  prompted me to act thus, must also plead my pardon."</p>

  <p>"Strengthen me!" she murmured, looking supplicatingly upwards. "Strengthen
  me, for my trial is very severe."</p>

  <p>"Be not deceived, Amabel," continued Rochester, yet more ardently; "that
  you love me I am well assured, however strongly you may at this moment
  persuade yourself to the contrary. Be not governed by your father's
  strait-laced and puritanical opinions. Men, such as he is, cannot judge of
  fiery natures like mine. I myself have had to conquer a stubborn and
  rebellious spirit,&mdash;the demon pride. But I have conquered. Love has
  achieved the victory,&mdash;love for you. I offer you my heart, my hand, my
  title. A haughty noble makes this offer to a grocer's daughter. Can
  you&mdash;will you refuse me?"</p>

  <p>"I can and do, my lord," she replied. "I have achieved a yet harder
  victory. With me, principle has conquered love. I no longer respect you, no
  longer love you&mdash;and, therefore, cannot wed you."</p>

  <p>"Rash and obstinate girl," cried the earl, unable to conceal his
  mortification; "you will bitterly repent your inconsiderate conduct. I offer
  you devotion such as no other person could offer you, and rank such as no
  other is likely to offer you. You are now in my power, and you <i>shall</i>
  be mine,&mdash;in what way rests with yourself. You shall have a week to
  consider the matter. At the end of that time, I will again renew my proposal.
  If you accept it, well and good. If not, you know the alternative." And
  without waiting for a reply, he quitted the room.</p>

  <p>He was as good as his word. During the whole of the week allowed Amabel
  for consideration, he never intruded upon her, nor was his name at any time
  mentioned by her attendants. If she had been, indeed, Countess of Rochester,
  she could not have been treated with greater respect than was shown her. The
  apartment allotted her opened upon a large garden, surrounded by high walls,
  and she walked within it daily. Her serenity of mind remained undisturbed;
  her health visibly improved; and, what was yet more surprising, she entirely
  recovered her beauty. The whole of her time not devoted to exercise, was
  spent in reading, or in prayer. On the appointed day, Rochester presented
  himself. She received him with the most perfect composure, and with a bland
  look, from which he augured favourably. He waved his hand to the attendants,
  and they were alone.</p>

  <p>"I came for your answer, Amabel," he said; "but I scarcely require it,
  being convinced from your looks that I have nothing to fear. Oh! why did you
  not abridge this tedious interval? Why not inform me you had altered your
  mind? But I will not reproach you. I am too happy to complain of the
  delay?"</p>

  <p>"I must undeceive you, my lord," returned Amabel, gravely. "No change has
  taken place in my feelings. I still adhere to the resolution I had come to
  when we last parted."</p>

  <p>"How!" exclaimed the earl, his countenance darkening, and the evil look
  which Amabel had before noticed taking possession of it. "One moment lured
  on, and next rebuffed. But no&mdash;no!" he added, constraining himself, "you
  cannot mean it. It is not in woman's nature to act thus. You have loved
  me&mdash;you love me still. Make me happy&mdash;make yourself happy."</p>

  <p>"My lord," she replied, "strange and unnatural as my conduct may appear,
  you will find it consistent. You have lost the sway you had once over me,
  and, for the reasons I have already given you, I can never be yours."</p>

  <p>"Oh, recall your words, Amabel," he cried, in the most moving tones he
  could command; "if you have no regard for me&mdash;at least have compassion.
  I will quit the court if you desire it; will abandon title, rank, wealth; and
  live in the humblest station with you. You know not what I am capable of when
  under the dominion of passion. I am capable of the darkest crimes, or of the
  brightest virtues. The woman who has a man's heart in her power may mould it
  to her own purposes, be they good or ill. Reject me, and you drive me to
  despair, and plunge me into guilt. Accept me, and you may lead me into any
  course, you please."</p>

  <p>"Were I assured of this&mdash;" cried Amabel.</p>

  <p>"Rest assured of it," returned the earl, passionately. "Oh, yield to
  impulses of natural affection, and do not suffer a cold and calculating creed
  to chill your better feelings. How many a warm and loving heart has been so
  frozen! Do not let yours be one of them. Be mine! be mine!"</p>

  <p>Amabel looked at him earnestly for a moment; while he, assured that he had
  gained his point, could not conceal a slightly triumphant smile.</p>

  <p>"Now, your answer!" he cried. "My life hangs upon it."</p>

  <p>"I am still unmoved," she replied, coldly, and firmly.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" exclaimed the earl with a terrible imprecation, and starting to his
  feet. "You refuse me. Be it so. But think not that you shall escape me. No,
  you are in my power, and I will use it. You shall be mine and without the
  priest's interference. I will not degrade myself by an alliance with one so
  lowly born. The strongest love is nearest allied to hatred, and mine has
  become hatred&mdash;bitter hatred. You shall be mine, I tell you, and when I
  am indifferent to you, I will cast you off. Then, when you are neglected,
  despised, shunned, you will regret&mdash;deeply but unavailingly&mdash;your
  rejection of my proposals."</p>

  <p>"No, my lord, I shall never regret it," replied Amabel, "and I cannot
  sufficiently rejoice that I did not yield to the momentary weakness that
  inclined me to accept them. I thank you for the insight you have afforded me
  into your character."</p>

  <p>"You have formed an erroneous opinion of me, Amabel," cried the earl,
  seeing his error, and trying to correct it. "I am well nigh distracted by
  conflicting emotions. Oh, forgive my violence&mdash;forget it."</p>

  <p>"Readily," she replied; "but think not I attach the least credit to your
  professions."</p>

  <p>"Away, then, with further disguise," returned the earl, relapsing into his
  furious mood, "and recognise in me the person I am&mdash;or, rather the
  person you would have me be. You say you are immovable. So am I; nor will I
  further delay my purpose."</p>

  <p>Amabel, who had watched him uneasily during this speech, retreated a step,
  and taking a small dagger from a handkerchief in which she kept it concealed,
  placed its point against her breast.</p>

  <p>"I well know whom I have to deal with, my lord," she said, "and am,
  therefore, provided against the last extremity. Attempt to touch me, and I
  plunge this dagger into my heart."</p>

  <p>"Your sense of religion will not allow you to commit so desperate a deed,"
  replied the earl, derisively.</p>

  <p>"My blood be upon your head, my lord," she rejoined; "for it is your hand
  that strikes the blow, and not my own. My honour is dearer to me than life,
  and I will unhesitatingly sacrifice the one to preserve the other. I have no
  fear but that the action, wrongful though it be, will be forgiven me."</p>

  <p>"Hold!" exclaimed the earl, seeing from her determined look and manner
  that she would unquestionably execute her purpose. "I have no desire to drive
  you to destruction. Think over what I have said to you, and we will renew the
  subject tomorrow."</p>

  <p>"Renew it when you please, my lord, my answer will still be the same," she
  replied. "I have but one refuge from you&mdash;the grave&mdash;and thither,
  if need be, I will fly." And as she spoke, she moved slowly towards the
  adjoining chamber, the door of which she fastened after her.</p>

  <p>"I thought I had some experience of her sex," said Rochester to himself,
  "but I find I was mistaken. To-morrow's mood, however, may be unlike
  to-day's. At all events, I must take my measures differently."</p>

  <p>* * * * *</p>

  <h2><a id="ch4-5"
     name="ch4-5">V. &mdash; THE MARRIAGE AND ITS CONSEQUENCES.</a></h2>

  <p>Unwilling to believe he had become an object of aversion to Amabel,
  Rochester renewed his solicitations on the following day, and calling into
  play his utmost fascination of manner, endeavoured to remove any ill
  impression produced by his previous violence. She was proof, however, against
  his arts; and though he never lost his mastery over himself, he had some
  difficulty in concealing his chagrin at the result of the interview. He now
  began to adopt a different course, and entering into long discussions with
  Amabel, strove by every effort of wit and ridicule, to shake and subvert her
  moral and religious principles. But here again he failed; and once more
  shifting his ground, affected to be convinced by her arguments. He entirely
  altered his demeanour, and though Amabel could not put much faith in the
  change, it was a subject of real rejoicing to her. Though scarcely conscious
  of it herself, he sensibly won upon her regards, and she passed many hours of
  each day in his society without finding it irksome. Seeing the advantage he
  had gained, and well aware that he should lose it by the slightest
  indiscretion, Rochester acted with the greatest caution. The more at ease she
  felt with him, the more deferential did he become; and before she was
  conscious of her danger, the poor girl was once more on the brink of the
  precipice.</p>

  <p>It was about this time that Leonard Holt, as has been previously
  intimated, discovered her retreat, and contrived, by clambering up a
  pear-tree which was nailed against the wall of the house, to reach her
  chamber-window. Having received her assurance that she had resisted all
  Rochester's importunities, the apprentice promised to return on the following
  night with means to affect her liberation, and departed. Fully persuaded that
  she could now repose confidence in the earl, Amabel acquainted him, the next
  morning, with Leonard's visit, adding that he would now have an opportunity
  of proving the sincerity of his professions by delivering her up to her
  friends.</p>

  <p>"Since you desire it," replied the earl, who heard her with an unmoved
  countenance, though internally torn with passion, "I will convey you to your
  father myself. I had hoped," he added with a sigh, "that we should never part
  again."</p>

  <p>"I fear I have been mistaken in you, my lord," rejoined Amabel,
  half-repenting her frankness.</p>

  <p>"Not so," he replied. "I will do anything you require, except deliver you
  to this hateful apprentice. If it is your pleasure, I repeat, I will take you
  back to your father."</p>

  <p>"Promise me this, my lord, and I shall be quite easy," cried Amabel,
  joyfully.</p>

  <p>"I do promise it," he returned. "But oh! why not stay with me, and
  complete the good work you have begun?"</p>

  <p>Amabel averted her head, and Rochester sighing deeply, quitted the room.
  An attendant shortly afterwards came to inform her that the earl intended to
  start for London without delay, and begged her to prepare for the journey. In
  an hour's time, a carriage drove to the door, and Rochester having placed her
  and Prudence in it, mounted his horse, and set forth. Late on the second day
  they arrived in London, and passing through the silent and deserted streets,
  the aspect of which struck terror into all the party, shaped their course
  towards the city. Presently they reached Ludgate, but instead of proceeding
  to Wood-street, the carriage turned off on the right, and traversing
  Thames-street, crossed London Bridge. Amabel could obtain no explanation of
  this change from Prudence; and her uneasiness was not diminished when the
  vehicle, which was driven down a narrow street on the left immediately after
  quitting the bridge, stopped at the entrance of a large court-yard.
  Rochester, who had already dismounted, assisted her to alight, and in answer
  to her hasty inquiries why he had brought her thither, told her he thought it
  better to defer taking her to her father till the morrow. Obliged to be
  content with this excuse, she was led into the house, severely reproaching
  herself for her indiscretion. Nothing, however, occurred to alarm her that
  night. The earl was even more deferential than before, and assuring her he
  would fulfil his promise in the morning, confided her to Prudence.</p>

  <p>The house whither she had been brought was large and old-fashioned. The
  rooms had once been magnificently fitted up, but the hangings and furniture
  were much faded, and had a gloomy and neglected air. This was especially
  observable in the sleeping-chamber appointed for her reception. It was large
  and lofty, panelled with black and shining oak, with a highly-polished floor
  of the same material, and was filled with cumbrous chests and cabinets, and
  antique high-backed chairs. But the most noticeable object was a large
  state-bed, with a heavy square canopy, covered, with the richest damask,
  woven with gold, and hung with curtains of the same stuff, though now decayed
  and tarnished. A chill crept over Amabel as she gazed around.</p>

  <p>"I cannot help thinking," she observed to Prudence, "that I shall breathe
  my last in this room, and in that bed."</p>

  <p>"I hope not, madam," returned the attendant, unable to repress a
  shudder.</p>

  <p>Nothing more was said, and Amabel retired to rest. But not being able to
  sleep, and having vainly tried to compose herself, she arose and opened the
  window. It was a serene and beautiful night, and she could see the smooth
  river sparkling in the starlight, and flowing at a hundred yards' distance at
  the foot of the garden. Beyond, she could indistinctly perceive the outline
  of the mighty city, while nearer, on the left, lay the bridge. Solemnly
  across the water came the sound of innumerable bells, tolling for those who
  had died of the plague, and were now being borne to their last home. While
  listening to these sad sounds, another, but more doleful and appalling noise,
  caught her ears. It was the rumbling of cart-wheels in the adjoining street,
  accompanied by the ringing of a hand-bell, while a hoarse-voice cried, "Bring
  out your dead! bring out your dead!" On hearing this cry, she closed the
  window and retired. Morning broke before sleep visited her weary eyelids, and
  then, overcome by fatigue, she dropped into a slumber, from which she did not
  awake until the day was far advanced. She found Prudence sitting by her
  bedside, and alarmed by the expression of her countenance, anxiously inquired
  what was the matter?</p>

  <p>"Alas! madam," replied the attendant, "the earl has been taken suddenly
  ill. He set out for Wood-street the first thing this morning, and has seen
  your father, who refuses to receive you. On his return, he complained of a
  slight sickness, which has gradually increased in violence, and there can be
  little doubt it is the plague. Advice has been sent for. He prays you not to
  disturb yourself on his account, but to consider yourself sole mistress of
  this house, whatever may befall him."</p>

  <p>Amabel passed a miserably anxious day. A fresh interest had been awakened
  in her heart in behalf of the earl, and the precarious state in which she
  conceived him placed did not tend to diminish it. She made many inquiries
  after him, and learned that he was worse, while the fearful nature of the
  attack could not be questioned. On the following day Prudence reported that
  the distemper had made such rapid and terrible progress, that his recovery
  was considered almost hopeless.</p>

  <p>"He raves continually of you, madam," said the attendant, "and I have no
  doubt he will expire with your name on his lips."</p>

  <p>Amabel was moved to tears by the information, and withdrawing into a
  corner of the room, prayed fervently for the supposed sufferer. Prudence
  gazed at her earnestly and compassionately, and muttering something to
  herself, quitted the room. The next day was the critical one (so it was said)
  for the earl, and Amabel awaited, in tearful anxiety, the moment that was to
  decide his fate. It came, and he was pronounced out of danger. When the news
  was brought the anxious girl, she fainted.</p>

  <p>A week passed, and the earl, continued to improve, and all danger of
  infection&mdash;if any such existed&mdash;being at an end, he sent a message
  to Amabel, beseeching her to grant him an interview in his own room. She
  willingly assented, and, following the attendant, found him stretched upon a
  couch. In spite of his paleness and apparent debility, however, his good
  looks were but little impaired, and his attire, though negligent, was
  studiously arranged for effect. On Amabel's appearance he made an effort to
  rise, but she hastened to prevent him. After thanking her for her kind
  inquiries, he entered into a long conversation with her, in the course of
  which he displayed sentiments so exactly coinciding with her own, that the
  good opinion she had already begun to entertain for him was soon heightened
  into the liveliest interest. They parted, to meet again on the following
  day&mdash;and on the day following that. The bloom returned to the earl's
  countenance, and he looked handsomer than ever. A week thus passed, and at
  the end of it, he said&mdash;"To-morrow I shall be well enough to venture
  forth again, and my first business shall be to proceed to your father, and
  see whether he is now able to receive you."</p>

  <p>"The plague has not yet abated, my lord," she observed, blushingly.</p>

  <p>"True," he replied, looking passionately at her. "Oh, forgive me, Amabel,"
  he added, taking her hand, which she did not attempt to withdraw. "Forgive
  me, if I am wrong. But I now think your feelings are altered towards me, and
  that I may venture to hope you will be mine?"</p>

  <p>Amabel's bosom heaved with emotion. She tried to speak, but could not. Her
  head declined upon his shoulder, and her tears flowed fast. "I am answered,"
  he cried, scarcely able to contain his rapture, and straining her to his
  bosom.</p>

  <p>"I know not whether I am doing rightly," she murmured, gazing at him
  through her tears, "but I believe you mean me truly. God forgive you if you
  do not."</p>

  <p>"Have no more doubts," cried the earl. "You have wrought an entire change
  in me. Our union shall not be delayed an hour. It shall take place in Saint
  Saviour's to-night."</p>

  <p>"Not to-night," cried Amabel, trembling at his eagerness&mdash;"to-
  morrow."</p>

  <p>"To-night, to-night!" reiterated the earl, victoriously. And he rushed out
  of the room.</p>

  <p>Amabel was no sooner left to herself than she repented what she had done.
  "I fear I have made a false step," she mused; "but it is now too late to
  retreat, and I will hope for the best. He cannot mean to deceive me."</p>

  <p>Her meditations were interrupted by the entrance of Prudence, who came
  towards her with a face full of glee. "My lord has informed me of the good
  news," she said. "You are to be wedded to him to-day. I have expected it all
  along, but it is somewhat sudden at last. He is gone in search of the priest,
  and in the mean time has ordered me to attire you for the ceremony. I have
  several rich dresses for your ladyship&mdash;for so I must now call
  you&mdash;to choose from."</p>

  <p>"The simplest will suit me best," replied Amabel, "and do not call me
  ladyship till I have a right to that title."</p>

  <p>"That will be so soon that I am sure there can be no harm in using it
  now," returned Prudence. "But pray let me show you the dresses."</p>

  <p>Amabel suffered herself to be led into another room, where she saw several
  sumptuous female habiliments, and selecting the least showy of them, was soon
  arrayed in it by the officious attendant. More than two hours elapsed before
  Rochester returned, when he entered Amabel's chamber, accompanied by Sir
  George Etherege and Pillichody. A feeling of misgiving crossed Amabel, as she
  beheld his companions.</p>

  <p>"I have had some difficulty in finding a clergyman," said the earl, "for
  the rector of Saint Saviour's has fled from the plague. His curate, however,
  will officiate for him, and is now in the church."</p>

  <p>Amabel fixed a searching look upon him. "Why are these gentlemen here?"
  she asked.</p>

  <p>"I have brought them with me," rejoined Rochester, "because, as they were
  aware of the injury I once intended you, I wish them to be present at its
  reparation."</p>

  <p>"I am satisfied," she replied.</p>

  <p>Taking her hand, the earl then led her to a carriage, which conveyed them
  to Saint Saviour's. Just as they alighted, the dead-cart passed, and several
  bodies were brought towards it. Eager to withdraw her attention from the
  spectacle, Rochester hurried her into the old and beautiful church. In
  another moment they were joined by Etherege and Pillichody, and they
  proceeded to the altar, where the priest, a young man, was standing. The
  ceremony was then performed, and the earl led his bride back to the carriage.
  On their return they had to undergo another ill-omened interruption. The
  dead-cart was stationed near the gateway, and some delay occurred before it
  could be moved forward.</p>

  <p>Amabel, however, suffered no further misgiving to take possession of her.
  Deeming herself wedded to the earl, she put no constraint on her affection
  for him, and her happiness, though short-lived, was deep and full. A month
  passed away like a dream of delight. Nothing occurred in the slightest degree
  to mar her felicity. Rochester seemed only to live for her&mdash;to think
  only of her. At the end of this time, some indifference began to manifest
  itself in his deportment to her, and he evinced a disposition to return to
  the court and to its pleasures.</p>

  <p>"I thought you had for ever abandoned them, my dear lord," said Amabel,
  reproachfully.</p>

  <p>"For awhile I have," he replied, carelessly.</p>

  <p>"You must leave me, if you return to them," she rejoined.</p>

  <p>"If I must, I must," said the earl.</p>

  <p>"You cannot mean this, my lord," she cried, bursting into tears. "You
  cannot be so changed."</p>

  <p>"I have never changed since you first knew me," replied Rochester.</p>

  <p>"Impossible!" she cried, in a tone of anguish; "you have not the
  faults&mdash;the vices, you once had."</p>

  <p>"I know not what you call faults and vices, madam," replied the earl
  sharply, "but I have the same qualities as heretofore.</p>

  <p>"Am I to understand, then," cried Amabel, a fearful suspicion of the truth
  breaking upon her, "that you never sincerely repented your former
  actions?"</p>

  <p>"You are to understand it," replied Rochester.</p>

  <p>"And you deceived me when you affirmed the contrary?"</p>

  <p>"I deceived you," he replied.</p>

  <p>"I begin to suspect," she cried, with a look of horror and doubt, "that
  the attack of the plague was feigned."</p>

  <p>"You are not far wide of the truth," was the reply.</p>

  <p>"And our marriage?" she cried&mdash;"our marriage? Was that feigned
  likewise?"</p>

  <p>"It was," replied Rochester, calmly.</p>

  <p>Amabel looked at him fixedly for a few minutes, as if she could not credit
  his assertion, and then receiving no contradiction, uttered a wild scream,
  and rushed out of the room. Rochester followed, and saw her dart with
  lightning swiftness across the court-yard. On gaining the street, he
  perceived her flying figure already at some distance; and greatly alarmed,
  started in pursuit. The unfortunate girl was not allowed to proceed far. Two
  persons who were approaching, and who proved to be Etherege and Pillichody,
  caught hold of her, and detained her till Rochester came up. When the latter
  attempted to touch her, she uttered such fearful shrieks, that Etherege
  entreated him to desist. With some difficulty she was taken back to the
  house. But it was evident that the shock had unsettled her reason. She
  alternately uttered wild, piercing screams, or broke into hysterical
  laughter. The earl's presence so much increased her frenzy, that he gladly
  withdrew.</p>

  <p>"This is a melancholy business, my lord," observed Etherege, as they
  quitted the room together, "and I am sorry for my share in it. We have both
  much to answer for."</p>

  <p>"Do you think her life in danger?" rejoined Rochester.</p>

  <p>"It would be well if it were so," returned the other; "but I fear she will
  live to be a perpetual memento to you of the crime you have committed."</p>

  <p>Amabel's delirium produced a high fever, which continued for three days.
  Her screams were at times so dreadful, that her betrayer shut himself up in
  the furthest part of the house, that he might not hear them. When at last she
  sank into a sleep like that of death, produced by powerful opiates, he stole
  into the room, and gazed at her with feelings which those who watched his
  countenance did not envy. It was hoped by the chirurgeon in attendance, that
  when the violence of the fever abated, Amabel's reason would be restored. But
  it was not so. Her faculties were completely shaken, and the cause of her
  affliction being effaced from her memory, she now spoke of the Earl of
  Rochester with her former affection.</p>

  <p>Her betrayer once ventured into her presence, but he did not repeat the
  visit. Her looks and her tenderness were more than even <i>his</i> firmness
  could bear, and he hurried away to hide his emotion from the attendants.
  Several days passed on, and as no improvement took place, the earl, who began
  to find the stings of conscience too sharp for further endurance, resolved to
  try to deaden the pangs by again plunging into the dissipation of the court.
  Prudence had been seized by the plague, and removed to the pest-house, and
  not knowing to whom to entrust Amabel, it at last occurred to him that Judith
  Malmayns would be a fitting person, and he accordingly sent for her from
  Saint Paul's, and communicated his wishes to her, offering her a considerable
  reward for the service. Judith readily undertook the office, and the earl
  delayed his departure for two days, to see how all went on; and finding the
  arrangements, to all appearances, answer perfectly, he departed with Etherege
  and Pillichody.</p>

  <p>Ever since the communication of the fatal truth had been made to her by
  the earl, his unfortunate victim had occupied the large oak-panelled chamber,
  on entering which so sad a presentiment had seized her; and she had never
  quitted the bed where she thought she would breathe her last. On the night of
  Rochester's departure she made many inquiries concerning him from Judith
  Malmayns, who was seated in an old broad-cushioned, velvet-covered chair,
  beside her, and was told that the king required his attendance at Oxford, but
  that he would soon return. At this answer the tears gathered thickly in
  Amabel's dark eyelashes, and she remained silent. By-and-by she resumed the
  conversation.</p>

  <p>"Do you know, nurse," she said, with a look of extreme anxiety, "I have
  forgotten my prayers. Repeat them to me, and I will say them after you."</p>

  <p>"My memory is as bad as your ladyship's," replied Judith, contemptuously.
  "It is so long since I said mine, that I have quite forgotten them."</p>

  <p>"That is wrong in you," returned Amabel, "very wrong. When I lived with my
  dear father, we had prayers morning and evening, and I was never so happy as
  then. I feel it would do me good if I could pray as I used to do."</p>

  <p>"Well, well, all in good time," replied Judith. "As soon as you are
  better, you shall go back to your father, and then you can do as you
  please."</p>

  <p>"No, no, I cannot go back to him," returned Amabel. "I am the Earl of
  Rochester's wife&mdash;his wedded wife. Am I not Countess of Rochester?"</p>

  <p>"To be sure you are," replied Judith&mdash;"to be sure."</p>

  <p>"I sometimes think otherwise," rejoined Amabel, mournfully.</p>

  <p>"And so my dear lord is gone to Oxford?"</p>

  <p>"He is," returned Judith, "but he will be back soon. And now," she added,
  with some impatience, "you have talked quite long enough. You must take your
  composing draught, and go to sleep."</p>

  <p>With this she arose, and stepping to the table which stood by the side of
  the bed, filled a wine-glass with the contents of a silver flagon, and gave
  it to her. Amabel drank the mixture, and complaining of its nauseous taste,
  Judith handed her a plate of fruit from the table to remove it. Soon after
  this she dropped asleep, when the nurse arose, and taking a light from the
  table, cautiously possessed herself of a bunch of keys which were placed in a
  small pocket over Amabel's head, and proceeded to unlock a large chest that
  stood near the foot of the bed. She found it filled with valuables&mdash;with
  chains of gold, necklaces of precious stones, loops of pearl, diamond
  crosses, and other ornaments. Besides these, there were shawls and stuffs of
  the richest description. While contemplating these treasures, and considering
  how she should carry them off without alarming the household, she was
  startled by a profound sigh; and looking towards the bed, perceived to her
  great alarm, that Amabel had opened her eyes, and was watching her.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing there, nurse?" she cried.</p>

  <p>"Only looking at these pretty things, your ladyship," replied Judith, in
  an embarrassed tone.</p>

  <p>"I hope you are not going to steal them?" said Amabel.</p>

  <p>"Steal them?" echoed Judith, alarmed. "Oh, no! What should make your
  ladyship think so?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said Amabel; "but put them by, and bring the keys to
  me."</p>

    <p class="caption">Judith Malmayns meditating the murder of Amabel</p>
</div>

  <p>Judith feigned compliance, but long before she had restored the things to
  the chest, Amabel had again fallen asleep. Apprised by her tranquil breathing
  of this circumstance, Judith arose; and shading the candle with her hand,
  crept noiselessly towards the bed. Dark thoughts crossed her as she gazed at
  the unfortunate sleeper; and moving with the utmost caution, she set the
  light on the table behind the curtains, and had just grasped the pillow, with
  the intention of plucking it from under Amabel's head, and of smothering her
  with it, when she felt herself restrained by a powerful grasp, and turning in
  utmost alarm, beheld the Earl of Rochester.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch4-6"
     name="ch4-6">VI. &mdash; THE CERTIFICATE.</a></h2>

  <p>"Wretch!" cried the earl. "An instinctive dread that you would do your
  poor charge some injury brought me back, and I thank Heaven I have arrived in
  time to prevent your atrocious purpose."</p>

  <p>"Your lordship would have acted more discreetly in staying away," replied
  Judith, recovering her resolution; "and I would recommend you not to meddle
  in the matter, but to leave it to me. No suspicion shall alight on you, nor
  shall it even be known that her end was hastened. Leave the house as secretly
  as you came, and proceed on your journey with a light heart. She will never
  trouble you further."</p>

  <p>"What!" exclaimed Rochester, who was struck dumb for the moment by
  surprise and indignation, "do you imagine I would listen to such a proposal?
  Do you think I would sanction her murder?"</p>

  <p>"I am sure you would, if you knew as much as I do," replied Judith,
  calmly. "Hear me, my lord," she continued, drawing him to a little distance
  from the bed, and speaking in a deep low tone. "You cannot marry Mistress
  Mallet while this girl lives."</p>

  <p>Rochester looked sternly and inquiringly at her. "You think your marriage
  was feigned," pursued Judith; "that he was no priest who performed the
  ceremony; and that no other witnesses were present except Sir George Etherege
  and Pillichody. But you are mistaken. I and Chowles were present; and he who
  officiated <i>was</i> a priest. The marriage was a lawful one; and yon
  sleeping girl, who, but for your ill-timed interference, would, ere this,
  have breathed her last, is to all intents and purposes Countess of
  Rochester."</p>

  <p>"A lie!" cried the earl, furiously.</p>

  <p>"I will soon prove it to be truth," rejoined Judith. "Your retainer and
  unscrupulous agent, Major Pillichody, applied to Chowles to find some one to
  personate a clergyman in a mock marriage, which your lordship wished to have
  performed, and promised a handsome reward for the service. Chowles mentioned
  the subject to me, and we speedily contrived a plan to outwit your lordship,
  and turn the affair to our advantage."</p>

  <p>The earl uttered an ejaculation of rage.</p>

  <p>"Being acquainted with one of the minor canons of Saint Paul's, a worthy
  and pious young man, named Vincent," pursued Judith, utterly unmoved by
  Rochester's anger, "who resided hard by the cathedral, we hastened to him,
  and acquainted him with the design, representing ourselves as anxious to
  serve the poor girl, and defeat your lordship's wicked design&mdash;for such
  we termed it. With a little persuasion, Mr. Vincent consented to the scheme.
  Pillichody was easily duped by Chowles's statement, and the ceremony was
  fully performed."</p>

  <p>"The whole story is a fabrication," cried the earl, with affected
  incredulity.</p>

  <p>"I have a certificate of the marriage," replied Judith, "signed by Mr.
  Vincent, and attested by Chowles and myself. If ever woman was wedded to man,
  Amabel is wedded to your lordship."</p>

  <p>"If this is the case, why seek to destroy her?" demanded the earl. "Her
  life must be of more consequence to you than her removal."</p>

  <p>"I will deal frankly with you," replied Judith. "She discovered me in the
  act of emptying that chest, and an irresistible impulse prompted me to make
  away with her. But your lordship is in the right. Her life <i>is</i>valuable
  to me, and she <i>shall</i> live. But, I repeat, you cannot marry the rich
  heiress, Mistress Mallet."</p>

  <p>"Temptress!" cried the earl, "you put frightful thoughts into my
  head."</p>

  <p>"Go your ways," replied Judith, "and think no more about her. All shall be
  done that you require. I claim as my reward the contents of that chest."</p>

  <p>"Your reward shall be the gallows," rejoined the earl, indignantly. "I
  reject your proposal at once. Begone, wretch! or I shall forget you are a
  woman, and sacrifice you to my fury. Begone!"</p>

  <p>"As your lordship pleases," she replied; "but first, the Countess of
  Rochester shall be made acquainted with her rights." So saying, she broke
  from him, and rushed to the bed.</p>

  <p>"What are you about to do?" he cried.</p>

  <p>"Waken her," rejoined Judith, slightly shaking the sleeper.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" exclaimed Amabel, opening her eyes, and gazing at her with a
  terrified and bewildered look.</p>

  <p>"His lordship is returned," said Judith.</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" exclaimed Amabel, raising herself in the bed. "Where is
  he?&mdash;Ah, I see him.&mdash;Come to me, my dear lord," she added,
  stretching out her arms to him, "Come to me."</p>

  <p>But evil thoughts kept Rochester motionless. "Oh! come to me, my lord,"
  cried Amabel, in a troubled tone, "or I shall begin to think what I have
  dreamed is true, and that I am not wedded to you."</p>

  <p>"It <i>was</i> merely a dream, your ladyship," observed Judith. "I will
  bear witness you are wedded to his lordship, for I was present at the
  ceremony."</p>

  <p>"I did not see you," remarked Amabel.</p>

  <p>"I was there, nevertheless," replied Judith.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to hear it," replied Amabel.</p>

  <p>"Your ladyship would rejoice if you knew all," returned Judith,
  significantly.</p>

  <p>"Why so?" inquired the other, curiously.</p>

  <p>"Because the clergyman who married you is dead of the plague," was the
  answer; "and it may chance in these terrible times that the two gentlemen who
  were present at the ceremony may die of the same distemper, and then there
  will be no one left but me and another person to prove that your marriage was
  lawful."</p>

  <p>"But its lawfulness will never be questioned, my dear lord, will it?"
  asked Amabel, looking beseechingly at Rochester.</p>

  <p>"Never," replied Judith, producing a small piece of parchment, "while I
  hold this certificate."</p>

  <p>"Give me that document," said the earl, in an undertone, to her.</p>

  <p>Judith directed her eyes towards the chest. "It is yours," said the earl,
  in the same tone as before.</p>

  <p>"What are you whispering, my lord?" inquired Amabel, uneasily.</p>

  <p>"I am merely telling her to remove that chest, sweetheart," he
  replied.</p>

  <p>"Do not send it away," cried Amabel. "It contains all the ornaments and
  trinkets you have given me. Do you know," she added in a whisper, "I caught
  her looking into it just now, and I suspect she was about to steal
  something."</p>

  <p>"Pshaw!" cried the earl, "she acted by my directions. Take the chest
  away," he added to Judith.</p>

  <p>"Has your lordship no further orders?" she rejoined, significantly.</p>

  <p>"None whatever," he replied, with a frown.</p>

  <p>"Before you go, give me the certificate," cried Amabel. "I must have
  it."</p>

  <p>Judith pretended not to hear her. "Give it her," whispered the earl, "I
  will remove it when she falls asleep."</p>

  <p>Nodding acquiescence, Judith took the parchment from her bosom, and
  returned with it to the bed. While this was passing, the earl walked towards
  the chest, and cast his eye over such of its contents as were scattered upon
  the floor. Judith watched him carefully, and when his back was turned, drew a
  small lancet, and affecting to arrange her dress, slightly punctured Amabel's
  neck. The pain was trifling, but the poor girl uttered a cry.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter?" cried the earl, turning suddenly round.</p>

  <p>"Nothing&mdash;nothing," replied Judith; "a pin in my sleeve pricked her
  as I was fastening her cap, that was all. Her death is certain," she added to
  herself, "she is inoculated with the plague-venom."</p>

  <p>She then went to the chest, and replacing everything within it, removed
  it, by the help of the Earl of Rochester, into the adjoining room. "I will
  send for it at midnight," she said.</p>

  <p>"It shall be delivered to your messenger," rejoined the earl; "but you
  will answer for Chowles's secrecy?"</p>

  <p>"I will," returned Judith, with a meaning smile. "But you may take my word
  for it you will not be troubled long with your wife. If I have any judgment
  respecting the plague, she is already infected."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" cried Rochester&mdash;"then&mdash;" but he checked himself, and
  added, "I do not believe it. Begone."</p>

  <p>"He <i>does</i> believe it for all that," muttered Judith, as he slunk
  away.</p>

  <p>Rochester returned to Amabel, and sat by her until she fell asleep, when
  he took the parchment from beneath the pillow where she had placed it.
  Examining it, he found it, as Judith had stated, a certificate of his
  marriage, signed by Mark Vincent, the clergyman who had officiated, and duly
  attested. Having carefully perused it, he held it towards the taper, with the
  intention of destroying it. As he was about to perpetrate this unworthy
  action, he looked towards the bed. The soft sweet smile that played upon the
  sleeper's features, turned him from his purpose. Placing the parchment in his
  doublet, he left the room, and summoning a female attendant, alleged some
  reason for his unexpected return, and ordered her to watch by the bedside of
  her mistress. Giving some further directions, he threw himself upon a couch
  and sought a few hours' repose. At daybreak, he repaired to Amabel's chamber,
  and finding her wrapped in a peaceful slumber, he commended her to the
  attendant, and departed.</p>

  <p>On awaking, Amabel complained of an uneasy sensation on her neck, and the
  attendant examining the spot, found, to her great alarm, a small red pustule.
  Without making a single observation, she left the room, and despatched a
  messenger after the Earl of Rochester to acquaint him that the countess was
  attacked by the plague. Such was the terror inspired by this dread disorder,
  that the moment it was known that Amabel was attacked by it, the whole
  household, except an old woman, fled. This old woman, whose name was Batley,
  and who acted as the earl's housekeeper, took upon herself the office of
  nurse. Before evening, the poor sufferer, who had endured great agony during
  the whole of the day, became so much worse, that Mrs. Batley ran out in
  search of assistance. She met with a watchman, who told her that a famous
  apothecary, from Clerkenwell, named Sibbald, who was celebrated for the cures
  he had effected, had just entered a neighbouring house, and offered to await
  his coming forth, and send him to her. Thanking him, Mrs. Batley returned to
  the house, and presently afterwards, Sibbald made his appearance. His looks
  and person had become even more repulsive than formerly. He desired to be led
  to the patient, and on seeing her, shook his head. He examined the pustule,
  which had greatly increased in size, and turning away, muttered, "I can do
  nothing for her."</p>

  <p>"At least make the attempt," implored Mrs. Batley. "She is the Countess of
  Rochester. You shall be well rewarded&mdash;and if you cure her, the earl
  will make your fortune."</p>

  <p>"If his lordship would change stations with me, I could not cure her,"
  replied Sibbald. "Let me look at her again," he added, examining the pustule.
  "There is a strange appearance about this tumour. Has Judith Malmayns
  attended her?"</p>

  <p>"She was here yesterday," replied Mrs. Batley.</p>

  <p>"I thought so," he muttered. "I repeat it is all over with her." And he
  turned to depart.</p>

  <p>"Do not leave her thus, in pity do not!" cried the old woman, detaining
  him. "Make some effort to save her. My lord loves her to distraction, and
  will abundantly reward you."</p>

  <p>"All I can do is to give her something to allay the pain," returned
  Sibbald. And drawing a small phial from his doublet, he poured its contents
  into a glass, and administered it to the patient.</p>

  <p>"That will throw her into a slumber," he said, "and when she wakes, she
  will be without pain. But her end will be not far off."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Batley took a purse from a drawer in one of the cabinets, and gave it
  to the apothecary, who bowed and retired. As he had foretold, Amabel fell
  into a heavy lethargy, which continued during the whole of the night. Mrs.
  Batley, who had never left her, noticed that an extraordinary and fearful
  change had taken place in her countenance, and she could not doubt that the
  apothecary's prediction would be realized. The tumour had increased in size,
  and was surrounded by a dusky brown circle, which she knew to be a bad sign.
  The sufferer's eyes, when she opened them, and gazed around, had a dim and
  glazed look. But she was perfectly calm and composed, and, as had been
  prognosticated, free from pain. She had, also, fully regained her faculties,
  and seemed quite aware of her dangerous situation.</p>

  <p>But the return of reason brought with it no solace. On the contrary, the
  earl's treachery rushed upon her recollection, and gave her infinitely more
  anguish than the bodily pain she had recently endured. She bedewed the pillow
  with her tears, and fervently prayed for forgiveness for her involuntary
  fault. Mrs. Batley was deeply moved by her affliction, and offered her every
  consolation in her power.</p>

  <p>"I would the plague had selected me for a victim instead of your
  ladyship," she said. "It is hard to leave the world at your age, possessed of
  beauty, honours, and wealth. At mine, it would not signify."</p>

  <p>"You mistake the cause of my grief," returned Amabel; "I do not lament
  that my hour is at hand, but&mdash;" and her emotion so overpowered her that
  she could not proceed.</p>

  <p>"Do not disturb yourself further, dear lady," rejoined the old woman. "Let
  the worst happen, I am sure you are well prepared to meet your Maker."</p>

  <p>"I once was," replied Amabel in a voice of despair, "but now&mdash;Oh,
  Heaven forgive me!"</p>

  <p>"Shall I fetch some holy minister to pray beside you, my lady?" said Mrs.
  Batley; "one to whom you can pour forth the sorrows of your heart?"</p>

  <p>"Do so! oh, do!" cried Amabel, "and do not call me lady. I am not worthy
  to be placed in the same rank as yourself."</p>

  <p>"Her wits are clean gone," muttered Mrs. Batley, looking at her
  compassionately.</p>

  <p>"Heed me not," cried Amabel; "but if you have any pity for the
  unfortunate, do as you have promised."</p>

  <p>"I will&mdash;I will," said Mrs. Batley, departing.</p>

  <p>Half an hour, which scarcely seemed a moment to the poor sufferer, who was
  employed in fervent prayer, elapsed before Mrs. Batley returned. She was
  accompanied by a tall man, whom Amabel recognised as Solomon Eagle.</p>

  <p>"I have not been able to find a clergyman," said the old woman, "but I
  have brought a devout man who is willing to pray with you."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" exclaimed the enthusiast, starting as he beheld Amabel. "Can it be
  Mr. Bloundel's daughter?"</p>

  <p>"It is," returned Amabel with a groan. "Leave us, my good woman," she
  added to Mrs. Batley, "I have something to impart to Solomon Eagle which is
  for his ear alone." The old woman instantly retired, and Amabel briefly
  related her hapless story to the enthusiast.</p>

  <p>"May I hope for forgiveness?" she inquired, as she concluded.</p>

  <p>"Assuredly," replied Solomon Eagle, "assuredly! You have not erred
  wilfully, but through ignorance, and therefore have committed no offence.
  <i>You</i> will be forgiven&mdash;but woe to your deceiver, here and
  hereafter."</p>

  <p>"Oh' say not so," she cried. "May Heaven pardon him as I do. While I have
  strength left I will pray for him." And she poured forth her supplications
  for the earl in terms so earnest and pathetic, that the tears flowed down
  Solomon Eagle's rough cheek. At this juncture, hasty steps were heard in the
  adjoining passage, and the door opening, admitted the Earl of Rochester, who
  rushed towards the bed.</p>

  <p>"Back!" cried Solomon Eagle, pushing him forcibly aside. "Back!"</p>

  <p>"What do you here?" cried Rochester, fiercely.</p>

  <p>"I am watching over the death-bed of your victim," returned Solomon Eagle.
  "Retire, my lord. You disturb her."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no," returned Amabel, meekly. "Let him come near me." And as Solomon
  Eagle drew a little aside, and allowed the earl to approach, she added, "With
  my latest breath I forgive you, my lord, for the wrong you have done me, and
  bless you."</p>

  <p>The earl tried to speak, but his voice was suffocated by emotion. As soon
  as he could find words, he said, "Your goodness completely overpowers me,
  dearest Amabel. Heaven is my witness, that even now I would make you all the
  reparation in my power were it needful. But it is not so. The wrong I
  intended you was never committed. I myself was deceived. I intended a feigned
  marriage, but it was rightfully performed. Time will not allow me to enter
  into further particulars of the unhappy transaction, but you may credit my
  assertion when I tell you you are indeed my wife, and Countess of
  Rochester."</p>

  <p>"If I thought so, I should die happy," replied Amabel.</p>

  <p>"Behold this proof!" said Rochester, producing the certificate.</p>

  <p>"I cannot read it," replied Amabel. "But you could not have the heart to
  deceive me now."</p>

  <p>"I will read it, and you well know <i>I</i> would not deceive you," cried
  Solomon Eagle, casting his eye over it&mdash;"His lordship has avouched the
  truth," he continued. "It is a certificate of your marriage with him, duly
  signed and attested."</p>

  <p>"God be thanked," ejaculated Amabel, fervently. "God be thanked! You have
  been spared that guilt, and I shall die content."</p>

  <p>"I trust your life will long be spared," rejoined the earl. Amabel shook
  her head.</p>

  <p>"There is but one man in this city who could save her," whispered Solomon
  Eagle, and I doubt even his power to do so.'</p>

  <p>"Who do you mean?" cried Rochester, eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Doctor Hodges," replied the enthusiast.</p>

  <p>"I know him well," cried the earl. "I will fly to him instantly. Remain
  with her till I return."</p>

  <p>"My lord&mdash;my dear lord," interposed Amabel, faintly, "you trouble
  yourself needlessly. I am past all human aid."</p>

  <p>"Do not despair," replied the earl. "Many years of happiness are, I trust,
  in store for us. Do not detain me. I go to save you. Farewell for a short
  time."</p>

  <p>"Farewell, for ever, my lord," she said, gently pressing his hand. "We
  shall not meet again. Your name will be coupled with my latest breath."</p>

  <p>"I shall be completely unmanned if I stay here a moment longer," cried the
  earl, breaking from her, and rushing out of the room.</p>

  <p>As soon as he was gone, Amabel addressed herself once more to prayer with
  Solomon Eagle, and in this way an hour passed by. The earl not returning at
  the end of that time, Solomon Eagle became extremely uneasy, every moment
  being of the utmost consequence, and summoning Mrs. Batley, committed the
  patient to her care, and set off in search of Hodges. He hastened to the
  doctor's house&mdash;he was absent&mdash;to Saint Paul's&mdash;he was not
  there, but he learnt that a person answering to the earl's description had
  been making similar inquiries after him.</p>

  <p>At last, one of the chirurgeon's assistants told him that he thought the
  doctor was gone towards Cornhill, and hoping, accidentally, to meet with him,
  the enthusiast set off in that direction. While passing near the Exchange, he
  encountered Leonard, as before related, but did not think fit to acquaint him
  with more than Amabel's dangerous situation; and he had reason to regret
  making the communication at all, on finding its effect upon the poor youth.
  There was, however, no help for it, and placing him in what appeared a
  situation of safety, he left him.</p>

  <p>Rochester, meanwhile, had been equally unsuccessful in his search for
  Hodges. Hurrying first in one direction and then in another, at the
  suggestion of the chirurgeon's assistant, he at last repaired to the doctor's
  residence, determined to await his return. In half an hour he came, and
  received the earl, as the old porter stated to Thirlby and Leonard, with
  angry astonishment. As soon as they were alone, the earl told him all that
  had occurred, and besought him to accompany him to the poor sufferer.</p>

  <p>"I will go to her," said Hodges, who had listened to the recital with
  mixed feelings of sorrow and indignation, "on one condition&mdash;and one
  only&mdash;namely, that your lordship does not see her again without my
  permission."</p>

  <p>"Why do you impose this restriction upon, me sir?' demanded Rochester.</p>

  <p>"I do not think it necessary to give my reasons, my lord," returned
  Hodges; "but I will only go upon such terms."</p>

  <p>"Then I must perforce submit," replied the earl; "but I entreat you to set
  forth-without a moment's delay, or you will be too late."</p>

  <p>"I will follow you instantly," rejoined Hodges. "Your lordship can wait
  for me at the Southwark side of the bridge." He then opened the door,
  reiterating the terms upon which alone he would attend, and the earl
  departed.</p>

  <p>Shortly afterwards he set out, and making the best of his way, found
  Rochester at the appointed place. The latter conducted him to the entrance of
  the habitation, and indicating a spot where he would remain till his return,
  left him. Hodges soon found his way to the chamber of the sufferer, and at
  once perceived that all human aid was vain. She exhibited much pleasure at
  seeing him, and looked round, as if in search of the earl. Guessing her
  meaning, the physician, who now began to regret the interdiction he had
  placed upon him, told her that he was the cause of his absence.</p>

  <p>"It is well," she murmured&mdash;"well." She then made some inquiries
  after her relatives, and receiving a satisfactory answer, said, "I am glad
  you are come. You will be able to tell my father how I died."</p>

  <p>"It will be a great comfort to him to learn the tranquil frame in which I
  have found you," replied Hodges.</p>

  <p>"How long have I to live?" asked Amabel, somewhat quickly. "Do not deceive
  me."</p>

  <p>"You had better make your preparations without delay," returned
  Hodges.</p>

  <p>"I understand," she replied; and joining her hands upon her breast, she
  began to murmur a prayer.</p>

  <p>Hodges, who up to this moment had had some difficulty in repressing his
  emotion, withdrew to a short distance to hide his fast-falling tears. He was
  roused shortly after, by a sudden and startling cry from the old woman.</p>

  <p>"Oh, sir, she is going! she is going!" ejaculated Mrs. Batley. He found
  the exclamation true. The eyes of the dying girl were closed. There was a
  slight quiver of the lips, as if she murmured some name&mdash;probably
  Rochester's&mdash;and then all was over.</p>

  <p>Hodges gazed at her sorrowfully for some time. He then roused himself, and
  giving some necessary directions to the old woman respecting the body,
  quitted the house. Not finding the earl at the place he had appointed to meet
  him, after waiting for a short time, he proceeded, towards his own house. On
  the way he was net by Thirlby and Parravicin, as previously related, and
  conducted to the house in Nicholas-lane. It will not be necessary to
  recapitulate what subsequently occurred. We shall, therefore, proceed to the
  point of time when he quitted his new patient, and entered the room where
  Thirlby and Leonard were waiting for him. Both, as has been stated, rushed
  towards him, and the former eagerly asked his opinion respecting his
  daughter.</p>

  <p>"My opinion is positive," replied Hodges. "With care, she will undoubtedly
  recover."</p>

  <p>"Heaven be thanked!" cried Thirlby, dropping on his knees.</p>

  <p>"And now, one word to me, sir," cried Leonard. "What of Amabel?"</p>

  <p>"Alas!" exclaimed the doctor, "her troubles are ended."</p>

  <p>"Dead!" shrieked Leonard.</p>

  <p>"Ay, dead!" repeated the doctor. "She died of the plague to-night."</p>

  <p>He then proceeded to detail briefly all that had occurred. Leonard
  listened like one stupefied, till he brought his recital to a close, and then
  asking where the house in which she had died was situated, rushed out of the
  room, and made his way, he knew not how, into the street. His brain seemed on
  fire, and he ran so quickly that his feet appeared scarcely to touch the
  ground. A few seconds brought him to London Bridge. He crossed it, and
  turning down the street on the left, had nearly reached the house to which he
  had been directed, when his career was suddenly checked. The gate of the
  court-yard was opened, and two men, evidently, from their apparel, buriers of
  the dead, issued from it. They carried a long narrow board between them, with
  a body wrapped in a white sheet placed upon it. A freezing horror rooted
  Leonard to the spot where he stood. He could neither move nor utter a
  cry.</p>

  <p>The men proceeded with their burden towards the adjoining habitation,
  which was marked with a fatal red cross and inscription. Before it stood the
  dead-cart, partly filled with corpses. The foremost burier carried a lantern,
  but he held it so low that its light did not fall upon his burden. Leonard,
  however, did not require to see the body to know whose it was. The moon was
  at its full, and shed a ghastly light over the group, and a large bat wheeled
  in narrow circles round the dead-cart.</p>

  <p>On reaching the door of the house, the burier set down the lantern near
  the body of a young man which had just been thrust forth. At the same moment,
  Chowles, with a lantern in his hand, stepped out upon the threshold. "Who
  have you got, Jonas?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I know not," replied the hindmost burier. "We entered yon large house,
  the door of which stood open, and in one of the rooms found, an old woman in
  a fainting state, and the body of this young girl, wrapped in a sheet, and
  ready for the cart. So we clapped it on the board, and brought it away with
  us."</p>

  <p>"You did right," replied Chowles. "I wonder whose body it is."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he held up his lantern, and unfastening it, threw the light
  full upon the face. The features were pale as marble; calm in their
  expression, and like those of one wrapped in placid slumber. The long fair
  hair hung over the side of the board. It was a sad and touching sight.</p>

  <p>"Why, as I am a living man, it is the grocer's daughter,
  Amabel,&mdash;somewhile Countess of Rochester!" exclaimed Chowles.</p>

  <p>"It is, it is!" cried the earl, suddenly rushing from behind a building
  where he had hitherto remained concealed. "Whither are you about to take her?
  Set her down&mdash;set her down."</p>

  <p>"Hinder them not, my lord," vociferated another person, also appearing on
  the scene with equal suddenness. "Place her in the cart," cried Solomon
  Eagle&mdash;for he it was&mdash;to the bearers. "This is a just punishment
  upon you, my lord," he added to Rochester, as his injunctions were
  obeyed&mdash;"oppose them not in their duty."</p>

  <p>It was not in the earl's power to do so. Like Leonard, he was transfixed
  with horror. The other bodies were soon placed in the cart, and it was put in
  motion. At this juncture, the apprentice's suspended faculties were for an
  instant&mdash;and an instant only&mdash;restored to him. He uttered a
  piercing cry, and staggering forward, fell senseless on the ground.</p>

  <h2><a id="bk5"
     name="bk5">BOOK THE FIFTH &mdash; DECEMBER, 1665.</a></h2>

  <h2>I. &mdash; THE DECLINE OF THE PLAGUE.</h2>

  <p>More than two months must be passed over in silence. During that time, the
  pestilence had so greatly abated as no longer to occasion alarm to those who
  had escaped its ravages. It has been mentioned that the distemper arrived at
  its height about the 10th of September, and though for the two following
  weeks the decline was scarcely perceptible, yet it had already commenced. On
  the last week in that fatal month, when all hope had been abandoned, the
  bills of mortality suddenly decreased in number to one thousand eight hundred
  and thirty-four. And this fortunate change could not be attributed to the
  want of materials to act upon, for the sick continued as numerous as before,
  while the deaths were less frequent. In the next week there was a further
  decrease of six hundred; in the next after that of six hundred; and so on
  till the end of October, when, the cold weather setting in, the amount was
  reduced to nearly one thousand.</p>

  <p>At first, when the distemper began to lose somewhat of its malignancy, a
  few scared individuals appeared in the streets, but carefully shunned each
  other. In a few days, however, considerable numbers joined them, and for the
  first time for nearly three months there was something like life abroad. It
  is astonishing how soon hope and confidence are revived. Now that it could no
  longer be doubted that the plague was on the decline, it seemed as if a
  miracle had been performed in favour of the city. Houses were
  opened&mdash;shopkeepers resumed their business&mdash;and it was a marvel to
  every one that so many persons were left alive. Dejection and despair of the
  darkest kind were succeeded by frenzied delight, and no bound was put to the
  public satisfaction. Strangers stopped each other in the streets, and
  conversed together like old friends. The bells, that had grown hoarse with
  tolling funerals, were now cracked with joyous peals. The general joy
  extended even to the sick, and many, buoyed up by hope, recovered, when in
  the former season of despondency they would inevitably have perished. All
  fear of the plague seemed to vanish with the flying disorder. Those who were
  scarcely out of danger joined in the throng, and it was no uncommon sight to
  see men with bandages round their necks, or supported by staves and crutches,
  shaking hands with their friends, and even embracing them.</p>

  <p>The consequence of this incautious conduct may be easily foreseen. The
  plague had received too severe a check to burst forth anew; but it spread
  further than it otherwise would have done, and attacked many persons, who but
  for their own imprudence would have escaped. Amongst others, a barber in
  Saint Martin's-le-Grand, who had fled into the country in August, returned to
  his shop in the middle of October, and, catching the disorder from one of his
  customers, perished with the whole of his family.</p>

  <p>But these, and several other equally fatal instances, produced no effect
  on the multitude. Fully persuaded that the virulence of the disorder was
  exhausted&mdash;as, indeed, appeared to be the case&mdash;they gave free
  scope to their satisfaction, which was greater than was ever experienced by
  the inhabitants of a besieged city reduced by famine to the last strait of
  despair, and suddenly restored to freedom and plenty. The more pious part of
  the community thronged to the churches, from which they had been so long
  absent, and returned thanks for their unexpected deliverance. Others, who had
  been terrified into seriousness and devotion, speedily forgot their former
  terrors, and resumed their old habits. Profaneness and debauchery again
  prevailed, and the taverns were as well filled as the churches. Solomon Eagle
  continued his midnight courses through the streets; but he could no longer
  find an audience as before. Those who listened to him only laughed at his
  denunciations of a new judgment, and told him his preachings and prophesyings
  were now completely out of date.</p>

  <p>By this time numbers of those who had quitted London having returned to
  it, the streets began to resume their wonted appearance. The utmost care was
  taken by the authorities to cleanse and purify the houses, in order to remove
  all chance of keeping alive the infection. Every room in every habitation
  where a person had died of the plague&mdash;and there were few that had
  escaped the visitation&mdash;was ordered to be whitewashed, and the strongest
  fumigations were employed to remove the pestilential effluvia. Brimstone,
  resin, and pitch were burnt in the houses of the poor; benjamin, myrrh, and
  other more expensive perfumes in those of the rich; while vast quantities of
  powder were consumed in creating blasts to carry off the foul air. Large and
  constant fires were kept in all the houses, and several were burnt down in
  consequence of the negligence of their owners.</p>

  <p>All goods, clothes, and bedding, capable of harbouring infection, were
  condemned to be publicly burned, and vast bonfires were lighted in Finsbury
  Fields and elsewhere, into which many hundred cart-loads of such articles
  were thrown. The whole of Chowles's hoard, except the plate, which he
  managed, with Judith's aid, to carry off and conceal in certain hiding-places
  in the vaults of Saint Faith's, was taken from the house in Nicholas-lane,
  and cast into the fire.</p>

  <p>The cathedral was one of the first places ordered to be purified. The
  pallets of the sick were removed and burned, and all the stains and
  impurities with which its floor and columns were polluted were cleansed.
  Nothing was left untried to free it from infection. It was washed throughout
  with vinegar, fumigated with the strongest scents, and several large barrels
  of pitch were set fire to in the aisles."</p>

  <p>"It shall undergo another species of purification," said Solomon Eagle,
  who was present during these proceedings; "one that shall search every nook
  within it&mdash;shall embrace all those columns, and pierce every crack and
  crevice in those sculptured ornaments; and then, and not till then, will it
  be thoroughly cleansed."</p>

  <p>During all this time the grocer had not opened his dwelling. The wisdom of
  this plan was now made fully apparent. The plague was declining fast, and not
  an inmate of his house had been attacked by it. Soon after the melancholy
  occurrence, he had been informed by Doctor Hodges of Amabel's death; but the
  humane physician concealed from him the painful circumstances under which it
  occurred. It required all Mr. Bloundel's fortitude to support him under the
  shock of this intelligence, and he did not communicate the afflicting tidings
  to his wife until he had prepared her for their reception. But she bore them
  better than he had anticipated; and though she mourned her daughter deeply
  and truly, she appeared completely resigned to the loss. Sorrow pervaded the
  whole household for some weeks; and the grocer, who never relaxed his system,
  shrouded his sufferings under the appearance of additional austerity of
  manner. It would have been a great consolation to him to see Leonard Holt;
  but the apprentice had disappeared; and even Doctor Hodges could give no
  account of him.</p>

  <p>One night, in the middle of November, Mr. Bloundel signified to his wife
  his intention of going forth, early on the following morning, to satisfy
  himself that the plague was really abating. Accordingly, after he had
  finished his devotions, and broken his fast, he put his design into
  execution. His first act, after locking the door behind him, which he did as
  a measure of precaution, was to fall on his knees and offer up prayers to
  Heaven for his signal preservation. He then arose, and, stepping into the
  middle of the street, gazed at the habitation which had formed his prison and
  refuge for nearly six months. There it was, with its shutters closed and
  barred&mdash;a secure asylum, with all alive within it, while every other
  dwelling in the street was desolate.</p>

  <p>The grocer's sensations were novel and extraordinary. His first impulse
  was to enjoy his newly-recovered freedom, and to put himself into active
  motion. But he checked the feeling as sinful, and proceeded along the street
  at a slow pace. He did not meet a single person, until he reached Cheapside,
  where he found matters completely changed. Several shops were already opened,
  and there were a few carts and other vehicles tracking their way through the
  broad and yet grass-grown street. It was a clear, frosty morning, and there
  was a healthful feel in the bracing atmosphere that produced an exhilarating
  effect on the spirits. The grocer pursued his course through the middle of
  the street, carefully avoiding all contact with such persons as he
  encountered, though he cordially returned their greetings, and wandered on,
  scarcely knowing whither he was going, but deeply interested in all he
  beheld.</p>

  <p>The aspect of the city was indeed most curious. The houses were for the
  most part unoccupied&mdash;the streets overgrown with grass&mdash;while every
  object, animate and inanimate, bore some marks of the recent visitation.
  Still, all looked hopeful, and the grocer could not doubt that the worst was
  past. The different demeanour of the various individuals he met struck him.
  Now he passed a young man whistling cheerily, who saluted him, and said, "I
  have lost my sweetheart by the plague, but I shall soon get another." The
  next was a grave man, who muttered, "I have lost all," and walked pensively
  on. Then came others in different moods; but all concurred in thinking that
  the plague was at an end; and the grocer derived additional confirmation of
  the fact from meeting numerous carts and other vehicles bringing families
  back to their houses from the country.</p>

  <p>After roaming about for several hours, and pondering on all he saw, he
  found himself before the great western entrance of Saint Paul's. It chanced
  to be the morning on which the pallets and bedding were brought forth, and he
  watched the proceeding at a distance. All had been removed, and he was about
  to depart, when he perceived a person seated on a block of stone, not far
  from him, whom he instantly recognised. "Leonard," he cried&mdash;"Leonard
  Holt, is it you?"</p>

  <p>Thus addressed, and in these familiar tones, the apprentice looked up, and
  Mr. Bloundel started at the change that had taken place in him. Profound
  grief was written in every line of his thin and haggard countenance; his eyes
  were hollow, and had the most melancholy expression imaginable; and his flesh
  was wasted away from the bone. He looked the very image of hopeless
  affliction.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to find you in this state, Leonard," said the grocer, in a
  tone of deep commiseration; "but I am well aware of the cause. I myself have
  suffered severely; but I deem it my duty to control my affliction."</p>

  <p>"I <i>would</i> control it, if it were possible, Mr. Bloundel," replied
  Leonard. "But hope is dead in my breast. I shall never be happy again."</p>

  <p>"I trust otherwise," replied the grocer, kindly. "Your trials have been
  very great, and so were those of the poor creature we both of us deplore. But
  she is at peace, and therefore we need not lament her."</p>

  <p>"Alas!" exclaimed Leonard, mournfully, "I am now only anxious to rejoin
  her."</p>

  <p>"It is selfish, if not sinful, to grieve in this way," rejoined Mr.
  Bloundel, somewhat sternly. "You must bear your sorrows like a man. Come home
  with me. I will be a father to you. Nay, do not hesitate. I will have no
  refusal."</p>

  <p>So saying, he took Leonard's arm, and led him in the direction of
  Wood-street. Nothing passed between them on the way, nor did Leonard evince
  any further emotion until he entered the door of the grocer's dwelling, when
  he uttered a deep groan. Mrs. Bloundel was greatly affected at seeing him, as
  were the rest of the family, and abundance of tears were shed by all, except
  Mr. Bloundel, who maintained his customary stoical demeanour throughout the
  meeting.</p>

  <p>Satisfied that the pestilence had not declined sufficiently to warrant him
  in opening his house, the grocer determined to await the result of a few
  weeks. Indeed, that very night, he had reason to think he had defeated his
  plans by precipitancy. While sitting after prayers with his family, he was
  seized with a sudden shivering and sickness, which he could not doubt were
  the precursors of the plague. He was greatly alarmed, but did not lose his
  command over himself.</p>

  <p>"I have been most imprudent," he said, "in thus exposing myself to
  infection. I have symptoms of the plague about me, and will instantly repair
  to one of the upper rooms which I have laid aside as an hospital, in case of
  any emergency like the present. None of you must attend me. Leonard will
  fetch Doctor Hodges and a nurse. I shall then do very well. Farewell, dear
  wife and children! God bless you all, and watch over you. Remember me in your
  prayers." So saying, he arose and walked towards the door. His wife and
  eldest son would have assisted him, but he motioned them away.</p>

  <p>"Let me go with you, sir," cried Leonard, who had arisen with the others;
  "I will nurse you; my life is of little consequence, and I cannot be more
  satisfactorily employed."</p>

  <p>The grocer reluctantly assented, and the apprentice assisted him upstairs,
  and helped to place him in bed. No plague-token could be found about his
  person, but as the same alarming symptoms still continued, Leonard
  administered such remedies as he thought needful, and then went in search of
  Doctor Hodges.</p>

  <p>On reaching Watling-street, he found Doctor Hodges about to retire to
  rest. The worthy physician was greatly distressed by the apprentice's account
  of his master's illness; but was somewhat reassured when the symptoms were
  more minutely described to him. While preparing certain medicines, and arming
  himself with his surgical implements, he questioned Leonard as to the cause
  of his long disappearance. "Having seen nothing of you," he said, "since the
  fatal night when our poor Amabel's sorrows were ended, I began to feel very
  apprehensive on your account. Where have you been?"</p>

  <p>"You shall hear," replied Leonard, "though the relation will be like
  opening my wounds afresh. On recovering from the terrible shock I had
  received, I found myself stretched upon a bed in a house whither I had been
  conveyed by Rainbird the watchman, who had discovered me lying in a state of
  insensibility in the street. For nearly a week I continued delirious, and
  should, probably, have lost my senses altogether but for the attentions of
  the watchman. As soon as I was able to move, I wandered to the lesser
  plague-pit, in Finsbury Fields, you will guess with what intent. My heart
  seemed breaking, and I thought I should pour forth my very soul in grief, as
  I gazed into that dreadful gulf, and thought she was there interred. Still my
  tears were a relief. Every evening, for a month, I went to that sad spot, and
  remained there till daybreak admonished me to return to Rainbird's dwelling.
  At last, he was seized by the distemper; but though I nursed him, voluntarily
  exposing myself to infection, and praying to be carried off, I remained
  untouched. Poor Rainbird died; and having seen his body thrown into the pit,
  I set off into Berkshire, and after three days' toilsome travel on foot,
  reached Ashdown Park. It was a melancholy pleasure to behold the abode where
  she I had loved passed her last few days of happiness, and where I had been
  near her. Her aunt, good Mrs. Buscot, though overwhelmed by affliction at the
  sad tidings I brought her, received me with the utmost kindness, and tried to
  console me. My sorrow, however, was too deeply seated to be removed.
  Wandering over the downs, I visited Mrs. Compton at Kingston Lisle, from
  whose house Amabel was carried off by the perfidious earl. She, also,
  received me with kindness, and strove, like Mrs. Buscot, to comfort me, and,
  like her, ineffectually. Finding my strength declining, and persuaded that my
  days were drawing to a close, I retraced my steps to London, hoping to find a
  final resting-place near her I had loved."</p>

  <p>"You are, indeed, faithful to the grave, Leonard," said the physician,
  brushing away a tear; "and I never heard or read of affection stronger than
  yours. Sorrow is a great purifier, and you will come out all the better for
  your trial. You are yet young, and though you never can love as you
  <i>have</i> loved, a second time, your heart is not utterly seared."</p>

  <p>"Utterly, sir," echoed Leonard, "utterly."</p>

  <p>"You think so, now," rejoined the physician. "But you will find it
  otherwise hereafter. I can tell you of one person who has suffered almost as
  much from your absence as you have done for the loss of Amabel. The Lady
  Isabella Argentine has made constant inquiries after you; and though I should
  be the last person to try to rouse you from your present state of
  despondency, by awakening hopes of alliance with the sister of a proud noble,
  yet it may afford you consolation to know that she still cherishes the
  warmest regard for you."</p>

  <p>"I am grateful to her," replied Leonard, sadly, but without exhibiting any
  other emotion. "She was dear to Amabel, and therefore will be ever dear to
  me. I would fain know," he added, his brow suddenly contracting, and his lip
  quivering, "what has become of the Earl of Rochester?"</p>

  <p>"He has married a wealthy heiress, the fair Mistress Mallet," replied
  Hodges.</p>

  <p>"Married, and so soon!" cried Leonard. "And he has quite forgotten his
  victim?"</p>

  <p>"Apparently so," replied the doctor, with an expression of disgust.</p>

  <p>"And it was for one who so lightly regarded her that she sacrificed
  herself," groaned Leonard, his head dropping upon his breast.</p>

  <p>"Come," cried Hodges, taking his arm, and leading him out of the room; "we
  must go and look after your master."</p>

  <p>With this, they made the best of their way to Wood-street. Arrived at the
  grocer's house, they went upstairs, and Hodges immediately pronounced Mr.
  Bloundel to be suffering from a slight feverish attack, which a sudorific
  powder would remove. Having administered the remedy, he descended to the
  lower room to allay the fears of the family. Mrs. Bloundel received the happy
  tidings with tears of joy, and the doctor remained a short time to condole
  with her on the loss she had sustained. The good dame wept bitterly on
  hearing the whole particulars, with which she had been hitherto unacquainted,
  attending her daughter's untimely death, but she soon regained her composure.
  They then spoke of Leonard, who had remained above with his master,&mdash;of
  his blighted hopes, and seemingly incurable affliction.</p>

  <p>"His is true love, indeed, doctor," sighed Mrs. Bloundel. "Pity it is that
  it could not be requited."</p>

  <p>"I know not how it is," rejoined Hodges, "and will not question the
  decrees of our All-Wise Ruler, but the strongest affection seldom, if ever,
  meets a return. Leonard himself was insensible to the devotion of one, of
  whom I may say, without disparagement to our poor Amabel, that she was, in my
  opinion, her superior in beauty."</p>

  <p>"And does this person love him still?" inquired Mrs. Bloundel, eagerly. "I
  ask, because I regard him as a son, and earnestly desire to restore him to
  happiness."</p>

  <p>"Alas!" exclaimed Hodges, "there are obstacles in the way that cannot be
  removed. We must endeavour to cure him of his grief in some other way."</p>

  <p>The conversation then dropped, and Hodges took his leave, promising to
  return on the morrow, and assuring Mrs. Bloundel that she need be under no
  further apprehension about her husband. And so it proved. The powders removed
  all the grocer's feverish symptoms, and when Doctor Hodges made his
  appearance the next day, he found him dressed, and ready to go downstairs.
  Having received the physician's congratulations on his entire recovery, Mr.
  Bloundel inquired from him when he thought he might with entire safety open
  his shop. Hodges considered for a moment, and then replied, "I do not see any
  great risk in doing so now, but I would advise you to defer the step for a
  fortnight. I would, also, recommend you to take the whole of your family for
  a short time into the country. Pure air and change of scene are absolutely
  necessary after their long confinement."</p>

  <p>"Farmer Wingfield, of Kensal-Green, who sheltered us on our way down to
  Ashdown Park, will, I am sure, receive you," observed Leonard.</p>

  <p>"If so, you cannot go to a better place," rejoined the physician.</p>

  <p>"I will think of it," returned Mr. Bloundel. And leading the way
  downstairs, he was welcomed by his wife and children with the warmest
  demonstrations of delight.</p>

  <p>"My fears, you perceive, were groundless," he remarked to Mrs.
  Bloundel.</p>

  <p>"Heaven be praised, they were so!" she rejoined. "But I entreat you not to
  go forth again till all danger is at an end."</p>

  <p>"Rest assured I will not," he answered. Soon after this, Doctor Hodges
  took his leave, and had already reached the street-door, when he was arrested
  by Patience, who inquired with much anxiety whether he knew anything of
  Blaize.</p>

  <p>"Make yourself easy about him, child," replied the doctor; "I am pretty
  sure he is safe and sound. He has had the plague, certainly; but he left the
  hospital at Saint Paul's cured.</p>

  <p>"O then I <i>shall</i> see him again," cried Patience, joyfully. "Poor
  dear little fellow, it would break my heart to lose him."</p>

  <p>"I will make inquiries about him," rejoined Hodges, "and if I can find
  him, will send him home." And without waiting to receive the kitchen-maid's
  thanks, he departed.</p>

  <p>For some days the grocer continued to pursue pretty nearly the same line
  of conduct that he had adopted during the height of the pestilence. But he
  did not neglect to make preparations for resuming his business; and here
  Leonard was of material assistance to him. They often spoke of Amabel, and
  Mr. Bloundel strove, by every argument he was master of, to remove the weight
  of affliction under which his apprentice laboured. He so far succeeded that
  Leonard's health improved, though he still seemed a prey to secret sorrow.
  Things were in this state, when one day a knock was heard at the street-door,
  and the summons being answered by the grocer's eldest son, Stephen, he
  returned with the intelligence that a person was without who desired to see
  Patience. After some consideration, Mr. Bloundel summoned the kitchen-maid,
  and told her she might admit the stranger into the passage, and hear what he
  had to say. Patience hastened with a beating heart to the door, expecting to
  learn some tidings of Blaize, and opening it, admitted a man wrapped in a
  large cloak and having a broad-leaved hat pulled over his brows. Stepping
  into the passage, he threw aside the cloak and raised the hat, discovering
  the figure and features of Pillichody.</p>

  <p>"What brings you here, sir?" demanded Patience, in alarm, and glancing
  over her shoulder to see whether any one observed them. "What do you
  want?"</p>

  <p>"I have brought you news of Blaize," returned the bully. "But how
  charmingly you look. By the coral lips of Venus! your long confinement has
  added to your attractions."</p>

  <p>"Never mind my attractions, sir," rejoined Patience, impatiently. "Where
  is Blaize? Why did he not come with you?"</p>

  <p>"Alas!" replied Pillichody, shaking his head in a melancholy manner, "he
  could not."</p>

  <p>"Could not!" half screamed Patience. "Why not?"</p>

  <p>"Do not question me," replied Pillichody, feigning to brush away a tear.
  "He was my friend, and I would rather banish him from my memory. The sight of
  your beauty transports me so, that, by the treasures of Croesus! I would
  rather have you without a crown than the wealthiest widow in the
  country."</p>

  <p>"Don't talk nonsense to me in this way," sobbed Patience "I'm not in the
  humour for it."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense!" echoed Pillichody. "I swear to you I am in earnest. By Cupid!
  I am ravished with your charms." And he would have seized her hand, but
  Patience hastily withdrew it; and, provoked at his impertinence, dealt him a
  sound box on the ear. As she did this, she thought she heard a suppressed
  laugh near her, and looked round, but could see no one. The sound certainly
  did not proceed from Pillichody, for he looked very red and very angry.</p>

  <p>"Do not repeat this affront, mistress," he said to her. "I can bear
  anything but a blow from your sex."</p>

  <p>"Then tell me what has become of Blaize," she cried.</p>

  <p>"I will no longer spare your feelings," he rejoined. "He is defunct."</p>

  <p>"Defunct!" echoed Patience, with a scream. "Oh, dear me!&mdash;I shall
  never survive it&mdash;I shall die."</p>

  <p>"Not while I am left to supply his place," cried Pillichody, catching her
  in his arms.</p>

  <p>"You!" cried Patience, contemptuously; "I would not have you for the
  world. Where is he buried?"</p>

  <p>"In the plague-pit," replied Pillichody. "I attended him during his
  illness. It was his second attack of the disorder. He spoke of you."</p>

  <p>"Did he?&mdash;dear little fellow!" she exclaimed. "Oh, what did he
  say?"</p>

  <p>"'Tell her,' he cried," rejoined Pillichody, "'that my last thoughts were
  of her.'"</p>

  <p>"Oh, dear! oh, dear!" cried Patience, hysterically.</p>

  <p>"'Tell her also,' he added," pursued Pillichody, "'that I trust she will
  fulfil my last injunction.'"</p>

  <p>"That I will," replied Patience. "Name it."</p>

  <p>"He conjured you to marry me," replied Pillichody. "I am sure you will not
  hesitate to comply with the request."</p>

  <p>"I don't believe a word of this," cried Patience. "Blaize was a great deal
  too jealous to bequeath me to another."</p>

  <p>"Right, sweetheart, right," cried the individual in question, pushing open
  the door. "This has all been done to try your fidelity. I am now fully
  satisfied with your attachment; and am ready to marry you whenever you
  please."</p>

  <p>"So this was all a trick," cried Patience, pettishly; "I wish I had known
  it, I would have retaliated upon you nicely. You ought to be ashamed of
  yourself, Major Pillichody, to lend a helping-hand in such a ridiculous
  affair."</p>

  <p>"I did it to oblige my friend Blaize," replied Pillichody. "It was agreed
  between us that if you showed any inconstancy, you were to be mine."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" exclaimed Patience. "I would not advise you to repeat the
  experiment, Mr. Blaize."</p>

  <p>"I never intend to do so, my angel," replied the porter. "I esteem myself
  the happiest and most fortunate of men."</p>

  <p>"You have great reason to do so," observed Pillichody. "I do not despair
  of supplanting him yet," he muttered to himself. "And now, farewell!" he
  added aloud; "I am only in the way, and besides, I have no particular desire
  to encounter Mr. Bloundel or his apprentice;" and winking his solitary orb
  significantly at Patience, he strutted away. It was well he took that
  opportunity of departing, for the lovers' raptures were instantly afterwards
  interrupted by the appearance of Mr. Bloundel, who was greatly delighted to
  see the porter, and gave him a hearty welcome.</p>

  <p>"Ah, sir, I have had a narrow escape," cried Blaize, "and never more
  expected to see you, or my mother, or Patience. I <i>have</i> had the plague,
  sir, and a terrible disorder it is."</p>

  <p>"I heard or your seizure from Leonard Holt," replied Mr. Bloundel. "But
  where have you been since you left the hospital at Saint Paul's?"</p>

  <p>"In the country, sir," rejoined Blaize; "sometimes at one farm-house, and
  sometimes at another. I only returned to London yesterday, and met an old
  friend, whom I begged to go before me, and see that all was right before I
  ventured, in."</p>

  <p>"We have all been providentially spared," observed Mr. Bloundel, "and you
  will find your mother as well as when you last quitted her. You had better go
  to her."</p>

  <p>Blaize obeyed, and was received by old Josyna with a scream of delight.
  Having embraced him, and sobbed over him, she ran for a bottle of sack, and
  poured its contents down his throat so hastily as nearly to choke him. She
  then spread abundance of eatables before him, and after he had eaten and
  drank his full, offered him as a treat a little of the plague medicine which
  she had in reserve.</p>

  <p>"No, thank you, mother," replied Blaize. "I have had enough of
  <i>that</i>. But if there should be a box of rufuses amongst the store, you
  can bring it, as I think a couple might do me good."</p>

  <p>Three days after this event, the apprentice was sent forth to ascertain
  the precise state of the city, as, if all proved favourable, the grocer
  proposed to open his house on the following day. Leonard set out betimes, and
  was speedily convinced that all danger was at an end. A severe frost had set
  in, and had completely purified the air. For the last few days there had been
  no deaths of the plague, and but little mortality of any kind. Leonard
  traversed several of the main streets, and some narrow thoroughfares, and
  found evidences of restored health and confidence everywhere. It is true
  there were many houses, in which whole families had been swept off, still
  left untenanted. But these were only memorials of the past calamity, and
  could not be referred to any existing danger. Before returning to
  Wood-street, an irresistible impulse led him to Finsbury Fields. He passed
  through the postern east of Cripplegate, and shaped his way towards the
  lesser plague-pit. The sun, which had been bright all the morning, was now
  partially obscured; the air had grown thick, and a little snow fell. The
  ground was blackened and bound by the hard frost, and the stiffened grass
  felt crisp beneath his feet. Insensible to all external circumstances, he
  hurried forward, taking the most direct course, and leaping every impediment
  in his path. Having crossed several fields, he at length stood before a
  swollen heap of clay, round which a wooden railing was placed. Springing over
  the enclosure, and uttering a wild cry that evinced the uncontrollable
  anguish of his breast, he flung himself upon the mound. He remained for some
  time in the deepest affliction, and was at last roused by. a hand laid upon
  his shoulder, and, raising himself, beheld Thirlby.</p>

  <p>"I thought it must be you," said the new comer, in accents of the deepest
  commiseration. "I have been visiting yonder plague-pit for the same
  melancholy purpose as yourself,&mdash;to mourn over my lost child. I have
  been in search of you, and have much to say to you. Will you meet me in this
  place at midnight tomorrow?" Leonard signified his assent.</p>

  <p>"I am in danger," pursued Thirlby, "for, by some means, the secret of my
  existence has been made known, and the officers of justice are in pursuit of
  me. I suspect that Judith Malmayns is my betrayer. You will not fail me?"</p>

  <p>"I will not," returned Leonard. Upon this, Thirlby hurried away, and
  leaping a hedge, disappeared from view.</p>

  <p>Leonard slowly and sorrowfully returned to Wood-street. On arriving there,
  he assured his master that he might with entire safety open his house, as he
  proposed, on the morrow; and Doctor Hodges, who visited the grocer the same
  evening, confirmed the opinion. Early, therefore, the next morning, Mr.
  Bloundel summoned his family to prayers; and after pouring forth his
  supplications with peculiar fervour and solemnity, he went, accompanied by
  them all, and threw open the street-door. Again, kneeling down at the
  threshold, he prayed fervently, as before. He then proceeded to remove the
  bars and shutters from the windows. The transition from gloom and darkness to
  bright daylight was almost overpowering. For the first time for six months,
  the imprisoned family looked forth on the external world, and were dazzled
  and bewildered by the sight. The grocer himself, despite his sober judgment,
  could scarcely believe he had not been in a trance during the whole period.
  The shop was scarcely opened before it was filled with customers, and Leonard
  and Stephen were instantly employed. But the grocer would sell nothing. To
  those who asked for any article he possessed, he presented them with it, but
  would receive no payment.</p>

  <p>He next dispatched Blaize to bring together all the poor he could find,
  and distributed among them the remainder of his store&mdash;his casks of
  flour, his salted meat, his cheeses, his biscuits, his wine&mdash;in short,
  all that was left.</p>

  <p>"This I give," he said, "as a thanksgiving to the Lord, and as a humble
  testimony of gratitude for my signal deliverance."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch5-2"
     name="ch5-2">II. &mdash; THE MIDNIGHT MEETING.</a></h2>

  <p>The first day of his deliverance being spent by the grocer in the
  praiseworthy manner before related, he laid his head upon his pillow with a
  feeling of satisfaction such as he had not for months experienced. A very
  remarkable dream occurred to him that night, and its recollection afterwards
  afforded him the greatest consolation. While thinking of Amabel, and of the
  delight her presence would have afforded him, slumber stole upon him, and his
  dreams were naturally influenced by his previous meditations. It appeared to
  him that he was alone within his house, and while visiting one of the upper
  rooms, which had formerly been appropriated to his lost daughter, he noticed
  a small door in the wall that had never before attracted his attention. He
  immediately pushed against it, and yielding to the touch, it admitted him to
  an apartment with which he seemed acquainted, though he could not recall the
  time when he had seen it. It was large and gloomy, panelled with dark and
  lustrous oak, and filled with rich but decayed furniture. At the further end
  stood a large antique bed, hung round with tarnished brocade curtains. The
  grocer shuddered at the sight, for he remembered to have heard Doctor Hodges
  assert, that in such a bed, and in such a room as this, his daughter had
  breathed her last. Some one appeared to be within the bed, and rushing
  forward with a throbbing heart, and a foreboding of what was to follow, he
  beheld the form of Amabel. Yes, there she was, with features like those she
  wore on earth, but clothed with such celestial beauty, and bearing the
  impress of such serene happiness, that the grocer felt awe-struck as he gazed
  at her!</p>

  <p>"Approach, my father," said the visionary form, in a voice so musical that
  it thrilled through his frame&mdash;"approach, and let what you now hear be
  for ever graven upon your heart. Do not lament me more, but rather rejoice
  that I am removed from trouble, and in the enjoyment of supreme felicity.
  Such a state you will yourself attain. You have run the good race, and will
  assuredly reap your reward. Comfort my dear mother, my brothers, my little
  sister, with the assurance of what I tell you, and bid them dry their tears.
  I can now read the secrets of all hearts, and know how true was Leonard
  Holt's love for me, and how deep and sincere is his present sorrow. But I am
  not permitted to appear to him as I now appear to you. Often have I heard him
  invoke me in accents of the wildest despair, and have floated past him on the
  midnight breeze, but could neither impart consolation to him nor make him
  sensible of my presence, because his grief was sinful. Bid him be comforted.
  Bid him put a due control upon his feelings. Bid him open his heart anew, and
  he shall yet be happy, yet love again, and have his love requited. Farewell,
  dear father!"</p>

  <p>And with these words the curtains of the bed closed. The grocer stretched
  out his arm to draw them aside, and in the effort awoke. He slept no more
  that night, but dwelt with unutterable delight on the words he had heard. On
  rising, his first object was to seek out Leonard, and to relate his vision to
  him. The apprentice listened in speechless wonder, and remained for some time
  lost in reflection.</p>

  <p>"From any other person than yourself, sir," he said, at length, "I might
  have doubted this singular story, but coming from you, I attach implicit
  credence to it. I <i>will</i> obey your sainted daughter's injunctions; I
  <i>will</i> struggle against the grief that overwhelms me, and will try to
  hope that her words may be fulfilled."</p>

  <p>"You will do wisely," rejoined Mr. Bloundel. "After breakfast we will walk
  together to the farmhouse you spoke of at Kensal Green, and if its owner
  should prove willing to receive my family for a few weeks, I will remove them
  thither at once."</p>

  <p>Leonard applauded his master's resolution, expressing his firm conviction
  that Farmer Wingfield would readily accede to the proposal, and the rest of
  the family having by this time assembled, they sat down to breakfast. As soon
  as the meal was over, Mr. Bloundel intrusted the care of the shop to Stephen
  and Blaize, and accompanied by Leonard, set forth. On the way to the west end
  of the town, the grocer met one or two of his old friends, and they welcomed
  each other like men risen from the grave. Their course took them through
  Saint Giles's, where the plague had raged with the greatest severity, and
  where many houses were still without tenants.</p>

  <p>"If all had acted as I have done," sighed the grocer, as he gazed at these
  desolate habitations, "how many lives, under God's providence, would have
  been saved!"</p>

  <p>"In my opinion, sir," replied Leonard, "you owe your preservation as much
  to your piety as to your prudence."</p>

  <p>"I have placed my trust on high," rejoined the grocer, "and have not been
  forsaken. And yet many evil doers have escaped; amongst others&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know whom you mean, sir," interrupted Leonard, with some fierceness,
  "but a day of retribution will arrive for him."</p>

  <p>"No more of this," rejoined the grocer, severely. "Remember the solemn
  injunction you have received."</p>

  <p>At this moment they observed a horseman, richly attired, and followed by a
  couple of attendants, riding rapidly towards them. Both instantly recognised
  him. The apprentice's cheek and brow flushed with anger, and Mr. Bloundel had
  much ado to control his emotion. It was the Earl of Rochester, and on seeing
  them he instantly dismounted, and flinging his bridle to one of the
  attendants, advanced towards them. Noticing the fury that gleamed in
  Leonard's eyes, and apprehending some violence on his part, the grocer laid
  his hand, upon his arm, and sternly enjoined him to calm himself.</p>

  <p>By this time, the earl had reached them. "Mr. Bloundel," he said, in a
  tone of much emotion, and with a look that seemed to bespeak contrition. "I
  heard that you had opened your house yesterday, and was about to call upon
  you. I have a few words to say to you on a subject painful to both of us, but
  doubly painful to me&mdash;your daughter."</p>

  <p>"I must decline to hear them, my lord," replied the grocer, coldly; "nor
  shall you ever cross my threshold again with my consent. My poor child is now
  at peace. You can do her no further injury, and must settle your own account
  with your Maker."</p>

  <p>"Do not refuse me your forgiveness," implored the earl. "I will make every
  reparation in my power."</p>

  <p>"You <i>can</i> make none," replied the grocer, repelling him; "and as to
  my forgiveness, I neither refuse it nor accord it. I pray your lordship to
  let me pass. The sole favour I ask of you is to come near me no more."</p>

  <p>"I obey you," replied the earl. "Stay," he added to Leonard, who stood by,
  regarding him with a look of deadly animosity. "I would give you a piece of
  caution. Your life is in danger."</p>

  <p>"I can easily guess from whom," replied the apprentice, scornfully.</p>

  <p>"You mistake," rejoined Rochester; "you have nothing to apprehend from me.
  You have promised to meet some one to-night," he added, in so low a tone as
  to be inaudible to the grocer. "Do not go."</p>

  <p>"Your lordship's warning will not deter me," rejoined the apprentice.</p>

  <p>"As you will," rejoined Rochester, turning away. And springing upon his
  horse, and striking his spurs into his side, he dashed off, while Leonard and
  the grocer took the opposite direction. In less than half an hour they
  reached the little village of Paddington, then consisting of a few houses,
  but now one of the most populous and important parishes of the metropolis,
  and speedily gained the open country. Even at this dreary season the country
  had charms, which Mr. Bloundel, after his long confinement, could fully
  appreciate. His eye roamed over the wide prospect; and the leafless trees,
  the bare hedges, and the frost-bound fields seemed pleasant in his sight.</p>

  <p>He quickened his pace, and being wholly indifferent to the cold, greatly
  enjoyed the exercise. Leonard pointed out to him the spots where the
  fugitives from the plague had pitched their tents, and also the pest-house
  near Westbourne Green, where he himself had been received during his second
  attack of the distemper, and which was now altogether abandoned.</p>

  <p>Soon after this, they mounted the hill beyond Kensal Green, and approached
  the farmhouse. Leonard descried Wingfield near one of the barns, and hailing
  him, he immediately came forward. On being informed of Mr. Bloundel's desire,
  he at once assented, and taking them into the house, mentioned the matter to
  his dame, who was quite of the same opinion as himself.</p>

  <p>"The only difference between us," he said to Mr. Bloundel, "is as to the
  payment you propose. Now I will take none&mdash;not a farthing. Come when you
  please, bring whom you please, and stay as long as you please. But don't
  offer me anything if you would not offend me. Recollect," he added, the
  moisture forcing itself into his eyes, and his strong clear voice becoming
  husky with emotion, "that I loved your daughter for her resemblance to my
  poor child. She, too, is gone. I do this for her sake."</p>

  <p>Mr. Bloundel shook the worthy man warmly by the hand, but he made no
  further objection, resolved in his own mind to find some other means of
  requiting his hospitality. It was then agreed that the grocer should bring
  his family on the following day, and remain there for a month; and every
  other arrangement being made, and a hearty meal partaken of, he cordially
  thanked his host, and returned with Leonard to Wood-street.</p>

  <p>In spite of his efforts to resist the impression produced by the earl's
  warning, Leonard could not banish it from his mind; and though he did not for
  a moment think of abandoning his purpose, he resolved to attend the meeting
  armed. He told Mr. Bloundel he should go out that night, but did not state
  his object, and the grocer did not inquire it. Blaize sat up with him, and
  displayed much anxiety to know whither he was going, but, as may be supposed,
  his curiosity was not gratified. As the clock struck eleven, Leonard thrust a
  sword into his girdle, and arming himself furthermore with his staff,
  proceeded towards the door, and bade Blaize lock it after him.</p>

  <p>"I shall probably be back in a couple of hours," he said, as he went
  forth. "You must sit up for me."</p>

  <p>"I wonder where he is going!" thought Blaize, "From his gloomy looks, and
  the weapon he has taken with him, I should judge he is about to murder some
  one&mdash;perhaps the Earl of Rochester. It must be prevented."</p>

  <p>With this view, though perhaps rather more influenced by curiosity than
  any better feeling, the porter waited a few seconds to allow the apprentice
  to get out of sight, and then locking the door outside, put the key in his
  pocket, and followed him. The night was profoundly dark, but he had noticed
  the direction taken by Leonard, and running noiselessly along the street,
  soon perceived him a little in advance. Regulating his pace by that of the
  apprentice, and keeping about fifty yards behind him, he tracked his course
  along several streets, until he saw him pass through the second postern in
  the city wall, near Moorgate.</p>

  <p>Here he debated with himself whether to proceed further or turn back; but
  at length, curiosity got the best of his fears, and he went on. A few steps
  brought him into the open fields, and fancying he saw Leonard at a little
  distance before him, he hurried on in that direction. But he soon found he
  had been deceived by the stump of a tree, and began to fear he must have
  taken the wrong course. He looked around in vain for some object to guide
  him. The darkness was so profound that he could see nothing, and he set off
  again at random, and not without much self-reproach and misgiving. At last,
  he reached a hedge, and continued to skirt it, until he perceived through the
  bushes the light of a lantern in the adjoining field. He immediately called
  out, but at the cry the light disappeared. This did not prevent him from
  making towards the spot where he had seen it; but he had not proceeded far
  when he was forcibly seized by some unseen person, thrown on the ground, and
  a drawn sword&mdash;for he felt the point&mdash;placed at his throat.</p>

  <p>"Utter a cry, and it is your last," cried a stern voice. "Where is
  he?"</p>

  <p>"Who&mdash;who?" demanded Blaize, half dead with terror.</p>

  <p>"He whom you appointed to meet," replied the unknown.</p>

  <p>"I appointed to meet no one," rejoined Blaize.</p>

  <p>"Liar!" exclaimed the other; "if you do not instantly lead me to him, I
  will cut your throat."</p>

  <p>"I will lead you wherever you please, if you will only let me get up,"
  rejoined Blaize, with difficulty repressing a cry.</p>

  <p>"By the daughters of Nox and Acheron!" exclaimed a voice which sounded
  like music in the porter's ears, "I think you are mistaken in your man, my
  lord. It does not sound like the apprentice's voice."</p>

  <p>"It is <i>not</i> the apprentice's voice, good Major Pillichody," rejoined
  the porter. "It is mine, your friend&mdash;Blaize's."</p>

  <p>"Blaize!" exclaimed Pillichody, unmasking a dark lantern, and revealing
  the terror-stricken countenance of the porter; "so it is. In the devil's
  name, what are you doing here?"</p>

  <p>"The devil himself, who put it into my head to come, only knows," replied
  Blaize; "but I followed Leonard Holt."</p>

  <p>"Which way did he take?" asked the person who had assailed him.</p>

  <p>"I cannot exactly say," replied Blaize, "but he seemed to go straight into
  the fields."</p>

  <p>"He is no doubt gone to the plague-pit," replied the other. "You are now
  at liberty," he added to Blaize, "and I counsel you to make the best of your
  way home. Say nothing to your master of what has occurred. The city walls lie
  in that direction."</p>

  <p>Overjoyed to be released, Blaize ran off as fast as his legs could carry
  him, and never stopped till he reached Moorgate. Meanwhile, Leonard had
  reached the place of meeting. As he stood by the rail surrounding the
  plague-pit, he thought of Mr. Bloundel's singular dream, and almost hoping to
  be similarly favoured, flung himself on his knees, and besought Amabel, if it
  were possible, to appear to him. But his entreaties produced no result. The
  chill blast whistled past him, and, mindful of what had been told him, he was
  fain to interpret this into an answer to his request. The night was bitterly
  cold, and Leonard, whose limbs were almost stiffened by long kneeling, walked
  round and round the enclosure at a quick pace to put his blood into
  circulation. As the hour of midnight was tolled forth by the neighbouring
  churches, he heard footsteps, and could just detect a figure advancing
  towards him.</p>

  <p>"Are you there?" was asked in the voice of Thirlby. Leonard replied in the
  affirmative, and the other instantly joined him.</p>

  <p>"Have you mentioned our meeting to any one?" inquired Leonard. "I ask,
  because I was warned by the Earl of Rochester not to attend it."</p>

  <p>"Strange!" exclaimed Thirlby, musingly. "However, do not let us waste
  time. I am about to leave London, perhaps this country&mdash;for ever. But I
  could not depart without an interview with you. You are aware of my strong
  attachment to my poor lost child. My daughter Isabella now supplies her place
  in my heart. She is the only being I love on earth, for my son has alienated
  himself from my affections. All I desire is to see her happy. This, I find,
  can only be accomplished in one way."</p>

  <p>Here he paused for a moment, but as Leonard made no remark, he proceeded.
  "Why should I hesitate to declare it," he said, "since it was for that object
  I brought you hither? She loves you&mdash;devotedly loves you&mdash;and if
  her wishes were opposed, I should tremble for the consequences. Now listen to
  me. Situated as you are, you never can wed her. I will, however, point out a
  means by which you can raise yourself to distinction in a short time, and so
  entitle yourself to claim her hand. I will supply you with money&mdash;more
  than you can require&mdash;will place you at court&mdash;near the king's
  person&mdash;and if you act under my direction, your rise is certain. I have
  extorted a promise to this effect from my own son. I told him my object, and
  that if he did not make your fortune, I could ruin him by revealing myself. I
  may, perhaps, pay the penalty of my crime on the scaffold; but I may also
  escape. In the latter case, my reappearance would be fatal to him. He has
  consented to cooperate with me, to watch over your fortunes, and, as soon as
  you have attained sufficient eminence, to bestow his sister upon you. Now do
  you understand?"</p>

  <p>"I do," replied Leonard; "and I understand also against whom the Earl of
  Rochester warned me."</p>

  <p>"And you consent," demanded Thirlby.</p>

  <p>Leonard, was about to answer, when he felt a light and trembling hand
  placed upon his own. "Do not answer inconsiderately, Leonard," said a low,
  sweet voice, which he recognised as that of the Lady Isabella; "I am here to
  receive your determination."</p>

  <p>"I am glad of it," replied the apprentice. "The deep devotion you have
  displayed towards me deserves to be requited. I will strive to render myself
  worthy of you, and I feel that by so doing I shall best fulfil the
  injunctions of her who lies beside us. Henceforth, Lady Isabella, I wholly
  devote myself to you."</p>

  <p>A murmur of delight escaped her. "My blessings on you both!" exclaimed her
  father. "Give me your hand, Isabella," he added, taking it and placing it in
  that of the apprentice. "Here, beside the grave of her whom you both loved, I
  affiance you. Pursue the course I point out to you, Leonard, and she will
  soon be yours."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, the light of a lantern was suddenly thrown upon them,
  disclosing two persons who had noiselessly approached. They were Lord
  Argentine and Pillichody. "You affirm more than you have warrant for, my
  lord," said the former. "I will never consent to this ill-assorted and
  dishonourable union; and, so far from permitting it, will oppose it to the
  utmost of my power. If this presumptuous apprentice dares to raise his views
  towards my sister, let him look to himself. Your safety lies in instant
  flight. The officers are in search of you."</p>

  <p>"They shall find me," replied Thirlby, sternly.</p>

  <p>"As you please," rejoined Argentine. "Come with me, Isabella," he added to
  his sister. But she flew with a cry towards Leonard.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" exclaimed her brother, drawing his sword. "Do you dare to detain,
  her? Deliver her to me, villain, instantly!"</p>

  <p>"Not when thus menaced, my lord," rejoined Leonard, likewise drawing his
  sword, and standing upon the defensive.</p>

  <p>"Then look to yourself," replied Argentine, assaulting him.</p>

  <p>Isabella uttered a wild shriek, and Thirlby tried to rush between them.
  But before they could be separated, Lord Argentine's fury had exposed him to
  his adversary, whose sword passed through his body. He fell to the ground,
  weltering in his blood. While Leonard stood stupefied and confounded at what
  had occurred, and Isabella, uttering a loud cry, threw herself upon the body
  and tried to stanch the wound&mdash;two men, with halberds in their hands
  rushed forward, and seizing Thirlby, cried, "We arrest you as a
  murderer!"</p>

  <p>Thirlby, who seemed utterly overcome by surprise and horror, offered no
  Resistance. At this juncture Leonard felt his arm seized by a
  bystander&mdash;he did not know whom&mdash;and scarcely conscious of what was
  taking place, suffered himself to be dragged from the scene.</p>

  <h2><a id="bk6"
     name="bk6">BOOK THE SIXTH &mdash; SEPTEMBER, 1666</a></h2>

  <h2>I. &mdash; THE FIRE-HALL</h2>

  <p>About nine o'clock on the night of Saturday, the second of September,
  1666&mdash;and rather more than nine months after the incidents last
  related,&mdash;three men took their way from Smithfield to Islington. They
  proceeded at a swift pace and in silence, until, having mounted the steep
  hill on which the suburb in question is situated, they halted at a short
  distance from the high walls surrounding the great water-works formed by the
  New-River-head. The night was dark, but free from cloud, in consequence of a
  strong easterly wind which prevailed at the time.</p>

  <p>"It is dark in London now," observed one of the three persons to his
  companions as he cast his eye in the direction of the great city, that lay
  buried in gloom beneath them; "but there will be light enough soon."</p>

  <p>"A second dawn, and brighter than the first, shall arise upon it," replied
  one of his companions, a tall, gaunt man, whose sole covering was a
  sheepskin, girded round his loins. "Such a flame shall be kindled within it,
  as hath not been seen since showers of brimstone and fire descended upon the
  sinful cities of the plain. 'The Lord shall come with flames of fire,'" he
  added, pointing his long staff towards the city. "'He shall make them like a
  fiery oven, in the time of his wrath. They shall be utterly consumed.'"</p>

  <p>"Amen!" exclaimed the third person, who stood near him, in a deep voice,
  and with something of a foreign accent.</p>

  <p>"Not so loud, friends," rejoined the first speaker. "Let us set about the
  task. I will ascertain that no one is on the watch."</p>

  <p>With this he moved towards the water-works, and skirting the circular
  walls, to satisfy himself that all was secure, he returned to his companions,
  and they proceeded to the principal entrance to the place. Noiselessly
  unlocking the gates, the leader of the party admitted the others into an open
  space of some extent, in the midst of which was a large reservoir of water.
  He then gave each of them a small key, and bidding them use despatch, they
  began to turn the cocks of the leaden pipes connected with the reservoir,
  while he hastened to the further end of the inclosure, and employed himself
  in a similar manner. In this way, and in less than a quarter of an hour, the
  whole of the cocks were stopped.</p>

  <p>"And now give me the keys," said the leader.</p>

  <p>Taking them as they were offered, he added his own to the number, and
  flung them as far as he could into the reservoir, laughing slightly as the
  noise of the splash occasioned by their fall into the water reached the
  ears.</p>

  <p>"They will not be found till this pool is drained," he observed to his
  companions. "And now let us go. Our business here is done."</p>

  <p>"Stay yet a moment," cried Solomon Eagle, who was standing at the brink of
  the reservoir, with his eyes fixed upon it. "Stay!" he cried, arresting him.
  "A vision rises before me. I see in this watery mirror a representation of
  the burning city. And what are those fearful forms that feed the flames?
  Fiends, in our likeness&mdash;fiends! And see how wide and far the
  conflagration spreads. The whole city is swallowed up by an earthquake. It
  sinks to the bottomless pit&mdash;down&mdash;down!"</p>

  <p>"No more of this," cried the leader, impatiently. "Come along." And,
  followed by the others, he rushed to the gates, and locking them after him,
  flung the key away.</p>

  <p>"A hundred pounds were paid to the servant of the chief officer of the
  works to bring those keys to me," he said, "and he executed his commission
  faithfully and well. Water will be vainly sought for to quench the
  conflagration."</p>

  <p>"I like not the vision I have just beheld," said Solomon Eagle, in a
  troubled tone. "It seems to portend mischief."</p>

  <p>"Think of it no more," rejoined the leader, "or regard it as it
  was&mdash;a phantom created by your overheated imagination. Yon city has
  sinned so deeply, that it is the will of Heaven it should be destroyed; and
  it has been put into our hearts by the Supreme Power to undertake the
  terrible task. We are the chosen instruments of the divine displeasure.
  Everything favours the design&mdash;the long-continued dry weather&mdash;the
  strong easterly wind, which will bear the flames into the heart of the
  city&mdash;the want of water, occasioned by the stopping of these pipes, the
  emptying of the various aqueducts, and the destruction of the Thames
  water-tower, which we have accomplished. Everything favours it, I say, and
  proves that the hand of Heaven directs us. Yes, London shall fall! We have
  received our commission from on high, and must execute it, regardless of the
  consequences. For my own part, I feel as little compunction to the task, as
  the thunderbolt launched from on high does for the tree it shivers."</p>

  <p>"Philip Grant has uttered my sentiments exactly," said the man who, it has
  been mentioned, spoke with a slight foreign accent. "I have neither misgiving
  nor compunction. You appear to have forgotten your own denunciations,
  brother."</p>

  <p>"Not so, Brother Hubert," rejoined the enthusiast, "and I now recognise in
  the vision a delusion of the Evil One to turn me from my holy purpose. But it
  has failed. The impious and impenitent city is doomed, and nothing can save
  it. And yet I would fain see it once more as I beheld it this morn when day
  arose upon it for the last time, from the summit of Saint Paul's. It looked
  so beautiful that my heart smote me, and tears started to my eyes, to think
  that those goodly habitations, those towers, temples, halls, and palaces,
  should so soon be levelled with the dust."</p>

  <p>"Hear what the prophet saith," rejoined Hubert. "'Thou hast defiled thy
  sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy
  traffic. Therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, and will
  bring thee to ashes upon the earth, in the sight of all those that behold
  thee.'"</p>

  <p>Solomon Eagle flung himself upon his knees, and his example was imitated
  by the others. Having recited a prayer in a low deep tone, he arose, and
  stretching out his arms, solemnly denounced the city. As he pronounced the
  words, a red and fiery star shot from the dark vault of the sky, and seemed
  to fall in the midst of the city.</p>

  <p>"Did you not see that sign?" cried Grant, eagerly. "It heralds us to our
  task."</p>

  <p>So saying, he ran swiftly down the hill, and, followed by the others, did
  not slacken his pace till they reached the city. They then shaped their
  course more slowly towards Saint Paul's, and having gained the precincts of
  the cathedral, Solomon Eagle, who now assumed the place of leader, conducted
  them to a small door on the left of the great northern entrance, and
  unlocking it, ushered them into a narrow passage behind the rich carved work
  of the choir. Traversing it, they crossed the mid aisle, and soon reached the
  steps leading to Saint Faith's. It was profoundly dark, but they were all
  well acquainted with the road, and did not miss their footing. It required,
  however, some caution to thread the ranks of the mighty pillars filling the
  subterranean church. But at last this was accomplished, and they entered the
  vault beyond the charnel, where they found Chowles and Judith Malmayns. The
  former was wrapped in a long black cloak, and was pacing to and fro within
  the narrow chamber. When Solomon Eagle appeared, he sprang towards him, and
  regarding him inquiringly, cried, "Have you done it?&mdash;have you done
  it?"</p>

  <p>The enthusiast replied in the affirmative. "Heaven be praised!" exclaimed
  Chowles. And he skipped about with the wildest expressions of delight. A
  gleam of satisfaction, too, darted from Judith's savage eyes. She had neither
  risen nor altered her position on the arrival of the party, but she now got
  up, and addressed the enthusiast. A small iron lamp, suspended by a chain
  from the vaulted roof, lighted the chamber. The most noticeable figure amidst
  the group was that of Solomon Eagle, who, with his blazing eyes, long
  jet-black locks, giant frame, and tawny skin, looked like a supernatural
  being. Near him stood the person designated as Robert Hubert. He was a young
  man, and appeared to have lived a life of great austerity. His features were
  thin; his large black eyes set in deep caverns; his limbs seemed almost
  destitute of flesh; and his looks wild and uncertain, like those of an insane
  person. His tattered and threadbare garb resembled that of a French
  ecclesiastic. The third person, who went by the name of Philip Grant, had a
  powerful frame, though somewhat bent, and a haughty deportment and look,
  greatly at variance with his miserable attire and haggard looks. His beard
  was long and grizzled, and his features, though sharpened by care, retained
  some traces of a noble expression. A few minutes having passed in
  conversation, Grant observed to the enthusiast, "I must now leave you for a
  short time. Give me the key that I may let myself out."</p>

  <p>"You are not going to betray us?" cried Chowles, suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"Why should I betray you?" rejoined Grant, sternly. "I am too anxious for
  the event to disclose it."</p>

  <p>"True, true," replied Chowles.</p>

  <p>"<i>I</i> do not mistrust you, brother," observed Solomon Eagle, giving
  him the key.</p>

  <p>"I know whither you are going," observed Judith Malmayns. "You are about
  to warn Mr. Bloundel and his partner&mdash;apprentice no longer&mdash;Leonard
  Holt, of the approaching conflagration. But your care will be thrown
  away."</p>

  <p>"Does she speak the truth, brother?" demanded Hubert, raising his eyes
  from the Bible which he was reading in the corner of the vault.</p>

  <p>"I will do nothing to endanger the design," rejoined Grant; "of that rest
  assured."</p>

  <p>With this, he strode forth, traversed Saint Faith's, and, notwithstanding
  the gloom, reached, without difficulty, the little door by which he had
  entered the cathedral. Issuing from it, he took the way, as Judith had
  surmised, to Wood-street, and pausing before the grocer's door, knocked
  against it. The summons was presently answered by Blaize; and to Grant's
  inquiries whether his master was within, he replied, "Which of my masters did
  you mean? I have two."</p>

  <p>"The younger," replied Grant, "Leonard Holt."</p>

  <p>"So far you are fortunate," rejoined Blaize. "Mr. Bloundel has retired to
  rest, but Mr. Holt is still downstairs. Pray what may be your business with
  him at this hour? It should be important."</p>

  <p>"It is important," rejoined Grant, "and does not admit of a moment's
  delay. Tell him so."</p>

  <p>Eyeing the stranger with a look of suspicion, the porter was about to
  enter into a parley with him, when Leonard himself cut it short, and learning
  the nature of the application, desired Grant to follow him into the adjoining
  room. The nine months which had passed over Leonard's head since he was last
  brought under notice, had wrought a material change in his appearance. He had
  a grave and thoughtful air, somewhat inclining to melancholy, but in other
  respects he was greatly improved. His health was completely restored, and the
  thoughtful expression added character to his handsome physiognomy, and
  harmonised well with his manly and determined bearing. He was habited
  plainly, but with some degree of taste. As Judith Malmayns had intimated, he
  was now Mr. Bloundel's partner, and his whole appearance denoted his improved
  circumstances. The alteration did not escape the notice of the stranger, who
  regarded him with much curiosity, and closed the door behind him as he
  entered the room.</p>

  <p>"You are looking much better than when we last met, Leonard Holt," he
  said, in tones that made his hearer start, "and I am glad to perceive it.
  Prosperity seems to attend your path, and you deserve it; whereas misery and
  every other ill&mdash;and I deserve them&mdash;dog mine."</p>

  <p>"I did not recognise you at first, Mr. Thirlby," replied Leonard; "for, in
  truth, you are much changed. But you desire to speak with me on a matter of
  importance. Can I aid you? You may need money. Here is my purse."</p>

  <p>"I do not want it," replied the other, scornfully rejecting the offer. "I
  have a proposal to make to you."</p>

  <p>"I shall be glad to hear it," replied Leonard. "But first tell me how you
  effected your escape after your arrest on that disastrous night when, in
  self-defence, and unintentionally, I wounded your son, Lord Argentine?"</p>

  <p>"Would you had killed him!" cried the other, fiercely. "I have lost all
  feelings of a father for him. He it was who contrived my arrest, and he would
  have gladly seen me borne to the scaffold, certain it would have freed him
  from me for ever. I was hurried away by the officers from the scene of
  strife, and conveyed to the Tun at Cornhill, which you know has been
  converted into a round-house, and where I was locked up for the night. But
  while I was lying on the floor of my prison, driven well-nigh frantic by what
  had occurred, there were two persons without labouring to effect my
  deliverance&mdash;nor did they labour in vain. These were Chowles and Judith,
  my foster-sister, and whom, you may remember, I suspected&mdash;and most
  unfairly&mdash;of intending my betrayal. By means of a heavy bribe, they
  prevailed on one of the officers to connive at my escape. An iron bar was
  removed from the window of my prison, and I got through the aperture. Judith
  concealed me for some days in the vaults of Saint Faith's, after which I fled
  into the country, where I wandered about for several months, under the name
  of Philip Grant. Having learnt that my son though severely hurt by you, had
  recovered from his wound, and that his sister, the Lady Isabella, had
  accompanied him to his seat in Staffordshire, I proceeded thither, and saw
  her, unknown to him. I found her heart still true to you. She told me you had
  disappeared immediately after the termination of the conflict, and had not
  been heard of till her brother was out of danger, when you returned to
  Wood-street."</p>

  <p>"The information was correct," replied Leonard. "I was dragged away by a
  person whom I did not recognise at the time, but who proved to be the Earl of
  Rochester. He conducted me to a place of safety, thrust a purse into my hand,
  and left me. As soon as I could do so with safety, I returned to my master's
  house. But how long have you been in London?"</p>

  <p>"Nearly a month," replied Grant. "And now let me ask you one question. Do
  you ever think of Isabella?"</p>

  <p>"Often, very often," replied Leonard. "But as I dare not indulge the hope
  of a union with her, I have striven to banish her image from my mind."</p>

  <p>"She cannot forget <i>you</i>, Leonard," rejoined Grant. "And now to my
  proposal. I have another plan for your aggrandisement that cannot fail. I am
  in possession of a monstrous design, the revelation of which will procure you
  whatever you desire. Ask a title from the king, and he will give it; and when
  in possession of that title, demand the hand of the Lady Isabella, and her
  proud brother will not refuse you. Call in your porter&mdash;seize me. I will
  offer a feigned resistance. Convey me before the king. Make your own terms
  with him. He will accede to them. Will you do it?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Leonard, "I will not purchase the daughter at the price of
  the father's life."</p>

  <p>"Heed me not," replied Grant, supplicatingly, "I am wholly indifferent to
  life. And what matters it whether I am dragged to the scaffold for one crime
  or another?"</p>

  <p>"You plead in vain," returned Leonard, firmly.</p>

  <p>"Reflect," cried Grant, in an agonised tone. "A word from you will not
  only win you Isabella, but save the city from destruction."</p>

  <p>"Save the city!" exclaimed Leonard. "What mean you?"</p>

  <p>"Swear to comply with my request, and you shall know. But not otherwise,"
  replied Grant.</p>

  <p>"I cannot&mdash;I cannot," rejoined Leonard; "and unfortunately you have
  said too much for your own safety. I must, though most reluctantly, detain
  you."</p>

  <p>"Hear me, Leonard, and consider well what you do," cried Grant, planting
  himself before the door. "I love you next to my daughter, and chiefly because
  she loves you. I have told you I have a design to discover, to which I am a
  party&mdash;a hellish, horrible design&mdash;which threatens this whole city
  with destruction. It is your duty, having told you thus much, to arrest me,
  and I will offer no resistance. Will you not turn this to your advantage?
  Will you not make a bargain with the king?"</p>

  <p>"I have said I will not," rejoined Leonard.</p>

  <p>"Then be warned by me," rejoined Grant. "Arouse your partner. Pack up all
  your goods and make preparations for instant flight, for the danger will
  invade you before you are aware of it."</p>

  <p>"Is it fire?" demanded Leonard, upon whose mind the denunciations of
  Solomon Eagle now rushed.</p>

  <p>"You will see," replied Grant, with a terrible laugh. "You will repent
  your determination when it is too late. Farewell."</p>

  <p>"Hold!" cried Leonard, advancing towards him, and trying to lay hands upon
  him, "I arrest you in the king's name."</p>

  <p>"Off!" exclaimed Grant, dashing him forcibly backwards. And striking down
  Blaize, who tried to stop him in the passage, he threw open the street-door,
  and disappeared. Fearful of pursuit, Grant took a circuitous route to Saint
  Paul's, and it was full half an hour after the interview above related before
  he reached the cathedral. Just as he passed through the small door, the clock
  tolled forth the hour of midnight, and when he gained the mid aisle, he heard
  footsteps approaching, and encountered his friends.</p>

  <p>"We had given you up," said Chowles, "and fearing you intended us some
  treachery, were about to do the job without you."</p>

  <p>"I have been unavoidably detained," replied Grant. "Let us about it at
  once."</p>

  <p>"I have got the fire-balls with me," observed Hubert.</p>

  <p>"It is well," returned Grant.</p>

  <p>Quitting the cathedral, they proceeded to Thames-street, and tracking it
  to Fish-street-hill, struck off on the right into an alley that brought them
  to Pudding-lane.</p>

  <p>"This is the house," said Chowles, halting before a two-storied wooden
  habitation, over the door of which was suspended the sign of the "Wheat
  Sheaf, with the name THOMAS FARRYNER, BAKER, inscribed beneath it.</p>

  <p>"And here," said Hubert, "shall begin the great fire of London."</p>

  <p>As he said this, he gave a fire-ball to Solomon Eagle, who lighted the
  fuze at Chowles's lantern. The enthusiast then approached a window of the
  baker's shop, and breaking a small pane of glass within it, threw the
  fire-ball into the room. It alighted upon a heap of chips and fagots lying
  near a large stack of wood used for the oven, and in a few minutes the whole
  pile had caught and burst into a flame, which, quickly mounting to the
  ceiling, set fire to the old, dry, half-decayed timber that composed it.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch6-2"
     name="ch6-2">II. &mdash; THE FIRST NIGHT OF THE FIRE.</a></h2>

  <p>Having seen the stack of wood kindled, and the flames attack the building
  in such a manner as to leave no doubt they would destroy it, the incendiaries
  separated, previously agreeing to meet together in half an hour at the foot
  of London Bridge; and while the others started off in different directions,
  Chowles and Judith retreated to a neighbouring alley commanding a view of the
  burning habitation.</p>

  <p>"At last the great design is executed," observed Chowles, rubbing his
  hands gleefully. "The fire burns right merrily, and will not soon be
  extinguished. Who would have thought we should have found such famous
  assistants as the two madmen, Solomon Eagle and Robert Hubert&mdash;and your
  scarcely less mad foster-brother, Philip Grant? I can understand the motives
  that influenced the two first to the deed, but not those of the other."</p>

  <p>"Nor I," replied Judith, "unless he wishes in some way or other to benefit
  Leonard Holt by it. For my part, I shall enjoy this fire quite as much on its
  own account as for the plunder it will bring us. I should like to see every
  house in this great city destroyed."</p>

  <p>"You are in a fair way of obtaining your wish," replied Chowles; "but
  provided I have the sacking of them, I don't care how many are saved. Not but
  that such a fire will be a grand sight, which I should be sorry to miss. You
  forget, too, that if Saint Paul's should be burnt down, we shall lose our
  hoards. However, there's no chance of that."</p>

  <p>"Not much," replied Judith, interrupting him. "But see! the baker has at
  last discovered that his dwelling is on fire. He bursts open the window, and,
  as I live, is about to throw himself out of it."</p>

  <p>As she spoke, one of the upper windows in the burning habitation was burst
  open, and a poor terrified wretch appeared at it in his night-dress,
  vociferating in tones of the wildest alarm, "Fire! fire!&mdash;help!
  help!"</p>

  <p>"Shall we go forward?" said Chowles. Judith hesitated for a moment, and
  then assenting, they hurried towards the spot.</p>

  <p>"Can we give you any help, friend?" cried Chowles.</p>

  <p>"Take care of this," rejoined the baker, flinging a bag of money to the
  ground, "and I will endeavour to let down my wife and children. The staircase
  is on fire, and we are almost stifled with smoke. God help us!" And the
  exclamation was followed by fearful shrieks from within, followed by the
  appearance of a woman, holding two little children in her arms, at the
  window.</p>

  <p>"This must be money," said Judith, utterly heedless of the fearful scene
  occurring above, and taking up the bag and chinking it; "silver, by the
  sound. Shall we make off with it?"</p>

  <p>"No, no," replied Chowles, "we must not run any risk for such a paltry
  booty. Let us bide our time."</p>

  <p>At this juncture, the baker, who had disappeared for a few seconds from
  the window, again presented himself at it, and, with some difficulty, forced
  a feather bed through it, which was instantly placed by Chowles in such a
  position beneath, as to break the fall of the descending parties. Tying a
  couple of sheets together, and fastening one end round his wife's waist, the
  baker lowered her and the children to the ground. They alighted in safety;
  but just as he was about to follow their example, the floor of the room gave
  way, and though he succeeded in springing through the window, he missed the
  feather bed, and broke his leg in the fall. He was picked up by Chowles and
  Judith, and placed upon the bed in a state of insensibility, and was soon
  afterwards conveyed with his family to the house of a neighbour.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the fire had spread to the houses on either side of the
  unfortunate man's habitation, and both of them being built entirely of wood,
  they were almost instantly in flames. The alarm too had become general; the
  inhabitants of the adjoining houses were filled with indescribable terror,
  and the narrow street was speedily crowded with persons of both sexes, who
  had rushed from their beds to ascertain the extent of the danger. All was
  terror and confusion. The fire-bells of Saint Margaret's, Saint George's, and
  Saint Andrew's, in Botolph-lane, began to toll, and shouts were heard on
  every side, proving that the whole neighbourhood was roused.</p>

  <p>To add to the general distress, a report was raised that a house in
  Fish-street-hill was on fire, and it was soon found to be true, as an immense
  volume of flames burst forth in that quarter. While the rest of the
  spectators, distracted by this calamity, and hardly knowing what to do,
  hurried in the direction of the new fire, Chowles and Judith eyed each other
  askance, and the former whispered to his companion, "This is another piece of
  Hubert's handiwork."</p>

  <p>The two wretches now thought it time to bestir themselves. So much
  confusion prevailed, that they were wholly unobserved, and under the plea of
  rendering assistance, they entered houses and carried off whatever excited
  their cupidity, or was sufficiently portable. No wealthy house had been
  attacked as yet, and therefore their spoil was but trifling. The poor baker
  seemed to be the bearer of ill-luck, for he had not been many minutes in his
  new asylum before it likewise caught fire. Another house, too, in
  Fish-street-hill, and lower down than the first, was observed to be burning,
  and as this was out of the current of the wind, and consequently could not
  have been occasioned by the showers of sparks that marked its course, a cry
  was instantly raised that incendiaries were abroad, and several
  suspicious-looking persons were seized in consequence.</p>

  <p>Meantime no efforts had been made to stop the progress of the original
  conflagration in Pudding-lane, which continued to rage with the greatest
  fury, spreading from house to house with astonishing rapidity. All the
  buildings in this neighbourhood being old, and of wood, which was as dry as
  tinder, a spark alighting upon them would have sufficed to set them on fire.
  It may be conceived, therefore, what must have been the effect of a vast
  volume of flame, fanned by a powerful wind. House after house caught, as if
  constructed of touchwood, and the fire roared and raged to such a degree,
  that those who stood by were too much terrified to render any effectual
  assistance. Indeed, the sole thought that now seemed to influence all was the
  preservation of a portion of their property. No one regarded his neighbour,
  or the safety of the city. The narrow street was instantly filled with goods
  and furniture of all kinds, thrown out of the windows or pushed out of the
  doors; but such was the fierceness of the fire, and the extraordinary
  rapidity with which it advanced, that the very articles attempted to be saved
  were seized by it, and thus formed a means of conveying it to the opposite
  houses.</p>

  <p>In this way a number of persons were inclosed for a short time between two
  fires, and seemed in imminent danger of being burned to death. The perilous
  nature of their situation was, moreover, increased by a sudden and violent
  gust of wind, which, blowing the flames right across the street, seemed to
  envelop all within them. The shrieks that burst from the poor creatures thus
  involved were most appalling. Fortunately, they sustained no greater damage
  than was occasioned by the fright and a slight scorching, for the next moment
  the wind shifted, and, sweeping back the flames, they were enabled to effect
  their retreat. Chowles and Judith were among the sufferers, and in the alarm
  of the moment lost all the booty they had obtained.</p>

  <p>Soon after this the whole street was on fire. All idea of preserving their
  property was therefore abandoned by the inhabitants, and they thought only of
  saving themselves. Hundreds of half-naked persons of both sexes rushed
  towards Thames-street in search of a place of refuge. The scene was wholly
  without parallel for terror. Many fires had occurred in London, but none that
  raged with such fierceness as the present conflagration, or promised to be so
  generally destructive. It gathered strength and fury each moment, now rising
  high into the air in a towering sheet of flame, now shooting forward like an
  enormous dragon vomiting streams of fire upon its foes. All at once the
  flames changed colour, and were partially obscured by a thick black smoke. A
  large warehouse filled with resin, tar, and other combustible matters, had
  caught fire, and the dense vapour proceeded from the burning pitch. But it
  cleared off in a few minutes, and the flames burnt more brightly and fiercely
  than ever.</p>

  <p>Up to this time, none of the civic authorities having arrived, several
  persons set off to give information of the calamity to the lord mayor (Sir
  Thomas Bludworth), and the other magistrates. A small party of the watch were
  on the spot, but they were unable to render any effectual assistance. As the
  conflagration advanced, those occupying houses in its track quitted them, and
  left their goods a prey to the numerous plunderers, who were now gathered
  together pursuing their vocation like unhallowed beings amid the raging
  element. The whole presented a scene of the wildest alarm, confusion, and
  license. Vociferations, oaths, shrieks, and outcries of every description
  stunned the ear. Night was turned into day. The awful roaring of the flames
  was ever and anon broken by the thundering fall of some heavy roof. Flakes of
  fire were scattered far and wide by the driving wind, carrying destruction
  wherever they alighted, and spreading the conflagration on all sides, till it
  seemed like a vast wedge of fire driven into the heart of the city. And thus
  it went on, swallowing up all before it, like an insatiate monster, and
  roaring for very joy. Meanwhile, the incendiaries had met, as concerted, near
  the foot of the bridge, and all except Philip Grant seemed to rejoice in the
  progress of the conflagration. Chowles made some comment upon his moody looks
  and silence, and whispered in his ear, "You have now an opportunity of
  retrieving your fortune, and may make yourself richer than your son. Take my
  advice, and do not let it pass."</p>

  <p>"Away, tempter!" cried Grant&mdash;"I have lighted a fire within my breast
  which never will be quenched."</p>

  <p>"Poh, poh!" rejoined Judith; "do not turn faint-hearted now."</p>

  <p>"The fire rages fiercely," cried Solomon Eagle, gazing at the vast sheet
  of flame overtopping the buildings near them, "but we must keep it alive.
  Take the remainder of the fire-balls, Hubert, and cast them into some of the
  old houses in Crooked-lane."</p>

  <p>Hubert prepared to obey. "I will go with you, and point out the best
  spots," said Chowles. "Our next place of rendezvous must be the vaults
  beneath Saint Faith's."</p>

  <p>"Agreed!" exclaimed the others. And they again separated, Hubert and
  Chowles to kindle fresh fires, and Grant to watch the conflagration at a
  distance. As to Solomon Eagle, he rushed towards the scene of destruction,
  and forcing himself into the midst of the crowd, mounted a post, crying in a
  loud voice:</p>

  <p>"I told you a second judgment would come upon you on account of your
  iniquities, and you now find that I avouched the truth. The Lord himself hath
  come to preach to you, as he did in the fiery mount of Sinai, and a terrible
  exhortation it shall be, and one ye shall not easily forget. This fire shall
  not be quenched till the whole city is laid prostrate. Ye doubted my words
  when I told you of the plague; ye laughed at me and scoffed me; but ye became
  believers in the end, and now conviction is forced upon you a second time.
  You will vainly attempt to save your dwellings. It is the Lord's will they
  should be destroyed, and man's efforts to avert the judgment will be
  ineffectual!"</p>

  <p>While the majority listened to him with fear and trembling, and regarded
  him as a prophet, a few took the opposite view of the question, and coupling
  his appearance with the sudden outbreak of the fire, were disposed to regard
  him as an incendiary. They therefore cried out&mdash;"He has set fire to our
  houses. Down with him! down with him!"</p>

  <p>Other voices joined in the outcry, and an attempt was made to carry the
  menace into effect; but a strong party rallied round the enthusiast, who
  derided the attempts of his opponents. Planting himself on the steps of Saint
  Margaret's Church, he continued to pour forth exhortations to the crowd,
  until he was driven into the interior of the pile by the fast-approaching
  flames. The whole body of the church was filled with poor wretches who had
  sought refuge within it, having brought with them such of their goods as they
  were able to carry off. But it soon became evident that the sacred structure
  would be destroyed, and their screams and cries on quitting it were truly
  heartrending. Solomon Eagle was the last to go forth, and he delayed his
  departure till the flames burst through the windows. Another great storehouse
  of oil, tar, cordage, hemp, flax, and other highly inflammable articles,
  adjoining the church, had caught fire, and the flames speedily reached the
  sacred fabric. The glass within the windows was shivered; the stone bars
  split asunder; and the seats and other woodwork withinside catching fire, the
  flames ascended to the roof, and kindled its massive rafters.</p>

  <p>Great efforts were now made to check the fire. A few of the cumbrous and
  unmanageable engines of the day were brought to the spot, but no water could
  be obtained. All the aqueducts, pipes, and sluices were dry, and the Thames
  water-tower was found to be out of order, and the pipes connected with it
  empty. To add to the calamity, the tide was out, and it was not only
  difficult, but dangerous, to obtain water from the river. The scanty supply
  served rather to increase than check the flames. All sorts of rumours
  prevailed among the crowd. It could no longer be doubted that the fire, which
  kept continually breaking out in fresh places, was the work of incendiaries,
  and it was now supposed that it must have been caused by the French or the
  Dutch, with both of which nations the country was then at war, and the most
  fearful anticipations that it was only the prelude of a sudden invasion were
  entertained. Some conjectured it might be the work of the Papists; and it
  chancing that a professor of that religion was discovered among the mob, he
  was with difficulty rescued from their fury by the watch, and conveyed to
  Newgate. Other persons, who were likewise suspected of being incendiaries,
  were conveyed with him.</p>

  <p>This, though it satisfied the multitude, did not check the progress of the
  fire, nor put a stop to the terror and tumult that prevailed. Every moment a
  fresh family were turned into the street, and by their cries added to the
  confusion. The plunderers had formed themselves into bands, pillaging
  everything they could lay hands on&mdash;carrying off boxes, goods, and
  coffers, breaking into cellars, broaching casks of spirits and ale, and
  emptying flasks of wine. Hundreds of persons who did not join in the pillage
  made free with the contents of the cellars, and a large portion of the
  concourse was soon in a state of intoxication.</p>

  <p>Thus, wild laughter and exclamations of frenzied mirth were heard amid the
  wailings of women and the piteous cries of children. It was indeed dreadful
  to see the old and bed-ridden forced into the street to seek a home where
  they could; nor yet less dreadful to behold others roused from a bed of
  sickness at dead of night, and by such a fearful summons. Still, fanned by
  the wind, and fed by a thousand combustible matters, the fire pressed
  fearfully on, devouring all before it, and increasing in fury and power each
  instant; while the drunken mob laughed, roared, shouted, and rejoiced beside
  it, as if in emulation of the raging flames.</p>

  <p>To proceed for a moment to Wood Street. When Philip Grant quitted Leonard
  in the manner before related, the latter followed him to the door, and saw
  him disappear in the gloom. But he did not attempt pursuit, because he could
  not persuade himself that any danger was really to be apprehended. He thought
  it, however, advisable to consult with Mr. Bloundel on the subject, and
  accordingly proceeded to his room and roused him.</p>

  <p>After hearing what had occurred, the grocer looked very grave, and said,
  "I am not disposed to treat this matter so lightly as you do, Leonard. I fear
  this unhappy man has some desperate design in view. What it is I
  cannot&mdash;dare not&mdash;conjecture. But I confess I am full of
  apprehension. I shall not retire to rest to-night, but shall hold myself in
  readiness to act in whatever way may be necessary, You had better go forth,
  and if anything occurs, give notice to the proper authorities. We have not
  now such a lord mayor as we had during the season of the plague. The firm and
  courageous Sir John Lawrence is but ill succeeded by the weak and vacillating
  Sir Thomas Bludworth. Still, the latter may be equal to this emergency, and
  if anything happens, you must apply to him."</p>

  <p>"I will follow your advice implicitly," rejoined Leonard. "At the same
  time, I think there is nothing to apprehend."</p>

  <p>"It is better to err on the safe side," observed the grocer; "you cannot
  then reproach yourself with want of caution."</p>

  <p>Shortly after this, Leonard sallied forth, and having determined what
  course to pursue in the first instance, proceeded to Saint Paul's. He found
  every door in the sacred structure fast closed. Not satisfied with this, he
  knocked at the great northern entrance till the summons was answered by a
  verger, and stating his object, demanded to be admitted, and to search the
  cathedral, as well as Saint Faith's. The verger offered no objection, and
  having examined the old building throughout, without discovering any traces
  of the person he was in quest of, Leonard quitted it.</p>

  <p>More than ever convinced that he was right in his supposition, and that no
  danger was to be apprehended, he was about to return home, when the idea
  occurred to him that he might perhaps find Grant at the plague-pit in
  Finsbury Fields, and he accordingly shaped his course thither. A long period
  had elapsed since he had last visited the melancholy spot, and it was not
  without much painful emotion that he drew near the vast mound covering the
  victims of the pestilence. But Grant was not there, and though he paced round
  and round the dreary inclosure for some time, no one came. He then proceeded
  to the lesser plague-pit, and kneeling beside the grave of Amabel, bedewed it
  with his tears.</p>

  <p>As he arose, with the intention of returning to Wood Street, he observed
  an extraordinary light in the sky a little to the left, evidently produced by
  the reflection of a great fire in that direction. On beholding this light, he
  said to himself, "Mr. Bloundel was right. This is the danger with which the
  city is threatened. It is now too late to avert it." Determined, however, to
  ascertain the extent of the calamity without an instant's loss of time, he
  set off at a swift pace, and in less than half an hour reached Fish Street
  Hill, and stood beside the conflagration. It was then nearly three o'clock,
  and a vast chasm of blackening ruins proclaimed the devastation that had been
  committed. Just as he arrived, the roof of Saint Margaret's fell in with a
  tremendous crash, and for a few minutes the fire was subdued. It then arose
  with greater fury than ever; burst out on both sides of the sacred structure,
  and caught the line of houses leading towards London Bridge. The first house
  was that of a vintner; and the lower part of the premises&mdash;the cellars
  and vaults&mdash;were filled with wine and spirits. These instantly blazed
  up, and burnt with such intensity that the adjoining habitation was presently
  in flames.</p>

  <p>"I know who hath done all this!" exclaimed Leonard, half involuntarily, as
  he gazed on the work of destruction.</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" exclaimed a bystander, gazing at him. "Who is it?&mdash;the
  Dutchman or the Frenchman?"</p>

  <p>"Neither," replied Leonard, who at that moment discovered Grant among the
  group opposite him. "Yonder stands the incendiary!"</p>

  <h2><a id="ch6-3"
     name="ch6-3">III. &mdash; PROGRESS OF THE FIRE.</a></h2>

  <p>Instantly surrounded and seized by the mob, Grant offered no resistance,
  but demanded to be led with his accuser before a magistrate. Almost as the
  words were uttered, a cry was raised that the lord mayor and the sheriffs
  were coming along East-cheap, and the prisoner and Leonard were immediately
  hurried off in that direction. They met the civic authorities at the corner
  of Saint Clement's-lane; but instead of paying any attention to them, the
  lord mayor, who appeared to be in a state of great agitation and excitement,
  ordered the javelin-men, by whom he was attended, to push the mob aside.</p>

  <p>"I will not delay your worship an instant," cried Leonard; "but this
  dreadful fire is the work of incendiaries, of whom that man," pointing to
  Grant, "is the principal. I pray your worship to question him. He may have
  important revelations to make."</p>

  <p>"Eh, what?" cried the lord mayor, addressing Grant. "Is it true you are an
  incendiary? Who are your accomplices? Where are they?"</p>

  <p>"I have none," replied Grant, boldly&mdash;"I deny the charge altogether.
  Let my accuser prove it if he can."</p>

  <p>"You hear what he says, young man," said the mayor. "Did you see him set
  fire to any house? Did you find any fire-balls on his person?"</p>

  <p>"I did not," replied Leonard.</p>

  <p>"I searched him, your worship," cried Chowles, who was among the
  bystanders, "the moment he was seized, and found nothing upon him. It is a
  false and malicious charge."</p>

  <p>"It looks like it, I must say," replied the mayor. "On what grounds do you
  accuse him?" he added, angrily, to Leonard.</p>

  <p>"On these," replied Leonard. "He came to me three hours ago, and confessed
  that he had a desperate design against the safety of the city, and made
  certain proposals to me, to which I would not listen. This is not the season
  for a full explanation of the matter. But I pray your worship, as you value
  the welfare of the city, to have him secured."</p>

  <p>"There can be no harm in that," replied the lord mayor. "His appearance is
  decidedly against him. Let him be taken care of till the morrow, when I will
  examine further into the matter. Your name and place of abode, young
  man?"</p>

  <p>"I am called Leonard Holt, and my business is that of a grocer, in
  Wood-street," was the reply.</p>

  <p>"Enough," rejoined the mayor. "Take away the prisoner. I will hear nothing
  further now. Lord! Lord! how the fire rages, to be sure. We shall have the
  whole city burnt down, if we do not take care."</p>

  <p>"That we shall, indeed," replied Sir Robert Viner, one of the sheriffs,
  "unless the most prompt and decisive measures are immediately adopted."</p>

  <p>"What would you recommend?" cried the lord mayor, despairingly. Sir Robert
  looked perplexed by the question.</p>

  <p>"If I might offer an opinion," interposed Leonard, "I would advise your
  worship to pull down all the houses in the way of the fire, as the only means
  of checking it."</p>

  <p>"Pull down the houses!" cried the lord mayor. "Who ever heard of such an
  idea? Why, that would be worse than the fire. No, no; that will never
  do."</p>

  <p>"The young man is in the right," observed Sir Joseph Sheldon, the other
  sheriff.</p>

  <p>"Well, well&mdash;we shall see," replied the mayor. "But we are losing
  time here. Forward! forward!"</p>

  <p>And while Grant was borne off to Newgate by a guard of javelin-men, the
  lord mayor and his company proceeded to Fish-street-hill, where the whole
  conflagration burst upon them. The moment the lord mayor appeared, he was
  beset on all sides by hundreds of families soliciting his protection. Others
  came to give him the alarming intelligence that a very scanty supply of water
  only could be obtained, and that already two engines had been destroyed,
  while the firemen who worked them had narrowly escaped with life. Others
  again pressed him for instructions how to act&mdash;some suggesting one
  plan&mdash;some another,&mdash;and being of a weak and irresolute character,
  and utterly unequal to a fearful emergency like the present, he was
  completely bewildered. Bidding the houseless families take refuge in the
  churches, he ordered certain officers to attend them, and affecting to doubt
  the statement of those who affirmed there was no water, advised them to go to
  the river, where they would find plenty. In vain they assured him the tide
  was out, the Thames water-tower empty, the pipes and conduits dry. He would
  not believe anything of the sort, but upbraiding his informants with neglect,
  bade them try again. As to instructions, he could give none.</p>

  <p>At last, a reluctant assent being wrung from him by Sir Joseph Sheldon,
  that a house should be pulled down, as suggested by Leonard, preparations
  were instantly made for putting the design into execution. The house selected
  was about four doors from the top of Fish-street-hill, and belonged to a
  birdcage-maker. But they encountered an unexpected opposition. Having
  ascertained their purpose, the owner fastened his doors, and refused to admit
  them. He harangued the mob from one of the upper windows, and producing a
  pistol, threatened to fire upon them if they attempted to gain a forcible
  entrance. The officers, however, having received their orders, were not to be
  intimidated, and commenced breaking down the door. The birdcage-maker then
  fired, but without effect; and before he had time to reload, the door had
  yielded to the combined efforts of the multitude, who were greatly enraged at
  his strange conduct. They rushed upstairs, but finding he had locked himself
  in the room, left him there, supposing him secure, and commenced the work of
  demolition. More than a hundred men were engaged in the task; but though they
  used the utmost exertion, they had little more than unroofed the building,
  when a cry was raised by those in the street that the house was on fire.
  Alarmed by the shout, they descended, and found the report true. Flames were
  issuing from the room lately occupied by the birdcage-maker. The wretch had
  set fire to his dwelling, and then made his escape with his family by a back
  staircase. Thus defeated, the workmen, with bitter imprecations on the
  fugitive, withdrew, and Leonard, who had lent his best assistance to the
  task, repaired to the lord mayor. He found him in greater consternation than
  ever.</p>

  <p>"We must go further off, if we would do any good," said Leonard; "and as
  the present plan is evidently too slow, we must have recourse to
  gunpowder."</p>

  <p>"Gunpowder!" exclaimed the lord mayor. "Would you blow up the city, like a
  second Guy Fawkes? I begin to suspect you are one of the incendiaries
  yourself, young man. Lord, Lord! what will become of us?"</p>

  <p>"If your worship disapproves of my suggestion, at least give orders what
  is to be done," rejoined Leonard.</p>

  <p>"I have done all I can," replied the mayor. "Who are you that talk to me
  thus?"</p>

  <p>"I have told your worship I am a simple tradesman," replied Leonard. "But
  I have the welfare of the city at heart, and I cannot stand by and see it
  burnt to the ground without an effort to save it."</p>

  <p>"Well, well, I dare say you mean very well, young man," rejoined the lord
  mayor, somewhat pacified. "But don't you perceive it's impossible to stop
  such a fire as this without water, or engines. I'm sure I would willingly lay
  down my life to preserve the city. But what can I do?&mdash;what can any man
  do?"</p>

  <p>"Much may be done if there is resolution to attempt it," returned Leonard.
  "I would recommend your worship to proceed, in the first place, to the
  wharves on the banks of the Thames, and cause the removal of the wood, coal,
  and other combustible matter with which they are crowded."</p>

  <p>"Well thought of," cried the lord mayor. "I will go thither at once. Do
  you stay here. Your advice will be useful. I will examine you touching the
  incendiary to-morrow&mdash;that is, if we are any of us left alive, which I
  don't expect. Lord, Lord! what will become of us?" And with many similar
  ejaculations, he hurried off with the sheriffs, and the greater part of his
  attendants, and taking his way down Saint Michael's-lane, soon reached the
  river-side.</p>

  <p>By this time, the fire had approached the summit of Fish-street-hill, and
  here the overhanging stories of the houses coming so close together as almost
  to meet at the top, the flames speedily caught the other side, and spread the
  conflagration in that direction. Two other houses were likewise discovered to
  be on fire in Crooked-lane, and in an incredibly short space the whole dense
  mass of habitations lying at the west side of Fish-street-hill, and between
  Crooked-lane and Eastcheap, were in flames, and threatening the venerable
  church of Saint Michael, which stood in the midst of them, with instant
  destruction. To the astonishment of all who witnessed it, the conflagration
  seemed to proceed as rapidly against the wind, as with it, and to be
  approaching Thames-street, both by Pudding-lane and Saint Michael's-lane. A
  large stable, filled with straw and hay, at the back of the Star Inn, in
  Little Eastcheap, caught fire, and carrying the conflagration eastward, had
  already conveyed it as far as Botolph-lane.</p>

  <p>It chanced that a poor Catholic priest, travelling from Douay to England,
  had landed that night, and taken up his quarters at the hotel above
  mentioned. The landlord, who had been roused by the cries of fire, and
  alarmed by the rumours of incendiaries, immediately called to mind his guest,
  and dragging him from his room, thrust him, half-naked, into the street.
  Announcing his conviction that the poor priest was an incendiary to the mob
  without, they seized him, and in spite of his protestations and explanations,
  which, being uttered in a foreign tongue, they could not comprehend, they
  were about to exercise summary punishment upon him, by hanging him to the
  sign-post before the landlord's door, when they were diverted from their
  dreadful purpose by Solomon Eagle, who prevailed upon them to carry him to
  Newgate.</p>

  <p>The conflagration had now assumed so terrific a character that it appalled
  even the stoutest spectator. It has been mentioned, that for many weeks
  previous to the direful calamity, the weather had been remarkably dry and
  warm, a circumstance which had prepared the old wooden houses, abounding in
  this part of the city, for almost instantaneous ignition. Added to this, if
  the incendiaries themselves had deposited combustible materials at certain
  spots to extend the conflagration, they could not have selected better places
  than accident had arranged. All sorts of inflammable goods were contained in
  the shops and ware-houses,&mdash;oil, hemp, flax, pitch, tar, cordage, sugar,
  wine, and spirits; and when any magazine of this sort caught fire, it spread
  the conflagration with tenfold rapidity.</p>

  <p>The heat of the flames had now become almost insufferable, and the sparks
  and flakes of fire fell so fast and thick, that the spectators were compelled
  to retreat to a considerable distance from the burning buildings. The noise
  occasioned by the cracking of the timbers, and the falling of walls and
  roofs, was awful in the extreme. All the avenues and thoroughfares near the
  fire were now choked up by carts, coaches, and other vehicles, which had been
  hastily brought thither to remove the goods of the inhabitants, and the hurry
  of the poor people to save a wreck of their property, and the attempts made
  by the gangs of plunderers to deprive them of it, constituted a scene of
  unparalleled tumult and confusion. As yet, no troops had appeared to maintain
  order, and seeing that as much mischief was almost done by the plunderers as
  by the fire, Leonard determined to go in search of the lord mayor, and
  acquaint him with the mischief that was occurring. Having heard that the fire
  had already reached London Bridge, he resolved to ascertain whether the
  report was true. As he proceeded down Saint Michael's-lane, he found the
  venerable church from which it was designated on fire, and with some
  difficulty forcing his way through the crowd, reached Thames-street, where he
  discovered that the conflagration had even made more fearful progress than he
  had anticipated. Fishmongers' Hall, a large square structure, was on fire,
  and burning swiftly,&mdash;the flames encircling its high roof, and the
  turret by which it was surmounted. Streams of fire, too, had darted down the
  numerous narrow alleys leading to the river-side, and reaching the wharves,
  had kindled the heaps of wood and coal with which they were filled. The party
  under the command of the lord mayor had used their utmost exertions to get
  rid of these combustible materials by flinging them into the Thames; but they
  came too late, and were driven away by the approach of the fire. Most of the
  barges and heavy craft were aground, and they, too, caught fire, and were
  burned, with their contents.</p>

  <p>Finding he could neither render any assistance, nor obtain speech with the
  lord mayor, and anxious to behold the terrible yet sublime spectacle from the
  river, Leonard hastened to Old Swan-Stairs, and springing into a boat,
  ordered the waterman to row into the middle of the Thames. He could then
  discern the full extent of the conflagration, and trace the progress it was
  making. All the houses between Fishmongers' Hall and the bridge were on fire,
  and behind them rose a vast sheet of flame. Saint Magnus' Church, at the foot
  of the bridge, was next seized by the flame, and Leonard watched its
  destruction. An ancient gateway followed, and soon afterwards a large stack
  of houses erected upon the bridge burst into flames.</p>

  <p>The inhabitants of the houses on the bridge, having now become thoroughly
  alarmed, flung bedding, boxes, and articles of furniture, out of their
  windows into the river. A crowd of boats surrounded the starlings, and the
  terrified occupants of the structures above descending to them by the
  staircases in the interior of the piers, embarked with every article they
  could carry off. The river presented a most extraordinary scene. Lighted by
  the red and fierce reflection of the fire, and covered with boats, filled
  with families who had just quitted their habitations either on the bridge or
  in some other street adjoining it, its whole surface was speckled with pieces
  of furniture, or goods, that had been cast into it, and which were now
  floating up with the tide. Great crowds were collected on the Southwark shore
  to watch the conflagration, while on the opposite side the wharves and quays
  were thronged with persons removing their goods, and embarking them in boats.
  One circumstance, noted by Pepys, and which also struck Leonard, was the
  singular attachment displayed by the pigeons, kept by the owners of several
  houses on the bridge, to the spots they had been accustomed to. Even when the
  flames attacked the buildings to which the dovecots were attached, the birds
  wheeled round and round them, until, their pinions being scorched by the
  fire, they dropped into the water.</p>

  <p>Leonard remained on the river nearly two hours. He could not, in fact,
  tear himself away from the spectacle, which possessed a strange fascination
  in his eyes. He began to think that all the efforts of men were unavailing to
  arrest the progress of destruction, and he was for awhile content to regard
  it as a mere spectacle. And never had he beheld a more impressive&mdash;a
  more terrible sight. There lay the vast and populous city before him, which
  he had once before known to be invaded by an invisible but extirminating foe,
  now attacked by a furious and far-seen enemy. The fire seemed to form a vast
  arch&mdash;many-coloured as a rainbow,&mdash;reflected in the sky, and
  re-reflected in all its horrible splendour in the river.</p>

  <p>Nor was the aspect of the city less striking. The innumerable towers and
  spires of the churches rose tall and dark through the wavering sheet of
  flame, and every now and then one of them would topple down or disappear, as
  if swallowed up by the devouring element. For a short space, the fire seemed
  to observe a regular progressive movement, but when it fell upon better
  material, it reared its blazing crest aloft, changed its hues, and burnt with
  redoubled intensity. Leonard watched it thread narrow alleys, and firing
  every lesser habitation in its course, kindle some great hall or other
  structure, whose remoteness seemed to secure it from immediate danger. At
  this distance, the roaring of the flames resembled that of a thousand
  furnaces. Ever and anon, it was broken by a sound like thunder, occasioned by
  the fall of some mighty edifice. Then there would come a quick succession of
  reports like the discharge of artillery, followed by a shower of fiery flakes
  and sparks blown aloft, like the explosion of some stupendous firework. Mixed
  with the roaring of the flames, the thunder of falling roofs, the cracking of
  timber, was a wild hubbub of human voices, that sounded afar off like a
  dismal wail. In spite of its terror, the appearance of the fire was at that
  time beautiful beyond description. Its varying colours&mdash;its fanciful
  forms&mdash;now shooting out in a hundred different directions, like
  lightning-flashes,&mdash;now drawing itself up, as it were, and soaring
  aloft,&mdash;now splitting into a million tongues of flame,&mdash;these
  aspects so riveted the attention of Leonard, that he almost forgot in the
  sight the dreadful devastation going forward. His eyes ached with gazing at
  the fiery spectacle, and he was glad to rest them on the black masses of
  building that stood in stern relief against it, and which there could be
  little doubt would soon become its prey.</p>

  <p>It was now broad daylight, except for the mighty cloud of smoke, which
  o'er-canopied the city, creating an artificial gloom. Leonard's troubled gaze
  wandered from the scene of destruction to Saint Paul's&mdash;an edifice,
  which; from the many events connected with his fortunes that had occurred
  there, had always a singular interest in his eyes. Calling to mind the
  denunciations poured forth by Solomon Eagle against this fane, he could not
  help fearing they would now be fulfilled. What added to his misgivings was,
  that it was now almost entirely surrounded by poles and scaffolding. Ever
  since the cessation of the plague, the repairs, suspended during that awful
  season, had been recommenced under the superintendence of Doctor Christopher
  Wren, and were now proceeding with renewed activity. The whole of the
  building was under repair, and a vast number of masons were employed upon it,
  and it was their scaffolding that impressed Leonard with a dread of what
  afterwards actually occurred. Accustomed to connect the figure of Solomon
  Eagle with the sacred structure, he could not help fancying that he
  discovered a speck resembling a human figure on the central tower. If it were
  the enthusiast, what must his feelings be at finding his predictions so
  fatally fulfilled? Little did Leonard think how the prophecy had been
  accomplished!</p>

  <p>But his attention was speedily called to the progress of the
  conflagration. From the increased tumult in the city, it was evident the
  inhabitants were now thoroughly roused, and actively bestirring themselves to
  save their property. This was apparent, even on the river, from the multitude
  of boats deeply laden with goods of all kinds, which were now seen shaping
  their course towards Westminster. The fire, also, had made rapid progress on
  all sides. The vast pile of habitations at the north side of the bridge was
  now entirely in flames. The effect of this was awfully fine. Not only did the
  flames mount to a greater height, and appear singularly conspicuous from the
  situation of the houses, but every instant some blazing fragment fell with a
  tremendous splash into the water, where it hissed for a moment, and then was
  for ever quenched, floating a black mass upon the surface. From the foot of
  the bridge to Coal Harbour Stairs, extended what Dryden finely calls "a quay
  of fire." All the wharves and warehouses were in flames, and burning with
  astonishing rapidity, while this part of Thames-street, "the lodge of all
  combustibles," had likewise become a prey to the devouring element. The fire,
  too, had spread in an easterly direction, and consuming three churches,
  namely, Saint Andrew's, in Botolph-lane, Saint Mary's, in Love-lane, and
  Saint Dunstan's in the East, had invaded Tower-street, and seemed fast
  approaching the ancient fortress. So fascinated was Leonard with the sight,
  that he could have been well content to remain all day gazing at it, but he
  now recollected that he had other duties to perform, and directing the
  waterman to land him at Queenhithe, ascended Bread-street-hill, and betook
  himself to Wood-street.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch6-4"
     name="ch6-4">IV. &mdash; LEONARD'S INTERVIEW WITH THE KING.</a></h2>

  <p>Some rumours of the conflagration, as will be supposed, had ere this
  reached Mr. Bloundel, but he had no idea of the extent of the direful
  calamity, and when informed of it by Leonard, lifted up his hands
  despairingly, exclaiming, in accents of the deepest affliction&mdash;"Another
  judgment, then, has fallen upon this sinful city,&mdash;another judgment yet
  more terrible than the first. Man may have kindled this great fire, but the
  hand of God is apparent in it. 'Alas! alas! for thee, thou great city,
  Babylon! Alas for thee, thou mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment
  come. The kings of the earth shall bewail thee, and lament for thee, when
  they see the smoke of thy burning.'"</p>

  <p>"Your dwelling was spared in the last visitation, sir," observed Leonard,
  after a pause, "and you were able to shut yourself up, as in a strong castle,
  against the all-exterminating foe. But I fear you will not be able to ward
  off the assaults of the present enemy, and recommend you to remove your
  family and goods without delay to some place of security far from this doomed
  city."</p>

  <p>"This is the Lord's Day, Leonard, and must be kept holy," replied the
  grocer. "To-morrow, if I am spared so long, I will endeavour to find some
  place of shelter."</p>

  <p>"If the conflagration continues to spread as rapidly as it is now doing,
  to-morrow will be too late," rejoined Leonard.</p>

  <p>"It may be so," returned the grocer, "but I will not violate the Sabbath.
  If the safety of my family is threatened, that is another matter, but I will
  not attempt to preserve my goods. Do not, however, let me influence you. Take
  such portion of our stock as belongs to you, and you know that a third of the
  whole is yours, and convey it where you please."</p>

  <p>"On no account, sir," interrupted Leonard. "I should never think of acting
  in opposition to your wishes. This will be a sad Sunday for London."</p>

  <p>"The saddest she has ever seen," replied the grocer; "for though the voice
  of prayer was silenced in her churches during the awful season of the plague,
  yet then men's minds had been gradually prepared for the calamity, and though
  filled with terror, they were not taken by surprise, as must now be the case.
  But let us to prayers, and may our earnest supplications avail in turning
  aside the Divine displeasure."</p>

  <p>And summoning his family and household, all of whom were by this time
  stirring, and in the utmost consternation at what they had heard of the fire,
  he commenced a prayer adapted to the occasion in a strain of the utmost
  fervour; and as Leonard gazed at his austere countenance, now lighted up with
  holy zeal, and listened to his earnest intercessions in behalf of the devoted
  city, he was reminded of the prophet Jeremiah weeping for Jerusalem before
  the throne of grace.</p>

  <p>Prayers over, the whole party sat down to their morning repast, after
  which, the grocer and his eldest son, accompanied by Leonard and Blaize,
  mounted to the roof of the house, and gazing in the direction of the
  conflagration, they could plainly distinguish the vast cloud of yellow smoke
  commingled with flame that marked the scene of its ravages. As the wind blew
  from this quarter, charged, as has been stated, with a cloud of sparks, many
  of the fire-drops were dashed in their faces, and compelled them to shade
  their eyes. The same awful roar which Leonard had heard on the river likewise
  broke upon their ears, while from all the adjoining streets arose a wild
  clamour of human voices, the burden of whose cries was "Fire! Fire!" The
  church bells, which should have been tolling to early devotion, were now
  loudly ringing the alarm, while their towers were crowded, as were the roofs
  of most of the houses, with persons gazing towards the scene of devastation.
  Nothing could be more opposite to the stillness and quiet of a Sabbath morn;
  and as the grocer listened to the noise and tumult prevailing around him, he
  could not repress a groan.</p>

  <p>"I never thought my ears would be so much offended on this day," he said.
  "Let us go down. I have seen and heard enough."</p>

  <p>They then descended, and Stephen Bloundel, who was greatly alarmed by what
  he had just witnessed, strongly urged his father to remove immediately.
  "There are seasons," said the young man, "when even our duty to Heaven
  becomes a secondary consideration; and I should be sorry if the fruit of your
  industry were sacrificed to your religious scruples."</p>

  <p>"There are no such seasons," replied the grocer, severely; "and I am
  grieved that a son of mine should think so. If the inhabitants of this sinful
  city had not broken the Sabbath, and neglected God's commandments, this heavy
  judgment would not have fallen upon them. I shall neglect no precaution for
  the personal safety of my family, but I place my worldly goods in the hands
  of Him from whom I derived them, and to whom I am ready to restore them,
  whenever it shall please Him to take them."</p>

  <p>"I am rebuked, father," replied Stephen, humbly; "and entreat your pardon
  for having ventured to differ with you. I am now fully sensible of the
  propriety of your conduct."</p>

  <p>"And I have ever acquiesced in your wishes, be they what they may," said
  Mrs. Bloundel to her husband; "but I confess I am dreadfully frightened. I
  hope you will remove the first thing to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"When midnight has struck, and the Sabbath is past, I shall commence my
  preparations," replied the grocer. "You must rest content till then." Mrs.
  Bloundel heaved a sigh, but said no more; and the grocer, retiring to a
  side-table, opened the Bible, and sat down calmly to its perusal. But though
  no further remonstrances reached his ears, there was great murmuring in the
  kitchen on the part of Blaize and Patience.</p>

  <p>"Goodness knows what will become of us!" cried the latter. "I expect we
  shall all be burnt alive, owing to our master's obstinacy. What harm can
  there be in moving on a Sunday, I should like to know? I'm sure I'm too much
  hurried and flurried to say my prayers as I ought to do."</p>

  <p>"And so am I," replied Blaize. "Mr. Bloundel is a great deal too
  particular. What a dreadful thing it would be if the house should be burnt
  down, and all my mother's savings, which were to form a provision for our
  marriage, lost."</p>

  <p>"That would be terrible, indeed," cried Patience, with a look of dismay.
  "I think the wedding had better take place as soon as the fire is over. It
  can't last many days if it goes on at this rate."</p>

  <p>"You are right," returned Blaize. "I have no objection. I'll speak to my
  mother at once." And stepping into the scullery, where old Josyna was washing
  some dishes, he addressed her&mdash;"Mother, I'm sadly afraid this great fire
  will reach us before our master will allow us to move. Hadn't you better let
  me take care of the money you intended giving me on my marriage with
  Patience?"</p>

  <p>"No, no, myn goed zoon," replied Josyna, shaking her head&mdash;"I musd
  zee you married virsd."</p>

  <p>"But I can't be married to-day," cried Blaize&mdash;"and there's no time
  to lose. The fire will be upon us directly."</p>

  <p>"I cand help dat," returned his mother. "We musd place our drusd in
  God."</p>

  <p>"There I quite agree with you, mother," replied Blaize; "but we must also
  take care of ourselves. If you won't give me the money, at least put it in a
  box to carry off at a moment's notice."</p>

  <p>"Don't be afraid, myn zoon," replied Josyna. "I wond forged id."</p>

  <p>"I'm sadly afraid you will, though," muttered Blaize, as he walked away.
  "There's no doing any good with her," he added to Patience. "She's as
  obstinate as Mr. Bloundel. I should like to see the fire of all things; but I
  suppose I musn't leave the house."</p>

  <p>"Of course not," replied Patience, pettishly; "at such a time it would be
  highly improper. I forbid that."</p>

  <p>"Then I must need submit," groaned Blaize&mdash;"I can't even have my own
  way before marriage."</p>

  <p>When the proper time arrived, the grocer, accompanied by all his family
  and household, except old Josyna, who was left in charge of the house,
  repaired to the neighbouring church of Saint Alban's, but, finding the doors
  closed, and that no service was to be performed, he returned home with a
  sorrowful heart. Soon after this, Leonard took Mr. Bloundel apart, and
  observed to him, "I have a strong conviction that I could be useful in
  arresting the progress of the conflagration, and, as I cannot attend church
  service, I will, with your permission, devote myself to that object. It is my
  intention to proceed to Whitehall, and, if possible, obtain an audience of
  the king, and if I succeed in doing so, to lay a plan before him, which I
  think would prove efficacious."</p>

  <p>"I will not ask what the plan is," rejoined the grocer, "because I doubt
  its success. Neither will I oppose your design, which is praiseworthy. Go,
  and may it prosper. Return in the evening, for I may need your
  assistance&mdash;perhaps protection."</p>

  <p>Leonard then prepared to set forth. Blaize begged hard to accompany him,
  but was refused. Forcing his way through the host of carts, coaches, drays,
  and other vehicles thronging the streets, Leonard made the best of his way to
  Whitehall, where he speedily arrived. A large body of mounted troopers were
  stationed before the gates of the palace, and a regiment of the foot-guards
  were drawn up in the court. Drums were beating to arms, and other martial
  sounds were heard, showing the alarm that was felt. Leonard was stopped at
  the gate by a sentinel, and refused admittance; and he would in all
  probability have been turned back, if at that moment the Lords Argentine and
  Rochester had not come up. On seeing him, the former frowned, and passed
  quickly on, but the latter halted.</p>

  <p>"You seem to be in some difficulty," remarked Rochester. "Can I help
  you?"</p>

  <p>Leonard was about to turn away, but he checked himself. "I will not suffer
  my resentful feelings to operate injuriously to others," he muttered. "I
  desire to see the king, my lord," he added, to the earl. "I have a proposal
  to make to him, which I think would be a means of checking the
  conflagration."</p>

  <p>"Say you so?" cried Rochester. "Come along, then. Heaven grant your plan
  may prove successful; in which case, I promise you, you shall be nobly
  rewarded."</p>

  <p>"I seek no reward, my lord," replied Leonard. "All I desire is to save the
  city."</p>

  <p>"Well, well," rejoined Rochester, "it will be time enough to refuse his
  majesty's bounty when offered."</p>

  <p>Upon this, he ordered the sentinel to withdraw, and Leonard followed him
  into the palace. They found the entrance-hall filled with groups of officers
  and attendants, all conversing together, it was evident from their looks and
  manner, on the one engrossing topic&mdash;the conflagration. Ascending a
  magnificent staircase, and traversing part of a grand gallery, they entered
  an ante-room, in which a number of courtiers and. pages&mdash;amongst the
  latter of whom was Chiffinch&mdash;were assembled. At the door of the inner
  chamber stood a couple of ushers, and as the earl approached, it was
  instantly thrown open. As Leonard, however, who followed close behind his
  leader, passed Chiffinch, the latter caught hold of his arm and detained him.
  Hearing the movement, Rochester turned, and said quickly to the page, "Let
  him pass, he is going with me."</p>

  <p>"Old Rowley is in no humour for a jest to-day, my lord," replied
  Chiffinch, familiarly. "He is more serious than I have ever before seen him,
  and takes this terrible fire sadly to heart, as well he may. Mr. Secretary
  Pepys, of the Admiralty, is with him, and is detailing all particulars of the
  calamity to him, I believe."</p>

  <p>"It is in reference to the fire that I have brought this young man with
  me," returned the earl. "Let him pass, I say. State your plan boldly," he
  added, as they entered the audience-chamber.</p>

  <p>At the further end of the long apartment, on a chair of state, and beneath
  a canopy, sat Charles. He was evidently much disturbed, and looked eagerly at
  the new-comers, especially at Leonard, expecting to find him the bearer of
  some important intelligence. On the right of the king, and near an open
  window, which, looking towards the river, commanded a view of the fire on the
  bridge, as well as of part of the burning city, stood the Duke of York. The
  duke did not appear much concerned at the calamity, but was laughing with
  Lord Argentine, who stood close beside him. The smile fled from the lips of
  the latter as he beheld Leonard, and he looked angrily at Rochester, who did
  not, however, appear to notice his displeasure. On the left of the royal
  chair was Mr. Pepys, engaged, as Chiffinch had intimated, in detailing to the
  king the progress of the conflagration; and next to the secretary stood the
  Earl of Craven,&mdash;a handsome, commanding, and martial-looking personage,
  though somewhat stricken in years. Three other noblemen&mdash; namely, the
  Lords Hollis, Arlington, and Ashley&mdash;were likewise present.</p>

  <p>"Who have you with you, Rochester?" demanded Charles, as the earl and his
  companion approached him.</p>

  <p>"A young man, my liege, who desires to make known to you a plan for
  checking this conflagration," replied the earl.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" exclaimed the king; "let him accomplish that for us, and he shall
  ask what he will in return."</p>

  <p>"I ventured to promise him as much," observed Rochester.</p>

  <p>"Mine is a very simple and a very obvious plan, sire," said Leonard; "but
  I will engage, on the peril of my life, if you will give me sufficient
  authority, and means to work withal, to stop the further progress of this
  fire."</p>

  <p>"In what way?" asked Charles, impatiently;&mdash;"in what way?"</p>

  <p>"By demolishing the houses around the conflagration with gunpowder, so as
  to form a wide gap between those left and the flames," replied Leonard.</p>

  <p>"A short and summary process, truly," replied the king; "but it would
  occasion great waste of property, and might be attended with other serious
  consequences."</p>

  <p>"Not half so much property will be destroyed as if the slower and
  seemingly safer course of pulling down the houses is pursued," rejoined
  Leonard. "That experiment has been tried and failed."</p>

  <p>"I am of the young man's opinion," observed the Earl of Craven.</p>

  <p>"And I," added Pepys. "Better lose half the city than the whole. As it is,
  your majesty is not safe in your palace."</p>

  <p>"Why, you do not think it can reach Whitehall?" cried the king, rising,
  and walking to the window. "How say you, brother," he added, to the Duke of
  York&mdash;"shall we act upon this young man's suggestion, and order the
  wholesale demolition of the houses which he recommends?"</p>

  <p>"I would not advise your majesty to do so&mdash;at least, not without
  consideration," answered the duke. "This is a terrible fire, no doubt; but
  the danger may be greatly exaggerated, and if any ill consequences should
  result from the proposed scheme, the blame will be entirely laid upon your
  majesty."</p>

  <p>"I care not for that," replied the king, "provided I feel assured it is
  for the best."</p>

  <p>"The plan would do incalculably more mischief than the fire itself,"
  observed Lord Argentine, "and would be met by the most determined opposition
  on the part of the owners of the habitations condemned to destruction. Whole
  streets will have to be blown up, and your majesty will easily comprehend the
  confusion and damage that will ensue."</p>

  <p>"Lord Argentine has expressed my sentiments exactly," said the Duke of
  York.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing for it, then, but for your majesty to call for a fiddle,
  and amuse yourself, like Nero, while your city is burning," remarked
  Rochester, sarcastically.</p>

  <p>"Another such jest, my lord," rejoined the king, sternly, "and it shall
  cost you your liberty. I will go upon the river instantly, and view the fire
  myself, and then decide what course shall be adopted."</p>

  <p>"There are rumours that incendiaries are abroad, your majesty," remarked
  Argentine, glancing maliciously at Leonard&mdash;"it is not unlikely that he
  who lighted the fire should know how to extinguish it."</p>

  <p>"His lordship says truly," rejoined Leonard. "There <i>are</i>
  incendiaries abroad, and the chief of them was taken by my hand, and lodged
  in Newgate, where he lies for examination."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" exclaimed the king, eagerly; "did you catch the miscreant in the
  fact?"</p>

  <p>"No, my liege," replied Leonard; "but he came to me a few hours before the
  outbreak of the fire, intimating that he was in possession of a plot against
  the city&mdash;a design so monstrous, that your majesty would give any reward
  to the discloser of it. He proposed to reveal this plot to me on certain
  terms."</p>

  <p>"And you accepted them?" cried the king.</p>

  <p>"No, my liege," replied Leonard; "I refused them, and would have secured
  him, but he escaped me at that time. I afterwards discovered him among the
  spectators near the fire, and caused his arrest."</p>

  <p>"And who is this villain?" cried the king.</p>

  <p>"I must refer your majesty to Lord Argentine," replied Leonard.</p>

  <p>"Do you know anything of the transaction, my lord?" said Charles,
  appealing to him.</p>

  <p>"Not I, your majesty," said Argentine, vainly endeavouring to conceal his
  anger and confusion. "The knave has spoken falsely."</p>

  <p>"He shall rue it, if he has done so," rejoined the monarch. "What has the
  man you speak of to do with Lord Argentine?" he added to Leonard.</p>

  <p>"He is his father," was the reply.</p>

  <p>Charles looked at Lord Argentine, and became convinced from the altered
  expression of his countenance that the truth had been spoken. He, therefore,
  arose, and motioning him to follow him, led him into the recess of a window,
  where they remained in conversation for some minutes. While this was passing,
  the Earl of Rochester observed, in an undertone to Leonard, "You have made a
  mortal foe of Lord Argentine, but I will protect you."</p>

  <p>"I require no other protection than I can afford myself, my lord,"
  rejoined Leonard, coldly.</p>

  <p>Shortly after this, Charles stepped forward with a graver aspect than
  before, and said, "Before proceeding to view this conflagration, I must give
  some directions in reference to it. To you, my Lord Craven, whose intrepidity
  I well know, I intrust the most important post. You will station yourself at
  the east of the conflagration, and if you find it making its way to the
  Tower, as I hear is the case, check it at all hazards. The old fortress must
  be preserved at any risk. But do not resort to gunpowder unless you receive
  an order from me accompanied by my signet-ring. My Lords Hollis and Ashley,
  you will have the care of the north-west of the city. Station yourselves near
  Newgate Market. Rochester and Arlington, your posts will be at Saint Paul's.
  Watch over the august cathedral. I would not have it injured for half my
  kingdom. Brother," he added to the Duke of York, "you will accompany me in my
  barge&mdash;and you, Mr. Pepys. You, young man," to Leonard, "can follow in
  my train."</p>

  <p>"Has your majesty no post for me?" asked Argentine.</p>

  <p>"No," replied Charles, turning coldly from him.</p>

  <p>"Had not your majesty better let him have the custody of your gaol of
  Newgate?" remarked Rochester, sarcastically; "he has an interest in its safe
  keeping."</p>

  <p>Lord Argentine turned deadly pale, but he made no answer. Attended by the
  Duke of York and Mr. Pepys, and followed at a respectful distance by Leonard,
  the king then passed through the ante-room, and descending the grand
  staircase, traversed a variety of passages, until he reached the private
  stairs communicating with the river. At the foot lay the royal barge, in
  which he embarked with his train. Charles appeared greatly moved by the sight
  of the thousands of his houseless subjects, whom he encountered in his
  passage down the Thames, and whenever a feeble shout was raised for him, he
  returned it with a blessing. When nearly opposite Queenhithe, he commanded
  the rowers to pause. The conflagration had made formidable progress since
  Leonard' beheld it a few hours back, and had advanced, nearly as far as the
  Still-yard on the river-side, while it was burning upwards through thick
  ranks of houses, almost as far as Cannon-street. The roaring of the flames
  was louder than ever&mdash;and the crash of falling habitations, and the
  tumult and cries of the affrighted populace, yet more terrific.</p>

  <p>Charles gazed at the appalling spectacle like one who could not believe
  his senses, and it was some time before the overwhelming truth could force
  itself upon him. Tears then started to his eyes, and, uttering an ejaculation
  of despair, he commanded the rowers to make instantly for the shore.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch6-5"
     name="ch6-5">V. &mdash; HOW LEONARD SAVED THE KING'S LIFE.</a></h2>

  <p>The royal barge landed at Queenhithe, and Charles instantly disembarking,
  proceeded on foot, and at a pace that compelled, his attendants to move
  quickly, to keep up with him, to Thames-street. Here, however, the confusion
  was so great, owing to the rush of people, and the number of vehicles
  employed in the removal of goods, that he was obliged to come to a halt.
  Fortunately, at this moment, a company of the train-bands rode up, and their
  leader dismounting, offered his horse to the king, who instantly sprang into
  the saddle, and scarcely waiting till the Duke of York could be similarly
  accommodated, forced his way through the crowd as far as Brewer-lane, where
  his progress was stopped by the intense heat. A little more than a hundred
  yards from this point, the whole street was on fire, and the flames bursting
  from the windows and roofs of the houses, with a roar like that which might
  be supposed to be produced by the forges of the Cyclops, united in a vast
  blazing arch overhead. It chanced, too, that in some places cellars filled
  with combustible materials extended under the street, and here the ground
  would crack, and jets of fire shoot forth like the eruption of a volcano. The
  walls and timbers of the houses at some distance from the conflagration were
  scorched and blistered with the heat, and completely prepared for ignition;
  overhead being a vast and momentarily increasing cloud of flame-coloured
  smoke, which spread all over the city, filling it as with a thick mist, while
  the glowing vault above looked, as Evelyn expresses it, "like the top of a
  burning oven."</p>

  <p>Two churches, namely, Allhallows the Great and Allhallows the Less, were
  burnt down in the king's sight, and the lofty spire of a third, Saint
  Lawrence Poulteney, had just caught fire, and looked like a flame-tipped
  spear. After contemplating this spectacle for some time, Charles roused
  himself from the state of stupefaction into which he was thrown, and
  determined, if possible, to arrest the further progress of the devouring
  element along the river-side, commanded all the houses on the west of Dowgate
  Dock to be instantly demolished. A large body of men were therefore set upon
  this difficult and dangerous, and, as it proved, futile task. Another party
  were ordered to the same duty on Dowgate-hill; and the crash of tumbling
  walls and beams was soon added to the general uproar, while clouds of dust
  darkened the air. It was with some difficulty that a sufficient space could
  be kept clear for carrying these operations into effect; and long before they
  were half-completed, Charles had the mortification of finding the fire
  gaining ground so rapidly, that they must prove ineffectual. Word was brought
  at this juncture that a fresh fire had broken out in Elbow-lane, and while
  the monarch was listening to this dreary intelligence, a fearful cry was
  heard near the river, followed, the next moment, by a tumultuous rush of
  persons from that quarter. The fire, as if in scorn, had leapt across Dowgate
  Dock, and seizing upon the half-demolished houses, instantly made them its
  prey. The rapidity with which the conflagration proceeded was astounding, and
  completely baffled all attempts to check it. The wind continued blowing as
  furiously as ever, nor was there the slightest prospect of its abatement. All
  the king's better qualities were called into play by the present terrible
  crisis. With a courage and devotion that he seldom displayed, he exposed
  himself to the greatest risk, personally assisting at all the operations he
  commanded; while his humane attention to the sufferers by the calamity almost
  reconciled them to their deplorable situation. His movements were almost as
  rapid as those of the fire itself. Riding up Cannon-street, and from thence
  by Sweeting's-lane, to Lombard-street, and so on by Fenchurch-street to
  Tower-street, he issued directions all the way, checking every disturbance,
  and causing a band of depredators, who had broken into the house of a wealthy
  goldsmith, to be carried off to Newgate. Arrived in Tower-street, he found
  the Earl of Craven and his party stationed a little beyond Saint Dunstan's in
  the East.</p>

  <p>All immediate apprehensions in this quarter appeared at an end. The church
  had been destroyed, as before mentioned, but several houses in its vicinity
  having been demolished, the fire had not extended eastward. Satisfied that
  the Tower was in no immediate danger, the king retraced his course, and
  encountering the lord mayor in Lombard-street, sharply reproved him for his
  want of zeal and discretion.</p>

  <p>"I do not deserve your majesty's reproaches," replied the lord mayor.
  "Ever since the fire broke out I have not rested an instant, and am almost
  worn to death with anxiety and fatigue. I am just returned from Guildhall,
  where a vast quantity of plate belonging to the city companies has been
  deposited. Lord! Lord! what a fire this is!"</p>

  <p>"You are chiefly to blame for its getting so much ahead," replied the
  king, angrily. "Had you adopted vigorous measures at the outset, it might
  have easily been got under. I hear no water was to be obtained. How was
  that?"</p>

  <p>"It is a damnable plot, your majesty, designed by the Papists, or the
  Dutch, or the French&mdash;I don't know which&mdash;perhaps all three,"
  rejoined the lord mayor; "and it appears that the cocks of all the pipes at
  the waterworks at Islington were turned, while the pipes and conduits in the
  city were empty. This is no accidental fire, your majesty."</p>

  <p>"So I find," replied the king; "but it will be time enough to inquire into
  its origin hereafter. Meantime, we must act, and energetically, or we shall
  be equally as much to blame as the incendiaries. Let a proclamation be made,
  enjoining all those persons who have been driven from their homes by the fire
  to proceed, with such effects as they have preserved, to Moorfields, where
  their wants shall be cared for."</p>

  <p>"It shall be made instantly, your majesty," replied the lord mayor.</p>

  <p>"Your next business will be to see to the removal of all the wealth from
  the goldsmiths' houses in this street, and in Gracechurch-street, to some
  places of security, Guildhall, or the Royal Exchange, for instance,"
  continued the king.</p>

  <p>"Your majesty's directions shall be implicitly obeyed," replied the lord
  mayor.</p>

  <p>"You will then pull down all the houses to the east of the fire," pursued
  the king. "Get all the men you can muster; and never relax your exertions
  till you have made a wide and clear breach between the flames and their
  prey."</p>

  <p>"I will&mdash;I will, your majesty," groaned the lord mayor.</p>

  <p>"About it, then," rejoined the king; and striking spurs into his horse, he
  rode off with his train.</p>

  <p>He now penetrated one of the narrow alleys leading to the Three Cranes in
  the Vintry, where he ascended to the roof of the habitation, that he might
  view the fire. He saw that it was making such rapid advances towards him,
  that it must very soon reach the building on which he stood, and, half
  suffocated with the smoke, and scorched with the fire-drops, he
  descended.</p>

  <p>Not long after this, Waterman's Hall was discovered to be on fire; and,
  stirred by the sight, Charles made fresh efforts to check the progress of the
  conflagration by demolishing more houses. So eagerly did he occupy himself in
  the task, that his life had well-nigh fallen a sacrifice to his zeal. He was
  standing below a building which the workmen were unroofing, when all at once
  the whole of the upper part of the wall gave way, dragging several heavy
  beams with it, and would have infallibly crushed him, if Leonard, who was
  stationed behind him, had not noticed the circumstance, and rushing forward
  with the greatest promptitude, dragged him out of harm's way. An engineer,
  with whom the king was conversing at the time of the accident, was buried in
  the ruins, and when taken out was found fearfully mutilated and quite dead.
  Both Charles and his preserver were covered with dust and rubbish, and
  Leonard received a severe blow on the shoulder from a falling brick.</p>

  <p>On recovering from the shock, which for some moments deprived him of the
  power of speech, Charles inquired for his deliverer, and, on being shown him,
  said, with a look of surprise and pleasure, "What, is it you, young man? I am
  glad of it. Depend, upon it, I shall not forget the important service you
  have rendered me."</p>

  <p>"If he remembers it, it will be the first time he has ever so exercised
  his memory," observed Chiffinch, in a loud whisper to Leonard. "I advise you,
  as a friend, not to let his gratitude cool."</p>

  <p>Undeterred by this late narrow escape, Charles ordered fresh houses to be
  demolished, and stimulated the workmen to exertion by his personal
  superintendence of their operations. He commanded Leonard to keep constantly
  near him, laughingly observing, "I shall feel safe while you are by. You have
  a better eye for a falling house than any of my attendants."</p>

  <p>Worn out at length with fatigue, Charles proceeded, with the Duke of York
  and his immediate attendants, to Painters' Hall, in little Trinity-lane, in
  quest of refreshment, where a repast was hastily prepared for him, and he sat
  down to it with an appetite such as the most magnificent banquet could not,
  under other circumstances, have provoked. His hunger satisfied, he despatched
  messengers to command the immediate attendance of the lord mayor, the
  sheriffs, and aldermen; and when they arrived, he thus addressed
  them:&mdash;"My lord mayor and gentlemen, it has been recommended to me by
  this young man," pointing to Leonard, "that the sole way of checking the
  further progress of this disastrous conflagration, which threatens the total
  destruction of our city, will be by blowing up the houses with gunpowder, so
  as to form a wide gap between the flames and the habitations yet remaining
  unseized. This plan will necessarily involve great destruction of property,
  and may, notwithstanding all the care that can be adopted, be attended with
  some loss of life; but I conceive it will be effectual. Before ordering it,
  however, to be put into execution, I desire to learn your opinion of it. How
  say you, my lord mayor and gentlemen? Does the plan meet with your
  approbation?"</p>

  <p>"I pray your majesty to allow me to confer for a moment with my brethren,"
  replied the lord mayor, cautiously, "before I return an answer. It is too
  serious a matter to decide upon at once."</p>

  <p>"Be it so," replied the king.</p>

  <p>And the civic authorities withdrew with the king. Leonard heard, though he
  did not dare to remark upon it, that the Duke of York leaned forward as the
  lord mayor passed him, and whispered in his ear, "Take heed what you do. He
  only desires to shift the responsibility of the act from his own shoulders to
  yours."</p>

  <p>"If they assent," said the king to Leonard, "I will place you at the head
  of a party of engineers."</p>

  <p>"I beseech your majesty neither to regard me nor them," replied Leonard.
  "Use the authority it has pleased Heaven to bestow upon you for the
  preservation of the city, and think and act for yourself, or you will
  assuredly regret your want of decision. It has been my fortune, with the
  assistance of God, to be the humble instrument of accomplishing your
  majesty's deliverance from peril, and I have your royal word that you will
  not forget it."</p>

  <p>"Nor will I," cried the king, hastily.</p>

  <p>"Then suffer the petition I now make to you to prevail," cried Leonard,
  falling on his knees. "Be not influenced by the opinion of the lord mayor and
  his brethren, whose own interests may lead them to oppose the plan; but, if
  you think well of it, instantly adopt it."</p>

  <p>Charles looked irresolute, but might have yielded, if the Duke of York had
  not stepped forward. "Your majesty had better not act too precipitately,"
  said the duke. "Listen to the counsels of your prudent advisers. A false step
  in such a case will be irretrievable."</p>

  <p>"Nay, brother," rejoined the king, "I see no particular risk in it, after
  all, and I incline towards the young man's opinion."</p>

  <p>"At least, hear what they have got to say," rejoined the duke. "And here
  they come. They have not been long in deliberation."</p>

  <p>"The result of it may be easily predicted," said Leonard, rising.</p>

  <p>As Leonard had foreseen, the civic authorities were adverse to the plan.
  The lord mayor in the name of himself and his brethren, earnestly solicited
  the king to postpone the execution of his order till all other means of
  checking the progress of the conflagration had been tried, and till such
  time, at least, as the property of the owners of the houses to be destroyed
  could be removed. He further added, that it was the unanimous opinion of
  himself and his brethren, that the plan was fraught with great peril to the
  safety of the citizens, and that they could not bring themselves to assent to
  it. If, therefore, his majesty chose to adopt it, they must leave the
  responsibility with him.</p>

  <p>"I told your majesty how it would be," observed the Duke of York,
  triumphantly.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to find you are right, brother," replied the king, frowning.
  "We are overruled, you see, friend," he added to Leonard.</p>

  <p>"Your majesty has signed the doom of your city," rejoined Leonard,
  mournfully.</p>

  <p>"I trust not&mdash;I trust not," replied Charles, hastily, and with an
  uneasy shrug of the shoulder. "Fail not to remind me when all is over of the
  obligation I am under to you."</p>

  <p>"Your majesty has refused the sole boon I desired to have granted,"
  rejoined Leonard.</p>

  <p>"And do you not see the reason, friend?" returned the king. "These worthy
  and wealthy citizens desire to remove their property. Their arguments are
  unanswerable. I <i>must</i> give them time to do it. But we waste time here,"
  he added, rising. "Remember," to Leonard, "my debt is not discharged. And I
  command you, on pain of my sovereign displeasure, not to omit to claim its
  payment."</p>

  <p>"I will enter it in my memorandum-book, and will put your majesty in mind
  of it at the fitting season," observed Chiffinch, who had taken a great fancy
  to Leonard.</p>

  <p>The king smiled good-humouredly, and quitting the hall with his
  attendants, proceeded to superintend the further demolition of houses. He
  next visited all the posts, saw that the different noblemen were at their
  appointed stations, and by his unremitting exertions, contrived to restore
  something like order to the tumultuous streets. Thousands of men were now
  employed in different quarters in pulling down houses, and the most powerful
  engines of war were employed in the work. The confusion that attended these
  proceedings is indescribable. The engineers and workmen wrought in clouds of
  dust and smoke, and the crash of falling timber and walls was deafening. In a
  short time, the upper part of Cornhill was rendered wholly impassable, owing
  to the heaps of rubbish; and directions were given to the engineers to
  proceed to the Poultry, and demolish the houses as far as the Conduit in
  Cheapside, by which means it was hoped that the Royal Exchange would be
  saved.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, all the wealthy goldsmiths and merchants in Lombard-street and
  Gracechurch-street had been actively employed in removing all their money,
  plate, and goods, to places of security. A vast quantity was conveyed to
  Guildhall, as has been stated, and the rest to different churches and halls
  remote from the scene of conflagration. But in spite of all their caution,
  much property was carried off by the depredators, and amongst others by
  Chowles and Judith, who contrived to secure a mass of plate, gold, and
  jewels, that satisfied even their rapacious souls. While this was passing in
  the heart of the burning city, vast crowds were streaming out of its gates,
  and encamping themselves, in pursuance of the royal injunction, in Finsbury
  Fields and Spitalfields. Others crossed the water to Southwark, and took
  refuge in Saint George's Fields; and it was a sad and touching sight to see
  all these families collected without shelter or food, most of whom a few
  hours before were in possession of all the comforts of life, but were now
  reduced to the condition of beggars.</p>

  <p>To return to the conflagration:&mdash;While one party continued to labour
  incessantly at the work of demolition, and ineffectually sought to quench the
  flames, by bringing a few engines to play upon them,&mdash;a scanty supply of
  water having now been obtained&mdash;the fire, disdaining such puny
  opposition, and determined to show its giant strength, leaped over all the
  breaches, drove the water-carriers back, compelled them to relinquish their
  buckets, and to abandon their engines, which it made its prey, and seizing
  upon the heaps of timber and other fragments occasioned by the demolition,
  consumed them, and marched onwards with furious exultation. It was now
  proceeding up Gracechurch-street, Saint Clement's-lane, Nicholas-lane, and
  Abchurch-lane at the same time, destroying all in its course. The whole of
  Lombard-street was choked up with the ruins and rubbish of demolished houses,
  through which thousands of persons were toiling to carry off goods, either
  for the purpose of assistance or of plunder. The king was at the west end of
  the street, near the church of Saint Mary Woolnoth, and the fearful havoc and
  destruction going forward drew tears from his eyes. A scene of greater
  confusion cannot be imagined. Leonard was in the midst of it, and, careless
  of his own safety, toiled amid the tumbling fragments of the houses to rescue
  some article of value for its unfortunate owner. While he was thus employed,
  he observed a man leap out of a window of a partly demolished house,
  disclosing in the action that he had a casket concealed under his cloak.</p>

  <p>A second glance showed him that this individual was Pillichody, and
  satisfied that he had been plundering the house, he instantly seized him. The
  bully struggled violently, but at last, dropping the casket, made his escape,
  vowing to be revenged. Leonard laughed at his threats, and the next moment
  had the satisfaction of restoring the casket to its rightful owner, an old
  merchant, who issued from the house, and who, after thanking him, told him it
  contained jewels of immense value.</p>

  <p>Not half an hour after this, the flames poured upon Lombard-street from
  the four avenues before mentioned, and the whole neighbourhood was on fire.
  With inconceivable rapidity, they then ran up Birchin-lane, and reaching
  Cornhill, spread to the right and left in that great thoroughfare. The
  conflagration had now reached the highest point of the city, and presented
  the grandest and most terrific aspect it had yet assumed from the river. Thus
  viewed, it appeared, as Pepys describes it, "as an entire arch of fire from
  the Three Cranes to the other side of the bridge, and in a bow up the hill,
  for an arch of above a mile long: <i>it made me weep to see it</i>." Vincent
  also likens its appearance at this juncture to that of a bow. "A dreadful bow
  it was," writes this eloquent nonconformist preacher, "such as mine eyes have
  never before seen; a bow which had God's arrow in it with a flaming point; a
  shining bow, not like that in the cloud which brings water with it, and
  withal signifieth God's covenant not to destroy the world any more with
  water, but a bow having fire in it, and signifying God's anger, and his
  intention to destroy London with fire."</p>

  <p>As the day drew to a close, and it became darker, the spectacle increased
  in terror and sublimity. The tall black towers of the churches assumed
  ghastly forms, and to some eyes appeared like infernal spirits plunging in a
  lake of flame, while even to the most reckless the conflagration seemed to
  present a picture of the terrors of the Last Day. Never before had such a
  night as that which ensued fallen upon London. None of its inhabitants
  thought of retiring to rest, or if they sought repose after the excessive
  fatigue they had undergone, it was only in such manner as would best enable
  them to rise and renew their exertions to check the flames, which were
  continued throughout the night, but wholly without success. The conflagration
  appeared to proceed at the same appalling rapidity. Halls, towers, churches,
  public and private buildings, were burning to the number of more than ten
  thousand, while clouds of smoke covered the vast expanse of more than fifty
  miles. Travellers approaching London from the north-east were enveloped in it
  ten miles off, and the fiery reflection in the sky could be discerned at an
  equal distance. The "hideous storm," as Evelyn terms the fearful and
  astounding noise produced by the roaring of the flames and the falling of the
  numerous fabrics, continued without intermission during the whole of that
  fatal night.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch6-6"
     name="ch6-6">VI. &mdash; HOW THE GROCER'S HOUSE WAS BURNT.</a></h2>

  <p>It was full ten o'clock before Leonard could obtain permission to quit the
  king's party, and he immediately hurried to Wood-street. He had scarcely
  entered it, when the cry of "fire" smote his ears, and rushing forward in an
  agony of apprehension, he beheld Mr. Bloundel's dwelling in flames. A large
  crowd was collected before the burning habitation, keeping guard over a vast
  heap of goods and furniture that had been removed from it.</p>

  <p>So much beloved was Mr. Bloundel, and in such high estimation was his
  character held, that all his neighbours, on learning that his house was on
  fire, flew to his assistance, and bestirred themselves so actively, that in
  an extraordinary short space of time they had emptied the house of every
  article of value, and placed it out of danger in the street. In vain the
  grocer urged them to desist: his entreaties were disregarded by his zealous
  friends; and when he told them they were profaning the Sabbath, they replied
  that the responsibility of their conduct would rest entirely on themselves,
  and they hoped they might never have anything worse to answer for. In spite
  of his disapproval of what was done, the grocer could not but be sensibly
  touched by their devotion, and as to his wife, she said, with tears in her
  eyes, that "it was almost worth while having a fire to prove what good
  friends they had."</p>

  <p>It was at this juncture that Leonard arrived. Way was instantly made for
  him, and leaping over the piles of chests and goods that blocked up the
  thoroughfare, he flew to Mr. Bloundel, who was standing in front of his
  flaming habitation with as calm and unmoved an expression of countenance as
  if nothing was happening, and presently ascertained from him in what manner
  the fire had originated. It appeared that while the whole of the family were
  assembled at prayers, in the room ordinarily used for that purpose, they were
  alarmed at supper by a strong smell of smoke, which seemed to arise from the
  lower part of the house, and that as soon as their devotions were ended, for
  Mr. Bloundel would not allow them to stir before, Stephen and Blaize had
  proceeded to ascertain the cause, and on going down to the kitchen, found a
  dense smoke issuing from the adjoining cellar, the door of which stood ajar.
  Hearing a noise in the yard, they darted up the back steps, communicating
  with the cellar, and discovered a man trying to make his escape over the wall
  by a rope-ladder. Stephen instantly seized him, and the man, drawing a sword,
  tried to free himself from his captor. In the struggle, he dropped a pistol,
  which Blaize snatching up, discharged with fatal effect against the wretch,
  who, on examination, proved to be Pillichody.</p>

  <p>Efforts were made to check the fire, but in vain. The villain had
  accomplished his diabolical purpose too well. Acquainted with the premises,
  and with the habits of the family, he had got into the yard by means of a
  rope-ladder, and hiding himself till the servants were summoned to prayers,
  stole into the cellar, and placing a fire-ball amid a heap of fagots and
  coals, and near several large casks of oil, and other inflammable matters,
  struck a light, and set fire to it.</p>

  <p>"I shall ever reproach myself that I was away when this calamity
  occurred," observed Leonard, as the grocer brought his relation to an
  end.</p>

  <p>"Then you will do so without reason," replied Mr. Bloundel, "for you could
  have rendered no assistance, and you see my good neighbours have taken the
  matter entirely out of my hands."</p>

  <p>"Whither do you intend removing, sir?" rejoined Leonard. "If I might
  suggest, I would advise you to go to Farmer Wingfield's, at Kensal
  Green."</p>

  <p>"You have anticipated my intention," replied the grocer; "but we must now
  obtain some vehicles to transport these goods thither."</p>

  <p>"Be that my part," replied Leonard. And in a short space of time he had
  procured half a dozen large carts, into which the whole of the goods were
  speedily packed, and a coach having been likewise fetched by Blaize, Mrs.
  Bloundel and the three younger children, together with old Josyna and
  Patience, were placed in it.</p>

  <p>"I hope your mother has taken care of her money," whispered the latter to
  the porter, as he assisted her into the vehicle.</p>

  <p>"Never mind whether she has or not," rejoined Blaize, in the same tone;
  "we shan't want it. I am now as rich as my master&mdash;perhaps richer. On
  stripping that rascal Pillichody, I found a large bag of gold, besides
  several caskets of jewels, upon him, all of which I consider lawful spoil, as
  he fell by my hand."</p>

  <p>"To be sure," rejoined Patience. "I dare say he did not come very honestly
  by the treasures, but you can't help that, you know."</p>

  <p>Blaize made no reply, but pushing her into the coach, shut the door. All
  being now in readiness, directions were given to the drivers of the carts
  whither to proceed, and they were put in motion. At this moment the grocer's
  firmness deserted him. Gazing at the old habitation, which was now wrapped in
  a sheet of flame, he cried in a voice broken with emotion, "In that house I
  have dwelt nearly thirty years&mdash;in that house all my children were
  born&mdash;in that house I found a safe refuge from the devouring pestilence.
  It is hard to quit it thus."</p>

  <p>Controlling his emotion, however, the next moment, he turned away. But his
  feelings were destined to another trial. His neighbours flocked round him to
  bid him farewell, in tones of such sympathy and regard, that his constancy
  again deserted him.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, thank you," he cried, pressing in turn each hand that was
  offered him. "Your kindness will never be effaced from my memory. God bless
  you all, and may He watch over you and protect you!" and with these words he
  broke from them. So great was the crowd and confusion in Cheapside, that
  nearly two hours elapsed before they reached Newgate; and, indeed, if it had
  not been for the interference of the Earl of Rochester, they would not, in
  all probability, have got out of the city at all. The earl was stationed near
  the Old 'Change, at the entrance to Saint Paul's Churchyard, and learning
  their distress, ordered a party of the guard by whom he was attended to force
  a passage for them. Both Mr. Bloundel and Leonard would have declined this
  assistance if they had had the power of doing so, but there was no help in
  the present case.</p>

  <p>They encountered no further difficulties, but were necessarily compelled
  to proceed at a slow pace, and did not reach Paddington for nearly two hours,
  being frequently stopped by persons eagerly asking as to the progress of the
  fire. One circumstance struck the whole party as remarkable. Such was the
  tremendous glare of the conflagration, that even at this distance the fire
  seemed close beside them, and if they had not known the contrary, they would
  have thought it could not be further off than Saint Giles's. The whole
  eastern sky in that direction seemed on fire, and glowed through the clouds
  of yellow smoke with which the air was filled with fearful splendour. After
  halting for a short time at the Wheat Sheaf, which they found
  open,&mdash;for, indeed, no house was closed that night,&mdash;to obtain some
  refreshment, and allay the intolerable thirst by which they were tormented,
  the party pursued their journey along the Harrow-road, and in due time
  approached Wingfield's residence.</p>

  <p>The honest farmer, who, with his wife and two of his men, was standing in
  a field at the top of the hill, gazing at the conflagration, hearing the
  noise occasioned by the carts, ran to the road-side to see what was coming,
  and encountered Mr. Bloundel and Leonard, who had walked up the ascent a
  little more quickly than the others.</p>

  <p>"I have been thinking of you," he said, after a cordial greeting had
  passed between them, "and wondering what would become of you in this dreadful
  fire. Nay, I had just told my dame I should go and look after you, and see
  whether I could be of any service to you. Well, I should be better pleased to
  see you in any way but this, though you could not be welcomer. I have room in
  the barn and outhouses for all you have brought, and hope and trust you have
  not lost much."</p>

  <p>"I have lost nothing except the old house," replied the grocer, heaving a
  sigh.</p>

  <p>"Another will soon be built," rejoined Wingfield, "and till that is done
  you shall not quit mine."</p>

  <p>The coach having by this time arrived, Wingfield hastened towards it, and
  assisted its occupants to alight. Mrs. Bloundel was warmly welcomed by Dame
  Wingfield, and being taken with her children to the house, was truly happy to
  find herself under the shelter of its hospitable roof. The rest of the party,
  assisted by Wingfield and his men, exerting themselves to the utmost, the
  carts were speedily unloaded, and the goods deposited in the barns and
  outhouses. This done, the drivers were liberally rewarded for their trouble
  by Mr. Bloundel, and after draining several large jugs of ale brought them by
  the farmer, made the best of their way back, certain of obtaining further
  employment during the night.</p>

  <p>Fatigued as he was, Leonard, before retiring to rest, could not help
  lingering on the brow of the hill to gaze at the burning city. The same
  effect was observable here as at Paddington, and the conflagration appeared
  little more than a mile off. The whole heavens seemed on fire, and a distant
  roar was heard like the rush of a high wind through a mighty forest.
  Westminster Abbey and Saint Paul's could be distinctly seen in black relief
  against the sheet of flame, together with innumerable towers, spires, and
  other buildings, the whole constituting a picture unsurpassed for terrific
  grandeur since the world began, and only to be equalled by its final
  destruction.</p>

  <p>Having gazed at the conflagration for some time, and fancied that he could
  even at this distance discern the fearful progress it made, Leonard retired
  to the barn, and throwing himself upon a heap of straw, instantly fell
  asleep. He was awakened the next morning by Farmer Wingfield, who came to
  tell him breakfast was ready, and having performed his ablutions, they
  adjourned to the house. Finding Mr. Bloundel comfortably established in his
  new quarters, Leonard proposed as soon as breakfast was over to proceed to
  town, and Wingfield volunteered to accompany him. Blaize, also, having placed
  his treasures, except a few pieces of gold, in the custody of Patience,
  begged to make one of the party, and his request being acceded to, the trio
  set out on foot, and gleaning fresh particulars of the fearful progress of
  the fire, as they advanced, passed along Oxford-road, and crossing Holborn
  Bridge, on the western side of which they were now demolishing the houses,
  mounted Snow-hill, and passed through the portal of Newgate.</p>

  <p>Here they learnt that the whole of Wood-street was consumed, that the fire
  had spread eastward as far as Gutter-lane, and that Saint Michael's Church,
  adjoining Wood-street, Goldsmiths' Hall, and the church of Saint John
  Zachary, were in flames. They were also told that the greater part of
  Cheapside was on fire, and wholly impassable&mdash;while the destructive
  element was invading at one and the same time Guildhall and the Royal
  Exchange. They furthermore learnt that the conflagration had spread fearfully
  along the side of the river, had passed Queenhithe, consuming all the wharves
  and warehouses in its way, and having just destroyed Paul's Wharf, was at
  that time assailing Baynard's Castle. This intelligence determined them not
  to attempt to proceed further into the city, which they saw was wholly
  impracticable; and they accordingly turned down Ivy-lane, and approached the
  cathedral with the intention, if possible, of ascending the central tower.
  They found a swarm of booksellers' porters and assistants at the northern
  entrance, engaged in transporting immense bales of books and paper to the
  vaults in Saint Faith's, where it was supposed the stock would be in safety,
  permission to that effect having been obtained from the dean and chapter.</p>

  <p>Forcing their way through this crowd, Leonard and his companions crossed
  the transept, and proceeded towards the door of the spiral staircase leading
  to the central tower. It was open, and they passed through it. On reaching
  the summit of the tower, which they found occupied by some dozen or twenty
  persons, a spectacle that far exceeded the utmost stretch of their
  imaginations burst upon them. Through clouds of tawny smoke scarcely
  distinguishable from flame, so thickly were they charged with sparks and
  fire-flakes, they beheld a line of fire spreading along Cheapside and
  Cornhill, as far as the Royal Exchange, which was now in flames, and
  branching upwards in another line through Lawrence-lane to Guildhall, which
  was likewise burning. Nearer to them, on the north, the fire kindled by the
  wretched Pillichody, who only, perhaps, anticipated the work of destruction
  by a few hours, had, as they had heard, proceeded to Goldsmiths' Hall, and
  was rapidly advancing down Saint Ann's-lane to Aldersgate. But it was on the
  right, and to the south-east, that the conflagration assumed its most
  terrific aspect. There, from Bow Church to the river-side, beyond the bridge
  as far as Billingsgate, and from thence up Mincing-lane, crossing
  Fenchurch-street and Lime-street to Gracechurch and Cornhill, describing a
  space of more than two miles in length and one in depth, every habitation was
  on fire. The appearance of this bed of flame was like an ocean of fire
  agitated by a tempest, in which a number of barks were struggling, some of
  them being each moment engulfed. The stunning and unearthly roar of the
  flames aided this appearance, which was further heightened by the enormous
  billows of flame that ever and anon rolled tumultuously onward as they were
  caught by some gust of wind of more than usual violence. The spires of the
  churches looked like the spars of "tall admirals," that had foundered, while
  the blackening ruins of the halls and larger buildings well represented the
  ribs and beams of mighty hulks.</p>

  <p>Leaving Leonard and his companions to the contemplation of this tremendous
  spectacle, we shall proceed to take a nearer view of its ravages. Every
  effort had been used to preserve the Royal Exchange by the city authorities,
  and by the engineers, headed by the king in person. All the buildings in its
  vicinity were demolished. But in vain. The irresistible and unrelenting foe
  drove the defenders back as before, seized upon their barricades, and used
  them, like a skilful besieger, against the fortress they sought to protect.
  Solomon Eagle, who was mounted upon a heap of ruins, witnessed this scene of
  destruction, and uttered a laugh of exultation as the flames seized upon
  their prey.</p>

  <p>"I told you," he cried, "that the extortioners and usurers who resorted to
  that building, and made gold their god, would be driven forth, and their
  temple destroyed. And my words have come to pass. It burns&mdash;it
  burns&mdash;and so shall they, if they turn not from their ways."</p>

  <p>Hearing this wild speech, and beholding the extraordinary figure of the
  enthusiast, whose scorched locks and smoke-begrimed limbs gave him almost the
  appearance of an infernal spirit, the king inquired, with some trepidation,
  from his attendants, who or what he was, and being informed, ordered them to
  seize him. But the enthusiast set their attempts at naught. Springing with
  wonderful agility from fragment to fragment of the ruins, and continuing his
  vociferations, he at last plunged through the flame into the Exchange itself,
  rendering further pursuit, of course, impossible, unless those who desired to
  capture him, were determined to share his fate, which now seemed inevitable.
  To the astonishment of all, however, he appeared a few minutes afterwards on
  the roof of the blazing pile, and continued his denunciations till driven
  away by the flames. He seemed, indeed, to bear a charmed life, for it was
  rumoured&mdash;though the report was scarcely credited&mdash;that he had
  escaped from the burning building, and made good his retreat to Saint Paul's.
  Soon after this, the Exchange was one mass of flame. Having gained an
  entrance to the galleries, the fire ran round them with inconceivable
  swiftness, as was the case in the conflagration of this later structure, and
  filling every chamber, gushed out of the windows, and poured down upon the
  courts and walks below. Fearful and prodigious was the ruin that ensued. The
  stone walls cracked with the intense heat&mdash;tottered and fell&mdash;the
  pillars shivered and broke asunder, the statues dropped from their niches,
  and were destroyed, one only surviving the wreck&mdash;that of the
  illustrious founder, Sir Thomas Gresham.</p>

  <p>Deploring the fate of the Royal Exchange, the king and his attendants
  proceeded to Guildhall. But here they were too late, nor could they even
  rescue a tithe of the plate and valuables lodged within it for security. The
  effects of the fire as displayed in this structure, were singularly grand and
  surprising. The greater part of the ancient fabric being composed of oak of
  the hardest kind, it emitted little flame, but became after a time red hot,
  and remained in this glowing state till night, when it resembled, as an
  eye-witness describes, "a mighty palace of gold, or a great building of
  burnished brass."</p>

  <p>The greatest fury of the conflagration was displayed at the Poultry, where
  five distinct fires met, and united their forces&mdash;one which came roaring
  down Cornhill from the Royal Exchange&mdash;a second down
  Threadneedle-street&mdash;a third up Walbrook&mdash;a fourth along
  Bucklersbury&mdash;and a fifth that marched against the wind up Cheapside,
  all these uniting, as at a focus, a whirl of flame, an intensity of heat, and
  a thundering roar were produced, such as were nowhere else experienced.</p>

  <p>To return to the party on the central tower of the
  cathedral:&mdash;Stunned and half stifled by the roar and smoke, Leonard and
  his companions descended from their lofty post, and returned to the body of
  the fane. They were about to issue forth, when Leonard, glancing down the
  northern aisle, perceived the Earl of Rochester and Lord Argentine standing
  together at the lower end of it. Their gestures showed that it was not an
  amicable meeting, and mindful of what had passed at Whitehall, Leonard
  resolved to abide the result. Presently, he saw Lord Argentine turn sharply
  round, and strike his companion in the face with his glove. The clash of
  swords instantly succeeded, and Leonard and Wingfield started forward to
  separate the combatants. Blaize, followed, but more cautiously, contenting
  himself with screaming at the top of his voice, "Murder! murder! sacrilege! a
  duel! a duel!"</p>

  <p>Wingfield was the first to arrive at the scene of strife, but just as he
  reached the combatants, who were too much blinded by passion to notice his
  approach, Lord Argentine struck his adversary's weapon from his grasp, and
  would have followed up the advantage if the farmer had not withheld his arm.
  Enraged at the interference, Argentine turned his fury against the newcomer,
  and strove to use his sword against him&mdash;but in the terrible struggle
  that ensued, and at the close of which they fell together, the weapon, as if
  directed by the hand of an avenging fate, passed through his own breast,
  inflicting a mortal wound.</p>

  <p>"Susan Wingfield is avenged!" said the farmer, as he arose, drenched in
  the blood of his opponent.</p>

  <p>"Susan Wingfield!" exclaimed the wounded man&mdash;"what was she to
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Much," replied the farmer. "She was my daughter."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" exclaimed Argentine, with an expression of unutterable anguish. "Let
  me have your forgiveness," he groaned.</p>

  <p>"You have it," replied Wingfield, kneeling beside him, "and may God pardon
  us both&mdash;you for the wrong you did my daughter, me for being
  accidentally the cause of your death. But I trust you are not mortally
  hurt?"</p>

  <p>"I have not many minutes to live," replied Argentine. "But is not that
  Leonard Holt?"</p>

  <p>"It is," said Rochester, stepping forward.</p>

  <p>"I can then do one rightful act before I die," he said, raising himself on
  one hand, and holding the other forcibly to his side, so as to stanch in some
  degree the effusion of blood. "Leonard Holt," he continued, "my sister
  Isabella loves you&mdash;deeply, devotedly. I have tried to conquer the
  passion, but in vain. You have my consent to wed her."</p>

  <p>"I am a witness to your words my lord," said Rochester, "and I call upon
  all present to be so likewise."</p>

  <p>"Rochester, you were once my friend," groaned Argentine, "and may yet be a
  friend to the dead. Remember the king sells titles. Teach this young man how
  to purchase one. My sister must not wed one of his degree."</p>

  <p>"Make yourself easy on that score," replied Rochester; "he has already
  sufficient claim upon the king. He saved his life yesterday."</p>

  <p>"He will trust to a broken reed if he trusts to Charles's gratitude,"
  replied Argentine. "Buy the title&mdash;<i>buy</i> it, I say. My sister left
  me yesterday. I visited my anger on her head, and she fled. I believe she
  took refuge with Doctor Hodges, but I am sure he can tell you where she is.
  One thing more," continued the dying man, fixing his glazing eyes on Leonard.
  "Go to Newgate&mdash;to&mdash;to a prisoner there&mdash;an
  incendiary&mdash;and obtain a document of him. Tell him, with my dying breath
  I charged you to do this. It will enable you to act as I have directed.
  Promise me you will go. Promise me you will fulfil my injunctions."</p>

  <p>"I do," replied Leonard.</p>

  <p>"Enough," rejoined Argentine. "May you be happy with Isabella." And
  removing his hand from his side, a copious effusion of blood followed, and,
  sinking backwards, he expired.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch6-7"
     name="ch6-7">VII. &mdash; THE BURNING OF SAINT PAUL'S.</a></h2>

  <p>Several other persons having by this time come up, the body of Lord
  Argentine was conveyed to Bishop Kempe's Chapel, and left there till a
  fitting season should arrive for its removal. Confounded by the tragical
  event that had taken place, Leonard remained with his eyes fixed upon the
  blood-stained pavement, until he was roused by an arm which gently drew him
  away, while the voice of the Earl of Rochester breathed in his ear, "This is
  a sad occurrence, Leonard; and yet it is most fortunate for you, for it
  removes the only obstacle to your union with the Lady Isabella. You see how
  fleeting life is, and how easily we may be deprived of it. I tried to reason
  Lord Argentine into calmness; but nothing would satisfy him except my blood;
  and there he lies, though not by my hand. Let his fate be a lesson to us, and
  teach us to live in charity with each other. I have wronged you&mdash;deeply
  wronged you; but I will make all the atonement in my power, and let me think
  I am forgiven."</p>

  <p>The blood rushed tumultuously to Leonard's heart as he listened to what
  the earl said, but overcoming his feelings of aversion by a powerful effort,
  he took the proffered hand.</p>

  <p>"I do forgive you my lord," he said.</p>

  <p>"Those words have removed a heavy weight from my soul," replied Rochester;
  "and if death should trip up my heels as suddenly as he did his who perished
  on this spot, I shall be better prepared to meet him. And now let me advise
  you to repair to Newgate without delay, and see the wretched man, and obtain
  the document from him. The fire will reach the gaol ere long, and the
  prisoners must of necessity be removed. Amid the confusion his escape might
  be easily accomplished."</p>

  <p>"Recollect, my lord, that the direful conflagration now prevailing without
  is owing to him," replied Leonard. "I will never be accessory to his
  escape."</p>

  <p>"And yet his death by the public executioner," urged Rochester. "Think of
  its effect on his daughter."</p>

  <p>"Justice must take its course," rejoined Leonard. "I would not aid him to
  escape if he were my own father."</p>

  <p>"In that case, nothing more is to be said," replied Rochester. "But at all
  events, see him as quickly as you can. I would accompany you, but my duty
  detains me here. When you return from your errand you will find me at my post
  near the entrance of the churchyard in front of Saint Michael's le Quern;
  that is, if I am not beaten from it. Having seen the father, your next
  business must be to seek out the daughter, and remove her from this dangerous
  neighbourhood. You have heard where she is to be found."</p>

  <p>Upon this they separated, Leonard and his companions quitting the
  cathedral by the great western entrance, and proceeding towards Paul's-alley,
  and the earl betaking himself to the north-east corner of the churchyard. The
  former got as far as Ivy-lane, but found it wholly impassable, in consequence
  of the goods and furniture with which it was blocked up. They were,
  therefore, obliged to return to the precincts of the cathedral, where Blaize,
  who was greatly terrified by what he had seen, expressed his determination of
  quitting them, and hurried back to the sacred pile. Leonard and the farmer
  next essayed to get up Ave Maria-lane; but, finding that also impassable,
  they made for Ludgate, and, after a long delay and severe struggle, got
  through the portal. The Old Bailey was entirely filled with persons removing
  their goods; and they were here informed, to their great dismay, that the
  conflagration had already reached Newgate Market, which was burning with the
  greatest fury, and was at that moment seizing upon the gaol. No one, however,
  in answer to Leonard's inquiries, could tell him what had become of the
  prisoners.</p>

  <p>"I suppose they have left them to burn," observed a bystander, who heard
  the question with a malicious look; "and it is the best way of getting rid of
  them." Paying no attention to the remark, nor to the brutal laugh
  accompanying it, Leonard, assisted by Wingfield, fought his way through the
  crowd till he reached the prison. The flames were bursting through its grated
  windows, and both wings, as well as the massive gate connecting them, were on
  fire. Regardless of the risk he ran, Leonard forced his way to the
  lodge-door, where two turnkeys were standing, removing their goods.</p>

  <p>"What has become of the prisoners?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"The debtors are set free," replied the turnkey addressed, "and all but
  one or two of the common felons are removed."</p>

  <p>"And where are those poor creatures?" cried Leonard, horror-stricken.</p>

  <p>"In the Stone Hold," replied the turnkey.</p>

  <p>"And have you left them to perish there?" demanded Leonard.</p>

  <p>"We couldn't help it," rejoined the turnkey. "It would have been risking
  our lives to venture near them. One is a murderer, taken in the fact; and the
  other is quite as bad, for he set the city on fire; so its right and fair he
  should perish by his own contrivance."</p>

  <p>"Where does the Stone Hold lie?" cried Leonard, in a tone that startled
  the turnkey. "I must get these prisoners out."</p>

  <p>"You can't, I tell you," rejoined the turnkey, doggedly. "They're burnt to
  a cinder by this time."</p>

  <p>"Give me your keys, and show me the way to the cell," cried Leonard,
  authoritatively. "I will at least attempt to save them."</p>

  <p>"Well, if you're determined to put an end to yourself, you may try,"
  replied the turnkey; "but I've warned you as to what you may expect. This
  way," he added, opening a door, from which a thick volume of smoke issued;
  "if any of 'em's alive, you'll soon know by the cries." And, as if in answer
  to his remark, a most terrific shriek at that moment burst on their ears.</p>

  <p>"Here are the keys," cried the turnkey, delivering them to Leonard. "You
  are not going too?" he added, as Wingfield pushed past him. "A couple of
  madmen! I shouldn't wonder if they were incendiaries."</p>

  <p>Directed by the cries, Leonard pressed forward through the blinding and
  stifling smoke. After proceeding about twenty yards, he arrived at a cross
  passage where the smoke was not quite so dense, as it found an escape through
  a small grated aperture in the wall. And here a horrible sight was presented
  to him. At the further extremity of this passage was a small cell, from which
  the cries he had heard issued. Not far from it the stone roof had fallen in,
  and from the chasm thus caused the flames were pouring into the passage.
  Regardless of the risk he ran, Leonard dashed forward, and reaching the cell,
  beheld Grant, still living, but in such a dreadful state, that it was evident
  his sufferings must soon be ended. His hair and beard were singed close to
  his head and face, and his flesh was blistered, blackened, and scorched to
  the bone. On seeing Leonard, he uttered a hoarse cry, and attempted to speak,
  but the words rattled in his throat. He then staggered forward, and, to
  Leonard's inexpressible horror, thrust his arms through the bars of the cage,
  which were literally red-hot. Seeing he had something in one hand, though he
  could not unclose his fingers, Leonard took it from him, and the wretched man
  fell backwards. At this moment a loud crack was heard in the wall behind.
  Several ponderous stones dropped from their places, admitting a volume of
  flame that filled the whole cell, and disclosing another body on the floor,
  near which lay that of Grant. Horrified by the spectacle, Leonard staggered
  off, and, catching Wingfield's arm, sought to retrace his steps. This was no
  easy matter, the smoke being so dense, that they could not see a foot before
  them, and was obliged to feel their way along the wall. On arriving at the
  cross passage, Wingfield would fain have turned off to the right, but Leonard
  drew him forcibly in the opposite direction; and most fortunate was it that
  he did so, or the worthy farmer would inevitably have perished. At last they
  reached the lodge, and sank down on a bench from exhaustion.</p>

  <p>"So, my masters," observed the turnkey, with a grim smile, "you were not
  able to rescue them, I perceive?" But receiving no answer, he added, "Well,
  and what did you see?"</p>

  <p>"A sight that would have moved even your stony heart to compassion,"
  returned Leonard, getting up and quitting the lodge. Followed by Wingfield,
  and scarcely knowing where he was going, he forced his way through the crowd,
  and dashing down Snow-hill, did not stop till he reached Holborn Conduit,
  where, seizing a leathern bucket, he filled it with water, and plunged his
  head into it. Refreshed by the immersion, he now glanced at the document
  committed to him by Grant. It was a piece of parchment, and showed by its
  shrivelled and scorched appearance the agony which its late possessor must
  have endured, Leonard did not open it, but thrust it with a shudder into his
  doublet.</p>

  <p>Meditating on the strange and terrible events that had just occurred,
  Leonard's thoughts involuntarily wandered to the Lady Isabella, whose image
  appeared to him like a bright star shining on troubled waters, and for the
  first time venturing to indulge in a hope that she might indeed be his, he
  determined immediately to proceed in search of her.</p>

  <p>It was now high noon, but the mid-day sun was scarcely visible, or not
  visible at all; as it struggled through the masses of yellow vapour it looked
  red as blood. Bands of workmen were demolishing houses on the western side of
  Fleet Ditch, and casting the rubbish into the muddy sluice before them, by
  which means it was confidently but vainly hoped that the progress of the fire
  would be checked. Shaping their course along the opposite side of the ditch,
  and crossing to Fleet Bridge, Leonard and his companion passed through
  Salisbury-court to Whitefriars, and taking a boat, directed the waterman to
  land them at Puddle Dock. The river was still covered with craft of every
  description laden with goods, and Baynard's Castle, an embattled stone
  structure of great strength and solidity, built at the beginning of the
  fifteenth century on the site of another castle as old as the Conquest, being
  now wrapped in flames from foundation to turret, offered a magnificent
  spectacle. From this point the four ascents leading to the cathedral, namely,
  Addle-hill, Saint Bennet's-hill, Saint Peter's-hill, and Lambert-hill, with
  all their throng of habitations, were burning&mdash;the black lines of ruined
  walls standing in bold relief against the white sheet of flame. Billows of
  fire rolled upwards every moment towards Saint Paul's, and threatened it with
  destruction.</p>

       title="Illustration">
    <p class="caption">The Burning of St. Paul's</p>
</div>


  <p>Landing at the appointed place Leonard and his companion ascended Saint
  Andrew's-hill, and, proceeding along Carter-lane, soon gained the precincts
  of the cathedral. Here the whole mass of habitations on the summit of Saint
  Bennet's-hill extending from the eastern, end of Carter-lane to Distaff-lane,
  was on fire, and the flames were dashed by the fierce wind against the
  south-east corner of the cathedral. A large crowd was collected at this
  point, and great efforts were made to save the venerable pile, but Leonard
  saw that its destruction was inevitable. Forcing a way through the throng
  with his companion, they reached Doctor Hodges's residence at the corner of
  Watling-street, and Leonard, without waiting to knock, tried the door, which
  yielded to his touch. The habitation was empty, and from the various articles
  scattered about it was evident its inmates must have fled with the greatest
  precipitation. Alarmed at this discovery, Leonard rushed forth with
  Wingfield, and sought to ascertain from the crowd without whither Doctor
  Hodges was gone, but could learn nothing more than that he had departed with
  his whole household a few hours before. At last it occurred to him that he
  might obtain some information from the Earl of Rochester, and he was about to
  cross to the other side of the churchyard, when he was arrested by a
  simultaneous cry of horror from the assemblage. Looking upwards, for there he
  saw the general gaze directed, he perceived that the scaffolding around the
  roof and tower of the cathedral had kindled, and was enveloping the whole
  upper part of the fabric in a network of fire. Flames were likewise bursting
  from the belfry, and from the lofty pointed windows below it, flickering and
  playing round the hoary buttresses, and disturbing the numerous jackdaws that
  built in their timeworn crevices, and now flew screaming forth. As Leonard
  gazed at the summit of the tower, be discerned through the circling eddies of
  smoke that enveloped it the figure of Solomon Eagle standing on the top of
  the battlements and waving his staff, and almost fancied he could hear his
  voice. After remaining in this perilous situation for some minutes, as if to
  raise anxiety for his safety to the highest pitch, the enthusiast sprang upon
  a portion of the scaffolding that was only partly consumed, and descended
  from pole to pole, regardless whether burning or not, with marvellous
  swiftness, and apparently without injury. Alighting on the roof, he speeded
  to the eastern extremity of the fane, and there commenced his exhortations to
  the crowd below.</p>

  <p>It now became evident also, from the strange roaring noise proceeding from
  the tower, that the flames were descending the spiral staircase, and forcing
  their way through some secret doors or passages to the roof. Determined to
  take one last survey of the interior of the cathedral before its destruction,
  which he now saw was inevitable, Leonard motioned to Wingfield, and forcing
  his way through the crowd, which was now considerably thinned, entered the
  southern door. He had scarcely gained the middle of the transept when the
  door opened behind him, and two persons, whom, even in the brief glimpse he
  caught of them, he knew to be Chowles and Judith, darted towards the steps
  leading to Saint Faith's. They appeared to be carrying a large chest, but
  Leonard was too much interested in what was occurring to pay much attention
  to them. There were but few persons besides himself and his companion within
  the cathedral, and these few were chiefly booksellers' porters, who were
  hurrying out of Saint Faith's in the utmost trepidation. By-and-by, these
  were gone, and they were alone&mdash;alone within that vast structure, and at
  such a moment. Their situation, though perilous, was one that awakened
  thrilling and sublime emotions. The cries of the multitude, coupled with the
  roaring of the conflagration, resounded from without, while the fierce glare
  of the flames lighted up the painted windows at the head of the choir with
  unwonted splendour. Overhead was heard a hollow rumbling noise like that of
  distant thunder, which continued for a short time, while fluid streams of
  smoke crept through the mighty rafters of the roof, and gradually filled the
  whole interior of the fabric with vapour. Suddenly a tremendous cracking was
  heard, as if the whole pile were tumbling in pieces. So appalling was this
  sound, that Leonard and his companion would have fled, but they were
  completely transfixed by terror.</p>

  <p>While they were in this state, the flames, which had long been burning in
  secret, burst through the roof at the other end of the choir, and
  instantaneously spread over its whole expanse. At this juncture, a cry of
  wild exultation was heard in the great northern gallery, and looking up,
  Leonard beheld Solomon Eagle, hurrying with lightning swiftness around it,
  and shouting in tones of exultation, "My words have come to pass&mdash;it
  burns&mdash;it burns&mdash;and will be utterly consumed!"</p>

  <p>The vociferations of the enthusiast were answered by a piercing cry from
  below, proceeding from Blaize, who at that moment rushed from the entrance of
  Saint Faith's. On seeing the porter, Leonard shouted to him, and the poor
  fellow hurried towards him. At this juncture, a strange hissing sound was
  heard, as if a heavy shower of rain were descending upon the roof, and
  through the yawning gap over the choir there poured a stream of molten lead
  of silvery brightness. Nothing can be conceived more beautiful than this
  shining yet terrible cascade, which descended with momentarily increasing
  fury, sparkling, flashing, hissing, and consuming all before it. All the
  elaborately carved woodwork and stalls upon which it fell were presently in
  flames. Leonard and his companions now turned to fly, but they had scarcely
  moved a few paces when another fiery cascade burst through the roof near the
  great western entrance, for which they were making, flooding the aisles and
  plashing against the massive columns. At the same moment, too, a third stream
  began to fall over the northern transept, not far from where Blaize stood,
  and a few drops of the burning metal reaching him, caused him to utter the
  most fearful outcries. Seriously alarmed, Leonard and Wingfield now rushed to
  one of the monuments in the northern aisle, and hastily clambering it,
  reached a window, which they burst open. Blaize followed them, but not
  without receiving a few accidental plashes from the fiery torrents, which
  elicited from him the most astounding yells. Having helped him to climb the
  monument, Leonard pushed him through the window after Wingfield, and then
  cast his eye round the building before he himself descended. The sight was
  magnificent in the extreme. Prom the flaming roof three silvery cascades
  descended. The choir was in flame, and a glowing stream like lava was
  spreading over the floor, and slowly trickling down the steps leading to the
  body of the church. The transepts and the greater part of the nave were
  similarly flooded. Above the roar of the flames and the hissing plash of the
  descending torrents, was heard the wild laughter of Solomon Eagle. Perceiving
  him in one of the arcades of the southern gallery, Leonard shouted to him to
  descend, and make good his escape while there was yet time, adding that in a
  few moments it would be too late.</p>

  <p>"I shall never quit it more," rejoined the enthusiast, in a voice of
  thunder, "but shall perish with the fire I have kindled. No monarch on earth
  ever lighted a nobler funeral pyre."</p>

  <p>And as Leonard passed through the window, he disappeared along the
  gallery. Breaking through the crowd collected round Wingfield and Blaize, and
  calling to them to follow him, Leonard made his way to the north-east of the
  churchyard, where he found a large assemblage of persons, in the midst of
  which were the king, the Duke of York, Rochester, Arlington, and many others.
  As Leonard advanced, Charles discerned him amid the crowd, and motioned him
  to come forward. A passage was then cleared, for him, through which Wingfield
  and Blaize, who kept close beside him, were permitted to pass.</p>

  <p>"I am glad to find no harm has happened to you, friend," said Charles, as
  he approached. "Rochester informed me you were gone to Newgate, and as the
  gaol had been burnt down, I feared you might have met with the same mishap. I
  now regret that I did not adopt your plan, but it may not be yet too
  late."</p>

  <p>"It is not too late to save a portion of your city, sire," replied
  Leonard; "but, alas! how much is gone!"</p>

  <p>"It is so," replied the king, mournfully.</p>

  <p>Further conversation was here interrupted by the sudden breaking out of
  the fire from the magnificent rose window of the cathedral, the effect of
  which, being extraordinarily fine, attracted the monarch's attention. By this
  time Solomon Eagle had again ascended the roof, and making his way to the
  eastern extremity, clasped the great stone cross that terminated it with his
  left hand, while with his right he menaced the king and his party, uttering
  denunciations that were lost in the terrible roar prevailing around him. The
  flames now raged with a fierceness wholly inconceivable, considering the
  material they had to work upon. The molten lead poured down in torrents, and
  not merely flooded the whole interior of the fabric, but ran down in a wide
  and boiling stream almost as far as the Thames, consuming everything in its
  way, and rendering the very pavements red-hot. Every stone, spout, and gutter
  in the sacred pile, of which there were some hundreds, added to this fatal
  shower, and scattered destruction far and wide; nor will this be wondered at
  when it is considered that the quantity of lead thus melted covered a space
  of no less than six acres. Having burned with incredible fury and fierceness
  for some time, the whole roof of the sacred structure fell in at once, and
  with a crash heard at an amazing distance. After an instant's pause, the
  flames burst forth from every window in the fabric, producing such an
  intensity of heat, that the stone pinnacles, transom beams, and mullions
  split and cracked with a sound like volleys of artillery, shivering and
  flying in every direction. The whole interior of the pile was now one vast
  sheet of flame, which soared upwards, and consumed even the very stones. Not
  a vestige of the reverend structure was left untouched&mdash;its
  bells&mdash;its plate&mdash;its woodwork&mdash;its monuments&mdash;its mighty
  pillars&mdash;its galleries&mdash;its chapels&mdash;all, all were destroyed.
  The fire raged throughout all that night and the next day, till it had
  consumed all but the mere shell, and rendered the venerable
  cathedral&mdash;"one of the most ancient pieces of piety in the Christian
  world"&mdash;to use the words of Evelyn, a heap of ruin and ashes.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch6-8"
     name="ch6-8">VIII. &mdash; HOW LEONARD RESCUED THE LADY ISABELLA.</a></h2>

  <p>The course of events having been somewhat anticipated in the last chapter,
  it will now be necessary to return to an earlier stage in the destruction of
  the cathedral, namely, soon after the furious bursting forth of the flames
  from the great eastern windows. While Leonard, in common with the rest of the
  assemblage, was gazing at this magnificent spectacle, he heard a loud cry of
  distress behind him, and turning at the sound, beheld Doctor Hodges rush
  forth from an adjoining house, the upper part of which was on fire, almost in
  a state of distraction. An elderly man and woman, and two or three female
  servants, all of whom were crying as loud as himself, followed him. But their
  screams fell on indifferent ears, for the crowd had become by this time too
  much accustomed to such appeals to pay any particular attention to them.
  Leonard, however, instantly rushed towards the doctor, and anxiously inquired
  what was the matter; the latter was so bewildered that he did not recognise
  the voice of the speaker, but gazing up at the house with an indescribable
  anguish, cried, "Merciful God! the flames have by this time reached her
  room&mdash;she will be burned&mdash;horror!"</p>

  <p>"Who will be burned?" cried Leonard, seizing his arm, and gazing at him
  with a look of apprehension and anguish equal to his own&mdash;"Not the Lady
  Isabella?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Isabella," replied Hodges, regarding the speaker, and for the first
  time perceiving by whom he was addressed. "Not a moment is to be lost if you
  would save her from a terrible death. She was left in a fainting state in one
  of the upper rooms by a female attendant, who deserted her mistress to save
  herself. The staircase is on fire, or I myself would have saved her."</p>

  <p>"A ladder! a ladder!" cried Leonard.</p>

  <p>"Here is one," cried Wingfield, pointing to one propped against an
  adjoining house. And in another moment, by the combined efforts of the crowd,
  the ladder was brought and placed against the burning building.</p>

  <p>"Which is the window?" cried Leonard.</p>

  <p>"That on the right, on the second floor," replied Hodges. "Gracious
  Heaven! the flames are bursting from it."</p>

  <p>But Leonard's foot was now on the ladder, and rushing up with
  inconceivable swiftness, he plunged through the window regardless of the
  flame. All those who witnessed this daring deed, regarded his destruction as
  certain, and even Hodges gave him up for lost. But the next moment he
  appeared at the window, bearing the fainting female form in his arms, and
  with extraordinary dexterity obtaining a firm footing and hold of the ladder,
  descended in safety. The shout that burst from such part of the assemblage as
  had witnessed this achievement, and its successful termination, attracted the
  king's attention, and he inquired the cause of the clamour.</p>

  <p>"I will ascertain it for your majesty," replied Rochester, and proceeding
  to the group, he learnt, to his great satisfaction, what had occurred. Having
  gained this intelligence, he flew back to the king, and briefly explained the
  situation of the parties. Doctor Hodges, it appeared, had just removed to the
  house in question, which belonged to one of his patients, as a temporary
  asylum, and the Lady Isabella had accompanied him. She was in the upper part
  of the house when the fire broke out, and was so much terrified that she
  swooned away, in which condition her attendant left her; nor was the latter
  so much to blame as might appear, for the stairs were burning at the time,
  and a moment's delay would have endangered her own safety.</p>

  <p>"Fate, indeed, seems to have brought these young persons together,"
  replied Charles, as he listened to Rochester's recital, who took this
  opportunity of acquainting him with Lord Argentine's dying injunctions, "and
  it would be a pity to separate them."</p>

  <p>"I am sure your majesty has no such intention," said Rochester.</p>

  <p>"You will see," rejoined the monarch. And, as he spoke, he turned his
  horse's head, and moved towards the spot where Leonard was kneeling beside
  Isabella, and supporting her. Some restoratives having been applied by Doctor
  Hodges, she had regained her sensibility, and was murmuring her thanks to her
  deliverer.</p>

  <p>"She has not lost her beauty, I perceive," cried Charles, gazing at her
  with admiration, and feeling something of his former passion revive within
  his breast.</p>

  <p>"Your majesty, I trust, will not mar their happiness," said Rochester,
  noticing the monarch's libertine look with uneasiness. "Remember, you owe
  your life to that young man."</p>

  <p>"And I will pay the debt royally," replied Charles; "I will give him
  permission to marry her."</p>

  <p>"Your majesty's permission is scarcely needed," muttered Rochester.</p>

  <p>"There you are wrong, my lord," replied the king. "She is now my ward, and
  I can dispose of her in marriage as I please; nor will I so dispose of her
  except to her equal in rank."</p>

  <p>"I discern your majesty's gracious intentions," replied Rochester,
  gratefully inclining his head.</p>

  <p>"I almost forget my deliverer's name," whispered Charles, with a smile,
  "but it is of no consequence, since he will so speedily change it."</p>

  <p>"His name is Leonard Holt," replied Rochester, in the same tone.</p>

  <p>"Ah!&mdash;true," returned the king. "What ho! good Master Leonard Holt,"
  he added, addressing the young man, "commit the Lady Isabella Argentine to
  the care of our worthy friend Doctor Hodges for a moment, and stand up before
  me." His injunctions being complied with, he continued, "The Lady Isabella
  Argentine and I owe our lives to you, and we must both evince our
  gratitude&mdash;she by devoting that life, which, if I am not misinformed,
  she will be right willing to do, to you, and I by putting you in a position
  to unite yourself to her. The title of Argentine has been this day
  extinguished by most unhappy circumstances; I therefore confer the title on
  you, and here in this presence create you Baron Argentine, of Argentine, in
  Staffordshire. Your patent shall be made out with all convenient despatch,
  and with it you shall receive the hand of the sole representative of that
  ancient and noble house."</p>

  <p>"Your majesty overwhelms me," replied Leonard, falling on his knee and
  pressing the king's hand, which was kindly extended towards him, to his lips.
  "I can scarcely persuade myself I am not in a dream."</p>

  <p>"You will soon awaken to the sense of the joyful reality," returned the
  king. "Have I not now discharged my debt?" he added to Rochester.</p>

  <p>"Right royally, indeed, my liege," replied the earl, in a tone of
  unaffected emotion. "My lord," he added, grasping Leonard's hand, "I
  sincerely congratulate you on your newly-acquired dignities, nor less in the
  happiness that awaits you there."</p>

  <p>"If I do not answer you fittingly, my lord," replied the new-made peer,
  "it is not because I do not feel your kindness. But my brain reels. Pray
  Heaven my senses may not desert me."</p>

  <p>"You must not forget the document you obtained this morning, my lord,"
  replied Rochester, endeavouring to divert his thoughts into a new channel.
  "The proper moment for consulting it may have arrived."</p>

  <p>Lord Argentine, for we shall henceforth give him his title, thrust his
  hand into his doublet, and drew forth the parchment. He opened it, and
  endeavoured to read it, but a mist swam before his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Let me look at it," said Rochester, taking it from him. "It is a deed of
  gift," he said, after glancing at it for a moment, "from the late Lord
  Argentine&mdash;I mean the elder baron&mdash;of a large estate in Yorkshire,
  which he possessed in right of his wife, to you, my lord, here described as
  Leonard Holt, provided you shall marry the Lady Isabella Argentine. Another
  piece of good fortune. Again and again, I congratulate you."</p>

  <p>"And now," said Charles, "other and less pleasing matters claim our
  attention. Let the Lady Isabella be removed, under the charge of Doctor
  Hodges, to Whitehall, where apartments shall be provided for her at once,
  together with fitting attendants, and where she can remain till this terrible
  conflagration is over which, I trust, soon will be, when I will no longer
  delay her happiness, but give her away in person. Chiffinch," he added to the
  chief page, "see all this is carried into effect."</p>

  <p>"I will, my liege, and right willingly," replied Chiffinch.</p>

  <p>"I would send you with her, my lord," pursued Charles to Argentine, "but I
  have other duties for you to fulfil. The plan you proposed of demolishing the
  houses with gunpowder shall be immediately put into operation, under your own
  superintendence."</p>

  <p>A chair was now brought, and the Lady Isabella, after a tender parting
  with her lover, being placed within it, she was thus transported, under the
  charge of Hodges and Chiffinch, to Whitehall, where she arrived in safety,
  though not without having sustained some hindrance and inconvenience.</p>

  <p>She had not been gone many minutes, when the conflagration of the
  cathedral assumed its most terrific character; the whole of the mighty roof
  falling in, and the flames soaring upwards, as before related. Up to this
  time, Solomon Eagle had maintained his position at the eastern end of the
  roof, and still grasped the stone cross. His situation now attracted
  universal attention, for it was evident he must speedily perish.</p>

  <p>"Poor wretch!" exclaimed the king, shuddering, "I fear there is no way of
  saving him."</p>

  <p>"None, whatever my liege," replied Rochester, "nor do I believe he would
  consent to it if there were. But he is again menacing your majesty."</p>

  <p>As Rochester spoke, Solomon Eagle shook his arm menacingly at the royal
  party, raising it aloft, as if invoking the vengeance of Heaven. He then
  knelt down upon the sloping ridge of the roof, as if in prayer, and his
  figure, thus seen relieved against the mighty sheet of flame, might have been
  taken for an image of Saint John the Baptist carved in stone. Not an eye in
  the vast crowd below but was fixed on him. In a few moments he rose again,
  and tossing his arms aloft, and shrieking, in a voice distinctly heard above
  the awful roar around him, the single word "<i>Resurgam!</i>" flung himself
  headlong into the flaming abyss. A simultaneous cry of horror rose from the
  whole assemblage on beholding this desperate action.</p>

  <p>"The last exclamation of the poor wretch may apply to the cathedral, as
  well as to himself," remarked the monarch, to a middle-aged personage, with a
  pleasing and highly intellectual countenance, standing near him: "for the old
  building shall rise again, like a phoenix from its fires, with renewed
  beauty, and under your superintendence, Doctor Christopher Wren."</p>

  <p>The great architect bowed. "I cannot hope to erect such another
  structure," he said, modestly; "but I will endeavour to design an edifice
  that shall not disgrace your majesty's city."</p>

  <p>"You must build me another city at the same time, Doctor Wren," sighed the
  king. "Ah!" he added, "is not that Mr. Lilly, the almanac-maker, whom I see
  among the crowd?"</p>

  <p>"It is," replied Rochester.</p>

  <p>"Bid him come to me," replied the king. And the order being obeyed, he
  said to the astrologer, "Well, Mr. Lilly, your second prediction has come to
  pass. We have had the Plague, and now we have the Fire. You may thank my
  clemency that I do not order you to be cast into the flames, like the poor
  wretch who has just perished before our eyes, as a wizard and professor of
  the black art. How did you obtain information of these fatal events?"</p>

  <p>"By a careful study of the heavenly bodies, sire," replied Lilly, "and by
  long and patient calculations, which, if your majesty or any of your
  attendants had had leisure or inclination to make, would have afforded you
  the same information. <i>I</i> make no pretence to the gift of prophecy, but
  this calamity was predicted in the last century."</p>

  <p>"Indeed! by whom?" asked the king.</p>

  <p>"By Michael Nostradamus," replied Lilly; "his prediction runs
  thus:&mdash;</p>

  <p>'La sang du juste  Londres fera faute, Bruslez par feu, le vingt et
  trois, les Six; La Dame antique cherra de place haute, De mme secte
  plusieurs seront occis.'[1]</p>

  <p>And thus I venture to explain it. The 'blood of the just' refers to the
  impious and execrable murder of your majesty's royal father of blessed
  memory. 'Three-and-twenty and six' gives the exact year of the calamity; and
  it may likewise give us, as will be seen by computation hereafter, the amount
  of habitations to be destroyed. The 'Ancient Dame' undoubtedly refers to the
  venerable pile now burning before us, which, as it stands in the most eminent
  spot in the city, clearly 'falls from its high place.' The expression 'of the
  same sect' refers not to men, but churches, of which a large number, I grieve
  to say it, are already destroyed."</p>

  <p>[Footnote 1:</p>

  <p>'The blood of the just shall be wanting in London, Burnt by fire of
  three-and-twenty, the Six; The ancient Dame shall fall from her high place,
  Of the same sect many shall be killed.']</p>

  <p>"The prophecy is a singular one," remarked Charles, musingly "and you have
  given it a plausible interpretation." And for some moments he appeared lost
  in reflection. Suddenly rousing himself, he took forth his tablets, and
  hastily tracing a few lines upon a leaf, tore it out, and delivered it with
  his signet-ring to Lord Argentine. "Take this, my lord," he said, "to Lord
  Craven. You will find him at his post in Tower-street. A band of my
  attendants shall go with you. Embark at the nearest stairs you
  can&mdash;those at Blackfriars I should conceive the most accessible. Bid the
  men row for their lives. As soon as you join Lord Craven, commence
  operations. The Tower must be preserved at all hazards. Mark me!&mdash;at all
  hazards."</p>

  <p>"I understand your majesty," replied Argentine&mdash;"your commands shall
  be implicitly obeyed. And if the conflagration has not gone too far, I will
  answer with my life that I preserve the fortress." And he departed on his
  mission.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch6-9"
     name="ch6-9">IX. &mdash; WHAT BEFEL CHOWLES AND JUDITH IN THE VAULTS OF
     SAINT FAITH'S.</a></h2>

  <p>Having now seen what occurred outside Saint Paul's, we shall proceed to
  the vaults beneath it. Chowles and Judith, it has been mentioned, were
  descried by Leonard, just before the outbreak of the fire, stealing into
  Saint Faith's, and carrying a heavy chest between them. This chest contained
  some of the altar-plate, which they had pillaged from the Convocation House.
  As they traversed the aisles of Saint Faith's, which were now filled with
  books and paper, they could distinctly hear the raging of the fire without,
  and Judith, who was far less intimidated than her companion, observed, "Let
  it roar on. It cannot injure us."</p>

  <p>"I am not so sure of that," replied Chowles, doubtfully, "I wish we had
  taken our hoards elsewhere."</p>

  <p>"There is no use in wishing that now," rejoined Judith. "And it would have
  been wholly impossible to get them out of the city. But have no fear. The
  fire, I tell you, cannot reach us. It could as soon burn into the solid earth
  as into this place."</p>

  <p>"It comforts me to hear you say so," replied Chowles. "And when I think of
  those mighty stone floors above us, I feel we are quite safe. No, no, it can
  never make its way through them."</p>

  <p>Thus discoursing, they reached the charnel at the further end of the
  church, where Chowles struck a light, and producing a flask of strong waters,
  took a copious draught himself and handed the flask to Judith, who imitated
  his example. Their courage being thus stimulated, they opened the chest, and
  Chowles was so enraptured with its glittering contents that he commenced
  capering round the vault. Recalled to quietude by a stern reproof from
  Judith, he opened a secret door in the wall, and pushed the chest into a
  narrow passage beyond it. Fearful of being discovered in their retreat, they
  took a basket of provisions and liquor with them, and then closed the door.
  For some time, they proceeded along the passage, pushing the chest before
  them, until they came to a descent of a few steps, which brought them to a
  large vault, half-filled with bags of gold, chests of plate, caskets, and
  other plunder. At the further end of this vault was a strong wooden door.
  Pushing the chest into the middle of the chamber, Chowles seated himself upon
  it, and opening the basket of provisions, took out the bottle of spirits, and
  again had recourse to it.</p>

  <p>"How comfortable and secure we feel in this quiet place," he said; "while
  all above us is burning. I declare I feel quite merry, ha! ha!" And he forced
  a harsh and discordant laugh.</p>

  <p>"Give me the bottle," rejoined Judith, sternly, "and don't grin like a
  death's head. I don't like to see the frightful face you make."</p>

  <p>"It's the first time you ever thought my face frightful," replied Chowles,
  "and I begin to think you are afraid."</p>

  <p>"Afraid!" echoed Judith, forcing a derisive laugh in her turn;
  "afraid&mdash;of what?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, I don't know," replied Chowles; "only I feel a little uncomfortable.
  What if we should not be able to breathe here? The very idea gives me a
  tightness across the chest."</p>

  <p>"Silence!" cried Judith, with a fierceness that effectually insured
  obedience to her command.</p>

  <p>Chowles again had recourse to the bottle, and deriving a false courage
  from it, as before, commenced skipping about the chamber in his usual
  fantastical manner. Judith, did not attempt to check him, but remained with
  her chin resting upon her hand gazing at him.</p>

  <p>"Do you remember the Dance of Death, Judith?" he cried, executing some of
  the wildest flourishes he had then performed, "and how I surprised the Earl
  of Rochester and his crew?"</p>

  <p>"I do," replied Judith, sternly, "and I hope we may not soon have to
  perform that dance together in reality."</p>

  <p>"It was a merry night," rejoined Chowles, who did not hear what she said,
  "a right merry night&mdash;and so to-night shall be, in spite of what is
  occurring overhead. Ha! ha!" And he took another long pull at the flask. "I
  breathe freely now." And he continued his wild flourishes until he was
  completely exhausted. He then sat down by Judith, and would have twined his
  bony arms round her neck, but she roughly repulsed him.</p>

  <p>With a growl of displeasure, he then proceeded to open and examine the
  various bags, chests, and caskets piled upon the floor, and the sight of
  their contents so excited Judith, that shaking off her misgivings, she joined
  him, and they continued opening case after case, glutting their greedy eyes,
  until Chowles became aware that the vault was filled with smoke. As soon as
  he perceived this, he started to his feet in terror.</p>

  <p>"We are lost&mdash;we shall be suffocated!" he cried! Judith likewise
  arose, and her looks showed that she shared in his apprehensions.</p>

  <p>"We must not stay here," cried Chowles; "and yet," he added, with an
  agonised look at the rich store before him, "the treasure! the treasure!"</p>

  <p>"Ay, let us, at least, take something with us," rejoined Judith, snatching
  up two or three of the most valuable caskets.</p>

  <p>While Chowles gazed at the heap before him, hesitating what to select, the
  smoke grew so dense around them, that Judith seized his arm, and dragged him
  away. "I come&mdash;I come!" he cried, snatching up a bag of gold.</p>

  <p>They then threaded the narrow passage, Judith leading the way and bearing
  the light. The smoke grew thicker and thicker as they advanced; but
  regardless of this, they hurried to the secret door leading to the charnel.
  Judith touched the spring, but as she did so, a sheet of flame burst in and
  drove her back. Chowles dashed passed her, and with great presence of mind
  shut the door, excluding the flame. They then hastily retraced their steps,
  feeling that not a moment was to be lost if they would escape. The air in the
  vault, thickened by the smoke, had become so hot that they could scarcely
  breathe; added to which, to increase their terror, they heard the most awful
  cracking of the walls overhead, as if the whole fabric were breaking asunder
  to its foundation.</p>

  <p>"The cathedral is tumbling upon us! We shall be buried alive!" exclaimed
  Chowles, as he listened with indescribable terror to the noise overhead!</p>

  <p>"I owe my death to you, wretch!" cried Judith, fiercely. "You persuaded me
  to come hither."</p>

  <p>"I!" cried Chowles. "It is a lie! You were the person who proposed it. But
  for you I should have left our hoards here, and come for them after the fire
  was over."</p>

  <p>"It is you who lie!" returned Judith, with increased fury, "that was my
  proposal."</p>

  <p>"Hold your tongue, you she-devil," cried Chowles, "it is you who have
  brought me into this strait&mdash;and if you do not cease taunting me, I will
  silence you for ever."</p>

  <p>"Coward and fool!" cried Judith, "I will at least have the satisfaction of
  seeing you die before me."</p>

  <p>And as she spoke, she rushed towards him, and a desperate struggle
  commenced. And thus while the walls were cracking overhead, threatening them
  with instant destruction, the two wretches continued their strife, uttering
  the most horrible blasphemies and execrations. Judith, being the stronger of
  the two, had the advantage, and she had seized her opponent by the throat
  with the intention of strangling him, when a most terrific crash was heard
  causing her to loose her gripe. The air instantly became as hot as the breath
  of a furnace, and both started to their feet. "What has happened?" gasped
  Chowles.</p>

  <p>"I know not," replied Judith, "and I dare not look down the passage."</p>

  <p>"Then I will," replied Chowles, and he advanced a few paces up it, and
  then hastily returned, shrieking, "it is filled with boiling lead, and the
  stream is flowing towards us."</p>

  <p>Scarcely able to credit the extent of the danger, Judith gazed down the
  passage, and there beheld a glowing silvery stream trickling slowly onwards.
  She saw too well, that if they could not effect their retreat instantly,
  their fate was sealed.</p>

  <p>"The door of the vault!" she cried, pointing towards it, "where is the
  key? where is the key?"</p>

  <p>"I have not got it," replied Chowles, distractedly, "I cannot tell where
  to find it."</p>

  <p>"Then we are lost!" cried Judith, with a terrible execration.</p>

  <p>"Not so," replied Chowles, snatching up a pickaxe, "if I cannot unlock the
  door, I can break it open."</p>

  <p>With this, he commenced furiously striking against it, while Judith, who
  was completely horror-stricken, and filled with the conviction that her last
  moments were at hand, fell on her knees beside him, and gazing down the
  passage, along which she could see the stream of molten lead, now nearly a
  foot in depth, gradually advancing, and hissing as it came, shrieked to
  Chowles to increase his exertions. He needed no incitement to do so, but
  nerved by fear, continued to deal blow after blow against the door, until at
  last he effected a small breach just above the lock. But this only showed him
  how vain were his hopes, for a stream of fire and smoke poured through the
  aperture. Notwithstanding this, he continued his exertions, Judith shrieking
  all the time, until the lock at last yielded. He then threw open the door,
  but finding the whole passage involved in flame, was obliged to close it.
  Judith had now risen, and their looks at each other at this fearful moment
  were terrible in the extreme. Retreating to either side of the cell, they
  glared at each other like wild beasts. Suddenly, Judith casting her eyes to
  the entrance of the vault, uttered a yell of terror, that caused her
  companion to look in that direction, and he perceived that the stream of
  molten lead had gained it, and was descending the steps. He made a rush
  towards the door at the same time with Judith, and another struggle ensued,
  in which he succeeded in dashing her upon the floor. He again opened the
  door, but was again driven backwards by the terrific flame, and perceived
  that the fiery current had reached Judith, who was writhing and shrieking in
  its embrace. Before Chowles could again stir, it was upon him. With a yell of
  anguish, he fell forward, and was instantly stifled in the glowing torrent,
  which in a short time flooded the whole chamber, burying the two partners in
  iniquity, and the whole of their ill-gotten gains, in its burning waves.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch6-10"
     name="ch6-10">X. &mdash; CONCLUSION.</a></h2>

  <p>Lord Argentine proceeded, as directed by the king, to the eastern end of
  Tower-street, where he found Lord Craven, and having delivered him the king's
  missive, and shown him the signet, they proceeded to the western side of the
  Tower Dock, and having procured a sufficient number of miners and engineers,
  together with a supply of powder from the fortress, commenced undermining the
  whole of the row of habitations called Tower-bank, on the edge of the dock,
  having first, it is scarcely necessary to state, taken care to clear them of
  their inhabitants. The powder deposited, the trains were fired, and the
  buildings blown into the air. At this time the whole of the western side of
  the Tower Moat was covered with low wooden houses and sheds, and, mindful of
  the king's instructions, Lord Argentine suggested to Lord Craven that they
  should be destroyed. The latter acquiescing, they proceeded to their task,
  and in a short time the whole of the buildings of whatever description, from
  the bulwark-gate to the city postern, at the north of the Tower, and nearly
  opposite the Bowyer Tower, were destroyed. Long before this was accomplished
  they were joined by the Duke of York, who lent his utmost assistance to the
  task, and when night came on, a clear space of at least a hundred yards in
  depth, had been formed between the ancient fortress and the danger with which
  it was threatened.</p>

  <p>Meantime the conflagration continued to rage with unabated fury. It burnt
  throughout the whole of Monday night, and having destroyed Saint Paul's, as
  before related, poured down Ludgate-hill, consuming all in its way, and,
  crossing Fleet Bridge, commenced its ravages upon the great thoroughfare
  adjoining it. On Tuesday an immense tract was on fire. All Fleet-street, as
  far as the Inner Temple, Ludgate-hill, and the whole of the city eastwards,
  along the banks of the Thames, up to the Tower Dock, where the devastation
  was checked by the vast gap of houses demolished, were in flames. From thence
  the boundary of the fire extended to the end of Mark-lane, Lime-street, and
  Leadenhall, the strong walls of which resisted its fury. Ascending again by
  the Standard on Cornhill, Threadneedle-street, and Austin Friars, it embraced
  Drapers' Hall, and the whole mass of buildings to the west of
  Throgmorton-street. It next proceeded to the then new buildings behind Saint
  Margaret's, Lothbury, and so on westward to the upper end of Cateaton-street,
  whence it spread to the second postern in London Wall, and destroying the
  ramparts and suburbs as far as Cripplegate, consumed Little Wood-street,
  Mungwell-street, and the whole of the city wall on the west as far as
  Aldersgate. Passing a little to the north of Saint Sepulchre's, which it
  destroyed, it crossed Holborn Bridge, and ascending Saint Andrew's-hill,
  passed the end of Shoe-lane, and so on to the end of Fetter-lane. The whole
  of the buildings contained within this boundary were now on fire, and burning
  with terrific fury. And so they continued till the middle of Wednesday, when
  the wind abating, and an immense quantity of houses being demolished
  according to Lord Argentine's plan, the conflagration was got under; and
  though it broke out in several places after that time, little mischief was
  done, and it may be said to have ceased on the middle of that day.</p>

  <p>On Saturday morning in that week, soon after daybreak, a young man,
  plainly yet richly attired in the habiliments then worn by persons of high
  rank, took his way over the smouldering heaps of rubbish, and along the ranks
  of ruined and blackened walls denoting the habitations that had once
  constituted Fleet-street. It was with no little risk, and some difficulty,
  that he could force his way, now clambering over heaps of smouldering ashes,
  now passing by some toppling wall, which fell with a terrific crash after he
  had just passed it&mdash;now creeping under an immense pile of blackened
  rafters; but he at length reached Fleet Bridge, where he paused to gaze at
  the scene of devastation around him.</p>

  <p>It was indeed a melancholy sight, and drew tears to his eyes. The ravages
  of the fire were almost inconceivable. Great beams were burnt to
  charcoal&mdash;stones calcined, and as white as snow, and such walls and
  towers as were left standing were so damaged that their instant fall was to
  be expected. The very water in the wells and fountains was boiling, and even
  the muddy Fleet sent forth a hot steam. The fire still lingered in the lower
  parts of many habitations, especially where wine, spirits, or inflammable
  goods had been kept; and these "voragos of subterranean cellars," as Evelyn
  terms them, still emitted flames, together with a prodigious smoke and
  stench. Undismayed by the dangers of the path he had to traverse, the young
  man ascended Ludgate-hill, still encountering the same devastation, and
  passing through the ruined gateway, the end of which remained perfect,
  approached what had once been Saint Paul's Cathedral. Mounting a heap of
  rubbish at the end of Ludgate street, he gazed at the mighty ruin, which
  looked more like the remains of a city than those of a single edifice.</p>

  <p>The solid walls and buttresses were split and rent asunder; enormous
  stones were splintered and calcined by the heat; and vast flakes having
  scaled from off the pillars, gave them a hoary and almost ghostly appearance.
  Its enormous extent was now for the first time clearly seen, and, strange to
  say it looked twice as large in ruins as when entire. The central tower was
  still standing, but chipped, broken, and calcined, like the rest of the
  structure, by the vehement heat of the flames. Part of the roof, in its fall,
  broke through the solid floor of the choir, which was of immense thickness,
  into Saint Faith's, and destroyed the magazine of books and paper deposited
  there by the booksellers. The portico, erected by Inigo Jones, and which
  found so much favour in Evelyn's eyes, that he describes it as "comparable to
  any in Europe," and particularly deplores its loss, shared the fate of the
  rest of the building&mdash;the only part left uninjured being the architrave,
  the inscription on which was undefaced.</p>

  <p>Having satiated himself with this sad but striking prospect, the young
  man, with some toil and trouble, crossed the churchyard, and gained
  Cheapside, where a yet more terrific scene of devastation than that which he
  had previously witnessed burst upon him. On the right of London Bridge, which
  he could discern through the chasms of the houses, and almost to the Tower,
  were nothing but ruins, while a similar waste lay on the left. Such was the
  terrible change that had been wrought in the aspect of the ruined city, that
  if the young man had not had some marks to guide him, he would not have known
  where he was. The tower and ruined walls of Saint Peter's Church pointed out
  to him the entrance to Wood-street, and, entering it, he traversed it with
  considerable difficulty&mdash;for the narrow thoroughfares were much fuller
  of rubbish, and much less freed from smoke and fiery vapour, than the
  wider&mdash;until he reached a part of it with which he had once been well
  acquainted. But, alas! how changed was that familiar spot. The house he
  sought was a mere heap of ruins. While gazing at them, he heard a voice
  behind him, and turning, beheld Mr. Bloundel and his son Stephen, forcing
  their way through what had once been Maiden-lane. A warm greeting passed
  between them, and Mr. Bloundel gazed for some time in silence upon the wreck
  of his dwelling. Tears forced themselves into his eyes, and his companions
  were no less moved. As he turned to depart, he observed to the young man with
  some severity:</p>

  <p>"How is it, Leonard, that I see you in this gay apparel? Surely, the
  present is not a fitting season for such idle display."</p>

  <p>Lord Argentine, for such it was, now explained to the wonder-stricken
  grocer all that had occurred to him, adding that he had intended coming to
  him that very day, if he had not been thus anticipated, to give him the
  present explanation.</p>

  <p>"And where are Farmer Wingfield and Blaize?" asked Mr. Bloundel. "We have
  been extremely uneasy at your prolonged absence."</p>

  <p>"They are both at the palace," replied Lord Argentine, "and have both been
  laid up with slight injuries received during the conflagration; but I
  believe&mdash;nay, I am sure&mdash;they will get out to-day."</p>

  <p>"That is well," replied Mr. Bloundel; "and now let me congratulate you,
  Leonard&mdash;that is, my lord&mdash;how strange such a title
  sounds!&mdash;on your new dignity.</p>

  <p>"And accept my congratulations, too, my lord," said Stephen.</p>

  <p>"Oh! do not style me thus," said Argentine. "With you, at least, let me be
  ever Leonard Holt."</p>

  <p>"You are still my old apprentice, I see," cried the grocer, warmly
  grasping his hand.</p>

  <p>"And such I shall ever continue in feeling," returned the other, cordially
  returning the pressure.</p>

  <p>Three days after this, Lord Argentine was united to the Lady
  Isabella.&mdash;the king, as he had promised, giving away the bride. The Earl
  of Rochester was present, together with the grocer and his wife, and the
  whole of their family. Another marriage also took place on the same day
  between Blaize and Patience. Both unions, it is satisfactory to be able to
  state, were extremely happy, though it would be uncandid not to mention, that
  in the latter case, to use a homely but expressive phrase, "the grey mare
  proved the better horse." Blaize, however, was exceedingly content under his
  government. He settled at Willesden with his wife, where they lived to a good
  old age, and where some of his descendants may still be found.</p>

  <p>Mr. Bloundel sustained only a trifling loss by the fire. Another house was
  erected on the site of the old habitation, where he carried on his business
  as respectably and as profitably as before, until, in the course of nature,
  he was gathered to his fathers, and succeeded by his son Stephen, leaving an
  unblemished character behind him as a legacy to his family. Nor was it his
  only legacy, in a worldly sense, for his time had not been misspent, and he
  had well-husbanded his money. All his family turned out well, and were
  successful in the world. Stephen rose to the highest civic dignities, and the
  younger obtained great distinction. Their daughter Christiana became Lady
  Argentine, being wedded to the eldest son of the baron and baroness.</p>

  <p>Mike Macascree, the piper, and Bell, found a happy asylum with the same
  noble family.</p>

  <p>As to Lord and Lady Argentine, theirs was a life of uninterrupted
  happiness. Devotedly attached to her lord, the Lady Isabella seemed only to
  live for him, and he well repaid her affection. By sedulously cultivating his
  talents and powers, which were considerable, he was enabled to reflect credit
  upon the high rank to which it had pleased a grateful sovereign to elevate
  him. He lived to see the new cathedral completed by Sir Christopher Wren, and
  often visited it with feelings of admiration, but never with the same
  sentiments of veneration and awe that he had experienced when, in times long
  gone by, he had repaired to <span class="smcap">Old Saint Paul's</span>.</p>
