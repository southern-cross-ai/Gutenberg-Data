  <h3>First published as <i>The Strange Case Of Lucille Clery</i>,<br>
  William Heinemann, London, 1932</h3>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <p class="intro">This novel is based on a fact&mdash;that of a crime so
  incredible that it caused amazement equal to the horror it inspired; the
  public sentiment aroused by this atrocity went far to provoke the sudden
  French Revolution of 1848. The author is responsible for everything in the
  novel save this central fact, and for the details of the life of the period,
  which are largely taken from contemporary newspapers.</p>

  <p class="intro">[Charles Laure Hugues Thobald, duc de Choiseul-Praslin (29
  June 1804-24 August 1847) was a French nobleman and politician, who served as
  a member of the Chamber of Deputies in 1838-1842. Choiseul-Praslin's suicide,
  occurring while he faced trial for the murder of his wife, Fanny Sbastiani,
  caused a scandal which in turn contributed to the outbreak of the 1848
  Revolution and the fall of the July Monarchy. In previous years, the
  Choiseul-Praslin household had been the scene of violent confrontations
  between the duke and his wife. Among others, Fanny de Choiseul-Praslin
  accused her husband of hiring a governess, Henriette Deluzy-Desportes (or
  Henriette de Lucy, Henriette de Luzy), in order to estrange her from her
  children. Deluzy-Desportes, whom she had fired six weeks before being killed
  but had not left the household, was also alleged by Fanny to have been the
  duke's mistress (with whom, she suspected, the duke planned to elope).The
  duchess repeatedly threatened to separate from her
  husband.&mdash;<i>Wikipedia</i>]</p>

  <h2><a id="pro"
     name="pro">PROLOGUE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">She took off her glove and glanced at the wedding ring which
  she had no right to wear; this irritated her companion. As he opened the door
  of the musty, private parlour of the inn he reflected that many of her
  actions since he had eloped with her had irritated him; a bad beginning.</p>

  <p>He endeavoured to reassure himself by a full look at her beauty and
  elegance. Mary Showler accepted with pleasure this admiration that was tinged
  by doubt and reluctance. Still displaying the slim hand with the gold band
  that he had given her that morning, she sat composedly at ease, ignoring her
  homely surroundings, the dark room with a dusty case of prize fish, a shelf
  with pewter tankards, a new engraving of the girlish Queen in her coronation
  robes.</p>

  <p>Young Morrison decided that Mary Showler was worth the trouble; a beauty,
  if ever there was one... a woman of taste, too; he liked her gown of deep
  indigo blue glaces silk, so neatly buttoned to the slim figure.</p>

  <p>She was aware of his approval and smiled; her toilette had cost her all
  she possessed in the world. She had never worn such clothes before, nothing
  but the plainest attire was permitted the teachers at Miss Le Moine's Academy
  for Young Ladies.</p>

  <p>"Well," she said, still smiling, "so far successful, Robert! Can we get
  any refreshment here? And when do you expect your sister?"</p>

  <p>He did not like that; she should not have forced an explanation when she
  ought to have understood the situation without a word. To gain time he rang
  the bell and ordered coffee, she, smiling always, considering him with
  furtive steadiness the awhile.</p>

  <p>They had been travelling together since morning and the tedious intimacy
  had not increased her esteem for him; she realised that she would have to be
  very careful, very patient. He was pampered, wilful, bad tempered, an
  indulged sensualist, and worse than any of this, she feared, with a real
  sinking of the heart, that he was stupid.</p>

  <p>But he was wealthy and the next-of-kin to a duke; Mary Showler made her
  smile soft and engaging as she poured the coffee and offered the cakes.</p>

  <p>"Are you not fatigued, Robert? The train was so wearisome! When shall we
  proceed?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I have to see to a few arrangements." He stared moodily into his
  coffee cup. She considered all he did and said with an intense, secret
  interest which she did not for a second mistake for the repulsions and
  attractions of love (though he had for her, on occasion, a strong physical
  appeal) she was anxious to know, to understand and to please him because he
  represented to her a unique chance of escaping an intolerable life and of
  achieving all she desired.</p>

  <p>He was a well-built, rather clumsy young man with thick, closely curling
  fair hair and whiskers, blunt features and pale grey eyes. He rose abruptly,
  with an uneasy grin, and said:</p>

  <p>"I shall be back in half an hour&mdash;pray command what you wish."</p>

  <p>She granted smiling leave; she had no cause to suspect his good faith; she
  was, indeed, quite sure of him, in the way a clever woman feels sure of a
  stupid man whose passions she has skilfully roused and never satisfied.</p>

  <p>As soon as she was alone she rose and looked in the dim flyblown mirror
  beside the window on which was a crisp pattern of frost.</p>

  <p>The wearisome travelling had not impaired her appearance; she had a gift
  of neatness. She was twenty-three and looked seventeen; delicately she took
  off the <i>poult de sole</i> bonnet that it had been such an extravagance for
  her to buy, and studied her head and face rising against that dingy
  background. This was the first time that she had been able to insist on, to
  emphasise her good looks; hitherto she had been always in eclipse, effaced, a
  nonentity.</p>

  <p>She was satisfied with her scrutiny, with her fine small features, long
  neck, silky hair falling in ringlets of a delicate auburn brown. Only her
  forehead was rather high, her lashes too light and her slightly prominent
  eyes, too steady, too brilliant. But she knew very well how to remedy these
  defects, how to drop the curls on her brow, how to veil her eyes...</p>

  <p>She tied the bonnet under her chin, arranged the black lace becomingly
  round the brim and returned to the table where a dirty copy of 'The Times'
  lay. She picked it up and read an account of the funeral of Napoleon I: the
  great Emperor's remains had just been received, with incredible pomp, in
  Paris.</p>

  <p>Mary Showler was passionately Bonapartist and loathed the bourgeois King
  whose elevation had ruined her family. Her face became discontented, almost
  violent in expression; there was so much of which she was capable and she had
  been so completely frustrated. To soothe herself she opened her reticule and
  drew out her lover's gift 'to amuse her on the journey,' 'Forget-me-not,' an
  elegant volume of prose, verse and fine engravings. Her glance caught an
  account of the miseries of governesses; she turned over the pages, she knew
  enough about that subject. Her gaze rested on the frontispiece&mdash;the
  young Queen again, a girl younger than herself, with the same childlike
  features. Mary Showler shut up the book. As she returned it impatiently to
  her reticule a silver thimble rolled out; this was wreathed with myosotis and
  the words 'Forget-me-not' in bright enamel; her lover had given it to her
  with the book and had seemed to congratulate himself on a pretty fancy. Her
  thanks had been as ardent as was now the scorn with which she thrust both
  these sentimental objects out of sight and returned to her newspaper, which
  she could no longer resist though it tormented her. She had the sheet on her
  knee when young Morrison returned with a cigar between his lips; she noted
  instantly that he did not remove this and that he had been drinking.</p>

  <p>"I wish I were in Paris now," she said; "a grand moment for a
  Bonapartist!" As he did not answer she continued with a rising accent of
  drama; "How I detest this Louis Philippe! I should like to pull him
  down!"</p>

  <p>He laughed. "You, Mary! That's rather ambitious, my dear! I think the King
  of the French is too firmly fixed! Besides," he added with sudden ill humour,
  "women have no need to be interested in such things."</p>

  <p>That warned her; she sat rebuked, crumpled the paper up, cast it down;
  nothing must irritate or bore him&mdash;until she had him safe.</p>

  <p>"Has your sister arrived?" she asked sweetly.</p>

  <p>"No." He looked at her with a slight defiance. "Perhaps she won't
  come."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Mary Showler, "what are we going to do? We can't stay here
  together." She urged his silence. "Perhaps I could get a room somewhere in
  the village? But surely your sister will come? You said, Robert, that you
  could rely on her."</p>

  <p>"And you thought, of course, that you could rely on me?"</p>

  <p>"Of course." Her voice was tender; she tried to soothe his obvious
  discontent; no doubt he was vexed by his sister's defection, and so was she,
  but she concealed this: "Never mind&mdash;we can manage."</p>

  <p>Young Morrison caressed his tight, curly, blond whiskers.</p>

  <p>"I suppose so," he said sulkily.</p>

  <p>She waited, in an attitude of graceful abnegation, for his childish temper
  to pass; she was not really uneasy for she had never quite believed in the
  staunch loyalty of Lady Hayes that her brother had so often sworn to. Was it
  likely that an aristocrat would welcome a Mary Showler as a sister-in-law?
  No, the poor orphan had relied on herself; though she had had no help at all
  in the affair she believed she had managed very well from the first moment
  she had had the luck to attract the attention of Robert Morrison&mdash;she,
  demure in the Bath streets with her posse of pupils, he, idling in his
  Tilbury with a roving eye for a pretty female shape... secret meetings, a
  secret correspondence, a dramatic passion, a complete decorum, the man
  enmeshed until he proposed elopement, marriage...</p>

  <p>She had relied on all that he had promised her, not because she had much
  respect for his honesty, but because she knew he was infatuated. Therefore
  she had left everything for him. They were to be married to-morrow at St.
  Mary's, Paddington, where, he said, he had had the banns called&mdash;oh,
  quite safely, no one knew him, no one would think of looking for him in such
  an out of the way place... There would be a night to put in; they could not
  get from Bath to London in time for a marriage, but his favourite, his
  indulgent sister, Amy Hayes, would meet her and chaperone her till the
  wedding morning; afterwards, he had a really charming cottage ready for her
  at Twickenham...</p>

  <p>No need, Mary Showler thought, to upset these convenient agreeable plans
  because Lady Hayes had proved cowardly or false.</p>

  <p>"Where were we to have stayed?" she asked pleasantly. "You said you had
  found rooms for us with an old servant. Cannot I go there? It is getting late
  and really I cannot remain much longer, dear, in this common inn."</p>

  <p>She longed to comment on his cigar; odious to smoke in front of her! but
  she dared not object to anything&mdash;yet.</p>

  <p>"We'll have a little talk first, Mary." He spoke with clumsy abruptness,
  then lost patience. "Damn it, you make it deuced awkward!"</p>

  <p>"Do I?" She was meek, was sweet, but he suspected her, feared that she was
  intelligent. He knew that she was well educated, that might be ignored; but
  that shrewd flash in her gold eyes, that edge to her words, that curl to her
  lip! He did not want a vixen, a damned blue stocking; she was going to be
  clever and difficult. He was profoundly irritated; she ought to have shown
  alarm, confusion, there should have been tears, supplications by now. That
  mood he could have dealt with, but this poise, that erect head, that steady
  glance... equal to equal. All the brandy he had taken could not arm him
  against her. He cursed the extraordinary infatuation that had involved him
  with Mary Showler.</p>

  <p>"Look here," he blurted out, "you don't really think that I am going to
  marry you?"</p>

  <p>She did not lower her gaze. In a second she had taken in and tasted to the
  full the bitterness of her own lunatic mistake, and recovered her
  serenity.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;it stands to reason&mdash;confound it, you know who I
  am&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And you know who I am, penniless, defenceless&mdash;that makes it easy
  for you, Robert."</p>

  <p>He took, with clumsy eagerness, this opening.</p>

  <p>"If I do, it isn't because you told me. Your tale was all lies&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I told you there was a mystery, that I was quite alone&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Mystery!" He was glad to fasten this quarrel on her. "You said you were
  Mary Showler, your father an English doctor, and that your mother was a
  daughter of one of Bonaparte's marshals&mdash;ruined, of course&mdash;in
  exile, all the rest of it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Stop!" She rose, checking his stupid triumph. "What has this to do with
  our marriage?" He frowned at her coolness. "You don't intend to marry
  me?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Why all these falsehoods, then?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose you expected some consideration for your damned
  delicacy&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why are you treating me like this? What do you want from me? What have
  you found out about me?"</p>

  <p>These questions and the manner in which she delivered them revealed her as
  the powerful personality he had always suspected her to be. Intensely
  annoyed, he replied:</p>

  <p>"Your mother was never married, no need for you to be."</p>

  <p>"Ah, so you found out that? Made enquiries?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not a fool, my dear."</p>

  <p>"No, I have been the fool." She sat down and shaded her face with her
  hand; she was in a terrible situation and did not see how she could extricate
  herself. Her limbs trembled from shock and the effort she made to maintain
  her control and for a moment rage at her own folly consumed her. She had not
  had much experience, but she had read, observed, deeply and she ought not to
  have been deceived like a girl from a convent. Vanity had misled her; it is
  so easy for a woman to over-estimate the force of the passion she
  inspires.</p>

  <p>As she sat there, her face hidden by her frivolous bonnet and her slim
  hand, she was calculating rapidly, desperately&mdash;but her attitude seemed
  one of complete, miserable defeat, and though she was not a person easily to
  inspire pity nor he one to feel it, he was touched by a certain compassion
  for the woman whom he had so cleverly caught.</p>

  <p>He put his cigar into his coffee cup and crossed over to her.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Mary, I'm sorry if I spoke unkindly&mdash;you know I'm fond of
  you&mdash;I meant all I said&mdash;except the marriage&mdash;and you ought to
  have guessed."</p>

  <p>"Ought I?" She dropped her hand, but did not raise her face. "Why, then,
  did you trouble to mention marriage to me?" This was the sort of answer he
  did not like; it was detestable for a woman to be logical.</p>

  <p>"You may take it as a compliment, I suppose, my dear&mdash;I thought you
  wanted to at least keep up appearances&mdash;and you can't blame me for
  playing your own game, for you told me a lot of nonsense about yourself."</p>

  <p>She did not reply, and he continued, half ill-tempered, half conciliatory,
  to justify himself; she paid no heed to his arguments, but what did impress
  her was his tone. At Bath he had always treated her as a gentlewoman, now he
  definitely spoke to an inferior, a creature already declassé, of the
  <i>demimonde</i>. Anger at her own folly merged into unspeakable anger at his
  insolence, yet she knew that, in his own estimation, he was being
  generous.</p>

  <p>"Don't be sulky, Mary, and spoil everything. There isn't another woman
  I've ever met for whom, I'd take the trouble I've taken for you."</p>

  <p>"The trouble?" She raised her head and looked at him. "Was it so difficult
  to tell a few lies?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, come now, I've been after you for weeks." Resentment at her coolness
  goaded him into adding: "You were supposed to be fond of me, weren't you?
  Seems to me that all you were thinking of was the advantages you were hoping
  for&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She easily extricated herself from this.</p>

  <p>"I was prepared to be your wife, Robert&mdash;I don't know I'm prepared to
  be any man's mistress." She rose, unable any longer to control her violent
  wrath. "You offer me this vulgar&mdash;this bitter insult&mdash;then expect
  me to still be&mdash;fond of you?"</p>

  <p>Young Morrison was impressed; she had, in that moment of stung pride, the
  lure of the unattainable. She was really lovely, flushed with a fever of
  passion, and he wanted her; wanted to tame her, break her, leave her... but
  that last, not for a long while yet; she would make a fine show before his
  friends. He took her wrists and began to woo her, thickly, insistently; he
  was in earnest, as he had been in earnest at Bath.</p>

  <p>Mary Showler stood rigid, not listening, her head turned aside. She earned
  forty pounds a year, in eighteen months she had saved twenty pounds; it had
  all been spent on the clothes she wore. There were five shillings in her
  purse, she had nothing else in the world. Her sole relative was her
  grandfather, a fierce, bitter, penurious old man who had already told her
  that she could starve for all he cared. In leaving Miss Le Moine's
  establishment in such a manner she had lost her character; in what way
  besides teaching could she earn even a pittance?</p>

  <p>She was roused from these bitter reflections by the young man dropping her
  hands and exclaiming violently:</p>

  <p>"Why don't you answer? What have you got to say?"</p>

  <p>She looked vaguely at him.</p>

  <p>"What am I supposed to answer? I did not hear what you said."</p>

  <p>She knew that she ought to soothe, to flatter Robert Morrison even now,
  but she had not sufficient self-control to do this, and he for a moment
  almost lost his complacency before her cold hostility.</p>

  <p>He recovered himself with a flare of temper.</p>

  <p>"Very well, I'll leave you here. No doubt you'll find your way back to the
  paths of virtue without my help&mdash;"</p>

  <p>At that she forced herself to say:</p>

  <p>"I am very cold. And tired. I have had a great shock. You must forgive me
  if I am rather&mdash;stupid."</p>

  <p>This confession of weakness and the sight of that charming head as she
  flung off her bonnet, restored his good humour. She was a prize and worth an
  effort, and, after all, she had taken it pretty well, no hysterics, nor
  reproaches, not a single tear; he had got off lightly. As he rang the bell he
  was congratulating himself that he knew how to manage a woman.</p>

  <p>His haughty orders to the waiter got lamp and fire hastily lit, wine and
  food on the table and the announcement that the best bedroom had been warmed
  and aired for "your honour if your honour is staying the night."</p>

  <p>"Yes, we'll stay," said Robert Morrison. "We have missed the train and my
  wife is tired."</p>

  <p>He ordered more brandy, and, as soon as it came, drank eagerly; warmth
  began to spread from the fire. Mary Showler drank a glass of sherry, took off
  her shawl and held her hands to the flames. She knew that she ought to refuse
  this man's company with horror, to fly from him at once, anywhere, but she
  remained in the easy chair by the fire, sipping another glass of sherry,
  eating bread, ham and macaroons, and thinking deeply; her childlike features
  did not betray the agonised bitterness of her thoughts.</p>

  <p>Protected by the company of the waiter, Robert Morrison made a good meal
  and emptied his glass every time it was replenished. Mary Showler stole a
  look now and then at his thick red neck with the dusting of blond hair, at
  his blunt, handsome features, at his heavy, robust body in the fashionable
  clothes; a brute, who had behaved to her like a scoundrel, but she did not
  regard him wholly with repugnance. He was better company than Miss Le Moine
  or her pupils. Even silent, absorbed in his meal he pleased her more than did
  the affections of feminine gentility.</p>

  <p>When he had finished and the table was cleared, he approached her in
  smiling good humour and asked her if she had made up her mind?</p>

  <p>"About what, Robert?"</p>

  <p>"Don't put me off, there's a good creature&mdash;look here, who are
  you?"</p>

  <p>"All I told you was true, except that my parents weren't married&mdash;my
  grandfather was one of Napoleon's officers&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But not a marshal, eh? Never mind, what's your name?"</p>

  <p>"Did you not remind me that I was nameless? I was christened Lucille, my
  mother was a Mademoiselle Clery. My father, till he died, gave me a good
  education. I took an English name for teaching, that of an ancestress.
  Despite me, as you will," she added. "I have never been treated before as you
  have treated me."</p>

  <p>He ignored that.</p>

  <p>"Well, Mary Showler, or Lucille Clery, I think you are much too smart and
  pretty to be a miserable governess and I mean to treat you very
  well&mdash;I'll give you an apartment in Paris and a handsome allowance. You
  can have a cabriolet and keep a maid&mdash;I shan't marry till I can help
  it&mdash;come, I really want you and you could do no better&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He took hold of her, muttering some endearments, pulling her close. His
  breath, tainted by tobacco and spirits, was on her face, and she felt the
  full contact of his body, powerful, warm, full of strength and passion. This
  was not displeasing to her after a narrow, cloistered life, excluded from all
  touch of masculinity. She was conscious of a certain relief to her agony in
  this embrace of the man who had caused it. At last her fatigue, her rage, her
  shame melted into tears; she was shaken by sobs in his arms and he was
  gratified. This was true feminine surrender; his caresses became quick,
  violent, he muttered promises that were quite sincere; he meant to spend a
  lot of money on her. For a while she endured this, took comfort in this. But
  she was icy proud, strictly bred, not sensual, not in love with him; she
  stifled her tears as rage and humiliation surged uppermost in her heart, and
  wrenched away the thick fingers fondling her throat, her ears, her curls, her
  breasts.</p>

  <p>"I can't&mdash;I can't," she muttered, shuddering violently and turning
  away. "I won't be treated like this&mdash;" She added something in French
  that he sensed was an expression of hatred. Startled and disgusted, the young
  man drew back; was she such a prize? Her features were distorted, and her
  vivid repugnance chilled and offended him. He, too, mustered some
  dignity.</p>

  <p>"As you please. I've never forced a woman. Good-bye, if you like. If you
  change your mind I shall be upstairs."</p>

  <p>He left her, making an effort over the lurch in his gait. Mary Showler sat
  down before the opal globe of the lamp that cast a circle of light over the
  dirty cups, the stubbed out cigar. Through her humiliation she tried to see
  the advantages... What had he offered her? Paris, a carriage, a maid, a
  'handsome allowance'; no one else had ever offered her anything at all. She
  liked Paris, Tortoni, the Maison d'Or, the opera, the theatre, in the
  <i>demimonde</i> she might, surely, have some success, throw over, perhaps,
  Morrison and find some other man more clever, more influential... yet it was
  detestable to accept less than marriage, to become an outcast at this fool's
  bidding!</p>

  <p>But the alternative? To return to the slavery that was called teaching,
  classed with the housekeeper, the lady's maid, keyed down to vapid, sub-acid
  feminine gentilities and futilities! Mary Showler wished to attach herself to
  men's destinies, to their passions, their splendours, their vices.</p>

  <p>She glanced up at the portrait of the young Queen&mdash;a silly vacant
  face with pale full eyes and a baby mouth, too like her own, she thought ...
  what luck some women had, what luck!</p>

  <p>She thrust her fingers into her fine ringlets; the heat of the lamp was on
  her flushed face, the smell of the paraffin in her nostrils. Fatigue and
  grief began to overcome her anger, her shame.</p>

  <p>The man upstairs would be kind to her if she was submissive; he desired
  her if he did not love her. It was better to be degraded by a carnal passion
  than to be ignored; of what use was this chastity, this honour she had been
  told to rate so high?</p>

  <p>Aloud she asked herself: "What use?"</p>

  <p>A woman must never give her body except as the final gift of a life-long,
  a perfect love. Who was going to love Mary Showler like that? A bastard
  orphan, penniless, friendless... young Morrison's behaviour had taught her
  what she might expect from gentlemen; she could not bear to think of any
  union with one who was not a gentleman. "It was cruel to educate me better
  than my birth." The sense of her great loneliness overwhelmed her; no one to
  help, no one to care, many to scold, to mock, to condemn; she began to think
  with relief of the man waiting upstairs, to wish for his brutal caresses that
  would at least stun thought.</p>

  <p>She rose, picked up her bonnet, her tartan scarf, her shawl, her reticule,
  went out into the brown varnished passage. A waiter, yawning, was coming out
  of the coffee-room opposite; he seemed surprised to see her. Through the open
  door behind him she saw the bleak face of a clock; it was far later than she
  had thought, her trance-like musing must have been very long. Robert
  Morrison, she reflected instantly, had not come back to urge her
  decision.</p>

  <p>"Has my husband gone out?"</p>

  <p>"No, Madam, he is upstairs&mdash;your room is that with the brass knocker
  at the head of the stairs&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I can find it. Is there a little closet or chamber that I could have to
  myself?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, Madam, that at the side."</p>

  <p>"Thank you." Her air of authority quelled his curiosity, but his dull eyes
  stared after her as if he guessed something of her sordid story.</p>

  <p>Mary Showler went upstairs, passed the door with the brass knocker and
  entered the one beside it, a cold room with white everywhere, walls, bed
  cover, curtains. She took off her shawl, shuddering, combed her hair, bathed
  her face and stood still a moment to gather her courage, staring at herself
  in a mirror that hung beneath a pink china plaque showing John Wesley
  preaching, then went softly and raised the brass knocker. As there was no
  reply, she entered.</p>

  <p>It was a large room; a fire was burning low on the hearth, a lamp, turned
  down, was on a table by the window; an unstrapped valise lay on the floor.
  She put her hand before her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Robert, I've come."</p>

  <p>No reply; she advanced to the large bed from which the curtains were
  looped back; he was lying there, fully dressed, asleep.</p>

  <p>Mary Showler crossed to the lamp and turned up the flame, returned to the
  bed and tried to wake the young man.</p>

  <p>His face was congested, he was snoring heavily; bottles and glasses were
  on the night table. She saw that he was not asleep, but drunk.</p>

  <p>He had not cared enough to keep sober to wait for her; disappointed at her
  delay, he had drunk himself into insensibility; first his love and then his
  lust had left her cheated, bereft. He was not able to receive the sacrifice
  she had, at such cost to her pride, come to make: she could not even forget
  her torments in his coarse embraces. The affair had become worse than
  tragic&mdash;ridiculous.</p>

  <p>Her desire for the sensational, the dramatic was frustrated; she had meant
  to fling herself into his arms with at least simulated passion...</p>

  <p>She bent over him with an expression of loathing that sharpened her
  features painfully; how ugly he was in his stupor! She marked every defect in
  his face. The thick hair and whiskers were straw colour on the purplish skin,
  his mouth had fallen open and was twitching; to her he was vile, obscene.</p>

  <p>"You miserable blackguard," she whispered, "<i>sale bête</i>&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She withdrew, hastened to the other room, panting, trembling, tied on her
  bonnet, flung on scarf and shawl, snatched up her reticule, remembered ...
  only five shillings...</p>

  <p>She was back in his room again, swift and concentrated in her actions. His
  merino coat hung over a chair; she went through the pockets&mdash;some
  guineas in a beaded purse. She took these and fled, hovered for a moment on
  the wide landing till the passage below was empty, then descended, escaped
  unobserved and was out in the raw damp of the December night. "I think," said
  Lady Anfield, "that she would be most suitable."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"Madame Faustin seemed very impressed by her. It is so
  difficult to find the right person!"</p>

  <p>The two ladies smiled with vague amiability at each other; they were not
  very interested in the subject they discussed but it was one of those rather
  tiresome services to a mutual friend that cannot be refused. Madame Clapisson
  Faustin, the wife of the French ambassador, had asked Mrs. Coombe Wade to
  find a governess for a family of her acquaintance and the Englishwoman
  believed there was an excellent person about to leave the employ of Lady
  Anfield; Madame Faustin had herself seen this young woman with her charges
  and had highly approved her appearance and behaviour.</p>

  <p>But Mrs. Coombe Wade felt a certain responsibility that urged her to make
  further enquiries.</p>

  <p>"An exceptional person is required&mdash;there are five children and the
  mother can do nothing, social obligations, you know, and ill health, then the
  establishment is really magnificent! One requires someone with
  authority&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle Debelleyme has that&mdash;she is very good with servants, a
  wonderful gift for keeping order and discipline&mdash;with children,
  too&mdash;she really takes all the trouble off one's shoulders!"</p>

  <p>"Yet she is leaving you?"</p>

  <p>"Well, the girls are almost too old&mdash;besides&mdash;"</p>

  <p>As Lady Anfield left her sentence vague Mrs. Coombe Wade hinted:</p>

  <p>"She did not stay long in her last place, either?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, with the Brentwells? You see, those were boys and soon had to have a
  tutor."</p>

  <p>Determined to do her duty the other lady persisted.</p>

  <p>"Isn't she rather good-looking?"</p>

  <p>Lady Anfield appeared surprised, a trifle uneasy.</p>

  <p>"No one has noticed it, I assure you she is very discreet and
  decorous&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But this air of authority? Isn't that rather out of place in this sort of
  person?"</p>

  <p>Lady Anfield hastened to explain.</p>

  <p>"Oh, she never presumes, she is most respectful and agreeable, I'm
  sure&mdash;it isn't an air of authority either, quite&mdash;difficult to
  explain! She gets things done, without any fuss."</p>

  <p>"Who is she?" asked Mrs. Coombe Wade directly.</p>

  <p>"Well, really, one hardly troubles, does one? I mean I had excellent
  credentials from the Brentwells and they had a strong recommendation from
  Lady Tryon, and I believe before that she was in an Academy at
  Bedford&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She smiled good-naturedly at her friend, hoping she would turn the tedious
  conversation, but Mrs. Coombe Wade, who did not wish to disoblige the French
  Ambassadress, was firm.</p>

  <p>"I must know something, Peggy dear, they rely on me&mdash;I am to engage
  the young woman, you see."</p>

  <p>"Well, she is a Parisienne&mdash;but there is a romantic mystery, yet
  nothing to her discredit, you see"&mdash;Lady Anfield lowered her pleasant
  voice&mdash;"her grandfather was one of Napoleon's <i>maréchals</i>&mdash;a
  Baron of the Empire, I think, and, of course, he lost everything at the
  Restoration&mdash;her mother was Italian, or was it Corsican?&mdash;anyhow,
  of a noble family, but ruined; she has been brilliantly educated, and is much
  more refined and well bred than these people usually are&mdash;"</p>

  <p>This was vague, but Mrs. Coombe Wade was satisfied.</p>

  <p>"She sounds a jewel, Peggy&mdash;I suppose you have never found any fault
  with her?"</p>

  <p>"Never. Her position is peculiar, she has no relatives&mdash;they are in
  exile in Italy, I believe, and that is rather an advantage&mdash;I think her
  name is assumed, that of an ancestor, but as no exception could be taken to
  her in any way, I did not object." And, anxious to end the matter, Lady
  Anfield added, "Would you like to see her yourself? She is leaving me at the
  end of the week."</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, if you please&mdash;then she might wait on Madame Faustin and
  conclude everything."</p>

  <p>With relief Lady Anfield rang the bell and requested the footman to "send
  Mademoiselle Debelleyme at once."</p>

  <p>It was a handsome, ornate room in which the two ladies discussed the
  governess, looking on to Belgrave Square. Lady Anfield and her friend were
  young matrons, dressed expensively and without taste. Lives of busybody
  idleness had given an expression at once vacant and inquisitive to their
  amiable faces; their experience was even more limited than their
  understanding, but they were adepts in all the conventions of their
  class.</p>

  <p>While they chattered vaguely the governess appeared.</p>

  <p>"Ah, Mademoiselle, won't you sit down? Mrs. Coombe Wade would like to
  speak to you&mdash;this is Mademoiselle Debelleyme, dear&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The governess seated herself and waited, with downcast eyes; her demeanour
  was perfect, respectful without being servile; her personality was completely
  effaced in her post; she was the governess in a rich gentleman's
  establishment and could never make the mistake of asserting that she was a
  human being. Mrs. Coombe Wade looked at her and approved; she was pleased to
  note also that she had been mistaken in thinking the young woman
  good-looking&mdash;her features were insignificant, her hair was pulled back
  unbecomingly from a forehead that was too high, and pinned in an
  old-fashioned manner at the back of her head, her clumsy but neat dress of
  dark merino was buttoned in a pelerine up to her chin, and its heavy folds
  quite disguised any graces her figure might have possessed; yet she had that
  distinction, that dignity that an aristocrat would like to see in a
  dependant&mdash;surely, thought Mrs. Coombe Wade, anxiously, she was the very
  person for whom Madame Faustin was so eagerly searching? Such excellent
  testimonials, too, an exquisite flower painter, a good musician.</p>

  <p>There was a short pause while one lady scrutinised the governess and the
  other furtively yawned.</p>

  <p>Mademoiselle Debelleyme bore the silence with equanimity, and listened,
  without a change of attitude, while Mrs. Coombe Wade stated her case.</p>

  <p>"I am looking for a governess for a friend of Madame Faustin. As you are
  leaving Lady Anfield and she very kindly recommends you and I hear that you
  have other good testimonials I wondered if you might be suitable."</p>

  <p>"What is the situation, please?" The governess, still keeping her lids
  modestly down, spoke in a very low, but distinct voice.</p>

  <p>"With the Duchesse Montlosier du Boccage&mdash;you know of her, of
  course?"</p>

  <p>"It is an historic name."</p>

  <p>"Yes, indeed. The Duchess is a daughter of Maréchal Frediani, you know,
  the victor of Warsaw, and immensely rich. She keeps a very splendid
  establishment in the Rue St. Honoré&mdash;the Duke is <i>Chevalier
  d'honneur</i> to the Duchesse D'Orleans and an intimate at Court&mdash;you
  understand that you would have a very envied post!"</p>

  <p>"What would it be, precisely?"</p>

  <p>"There are five children&mdash;two boys; there is an under-governess, two
  nurses, the children have their own maids&mdash;you: see, Mademoiselle, that
  an exceptional person is required!"</p>

  <p>Gently the governess raised her head, and asked:</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Coombe Wade was not a sensitive woman, but she was conscious of
  something in mademoiselle's glance, revealed suddenly, that made her feel
  uneasy. Those eyes were such a peculiar colour, a clear gold, large, cold,
  yet compelling, as if a strong and frantic spirit stared from behind bars;
  but Mademoiselle Debelleyme looked down again and the vague impression
  passed.</p>

  <p>But the lady was slightly ruffled as she replied:</p>

  <p>"Well, it is a considerable responsibility&mdash;five little children of
  that rank&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There are, as always, the parents," remarked the governess, quietly.</p>

  <p>"Oh yes! But the Duchess does nothing; she is often ill, she has lost a
  number of children&mdash;besides, she must be continually at the
  Tuileries&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then I should have sole charge?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Coombe Wade was a little taken aback by this direct question.</p>

  <p>"I believe that the Duke directs the education of the children, I really
  don't know. Madame Faustin could tell you."</p>

  <p>Bored by this conversation but still good-natured. Lady Anfield
  interposed:</p>

  <p>"Why not wait on Madame Faustin, Mademoiselle, and find out what you wish
  to know?"</p>

  <p>"But, Lady Anfield," smiled the governess. "I don't think that I can
  accept this kind suggestion&mdash;I have almost engaged myself to teach
  music, French and painting at Miss Graham's Academy."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Coombe Wade was disappointed; she did not want to have to search
  further for a governess for her friend, and she was really impressed by the
  correct, icy and respectful demeanour of Mademoiselle Debelleyme.</p>

  <p>"Madame du Boccage offers a hundred pounds a year and your own apartment
  and full service. I believe this is better than you have had before."</p>

  <p>"Lady Anfield was good enough to pay me sixty pounds; I have been quite
  satisfied."</p>

  <p>"Surely you would like to return to Paris?"</p>

  <p>The governess smiled.</p>

  <p>"My family lost all with the Restoration," she remarked with an air of
  reserve. "I remain passionately attached to the memory of the
  Emperor&mdash;Paris under Bourbon rule has no attractions for me. I prefer
  exile."</p>

  <p>Both the ladies cherished a sentimental regard for Napoleon I, and thought
  this a very proper speech on the part of Mademoiselle Debelleyme, one, too,
  which gave her the dignity of a certain mystery. Mrs. Coombe Wade became more
  eager than ever to engage her services and began to press the advantages of
  this post in one of the most sumptuous establishments of France...</p>

  <p>"Surely," objected the governess, "Madame du Boccage could find someone in
  Paris whom she could interview personally? Is it not rather peculiar for her
  to entrust so delicate a mission even to the most intimate of friends?"</p>

  <p>Again Mrs. Coombe Wade was at a loss; reluctantly, vaguely, she
  admitted:</p>

  <p>"It is not very easy, I understand from Madame Faustin, to satisfy Madame
  du Boccage&mdash;she thought perhaps that a person used to English
  life&mdash;" Becoming further baffled by the upward flash of the governess'
  clear eyes, she added weakly:</p>

  <p>"There have been six governesses in the last two years&mdash;so you
  see&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That Madame la Duchesse is difficult?" finished Mademoiselle gently.</p>

  <p>"No." Mrs. Coombe Wade made a gallant recovery, "She is the most charming,
  the most generous of women! But an exceptional person is required&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do you think I should suit Madame du Boccage?"</p>

  <p>Lady Anfield rose, resolved to end the interview. "Oh, I'm sure!" she
  smiled. "I should think it over, Mademoiselle&mdash;and then you could see
  Madame Faustin, couldn't you? A hundred a year is quite exceptional, isn't
  it? It was so kind of Mrs. Coombe Wade to think of you, wasn't it?"</p>

  <p>The governess was well trained to know when she was dismissed; she rose
  instantly.</p>

  <p>"I am deeply obliged, Lady Anfleld. If I might have till tomorrow? Just to
  think over my plans? Thank you. I am so grateful, Mrs. Coombe Wade. I hope
  never to disappoint your kindness."</p>

  <p>Something in her carriage as she crossed the long room to the heavy door
  roused again that vague feeling of uneasiness in the mind of Mrs. Coombe
  Wade&mdash;but she could not name even to herself what quality in
  mademoiselle provoked this, and Lady Anfield said decisively:</p>

  <p>"She really is a prize, dear, you must persuade her to accept."</p>

  <p>Mademoiselle Debelleyme had immediately decided to take the position
  offered in the establishment of Madame du Boccage; her hesitation had been
  only assumed in order to increase her value. She longed to return to Paris
  where she had not been for eight years, and the post seemed one that was in
  every way more desirable than anything that had come her way before. Not that
  she hoped to remain long in the Faubourg St. Honoré; she never remained long
  anywhere; despite her excellent credentials, her perfect behaviour, her
  talents, her unimpeachable character, no one wanted to keep her. A year with
  Lady Tryon's delicate little girl, then the child had been sent to Italy and
  mademoiselle had not been asked to accompany her. Teaching at various
  Academies for Young Ladies, Clapham, Highgate, Bedford, a few months at each,
  then, under some perfectly reasonable excuse, her place had been filled by
  another. After that the Brentwells, two years with three little boys and
  dismissed to give way for a tutor; now Lady Anfield, who had suddenly and
  vaguely found her girls "too old for a governess." Nowhere did mademoiselle
  attach herself and she knew now exactly what her utmost endeavours and
  exertions could obtain for her, which was the position of an upper servant in
  a large house, a position which could only be maintained by complete
  abnegation, rigid self-discipline, tedious toil and an attitude of exact
  decorum and humility.</p>

  <p>She knew why she had lost her various posts when some women remained with
  one family for a lifetime; she had a strange influence over children, roused
  their passionate attachment and loyalty, and the mothers, lazy and careless
  as they were, became jealous. She was able to make herself obeyed by servants
  and, after a while, her influence, very subtle but powerful, permeated any
  household in which she stayed. She had been very careful, trained herself to
  complete effacement, been tactful, discreet, useful, patient; but the candour
  of the children's affection had always betrayed her, she became too
  important, she must go.</p>

  <p>Oh, nothing to complain of&mdash;she might have excellent credentials! Her
  employers, with the most kindly intentions, praised her warmly&mdash;but she
  left one place after another with the laments of her little charges in her
  ears as her sole reward.</p>

  <p>Yet in much she had been lucky; the various oblique lies she had
  insinuated about her origin had gone down very well; Lucille Clery, Mary
  Showler, had easily become Lucille Debelleyme, she had even lived down the
  folly of that elopement from Bath; Miss Le Moine's testimonial lay with
  others in her reticule. A telegram had summoned her to her grandfather's
  death-bed, she had fled in such haste and distress that she had forgotten to
  even leave a message. Did Miss Le Moine believe this? She had regretted she
  could not receive Miss Showler again in her Academy, but she had not refused
  a handsome certificate of character.</p>

  <p>Robert Morrison was dead, killed in the hunting field; the reading of that
  news in the papers had given Mademoiselle Debelleyme the only real pleasure
  she had known in five years.</p>

  <p>She went up to her room in the gloomy Belgravia mansion. A dull, sunless
  apartment, shabbily furnished with cast-out articles from the other rooms, a
  hard bed, a tarnished mirror and faded curtains of an ugly plum-coloured rep.
  The view was over backyards, basements and barred kitchen windows. The
  governess sat at the window and looked with loathing at this dismal
  prospect.</p>

  <p>She wondered how she existed from day to day, body and soul in invisible
  chains, her pride in fierce subjection, all her desires denied, no prospect
  whatever for the future; completely isolated, disdaining to make friends with
  servants, disdained by those above servants, forced to hide all her
  character, half her gifts, all her attractions; twenty-eight years old,
  immersed in resignation.</p>

  <p>"What is the use of existence on these terms? How do I find the strength
  to endure it?"</p>

  <p>Yet she knew; it was because of some lunatic hope that one day, by some
  miracle, something would occur to change her life into the extravagant, the
  fantastic, the passionate adventure she wished it to be. She deluded herself
  from day to day, knowing that she was doing so, yet not daring to face
  reality. To one situated like herself escape could only come through men and
  no man had shown himself ready to be her deliverer.</p>

  <p>Robert Morrison was dead; her brief affair with him was dead; but not
  buried. It lay corrupting in her soul, poisoning even her dreams. For five
  years she had, by hard work and a watchful discretion, maintained a position
  in aristocratic families, secured a bare if genteel living, but always
  ignored, a virtuous gentlewoman forbidden to the libertine, a pauper
  forbidden to the marrying man.</p>

  <p>She had never again met as bold a rake as Robert Morrison. Once or twice
  she had observed a licentious glance pass over her when, summoned to the
  drawing-room during a reception, she had played some young lady's
  accompaniment on the pianoforte, once or twice she had been insolently
  addressed in the street. On each occasion she had in her mind shudderingly
  rejected the advance. She did not demand an honourable love but Robert
  Morrison had taught her that she must have some gloss of elegancy over lust.
  She was eager to sell herself, but the purchaser must be delicately behaved,
  respect her pride, her fastidiousness; she could not again live through an
  experience like that of that night in the inn outside Paddington.</p>

  <p>Often after some bitter humiliation when her vanity, her ambition had
  refused to lie quiescent, she had reflected in despair: "I should be better
  off in a brothel."</p>

  <p>But her difficulty lay in the fact that she did not really know what a
  brothel was, where to find one, nor how to gain admittance if she did. Did
  one discover the address of a house of ill fame, knock and say: "Madame,
  permit me to help entertain your clients?" Did one creep out after dark, pull
  some man by the coat and whisper: "Take me somewhere where we shall be
  private?"</p>

  <p>There might be a stepping stone there to liberty, independence on the
  stage or as the kept woman of a rich man, "but I have no knowledge, no
  courage to face another Morrison&mdash;and worse."</p>

  <p>Constantly in the company of children or smugly respectable women the
  governess could know little of the world save from an avid but limited
  reading and the sordid gossip of servants.</p>

  <p>So she remained chaste, dainty, in person, habits, behaviour, but her
  thoughts ranged wide and the least of them would have profoundly shocked her
  employers.888</p>

  <p>Her experience with Robert Morrison had given her a disgust of sex and she
  was too absorbed in herself to dream of an ideal lover; so, naturally cold,
  she did not suffer from her enforced chastity, but she raged that she could
  not turn it to advantage before she was old... surely some man, somewhere,
  would for the sake of her lovely body, hidden under her ugly clothes, relieve
  her of her intolerable servitude? But where to find him?</p>

  <p>A cloud obscured the mournful pale blue above the ugly backs of the
  houses, a few drops of rain fell on the sooty sill of her window. She roused
  herself. She had the afternoon for her packing, her pupils were out with an
  aunt. She turned to her trunk, carefully folded her plain linen, her sombre
  dresses, her thick stockings and one or two rich and elaborate scraps of
  embroidery that she had worked herself.</p>

  <p>She would go to Paris&mdash;a hundred pounds a year, a sumptuous mansion;
  worth trying, but how long could she placate Madame du Boccage who had had
  six governesses in two years? Here obviously was a difficult, tyrannical,
  tiresome, spoilt woman, probably a peevish invalid&mdash;"but I might stay
  till I had found something else in Paris&mdash;Paris in the spring! Mon Dieu!
  There is life to be seen there&mdash;even from afar!"</p>

  <p>And surely in a ducal establishment she might hope to escape from some of
  the most degrading humiliations inflicted on her by her English
  employers&mdash;"Yes, darling, the peaches are rather bruised, you may offer
  one to mademoiselle&mdash;" "Oh, the concert will be very dull, mademoiselle
  must take you&mdash;" "These gloves are badly cut and Bennetts won't take
  them back, would you like them. Mademoiselle?" "No, dear, mademoiselle never
  has a headache, though it is my sweet child to think of it&mdash;she can very
  well go on reading to you"&mdash;or, most humiliating of all, "Mademoiselle,
  I think you should not wear that lace collar and brooch, I always insist on
  my governesses being most plainly attired."</p>

  <p>She dropped the lid of her trunk and stood reflecting on the faint
  possibilities offered by this new position&mdash;this new chance?&mdash;in
  Paris.</p>

  <p>And an ironic smile lifted her lip into an unpleasant expression. The
  governess' interview with Madame Faustin passed off very well. The great lady
  found the young woman modest, dignified, as agreeable as intelligent, and
  well bred. Mademoiselle Debelleyme left the French Embassy engaged as head
  governess in the establishment of Madame du Boccage, with three months'
  salary and her fare to Paris in her pocket.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

  <p class="first">There had been one little difficulty; the question of
  religion. The governess, bred a Roman Catholic, had become a Protestant to
  please her English employers, and Madame du Boccage was devote; but Madame
  Faustin was not and thought that the governess could quietly return to her
  early faith without any reference to her heretical lapse, and easily conform
  with Church observances sufficiently to satisfy her mistress; and the
  governess, who cared nothing for any creed, thought so too.</p>

  <p>She returned for the last time to the mansion in Belgravia; performed her
  final duties to her pupils, who were sullen and red-eyed because of her
  departure, and took leave of Lady Anfield, who vaguely congratulated her on
  her "splendid good luck".</p>

  <p>In the wide bedchamber of the little girls the governess knelt at prayers;
  the night lamp cast a soft light over the heavy furniture, the prints of
  religious subjects on the walls, the toys neatly stacked on the shelves, the
  straight beds with the dimity covers sprigged with roses. The children's
  heads were bowed in their hands, their well-brushed, pale yellow hair hung
  down over their white nightgowns which fell over their woollen shoes slipping
  off their pink heels.</p>

  <p>The governess knelt between them but her head was raised; she stared into
  the warm flickering shadows of the familiar room and she did not repeat the
  formula of the prayers even with her lips.</p>

  <p>The children loved her; that was her offence here. Probably it would
  always be her offence wherever she went. With children she was herself,
  vivid, amusing, possessed of a delicate understanding of childish minds, of
  the art of making the commonplace exciting, of banishing boredom, of soothing
  by firmness, by an exact order. She knew that she could make any child love
  her and she could love any child for the same reason that a blind beggar
  loves his dog; the animal does not know that his master is less than other
  men, and children did not know that Lucille Debelleyme was below other women,
  "only the governess." She set herself deliberately, carefully, to charm them,
  to win their respect, their devotion, and they responded instantly.
  Sometimes, as they grew older they became tainted by the world's opinion and
  realised that their fascinating companion was only a penniless dependent in
  their father's house; but with the little children she was always sure of her
  victory.</p>

  <p>The prayers over, the two girls embraced her with sobs, stammering over
  their good-byes. She soothed them gravely, tucked them in bed, stayed till
  they slept, then left them in charge of the nurse, who did not like her, and
  watched her departure with gratified malice.</p>

  <p>In her upper room the governess lit the candle and finished her packing.
  On top of all her other clothes she carefully placed a blue silk dress, a
  tartan scarf, a <i>gros de Naples</i> mantle, a bonnet with a black lace
  fall; in the bottom of the trunk was a copy of 'Forget-me-not' of 1840, and a
  silver thimble wreathed with pure blue flowers.</p>

  <p>She began to undress. The evening was warm; she had half raised the
  Holland blind and she could see the tiny lights in the windows of the backs
  of the houses across the yards. Above the ugly chimney-stacks a few stars
  showed a melancholy, remote sparkle.</p>

  <p>The governess took off her clothes and drew the curtains. She had locked
  the door and felt that she had escaped from the pompous house, from the
  people in it, from the routine of the day; she was no longer the governess
  but a woman. She dominated her shabby surroundings as she stood naked on the
  square of drugget by the bed; she had taken the pins out of her hair and it
  fell in natural ringlets to her waist, a lovely shining colour and
  texture.</p>

  <p>She arranged the mirror so that/she could see as much of her body as
  possible.</p>

  <p>"This is I, myself. All that I have. And I must hide it away, be ashamed
  of it. No one knows what I am like."</p>

  <p>Long, pale limbs, of firm line, a body in perfect harmony with the small
  classic-featured face, with hair fine as silk.</p>

  <p>She admired her hands, her feet that she tended so carefully, the
  smoothness of her skin, her full bosom, the slope of her waist and thighs. In
  the curve of her back were two brown moles.</p>

  <p>Moving the mirror from place to place she gravely surveyed herself; she
  was not thinking of any possible lover, there was nothing voluptuous in her
  pose or her gestures; she contemplated her own beauty because it gratified
  her pride, her self-respect, increased her value in her own eyes. Only by the
  convention of society was she less than other women.</p>

  <p>The candle was guttering; she extinguished it and the dark completed her
  sense of deliverance. Her cold eyes gazed gratefully into the blackness as
  she sat on the edge of the bed, her body freed from ugly garments, her mind
  from the necessities of servitude.</p>

  <p>The steamboat left Harwich on a bright, windy morning. Mademoiselle
  Debelleyme sat on deck; she had managed her affairs without haste or
  confusion, her purse was in her hand, her carpet bag by her side, she had
  seen her trunk on board, knotted her veil round her bonnet, drawn her shawl
  round her shoulders and sat at ease and leisure.</p>

  <p>She was the only female travelling alone. She watched contemptuously the
  helpless disorder of such other women as there were, how they clamoured for
  the protection of father, husband, brother, making a parade of foolishness
  and helplessness, how they lamented the distress of the voyage, and retired
  to the cabins immediately with smelling salts, eau-de-Cologne and toilet
  vinegar. Possessed of perfect health she was not disturbed by the motion of
  the ship and her spirits rose when England dropped out of sight on the
  horizon.</p>

  <p>She disembarked easily, found her place in the Paris train and felt all
  her excitement sink suddenly; even the unusual speed, the spinning past of
  the Norman orchards, the puffs of whirling smoke crossing the coach window
  could not distract her fatigue. Her companions were dull and soon slept, the
  seat was uncomfortable, she felt imprisoned in this box. She ate some cake
  and an apple; her head began to ache, she took off her bonnet and closed her
  eyes; half drowsy, she tried to plan for the future to the exasperating beat
  of the engine.</p>

  <p>How long shall I stay in Paris? Surely something will arise. Anything
  would be preferable to returning to England. My grandfather, too, is living
  at St. Cloud, the miser! I believe he has money hidden away, surely he might
  do something for me! Would it be any use appealing to my father's people? No!
  No! They would never acknowledge me. I must remember I am a good Catholic
  now. Shall I possibly have a chance to go to the Opera, the theatre, a fine
  reception, a concert, the Tuileries? Of course not, stop dreaming, stop
  dreaming, Lucille Clery, you fool! Will some man want me as a wife or a
  mistress? How contrive, with complete decorum, to attract any one? And I
  won't be despised, I'm glad that Robert Morrison is dead, dead, dead. Was he
  drunk when he fell from his horse? No one will notice me, I don't look pretty
  in the hideous clothes I have to wear, I'm always effaced. Why was I given
  that genteel education? Shall I ever fall in love? All men have a look of
  Robert Morrison.</p>

  <p>I must recall all Madame Faustin told me of Madame du
  Boccage&mdash;devote. Mon Dieu! She was eighteen when she married; she has
  had nine children in fifteen years, four are dead&mdash;she is, then,
  thirty-three, not so much older than I. What a different life! What is it
  really like to have children? I should think it would be a sort of ecstasy to
  have your body used.</p>

  <p>Nine children. M. du Boccage is even younger than she&mdash;he was only
  seventeen when she saw him at a ball and vowed that no other should be her
  husband&mdash;she had a dowry of two million, a great name, she could pick
  and choose. Sweetly romantic, Madame Faustin said, and their devotion a
  byword in France. I've seen enough of these affectionate families, it's like
  being cold and looking at a fire through a window.</p>

  <p>How easy, with all that money and power, to be happy!</p>

  <p>But Madame du Boccage is difficult&mdash;no one has stayed with her, what
  is the trouble? Shall I be able to overcome it?</p>

  <p>To live in the Faubourg St. Honoré! With one of the greatest families of
  France! I must please her, if only for a while&mdash;</p>

  <p>The governess could not escape from the trammels of decorum; she had
  scarcely begun to breathe the clear exciting air of Paris before she was
  accosted by an elderly couple who introduced themselves as Monsieur and
  Madame Santerre. They had been sent by Madame du Boccage to look after the
  governess for the night, until she was sufficiently rested and composed after
  her travel to present herself in the Faubourg St. Honoré.</p>

  <p>The tired, disarrayed young woman accepted this considerate attention with
  due gratitude; but she would have liked this one evening in Paris to herself,
  at an inn, or even with her grandfather, where she could be outspoken, at
  least.</p>

  <p>But she was shepherded to the respectable home of the Santerres; they had
  both been in the service of Madame du Boccage and were full of tales of her
  bounty, sweetness, domestic virtues, modesty and piety, as well as of her
  riches and splendour.</p>

  <p>Mademoiselle Debelleyme listened with an appreciative smile and downcast
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"But it has not been easy to suit Madame with a governess?" she suggested,
  quietly.</p>

  <p>"Ah, Mademoiselle understands that Madame is most careful, devoted as she
  is to her children she requires an exceptional person!"</p>

  <p>The governess had heard that expression several times before; was she the
  exceptional person Madame du Boccage required?</p>

  <p>"There is a Mademoiselle Broc who has been in entire charge&mdash;but she
  had not the authority; she will remain, but under you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Mon Dieu," thought the governess, "I shall have to placate this creature,
  too! How spiteful she will be at being displaced!"</p>

  <p>During the modest supper the Santerres continued to praise the
  establishment in the Faubourg St. Honoré; through the welter of simple-minded
  adulation the governess contrived to extract one or two useful facts.</p>

  <p>Madame du Boccage was a Corsican; on the death of her father she would
  inherit even greater wealth than she at present enjoyed. M. du Boccage had
  just come into the title and been elected a member of the Chamber of Peers.
  He was an intimate friend of the Royal Princes, M. de Nemours, M. de
  Montpensier, M. de Joinville... but he was not so often at Court now as he
  was occupied in restoring the famous Chateau of Javiaux du Boccage near Melun
  which he had recently inherited&mdash;but usually the family went for the
  summer to Locroi in Normandy where Madame had an estate, or to Dieppe for the
  bathing...</p>

  <p>The governess thought: "No doubt I shall have left them by the holidays,"
  nor was she interested in M. du Boccage. The fathers of her charges had never
  concerned her in the least; they had always remained strangers whom she had
  hardly seen. "I shall have to deal with the mistress, this other governess,
  the children, the servants&mdash;eh, well, one does one's best!"</p>

  <p>She was given a neat room high above the darkness and rumble of Paris. A
  crucifix was over the bed, a book of religious meditations on the table; the
  governess leaned eagerly from the window into the spring night.</p>

  <p>She loved this city in which she had been born and educated, the old
  quays, the dark scented churches, the narrow streets of the Isle, the
  luxurious gardens in front of high palaces, the quarters where the
  fashionable shops and restaurants flourished. She knew Paris very well from
  the outside, she was at home in this country, her own country, among the
  people and the places which had formed her obscure origin.</p>

  <p>Kneeling before the open trunk, Mademoiselle Debelleyme took out her one
  silk gown which had been worn once and then hidden for five years. Out of
  date, but not so markedly; she could adjust it. Paris had already excited
  her; she would not appear in the Faubourg St. Honoré in the dowdy merino that
  pleased the English gentlewomen. Madame du Boccage was Parisienne, she would
  not expect a fright, she must be above the petty jealousy of frumps like Lady
  Anfield.</p>

  <p>Fingering the stiff silk made furtively by the Bath dressmaker, the
  governess' mind went back to her sordid elopement, and, curiously, to the
  impetuous exclamation she had made to Robert Morrison. Reading of the funeral
  of the Emperor she had allowed her scorn of Louis Philippe to find
  expression, and had cried: "I wish I could pull him down!"</p>

  <p>She smiled bitterly at this recollection; what a fool to think she could
  have any hand in public affairs! Here she was, in Paris, not as the Hon. Mrs.
  Morrison, who might have meddled in politics, not as a successful courtesan
  who might have pulled strings, but as a dependant in the household of one of
  the Orleans King's courtiers.</p>

  <p>The governess knew contemporary politics as she knew Paris, thoroughly,
  from the outside; she had learnt from her grandfather a sentimental and
  selfish devotion to Napoleon I; it was true that her family had been ruined
  and scattered at the Restoration of the Bourbons. And if she hated the
  Legitimists she scorned more deeply the cadet branch of the Royal House which
  had cringed to the people, paraded liberal ideas and risen to a restricted
  power through the ruin of the rightful Kings.</p>

  <p>Louis Philippe D'Orleans had fought the Royalists at Valmy, erased the
  Lilies from his escutcheon, and. Prince of the Blood, son of the man who had
  voted for the death of his cousin, Louis XVI, effected the "bon bourgeois,"
  the citizen monarch, and meanly named himself Louis Philippe as if he was a
  petty Prince of Italy or Germany. The governess would very willingly have
  seen him chased from Paris amid the uproar of yet another revolution; she had
  been pleased to observe in a print-seller's window as she drove from the
  station a caricature of the stout monarch, with his close whiskers and neat
  curly toupet as a huge pear!</p>

  <p>She must think of her own affairs; she needed gloves, shoes, a veil. She
  must be up early to purchase these before she waited on Madame du
  Boccage.</p>

  <p>Weariness overcame her, she slid cautiously into the bed and slept beneath
  the dark outline of the cheap crucifix.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The Hotel du Boccage was situated near the embassies of
  England and Mecklenbourg and some of the finest mansions of the French
  aristocracy. A high gateway flanked by Doric pillars and two porters' lodges
  faced the street and opened into an enchanting little garden enclosed by high
  walls above which, to the right, rose the handsome edifice of the Elysee
  Bourbon.</p>

  <p>Beyond the light foliage of the slight poplar trees, the Persian lilac and
  early roses. Mademoiselle Debelleyme saw the charming facade of an eighteenth
  century mansion of elegant white stone. The French windows of the <i>rez de
  chaussée</i> opened on to handsome balconies of ornamental ironwork, the
  floor above and the mansard windows that cut the high roof of grey slates
  were alike surrounded with graceful swags of flowers and fruit. The new
  governess crossed the little sanded court beyond the garden and mounted the
  few shallow marble steps that led to the door that broke the windows of the
  ground floor.</p>

  <p>She was instantly admitted and conducted across an antechamber to the
  salon de reception. This was a magnificent apartment which looked on to the
  Champs Élysées and the Avenue Gabriel; there was no sound nor sight
  suggestive of a great city; the house might have been set in a great
  park.</p>

  <p>The new governess was asked to wait; as soon as she was alone she looked
  about her eagerly. She was used to the heavy, expensive comfort of wealthy
  English homes, but this was different, this was magnificence, taste,
  elegance, this was, above everything, French. She liked to think that her
  ancestors had enjoyed such luxury and that she had been debarred only by the
  accident of birth from just such surroundings. So pleased and excited was she
  that her whole attitude and expression subtly and unconsciously changed. She
  drew herself more erect as her glance went from pale velvet carpets to
  delicate brocade curtains, from tall mirrors wreathed in gilt lilies to
  porcelains smooth and lustrous as silk, from chairs in exquisite tapestry to
  the drawn straw-coloured moire of the wall panels, which alternated with
  scenes of pastoral loves by François Boucher.</p>

  <p>Crystal candelabra hung from the painted ceiling, flowers adorned
  <i>jardinières</i> of Saxe and Sèvres, the April sunshine dancing through the
  moving trees outside filled the room with light. The atmosphere was that of a
  palace; the taste, the decor of the Regency, that period so smoothly lovely
  on the surface, so completely rotten within, a period that would have suited
  Lucille Debelleyme exactly.</p>

  <p>She looked at herself in the mirror above the ornate alabaster mantelpiece
  as she had looked at herself in the Paddington inn, and her room in the
  Belgravia mansion, with a keen scrutiny, with a jealous pride. She did not
  belong to the room, nor to the eighteenth century, yet she was not out of
  place, her five-year-old refurbished finery was still in perfect taste, her
  long curls framed a face that only required the right setting to be
  beautiful. She flung out her full skirts and thought: "Ah, no one will be
  able to prevent me from thinking I am the mistress here, no one can read my
  thoughts&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Something startled her, fear like a cold breath dampened her rebellious
  pride; she saw a white, menacing face staring over her shoulder.</p>

  <p>She spun round, then smiled at herself; the mirror was placed in the
  corner and against the opposite wall was a marble statue that represented a
  Cupidon arming himself with bow and arrow and staring before him to mark the
  target for the shafts of Love. This figure displayed all the graces of the
  irresistible Clodion, but, even on close scrutiny, the governess thought
  there was something sinister lurking in the contour of the fair marble face,
  a peculiar, disagreeable expression. But she never indulged fancies; she
  continued her eager observation of the gay and beautiful room that so
  delighted her. Her appraisal was professional; for nearly ten years she had
  been making herself expert in the domestic side of life, turning her
  energies, denied all other outlet, into this narrow channel.</p>

  <p>She observed therefore much besides the impressive luxury of the place.
  There was dust on everything, the hot-house flowers were withered, the
  alabaster needed cleaning, here and there a braid hung in a loop; a chair had
  been stained, and above the massive pelmets that sparkled with gold thread a
  few cobwebs could be discerned in the shadows. The new governess had noticed
  that the footman who had admitted her was not as smart as he should have
  been; and the porter in the lodge, a little too untidy, a little too
  good-natured&mdash;not that well-trained impersonal behaviour that should
  have been demanded in such an establishment.</p>

  <p>"All that money&mdash;and careless," reflected the governess. "I suppose
  they let everyone rob them. I wonder if I shall be able to get anything out
  of it?"</p>

  <p>A heavy sigh disturbed her; she turned as a low voice said:</p>

  <p>"You are Mademoiselle Debelleyme, the new governess?"</p>

  <p>Madame du Boccage had entered softly through the pale-rose velvet curtains
  at the end of the room; the governess dropped a curtsy and waited.</p>

  <p>"Pray sit down, Mademoiselle. I trust you had a tolerable voyage? And that
  the Santerres made you comfortable? They are good people."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Madame, I am very grateful for your thoughtfulness."</p>

  <p>And Mademoiselle Debelleyme waited for the usual scrutiny to which she was
  subjected by new employers; with an air of fatigue and another sigh the
  Duchess had sunk on to a canape,</p>

  <p>"You are much younger than I thought," she remarked rather wistfully.</p>

  <p>"I am twenty-eight, Madame."</p>

  <p>"I know&mdash;but Madame Faustin told me that you were a very serious,
  grave person&mdash;much older than your years&mdash;I do not perceive
  that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Madame du Boccage spoke gently, even benevolently, but the governess knew
  that she was disappointed, and knew why.</p>

  <p>The young woman in the dark merino, with the pulled-back hair, who had
  been interviewed by the wife of the French Ambassador had given a different
  impression from that made by the silk-clad lady with the long ringlets, now
  being examined. "I have made a mistake," thought the governess, and adroitly
  endeavoured to efface her error.</p>

  <p>"It is the attire. Madame will understand that what passes in London will
  not do for Paris. Nor is the establishment of Lady Anfield on a level with
  that of Madame. I believed I should please by an appearance <i>comme il
  faut</i>, but," added the governess, suddenly raising her clear eyes, "it is
  true that I have never been in a household like that of M. du Boccage and if
  I have done wrong I hope that Madame will overlook it. I will wear anything
  that Madame pleases."</p>

  <p>The women's glances met and held each other for a second; it was that of
  the Duchess which wavered first.</p>

  <p>"Oh no," she said with a touch of confusion. "I should never interfere in
  that way. Pray don't think so. It is only&mdash;one thought of
  a&mdash;different personality&mdash;but it is nothing, nothing at all! Your
  testimonials were excellent, excellent, Madame Faustin spoke of you so
  highly&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She was silent and the governess dutifully waited again with lowered eyes;
  this had become a habit with her, not from modesty, but from fear that her
  rebellion, her scorn, her pride might, despite her control, show in her
  powerful gaze. But in that brief glance she had received an exact impression
  of her new mistress.</p>

  <p>Madame du Boccage was very dark, black hair, soft black eyes, amber
  complexion, too plump but handsome. There was something imposing about her,
  but something also gentle; she seemed anxious to please but slightly troubled
  as to how to do so, and the governess had instantly noted the same slight
  disorder in the lady's dress as she had observed in the mansion. The robe of
  the Duchess was both fashionable and costly, but carelessly worn, her
  jewellery did not match, and the exquisite lace cap that rested on her glossy
  curls seemed to have been pinned in place by an indifferent hand.</p>

  <p>She began to speak again. Her voice, the warm, slightly husky voice of the
  South, was very pleasant, but she spoke vaguely, the usual commonplace talk
  of a woman relegating her maternal duties to another and salving her
  conscience by elaborate instructions she will never trouble to see carried
  out. Several times she sighed, lost the thread of her discourse, was a little
  incoherent. The answers of the governess were prompt and precise, mere
  mechanical acceptances of orders, or assurances of obedience; but suddenly
  she made an objection.</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle Broc will tell you all that you wish to know. You will go to
  her for everything."</p>

  <p>"And not to you, Madame?"</p>

  <p>The governess raised her eyes again; she was gaining confidence from the
  obvious weakness and indecision of the other woman, a confidence increased by
  the sudden flush that coloured the handsome face of Madame de Boccage, by her
  stammering reply:</p>

  <p>"I do not interfere at all&mdash;you understand&mdash;my attendance at
  Court&mdash;I entertain a great deal&mdash;you will have sole
  charge&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And sole responsibility? It is a heavy task&mdash;I had hardly
  understood&mdash;" murmured the governess carefully feeling her way before
  this unexpected situation.</p>

  <p>"I know. Several have failed at it! It is difficult indeed! I will not
  disguise that we have had a good deal of trouble to find the right
  person&mdash;I hope that you may be she&mdash;let us try, Mademoiselle. We
  can but try."</p>

  <p>The governess thought: "Something is wrong here&mdash;what? And can I turn
  it to my advantage? The woman seems a fool. A tiresome, melancholy fool. She
  looks ten years older than she is&mdash;why does she sigh and flush? Mon
  Dieu, if I had what she has, I'd have Paris at my feet."</p>

  <p>And the governess averted her gaze test this should too plainly show in
  her eyes. "How I hate you for having everything while I have nothing, nothing
  at all."</p>

  <p>This interview that the indecisiveness and hesitations of the Duchess were
  prolonging indefinitely, was cut abruptly short.</p>

  <p>The door was opened brusquely, a man entered.</p>

  <p>The Duchess instantly rose.</p>

  <p>"This is Mademoiselle Debelleyme&mdash;Mademoiselle, M. du Boccage."</p>

  <p>And she was gone, with startling swiftness, through the rose velvet
  curtains.</p>

  <p>The governess was, for once, at a loss; this sudden departure of her
  mistress, this sudden appearance of her master whom she had not troubled to
  reckon on at all, disturbed her well-trained control, her cold
  self-assurance. She curtsied to the man who had paused before her, nervously
  put aside her veil, flicked her handkerchief across her lips, then, as she
  grasped the personality of the stranger who was looking at her keenly, her
  courage really broke, she dropped, trembling and speechless, into a
  chair.</p>

  <p>For it seemed to her that she was staring at Robert Morrison.</p>

  <p>"You are ill. Mademoiselle? You have not, perhaps, recovered from the
  journey?"</p>

  <p>The voice was courteous and kind, the tone one of a solicitous respect
  with which she was not familiar; she quickly thought of an excuse for female
  faintness that she had read of in one of Lady Blessington's languishing
  romances.</p>

  <p>"The flowers. Monsieur&mdash;I am not used&mdash;the perfume of exotics is
  overpowering, is it not? And the air so warm&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The Duke snatched up one of the vases that stood near his hand, and
  exclaimed in deep vexation:</p>

  <p>"They are not fresh and the water is stale&mdash;always the same! These
  little things&mdash;excuse me, Mademoiselle."</p>

  <p>He went to a window, flung it open and tossed out withering tuberoses,
  gardenias, camellias and stagnant water.</p>

  <p>There was a sharpness in this unusual action that had the dramatic quality
  of emotional expression; the young man was plainly angry. The governess
  stared at him, thinking in a panic:</p>

  <p>"I can't stay in the same house with anyone who looks like Robert
  Morrison&mdash;Mon Dieu, what cursed luck!"</p>

  <p>She could not immediately recover from the shock of this likeness between
  the living and the dead; it was inescapable, exasperating to find in M. du
  Boccage, of whom she had formed only a vague, disinterested image, a replica
  of the man who had caused her to regard all his sex with abhorrence.</p>

  <p>The Frenchman had the same type of athletic figure as the Englishman,
  compact, powerful, graceful under his costly attire of a dandy, the same
  excessive blondness that had alternately attracted and repelled her in Robert
  Morrison. His thick straw-coloured hair curled into the toupet fashionable
  among all the courtiers of Louis Philippe, his grey eyes were shaded by
  lashes that appeared to have been powdered. The features were blunt, good,
  youthful, he appeared less than his years, much younger than his wife; his
  clothes and accessories were exquisite, from the light-grey and blue striped
  trousers strapped under his feet to the pearl-hued waistcoat and fine cambric
  stock.</p>

  <p>Having relieved his temper by casting the contents of the vase into the
  Champs Élysées, the Duke turned with an engaging smile that seemed to excuse
  his ill humour; his natural manner appeared to be soft, gentle, even gay, his
  voice was low and seductive. He approached the governess, who was shrinking
  into herself with loathing, and began to speak with that enchanting air of
  <i>grand seigneur</i> which was more welcome to her than fine wine to the
  palate, than rich perfume to the nostrils, than soft cushions to the
  body.</p>

  <p>But she resisted, still in a panic; she rose, breaking through his
  apologies, his excuses&mdash;he, not his wife, should have received her, it
  seemed, there had been a mistake&mdash;but what did that matter now? She must
  leave his presence, his house&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I regret, Monsieur&mdash;the position seems too difficult, I did not
  understand&mdash;I fear I could not undertake&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle, you would not leave me in this embarrassment&mdash;this
  cruel embarrassment?"</p>

  <p>"The loss of a governess embarrasses Monsieur?"</p>

  <p>"I must confess it&mdash;I have been overwhelmed lately. You seem,
  Mademoiselle, the person for whom I am searching&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do I?" She could afford to be bold as she intended to leave the Faubourg
  St. Honoré for ever, so she looked at him steadily with dislike and irony.
  "But Monsieur knows nothing of me."</p>

  <p>"I have excellent testimonials. I rely on the judgment of Madame Faustin
  and my own observation."</p>

  <p>The observation of a few seconds?"</p>

  <p>"It is sufficient. Mademoiselle, you have a presence and manner that give
  confidence. I feel that my children will be safe in your hands."</p>

  <p>"Monsieur obliges me by this condescension&mdash;but I still
  regret&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If, Mademoiselle, Madame du Boccage has said anything to discourage you,
  may I beg that you will listen to me before refusing to remain?"</p>

  <p>She seated herself, but averted her face with unquenchable repugnance;
  only curiosity kept her there at all. What was the secret of this
  extraordinary household?</p>

  <p>As the Duke spoke she listened, however, more to his voice than to his
  words, for this had an irresistible charm for her; and presently she ventured
  to look at him again and her shocked loathing lessened.</p>

  <p>He was like Robert Morrison, not in everything, he had not the
  Englishman's coarseness, arrogance or careless dress; he was essentially a
  French aristocrat, a courtier, and in all he did and said was the
  distinction, the allure of breed. Like the room of the house in which he sat
  he had an air of the <i>ancien régime</i>.</p>

  <p>What was he saying? She drew herself together to listen&mdash;Ah,
  banalities, trivialities, his children, his governesses, his servants, the
  disorders of his household, his wife's ill health. She was bewildered.</p>

  <p>He was not clever with words, he spoke in cliches and repeated himself.
  One sentence leapt from the others and fixed her distracted attention.</p>

  <p>"I want you to take entire charge. Mademoiselle&mdash;expenses, nurses,
  maids, amusements&mdash;you will have the first floor entirely to
  yourself&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Entire charge? And the mother?"</p>

  <p>"She will see the children for half an hour in the morning&mdash;otherwise
  you will manage absolutely alone."</p>

  <p>Unlimited power! In such an establishment! I must not be a fool again. I
  must forget he is like that miserable Englishman&mdash;at least I will find
  out more&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I regret, Monsieur, I could not accept a position that would be the means
  of separating mother and children. I could not live apart&mdash;with the
  whole responsibility."</p>

  <p>"I shall always be available. You can consult me whenever you wish. I take
  the warmest interest in the education of my children."</p>

  <p>Again the governess murmured:</p>

  <p>"And the mother?"</p>

  <p>"Neither her health nor her temperament permit her to interfere. She will
  be only too happy to leave everything to you."</p>

  <p>Mademoiselle Debelleyme raised her eyebrows; it was now perfectly clear to
  her why there had been six governesses in three years at the Faubourg St.
  Honoré. It was not in the least likely, she reflected rapidly, that she would
  be more fortunate than her predecessors. A definite refusal was on her lips,
  but she hesitated because of the charm of M. du Boccage's voice.</p>

  <p>She raised her eyes from the flowery wreaths on the Aubusson carpet to
  where the Duke's hands grasped the gilt foliage of the chair back. Startled,
  she noted the extreme nervous tension in that grip on the frail woodwork, the
  power in the wrists and fingers. These were the hands, not of an idle
  gentleman, but a man of enormous strength.</p>

  <p>She looked up into his face. His eyes, under the thick blond lashes,
  regarded her steadily, and she saw in their depths something of the
  expression she had so often tried to disguise in her own. For a second two
  fellow spirits welcomed each other, then the glances fell apart; he was the
  Duke again and she the new governess in his household.</p>

  <p>But she had made up her alert, adroit mind; this man with whom she would
  have to deal, to consult with every day, might be hatefully like Robert
  Morrison, but he was also possessed of exquisite manners, great physical
  strength and capable (she was instinctively sure) of profound duplicity. This
  combination attracted her; she asked no more from any human being than
  decorative qualities and a convenient unscrupulousness. She felt excited but
  preserved a melancholy resolute exterior.</p>

  <p>"Well, Monsieur really wishes me to undertake this charge?"</p>

  <p>"I have been asking you for the last half-hour. Mademoiselle, to do
  so."</p>

  <p>"Monsieur realises there are objections&mdash;from my point of view?" She
  rose and her glance was at once an appeal and a challenge. "And Monsieur will
  remember that he persuaded me&mdash;and support me in case
  of&mdash;difficulties?"</p>

  <p>"You may count on me, Mademoiselle."</p>

  <p>She still appeared to reflect; as she slowly buttoned her tiny glove (how
  easily both her hands could have lain in one of the large palms of M. du
  Boccage!) she observed, casually, the white mask of the Cupidon that had
  startled her before. Certainly there was something sinister in that marble
  face, as if the malicious god tipped his barbs with poison.</p>

  <p>"Very well. Monsieur, I will stay. I will attempt to please
  Monsieur&mdash;and Madame."</p>

  <p>Mademoiselle Broc, lean, vigorous, elderly, poured out bitter gossip as
  she showed the new governess over the floor reserved for the children and
  their staff; her eager spite flowed out like the steady rush of water falling
  from an upturned vase.</p>

  <p>The household was impossible, an inferno, Mademoiselle Debelleyme would
  find that out for herself&mdash;of course she would not be able to manage,
  not be able to stay, who could!</p>

  <p>The Duchess was sick, hysterical, wildly jealous, unbalanced: Matilde, her
  maid from Normandy was a toady and a spy, the children were spoiled, the
  household out of hand, the nurses were idle, insolent gossips, the servants
  did what they pleased, the robbery, the waste, was sinful!</p>

  <p>Mademoiselle Broc named everyone in the sumptuous household and gave each
  one a bad character.</p>

  <p>"And the Duke?" asked the new governess, quietly.</p>

  <p>Mademoiselle Broc had nothing but praise for the Duke; he had been
  charming to her, kind, considerate, the children adored him&mdash;but what
  could he do? Whenever he tried to interfere Madame made a scene; sometimes it
  was clear that he was driven half distracted&mdash;that was why he was trying
  to take the children away from their mother because he was sure the little
  ones were being ruined by this perpetual disorder&mdash;whenever Madame came
  near them there was trouble.</p>

  <p>"Madame and Monsieur du Boccage do not agree, then? It is an unhappy
  marriage? Why?"</p>

  <p>It was clear from the confused venom of Mademoiselle Broc's reply that she
  did not know; there was no definite scandal, merely a clash of temperaments,
  a disagreement over the education of the children&mdash;but what did it
  matter? The household, the displaced governess insisted, was an inferno!</p>

  <p>"Which you have helped to make, you old fool," thought Lucille Debelleyme.
  "I must, of course, find out the truth for myself but, unfortunately, the
  truth is generally what one does not find out."</p>

  <p>She was only half listening to the tirade of Mademoiselle Broc, her
  attention was distracted by the comforts, the splendours of the apartments
  which were to be under her sole charge. With greedy pleasure she noted every
  luxury; two rooms for herself, furnished like the bedchamber and boudoir of a
  gentlewoman, a pianette, a harp, a desk, flowers, pictures, a lovely view on
  to the tree tops of the Champs Élysées... a sharp difference from the little
  room with the drugget square, the hard bed, the cracked mirror, of Belgrave
  Square.</p>

  <p>"I'll stay here," thought Lucille Debelleyme, "as long as human ingenuity
  can contrive it."</p>

  <p>Mademoiselle Broc continued to assail her ears with a tumult of involved,
  petty and sordid complaints.</p>

  <p>"Don't you think," rebuked the new governess with gentle authority, "that
  we should not gossip about our employers? And that we should always speak
  respectfully about Madame la Duchesse?"</p>

  <p>"My dear Camille," said Madame du Boccage carefully, "I am sure that
  Mademoiselle Debelleyme will not suit us."</p>

  <p>"On the contrary," he replied with his ready, amiable smile, "I believe
  that she will do very well."</p>

  <p>"Oh no! She is not in the least the sort of person I expected. Really,
  Madame Faustin quite deceived me. She is too young for such a
  responsibility&mdash;and that cold, English type!"</p>

  <p>"She is a Parisienne."</p>

  <p>"Who is she, really?"</p>

  <p>"Of a good family who was ruined at the Restoration, her testimonials were
  sufficient. We will give her a trial at least."</p>

  <p>He waited patiently for his wife's answer to this, but he had an air of
  being detained; she had indeed intercepted him in the antechamber as he was
  about to leave to accompany the Royal Princes, M.M. D'Aumale and De Nemours,
  to the races on the Champ de Mars where the colours of Rothschild would
  compete with those of de Morny and de Pontalba. He looked very elegant in his
  correct English clothes; the Anglophilia now the height of the fashion suited
  him exactly, for he was of the type that his countrymen called <i>"un lord
  brittanique."</i></p>

  <p>His wife looked at him frowning.</p>

  <p>"Believe me, Camille. she will not do&mdash;Mademoiselle Broc came to me
  immediately complaining of her&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle Broc has been displaced&mdash;it is conceivable that she is
  prejudiced. All the trouble lies in these perpetual recriminations. Has
  Mademoiselle Debelleyme complained of anything?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Give her, then, at least a trial, my dear Fanny. Are you coming to the
  ball at the Tuileries to-night? M. Guizot would like a brilliant display to
  impress those ridiculous Arab chiefs."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry, I am not well enough."</p>

  <p>"A pity." M. du Boccage approached his wife and kissed her lightly on the
  brow with cold, firm lips; she watched him cross the sanded courtyard and
  disappear under the delicate, waving shadow of the lilacs. The sunshine made
  his hair shine like pale metal under his jauntily adjusted top-hat.</p>

  <p>Madame du Boccage sighed in a bewildered fashion; she was a woman who
  would be found at a loss in every situation that life can offer.</p>

  <p>Lucille Debelleyme, having resolved to remain in the Faubourg St. Honoré,
  now seriously considered how to do so; she used all the mingled prudence and
  audacity of a general planning a campaign and enjoyed the exercise of certain
  qualities she possessed that, hitherto, had had no scope.</p>

  <p>In a few days she had summed up the position of affairs as accurately as
  her sources of information would permit.</p>

  <p>What Mademoiselle Broc had said of the disorder in the household was true.
  Everything was badly, wastefully run; the servants gossiped, idled and
  divided themselves into cliques, there was an atmosphere of unrest; the
  frequent lavish entertainments at which Royalty were received were
  extravagant but neither well-run nor successful; the children, pretty and
  charming in themselves, were over-indulged in one direction, neglected in
  another and drawn into the intrigues of nurses and governesses.</p>

  <p>Madame's chaplain, the Abbé Galle, was very frequently on the scene and
  interfered too much in the household. Madame's reckless charities brought
  hordes of beggars about the place, many of whom imposed shamelessly on her
  easy bounty.</p>

  <p>Against all this put these facts; the Duke liked order for its own sake
  and he was anxious not to waste a sou, because he was absorbed in the
  restoration of Javiaux du Boccage which he had begun on a lavish scale. He
  had come into a vast property and a magnificent title, but he had a mother, a
  brother and three sisters to provide for, and to maintain his position and
  revive the splendours of Javiaux du Boccage, built by the Maréchal de Villars
  out of the spoils of war, his wife's huge fortune was necessary to him. He
  was, unusually so for his rank, fond of his children, anxious for their good
  and passionately desirous of a household orderly, peaceful, cheerful in which
  they could nourish in perfect harmony; also he was Voltairean and liked
  neither the Abbé Galle nor the paupers whom he brought in his train.</p>

  <p>Madame du Boccage was generous, impulsive, romantic, sentimental,
  tactless, uncontrolled; by the very strength of her affection for them she
  upset her children. She could not be with them for five minutes without
  introducing a distressing emotional tension or provoking a scene. She was
  really in ill health and took a good deal of opium.</p>

  <p>It was no wonder that she and her husband had their disagreements.</p>

  <p>How far did these disagreements go?</p>

  <p>The governess wished that she could put her finger on that.</p>

  <p>But she was shut away from those apartments on the <i>rez de chaussée</i>
  where Monsieur and Madame du Boccage adjusted their differences. It had been
  a romantic love match, they had had nine children; not even scandal gave M.
  du Boccage a mistress. No doubt, despite the unhappy friction from petty
  matters that disordered their household this couple, young and charming, were
  still secret, if intermittent, lovers.</p>

  <p>"I shall have to be very careful," thought the new governess. "I expect
  she has the last word in all disputes&mdash;the wife, the mother&mdash;and
  the bulk of the money hers! Shall I attach myself to her? Champion her?
  Become her confidante, help her torment him&mdash;the man so like Robert
  Morrison? That would be the strongest position for me. She is a weak fool and
  I could soon get a hold on her&mdash;oust the Abbé, the maid, the
  paupers&mdash;make myself indispensable. Of course he is infinitely more
  attractive, but to vex her in order to please him would be too dangerous. If
  she resolved that I was to go he would not be able to resist."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It was the King's birthday, and Paris rejoiced in the warm
  May weather. There was much to rejoice at indeed, fifteen years of a peaceful
  monarchy under this citizen King, with his liberal ideas, who despised
  military force, who ruled by affection alone&mdash;not King of France, but
  King of the French.</p>

  <p>In the morning, concerts were held under the high windows of the
  Tuileries, <i>aubades</i> for the King; from the Invalides cannons echoed
  round the new tomb of Napoleon I, saluting the heir of the House of Orleans
  who had espoused the cause of the Sovereign people in 1789. Among the crowd
  that pressed in the streets to enjoy the excitements of the <i>fête du
  roi</i> were many who could recall the execution of Louis XVI, the First
  Republic, the Directory, the Consulate, the Empire, the Restoration of the
  Bourbons, the death of Louis XVIII, the flight of Charles X. All these
  changes and tumults were now in the past; France rejoiced under the mild,
  wise rule of Louis Philippe, all was prosperous, tolerant, secure.</p>

  <p>The courtyard of the Tuileries was blocked by the carriages of the
  aristocracy, the ministry hastening to offer their congratulations to His
  Majesty.</p>

  <p>Outside the gates a respectful crowd listened to the concert given by the
  Garde Nationale; among the equipages was that of M. du Boccage, occupied by
  his elder children and the new governess,</p>

  <p>Mademoiselle Debelleyme enjoyed the spectacle and her own part in it,
  sitting at ease in the handsome carriage with the magnificent escutcheon on
  the gleaming panels and liveried servants on the box, in the company of these
  pretty, eager children (already, by the exertion of all her charm, all her
  art, she had won them), in the midst of the bustle of the animated crowd, in
  front of the palace.</p>

  <p>People noticed her; never before had she been so elegantly attired in such
  elegant surroundings. The acquaintances of M. du Boccage who stopped to
  salute the children glanced at her more than once, paying the tribute of
  curiosity to her distinction, her composure, her charming appearance.</p>

  <p>Under her aloft decorum Lucille Debelleyme was pulsing to a nameless
  enthusiasm; Paris, the spring, the edge of great events! To be part of it,
  even as a spectator, to be in touch with all this life and movement... she
  thought of one man among the many crowding in the antechambers of the
  King&mdash;the man who had, a few days ago, spoken to her so anxiously, so
  intimately, who every morning gave her her instructions with a kindness, a
  consideration, a courtesy which she had never received before, this <i>grand
  seigneur</i>, this friend of royalty, this blond athlete with the allure of a
  cavalier of Lancret&mdash;this enigma that she believed she would in a short
  time be able to solve.</p>

  <p>Amid loyal acclamations the Royal Family appeared on the balcony of the
  palace. The King, that man of many adventures, the dashing young victor of
  Valmy, the grave young school-teacher of Reicheneau, the aging exile, now
  heavy with the painful bulk of disease, but still an imposing figure in the
  white trousers, tight coat, high braided collar, stiff épaulettes and azure
  riband&mdash;the Queen, spirited yet melancholy, still overwhelmed by the
  tragedy of the sudden death of her eldest son, and that group of young
  Princes and their wives who seemed to promise a flourishing succession to the
  House of Orleans.</p>

  <p>As the King bowed, his cocked, feathered hat in his hand, a raven rose and
  fluttered above the busbies of the Garde Nationale, hesitated, then circled
  round the Orleans flag in the midst of the soldiers.</p>

  <p>Mademoiselle Debelleyme was conscious of a sudden tension in the crowd;
  she knew that the bird was believed to foretell misfortune. The people
  stopped talking, stopped moving, and watched the raven, which, an ugly shadow
  in the brightness of the scene, rose and flew three times above the balcony
  where the members of the House of Orleans were grouped.</p>

  <p>The governess was not superstitious, but superstitions amused her; she
  narrowly watched the people who seemed to draw a breath, then let it out in a
  sigh&mdash;or a hiss? A sound of regret or of menace?</p>

  <p>The band finished playing a melody from "La Barcarolle" the last success
  of M. Auber from the Opera Comique, and someone, somewhere, raised a cry for
  the hymn of the people, "La Marseillaise," the fearful song of 1793&mdash;a
  slight hesitation and it was played. The governess of M. du Boccage watched
  the people intently; were they as satisfied, as peaceful as they appeared?
  Did they not secretly long to try again the fortune of a bloody
  revolution&mdash;to see the heads of those who called themselves their
  masters drop into the basket of the guillotine?</p>

  <p>The delicate nostrils of the governess expanded; she recalled her
  inherited hatred of the Bourbons which mingled with her rebellion as an
  outcast against any settled state of society; gladly would she have seen that
  family bowing from the balcony of the Tuileries sent the way of the relations
  they had displaced.</p>

  <p>The playing of the song of the people was short; there was a clamour for
  repetition, but the soldiers ignored this and broke into the sweet strains of
  an aria from Richard en Palestine&mdash;the King left the balcony but the
  raven continued to hover over the flag of Orleans.</p>

  <p>"Is it not all charming and agreeable, my darlings?" smiled the governess
  to the two excited little girls by her side. "Now you may each have some
  sugared almonds and we will drive along the river before going home."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Lucille Debelleyme had been a fortnight in the Faubourg St.
  Honoré and had sized up all the conflicting characters with whom she had to
  deal. She decided that it would be only possible for her to remain in this
  very desirable post if she could gain the confidence of the Duchess, who
  regarded her, she knew, with an increasing hostility.</p>

  <p>This resolution cost her a sigh, a pang of regret. M. du Boccage was so
  much more interesting than his wife, disliked and despised by the
  governess&mdash;but it was obvious that the final decision would lie with the
  mistress, not with the master of the establishment; better toady to the
  Duchess than leave; better cringe to a woman who could defend, protect her,
  than rely on a man who at the first murmur would be forced to abandon
  her.</p>

  <p>Madame du Boccage returned late from a soiree given by the Duchesse
  D'Orleans; she was sitting wearily in her chamber, idly regarding herself in
  the mirror on her dressing-table while Matilde took off the superb parure of
  diamonds that had been her father's wedding gift to Isabella Rosa
  Frediani&mdash;(Fanny to her husband), when a discreet tap announced the
  governess.</p>

  <p>The Duchess was startled.</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle! Is anything the matter with the children?"</p>

  <p>"Madame, they are all in perfect health and asleep in the charge of the
  nurses&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, then, Mademoiselle?"</p>

  <p>"I have had no opportunity of talking to you, Madame. I very much wish to
  know if you are satisfied with my services?"</p>

  <p>The governess crossed the rich carpet and stood respectfully before her
  mistress.</p>

  <p>The noble brunette beauty of Madame du Boccage was finely set off by her
  crimson robe de parade, her glittering jewels, the display of her smooth
  shoulders and arms, the garland of purple roses that took the place of the
  matron's cap on her shining black hair. All the light in the room was on her
  dressing-table and all this was centred on the splendid Corsican; the slender
  figure of the governess in her prune-coloured silk remained effaced in the
  warm shadows beyond this circle of illumination.</p>

  <p>The Duchess said, quietly:</p>

  <p>"I should have told you if I had had cause for complaint,
  Mademoiselle."</p>

  <p>"That&mdash;no! But satisfaction is another thing, is it not? I am very
  desirous of pleasing you, Madame."</p>

  <p>"You appear to be an excellent instructress."</p>

  <p>"I would wish to be something more."</p>

  <p>"More?"</p>

  <p>"The care of five children includes so much besides instructing them. Only
  the mother can realise how much! If I might consult you often, Madame? Put
  before you my little plans and suggestions? Interest you in the affairs, the
  pleasures of the children?"</p>

  <p>A slight spasm passed over the watchful face of the Duchess; her eyes were
  dimmed by tears. <i>Touché!</i> thought the governess, but Madame du Boccage
  replied evenly:</p>

  <p>"You see M. du Boccage every day, do you not? And take your instructions
  from him, as was arranged? You understood from the first that my health was
  feeble, my social duties pressing."</p>

  <p>"Madame is too generous, so sympathetic; the Abbé Galle, the poor are so
  full of her praises! Just a little of the time given to piety taken for the
  children would make all the difference to my task&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Matilde, arranging the big brilliant drops for throat and ears in the
  velvet case, knocked over a satin box and glanced malevolently over it as she
  picked it up at the governess, who thought instantly: "The maid knows
  everything&mdash;but I shall never find it out from her&mdash;she hates me
  and is loyal&mdash;but surely I can oust a peasant?"</p>

  <p>"No doubt," sighed the Duchess putting a hand to her forehead as if it
  ached, "your task is hard. I feared that you would find it too
  much&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It is not. I have never been so happy anywhere. But I should like the
  approval of Madame."</p>

  <p>As the other woman did not reply the governess continued more boldly, yet
  always with insinuating sweetness.</p>

  <p>"I am in all at the service of Madame."</p>

  <p>The Duchess raised soft, candid, troubled eyes to study the other woman;
  the clear, cold glance of the governess said: "I know your household is
  divided. I am willing to be your ally against your husband. Between us we can
  circumvent him at every turn."</p>

  <p>And the gaze of the Duchess replied: "I believe you to be sly and false. I
  will not give you my confidence. And I do not intrigue with my
  inferiors."</p>

  <p>Slipping her broad sapphire bracelets from her fine wrists, Madame du
  Boccage smiled:</p>

  <p>"I have had no reason to reprove you. Mademoiselle&mdash;you say you are
  happy. Well, let us try how affairs work&mdash;a little longer? And now
  forgive me, I am so sleepy."</p>

  <p>The governess understood instantly that not only was her alliance refused
  but that the Duchess did not intend to retain her services indefinitely. The
  maid's face darkened with triumph which helped to inflame the burst of rage
  and hate in the heart of Lucille Debelleyme as she withdrew respectfully,
  apologising for her intrusion.</p>

  <p>At the door her glance went round the extravagant room opulent with every
  luxury, and rested on the magnificent bed raised on gilt steps, flounced with
  embroidered satin, hung with curtains of Brussels lace that the flying
  figures of gilt puttini attached to a massive baldaquin; she glanced at the
  two sumptuous pillows side by side; what was the secret of this marriage?</p>

  <p>"Good night, Mademoiselle," came the husky voice of the Duchess, hastening
  her dismissal, reproving her hesitation.</p>

  <p>This so goaded the exasperated mood of the governess that she had, like a
  quick dart in her mind, a wild wicked thought... if that heavy baldaquin
  could fall in the night, crushing the woman who slept beneath...</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The governess moved slowly down the corridor, repulsed,
  defeated, her alliance refused, before her the prospect of another departure,
  another period of servitude in a place that was sure to be far less pleasant
  than this.</p>

  <p>Already she was at home in her elegant apartments, already she had
  introduced order, serenity, discipline into her little world and secured the
  grateful allegiance of the children; already amid the confusion of the
  mismanaged household her department ran smoothly, without friction or
  dispute.</p>

  <p>And must all this be given up because that other woman did not like her,
  would not trust her?</p>

  <p>Faint with rage Lucille Debelleyme leant against the wall of the
  corridor.</p>

  <p>"She has everything, youth, beauty, wealth, rank, a charming husband,
  delicious children&mdash;a powerful father, hosts of friends&mdash;I have
  just myself, possess nothing, have no one to help me. Possess nothing? I have
  also beauty, youth&mdash;perhaps more wit. Dare I match myself against

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The next day the domestic storms that always muttered below
  the horizon in the Hotel du Boccage broke into the open. There had been an
  entertainment at which the Duc de Nemours had been present and everything had
  gone awry; the service, the food, the music, the lights. The Duke had spoken
  sharply to the Major Domo, he to the housekeeper, she to the cook, the house
  had rung with recriminations. The Duchess, with reddened eyes, had shut
  herself into her apartments; everyone shifted responsibility on to someone
  else and blamed some invisible daemon for creating this devilish
  disorder.</p>

  <p>Mademoiselle Lucille Debelleyme was a good gambler, she knew when to play
  for high stakes. Twenty-four hours after this fracas, some time before her
  usual daily consultation with the Duke was due, she knocked at the door of
  his apartments, which, to the right of the entrance chamber, were separated
  from those of the Duchess by a narrow corridor.</p>

  <p>M. du Boccage himself opened to her, and seemed, she thought, relieved to
  see her, as if he had expected some more unwelcome intruder.</p>

  <p>He had risen from a light green bureau, charmingly painted with flowers.
  The room was done up in the gayest manner of the Regency, and seemed, even
  more than the other apartments of the hotel, an expression of his
  personality, virile, passionate, but carefully masked by an affectation of
  careless elegance that touched the appearance, but the appearance only, of
  effeminacy.</p>

  <p>The governess, in spotless, severe muslin, stood in a bar of sunshine that
  fell through the pale silk curtains and made an indiscreet gleam in her long
  curls. What she was about to do was the result of desperation on her part and
  she was mentally fumbling her way in a situation that she only half
  understood, but her air was serene, melancholy and resolute.</p>

  <p>"You are in some difficulty. Mademoiselle?" asked the Duke pleasantly but
  with the apprehensive air of a man who has too many people coming to him with
  difficulties. He stood by his desk; under his hand was a portfolio of white,
  gilded parchment on which lay a letter evidently just taken from the
  envelope.</p>

  <p>"I am in no difficulty whatever. Monsieur," said the governess. "I hope I
  give satisfaction in my duties?"</p>

  <p>"Your department is the only one in the house that is well run&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She had hoped that he would say something like that; instantly she took
  her advantage.</p>

  <p>"That is the point I wished to raise. Madame du Boccage is overburdened
  with duties&mdash;the poor, the church, her poor health, it is marvellous she
  does what she does&mdash;I feel already for her a devotion, a
  respect!&mdash;I would wish to help her&mdash;never have I had a mistress so
  considerate."</p>

  <p>The Duke regarded her steadily from under his thick fair lashes, the smile
  on his sensual mouth was expressionless, but the governess was
  encouraged.</p>

  <p>"Pray be seated. Mademoiselle, and tell me what you mean."</p>

  <p>She gracefully sank into the light chair behind her, she had the delicious
  sensation of being perfectly understood without the help of words.</p>

  <p>"Would it be any assistance to Madame du Boccage if I was, without
  troubling her at all, to undertake the management of the household?"</p>

  <p>"You could do it. Mademoiselle?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>He regarded her thoughtfully; she still was not quite sure of him, not
  quite free from a fear that he might deeply resent her effrontery, yet she
  felt, somehow, secure.</p>

  <p>She saw him look down at and flick over the letter on the desk. She sensed
  that this letter was important to him and was very anxious to know what it
  was; she rose as if in agitation, and approached the desk.</p>

  <p>"If Monsieur thinks I have presumed&mdash;" she contrived to read the
  first line of the letter and notice the feminine handwriting&mdash;"My dear
  Camille, I implore you&mdash;"; he had then a mistress?</p>

  <p>"No, Mademoiselle, you do not presume. I am, on the contrary, grateful for
  your offer."</p>

  <p>He closed the portfolio and carelessly flung it into a drawer of his
  bureau; the governess marked which drawer. Henri, the <i>valet de
  chambre</i>, entered from an inner door to ask if his master was going to the
  hunt that day? Mademoiselle noted, behind his shoulder, an elegant
  bedchamber; M. du Boccage was not, then, so uxorious that he must always
  sleep beneath the baldaquin supported by amorini, draped with lace curtains
  where his wife took her repose.</p>

  <p>While he spoke to his servant, the governess, whose eyes were never idle,
  noticed an engraving of a portrait hanging near the window of a soldier in
  armour, wearing a huge dust-blond peruke knotted with a black ribbon, who
  bore an unmistakable likeness to M. du Boccage; the same firm, blunt
  features, the same full, smiling, sensual mouth, beautifully formed, the same
  sweet expression, in the eyes that look which Mademoiselle Lucille
  interpreted as a profound duplicity, and, grasping a baton strewn with fleur
  de lis, the same powerful hand, indicating a brutal, almost vulgar
  strength.</p>

  <p>The Duke noted the young woman's glance, and, as the servant left, he
  said:</p>

  <p>"An ancestor of mine, Charles O'Brien, Vicomte de Clare&mdash;an Irish
  exile."</p>

  <p>"It is a fascinating personality, Monsieur."</p>

  <p>"You think so? He had a bad reputation&mdash;for cruelty, I believe, but
  in those days, bah!"</p>

  <p>He broke off; she knew that he expressed himself ill on serious matters,
  had few words and found it an effort to use more than the light, idle
  sentences at which he was an adept, therefore she waited, patiently,
  respectfully.</p>

  <p>"Eh, well. Mademoiselle," he brought out at length, "you have perceived
  the disorders in my household. I confess that they torment me, for I like a
  peaceful life. You appear to have energy, discretion&mdash;a gift of
  management&mdash;let us try what you can do&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The governess cast down her eyes to hide her triumph. "Monsieur will
  support me?"</p>

  <p>"Naturally&mdash;if I have given you authority, I shall support you."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">In a fortnight it was done; by tact, by firmness, by the use
  of her gift of authority that was often resented, never resisted, by sheer
  talent for organisation and the experience that had come from long, ironic
  observation of where other women went wrong, the governess had transformed
  the establishment of M. du Boccage. Some servants had been dismissed, some
  reformed, the place of Mademoiselle Broc had been taken by a stolid, effaced,
  hard-working Swiss, Mademoiselle Heller; the Major Domo, who had taken ill to
  the domination of the governess, had gone and in his place was an Italian,
  excellently trained, keenly anxious to please the woman to whom he owed his
  splendid post.</p>

  <p>There was no more dust on the pelmets, no more faded flowers in the vases,
  no longer did the sound of quarrels come from the kitchens; the accounts went
  down, the entertainments were smoothly successful, the equipages, the lackeys
  smarter than before; the whole establishment had that air of easy finish that
  hitherto it had lacked.</p>

  <p>M. du Boccage could lead, at ease, that life of voluptuous idleness, of
  charming social amusement, of domestic felicity with his lovely children that
  he so enjoyed.</p>

  <p>And Madame du Boccage had ample leisure in which to administer her
  charities, attend her Masses, confer with the Abbé Galle, nurse her
  languishing body.</p>

  <p>But the trouble in her dark eyes, the cloud on her broad brow did not
  lessen; she was often shut for hours in her splendid apartments alone with
  Matilde, her maid.</p>

  <p>And when she showed herself among her now perfectly run household her
  suffering appearance evoked the pity of her servants to whom she was no
  longer of much importance, but merely an invalid who had relegated all her
  duties to a dependant.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Mademoiselle Lucille was not wholly occupied in her labours;
  now that she had surrounded herself with reliable underlings she had a great
  deal of leisure. This was devoted to the children.</p>

  <p>There were visits to the grandfather, the magnificent Maréchal Comte
  Frediani del Marco, to the grandmother, the blind Dowager Madame du Boccage
  who lived with her son, Comte Edouard, recently betrothed to the exquisite
  Mademoiselle Schickler; to the pretty, blonde married aunts, all of whom had
  made brilliant marriages when the Revolution of July brought the House of
  Montlosier du Boccage a position of wealth and splendour.</p>

  <p>And it was not difficult for a clever young woman to find constant
  amusements for five lively children, the eldest of whom was only twelve, when
  she had so many resources and unlimited money at her disposal. The little
  Marquis, Philippe Joseph, was as delighted as his eldest sisters, Isabelle,
  Cesarine, to visit General Tom Thumb again and again at the Theatre du
  Vaudeville, or to drive in the Bois in the hopes of seeing him in his azure
  carriage drawn by the six white ponies. Even the two younger children,
  Gaston, Laure, enjoyed the fairy pantomime, <i>La Biche au bois</i>, at the
  Porte St. Martin and they all looked forward to the opening of the
  Hippodrome, which they were driven to see being built at the barrière de
  L'Étoile, and delighted in the concerts, marionette shows and diversions
  Mademoiselle Lucille never failed to find. There were brief visits to
  Tortoni's, to the restaurant Royale, for an ice, a shop, in the company of
  the dandies, and the society men and women; and Mademoiselle was always so
  gay, kind, loving and charming that the happy children did not notice that
  they were seeing scarcely anything of their mother.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

  <p class="first">M. Gavaudan Clery welcomed his granddaughter with grim
  sarcasm to his small house at St. Cloud. He told her frankly that he was
  surprised that such a fine lady as she had become should trouble to visit a
  poor wretch like himself.</p>

  <p>"When one has only a single relative in the world, one likes to keep an
  eye on him," replied Lucille, coolly. "How do I know, <i>mon vieux
  bonhomme</i>, that you have not a neat little fortune hidden away?"</p>

  <p>She seated herself at the table and helped herself to a portion of his
  meagre meal; this poverty struck her after the luxury of the Hotel du
  Boccage.</p>

  <p>"Besides," she added, "I must not make myself too much a slave&mdash;I
  must insist on a holiday now and then&mdash;a whole day, I said, to visit
  relations."</p>

  <p>"You try to make yourself indispensable?"</p>

  <p>"Naturally. Never have I been so well paid, so well treated&mdash;had so
  much power."</p>

  <p>"Take care you are not too clever," warned the old man sourly. "These
  people are of the great world. It is very strange that they should have let a
  nobody like you assume such a position."</p>

  <p>"I am very careful. I work underground. I quarrel with no one. M. du
  Boccage is pleased with the order that I have brought about."</p>

  <p>"And Madame du Boccage?"</p>

  <p>"She is devoted to the poor and the priests. And always ill. I see very
  little of her."</p>

  <p>"Is she happy with her husband?"</p>

  <p>"I wish I knew," said Lucille sincerely. For all her art, she had not been
  able to penetrate the secrets of the <i>rez de chaussée</i> where husband and
  wife resided, or break down the loyalty of Matilde, the Norman maid, who was
  the confidante of her mistress. "He always speaks of her with warm
  respect&mdash;they have the appearance of the utmost felicity&mdash;but she
  is a tiresome woman&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Is there another&mdash;a mistress?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think so," replied Lucille, thoughtfully, remembering the letter
  beginning&mdash;"My dear Camille"; she had not yet had an opportunity to see
  if the Duke kept the drawer, into which he had thrown that letter, locked.
  "At any rate, he is very discreet. So what does it matter?"</p>

  <p>"I thought," sneered M. de Clery, "that you might be enamoured of him
  yourself."</p>

  <p>"Bah, I am not that sort of fool! I play for respect, decorum. I make
  myself useful. He could easily find a pretty woman for a mistress, he could
  not so easily find a woman to do what I do for him. In this case virtue
  pays!"</p>

  <p>"You play the game of an adventuress."</p>

  <p>Lucille's clear eyes gave a formidable flash.</p>

  <p>"And if I do? Good God! have I not been trained to be an adventuress? If
  there is no place for me in society, must I not make one?"</p>

  <p>"You fly too high," objected the old man. "Take care you do not lose your
  head."</p>

  <p>"That I shall never do." She smiled coolly. "Tell me, Grandfather, what do
  you know of these Montlosier Boccage?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing that will help you much. I saw them married in '30. By the Bishop
  of Beauvais it was, in the chapel of the Luxembourg&mdash;a fine sum of money
  it must have cost! You never saw such a display! She was a beautiful
  woman&mdash;- eyes, hair like jet, the figure of a goddess!"</p>

  <p>"That has gone&mdash;she has had nine children."</p>

  <p>"So much the worse for her. He looked like a girl&mdash;a stripling, pale
  as a glass of milk, hesitating&mdash;bah!"</p>

  <p>"He has changed." smiled Lucille.</p>

  <p>"One understands. Poor devil, married at seventeen, by his old miser of a
  father who nearly went mad with joy when the great heiress took a fancy to
  him. Nine children, fifteen years of cooing in a dove's nest at thirty-two!
  The fool, who can't have the spirit of a louse, must feel himself a little
  ridiculous!"</p>

  <p>"I believe he does&mdash;but we don't know how he employs his
  leisure."</p>

  <p>"No doubt she does! A Corsican!"</p>

  <p>"Jealous, you think?"</p>

  <p>"What do you suppose? That is why I said&mdash;you had better be
  careful&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I have been. She is really very wealthy, is she not?"</p>

  <p>"Two million now and eventually the Frediani fortune and the estate in
  Corsica! Her old fox of a father! I remember him at Austerlitz. But he soon
  changed over to the Bourbons. Now if I had done that, things might have been
  different with me&mdash;but no, I must be loyal to the Emperor!"</p>

  <p>"M. Frediani is a very imposing, handsome man, devoted to his
  grandchildren."</p>

  <p>"Eh, maybe! I remember when he was ordered to quell the revolt in Poland
  and sent the message&mdash;'All is quiet in Warsaw,' and so it was, for he
  had massacred the lot of 'em!"</p>

  <p>Lucille joined in her grandfather's laughter; for a moment the two
  small-featured fine faces, one so wrinkled, one so smooth, had the same
  expression of heartless amusement; but M. Clery soon returned to his ill
  humour.</p>

  <p>"And doesn't M. du Boccage want to know who you are?"</p>

  <p>"He has not asked. I have an answer ready if he should."</p>

  <p>Take care what lies you tell him, he'd find you out at once."</p>

  <p>"I know. Well, you can't be any help to me, and I believe I can contrive
  very well by myself."</p>

  <p>The old soldier turned his dim, malicious glance on the neat shape, the
  lovely face, the elegant curls of his granddaughter. She was spending every
  sou of her salary on clothes and was finely, if simply, dressed; never before
  had she had such an air of self-assurance, of modest, but serene
  confidence.</p>

  <p>"A pity," he sneered, "that you were born the wrong side of the sheets!
  You might have yourself been the mistress of a house in the Faubourg St.
  Honoré!"</p>

  <p>He chuckled to see her irritation. She decided that she would not come to
  see the wicked old rogue again as she restored her equanimity by gazing out
  of the window at the noble beauty of the trees in the Park of St. Cloud.</p>

  <p>But she felt tolerably satisfied when she returned to the Hotel du
  Boccage; she felt that she had analysed and controlled to her own advantage
  the world in which she had found herself; what more could cleverness do?</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">When Mademoiselle Debelleyme reached her charming little
  apartment, she found the Duchess waiting for her in the spring twilight and
  her sense of security was rudely shaken.</p>

  <p>Madame du Boccage, who seemed very nervous, began to speak at once.</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle, I must regret&mdash;a sudden change of plan&mdash;M. du
  Boccage and I have decided&mdash;the elder boy will have a tutor&mdash;go
  perhaps to school&mdash;the girls&mdash;I will see to myself. We go to
  Javiaux du Boccage soon&mdash;or perhaps to Locroi. I will pay your salary
  for the year&mdash;I will give you&mdash;yet another excellent
  testimonial."</p>

  <p>"I am to leave, Madame?"</p>

  <p>"If you please."</p>

  <p>"At once?"</p>

  <p>"If you please."</p>

  <p>"May I ask why?"</p>

  <p>"I have given you my reasons."</p>

  <p>"They are scarcely sufficient, Madame," replied the governess, quietly,
  "for a sudden dismissal. An insulting dismissal. My character is my sole
  possession."</p>

  <p>"I have said that I will give you an excellent testimonial."</p>

  <p>"Even that will hardly cover my sudden departure from your house."</p>

  <p>"It must." The Duchess rose; both her dignity and the emotion it cloaked
  were formidable. "If you have no other place ready, no relatives in Paris,
  you may lodge with the Santerres."</p>

  <p>"May I know the cause of my offence? I have tried hard to please."</p>

  <p>"Too hard. Mademoiselle!" murmured Madame du Boccage. "You are a good
  instructress, a fine manager, but your personality, no doubt in itself
  admirable, is not one I care to have placed in power&mdash;such full
  power&mdash;over my children."</p>

  <p>"Ah! But I have acted under the instructions of M. du Boccage."</p>

  <p>"I know. You are blameless. He admits his mistake. He hopes you will
  leave&mdash;to-morrow."</p>

  <p>There was an unescapable finality about these words that made the
  governess recoil against the wall and pull at her fingers in a display of
  passion such as she seldom allowed herself.</p>

  <p>"I have the right to know; Madame, the reason for this sudden
  decision."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Mademoiselle!" cried the Duchess in generous scorn, "you are no fool.
  You know perfectly well that you have created an intolerable situation which
  must end."</p>

  <p>And she was gone.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Mademoiselle Debelleyme packed the neat fine clothes, the
  pretty trifles into which she had put her last sou, filled with a rage that
  made her feel physically sick.</p>

  <p>Rage chiefly against the man; she had exerted herself to serve, to please
  him, she had really toiled to carry out his wishes, he had professed himself
  grateful and then he had abandoned her, with contemptible weakness, to the
  stupid, senseless spite of his intolerable wife. His image fused with that of
  Robert Morrison, that other man who had betrayed her, and such loathing shook
  her that she had to lean on the edge of the trunk, her cold hands pressed to
  her smarting eyes.</p>

  <p>The servants, even those who owed their places to her, now avoided her;
  all her power, so painfully acquired by hard work, tact and charm, had gone
  in a few hours; she was merely a governess who had been dismissed.</p>

  <p>Only the children remained loyal. Their wild distress was her one triumph,
  but Madame du Boccage had taken them and Mademoiselle Heller to her own
  apartments; the governess was left alone to make the preparations for her
  departure.</p>

  <p>The Duke, of course, was out of the track of the storm; he had gone to the
  Tuileries.</p>

  <p>"The coward, the miserable, false coward," she sobbed, kneeling by the
  trunk. Only pride, only a fear of collapsing before the spiteful grins of the
  people who had flattered her yesterday, got her to her feet.</p>

  <p>She then noticed, on the table where the Duchess had left it the evening
  before, the envelope containing the testimonial Madame du Boccage had
  written.</p>

  <p>The force of the governess' anguish was suddenly stayed; she recognised
  the writing. It was that of the letter beginning&mdash;'My dear Camille' that
  she had seen the Duke toss into his desk.</p>

  <p>So! his wife wrote to him?</p>

  <p>What terms were they on, then? The one line she had read had been the
  beginning of a protest, a complaint&mdash;or a supplication&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Ah, no wonder she is jealous of every woman who comes near him! They
  quarrel; they are, perhaps, separated&mdash;but how come that he, the
  miserable coward, allows her to dominate?" She wished, with an almost frantic
  passion, that she could read the letters shut in the pretty green
  desk&mdash;letters from wife to husband, living in the same house&mdash;</p>

  <p>She caught herself up. The secrets of the Hotel du Boccage were no longer
  of any consequence to her; she was leaving&mdash;with, as the Duchess had so
  ironically remarked&mdash;"another excellent testimonial." All her talents,
  her efforts, her charms, her intelligence had been, as usual, of no
  avail.</p>

  <p>"Who," she asked herself, furiously, "am I? Lucille Clery? Mary Showler?
  Lucille Debelleyme? Nameless&mdash;Oh, God! Can I do nothing against this
  intolerable fate?"</p>

  <p>It seemed that perhaps she might. A well-known step interrupted her, and
  the Duke entered. Never had she seen him so animated.</p>

  <p>"You are leaving, Mademoiselle? What is this?"</p>

  <p>"You did not know. Monsieur? Madame dismissed me last night."</p>

  <p>"I did not know."</p>

  <p>She saw that he was as shaken by wrath as she was herself and a deep joy
  displaced her rage; but she continued her packing.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur, pardon me, I have so little time&mdash;-"</p>

  <p>"You are not actually going?"</p>

  <p>"What else? I have been dismissed."</p>

  <p>"It is a mistake. Surely you did not think that I had sanctioned
  this?"</p>

  <p>She read in these words a nervous challenge, and instantly she lied:</p>

  <p>"I believed you knew nothing about it. And I thought it best to leave
  before you knew."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Since I do not please Madame, I cannot stay."</p>

  <p>"She is a sick woman. She does not know what she says&mdash;a Corsican,
  impulsive! I ask you to stay." He looked pale as he added: "I am master
  here&mdash;this is my establishment."</p>

  <p>He paced about the pretty boudoir with the formidable grace of a panther
  preparing for the spring. The governess had a glimpse of the man whom she had
  always suspected him to be and she thrilled with pleasure because she was
  instantly lifted up in her own esteem, she was no longer a helpless creature
  contemptuously cast out of a dependant's place, but a woman who had caused
  trouble, who had found a champion, who was, above all, being treated as an
  equal by this great gentleman. She pressed her advantage.</p>

  <p>"I could not stay. Even a poor servant (I have never been able to count
  myself as more) has some self-respect&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do not speak of yourself like that," he said, harshly. "A woman of your
  education, gifts, presence&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I have never, Monsieur, found that these advantages have helped
  me&mdash;" Sincerity gave a sharp edge to her words; a sleepless night,
  strong emotion had exhausted her, she had lost much of her smooth, assured
  calm. There was something in her then of the woman who had recoiled from the
  drunken sleep of Robert Morrison, the desperate, hunted creature at bay and
  ready to bite; but a wild hope filled her that in this powerful man she had
  really found a protector.</p>

  <p>He stood close to her and said:</p>

  <p>"I beg you to remain, Mademoiselle. Think of this as a mistake&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There could be no mistake in what Madame said&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Leave that to me."</p>

  <p>The large clear eyes of the governess, brilliant with a cold sparkle,
  turned on him a steady look; how far would he stand by her, how far dare she
  go?</p>

  <p>"I can only stay if madame asks me to do so&mdash;-"</p>

  <p>"Very well&mdash;she will ask you. Already she repents her error."</p>

  <p>"Forgive me if I can scarcely believe that, Monsieur. The hostility of
  Madame has been too manifest&mdash;she has it in her power to make my
  position odious&mdash;I am merely a dependant, Madame has
  everything&mdash;forgive me, but the struggle is too unequal, I must retire
  from it&mdash;" And she continued to put her water-colour sketches, her
  sheets of music, her few books, into the trunk. She feared that she was
  pushing him too far, but it was difficult for her to resist the exquisite
  pleasure of hearing someone beg her for a favour, she who had always had to
  do everything in response to commands; not since Robert Morrison's confident
  courtship had she heard anyone ask her for anything.</p>

  <p>"Where are you going, Mademoiselle?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know. I have a relative with whom I can stay. No doubt I shall
  find another place."</p>

  <p>"Do you want to go?"</p>

  <p>Using the truth with fine effect, she replied:</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I am very fond of the children, I like elegance,
  luxury&mdash;but there is something more than these I value&mdash;your
  consideration, your courtesy. You have treated me as an equal. Perhaps you
  can scarcely realise what that means to me."</p>

  <p>He appeared profoundly moved.</p>

  <p>"I have only behaved as you deserve, Mademoiselle."</p>

  <p>She looked at him directly, her hand on her bosom; her natural aptitude
  for extravagant passion, sweeping drama, that she usually kept so carefully
  controlled, pointed her words, her gesture.</p>

  <p>"You have behaved as no one has behaved to me before, Monsieur. I am not
  so spiritless, so crushed that I cannot appreciate that. I will not deny that
  I had hoped to stay in your household&mdash;to show my gratitude&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Stay, Mademoiselle, stay&mdash;I really entreat you."</p>

  <p>"I cannot. I have too much to gain. It would seem self-interest on my
  part. And I fear that I have said too much, have appealed to your pity. It is
  true that I am penniless, friendless, in a most unfortunate position, but I
  never meant to let you know that. I was wrong to indulge in the happiness I
  found here."</p>

  <p>She spoke without conscious falsity; there was something in him that drew
  the truth out of her, and in this case truth served her very well: she was
  then certain that he wished her to stay. What she was not clear about was
  whether he wished her to remain for her own sake, or merely to exert his
  authority against his wife.</p>

  <p>His hesitation ended in an impulsive action that swept away all doubt. He
  took her cold, trembling hand in his massive grasp, and said:</p>

  <p>"If you stay I will see that you are happy; can you trust my promise?"</p>

  <p>"If you think it worth while to make me a promise&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I do."</p>

  <p>They were close together and he was still holding her hand. His air was
  not that of a lover, but of a friend, which she valued more. She sensed that
  here was not a brief, careless intrigue, but something strong, lasting: the
  man admired her, relied on her, she had too, appealed to his chivalry, his
  protective instinct, most subtly flattered a nature afraid of the charge of
  effeminacy, bitterly fearful of domination.</p>

  <p>"I cannot refuse," she said; she gently withdrew her hand, partly because
  she wished to preserve among her weapons an irreproachable decorum, partly
  because his contact disturbed her. He was the first man since Robert Morrison
  who had physically attracted her&mdash;not that she meant to let that trouble
  her&mdash;she had, she thought, all her emotions well in hand.</p>

  <p>He sighed with relief.</p>

  <p>"That is settled, then, and you will come with us to Javiaux du
  Boccage?"</p>

  <p>"Wherever you wish, Monsieur, whatever you wish."</p>

  <p>This was said with passionate sincerity; she felt the almost ferocious
  gratitude of the pariah whose one good quality lies in a fanatic loyalty to a
  saviour.</p>

  <p>"Continue as you are doing, all goes very well, the children are
  happy&mdash;for the first time! Come to me with everything, you understand?
  One must be patient, a little sly, when one seems to concede most one must be
  most tenacious. You understand?"</p>

  <p>She did&mdash;not so much his words as the look from behind the thick
  light lashes; they were to be allies, to confer, to plot, to contrive
  together. She had not been mistaken&mdash;they were akin in spirit and each,
  from the first, had known it; he offered his hand, she took it&mdash;a
  pact.</p>

  <p>M. du Boccage left the governess to empty her trunk, to replace on easels,
  in portfolios and on shelves her books, her dainty drawings of flowers, her
  exquisitely copied music scores. She relaxed into great ease of spirit.</p>

  <p>"He will now tell his wife she must ask me to stay! What a triumph! Never
  have I been so important before! It is a most extraordinary thing that a man
  in his position should support a governess of six weeks' acquaintance against
  his wife&mdash;I must find out all his circumstances&mdash;I must&mdash;more
  than ever&mdash;be very careful."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Madame du Boccage herself brought her children up to their
  usual lessons; she appeared no more suffering, no more languid than usual.
  Whatever had passed between her and her husband, she maintained a dignified,
  almost a casual air, as she said:</p>

  <p>"We have, after all, decided that you had better remain for the present,
  Mademoiselle. Philippe is young for a tutor&mdash;if you would
  care&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am happy to be of some service to Madame." And the governess, secretly
  so secure, permitted herself so clear a glance of cold triumph that the other
  woman turned aside and hid her face as she caressed little Laure.</p>

  <p>After this brief episode the household of the Faubourg St. Honoré swung
  again into the smooth rhythm it had taken on since the ascendancy of
  Mademoiselle Debelleyme; only perhaps the Duchess remained for even longer
  periods in her apartments, went even more seldom into society and the Duke
  stayed a little longer every evening with his children in the charming
  boudoir of the governess, sometimes lingering even after the children had
  gone to bed. They discovered so many tastes in common: music, painting,
  letters, topical events interested them both; he was a fine dilettante in
  many arts, he had a great sense of grandeur and was passionately interested
  in the costly restoration of Javiaux du Boccage. Mademoiselle Debelleyme was
  able to understand, to appreciate, to offer enthusiastic sympathy, an
  intelligent admiration heightened by gratitude, by a hint of awe. Warmed by
  the first genuine companionship of her life she genuinely sparkled; all the
  woman she might have been under happier circumstances showed in these
  interviews, but she never forgot her tact, her arts, her subordinate
  position, the need of delicate, spirited flattery.</p>

  <p>It was no wonder that M. du Boccage prolonged his visits to the nursery
  floor of his great house.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">She resolved that, at all costs, she must read the letters
  in the green desk. As long as she did not know the exact relations between
  husband and wife she was working in a half light. As long as Madame du
  Boccage had any hold on the Duke she might, in any chance moment of nuptial
  reconciliation, triumph, and the governess fall&mdash;if this fertile woman
  produced, for instance, another child, what might she not exact?</p>

  <p>"Best to know just where I stand, how far I may go, how long I may hope to
  remain in this extraordinary, this enchanting, but, I fear, this precarious
  position."</p>

  <p>Her eagerly awaited, anxiously sought opportunity arrived; M. and Madame
  du Boccage were both out, the children driving with Mademoiselle Heller, she
  herself had affected a slight indisposition and would read in her room. It
  was the <i>valet de chambre's</i> day off; the other servants would not be
  likely to spy on her and the hateful Matilde would be enclosed in the
  apartments of her mistress. But as a last precaution the governess took a
  book that the Duke had lent her; if caught, she would say that she had come
  to change this first handsome volume describing the chateaux of France, for
  the second that would doubtless be of an even more absorbing interest.</p>

  <p>With the lightest possible of steps, and a watchful eye, the governess
  crossed the entrance hall, the antechamber, the narrow corridor of the <i>rez
  de chaussée</i> that separated the apartments of the Duke and the Duchess,
  and entered, after an unanswered knock, the delightful little room in which
  stood the green desk. Cautiously she opened the inner door, the bed-chamber
  was empty; well, then, time to do it&mdash;if the drawer was not
  locked&mdash;</p>

  <p>It was not, nor was the gilt and white vellum portfolio that was bulging
  with letters; Mademoiselle Debelleyme stood with another woman's secrets
  completely at her mercy.</p>

  <p>Adroit, quick, listening for a possible interruption, with her delicate
  fingers flicking over page after page, the governess pried, with cold,
  hostile curiosity, into the soul of Fanny du Boccage.</p>

  <p>There were dozens of letters, they went over years, they covered pages,
  they breathed passion, rage, jealousy, despair, all the torments of an
  absorbing love, they were full of every manner of lament, reproach, promise,
  supplication, and yet all showed a touching dignity, an inexhaustible
  tenderness. They were the letters of a romantic, pure, noble woman profoundly
  in love, profoundly tactless, blundering through innocence and excess of
  feeling, frantically alternating, pleading for, and insisting on, a return of
  an affection she had hopelessly lost.</p>

  <p>The governess read with joy these terrible cries of a soul in torment; not
  a throb of compassion softened her triumph as she rapidly put together the
  sequence of events in the tragedy of Madame du Boccage.</p>

  <p>Her husband, married as a boy, had tired, after twelve years and nine
  children, of the pious sweetness, the clinging passion; the exacting jealousy
  of his wife. She had tried to utterly hold, dominate, absorb him, to preserve
  forever the first fervours of the honeymoon; incapable of coquetry, of
  subterfuge, of any art, enervated by her continual child-bearing, of an
  impulsive emotional nature, she had resorted to the fatal expedient of
  reproaches, tears, scenes and the piteous stupidity of espionage And the
  result had been a separation. For three years the unhappy woman had been the
  widow of a living man, for three years he had passed the nights in his own
  rooms, while she anguished, tormented, sleepless, had passed hers in writing
  these frantic, melodramatic, despairing letters, some of which were half
  incoherent in a delirium, of misery, desire and insomnia.</p>

  <p>The governess winced for a second at some of the lines&mdash;drew back as
  if she had been scorched.</p>

  <p>"Mon Dieu, how fearful to love a man like that&mdash;and lose him."</p>

  <p>Eagerly searching the more recent letters she found bitter references to
  herself&mdash;"this light young person who is without religion"&mdash;"this
  impertinent nobody to whom you have dared to give the charge of my
  children"&mdash;"the scandal of the domination of this governess in my
  establishment"&mdash;"ah, she may be capable, clever, an excellent teacher,
  but she has neither principles, heart nor tenderness, she is too light to be
  guided only by a young man in your position&mdash;it is a scandal and soon,
  for all my care, will have the appearance of one"&mdash;</p>

  <p>The governess dared linger no longer; she hurried the letters back, under
  the false smiling gaze of M. de Clare, imposing in his panoply of war, and
  fled quietly to her own room.</p>

  <p>She was much agitated and it took her a little while to realise the
  importance of her discovery.</p>

  <p>The whole hopeless tone of the letters had shown her that the Duke not
  only neglected his wife, but treated her with heartless indifference, refused
  to accede to any of her supplications, endeavoured to separate her entirely
  from her children, ignored her advances, her promises, her entreaties, and
  only kept up an outward semblance of harmony because he could neither afford
  a public scandal nor to forego the Frediani millions. The wretched woman,
  beaten to her knees by his neglect, imploring in vain for a little kindness,
  had, however, behind her, the Church, her powerful father, public opinion,
  all his relatives and the Royal family, all of whom found her an ideal spouse
  and mother.</p>

  <p>She was, as she had the incredible tactlessness to remind him again and
  again, his wife before God and man, and had lost her health, her beauty, her
  ease in giving him heirs to keep his honours flourishing.</p>

  <p>"He must hate her," thought the governess. "What a fool she is&mdash;she
  must have maddened him with scenes till he never goes near her except in
  public, and then she bombards him with these letters! Does he read them? What
  a life! It is indeed an inferno. And my part? He protects me, wishes me to
  stay, he never makes love to me, but in some way I must be necessary to him.
  Well, now I need no longer be afraid of her, she is powerless, poor
  wretch."</p>

  <p>The governess had no pity whatever for the foolish woman who, through
  sheer clumsiness, had made her life so intolerable a burden; she merely
  despised such lunatic methods, scenes, tears, reproaches, espionage. Yes, she
  or Matilde spied on all his movements, she was certain of that. Some of the
  passionate phrases in the letters, some of the wild expressions of love with
  which they all ended, hung in the mind of the governess&mdash;"All the
  happiness that I have ever known has been through you"&mdash;"Ah, my beloved,
  so many memories, so sweet, so dear, so many hopes, is it possible that all
  is ended?"&mdash;"Always I shall love you, never can I forget the
  past&mdash;how good you were to me. God bless you always. God help your poor
  Fanny!"</p>

  <p>The man knows how to make love, evidently, thought the governess; his
  value was immensely increased in her estimation by the other woman's hopeless
  passion and his cold, clever resistance. She was filled with excitement.</p>

  <p>The household in the Faubourg St. Honoré appeared to run as usual but to
  the governess nothing would ever be the same; for at last she understood the
  situation in which she found herself. With that cold, intellectual
  understanding that is entirely devoid of sympathy, she could divine all the
  feelings, foresee all the probable actions of Madame du Boccage, of her
  relatives, her world, and at the same time absolutely comprehend the point of
  view of M. du Boccage, whose behaviour, through his wife's loyalty still
  completely secret, would, were it known, find, the governess was sure, no
  possible supporter. Mademoiselle Debelleyme was well aware that if all the
  circumstances of these continuous quarrels, the long separation there had
  been between husband and wife, were made public, the woman would appear as a
  saint and a martyr, the man as a heartless brute. But the governess was
  passionately sincere in her loyal adherence to the Duke; not only was she
  strongly moved in his favour by his persistent and uncommon kindness towards
  herself, but she was deeply grateful to him for becoming her protector and
  keeping her in a post which she would have lost without his help. From the
  first she had hated the Duchess who had not disguised her candid dislike for
  the new governess. All her temperament, all her ideas, her training were
  against this romantic, sentimental, clumsy woman who was weak enough to be
  jealous, stupid enough to spy, insane enough to make scenes and reproaches,
  to pour out her most secret torments in page after page of melodramatic
  lamentation: the woman who, in brief, had had everything and lost it all, as
  the governess judged, entirely through her own fault. It was not likely that
  Lucille Debelleyme with her hard, bitter experience, should feel any sympathy
  for the wealthy aristocrat who had been pampered all her life, and had
  created out of her own thoughts and weaknesses, so the governess believed,
  the miseries in which she now writhed. Did not that poor fool, his wife, see
  that he had had enough of enclosed, domestic bliss, that he required some
  liberty, some independence, that the youth of seventeen, gentle, sweet and
  easy going, whom she had married, was not the same as the vigorous developed
  man of over thirty? He was now in the full flower of his prime, while she, as
  with incredible tactlessness she noted again and again in her letters to him,
  had already lost that dazzling southern beauty which had at first attracted
  him.</p>

  <p>The governess looked at her own face in the pretty little mirror that hung
  above the pianette in her boudoir. A few weeks of luxurious living and ease
  of mind had improved to an astonishing degree the beauty that Lady Anfield
  had not noticed and that had even escaped the searching glance of the French
  Ambassadress.</p>

  <p>Lucille Debelleyme was now a charming, a lovely woman; she took a great
  deal of care with her appearance and no longer obscured any of her good
  points with clumsy dressing. Her hair fell in fashionable curls, her dresses
  were well cut to show off her slender, yet voluptuous figure. Though she was
  careful not to depart in a single particular from the decorum enjoined by her
  position, she had not the air, either in her dress or her appearance, of a
  dependant; indeed, after she had read the unhappy letters of Madame du
  Boccage she had rather the air of the mistress, both of the situation and the
  establishment.</p>

  <p>She pursued her agreeable duties with an added zest, she put even more
  enthusiasm into tending the children, in whose company she really delighted,
  she was even more resolutely firm and yet gracious with her servants, she
  received M. du Boccage with a yet franker delight in his company, and on the
  rare occasions when she saw the languishing Duchess she greeted her with a
  curtsy which had more than a hint of mockery, and it became one of her chief
  pleasures to reconstruct in her mind the scenes which, no doubt, took place
  almost daily in the <i>rez de chaussée</i>, of which she would be the main
  cause, the Duchess clamouring for her dismissal, the Duke coldly refusing
  it...</p>

  <p>But Lucille Debelleyme, bitterly schooled, by long misfortune, did not
  lose her head; though she sometimes permitted herself the most enticing
  dreams, her sternest enemy could have found no fault with her outward
  behaviour.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The governess, however, for all her discretion and tact,
  believed that now the foundations were so solid beneath her, she might risk
  stretching out a hand for further advantages, and she ventured to introduce,
  subtly and delicately, a personal note, an intimate air into the hitherto
  impersonal conversations that she had with the Duke almost every evening when
  he came to consult with her about the education of his children.</p>

  <p>She directly asked him when the family were going to Javiaux du Boccage or
  to Locroi in Normandy?</p>

  <p>He seemed slightly confused at the question, but said "that he did not
  know."</p>

  <p>The governess then put forward a definite point of view.</p>

  <p>"It is a matter to which I should go to Madame but I dislike to trouble
  her as she is so ill! I fear she has been suffering more greatly these last
  few days. The heat is increasing in Paris. Ah well... what I have to say ...
  Perhaps I have not sufficient of your confidence?"</p>

  <p>He encouraged these pretty broken words with a deepening of his amiable
  smile.</p>

  <p>The governess continued smoothly:</p>

  <p>"My salary is more than I have ever received before. It is certainly
  sufficient for my services but, for the sake of the children, you are aware,
  Monsieur, that I take them out a great deal, to concerts, to entertainments,
  for drives? I have never" (her large clear eyes gave him a bold, flattering
  look which was in contradiction to the quiet respect of her words) "been in
  such an establishment as yours before. I am not in every way equipped. If I
  am to remain much longer in Paris I shall require new dresses; for the
  country also I shall require different clothes... "</p>

  <p>"You may have," he interrupted pleasantly, negligently, "all you
  wish."</p>

  <p>"I shall not trespass on your easiness," she replied, "I was only about to
  ask that I might have a few items from Mademoiselle Rose, Madame's
  dressmaker."</p>

  <p>"Why should you wish to go there?" he remarked with a flight irritation.
  "Choose your own establishment, Mademoiselle, and send the account to
  me."</p>

  <p>"Impossible," she objected. "Monsieur must understand the delicacy of my
  position. What I require is for Madame's service and must go on to her
  account."</p>

  <p>"As you please," he agreed indifferently, and she wondered if he was
  clever enough to understand the meaning behind her words, which was 'though
  she could not accept the least present from him personally, he might give her
  what he would under cover of his wife's name.'</p>

  <p>She said no more on the subject, she showed him a charming little pastel
  drawn by his eldest daughter but her brilliant smile was not all for pleasure
  in the child's work; she was thinking of the lively scene Madame du Boccage
  would make when she saw gowns, bonnets, gloves, parasols for the governess
  added on to her account with Mademoiselle Rose, the most fashionable, the
  most expensive dressmaker in Paris.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Mademoiselle Debelleyme found, as she expected to find, that
  she had not a single ally among the magnificent train of relatives, friends
  and acquaintances of the house of du Boccage, who came and went in the
  splendid salons of the Faubourg St. Honoré; indeed, as her ascendancy
  obviously increased, so did their hostility. Her sense of character assured
  her that the Duchess, proud and sensitive, had not complained, but she was
  perfectly well aware that her own position was extraordinary and must be
  adversely commented upon, yet by the great sweetness of her manner, her
  tactful avoidance of all possible cause of complaint she had warded off, she
  thought, any open protest, though of course she could not be aware of what
  was said privately to M. du Boccage?</p>

  <p>But nothing appeared to ruffle his serenity, he was gay and amiable;
  daily, under one excuse or another, he detached himself more and more from
  his wife and led with zest and pleasure an indolent, amusing, fashionable
  life, that of a courtier, a man of wealth and taste, but rather in
  contradiction with these qualities, he showed an increasing interest in his
  children; he was the most indulgent, the most charming of fathers.</p>

  <p>Even Lucille Debelleyme sometimes wondered why the growing affection for
  his children did not inspire him with some tenderness for their mother.
  "But," thought the governess, "she's driven him hard, bit and spur together,
  the fool."</p>

  <p>There was one only of the great personages who surrounded the maison du
  Boccage that the governess had been able to ingratiate herself with and that
  was the old blind Dowager Duchess, widow of the late Duke Felix.</p>

  <p>Her eldest son was not her first child and the Duchess, nearly seventy and
  long since completely blind with cataract, lived, in that modest fashion
  imposed on her by a lifetime spent with a miser husband, in an apartment in
  the Faubourg St. Germain. Mademoiselle Debelleyme often took the children to
  visit their grandmother and had contrived to give the impression of a weak,
  timid, depressed creature who was, for the first time, enjoying a little
  liberty, a few pleasures.</p>

  <p>Old Madame du Boccage adored her son and Mademoiselle Debelleyme mingled a
  few discreet praises of the Duke with her continuous stream of gratitude for
  the benefits conferred on her by her residence in the sumptuous establishment
  of the Faubourg St. Honoré.</p>

  <p>The old lady was moved, was won, for the governess was careful not to say
  a single word against the Duchess but praised her continually for her piety,
  her charity, and lamented her increasing ill health.</p>

  <p>It rather amused Mademoiselle Debelleyme to dress herself in some fine
  creation from the clever hands of Mademoiselle Rose, to make herself look as
  beautiful, as dignified as possible, then to conduct the children to their
  grandmother and, seating herself on a stool before the old lady's hooded
  chair, pose as a poor plain creature, who could expect nothing in this life
  but must look for her reward in heaven.</p>

  <p>She could keep it up for half an hour very well and the old lady was
  touched by the tales of this young person who had been helped through many
  trials by the aid of religion. Knowing that she was in complete confidence
  with her son and likely to repeat anything of interest to him, Lucille
  Debelleyme thought it well to tell Madame du Boccage the story of Robert
  Morrison, carefully coloured, of course, to suit her audience. The chance was
  given her by the Dowager asking her once:</p>

  <p>"How it was that she had not married a good fellow in her own rank of
  life, who would have relieved her from the state of dependency?"</p>

  <p>In a low voice the governess replied: "That she had had several offers but
  none of them from men whose person she could admire, whose character she
  could respect."</p>

  <p>"Have you never, then, my poor child, been in love?"</p>

  <p>"Once," sighed the governess, "and it was nearly my undoing. Oh, Madame, I
  was so young at the time, I had no mother to advise me. I was an instructress
  in Bath, I worked too hard, my superiors were harsh, I have always been
  homely."</p>

  <p>"They tell me you are very pretty," interrupted Madame du Boccage. "my son
  always speaks of you as most charming."</p>

  <p>Forgetting for a moment that she was with a blind person, Mademoiselle
  Debelleyme lowered her eyes to hide her fierce pleasure, but her voice was
  unchanged as she continued:</p>

  <p>"Ah, that, Madame, is mere polite condescension on the part of Monsieur du
  Boccage! I have few charms but I had indeed then the bloom of youth and
  attracted the attention of a young man who protested that he felt for me an
  honourable affection. He was in a good position and I must confess, not only
  did he win my heart, but I was attracted by the thought of leaving an odious
  servitude."</p>

  <p>She stopped as if overcome with the bitterness of her recollection,
  perhaps, indeed, she was so. She could not think of Robert Morrison with
  equanimity even now, and the kind old lady patted her hand, where it rested
  on the arm of the hooded chair. She asked with sympathy:</p>

  <p>"And what went wrong, my dear? Why did not he marry you, I am sure you
  would be a good wife for any man."</p>

  <p>"He did not think so, Madame. I discovered, thank God in time, that his
  intentions were not honourable. He wanted me but did not wish to marry me. He
  promised me, Madame, independence, riches, an apartment in Paris, a carriage,
  my own maid, all the lures usually offered to unfortunate creatures like
  myself."</p>

  <p>"And of course you refused?" commented the old Duchess tenderly. "You had
  the courage, my dear? It must have been difficult, especially if you liked
  the wretch."</p>

  <p>Lucille Debelleyme sighed:</p>

  <p>"I more than liked him, but I hope you know me well enough, Madame, to
  believe that I did refuse him! It was a shock from which I have even now
  scarcely recovered."</p>

  <p>The Dowager Madame du Boccage deeply sympathised with this pathetic
  tale.</p>

  <p>"I know," she declared, "something of the perils, the vicissitudes to
  which young ladies in the forlorn position of yourself are exposed! But you
  will have no trials like that in this establishment," she said, "my
  daughter-in-law does not encourage rakes or libertines. Hers is the warmest,
  the kindest of hearts and if you are in any trouble go to her at once. I hope
  after all, my dear, that you will find a good husband. You are so fond of
  children and so wonderful with them that it would be a pity if you were not
  to have any of your own."</p>

  <p>Mademoiselle Debelleyme now took up a subject which she had already
  insinuated several times with the Dowager Madame du Boccage. "She wished
  above all to go to the Opera before the season was over and the children were
  too young and Madame du Boccage never went... it was of course not to be
  thought of for her to join a party without her mistress though she had had
  several offers. She was a passionate lover of music, she wanted to hear I
  Puritani which was to be given next Thursday... Mademoiselle Schickler, the
  betrothed of Comte Edouard, had been so kind as to make it possible for her
  to go with these two charming young people, to sit behind the heiress in the
  box as attendant shadow, completely effaced if only she might hear the
  music!"</p>

  <p>The Dowager Madame du Boccage was accompanying her son herself, she could
  not see any reason in the world why the obliging, the simple young governess
  should not be one of the party; she did not know that the refused offers to
  which Lucille Debelleyme referred had come from the Duke himself... the
  governess had rejected such reckless generosity with smiling, cold dignity.
  She did not wish to compromise herself by such a public flaunting of her
  supremacy in the household of the Faubourg St. Honoré, but she did want to go
  to the Opera, she did want to show herself beautifully turned out to all her
  enemies. She thought: "How lucky it is that the old Dowager is blind, if she
  had her sight she would never give her consent."</p>

  <p>The Comte Edouard was a little surprised and Mademoiselle Schickler a
  little doubtful when the suggestion was made to take the new governess to the
  Opera, but old Madame du Boccage insisted that it would be the harshest
  unkindness to refuse a timid request put forward by a poor young person who
  had had so few pleasures in her life, who would sit quietly at the back of
  the box, and be no trouble to anyone. "If Fanny was not in such continual ill
  health she would take her herself," declared the kind old woman, "and I am
  very pleased to be able to offer such an estimable young woman this little
  kindness."</p>

  <p>Count Edouard and his betrothed exchanged glances. There had not yet
  exactly been any gossip or scandal attached to Mademoiselle Debelleyme but
  everyone thought there very soon might be. If Madame du Boccage had not
  appeared so perfectly satisfied there would surely have been already. The
  position was certainly a curious one but as everything appeared so smiling
  and peaceful in the establishment in the Faubourg St. Honoré there was no
  cause for any comment, and why trouble the old lady's simple conception of a
  homely young creature pleading for a little diversion?</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Step by step the governess had won; she felt like a general
  who takes the enemy's outposts in a slow, steady progress. She was going to
  the Opera, going to sit in the Du Boccage box in company with the Dowager, in
  full decorum, but also in full splendour, everyone would have to look at her,
  and no one would be able to say anything against her.</p>

  <p>Fanny du Boccage would rage, no doubt, be wounded to the quick, but she
  would be powerless, and the Duke, the man who had befriended her, the man who
  seemed to admire and need her, though he never said so, would see her as she
  could look.</p>

  <p>She had the advantage of the Duchess' account with Mademoiselle Rose. She
  was secure of her gown, there remained only her jewels. She had nothing
  whatever suitable, only a few garnets, a cameo, a tortoiseshell chain, and
  while she appeared to absorb herself in her lessons and her games with the
  children she was thinking deeply, wondering by what subtle or daring move she
  could secure a parure to wear on Thursday. She decided to try her one friend;
  the Duke knew she was going to accompany his mother to the Opera, he said
  that he himself might go, he wished to hear I Puritani again. It was a pity
  that Madame, his wife, was too unwell to attend this gala performance. The
  doctors had said she must forego all social duties for the present until she
  had cured her insomnia.</p>

  <p>M. du Boccage asked the governess, with a Frenchman's delicate
  consideration in such matters, if she had a suitable gown for this uncommon
  occasion?</p>

  <p>"Through Monsieur's kindness I have a robe de style from Mademoiselle Rose
  but I have no jewels. I hope I shall not look ridiculous," smiled the
  governess. "It was perhaps a little presumptuous of me to wish to go. My love
  for music has led me into a false position."</p>

  <p>He gave her a look which shook her superb self-assurance a little.</p>

  <p>"You shall have the jewels, there will be no difficulty about that."</p>

  <p>"I could not accept," she began with a proud reserve.</p>

  <p>"I offer you nothing," he interrupted, "you may take a parure for the one
  evening," and with that smiling negligence she so admired in him, he added:
  "It will be no obligation to you and a pleasure to me. I hope you will enjoy
  the music, Mademoiselle."</p>

  <p>On the Wednesday afternoon Henri, the Duke's <i>valet de chambre</i>,
  delivered a large case at the apartments of the governess. She opened it
  &gt;and discovered, set out on white velvet, a superb set of emeralds. Her
  heart beat with an excitement which made it difficult for her to maintain a
  very necessary calm. Ambition, that she had hitherto discarded as foolish and
  dangerous, again rose in her heart. She began to believe that she had
  underestimated her own attraction, her own power, had been too cautious, too
  slow; she resolved in that moment to move more boldly, to strike more
  deliberately for her own advantage.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch17"
     name="ch17">CHAPTER XVII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The splendid heavy antique coach of the Dowager Duchess du
  Boccage arrived at the Faubourg St. Honoré for the governess, who waited
  alone in the antechamber. The Duke, if he came at all, would follow later;
  the Duchess had not been visible all day. Lucille Debelleyme knew that the
  whole atmosphere of the house was filled with apprehension, tension,
  excitement, but she was herself suave, smooth and smiling.</p>

  <p>The mantle that enveloped her was dark, decorous, a dull violet velvet, a
  loose hood of fine black lace covered her long fair curls; without any
  artificial aid her complexion was dazzling, her features were exquisite in
  their exact, firm outline.</p>

  <p>She saw the Comte Edouard look at her uneasily, and Mademoiselle
  Schickler, the spoilt heiress, with a little grimace of disdain. The
  governess was not abashed, tonight she was neither to be patronised nor
  ignored.</p>

  <p>A well-known step caused her to turn her head; M. du Boccage came from the
  salon de reception. Lucille Debelleyme, a little frightened, cast off her
  dull-coloured cloak. It was impossible to consider the woman revealed as a
  governess, as a dependant, as anything but a beautiful woman. Lucille
  Debelleyme exactly suited the mode and she had further the exquisite art of
  making the mode exactly suit her, and set off her fragile charm; woman and
  dress appeared one, the smooth pale shoulders were barely distinguishable
  from the smooth pale satin of the bodice; her long hair might have been woven
  of the same material as the filmy lace shawl that drooped over her arms. All
  this delicate beauty was emphasised by the emeralds, which like drops of
  green fire glittered round her throat and small wrists.</p>

  <p>The young Comte gave his brother a startled, reproachful glance;
  Mademoiselle Schickler flushed with irritation. This sudden beauty on the
  part of a servant seemed to her a piece of effrontery that she did not know
  how to deal with; she fidgeted with her gloves. The old blind woman stood
  benevolent, smiling, leaning on the arm of her younger son, while the elder
  M. du Boccage remained inside the folding doors, his hat in his hand, looking
  at the governess with his expressionless smile on his sensual lips and his
  dark eyes almost completely veiled by the thick, fair lashes.</p>

  <p>It was Lucille Debelleyme's moment, and she knew how best to turn it into
  one of complete triumph. With a graceful movement she swept over the black
  and white tiles to Madame du Boccage, dropped a low curtsy and, kissing the
  old lady's hand, murmured in a voice that seemed to tremble with emotion:</p>

  <p>"How can I thank you, dear Madame, for such an evening of undeserved
  pleasure!" There was no obvious mock modesty about this action, which
  appeared simple, dignified, touching.</p>

  <p>The coldness of the Comte Edouard and his betrothed increased but the old
  lady placed her hand on the smooth ringlets of the governess and murmured in
  a gratified tone:</p>

  <p>"I am very glad, my poor child, to be able to give you this little
  entertainment."</p>

  <p>As Mademoiselle Debelleyme again fastened her cloak over her illicit
  beauty to which she knew everyone who saw her tonight would feel she had no
  right, she gave a sly glance at her one friend; his subtle smile increased,
  she thought his lips formed the word "<i>brava</i>."</p>

  <p>"I congratulate you. Mademoiselle," remarked the Comte Edouard, drily, "on
  your magnificent parure of emeralds."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Monsieur," replied the governess with humility, "they are
  indeed beautiful and it gives me great enjoyment to wear them."</p>

  <p>Coming forward, swinging his gloves, the Duke said to his brother with the
  utmost ease:</p>

  <p>"I lent them to Mademoiselle for to-night. I bought them two years ago in
  London. Fanny did not like them&mdash;I thought to have them reset for
  her&mdash;I put them aside and forgot them. Tonight they have served some
  purpose."</p>

  <p>Mademoiselle Schickler, who was a great heiress and thought in terms of
  money, permitted herself the vulgarity of saying:</p>

  <p>"They must be worth a great deal."</p>

  <p>The elder M. du Boccage replied with the lightest, coldest courtesy:</p>

  <p>"They are certainly worth something now&mdash;when Mademoiselle Debelleyme
  wears them, one discerns in them an unexpected beauty."</p>

  <p>The Opera was all that Mademoiselle Debelleyme had dreamed it might be.
  Amid that brilliant crowd she felt the triumph of a beautiful woman who feels
  she is in her proper surrounding. Her will was strong enough to enable her to
  forget she was there on sufferance, an intruder, an outsider, that never
  again might she taste such a moment. She enjoyed herself, therefore, without
  any thought of the morrow.</p>

  <p>She, naturally (but without servility) took her place at the back of the
  loge, with the two men of the party, but it was also natural that the old
  Duchess, who had procured for her this rare entertainment, should offer her a
  seat in front. This was not refused and Lucille Debelleyme sat beside the
  rich, sulky heiress, Marie Schickler, in one of the finest boxes of the
  Opera, and had the intense gratification of knowing that she had entirely
  eclipsed the mediocre dark charms of her companion, who formed indeed a
  perfect foil to her radiant fairness. She was stared at immoderately,
  lorgnettes and glasses were perpetually turned in her direction. It seemed to
  her that she could feel against her ears the murmur of curiosity, of
  hostility, which was passing from lip to lip as she was noted, named and
  commented upon. She enjoyed this, it was amusing to provoke a scandal and to
  know that she was impregnable both in her real virtue and in her appearance
  of virtue. Who could say anything while the venerated blind Dowager sat
  beside her and spoke to her so kindly, while that spotless virgin,
  Mademoiselle Schickler, with however ill a will, was forced to endure her
  company?</p>

  <p>The governess took pleasure in the knowledge that all the malicious
  gossips were really wrong&mdash;she was as virtuous, as pure as she appeared
  to be. Not a single word to which the most rigid prude could object had ever
  passed between her and M. du Boccage.</p>

  <p>She smiled to herself as she reflected how bewildered many of those who
  stared at her with such inquisitiveness must be, Their first impulse would of
  course be to proclaim her as the mistress of her employer but at the same
  time they must be rather confused that he allowed her to sit beside his
  mother, still kept her for the instructing of his young children. She felt
  her position inviolate, far stronger than if she was really involved in a
  vulgar and therefore brief intrigue.</p>

  <p>If all these people only knew how intensely cold she was, how she had
  learnt her lesson; if they could be but aware of that episode with Robert
  Morrison which had told her to be so ironically careful in all her dealings
  with men. Yet there was a certain sting in her transitory triumph also; she
  had once dreamed it differently. She was not sitting there as the Honourable
  Mrs. Morrison, wife of a wealthy English aristocrat, possibly (as she had
  once imagined) an English duchess, moving elegantly in the highest circles of
  Paris, mingling in politics, intriguing with men of affairs; nor was she
  there as a successful courtesan with her following of lovers, her maids and
  her apartment and her carriage, with all the extreme luxuries of her
  profession, which she had once, for a few hours only, thought the infatuated
  Englishman might give her... No, she was there, after all, as a dependant in
  a false position. Neither wife nor mistress, but a servant dressed up for a
  party.</p>

  <p>Her behaviour was perfect, she addressed herself exclusively to the
  Dowager Madame du Boccage, ignoring the genteel rudeness of Mademoiselle
  Schickler and the brusque courtesy of the Comte Edouard. M. Le Due du Boccage
  also behaved admirably, covering all possible embarrassment with his correct
  elegance that the fashion of the moment called "English coldness" and was
  considered so admirable.</p>

  <p>He stood next to the governess and kept his attention on the stage; in the
  persistent dazzle of the gas globes she could, whenever she chose to look up,
  see his face clearly. He smiled in unmoved idle good-humour, amiable,
  expressionless; his hand lay on the red velvet edge of the box close to her
  still fingers holding the programme.</p>

  <p>She dared not look up at him for long; but a downcast, demure pose suited
  well with a scrutiny of his hand, the useless strength of which was so in
  contrast to his delicate linen, the velvet cuff, the dark-blue sparkle of the
  sapphire stud.</p>

  <p>Although they did not touch each other, even by the tips of their fingers,
  nor look at each other at all, the governess was conscious of a current of
  violent, exciting, powerful feeling passing between them.</p>

  <p>So strong was this, that, despite her exquisite self-control, she was
  shaken by a bitter surge of rebellion at the thought of the| insurmountable
  barriers between herself and this man.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The emotions of this curious evening were not over at the
  fall of the curtain, nor with the return of Lucille Debelleyme to the
  Faubourg St. Honoré, nor with her grateful and charming farewells of the
  Dowager Madame du Boccage, with her timid thanks to M. Du Boccage and her
  modest retiring to her apartment, to take off the borrowed emeralds and put
  them in their case.</p>

  <p>It was late and all the household (she had believed) was asleep; but the
  Duchess, always restless, tortured by jealousy and insomnia, had waited for
  her return. The unhappy woman, in a storm of feeling, brusquely entered the
  pretty apartment of the governess; her quilted chamber-gown was untidily
  gathered round her full uncorseted figure, her eyelids were wrinkled and
  stained either from tears or lack of sleep, and her hair fell in a tangle on
  her shoulders as if she had continually pushed impatient fingers through it
  in a desperate gesture to relieve an aching head.</p>

  <p>Lucille Debelleyme immediately understood and mastered the situation; she
  stood by her bed, illuminated by the soft light of a lamp with an opal globe,
  and in her pale satin gown, herself colourless from excitement and emotion,
  appeared unearthly as a shadow.</p>

  <p>"Ah, Madame, you are ill! if I can do something for you! I am sorry I am
  so late, I had no idea how the time went&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The Duchess, with trembling dignity, cut short these false protestations,
  the value of which she knew perfectly well.</p>

  <p>"Where have you been. Mademoiselle, in that attire? And what are those
  jewels you have in your hand? I am informed that you have been to the Opera,
  wearing emeralds that my husband gave you."</p>

  <p>"I thought they came from you," smiled the governess, opening wide her
  brilliant eyes. "Were they not some cast-off jewels of your own, Madame, that
  you did not care to wear until they were reset? It was great kindness in the
  Dowager Madame du Boccage to offer me one of the seats in her box to-night,
  when I was to hear for the first time, and I daresay for the last time, a
  performance at the Opera. I believed that you allowed this kindness. Am I
  mistaken?"</p>

  <p>The Duchess sat down heavily, with the weary sigh of a woman overwhelmed
  by emotion.</p>

  <p>"Do not seek to deceive and bewilder me, you know that what you have done
  is outrageous, and you must also know that I was not aware of it."</p>

  <p>Erect, slim, resolute, holding before her like a shield the case of
  jewels, the governess replied with coldness:</p>

  <p>"You must speak to M. du Boccage, Madame, it was he who gave me to
  understand that I had your permission."</p>

  <p>Folding her hands over her disordered garments the other woman
  exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"You have no self-respect, you have no idea of decorum or dignity. How is
  it possible for me to entrust my children to you?"</p>

  <p>"In everything, Madame, I obey the orders of M. du Boccage."</p>

  <p>"Do not keep repeating that name, please. You must be well aware&mdash;"
  but the forsaken wife, distraught as she was, caught herself up; the
  interview was approaching a dangerous point where she would not be able to
  handle it at all. Rising, with her air of frank dignity, she added: "It is
  not a matter for discussion, Mademoiselle. It is a matter for a reprimand. I
  cannot believe you were under a misconception to-night. Shrewd as you are it
  must have been clear to you that your action was&mdash;impossible."</p>

  <p>Afraid of saying too much she left the room with an agitated movement,
  allowing the door to fall heavily to behind her; the governess sprang after
  her, caught the handle even as the latch slipped into place, and went out
  into the corridor so swiftly that they were suddenly face to face.</p>

  <p>"Forgive me, Madame, I cannot be left like this, the position is
  intolerable."</p>

  <p>"To me, also," replied the Duchess recoiling, and making a forbidding
  gesture with her shaking hand as if she waved some venomous creature aside.
  "Believe me. Mademoiselle, to me, also."</p>

  <p>She passed down the passage to the <i>rez de chaussée</i> and began
  heavily to descend the ornate stairs with the scrolled, gilt bannister.</p>

  <p>"I have been spied on," thought Lucille Debelleyme. "Matilde, no doubt.
  Everything in this house is watched and noted. I had better do a little of
  that myself."</p>

  <p>The dim night-lamps set on the painted walls illuminated the expanse of
  the shadowed stairway, and there the governess lingered in the obscurity
  watching the slow descent of Madame du Boccage. It was not perhaps prudent to
  spy on her mistress, but she had heard a familiar step in the hall below and
  longed to hear at least a few words between husband and wife; her painful
  curiosity was eased. As soon as the Duke saw the heavy figure descending so
  laboriously to the <i>rez de chaussée</i> he demanded imperiously:</p>

  <p>"Well, Madame, where have you been at this time of night? Why are you not
  in your own apartment?"</p>

  <p>The answer came in a voice made harsh by anguish:</p>

  <p>"How is it possible you found the courage to do what you did
  to-night?&mdash;this young person... "</p>

  <p>He broke in, his tone usually so soft and gentle, was rough.</p>

  <p>"These incriminations are useless, dare to say she is my mistress!"</p>

  <p>"I do not say so, Camille, and I do not think so in the full force of the
  word. You would not so affront your children; besides, I know you have other
  diversions, it is not she who fills your life, but she has the air of doing
  so, it is of that I complain! She takes my place, she tries to dominate in
  everything."</p>

  <p>With intense bitterness he interrupted:</p>

  <p>"You to talk of domination!" and he flung from her; his wife, half
  moaning, followed him, the doors of the antechamber that led to their
  apartments closed on them, the governess heard no more. She hovered a moment
  in the silence, then went lightly to her pleasant room, her comfortable
  bed.</p>

  <p>She was excited, exhausted; the drama in which she had so profitably
  involved herself became every day more interesting.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch19"
     name="ch19">CHAPTER XIX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">As she lay, warm and drowsy in her bed, it did occur to
  Lucille Debelleyme: "What would a good woman do under my circumstances? Is
  there such a thing as a good woman?" came the quick reflection. She would not
  leave the Faubourg St. Honoré. She would not say to herself: "I cannot be the
  cause of this terrible dissension between husband and wife, I cannot be a
  further instrument of torment to a woman already half mad with unhappiness, I
  cannot steal these children from their mother, this husband from his wife, I
  cannot remain here making my pleasure and my profit out of the miseries of
  another."</p>

  <p>She wondered, as she lay there, whether there existed any woman who would
  do this.</p>

  <p>She supposed so, there must be these ideal beings somewhere, women who
  were not absorbed in their own profit, who believed in God; women who,
  thought Lucille Debelleyme with a sneer, were afraid of God, who would argue:
  "This is wrong, I am wicked; I am, perhaps, condoning a crime, nothing but
  evil can come out of this situation and for my share in it the Father will
  surely punish me."</p>

  <p>Lucille Debelleyme had no such fear, she did not believe in God, she
  thought she had her own human destiny well in hand. She felt no pity for the
  woman whose place she was gradually, and with such cleverness usurping.</p>

  <p>"I have had nothing out of life, nothing at all, my duty to myself is to
  get all I can. I will not yield, as long as this man supports me I will get
  the last drop of pleasure, of power, of profit out of this extraordinary good
  luck."</p>

  <p>She fell smilingly asleep, the music of the Opera in her ears, the little
  lights of the Opera before her eyes, and mingled with them hundreds of
  curious, hostile but powerless glances, whose impudent malice she had so much
  enjoyed; while through all her dreams darted the cold rays of the only jewels
  she had ever worn, the icy sparkle of the emeralds given her by M. du
  Boccage.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch20"
     name="ch20">CHAPTER XX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">But it appeared that the governess had been a little too
  self-confident in her triumph at the Opera; the next day when the Duke
  inspected his children's lessons he informed her casually but definitely that
  he had changed his plans, he would go to Javiaux du Boccage to supervise the
  restorations there and she would go with the Duchess and the children to
  Locroi in Normandy.</p>

  <p>As he unfolded his scheme to the governess she understood that they had
  gone too far, that it was necessary to give way, to concede all along the
  line. Probably the outraged wife had spoken of a separation, of appealing to
  her father, even to the Court, and her husband had found it necessary to
  dissimulate, to placate her, even perhaps to pretend a reconciliation.</p>

  <p>"Madame wishes to undertake the education of the children herself, it is
  perhaps her right, I will not disguise that she has taken very hardly the
  experiment I made in handing over so much authority to you, though it was to
  spare her ill health, her excitable temperament. Well, now let us try another
  way, you will go to Locroi, she will have full charge, you will stand aside,
  work under her, do as she bids you, and when I return from Javiaux du Boccage
  I will judge the result."</p>

  <p>As usual he had the air of saying what he did not mean, as usual the
  governess looked to his smiling glance for his true intentions.</p>

  <p>"It is an excellent idea," she agreed amiably. "Madame is obviously
  suffering; it would be well to avoid all that could give her nervous
  excitement. In the peace of the country no doubt she will recover her
  equanimity. I will resign everything to her hands."</p>

  <p>"You help me immensely, Mademoiselle. Perhaps you will wait on Madame and
  unfold to her this plan yourself?"</p>

  <p>She agreed at once and in the same breath thanked him for her
  entertainment of the night before and handed him back the case of emeralds.
  She knew that the Duchess was quite incapable of conducting the children's
  education, that the experiment was bound to end in disaster, that the Duke
  intended that it should do so. What did she care as long as she was allowed
  to remain in her place? She was perfectly ready to take even an apologetic
  attitude towards her mistress; what did it matter? The wretched woman was, in
  advance, defeated on all points.</p>

  <p>She sought out Madame du Boccage, endured with a smile the icy insolence
  of Matilde, her worst enemy in a household where all were hostile to her, who
  spied on her and hated her bitterly. What did the governess care? M. du
  Boccage was playing a subtle game which she understood and would assist
  without the need of instructions.</p>

  <p>She was admitted into the presence of the Duchess, whose haggard
  appearance showed the miserable night she had passed; the governess did not
  hesitate to apologise for her behaviour of the night before.</p>

  <p>"Madame would have the generosity to believe that it was entirely a
  mistake. Old Madame du Boccage was kind, I should not have accepted but I was
  tempted&mdash;Ah, Madame, if you knew how little I have ever enjoyed you
  would realise how difficult I found it to refuse, how I perhaps lost my head;
  now I see that I was wrong, I have come to ask your pardon."</p>

  <p>The Duchess flushed; this made her own behaviour of the night before,
  already in her own generous judgment contemptible, appear detestable.</p>

  <p>"Say no more, Mademoiselle. All is over, think no more about it. I hope,
  if I can a little regain my health, to go to the Opera myself one night and I
  can then offer you a seat in my box."</p>

  <p>The governess curtsied in silent gratitude.</p>

  <p>"But that, after all," sighed Madame du Boccage, "is a mere detail, a
  matter of nervous irritation. I have more than that to complain of.
  Mademoiselle," and in a voice harsh with suppressed sobs she stammered: "I
  have to complain of the fact that you take my children away from me and I am
  never allowed to see them, that you are in their company day and night." She
  could no longer command her words; the governess coolly took up the broken
  sentence.</p>

  <p>"Why do you suppose that I have performed any such project! I was afraid
  that for the moment your health does not permit you to undertake the heavy
  task of educating all these little ones&mdash;Monsieur le Duc has always said
  so, so he says to the children, that and nothing else. For a little while I
  tried to take your place, I fear with poor success. Now if you feel equal to
  having your family around you there is nothing for me but to efface myself.
  Monsieur told me to do so even now."</p>

  <p>"Did he?" asked the unhappy mother with a gleam of ingenuous hope in her
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"He did, indeed, Madame; he said we were all to go to Locroi while he goes
  to Javiaux du Boccage, and that I was to leave you in full control. Did I
  not," added the governess with a smile, "from the first, Madame, ask you to
  interfere more, to show a deeper interest in our little world above the
  <i>rez de chaussée</i>?"</p>

  <p>The Duchess hesitated; she was plainly baffled as to what sincerity there
  might be in these declarations, as she had been baffled as to the degree of
  sincerity in the protestations made to her by her husband, brought about, she
  feared, solely by the growing scandal in Paris, by some remarks dropped by
  her father, by some comments made by members of the royal family, by fear of
  a legal separation, of losing the children, of losing her money, by his dread
  of a scandal... which would mean that he would have to give up all that made
  life agreeable to him.</p>

  <p>Fanny du Boccage sighed; only one thing would have pleased her, would
  really have eased her implacable anguish, and that would have been the
  dismissal of Lucille Debelleyme. But this was impossible for her to obtain as
  she was bitterly aware, so she accepted what she could get in the way of
  concession, and in her heart trembled the hope that all her prayers to God,
  all her supplications to the man who had once been her lover and was still
  her husband, might at last have been answered, and that there might be some
  sincerity in this sudden offer of reconciliation. She accepted therefore with
  dignity, with ingenuous candour, the project of these peaceful holidays to be
  spent in Locroi.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch21"
     name="ch21">CHAPTER XXI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It was a wonderful summer. Day after day of unclouded
  sunshine sent a haze of gold over the lovely Norman meadows, and Madame du
  Boccage with her little family and their governess installed themselves in
  the chateau of Locroi. They did not, however, inhabit the recently restored
  Gothic building in the midst of a large wooded park, but used a small
  pleasure house in Italian style, built in the elegant taste of the
  mid-eighteenth century, near a vast, magnificent orangery.</p>

  <p>This charming house of pale rose-coloured bricks and amber-hued marble,
  with Corinthian columns and balustrades wreathed by clematis vines and
  convolvulus, stood on the banks of a stream which hurried beneath the
  graceful tresses of golden willows. This was Fanny du Boccage's own property,
  one of her marriage gifts to her husband; she returned to it with the same
  pleasure that a child might return home.</p>

  <p>As soon as she was among her own people, the peasantry who adored her, the
  poor who came in crowds to implore her charity, the priest who came to offer
  his blessing, her burden seemed to fall from the spirit of the tormented
  woman. No longer enclosed by the evil atmosphere of the Faubourg St. Honoré,
  full of lying, quarrelling, incriminations and scandals, she was able to
  forget a great part of her misery, to indulge in the dreams that her present
  reconciliation with her husband might be permanent, and when he returned from
  Javiaux du Boccage they might renew amid these Norman fields the joys of
  their honeymoon, which had been spent at Locroi.</p>

  <p>Mademoiselle Debelleyme obeyed the instructions of her master and effaced
  herself; Mademoiselle Heller, who was completely under her domination, did so
  also; in the enchanting little house by the orangery Madame du Boccage had
  once more full charge of her children. It was, at first, difficult to detach
  them from their governess who was so well able to amuse them; they were all
  estranged from their mother who had always been ill, suffering, emotional,
  who had always embarrassed the candid, amiable selfishness of childhood by
  her exaction of passionate affection, by her demonstration of jealous love,
  by her impulsive hysterical temper.</p>

  <p>The Duke sent his written commands to Mademoiselle Debelleyme, emphasising
  his wish that all authority should be with the Duchess; as she had promised
  she effaced herself, and the children reluctantly resigned themselves to the
  constant companionship and tuition of their mother; but Mademoiselle
  Debelleyme was always in the background.</p>

  <p>The governess, who thus found so much leisure on her hands, enjoyed her
  stay in this lovely place.</p>

  <p>She had a fine young horse and would ride through the leafy park imagining
  herself mistress of the place, that she was returning to the Gothic chateau
  with a train of servants waiting to welcome her, that she was about to leave
  for Paris where she lived in a fashionable circle where she would soon be
  entertaining some of the royal princes, the King himself, that she was a high
  and important figure in politics who knew and led most of the notable men of
  the time. Great statesmen came to consult her judgment, great artists
  clamoured to paint her face, famous sculptors wished to model her delicate
  hand, her lovely foot, the fashionable dressmakers named materials and
  fashion; after her, the newspapers eagerly chronicled her doings. In brief
  she was, in every possible sphere of life, not only celebrated but dominant
  ... The sunlight, the magnificent blue shadow of the cedars against the pale
  azure of the sky, the perfume of the orange flowers covering the hundreds of
  dark green trees in the orangery, the murmur of the stream beneath the yellow
  droop of willows; all these were delightful accompaniment to her daydreams:
  but Lucille Debelleyme had them well in hand.</p>

  <p>At the end of the summer M. du Boccage appeared at Locroi; no
  communication for several months had passed between him and the governess but
  she was completely at ease, she believed she had exactly followed out his
  instructions, the plans that had been arranged with silent understanding
  between them and that had worked out exactly as they had both wished.</p>

  <p>The Duchess, nervous, exhausted and, despite her good intentions, her kind
  heart, tactless in all her relations with others, had made a complete failure
  of her attempt to take charge of and educate her children; an emotional
  confusion reigned in the charming little Italian house.</p>

  <p>Within a few hours of the arrival of M. du Boccage the timid, half
  apprehensive joy with which his wife had greeted him was dispersed by his
  cold reproof:</p>

  <p>"I have given you what you wished for, complete authority over the
  household, over the children, but you have proved yourself incapable. Well.
  my dear Fanny, resign yourself to relinquishing these burdens that are
  obviously too heavy for you."</p>

  <p>Stung by what seemed to her a cruel injustice and half suspecting, candid
  as she was, that she had been the victim of a plot, the impulsive Corsican
  replied angrily;</p>

  <p>"I have not been free, I have not had sole charge."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" interrupted her husband quickly, "did not then Mademoiselle
  Debelleyme do as I bid her and efface herself utterly?"</p>

  <p>"She has always been there," she replied hotly, "watching me, spying on
  me; as long as this woman remains near me... "</p>

  <p>"You blame the governesses, do you?" interrupted the Duke, with the air of
  a man who pays little attention to what is said to him because his decision
  is already taken. "I admit that they may be in the wrong. Mademoiselle Heller
  shall go. In the autumn we will have a tutor for Philippe Joseph... "</p>

  <p>"And Mademoiselle Debelleyme?"</p>

  <p>"I have no complaint against Mademoiselle Debelleyme," he answered
  steadily, "she will stay."</p>

  <p>Foreseeing one of those terrible scenes he so dreaded, to which he never
  became used, and from which he had so thankfully escaped during the last few
  months, the Duke added hastily, with a raised voice, forcing his
  authority:</p>

  <p>"Madame, I will have no dispute, no argument; I am only here to sell a few
  horses, to arrange for the transportation of the orange trees to Javiaux du
  Boccage. I intend that we shall all go there these last few days of summer
  and for some of the autumn before we start for Paris."</p>

  <p>"I refuse," stammered the Duchess in a faint voice. "If you will not part
  from this woman you must part from me."</p>

  <p>And the Duke replied quietly, "Very well, Madame, make your own decision.
  No doubt it will do you good, as I can see that your health is still poor, to
  remain here. I, the children and the governess will proceed to Javiaux du
  Boccage."</p>

  <p>Such was the meeting with her husband to which Madame du Boccage had
  looked forward with such hope through all the summer months, such was the end
  of her piteous attempt to regain her utterly lost domination over her family.
  She was more than ever isolated, more than ever miserable. The little red
  morocco diary to which she confided her desperate thoughts had more pages
  covered with a corroding, an unresigned passion, the cries of an atrocious
  suffering that even a deep religious sense could scarcely subdue.</p>

  <p>The Duke had coldly triumphed, conceived his plans carefully, put them
  into play and succeeded admirably in his intentions.</p>

  <p>One glance of satisfaction, one only passed between him and the blonde
  governess. The Duchess, whose terrible disappointment brought on an attack of
  fever, kept to her word and refused to leave Locroi.</p>

  <p>For the sake of appearances the youngest child and his nurse were left
  with her, the others went to Javiaux du Boccage on a beautiful mellow day at
  the end of September.</p>

  <p>The children, delighted to be again with their beloved father, to be once
  more under the guidance of their adored governess, filled the hour of
  departure with cries of joy, and shouts of laughter.</p>

  <p>Lucille Debelleyme on that bright morning looked back, from the wagonette,
  at the little house on the edge of the stream, at the last saffron-coloured
  roses, the trails of scarlet and amber-coloured creeper climbing round the
  slender pillars of the open balcony, with the silk curtains behind the
  shutters fluttering in the warm breeze, looked towards the green forest, the
  limpid water running at the bottom of the lawn beneath the willows. It was a
  charming scene and she found it ironic that the small house should enclose so
  much misery as Mademoiselle Debelleyme knew overwhelmed the woman who hid
  herself there.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch22"
     name="ch22">CHAPTER XXII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">But it was when she arrived at Javiaux du Boccage, which was
  far more splendid than anything she had seen before, that for the first time
  Lucille Debelleyme allowed her ambition a little rein. Nothing could be too
  large, too extravagant, too luxurious for her taste, and this huge palace set
  in a colossal park, greatly increased in her estimation the master of such
  magnificence, increased also her joy and pride in his friendship, and his
  championship&mdash;dangerously increased her hopes.</p>

  <p>This sumptuous chateau, which Lucille Debelleyme surveyed with
  enthusiastic approval, had been built, in a mood of reckless splendour too
  grandiose to last, from the combined spoils of a successful soldier and a
  successful statesman.</p>

  <p>The mighty building with an immense facade of white stone rose from the
  sloping banks of a small river; the governess learnt with delight that half a
  dozen villages had been razed to the ground to form the park, that it had
  cost five or six millions to build Javiaux du Boccage, and had occupied, for
  several decades, thousands of workmen. Nothing lacked of that impression of
  reckless luxury that was the stamp of that glorious world which had endured
  so briefly and vanished so completely&mdash;the age of Louis XIV.</p>

  <p>The forecourt and the court of honour separated the Castle from the park,
  colossal sculptures adorned the wide terraces and supported the huge pillars
  crowned by trophies that guarded the gates, iron wrought to the delicacy of
  leaves.</p>

  <p>There were at least five hundred rooms, some painted by Le Brun, by
  Mignard, adorned by tapestry from designs by Boucer, the youth of Bacchus,
  the Chariots of the Sun, battles of Titans&mdash;Javiaux du Boccage had been
  built on a scale that could only have been continued by a succession of
  fortunate millionaires.</p>

  <p>The first splendour was dimmed, in part effaced; it had been through the
  Revolution of 1789, it had been neglected by the old miser who was the father
  of the present Duke, The chapel, the guard house, the terraces, the gardens,
  the fountains, the grottos, the canals, the state apartments were all in
  urgent need of restoration.</p>

  <p>When Mademoiselle Debelleyme saw the hundreds of workmen employed in this
  labour, when she saw the architects, the painters and the sculptors who M. du
  Boccage had lavishly engaged in the task of reviving the glories of this
  incredible chateau, she understood the vital need he had of all his wife's
  millions.</p>

  <p>It was the miserable woman abandoned in Normandy to the torments of her
  devouring jealousy who owned all the money her husband was lavishly spending
  on his beloved heritage. Mademoiselle Debelleyme sympathised profoundly with
  his situation, deeply admired the skill with which he was extricating himself
  from an intolerable position, gradually separating himself, his children,
  completely from his wife, yet avoiding all scandal, all open complaint, all
  the inconveniences of a legal separation, while still maintaining full
  control of her huge and necessary fortune.</p>

  <p>In this superb place, walking through the great rooms, along the enormous
  terraces, the governess, though so cautious, though so sure of herself,
  though, till now, with her emotions her aspirations well in hand, allowed
  herself to look steadily into the future, to consider her situation coolly,
  or, as she believed, coolly. But in truth the fact that she was alone with M
  du Boccage in this intoxicating environment had gone a little to her head;
  what might she not make of a destiny which seemed so suddenly, so
  unexpectedly brilliant? This man, who never uttered a word of a love to her,
  who treated her alway with respect, who saw her for the most part in company
  with his children, yet who continued to seek her out every day, more and more
  frequently&mdash;what might now be made of him?</p>

  <p>Freed from the restraint imposed by the presence of his wife, he consulted
  the governess on every point. Her judgment, her taste, her enthusiasm were
  frequently called upon to decide this and that in the restoration of Javiaux
  du Boccage... however prudent she might be, however cold-blooded, she could
  not but begin to feel that she was necessary to this man, that she was
  acquiring over him a subtle but powerful domination.</p>

  <p>If he did not love her now, he might come to do so. She recalled Madame de
  Maintenon, Madame de Genlis, women who had maintained a perfect decorum in
  positions like her own, yet contrived to oust the mistress or the wife in
  possession, to completely obsess with their intelligence, their
  personalities, the men who had at first employed them as humble
  dependents.</p>

  <p>Mostly the governess dwelt on the case of Madame de Genlis; a model
  governess, a paragon of virtue, intelligent, with liberal ideas, who had
  entered unobtrusively into the establishment of Monsieur D'Orleans, the
  father of the present king, and before very long had, still under the cloak
  of complete respectability, utterly eclipsed his wife until she was a
  melancholy stranger in her own house, and had absorbed father and children
  alike. Had she been his mistress, or merely his platonic friend, his Egeria?
  No one knew to this day, she had been so clever. Scandal had raged, of
  course, but had not dared to rear its head against the implacable armour of
  her propriety, and she had reigned supreme. It was Madame D'Orleans who had
  crept away, abandoned, robbed of children as well as husband, to die of a
  broken heart in solitude, and now Lucille Debelleyme ventured to speculate:
  "Perhaps I can do that, perhaps I could play that part. I am dealing with a
  woman who plays into my hands, by her inexperience, by her folly, by her ill
  health, by her very virtues. My God! how he winced to see the paupers ruining
  his lovely grounds at Locroi, how he turned aside when he saw the priest in
  the anteroom! She is so stupid she does not even know how to hide the virtues
  that irritate him, she has lost him... lost him, and why should I not catch
  his heart on the rebound? I believe we understand each other very well, that
  he as well as I would see that all was done with perfect decorum; there would
  be no scandal, he would not have to affront her father, to give up her
  fortune, leave his place at Court, to face a Separation from the children he
  adored. Can I do it?"</p>

  <p>She believed she could; though of course some risk must attend any
  enterprise so ambitious.</p>

  <p>But nine months of power had given Mademoiselle Debelleyme a good deal of
  self-assurance, her native audacity came to the surface. She resolved to
  strain every nerve in a tenacious battle with the Duchess, in an attempt to
  make permanent a strange ascendancy she did not quite understand herself (she
  could not tell for all her skill if the man really loved her in any sense of
  the word) over M. du Boccage.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch23"
     name="ch23">CHAPTER XXIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">From the peace of her retreat in Normandy, Madame du Boccage
  wrote to her husband, absorbed in the grandeur of Javiaux du Boccage, and the
  governess found opportunities to read some of these pathetic letters.</p>

  <p>Left to herself, some resignation had fallen on the tormented spirit of
  the neglected wife and she wrote tenderly, entreating her husband for a small
  return of his love and confidence, promising with almost servile humility
  complete obedience if he would only smile on her again...</p>

  <p>She reminded him that she had never cared for the way of life that
  belonged naturally to her position in society and her vast wealth. All she
  had wanted was happiness in her own home, among her beloved children.</p>

  <p>In one letter that the governess' cruel eyes had spied upon the wife had
  written: "Into this marriage I have put everything, all my hopes of any
  happiness."</p>

  <p>"Lay all your eggs in one basket and you will break them," was the mental
  comment of the governess.</p>

  <p>A few days before the proposed departure for Paris (the winter was drawing
  in) Madame du Boccage arrived suddenly at the Chateau Javiaux du Boccage,
  although her husband had tried to dissuade her when she had first hinted at
  her intention, saying that it was foolish in her state of health to take such
  a long and tiresome journey.</p>

  <p>But full of good resolutions and not despairing even now of complete
  reconciliation with her husband, the impetuous Corsican arrived close behind
  the message announcing her arrival.</p>

  <p>The carriage drew up before the vast steps on which stood her husband and
  behind him the governess, holding by the hand little Isabelle. It looked like
  a family group by Winterhalter; man, woman and child, elegant, precise, stood
  against the great expanse of marble in the clear, cold, early winter
  sunshine; there even seemed to be a resemblance between them, for the pretty
  girl was blonde like her father. It was the dark, heavy woman descending from
  the carriage who appeared to be the alien; she recognised this with a sense
  of fearful desolation, it was she who was the intruder, it was she who was
  not wanted. Her husband's face was overcast, the greeting of the governess
  icy and that of the child distracted. She, this tiresome hysterical invalid,
  had come to spoil their fun.</p>

  <p>She realised this so keenly that she was unable to put into practice her
  good resolutions, she became at once peevish, reproachful, and for the first
  time since she had handed her fortune over to her husband's care, she, so
  indifferent about money, found occasion to reproach him for the lavish sum he
  was spending on a useless monument of wanton splendour such as Javiaux du
  Boccage.</p>

  <p>There followed one of those violent quarrels which had taken place
  frequently enough in the <i>rez de chaussée</i> in the Faubourg St. Honoré
  but always behind closed doors, with lowered voices; but here the Duke,
  exasperated by this intolerable interference in his labours, broke openly
  into one of his rare but frightful rages.</p>

  <p>He snatched his wife's blue silk parasol from the chair where she had
  thrown it and snapped the ivory handle in his powerful hands to prevent
  himself from touching her, and when she, with bitter dignity, reproached him
  for his appalling ill manners he was goaded into further violence and smashed
  a gleaming Sevres vase which stood on a stand of onyx.</p>

  <p>Madame du Boccage became really alarmed herself; she knew she could have
  avoided provoking her husband's rages if she had sufficient self-command, and
  this fury came with devastating effect from a man usually amiable, sweet,
  even indolent in his manner.</p>

  <p>She ran from the room uncaring as to who might see her and in the barren,
  hateful splendour of the large salon, darkened by heavy statues, gods and
  goddesses sprawling from the blue foliage of tapestries, she gave vent to an
  excess of despair, all the more bitter as it followed on her hopes of a few
  hours ago.</p>

  <p>A plasterers, knife had been left on the window sill by one of the men who
  was restoring the elaborate stucco round the deep frames. The frantic woman
  snatched this up with a melodramatic gesture so detestable to her husband,
  who had followed her and saw with profound disgust her intention. The scene
  was made worse for him by her ludicrous likeness, in her heavy clothes, in
  her frantic, yet majestic despair, to some blousy, tragedy queen of the
  Theatre Français in the bloody climax of the last act. As he pulled the knife
  from her, defeating her easily with the least exertion of his enormous
  strength, he hated her for the worst of her sins, that of making them both
  ridiculous.</p>

  <p>She fell back, crying hysterically, and Matilde, the busy spy, came
  running in. This heightened his fury, his humiliation, he was scarcely able
  to restrain himself. He saw that in the struggle to gain possession of the
  knife he had cut himself; he stared at the blood dripping down his pale
  waistcoat and tight light trousers.</p>

  <p>Breathing hard, M. du Boccage went to the large room on the ground floor
  which he had given as a salon to Mademoiselle Debelleyme. Stammering, he told
  her the story of that gash in his palm and, while, without comment, she
  fetched her liniment and her bandages, he stared with horror at the red
  wound. As she tended him, she thought that never had she got so far into his
  confidence, never had he revealed to her so plainly his miserable relations
  with his wife. She knew that the cut was nothing; it was not for comfort for
  a scratch on his hand that he had come to her but for consolation in those
  wounds to his pride, his dignity, his self-esteem.</p>

  <p>He sat down shuddering and placed his hand on the table; she bent over it
  and gently wound round and across it long strips of soft lint. She recalled
  when she had seen that hand, in its velvet cuff, and sapphire stud, resting
  on the edge of the box at the Opera. For a while he did not speak; a man ill
  able to express himself, he was usually silent in moments of strong emotion
  but at length he brought out:</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle, you have understood how I am situated?"</p>

  <p>She raised her head from her bandaging, paused in the quick movement of
  her fine fingers and looked directly into his eyes. She had never seen them
  so wide open nor understood so well their expression.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Monsieur."</p>

  <p>"What is your impression of my life?" he asked as if he would rather that
  she and not he might put what was between them into words.</p>

  <p>"You live in an inferno."</p>

  <p>"It is quite true! There is no one to help me, no one to understand. She
  is considered a saint, a martyr and I have to put up with it. Is it my fault
  that I married when I was a child and knew nothing? Is it my fault that I
  have changed from loving her, admiring her? That I have come to regard her
  with hatred?"</p>

  <p>Lucille Debelleyme drank in eagerly these harsh words which were vibrant
  with a passion so long repressed; she knew that she was his first confidante.
  To whom indeed could he speak in these terms of his innocent, his admired
  wife? The governess understood his point of view, it was not only
  self-interest that made her his champion.</p>

  <p>"She will not let me go," whispered the Duke as if he spoke to himself;
  his free hand beat lightly on the table, "she will not let go! She clings and
  clings and I wake in the night and feel her clinging when I am alone. She is
  like a vampire that bites into one's very entrails. I have read of such
  beasts. Mon Dieu, I do not know what I may be driven to if she will not let
  me go! Her cries, her reproaches, her scenes, her priest, her maids! She even
  sets her porters to follow me and pays beggars to report my movements to her.
  Yet to all the world she is a model wife and mother, a pure, virtuous woman.
  To hell with all such virtue, I say! I would sooner have married a harlot
  than this exacting piety, this jealous lunatic goodness that will not let me
  go."</p>

  <p>He had spoken the truth, words he could never retract nor she ever
  forget.</p>

  <p>Lucille Debelleyme listened with joy mingled with fear, to this terrible
  confession wrenched from the man before her. Gone was his usual gaiety, his
  suave amiability and correct manners; she noted the drops of sweat on his
  forehead, the way he beat his hand again and again on the table. He went on
  breathlessly:</p>

  <p>"You have heard much of her sufferings, I suppose&mdash;have you ever
  thought of mine, what this life means to me? I will not give way&mdash;I have
  been considered weak, but I will not give way. I will neither become her
  lover nor her slave. I will not lose my children, the money, my position,
  make myself a laughing stock. She would have all the sympathy&mdash;I will
  not listen to the reproaches of her father... " He checked himself with a
  terrible effort, pulled his handkerchief from his waistcoat and wiped his
  trembling lips.</p>

  <p>"Go on, Monsieur," said Lucille lightly holding his bandaged hand in hers.
  "You do not say a word of what I have not already suspected."</p>

  <p>"So I guessed, a woman of your intelligence would have understood from the
  first. But I never said anything, did I? I should not be telling you all this
  now."</p>

  <p>"We are past such conventions."</p>

  <p>His bandaged hand turned over on the table and clasped her fingers.</p>

  <p>"You will stand by me, you will help me? Without you I cannot do it."</p>

  <p>"Help you? How?"</p>

  <p>"It must be done by subterfuge, one must keep one's patience, one's
  temper, one must wear down this intolerable opposition, one must force her to
  let go."</p>

  <p>He was silent, overpowered by an excess of emotion.</p>

  <p>"That is the only way," breathed Lucille, bending close to him, "to be
  wary, to be careful, to feel one's way. Monsieur, if you could only bring
  yourself to be a little kind to her, even perhaps to give her all she
  asks."</p>

  <p>"I cannot." The truth seemed drawn from him against his own volition and
  hung on the air between them. "It is a physical repugnance, the last time I
  slept with her, the scent of her hair on the pillows... " He turned away.</p>

  <p>Lucille Debelleyme remembered the handsome bed with the Brussels lace
  curtains amidst the amorini upholding the huge baldaquin. She was filled,
  vicariously, with distaste for Madame du Boccage, ill, half-dazed with opium,
  thickened by continuous child-bearing; how well she could understand his
  repugnance, born of personal, physical aversion. No doubt he had recoiled
  from the bed and the woman who clamoured so piteously for his love, with the
  same violence as she had flung away from Robert Morrison. That to her was
  unforgivable, this attempt to force the relationship of the body as the soul
  sprang back in disgust.</p>

  <p>"I know you cannot do it; whatever you decide I am your ally and will help
  you."</p>

  <p>He had so little command of himself that as he wiped the sweat from his
  forehead he confessed:</p>

  <p>"I should not have spoken to you. I should not have involved you in this.
  I was overcome, I came to speak to you because I was afraid I might strike
  her."</p>

  <p>"If you had I could have condoned it. To me. Monsieur, there are worse
  things than a blow."</p>

  <p>To me also. Sometimes I think I do not belong to this period, to this
  century. Sometimes, Mademoiselle Debelleyme, when I escape to these houses,
  parks that belonged to my ancestors, I think of the days when no man allowed
  himself to be so hellishly dominated by a woman, when one got free even at
  the cost of what they would call now crime. Many a man has killed his wife
  for adultery and been thought none the worse for it because he was saving his
  honour... his honour! There are worse things than adultery."</p>

  <p>"I also think so."</p>

  <p>His breast was heaving as he stared at her straightly and demanded:</p>

  <p>"You do not think the worse of me for this&mdash;because I cannot love my
  wife? You perhaps understand? That you, of all people, capable of
  understanding, should have come my way when in the eyes of almost everyone I
  appear a heartless, a mean brute!"</p>

  <p>"Not to me, Monsieur. I understand, I&mdash;sympathise."</p>

  <p>She walked round and round the table, approached where he sat and
  retreated from him again. Through the tall uncurtained window of the half
  unfurnished room a shaft of gold from the western sun fell into this
  apartment, at once bleak and sumptuous.</p>

  <p>"I understand Madame du Boccage also," she added; she too allowed her
  emotions a little range, forgot her old conventional manners, her traditional
  humility. "I can understand what it might be to love, and hopelessly, some
  man, a man like yourself, Monsieur Le Duc. Oh! I am fastidious and squeamish,
  I could be devoted and loyal and passionate, but I should not make these
  scenes; I have the strength to control myself."</p>

  <p>He rose and held on the back of the chair with his sound hand in an
  attitude like the one in which she had first seen him in the Faubourg St.
  Honoré, and stared at her, and these two, neither of whom believed in God,
  neither of whom felt the lack of that belief, both hedonist, epicurean and
  passionate, looked at each other with increasing excitement.</p>

  <p>"You know what is said of us?" he asked abruptly. "You are aware how we
  are slandered?"</p>

  <p>"As well aware. Monsieur, as I am aware that there is no foundation for
  that slander." She spoke with the force of her real pride, rejoicing almost
  savagely in the consciousness of her immaculate, technical innocence.</p>

  <p>"You are prepared to endure this, Mademoiselle, for my sake? I will in
  every possible way protect you, but there is much I cannot do, there is a
  great deal I cannot save you from."</p>

  <p>"I do not care, I have nothing to lose. Your friendship has been the only
  thing I have had that has been worth anything, that and the affection of your
  children, the protection of your household."</p>

  <p>"My mother told me you had once been deceived in a man. I from the first
  knew the kind of a woman you are. I have not... I would not... " he
  hesitated, struggling with his words, phrases did not come readily to his
  lips even at a moment of emotion, "I would not insult you. Mademoiselle, by
  taking a vulgar advantage of your position, but nevertheless you mean a great
  deal to me... "</p>

  <p>"I will do whatever you wish. No matter what occurs I will not leave you
  till you tell me to."</p>

  <p>Then, with a sudden excess of feeling which she could not control, she
  flung herself on her knees on the marble floor beside him, took the hand that
  hung by his side and pressed her lips to it.</p>

  <p>"All I have is yours," she whispered, "my gratitude, my devotion, my
  loyalty!"</p>

  <p>She rose and was gone, and he, who had been so outraged by the
  melodramatic passion of his wife, found this display gracious, touching and
  infinitely soothing to his stung pride.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch24"
     name="ch24">CHAPTER XXIV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Custom reasserted itself, and every day life dropped into it
  usual routine, but now between Madame du Boccage and the governess it was
  open warfare, waged with that tenacity which only those whose passion is
  fully roused have the strength to maintain. Not one spark of pity did Lucille
  Debelleyme feel for the woman whom she now regarded as a rival. Did she not
  employ her servant to spy upon her husband?&mdash;did she not listen eagerly
  to tales that anyone brought to her of him? And what if not rejected love was
  the root of all her miseries and anguish?</p>

  <p>Lucille Debelleyme did not put a very high value on that passion; she knew
  the world would call it a pure wifely affection, a mere insistence on sacred
  vows taken before God; but, looked at clearly, what was it? A physical desire
  for a man whose character she could not admire if she was the virtuous woman
  she pretended to be, a man whose actions she must, as a good mother, despise,
  a man she should, if she were sincere in her pious protestations, condemn as
  an atheist, a libertine, a heartless rake.</p>

  <p>Lucille Debelleyme thought she could read Fanny du Boccage well enough,
  her physical desires tormented her, it was impossible for her to live in
  peace near her husband and not have him as her lover. If he would once more
  share the bed beneath the mighty baldaquin he might indulge in any
  improprieties, any frivolities, and continue his reckless expense on Javiaux
  du Boccage with no word of reproach from his satisfied wife.</p>

  <p>"She is no better than I," thought the governess with contempt, "she has
  not been able to make anyone, except toadies and spies and beggars and
  priests love her, and even the children have turned to me; she is in my way
  and she must go, even if it means destroying her utterly."</p>

  <p>The Du Boccage household returned to the Faubourg St. Honoré and life in
  the elegant mansion pursued, on the surface, its usual course throughout the
  gaieties of a Parisian winter.</p>

  <p>M. du Boccage did not renew his confidences with the governess; when they
  met again after that interview at Javiaux du Boccage he had resumed his usual
  manner and she was mistress of hers, all was understood and there was no need
  for further words.</p>

  <p>The Duchess appeared vanquished, her long illness kept her in her
  apartments, the installation of nurses, the visits of doctors helped to pass
  over the winter with some outward decorum; and also allowed ample leisure for
  the governess and M. du Boccage to pursue their companionship, their
  friendship, the indulgence of their common tastes.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch25"
     name="ch25">CHAPTER XXV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">That was a memorable season for Lucille Debelleyme, she felt
  herself in the forefront of those great events she had often regarded
  longingly from afar. She took a lively interest in all that was happening
  around her, herself a product of a new century she felt at one with all the
  manifestations of progress, She enjoyed it all, from the grand review at the
  Champs de Mars in honour of the Envoy of the Emperor of Morocco, to the
  ceremonious openings of two new railway stations, that from Paris to Tours
  and that ambitious line to the North. She was present at the marvellous
  experiment of the invention of M. Le Docteur Payerne when a submarine was
  sent under the Seine where it remained with its crew for two hours, she
  watched the Viceroy of Egypt's arrival at the Palais Élysée, heard from M. du
  Boccage an account of the brilliant reception given by Madame de Recamier in
  honour of Chateaubriand, she attended with the children the fete in the
  Champs Élysées given for the benefit of the Spanish refugees, she took the
  eldest boy, the Marquis Philippe Joseph, to see the great steeplechase at
  Croix de Berny, she was present at the fashionable parade at the Madeleine
  when the monstrous new organ by Cavaille was inaugurated, she listened with
  malice to the accounts of two attempts against the life of the King, one at
  Fontainebleau, one at the Tuileries, she watched the Due de Nemours,
  reviewing his troops and she read in the journals of the elaborate
  preparations for the marriage of the Due de Montpensier with a princess of
  Spain.</p>

  <p>She was present in the Opera-Comique when Berlioz gave the first
  performance of La Damnation de Faust; she listened keenly to all the talk,
  the whispers of the salon, the hints in the press (that new power becoming
  every month more formidable), sometimes she even caught a word or a phrase in
  the streets which proved to her that the present dynasty was not so firm as
  it might seem, nor the King and his numerous family as beloved as they might
  appear, and the governess, like a butterfly flitting ahead of flames that
  could not overtake her, nor even scorch her wings, trembled with anticipation
  at the thought of yet another Revolution.</p>

  <p>She knew herself on the edge of an abyss but she knew herself also at the
  bottom of a cliff, an uneasy position, she might either climb or
  fall&mdash;but she was happy.</p>

  <p>She believed that she was making M. du Boccage happy also.</p>

  <p>By patient dissimulation, by laborious subterfuge he had almost entirely
  disentangled himself from his wife. His leisure, his companionship, his
  interests were more and more for the children and the governess, he went less
  frequently to Court, joined more seldom those amusements which formerly he
  had found so delightful, as if there was no keener pleasure for him than to
  be entertained by Lucille Debelleyme on the first floor of his mansion in the
  Faubourg St. Honoré.</p>

  <p>They based their mutual security on the pride and reserve of Madame du
  Boccage. Scandal might murmur, bitter remarks might be dropped, hostile
  glances given, but as long as the wife did not complain no one else could do
  so.</p>

  <p>Yet Lucille Debelleyme knew that this provoking and piquant situation
  could not last, there must be a climax and she hardly dared to speculate as
  to what that might be.</p>

  <p>She felt secure as far as M. du Boccage's wife was concerned, but she did
  not feel so secure in regard to his possible passion for herself. It was true
  that they appeared to understand each other perfectly; after his outburst at
  Javiaux du Boccage when she had dressed his wounded hand (an incident to
  which he never referred) she was certain she possessed his entire confidence,
  but what would he risk for her sake if the Duchess was driven to make open
  complaint, if she should call in her father, her family?</p>

  <p>Would M. du Boccage sacrifice everything or anything for the sake of
  Lucille Debelleyme?</p>

  <p>He came upon her one day when she was sewing; her thimble dropped off and
  he picked it up, remarking on the bright design of forget-me-nots, so
  gracefully entwined on the silver.</p>

  <p>"It was given to me by someone whom I shall certainly never forget."</p>

  <p>"A lover, Mademoiselle?"</p>

  <p>"I have never had a lover, but&mdash;a man who might have been one had I
  been fortunate."</p>

  <p>Turning the tiny thimble round thoughtfully on his palm the Duke
  asked:</p>

  <p>"Have you never thought of marrying. Mademoiselle?"</p>

  <p>Dropping her hands in her lap she studied the pale wreath on the Aubusson
  carpet.</p>

  <p>"While I can be of any service in your establishment I should never think
  of marrying, but if something should occur so that I have to leave... "</p>

  <p>"Why should anything occur to cause such an unhappy event?"</p>

  <p>"One never knows. Monsieur, but I was saying I think I should not have the
  heart to seek another place. I believe if I had to leave you, I should
  marry."</p>

  <p>"You have, then, someone in mind?" and the sharp jealousy in his tone
  caused her instantly to invent a suitor.</p>

  <p>"There is a man who has long wanted to marry me, a retired officer in a
  good position. I have refused him many times but he continues to pursue me,
  and one day, friendless, unprotected as I am&mdash;" she ventured to look at
  him, there was no mistaking the expression on his face.</p>

  <p>"You do not care for this tiresome fellow?"</p>

  <p>"I might be forced to marry someone for whom I did not care."</p>

  <p>The Duke picked up one of his daughter's pencil sketches of rabbits and
  carrots and tore it across, murmuring that it was poor and childish, then
  returning to the subject that really interested him he exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"Do you often see this man?"</p>

  <p>"Never, Monsieur," replied the governess turning on him bright candid
  eyes. "He is not in Paris. Sometimes he writes to me."</p>

  <p>"You must never marry," whispered the Duke, looking away, "at least not a
  man you do not respect."</p>

  <p>She noticed he was careful to avoid the use of the word love, but she
  rejected the word he did use.</p>

  <p>"Respect," she exclaimed contemptuously, "surely that is the last thing
  necessary in marriage!"</p>

  <p>"What, then, would you have?" he asked quickly.</p>

  <p>"You know," she smiled, "passion and understanding."</p>

  <p>She took the thimble wreathed with forget-me-nots and replaced it again on
  her small finger.</p>

  <p>"For the moment I need not think of this marriage, I did not mean to tell
  you, it is only my last refuge."</p>

  <p>"While I live there is surely no need for you to think of it."</p>

  <p>Very indifferently the governess remarked:</p>

  <p>"You perhaps forget that I am only a dependant in this establishment, that
  I am not honoured with the confidence of Madame... "</p>

  <p>He bit his lip, turned away, then left her impulsively; she thoughtfully
  continued her sewing and wondered whether she had done right or wrong to
  invent this pressing suitor. It was amusing, it was delicious to provoke the
  jealousy of M. du Boccage, was it not also perhaps risky?</p>

  <p>But the governess was used to taking risks.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch26"
     name="ch26">CHAPTER XXVI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Now and then during that winter and spring the governess
  ventured to creep to the little private apartment of the Duke, pull open the
  drawer in the pale-green painted desk and read the letters which were now too
  numerous to be contained in the vellum portfolio and were flung carelessly
  loose.</p>

  <p>She never dared to stay longer than gave her time to read a few lines, but
  these were sufficient to prove to her that the relations between husband and
  wife were even worse than they had been, and that the Duchess, with the
  recklessness of a woman who has lost all hope, was still battling vainly to
  be rid of herself&mdash;the governess.</p>

  <p>Some sentences stirred the curiosity of Lucille Debelleyme. Madame du
  Boccage vehemently reproached her husband, in several of these distracted
  letters, with the little apartments in houses she was told he had hired in
  various parts of the city, "and do not try to persuade me that they are for
  yourself alone."</p>

  <p>She reproved him for going out late at night and hiring public vehicles
  when he had so many carriages of his own at his disposal. "Do not tell me
  that it is for the club, for the Court, or to see your mother or sisters that
  you leave me," she wrote, "for it has occurred when the Court is at the
  Chateau D'Eu, when your family are not in Paris."</p>

  <p>"How minutely she must spy on him," thought the governess, "to find out
  all his movements like that! What an incredible fool she is to flaunt her
  knowledge in his face!"</p>

  <p>Then Lucille Debelleyme herself began to wonder as to where M. du Boccage
  spent the time he did not devote to her and the children.</p>

  <p>He came to see her almost every evening, it was true, but always left at a
  respectable hour, usually soon after the children were in bed; that he did
  not go to his wife was abundantly clear and, rather to her own dismay, the
  governess, who thought she had herself so well in hand, began to know
  something of the prickings of jealousy with which she had so coldly tormented
  the other woman; whom did M. du Boccage meet at the secret rooms which his
  wife had discovered he hired?</p>

  <p>Other women, of course; he had not lived like a monk, a man of that
  physique, for six years. She knew about these things but she did not greatly
  care to have them brought home to her and she was rather alarmed by the
  distaste with which she considered even the casual mistresses of M. du
  Boccage.</p>

  <p>Was she about to fall in love with him herself or rather was she going to
  allow him to assert a sway over her senses? That would be intolerable, that
  would spoil everything. If she could not keep her head in that direction she
  was surely lost, unless she thought again of Madame de Genlis and Madame de
  Maintenon.</p>

  <p>How much had they loved the men on whose backs they had climbed to power?
  The governess boldly asked herself: "Could I become his mistress, keep my
  position here, look after his children, defy his wife? I believe it would be
  very difficult, I believe if we became lost in passion it would be
  impossible."</p>

  <p>She could not put those other unknown women out of her mind, she was
  tortured with the thought that one of them might suddenly retain a hold on
  him, satisfy more than a transient need.</p>

  <p>She was tempted to make some advances to him, yet hesitated. She knew he
  regarded her as immaculate, was not that her chief hold on him? He respected
  her, admired her honour, her dignity and her purity, he had heard the story
  she had told his mother solely in order that it might reach his ears. But
  every time he came to see her she found his visit more pleasant, his presence
  more alluring, his contact more dangerous, the glances veiled by the thick
  fair lashes more seductive, and the slightly hesitating voice in which he
  conversed with her more enchanting.</p>

  <p>Everything about him, his costly clothes, his fine perfume, even that
  thick blond hair that at first she found so repulsive because it reminded her
  of Robert Morrison, the powerful hands which were almost vulgarly strong,
  everything attracted her, and excited her keen senses.</p>

  <p>When with locked door, with drawn curtains, in the rosy light of the
  opal-shaded lamp, she stood in a thin robe of lace or silk, which would go on
  the account of Madame du Boccage, and looked at herself in the mirror, pride
  in her pale luminous beauty was not so impersonal as it had been. She began
  to wish that M. du Boccage could see her like this, she began to regret that
  she had taken such care to impress him with her purity.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch27"
     name="ch27">CHAPTER XXVII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The governess, watching on the stairs or visiting with the
  children in the neighbourhood, saw many of the society figures who were
  received in the Faubourg St. Honoré: Victor Hugo, the renowned novelist,
  recently elected a member of the Chamber of Peers, General Cubières and
  President Teste who were presently to be involved in those appalling charges
  of corruption which would shake France, and she noted on several occasions a
  grim and sinister figure which impressed her unpleasantly, that of the old
  Due Pasquier, Chancellor of he Chamber of Peers, cold and cruel, bowed with
  age, nearly blind with cataract, but possessed of a formidable presence
  before which even Lucille Debelleyme quailed. He was believed to have no
  interest in life beyond the prestige of the peerage of France, his face was
  rigid with all the <i>hauteur</i> of those ancient nobles who had mounted the
  bloody steps of the guillotine.</p>

  <p>Mademoiselle Debelleyme hated the Due Pasquier and wondered why this
  aversion was like a presentiment of ill fortune. An aura of evil, she
  thought, surrounded the old man, with his eyes ringed by white circles, his
  thick grey whiskers, his shaking hands, his implacable strength.</p>

  <p>The propriety of the Faubourg St. Honoré could not satisfy her avid
  curiosity; there was so much she did not know, there was a great deal she had
  never experienced and she was haunted by the lines of the Duchess' letter
  about the secret rendezvous to which her husband went so frequently.</p>

  <p>Where did he go? What did he do? What kind of women did he meet? How did
  he entertain them? What gifts did he give them? In brief, what life was this
  that flowed beneath he even existence? What glitter, what darkness which she
  might never hope to know?</p>

  <p>On some of the light spring evenings of the first mild days the governess,
  when the children were in bed (when he left he early) crept out of the house
  wearing her simplest clothes, the thick, ugly dresses that had been so
  approved of in Belgrave Square, and, pulling a veil over her dark bonnet,
  hired a cab and drove to any chance address, any street that came into her
  mind, an old church on the island of the city, an ancient house she had heard
  of in Quartier St. Antoine. She would often drive over the Pont Neuf where
  stood the last remaining shop like a temple with a black gateway, but mostly
  she went to the poorer quarters where she could not possibly go in the
  daytime with her charges, and gazed from the window of her carriage at this
  other Paris of which she knew so little.</p>

  <p>She noticed the public writer, with his soft hat and long torn coat,
  shivering before his table in the open air of the Rue St Jacques; she watched
  the charlatan in tartan trousers selling bankrupt stock in the Rue St. Denis,
  and she drove once, on an evening when her spirit seemed restless, to the
  prison of the Quartier Popincourt and looked, with she know not what kind of
  interest, at those sombre walls, pierced by tiny windows.</p>

  <p>Several times she dismissed her cab at the corner of a street where a
  flickering gas-lamp gleamed down some dark alley, and started out, light
  footed, apprehensive yet audacious, her clear cold eyes beneath the cotton
  veil scanning the shabby house on which were stuck placards "lodgings for the
  night," glancing down the open doors in the cellars where drunken men
  quarrrelled, listening, as she hastened past, to the muttered conversations
  of men, huddled together with their hands in their pockets, their caps over
  their eyes, in broken doorways. She watched the rag-sellers, the sick
  children sucking dirty crusts, the sore-eyed cats in the gutter, smelt the
  reek of foul cooking that came from these obscure windows and blackened
  doors. She watched the hawkers trying to sell their nostrums, their elixirs
  for happiness; she listened to the wail of violins and mandolins outside
  drinking houses, she saw the homeless prostitutes, many of them no more than
  children. Without bonnets, without shawls, with clothes torn over breasts not
  yet fully grown, stumbling down the gutters, the refuse round their skirts,
  their faces flushed and haggard, their eyes confused, their breath heavy with
  alcohol.</p>

  <p>Satisfying she scarcely knew what avid need, the governess, from behind
  her veil, drank in all these scenes, stamping them on her memory. This also
  was life, as real a life as sparkled at the Cafe de Paris in the elegant
  apartment Demidoff where the next morning she would pause in her ride with
  the children and sit for a moment or so at the tables under the elegant trees
  in the Boulevard des Italiens; yes, this was life and she might easily have
  been a part of it. It was mere chance that she was not one of those
  bedraggled women dying of vice and consumption.</p>

  <p>It excited her, the ugliness, the filth, the suffering, the confused
  medley that poverty, disease and crime made of life. Her cool fastidiousness
  regarded without wincing the drunkard vomiting outside the cabaret, the
  half-naked child, covered with ulcers, searching for rotting fruit among the
  garbage pails, the hag stumbling into the disreputable pharmacy which
  administered to the victims of vice, to buy rouge with which to daub the
  cheeks of the consumptive street-walker.</p>

  <p>She listened to the shrieks of women in child-birth coming from behind the
  rags that blocked the windows of tenements, she heard the oaths of the police
  as they struggled with thief or suspect, she heard the tired voice of some
  priest praying above a death-bed, she heard a man in a grocer's shop beg a
  biscuit box for his child's coffin, and the thin song of a demented woman
  pacing before the great gates of a vast burial ground.</p>

  <p>She saw the exhausted beasts being driven by the blows of sticks into the
  slaughter house and the trails of blood that flowed sluggishly over the
  cobbles, she saw a pigeon fluttering alive on a butcher's stall and a sewer
  rat devouring the entrails of a decaying dog.</p>

  <p>Once her light, hovering step brought her to the Seine, the dark bulk of
  the Hotel-Dieu, the squat edifice of the Morgue. The few gas-lamps on the
  quays were dully reflected in the sluggish river where long, dark barges
  rocked at their chains.</p>

  <p>The governess did not dare enter the building where the unknown dead drawn
  from the filthy water lay corrupting on their marble pillows, but, as she
  hesitated, staring, fascinated by this ultimate horror, a dark procession
  formed out of the river mists about her. Some men in uniform, were carrying a
  dripping body, half covered by a sack on which was stamped the name of a
  sweetmeat manufacturer; the lolling head was exposed, the face was that of a
  young boy, the outline gentle and refined, the expression one of insane
  despair.</p>

  <p>As the governess stared at this group which turned towards the Morgue, an
  old woman lurched up out of the fog and thrust a bunch of dead roses under
  her nostrils; so, thought Lucille Debelleyme, that drowned child might stink
  in the nostrils of his Creator. She paid a few sous to the shivering woman
  and when she had gone, dropped the dusty roses, that seemed rotten with
  tears, into the river.</p>

  <p>As soon as these nocturnal expeditions began to be observed and her
  excuses of paying a visit to the poor, to a relative, would no longer serve,
  she gave up what had become a dangerous diversion, but she had seen enough,
  she had satisfied a restless, brutal curiosity.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch28"
     name="ch28">CHAPTER XXVIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The King walked up and down one of the galleries of the
  Tuileries, a bundle of newspapers under his arm; disease had thickened his
  once graceful figure to a stoutness that was daily turned to ridicule by the
  venom of the caricaturists. In the not undignified person of Louis Philippe,
  the careful benevolence of the professional democrat was tempered by
  hereditary pride, indolence and obstinacy; as, affecting to found his
  monarchy on the love of his people, he had never dared to use force, he had
  been obliged to support his power by strategy and all the ramifications of
  political corruption. Never had a Bourbon lived through so many vicissitudes
  nor a King of France been through so many sordid experiences.</p>

  <p>His civilian dress, ostentatiously devoid of any touch of grandeur, his
  air of easy, unceremonious good humour, showed the citizen King appealing for
  the sufferance of his dear countrymen, but he remained a royal Prince,
  surrounded by an aristocracy modelled, as far as he dare, on that of the
  <i>ancien régime</i>, and he knew, despite his elaborate devices to gain
  popularity, that he was as despised and resented as any of these tyrants
  whose lilies he had erased with such servility from his escutcheon.</p>

  <p>The long gallery of the palace was dull with a neglected splendour; the
  modest habits of the liberal monarch went ill with this background designed
  for the flourish of, at least, outward glories. The King, with his bundle of
  newspapers, approached a group of gentlemen who were talking casually of the
  Chinese Industrial Exhibition in the Rue Neuve-Saint-Laurent; Louis Philippe
  detached one of these from the others, and, with his air of gentle candour,
  remarked:</p>

  <p>"Everyone is talking of your extraordinary governess, M. du Boccage."</p>

  <p>"I was aware of that, but I was not aware it had reached the ears of Your
  Majesty."</p>

  <p>"Ah, I hear everything; the newspapers take care of that," replied Louis
  Philippe with a grimace. "We have a new power here"&mdash;he touched the
  packet under his arm&mdash;"these rogues are dangerous."</p>

  <p>The Duke, smiling, amiable as usual, did not appear in the least
  discomposed. The King regarded him shrewdly.</p>

  <p>"You are going too far, I do not know whether you are very simple or very
  cunning, that is scarcely my business, but, my dear fellow, you must
  understand this is a game you cannot play."</p>

  <p>"The situation has entirely been misunderstood; it is my wife's wish that
  this lady retains her place in my establishment."</p>

  <p>"With so much domination, so much power, going everywhere with your
  children, received by all your friends?" asked the King sharply, "wearing the
  clothes, even the jewels, she does? Oh, I admit she is a remarkable young
  person, but she is also a nobody."</p>

  <p>"My wife has not complained."</p>

  <p>"She is very loyal and greatly beloved."</p>

  <p>"There is no need for her to complain: the situation. Sire, is neither
  mysterious nor painful&mdash;as for these gutter rags... "</p>

  <p>"You have a treasure of a wife."</p>

  <p>"No one knows that better than I do, Sire. Unfortunately Fanny's health
  does not permit her to undertake any of her duties. As for the power that
  Mademoiselle Debelleyme seems to allocate to herself, it is my wife's wish
  she should assume it, and her clothes go to my wife's account."</p>

  <p>"Very clever... very clever," exclaimed the King impatiently, "but, I pray
  you, stop in time."</p>

  <p>With emphasis he added:</p>

  <p>"I have seen it done in my own home. It is quite true that I and all my
  brothers and sisters, adored Madame Genlis, made of her almost a goddess, she
  was everything to us, my mother the merest shadow. Let me, however, tell you
  this&mdash;I have been through much, as you know, prison, exile,
  poverty&mdash;but I have no sadder, more poignant recollection than that of
  my poor mother, estranged from us, from her husband, by this woman, dying,
  alien from all who should have loved her&mdash;of a broken heart. I am an old
  man now, M. du Boccage, I have a little experience, if not much authority.
  Look to your affairs."</p>

  <p>M. du Boccage did not take this pathetic appeal in good part, especially
  as it followed on one or two galling remarks dropped by M. de Nemours.</p>

  <p>"Your Majesty is mistaken in supposing that anyone&mdash;that any woman
  can dominate me."</p>

  <p>"Yet this has the air of an infatuation. Of course everyone thinks that
  she is your mistress. My dear Du Boccage, you do not suppose I would
  interfere in your intimate affairs? But scandal&mdash;with a man of your
  rank, I cannot afford&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle Debelleyme is not my mistress, she is a woman of the highest
  character."</p>

  <p>To this the troubled King replied, almost in the words that had been used
  by Madame du Boccage:</p>

  <p>"She has the appearance of being so and that is the main thing. Listen to
  me," he added with impressive earnestness, "I cannot, I will not have a
  scandal among my friends, among the nobility. You have some idea how affairs
  are in France, the feeling of the people against us, the difficulty of
  maintaining this role of liberalism, the hatred there is for the aristocracy,
  for the Chamber of Peers, the avidity with which every scrap of scandal is
  leaped on, and, mon Dieu! Teste&mdash;Cubières&mdash;that's deadly, that is
  sufficient! You," he added with that emphatic and persuasive dignity he knew
  so well how to employ, "are widely known, an intimate of my son, one of the
  firmest supporters of my House, I have richly rewarded all that you and your
  father have done for me, you are Chevalier d'honneur to the Duchesse
  D'Orleans: if I may not command, I entreat&mdash;do not allow slander the
  least ground, put an end to these insinuations in the press, make up your
  differences with your wife and dismiss this governess."</p>

  <p>"Sire, I have no differences with my wife and she does not desire me to
  dismiss this governess."</p>

  <p>"It is sufficient that everybody is gossiping, whispering,
  hinting&mdash;and there is some ground for suspicion. When, the other day,
  Madame de Brancas said to your wife: 'Is it not true that your husband adores
  you?' the poor woman could not command herself&mdash;she lost countenance and
  nearly broke into tears."</p>

  <p>The Duke's smile twitched into a grin. "Fanny is hysterical. And these
  recriminations of women! Who, Sire, put Madame de Brancas on to probe my
  wife's feelings? Forgive me if I find it strange that my most trivial
  domestic affairs interest Your Majesty."</p>

  <p>He had flushed violently; the King regarded him shrewdly, wondering what
  was the truth about this man whom he had, until lately, regarded as an
  indolent, good-natured, elegant creature sunk in connubial bliss, leading the
  most blameless life of any member of the aristocracy.</p>

  <p>"It does interest me, M. du Boccage. It amazes me, too. Frankly, what do
  you hope? It is her money, the Frediani money that you spend on Javiaux du
  Boccage. Foolishly, as I think, for no one of your rank will ever be able to
  live on that scale again."</p>

  <p>The Duke did not answer; he had not sufficient skill with words to be able
  to disguise his deep anger; he was a man who most bitterly resented the least
  interference, yet seemed destined to have perpetually to endure it. He gave
  the King an uneasy impression of something savage at bay.</p>

  <p>"No more words. Monsieur," sighed Louis Philippe. "You must understand me.
  Let the young woman go while you can do so without an open fracas, give her a
  pension, what you will, send her to England, to Italy, anywhere. I give you
  good advice."</p>

  <p>"Sire&mdash;I have been spied on&mdash;by servants."</p>

  <p>"Who is not spied on&mdash;by servants? You should have been equal to
  circumventing the baseness of&mdash;what? Despair, perhaps, M. du
  Boccage?"</p>

  <p>The King turned on his heel and walked away down the gallery; the Duke
  drew further into the window recess, dragged out his frail cambric
  handkerchief and, under pretence of wiping his lips, tore it with his strong,
  even teeth.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch29"
     name="ch29">CHAPTER XXIX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The King's warning, the murmurs of his brother the Comte
  Edouard, his sisters, his friends, caused the Duke to offer large concessions
  with the readiness of a man who does not intend to give an inch. He forced
  himself to go through a form of reconciliation with his wife, and took her to
  Dieppe for her health, as he said, but really to escape the espionage of
  Paris, leaving the governess in the Faubourg St. Honoré with the children.
  But at the end of the week Mademoiselle Debelleyme joined them... it was
  really a pity to separate mother and little ones, and the sea air had not
  proved as beneficial for the Duchess as had been hoped; she pined in the
  hired villa in Dieppe and had to continue the frictions of opium on head and
  chest that had so long been her only means of securing sleep.</p>

  <p>The truth was that she alone knew the extent of that concession on the
  part of her husband at which his monitors rejoiced. Their apartments in the
  Villa Violette were as separate as those in the Faubourg St. Honoré, he never
  spoke to her except in public; his nervous, desperate desire to avoid a scene
  had made him recently cease that evening visit of courtesy to say good night
  that had been his last link with one time tenderness.</p>

  <p>She had now no chance to break through his frozen amiability, his
  deliberate civility, and the frantic letters she wrote in her lonely bedroom
  redoubled in clumsy invocations of the past and anguished fears as to the
  future.</p>

  <p>The villa was gloomy, the weather bad. The pale light of the sea invaded
  the tall rooms with the uncomfortable Empire furniture, the stiff draperies
  of a chill ocean-blue colour, the austere tea-table set with cumbrous silver
  and china where the governess, in her neat striped silk gown, presided. The
  Duke played backgammon with Isabelle by the hearth, the boy whispered over a
  book with plates of coloured shells by the high window that looked on to the
  calm sea, and Cesarine and Laure played with a grey kitten on the floor by
  Mademoiselle Debelleyme.</p>

  <p>Into this scene the Duchess entered and sank, breathing heavily, on to the
  sofa facing the window. Her bonnet was unfastened, she was unbecomingly
  flushed, her hair was untidy; she appeared coarse and unattractive beside the
  governess. She held several small parcels on her lap, and in an unsteady
  voice implored the children to come and look at what she had bought for them;
  none of them responded, and the Duke, who had risen at his wife's entry but
  taken no further notice of her, continued his game, standing.</p>

  <p>"Oh, fie," cried the governess to the little ones at her feet. "Go at
  once. Mademoiselles, and see what Madame your mother has been good enough to
  bring you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We want to play with Mimi&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The mother rose and came forward, holding out a little doll dressed as a
  fishwife; Cesarine had sprung up, but the heavy emotion of Madame du Boccage
  gave her an air of menace. The child was frightened at the greedy advance of
  the dark heavy woman, she threw herself into the arms of Mademoiselle
  Debelleyme and hid her face.</p>

  <p>"Ah, that now!" exclaimed Madame du Boccage; above the golden head of
  Cesarine she saw the brilliant steady eyes of her enemy looking at her with
  scorn, with triumph, though the governess was murmuring: "Go to your mother,
  darling, she has brought you a pretty present&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The Duchess stumbled to the door with a cry that roused the boys from
  their absorption in their book; Philippe Joseph cried out:</p>

  <p>"Mother! Mother! What is it?"</p>

  <p>"I will trouble none of you! I am a stranger here&mdash;my position is
  intolerable! I am going to make an end of it!"</p>

  <p>She rushed out, slamming the door. The Duke did not move, but Isabelle,
  overturning the gueridon on which the game rested, clung to her father,
  screaming out for him to "Stop mother!" Cesarine clasped the governess
  tighter and began to sob loudly.</p>

  <p>For a moment the Duke was immobile; he and the governess looked at each
  other over the children's heads, a long, intense glance of complete
  understanding. The little girls continued to sob, the boys to urge.
  Mademoiselle Debelleyme held Cesarine tight by her slender body as the Duke
  moved slowly across the window, behind him the pale glimmer of the sea. Then
  with a shrug he turned and reluctantly left the high, pale room.</p>

  <p>When the Duchess found herself on the beach she was ashamed of her
  outburst. Her husband found her in a bazaar buying Chinese curiosities and
  informed her brusquely that they were returning the next day to Paris... this
  visit to Dieppe could not be called a success.</p>

  <p>With a look, a gesture of despair, the unhappy woman locked herself in her
  room with Matilde.</p>

  <p>The Duke returned to Mademoiselle Debelleyme, who was amusing the
  distracted children in the high, sombre parlour, lit by the cold light
  reflected from a colourless sky and grey sea.</p>

  <p>Sending the children out with the nurse, he turned to the young woman and
  demanded:</p>

  <p>"How long do you think this can go on? She will come to some harm, she
  should be where she can be looked after, day and night."</p>

  <p>To these commonplace phrases Lucille Debelleyme replied with one of those
  looks which was their mutual language:</p>

  <p>"I have often feared it, I had a strange uneasiness when I saw her bedroom
  ... You know, if in one of her passions she threw herself, heavy as she is,
  on that bed&mdash;the baldaquin seems so ill balanced... "</p>

  <p>He bit his forefinger:</p>

  <p>"Why, so it is, yet I had never thought of it&mdash;I will look to the
  supports."</p>

  <p>"And then," continued the governess lightly approaching him "if she was to
  one day find a cord, a bottle of laudanum or arsenic&mdash;you had some at
  Javiaux du Boccage for the rats in the vaults&mdash;or&mdash;her
  opium&mdash;the doctor measures it out, I know&mdash;but if one day he should
  leave it behind by chance... Oh, Monsieur, we really should be careful."</p>

  <p>There was an awful blankness in his stare as he replied dully:</p>

  <p>"Yes, we must be careful." Then in a low tone of repressed fury: "But
  would it not be better if she did make an end it?&mdash;This is intolerable,
  insupportable."</p>

  <p>The governess did not answer; she was invaded by a sense of horror. She
  detested this lofty, pale room, the depressing pallor of the misty sea beyond
  the high windows, an atmosphere that was filled at once with boredom, nervous
  tension and the dread of violence.</p>

  <p>She knelt down before the empty hearth and began to pick up the tric-trac
  pieces. This was the second time she had been at his feet; he made no effort
  to raise her. When she stood up, the game in her hand, he was still staring
  at the sea; she touched his arm, for he had the look of someone in a trance.
  He started and exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, we must certainly return to Paris&mdash;and I will see about
  the baldaquin&mdash;"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">It was the Duchess who relieved the tension of this
  situation. As soon as she had recovered sufficiently she retired to Locroi,
  taking with her the youngest children and the nurses, while the Duke, making
  his gesture towards a peaceful settlement of his domestic affairs, sent the
  elder boy to the care of a tutor in the College Bourbon.</p>

  <p>At the beginning of spring Maréchal Frediani sent an invitation from
  Corsica for his daughter and his grandchildren to visit him. The Duchess
  refused to return from Normandy, but M. du Boccage declared he was weary of
  Paris and longed for a holiday, he had the pleasantest recollections of the
  Mediterranean, he would himself take little Isabelle, now of an age to
  appreciate the beauties of the South, and, as a matter of course, the
  governess would accompany them.</p>

  <p>The Duchess, advised by a cold letter from her husband of this project,
  offered no objection. Whether her consent was forced from her by resignation
  or despair her husband neither knew nor cared.</p>

  <p>"You see," he remarked to the governess, "patience gains the day. I have
  conceded nothing, but now she has conceded all. She has the good sense to
  learn that I am not to be moved by scenes and lamentations."</p>

  <p>He sighed with satisfaction at the thought of the success of his long and
  patient manoeuvres which had ended in his wife's unexpected permission for
  this voyage to Italy. He appeared to believe that this tempestuous,
  tenacious, exasperating woman had at length realised that she had lost for
  ever all domination over him and that she would allow him in the future the
  liberty he had for several years demanded.</p>

  <p>He appeared almost gay at the thought that this intolerable tyranny had at
  length come to an end, more than ever he was the cavalier preparing for the
  Embarkation for Cytherea.</p>

  <p>The governess regarded him curiously; she wondered, with secret
  apprehension, if he was, after all, despite all his subtle ties and patient
  intrigues, really a stupid man?</p>

  <p>He remarked her hesitation with some irritation.</p>

  <p>"Do you not care. Mademoiselle, for the thought of this escape to the
  South? Are you not also a little weary of Paris?&mdash;of the Faubourg St.
  Honoré?"</p>

  <p>"I am thinking, Monsieur," replied the governess with her cold brilliant
  smile, "that it will be like standing naked in the Palais Royal and expecting
  people not to stare at us."</p>

  <p>"Do you think that it will cause a further scandal? Ah, very well, but one
  should pay no heed to the gossips, all that can be said has been said. And
  the purity of our intentions&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She decided that such banality must be really irony. She hesitated a
  moment but a moment only; what, after all, had she to lose? Her all was
  centred in this man, his protection, his friendship. It did indeed matter to
  her very little what the world might say as long as she preserved his
  interest.</p>

  <p>To travel with him on the borders of the Mediterranean, in Italy, free
  from spies and the overwhelming presence of the sick, jealous woman&mdash;a
  dangerous pleasure, perhaps, but she had never allowed cowardice to interfere
  with her design Without changing her manner of passionate loyalty veiled by
  implacable decorum, she said:</p>

  <p>"I shall be pleased, Monsieur, to accompany you and Isabelle to
  Corsica."</p>

  <p>This Italian interlude was the entering of another sphere for Lucille
  Debelleyme. If she had hoped to escape all hostility, all espionage she was
  soon proved to have been mistaken; the glances, the comments she had to
  endure even on the voyage showed that, and when she reached the great palace
  in Corsica owned by the father of Madame du Boccage, the icy courtesies and
  ironic glances of the old Maréchal informed her that she was still under the
  supervision of an enemy, warned her that she danced and flaunted on the edge
  of an abyss; but the borders of an abyss hung with the most entrancing
  flowers. After all she could not find much that disturbed her, beside the
  fact that she was in the company of Camille du Boccage.</p>

  <p>She was not often alone with him but constantly in his presence. No word
  of love was exchanged between them, but the strongest, deepest, most
  intoxicating intimacy bound them.</p>

  <p>He would look at her across a crowd; the pressure of his hand when he said
  good night; his smile when he saw her in the morning; this was enough.
  Careful not to allow a handle to any slanderer, not to trespass on the rigid
  rules of propriety, Lucille Debelleyme enjoyed this intricate and difficult
  game that she and M. du Boccage played. This secret alliance, this complete,
  silent understanding produced a serene tranquillity that enveloped them
  whenever they were together&mdash;alone or among others.</p>

  <p>Her cold sensitive, fastidious nature, profoundly shocked by the sordid
  issue of her one love adventure, did not fret at this long prelude to a drama
  on which the curtain might never rise. It was enough to see him, to listen to
  him, to know he was always there, near, to know that he watched her when she
  played with his charming little girl, to note the change in his voice as he
  spoke to her, to experience the subtle joy of seeing him turn his head, pause
  in his conversation and look at her as she entered any room in which he might
  be.</p>

  <p>His wife wrote to him; Lucille Debelleyme had come upon him tearing up the
  unopened letters in the familiar writing and throwing them under his
  writing-table, she had also come upon him tearing up a packet of Parisian
  newspapers, "No doubt he and I are being pilloried there."</p>

  <p>She could not of course avoid asking herself how is this going to end? Had
  the Duchess really given way, resigned herself, without a struggle, to the
  authority of the governess? Would the lawful wife's father, her relatives,
  the Royal Family, public opinion, allow her to sink effaced into the
  background? Would she, Lucille Debelleyme, become now what all the world
  believed her to be, mistress of M. du Boccage?</p>

  <p>He had not asked her for the slightest favour; if he did Mademoiselle
  Debelleyme did not know what her answer would be. For the first time in her
  life she found that her usual cool, keen consideration of her own interests
  were confused by a rising passion.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch30"
     name="ch30">CHAPTER XXX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Continual parties in honour of the charming little
  granddaughter of M. de Frediani were given on his vast estates while the
  Southern spring burst open around them. The sky and stars and flowers, sun
  and moon and sea offered the most entrancing decoration for any tale of
  love.</p>

  <p>One night Lucille Debelleyme, who always had to leave balls and receptions
  early with her little charge, put a lace shawl over her delicate silk dress
  and quietly left the Palace; she had wanted to for many nights. The moon was
  full and, urged by a restless excitement, she had been unable to remain in
  her room. She walked without conscious direction through a grove of oleanders
  and came out on the shore, pale gold sands silvered by the moonlight, a line
  of slowly curling surf white as ivory, and a sea of violet blue. Above her
  the Southern moon seemed huge and very near and she felt as if she could
  catch it in her hand.</p>

  <p>She walked along slowly, losing herself in the enchantment and beauty, and
  where some low rocks dark with the fragrance of some rich aromatic plants
  stood, almost at the water's edge, she met Camille du Boccage.</p>

  <p>She wondered if he had followed her, but she did not greatly care; he was
  hatless and pale, the moonlight touched his thick blond hair, his colourless
  face, the linen of his cravat and shirt almost into the likeness of an
  alabaster statue, only faintly tinged with colour, and Mademoiselle
  Debelleyme thought, idly curiously, of the statue of Cupidon that she had
  noticed, looking over her shoulder into the mirror the first day that she
  came to the Faubourg St. Honoré.</p>

  <p>She did not pause in her slow walk along the edge of the surf and he fell
  into step beside her. She could see nothing remarkable in this. Without a
  word they experienced the intense delight of complete intimacy, their
  everyday relationship and circumstances completely forgotten. Their hands
  hung idly a their sides and as if by accident their fingers touched. The
  silver mist that seemed to rise from land and sea, drawn up towards the moon,
  enveloped them both, shutting them off from reality. She raised her face,
  smiling steadily, and he said, under his breath:</p>

  <p>"Is this love or something more?"</p>

  <p>The question seemed to have no meaning, for what could be more than love?
  Yet she knew; here was something so rare that she had never known of it
  before and never would look for it again, something so real that all the rest
  of her life seemed a sham beside it; he and she, in what relationship? It did
  not matter. He and she, drifting towards what catastrophe? It did not matter.
  They had met, and recognised each other, by what magic? She did not care. It
  was enough that they had.</p>

  <p>They walked on again in silence, she shivered as the cold creeping edge of
  the sea wetted her thin doeskin shoes. He took her hand and turned it over
  curiously in his own, looking down at her.</p>

  <p>"Of course," he whispered in a voice that sounded far away, "this would be
  too powerful for anyone to resist. Nothing would matter beside this."</p>

  <p>"No, no."</p>

  <p>A sudden inlet of the sea running in a wide arm between the rocks cut off
  their progress. They turned back and saw before them the Palace with its
  lighted windows showing deep yellow in the incandescent blueness of the
  night.</p>

  <p>"What will happen?" asked Lucille.</p>

  <p>"I do not know."</p>

  <p>He seemed like a man under the influence of a heavy drug. She knew, and
  this was one of the traits she admired in him, that he was very sober, he
  neither drank nor smoked; his vices and indulgences were not those that left
  traces upon his person. Yet to-night he seemed intoxicated.</p>

  <p>They walked on towards the purple rock on which the great Palace Frediani
  stood.</p>

  <p>This was a very different ocean from that which had lapped the dreary
  beach before the austere respectability of the Villa Violette. She drew her
  fine, silk hem away from the crawling reach of the ivory-coloured foam and
  found pleasure in the grace of her own gesture. She looked up again at his
  face outlined between her and the sea, illuminated by the moonshine. It was
  slightly distorted, that face, there was something of the demi-god, she
  thought, in the outline... debased demi-god or noble beast? Something, at
  least, not human, something she had always wanted, that satisfied her
  completely.</p>

  <p>She neither tempted nor repelled as she walked beside him in silence; she
  was not one to force a moment, to provoke a climax. Above all she was not one
  to indulge her own passion. They mounted in silence the dark rock, scented
  from the growing plants; from the open windows of the Palace came the sound
  of a polka.</p>

  <p>All that winter Lucille Debelleyme had listened to the polkas so
  fashionable in Paris, she had heard them played, she had played them hundreds
  of times... Never yet had she danced the polka or any other dance: the music
  came out persistently into the night.</p>

  <p>"I must go back."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I was wrong to believe that here we should be free from
  spies&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, it's her father's house!"</p>

  <p>"Everyone is against us."</p>

  <p>"It matters so little."</p>

  <p>"Lucille, Lucille, you played that polka in Paris?"</p>

  <p>"For your daughters."</p>

  <p>"Is it honest to marry a boy of seventeen?&mdash;my father&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I must go."</p>

  <p>"Yes, you are right to think of your reputation&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Tenderly she replied:</p>

  <p>"I do not. I have nothing to lose equal to what I have gained. But you!
  You risk too much."</p>

  <p>She moved swiftly from him, leaving him a shadow among the rustling
  oleanders. The Palace rose sheer above her with the menacing bulk of a
  monster chained to the rocks; the lighted windows were like eyes to spy and
  mock, but above was the moon, the fresh night wind, below the sweep of the
  surf on the sand. These were her allies; in their presence she was
  justified.</p>

  <p>When she reached her own room she was shaken by a force of emotion she
  could not control, and she fell on her knees by the bed of chestnut wood. The
  window was open wide and all the beauty of the night outside seemed filled
  with his presence. The governess put out all the candles except one. She
  undressed quickly, unhooking, unbuttoning in haste, taking off the little
  shoes cold with sea water, the corsets of white satin warm from her body. She
  peered into the mirror, not with self-assurance as usual, but timidly, asking
  herself: "Am I lovely enough? Will he expect more than this?"</p>

  <p>She put out the one candle; the moonlight was enough.</p>

  <p>He knew where her room was; she kept a night lamp burning and set her door
  wide, but he did not come. She writhed under the scorn of her own caution,
  she wished she had not been at such desperate pains to impress on him the
  legend of her purity.</p>

  <p>She flung herself face downwards on the bed and bit her thumb to steady
  her nerves; persistently there beat on her ears the rhythm of the polka.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch31"
     name="ch31">CHAPTER XXXI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The Maréchal Frediani decided to accompany his son-in-law
  and his grandchild back to Paris and Lucille Debelleyme knew the reason of
  this decision. The scandal that the pride and dignity of Madame du Boccage
  had for so long kept at bay had now broken into the open. Every newspaper
  published in Paris had something about this aristocrat of the <i>ancien
  régime</i> living in open adultery with the shameless governess, who was,
  according to some, Italian, according to others, English, according to all,
  on the make. The Church was roused against this atheist who defied all moral
  laws, the legitimists were roused against this member of the old nobility who
  had followed the cadet branch of the House of Bourbon, and the people, hating
  anything to do with the Chamber of Peers, murmured in increasing fury against
  this flaunting of open immorality which in a less important man would have
  been punished severely.</p>

  <p>Lucille Debelleyme knew from the moment she arrived in Paris that the
  affair had come to a climax.</p>

  <p>Very shortly after her return to the Faubourg St. Honoré, where Madame du
  Boccage had received her with resigned sweetness, the governess waited on the
  Marshal Frediani who had come, she knew, to Paris with the sole purpose of
  removing her from his daughter's household.</p>

  <p>She carried in her small, exquisitely gloved hand some newspapers and put
  them down on the ornate Empire bureau before the old soldier, pointing out to
  him the paragraphs where there were scarcely veiled insinuations against
  herself.</p>

  <p>"An abominable situation has been created for me, I cannot remain with
  your daughter, Monsieur Le Maréchal, another day. There is nothing for me to
  do but to immediately withdraw from her establishment, from Paris."</p>

  <p>"Why, Mademoiselle, do you come to me?"</p>

  <p>"Because I am helpless, friendless, a young woman who has been foully
  attacked, and because you. Monsieur, know that I am innocent. You had my
  behaviour every minute of the day, under your eyes, in Corsica."</p>

  <p>M. Frediani did not immediately answer, he was perfectly aware of his
  daughter's frightful situation, of the miserable disarray in her household,
  of the long separation between her and her husband. He disliked the governess
  for the part she had played in the tragedy of Madame du Boccage but he could
  not precisely put his finger on what the part was; he was baffled. It was
  quite true that during the stay in Corsica he had observed nothing; and this
  move now, this appeal to him, was it cunning or innocence?&mdash;he did not
  know. Experienced diplomat as he was he could read nothing in the cold eyes,
  so brilliant, so searching, that the governess turned on him in righteous
  indignation.</p>

  <p>She must certainly go, he had resolved that. She must, as soon as
  possible, leave the Faubourg St. Honoré, but the wily old man saw that for
  her to go with a burst of scandal would be to play into her hands, to make
  her a heroine, a victim, to sacrifice his daughter's dignity and peace of
  mind, and would create an uproar that would split the whole house of
  Montlosier du Boccage and probably cast a slur on the whole of the ancient
  peerage, already with so much difficulty upholding if prestige in the eyes of
  the people.</p>

  <p>He rose, took a turn about his beautiful apartment, then with an air of
  friendly but formidable authority, he paused before the slender expectant
  figure of the governess.</p>

  <p>"No, Mademoiselle, it is not the moment for you to leave my daughter's
  establishment. To do so would be to confirm all the lying gossips which have
  so justly offended you; ignore their slanders and they fall silent of
  themselves."</p>

  <p>"Of all things avoid a scandal?" asked Mademoiselle Debelleyme, rising to
  her feet. "Yes, for the sake of your daughter, of your grandchildren, of your
  son-in-law himself, perhaps, for the sake of all your house and
  connection?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, Mademoiselle, that is my wish."</p>

  <p>"But for me," she lightly struck her breast, "you do not think of my
  reputation or peace of mind, or happiness? I am worthless, a nobody!"</p>

  <p>"I do not see, Mademoiselle, how you would serve your interests by leaving
  my daughter's house now. Remain where you are, pursue your usual course of
  life and we can talk of this later, when all this hurly burly has died
  down."</p>

  <p>"Then, Monsieur Le Maréchal, will you please see your daughter and get her
  to ask me herself to stay in her establishment? This request cannot come from
  M. du Boccage, as you must be aware, nor scarcely from yourself; she alone,
  for her own sake, must ask me to remain."</p>

  <p>The old man was silent; he began to perceive that he dealt with a very
  clever person. No doubt the governess had not the least intention of leaving
  the Faubourg St. Honoré, no doubt she meant not only to remain there but to
  remain on the most honourable terms; that was why she had forced his hand,
  compelling him to ask his daughter to allow this formidable enemy to remain
  under her roof.</p>

  <p>He bit his lip and his dark Southern eyes were angry but she had him
  cornered, there was nothing he could do but to accede.</p>

  <p>"I will speak to Madame du Boccage; it is desirable that you should for
  the present"&mdash;he stressed the three words and Mademoiselle Debelleyme
  perfectly understood why&mdash;"remain in the Faubourg St. Honoré."</p>

  <p>The governess took her dignified leave, she had triumphed completely.</p>

  <p>The Maréchal Frediani kept his word, he spoke earnestly to his
  daughter:</p>

  <p>"I returned to Paris with the full intention of helping you to get rid of
  this young woman, but I was not quite prepared for this outburst of
  scandal&mdash;that must be weathered. She has come to me, she had the
  effrontery to complain, she has won, I fear, the first move. She must remain
  until all this noise has died down. Take my advice, my dear Fanny; I know
  something of the world, show yourself as friendly as possible to this
  creature, have an air of disdaining all that is insinuated, and presently, we
  will get rid of her."</p>

  <p>Madame du Boccage agreed with her father with a readiness that surprised
  him; her pride in her family, her dignity as wife and mother were strong, she
  was ready for almost any sacrifice that would avoid a scandal which would
  reflect so miserably on herself, her father, her children, on the whole caste
  to which she belonged.</p>

  <p>"I had already resolved to do so, I will do all I can to ignore these
  miserable slanders."</p>

  <p>"It is you alone who can do anything. Fanny; I will not deny that the
  situation is ugly. What," he added with impulsive irritation, "is the matter
  with Camille? Is he in love?"</p>

  <p>"In love, yes, but in what fashion? I confess that I have lost all hope!
  But I did not wish to tell anyone, not even you. You know nothing of my
  sufferings, of what it has been like; I have been wrong, too, I lose my
  temper, I speak violently and I make scenes and he can endure none of these
  things, and yet when he is with me I cannot control myself."</p>

  <p>With an effort she maintained her calm. "Tell me, father, you are
  experienced, you know the world, men and women. They were together under your
  eyes in Corsica. Is she, I do not know&mdash;I am baffled&mdash;is she his
  mistress?"</p>

  <p>"His mistress, no, though it may seem strange, I do not think so."</p>

  <p>"What then is it? It is like an enchantment, a witchcraft, as if she has
  taken possession of his very soul. He has given her all my authority, all my
  power, he has put in her charge all my children."</p>

  <p>Seeing a rising storm of hysteria threaten his daughter's uneasy calm, the
  old man put his hand on her shoulder and said tenderly:</p>

  <p>"Think no more of it. Fanny, we must wait, we must be patient. Dignity,
  generosity, charity, these are your only weapons."</p>

  <p>"I know, but, Camille, my children, they are lost... "</p>

  <p>"Nay, not lost, this passion, this infatuation, whatever it is, is too
  violent to last."</p>

  <p>Looking at her father timidly, the Duchess asked in a pitiful voice:</p>

  <p>"Do you intend that she shall go?"</p>

  <p>"I do, I shall use all my power, all my authority; I have the Royal Family
  behind me, public opinion; he cannot resist. Do not look so uneasy," he added
  impatiently; his daughter was taring at him with an expression of awful
  terror. "What is the matter, do you not wish this creature flung out of your
  establishment? Nay, all must be done with decorum, she must have a pension,
  she must be sent to England. It shall be arranged."</p>

  <p>"But, Camille," murmured the Duchess, "he will never forgive me. I have a
  presentiment&mdash;I know not&mdash;but I believe if I force him to give her
  up, whatever she may be to him, I shall at the same time destroy myself."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch32"
     name="ch32">CHAPTER XXXII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">On the occasion of Madame du Boccage's birthday, the
  governess sent the Duchess an exquisite piece of needlework designed and made
  by herself. Complimentary, charming and delicate letters were exchanged, the
  Duchess returned the present, that she received with graciousness, by a gift
  of a bracelet of blue turquoises arranged so that they looked like a cluster
  of forget-me-nots. Mademoiselle Debelleyme tried them on, an ironic smile on
  her lips, and then flung them into her trunk.</p>

  <p>Madame du Boccage, who had begun to go about much in society in order to
  dispel the scandals so vibrant in Paris, frequently appeared with her husband
  at formal entertainments. On several occasions she offered the governess a
  seat in her box at the Opera; paragraphs in the newspapers became less
  frequent and gossiping tongues wagged more slowly, and finally, with disgust,
  fell silent; M. du Boccage had been saved by the tact of his father-in-law,
  by the generosity of his wife. It was impossible to say either openly or
  secretly that the pale young woman who, bearing herself with dignified
  respect, sat behind the Duchess in her box at the Opera, at the Hippodrome,
  who shared her carriage with her in the Bois, who continued to take charge of
  her children, who frequently led them to the old Maréchal Frediani's
  establishment, was the mistress of her husband.</p>

  <p>In a few weeks talk had died away and things were as they had been in the
  Faubourg St. Honoré. It was then that the Maréchal Frediani, with his
  daughter's assistance, prepared an ultimatum for the Duke, who, during all
  this cautiously arranged intrigue, had given no indication of what he thought
  or felt.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch33"
     name="ch33">CHAPTER XXXIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Mademoiselle Debelleyme was not deceived by the false calm
  which had descended on the household in the Faubourg St. Honoré, nor by the
  compliments that passed between herself and Madame du Boccage, nor even by
  the seats in the carriage and at the Opera.</p>

  <p>She understood perfectly the intentions of M. Frediani to get rid of her
  quietly when the gossip died away. She waited, tenacious, resolute and
  patient, but she saw, with a certain ironic tenderness, that M. du Boccage,
  at least, thought that he had triumphed over his wife and father-in-law, for
  he began to plan other journeys to England, to Italy, with his eldest
  children and the governess for company.</p>

  <p>From these pleasant prospects a sharp interview with M. Frediani brusquely
  awakened him; the Maréchal demanded in plain terms when this folly was to
  come to an end and the blonde governess to be sent about her business?</p>

  <p>The Duke received these sudden reproofs in a silence that the older man
  perceived was both amazed and bitter. The Maréchal stressed his point.</p>

  <p>"This has been going on for two years; the press of Paris has taken care
  to inform the whole world that you are the subject of all manner of
  scandalous rumours."</p>

  <p>The Duke, in a low voice, threw in one of his banal phrases:</p>

  <p>"Vulgar scandal matters nothing to me."</p>

  <p>"Your daughters, your children, are they to be sacrificed?"</p>

  <p>"They know nothing, they are children."</p>

  <p>M. du Boccage had met his father-in-law in the salon de reception where he
  had first seen Lucille Debelleyme, and as he spoke he stood in the corner
  between the mirror and the alabaster statue of Cupid stringing his bow. He
  was nearly as pale as the white figure, and his face, still mechanically
  smiling, had something of the same sinister expression.</p>

  <p>Exasperated, for he believed that he had behaved in this irritating affair
  with the greatest tolerance and generosity, the Maréchal exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"What, plainly, do you hope to do?"</p>

  <p>"To keep Mademoiselle Debelleyme in my employment until my children no
  longer require a governess."</p>

  <p>"And do you also intend to persuade everybody that there is nothing
  unusual in this resolution? Do you hope to travel over England, Italy and
  France with your daughters and their governess without their mother and
  expect that you will not start the most provoking slanders?"</p>

  <p>"Have you," asked the Duke in a low, harsh voice, "been one of those who
  have helped spread these same slanders and endeavoured to destroy the
  character of Mademoiselle Debelleyme?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied the haughty old man flushing with deep anger, "I have been
  too complacent, I have played the odious part of pretending not to know what
  was going on under my nose. I have never spoken to anyone. I even received
  her in my house in Corsica, for I believed that must be the end of it, that
  when you returned to Paris she would leave."</p>

  <p>"Why should she leave?" asked the Duke; his smile stretched to a grimace
  as he fixed his dark eyes, glittering under the thick, fair lashes, steadily
  on his father-in-law.</p>

  <p>"You are blinded by a fatal passion to ask such a question."</p>

  <p>"Ah, you, like all the others, believe she is my mistress."</p>

  <p>"It is difficult to believe anything else."</p>

  <p>"If it is any satisfaction to you I can assure you that she is not. I put
  it to you in confidence. Monsieur Le Maréchal, whether in Corsica you saw
  anything wrong? You know you did not and that Mademoiselle Debelleyme is a
  young woman of unblemished reputation."</p>

  <p>The old man was profoundly irritated by these words, which were spoken
  with a tone of barely controlled fury, the more so as he was indeed baffled
  as to what was the precise relationship between his son-in-law and the
  governess.</p>

  <p>"If I had observed anything," he replied, coldly, "I should have had to
  interfere. But what does that matter?" he added with exasperated impatience.
  "You know well enough how the thing looks to the world."</p>

  <p>"And care nothing," said the Duke, advancing a step towards his
  father-in-law. "This young woman suits me. I admire her management of my
  household, since she has been with me I have had more peace than ever in my
  life before. I intend that she will remain."</p>

  <p>The Maréchal endeavoured to control his rage and despair; he felt he was
  dealing with a character that he could neither understand nor manage, with a
  stranger too, yet he had loved his son-in-law whom he had hitherto always
  found agreeable, amiable and docile.</p>

  <p>"It is like a bewitchment," he muttered. Then aloud, collecting all his
  forces: "Listen, Camille, I do not wish to think evil, I do not wish to cause
  trouble, but this woman must go. With all dignity, with all respect. She had
  better be sent to England, I will undertake to pay her a pension for life, if
  you will, give her what she wants&mdash;whatever she demands."</p>

  <p>The Duke's curious smile deepened.</p>

  <p>"It is not a question of money, she suits me, that is all."</p>

  <p>"You are the only one in the household whom she does suit. Everyone is
  against her, the servants loathe her&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ah, the servants," the Duke's sneer was deadly, "the servants whom Fanny
  has trained to spy on me!"</p>

  <p>"If Fanny has spied on you no doubt you have given her good cause for
  suspicion, but, my dear Camille, your domestic affairs are not my concern. I
  know I cannot assure my daughter's happiness by any interference of that
  nature. Have a dozen mistresses, if you will, but do not put them in charge
  of your house and your children."</p>

  <p>Drawing himself up, the formidable old man, moved by profound emotion,
  added: "If you do not give way, I must take strong measures. I shall refuse
  to receive you in my house and refuse to see that woman if she brings the
  children to see me. You will not then be able to avoid a tremendous scandal.
  Remember that I have behind me the whole of public opinion. If you wish, I
  will see drawn up to-morrow a separation between you and Fanny. You may
  choose then, Camille, between your wife and this woman."</p>

  <p>The Duke turned away quickly to hide his face, but his father-in-law saw
  it reflected in the glass; it was contorted and sweat drops had gathered
  underneath the pale, stiff hair. He was opening and closing his powerful
  hands and his wide shoulders shook.</p>

  <p>"You are beside yourself. I have regarded you with great affection and I
  am still fond of you, Camille," said the Maréchal, picking up his gloves and
  cane. "This passion, this infatuation, whatever it may be, I confess I do not
  understand; but I understand very well what I must do, and I will not retract
  a word of what I have said."</p>

  <p>Pulling out his handkerchief and wiping his face, still without turning,
  the Duke muttered:</p>

  <p>"We are going almost immediately to Javiaux du Boccage. Cannot this
  question remain until we return? Perhaps when I am out of Paris these rumours
  will peter out."</p>

  <p>"If you take Mademoiselle Debelleyme with you to the country that is not
  likely, nor can I permit this delay; my daughter will refuse to accompany you
  unless the dismissal of the governess is settled before you go."</p>

  <p>This was a declaration of war. The Duke was no longer dealing with an
  overwrought, hysterical woman. Here was something more formidable to face
  than the frantic letters, jealous cries and entreating tears of poor
  Fanny.</p>

  <p>He said nothing but stood with his back to the Maréchal and continued to
  wipe his face, holding the handkerchief so that even in the mirror his
  expression could not be seen.</p>

  <p>"You have heard, Camille, you have understood?"</p>

  <p>Receiving no reply, the old soldier, profoundly depressed, left the
  Faubourg St. Honoré.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch34"
     name="ch34">CHAPTER XXXIV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Madame du Boccage, under the guidance of her father, wrote
  her husband a letter that was quite different from those romantic,
  sentimental, heartbroken outpourings which lay in the drawer of the green
  desk.</p>

  <p>In it she told him with calm dignity that she insisted on the departure of
  the governess, that she wished to undertake the education of her own
  daughters until they were old enough to be married, that the boys should
  remain at the College Bourbon with a tutor, and that she would refuse to
  depart for Javiaux du Boccage until the governess had left the Faubourg St.
  Honoré.</p>

  <p>'My father has offered to Mademoiselle Debelleyme a yearly pension. In
  returning with these means to England, her talents and her introductions will
  procure her a good position. There need be no scene. Her withdrawal will be
  assured in an honourable manner by a pension from my father guaranteed by
  myself and her departure to England which will explain in a favourable manner
  her sudden leaving of our family. If Mademoiselle Debelleyme makes the excuse
  that she must go to Javiaux du Boccage to fetch some of her property that she
  has there, then I will wait in Paris until she returns. I believe I have
  shown already sufficient complaissance to save your reputation before the
  eyes of Paris.'</p>

  <p>The Duchess sent this letter to her husband in the morning; during the day
  she did not see him, she believed he was closeted with the governess. This
  did not give her the torment it would have formerly done for now she was
  convinced that he must give way and Mademoiselle Debelleyme leave. Yet she
  shrank from the thought of her triumph as she had formerly shrunk from the
  thought of her defeat.</p>

  <p>Towards the evening her husband softly entered her apartment; it was so
  long since he had come to see her that the very sight of him in her own room
  seemed unnatural. Not finding her in her boudoir he had come into her bedroom
  where she was sitting languidly by the window, having pulled aside the heavy
  damask curtains. It was becoming oppressively hot in Paris; the trees on
  which Fanny du Boccage gazed were dry and scorched.</p>

  <p>She turned and looked at the man she had once so passionately loved with
  the only emotion which she now ever regarded him, that of fear.</p>

  <p>He appeared sullen, unnaturally quiet; she waited for him to speak.</p>

  <p>"We go to Javiaux du Boccage to-morrow," he announced.</p>

  <p>Clasping her hands, whispering a prayer, Fanny du Boccage forced the
  courage to say:</p>

  <p>"Have you not read my letter? I cannot leave for Javiaux du Boccage."</p>

  <p>As he came towards her she turned away, his look made her shrink against
  the heavy folds of the damask.</p>

  <p>"Do you persist, then," he said in a low voice, "in your attacks against
  me? Ah, by this act you have spoilt all your life, take care!"</p>

  <p>She rose, holding on to the curtains. Ruined by ill-health and devastating
  emotion as she was, heavy in her figure and slow in her movements, yet she
  was not without dignity or some remains of her once warm, seductive beauty,
  which had often enough brought him to his knees with passion.</p>

  <p>"You make a party against me," he whispered, "you set the priests, the
  Royal Family, the public, I know not who, the servants against me, even the
  children&mdash;you try to corrupt their souls, you inspire them with hatred
  of their father."</p>

  <p>"These are ignoble words!" cried Fanny du Boccage wildly. "Camille, what
  has happened to you? You used to be so good, so tender, so kind! This woman
  ... ah... "</p>

  <p>"Seek further back than that," he interrupted, "she has had nothing to do
  with it; hold her blameless, please!"</p>

  <p>"Ah, you are so ready to defend her!" With a cry that was one of as much
  bewilderment as of despair, Madame du Boccage exclaimed: "Who is this woman,
  what is she?"</p>

  <p>He did not reply but continued to walk up and down the chamber, trying,
  she thought, to ease his profound irritation with those quick, almost
  stealthy movements. He paused by the bed where she saw him glance up at the
  heavy baldaquin from which hung the curtains of Brussels net supported by
  gilt armorini.</p>

  <p>She believed that in the tumult of his thoughts he did not know what he
  was doing, what he was gazing at; his face had a blank expression, yet there
  was something so menacing in the whole tense attitude of the man that she
  sickened with fright and began to mumble a promise that she would go to
  Javiaux du Boccage, would try to live in the same house with the
  governess.</p>

  <p>After all, there was no more that she could suffer; she had endured the
  last pangs of neglect and jealousy; why not go on and face the martyrdom to
  the end?</p>

  <p>But as she had no hope of ever recovering his affection, much less his
  love, her pride, her father, her confessor's advice, the real interests of
  her children, inspired her with strength; she caught back her stammering
  avowal of weakness and was silent.</p>

  <p>When at length he left what seemed his blind contemplation of the bed and
  turned towards her, demanding in a harsh voice: "Will you come to Javiaux du
  Boccage with Mademoiselle Debelleyme?" she, though clinging to the silk cords
  of the curtains to give her support, answered: "No."</p>

  <p>She thought that he was advancing on her to strike her; he gave her again
  that peculiar smile which for so many years she had found so lovable but
  which of late had seemed to her terrible, as if it was caused by a string
  being pulled at the back of a mask.</p>

  <p>"Well, we shall see." His voice was a low whisper as if he could command
  no more.</p>

  <p>For the first time Fanny du Boccage saw with pleasure her husband leave
  her; she had cowered before him.</p>

  <p>That lonely, hot night she wrote in the diary that had become her sole
  relief: "It is true, as my father, as all say, that I have rendered him a
  real service but&mdash;he will never pardon me. He will revenge on me day by
  day, hour by hour, minute by minute this service I have done him. He will be
  revenged on me for being right when he was wrong. The abyss opens every day
  more profoundly between us. The more he reflects the more he will feel
  himself guilty and the heavier will be his vengeance on me. The future
  frightens me, I tremble in thinking of it, I feel myself so alone. My God,
  come to my aid, give me the strength for these new trials, if it is Your
  wish, grant the greatest mercies possible for my children, for him, the
  unhappy man, who suffers, I can see that! He feels his position! My God, have
  pity on my poor children, left alone without advice in the middle of these
  agitations, these furies! And their father, my God, do not abandon him, make
  the light enter into his spirit, open Thy arms for his repentance, fortify
  him, sustain him, see that he does not fall! Alas, my God, he is blind and
  knows not what he does."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch35"
     name="ch35">CHAPTER XXXV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Lucille Debelleyme continued her calm way, performed her
  duties with her usual radiant gaiety towards the children, her respectful
  behaviour towards Madame du Boccage, her tactful courtesy towards the
  servants. She knew that she was the centre of what the Duchess had called
  "these agitations and these furies." She knew that the servants hated her and
  spied on her. She knew the Maréchal worked to remove her. She maintained her
  calm trust in M. du Boccage&mdash;she saw very little of him, his visits were
  now brief, even his conversations, his diversions with his children were
  distracted. Using a natural patience and a powerful tenacity she did not try
  to force his confidence, she never asked him what he was about to do nor what
  her fate was to be, she waited for a signal for them all to go to Javiaux du
  Boccage. She believed she was sure of him, a look, a word, a pressure of the
  hand were enough&mdash;she believed in his loyalty, his pride; despite the
  great forces against him she was confident he would not give way.</p>

  <p>An unexpected visit from an unsuspected enemy, the Abbé Galle, the
  confessor of Madame du Boccage, and in this case the emissary of the Maréchal
  Frediani, disagreeably roused the governess from her sense of security.</p>

  <p>Courteous, cool, but obviously hostile and formidable, the priest remained
  standing in Lucille Debelleyme's gay little boudoir which he had never
  entered before. She stood leaning carelessly with an air of respectful
  insolence against the muslin lace curtains, her delicate figure, her
  melancholy face, resplendent in the powerful sun of July; the Abbé, with an
  air of authority which she found peculiarly galling, came at once to his
  business.</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle, I beg you to reflect seriously on the troubles your
  presence is causing in this house. No one dares to speak to you face to face;
  I have thought therefore that it is my duty to show you the disaster towards
  which you push an illustrious family. If you insist on staying here, it will
  be impossible to avoid a great scandal. This scandal will follow you all your
  life&mdash;do not persist in your resistance. Madame la Duchesse demands your
  departure, you cannot refuse it."</p>

  <p>With an air of candid astonishment the smiling governess replied:</p>

  <p>"Madame the Duchess demands my departure? My relations with her are
  excellent, it is not long since that we exchanged presents and complimentary
  letters&mdash;what has she to complain of in my behaviour? And if she has
  these complaints why does she not bring them to me herself. Monsieur
  l'Abbé?"</p>

  <p>The priest looked at her with a grave glance that stripped aside all her
  subtle pretences.</p>

  <p>"Madame la Duchesse has not any particular grievance against you,
  Mademoiselle. She intends, on the advice of her father, the Maréchal, to
  rearrange her establishment, she will herself take care of her daughters, the
  education of her son is provided for elsewhere. There is no longer any reason
  for your presence in this house."</p>

  <p>"I am astonished," replied Mademoiselle Debelleyme coldly. "What has
  occurred, Monsieur l'Abbé, to bring about this sudden resolution on the part
  of the Maréchal and Madame du Boccage? Forgive me if I know nothing, I live
  enclosed here with the children, performing my duties."</p>

  <p>The Abbé smiled and there was something in that smile, at once
  compassionate, understanding and sadly disdainful that brought a faint colour
  to the pale cheeks of the governess. "You are very clever. Mademoiselle
  Debelleyme; a young lady of your talent will never lack a post. I believe you
  are also clever enough to have understood me perfectly and to act on my
  advice."</p>

  <p>Lucille Debelleyme was silent; her attitude remained completely
  self-assured, but in her heart was a little growing chill of fear.</p>

  <p>"And Monsieur le Duc?" she asked after a pause.</p>

  <p>"He has nothing to do with the affair, the decision remains with Madame
  and her father."</p>

  <p>He turned to leave; at the door he turned and looking again sadly at the
  slender figure of the graceful young woman, he added:</p>

  <p>"Remember, Mademoiselle, it is not words nor even actions that count
  before God, but the intentions of the heart."</p>

  <p>"It is such banalities, Monsieur l'Abbé, that disgust the intelligent with
  religion."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch36"
     name="ch36">CHAPTER XXXVI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">When M. du Boccage came to see his children that evening,
  Lucille Debelleyme, without comment, repeated to him her interview with the
  Abbé.</p>

  <p>The Duke sat down by the pianette and began savagely turning over pages of
  the music which she had been copying for his daughters.</p>

  <p>"This scandal the Abbé spoke of," he said, "can be nothing but a legal
  separation; you see, they force things to the extreme."</p>

  <p>And then the governess, breaking her long silence, asked quietly:</p>

  <p>"What do you intend to do?"</p>

  <p>For reply he muttered another question:</p>

  <p>"Do you expect anything of me?"</p>

  <p>"No," she said, coolly, "nothing whatever. You owe me nothing. I have
  always been your paid dependant, generously treated."</p>

  <p>And approaching the other side of the little musical instrument, turning
  on his downcast face her full brilliant glance, she added, with a flash of
  feeling in her voice:</p>

  <p>"It is curious to think, is it not, Monsieur le Duc, that you and I are
  the only two people who know the truth of all this? The entire world thinks
  we are lovers."</p>

  <p>"Yes," he whispered. He looked up at her; a sense of perfect intimacy, of
  complete understanding passed between them, "she has cornered me as if I was
  a tracked beast with the entire hunt out after me. All of them, in hue and
  cry at my heels! Her servants, her priests, her father!" He clenched the
  frail music sheets in his hands and flung them down. "I am to lose
  everything, my position, the children, the money... She will have no mercy,
  and why? Because I could not continue to be her lover, because I relegated
  the duties she was incapable of to one who could undertake them. For that I
  am to be ruined."</p>

  <p>"No, I will leave."</p>

  <p>"You will leave? Do you think that the better way?"</p>

  <p>"I think it is the only way, but I will accept no pension from M.
  Frediani, and I will not go to England."</p>

  <p>"What will you do, then? Where will you go?"</p>

  <p>She hesitated, it was in her mind to bring forward her imaginary suitor,
  to talk of saving herself by a miserable marriage, but she decided, on
  reflection, that this would be unwise. He had had as much as he could endure
  and though she by no means intended to lose any hold on him, she thought that
  her interests were now best served by conceding all.</p>

  <p>"We have done no wrong," she said quietly, "even the Maréchal and the Abbé
  had to admit that. They spoke to me with respect. I shall leave with complete
  dignity. If you. Monsieur, if the children wish to continue any friendship
  with me you know where I am."</p>

  <p>"I will find a way yet. I will prove to you what this has meant to me. Yes
  ... yes... " he added, distracted, "it is better that you should give way
  than subject yourself to these daily affronts&mdash;these scenes with Madame
  du Boccage&mdash;I cannot endure them&mdash;the house is hell."</p>

  <p>"It has always been," said Mademoiselle Debelleyme with bitter
  tranquillity. "I stayed for your sake. Monsieur, and for that of the
  children. Believe me, it has not been very pleasant for me&mdash;the
  servants, inspired by Madame du Boccage, hate me; I am, as you say, daily
  affronted. I have even been&mdash;with the Abbé to-day&mdash;threatened with
  a scandal that will remain with me all my life. Why should I endure
  that?"</p>

  <p>As if he had not heard what she said he whispered:</p>

  <p>"I cannot think what it will be like without you. You were my only
  friend." He rose and made half-blindly for the door, murmuring, "they'd
  better take care&mdash;they'd letter take care," then paused and looked back
  at Lucille Debelleyme.</p>

  <p>She returned his gaze steadily, passionately; she was furiously
  disappointed that he had abandoned her to her enemies, but she understood
  with perfect sympathy his position. She did not blame him at all, she valued,
  in that moment, the man himself as she had never valued him before.</p>

  <p>Nor did she intend that this should be the end of their strange,
  exasperating relationship; when she conceded the most she meant to cling the
  most tenaciously, and now that she was forced to leave she intended to give
  her departure some drama.</p>

  <p>"It is right that I should make this sacrifice. Be assured, Monsieur, that
  I shall not add to your troubles."</p>

  <p>"Are we, then, to admit defeat? To accept commands forced on us?"</p>

  <p>"We are, at least, to appear to do so." At that he made a step towards
  her, but her quick gesture, her quick words held him off. "No! Every moment
  that you spend with me is counted. Spare me what ignominy you can."</p>

  <p>He left her and she sat down at once and wrote to Madame du Boccage,
  excusing herself from a personal interview by saying that she was too
  emotionally overcome.</p>

  <p>'Madame la Duchesse, I wished to express to you myself the sentiments that
  animate me but I feel that in the present circumstances it would be a task
  beyond my power. Permit me to defer to a more calm and happy time the thanks
  which I wish to address to you for the generosity with which you have
  rewarded my feeble services. In this moment of leaving the children, towards
  whom I have always felt the liveliest tenderness, I find, in witnessing your
  satisfaction, a powerful consolation. I accept with gratitude the offers of
  recommendation that you say you will give me and I shall hasten to avail
  myself of them sometime when they may be useful to me. At present the health
  of my grandfather, very doubtful for several months, makes it a duty for me
  to go to him at once. I beg your permission to delay till a later date the
  account of all the various expenses, etc., which I must make to you, and I
  beg you, Madame, to believe in the assurance, of my most profound
  respect.</p>

  <p>Lucille Debelleyme.'</p>

  <p>When she had written this letter and sent it by the nurse to the
  apartments of the Duchess, Lucille Debelleyme paused and, locking herself
  into her room, faced her defeat as if it was a tangible object blocking her
  path.</p>

  <p>The other woman had won the battle, always an unequal, dangerous one for
  Lucille Debelleyme, penniless, without friends or resources, a servant. She
  must go, she would be no better off than she had been two years before when
  she had entered the Faubourg St. Honoré. All the delights, the luxuries, the
  pleasures of the Du Boccage establishment would now be lost. She would have
  to face frightful humiliation in this sudden departure, the gratified sneers
  of the servants&mdash;and then the children&mdash;she was really fond of the
  children, his children. She allowed herself no emotional breakdown, but set
  her teeth and began to plan for the future, trampling down her defeat,
  motioning it aside.</p>

  <p>Madame du Boccage replied, with that air of candid dignity that came
  naturally to her, to the letter in which the governess, in a tone so coldly
  formal, confessed that she had lost the battle and that her resignation had
  been wrung from her. Without touching on the painful circumstances of the
  case the Duchess thanked Mademoiselle Debelleyme for her care of the children
  and promised to take every occasion to be useful to one who was so diligent,
  so good and so faithful an instructress. She offered several letters of
  introduction to English ladies. Lady Hislop, Lady Tankerville, Miss Elkinson,
  and even promised to send to the French Ambassadress in London a letter
  declaring that Mademoiselle Debelleyme's conduct had given every satisfaction
  during the period of her stay in the Faubourg St. Honoré, and thanking her
  for recommending to her this excellent young lady.</p>

  <p>Madame du Boccage further added to her generosity by sending with the note
  a book which Mademoiselle Debelleyme had once admired at Locroi. It was an
  English work entitled <i>Amateur Gardening for Gentlewomen</i> and was
  decorated with many beautiful hand-coloured plates.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch37"
     name="ch37">CHAPTER XXXVII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Lucille Debelleyme read the letter but did not open the
  book; the recommendations were useless to her, she did not intend to go to
  England, and she had, for at least the present, lost her interest in amateur
  gardening.</p>

  <p>If Madame du Boccage had accepted her victory with gracious dignity, she
  did not however intend to forego any of the fruits of it; when she perceived
  that her husband, in order to put off the day of the governess' departure,
  now delayed the journey to Javiaux du Boccage she declared that she would
  remain in her own apartments till the governess had left the house.</p>

  <p>The Duke begged her to at least share her meals with the governess as
  before; she replied she would feel too embarrassed sitting at table with one
  who was under dismissal, but when by chance she passed the governess on the
  stairs Madame Du Boccage greeted with the most serene kindness the woman who
  had wrought such bitter havoc in her life.</p>

  <p>It was not as easy for Lucille Debelleyme to leave the Faubourg St. Honoré
  as she had thought it might be; her strength was not as great as she had
  believed. These last days were full of an extreme nervous tension, with the
  servants all looking at her with scarcely concealed triumph, avoiding her
  when they could, the children depressed and tearful, Maréchal de Frediani,
  all the members of the House of Montlosier du Boccage keeping away from the
  Faubourg St. Honoré till she left it. Her one friend, the Duke, defeated like
  herself, unable to offer her any hope, any suggestion, any succour for the
  future, Lucille Debelleyme felt her spirits sink, but she kept her control;
  repeatedly she said to herself, "go quietly, no scenes, he has had enough of
  those."</p>

  <p>But when the last moment came and she had packed all her belongings (they
  amounted now to a good deal more than the one poor trunk she had entered the
  family with) when she had shut up the pianette, drawn the cover over the
  harp, watered her flowers for the last time, she felt such a sense of loss,
  that it was difficult for her not to do what the woman whom she so despised
  did&mdash;break down, cry and scream.</p>

  <p>With her bonnet and cloak already on, her hands neatly gloved, folded in
  her lap, she was sitting in her favourite chair of pale brocade when the Duke
  brusquely entered her apartment. She knew that during these last few days his
  life had been as painful as her own&mdash;he had put up with daily scenes
  with his wife, strong criticism from her father, her relatives, the Church.
  An expression of sharp suffering had erased all youth from his face. He began
  to talk confusedly with his usual banal and clumsy phrases.</p>

  <p>Lucille Debelleyme pitied him profoundly, it was like seeing a dumb
  creature in agony that could not express its pain. He muttered expressions of
  rage about the rumours spread against him, against the Maréchal, the Abbé,
  his wife, regrets he could not take Lucille Debelleyme with him to Javiaux du
  Boccage, and mingled with all this he promised to pay her fifteen hundred
  francs yearly in recognition of her services whether or not she found another
  place.</p>

  <p>Lucille watched him being torn by a terrible inarticulate passion. She
  remembered that whisper in Corsica; "Is this love or something more?"</p>

  <p>She had a sudden, bleak realisation that in this long, patient game she
  had played she had staked and lost more than she knew; M. du Boccage, she
  knew now, was more to her than the wealthy aristocrat who could give her all
  her heart's desire in the way of luxury and pleasure, power and pride, more
  than the friend who understood her, who supported her, more than the only
  champion she had ever known; he was the man she loved. She began to sob
  quietly, like a child, into her little gloved hand, not troubling even to
  find a handkerchief.</p>

  <p>He made a little moaning sound and was with her and had her in his arms.
  That was a moment of pure delight for Lucille Debelleyme; what ease in his
  warmth, his contact, what relief to feel his body through his fine clothes;
  the very sensation of the cloth of his coat against her cheek, the perfume
  that he used was delicious. This was what she had been afraid
  of&mdash;realising how much he meant to her, and not being able to go on; she
  desperately pushed him away with a gesture that seemed of anger, but it was
  too late, Matilde, the maid had cautiously opened the door and seen them in
  each other's arms.</p>

  <p>"Madame du Boccage would like to speak to Monsieur le Duc."</p>

  <p>Her face was sullen with malice; Lucille Debelleyme stared at her directly
  and uttered the first and last word of defiance she used during her stay in
  the Faubourg St. Honoré:</p>

  <p>"Monsieur le Duc is here, go and tell your mistress where and how you find
  him."</p>

  <p>He had recoiled, at the entrance of the servant, but only a step; he
  continued to gaze at Lucille Debelleyme from under his thick, pale lashes,
  and she thought with a wild triumph:</p>

  <p>"Surely if that moment meant half as much to him as it did to me he will
  find me, he will see me again."</p>

  <p>In half an hour she was in her hired carriage and had left the Faubourg
  St. Honoré and through the sunny, dusty streets of Paris, Lucille Debelleyme
  drove to St. Cloud.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch38"
     name="ch38">CHAPTER XXXVIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">No longer would a neglected wife have to sit lonely in her
  splendid apartments knowing that Lucille Debelleyme was entertaining her
  husband in the rooms above. No longer would she, tortured by insomnia, by
  jealousy, by mental and physical agony be forced to herself descend to
  espionage and wander miserably up and down the stairs, in and out the
  corridors, seeking to discover the whereabouts of her husband, of her
  governess, no longer need she risk an outburst of rage by knocking timidly at
  his door. She would not do that again; the last time he had frightened
  her&mdash;he had taken her by the shoulders and pushed her across the
  corridor from his own rooms to hers, in her presence smashed an enamel vase
  and ripped a lace shawl that she had flung over a chair; the fury of a spoilt
  child, or the savagery of a man desperately roused? Madame du Boccage did not
  know; but she was frightened, he was so changed. She had always, until these
  last few years, thought of him as indolent, sweet-tempered, easily led
  ...</p>

  <p>Well, she had triumphed, there would be peace now in the Faubourg St.
  Honoré; but as she sat lonely as ever that evening, she could not feel that
  the departure of the governess had lifted any load from her heart. The words
  her husband had spoken to her still rung in her ears: "You will not go with
  her to Javiaux du Boccage?&mdash;you have spoilt all your life, so, you will
  not go&mdash;we shall see!"</p>

  <p>With her eyes and head aching Fanny du Boccage wrote the last lines in her
  diary, she would write no more. What more would there be to say? She believed
  that everything was finished between herself and her husband, between herself
  and Lucille Debelleyme.</p>

  <p>She had no hope for the future as she wrote: "He is always unpleasant to
  me now, he feels too keenly the extent of his wrongdoing, his malice, and
  will not understand that I can pardon and forget. My merit in that is not so
  great as he believed, I could not help being jealous where I love and I can
  forgive easily. How will all this finish?&mdash;I cannot believe in
  happiness."</p>

  <p>For a moment Fanny du Boccage could write no more, her great sorrow
  weighed her down. She could scarcely yet realise that it was all over, that
  the man she loved and for whose love she had fought was lost and perhaps her
  children lost too; all day they had been crying for the governess... she had
  forced him to choose between herself and Lucille Debelleyme&mdash;he had let
  the other woman go but he had not returned to her...</p>

  <p>Madame du Boccage, sincerely pious, turned to her usual refuge and
  concluded her diary by a prayer: "my God, my God, sustain me, direct me. I am
  afraid of the future, of his threats, of the difficulties which arise every
  day. If You will be there, in You I have confidence. You will sustain the
  poor mother to whom You have given the desire to protect her
  children&mdash;succour me."</p>

  <p>She put her diary in a packet with some other papers and sealed this with
  a black seal and wrote on the cover. "To be given to my husband after my
  death."</p>

  <p>As she did this she felt a shudder of fear, as if she was condemned to
  die; so strong was this presentiment that she began to think about her
  health, she had been very ill of late, it was quite possible she had not long
  to live. She went through her other papers and sealed them also with the
  black wax.</p>

  <p>Monsieur Desire Gavaudan de Clery received his granddaughter with bitter
  contempt. She had no sooner entered his meagre apartment than he began to
  assail her with mocking reproaches.</p>

  <p>"So in your splendour and grandeur you remembered your poor old
  grandfather! Have you come to take me promenading in the Bois in Monsieur du
  Boccage's carriage? I suppose you have at least a magnificent equipage at the
  door? Ah, your gown is very fine though I expected to see something even more
  splendid, does he not then give you presents, do you not run up accounts in
  his name?"</p>

  <p>Lucille Debelleyme had been prepared for these insults and took no
  notice.</p>

  <p>"I have left the Faubourg St. Honoré," she said, leaning against the table
  for support, "and I must beg you to take me in, for the sake of appearances,
  for the sake of my dignity."</p>

  <p>"Appearances and dignity!" he sneered, "you have had little regard for
  either these last couple of years! Why have you come to me whom you have
  ignored when you had a few sous to spend? Why doesn't Monsieur du Boccage do
  something for you?"</p>

  <p>"I have had," said Lucille, steadily keeping to the point, "to give your
  name, to say I was coming to stay with you, that was my excuse for leaving,
  you must take me in."</p>

  <p>"Must, indeed! I will not. Did I not warn you?"</p>

  <p>"I regret nothing." Lucille defied him with a pale smile. "I am asking you
  for a little help, you are my grandfather, my only relative&mdash;are you
  going to refuse me?"</p>

  <p>He looked her up and down with cold and malicious contempt.</p>

  <p>"You must be a fool as well as a hussy."</p>

  <p>Without losing patience and with a coldness equal to his own, his
  granddaughter replied:</p>

  <p>"It is you are the fool, Grandfather; I suppose you have listened to the
  stories current in Paris? Well, they are all lies&mdash;believe me or not as
  you like. Monsieur du Boccage is not my lover."</p>

  <p>"Then, my girl, you have played your cards very badly. You've created a
  scandal, lost your place and gained nothing out of it! Be gone, I will not be
  involved in your affairs."</p>

  <p>"You must have money," she insisted, standing her ground with quiet
  desperation. "Give me some, enough to start a little school for girls on my
  own. I cannot go back to being a servant. Enough perhaps to marry&mdash;with
  a small dowry I could find a husband."</p>

  <p>This mention of money turned the old man's malice to fury.</p>

  <p>"Life is impossible in Paris for you. Why do you want to stay, you
  imbecile? Go away anywhere&mdash;Russia&mdash;England&mdash;Italy&mdash;I
  care not. I have nothing to give you, you must rely on what you can make
  yourself. After all," he added with a sneer, "you have done pretty well so
  far. You may find someone else who will give you a fine carriage to ride
  about in."</p>

  <p>His granddaughter gave him a long look and gazed round the mean, squalid
  room.</p>

  <p>"What am I going to do? I have had to leave suddenly, I have had no chance
  to make preparations."</p>

  <p>At that the old man, muttering sullenly to himself, took a piece of paper
  from his pocket and wrote on it a name and address: 'Madame Flamme, 9, Rue du
  Harlay.' "You may go there. She knows me, she will take you in for a night or
  two. That is more than many people in Paris would just now, I think, and if
  you have any sense left at all you will leave the country as quickly as
  possible."</p>

  <p>With that he turned his back on her. She, without a word, left him, went
  out to the waiting cab which was still piled with her luggage, and asked the
  driver to go to Number 9, Rue du Harlay.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch39"
     name="ch39">CHAPTER XXXIX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The Hotel du Boccage was closed, the family and the servants
  had gone to Javiaux du Boccage, only the concierge remained in charge.</p>

  <p>Lucille Debelleyme walked in front of the high gates, above which waved
  the pleasant summer trees, gates which were now locked and closed to her, as
  it seemed, for ever. But she still resisted the demand of her enemies, she
  would not, however bribed by pensions or recommendations, go to England. By
  diligence, by tenacity, by accepting a miserable weekly sum she had secured a
  position in a small school for girls, which was situated in the same Rue du
  Harlay where she had found refuge with Madame Flamme. This pretentious but
  meagre enterprise, run for the benefit of the better class tradespeople who
  wished to ape gentility, was run by a Madame Trou, a Swiss woman who, it
  seemed, had passed by the scandals of Paris which had so brushed the bloom
  off the fair fame of Lucille Debelleyme. At least she appeared satisfied by
  the governess' excellent English testimonials and by the last letter written
  by Madame du Boccage. She accepted her brilliant services in return for a
  small remuneration and a miserable room looking out at the back of the house
  on to a small enclosed courtyard.</p>

  <p>The governess faced all these disadvantages with a smile. She was, at
  least, entrenched in Paris. The humiliations of her position, the poverty of
  her surroundings, were detestable, especially after two years of luxury, but
  they were also effective. She stood out as a poor young creature earning her
  living under difficulties, earning an honest and an honourable living. She
  had preserved, even in this vicissitude, even in spite of her grandfather's
  repudiation, her implacable decorum. The establishment of Madame Trou was of
  the utmost respectability.</p>

  <p>Her refusal of the benefits offered her by the Maréchal de Frediani and by
  Madame du Boccage was not, she knew, without an impressive dignity. She had
  lost all&mdash;she had been ruthlessly sacrificed to the unfounded jealousy
  of a sick, stupid woman; she must surely, in the eyes of many, cut the figure
  of a martyr...</p>

  <p>Madame Trou's establishment was partially closed for the holidays, there
  only remained a few girls whose parents were abroad and who had no friends to
  offer them holidays. It was Mademoiselle Debelleyme's duty during her first
  weeks in the Rue du Harlay to give a few lessons in music, needlework and
  painting to these poor neglected creatures, and occasionally to take them out
  in the public parks and places of instruction&mdash;the Botanical Gardens,
  the Museums of the Louvre.</p>

  <p>She performed these duties conscientiously, but without her usual gaiety.
  Indeed, as the days went on she found it very difficult to sustain the part
  she had undertaken, to walk on foot or ride in an omnibus when she had ridden
  in a carriage, to sleep in a small, dingy room, to eat coarse, greasy,
  unappetising food, to have the company of these stupid, plain, provincial
  girls, the dull, pedantic Madame Trou, after that intoxicating intimacy with
  a man like Camille du Boccage, after the affection she had enjoyed from his
  charming children.</p>

  <p>Her mind wandered to the glories of Javiaux du Boccage that her rival was
  enjoying, and the thought of that magnificent place which she had so admired
  was almost intolerable to the governess, languishing in the stale squalor of
  the narrow city streets. She began to be assailed, soul and body, by a
  longing for the master of all that magnificence. She repeated to herself the
  words murmured on that moonlit shore in Corsica: 'Is this love or something
  more?'</p>

  <p>Clever as she was, firm as was the grip she had on herself, she had
  scarcely realised how she would miss him, how precious to her had been that
  one friend&mdash;that one protector, that potential lover. There was not a
  sign from him, but the two eldest children wrote charming little letters full
  of affection, and she replied eagerly, passionately, making no secret of her
  desolation.</p>

  <p>Writing to the eldest girl, Isabelle, who was of an age, the governess
  affected to believe, to understand, she dwelt on her misery, on her despair,
  the wretched post she was forced to take, the unpleasantness of Paris in the
  great heat of the summer, the effect on her own health, her homesickness, her
  yearning for Javiaux du Boccage, and at the end of the letter added that she
  intended to change her life by a marriage that would be in a way a sort of
  suicide but which, she declared, she offered as a final sacrifice to the
  conventions, to clear her name for the sake of her dear charges whose peace
  she had outraged so unwittingly, by impulsive indiscretion.</p>

  <p>She knew that the little Isabelle would not be able to understand these
  lines, she knew also that she would take them not to her mother but to her
  father.</p>

  <p>It was the Duke who replied to this letter; in a few curt phrases he asked
  after her health, said he lacked her company at Javiaux du Boccage but that
  the work of restoration was proceeding very well. He demanded to know what
  was this marriage project, was it that she had mentioned to him before? He
  begged her to wait till his return to Paris when he hoped to be able to
  arrange something more satisfactory for the future.</p>

  <p>This was not much in the way of a love letter, nor even of a letter from a
  friend, but Lucille Debelleyme knew the man with whom she dealt, she was
  satisfied. She wrote to him in reply, she dwelt on her sufferings, on her
  miseries, she emphasised the marriage, this sacrifice, this kind of suicide
  she was making to stop all slander, to regain the honourable place in the
  world which she feared she had lost. She reiterated that only he and she knew
  their mutual innocence, she poured scorn on their slanderers, she dwelt with
  regret on the beauties of Javiaux du Boccage and contrasted it with the
  squalid surroundings she was forced to endure.</p>

  <p>He responded by platitudes but she believed that she could read under the
  dry words the throb of passion and she replied again in language that never
  infringed decorum (for she always had it in mind that his wife or some spy
  might see the letters) but yet in a language that must speak to even the most
  stupid of men in an unmistakable tone of adoration.</p>

  <p>She would marry or not marry as he directed, he was he one friend, her
  generous protector, her future lay in his hands....</p>

  <p>This correspondence was Lucille Debelleyme's last weapon, she did not mean
  to lose it or misuse it; remembering the hysterical letters of Madame du
  Boccage, which she was sure had never been read by her husband, she wrote
  briefly and to the point, yet never coldly, nor did she need to employ any
  art, duplicity or hypocrisy in this correspondence which had become the sole
  interest of her impoverished life. Seated in her cramped, dingy room, looking
  out on the dirty courtyard, again dressed as she had been in Belgrave Square
  (she did not dare show in the Rue du Harlay the gowns she had flaunted so
  prettily in the Faubourg St. Honoré) Lucille Debelleyme realised that she had
  no object in her life beyond that of renewing this enchanting friendship, of
  making it, at any cost, more than a friendship.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch40"
     name="ch40">CHAPTER XL</a></h2>

  <p class="first">M. du Boccage was absorbed in the restoration of Javiaux du
  Boccage; his wife was completely estranged from him. She had got rid of the
  presence but not the influence of Lucille Debelleyme. It was the same with
  her children, they avoided her, were sullen and petulant in her presence, all
  her arts could not win them. They openly lamented the absence of the beloved
  governess. "If only Mademoiselle were here." "We used to do so and so with
  Mademoiselle." "mademoiselle did it like that." "mademoiselle used to make it
  so amusing." And she had surprised out of them the confession that the
  governess wrote to them and they wrote to her.</p>

  <p>"And to him also, I suppose," she thought. "How can life go on like this?
  I shall never separate them&mdash;never."</p>

  <p>The Maréchal de Frediani, believing he had very comfortably settled a
  painful affair, had returned to Corsica and the Duchess had, in the isolation
  of the country, no friend beyond Matilde. She resorted to reproaches, she
  accused her children to their faces of disloyalty in preferring the governess
  to herself; she frightened and repelled them by tears and scenes. They fled
  from her to the company of their nurses, when they heard her step on the
  stairs they would shut themselves in their room and refuse to answer when she
  knocked on the door.</p>

  <p>The Duke, without comment on this chaos, sent the boys to Locroi with a
  tutor and ordered the nurses to keep the other children away from their
  mother as much as possible.</p>

  <p>Dryly, and before several servants, as if he sought their protection, the
  Duke informed his wife that he had decided to return to the Faubourg St.
  Honoré&mdash;the work on the chateau did not require his supervision for the
  moment. The Duchess vehemently objected.</p>

  <p>"Do you then," he asked, "find it so agreeable here? I wish urgently to
  return to Paris."</p>

  <p>"To visit, I suppose," she thought, "the Rue du Harlay."</p>

  <p>She resolved that the governess must leave Paris, the battle was not then
  yet won, there was still another struggle ahead; with an effort the Duchess
  braced herself for this. Her father was abroad but she had still her priests,
  her lawyers&mdash;she would get their advice as to how to dislodge the blonde
  governess from the Rue du Harlay.</p>

  <p>She was actuated by nobler motives than mere jealousy; she had resigned
  herself to the loss of her husband, but she could not resign herself to the
  loss of her children who might, she firmly believed, be morally ruined by the
  Influence of a woman who was, to Fanny du Boccage, abominable. She had been
  told by all her anxious advisers that the only hope of saving her family from
  disgrace, ridicule&mdash;the worst dishonour&mdash;was to break the
  connection (whatever it might be) between her husband and Lucille
  Debelleyme.</p>

  <p>But, always tactless, and now in her emotional turmoil more than ever
  incapable of dealing with so complicated a situation, the Duchess employed no
  arts to gain her purpose.</p>

  <p>"What! You want to return to Paris, in this heat! What is Paris like in
  August? Everyone is away&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I might return here presently. The journey is very short. If you wish you
  can remain here&mdash;with Cesarine and Laure. I will take Isabelle."</p>

  <p>"Why?" unable to check her anguish Fanny du Boccage added in a
  whisper&mdash;"Yes, one of the children, to save your face when you visit the
  Rue du Harlay&mdash;your own daughter as a screen!"</p>

  <p>Affecting not to hear this the Duke replied:</p>

  <p>"I want to take Isabelle to the dentist, she has been complaining of
  toothache&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I could take her&mdash;one night in Paris would suffice for that."</p>

  <p>"If you wish. But I have affairs to attend to in Paris&mdash;there is no
  need for you to accompany me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I, too, have affairs," replied Fanny du Boccage with that total lack of
  subterfuge that he found so galling. "If you work to keep Lucille Debelleyme
  in Paris I must work to see that she leaves."</p>

  <p>"You are foolish to torment yourself with these suspicions."</p>

  <p>"Camille, pray do not try to deceive me by this miserable strategy! I can
  believe nothing that you say. Once you were candour itself, now I detect you
  in lie after lie, evasion after evasion&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And whose fault is that?" he muttered, turning away, then, harshly, "I am
  returning to Paris and I shall take Isabelle."</p>

  <p>"I, then, shall accompany you. I do not like this place&mdash;this
  senseless extravagance, this stupid luxury&mdash;no. I cannot be left
  here&mdash;but neither can I remain in Paris. We will go on to Dieppe."</p>

  <p>"Is it possible you wish to return there?"</p>

  <p>"Why not?" but she shivered as she recalled the dull pallor of the Villa
  Violette, the monotony of that veiled sea. "We will find another house. I
  shall not stay in Paris while Lucille Debelleyme is in Paris. Remember,
  Camille, I have my friends, my protectors now."</p>

  <p>Feeling the lack of air, for the evening was stifling, she hastened out of
  the half-furnished apartment and walked slowly up and down the wide white
  stone terrace. The massive shape of the ornate building, covered in part by
  scaffolding, showed heavy against the luminous sky; the trees were
  motionless, no wind stirred the grass. Madame du Boccage, walking heavily,
  paced up and down the cracked paving-stones. She rejoiced in the increasing
  symptoms of her illness, her shortness of breath, the pain in her side,
  giddiness, a dimming of the sight; she hoped she would die soon, surely it
  would not take the outraged heart much longer to wear out the failing
  body?</p>

  <p>Her husband appeared at the long, open, uncurtained window behind her, and
  stood for a moment, his hands on the window frame, looking about him at the
  red evening sky; the reflection of this glow was on his face and hair
  touching his intense pallor. His wife, pausing near him, scrutinised him
  painfully.</p>

  <p>He was a stranger and not in the least like the man she had married, yet
  always the man she loved. He wore a riding suit, costly, negligent; he had
  been directing the workmen who, under the supervision of an architect, were
  decorating the chapel, his high boots were covered with white dust and
  stained by liquid plaster, there was clay on his hands. He seemed to be at
  one with the enormous empty chateau, the sombre uninhabited landscape and on
  his handsome face was that blank look which the Duchess had noticed, with an
  inexplicable sense of terror, when he had stared at the heavy baldaquin of
  her bed in the Faubourg St. Honoré. It was as if, she thought, his spirit was
  utterly estranged from all about him; terrified of that immobile stare, she
  crossed to the window and asked him in a low voice to give her his arm as she
  was tired.</p>

  <p>He did so without a word, she leant on him heavily as he fell in step with
  her along the terrace. She was acutely conscious of the difference in their
  appearance, he in the full comeliness of his manhood and she, exhausted, worn
  in soul and body without either strength or charm.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, she said with an utter, a hopeless sincerity, "Camille, is it
  too late even now? This misery&mdash;it seems as if it cannot be
  true&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Are you not satisfied even yet? What have you to complain of? You have
  had your own way. The governess has gone."</p>

  <p>"Only her bodily presence, I think, Camille. How harshly you speak! Surely
  you know what I mean&mdash;it is this estrangement that is killing
  me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I gave way. I can do no more."</p>

  <p>"Camille," she hung heavily on his arm, she gazed up at him earnestly, "it
  was for your sake and for that of the children that she had to go&mdash;not
  for mine. I am so used to unhappiness&mdash;but everyone said you were
  wrong&mdash;that it could not be&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, everyone, eh?" she felt his arm tremble under her clasp. "Well, she
  has gone and everyone should be satisfied."</p>

  <p>He spoke with such cold hostility that she had not the heart to reply; as
  they reached the end of the terrace where low steps led to the lawns, he
  asked abruptly:</p>

  <p>"Would you not care to see the funeral vaults under the chapel? They have
  been working on them to-day."</p>

  <p>"No, I should not care to, Camille."</p>

  <p>"Why? It is really a superb Gothic design, excellently carried out."</p>

  <p>She shook her head; she was aware that she was wrong in showing no
  interest in the work which so absorbed him, but she could not bring herself
  to play a part, to assume any aspect of happiness.</p>

  <p>"You will not come?" he insisted.</p>

  <p>He paused; she loosened her arm from his and stood apart from him; she
  wore a light muslin dress, the sunset dyed it a pale scarlet.</p>

  <p>"Why should I?" she sighed, "in a short while I shall be there for
  ever."</p>

  <p>She spoke with complete sincerity, but these were exactly those words of
  melodrama that he most detested.</p>

  <p>"As you please," he replied with that ironic coldness she found more hard
  to bear than his worst rages, and leaving her standing alone on the great
  expanse of the terrace he turned towards the chapel, walking slowly and
  looking at his hands from which he pulled fragments of dried plaster.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch41"
     name="ch41">CHAPTER XLI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">M. du Boccage called on Mademoiselle Debelleyme at the Rue
  du Harlay. The servant, her eyes lively with curiosity, gave his message to
  Lucille Debelleyme; descending the narrow stairs she had to pass Madame Trou
  whose broad face expressed an hostile curiosity, but the governess slipped
  past, keeping her eyes lowered. She was watched and suspected even here.</p>

  <p>"What does it matter? He has come! There was, then, behind the banal words
  of his letters&mdash;something. Friendship? Passion? Interest at least. He
  has come."</p>

  <p>M. du Boccage waited in the parlour reserved for interviewing parents; it
  was full of the greasy smell of cooking; he walked up and down impatiently,
  his handkerchief to his nostrils, and his two little girls, Isabelle and
  Cesarine, danced about with excitement on the worn Empire horse-hair
  couch.</p>

  <p>The embarrassment of this meeting was dispelled by the children's joyous
  welcome of their governess; while they clung to her with exclamations of
  pleasure and love, she looked over their blonde heads at their father.</p>

  <p>He had not said a word beyond some murmur when she had entered but, as
  usual, their eyes told each other everything.</p>

  <p>Greedily they stared; how necessary they were, one to the other; this
  separation (so foolish for their enemies to insist on that) had only shown
  them the vital need they had one for the other, and how empty, how impossible
  were days spent apart.</p>

  <p>After the gloomy, lonely miseries of the Rue du Harlay, the presence of M.
  du Boccage seemed, to the governess, to transform the world.</p>

  <p>They exchanged a few commonplaces, always looking at each other, while she
  spoke to the children the words that she meant him to hear; of her suffering,
  of her ill-health (did she not appear pale and thin?), how she missed Javiaux
  du Boccage and their company, the dullness, the stupidity, of the people with
  whom she was surrounded, of her half thoughts of marriage with an old man she
  detested. "I must somehow put an end... "</p>

  <p>She broke off, having never taken her vivid glance from his face, she felt
  that the man was trembling, overwhelmed, she knew his violent jealousy was
  aroused, darkness flickered in his eyes as he stammered out his
  banalities.</p>

  <p>Madame Trou knocked at the door, then immediately opened it. Her plain
  face was hard and ugly with suspicion; "Would Mademoiselle's visitor detain
  her much-longer? One of the pupils wished for her music lesson, the hour was
  already passed."</p>

  <p>Lucille Debelleyme was not sorry that the Duke should see this instance of
  the tyranny under which she lived; as the door closed on the figure of the
  Swiss woman she murmured: "It is killing me to live here." Then with rising
  agony not feigned: "I shall die in this disgusting place."</p>

  <p>She glanced at the children, making an effort to control herself; how was
  she to speak to him alone? What was he going to arrange or to do? She began,
  contrary to her nature, to be impatient.</p>

  <p>He owed her something, too, for what length of time must she endure this?
  Had he no device whereby they could at least have half an hour alone?</p>

  <p>The Duke, aroused by the appeal in her brilliant eyes told the children to
  go to the carriage and fetch the basket of fruit and flowers that they had
  brought up from Javiaux du Boccage for Mademoiselle.</p>

  <p>As the little girls ran out and the door closed after them, she turned to
  him instantly; she did not trust him, was not sure if he knew how to make the
  best of this snatched moment.</p>

  <p>"Well?" she demanded, "what are you going to do? I'm trapped and
  helpless."</p>

  <p>She approached him, risking the torment of another embrace; there was so
  much she must risk.</p>

  <p>"What did you mean when you said to me&mdash;On the seashore at Corsica,
  'is this love or something more?'"</p>

  <p>"You know."</p>

  <p>"Yes. But is it in good hands&mdash;our mutual fortunes?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Mon Dieu!"</p>

  <p>"We are both of us in torment, is there no way out?"</p>

  <p>He was silent and she with her whole urgent presence goaded him, harassed
  as he was, to think of some device, some expedient; yet, contemptuous as she
  usually was towards all hesitations and falterings, she did not blame this
  man, for she loved him.</p>

  <p>"Can we not meet somewhere?" she whispered, "without the children? You and
  I, not as governess and employer&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"As what then?"</p>

  <p>"You must tell me that&mdash;as anything you please. This has gone far
  enough, has it not?"</p>

  <p>"I have always respected you&mdash;I would not offer you the least
  affront," but his eyes contradicted the words, he had always an air, as she
  well knew, of saying what he did not mean, of entrenching himself behind
  half-inarticulate conventionalities.</p>

  <p>She replied in a lowered voice for she feared a spy at the door.</p>

  <p>"Can you bear it? I cannot&mdash;tell me where I shall come."</p>

  <p>He said, "Do you know the chemist and perfumer's at the corner of the Rue
  Keller? To-morrow at six."</p>

  <p>He took a key from his pocket and placed it on the table, not daring to
  touch her hand, indeed she shrank back for fear he should do so. "There is a
  side door and you go up one flight of stairs; it was taken in the name of Luc
  Raby."</p>

  <p>Lucille Debelleyme remembered instantly, vividly, the phrases in the
  Duchess' letter: "those little rooms you are known to hire&mdash;I do not
  believe they are for your sole use." This, then, was one of them; he was
  putting her on a level with those other, obscure rivals; as indeed she had
  asked him to do.</p>

  <p>She put the key in her beaded reticule: "This is because there is no other
  way."</p>

  <p>"Can you suggest anything else?"</p>

  <p>They already heard the eager feet of the children outside. "No, nothing.
  Only this&mdash;you did well to respect me. I have as much virtue as I ever
  professed to have...."</p>

  <p>"I know. You'll come?"</p>

  <p>"You've thought of me, you've missed me?"</p>

  <p>"God knows," he whispered with violence, "how much!" The laughing children
  entered the room bearing between them a huge basket laden with exotic fruits
  and flowers, rare, costly; as they placed this rich trophy of the summer
  before Mademoiselle Debelleyme she whispered between her exclamations of joy
  at dusky grapes, soft peaches, red-stained nectarines, the last roses and
  striped dahlias, cast in this sudden profusion into her miserable privation:
  "I shall be there."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch42"
     name="ch42">CHAPTER XLII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It was not difficult for Madame du Boccage to learn what she
  regarded as this new outrage on the part of her husband. The innocent chatter
  of the children themselves before their nurses, the nurses' repetition to
  Matilde and Matilde's instant bearing of the news to her mistress was the
  matter of an hour or so. "A visit to the dentist indeed! But first they had
  gone to the Rue du Harlay... "</p>

  <p>The Duchess consulted with the Abbé Galle, with her lawyer, Maitre Cottin;
  although death was in her soul she was still resolved, for her children's
  sake, not to give in. What would their fate be if they fell powerless into
  the hands of this other woman?</p>

  <p>She was advised to insist on an instant departure for Dieppe, and the Abbé
  Galle undertook to immediately dislodge the governess from the Rue du Harlay.
  He would bring pressure to bear on Madame Trou and force her to demand from
  her new teacher a certificate of good behaviour recently written and signed
  from Madame du Boccage. Madame Trou could say with truth that scandalous
  rumours had begun to reach her ears, indeed had been confirmed by the visit
  to M. du. Boccage to his one-time governess the very day he had arrived in
  Paris, glossed over by the presence of the children, no doubt, but a glaring
  piece of indiscretion none the less.</p>

  <p>She could, therefore, with propriety demand this new certificate of good
  character. Madame du Boccage would, of course, refuse it, the governess would
  be expelled from the Rue du Harlay and ruined, penniless, without a good
  name, would have nowhere to go; she would then be reduced, so the astute Abbé
  argued, to accept the generous charity of her enemies, take a handsome
  pension and some more excellent testimonials and return to England.</p>

  <p>Madame du Boccage hesitated a little before employing these methods, which
  savoured of brutality, but she had resigned herself to the guidance of her
  advisers, and a few hours after the Duke's visit to the Rue du Harlay the
  Abbé waited on Madame Trou; he found that woman, who disliked Lucille
  Debelleyme, ready to espouse the cause of justice and to preserve the
  respectability of her dreary establishment as well as eager to please a great
  lady of such influence as the Duchesse du Boccage.</p>

  <p>That same evening she told Lucille Debelleyme what had occurred: "I must
  have this certificate of character, Mademoiselle. If you are on the good
  terms you say you are with Madame du Boccage then there will be no difficulty
  in obtaining it&mdash;if there is any difficulty in obtaining it I cannot
  keep you here&mdash;I have my reputation to think of. I live a very retired
  life and I had not heard of all these scandalous rumours when I engaged you.
  I cannot have the parents of my charges objecting to the character of the
  young person whom I employ to instruct them."</p>

  <p>Lucille Debelleyme's heart swelled with hatred against this woman, against
  all the horde of women, respectable, spiteful, virtuous, whom she
  represented.</p>

  <p>"You shall have your certificate of good character, Madame. I will secure
  it for you to-morrow."</p>

  <p>The woman was silent at this bold front and left her with a cold glance of
  enmity; Lucille Debelleyme's rage exploded in a burst of rare laughter that
  startled the other, who paused on the stairs to listen.</p>

  <p>"A certificate of virtue from Fanny du Boccage!"</p>

  <p>The governess laughed to think that she was really as 'virtuous' as she
  said she was&mdash;who would believe that?&mdash;perhaps, after to-morrow
  night, it might not be true.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch43"
     name="ch43">CHAPTER XLIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Lucille Debelleyme passed rapidly through the streets on her
  way to the Rue Keller, the heat was suffocating and it seemed to her excited
  imagination that there was unrest everywhere. Outside the shops, the clubs,
  the cafes, groups of people disputed and surged; placards seemed to be
  everywhere; the air was full of murmurs of discontent and disdain for M.
  Guizot, for his master.</p>

  <p>The evening papers that were being eagerly bought and read were full of
  scandals about the ruling classes. A general had been found guilty of
  corruption, a minister of intrigues, a lunatic prince had murdered his
  mistress... the first two had been punished, no doubt, the third sent to an
  asylum, but people would not forget; these scandals fermented in the masses,
  and the whole structure of the Orleans monarchy which had risen out of the
  tumult of the famous Three Days was steadily shaken by the increasing menace
  of popular scorn.</p>

  <p>The governess had difficulty in finding the Rue Keller as it was in a
  quarter unknown to her. She took an omnibus for she felt strangely fatigued;
  the man who was sitting next to her had one of the evening sheets on his
  knee; she could not avoid seeing the headlines of an inflammatory political
  article, and on another column the word&mdash;again and
  again&mdash;'murder.'</p>

  <p>She had never dwelt on murder nor indeed any crime before, she had always
  relegated it into that part of life which she knew existed but with which she
  was never faced. Now in her disturbed, distracted state, an odd sickening
  curiosity crept into her mind... People of her own class, people of a class
  higher than her own, did commit murder. Why? Deeds of violence were, to her,
  incredibly stupid, an underground method was the only way, she was sure, of
  attaining one's end. She did not reflect that while it is the savage, the
  stupid, who commit murders, it is often the subtle and the fastidious who
  instigate them.</p>

  <p>Her companion, who smelt of garlic, put a spotted red foulard over his
  face to keep off the flies and the newspaper slipped off his knee to the
  floor of the bus, so that the word 'Murder' was under the feet of Lucille
  Debelleyme.</p>

  <p>It was so hot in the omnibus. A fat woman entered with two plucked fowls
  in a handkerchief; dangling over her legs and her cotton skirt were their
  heads; on which hung the withered flesh of the combs and wattles, and long
  red feathers; drops of blood and water dripped from the ends of their yellow
  beaks. Passers-by hailed the omnibus, which stopped reluctantly; steam rose
  from the lean backs of the horses; the conductor took off his shapeless cap,
  mopped his bald head and pulled from his pocket a sensational paper-backed
  romance which he read as the vehicle jerked over the cobbles. Torn placards,
  on houses, hoardings and kiosks announced old plays: La Kerne Margot by
  Alexandre Dumas, Haydee by Scribe and Auber&mdash;summer fêtes, the 'Chateau
  des Fleurs' at the Arc-de-Triomphe with comic songs, games, Bengal
  lights&mdash;one franc entrance. The print shops showed metal caricatures of
  Teste and Cubieres, who had brought such infamy on the government, and
  reproductions of a popular painting that, in crude satire, showed the Paris
  of 1847 under the likeness of the Rome of Tiberius; everywhere could be
  sensed a public unrest, a malaise, a nervous disquiet.</p>

  <p>"Or am I wrong? Is it only in myself, this uneasiness?"</p>

  <p>She got out of the jolting omnibus at the corner of a small cobbled street
  and, following the conductor's direction, found the Rue Keller. There was the
  chemist's shop with the strong August sunshine gleaming across the huge
  purple, crimson and green bottles, with jars of medicines showing through the
  open door. There, at the side, was the little door of which she had the
  key.</p>

  <p>She passed it, and walked away rapidly up the street. She had been
  reminded of the inn at Paddington, the back parlour and the large, bleak,
  cold bedroom where Robert Morrison lay drunk. She was not a woman who could
  easily become used to the peculiar, furtive atmosphere of illicit intrigue.
  It was not the duplicity that shocked her, but the slur on her pride. She had
  gone up to Robert Morrison's hired bedchamber because he represented (she had
  thought) her only chance of escape from an insupportable situation; she
  turned back now because of the urge of a similar desperation, and took the
  key out of her purse. Events had so narrowed down her sphere of action that
  there was only this left to do; a complete resignation, a complete
  abnegation, she could not contemplate.</p>

  <p>The stairs were dark, already lit by a small jet of gas which showed
  another door at the top, that of the apartment which was marked with the
  assumed name the Duke had given her. She turned the key and entered, closing
  the door carefully behind her, holding her breath, stepping even more lightly
  than usual.</p>

  <p>He was not there; she sat down at a table covered with a long chenille
  cloth in the centre of the room, and peered round, pale with an increasing
  rage against her destiny. Her hand had been forced, she was doing the thing
  that she had above all things not wished to do, throwing away the fruits of
  years of self-respect, decorum, of correct behaviour. If she was discovered,
  and she believed that, spied upon as she was, she would certainly be
  discovered, she would be openly revealed as the wanton that her enemies had
  for the last two years de-dared her to be. She would have lost that nominal
  innocence which was her chief asset. The need she had of the man whom she had
  come to meet waged with her disgust that he could have found nothing better
  for her than this.</p>

  <p>The room was hidden away at the back of the small house and looked on a
  blank wall, the sun, though still powerful, was completely shut away and
  twilight fell over the small apartment where she waited. She endeavoured to
  divert herself (nor was this so difficult as her curiosity was avid) by
  noticing every detail of her surroundings. All was in his taste, she could
  see that at once; nothing much modern&mdash;all frivolous with decor of the
  Regency, no touch of the present century. Her gaze concentrated on the long
  couch with gold-scrolled back, set in the wall behind looped draperies,
  covered with silk pillows and cashmere shawls.</p>

  <p>Who was that woman for whom he had furnished the room, and how often had
  he entertained her or others? The governess locked her hands under her chin;
  supposing he did not come? She had always found it so agreeable to realise
  that he was like herself, so capable of getting his end by plot and plan, by
  underground intrigues. But this worked against herself now, she could not be
  quite sure of him, even though she believed that his feeling for her was
  genuine. After all, he had never committed himself to her save by half-looks,
  half-words. Their behaviour had always been of complete outward
  discretion.</p>

  <p>"He does not give a woman much to build on and what, after all, can I be
  to him compared to all he risks in any further dealings with me?"</p>

  <p>There were some <i>Journal de Modes</i> on the table, <i>Le Follet</i>,
  <i>Le Courier des Dames</i>; she turned over the glossy leaves and became
  discontented with her own gown, not the finest that she had, but the smartest
  in which she had dared leave the Rue du Harlay. For whose diversion had he
  bought these frivolous pictures of ruffled silks, wide laces and frail
  bonnets?</p>

  <p>"Some women know how to get these things without fuss or scandal&mdash;mon
  Dieu! It must have been my virtuous training that set me on the wrong path! A
  man of his wealth&mdash;and what have I had of him? A man of his position and
  he meets me here!"</p>

  <p>Her cupidity, her disappointment clouded her delight in him:</p>

  <p>"Peers of France were not formerly so cautious nor so niggardly, I fear
  that I am born into the wrong century."</p>

  <p>He broke in on her meditation, holding in his hand the fashionable light
  top-hat, that, high and wide, made so many men appear ridiculous, but which
  oddly suited his height and build.</p>

  <p>The governess remained seated and such was her control that not a tinge of
  colour passed over her pale, pensive face; she thought instantly: "this time
  we must really come to a definite understanding, this time we cannot leave it
  vague."</p>

  <p>M. du Boccage put down his hat, gloves and cane, then locked the door;
  they did not speak to each other. He approached the table where she sat
  waiting; she nerved herself to hear what he was going to say and not to be
  jarred at the wrong words he was sure to employ. She was used to interpreting
  his banalities, but sometimes she resented them. Whatever her feelings for
  him, at the present moment they were not strong enough to lift her above
  those minute exasperations; this place where she was forced to meet him, this
  silence, overshadowed the triumph of the fact that he had come...</p>

  <p>At length he said: "Madame du Boccage insists that we all go to Dieppe
  to-morrow. I cannot resist without a further scandal. She harries me day and
  night, I have not a moment's respite."</p>

  <p>How flat an opening for a clandestine love meeting! The picture he evoked
  was touched by absurdity for the governess; a family trip to the
  seaside&mdash;the carriage full of children, the servants busy with luggage,
  the nurses scolding, everything&mdash;now her own touch was lacking&mdash;in
  chaos, and in the midst of these agitated domesticities this elegant young
  man&mdash;this <i>roué manqué</i>. Ah, Camille Pierre Marie du Boccage
  Montlosier had indeed made himself ridiculous by his early marriage; but if
  the thought of Dieppe gave the governess a little amusement, it was obvious
  that it afforded none to the Duke; his sense of humour had for some while
  been in eclipse.</p>

  <p>"I have been driven," he repeated sullenly; "she harries me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes," smiled the governess, "she has harried you here. Monsieur du
  Boccage, harried you and me to this shameful place."</p>

  <p>He glanced at her sharply, askance, and his mouth twitched:</p>

  <p>"I hardly believed you would come."</p>

  <p>She read the words and the look; he was one of those men who held women
  sharply divided into two classes, the chaste and the wanton; having put
  Lucille Debelleyme in the first category, it was profoundly difficult for a
  mind like his to remove her to the second.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I have made this sacrifice," she still continued to smile. She took
  off her bonnet and swung it by the lilac ribbons. "The last sacrifice."</p>

  <p>"It need never be known."</p>

  <p>"But I dare say it will be!" She rose. "Do you not see this is delivering
  us into the hands of our enemies? You say they have driven us here, where
  will they drive us next?"</p>

  <p>He continued to look at her intensely, with an expression, she thought, as
  if he waited for a signal, but she could not think what signal; her
  exasperation grew.</p>

  <p>"So you are to leave Paris to-morrow and I&mdash;what is to become of me?
  Am I to stifle in the Rue du Harlay, if indeed that woman will keep me
  there&mdash;you have not obtained, indeed, you cannot obtain that letter
  which is demanded from your wife?"</p>

  <p>He said under his breath: "she will not give it to me," then, "if you were
  to come yourself to-morrow and ask for it... "</p>

  <p>Lucille Debelleyme interrupted: "It would be a useless humiliation. Do you
  not see it is a trap to get rid of me? But I will not go, I will not leave
  Paris. After all, there are always things one can do."</p>

  <p>"That marriage?" he asked sharply.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps worse than that."</p>

  <p>She began walking up and down the room swinging her bonnet by the lilac
  strings. He sat down at the table in the chair she had just left and dropped
  his head in his hands, his elbows on the piles of magazines.</p>

  <p>His indolent gaiety, his haughty self-assurance so skilfully cloaked by a
  smiling amiability were all gone, she pitied him as he sat in that abject
  attitude. He, wealthy and powerful, with every worldly advantage was as
  cornered, as defeated, as helpless as herself. She bent over him, put her
  hand on his shoulder. He instantly shuddered at her touch.</p>

  <p>"There must be something, you are not going to give in, let them do what
  they will? Have you no authority, are you not master in your own home? Come,
  we are no longer in the relations of master and servant. We can speak clearly
  I hope, plainly, Camille." For the first time she used his name. He glanced
  up quickly with eager expectancy.</p>

  <p>"I have not come here to use evasion, your troubles, your humiliations do
  not come from me. When you begged me to stay, I stayed, though the position
  was almost insupportable. When you asked me to go I went and I made no
  scenes."</p>

  <p>"It is true, it is true; you have been my one friend."</p>

  <p>"I have thought of you like that, too&mdash;my one friend, the only
  creature who has treated me as if I was a human being. You know you have my
  loyalty. I have done what I could."</p>

  <p>She turned aside, her nerves giving way before his immobility, his
  stupefied air.</p>

  <p>"Mon Dieu! I would not be so forced down by circumstances! Are you not
  young, with money and position? With everything most people cut each other's
  throats to get? And do you allow this odious woman&mdash;come, she is odious
  to me and to you also, is she not?"</p>

  <p>As if stimulated by the intense passion in her words he rose to his feet.
  "she is odious to me. I hate her, I have for her a repugnance&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That is enough!" cried the governess. "Free yourself of her, be done with
  it!"</p>

  <p>He did not reply but cast his eyes down while a shudder passed over his
  face as if an unspeakable thought was struggling in his mind; she added
  swiftly: "Why did you ask me to come here to-day?"</p>

  <p>"I had," he answered with difficulty, "to speak with you in private. There
  has always been somebody, the children, servants, spies&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she retorted, "It is very difficult for us to get away from all
  that even here. You seem tongue-tied, stifled&mdash;but what? The weight of
  custom, the legend of my respectability?"</p>

  <p>He said slowly: "I cannot believe in what we are being driven
  to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What we are being driven to, Camille, what do you mean?&mdash;that you
  are forced to ask me to be your mistress?&mdash;well, this is a proper place,
  is it not? I am no longer in charge of your little children nor in the
  services of your virtuous wife, I no longer have to satisfy your friends and
  relations as to my purity and my good behaviour&mdash;I have come at last to
  the position where certificates of virtue and decorum are not required."</p>

  <p>"I do not want you to lose everything through me. I do not like what I do,
  what I am forced to do. I have never asked a woman like you to a place like
  this before."</p>

  <p>Lucille Debelleyme smiled, his code that it hurt him so to surrender,
  mattered very little to her; she had already sacrificed her own.</p>

  <p>With the greatest possible effort, as if all his faculties were fast
  slipping his control, he added: "I find that life without you is awful,
  impossible. You are ill, dying in that hideous Rue du Harlay. I must do
  something, I must alter it."</p>

  <p>"Get me," she said with rising contempt for his slowness, for his
  inaction, "that letter from Madame du Boccage&mdash;send me with a pension to
  England&mdash;then all will be peaceful again. Get rid of me and go your
  way."</p>

  <p>"You know that I cannot."</p>

  <p>"Then what do you intend to do with me?"</p>

  <p>She believed that he was going to ask her to be his secret mistress and
  she believed that she was going to accept his proposal, yet her pride was not
  stung as it had been when Robert Morrison had turned on her and said he had
  no intention of marrying her. She was better schooled now, besides, her
  senses, her emotions were touched; she believed that it would be impossible
  to live without this man...</p>

  <p>She sank down on the couch set in the wall and flung her bonnet on the
  cushion beside her; he turned to stare at her, she was annoyed by the stray
  thought that made her think of the marble mask of the cupidon in the salon of
  the Faubourg St. Honoré, for he had that same strange expression, a smile
  that might pass as gaiety but on a closer inspection seemed a grimace of
  unutterable desolation.</p>

  <p>"Life is blank without you. I never thought this would happen to me, to be
  so entangled and trapped."</p>

  <p>"Cut free," breathed the governess, leaning towards him.</p>

  <p>"I must think of my name, of my family, my children."</p>

  <p>"And must you not," she asked, leaning further forward, "a little think of
  me?"</p>

  <p>She rose impulsively, throwing aside her long, patient restraint, as if
  she unbuttoned a cloak and cast it down.</p>

  <p>"I have always restrained myself, Camille. I thought you had enough to
  endure from that other woman, and I have been forced to earn my livelihood
  for many years so am not able to indulge in emotionalism, but I too could
  weep and pray, I too could point to my wrongs and sufferings, I too could ask
  you to take pity on me, to contemplate what my life has been! I am a woman
  after all, not a machine. I am, too, what you think of as a good woman."</p>

  <p>"Do you love me?" he asked, his voice was hoarse and his tone flat, she
  saw that he was at the end of all subterfuge as she was herself; they dropped
  all the tricks of the elaborate game that they had played so long.</p>

  <p>"I love you. You are, in every way, my only hope and love. Is it that? I
  don't know&mdash;perhaps, as you said, something more."</p>

  <p>He approached her and unsteadily sank on his knees beside the couch and
  put his head and his arms on the pillows beside her, in the relaxed attitude
  of a tired child. She saw his shoulders heave under the fine cloth and though
  she could hear nothing she thought that he sobbed, and she sat silent, not
  intruding on his grief by a gesture. The light was failing in the small,
  overcrowded room&mdash;she had been there longer than she knew; with the
  setting of the sun the heat seemed to increase; all the fumes of a summer day
  in the city began to assail them. She began to count the hours they had
  before them, how long might they in safety stay there... the habit of
  calculation was so strong with her that she could not forget it, even in this
  moment of genuine emotion. She touched his shoulder. "Camille, we are both
  very wretched. Do not lose heart&mdash;there must be a way out."</p>

  <p>He lifted his head to look at her, his hair had fallen over his eyes,
  which strangely altered his appearance.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'll find a way. Will you stay with me here to-hight? All the
  night?"</p>

  <p>Her answer came in a whisper: "I dare not, we are spied on, you know, do
  not forget that. If I am not at the Rue du Harlay at least to sleep, the
  worst will be suspected."</p>

  <p>"Stay with me to-night."</p>

  <p>Twice she had knelt at is feet; it was curious to see him kneeling.
  Detached from his usual surroundings, his usual manners, his personality
  changed; this fascinated her, for she had thought, with the self-confidence
  of a clever woman, that she had known him through and through; she recalled
  her mistake with Robert Morrison. The Duke had not been weeping; his eyes
  were clear, his complexion pale, why then had he hidden his face? To conceal
  what emotion?</p>

  <p>She got to her feet and moved away: "I saw you had something here to make
  coffee. I feel so thirsty, my throat quite parched. The gas, too, shall I not
  light it? It is getting so dark,"</p>

  <p>"And hot too," he complained, rising quickly, "suffocating."</p>

  <p>With what seemed a frantic gesture he threw off his blue coat. It fell on
  the ground at her feet, she stooped to pick it up, he prevented her, their
  hands met.</p>

  <p>"What is this in the pocket? You have had a bottle in the pocket, I think
  it is broken." Her fingers closed on a small phial which had struck the
  floor. He instantly took it from her and returned it to the coat pocket.</p>

  <p>"It is laudanum&mdash;I found it in the room of Madame du Boccage. It is
  safer for me to have it."</p>

  <p>"Ah yes&mdash;safer," murmured the governess. He dropped the coat on the
  couch; she noticed he had twisted several times round his waist, a thin,
  green cord; he saw her look and explained: "that also I found it in her
  room."</p>

  <p>"You think she contemplates suicide?"</p>

  <p>"Who knows? I have been thinking, too, of the baldaquin of her
  bed&mdash;since you spoke of it&mdash;it is dangerous, I must have the
  workmen in to make it more secure."</p>

  <p>They looked at each other through the gloom, she put her hand out as if
  she tried to move a veil between them. "If such a thing should happen," she
  sighed. "What a frightful thought! But our only hope is in some such
  accident."</p>

  <p>As if to efface the impression of these words she suddenly cast herself
  into his arms in an abandonment of self-pity, of desire, of affection. His
  embrace was so powerful that it was difficult for her to draw breath through
  her slender body, his kisses and tears on her face left her in no doubt as to
  the emotion she had roused in this man. In broken inarticulate cries, he
  breathed his passionate desire for her, his furious hatred for their mutual
  enemy, his agony at seeing her wilt and fade in the Rue du Harlay, his horror
  at the thought of the marriage with which she had tormented him, his disgust,
  his fury at spies, the whole world&mdash;he and she only&mdash;</p>

  <p>For a moment her desperately aroused emotion overwhelmed her intellect,
  she could think of nothing except that she was in his embrace&mdash;but for a
  moment only. Even then her pride and her ambition took over, she began to
  plan and calculate&mdash;to think: "This is the climax, what I cannot get now
  I shall never get. It is my last, my only chance. Why should I not have from
  him everything a woman may have?"</p>

  <p>She was lost for a second only. Then she caught at her senses, her
  intellect, and extricated herself even at that moment, from his intense
  desire, and her intense wish to accept it in the fullest. As he continued to
  murmur with his lips on her bare neck what he would do for her, what he would
  give her, she wrenched herself away, disordered, distracted as she was:</p>

  <p>"Why not then everything? I am not to be had this way after all... "
  Expressing the very height of a frenzy, long-suppressed ambition, she said:
  "A separation&mdash;a divorce&mdash;marriage with me&mdash;why not? It has
  been done before and if I'm so much to you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>By his instant withdrawal from her she at once realised that this had been
  in his mind too. She was not asking a higher price for herself than he had
  already in his mind put on her; yet she wondered if this could be done, if
  they could now, possibly, leave each other; it was as hard to fight herself
  as it was to fight him... but the prize was surely worth it&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I cannot think," she whispered, "really, my mind does not work&mdash;have
  I asked too much?"</p>

  <p>"No more than you deserve," he was gripping the back of the chair by the
  table; when had she seen him do that before and why did she want to know? Ah,
  that first day that she had seen him in the Hotel du Boccage&mdash;she must
  control these wandering thoughts.</p>

  <p>"You think that? Why not do it&mdash;for me?"</p>

  <p>"You want it? More than anything? More than the night&mdash;we might have
  together here?"</p>

  <p>The way of ambition was also the way of honour; she with instinctive skill
  took advantage of that.</p>

  <p>"You would think less of me&mdash;you are not the man to love where you
  despise. I want your love."</p>

  <p>He did not move, she thought the gilt chair would break in his formidable
  grip; his face was flushed, his hair was tumbled over his eyes. She was
  frightened by the part she played, but she would not give way; her mood was
  not the mood of melting romance in which she had set ajar her door in the
  Palazzo Frediani. She was defeated now, with nothing to lose but that nominal
  innocence that the world valued so highly, that secretly she valued so highly
  herself&mdash;"to become his harlot is to give his wife the final
  triumph&mdash;why should I? Yet how resist? I was mad to come."</p>

  <p>She found a candle on a porcelain gueridon by the window and lit it, as if
  there was protection in the small light.</p>

  <p>"The letter," she stammered, with her back to him. "I want that
  letter&mdash;make her write it&mdash;I am as virtuous as she is&mdash;she
  owes me that letter&mdash;I want to publish it before all Paris&mdash;" she
  heard him come up behind her; she stared into the little flame melting the
  hard wax; she forced herself to repeat:</p>

  <p>"The letter&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Is that more to you then staying here with me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>He put his arms round her and pulled open her thin summer bodice; she felt
  his flesh warm through the linen shirt, she leant her head back so that it
  rested under his chin; it seemed to her that his grasp was strong enough to
  tear her heart out with one movement, but what she whispered, her lips near
  his was:</p>

  <p>"Get that letter from your wife&mdash;divorce her&mdash;separate from
  her&mdash;what you will&mdash;then come back to me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Lucille&mdash;you cannot&mdash;make terms, now."</p>

  <p>Half naked as she was, she drew away with a pride that overwhelmed his
  strength.</p>

  <p>"I'm not a harlot. I will not be&mdash;some day she would know&mdash;and
  you would be ashamed."</p>

  <p>She frantically searched his face for an answer to this&mdash;some lovers
  could have persuaded her, even then, that pride, ambition and honour were as
  nothing compared to love&mdash;but not this man. The baffled anger in his
  eyes, the quiver of his mouth, his half-recoil told that he would be
  ashamed&mdash;that he was ashamed now.</p>

  <p>She loosened his slackened fingers from her bare breast.</p>

  <p>"I will not do it."</p>

  <p>She took his hand and held it with her own above the now flaring flame of
  the candle so that fire stung their flesh. He winced, then in silence
  shuddered back into his self-control. She wondered if she had gone too far,
  denied him and herself too violently, if her sacrifice and his was for
  nothing.</p>

  <p>She buttoned up her bodice, turned away, pulled her bonnet from the couch,
  swinging it mechanically by the pale, lilac strings.</p>

  <p>What she had set herself was almost beyond her; she put her bonnet on and
  tied the ribbons under her chin in an attempt to steady her nervous, rising
  hysteria by movement.</p>

  <p>"Tell your wife to give me that letter."</p>

  <p>"Come to the Faubourg St. Honoré to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"Very well, I will be there. I shall expect the letter&mdash;and from
  you&mdash;some action&mdash;"</p>

  <p>As he put on his coat, as it in a stupor, she stared again at the green
  cord twisted round his braces, under the pique waistcoat; she thought of the
  bottle of laudanum in his pocket. Why had he not allowed his wife to use it?
  The image of the heavy baldaquin came before her mind&mdash;she would not
  give way, yet she grasped the edge of the table to support herself and was
  half regretful that he had not forced her, made an end of this torment of
  virtue it cost so much to keep. Her own mood was so distraught that she could
  not for once clearly understand his point of view; was he not too silent, had
  he not given away too soon? It was the first time since she had known him
  intimately that she was not aware of what he was feeling or thinking; only
  through the haze of her own emotion she sensed that the man was frantic.</p>

  <p>He picked up his hat and gloves, put them down and picked them up
  again.</p>

  <p>"To-morrow, then," he repeated several times, "to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"If you care enough," she whispered, still holding on to the table.</p>

  <p>"You shall see how much I care."</p>

  <p>He tried to leave the room, forgetting that he had locked the door, then
  he fumbled several times with the wrong key; all the while he struggled for
  escape she did not speak nor look at him.</p>

  <p>Then he was gone, the door slammed after him and she sprang into instant
  action which seemed without her own volition.</p>

  <p>"It is madness to deny such a moment&mdash;such a man&mdash;and
  myself&mdash;I cannot do it&mdash;what does anything matter? If only he
  stays&mdash;Camille, Camille, return!"</p>

  <p>She did not know if she spoke or thought these frantic phrases; she dashed
  out the candle with her blistered hand, snatched up her cloak and bag
  (prudent even then) and ran from the darkening room, down the stairs into the
  twilit street. The gas was flaring in the chemist's shop and the bright jets
  sent the reflections of the monstrous brilliant bottles of vivid water in
  patches of red and purple and green on the dirty pavement. She looked up and
  down the street, she could see him, not far away yet, walking unsteadily, his
  hat in his hand. The hot gloom of evening made his pale clothes and blond
  hair appear ash-like, as if he was a figure without substance.</p>

  <p>Too late.</p>

  <p>"What have I done? What will he do?"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch44"
     name="ch44">CHAPTER XLIV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Lucille Debelleyme thought: "This is going to be the most
  difficult night of my life, I wonder how I shall live through it." She had
  returned to the Rue du Hanay decorously early, decorously attired. Madame
  Trou had been in the corridor as if waiting for her and gave her a suspicious
  look.</p>

  <p>"You have the letter for which I asked you, Mademoiselle?" she demanded in
  her thick, ugly French.</p>

  <p>"I shall have it to-morrow," replied the governess quietly. She marvelled
  at the power of her own self-control, she certainly owed something to her
  long and bitter training. "To-morrow, in the afternoon, I am calling on
  Madame la Duchesse du Boccage in the Faubourg St. Honoré. She is herself
  personally giving me this letter."</p>

  <p>"I cannot wait longer than to-morrow, Mademoiselle. As I have explained to
  you before, if I had had any idea of the state of the case I should not have
  taken you in."</p>

  <p>Mademoiselle Debelleyme merely smiled at this insolence. She went
  carefully up the dingy stairway with the worn drugget, holding her gown off
  her elegant feet; she looked back over her shoulder at the scowling,
  suspicious Swiss woman as she repeated:</p>

  <p>"To-morrow, Madame, to-morrow."</p>

  <p>Her tiny room, cramped and dirty as it was, was a refuge. She could not
  hope to sleep but she could hope to indulge in the agony of her insomnia
  alone, unspied on for a few hours at least.</p>

  <p>Taking off only her bonnet and gloves she knelt by the bed and pulled the
  pillows, covered in cool coarse linen, under her hot face, turning them in
  search of further coolness as they became heated from her flesh.</p>

  <p>The long night was very close. She had the sash windows open as wide as
  possible, top and bottom; the air that entered was stale, tainted and brought
  no relief.</p>

  <p>When the full moon came up behind the black masses of the houses it seemed
  to give no light.</p>

  <p>"I've gone too far, I should not have denied him. I have injured myself
  and him. I cannot go on like this for ever. I asked too much, he will not be
  able to give it."</p>

  <p>Was it possible that she had refused the greatest delight ever offered her
  because of ambition and pride? Her aching loneliness was almost
  insupportable. Perhaps the other woman would master him after all, she and
  her formidable allies... Perhaps he would leave for Dieppe on the morrow and
  she would never see him again.</p>

  <p>It was likely enough she would never receive the letter that was to
  restore her character and she might be turned with ignominy from the doors of
  Madame Trou; worse, when she went to the Faubourg St. Honoré to-morrow it
  might be to once again see the gates closed.</p>

  <p>Such awful dread and misery possessed her that she had difficulty to keep
  from crying aloud.</p>

  <p>When as the hot night sank into the first coppery glow of day she heard a
  noise outside, she sprang to her door, filled by she knew not what
  apprehension.</p>

  <p>One of the girls was outside, a dying nightlight in her hand, her plain
  face livid, her greasy hair falling in a plait over her flannel
  dressing-gown.</p>

  <p>"I feel sick. Mademoiselle, I couldn't sleep it was so hot, the smells
  from the streets, and the noises," and her eyes widened with surprise to see
  the governess was fully dressed.</p>

  <p>"I also," said Mademoiselle Debelleyme in her careful tone, "found it
  difficult to sleep, that is why I am dressed so early." She returned to her
  room, but through the thin wall she could hear the girl retching. How long
  must she stay here, how long could she possibly endure to stay here? It was
  not likely he would sleep either; perhaps, already, he was preparing himself
  for that interview with his wife in which he would tell her that she must
  give the certificate of good character that would keep her enemy in Paris, or
  even that he wished for a divorce, a separation, the first step to putting
  her rival in her place?&mdash;Lucille, Madame la Duchesse du Boccage...</p>

  <p>"Am I mad to have thought of such a thing? Have I lost all in asking too
  much? A few stolen interviews in the Rue Keller were better than
  nothing."</p>

  <p>The dawn strengthened, showing in detail all the squalor of the room. The
  noises of the street began, the rattle of a wagon, the cry of a hawker. It
  was nearly daylight over Paris, the beggar's instruments squealed out a
  polka, the tune floated across the narrow yard on to which her window looked
  and brought her to her knees again with her fingers in her ears, not daring
  to recall that moment of enchantment by the sea, in Corsica. Her blistered
  finger hurt as it pressed against her cheek; she had not before noticed that
  wound.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch45"
     name="ch45">CHAPTER XLV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">All that morning there was no message, no sign, but after
  all had she expected or he promised any? She must wait until the afternoon,
  when she would call on the Duchess and demand the letter; he would be there
  of course; what had been her last words to him?&mdash;"I expect of
  you&mdash;some action."</p>

  <p>She drank a great deal of coffee but could eat no food. The fruit and
  flowers from Javiaux du Boccage flaunted in the dingy dining-room; Madame
  Trou looked askance at the extravagant present, but ate greedily the grapes
  and peaches. Mademoiselle Debelleyme gave a music lesson to two of the girls,
  while the third, who had been taken ill in the night, lay on the
  mohair-covered sofa, groaning now and then with nausea.</p>

  <p>Madame Trou had insisted that the two girls should learn the fashionable
  La Belle Helene polka. As they played it one after the other, again and
  again, stumbling over the notes, the governess, leaning against the tall
  pianoforte with the drawn red-silk front, thought: "This is torture, this is
  what people mean by acute torture. It is curious how one keeps using words
  without knowing what they really mean&mdash;but now I know what is meant by
  torture."</p>

  <p>At the unpleasant meal in the gloomy little dining-room, where no one, for
  the languor induced by the heat, could eat the food, Madame Trou again
  reminded her assistant of the necessity for the letter from Madame du
  Boccage.</p>

  <p>"I am going this afternoon to fetch it."</p>

  <p>She dressed herself with great care for this interview; Madame du Boccage
  should not think that she was any less sure of herself. She would risk the
  disapproval of Madame Trou, for, surely, she must, somehow, soon escape from
  the Rue du Harlay. She selected a pale-grey cashmere dress trimmed with a
  <i>soutache</i> of white braid: for bonnet?&mdash;that with the taffeta
  frills and the lilac ribbons she had worn yesterday&mdash;she had nothing
  prettier.</p>

  <p>As she tied the strings she remembered that she had left behind the key of
  the apartment in the Rue Keller, one of her mistakes; it would have been
  pleasant to have had it in her pocket when she confronted Fanny du
  Boccage.</p>

  <p>His face was so constantly before her mind that she paused to stare at it
  as if he really stood there; how different he looked with his hair fallen
  over his eyes&mdash;peculiar, light coloured hair like a Northerner. How
  unattractive she had at first found that excessive fairness; she marked every
  detail of that imagined countenance, the slight fullness under the chin, the
  slight weariness of the face, the lines under the eyes that showed complete
  maturity...</p>

  <p>"I shall expect of you some action."</p>

  <p>She slipped out of the Rue du Harlay without anyone noticing her;
  circumspect, composed, she proceeded to the Faubourg St. Honoré; she did not
  feel very triumphant nor very sure of herself. "He ought to have seen me this
  morning, after such a parting as we had it was his duty to see that I was
  immediately reassured." Yet how impossible to believe that he would abandon
  her; she must believe that he would not fail her...</p>

  <p>As she turned into the familiar Faubourg St. Honoré, which was to her a
  street of joyous and happy memories, she paused and closed her eyes to steady
  herself, then advanced slowly with her light, easy step over the pavement.
  She still looked down for she dreaded to see even from a distance that the
  lodges were closed, the gates locked, the family away; she could not face the
  realisation that he might have forsaken her.</p>

  <p>But when she did raise her glance she saw the gates of the Hotel du
  Boccage wide open and a crowd filling the courtyard, pressing round the
  porter's lodges, while a string of carriages blocked the roadway. People were
  passing hurriedly from these carriages in and out of the Hotel du Boccage;
  they were all, she noticed, men. Among them she recognised one of the doctors
  whom she had often seen in attendance on the Duchess and she thought, with a
  gleam of dreadful hope, "she has been taken ill, she has not been able to
  sustain the struggle, she is, perhaps, dying&mdash;ah! that is why he did not
  come."</p>

  <p>But why the crowd? Why this commotion? The porter was standing in the
  midst of a little group of men who seemed to be eagerly questioning and
  writing the answers down in notebooks. She had seen some of these at the
  great receptions and been told that they were journalists, that they
  represented the new and growing power of the press. The porter's face was
  contorted, at first she had scarcely recognised him; he gesticulated
  vehemently and kept drawing his hand over his throat.</p>

  <p>Lucille Debelleyme pulled her veil over her face and passed into the crowd
  in the courtyard; among others there were a few women of the lower classes
  with their baskets and marketing handkerchiefs on their arms. She looked up
  at the familiar mansion, the white facade showed charmingly through the
  little trees. The blinds were down in the pretty windows adorned with their
  festoons of marble flowers; the terraces and steps were full of agitated
  people coming and going.</p>

  <p>"A stroke of apoplexy? Is she then dead?"</p>

  <p>The governess turned and spoke to a woman beside her, "Can you tell me
  what has happened in the Hotel du Boccage? I am an old friend of the family,
  I came on a visit."</p>

  <p>Not only the woman to whom she spoke but everyone who could hear her
  question answered with eager horror: "Where have you been that you have not
  heard? A frightful crime was committed last night&mdash;Madame du Boccage has
  been murdered."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch46"
     name="ch46">CHAPTER XLVI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Mademoiselle Debelleyme pushed her way through the crowd,
  but on the edge she paused, there was something she must know. One of the
  young men with a notebook was hastening along the pavement, to his newspaper
  office no doubt; she detained him, standing in his way. "Tell me, you must
  have information&mdash;this crime? What is known of it?"</p>

  <p>He shrugged, not inclined to speak, impatient to be on his way: "Thieves,
  they say. I suppose they thought the house empty, the family returned
  unexpectedly. There was another outrage in the Elysee Bourbon two days ago.
  No one seems to know anything. The magistrates are there and the police
  commissioners of the Quartier du Roule."</p>

  <p>"But she&mdash;is it certain that she was murdered?"</p>

  <p>In obedience to a long-forgotten training the young man crossed himself:
  "That is certain&mdash;it is horrible, I have seen the room. I really can
  tell you nothing, it will all be in the papers. I believe that they are
  puzzled." His face crinkled up as she had seen the face of the sick girl
  crinkled up last night. "Excuse me, I feel ill&mdash;it is one of those
  things one does not expect," to defend himself he added, "M. Edouard du
  Boccage fainted."</p>

  <p>"Fainted? Why?"</p>

  <p>"He saw the room. Do you not understand? She had defended
  herself&mdash;there had been a struggle. It is really incredible&mdash;I
  mean, one does not imagine it like that&mdash;there was so much
  blood&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The young woman drew back as if she saw by her feet that thick, warm
  trickle from the slaughter-house oozing over the baked stone.</p>

  <p>"I should stay away from the Faubourg St. Honoré, Mademoiselle, if I were
  you&mdash;" the youth hurried away in search of a cognac.</p>

  <p>Mademoiselle looked back at the Hotel du Boccage, the crowd had increased
  even in the few moments since her arrival. People were hurrying from all
  directions, she thought they had a menacing air, and remembered that sinister
  sense of rising tumult which she had noticed in the streets last evening; it
  seemed now as if all those bitter discontents and muttered furies had found a
  focus in the Hotel du Boccage. More carriages, cabs, drove up, more men got
  out, doctors, neighbours, magistrates, police&mdash;what had
  happened&mdash;did she dare ask herself that?</p>

  <p>"I shall expect of you some action."</p>

  <p>She put her fingers to her mouth to prevent herself from crying aloud and
  fled back to the Rue du Harlay; she had nowhere else to go.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch47"
     name="ch47">CHAPTER XLVII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">When Lucille Debelleyme returned, Madame Trou stuck her head
  out of the sitting-room and asked: "Eh, you are back early, have you got the
  paper?"</p>

  <p>From over her shoulder came the tinkle of the polka. La Belle Helene and
  the hiccoughing moans of the sick girl, the greasy garlic odour of the dinner
  hung in the hot air.</p>

  <p>The governess did not reply; it seemed as if she had not heard. She went
  upstairs, hurrying, yet with difficulty, for she had to hold on to the
  bannisters to support herself and continually stumbled, catching her feet in
  her long skirt. Madame Trou stared after her:</p>

  <p>"Ah, you have not got it! It has all been a tale! Well, Mademoiselle, you
  must leave to-morrow."</p>

  <p>She closed the door of the parlour with an angry slam, still there faintly
  penetrated to Lucille Debelleyme's ears the broken rhythm of the polka.</p>

  <p>She fled into her room and locked the door; the maid had not yet swept and
  tidied it. The bed was disordered, her clothes, her toilet articles were in
  disarray; for the first time in her life she lacked neatness in her personal
  surroundings. For the first time in her life she did not care what her
  surroundings were; "What to do? Where to go? Where to hide? If I could stop
  thinking, is there any way to stop thinking?"</p>

  <p>She dropped against the tumbled bed, then fell on the dusty floor. Through
  the window, still open top and bottom, as she had set it during the night,
  the sunshine fell in a hot square over her prone body. By the utmost effort
  of her powerful will she did prevent herself from thinking, not a single
  reflection passed through her mind, but she could not prevent these words
  beating like a hammer throughout her whole body. "I ought to have kept that
  laudanum, I ought to have taken the laudanum from him," and "I shall expect
  some action from you."</p>

  <p>She hoped at first that she would faint or die or in some way pass into
  unconsciousness; but her courage and her strength seemed, despite her own
  wish, to gather force. Aware of the great heat of the August sun on her arms
  and shoulders as she lay on the floor, she shifted and crawled into the hot
  shadows at the side of the room; presently she sat up and put back the pale
  hair that fell over her face smudged by dust, marked from the pressure of the
  rough rug at the foot of the bed. Flies buzzed continuously, hawkers shouted
  hoarsely outside; she thought that the word they yelled was 'murder.'</p>

  <p>Her indomitable spirit that had been overthrown but not beaten roused her
  to faint hope: "Perhaps, after all, even now, there may be a way
  out&mdash;why should I fear the worst?"</p>

  <p>There were heavy steps, loud voices, on the stairs and a sharp rap at her
  door; had he perhaps come for her? Had thieves really broken in last night to
  the Hotel du Boccage and murdered the woman who had surprised them at their
  work?</p>

  <p>Lucille Debelleyme got to her feet, searched for a handkerchief, wiped her
  face, put back her hair. The imperative knock was repeated, she turned the
  key with stiff fingers. Madame Trou was outside and behind her the maid and
  two of the pupils, all agape and agog, pale, unfriendly faces thrust forward,
  staring at her with inquisitive eyes. Behind them on the first landing of the
  stairway were two policemen, others showed beyond them.</p>

  <p>At the sight of Lucille Debelleyme standing pale and composed in her
  doorway, Madame Trou began to stammer something venomous, horrified, half
  inarticulate.</p>

  <p>"Well, Madame?" asked the governess; she stepped on the landing and closed
  the door behind her; ignoring the group of bewildered, alarmed and spiteful
  females, she spoke coolly over their heads, glancing down the stairs at the
  policemen:</p>

  <p>"Yes, Messieurs, what do you want?"</p>

  <p>One of the men came up the stairs, putting aside the other women; his look
  and his voice were expressionless.</p>

  <p>"It is believed, on the clearest evidence, that M. du Boccage murdered his
  wife, and you are arrested as his accomplice."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch48"
     name="ch48">CHAPTER XLVIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Lucille Debelleyme was lodged in the Conciergerie in a small
  room of the women's prison, a quadrangular building that looked on a small
  courtyard. She made no protest, but seemed to hold an amused contempt for all
  her surroundings. She had asked for all her possessions and they had been
  given her. When she was told that she might, if she wished, communicate with
  friends, she had replied: "I have none." When she was asked if she would have
  a lawyer, she replied: "I have no means whereby I can pay one," but when told
  that she would be brought before the examining magistrates on the following
  day, she demanded with impressive gravity: "Of what am I accused? I am in
  complete ignorance of all the details of this atrocious crime which you dare
  to charge to me. I demand to be enlightened. What occurred in the Faubourg
  St. Honoré last night? You say that M. du Boccage is a murderer," and with an
  emphasis of contemptuous passion she added: "Impossible! I know him well, the
  best, the most generous, the kindest of men, he would not lift his hand
  against a woman, against any creature. He must be as innocent as I am
  myself."</p>

  <p>She spoke these words to the men who had been, since dawn, investigating
  the apartments and the inmates of the Hotel du Boccage; M. de Tassy, Prefet
  de Police and M. Mauzisse, the Public Prosecutor, who had been summoned from
  their beds to join the commissaries of the Quartier du Roule and the Quartier
  du Champs Élysées in the chamber of the murdered woman.</p>

  <p>They had visited the governess in her cell, hoping to surprise from her,
  in this moment of terrible emotion, the truth that she would have time to
  tamper with before her formal examination on the morrow.</p>

  <p>M. de Tassy answered her defiance; he was a man of sixty, robust,
  implacable, impassive, hardened by constant contact with crime. His sombre
  frock coat, his fringe of grey whiskers, his heavy watch-chain and starched
  collar, his well-polished boots and brown leather gloves gave him an air of
  hypocritical respectability; he looked like an English Methodist from a
  provincial town. It was he who, alone, cool and patient, had, unmoved,
  examined the corpse and its surroundings in the Hotel du Boccage and then
  named the murderer to his horrified, embarrassed colleagues.</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately, Mademoiselle, it is too clear that M. du Boccage is the
  assassin. I was able after my investigations this morning to convince M. le
  Procureur du Roi, M. le Juge d'instruction, M. le Procureur Général that this
  was a matter for the Chamber of Peers. Is that not so, M. Mauzisse?"</p>

  <p>The Public Prosecutor assented. He was troubled by an affair that seemed
  likely to distract the entire government, and caressed his ginger beard with
  nervous fingers as he looked at the woman who had been the cause, he was
  convinced, of a crime to the last degree horrible, stupid and
  inconvenient.</p>

  <p>"Impossible," said the governess.</p>

  <p>"The Court of Peers is convoked at present, and I, Mademoiselle, shall
  bring this charge before them&mdash;that of murder against M. du
  Boccage."</p>

  <p>As she spoke M. Mauzisse stared keenly from behind his spectacles at
  Lucille Debelleyme. M. de Tassy had never taken his gaze from her face; he
  put in sharply:</p>

  <p>"The news of this most horrible crime has caused an explosion of fury in
  Paris, it is with difficulty that we prevent the crowd from storming the
  Hotel du Boccage and seizing the person of the Duke."</p>

  <p>Mademoiselle Debelleyme showed nothing but an outburst of generous emotion
  as she exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"Where is he&mdash;in danger? Has he been arrested?"</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately, Mademoiselle, he is a peer of France and it is impossible
  to arrest him without a direct order from the King. He is in his own house
  but he is being watched."</p>

  <p>M. de Tassy, shrewd, cold and practised an observer as he was, could see
  no flinching in the bright, vivid glance of the governess as she replied to
  him:</p>

  <p>"I would I were beside M. du Boccage in his distress. He is my one friend,
  my only protector. Perhaps I could give him a little comfort, even if
  everyone is against him."</p>

  <p>"You will tell your story to-morrow before me, Mademoiselle, and my
  colleagues. I am bound to tell you that popular opinion is hot against you
  also. It is a most terrible, a most difficult, almost an incredible affair,
  even in my experience."</p>

  <p>The governess replied:</p>

  <p>"Am I, then, to be examined without any preparation, without knowing where
  I stand? What have you against me, under what excuse was I arrested?"</p>

  <p>M. Mauzisse put in sternly:</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle, the domestic history of the Hotel du Boccage has long been
  common property, it has furnished a scandal in which the press of Paris has
  concerned itself for the last year&mdash;we have besides read the letters of
  Madame la Duchess du Boccage to her husband, we have also her diary, we have
  the witness of the servants&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ah, spies!"</p>

  <p>"And, in brief, Mademoiselle, we have quite sufficient evidence&mdash;" M.
  Mauzisse broke off dramatically, and then, after a pause during which the
  governess' gaze never faltered from his, he added: "&mdash;to send M. du
  Boccage to the guillotine if he were not a peer of France. And you also ...
  "</p>

  <p>"&mdash;if I were not innocent," finished Lucille Debelleyme boldly. M. de
  Tassy was baffled by this audacious defence, he had come to visit her before
  her examination because he expected an hysterical feminine breakdown in which
  the entire truth would emerge. He had supposed that the young woman,
  completely broken, would confess to the whole intrigue, that she had been the
  mistress of M. du Boccage, that she had put him up to the crime, that she had
  plotted murder to regain her foothold in the Hotel du Boccage. Instead of
  that, by this cool effrontery, she had added to the confusion of a baffling
  affair. He thought her courage and intelligence remarkable, and began to
  understand how she had obtained such an extraordinary hold on a man like M.
  du Boccage. He glanced at M. Mauzisse and shrugged his shoulders, then, using
  the method of direct accusation, when she again pressed for details of the
  crime, cried out:</p>

  <p>"No need, Mademoiselle, for this hypocrisy, you very well know the details
  of what you planned yourself!"</p>

  <p>She looked at him in a way that made him feel that his method was stupid
  and melodramatic. She asked quietly:</p>

  <p>"Would you do me the favour. Monsieur, to tell me what has become of the
  children? I had a great affection for them."</p>

  <p>It was M. Mauzisse who answered gruffly:</p>

  <p>"The House of Montlosier du Boccage do not lack relations and friends;
  though the Maréchal de Frediani is in Corsica, his brother is in Paris, he
  has taken some of the children and the others have gone to the Dowager Madame
  du Boccage."</p>

  <p>"Ah, have they told that poor blind woman of this horrible crime?"</p>

  <p>"I do not think so, I believe she has been informed that her
  daughter-in-law perished in a stroke of apoplexy. Enough, Mademoiselle, I
  leave you to your own reflections, we shall see in the morning if we can get
  the truth out of you&mdash;remember confession is your only hope."</p>

  <p>"My life has been lived in the light of day, every action clear and open,"
  replied the governess, "it is I who want the truth, it is I who am completely
  at a loss as to what has really happened."</p>

  <p>She sat down at the bare prison table, looking so frail and young,
  resigned and melancholy that the hardened men of the world felt bewildered;
  even M. de Tassy was not quite so sure of her guilt as he had been when he
  entered her cell.</p>

  <p>"Let me see a doctor and have a sleeping draught," she asked, looking down
  at her quivering hands folded in front of her, "otherwise I do not think I
  shall have the strength for to-morrow."</p>

  <p>Thinking that if she either broke down or pretended to break down they
  would lose the evidence of the one person who had the key to this appalling
  affair, and also that she might betray herself to the doctor, M. de Tassy
  agreed to this visit.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch49"
     name="ch49">CHAPTER XLIX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">As it was one of the doctors who usually attended Madame du
  Boccage who visited the governess in her cell, she at once suspected him of
  being sent as a spy, and realised that every word she said to him would be
  repeated; she was used to being in a trap or a cage, watched and threatened.
  She lay still and silent on her prison bed, answering briefly the questions
  that he asked her about her health; then she demanded of him in a low voice,
  as she had demanded of M. de Tassy, details of the crime in the Faubourg St.
  Honoré.</p>

  <p>Dr. Lappe, an old man with a fashionable practice, was still shaken by
  what he had seen that morning, embarrassed and shocked by the part suddenly
  thrust on him. But he did as he had been instructed by the implacable M. de
  Tassy, gave her the information she had asked for and, seated by her low,
  wooden bed, watched the effect on her. Nor did she try to evade his scrutiny,
  her hands hung at her side, there was no attempt to hide her face. A small
  jet of gas in an open metal case that hung above the bed cast a coarse light
  on that small-featured, fair face, and the tumble of fine hair on the rough
  pillow. Beneath the lamp was an unheeded crucifix.</p>

  <p>The doctor stammered:</p>

  <p>"The servants were roused this morning by the sound of a bell coming from
  the apartment of Madame, the family were ready to depart for Dieppe to-day,
  some of the servants had gone in advance, several more had been dismissed by
  M. du Boccage yesterday. Those who were there ran to the assistance of their
  mistress. They found her on the floor by her bed, dead; she had been attacked
  and killed with an abominable fury. At first it was believed that thieves had
  done this, but there was no trace of anyone entering from the outside. The
  handle and the lock had been taken off the little door leading from Madame's
  bedchamber to her toilet cabinet and the corridor, it was found that all the
  bells had been cut except the one in the far corner of the room which the
  poor lady finally found. M. du Boccage was fully dressed, his clothes were
  stained&mdash;from head to foot&mdash;he was supposed to have been the first
  to find his wife, to embrace her in his distress, to have in this manner
  covered himself with blood."</p>

  <p>The governess moved slightly on the prison bed but she did not flinch, and
  the doctor, observing her with professional, yet uneasy keenness,
  continued:</p>

  <p>"His room was in the most frightful disorder; one of the magistrates on
  entering found him emptying a basin of water out of the window; he had been
  washing his clothes and burning fragments of cloth on the hearth, a
  suffocating morning like this and a fire burning! Ah, well. Mademoiselle, I
  will not give you any more details, I will have pity on you, except to say
  when M. du Boccage was examined his denials were embarrassed, miserable, that
  on his person was found a green cord and a bottle of laudanum&mdash;he could
  give no explanation of these. In his room, too, were weapons, a pistol,
  knives."</p>

  <p>Closing her eyes the governess said:</p>

  <p>"If he did it, it was because she drove him mad, after one of their
  terrible quarrels... "</p>

  <p>"So at first it was supposed, but the cut bells. Mademoiselle, the handle
  taken off the door?&mdash;and, another thing, it was noted soon after the
  Duke began to be suspected, that he cast himself with his full weight on his
  wife's bed and that he glanced up at the baldaquin, which is very massive, as
  if expecting it to fall."</p>

  <p>"It was examined afterwards and found that the supports had been loosened
  and much of the cement taken away and replaced by wax. The workmanship was
  clumsy&mdash;that of an amateur, no doubt&mdash;but every time that the
  Duchess got into bed she risked the baldaquin falling on her. It looks like
  premeditation, doesn't it. Mademoiselle? Then they found her letters, her
  diary&mdash;and yours... "</p>

  <p>"They have seen those also?" She opened her eyes; they were fearless. "Ah
  well, they will declare nothing but my innocence."</p>

  <p>"The police have searched your lodging in the Rue du Harlay,
  Mademoiselle&mdash;they have the other part of the correspondence&mdash;M. du
  Boccage's letters to you."</p>

  <p>"They will learn nothing from those." She raised herself suddenly on her
  elbows, looking like a child with the veil of pale, disordered curls falling
  over her slight shoulders. "There is one thing more, doctor&mdash;M. du
  Boccage? He is still free in his own house?&mdash;no one dare touch him?"</p>

  <p>"That is the dilemma, he is a peer of France, they have had to apply to
  the King. Oh, the scandal! His Majesty will do a great deal not to see the
  Chevalier of the Duchesse D'Orleans dragged to the guillotine... "</p>

  <p>"To the guillotine?" repeated the governess, "to the guillotine? What will
  he do?" she added, clutching the doctor's arms.</p>

  <p>"His friends, the peers, have given him his chance, it is not for me to
  say what he will do. Mademoiselle, you must think of yourself, you must
  confess&mdash;everything."</p>

  <p>The old man rose; despite his professional insensibility and his worldly
  self-assurance he was agitated, overwhelmed.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I will think of myself&mdash;there's no one else to think of me."
  The governess took the sleeping draught he had prepared, raising the glass
  with a steady hand. "I wish it could give me repose for ever, Monsieur."</p>

  <p>Dr. Lappe rose and turned away; he had never been in a prison cell before;
  it was not a comfortable situation for a cosy old gentleman who had gentle,
  pretty daughters of his own, whose practice had been wholly with the idle,
  the elegant, the well-behaved&mdash;then, what he had seen this morning in
  the greyness of the dawn; those curtains of Brussels lace hanging from gilt
  amorini, torn, stained&mdash;that nightcap of net with silk strings on the
  mantelpiece, soaked and dripping, those prints on the delicate walls, prints
  of a thumbless hand fumbling for bell ropes that had been cut away&mdash;and
  Madame du Boccage herself&mdash;thirty wounds&mdash;eleven on the head
  alone&mdash;butchery&mdash;then, the scene in the dining-room where the dust
  covers had not been taken off the furniture for a family en
  passage&mdash;eight o'clock in the morning the magistrates gathered round the
  long table, among them Camille du Boccage, his redingote closed to the chin,
  his hands gloved in brown leather, his sleeves, the knees of his trousers
  freshly washed, still damp, his face colourless, impassive, staring past
  everyone there&mdash;preserving, despite the hour, the occasion, his
  disarray, his air of elegance&mdash;grotesque, dreadful and in some curious
  fashion, absurd.</p>

  <p>"Of what are you thinking, M. Lappe?" cried the governess from the bed.
  "You have horror in your eyes!"</p>

  <p>"Ah, I thought you slept&mdash;the draught&mdash;" stammered the old
  doctor. "Is it not strong enough?"</p>

  <p>"Give me another&mdash;to-night I do not sleep so easily&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, I dare not."</p>

  <p>He left her, having no further courage; a wardress immediately entered and
  sat down in silence by the prisoner's bed; Lucille Debelleyme turned her face
  to the wall. With expert fingers the wardress crocheted a baby's boot in
  white thread and never raised her eyes from this work nor ceased to count the
  stitches.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch50"
     name="ch50">CHAPTER L</a></h2>

  <p class="first">While the angry crowd clustered round the Hotel du Boccage
  openly demanding the punishment of the murderer, who, they feared, owing to
  his rank, his friendship with the Royal Family, would escape retribution
  (there was already talk that the King had smuggled him to England), while the
  whole peerage was aghast, shaken by this frightful disaster, while the civil
  authorities were faced by the problem of what to do with a criminal who was
  also a peer of France, a member of one of the noblest, most powerful families
  of the realm, Lucille Debelleyme, suddenly the most notorious, most hated
  woman in France, appeared before M. Mauzisse the <i>procureur géneral</i>,
  and M. Hamelin <i>juge d'instruction</i>. These men and their clerks could
  not help looking with avid curiosity at this woman whom all the world accused
  of long, shameless and secret adultery, of murder plotted in the shadow of a
  nursery, between the kisses and caresses of the children of the
  victim&mdash;this nobody who had brought to ruin a famous House.</p>

  <p>She was calm and had dressed herself carefully, her gown of pale nankeen
  was adorned with white braid <i>en soutache</i>, she wore a little jacket of
  black moire. She carried her frilled straw bonnet with the lilac ribbon, as
  if she expected, after her examination, to be permitted to leave the
  Conciergerie.</p>

  <p>The setting was one of extreme ugliness, the walls drab. The light from a
  high window fell on a bare expanse of brick and the group of elderly men in
  their frock coats, striped trousers, formidable in their massed authority,
  their sombre gravity, their air of being not only on the side of the law but
  that of God. M. Viou had an irritating cough and sucked lozenges that scented
  the stale air with a sickly whiff of aromatics; M. Hamelin, who was extremely
  stout, felt the heat and alternately wiped his bald head and napped at the
  flies with his foulard; two clerks at a side table covered with baize, took
  down with great speed question and reply. The Prefet de Police, M. de Tassy,
  quite unmoved, conducted the examination.</p>

  <p>He began by repeating, in formal fashion, his accusation of last
  night&mdash;M. du Boccage was a murderer, and she, calling herself Lucille
  Debelleyme, was his accomplice. The prisoner broke passionately, without
  restraint, but not with hysteria, into denials:</p>

  <p>"It is impossible. I do not believe that he has done it. May I go to
  him?&mdash;may I see him? If he has done it, then indeed I am as much to
  blame as he, it was that unhappy letter&mdash;I should not have asked for
  it&mdash;a letter to restore my character. Messieurs, that I demanded of him,
  that he was to have obtained from his wife. Some madness&mdash;I know I was
  wrong&mdash;I should never have asked for it&mdash;in my letters to the
  children."</p>

  <p>M. de Tassy interrupted:</p>

  <p>"We do not want your sentimental self-accusations, Mademoiselle, we want
  the truth. These letters of which you spoke&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You can read them, Messieurs."</p>

  <p>"We have already read them. They are not only addressed to the children.
  These letters that you speak of are also written to M. du Boccage."</p>

  <p>"I do not deny it. I have said repeatedly he was so good, so generous to
  me, my one friend, my one protector. I did feel for him, I do now, affection,
  tenderness, loyalty." Her clear bold glance travelled from one to another of
  the keen faces watching her with such hostility. "Is it impossible for you.
  Messieurs, to believe in an honest affection? I am not an adultress."</p>

  <p>"This sentiment of tender affection," asked the Prefet de Police, "was it
  shared by M. du Boccage?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Lucille Debelleyme immediately. "M. le Duc had nothing for
  me but the kindness any generous, chivalrous man might feel for a dependant
  in his house who served him well. I loved his children, I did what I could
  for them, their mother did not know how to treat them... "</p>

  <p>"Ah," interrupted M. de Tassy, "if Mr. du Boccage committed this crime,
  are we to believe he did it because his wife did not know how to treat their
  children?"</p>

  <p>Mademoiselle Debelleyme did not reply to this but it seemed rather from
  contempt for the judges than from lack of anything to say. M. de Tassy,
  inexorable, continued with increasing sternness; he did not know if the young
  woman spoke with sincerity or was playing a skilful and dangerous game, but
  he followed the principle that to discover the crime one must assume that the
  accused is guilty.</p>

  <p>"The truth is very different, Mademoiselle. Everyone is aware of the
  profound disorder which you brought into this household. Everyone knows the
  life the Duke and Duchess led, there was even a suggestion, more than one
  suggestion, of judicial separation."</p>

  <p>"How was I to know any of that? I was in a position of paid servant in the
  household, in the confidence of no one. I felt the warmest esteem and
  friendship for M. du Boccage but he did not tell me his secrets, discuss his
  wife's domestic affairs with me. I lived enclosed with the children of whom I
  had the entire care; how should I, so occupied, in such company, know the
  scandals of Paris?"</p>

  <p>She argued this unlikely plea with such art that her examiners were more
  baffled than they dared allow to appear.</p>

  <p>"Were you not. Mademoiselle, aware of a scandal when Monsieur l'Abbé Galle
  himself came to speak to you, to beg you to leave the mansion?"</p>

  <p>"I was aware of it then, and I left immediately; it was certainly a shock
  to me for I believed myself on good terms with Madame du Boccage. We had
  exchanged presents not long before and complimentary letters. But the moment
  I discovered it was otherwise and I was a source of trouble in the house, I
  left."</p>

  <p>Triumph edged her smile. She had spoken the truth but, though it carried a
  reluctant conviction that it was the truth even in the minds of these men who
  had been so sure of her guilt, M. de Tassy pursued the charge.</p>

  <p>"Well, Mademoiselle, you had nothing for the Duke but respectful
  friendship, and he nothing for you but a kind esteem, and you left the house
  immediately you thought you were causing any disorder, any anxiety for Madame
  la Duchesse, and yet as soon as you had left there was an exchange of
  letters&mdash;the Duke returned before his usual custom, indeed most
  suddenly, to Paris and his first visit was to you."</p>

  <p>"I have confessed, Monsieur, that those letters were my weakness, I could
  not endure this sudden separation from the children and from their father
  too. I have told you he was my only friend. It is true he came to see me but
  he brought the children. I had had to appeal to him for this certificate of
  reinstatement. I was aware then, Messieurs, only too poignantly aware, of
  these scandals that you have mentioned which are supposed to have run round
  Paris for months. It was a question of my honour, my livelihood."</p>

  <p>M. de Tassy interrupted:</p>

  <p>"This letter&mdash;you knew well enough the Duchess would not give it you.
  No doubt her husband demanded it of her&mdash;what is the
  result?&mdash;yesterday morning she was murdered."</p>

  <p>"There is no one whose horror of that crime could be greater than
  mine."</p>

  <p>M. de Viou scribbled a note on a sheet torn from his pocket-book and
  handed it to M. de Tassy. The Prefet de Police read it, then, exclaiming: "A
  good point!" turned again to the prisoner:</p>

  <p>"You say that you knew nothing of any scandal until M. l'Abbé Galle spoke
  to you&mdash;yet it is well known to members of the family Montlosier Boccage
  that on the return from your visit to Corsica, which shocked everyone, you
  went to M. Le Maréchal de Frediani, seemingly outraged by comments in the
  press?"</p>

  <p>"That is true. Friends of mine pointed out some paragraphs&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Friends?&mdash;what friends have you?"</p>

  <p>"Probably none. Monsieur, I had friends when I was more fortunate. I was
  so hurt by these illusions that I wished to leave M. du Boccage&mdash;I asked
  M. de Frediani to bear witness to my behaviour in Corsica. He did so, he
  begged me, with all respect, to remain with his daughter&mdash;he said such
  scribblings were nothing, that the republican papers libelled all the members
  of the aristocracy&mdash;that I was to ignore such vile rubbish. I did
  so."</p>

  <p>"Yet, after this conversation, you were surprised when M. l'Abbé Galle
  spoke to you of the trouble you were causing in the house of Madame du
  Boccage?"</p>

  <p>The candid eyes of the governess expressed surprise as she answered:</p>

  <p>"Certainly, Monsieur. How could I suspect that Madame du Boccage was
  disturbed by stupid gossip that her own father had assured me was beneath the
  notice of even a poor creature like myself?"</p>

  <p>M. Mauzisse pulled at his beard with a movement of irritation, but M. de
  Tassy continued, undisturbed by the prisoner's strategy; he changed his
  ground and made an attack in an unexpected quarter.</p>

  <p>"Matilde Bernard, maid to Madame du Boccage, swears that on the morning of
  your departure from the Faubourg St. Honoré she came upon you&mdash;in your
  own room, in the arms of M. le Duc."</p>

  <p>"Servants spy and lie. Monsieur, as a matter of habit. This woman followed
  M. le Duc day and night&mdash;she could give you an analysis of all his
  movements. But it happens to be true that she saw me in his arms. I had been
  packing, I was very upset at this sudden dismissal, M. le Duc came to take my
  keys. At the moment of giving them I was seized by an attack of
  giddiness&mdash;I was about to fall, M. de Due caught me&mdash;it is possible
  that you, Monsieur, might have done the same."</p>

  <p>"We are not here to speculate on that, Mademoiselle. The woman Bernard
  maintains that you said, on being discovered&mdash;'Go and tell your mistress
  where and how you found M. le Duc.'"</p>

  <p>"That is a lie. And a stupid one. You perceive the creature's despicable
  mind!" The prisoner's contempt was icy.</p>

  <p>"Well, what did you say?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot remember&mdash;I have said I was half unconscious&mdash;I
  thought nothing of the support of M. le Duc."</p>

  <p>M. de Tassy, exasperated by the tenacity of this woman who thus defended
  herself inch by inch, directly accused her:</p>

  <p>"M. du Boccage committed this murder at your instigation. You were his
  mistress&mdash;you wished at any cost to return to the Faubourg St. Honoré.
  It was you who inspired him to replace the plaster of the baldaquin with wax,
  and to keep, in case of an opportunity, a cord on his person and poison in
  his pocket."</p>

  <p>Lucille Debelleyme's bright eyes flickered from one to another of the
  grim, hostile faces confronting her but she did not wince.</p>

  <p>"If Madame du Boccage had died naturally and M. du Boccage had offered me
  his hand I should, out of affection for the children, have refused to consent
  to a marriage which would have discredited them, and I happen to be.
  Monsieur, the type of woman who has no other thoughts of any connection with
  a man than marriage. He was not my lover&mdash;he did not plan to make me his
  wife. Surely there is something in my accents which will convince you that I
  speak the truth?"</p>

  <p>"Your accents may be all very well," replied M. de Tassy, "but your matter
  is incredible. If there was no tie, no feeling whatever between you and M. du
  Boccage, why did he retain you in his household in the face of the frantic
  entreaties of his wife, of the threats of his father-in-law, of the murmurs
  of public opinion, of the warnings of the Royal Family?"</p>

  <p>"I did not know that he had done so." The governess raised her head with a
  movement that seemed triumphant. "If that is so, Messieurs, no doubt it was
  because I was able to make his children happy and produce some order into his
  establishment."</p>

  <p>"Ah, Mademoiselle, you allocate to yourself an impossible virtue. You are,
  on your own admission, penniless, friendless, helpless, a nobody. You have
  created a good deal of mystery and romance about yourself but you are merely
  the illegitimate daughter of one Lucille Clery, and your father is unknown
  even to yourself. Your one relative, Desire Gavaudan de Clery, a man of
  dubious character, disowns you. You have been earning your own living since
  you were about eighteen, you have gone from one place to another, never
  remaining very long anywhere."</p>

  <p>"But," interrupted Lucille Debelleyme, smiling, "I have always taken away
  with me, Messieurs, the most excellent testimonials."</p>

  <p>"That may be, Mademoiselle, but your training, your circumstances, your
  prospects make it most unlikely that you would have been able to resist a man
  like M. du Boccage, cultured, charming, elegant, wealthy, one with whom, as
  you confess, you had many tastes in common, but unfortunately, easily led by
  a dominating woman&mdash;a man whom you admit you regard with tender
  affection."</p>

  <p>The governess smiled again; she did not find these magistrates so
  terrifying, she could more than hold her own with them.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I should not have resisted him," she answered quietly. "But have
  I not told you, Messieurs, that he never made love to me? Perhaps, as you
  say, if he had laid siege to me I should not have been able to preserve my
  honour against one who, as you so rightly judge, seemed so attractive to a
  miserable nobody like myself. Maybe my gratitude, my loyalty would have made
  me sacrifice to M. du Boccage my reputation, my honour, though it never could
  have inspired me to insinuate to him a design to touch one hair of his wife's
  head; but he never offered me any manner of love."</p>

  <p>"I never heard a prisoner so obstinate!" exclaimed M. de Viou,
  angrily.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps, Monsieur, you never heard one so innocent."</p>

  <p>"Bah!" M. de Tassy rose with calculated violence. "You are lying, go back
  to your cell and consider if it is wise to continue lying."</p>

  <p>But when the prisoner had been led out, he turned to his colleagues and
  threw up his hands in a gesture of despair.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch51"
     name="ch51">CHAPTER LI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Hatred, desire for vengeance, cruel curiosity beat against
  the wall of the prison where the governess was enclosed.</p>

  <p>This central figure of this unparalleled scandal regarded all who passed
  before her with a fixed gaze, she was well trained to repel spiteful
  scrutiny. She remained an enigma to all those who were permitted to visit her
  in her cell or to watch her taking her hour's exercise slowly walking to and
  fro, wearing the light nankeen dress adorned with white <i>soutache</i>, in
  the narrow courtyard between the four prison façades, grim with barred
  windows.</p>

  <p>She had been offered the consolations of a priest, but remembering the
  Abbé Galle, who had struck one of the first blows towards her downfall, she
  had refused.</p>

  <p>She had equally disdained the religious books offered her by the wardress,
  but she took from among her own possessions a small volume of fashionable
  poems given her by a former pupil, and this was constantly in her hands
  either when she sat in her cell or when she walked in the dreary little
  enclosed courtyard.</p>

  <p>She murmured over again and again to herself the sentimental foolish
  lines&mdash;they served to keep her from thinking.</p>

  <p>Daily one or more of the judges, lawyers or police visited and questioned
  her; they believed, in common with the rest of Paris, that this extraordinary
  woman held the key to this crime, so terrible as to be almost incredible.</p>

  <p>She learnt from their accusing words how the whole country was shaken by
  this brutal murder. Not that murders of this kind did not happen almost every
  day, but no one paid much attention when some miserable wretch in a slum
  raised his hand against a nagging wife or a jealous mistress.</p>

  <p>It was the rank, the wealth of the victim, still more the rank, the wealth
  of the murderer, which roused this fury of class feeling. The angry mob that
  the police could hardly keep in check outside the Hotel du Boccage wanted not
  so much justice as to assure themselves that the great nobleman would receive
  the same punishment as an insignificant villain, and, behind this increasing
  clamour, led and inflamed by furious articles in the press, was the savage
  desire to see the head of a peer of France roll on the guillotine step. There
  was an explosion of rage against the House of Peers, against the aristocracy,
  against the King himself, against the whole insolent, arrogant world of money
  and leisure which, in the eyes of the people, had fallen into disrepute with
  the murder at the Hotel du Boccage.</p>

  <p>Lucille Debelleyme listened to the threats and denunciations of her
  examiners without betraying herself; she was neither hysterical nor defiant,
  and all her answers had a cold common sense at variance with her romantic
  history, her extraordinary circumstances.</p>

  <p>Repeatedly she asked: "Has M. du Boccage admitted he is a murderer?" and
  they were forced to answer "No."</p>

  <p>She then demanded: "If the Duke had been arrested?" Again the answer was
  "No&mdash;he is still being watched in his own Hotel, as the King could not
  bring himself to sign a decree for the arrest of a peer of France the affair
  was held in suspension; M. du Boccage was continually being examined but he
  had fallen into a low state of health and refused to answer official
  questions." The elaborate and detailed denials with which he had at first
  defended himself had given place to sullen, brief excuses. "He was too
  overcome, he was too fatigued, he had nothing to say."</p>

  <p>His brother, his friends had been allowed to visit him, the Maréchal de
  Frediani was being called back from Corsica; meanwhile, a most sumptuous
  funeral, attended by everyone of consequence in France, had been given in the
  Madeleine for the victim&mdash;the martyr, the chaste and stainless woman,
  the devoted wife, the loving mother, pious, blameless Fanny du Boccage,
  already canonised by the grief of a people.</p>

  <p>Lucille Debelleyme listened to these accounts, which the police hoped
  would strike some emotional admission from her, with downcast eyes.</p>

  <p>Exasperated by this enigma M. de Tassy said:</p>

  <p>"Well, Mademoiselle, have you nothing to say, no expression of grief or
  horror even for this tragedy in which you were so closely concerned? Do you
  not at least condemn the horrible crime which the man whom you call your
  friend, your protector, has committed?"</p>

  <p>"M. du Boccage, according to your own account, M. le Prefect, has not
  confessed he is a murderer. Why, therefore, should I assume him guilty when I
  do not even know the whole details of the case, when you are my only
  informer, when what you say is obviously designed to frighten me, to impress
  me with the fact that he is a criminal?"</p>

  <p>"He is and you are his accomplice. Remember. Mademoiselle, we have your
  letters."</p>

  <p>"You will learn nothing from them except my devotion to this man and my
  love for his children, my pity for his situation, my desire to help the one
  person who has been kind to me." Quietly raising her brilliant eyes she
  added: "I would now willingly give my life for his, my one regret at my
  present situation is that it prevents me going to him."</p>

  <p>"Are you as shameless as all that; you have the effrontery to say that you
  would go to him, in the face of everything, through the blood of his murdered
  wife!"</p>

  <p>"Through anything. Monsieur; he is my friend; it is your misfortune if you
  cannot understand the power of friendship. He must be suffering, be in
  torment. He and I&mdash;" and here a note of wild exultation swept her
  careful voice out of control, "should be together now; alone, out of all
  Paris, out of all France we perhaps understand each other."</p>

  <p>"That is a dangerous admission, Mademoiselle. I believe you have confessed
  a little too much; no doubt you and M. du Boccage understood each other only
  too well!"</p>

  <p>"It is impossible for friends to understand each other too well."</p>

  <p>"Remember we have your letters."</p>

  <p>"Search them, Monsieur, through and through&mdash;you will find you are
  cruelly slandering an innocent woman&mdash;maybe. God help you, an innocent
  man."</p>

  <p>Her looks, her manners, her gestures would have carried a conviction of
  innate sincerity, of the dignity and candour of innocence had not it seemed
  so unlikely that what she said was true.</p>

  <p>M. de Tassy remained amazed at her art, her fortitude, but certain of her
  guilt. He was forced to close one enquiry after another without having
  obtained anything from Lucille Debelleyme to damage either herself or M. du
  Boccage. M. de Tassy grimly admired the courage whereby this young woman,
  without a friend, without advice, surrounded by enemies, in an awful
  position, under the very shadow of the guillotine, thus defended herself with
  skill and a proud dignity behind which seemed to sparkle the vehement passion
  of innocence falsely accused.</p>

  <p>For a week the ex-governess of the Faubourg St. Honoré endured the
  tortures of her position with the stoicism of an Indian brave at the stake.
  She was under perpetual surveillance, even at night she would be wakened
  suddenly in the hope of startling her into some exclamation that might prove
  an admission of guilt.</p>

  <p>When she walked in the little garden into which the autumn sunshine
  penetrated for only a short time, police, journalists, men of letters, all
  the inquisitive people who could contrive to bribe a way into the
  Conciergerie regarded her with insatiable curiosity from behind the grilled
  windows of the prison. They saw a slight figure in a neat pale dress, with
  long, fair curls hanging on her shoulders, a lace scarf tied round her head,
  walking to and fro with measured steps, her eyes fastened on a book she held
  in her slender hand.</p>

  <p>She made no attempt to attract any pity, not by so much as an upward
  glance did she appeal to those who pressed their faces against the bars of
  the upper window, staring at her as if she had been the inhabitant of some
  unknown world suddenly caught and caged.</p>

  <p>The more sensitive of those who so cruelly observed her found her
  beautiful with that beauty which does not consist only in exactitude of
  feature but in the grace, the poise, the air of the entire person. She was
  elegant, composed, dignified beyond what seemed possible to expect of a woman
  in her circumstances.</p>

  <p>Some men said that they could understand the fatal infatuation of M. du
  Boccage, but not one of all those who peered and spied and commented and
  judged Lucille Debelleyme felt for her the least sympathy.</p>

  <p>All pity, all compassion, all respect and admiration had been lavished on
  the woman who lay in the gilt and purple velvet coffin, heavy with armorial
  bearings, hidden beneath a mountain of costly flowers in the sombre
  black-hung aisles of the Madeleine.</p>

  <p>M. de Tassy did not fail to detail to Lucille Debelleyme the amazing
  scenes of public grief at this funeral, the frantic tokens of veneration, of
  love that followed the mutilated remains of her former mistress to the vaults
  of the Madeleine&mdash;the extravagant wreaths and immense bouquets that even
  the very poorest had sent to do honour to one so beloved, so wronged.</p>

  <p>The governess coolly remarked: "Poor woman! Had I had the means I, too,
  would have liked to have sent a wreath."</p>

  <p>Debelleyme was left alone in a solitude which he hoped would wear down her
  resolute resistance.</p>

  <p>She was warned, however, that they were searching through her
  correspondence, through that of the Duke, through papers and letters of
  Madame du Boccage. Her warder and the curious who continued to watch her when
  she walked in the garden left her in no doubt as to the violent emotion of
  the people, the popular fury, even the prospect of a revolution if she and
  her paramour were not brought to justice.</p>

  <p>She maintained her calm, behind which seemed to surge a fierce
  contempt.</p>

  <p>No one could surprise her into tears; on all occasions she conducted
  herself with a brave coolness that provoked a reluctant admiration but
  alienated all possible sympathies.</p>

  <p>One morning as she walked up and down the narrow courtyard (she never
  refused to take this exercise, though well aware to what it exposed her) a
  republican journalist pressing against the bars of one of the lower windows
  exclaimed, loud enough for her to hear: "A charming but a wicked woman."</p>

  <p>The governess raised her brilliant eyes from her little book and, turning
  her elegant head, looked full at the young man with a glance he was never to
  forget and never to remember without a sense of uneasiness.</p>

  <p>"Do you really know what wickedness is?" she demanded. "Even were I judged
  and condemned, you would be bold to apply that word to me."</p>

  <p>That afternoon she was again summoned before M. de Tassy and his
  colleagues. She was observed to tremble a little as she passed into the room
  where they subjected her to their interrogations; she asked the wardress who
  accompanied her for a glass of water. This was given her and she seemed to
  recover her composure, but when she entered the room and glanced at those
  hostile figures, those stern, accusing faces, she requested, for the first
  time, permission to seat herself. "Was it possible," thought M. de Tassy,
  "that she was, at last, weakening?" A chair was given her&mdash;she waited
  with folded hands and downcast eyes, as so often she had awaited the
  inspection of a new employer, the commands of a mistress, the judgment of a
  superior. M. de Tassy began:</p>

  <p>"Well, Mademoiselle, this terrible affair is now a little different from
  when we questioned you last."</p>

  <p>"Is that so, Monsieur? As you know, I am totally ignorant of what is
  occurring in Paris."</p>

  <p>"We will enlighten you. It is now certain M. du Boccage committed this
  frightful murder."</p>

  <p>"Has he confessed?"</p>

  <p>"He has confessed in the only fashion which, a man of his birth could use;
  by committing another crime he has escaped the punishment of the first."</p>

  <p>The Prefet de Police paused, watching with cold interest the young woman,
  who moved slightly on her chair, fumbled with her handkerchief, raised it to
  her lips and dropped it again.</p>

  <p>"Has he confessed?" she asked again, her composure a little blurred.</p>

  <p>"He is dead. Mademoiselle, dead in prison. He did the only thing he could
  do, he swallowed arsenic."</p>

  <p>"Dead in prison," repeated Lucille Debelleyme in an expressionless
  voice.</p>

  <p>"He was arrested at five in the morning, and taken to the prison of the
  Luxembourg, Mademoiselle. He was then already a dying man, he had brought
  arsenic with him from Javiaux du Boccage. As soon as he saw he was suspected
  he drank this frightful poison. He has judged and punished himself&mdash;he
  has gone before God to answer for this crime&mdash;leaving you. Mademoiselle,
  the responsibility before human justice."</p>

  <p>The judges then had, at last, the satisfaction of seeing their victim lose
  her inhuman calm; she sprang from her seat with an involuntary movement of
  horror, as if she recoiled from a terrible sight.</p>

  <p>"Dead&mdash;he is dead!" The waiting, watchful men were silent. "And I
  knew nothing about it," she continued. "I was never told&mdash;if I had been
  there perhaps he would not have done it."</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle, there was nothing else for him to do. By his action,
  frightful as it is, he has at least spared the peerage the disgrace of seeing
  the head of a Montlosier du Boccage in the basket of the guillotine."</p>

  <p>Falling into her chair, Lucille Debelleyme asked in a low voice:</p>

  <p>"Did he suffer?"</p>

  <p>"The torments of the damned, Mademoiselle. It is not easy to die by
  arsenic."</p>

  <p>"Laudanum, that's better," she muttered, her hands to her mouth, "why
  didn't he use the laudanum?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, you know, then, he had laudanum?"</p>

  <p>Even in that moment she did not allow them to gain an advantage over
  her:</p>

  <p>"You yourself told me that," she replied.</p>

  <p>She sat crouched and rigid, she seemed to have shrunk under their eyes so
  that it was to them as if they looked at the figure of a child.</p>

  <p>M. de Tassy rose to his feet. This was surely the moment to strike a final
  blow that would extract, in this agony of grief, the truth from Lucille
  Debelleyme, who had just learnt that she had no accomplice to shield, no
  friend to fight for, no protector on whom she might, however fantastically,
  hope to rely in the future.</p>

  <p>Leaning forward and pressing his hands on the table, M. de Tassy
  exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"Confess, Mademoiselle, have pity upon yourself, offer the only reparation
  in your power&mdash;that of the truth."</p>

  <p>Still drooping on her chair and shading her eyes with her hands the
  governess replied:</p>

  <p>"You know all."</p>

  <p>"Ah, you admit then that we are right."</p>

  <p>"Right in what, Messieurs? You have examined my letters. No doubt by now
  you have gone into my life day by day, month by month, year by year,
  therefore you must know everything about me. I have no secrets." Then, as if
  to herself, as if trying to understand this new and awful fact, she murmured:
  "He is dead&mdash;he is dead."</p>

  <p>M. de Tassy took advantage of this indication of anguish and, hoping to
  overwhelm and break her by telling her of the torture of the man whom they
  still regarded as her lover and accomplice, he began to relate the details of
  the death of M. du Boccage.</p>

  <p>To the rage of the people, denied its prey, he had taken arsenic, not, as
  was falsely believed, with the connivance of the Chamber of Peers and his
  relatives, desperately anxious to avoid a horrible public scandal; he took it
  immediately he had believed himself suspected. He had bad ample leisure, for
  M. le Duc Pasquier had, by invoking the authority of the Chamber of Peers,
  resisted the desire of the police to arrest the suspect.</p>

  <p>Despite all the efforts of a number of doctors to keep him alive the Duke
  had died after a week of torment. He had a strong constitution and was in
  perfect health&mdash;he had resisted for several days the inroads of the
  deadly poison. During the last few days of his life he had been incessantly
  questioned by the representative of the Chamber of Peers, their indomitable
  chancellor M. le Duc Pasquier, who endeavoured to force an admission of
  guilt.</p>

  <p>At this point Lucille Debelleyme broke into the impassive official
  narrative.</p>

  <p>"Ah, the old man, blind with cataract&mdash;I remember him," she
  whispered&mdash;"Despite these&mdash;torments M. du Boccage confessed
  nothing?"</p>

  <p>"There was no need&mdash;his terrible action betrayed all."</p>

  <p>"He confessed nothing?" persisted the governess and M. de Tassy admitted
  that M. du Boccage had died without a direct avowal of the crime passing his
  lips&mdash;he did not add that the Duke's last word, in answer to the stern
  question: "Are you guilty?" had been: "No!"</p>

  <p>"Then," said the governess, suddenly lowering her hands and looking at her
  examiners directly, "If he has died without confessing he could have said
  nothing of an accomplice. Therefore why do your suspicions continue to fall
  on me?"</p>

  <p>"Reason, logic, common sense. I know, too, that criminals always lie. It
  is very natural."</p>

  <p>"This is merely your assumption," she parried, "you have talked much of my
  letters, of my correspondence with M. du Boccage&mdash;you have had time
  enough to read this now, and carefully, too, every line I wrote. Well,
  Messieurs, what did you find in them?"</p>

  <p>Her judges were silent, admitting nothing, retracting nothing,
  intimidating her by their immobility. The truth was that though her letters
  might give rise to strong suspicions of guilt, they contained no actual
  proofs of either adultery or murder. The ones to M. du Boccage were, indeed,
  couched in such terms as she would address to one who was a protector, friend
  and affectionate master; in brief, every line she had written, and the few
  short, badly expressed letters of the Duke to her, confirmed the almost
  incredible relationship that she had avowed existed between them; neither
  could the cold eyes of justice see in the impassioned letters of the victim,
  nor in her diary, any proof that Madame du Boccage was actually convinced
  that the governess was her husband's mistress.</p>

  <p>As the formidable silence continued, Lucille Debelleyme's gaze wandered
  from the group of watchful men; she appeared to forget she was not alone.
  Leaning on the back of the chair she twisted her fingers together and
  whispered: "so they are orphans, the little ones whom I loved so much. He,
  too, was more a friend than a master during two years! I have received from
  him such proofs of goodness and affection&mdash;he never said a hard word to
  me&mdash;never! He did all he could to help me and so often I needed
  help&mdash;he is dead&mdash;dead in a prison&mdash;in agony! That terrible
  blind old man! They say that I provoked this awful tragedy."</p>

  <p>She looked up suddenly as if again aware she was being watched, listened
  to. "Never believe that he premeditated this crime, he was the best, the most
  excellent of men, he became mad! Oh, if you knew what his home was. Anyone
  might have lost their reason in the middle of that hell."</p>

  <p>"Ah, Mademoiselle, you admit that the Hotel du Boccage was a hell?"</p>

  <p>"Not through me. Look at me! Do I look like the sort of woman to plot
  adultery and murder in the shadow of an infant's cradle?"</p>

  <p>The melodrama of these words were counteracted by her grave and clear
  accent. "It is impossible," she added.</p>

  <p>The judges did not give way. M. de Tassy made a last effort:</p>

  <p>"The crime was premeditated. You have heard of the wax inserted in the
  baldaquin, of the cord that M. du Boccage wore twisted round his braces, you
  know of the two phials of poison, laudanum and arsenic, he carried in his
  pocket. Come, is it not true that you regarded the death of Madame du
  Boccage, who was so justly outraged against you, as the only chance of your
  return to this household?"</p>

  <p>"I never thought that, therefore it would be impossible for me to inspire
  another with it."</p>

  <p>"We have read your correspondence, Mademoiselle. In these last letters you
  wrote to the Duke you mention several times your hopes for the future, you
  dwell on the paradise of Javiaux du Boccage, you appear to look forward to
  happy days again amid these splendours&mdash;to you so novel, so
  entrancing&mdash;what is the meaning of that?"</p>

  <p>The governess smiled, a convulsive movement of the lips that painfully
  distorted her face: "Can one who is about to commit a frightful crime talk of
  happy days ahead? Is it not well known that when one is guilty that there is
  no more peace or happiness?"</p>

  <p>"Well, then, Mademoiselle, to what did you refer? What was this charming,
  this peaceful future amid the delights of Javiaux du Boccage to be?"</p>

  <p>"Messieurs, I comforted myself with the way of delusion, of dreams, as the
  utterly wretched will. Perhaps, understanding so little of the real
  grievances of Madame du Boccage against me I hoped that she might relent.
  Perhaps I was thinking of the future, when my dear pupils would be all grown
  up&mdash;mothers themselves. Messieurs, how can I recall what I thought of
  when I wrote those letters from the fullness of my heart? All I know was that
  no idea of any crime disturbed me."</p>

  <p>The examiners rose. "Very well. Mademoiselle, you will have nothing
  further to say to us, that is clear. It now only remains to send you before a
  commission of the Chamber of Peers who have been appointed to investigate
  this dismal affair."</p>

  <p>The governess stood up with an almost imperceptible movement of terror:
  "Now, without any preparation?&mdash;with none to advise?"</p>

  <p>"If you are as innocent as you say you need no preparation or advice."</p>

  <p>With a final movement of pride she held her head high, with that peculiar
  carriage that gave her an air of unconquerable fortitude. "Very well,
  Messieurs, I am ready."</p>

  <p>The usher conducted her down the corridor into another room; there a
  high-set window cast a cold light on a table where another group of men
  awaited her. They were representatives of the Chamber of Peers who had been
  appointed to conduct the Du Boccage affair. Most of them had been present at
  the relentless investigation of the dying man in the cell in the Luxembourg
  where another criminal had recently attempted suicide, and some of them had
  been present at the Chateau d'Eu when Louis Philippe, his hand unsteady from
  anguish, had signed the decree for the arrest of his friend, one of the most
  powerful supporters of his House, exclaiming:</p>

  <p>"The wretch! he has done worse than he knows!"</p>

  <p>The chairman of this small committee of aristocrats was M. le Duc
  Pasquier. He leant forward on the table, slightly to the left, for his right
  eye was almost completely covered by a cataract; his huge chin was swathed in
  folds of batiste which came high on his sagging cheeks, on which the white
  whiskers made a sharp line. He was dry, implacable, hard, the only witness of
  the torture of M. du Boccage who had been unmoved, though he had afterwards
  declared&mdash;"it was the most terrible death-bed he had ever, in his long
  experience, known."</p>

  <p>Lucille Debelleyme had always regarded him with instinctive terror; she
  had now some reason for what had been a senseless hatred. She looked away
  from the Chancellor to his companions and sensed at once the difference
  between them and the lawyers and police she had just left; these were not
  official investigators of crime, impartial administrators of justice, but
  gentlemen of high birth, who found themselves in an unprecedented position,
  faced by an unpleasant task, overwhelmed by the disgrace, perhaps the
  distress, brought on their order by this fantastic crime on the part of one
  of their members. In the youngest there, the blond Comte du Bondy,
  Mademoiselle shivered to recognise a certain likeness to M. du Boccage. An
  easy chair was set for her, she was addressed courteously. M. Decaze asked
  her if the sun was in her eyes; none of them stared at her offensively, as
  had her other judges, and one or two were plainly distressed and embarrassed.
  But she knew that in M. Pasquier she had a more terrible opponent than even
  in the iron M. de Tassy.</p>

  <p>He began with a quiet, ruthless onslaught:</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle, I was present, day and night, during the last hours of M.
  du Boccage. I know all. Confess, therefore, your part in this horrible affair
  and let justice be finally satisfied."</p>

  <p>"I have nothing to confess."</p>

  <p>"Think again. I know all." The white-ringed eyes fixed her with contempt.
  Suddenly he demanded: "What were your last words to M. du Boccage?"</p>

  <p>The prisoner's hands tightened on the back of her chair; the picture of
  the room in the Rue Keller was so intense before her eyes that it seemed
  absurd that these men could not see it too; had he, tortured by the arsenic,
  broken by the pitiless interrogation, half delirious, betrayed her? Her last
  words: "I shall expect of you some action."</p>

  <p>"Please answer, Mademoiselle."</p>

  <p>"It is difficult to recall what seemed, at the time, so unimportant.
  Probably&mdash;'Good-bye, Monsieur'&mdash;the children, Isabelle, Cesarine,
  were present, we were all talking together."</p>

  <p>"There was not promise of a further meeting?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Did you think, then, you might never see him again?"</p>

  <p>"Why should I? I believed that I might see him when I went to the Hotel du
  Boccage the following day for my interview with Madame&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Had you any hope of obtaining this certificate of good character, so
  essential to you?"</p>

  <p>"Very little, since I knew Madame had sent the Abbé Galle to urge Madame
  to ask for it."</p>

  <p>"Why, then, did you make this attempt, this appeal?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, Monsieur, will not the desperate, the cornered, make the most
  foolish, the most pitiful of efforts&mdash;of mistakes?"</p>

  <p>"To what do you attribute the ardent desire on the part of so many
  important, intelligent people, to remove you from Paris?"</p>

  <p>"To the unreasonable jealousy of Madame du Boccage, to the relentless
  schemes of her toadies."</p>

  <p>This bold answer astonished them.</p>

  <p>"Do you endeavour to prejudice us against Madame du Boccage, an angel of
  charity, of devotion, of piety, this saint, this martyr? That will not do
  your cause much good, Mademoiselle."</p>

  <p>"I speak the truth as I have seen it before my eyes for two years.
  Saint&mdash;martyr&mdash;what you will&mdash;I know what she made that house.
  I do not defend myself&mdash;why should I? I have nothing to defend. I do not
  lie&mdash;I have no need to lie. I thought you wished from me some
  enlightenment on the cause of this, to you, incomprehensible tragedy&mdash;I
  endeavour to give it to you. Yet I always speak in the dark, for I do not
  know if indeed M. du Boccage murdered his wife."</p>

  <p>"I do," replied M. Pasquire. M. Decaze, tall and elegant, with thinning
  hair and lively eyes, who had been a personal friend of M. du Boccage, here
  asked if he might speak to the prisoner. The Chancellor assented.</p>

  <p>The Due Decaze chose gentle methods.</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle, I was present with the prisoner during those last frightful
  hours of his life. He was guilty and he punished himself. He was my friend
  and I am thankful that he escaped the unspeakable ignominy of a public
  execution."</p>

  <p>"He did not confess?" said the governess, looking steadily at this new
  inquisitor.</p>

  <p>"Not in words."</p>

  <p>"He said nothing of any accomplice, then?"</p>

  <p>"In any case, he would not have said that. He was, at the last, true to
  his breeding. He betrayed no one; he would not even say where he had
  purchased the arsenic."</p>

  <p>"But the police are almost certain that it was at that shop in the Rue
  Keller," put in the Chancellor.</p>

  <p>The governess gave a cry which she quickly explained:</p>

  <p>"My hand&mdash;I clutched the chair&mdash;I was not thinking." She showed
  a bandaged palm. "I hurt myself."</p>

  <p>"How, Mademoiselle?" demanded the Chancellor sternly, suspecting an
  attempt at another suicide. "Were you allowed knives?"</p>

  <p>"No, nor any weapon, nor any cord&mdash;you see, these ugly buttons have
  been put on my shoes that used to lace"&mdash;she put out her pretty foot and
  smiled fixedly. "I blistered my hand before I was arrested. It festers."</p>

  <p>M. le Duc Decaze resumed his examination, which he put on a lofty plane of
  which M. Pasquier cynically disapproved.</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle, before M. du Boccage died he saw a priest, I knelt at the
  head of his bed&mdash;M. l'Abbé de Noirlieu brought him the last
  sacraments&mdash;this calmed him&mdash;he admitted that he was
  relieved&mdash;Voltairean as he was, he declared that he felt more at ease
  and begged for a little crucifix to hold on his breast&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Lucille Debelleyme listened without flinching to this account of the final
  repentance of a fellow atheist.</p>

  <p>"If that is true, it is very extraordinary," she remarked.</p>

  <p>"My word of honour that it is true."</p>

  <p>"Well, Monsieur, is it not also true that the dying suffer from
  hallucinations?"</p>

  <p>M. Decaze was slightly discomposed: she took advantage of that to add:</p>

  <p>"And what is the object of relating this to me?"</p>

  <p>The Due Decaze replied:</p>

  <p>"To soften your heart, to induce you to also ease yourself by a
  repentance, by expiation&mdash;to warn you of that final hour which will come
  to you also when you too will need a priest, a crucifix&mdash;to reveal to
  you the wordless confession of your lover, your accomplice&mdash;to move you
  to give that confession which alone can clear up the mystery of this
  abominable crime&mdash;"</p>

  <p>M. Pasquier, who disliked the sentimental tone of this, added:</p>

  <p>"Come, Mademoiselle, you can no longer avoid giving us the clue to this
  hideous tragedy."</p>

  <p>Lucille Debelleyme rose in one swift movement; she seemed in a second to
  have become the accuser, not the accused.</p>

  <p>"The clue? Look for it then in the character of Madame du Boccage; in the
  actions of this saint and martyr, not in mine, you must look for the causes
  of this crime."</p>

  <p>"What, Mademoiselle, do you mean to insinuate that Madame du Boccage
  deserved her fate? Do you attempt to excuse the murderer by giving faults to
  his victim?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," said the governess erect and rigid; a movement went among the
  men facing her. "Madame du Boccage requires no advocate&mdash;all the world
  is ready to venerate her, to mourn her, to repeat her eulogies. I speak for
  him&mdash;I have just heard he is dead. I will not be disloyal to my one
  friend. I tell you that this saint of yours drove that man mad; through his
  madness she perished, all glorify her. But he&mdash;what has happened to him?
  The worse agony, the most horrible death."</p>

  <p>Even the Chancellor was silent, for she seemed to speak with all her body,
  all her soul, her words were only part of her violent expression of some deep
  passion.</p>

  <p>"Seek, I say, in the nature, in the actions of this stupid, jealous,
  uncontrolled, violent woman, in her rages, her scenes, her espionages, her
  reproaches, her endless letters, her bigotry, her persistent
  pursuit&mdash;not in me&mdash;the causes of this crime. Find in the fury of a
  woman who loved and was not loved the cause of this murder!"</p>

  <p>M. Pasquier rose.</p>

  <p>"Enough. We will hear no more. The prisoner is obdurate. We waste our
  time, our appeals before a heart so hard, a conscience so
  callous&mdash;before a woman capable of no generous impulse, no tender
  sentiment."</p>

  <p>He began to leave his place; the others rose; the Chancellor's almost
  blind eyes turned in the direction where he dimly perceived the prisoner to
  be.</p>

  <p>"Enough of evasion. M. du Boccage was a brute, a monster, his martyred
  wife was a saint, and you, Mademoiselle the governess, I need not name
  you&mdash;you know what you are. The examination is closed."</p>

  <p>For a moment Lucille Debelleyme appeared overwhelmed by this denunciation,
  all the lustre of passion and pride, left her; she remained drooping by the
  chair as the peers began to file out of the narrow door where the usher
  waited. But before the first had left, she had recovered herself.</p>

  <p>"Stop, Messieurs. One thing more." They paused, grouped between the table
  and door, holding their hats and gloves. "Messieurs, you have evoked the
  crucifix. I have seen, in this wretched prison, symbols of the Christian
  faith&mdash;above my bed there also hangs a crucifix&mdash;well, I have this
  to say to you. M. Pasquier has spoken of the Due du Boccage as a monster, he
  has branded me as a creature of nameless infamy&mdash;no doubt you all
  support him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>M. de Bondy, openly agitated, made a gesture of dissent. "Ah,
  then&mdash;not all! I know I speak now, not to the agents of the police, to
  lawyers who see evil everywhere, but to gentlemen. Well, then, this&mdash;if
  M. du Boccage was this monster, if I am an infamous woman&mdash;is it given
  to you to judge?"</p>

  <p>"We act for worldly justice, yes," replied the Chancellor.</p>

  <p>"But you have spoken of God. From men, neither he, dying in atrocious
  torments&mdash;nor I, alone, as I have often been reminded, outcast,
  nameless, homeless, degraded by universal suspicion, have had one word of
  compassion. Not one word of compassion. Monsieur!"</p>

  <p>"You have not deserved it. Mademoiselle," said M. Pasquier.</p>

  <p>"Would not, for that reason, your Christ give it us? Would not your God be
  with us, rather than with her? Already canonised, you say! But I think the
  Christ you quote descended into hell." Looking at her bandaged hand, she
  added: "If he had himself told me he had done this, planned it, I would have
  gone to him, comforted him&mdash;even if it meant drawing suspicion on
  myself. Has not your Christ as much loyalty, as much love as a wretch like
  myself?"</p>

  <p>"Ah!" exclaimed M. Pasquier. "You admit, then, Mademoiselle,
  to&mdash;love?"</p>

  <p>"To love, yes. Not to adultery. Cannot you discern the difference?"</p>

  <p>M. Decaze gently touched the Chancellor on the arm. "The time has passed
  for attempts at traps, my dear friend. Neither has confessed&mdash;it is
  finished. Let us indeed leave them to God." Turning to the young woman he
  said in a lower tone:</p>

  <p>"What is your object in reminding us, Mademoiselle, of Christ's
  compassion?"</p>

  <p>She put her hands to her throat, as if to ease some constriction there,
  and the gesture horribly reminded M. Decaze of M. du Boccage when, no longer
  able to swallow, he had clutched at the muscles atrophied by the action of
  the arsenic.</p>

  <p>"To ask for yours. Whatever he did, he has expiated. Do you not think that
  I shall also? Imagine the rest of my life. I loved him. I loved his
  children&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The Chancellor made a movement of disgust, but M. Decaze and M. de Bondy
  restrained him from speech.</p>

  <p>"Ah, shrink from me. Monsieur Pasquier! You should be satisfied. The more
  I loved, the more I shall be punished. I do not believe in your Christ whom
  you use to frighten children and the dying&mdash;for you, His followers, do
  not follow His impossible example!"</p>

  <p>The young Comte de Bondy broke into hurried, nervous speech:</p>

  <p>"These are dreadful words, Mademoiselle. A priest attended M. du Boccage
  with eager pity&mdash;he could attend you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, for the same purpose, to extort a confession! A priest cast the
  first stone at me, in the Faubourg St. Honoré. I want no priests. But if your
  God were real, I think He would have pitied me."</p>

  <p>"What," asked M. Decaze, "do you want of us?"</p>

  <p>"I said&mdash;your compassion. Your justice, too. Do not leave me with the
  brand of an adulteress&mdash;of murderess." With a sudden drop of speech, of
  look, she added flatly: "I have always been most respectable. I have
  excellent testimonials."</p>

  <p>The peers glanced at each other, all of them were perturbed; those who had
  seen the deathbed of M. du Boccage felt that here was something beyond human
  handling.</p>

  <p>"You want your release?" asked M. Decaze.</p>

  <p>"No, M. le Duc, my exoneration."</p>

  <p>M. de Bondy put in eagerly:</p>

  <p>"What, after all, is there against her? Nothing in her letters, nothing in
  her replies, nothing in her conduct! All that we have to go on is public
  opinion, gossip of servants, the vulgar interpretation of certain
  appearances&mdash;all things which must be rejected by men of reason and
  judgment!"</p>

  <p>M. Pasquier shrugged; he had already heard from M. Mauzisse that the case
  against the governess had completely broken down. This examination before the
  Committee of Peers had been a last attempt to extract a confession; he spoke
  aside to M. Decaze, who said:</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle, this ends your examination. You will hear the result
  to-morrow."</p>

  <p>Caressing her injured hand in silence, the governess made a vague
  salutation.</p>

  <p>As the peers hastened down the dirty corridors of the prison M. de Bondy
  exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"That is a remarkable woman! What imperious grace! What dignity! What
  talent!"</p>

  <p>With a melancholy smile M. Decaze asked:</p>

  <p>"Are you, too, becoming infatuated with Lucille Debelleyme?"</p>

  <p>The young man shuddered:</p>

  <p>"Mon Dieu! I hope I shall never see her again!"</p>

  <p>The next day Lucille Debelleyme was told that she was free.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch52"
     name="ch52">CHAPTER LII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The released prisoner stepped out of a side door of the
  Conciergerie early on a September morning; she wore the pale nankeen dress
  with the white <i>soutache</i> and the straw bonnet with the lilac-coloured
  ruffles, and ribbons which had become famous throughout Paris. As the door
  closed behind her she hesitated; a crowd of journalists, of curious strangers
  awaited her. They pressed round with suggestions, requests, half insolent,
  half inquisitive, wholly malicious.</p>

  <p>What had she to say to the press? To these powerful papers who had led the
  hue and cry against her?</p>

  <p>"Had she not written some memoirs justifying herself while she was in
  prison?"&mdash;"Would she give permission to have her correspondence with M.
  du Boccage published?"&mdash;"Was it true that various scoundrels seeking
  notoriety had offered to marry her?"&mdash;"Where was she going
  now?"&mdash;"What was her name&mdash;so many stories had spread round
  Paris&mdash;was it Lucille Clery, Lucille Debelleyme, Mary Showler&mdash;was
  she English, Italian, Corsican?"&mdash;"Could she not, for one of the more
  enterprising papers, write a story of her life?"</p>

  <p>She leant against the prison door, like the fox when the hounds surround
  him at last; no one had the least pity, they thronged closer with their
  greedy enquiries, their insatiable curiosity...</p>

  <p>She came forward with a sudden movement which caused them to step back,
  then raised her brilliant glance that few could encounter with equanimity,
  and said, with the very essence of scorn:</p>

  <p>"It is permitted, Messieurs, to pass?"</p>

  <p>They fell away, muttering, and one youth showed the chivalry that she had
  disdained to implore; he thrust his notebook in his pocket and, pulling off
  his hat, came forward.</p>

  <p>"Where are you going. Mademoiselle? Can I escort you? I fear it will not
  be very pleasant for you when you are recognised."</p>

  <p>She considered him, he had a fresh, boyish face under his tasselled
  cap.</p>

  <p>"Get a carriage," she said. "There are several waiting outside the
  prison."</p>

  <p>He did so&mdash;then hesitated at the door of the cab after she had got
  in, feeling that here was a lost professional chance; she looked at him
  straightly, unsmiling:</p>

  <p>"I have nothing to tell anyone&mdash;nothing. I have, however, a favour to
  ask."</p>

  <p>"A favour, Mademoiselle?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;can you tell me where M. du Boccage is buried?"</p>

  <p>The young journalist showed troubled reluctance but he could not for long
  resist the insistent gaze of the woman, more imperious than imploring fixed
  upon him.</p>

  <p>"In The Cemetery of the South&mdash;it was very quiet&mdash;at
  night&mdash;the police saw to it for fear of the people&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Where? How might one find it?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know, Mademoiselle&mdash;it was, one understands, a pauper's
  grave."</p>

  <p>"Nothing? No stone? No cross?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, Mademoiselle. What would you? It was a secret burial, no priest,
  no prayers. We wished we could have found out about it but we did not till
  too late."</p>

  <p>Lucille Debelleyme's large eyes, totally void of expression, continued to
  stare at the young man until he coloured and uneasily pulled at his collar,
  and asked her where he should direct the carriage? A denser crowd was already
  beginning to gather; early as it was, others besides the journalists had
  contrived to hear of the release of Lucille Debelleyme.</p>

  <p>"The common ditch," she said without answering his question. "Do you know
  the number?"</p>

  <p>"No-one knows that. Mademoiselle; I assure you it was kept very quiet,
  there was fear of public trouble. Where shall I direct the man?"</p>

  <p>"Tell him to drive on, I will think afterwards where I am going."</p>

  <p>The young man obeyed, then elbowed his way through the other newspaper men
  and the curious who were beginning to surge round the coach and horse.</p>

  <p>So, Lucille Debelleyme drove away from the Conciergerie; she did not know
  where to go, her grandfather, Madame Trou&mdash;she felt ill at the mere
  thought of either St. Cloud or the Rue du Harlay. She had no friend, no money
  beyond the few sous in her bag; she had been obliged to leave her possessions
  in prison until she could give an address to which they could be sent.</p>

  <p>After the cab had driven for a few minutes through the misty September
  morning, the man stopped, got down off the box and asked his passenger where
  she intended to go? Lucille Debelleyme gave the address of Monsieur Santerre;
  she added aloud: "Perhaps they will take me in."</p>

  <p>The man stared at her, grumbled something uncivil under his breath,
  mounted the box and drove to the narrow street near the railway station where
  the Santerres lived.</p>

  <p>Mademoiselle Debelleyme herself rang the bell; she smiled into the face of
  the woman who opened the door and who instantly retreated with a movement of
  horror, putting her hands to her mouth.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is I, Lucille Debelleyme&mdash;you know all that has happened. I
  have nowhere to go, will you take me in, even for one night?"</p>

  <p>No one in Paris had followed the tragedy of the Hotel du Boccage with more
  horrified interest than this old servant of the murdered Duchess, no one had
  lamented Fanny du Boccage more bitterly nor cried out more frequently and
  vehemently bitter imprecations on the head of the governess, but when this
  simple, superstitious woman saw Lucille Debelleyme, whom justice had
  dismissed, against whom no proof could be found but who was dishonoured,
  ruined, penniless, she only hesitated a moment. The strongest motive in her
  startled mind was that of her sincere but conventional piety. The sinner must
  not be turned away, the penitent must not be suffered to depart, a creature
  in despair must not be allowed to do a deed of violence.</p>

  <p>"Come upstairs, your old room is empty&mdash;you remember, you had it the
  night you came to Paris."</p>

  <p>"I remember."</p>

  <p>She opened her bag and paid the coachman and followed Madame Santerre, who
  crossed herself continually, up to the little room with the cheap crucifix
  above the bed and the high window looking out over Paris.</p>

  <p>Madame Santerre, in a timid voice, asked if she should get her
  anything&mdash;Refreshments? Coffee? Water?</p>

  <p>"I was offered all that in the prison, but could not take it then and
  cannot take it now."</p>

  <p>"A priest, shall I send a priest?"</p>

  <p>The governess shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I have only need of a little repose, to be by myself. I shall soon think
  of something&mdash;I shall not trouble you for long. I must find
  strength."</p>

  <p>Madame Santerre, overawed, hesitated by the door. She could not take her
  gaze from her fearful visitor.</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle, you would not disgrace me? I want to be charitable. You
  would not here... "</p>

  <p>"Kill myself?" finished the governess. "No, I can promise you that.
  Besides, I have nothing, neither knife nor poison. Perhaps that may come to
  me presently, but not now, not here. Be reassured."</p>

  <p>As the humble woman still remained horror-stricken and trembling,
  reluctant in the doorway. Mademoiselle Debelleyme, who had thrown off her
  bonnet, said:</p>

  <p>"Can you do me one favour? Can you tell me the number of the grave of M.
  du Boccage in The Cemetery of the South?"</p>

  <p>Madame Santerre burst into convulsive sobs and rubbed her eyes with her
  rough apron, exclaiming:</p>

  <p>"Oh, how can you ask me that?&mdash;how dare you ask me that! Oh,
  Mademoiselle, what a frightful thing to ask!"</p>

  <p>"Why should I not ask, Madame Santerre? Why should I be ashamed to speak
  his name? Come, you must know. All his servants and dependants know, or am I
  to go to the Comte Edouard or even to his mother?"</p>

  <p>Madame Santerre's cries and sobs redoubled:</p>

  <p>"Oh, you must not go to her! I entreat you not to go to her! She knows
  nothing. The old Maréchal Frediani went himself to comfort her, he has begged
  everyone not to tell her, she thinks it was illness, she is blind, she is
  old, she knows nothing!"</p>

  <p>"No need to tell me all that," said the governess. "I understand the
  situation very well. Come, will you give me this number?"</p>

  <p>"I believe, Mademoiselle, that it is one thousand and fifty-four."</p>

  <p>The woman turned and fled, crossing herself again as if she hastened away
  from some tangible evil.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch53"
     name="ch53">CHAPTER LIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">During the time that she had been in the Conciergerie
  Lucille Debelleyme had contrived to reflect on nothing, to analyse nothing,
  to permit herself neither regrets nor hopes, to blot out her personality in
  her situation. She had lived from moment to moment, concerning herself only
  with maintaining her fortitude and baffling the efforts of her enemies to
  extort from her dangerous confessions. She had read stupid verses until she
  knew them by heart, she had counted up to fantastic numbers, she had made up
  poems, exercises in English, French and Italian, she had drawn elaborate
  geometric designs, she had arranged patterns for embroidery with the pencil
  and paper given her, and so she had contrived with mechanical actions of her
  hands and lips and by an exercise of an extraordinary willpower to keep
  realisation away from her.</p>

  <p>Now the strain was over, she was free, she was not overlooked, not spied
  on, she did not need to keep herself taut and alert for fear the door would
  suddenly open and some unfriendly face look round hoping to surprise her in
  disorder, in despair.</p>

  <p>Now she could no longer prevent herself from thinking, she locked the
  door, turning the clumsy great key with quivering hands and threw herself on
  the straight, hard bed, beneath the crucifix.</p>

  <p>"He is dead." She could no longer keep that fact at arm's length. That
  time he had rushed from her&mdash;from the room above the chemist's shop in
  the Rue Keller had been an eternal farewell; he and all he meant was gone
  from her life for ever.</p>

  <p>For their mutual frustration, their mutual tragedy she blamed herself.</p>

  <p>"I went too far, I ought to have known with whom I dealt. I did know he
  was obtuse, not very intelligent, in the depths of his nature violent and
  savage. I should have seen he was being so driven that he did not know what
  he did. I should not have held off. Now there is not even that to
  remember&mdash;that I was once in his arms&mdash;frustrated, thwarted. If I
  had not denied him he would not have done it."</p>

  <p>She dared, for the first time, to try to reconstruct the crime. "Had he
  gone straight from her to the apartment of his sleeping wife, crept in, a
  murderer indeed, and struck at the wretched woman in her sleep? So his
  accusers said. There had been no quarrel, no recrimination? Had he turned,
  like a creature at bay, and destroyed savagely what tormented him?"</p>

  <p>"How was it done, how long did she suffer, how soon did he come to his
  senses, when did he take the poison? How they must have tortured him! Death
  by arsenic, I have heard what that means. Why did he not take the laudanum?
  And the cord? Was he lying when he told me he had taken that from her, or did
  he intend to use it for her destruction, or for mine, or for his own? And the
  baldaquin&mdash;I remember when I first saw it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>All this tumult of horrified speculation passed into an agony of
  loneliness. That was her predominant feeling. She had been robbed of the one
  person whom she loved, who would have protected her, stood by her, who
  understood her...</p>

  <p>She sat up suddenly on the bed, jerked to that posture by the sheer
  violence of her emotion, and put her fingers to her throat as if she would
  strangle herself with her own hands.</p>

  <p>The waste of it, the pity of it, and they had dared to cast him into a
  pauper's grave&mdash;he who had gloried in the magnificence of Javiaux du
  Boccage&mdash;he so proud, so gay, so fine.</p>

  <p>She began to weep, and these, the first tears she had shed, were drawn
  from her by sheer pity for his body, distorted with the convulsions of the
  poison, mutilated with the surgeon's knife, rotting in the earth, lost, gone,
  wasted.</p>

  <p>"I always knew that to think of it, to pause, to realise, would be to give
  way&mdash;to give way is damnation&mdash;well, that has happened now."</p>

  <p>She wondered, in bitter fury, what had kept her up so long, why she had so
  tenaciously and so skilfully defended this life, this liberty which were so
  barren and so useless? She scorned now her own instinct of self-preservation,
  her own indomitable pride which had given her such incredible courage. Yet
  even now, almost against her own will, she dragged herself out of engulfing
  despair. There was one thing she might do, one person to whom she might turn
  for some comfort.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch54"
     name="ch54">CHAPTER LIV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The Dowager Duchesse du Boccage sat by a bright fire, for
  the autumn days were damp. Her face was in shadow, for she was sitting in a
  deeply-hooded leather chair, but the firelight showed her fine blue-veined
  hands grasping a small brass crucifix. She was in a complete bewilderment of
  grief; these two sudden deaths, apoplexy, cholera, one after the other
  without any farewells! Not all the tender soothing of her son, the caresses
  of her daughters, the consolations of the Maréchal Frediani, of her friends,
  could wholly erase from the blind woman the terror that something worse than
  sudden death had occurred. Camille and Fanny! So suddenly, so soon!</p>

  <p>Her maid told her with tender respect (the gentle lady was well loved by
  everyone who knew her) that a young woman wished to see her; she had come to
  solicit some personal charity and had mentioned the name of l'Abbé Galle.
  Such visitors were not infrequent in the apartment in the Faubourg St.
  Germain where Madame du Boccage spent a peaceful and benevolent old age.</p>

  <p>Yet she hesitated, for this was an intrusion on her grief, her mourning,
  her rigid retirement from all social duties. She made some anxious
  enquiries&mdash;the maid said it was a young woman who was veiled and seemed
  in much trouble, she had wept as she had made her plea to be allowed to see
  Madame la Duchesse du Boccage.</p>

  <p>"Admit her, then, Clarise, one must not be cold to the grief of others
  because one has so heavy a sorrow oneself."</p>

  <p>As the blind woman waited in her hooded, chair by the fire, her hands
  still nervously holding the small crucifix sent her by her dead son, and
  which she could not bear out of her touch; she heard her maid return and
  another step beside that of Clarise.</p>

  <p>She said kindly:</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle, you have been sent to me by l'Abbé Galle? Pray come
  forward; I am, unfortunately, blind but I can hear very well."</p>

  <p>Lucille Debelleyme came to the fireside and stood erect, looking down on
  the old, helpless woman. She was staring, she knew, at the one person in
  Paris who had not been told her story, to whom her name had not been
  mentioned with abhorrence, to whom all her actions had not been depicted in a
  bad light, the one person in Paris, in France, who did not know of the
  tragedy in the Faubourg St. Honoré, the one person who could speak of Camille
  du Boccage with love and respect.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" asked the blind woman into the silence. "Have you a message
  from the Abbé Galle? Where are you? I hear nothing."</p>

  <p>"Madame, I have no message, I used his name to gain admittance."</p>

  <p>Lucille Debelleyme, peering closely into the shadows of the hooded chair,
  saw the old woman move uneasily.</p>

  <p>"I know that voice though I have not heard it for some time. Who are
  you?"</p>

  <p>"I am Lucille Debelleyme; I was your daughter-in-law's governess. You used
  to be kind to me."</p>

  <p>The old lady raised the hands holding the small crucifix and placed them
  on her breast.</p>

  <p>"Why have you stayed away so long? Why do you come now? What do you
  want?"</p>

  <p>"I have not been able to come before, I was ill, what I want is a little
  pity, a little friendship."</p>

  <p>"I do not understand, Mademoiselle Debelleyme&mdash;are you in trouble,
  distress? I heard that you had left, that you were no longer in charge of my
  grandchildren? Why is that?"</p>

  <p>"This double bereavement overwhelms me, Madame, I thought you were the one
  person to whom I might speak of... "</p>

  <p>She cut her sentence off short and the blind woman, leaning forward, asked
  anxiously:</p>

  <p>"Speak of what?"</p>

  <p>"Of your son, of M. du Boccage."</p>

  <p>"Why do you want to come to me to speak of him?"</p>

  <p>"Because there is no one else."</p>

  <p>She approached the old woman, bending down and speaking in, a low, rapid
  voice:</p>

  <p>"I am in great trouble, I hardly know what to do. You are the person who
  might save me."</p>

  <p>"Save you from what, Mademoiselle?" The lady shrank back, inexplicable
  terror possessed her, she felt on the brink of some insupportable
  knowledge.</p>

  <p>"What is that crucifix you hold so tightly, so constantly, Madame? Did he
  send it to you?" As she spoke she thought: "If only I could get that
  crucifix&mdash;the last thing he touched&mdash;was he thinking of me? He
  never betrayed me, no, my darling, you kept our secret though they tortured
  you so&mdash;and so did I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Madame du Boccage felt small, cold fingers close over hers eagerly,
  greedily.</p>

  <p>She called loudly:</p>

  <p>"Clarise, Clarise!"</p>

  <p>Lucille Debelleyme drew back to the other side of the hearth, and the
  maid, who never stayed long from her blind mistress, instantly entered,
  alert, apprehensive.</p>

  <p>"Clarise, I do not know who this is here but she must not stay, send her
  away!"</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle, please leave at once!" cried the alarmed maid; "you have
  disturbed Madame la Duchesse!"</p>

  <p>"You know who I am," urged Lucille Debelleyme, "do you send me away?"</p>

  <p>"I entreat you to go at once, I have nothing for you, I can have nothing.
  I was told that you had left the Hotel du Boccage and that I must not speak
  of you."</p>

  <p>"More Christian charity," whispered Lucille Debelleyme, staring at the
  crucifix, "more Christian compassion."</p>

  <p>"Please go, Mademoiselle," said Clarise, firmly, standing in front of her
  mistress, "as Madame has requested."</p>

  <p>The visitor ignored the servant.</p>

  <p>"Madame du Boccage&mdash;might I&mdash;once&mdash;just touch that
  crucifix? In charity?"</p>

  <p>"She is mad," whispered the old lady, afraid. "There has been some trouble
  of which I have not heard&mdash;what has she to do with Camille?"</p>

  <p>"If you would let me hold the crucifix I might tell you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Suddenly, and with the utmost horror, realising the identity of the
  intruder, Clarise cried with vehemence:</p>

  <p>"Begone at once! M. de Frediani is expected any instant; he will know how
  to deal with you!"</p>

  <p>Lucille Debelleyme glided away; catching hold of the warm familiar hand of
  her maid the Duchess asked timidly:</p>

  <p>"Has she gone?"</p>

  <p>"She has gone, Madame. Oh, pray do not disturb yourself. I will see that
  she does not come again," and pretending she had not recognised the visitor:
  "Who was it?&mdash;can you give me her name that I may caution the servants
  not to admit her again?"</p>

  <p>Ejected by aversion, by fear, Lucille Debelleyme descended the stairs of
  the fine house in the Faubourg St. Germain.</p>

  <p>Outside she saw a familiar figure descending from a handsome
  carriage&mdash;the Maréchal Frediani, who had come with that flamboyant
  chivalry that all Paris so much admired to console the unsuspecting mother of
  his daughter's murderer.</p>

  <p>Lucille Debelleyme, with her veil across her bonnet, stood and looked at
  him. She recalled how she and her grandfather had once laughed over an
  anecdote concerning this old soldier; sent to restore order in Poland, he had
  massacred all the revolutionaries and sent back an ironic message: "Peace in
  Warsaw."</p>

  <p>She began to laugh as the old man, whose bearing had not been altered by
  age but who now stooped under the shock of an overwhelming grief, turned up
  the great steps of the house, and he at this dreadful sound, turned and
  glanced over his shoulder.</p>

  <p>She took a step towards him:</p>

  <p>"Peace in the Faubourg St. Honoré, M. Le Maréchal!" she said and turned
  quickly in the direction of The Cemetery of the South.</p>

  <p>She found his grave, with weariness that she did not notice and
  difficulties that she ignored, after walking through the long avenues of
  tombs, heavy, sombre, ironic temples to the dead, avenues of straight poplar
  and hard Cyprus, blue-black in the September sunshine, past solitary
  crape-clad mourners, grave-diggers and guardians. There, in the large
  communal grave, was number one thousand and fifty-four. There was no name, no
  date... The ground round about was trampled by the feet of the curious, the
  journalists who must write something more for their papers, the morbid whose
  appetite for the horrible must be whetted, by perhaps a few who had come
  secretly, to say a prayer.</p>

  <p>There was no one in sight and dusk was falling; the sun retreated, in
  sinking waves of light behind the tombs. Lucille Debelleyme lay down full
  length on the damp earth and, closing her eyes, pressed against the heap of
  clay broken by the sexton's spade as closely as if she embraced his
  form&mdash;as if her frantic grasp could penetrate earth, oak boards, linen,
  and seize him in her arms. Her most bitter regret was for his body that was
  now so close under her own but which she would never see or touch again.</p>

     name="ch55">CHAPTER LV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It was nearly dark when she again rang the bell of Madame
  Santerre's small house. She had neither eaten, nor drunk, nor rested all day.
  She was not aware of any fatigue, only of a lightness in her head. It was M.
  Santerre who opened the door this time, as quickly as if he had been in
  readiness, waiting behind the door. He looked at her eyes gleaming behind the
  veil, he could see no more of her face than that. Her thin shoes were covered
  with mud, the white braid of her dress, to which fragments of dead leaves and
  earth were clinging, was dirty, her gloves were torn and her bag was hanging
  open and empty on her arm.</p>

  <p>"You must not come in," he said quickly, "my wife was too kind. I will not
  have it, you must go away at once."</p>

  <p>"Where to? Where am I to go?"</p>

  <p>"Some priest, some charity; there are places for such as you. You do not
  come into my house, you bring a curse with you, you would attract on me the
  attention of all Paris. Begone." He closed the door in her face.</p>

  <p>Lucille Debelleyme turned away; she began to walk faster and faster
  through the twilight. As she reached the more frequented streets she broke
  into a run, she had only one thought, one desire&mdash;immediate
  extinction.</p>

  <p>Too impatient to wait until she reached the river, she intended to throw
  herself under a passing vehicle and she hurried eagerly to the streets where
  the traffic was most dense. Turning a corner sharply in her headlong flight,
  which was causing the passers-by to turn and gaze curiously at her, she found
  herself on the steps of a lighted doorway where the bright glow of the
  unscreened gas fell on various placards and notices which showed that this
  was a church, a Protestant church, and that the preacher was one Frédéric
  Monet.</p>

  <p>This light, this doorway, this name seemed to Lucille Debelleyme to surge
  up in front of her out of an utter blackness; she was suddenly conscious of
  an acute, overwhelming fatigue. She made a movement forward as if to catch at
  those placards for support&mdash;she was in the doorway, then in the church
  and had sunk on a bench&mdash;the first to which she had come.</p>

  <p>Frédéric Monet was preaching; the interior of the building, the service,
  the congregation, all reminded her of her English days when she had had to
  lead her charges to a Protestant church. She wondered what had brought her
  here, where she was... She fixed her dazed eyes on the tall, gaunt man who,
  at once fervid and monotonous, preached of submission to the will of God, of
  patience, of resignation.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch56"
     name="ch56">CHAPTER LVI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Pastor Frédéric Monet reluctantly left his church with the
  sense of discouragement that comes to an actor who, though successful, has
  not been, through convention, applauded. His faith was also his art and his
  livelihood, he had put into it all the aspirations of a simple heart, all the
  strength of a mediocre intelligence, he was most completely himself when he
  was preaching about the terrors of sin, the beauties of repentance and the
  joys of forgiveness of God.</p>

  <p>When he was in the pulpit he became wrapped in an exultation that
  sometimes touched ecstasy; the reaction when he had to leave the empty church
  was always in proportion to his enthusiasm. He felt a vague melancholy, a
  slight disappointment, to think of all these people who had listened to him
  so silently, who should have been so impressed, scattering, passing away into
  trivialities of their daily lives, without, it seemed, either acknowledgment
  of his powers or need of his administrations. It was true that he knew some
  of his flock and that some of them came to him with their troubles but these
  were always very ordinary, and Frédéric Monet, a born missionary, a fervent,
  earnest believer in the mercies of God and the traps of the devil, had, he
  felt regretfully, so far neither met one nor the other, and his pleasant,
  amiable, hard-working ordinary life had not brought him into touch with the
  dramas of either crime or repentance.</p>

  <p>The verger was following the pastor round the church, extinguishing the
  gas-lamps, and Frédéric Monet lingered reluctantly, leaving the church with
  the regret of one who leaves a scene of what should have been a triumph. As
  he reached the door he saw that one member of the congregation was still
  seated on the bench directly inside the door. She was neither praying nor, it
  seemed by the inattentive droop in her attitude, waiting for him.</p>

  <p>He looked at her sideways, his attention attracted by her pale, elegant
  nankeen dress trimmed with white <i>soutache</i>, her torn gloves, the
  reticule hanging open on her arm, the bits of dead leaves and earth that
  clung to her dress, her thin shoes stained and trodden down, her straw bonnet
  with the crumpled lilac strings.</p>

  <p>"One of the unfortunates of the street," thought the pastor in automatic
  disgust, that he instantly and shamefacedly repressed.</p>

  <p>As he approached the young woman she did not move; a glance at her pale,
  refined face with the dosed eyes and the parted lips changed his opinion. A
  lady, after all, and her clothes in good taste and well made. Her state of
  exhaustion then and the disorder of her attire must be the result of some
  frightful accident.</p>

  <p>The pastor felt excited. Was she in trouble, and had she, hearing of his
  eloquence, his tolerance, his enthusiasm, come to him?</p>

  <p>His hesitation left him as he came up to her with the eager firmness of
  the shepherd who has unmistakably espied the lost sheep entangled on the
  briars.</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle... Mademoiselle... I fear you are ill. Can I be of any
  service to you?" He half feared she was unconscious but she opened her eyes
  and gave him a glance so bright and clear that he felt a faint
  uneasiness.</p>

  <p>"You are the pastor Frédéric Monet?"</p>

  <p>Pleased, he nodded.</p>

  <p>"I listened to your sermon, it applied exactly to my case."</p>

  <p>"Then do not say," replied the clergyman earnestly, flushing with
  pleasure, "that you were brought here by chance. God directed you."</p>

  <p>The young woman smiled:</p>

  <p>"Perhaps."</p>

  <p>She tried to rise but, too faint to hold herself on her feet, sank again
  on the bench. The verger, interested and prying, paused behind the pastor and
  waited to turn out the last gas-lamp by the door.</p>

  <p>"You are in need of succour, Mademoiselle? You are in some distress?"</p>

  <p>"I am in deep distress."</p>

  <p>"Will you confide in me&mdash;will you trust me? That is my duty and my
  privilege&mdash;to help all."</p>

  <p>"Even the outcast and the despised?" and again she gave him that glance
  that seemed in its blazing vitality so out of place with the drooping
  exhaustion of her appearance.</p>

  <p>"Those more than any," replied the pastor, firmly; his earnestness, his
  honest goodness were unmistakable.</p>

  <p>The young woman, who despite her emotional upheaval could read him at a
  glance, said:</p>

  <p>"I will tell you first who I am. I have been let out of the Conciergerie
  this morning. I am friendless and dishonoured. I have just been turned from
  the doors of an acquaintance, I am penniless." She rose, supporting herself
  against the drab, painted plaster wall. "I am Lucille Debelleyme."</p>

  <p>Then the pastor did wince and the verger, close behind him, was unable to
  repress a forward movement of greedy curiosity.</p>

  <p>No one had read the flamboyant accounts of the tragedy of the Hotel du
  Boccage with more sincere horror than had Frédéric Monet and, though he
  strove so hard to be charitable to the worst of sinners, he had not been able
  to think of Lucille Debelleyme without a deep aversion.</p>

  <p>She noticed his trouble.</p>

  <p>"No doubt, Monsieur, you have followed my case in all its details, yet you
  can know very little of my story. I was examined in secret&mdash;I had no
  advisers, no lawyers, no friends. No one put forward my side of the question,
  but unable to find the least evidence against me they have released me. It
  seems," and her voice sank lower, "that they might as well have sent me to
  the guillotine, for I perceive I am become an object from which even the
  charitable shrink."</p>

  <p>Frédéric Monet was instantly ashamed of his movement of dismay; he
  reminded himself that there was nothing against this woman but the evil
  tongues of the multitude. Human justice, rather, human malice had not been
  able to discover that she was guilty; it was not for him to judge, nor by as
  much as a look to turn her from seeking the Mercy of God.</p>

  <p>He grasped her small cold hand in the torn glove in his large fingers, and
  said with deepest sincerity:</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle, I am ready to believe there is no evil in you. You are in a
  terrible situation, the knowledge of your own innocence must be your major
  support."</p>

  <p>Lucille Debelleyme smiled at this banality which happened to be the exact
  truth, and pulled away her hand from his, for his friendly grasp made her
  think of another, when such different fingers, so powerful, had closed round
  her own. M. Monet, in his black frock-coat, his grey whiskers, his portly
  build, had a look of M. de Tassy.</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle, you are a Protestant?" he urged anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am a Protestant. In my despair I turned here&mdash;my instinct was
  to destroy myself but something... "</p>

  <p>"It was God," exclaimed the pastor, "who saved you from that desperate
  crime!"</p>

  <p>He waited, with a certain bewilderment, a certain delicacy, for her to
  explain herself further; she stared round the ugly building, the walls of
  slate-coloured paint, the deep-set, dusty windows, black in their recesses,
  the gas globes on iron arms, the rows of cheap benches shining with harsh
  yellowish varnish; the House of God! There was something in that absurdity
  that distracted her acute agony. Nowhere did she see the symbol that had
  become to her one of mockery, that reminded her both of the cruelty of man
  and a denied love token&mdash;the crucifix.</p>

  <p>She glanced vaguely from the pastor to the verger, who, in the yellow,
  wavering light of the last gas-lamp, was staring at her with such unabashed
  curiosity; his keys hung in his hand.</p>

  <p>"You think, both of you, that I am guilty? I suppose all Paris thinks so.
  I know I am without a friend. No doubt the most terrible stories have been
  spread about me, but the truth&mdash;no one would guess that!"</p>

  <p>"You were a Protestant," exclaimed the pastor, "in the midst of the Roman
  Catholics! Madame du Boccage, poor woman was a bigot, is it
  possible&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Lucille Debelleyme flashed him a clear audacious glance:</p>

  <p>"It is true that I was persecuted for my religion by the priest, the
  Duchess herself, all of them&mdash;the Duke tried to rescue his children and
  confide them to me. We were never more than friends. Consider, was it
  likely?&mdash;he never saw me except when his children were present."</p>

  <p>Why was she saying this, trying to make these two ridiculous men, in their
  hideous building, believe her? From desire, after all, to live, or from
  natural mechanical duplicity? She did not herself know but she continued
  quietly to defend herself, like an automaton wound up to go through a routine
  of words and gestures.</p>

  <p>To the naive honest man who listened she was the very picture of
  persecuted innocence; a Protestant at the mercy of Papist cabals! Why had he
  not thought of that before? He should have rushed to her defence&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle, you have no need&mdash;before me&mdash;to defend yourself
  from charges so infamous."</p>

  <p>He spoke sincerely; it was really impossible for him to associate this
  delicate creature with any crime. He had already come to an astounding
  resolution, he would rise to this moment, he would give his utmost, he would
  not offer the cold, sneering charity of the Pharisees, he would not suggest
  some Home for the destitute and the outcast... No, his own hearth, his own
  pious wife, his own pure daughters...</p>

  <p>"You are friendless, Mademoiselle&mdash;penniless&mdash;you have nowhere
  to go?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I thought of the river but it seemed too far, I have not eaten all
  day."</p>

  <p>"Come with me at once. Mademoiselle Debelleyme, my wife will welcome you,
  my daughters will treat you as a sister. You shall find that true charity,
  tolerance, kindness does exist&mdash;even in Paris."</p>

  <p>The absurdity of this last phrase caused a smile that he interpreted as a
  flicker of gratitude to distort the pale lips of the governess; he said to
  the gaping verger:</p>

  <p>"Go and call a cab. Bring it immediately to the door."</p>

  <p>As the man, still staring over his shoulder, reluctantly shuffled away.
  Mademoiselle Debelleyme lightly laid her hand on the excited pastor's rough
  sleeve.</p>

  <p>"You are taking me to your wife, to your daughters&mdash;you a Christian
  clergyman! Well, I am innocent&mdash;I can swear it."</p>

  <p>She turned towards the distant altar that was only a gathered blot of
  shadows in the deep murk of the chapel. She lifted her hand and said
  distinctly:</p>

  <p>"I take God to witness that I am neither an adulteress nor a murderess. M.
  du Boccage was not my lover and I did not inflame him to murder his
  wife."</p>

  <p>She turned her wild stare on the pastor and added:</p>

  <p>"Why should people not believe me? Is it that everyone has a mind so foul
  that they cannot conceive of virtue? But you, you perhaps can credit what
  seems to so many an incredible truth."</p>

  <p>She caught him up into her emotion; he became her champion, her defender,
  he was subtly flattered, greatly moved.</p>

  <p>"I believe you," he declared solemnly, as if he gave an absolution.</p>

  <p>She turned her head aside without replying; when her chin drooped she
  noticed the earth, the dead leaves still on her dress and remembered where
  they came from. With a shriek, such as the pastor had never heard from human
  lips before, she fell awkwardly against him. The verger hurried in panting,
  aghast at this unparalleled excitement; between them they lifted the light
  weight of Lucille Debelleyme and carried her to the hired cab.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch57"
     name="ch57">CHAPTER LVII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The pastor Monet's supper was ready, the fire was burning
  cheerfully, the lamp in the large, opal globe lit, the wife was hastening, in
  a kindly fashion, the one little maid in the final preparation of the last
  meal.</p>

  <p>At a side table in the pleasant parlour Louise Monet was illuminating a
  text; one of the beatitudes, "Blessed are the pure in heart," began to
  flourish in gold and scarlet under her pen. Her sister Hortense sat beside
  her knitting a curly tippet in white Iceland wool. She had recently recovered
  from a slight attack of bronchitis and it was anxiety on her behalf and the
  unexpected dampness of the autumn day which had kept the family at home
  instead of attending as usual the Thursday service of the husband and father
  at the Chapel of the Oratory. The demoiselles Monet were plain young women
  with pallid complexions and greasy hair, their teeth were irregular and they
  had a tendency to pimples and violent attacks of indigestion. There was only
  a year between them and they were exactly alike, similar too in their sweet
  and patient dispositions. Pliant, stupid and obedient, they had inherited
  their father's unwavering piety and absorbed their mother's conventional
  decorum so successfully that they had become in all the utmost that their
  parents could have wished. The flame of their unblemished goodness flickered
  brightly even after five years' residence in the corruption which they were
  well aware blighted the capital; their father, though anxious at first as to
  the wisdom of transporting these two innocents from a small country town to
  the hectic wickedness of Paris, had long since had his fears allayed. The
  virtue of Louise and Hortense Monet was such as could walk unspotted through
  the streets of Babylon; they lived as removed from the world about them as
  fishes swimming in a bowl are removed from the room that houses them. Louise
  was going to be a missionary in China, Hortense was betrothed to a young man
  of whom her parents completely approved.</p>

  <p>A tall, robust youth leant against the mantelpiece, and stared at the two
  girls absorbed in their work. He was an American, in training for holy
  orders, one Nathaniel Meadows, a distant relative of Madame Monet, who came
  of a well-known Evangelical family from New York.</p>

  <p>He had had no experience of anything except the most rigid Puritanism, and
  no thought of rebellion against the uncomfortable tenets in which he had been
  so vigorously schooled ever crossed a mind obtuse, self-satisfied, narrow.
  The least suggestion of any infringement of that code of morals that he
  considered had been drawn up by God Himself shocked him profoundly. But his
  appearance was that of a strong, kindly animal; there was a look of a drowsy
  young bull about his heavy head and shoulders, the dark red curls, the full
  features and the brown eyes, expressing a rather dazed kind of nobility. His
  ill-cut clothes of expensive materials were outlandishly ugly, and his
  movements were awkward.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, an impetuous opening of doors, the blowing in of the chill,
  foggy autumn air, exclamations, a search for change to pay for this unusual
  luxury of a cab, for vinegar, for eau-de-Cologne, broken explanations and an
  unconscious stranger was laid on the gleaming horse-hair sofa drawn near the
  fire. Madame Monet, experienced, capable, kindly, soon had the situation in
  hand. No spirits were ever allowed in the house but a glass of home-made
  cordial, highly alcoholic, was forced between the rigid lips of the
  unconscious young woman, while the girls gently drew off the straw bonnet
  with the crumpled lilac ribbon, drew from the cold fingers the torn gloves
  and from the feet, bruised from running, the thin, soiled slippers. The
  family Monet experienced all the righteous joy of the good Samaritan, they
  glowed with the pleasure of putting into practice long-smouldering
  virtues.</p>

  <p>Not without grandeur, his eyes sparkling with a fanatic charity, the
  pastor addressed his wife:</p>

  <p>"Marthe, this is Mademoiselle Debelleyme," then as the name made them all
  pause in alarm, he added quickly: "she has sworn to me on the table of the
  Lord that she is innocent. She came to me in her great trouble, she is a
  Protestant, she turned to a Protestant for succour."</p>

  <p>He spoke quite sincerely, for he had already forgotten that the young
  woman had told him that it was by chance she had turned into his church. He
  saw her now and would always see her as running straight from the doors of
  the Conciergerie to the refuge of the Oratory.</p>

  <p>"It is a test," he added excitedly, "a test of our faith. I would not send
  her to hospital, to some public organisation&mdash;I have brought her here to
  my own hearth, to my own wife and daughters. Tell me, Marthe, have I done
  right?"</p>

  <p>"You have shown courage," she said, looking at him with admiration. "No
  one else in Paris would have done as much."</p>

  <p>"She is friendless&mdash;she is penniless&mdash;despised and rejected of
  men, Marthe," he continued with rising enthusiasm, "she has been greatly
  wronged. I believe her oath, she was persecuted because she was a
  Protestant."</p>

  <p>The three honest women drew a deep breath of horror, of understanding.
  Hortense pityingly flicked away some dead leaves and earth which clung to the
  bodice of the unconscious victim of the Romish Church; Madame Monet bathed
  the poor fallen head, so richly adorned with pale curls, with her
  handkerchief wrung out in eau-de-Cologne and water. This practical New
  Englander relied on her husband in everything and she wholeheartedly accepted
  his verdict in the matter of Lucille Debelleyme. She was eager to step into
  the position of protector of the innocent, champion of the maligned,
  especially as the persecution of the Protestants was the only portion of the
  story of the human race that she knew, and she knew that well indeed; so that
  had been the cause of the whole tragedy! She could believe it without
  hesitation, without difficulty. The poor young woman, staunchly Protestant,
  had been set upon, in a household of Roman Catholics, led by Jesuits
  probably&mdash;it was generally the Jesuits&mdash;</p>

  <p>They all began to talk together in low, excited tones. How everything
  fitted in! "Yes... yes... that was it, of course&mdash;a Protestant against a
  crowd of Catholics&mdash;what slander, what lies!"</p>

  <p>The actual murder they shut out of their consideration, not mentioning it,
  not thinking of it. The man had been driven mad of course by the scandalous
  attacks of the priests. No need to dwell on that.</p>

  <p>Lucille Debelleyme stirred and sat up. Her bodice was open at the neck,
  drops of water were on her cheeks and her curls lay damp and dark on her
  forehead.</p>

  <p>The pastor and his family gazed at her almost with veneration; compassion
  had passed into respect, pity into a fervent championship. All of them had
  forgotten Nathaniel Meadows; he stood on the verge of the group, half in the
  shadows, straining his attention to understand the situation. He could only
  partially grasp the meaning of the rapid French phrases, but he caught again
  and again the two famous names of Du Boccage and Lucille Debelleyme...</p>

  <p>The young American had read (with a fascinated horror of which he was
  secretly ashamed) all the sickening details of the crime which had shaken
  France, but he had resisted, not without an effort, an unworthy curiosity
  which had urged him to go to the Conciergerie to obtain a glimpse of the
  mysterious heroine of this dreadful affair. But he had not resisted what he
  feared was a base attraction and had continuously turned his mind to
  contemplation of this tragedy of lust, corruption and violence. And here was
  this suspect, this woman who had been called names which the young Puritan
  would not dare bring across his lips, lying on the familiar horse-hair sofa
  by the sacred hearth of the spotless Madame Monet, being, he was sure,
  praised, commiserated...</p>

  <p>He approached eagerly, he had never really seen a beautiful woman so close
  before, nor any woman in such emotional upheaval, in such physical
  disarray.</p>

  <p>Before they had noticed him he had stared greedily at her throat, her
  hands, her feet, the long pale curls, the fine features, the rich,
  close-fitting elegant gown... Lucille Debelleyme from the Conciergerie, a
  wronged, persecuted, friendless woman... he immediately saw her through a
  blaze of romantic glory as he eagerly watched these blameless, angelic women,
  ministering to the young woman who was so incredibly attractive. The first
  rapture of his short, repressed life stung the simple heart of Nathaniel
  Meadows. The cause of that rapture was that while his senses assured him this
  stranger was beautiful, the clamour of his virtuous friends assured him that
  she was good; he had not believed such a combination possible, nor even hoped
  for such luck as to find a virtuous woman who was also seductive. The
  forbidden fruit and the permitted daily bread in one luscious dish... he
  stared and stared and, unconsciously, licked his handsome lips.</p>

  <p>Lucille Debelleyme accepted without protest or comment her part as
  Protestant victim of Roman Catholic intrigue. She was not questioned, of
  course, on the affair of the Hotel du Boccage, but by a sigh, a glance, a
  chance word, a broken phrase, she gave them to understand that their
  interpretation of that tragedy was indeed correct. It had been her most
  misguided but well-meaning attempt to rescue the children of M. du Boccage
  from the bigotry of their mother, from the fanaticism of the priests, her
  honest endeavour to support their unfortunate father in his effort to save
  his children's souls which had brought about that hideous catastrophe which
  had shocked France.</p>

  <p>For several months she lived in retreat with the Monet family, and nothing
  in her modest behaviour evoked anything but approval in the ingenuous people
  who had so boldly befriended her. Soon after Christmas she began, to go out a
  little, often escorted by Mr. Nathaniel Meadows, who had lingered on in Paris
  longer than he had intended at first. Leaning on his arm or sitting side by
  side with him in some hired carriage, she would show him the more impressive
  sights of Paris, those that were advertised in the guide book and that all
  foreigners wanted to see. "She had," she remarked quietly, "a good knowledge
  of the Capital, having so often taken her young pupils about to show them
  what was instructive and amusing."</p>

  <p>The young American, who did not lack obvious delicacy, was careful that
  these walks and drives should never lead them near the Faubourg St.
  Honoré.</p>

  <p>Then Lucille Debelleyme ventured to go about alone.</p>

  <p>"She wished," she said, "to pray in the chapel in complete solitude," and
  with this object begged the key of the Oratory from the willing pastor, who
  was deeply impressed by the further proof of her wounded piety,</p>

  <p>But Mademoiselle Debelleyme did not use the key; her little excursions led
  her to the Rue Keller where she would walk up and down in front of the
  chemist's shop, where the first sunshine of the year fell across the large
  bottles of coloured water in the windows, purple, red and green.</p>

  <p>She paused sometimes by the little side door, while she glanced up and
  down the street with a look of unutterable grief. Then sometimes she would
  take the omnibus to The Cemetery of the South and pace to and fro before the
  heavy central gates without, however, finding the courage to pass through
  them.</p>

  <p>On some occasions she would go to the Faubourg St. Honoré and pass the
  heavy, locked grille between the two porters' lodges and peep through at the
  bare trees. The mansion was shuttered, the doors barred.</p>

  <p>She knew, for she had procured and avidly read copies of all the August
  issues of the more important Parisian papers, that there was one room in that
  house that was sealed up by order of the Maréchal Frediani&mdash;untouched,
  never to be looked at again. Lucille Debelleyme knew the appearance of that
  room, she had read the accounts of many curious, horrified spectators; the
  overturned furniture, the torn bedclothes, the bloodstains, that would now be
  black, everywhere, on the satin chairs, on the alabaster mantelpiece, on the
  walls; hand-prints, fingerprints in blood; the cut bell-rope, the door of the
  toilet-room without a handle and the heavy baldaquin, gilt and carved, from
  which hung the Brussels lace curtains, still in place despite the waxen
  fastening.</p>

  <p>She thought of his apartment, the green desk where she had found those
  letters of his wife, which had proved such damning evidence against him in
  the end... the portrait of Lord Clare&mdash;was it still hanging on the wall,
  smiling with those thick sensuous lips across the darkness? She had read of
  the incredible confusion of his bedroom and dressing-room, the knife, the
  pistol, the blood-soaked clothes. She had heard how he had thrown a bowl of
  discoloured water out of the window on to the garden, and there came to her
  mind his gesture, his action the first time she had met him, when with vivid
  impatience he had cast out of the window the dead flowers and the foul water
  in the dusty vase.</p>

  <p>She wondered if the cupidon, with the sinister, dimpled face was standing
  lonely in the grand reception room? There would be a great deal of dust now
  on the pelmets, many cobwebs in the shadows of the high window frames.</p>

  <p>Her room, her for two years, what had they done with that? Was the little
  pianoforte still there and the easels on which she stood her water-colours,
  and the mirror in which she had looked at herself, nude, veiled only by her
  hair?</p>

  <p>Javiaux du Boccage, too, that must be standing in solitude in the vast,
  deserted park.</p>

  <p>The present Duke, the young boy, had been taken abroad by his relatives,
  the family had scattered as far as possible from the scene of the
  tragedy.</p>

  <p>Yes, Javiaux du Boccage would be empty, how forlorn those great rooms must
  be, the scaffolding poles, where once his busy workmen had toiled...</p>

  <p>And Locroi, the little Italian house in the Normandy fields, by the river,
  the weeping willows, and the orangery? All deserted, all silent.</p>

  <p>As she stood gazing, on these visits, at the facade behind the light
  movements of bare trees, at the little door of the chemist's shop in the Rue
  Keller, or at the gloomy gate of The Cemetery of the South, such an
  unutterable nostalgia would possess her that her soul seemed wrenched by
  sheer agony out of her body to float in an abyss of black misery. But when
  she returned to the menage Monet, she would be composed, serene, a little
  paler, a little more silent than when she had left the house perhaps, but
  they understood this&mdash;Exhaustion following the spiritual exultation of
  lonely prayers.</p>

  <p>To the sophisticated, the cynical who had watched her in the garden of the
  Conciergerie she had been charming but wicked; to these simple people she was
  charming but good.</p>

  <p>Her grandfather died in January and left her, unexpectedly, a small sum
  which relieved her of the necessity of relying on the straitened means of the
  pastor. To repay this and to buy little gifts for the three women, she had
  already sold what few objects of value she possessed, among them a bracelet
  with blue stones that fetched a surprisingly high price.</p>

  <p>As she had frankly told her history to the pastor, he had recommended she
  should take, in defiance of the world's opinion and in contempt of the
  world's scorn, with a gesture that put her above all shade of subterfuge, her
  own name. She was henceforth Mademoiselle Lucille Clery; let Lucille
  Debelleyme die with the last echoes of the hideous tragedy in which she had
  been involved. Her future, as a fervent Protestant, as a martyr to her faith,
  was assured; she made many friends, received many offers of employment, of
  many advantageous posts, but she refused them all, preferring for the present
  at least to remain with the family Monet. Presently she would go to England
  or America. Now, it would certainly be impossible for her to remain in Paris,
  but for the moment she was not, naturally, strong enough for travel.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, diligently reading her English religious books in the evening,
  she would glance over the top of the pages at Nathaniel Meadows who was never
  far away from her chair. Without ever giving him her confidence, nor indeed
  appearing to take any interest in him beyond gentle friendliness, she had had
  a profound influence over the young man. He now dressed like a Frenchman and
  with some elegance, he had learnt to speak her language correctly. His
  Protestantism, his anti-Catholicism were emphasised to the point of bigotry;
  he told all his acquaintances that Lucille Clery, not Fanny du Boccage, was
  the saint and martyr of the tragedy of the Faubourg St. Honoré.</p>

  <p>Lucille Clery read in the papers, now so full of the tumults and
  confusions of political unrest, a few lines in small print which stated that
  the body of Madame la Duchesse du Boccage, by the wish of her father, the
  Maréchal Frediani, had been taken from the vaults of the Madeleine to Javiaux
  du Boccage, and that almost at the same time the Comte Edouard had removed
  the mortal remains of his brother from The Cemetery of the South and laid him
  in an unnamed coffin of oak covered by a plain pall, beside the sumptuous
  mausoleum of his wife. Side by side again, dose as in a marriage bed. At last
  she had his company in the lonely vaults of deserted Javiaux du Boccage.</p>

  <p>This nearly shattered the young woman's control, acquired with such an
  agony of effort.</p>

  <p>"So, she has cheated me again&mdash;at last&mdash;triumphed after
  all."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch58"
     name="ch58">CHAPTER LVIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">M. le Duc Decaze listened to a letter being read to him by
  his secretary. It had been inscribed with those entreaties of urgency which
  had caused him to select it from among his heavy correspondence. His eyes
  stared across the room with an inscrutable expression as the young man read
  aloud in a careful unemotional voice:</p>

  <p>'Monsieur, weighed down by the terrible tragedy which has almost
  extinguished my life and reason, I have refused without hesitation several
  advantageous offers of a post, but to-day it is happiness itself which is
  offered me. I have not the strength to reject it without making a last effort
  to overcome my sad history. The generous man who wishes to give me his name
  knows all my story, has full confidence in me. If he were alone I should not
  have need of any human witness, but he belongs to a rich and well-considered
  family that cannot see him, without uneasiness, unite his destiny with mine.
  They are strangers to me, I have never seen them, nor can I hope that they
  will easily believe my vows and my tears. Monsieur, but I have no other proof
  to give them. The papers that were seized on my arrest have never been
  returned to me, the public only know that I was accused. Monsieur, can you in
  conscience declare that I was not the infamous wretch who was held up to the
  contempt of the world? You were there, you questioned me, you knew this
  miserable menage, you were present at his torments, at mine, you must have
  been able to understand the part that I played in this drama where I blindly
  worked out my fate. You know that neither ambition nor love of power could
  have given me the influence that I had over my unhappy pupils&mdash;You have
  read HIS letters and mine and you know that we did not love each other.
  Monsieur, I do not implore your pity but I call on your honour.</p>

  <p>'The happiness of all my life depends on your reply. I tell you that
  because I know that it cannot influence your decision. I have the vanity to
  think that you recognised in me some force of character&mdash;you know that I
  will endure much in silence&mdash;whatever you write I will accept as the
  sincere judgment of a man as good, as generous as he is great in the eyes of
  the world, and I shall submit to it with the profound sentiment of gratitude
  and respect that I shall hold for you to my last breath.</p>

  <p>'Signed, Lucille Clery&mdash;formerly Debelleyme.'</p>

  <p>As the secretary sat with the letter in his hand, waiting, the aristocrat
  repeated: "so she has found another protector!&mdash;who, I
  wonder?&mdash;well, it does not matter! She plays her part very well until
  the end. Is that letter sincere now, or a piece of drama? It is rather neatly
  expressed."</p>

  <p>The tips of his fine fingers tapped on his knees. The letter had brought
  back to his mind the appalling death-bed of M. du Boccage, his friend, which
  shook even for one of his stern calibre to remember. M. du Boccage. who had
  confessed nothing, whose last words had been a denial of his crime.</p>

  <p>Lucille Clery had appealed to the judgment of M. Decaze, asked him to
  state the truth. Wide as was his experience, long as had been his life,
  shrewd and apt as was his mind, the aristocrat found it difficult, even when
  sincerely searching his own heart to decide what was the truth in this
  affair.</p>

  <p>As she had skilfully reminded him, he had had some knowledge of the menage
  in the Hotel du Boccage, many opportunities of studying at first hand the
  characters of M. du Boccage and his wife. He had examined for days together
  the murderer and the woman who was supposed to be his accomplice, he had
  heard the commentaries of all those who had had the remotest connection with
  the tragedy, the opinions of many clever and impartial observers. He had seen
  the King, a man of many sorrows, who so loathed the death penalty that he
  only traced initials on the warrants except in one instance, blanch and
  shudder as he reluctantly signed the decree of arrest for M. du Boccage. He
  had heard the Monarch exclaim: "I have had much to endure since I came to the
  throne of France, but this is the worst of all"; he had heard the simple and
  savage judgment of the people. What conclusion could he come to:
  adultery?&mdash;the usual thing&mdash;a love intrigue? A jealous woman
  driving a man mad? One ought to be prepared for everything in this world, but
  a crime so appalling and a man of his rank and breeding, one so fastidious,
  amiable and even gentle in manners and speech, uncommonly devoted to his
  children. Madness then, an outburst of homicidal fury; but M. Decaze had sat
  for hours by the bed of the prisoner in the Luxembourg and seen how, during
  the most excruciating tortures he had skilfully evaded his pitiless
  examiners. Undeniable sanity there... and the premeditation&mdash;the Cord,
  the poison, the wax in the baldaquin supports? No madness there, yet an
  incredible stupidity. The crime was so clumsy that the first investigator had
  discovered the author of it; how could M. du Boccage have supposed that he
  could escape detection&mdash;or, even if he had, how could he have hoped,
  after this appalling murder, to introduce Lucille Debelleyme publicly into
  his life again, either as governess, mistress or wife?</p>

  <p>M. Decaze shrugged his shoulders; the whole affair was one from which his
  intelligence shrank, baffled. If he had not known it to be true he would have
  dismissed it as a ridiculous fable.</p>

  <p>And the woman who had appealed to him? An enigma indeed; he had observed
  her very closely, and he believed that though she might be capable of a crime
  she was not capable of a crass stupidity. "She is not a fool, she did not
  conceive that brutal lunacy."</p>

  <p>What was her relationship with the Duke?</p>

  <p>M. Decaze was completely mystified. If they were not lovers, what was this
  inseparable bond between them, and if they were lovers why should the Duke
  have murdered his wife when he had had all he could hope for from his blonde
  Egeria?</p>

  <p>The certificate of good conduct that she had demanded and he could not
  obtain&mdash;that seemed to have been the final motive of the murder. The
  governess had constantly emphasised her respectability, her excellent
  testimonials. Was that the solution, had Camille du Boccage, weak, violent,
  sensual, with a streak of cruelty in his nature, harried by a thousand
  exasperations, poisoned by hatred of a person with whom he was forced to
  live, shattered his reason, his control, the rules of his caste, even his
  humanity against the implacable respectability of a sly little bourgeoise,
  cunning, prim, skilful&mdash;not quite skilful enough&mdash;?</p>

  <p>M. Decaze thought so. "If they had been lovers he would not have done
  it&mdash;if she had guessed his intention he would not have done it.
  Guiltless then, as far as human justice can go. For the rest it is
  incredible, inexplicable&mdash;it is even a little ridiculous."</p>

  <p>He dictated a dry reply to the appeal of Mademoiselle Clery, in which he
  gave her the testimony she required to satisfy the New Englanders. Fresh
  distaste touched him; she had said that she loved Camille du Boccage... and
  in a few months' time she had found another man.</p>

  <p>"Not even loyal!" M. Decaze put the affair out of his mind; he had other
  matters to think of. Paris was again on the eve of revolution.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch59"
     name="ch59">CHAPTER LIX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A huge and angry crowd before the Ministry of Foreign
  Affairs shouted hot denunciations against M. Guizot; they were, with
  difficulty, held in check by a strong detachment of troops and by the
  municipal guards who, with drawn sabres, pressed the angry people back to the
  edge of the pavement. All the roads leading to the Tuileries and the Palais
  Royal were closed by troops, many of the other streets had been closed by the
  people; furniture, overturned cabs, omnibuses and torn-up paving-stones
  formed barricades against the military. The soldiery appeared to perform
  their duties languidly, the municipal guards with brutal threats and insolent
  force. Shots had been fired in the Place du Chatelet and the Rue St. Denis,
  everywhere through the hurried orders of the military sounded angry cries of:
  "Down with the Ministry! Down with the Monarchy! Long live Reform!"</p>

  <p>In front of the offices of the newspaper La National passed a procession
  of biers carrying the people killed by the troops; fifty-two had already
  fallen. Many of them were young students and among them were women and
  children; their escort, with cries and tears of fury, yelled for arms, for
  vengeance! By the afternoon it was known that the King had given way and
  signed the decree for the dismissal of the hated Minister; but the passions
  of Paris were not so easily assuaged. This concession was greeted on all
  sides with cries of: "No more Kings!"</p>

  <p>People attacked the troops defending the Palais Royale. The Fourteenth of
  the Line, the National Guards and the Municipal Guards stationed near the Rue
  de Valois fired on the advancing mob; this was the signal for the final
  explosion of popular wrath. The people, by force of numbers, thrust back the
  soldiers and police, and began to burn the Palais Royal; at one of the
  windows of this ancient palace of the House of Orleans a young man, the son
  of Admiral Baudin, appeared and announced the abdication of Louis
  Philippe.</p>

  <p>The victorious crowd cried: "It is too late!" and these fatal words were
  followed by yells of "To the Tuileries!" The Palais Royal was already
  flaming.</p>

  <p>Among the crowds of curious citizens, nervous, ready to fly, who kept on
  the fringe of the tumult was a man and a woman&mdash;Nathaniel Meadows, with
  Lucille Clery hanging on his arm. As the crowd, turning with one accord to
  attack the Tuileries, swept out of the Colonnades of the Palais Royal, the
  young man quickly drew his companion into a doorway where, unobserved, they
  could watch this furious tide of sudden revolution sweep past.</p>

  <p>Lucille Clery regarded the yelling, surging crowd of armed revolutionaries
  without fear; she had of late been a diligent reader of the newspapers. She
  had scanned some of the pamphlets that were so eagerly seized on by the
  populace, she had heard, during these sudden days of revolution, many popular
  speeches. She knew, therefore, that it was generally considered that as the
  affair Teste-Cubieres had been, in the popular estimation, the downfall of
  the law and the army, so the affair Du Boccage had been the downfall of the
  old aristocracy. This crime had been quickly followed by the dissolution of
  the Chamber of Peers, and in the full fury of the overthrow of the Monarchy
  the murder of the Faubourg St. Honoré was often hurled as an unanswerable
  insult at the Ministry, the Government and the Peerage. A criminal had, with
  the connivance of his class, escaped the death penalty; everyone believed
  that M. Pasquier, instructed by the Chamber of Peers, had given the poison
  that had spared an aristocrat from the guillotine.</p>

  <p>Lucille Clery, leaning lightly on her companion's arm, was thinking of
  some years ago, when, in an inn at Paddington, she had visualised some such
  scene as this and thought of herself as having a hand in it, either as the
  Hon. Mrs. Robert Morrison, an influential British aristocrat dabbling in
  politics or as Mary Showler, an intelligent, intriguing courtesan. She had
  always wanted to pull down this House of Orleans, the younger branch of
  Bourbon; she had always hoped to see a return of the Bonapartes to whose
  patronage her family had owed whatever they possessed. Now this moment had
  really come. Prince Louis Napoleon was supposed to be hastening to Paris,
  there might be another Empire ruled over by a Bonaparte&mdash;and she had had
  some hand in it, not as Mrs. Morrison, not as Mary Showler, not through any
  direct interest or interference in politics but merely as a governess in the
  household of M. du Boccage.</p>

  <p>Her companion, who was shielding her with the greatest anxiety and
  continually gave her loving glances of apprehension, suggested, as the street
  emptied, that they should turn homewards. Their marriage, for which the
  family Monet were making loving preparations, was only a few days ahead.
  Within a week they were to sail for New York.</p>

  <p>"Let us stay here awhile," said Mademoiselle Clery, "at least we are safe.
  Everyone is going to the Tuileries."</p>

  <p>"There are three thousand troops there," said the young American with
  excitement. "There will be a battle. Perhaps they will burn the
  Palace&mdash;it is terrible. I wonder if the King will escape?"</p>

  <p>A surge of students, carrying a tricolour on which hung the Phrygian cap
  of liberty, swept by. They passed close to the doorway where the two were
  sheltering and the young man took the opportunity to gather the delicate,
  elegant body of Lucille Clery into his powerful arms, nor did he easily let
  her go; she remained leaning against him as if overcome by fright, but in
  reality she felt no fear. She was thinking of her unblemished body, which in
  the interest of ambition had been offered vainly to Robert Morrison and in
  the interests of ambition had been vainly withheld from Camille du Boccage
  and was now to be given with all the rights of solemn matrimony to this young
  Puritan, to whom she was in everything completely alien.</p>

  <p>"Is it worth while living in exile with this man who will always be a
  stranger&mdash;why does one so coolly take the line of least resistance?" She
  gave him a clear glance of wonder and he mistook it for a look of love and
  pressed her hand warmly; she turned her face aside to hide her
  expression.</p>

  <p>"So, this is my destiny&mdash;always to deal with stupid men! But, after
  all, he can give me what I want most, in fact the only thing I
  want&mdash;this great prize, leisure in which to dream what might have been,
  to bring before a mental vision another face, another moment."</p>

  <p>The streets were deserted, they could hear the sound of firing, a low
  smoke began to hang over the city.</p>

  <p>"Let us go home," said Lucille Clery.</p>

  <p>The young man, eager to do her bidding, released her from his embrace,
  adjusting her fine cashmere shawl round her shoulders and putting his arm
  round her waist, almost lifting her from the ground, hastened with her
  towards the pastor's modest pleasant home; it seemed indeed a place of refuge
  amidst this tumult.</p>

  <p>She was still wondering if she could endure him, if, after all, the river
  would not have been better. Towards his person, his character, she was
  profoundly indifferent; she knew all there ever would be to know about him,
  and none of it held any interest for her. But his clothes, his manners
  irritated her, she longed passionately for the costly cloth, the fine linen,
  the delicate perfume, the extravagant details of another man's attire; she
  despised everything in Nathaniel Meadows that was not&mdash;that never could
  be&mdash;grand seigneur. In their hurry they turned round a corner of a side
  street that led quickly home; there had been a struggle there between police
  and insurgents and gouts of blood lay across the road. The young American
  realised that such a sight must be even more horrible to Mademoiselle Clery
  than to most women; he swung her aside towards a florist's shop. It was his
  intention to buy her a cluster of the southern violets, but the frightened
  shopkeeper was putting up his shutters and as the couple reached his door his
  wife was throwing in the street a can of stale water and some withered
  violets; flowers had not sold well in Paris for the last few days.</p>

  <p>The Villa Violette, the two vessels emptied from the windows of the Hotel
  du Boccage, the bunch of faded roses cast into the Seine as the dead boy was
  carried to the Morgue, the trickle of blood from under the gates of the
  slaughter-house, from the apartment of the husband to that of the wife.</p>

  <p>"No flowers!" said the young man in disappointment.</p>

  <p>Lucille Clery hid her face with a corner of her Andalusian shawl which she
  held to keep off, the evening fog and the fumes of the cannon smoke which
  floated down every street. A student in a Grecian cap with a long tassel,
  supporting a wounded companion came by and shouted out in excitement that
  Louis Philippe, who had been passing in review the garrison of the Tuileries,
  had on the approach of the mob at once jumped into a little coupe and had
  fled from Paris, and that the Due de Nemours who was in command of the troops
  defending the Royal Palace had retired. The people were in the palace, they
  had already found the throne, broken it to pieces and thrown it from the
  windows...</p>

  <p>"I should like to pull him down"; the young woman who had uttered these
  words in the Paddington inn found some comfort in irony as she hung with her
  timid helpless air on the arm of her stalwart young protector. It gave her
  some pleasure to reflect how few would guess that in this insignificant
  humbly-born young woman was one of the main causes of the revolution which
  meant the downfall of a dynasty.</p>

  <p>Yet this acrid satisfaction was veiled by such utter misery, such bitter
  nostalgia that she almost hated her own fortitude which enabled her to endure
  such unhappiness. The troops of soldiers, the ambulances, the screaming
  women, the surging crowds who passed, the noise of the cannons, the smoke in
  the air, the cries, the shouts, the rumours, all were like a mirage to
  Lucille Clery; as she passed lightly, swiftly, close to her lover through the
  embattled streets, the uproar of revolution, she saw only a face which gazed
  back as if awaiting a signal, the lint-coloured hair disordered on the
  forehead: "I shall expect of you some action."</p>

  <p>The Pastor Frédéric Monet was putting up a prayer for the two lovers
  caught in the turmoil of the rioting, while his daughters, with sentimental
  tenderness, sewed sprays of wax orange blossoms on to the satin bonnet of the
  bride.</p>

  <p>EPILOGUE</p>

  <p>Mrs. Lucy Meadows was preparing, in her pleasant, brown stone house, for
  one of those agreeable afternoon entertainments, so well known in New York as
  a gathering place for the more enlightened Christian workers. Mrs. Meadows
  had just returned from Long Island, where she had spent the hot American
  summer; she endured excessive heat very badly, and usually passed the month
  of August in a state of languid ill-health, but at the coming of the autumn
  there was always a return of her energy and, perfect housekeeper and good
  organiser as she was, she would at once resume that ceaseless work which made
  her the admired centre of a group of prosperous, comfortable, Puritan New
  Englanders.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Meadows had been married for several years and her union with the
  well-known pastor Nathaniel Meadows was considered ideal. Her devotion was of
  a nature at once lofty and touching; she was her husband's constant companion
  and assisted him in the compilation and editing of his successful paper The
  Christian Evangelist.</p>

  <p>A copy of the proofs of the current issue of this journal lay on the
  mahogany desk between the two tall windows but Mrs. Meadows, occupied in
  preparing for her guests, gave it no more than a glance; that was a task that
  could wait.</p>

  <p>The lion of the party was to be Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe, and no doubt
  the subject of animated discussion would be the emancipation of the slaves in
  the South, which Mrs. Stowe, by her famous novel, had done so much to make a
  burning question of the moment.</p>

  <p>The handsome room was clean and arranged with faultless taste. Mrs.
  Meadows glided here and there, rearranging, with a sure judgment, clusters of
  autumn flowers, asters, golden rod, a few last roses that filled the vases of
  Colonial silver which made a satisfactory display against the dark-panelled
  walls. She was dressed plainly as befitted a pastor's wife but her dress
  flattered her slender shape and was finely cut, not too high at the throat
  and collared with beautiful lace. Her pale hair was gathered into a knot at
  the back of her head and was partly covered by the discreet matron's cap that
  was arranged on her small head with an art which approached coquetry. Her
  small features as yet showed no line or wrinkle but seemed in their firm
  outline to be made of some imperishable material. It was generally recognised
  that Mrs. Meadows was a very lovely woman and one wholly without vanity. Her
  modest habit of keeping her lovely eyes downcast was much commended; a model
  wife, a model marriage. There were no children&mdash;a pity perhaps, but
  those who were most intimate with the Meadows establishment agreed that no
  doubt it was just as well no little ones had come to interfere with the
  intense devotion of husband and wife and their mutual absorption in good
  work.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Meadows paused and critically examined the elaborate tea service for
  twelve people which was laid on a side table. She picked up the massive
  silver piece by piece, not a speck of tarnish; with delicate fingers she
  raised the blue and crimson Worcester china piece by piece, not a fleck of
  dust. The homemade cakes were varied and delicious, largely her own work or
  made under her immediate supervision, and delicately covered by thin linen
  napkins of her own embroidery.</p>

  <p>The Rev. Nathaniel Meadows was indeed, blessed in so perfect a
  housekeeper.</p>

  <p>Having finished her inspection she seated herself by the wide hearth on
  which the first fire of the year burned clearly. Behind her hung a series of
  portraits, drawings and small oils, of her husband's ancestors&mdash;sturdy,
  hard-working Puritan stock, good business men, able money-makers, people who
  had successfully defied the world, the flesh and the devil without feeling
  themselves obliged to lead the lives of either saint or hermit. Their
  square-cut faces stared unseeingly across the comfortable room where this
  exotic woman, so completely alien to all her surroundings, sat at ease,
  flourishing discreetly on the substance provided by their toil and
  prudence.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Meadows, in an attitude unconsciously elegant, was gazing at a bureau
  in the corner on which stood filigree dishes of biscuit-hued china piled with
  ruddy fruits and comfits in silver paper. One of the drawers of this bureau
  was always locked, she kept the key always about her person. In this moment
  of tranquillity she was wondering at the weakness which had made her preserve
  what really should have long ago been destroyed. She was alone, there was a
  bright fire, was not this, perhaps, the moment? She felt so calm, she could
  find the strength to handle what she did not wish to touch again, to look at
  what she never wished to see again. Someone must sooner or later burn or
  destroy the contents of that drawer; she might die before her husband, and
  whenever she died there would be those who, however reverently, would handle
  what she left behind&mdash;better that she should destroy all trace of what
  ought to have long ago been forgotten, what she believed was forgotten by
  everyone but herself. She continued to stare at the locked drawer, she did
  not need to open it to read the contents of some of the French newspapers.
  <i>La Reforme, Le Charivari, L'Union Monarchique</i>, folded away there: the
  words seemed to be traced on the air of the pleasant sitting-room.</p>

  <p>At dawn on August 16th the few domestics remaining in the Hotel du Boccage
  (the Duke bad dismissed almost the entire household the preceding day) were
  aroused by the sound of a bell being irregularly rung from the apartments of
  Madame la Duchess. Dressing themselves hastily they rushed to her door but
  found this unaccustomedly locked from the inside. They then went round the
  terrace; as they approached someone from inside opened the window. They
  looked in and a frightful spectacle met their eyes, Madame la Duchesse du
  Boccage lying extended on the floor near her bed bleeding from many large
  wounds, her hands were covered with blood, one of them clutched some
  fragments of blond hair. The disorder of the room, the overturning of light
  articles of furniture, smashed porcelain and torn curtains showed the unhappy
  woman had sustained a terrible struggle with her murderer. As the servants
  recoiled they saw a figure detaching itself from the shadows of the cabinet
  de toilette. This figure supported itself against the wall, continually took
  its head in its hands; as it advanced into the uncertain light of the dawn
  they perceived it was M. le Duc du Boccage...</p>

  <p>From the first moment that the officers of Justice arrived on the scene a
  grave fact was remarked, there was no trace of robbery, of any entry from the
  garden, but a track of blood marked the floor from the apartment of the
  Duchess to that of the Duke.</p>

  <p>Monsieur du Boccage, while the police were examining his other clothes,
  put on, with the assistance of Henri, his valet, a <i>robe de chambre</i> of
  brown wool lined with blue silk over trousers in wide stripes of blue and
  grey, a waistcoat of white batiste and a linen shirt and black silk
  cravat.</p>

  <p>Despite the extreme heat of the morning, smoke from an early hour had been
  seen to issue from the chimney of the private apartment of M. du Boccage.</p>

  <p>It was remarked that he wore gloves throughout the morning. When a medical
  examination of his person, was ordered in the afternoon the reason was
  apparent; his hands were covered with scratches and there was a severe bite
  on one of his thumbs. It was by then established that the blond hairs
  clutched in the rigid fingers of the Duchess were of the same colour and
  length as those of her husband.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Meadows glanced at the clock brought from England in the Colonial
  days, it bore the name of a Cambridge maker in tall nourishing letters on the
  dial... another twenty minutes before she might expect even the most punctual
  of her guests.</p>

  <p>Owing to the feeble light and the desire to attract no attention it took
  nearly two hours to traverse the back streets from the Faubourg St. Honors to
  the prison of the Luxembourg. On arrival there the prisoner was in such a
  state of collapse that be had to be carried to his cell. Burning with thirst
  and shivering with cold, he was given continual drinks of iced Burgundy to
  ease his self-inflicted misery.</p>

  <p>The effect of the immense quantity of arsenic he had drunk was such as to
  contract his body in his final agonies till he looked like a child. When he
  was dead, however, the muscles relaxed and as he lay stripped on the marble
  table awaiting the autopsy, the first surgeon to see him exclaimed: "What a
  superb athlete!"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Meadows rose and went to the bureau, unlocked the drawer and took out
  the bundle of newspapers. There was a copy of The Times there too with a
  pencil mark round this paragraph: "We greatly regret to inform our readers of
  the sudden death of the Hon. Robert Morrison, who, by a most regrettable
  accident, was thrown from his horse while hunting in the Cotswolds
  to-day."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Meadows took the papers and tossed them into the bright, clear fire.
  They were burnt almost at once, but her keen eyes could discern for a second
  or two words where the printer's ink resisted the flame,
  "murder&mdash;suicide&mdash;death."</p>

  <p>All gone now, all vanished, like the Hotel du Boccage itself which had
  been demolished several years ago. No one wanted to live in it, nor even to
  build on the site. The Rue d'Élysée now crossed the ground where Lucille
  Debelleyme had walked for the first time on a warm spring day, where the
  blood-stained disordered room that the Maréchal de Frediani had sealed up
  once stood, where the new governess had noted the dimpled, smiling face of
  the Cupidon looking over her shoulder and M. du Boccage had thrown the
  flowers and the stale water out of the window, and two years later another
  vessel containing water stained with blood: where the portrait of Lord Clare
  had hung on the wall of the little study gazing with his amiable, sensual
  smile at the green writing-desk where the correspondence of Fanny du Boccage
  had been thrown by an exasperated hand. All gone&mdash;all vanished.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Meadows took up the poker and stirred the fire, not even ashes
  remained.</p>

  <p>Javiaux du Boccage stood deserted; the family had scattered. The only
  inhabitants of that grandiose chateau were the two corpses lying side by side
  in the new vaults. She with all the panoply and pomp that love and affection
  could suggest&mdash;he under his plain black pall with a simple cross put
  there by the unwilling hand of outraged charity.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Meadows looked again at the clock, in another ten minutes she might
  expect the first of her guests.</p>

  <p>She had now much that in her youth she would have given half her life to
  have possessed&mdash;the almost idolatrous affection of her husband; the
  admiration of a large circle of friends; the discreet fame of a Protestant
  martyr who had been involved in the almost incredible machinations of
  Catholics and Jesuits; comfort, ease, leisure, power and influence over those
  who felt the force of her wit, her intellect&mdash;subtle domination.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Lucy Meadows had indeed almost everything that Mary Showler, Lucille
  Debelleyme, Lucille Clery had longed for; but she secretly, eagerly marked
  the passing of every day that brought her nearer to that annihilation which
  was her firm conception of death.</p>

  <p>Her husband was the first person to enter the room she had so charmingly
  prepared for their guests. He had been parted from her several hours and
  greeted her as effusively as if he had returned from a long voyage. This
  Evangelistic parson, robust, ardent, simple, was completely happy. He had
  found that which none of his readings or the transmitted experiences of his
  elders had predisposed him to believe possible to find&mdash;a woman who
  could be as alluring as an accomplished courtesan, who was a perfect
  housekeeper, an intelligent companion; the domestic wife and the accomplished
  mistress in one, a paragon that many men have laboured in vain to find. The
  Rev. Nathaniel Meadows did not thus analyse the matter to himself; he merely
  considered his dear Lucy as a worthy helpmate expressly sent him by God.</p>

  <p>He kissed her, even after so many years of marriage, eagerly. She entirely
  pleased his senses. The richest part of his life was still those moments when
  he was not a Puritan, clergyman, nor she a pious matron, but when he, a man
  with a woman, served in secret those lustful passions his Church forbade;
  when the company had gone there would be the evening together and after the
  evening the night... What he said was, "Have you corrected those proofs, my
  dear? The paper ought to go to press to-night."</p>

  <p>"I will do it when the company have gone. Don't you think Mrs. Stowe's
  article rather coarse&mdash;it might offend many good Christians. I know it
  is only the way she expresses herself, but one does not wish to trespass in
  anything beyond the dictates of the Church&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He said that she was, as always, right, and gazed at her with looks of
  love, asking her if she was quite recovered from the summer languors, if she
  did not find New York too hot?</p>

  <p>His appearance was fine; she had taken great pains with his manners, his
  dress, tastes, trying to mould him to the likeness of a memory; but the
  result of all her efforts was only the caricature of another man.</p>

  <p>She asked him to replenish the fire and watched him while he placed the
  logs in that clear hollow of flame where the French newspapers and the
  English cutting had been consumed,</p>

  <p>He turned back to her with smiles; how charming, how elegant she was! He
  was always so glad when the summer, when August was over, because undoubtedly
  she languished in the great heat. Her figure was outlined so prettily against
  the wall where hung some of her own drawings of flowers, her
  faintly-pencilled landscapes. He sincerely blessed God for this lovely,
  clever wife; she had her moods, bleak, melancholy, unaccountable, but they
  were always brief and there was something even about her rare flashes of
  temper, of acid comment that pleased him, like a sharp flavour not understood
  but salty and stimulating. They had had few quarrels. He had once brought
  home a parcel of music for an entertainment in the Mission Hall; among the
  pieces had been an old polka, "La Belle Helene," and two of his congregation,
  Miss Bibby and Miss Prue Hardside had wanted to play it as a duet. Then,
  really, darling Lucy had behaved most strangely; she had been quite bitter
  and violent at the idea of secular music in the Mission Hall, and when he had
  urged her not to be narrow minded, she had begun to say terrible
  things&mdash;in French, which he could understand only roughly now, but the
  look, the tone!&mdash;Sometimes he recalled that unpleasant incident with a
  veritable shudder. Of course, she had had her way and the concert had been
  duly dull; of course, she had soon become herself again; he had been very
  careful never again to offend her extreme religious susceptibility.</p>

  <p>To satisfy the secret, clumsy, shamefaced lusts of a Puritan, to keep his
  house in perfect order, to share his enthusiasm for his childish, unpleasant
  creed, was it worth while? Only because of a deep, detested instinct of
  self-preservation, the inability to forego those poignant memories that must
  cease at an atheist's death... and yet death was longed for too. "What a
  relief to think that I shall not go to his Heaven&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He brought the long sheets of print over to her, admiring her little
  contribution, and held it before her asking if she did not like the cut of a
  cherub playing with daisies that he had chosen to illustrate her essay?</p>

  <p>She looked, she praised dutifully, then her glance fell on the number of
  the paper printed by the title: one thousand and fifty-four. Instantly she
  bent over her work, she was hemming flannel petticoats for orphan girls; her
  silver thimble, wreathed with forget-me-nots, gleamed in the firelight.</p>

  <p>"Those sketches, my love, should we not publish them in a little
  volume?"</p>

  <p>"I really do not know, dear, whether they are suitable for Christian
  Evangelists. Besides, they are really very trivial. You must not flatter me,
  I have no talent in that direction."</p>

  <p>"You have talents, my darling, in all directions, everything you touch is
  well done."</p>

  <p>He could not read the sincere contempt in her smile as she glanced up at
  him, he had never been able to understand her at all and never would be. He
  was perfectly satisfied with the artificial self she so contemptuously
  offered him; her smile became fixed, one thousand and fifty-four.</p>

  <p>"I should like them published in a book. You have almost enough," he
  urged, gazing fatuously at the cut, the proof.</p>

  <p>"Do you think they would be of any interest to the American public, my
  dear?"</p>

  <p>"Why I am sure, such pretty, such charming sketches&mdash;your account of
  Louis Philippe at the Tuileries and of a holiday at Dieppe&mdash;those scenes
  in a country chateau and the little anecdotes of servants and children! Why,
  Mrs. Stowe was speaking to me of it only yesterday; she said it was all most
  charmingly done. But what will you call them?"</p>

  <p>She turned a full look from her clear, formidable eyes on his candid
  face.</p>

  <p>"Sketches of Home Life in France, I thought, but perhaps that is a little
  banal."</p>

  <p>"I think it will do very well." Then, "It is hardly charming, pretty
  enough."</p>

  <p>He took from his wide pocket the manuscript of insipid, amiable and mildly
  diverting essays which Mrs. Meadows had written on the manners, surroundings
  and customs of those strange and rather forbidding people, the French, who,
  she laboured to show, had, after all, a friendly, domestic side.</p>

  <p>One thousand and fifty-four.</p>

  <p>As he turned over with loving admiration the sheets covered with her neat
  handwriting, Mrs. Meadows rose and turned her back to her husband so that he
  might not surprise the uncontrollable spasm of agony, of bitter longing which
  convulsed the features usually so placid; and as her needle darted
  mechanically through the flannel the thought "how do I go on living?" seemed
  to dart through her heart. An apartment in the Rue Keller&mdash;was the
  chemist's shop still standing? A sob rose to her throat and lips&mdash;a man
  staring at her expectantly from under his thick, fair lashes.</p>

  <p>Mr. Meadows continued persistently to ask for a title for the little
  volume on which he had set his heart.</p>

  <p>She glanced at the neat row of books in a glass case&mdash;there in the
  corner, next a handsome volume adorned with coloured plates, entitled.
  Gentlewoman's Annual Amateur Gardening, was a volume of 'Forget-me-not' for
  the year 1840; she touched her lips with her thimble which was wreathed with
  the simple blue flower: "I shall not forget them and they will not forget
  me&mdash;no, none of those who met me will ever forget Lucille
  Debelleyme&mdash;no, I shall not forget&mdash;one thousand and
  fifty-four."</p>

  <p>She turned slowly to her husband as a ring of the bell at the main door
  announced the first guest:</p>

  <p>"If you really want a pretty title&mdash;after all it is a book of
  reminiscences, why not call it, dear, Forget-me-not?"</p>
