<h2><a id="ch1" name="ch1">1. &mdash; THE HORROR ON THE STAKE</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">SOLOMON KANE leaned on his strangely carved staff
and gazed in scowling perplexity at the mystery which spread
silently before him. Many a deserted village Kane had seen in the
months that had passed since he turned his face east from the Slave
Coast and lost himself in the mazes of jungle and river, but never
one like this.</p>

<p>It was not famine that had driven away the inhabitants, for
yonder the wild rice still grew rank and unkempt in the untilled
fields. There were no Arab slave-raiders in this nameless
land&mdash;it must have been a tribal war that devastated the
village, Kane decided, as he gazed sombrely at the scattered bones
and grinning skulls that littered the space among the rank weeds
and grasses. These bones were shattered and splintered, and Kane
saw jackals and a hyena furtively slinking among the ruined huts.
But why had the slayers left the spoils? There lay war spears,
their shafts crumbling before the attacks of the white ants. There
lay shields, mouldering in the rains and sun. There lay the cooking
pots, and about the neck-bones of a shattered skeleton glistened a
necklace of gaudily painted pebbles and shells&mdash;surely rare
loot for any savage conqueror.</p>

<p>He gazed at the huts, wondering why the thatch roofs of so many
were torn and rent, as if by taloned things seeking entrance. Then
something made his cold eyes narrow in startled unbelief. Just
outside the mouldering mound that was once the village wall towered
a gigantic baobab tree, branchless for sixty feet, its mighty bole
too large to be gripped and scaled. Yet in the topmost branches
dangled a skeleton, apparently impaled on a broken limb.</p>

<p>The cold hand of mystery touched the shoulder of Solomon Kane.
How came those pitiful remains in that tree? Had some monstrous
ogre's inhuman hand flung them there?</p>

<p>Kane shrugged his broad shoulders and his hand unconsciously
touched the black butts of his heavy pistols, the hilt of his long
rapier, and the dirk in his belt. Kane felt no fear as an ordinary
man would feel, confronted with the Unknown and Nameless. Years of
wandering in strange lands and warring with strange creatures had
melted away from brain, soul, and body all that was not steel and
whalebone. He was tall and spare, almost gaunt, built with the
savage economy of the wolf. Broad-shouldered, long-armed, with
nerves of ice and thews of spring steel, he was no less the natural
killer than the born swordsman.</p>

<p>The brambles and thorns of the jungle had dealt hardly with him;
his garments hung in tatters, his featherless slouch hat was torn
and his boots of Cordovan leather were scratched and worn. The sun
had baked his chest and limbs to a deep bronze, but his ascetically
lean face was impervious to its rays. His complexion was still of
that strange, dark pallor which gave him an almost corpse-like
appearance, belied only by his cold, light eyes.</p>

<p>And now Kane, sweeping the village once more with his searching
gaze, pulled his belt into a more comfortable position, shifted to
his left hand the cat-headed stave N'Longa had given him, and took
up his way again.</p>

<p>To the west lay a strip of thin forest, sloping downward to a
broad belt of savannas, a waving sea of grass waist-deep and
deeper. Beyond that rose another narrow strip of woodlands,
deepening rapidly into dense jungle. Out of that jungle Kane had
fled like a hunted wolf with pointed-toothed men hot on his trail.
Even now a vagrant breeze brought faintly the throb of a savage
drum which whispered its obscene tale of hate and blood-hunger and
belly-lust across miles of jungle and grassland.</p>

<p>The memory of his flight and narrow escape was vivid in Kane's
mind, for only the day before had he realized too late that he was
in cannibal country, and all that afternoon in the reeking stench
of the thick jungle, he had crept and run and hidden and doubled
and twisted on his track with the fierce hunters ever close behind
him, until night fell and he gained and crossed the grasslands
under cover of darkness.</p>

<p>Now in the late morning he had seen nothing, heard nothing of
his pursuers, yet he had no reason to believe that they had
abandoned the chase. They had been close on his heels when he took
to the savannas.</p>

<p>So Kane surveyed the land in front of him. To the east, curving
from north to south ran a straggling range of hills, for the most
part dry and barren, rising in the south to a jagged black skyline
that reminded Kane of the black hills of Negari. Between him and
these hills stretched a broad expanse of gently rolling country,
thickly treed, but nowhere approaching the density of a jungle.
Kane got the impression of a vast upland plateau, bounded by the
curving hills to the east and by the savannas to the west.</p>

<p>Kane set out for the hills with his long, swinging, tireless
stride. Surely somewhere behind him the black demons were stealing
after him, and he had no desire to be driven to bay. A shot might
send them flying in sudden terror, but on the other hand, so low
they were in the scale of humanity, it might transmit no
supernatural fear to their dull brains. And not even Solomon Kane,
whom Sir Francis Drake had called Devon's king of swords, could win
in a pitched battle with a whole tribe.</p>

<p>The silent village with its burden of death and mystery faded
out behind him. Utter silence reigned among these mysterious
uplands where no birds sang and only a silent macaw flitted among
the great trees. The only sounds were Kane's cat-like tread, and
the whisper of the drum-haunted breeze.</p>

<p>And then Kane caught a glimpse among the trees that made his
heart leap with a sudden, nameless horror, and a few moments later
he stood before Horror itself, stark and grisly. In a wide
clearing, on a rather bold incline stood a grim stake, and to this
stake was bound a thing that had once been a black man. Kane had
rowed, chained to the bench of a Turkish galley, and he had toiled
in Barbary vineyards; he had battled red Indians in the New Lands
and had languished in the dungeons of Spain's Inquisition. He knew
much of the fiendishness of man's inhumanity, but now he shuddered
and grew sick. Yet it was not so much the ghastliness of the
mutilations, horrible as they were, that shook Kane's soul, but the
knowledge that the wretch still lived.</p>

<p>For as he drew near, the gory head that lolled on the butchered
breast lifted and tossed from side to side, spattering blood from
the stumps of ears, while a bestial, rattling whimper drooled from
the shredded lips.</p>

<p>Kane spoke to the ghastly thing and it screamed unbearably,
writhing in incredible contortions, while its head jerked up and
down with the jerking of mangled nerves, and the empty, gaping
eye-sockets seemed striving to see from their emptiness. And
moaning low and brain-shatteringly it huddled its outraged self
against the stake where it was bound and lifted its head in a
grisly attitude of listening, as if it expected something out of
the skies.</p>

<p>"Listen," said Kane, in the dialect of the river tribes. "Do not
fear me&mdash;I will not harm you and nothing else shall harm you
any more. I am going to loose you."</p>

<p>Even as he spoke Kane was bitterly aware of the emptiness of his
words. But his voice had filtered dimly into the crumbling,
agony-shot brain of the man before him. From between splintered
teeth fell words, faltering and uncertain, mixed and mingled with
the slavering droolings of imbecility. He spoke a language akin to
the dialects Kane had learned from friendly river folk on his
wanderings, and Kane gathered that he had been bound to the stake
for a long time&mdash;many moons, he whimpered in the delirium of
approaching death; and all this time, inhuman, evil things had
worked their monstrous will upon him. These things he mentioned by
name, but Kane could make nothing of it for he used an unfamiliar
term that sounded like Akaana. But these things had not bound him
to the stake, for the torn wretch slavered the name of Goru, who
was a priest and who had drawn a cord too tight about his
legs&mdash;and Kane wondered that the memory of this small pain
should linger through the red mazes of agony that the dying man
should whimper over it.</p>

<p>And to Kane's horror, the black spoke of his brother who had
aided in the binding of him, and he wept with infantile sobs.
Moisture formed in the empty sockets and made tears of blood. And
he muttered of a spear broken long ago in some dim hunt, and while
he muttered in his delirium, Kane gently cut his bonds and eased
his broken body to the grass. But even at the Englishman's careful
touch, the poor wretch writhed and howled like a dying dog, while
blood started anew from a score of ghastly gashes, which, Kane
noted, were more like the wounds made by fang and talon than by
knife or spear. But at last it was done and the bloody, torn thing
lay on the soft grass with Kane's, old slouch hat beneath its
death's-head, breathing in great, rattling gasps.</p>

<p>Kane poured water from his canteen between the mangled lips, and
bending close, said: "Tell me more of these devils, for by the God
of my people, this deed shall not go unavenged, though Satan
himself bar my way."</p>

<p>It is doubtful if the dying man heard. But he heard something
else. The macaw, with the curiosity of its breed, swept from a
near-by grove and passed so close its great wings fanned Kane's
hair. And at the sound of those wings, the butchered black man
heaved upright and screamed in a voice that haunted Kane's dreams
to the day of his death: "The wings! the wings! They come again!
Ahhh, mercy, the wings!"</p>

<p>And the blood burst in a torrent from his lips and so he
died.</p>

<p><br>
KANE rose and wiped the cold sweat from his forehead. The upland
forest shimmered in the noonday heat. Silence lay over the land
like an enchantment of dreams. Kane's brooding eyes ranged to the
black, malevolent hills crouching in the distance and back to the
far-away savannas. An ancient curse lay over that mysterious land
and the shadow of it fell across the soul of Solomon Kane.</p>

<p>Tenderly he lifted the red ruin that had once pulsed with life
and youth and vitality, and carried it to the edge of the glade,
where arranging the cold limbs as best he might, and shuddering
once again at the unnameable mutilations, he piled stones above it
till even a prowling jackal would find it hard to get at the flesh
below.</p>

<p>And he had scarcely finished when something jerked him back out
of his sombre broodings to a realization of his own position. A
slight sound&mdash;or his own wolf-like instinct&mdash;made him
whirl.</p>

<p>On the other side of the glade he caught a movement among the
tall grasses&mdash;the glimpse of a hideous black face, with an
ivory ring in the flat nose, thick lips parted to reveal teeth
whose filed points were apparent even at that distance, beady eyes
and a low slanting forehead topped by a mop of frizzy hair. Even as
the face faded from view Kane leaped back into the shelter of the
ring of trees which circled the glade, and ran like a deer-hound,
flitting from tree to tree and expecting at each moment to hear the
exultant clamour of the warriors and to see them break cover at his
back.</p>

<p>But soon he decided that they were content to hunt him down as
certain beasts track their prey, slowly and inevitably. He hastened
through the upland forest, taking advantage of every bit of cover,
and he saw no more of his pursuers; yet he knew, as a hunted wolf
knows, that they hovered close behind him, waiting their moment to
strike him down without risk to their own hides.</p>

<p>Kane smiled bleakly and without mirth. If it was to be a test of
endurance, he would see how savage thews compared with his own
spring-steel resilience. Let night come and he might yet give them
the slip. If not&mdash;Kane knew in his heart that the savage
essence of his very being which chafed at his flight, would make
him soon turn at bay, though his pursuers outnumbered him a hundred
to one.</p>

<p>The sun sank westward. Kane was hungry, for he had not eaten
since early morning when he wolfed down the last of his dried meat.
An occasional spring had given him water, and once he thought he
glimpsed the roof of a large hut far away through the trees. But he
gave it a wide berth. It was hard to believe that this silent
plateau was inhabited, but if it were, the natives were doubtless
as ferocious as those hunting him.</p>

<p>Ahead of him the land grew rougher, with broken boulders and
steep slopes as he neared the lower reaches of the brooding hills.
And still no sight of his hunters except for faint glimpses caught
by wary backward glances&mdash;a drifting shadow, the bending of
the grass, the sudden straightening of a trodden twig, a rustle of
leaves. Why should they be so cautious? Why did they not close in
and have it over?</p>

<p>Night fell and Kane reached the first long slopes which led
upward to the foot of the hills which now brooded black and
menacing above him. They were his goal, where he hoped to shake off
his persistent foes at last, yet a nameless aversion warned him
away from them. They were pregnant with hidden evil, repellent as
the coil of a great sleeping serpent, glimpsed in the tall
grass.</p>

<p><br>
DARKNESS fell heavily. The stars winked redly in the thick heat of
the tropic night. And Kane, halting for a moment in an unusually
dense grove, beyond which the trees thinned out on the slopes,
heard a stealthy movement that was not the night wind&mdash;for no
breath of air stirred the heavy leaves. And even as he turned,
there was a rush in the dark, under the trees.</p>

<p>A shadow that merged with the shadows flung itself on Kane with
a bestial mouthing and a rattle of iron, and the Englishman,
parrying by the gleam of the stars on the weapon, felt his
assailant duck into close quarters and meet him chest to chest.
Lean wiry arms locked about him, pointed teeth gnashed at him as
Kane returned the fierce grapple. His tattered shirt ripped beneath
a jagged edge, and by blind chance Kane found and pinioned the hand
that held the iron knife, and drew his own dirk, flesh crawling in
anticipation of a spear in the back.</p>

<p>But even as the Englishman wondered why the others did not come
to their comrade's aid, he threw all of his iron muscles into the
single combat. Close-clinched they swayed and writhed in the
darkness, each striving to drive his blade into the other's flesh,
and as the superior strength of the Puritan began to assert itself,
the cannibal howled like a rabid dog, tore and bit.</p>

<p>A convulsive spin-wheel of effort pivoted them out into the
starlit glade where Kane saw the ivory nose-ring and the pointed
teeth that snapped beast-like at his throat. And simultaneously he
forced back and down the hand that gripped his knife-wrist, and
drove the dirk deep into the black ribs. The warrior screamed, and
the raw acrid scent of blood flooded the night air. And in that
instant Kane was stunned by a sudden savage rush and beat of mighty
wings that dashed him to earth, and the black man was torn from his
grip and vanished with a scream of mortal agony. Kane leaped to his
feet, shaken to his foundation. The dwindling scream of the
wretched black sounded faintly <i>and from above him</i>.</p>

<p>Straining his eyes into the skies he thought he caught a glimpse
of a shapeless and horrific Thing crossing the dim stars&mdash;in
which the writhing limbs of a human mingled namelessly with great
wings and a shadowy shape&mdash;but so quickly it was gone, he
could not be sure.</p>

<p>And now he wondered if it were not all a nightmare. But groping
in the grove he found the ju-ju stave with which he had parried the
short stabbing spear that lay beside it. And here, if more proof
was needed, was his long dirk, still stained with blood.</p>

<p>Wings! Wings in the night! The skeleton in the village of torn
roofs&mdash;the mutilated black man whose wounds were not made with
knife or spear and who died shrieking of wings. Surely those hills
were the haunt of gigantic birds who made humanity their prey. Yet
if birds, why had they not wholly devoured the black man on the
stake? And Kane knew in his heart that no true bird ever cast such
a shadow as he had seen flit across the stars.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders, bewildered. The night was silent.
Where were the rest of the cannibals who had followed him from
their distant jungle? Had the fate of their comrade frightened them
into flight? Kane looked to his pistols. Cannibals or no, he went
not up into those dark hills that night.</p>

<p>Now he must sleep, if all the devils of the Elder World were on
his track. A deep roaring to the westward warned him that beasts of
prey were aroam, and he walked rapidly down the rolling slopes
until he came to a dense grove some distance from that in which he
had fought the cannibal. He climbed high among the great branches
until he found a thick crotch that would accommodate even his tall
frame. The branches above would guard him from a sudden swoop of
any winged thing, and if savages were lurking near, their clamber
into the tree would warn him, for he slept lightly as a cat. As for
serpents and leopards, they were chances he had taken a thousand
times.</p>

<p>Solomon Kane slept and his dreams were vague, chaotic, haunted
with a suggestion of pre-human evil and which at last merged into a
vision vivid as a scene in waking life. Solomon dreamed he woke
with a start, drawing a pistol&mdash;for so long had his life been
that of the wolf, that reaching for a weapon was his natural
reaction upon waking suddenly.</p>

<p>His dream was that a strange, shadowy thing had perched upon a
great branch close by and gazed at him with greedy, luminous yellow
eyes that seared into his brain. The dream-thing was tall and lean
and strangely misshapen, so blended with the shadows that it seemed
a shadow itself, tangible only in the narrow yellow eyes. And Kane
dreamed he waited, spellbound, while uncertainty came into those
eyes, and then the creature walked out on the limb as a man would
walk, raised great shadowy wings, sprang into space and
vanished.</p>

<p>Kane jerked upright, the mists of sleep fading. In the dim
starlight, under the arching Gothic-like branches, the tree was
empty save for himself. Then it had been a dream, after
all&mdash;yet it had been so vivid, so fraught with inhuman
foulness&mdash;even now a faint scent like that exuded by birds of
prey seemed to linger in the air. Kane strained his ears. He heard
the sighing of the night wind, the whisper of the leaves, the
far-away roaring of a lion, but naught else. Again Solomon
slept&mdash;while high above him a shadow wheeled against the
stars, circling again and again as a vulture circles a dying
wolf.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch2" name="ch2">2. &mdash; THE BATTLE IN THE SKY</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">DAWN was spreading whitely over the eastern hills
when Kane woke. The thought of his nightmare came to him and he
wondered again at its vividness as he climbed down out of the tree.
A nearby spring slaked his thirst and some fruit, rare in these
highlands, eased his hunger.</p>

<p>Then he turned his face again to the hills. A finish fighter was
Solomon Kane. Along that grim skyline dwelt some evil foe to the
sons of men, and that mere fact was as much a challenge to the
Puritan as had ever been a glove thrown in his face by some
hot-headed gallant of Devon.</p>

<p>Refreshed by his night's sleep, he set out with his long easy
stride, passing the grove that had witnessed the battle in the
night, and coming into the region where the trees thinned at the
foot of the slopes. Up these slopes he went, halting for a moment
to gaze back over the way he had come. Now that he was above the
plateau, he could easily make out a village in the distance&mdash;a
cluster of mud-and-bamboo huts with one unusually large hut a short
distance from the rest on a sort of low knoll.</p>

<p>And while he gazed, with a sudden rush of grisly wings the
terror was upon him! Kane whirled, galvanized. All signs had
pointed to the theory of a winged thing that hunted by night. He
had not expected attack in broad daylight&mdash;but here a bat-like
monster was swooping at him out of the very eye of the rising sun.
Kane saw a spread of mighty wings, from which glared a horribly
human face; then he drew and fired with unerring aim and the
monster veered wildly in midair and came whirling and tumbling out
of the sky to crash at his feet.</p>

<p>Kane leaned forward, pistol smoking in his hand, and gazed
wide-eyed. Surely this thing was a demon out of the black pits of
hell, said the sombre mind of the Puritan; yet a leaden ball had
slain it. Kane shrugged his shoulders, baffled; he had never seen
aught to approach this, though all his life had fallen in strange
ways.</p>

<p>The thing was like a man, inhumanly tall and inhumanly thin; the
head was long, narrow, and hairless&mdash;the head of a predatory
creature. The ears were small, close-set and queerly pointed. The
eyes, set in death, were narrow, oblique and of a strange yellowish
colour. The nose was thin and hooked, like the beak of a bird of
prey, the mouth a wide cruel gash, whose thin lips, writhed in a
death snarl and flecked with foam, disclosed wolfish fangs.</p>

<p>The creature, which was naked and hairless, was not unlike a
human being in other ways. The shoulders were broad and powerful,
the neck long and lean. The arms were long and muscular, the thumb
being set beside the fingers after the manner of the great apes.
Fingers and thumbs were armed with heavy hooked talons. The chest
was curiously misshapen, the breast-bone jutting out like the keel
of a ship, the ribs curving back from it. The legs were long and
wiry with huge, hand-like, prehensile feet, the great toe set
opposite the rest like a man's thumb. The claws on the toes were
merely long nails.</p>

<p>But the most curious feature of this curious creature was on its
back. A pair of great wings, shaped much like the wings of a moth
but with a bony frame and of leathery substance, grew from its
shoulders, beginning at a point just back and above where the arms
joined the shoulders, and extending half way to the narrow hips.
These wings, Kane reckoned, would measure some eighteen feet from
tip to tip.</p>

<p>He laid hold of the creature, involuntarily shuddering at the
slick, hard, leather-like feel of the skin, and half-lifted it. The
weight was little more than half as much as it would have been in a
man the same height&mdash;some six and a half feet. Evidently the
bones were of a peculiar bird-like structure and the flesh
consisted almost entirely of stringy muscles.</p>

<p>Kane stepped back, surveying the thing again. Then his dream had
been no dream after all&mdash;that foul thing or another like it
had in grisly reality lighted in the tree beside him&mdash;a whir
of mighty wings! A sudden rush through the sky! Even as Kane
whirled he realized he had committed the jungle-farer's
unpardonable crime&mdash;he had allowed his astonishment and
curiosity to throw him off guard. Already a winged fiend was at his
throat and there was no time to draw and fire his other pistol.
Kane saw, in a maze of thrashing wings, a devilish, semi-human
face&mdash;he felt those wings battering at him&mdash;he felt cruel
talons sink deep into his breast; then he was dragged off his feet
and felt empty space beneath him.</p>

<p>The winged man had wrapped his limbs about the Englishman's legs
and the talons he had driven into Kane's breast muscles held like
fanged vices. The wolf-like fangs drove at Kane's throat, but the
Puritan gripped the bony throat and thrust back the grisly head,
while with his right hand he strove to draw his dirk. The birdman
was mounting slowly and a fleeting glance showed Kane that they
were already high above the trees. The Englishman did not hope to
survive this battle in the sky, for even if he slew his foe, he
would be dashed to death in the fall. But with the innate ferocity
of the fighting man he set himself grimly to take his captor with
him.</p>

<p>Holding those keen fangs at bay, Kane managed to draw his dirk,
and he plunged it deep into the body of the monster. The bat-man
veered wildly and a rasping, raucous screech burst from his
half-throttled throat. He floundered wildly, beating frantically
with his great wings, bowing his back and twisting his head
fiercely in a vain effort to free it and sink home his deadly
fangs. He sank the talons of one hand agonizingly deeper and deeper
into Kane's breast muscles, while with the other he tore at his
foe's head and body. But the Englishman, gashed and bleeding, with
the silent and tenacious savagery of a bulldog, sank his fingers
deeper into the lean neck and drove his dirk home again and again,
while far below awed eyes watched the fiendish battle that was
raging at that dizzy height.</p>

<p>They had drifted out over the plateau, and the fast-weakening
wings of the bat-man barely supported their weight. They were
sinking earthward swiftly, but Kane, blinded with blood and battle
fury, knew nothing of this. With a great piece of his scalp hanging
loose, his chest and shoulders cut and ripped, the world had become
a blind, red thing in which he was aware of but one
sensation&mdash;the bulldog urge to kill his foe.</p>

<p>Now the feeble and spasmodic beating of the dying monster's
wings held them hovering for an instant above a thick grove of
gigantic trees, while Kane felt the grip of claws and twining limbs
grow weaker and the slashing of the talons become a futile
flailing.</p>

<p>With a last burst of power he drove the reddened dirk straight
through the breastbone and felt a convulsive tremor run through the
creature's frame. The great wings fell limp&mdash;and victor and
vanquished dropped headlong and plummet-like earthward.</p>

<p>Through a red wave Kane saw the waving branches rushing up to
meet them&mdash;he felt them flail his face and tear at his
clothing, as still locked in that death-clinch he rushed downward
through leaves which eluded his vainly grasping hand; then his head
crashed against a great limb, and an endless abyss of blackness
engulfed him.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch3" name="ch3">3. &mdash; THE PEOPLE IN THE SHADOW</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THROUGH colossal, black basaltic corridors of
night, Solomon Kane fled for a thousand years. Gigantic winged
demons, horrific in the utter darkness, swept over him with a rush
of great bat-like pinions and in the blackness he fought with them
as a cornered rat fights a vampire bat, while fleshless jaws
drooled fearful blasphemies and horrid secrets in his ears, and the
skulls of men rolled under his groping feet.</p>

<p>Solomon Kane came back suddenly from the land of delirium, and
his first sight of sanity was that of a fat, kindly native face
bending over him. Kane saw he was in a roomy, clean and
well-ventilated hut, while from a cooking pot bubbling outside
wafted savoury scents. Kane realized he was ravenously hungry. And
he was strangely weak. The hand he lifted to his bandaged head
shook, and its bronze was dimmed.</p>

<p>The fat man and another, a tall, gaunt, grim-faced warrior, bent
over him, and the fat man said: "He is awake, Kuroba, and of sound
mind." The gaunt man nodded and called something which was answered
from without.</p>

<p>"What is this place?" asked Kane in a language he had learned
that was similar to the dialect the black had used. "How long have
I lain here?"</p>

<p>"This is the last village of Bogonda." The fat man pressed him
back with hands as gentle as a woman's. "We found you lying beneath
the trees on the slopes, badly wounded and senseless. You have
raved in delirium for many days. Now eat."</p>

<p>A lithe young warrior entered with a wooden bowl full of
steaming food, and Kane ate ravenously.</p>

<p>"He is like a leopard, Kuroba," said the fat man admiringly.
"Not one in a thousand would have lived with his wounds."</p>

<p>"Aye," returned the other. "And he slew the akaana that rent
him, Goru."</p>

<p>Kane struggled to his elbows. "Goru?" he cried fiercely. "The
priest who binds men to stakes for devils to eat?"</p>

<p>And he strove to rise so that he could strangle the fat man, but
his weakness swept over him like a wave, the hut swam dizzily to
his eyes, and he sank back panting, where he soon fell into a
sound, natural sleep.</p>

<p class="cpb">*</p>

<p>Later he awoke and found a slim young girl, named Nayela,
watching him. She fed him, and feeling much stronger, Kane asked
questions which she answered shyly but intelligently.</p>

<p>This was Bogonda, ruled by Kuroba the chief and Goru the priest.
None in Bogonda had ever seen or heard of a white man before. She
counted the days Kane had lain helpless, and he was amazed. But
such a battle as he had been through was enough to kill an ordinary
man. He wondered that no bones had been broken, but the girl said
the branches had broken his fall and he had landed on the body of
the akaana. He asked for Goru, and the fat priest came to him,
bringing Kane's weapons.</p>

<p>"Some we found with you where you lay." said Goru, "some by the
body of the akaana you slew with the weapon which speaks in fire
and smoke. You must be a god&mdash;yet the gods bleed not and you
have just all but died. Who are you?"</p>

<p>"I am no god," Kane answered, "but a man like yourself. I come
from a far land amid the sea, which land, mind ye, is the fairest
and noblest of all lands. My name is Solomon Kane and I am a
landless wanderer. From the lips of a dying man I first heard your
name. Yet your face seemeth kindly."</p>

<p>A shadow crossed the eyes of the shaman, and he hung his
head.</p>

<p>"Rest and grow strong, oh man, or god or whatever you be," said
he, "and in time you will learn of the ancient curse that rests
upon this ancient land."</p>

<p class="cpb">*</p>

<p>And in the days that followed, while Kane recovered and grew
strong with the wild beast vitality that was his, Goru and Kuroba
sat and spoke to him at length, telling him many curious
things.</p>

<p>Their tribe was not aboriginal here, but had come upon the
plateau a hundred and fifty years before, giving it the name of
their former home. They had once been a powerful tribe in Old
Bogonda, on a great river far to the south. But tribal wars broke
their power, and at last before a concerted uprising, the whole
tribe gave way, and Goru repeated legends of that great flight of a
thousand miles through jungle and swampland, harried at every step
by cruel foes.</p>

<p>At last, hacking their way through a country of ferocious
cannibals, they found themselves safe from man's attack&mdash;but
prisoners in a trap from which neither they nor their descendants
could ever escape. They were in the horror-country of Akaana, and
Goru said his ancestors came to understand the jeering laughter of
the man eaters who had hounded them to the very borders of the
plateau.</p>

<p>The Bogondi found a fertile country with good water and plenty
of game. There were numbers of goats and a species of wild pig that
throve here in great abundance. At first the black people ate these
pigs, but later they spared them for a good reason. The grasslands
between plateau and jungle swarmed with antelopes, buffaloes and
the like, and there were many lions. Lions also roamed the plateau,
but Bogonda meant "Lion-slayer" in their tongue and it was not many
moons before the remnants of the great cats took to the lower
levels. But it was not lions they had to fear, as Goru's ancestors
soon learned.</p>

<p>Finding that the cannibals would not come past the savannas,
they rested from their long trek and built two villages&mdash;Upper
and Lower Bogonda. Kane was in Upper Bogonda; he had seen the ruins
of the lower village. But soon they found that they had strayed
into a country of nightmares with dripping fangs and talons. They
heard the beat of mighty wings at night, and saw horrific shadows
cross the stars and loom against the moon. Children began to
disappear and at last a young hunter strayed off into the hills,
where night overtook him. And in the grey light of dawn a mangled,
half-devoured corpse fell from the skies into the village street
and a whisper of ogreish laughter from high above froze the
horrified on-lookers. Then a little later the full horror of their
position burst upon the Bogondi.</p>

<p>At first the winged men were afraid of the black people. They
hid themselves and ventured from their caverns only at night. Then
they grew bolder. In the full daylight, a warrior shot one with an
arrow, but the fiends had learned they could slay a human, and its
death scream brought a score of the devils dropping from the skies,
who tore the slayer to pieces in full sight of the tribe.</p>

<p>The Bogondi then prepared to leave that devil's country and a
hundred warriors went up into the hills to find a pass. They found
steep walls, up which a man must climb laboriously, and they found
the cliffs honeycombed with caves where the winged men dwelt.</p>

<p>Then was fought the first pitched battle between men and
bat-men, and it resulted in a crushing victory for the monsters.
The bows and spears of the black people proved futile before the
swoops of the taloned fiends, and of all that hundred that went up
into the hills, not one survived; for the akaanas hunted down those
that fled and dragged down the last one within bowshot of the upper
village.</p>

<p>Then it was that the Bogondi, seeing they could not hope to win
through the hills, sought to fight their way out again the way they
had come. But a great horde of cannibals met them in the
grasslands, and in a great battle that lasted nearly all day,
hurled them back, broken and defeated. And Goru said while the
battle raged, the skies were thronged with hideous shapes, circling
above and laughing their fearful mirth to see men die
wholesale.</p>

<p>So the survivors of those two battles, licking their wounds,
bowed to the inevitable with the fatalistic philosophy of the block
man. Some fifteen hundred men, women and children remained, and
they built their huts, tilled the soil and lived stolidly in the
shadow of the nightmare.</p>

<p>In those days there were many of the bird-people, and they might
have wiped out the Bogondi utterly, had they wished. No one warrior
could cope with an akaana, for he was stronger than a human, he
struck as a hawk strikes, and if he missed, his wings carried him
out of reach of a counterblow.</p>

<p>Here Kane interrupted to ask why the Bogondi did not make war on
the demons with arrows. But Goru answered that it took a quick and
accurate archer to strike an akaana in midair at all, and so tough
were their hides that unless the arrow struck squarely it would not
penetrate. Kane knew that the natives were very indifferent bowmen
and that they pointed their shafts with chipped stone, bone, or
hammered iron almost as soft as copper; he thought of Poitiers and
Agincourt and wished grimly for a file of stout English
archers&mdash;or a rank of musketeers.</p>

<p>But Goru said the akaanas did not seem to wish to destroy the
Bogondi utterly. Their chief food consisted of the little pigs
which then swarmed the plateau, and young goats. Sometimes they
went out on the savannas for antelope, but they distrusted the open
country and feared the lions. Nor did they haunt the jungles
beyond, for the trees grew too close for the spread of their wings.
They kept to the hills and the plateau&mdash;and what lay beyond
those hills none in Bogonda knew.</p>

<p>The akaanas allowed the Bogondi to inhabit the plateau much as
men allow wild animals to thrive, or stock lakes with
fish&mdash;for their own pleasure. The bat-people, said Goru, had a
strange and grisly sense of humour which was tickled by the
sufferings of a howling human. Those grim hills had echoed to cries
that turned men's hearts to ice.</p>

<p>But for many years, Goru said, once the Bogondi learned not to
resist their masters, the akaanas were content to snatch up a baby
from time to time, or devour a young girl strayed from the village
or a youth whom night caught outside the walls. The bat-folk
distrusted the village; they circled high above it but did not
venture within. There the Bogondi were safe until late years.</p>

<p>Goru said that the akaanas were fast dying out; once there had
been hope that the remnants of his race would outlast them&mdash;in
which event, he said fatalistically, the cannibals would
undoubtedly come up from the jungle and put the survivors in their
cooking pots. Now he doubted if there were more than a hundred and
fifty akaanas altogether. Kane asked him why did not the warriors
then sally forth on a great hunt and destroy the devils utterly,
and Goru smiled a bitter smile and repeated his remarks about the
prowess of the bat-people in battle. Moreover, said he, the whole
tribe of Bogonda numbered only about four hundred souls now, and
the bat-people were their only protection against the cannibals to
the west.</p>

<p>Goru said the tribe had thinned more in the past thirty years
than in all the years previous. As the numbers of the akaanas
dwindled, their hellish savagery increased. They seized more and
more of the Bogondi to torture and devour in their grim black caves
high up in the hills, and Goru spoke of sudden raids on hunting
parties and toilers in the plantain fields, and of the nights made
ghastly by horrible screams and gibberings from the dark hills, and
blood-freezing laughter that was half-human; of dismembered limbs
and gory grinning heads flung from the skies to fall in the
shuddering village, and of grisly feasts among the stars.</p>

<p>Then came drought, Goru said, and a great famine. Many of the
springs dried up and the crops of rice and yams and plantains
failed. The gnus, deer, and buffaloes which had formed the main
part of Bogonda's meat diet withdrew to the jungle in quest of
water, and the lions, their hunger overcoming their fear of man,
ranged into the uplands. Many of the tribe died, and the rest were
driven by hunger to eat the pigs which were the natural prey of the
bat-people. This angered the akaanas and thinned the pigs. Famine,
Bogondi, and the lions destroyed all the goats and half the
pigs.</p>

<p>At last the famine was past, but the damage was done. Of all the
great droves which once swarmed the plateau, only a remnant was
left, and these were hard to catch. The Bogondi had eaten the pigs,
so the akaanas ate the Bogondi. Life became a hell for the black
people, and the lower village, numbering now only some hundred and
fifty souls, rose in revolt. Driven to frenzy by repeated outrages,
they turned on their masters. An akaana lighting in the very
streets to steal a child was set on and shot to death with arrows.
And the people of Lower Bogonda drew into their huts and waited for
their doom.</p>

<p>And in the night, said Goru, it came. The akaanas had overcome
their distrust of the huts. The full flock of them swarmed down
from the hills, and Upper Bogonda awoke to hear the fearful
cataclysm of screams and blasphemies that marked the end of the
other village. All night Goru's people had lain sweating in terror,
not daring to move, harkening to the howling and gibbering that
rent the night. At last these sounds ceased, Goru said, wiping the
cold sweat from his brow, but sounds of grisly and obscene feasting
still haunted the night with demon's mockery.</p>

<p>In the early dawn, Goru's people saw the hell-flock winging back
to their hills, like demons flying back to hell through the dawn.
They flew slowly and heavily, like gorged vultures. Later the
people dared to steal down to the accursed village, and what they
found there sent them shrieking away. And to that day, Goru said,
no man passed within three bow shots of that silent horror. And
Kane nodded in understanding, his cold eyes more sombre than
ever.</p>

<p><br>
FOR many days after that, Goru said the people waited in quaking
fear. Finally in desperation of fear, which breeds unspeakable
cruelty, the tribe cast lots, and the loser was bound to a stake
between the two villages, in hopes that the akaanas would recognize
this as a token of submission so that the people of Bogonda might
escape the fate of their kinsmen. The custom, said Goru, had been
borrowed from the cannibals who in old times worshipped the akaanas
and offered a human sacrifice at each moon. But chance had shown
them that the akaanas could be killed, so they ceased to worship
them&mdash;at least that was Goru's deduction, and he explained at
much length that no mortal thing is worthy of real adoration,
however evil or powerful it may be.</p>

<p>His own ancestors had made occasional sacrifices to placate the
winged devils, but until lately it had not been a regular custom.
Now it was necessary; the akaanas expected it, and each moon they
chose from their waning numbers a strong young man or a girl whom
they bound to the stake.</p>

<p>Kane watched Goru's face closely as he spoke of his sorrow for
this unspeakable necessity, and the Englishman realized that the
priest was sincere. Kane shuddered at the thought of a tribe of
human beings thus passing slowly but surely into the maws of a race
of monsters.</p>

<p>Kane spoke of the wretch he had seen, and Goru nodded, pain in
his soft eyes. For a day and a night he had been hanging there,
while the akaanas glutted their vile torture-lust on his quivering,
agonized flesh. Thus far the sacrifices had kept doom from the
village. The remaining pigs furnished sustenance for the dwindling
akaanas, together with an occasional baby snatched up, and they
were content to have their nameless sport with the single victim
each moon.</p>

<p>A thought came to Kane.</p>

<p>"The cannibals never come up into the plateau?"</p>

<p>Goru shook his head; safe in their jungle, they never raided
past the savannas.</p>

<p>"But they hunted me to the very foot of the hills."</p>

<p>Again Goru shook his head. There was only one cannibal; they had
found his footprints. Evidently a single warrior, bolder than the
rest, had allowed his passion for the chase to overcome his fear of
the grisly plateau and had paid the penalty. Kane's teeth came
together with a vicious snap which ordinarily took the place of
profanity with him. He was stung by the thought of fleeing so long
from a single enemy. No wonder that enemy had followed so
cautiously, waiting until dark to attack. But, asked Kane, why had
the akaana seized the black man instead of himself&mdash;and why
had he not been attacked by the bat-man who alighted in his tree
that night?</p>

<p>The cannibal was bleeding, Goru answered. The scent called the
bat-fiend to attack, for they scented raw blood as far as vultures.
And they were very wary. They had never seen a man like Kane, who
showed no fear. Surely they had decided to spy on him, take him off
guard before they struck.</p>

<p>Who were these creatures? Kane asked. Goru shrugged his
shoulders. They were there when his ancestors came, who had never
heard of them before they saw them. There was no intercourse with
the cannibals, so they could learn nothing from them. The akaanas
lived in caves, naked like beasts; they knew nothing of fire and
ate only fresh, raw meat. But they had a language of a sort and
acknowledged a king among them. Many died in the great famine when
the stronger ate the weaker. They were vanishing swiftly; of late
years no females or young had been observed among them. When these
males died at last, there would be no more akaanas; but Bogonda,
observed Goru, was doomed already, unless&mdash;he looked strangely
and wistfully at Kane. But the Puritan was deep in thought.</p>

<p>Among the swarm of native legends he had heard on his
wanderings, one now stood out. Long, long ago, an old, old ju-ju
man had told him, winged devils came flying out of the north and
passed over his country, vanishing in the maze of the
jungle-haunted south. And the ju-ju man related an old, old legend
concerning these creatures&mdash;that once they had abode in myriad
numbers far on a great lake of bitter water many moons to the
north, and ages and ages ago a chieftain and his warriors fought
them with bows and arrows and slew many, driving the rest into the
south. The name of the chief was N'Yasunna and he owned a great war
canoe with many oars driving it swiftly through the bitter
water.</p>

<p>And now a cold wind blew suddenly on Solomon Kane, as if from a
door opened suddenly on Outer gulfs of Time and Space. For now he
realized the truth of that garbled myth, and the truth of an older,
grimmer legend. For what was the great bitter lake but the
Mediterranean Ocean and who was the chief N'Yasunna but the hero
Jason, who conquered the harpies and drove them&mdash;not alone
into the Strophades Isles but into Africa as well?</p>

<p>The old pagan tale was true then, Kane thought dizzily,
shrinking aghast from the strange realm of grisly possibilities
this opened up. For if this myth of the harpies were a reality,
what of the other legends&mdash;the Hydra, the centaurs, the
chimera, Medusa, Pan, and the satyrs?</p>

<p>All those myths of antiquity&mdash;behind them did there lie and
lurk nightmare realities with slavering fangs and talons steeped in
shuddersome evil? Africa, the Dark Continent, land of shadows and
horror, of bewitchment and sorcery, into which all evil things had
been banished before the growing light of the western world!</p>

<p>Kane came out of his reveries with a start. Goru was tugging
gently and timidly at his sleeve.</p>

<p>"Save us from the akaanas!" said Goru. "If you be not a god,
there is the power of a god in you! You bear in your hand the
mighty ju-ju stave which has in times gone by been the sceptre of
fallen empires and the staff of mighty priests. And you have
weapons which speak death in fire and smoke&mdash;for our young men
watched and saw you slay two akaanas. We will make you
king&mdash;god&mdash;what you will! More than a moon has passed
since you came into Bogonda and the time for the sacrifice is gone
by, but the bloody stake stands bare. The akaanas shun the village
where you lie; they steal no more babes from us. We have thrown off
their yoke because our trust is in you!"</p>

<p>Kane clasped his temples with his hands. "You know not what you
ask!" he cried. "God knoweth it is in my deepest heart to rid the
land of this evil, but I am no god. With my pistols I can slay a
few of the fiends, but I have but a little powder left. Had I great
store of powder and ball, and the musket I shattered in the
vampire-haunted Hills of the Dead, then indeed would there be a
rare hunting. But even if I slew all those fiends, what of the
cannibals?"</p>

<p>"They too will fear you!" cried old Kuroba, while the girl
Nayela and the lad, Loga, who was to have been the next sacrifice,
gazed at his wife, their souls in their eyes. Kane dropped his chin
on his fist and sighed.</p>

<p>"Yet will I stay here in Bogonda all the rest of my life if ye
think I be protection to the people."</p>

<p>So Solomon Kane stayed at the village of Bogonda of the Shadow.
The people were a kindly folk, whose natural sprightliness and
fun-loving spirits were subdued and saddened by long dwelling in
the Shadow. But now they had taken new heart by the Englishman's
coming, and it wrenched Kane's heart to note the pathetic trust
they placed in him. Now they sang in the plaintain fields and
danced about the fire, and gazed at him with adoring faith in their
eyes. But Kane, cursing his own helplessness, knew how futile would
be his fancied protection if the winged fiends swept suddenly out
of the skies.</p>

<p>But he stayed in Bogonda. In his dreams, the gulls wheeled above
the cliffs of old Devon, carved in the clean, blue, wind-whipped
skies, and in the day the call of the unknown lands beyond Bogonda
clawed at his heart with fierce yearning. But he abode in Bogonda
and racked his brains for a plan. He sat and gazed for hours at the
ju-ju stave, hoping in desperation that black magic would aid him,
where his mind failed. But N'Longa's ancient gift gave him no aid.
Once he had summoned the Slave Coast shaman to him across leagues
of intervening space&mdash;but it was only when confronted with
supernatural manifestations that N'Longa could come to him, and
these harpies were not supernatural.</p>

<p>The germ of an idea began to grow at the back of Kane's mind,
but he discarded it. It had to do with a great trap&mdash;and how
could the akaanas be trapped? The roaring of lions played a grim
accompaniment to his brooding meditations. As man dwindled on the
plateau, the hunting beasts who feared only the spears of the
hunters were beginning to gather. Kane laughed bitterly. It was not
lions, that might be hunted down and slain singly, that he had to
deal with.</p>

<p>At some little distance from the village stood the great hut of
Goru, once a council hall. This hut was full of many strange
fetishes which, Goru said with a helpless wave of his fat hands,
were strong magic against evil spirits but scant protection against
winged hellions of gristle and bone and flesh.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch4" name="ch4">4. &mdash; THE MADNESS OF SOLOMON</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">KANE woke suddenly from a dreamless sleep. A
hideous medley of screams burst horrific in his ears. Outside his
hut, people were dying in the night, horribly, as cattle die in the
shambles. He had slept, as always, with his weapons buckled on him.
Now he bounded to the door, and something fell mouthing and
slavering at his feet to grasp his knees in a convulsive grin and
gibber incoherent pleas.</p>

<p>In the faint light of a smouldering fire near by, Kane in horror
recognized the face of the youth Loga, now frightfully torn and
drenched in blood, already freezing into a death mask. The night
was full of fearful sounds, inhuman howling mingled with the
whisper of mighty wings, the tearing of thatch and a ghastly
demon-laughter. Kane freed himself from the locked dead arms and
sprang to the dying fire. He could make out only a confused and
vague maze of fleeing forms and darting shapes, the shift and blur
of dark wings against the stars.</p>

<p>He snatched up a brand and thrust it against the thatch of his
hut&mdash;and as the flame leaped up and showed him the scene he
stood frozen and aghast. Red, howling doom had fallen on Bogonda.
Winged monsters raced screaming through her streets, wheeled above
the heads of the fleeing people, or tore apart the hut thatches to
get at the gibbering victims within.</p>

<p>With a choked cry the Englishman woke from his trance of horror,
drew and fired at a darting flame-eyed shadow which fell at his
feet with a shattered skull. And Kane gave tongue to one deep,
fierce roar and bounded into the melee, all the berserk fury of his
heathen Saxon ancestors bursting into terrible being.</p>

<p>Dazed and bewildered by the sudden attack, cowed by long years
of submission, the Bogondi were incapable of combined resistance
and for the most part died like sheep. Some, maddened by
desperation, fought back, but their arrows went wild or glanced
from the tough wings while the devilish agility of the creatures
made spear thrust and axe stroke uncertain. Leaping from the ground
they avoided the blows of their victims and, sweeping down upon
their shoulders, dashed them to earth where fang and talon did
their crimson work.</p>

<p>Kane saw old Kuroba, gaunt and bloodstained, at bay against a
hut wall with his foot on the neck of a monster who had not been
quick enough. The grim-faced old chief wielded a two-handed axe in
great sweeping blows that for the moment held back the screeching
onset of half a dozen of the devils. Kane was leaping to his aid
when a low, pitiful whimper checked him. The girl Nayela writhed
weakly, prone in the bloody dust, while on her back a vulture-like
thing crouched and tore. Her dulling eyes sought the face of the
Englishman in anguished appeal.</p>

<p>Kane ripped out a bitter oath and fired point blank. The winged
devil pitched backward with an abhorrent screeching and a wild
flutter of dying wings, and Kane bent to the dying girl. She
whimpered and kissed his hands with uncertain lips as he cradled
her head in his arms. Her eyes set.</p>

<p>Kane laid the body gently down, looking for Kuroba. He saw only
a huddled cluster of grisly shapes that sucked and tore at
something between them. And Kane went mad. With a scream that cut
through the inferno he bounded up, slaying even as he rose. Even in
the act of lunging up from bent knee he drew and thrust,
transfixing a vulture-like throat. Then whipping out his rapier as
the thing floundered and twitched in its death struggle, the raging
Puritan charged forward seeking new victims.</p>

<p>On all sides of him the people of Bogonda were dying hideously.
They fought futilely or they fled and the demons coursed them down
as a hawk courses a hare. They ran into the huts and the fiends
rent the thatch or burst the door, and what took place in those
huts was mercifully hidden from Kane's eyes.</p>

<p>And to the frantic Puritan's horror-distorted brain it seemed
that he alone was responsible. The black fold had trusted him to
save them. They had withheld the sacrifice and defied their grim
masters. Now they were paying the horrible penalty and he was
unable to save them. In the agony-dimmed eyes turned toward him,
Kane quaffed the black dregs of the bitter cup. It was hot anger or
the vindictiveness of fear. It was hurt and a stunned reproach. He
was their god and he had failed them.</p>

<p>Now he ravened through the massacre and the fiends avoided him,
turning to the easy victims. But Kane was not to be denied. In a
red haze that was not of the burning hut, he saw a culminating
horror; a harpy gripped a writhing naked thing that had been a
woman, and the wolfish fangs gorged deep. As Kane sprang,
thrusting, the bat-man dropped his yammering, mewing prey and
soared aloft. But Kane dropped his rapier and with the bound of a
blood-mad panther caught the demon's throat and locked his iron
legs about its lower body.</p>

<p>Once again he found himself battling in mid-air, but this time
close above the hut roofs. Terror had entered the cold brain of the
harpy. He did not fight to hold and slay; he wished only to be rid
of this silent, clinging thing that stabbed so savagely for his
life. He floundered wildly, screaming abhorrently and thrashing
with his wings, then as Kane's dirk bit deeper, dipped suddenly
sidewise and fell headlong.</p>

<p>The thatch of a hut broke their fall, and Kane and the dying
harpy crashed through to land on a writhing mass on the hut floor.
In the lurid flickering of the burning hut outside that vaguely
lighted the hut into which he had fallen, Kane saw a deed of
brain-shaking horror being enacted&mdash;red-dripping fangs in a
yawning gash of a mouth, and a crimson travesty of a human form
that still writhed with agonized life. Then, in the maze of madness
that held him, his steel fingers closed on the fiend's throat in a
grip that no tearing of talons or hammering of wings could loosen,
until he felt the horrid life flow out from under his fingers and
the bony neck hung broken.</p>

<p>Outside, the red madness of slaughter continued. Kane bounded
up, his hand closing blindly on the haft of some weapon, and as he
leaped from the hut a harpy soared from under his very feet. It was
an axe that Kane had snatched up, and he dealt a stroke that
spattered the demon's brains like water. He sprang forward,
stumbling over bodies and parts of bodies, blood streaming from a
dozen wounds, and then halted baffled and screaming with rage.</p>

<p>The bat-people were taking to the air. No longer would they face
this strange madman who in his insanity was more terrible than
they. But they went not alone into the upper regions. In their
lustful talons they bore writhing, screaming forms, and Kane,
raging to and fro with his dripping axe, found himself alone in a
corpse-choked village.</p>

<p>He threw back his head to shriek his hate at the fiends above
him and he felt warm, thick drops fall into his face, while the
shadowy skies were filled with screams of agony and the laughter of
monsters.</p>

<p>As the sounds of that ghastly feast in the skies filled the
night and the blood that rained from the stars fell into his face,
Kane's last vestige of reason snapped. He gibbered to and fro,
screaming chaotic blasphemies.</p>

<p>And was he not a symbol of Man, staggering among the
tooth-marked bones and severed grinning heads of humans,
brandishing a futile axe, and screaming incoherent hate at the
grisly, winged shapes of Night that make him their prey, chuckling
in demoniac triumph above him and dripping into his mad eyes the
pitiful blood of their human victims?</p>

<h2><a id="ch5" name="ch5">5. &mdash; THE CONQUEROR</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">A SHUDDERING, white-faced dawn crept over the
black hills to shiver above the red shambles that had been the
village of Bogonda. The huts stood intact, except for the one which
had sunk to smouldering coals, but the thatches of many were torn.
Dismembered bones, half or wholly stripped of flesh, lay in the
streets, and some were splintered as though they had been dropped
from a great height.</p>

<p>It was a realm of the dead where was but one sign of life.
Solomon Kane leaned on his blood-clotted axe and gazed upon the
scene with dull, mad eyes. He was grimed and clotted with
half-dried blood from long gashes on chest, face, and shoulders,
but he paid no heed to his hurts.</p>

<p>The people of Bogonda had not died alone. Seventeen harpies lay
among the bones. Six of these Kane had slain. The rest had fallen
before the frantic dying desperation of the black people. But it
was poor toll to take in return. Of the four hundred-odd people of
Upper Bogonda, not one had lived to see the dawn. And the harpies
were gone&mdash;back to their caves in the black hills, gorged to
repletion.</p>

<p>With slow, mechanical steps Kane went about gathering up his
weapons. He found his sword, dirk, pistols, and the ju-ju stave. He
left the main village and went up the slope to the great hut of
Goru. And there he halted, stung by a new horror. The ghastly humor
of the harpies had prompted a delicious jest. Above the hut door
stared the severed head of Goru. The fat cheeks were shrunken, the
lips lolled in an aspect of horrified idiocy, and the eyes stared
like a hurt child. And in those dead eyes Kane saw wonder and
reproach.</p>

<p>Kane looked at the shambles that had been Bogonda, and he looked
at the death mask of Goru. And he lifted his clenched fists above
his head, and with glaring eyes raised and writhing lips flecked
with froth, he cursed the sky and the earth and the spheres above
and below. He cursed the cold stars, the blazing sun, the mocking
moon, and the whisper of the wind. He cursed all fates and
destinies, all that he had loved or hated, the silent cities
beneath the seas, the past ages and the future aeons. In one
soul-shaking burst of blasphemy he cursed the gods and devils who
make mankind their sport, and he cursed Man who lives blindly on
and blindly offers his back to the iron-hoofed feet of his
gods.</p>

<p>Then as breath failed he halted, panting. From the lower reaches
sounded the deep roaring of a lion and into the eyes of Solomon
Kane came a crafty gleam. He stood long, as one frozen, and out of
his madness grew a desperate plan. And he silently recanted his
blasphemy, for if the brazen-hoofed gods made Man for their sport
and plaything, they also gave him a brain that holds craft and
cruelty greater than any other living thing.</p>

<p>"There you shall bide," said Solomon Kane to the head of Goru.
"The sun will wither you and the cold dews of night will shrivel
you. But I will keep the kites from you and your eyes shall see the
fall of your slayers. Aye, I could not save the people of Bogonda,
but by the God of my race, I can avenge them. Man is the sport and
sustenance of titanic beings of Night and Horror whose giant wings
hover ever above him. But even evil things may come to an
end&mdash;and watch ye, Goru."</p>

<p>In the days that followed Kane laboured mightily, beginning with
the first grey light of dawn and toiling on past sunset, into the
white moonlight till he fell and slept the sleep of utter
exhaustion. He snatched food as he worked and he gave his wounds
absolutely no heed, scarcely being aware that they healed of
themselves. He went down into the lower levels and cut bamboo,
great stacks of long, tough stalks. He cut thick branches of trees,
and tough vines to serve as ropes.</p>

<p>With this material he reinforced the walls and roof of Goru's
hut. He set the bamboos deep in the earth, hard against the wall,
and interwove and twined them, binding them fast with the vines
that were pliant and tough as cords. The long branches he made fast
along the thatch, binding them close together. When he had
finished, an elephant could scarcely have burst through the
walls.</p>

<p>The lions had come into the plateau in great numbers and the
herds of little pigs dwindled fast. Those the lions spared, Kane
slew, and tossed to the jackals. This racked Kane's heart, for he
was a kindly man and this wholesale slaughter, even of pigs who
would fall prey to hunting beasts anyhow, grieved him. But it was
part of his plan of vengeance, and he steeled his heart.</p>

<p>The days stretched into weeks. Kane tolled by day and by night,
and between his stints he talked to the shrivelled, mummied head of
Goru, whose eyes, strangely enough, did not change in the blaze of
the sun or the haunt of the moon, but retained their life-like
expression. When the memory of those lunacy-haunted days had become
only a vague nightmare, Kane wondered if, as it had seemed to him,
Goru's dried lips had moved in answer, speaking strange and
mysterious things.</p>

<p>Kane saw the akaanas wheeling against the sky at a distance, but
they did not come near, even when he slept in the great hut,
pistols at hand. They feared his power to deal death with smoke and
thunder.</p>

<p>At first he noted that they flew sluggishly, gorged with the
flesh they had eaten on that red night, and the bodies they had
borne to their caves. But as the weeks passed they appeared leaner
and leaner and ranged far afield in search of food. And Kane
laughed, deeply and madly.</p>

<p>This plan of his would never have worked before, but now there
were no humans to fill the bellies of the harpy-folk. And there
were no more pigs. In all the plateau there were no creatures for
the bat-people to eat. Why they did not range east of the hills,
Kane thought he knew. That must be a region of thick jungle like
the country to the west. He saw them fly into the grassland for
antelopes and he saw the lions take toll of them. After all, the
akaanas were weak beings among the hunters, strong enough only to
slay pigs and deer&mdash;and humans.</p>

<p>At last they began to soar close to him at night, and he saw
their greedy eyes glaring at him through the gloom. He judged the
time was ripe. Huge buffaloes, too big and ferocious for the
bat-people to slay, had strayed up into the plateau to ravage the
deserted fields of the dead black people. Kane cut one of these out
of the herd and drove him, with shouts and volleys of stones, to
the hut of Goru. It was a tedious, dangerous task, and time and
again Kane barely escaped the surly bull's sudden charges, but
persevered and at last shot the beast before the hut.</p>

<p>A strong west wind was blowing and Kane flung handfuls of blood
into the air for the scent to waft to the harpies in the hills. He
cut the bull to pieces and carried its quarters into the hut, then
managed to drag the huge trunk itself inside. Then he retired into
the thick trees nearby and waited.</p>

<p>He had not long to wait. The morning air filled suddenly with
the beat of many wings, and a hideous flock alighted before the hut
of Goru. All of the beasts&mdash;or men&mdash;seemed to be there,
and Kane gazed in wonder at the tall, strange creatures, so like to
humanity and yet so unlike&mdash;the veritable demons of priestly
legend. They folded their wings like cloaks about them as they
walked upright, and they talked to one another in a strident,
crackling voice that had nothing of the human in it.</p>

<p>No, Kane decided, these things were not men. They were the
materialization of some ghastly jest of Nature&mdash;some travesty
of the world's infancy when Creation was an experiment. Perhaps
they were the offspring of a forbidden and obscene mating of man
and beast; more likely they were a freakish offshoot on the branch
of evolution&mdash;for Kane had long ago dimly sensed a truth in
the heretical theories of the ancient philosophers, that Man is but
a higher beast. And if Nature made many strange beasts in the past
ages, why should she not have experimented with monstrous forms of
mankind? Surely Man as Kane knew him was not the first of his breed
to walk the earth, nor yet to be the last.</p>

<p>Now the harpies hesitated, with their natural distrust for a
building, and some soared to the roof and tore at the thatch. But
Kane had built well. They returned to earth and at last, driven
beyond endurance by the smell of raw blood and the sight of the
flesh within, one of them ventured inside. In an instant all were
crowded into the great hut, tearing ravenously at the meat, and
when the last one was within, Kane reached out a hand and jerked a
long vine which tripped the catch that held the door he had built.
It fell with a crash, and the bar he had fashioned dropped into
place. That door would hold against the charge of a wild bull.</p>

<p>Kane came from his cover and scanned the sky. Some hundred and
forty harpies had entered the hut. He saw no more winging through
the skies and believed it safe to suppose he had the whole flock
trapped. Then with a cruel, brooding smile, Kane struck flint and
steel to a pile of dead leaves next to the wall. Within sounded an
uneasy mumbling as the creatures realized that they were prisoners.
A thin wisp of smoke curled upward and a flicker of red followed
it; the whole heap burst into flame and the dry bamboo caught.</p>

<p>A few moments later the whole side of the wall was ablaze. The
fiends inside scented the smoke and grew restless. Kane heard them
cackling wildly and clawing at the walls. He grinned savagely,
bleakly and without mirth. Now a veer of the wind drove the flames
around the wall and up over the thatch&mdash;with a roar the whole
hut caught and leaped into flame.</p>

<p>From within sounded a fearful pandemonium. Kane heard bodies
crash against the walls, which shook to the impact but held. The
horrid screams were music to his soul, and brandishing his arms, he
answered them with screams of fearful, soul-shaking laughter. The
cataclysm of horror rose unbearably, paling the tumult of the
flames. Then it dwindled to a medley of strangled gibbering and
gasps as the flames ate in and the smoke thickened. An intolerable
scent of burning flesh pervaded the atmosphere, and had there been
room in Kane's brain for aught else than insane triumph, he would
have shuddered to realize that the scent was of that nauseating and
indescribable odour that only human flesh emits when burning.</p>

<p>From the thick cloud of smoke, Kane saw a mewing, gibbering
thing emerge through the shredding roof and flap slowly and
agonizingly upward on fearfully burned wings. Calmly he aimed and
fired, and the scorched and blinded thing tumbled back into the
flaming mass just as the walls crashed in. To Kane it seemed that
Goru's crumbling face, vanishing in the smoke, split suddenly in a
wide grin, and a sudden shout of exultant human laughter mingled
eerily in the roar of the flames. But the smoke and insane brain
play queer tricks.</p>

<p><br>
KANE stood with the ju-ju stave in one hand and the smoking pistol
in the other, above the smouldering ruins that hid forever from the
sight of man the last of those terrible, semi-human monsters whom
another hero had banished from Europe in an unknown age. Kane
stood, an unconscious statue of triumph&mdash;the ancient empires
fall, the dark-skinned peoples fade and even the demons of
antiquity gasp their last, but over all stands the Aryan barbarian,
white-skinned, cold-eyed, dominant, the supreme fighting man of the
earth, whether he be clad in wolf-hide and horned helmet, or boots
and doublet&mdash;whether he bear in his hand battle-ax or
rapier&mdash;whether he be called Dorian, Saxon or
Englishman&mdash;whether his name is Jason, Hengist or Solomon
Kane.</p>

<p>Smoke curled upward into the morning sky, and the roaring of
foraging lions shook the plateau. Slowly, like light breaking
through mists, sanity returned to him.</p>

<p>"The light of God's morning enters even into dark and lonesome
lands," said Solomon Kane sombrely. "Evil rules in the waste lands
of the earth, but even evil may come to an end. Dawn follows
midnight and even in this lost land the shadows shrink. Strange are
Thy ways, oh God of my people, and who am I to question Thy wisdom?
My feet have fallen in evil ways but Thou hast brought me forth
scatheless and hast made me a scourge for the Powers of Evil. Over
the souls of men spread the condor wings of colossal monsters and
all manner of evil things prey upon the heart and soul and body of
Man. Yet it may be in some far day the shadows shall fade and the
Prince of Darkness be chained forever in his hell. And till then
mankind can but stand up stoutly to the monsters in his own heart
and without, and with the aid of God he may yet triumph."</p>

<p>And Solomon Kane looked up into the silent hills and felt the
silent call of the hills and the unguessed distances beyond; and
Solomon Kane shifted his belt, took his staff firmly in his hand
and turned his face eastward.</p>
