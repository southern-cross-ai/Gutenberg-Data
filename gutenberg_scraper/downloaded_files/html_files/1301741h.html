<h3><a id="note" name="note">NOTE TO SECOND EDITION OF <i>THE WILD
KNIGHT</i></a>
</h3>

<p class="note">I leave these verses as they stand, although they
contain innumerable examples of what I now see to be errors of
literature, and one or two examples of what I have come to think
errors of opinion. But they never had any great merit beyond
genuineness, and I do not wish to spoil that by mixing up two
periods of my life. It will be seen that the philosophy is not
wholly that of my later years, though perhaps a foundation for it.
On two special points embodied in verse I have altered my opinion;
and if I mention what they are I really do not mean it for egoism,
but only for honesty.</p>

<p class="note">In the matter of the "Anglo-American Alliance,"* I
have come to see that our hopes of brotherhood with America are the
same in kind as our hopes of brotherhood with any other of the
great independent nations of Christendom. And a very small study of
history was sufficient to show me that the American nation, which
is a hundred years old, is at least fifty years older than the
Anglo-Saxon race.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* An Alliance]</p>

<p class="note">And in the matter of the Dreyfus* case, while not
having been able to reach any final conclusion about the proper
verdict on the individual, I have come largely to attribute the
difficulty of doing so to the acrid and irrational unanimity of the
English press. My position may be roughly stated thus: There may
have been a fog of injustice in the French courts; I know that
there was a fog of injustice in the English newspapers. For the
rest, there are verses which I cannot take so seriously as to alter
them. The man who wrote them was honest; and he had the same basic
views as myself. Besides, nobody need read the book: I certainly
beg to be excused.</p>

<pre>
<i>Another tattered rhymster in the ring,
  With but the old plea to the sneering schools,
That on him too, some secret night in spring
  Came the old frenzy of a hundred fools

To make some thing: the old want dark and deep,
  The thirst of men, the hunger of the stars,
Since first it tinged even the Eternal's sleep,
  With monstrous dreams of trees and towns and mars.

When all He made for the first time He saw,
  Scattering stars as misers shake their pelf.
Then in the last strange wrath broke His own law,
  And made a graven image of Himself.</i>
</pre>

<br>

<h3><a id="p1" name="p1">BY THE BABE UNBORN</a>
</h3>

<pre>
If trees were tall and grasses short,
  As in some crazy tale,
If here and there a sea were blue
  Beyond the breaking pale,

If a fixed fire hung in the air
  To warm me one day through,
If deep green hair grew on great hills,
  I know what I should do.

In dark I lie: dreaming that there
  Are great eyes cold or kind,
And twisted streets and silent doors,
  And living men behind.

Let storm-clouds come: better an hour,
  And leave to weep and fight,
Than all the ages I have ruled
  The empires of the night.

I think that if they gave me leave
  Within that world to stand,
I would be good through all the day
  I spent in fairyland.

They should not hear a word from me
  Of selfishness or scorn,
If only I could find the door,
  If only I were born.
</pre>

<hr>
<br>

<h3><a id="p2" name="p2">THE WORLD'S LOVER</a>
</h3>

<pre>
My eyes are full of lonely mirth:
  Reeling with want and worn with scars,
For pride of every stone on earth,
  I shake my spear at all the stars.

A live bat beats my crest above,
  Lean foxes nose where I have trod,
And on my naked face the love
  Which is the loneliness of God.

Outlawed: since that great day gone by&mdash;
  When before prince and pope and queen
I stood and spoke a blasphemy&mdash;
  'Behold the summer leaves are green.'

They cursed me: what was that to me
  Who in that summer darkness furled,
With but an owl and snail to see,
  Had blessed and conquered all the world?

They bound me to the scourging-stake,
  They laid their whips of thorn on me;
I wept to see the green rods break,
  Though blood be beautiful to see.

Beneath the gallows' foot abhorred
  The crowds cry 'Crucify!' and 'Kill!'
Higher the priests sing, 'Praise the Lord,
  The warlock dies'; and higher still

Shall heaven and earth hear one cry sent
  Even from the hideous gibbet height,
'Praise to the Lord Omnipotent,
  The vultures have a feast to-night.'
</pre>

<hr>
<br>

<h3><a id="p3" name="p3">THE SKELETON</a>
</h3>

<pre>
Chattering finch and water-fly
Are not merrier than I;
Here among the flowers I lie
Laughing everlastingly.
No: I may not tell the best;
Surely, friends, I might have guessed
Death was but the good King's jest,
  It was hid so carefully.
</pre>

<hr>
<br>

<h3><a id="p4" name="p4">A CHORD OF COLOUR</a>
</h3>

<pre>
My Lady clad herself in grey,
  That caught and clung about her throat;
Then all the long grey winter day
  On me a living splendour smote;
And why grey palmers holy are,
  And why grey minsters great in story,
And grey skies ring the morning star,
  And grey hairs are a crown of glory.

My Lady clad herself in green,
  Like meadows where the wind-waves pass;
Then round my spirit spread, I ween,
  A splendour of forgotten grass.
Then all that dropped of stem or sod,
  Hoarded as emeralds might be,
I bowed to every bush, and trod
  Amid the live grass fearfully.

My Lady clad herself in blue,
  Then on me, like the seer long gone,
The likeness of a sapphire grew,
  The throne of him that sat thereon.
Then knew I why the Fashioner
  Splashed reckless blue on sky and sea;
And ere 'twas good enough for her,
  He tried it on Eternity.

Beneath the gnarled old Knowledge-tree
  Sat, like an owl, the evil sage:
'The World's a bubble,' solemnly
  He read, and turned a second page.
'A bubble, then, old crow,' I cried,
  'God keep you in your weary wit!
'A bubble&mdash;have you ever spied
  'The colours I have seen on it?'
</pre>

<hr>
<br>

<h3><a id="p5" name="p5">THE HAPPY MAN</a>
</h3>

<pre>
To teach the grey earth like a child,
  To bid the heavens repent,
I only ask from Fate the gift
  Of one man well content.

Him will I find: though when in vain
  I search the feast and mart,
The fading flowers of liberty,
  The painted masks of art.

I only find him at the last,
  On one old hill where nod
Golgotha's ghastly trinity&mdash;
  Three persons and one god.
</pre>

<hr>
<br>

<h3><a id="p6" name="p6">THE UNPARDONABLE SIN</a>
</h3>

<pre>
I do not cry, beloved, neither curse.
  Silence and strength, these two at least are good.
  He gave me sun and stars and ought He could,
But not a woman's love; for that is hers.

He sealed her heart from sage and questioner&mdash;
  Yea, with seven seals, as he has sealed the grave.
  And if she give it to a drunken slave,
The Day of Judgment shall not challenge her.

Only this much: if one, deserving well,
  Touching your thin young hands and making suit,
  Feel not himself a crawling thing, a brute,
Buried and bricked in a forgotten hell;

Prophet and poet be he over sod,
  Prince among angels in the highest place,
  God help me, I will smite him on the face,
Before the glory of the face of God.
</pre>

<hr>
<br>

<h3><a id="p7" name="p7">A NOVELTY</a>
</h3>

<pre>
Why should I care for the Ages
  Because they are old and grey?
To me, like sudden laughter,
  The stars are fresh and gay;
The world is a daring fancy,
  And finished yesterday.

Why should I bow to the Ages
  Because they were drear and dry?
Slow trees and ripening meadows
  For me go roaring by,
A living charge, a struggle
  To escalade the sky.

The eternal suns and systems,
  Solid and silent all,
To me are stars of an instant,
  Only the fires that fall
From God's good rocket, rising
  On this night of carnival.
</pre>

<hr>
<br>

<h3><a id="p8" name="p8">ULTIMATE</a>
</h3>

<pre>
The vision of a haloed host
  That weep around an empty throne;
And, aureoles dark and angels dead,
  Man with his own life stands alone.

'I am,' he says his bankrupt creed:
  'I am,' and is again a clod:
The sparrow starts, the grasses stir,
  For he has said the name of God.
</pre>

<hr>
<br>

<h3><a id="p9" name="p9">THE DONKEY</a>
</h3>

<pre>
When fishes flew and forests walked
  And figs grew upon thorn,
Some moment when the moon was blood
  Then surely I was born;

With monstrous head and sickening cry
  And ears like errant wings,
The devil's walking parody
  On all four-footed things.

The tattered outlaw of the earth,
  Of ancient crooked will;
Starve, scourge, deride me: I am dumb,
  I keep my secret still.

Fools! For I also had my hour;
  One far fierce hour and sweet:
There was a shout about my ears,
  And palms before my feet.
</pre>

<hr>
<br>

<h3><a id="p10" name="p10">THE BEATIFIC VISION</a>
</h3>

<pre>
Through what fierce incarnations, furled
  In fire and darkness, did I go,
Ere I was worthy in the world
  To see a dandelion grow?

Well, if in any woes or wars
  I bought my naked right to be,
Grew worthy of the grass, nor gave
  The wren, my brother, shame for me.

But what shall God not ask of him
  In the last time when all is told,
Who saw her stand beside the hearth,
  The firelight garbing her in gold?
</pre>

<hr>
<br>

<h3><a id="p11" name="p11">THE HOPE OF THE STREETS</a>
</h3>

<pre>
The still sweet meadows shimmered: and I stood
  And cursed them, bloom of hedge and bird of tree,
And bright and high beyond the hunch-backed wood
  The thunder and the splendour of the sea.

Give back the Babylon where I was born,
  The lips that gape give back, the hands that grope,
And noise and blood and suffocating scorn
  An eddy of fierce faces&mdash;and a hope

That 'mid those myriad heads one head find place,
  With brown hair curled like breakers of the sea,
And two eyes set so strangely in the face
  That all things else are nothing suddenly.
</pre>

<hr>
<br>

<h3><a id="p12" name="p12">ECCLESIASTES</a>
</h3>

<pre>
There is one sin: to call a green leaf grey,
  Whereat the sun in heaven shuddereth.
There is one blasphemy: for death to pray,
  For God alone knoweth the praise of death.

There is one creed: 'neath no world-terror's wing
  Apples forget to grow on apple-trees.
There is one thing is needful&mdash;everything&mdash;
  The rest is vanity of vanities.
</pre>

<hr>
<br>

<h3><a id="p13" name="p13">THE SONG OF THE CHILDREN</a>
</h3>

<pre>
The World is ours till sunset,
  Holly and fire and snow;
And the name of our dead brother
  Who loved us long ago.

The grown folk mighty and cunning,
  They write his name in gold;
But we can tell a little
  Of the million tales he told.

He taught them laws and watchwords,
  To preach and struggle and pray;
But he taught us deep in the hayfield
  The games that the angels play.

Had he stayed here for ever,
  Their world would be wise as ours&mdash;
And the king be cutting capers,
  And the priest be picking flowers.

But the dark day came: they gathered:
  On their faces we could see
They had taken and slain our brother,
  And hanged him on a tree.
</pre>

<hr>
<br>

<h3><a id="p14" name="p14">THE FISH</a>
</h3>

<pre>
Dark the sea was: but I saw him,
  One great head with goggle eyes,
Like a diabolic cherub
  Flying in those fallen skies.

I have heard the hoarse deniers,
  I have known the wordy wars;
I have seen a man, by shouting,
  Seek to orphan all the stars.

I have seen a fool half-fashioned
  Borrow from the heavens a tongue,
So to curse them more at leisure&mdash;
  &mdash;And I trod him not as dung.

For I saw that finny goblin
  Hidden in the abyss untrod;
And I knew there can be laughter
  On the secret face of God.

Blow the trumpets, crown the sages,
  Bring the age by reason fed!
(He that sitteth in the heavens,
  'He shall laugh'&mdash;the prophet said.)
</pre>

<hr>
<br>

<h3><a id="p15" name="p15">GOLD LEAVES</a>
</h3>

<pre>
Lo! I am come to autumn,
  When all the leaves are gold;
Grey hairs and golden leaves cry out
  The year and I are old.

In youth I sought the prince of men,
  Captain in cosmic wars,
Our Titan, even the weeds would show
  Defiant, to the stars.

But now a great thing in the street
  Seems any human nod,
Where shift in strange democracy
  The million masks of God.

In youth I sought the golden flower
  Hidden in wood or wold,
But I am come to autumn,
  When all the leaves are gold.
</pre>

<hr>
<br>

<h3><a id="p16" name="p16">THOU SHALT NOT KILL</a>
</h3>

<pre>
I had grown weary of him; of his breath
And hands and features I was sick to death.
Each day I heard the same dull voice and tread;
I did not hate him: but I wished him dead.
And he must with his blank face fill my life&mdash;
Then my brain blackened; and I snatched a knife.

But ere I struck, my soul's grey deserts through
A voice cried, 'Know at least what thing you do.'
'This is a common man: knowest thou, O soul,
What this thing is? somewhere where seasons roll
There is some living thing for whom this man
Is as seven heavens girt into a span,
For some one soul you take the world away&mdash;
Now know you well your deed and purpose. Slay!'

Then I cast down the knife upon the ground
And saw that mean man for one moment crowned.
I turned and laughed: for there was no one by&mdash;
The man that I had sought to slay was I.
</pre>

<hr>
<br>

<h3><a id="p17" name="p17">A CERTAIN EVENING</a>
</h3>

<pre>
That night the whole world mingled,
  The souls were babes at play,
And angel danced with devil.
  And God cried, 'Holiday!'

The sea had climbed the mountain peaks,
  And shouted to the stars
To come to play: and down they came
  Splashing in happy wars.

The pine grew apples for a whim,
  The cart-horse built a nest;
The oxen flew, the flowers sang,
  The sun rose in the west.

And 'neath the load of many worlds,
  The lowest life God made
Lifted his huge and heavy limbs
  And into heaven strayed.

To where the highest life God made
  Before His presence stands;
But God himself cried, 'Holiday!'
  And she gave me both her hands.
</pre>

<hr>
<br>

<h3><a id="p18" name="p18">A MAN AND HIS IMAGE</a>
</h3>

<pre>
All day the nations climb and crawl and pray
  In one long pilgrimage to one white shrine,
Where sleeps a saint whose pardon, like his peace,
  Is wide as death, as common, as divine.

His statue in an aureole fills the shrine,
  The reckless nightingale, the roaming fawn,
Share the broad blessing of his lifted hands,
  Under the canopy, above the lawn.

But one strange night, a night of gale and flood,
  A sound came louder than the wild wind's tone;
The grave-gates shook and opened: and one stood
  Blue in the moonlight, rotten to the bone.

Then on the statue, graven with holy smiles,
  There came another smile&mdash;tremendous&mdash;one
Of an Egyptian god. 'Why should you rise?
  'Do I not guard your secret from the sun?

The nations come; they kneel among the flowers
  Sprung from your blood, blossoms of May and June,
Which do not poison them&mdash;is it not strange?
  Speak!' And the dead man shuddered in the moon.

Shall I not cry the truth?'&mdash;the dead man cowered&mdash;
  Is it not sad, with life so tame and cold,
What earth should fade into the sun's white fires
  With the best jest in all its tales untold?

'If I should cry that in this shrine lie hid
  Stories that Satan from his mouth would spew;
Wild tales that men in hell tell hoarsely&mdash;speak!
  Saint and Deliverer!  Should I slander you?'

Slowly the cowering corse reared up its head,
  'Nay, I am vile ... but when for all to see,
You stand there, pure and painless&mdash;death of life!
  Let the stars fall&mdash;I say you slander me!

'You make me perfect, public, colourless;
  You make my virtues sit at ease&mdash;you lie!
For mine were never easy&mdash;lost or saved,
  I had a soul&mdash;I was. And where am I?

Where is my good? the little real hoard,
  The secret tears, the sudden chivalries;
The tragic love, the futile triumph&mdash;where?
  Thief, dog, and son of devils&mdash;where are these?

I will lift up my head: in leprous loves
  Lost, and the soul's dishonourable scars&mdash;
By God I was a better man than This
  That stands and slanders me to all the stars.

'Come down!' And with an awful cry, the corse
  Sprang on the sacred tomb of many tales,
And stone and bone, locked in a loathsome strife,
  Swayed to the singing of the nightingales.

Then one was thrown: and where the statue stood
  Under the canopy, above the lawn,
The corse stood; grey and lean, with lifted hands
  Raised in tremendous welcome to the dawn.

'Now let all nations climb and crawl and pray;
  Though I be basest of my old red clan,
They shall not scale, with cries or sacrifice,
  The stature of the spirit of a man.'

  Like dreams of angels bright;
The hawthorn smells of passion
  Told in a moonless night.

But the smell is in my nostrils,
  Through blossoms red or gold,
Of my own green flower unfading,
  A bitter smell and bold.

The lily smells of pardon,
  The rose of mirth; but mine
Smells shrewd of death and honour,
  And the doom of Adam's line.

The heavy scent of wine-shops
  Floats as I pass them by,
But never a cup I quaff from,
  And never a house have I.

Till dropped down forty fathoms,

Like sleeping dragon's sudden eyes
  The signals leered along the line.

The chimneys thronging crooked or straight
  Were fingers signalling the sky;
The dog that strayed across the street
  Seemed four-legged by monstrosity.

'In vain,' I cried, 'though you too touch

  Cometh; the flag is furled.'

Black death shall have his toll of kings
  Before that cross goes down.

Once more shall move with mighty things
  His house of ancient tale,
Where kings whose hands were kissed of kings
  Went in: and came out pale.

O young ones of a darker day,
  In art's wan colours clad,
Whose very love and hate are grey&mdash;
  Whose very sin is sad.

Pass on: one agony long-drawn

Of some world-poison maddening bush and tree.

  With bloody secrets veiled before me stand.
  Last night I held all evil in my hand
Closed: and behold it was a little thing.

I broke the infernal gates and looked on him
  Who fronts the strong creation with a curse;
  Even the god of a lost universe,
Smiling above his hideous cherubim.

And pierced far down in his soul's crypt unriven
  The last black crooked sympathy and shame,
  And hailed him with that ringing rainbow name
Erased upon the oldest book in heaven.

Like emptied idiot masks, sin's loves and wars

Laughing with laughter such as shakes the stars.

I dreamed a dream of heaven, white as frost,
The splendid stillness of a living host;
Vast choirs of upturned faces, line o'er line.
Then my blood froze; for every face was mine.

Spirits with sunset plumage throng and pass,
Glassed darkly in the sea of gold and glass.
But still on every side, in every spot,
I saw a million selves, who saw me not.

I fled to quiet wastes, where on a stone,
Perchance, I found a saint, who sat alone;
I came behind: he turned with slow, sweet grace,
And faced me with my happy, hateful face.

I cowered like one that in a tower doth bide,
Shut in by mirrors upon every side;
Then I saw, islanded in skies alone
And silent, one that sat upon a throne.

His robe was bordered with rich rose and gold,
Green, purple, silver out of sunsets old;
But o'er his face a great cloud edged with fire,
Because it covereth the world's desire.

But as I gazed, a silent worshipper,
Methought the cloud began to faintly stir;
Then I fell flat, and screamed with grovelling head,
'If thou hast any lightning, strike me dead!

'But spare a brow where the clean sunlight fell,
The crown of a new sin that sickens hell.
Let me not look aloft and see mine own
Feature and form upon the Judgment-throne.'

Then my dream snapped: and with a heart that leapt
I saw across the tavern where I slept,
The sight of all my life most full of grace,
A gin-damned drunkard's wan half-witted face.

In change, eclipse, and peril,
  Under the whole world's scorn,

With monstrous wings that would have flown;

Holding them back from heavenly wars,
Though every flower sprang at the stars.

But he broke free: while all things ceased,
Some hour increasing, he increased.
The town beneath him seemed a map,
Above the church he cocked his cap,
Above the cross his feather flew
Above the birds and still he grew.

The trees turned grass; the clouds were riven;
His feet were mountains lost in heaven;
Through strange new skies he rose alone,
The earth fell from him like a stone,
And his own limbs beneath him far
Seemed tapering down to touch a star.

He reared his head, shaggy and grim,
Staring among the cherubim;
The seven celestial floors he rent,
One crystal dome still o'er him bent:

I come to sell the stars&mdash;old lamps for new&mdash;
        Old stars for sale.'

Then a calm voice fell all the thunder through,
        A tone less rough:
'Thou hast begun to love one of my works
        Almost enough.'

We will not let thee be, for thou art ours.
  We thank thee still, though thou forget these things,
For that hour's sake when thou didst wake all powers
  With a great cry that God was sick of kings.

Leave thee there grovelling at their rusted greaves,
  These hulking cowards on a painted stage,
Who, with imperial pomp and laurel leaves,
  Show their Marengo&mdash;one man in a cage.

These, for whom stands no type or title given
  In all the squalid tales of gore and pelf;
Though cowed by crashing thunders from all heaven.
  Cain never said, 'My brother slew himself.'

Tear you the truth out of your drivelling spy,
  The maniac whom you set to swing death's scythe.
Nay; torture not the torturer&mdash;let him lie:
  What need of racks to teach a worm to writhe?

Bear with us, O our sister, not in pride,
  Nor any scorn we see thee spoiled of knaves,
But only shame to hear, where Danton died,
  Thy foul dead kings all laughing in their graves.

Thou hast a right to rule thyself; to be
  The thing thou wilt; to grin, to fawn, to creep:
To crown these clumsy liars; ay, and we
  Who knew thee once, we have a right to weep.

'Come down out of your dusty shrine
  The living dust to see,
The flowers that at your sermon's end
  Stand blazing silently.

'Rich white and blood-red blossom; stones,
  Lichens like fire encrust;
A gleam of blue, a glare of gold,

'Pass them all by: till, as you come

Under a tree&mdash;I know it well&mdash;

'The sunshine falls on one brown head.
  You, too, O cold of clay,

To make a fairer face than heaven,

<h3><a id="p49" name="p49">THE BALLAD OF THE BATTLE OF GIBEON</a>
</h3>

<pre>
Five kings rule o'er the Amorite,
Mighty as fear and old as night;
Swathed with unguent and gold and jewel,
Waxed they merry and fat and cruel.
Zedek of Salem, a terror and glory,
Whose face was hid while his robes were gory;
And Hoham of Hebron, whose loathly face is
Heavy and dark o'er the ruin of races;
And Piram of Jarmuth, drunk with strange wine,
Who dreamed he had fashioned all stars that shine;
And Debir of Eglon wild, without pity,
Who raged like a plague in the midst of his city;
And Japhia of Lachish, a fire that flameth,
Who did in the daylight what no man nameth.

These five kings said one to another,
'King unto king o'er the world is brother,
Seeing that now, for a sign and a wonder,
A red eclipse and a tongue of thunder,
A shape and a finger of desolation,
Is come against us a kingless nation.
Gibeon hath failed us: it were not good
That a man remember where Gibeon stood.'
Then Gibeon sent to our captain, crying,
'Son of Nun, let a shaft be flying,
For unclean birds are gathering greedily;
Slack not thy hand, but come thou speedily.
Yea, we are lost save thou maintain'st us,
For the kings of the mountains are gathered against us.'

Then to our people spake the Deliverer,
'Gibeon is high, yet a host may shiver her;
Gibeon hath sent to me crying for pity,
For the lords of the cities encompass the city
With chariot and banner and bowman and lancer,
And I swear by the living God I will answer.
Gird you, O Israel, quiver and javelin,
Shield and sword for the road we travel in;
Verily, as I have promised, pay I
Life unto Gibeon, death unto Ai.'

Sudden and still as a bolt shot right
Up on the city we went by night.
Never a bird of the air could say,
'This was the children of Israel's way.'

Only the hosts sprang up from sleeping,
Saw from the heights a dark stream sweeping;
Sprang up straight as a great shout stung them,
And heard the Deliverer's war-cry among them,
Heard under cupola, turret, and steeple
The awful cry of the kingless people.

Started the weak of them, shouted the strong of them,
Crashed we a thunderbolt into the throng of them,
Blindly with heads bent, and shields forced before us,
We heard the dense roar of the strife closing o'er us.
And drunk with the crash of the song that it sung them,
We drove the great spear-blade in God's name among them.

Redder and redder the sword-flash fell.
Our eyes and our nostrils were hotter than hell;
Till full all the crest of the spear-surge shocking us,
Hoham of Hebron cried out mocking us,
'Nay, what need of the war-sword's plying,
Out of the desert the dust comes flying.
A little red dust, if the wind be blowing&mdash;
Who shall reck of its coming or going?'
Back the Deliverer spake as a clarion,
'Mock at thy slaves, thou eater of carrion!
Laughest thou at us, in thy kingly clowning,
We, that laughed upon Ramases frowning.
We that stood up proud, unpardoned,
When his face was dark and his heart was hardened?
Pharaoh we knew and his steeds, not faster
Than the word of the Lord in thine ear, O master.

Sheer through the turban his wantons wove him,
Clean to the skull the Deliverer clove him;
And the two hosts reeled at the sign appalling,
As the great king fell like a great house falling.

Loudly we shouted, and living and dying.
Bore them all backward with strength and strong crying;
And Caleb struck Zedek hard at the throat,
And Japhia of Lachish Zebulon smote.
The war-swords and axes were clashing and groaning,
The fallen were fighting and foaming and moaning;
The war-spears were breaking, the war-horns were braying,
Ere the hands of the slayers were sated with slaying.
And deep in the grasses grown gory and sodden,
The treaders of all men were trampled and trodden;
And over them, routed and reeled like cattle,
High over the turn of the tide of the battle,
High over noises that deafen and cover us,
Rang the Deliverer's voice out over us.

'Stand thou still, thou sun upon Gibeon,
Stand thou, moon, in the valley of Ajalon!
Shout thou, people, a cry like thunder,
For the kings of the earth are broken asunder.
Now we have said as the thunder says it,
Something is stronger than strength and slays it.
Now we have written for all time later,
Five kings are great, yet a law is greater.
Stare, O sun! in thine own great glory,
This is the turn of the whole world's story.
Stand thou still, thou sun upon Gibeon,
Stand thou, moon, in the valley of Ajalon!

'Smite! amid spear-blades blazing and breaking.
More than we know of is rising and making.
Stab with the javelin, crash with the car!
Cry! for we know not the thing that we are.
Stand, O sun! that in horrible patience
Smiled on the smoke and the slaughter of nations.
Thou shalt grow sad for a little crying,
Thou shalt be darkened for one man's dying&mdash;
Stand thou still, thou sun upon Gibeon,
Stand thou, moon, in the valley of Ajalon!'

After the battle was broken and spent
Up to the hill the Deliverer went,
Flung up his arms to the storm-clouds flying,
And cried unto Israel, mightily crying,
'Come up, O warriors! come up, O brothers!
Tribesmen and herdsmen, maidens and mothers;
The bondman's son and the bondman's daughter,
The hewer of wood and the drawer of water,
He that carries and he that brings,
And set your foot on the neck of kings.'

This is the story of Gibeon fight&mdash;
Where we smote the lords of the Amorite;
Where the banners of princes with slaughter were sodden.
And the beards of seers in the rank grass trodden;
Where the trees were wrecked by the wreck of cars,
And the reek of the red field blotted the stars;
Where the dead heads dropped from the swords that sever,
Because His mercy endureth for ever.

In brown outlandish arms to ride,
  And shout my love to every star
With lungs to make a poor maid's name

Here, where these subtle cowards crowd,
  To stand and so to speak of love,
That the four corners of the world
  Should hear it and take heed thereof.

That to this shrine obscure there be
  One witness before all men given,
As naked as the hanging Christ,
  As shameless as the sun in heaven.

  One dripping woe, one reeking sin?
These thieves that shatter their own graves
  To prove the soul is dead within.

And told the good all men have known

<h3><a id="p51" name="p51">THE BALLAD OF GOD-MAKERS</a>
</h3>

<pre>
A bird flew out at the break of day
  From the nest where it had curled,
And ere the eve the bird had set
  Fear on the kings of the world.

The first tree it lit upon
  Was green with leaves unshed;
The second tree it lit upon
  Was red with apples red;

The third tree it lit upon
  Was barren and was brown,
Save for a dead man nailed thereon
  On a hill above a town.

That right the kings of the earth were gay
  And filled the cup and can;
Last night the kings of the earth were chill
  For dread of a naked man.

'If he speak two more words,' they said,
  'The slave is more than the free;
If he speak three more words,' they said,
  'The stars are under the sea.'

Said the King of the East to the King of the West,
  I wot his frown was set,
'Lo; let us slay him and make him as dung,
  It is well that the world forget.'

Said the King of the West to the King of the East,
  I wot his smile was dread,
'Nay, let us slay him and make him a god,
  It is well that our god be dead.'

They set the young man on a hill,
  They nailed him to a rod;
And there in darkness and in blood
  They made themselves a god.

And the mightiest word was left unsaid,
  And the world had never a mark,
And the strongest man of the sons of men
  Went dumb into the dark.

Then hymns and harps of praise they brought,
  Incense and gold and myrrh,
And they thronged above the seraphim,
  The poor dead carpenter.

'Thou art the prince of all,' they sang,
  'Ocean and earth and air.'
Then the bird flew on to the cruel cross,
  And hid in the dead man's hair.

'Thou art the sun of the world,' they cried,
  'Speak if our prayers be heard.'
And the brown bird stirred in the dead man's hair,
  And it seemed that the dead man stirred.

Then a shriek went up like the world's last cry
  From all nations under heaven,
And a master fell before a slave
  And begged to be forgiven.

They cowered, for dread in his wakened eyes
  The ancient wrath to see;
And the bird flew out of the dead Christ's hair,
  And lit on a lemon-tree.

  On the day when the stars shall fall.

I grasped the axe with shaking hands,
  I stared at the grass I trod;
For I feared to see the whole bare heavens
  Filled with the face of God.

I struck: the serpentine slow blood
  In four arms soaked the moss&mdash;
Before me, by the living Christ,
  The blood ran in a cross.

Therefore I toil in forests here
  And pile the wood in stacks,
And take no fee from the shivering folk

<pre>
The wasting thistle whitens on my crest,
The barren grasses blow upon my spear,
A green, pale pennon: blazon of wild faith
And love of fruitless things: yea, of my love,
Among the golden loves of all the knights,
Alone: most hopeless, sweet, and blasphemous,
The love of God:
        I hear the crumbling creeds
Like cliffs washed down by water, change, and pass;
I hear a noise of words, age after age,
A new cold wind that blows across the plains,
And all the shrines stand empty; and to me
All these are nothing: priests and schools may doubt
Who never have believed; but I have loved.
Ah friends, I know it passing well, the love
Wherewith I love; it shall not bring to me
Return or hire or any pleasant thing&mdash;
Ay, I have tried it: Ay, I know its roots.
Earthquake and plague have burst on it in vain
And rolled back shattered&mdash;
        Babbling neophytes!
Blind, startled fools&mdash;think you I know it not?
Think you to teach me?  Know I not His ways?
Strange-visaged blunders, mystic cruelties.
All! all! I know Him, for I love Him. Go!

So, with the wan waste grasses on my spear,
I ride for ever, seeking after God.
My hair grows whiter than my thistle plume,
And all my limbs are loose; but in my eyes
The star of an unconquerable praise:
For in my soul one hope for ever sings,
That at the next white corner of a road
My eyes may look on Him....
        Hush&mdash;I shall know
The place when it is found: a twisted path
Under a twisted pear-tree&mdash;this I saw
In the first dream I had ere I was born,
Wherein He spoke....
        But the grey clouds come down
In hail upon the icy plains: I ride,
Burning for ever in consuming fire.

Astride of it sits CAPTAIN REDFEATHER, a flagon in his hand</i>.

REDFEATHER.

I have drunk to all I know of,
To every leaf on the tree,
To the highest bird of the heavens,
To the lowest fish of the sea.
What toast, what toast remaineth,
Drunk down in the same good wine,
By the tippler's cup in the tavern,
And the priest's cup at the shrine?

He has vanished

To the stars.

[<i>The Priest looks up.</i>]

PRIEST [<i>angrily</i>].

What would you there, sir?

REDFEATHER.

Give you all a toast.

[<i>Lifts his flagon. More priests come out.</i>]

I see my life behind me: bad enough&mdash;
Drink, duels, madness, beggary, and pride,
The life of the unfit: yet ere I drop
On Nature's rubbish heap, I weigh it all,
And give you all a toast&mdash;

[<i>Reels to his feet and stands.</i>]

The health of God!

[<i>They all recoil from him.</i>]

Let's give the Devil of the Heavens His due!
He that made grass so green, and wine so red,
Is not so black as you have painted him.

PRIEST.

Blaspheming profligate!

REDFEATHER [<i>hurls the flagon among them.</i>]

          Howl! ye dumb dogs,

Flutter the seraphim like startled birds;
Make God recall the good days of His youth
Ere saints had saddened Him: when He came back
Conqueror of Chaos in a six days' war,
With all the sons of God shouting for joy ...

PRIEST.

And you&mdash;what is your right, and who are you,
To praise God?

REDFEATHER.

        A lost soul. In earth or heaven
What has a better right?

Drink, dice, and dance: take no more thought than blind
Beasts of the field....

Satan may worry women if he will,
For he was but an angel ere he fell,
But I&mdash;before I fell&mdash;I was a man.

OLIVE.

He too, my Master, was a man: too strong
To fear a strong man's sins: 'tis written He
Descended into hell.

Descended into heaven....

A sight not wholesome to the eyes of man.

OLIVE.

Captain, I tell you God once fell asleep.
And in that hour the world went as it would;
Dogs brought forth cats, and poison grew in grapes,
And Orm was born....

Be kicked or paid?

God grows impatient, and His wine is poured,

Yes&mdash;you are right&mdash;God is within that house.

REDFEATHER.

Olive!

OLIVE.

    But He is all too beautiful
For us who only know of stars and flowers.
The thing within is all too pure and fair,

[<i>Shudders.</i>]

Too awful in its ancient innocence,
For men to look upon it and not die;
Ourselves would fade into those still white fires
Of peace and mercy.

[<i>Struggles with her voice.</i>]

There ... enough ... the law&mdash;
No flesh shall look upon the Lord and live.

REDFEATHER [<i>sticking his sword in the ground</i>].

You are the bravest lady in the world.

May I not go within?

REDFEATHER.

Keep you the law&mdash;
No flesh shall look upon the Lord and live.

Then I will go and lay me in the flowers,
For He may haply, as in ancient time,
Walk in the garden in the cool of day.

[<i>He goes out.</i>]

[OLIVE <i>reels.</i> REDFEATHER <i>catches her.</i>]

You are the strongest woman upon earth.
The weakest woman than the strongest man
Is stronger in her hour: this is the law.
When the hour passes&mdash;then may we be strong.

OLIVE [<i>wildly.</i>]

The House ... the Face.

REDFEATHER [<i>fiercely</i>].

I love you. Look at me!

OLIVE [<i>turns her face to him.</i>]

I hear six birds sing in that little tree,
Say, is the old earth laughing at my fears?
I think I love you also....

REDFEATHER.

        What I am
You know. But I will never curse a man,
Even in a mirror.

OLIVE [<i>smiling at him</i>].

And the Devil's dance?

REDFEATHER.

The Devil plotted since the world was young
With alchemies of fire and witches' oils
And magic. But he never made a man.

OLIVE.

No; not a man.

REDFEATHER.

        Not even my Lord Orm.
Look at the house now&mdash;

[<i>She starts and looks.</i>]

Honest brick and tiles.

OLIVE.

You have a strange strength in this hour.

REDFEATHER.

        This hour
I see with mortal eye as in one flash
The whole divine democracy of things,
And dare the stars to scorn a scavenge-heap.
Olive, I tell you every soul is great.
Weave we green crowns&mdash;how noble and how high;
Fling we white flowers&mdash;how radiant and how pure

I have seen men grow mangier than the beasts,
Eat bread with blood upon their fingers, grin
While women burned: but one last law they served.
When I say 'Coward,' is the law awake?

LORD ORM.

Hear me, then, too: I have seen robbers rule,
And thieves go clad in gold&mdash;age after age&mdash;
Because, though sordid, ragged, rude, and mean,
They saw, like gods, no law above their heads.
But when they fell&mdash;then for this cause they fell,
This last mean cobweb of the fairy tales
Of good and ill: that they must stand and fight
When a man bade, though they had chose to stand
And fight not. I am stronger than the world.

Are you alive?

LORD ORM.

        Evil, be thou my good;
Let the sun blacken and the moon be blood:
I have said the words.

REDFEATHER [<i>studying him</i>].

        And if I struck you dead,
You would turn to daisies!

LORD ORM.

And you do not strike.

REDFEATHER [<i>dreamily</i>].

Indeed, poor soul, such magic would be kind
And full of pity as a fairy-tale:
One touch of this bright wand [<i>Lifts his sword</i>]
    and down would drop
The dark abortive blunder that is you.
And you would change, forgiven, into flowers.

LORD ORM.

And yet&mdash;and yet you do not strike me dead.
I do not draw: the sword is in your hand&mdash;
Drive the blade through me where I stand.

REDFEATHER.

            Lord Orm,
You asked the Lady Olive (I can speak
As to a toad to you, my lord)&mdash;you asked
Olive to be your paramour: and she&mdash;

LORD ORM.

Refused.

REDFEATHER.

    And yet her father was at stake,
And she is soft and kind. Now look at me,
Ragged and ruined, soaked in bestial sins:
My lord, I too have my virginity&mdash;
Turn the thing round, my lord, and topside down,
You cannot spell it. Be the fact enough,
I use no sword upon a swordless man.

LORD ORM.

For her?

REDFEATHER.

I too have my virginity.

LORD ORM.

Now look on me: I am the lord of earth,
For I have broken the last bond of man.
I stand erect, crowned with the stars&mdash;and why?
Because I stand a coward&mdash;because you
Have mercy&mdash;on a coward. Do I win?

REDFEATHER.

Though there you stand with moving mouth and eyes,
I think, my lord, you are not possible&mdash;
God keep you from my dreams.

[<i>Goes out.</i>]

LORD ORM.

            Alone and free.
Since first in flowery meads a child I ran,
My one long thirst&mdash;to be alone and free.
Free of all laws, creeds, codes, and common tests,
Shameless, anarchic, infinite.
            Why, then,
I might have done in that dark liberty&mdash;
If I should say 'a good deed,' men would laugh,
But here are none to laugh.
            The godless world
Be thanked there is no God to spy on me,
Catch me and crown me with a vulgar crown
For what I do: if I should once believe
The horror of that ancient Eavesdropper
Behind the starry arras of the skies,
I should&mdash;well, well, enough of menaces&mdash;
should not do the thing I come to do.
What do I come to do? Let me but try
To spell it to my soul.
            Suppose a man
Perfectly free and utterly alone,
Free of all love of law, equally free
Of all the love of mutiny it breeds,
Free of the love of heaven, and also free
Of all the love of hell it drives us to;
Not merely void of rules, unconscious of them;
So strong that naught alive could do him hurt,
So wise that he knew all things, and so great
That none knew what he was or what he did&mdash;
A lawless giant.

[<i>A pause: then in a low voice.</i>]

        Would he not be good?
Hate is the weakness of a thwarted thing,
Pride is the weakness of a thing unpraised.
But he, this man....
He would be like a child
Girt with the tomes of some vast library,
Who reads romance after romance, and smiles
When every tale ends well: impersonal
As God he grows&mdash;melted in suns and stars;
So would this boundless man, whom none could spy,
Taunt him with virtue, censure him with vice,
Rejoice in all men's joys; with golden pen
Write all the live romances of the earth
To a triumphant close....
            Alone and free&mdash;
In this grey, cool, clean garden, washed with winds,
What do I come to do among the grass,
The daisies, and the dews? An awful thing,
To prove I am that man.
            That while these saints
Taunt me with trembling, dare me to revenge,
I breathe an upper air of ancient good
And strong eternal laughter; send my sun
And rain upon the evil and the just,
Turn my left cheek unto the smiter. He
That told me, sword in hand, that I had fallen
Lower than anger, knew not I had risen
Higher than pride....
            Enough, the deeds are mine.

[<i>Takes out the title-deeds.</i>]

I come to write the end of a romance.
A good romance: the characters&mdash;Lord Orm.
Type of the starvd heart and stord brain,
Who strives to hate and cannot; fronting him&mdash;
Redfeather, rake in process of reform,
At root a poet: I have hopes of him:
He can love virtue, for he still loves vice.
He is not all burnt out. He beats me there
(How I beat him in owning it!); in love
He is still young, and has the joy of shame.
And for the Lady Olive&mdash;who shall speak?
A man may weigh the courage of a man,
But if there be a bottomless abyss
It is a woman's valour: such as I
Can only bow the knee and hide the face
(Thank God there is no God to spy on me
And bring his cursd crowns).
            No, there is none:
The old incurable hunger of the world
Surges in wolfish wars, age after age.
There was no God before me: none sees where,
Between the brute-womb and the deaf, dead grave,
Unhoping, unrecorded, unrepaid,
I make with smoke, fire, and burnt-offering
This sacrifice to Chaos. [<i>Lights the papers.</i>] None behold
Me write in fire the end of the romance.
Burn! I am God, and crown myself with stars.
Upon creation day: before was night
And chaos of a blind and cruel world.
I am the first God; I will trample hell,
Fight, conquer, make the story of the stars,
Like this poor story, end like a romance:

[<i>The paper burns.</i>]

Before was brainless night: but I am God
In this black world I rend. Let there be light!

[<i>The paper blazes up, illuminating the garden.</i>]

I, God ...

THE WILD KNIGHT [<i>rushes forward</i>].

    God's Light! God's Voice; yes, it is He
Walking in Eden in the cool of the day!

LORD ORM [<i>screams</i>].

Tricked! Caught!
Damned screeching rat in a hole!

[<i>Stabs him again and again with his sword; stamps on his face.</i>]

THE WILD KNIGHT [<i>faintly</i>].

Earth grows too beautiful around me: shapes
And colours fearfully wax fair and clear,
For I have heard, as thro' a door ajar,
Scraps of the huge soliloquy of God
That moveth as a mask the lips of man,
If man be very silent: they were right,
No flesh shall look upon the Lord and live.

[<i>Dies.</i>]

LORD ORM [<i>staggers back laughing</i>].

Saved, saved, my secret.

REDFEATHER [<i>rushing in, sword in hand</i>].

        The drawn sword at last!
Guard, son of hell!

[<i>They fight. ORM falls. OLIVE comes in.</i>]

        He too can die. Keep back!
Olive, keep back from him! I did not fear
Him living, and he fell before my sword;
But dead I fear him. All is ended now;
A man's whole life tied in a bundle there,
And no good deed. I fear him. Come away.

<h3><a id="p58" name="p58">GOOD NEWS</a>
</h3>

<pre>
Between a meadow and a cloud that sped
  In rain and twilight, in desire and fear.
  I heard a secret&mdash;hearken in your ear,
'Behold the daisy has a ring of red.'

That hour, with half of blessing, half of ban,
  A great voice went through heaven, and earth and hell,
  Crying, 'We are tricked, my great ones, is it well?
Now is the secret stolen by a man.'

Then waxed I like the wind because of this,
  And ran, like gospel and apocalypse,
  From door to door, with new anarchic lips,
Crying the very blasphemy of bliss.

In the last wreck of Nature, dark and dread,
  Shall in eclipse's hideous hieroglyph,
  One wild form reel on the last rocking cliff,
And shout, 'The daisy has a ring of red.'
