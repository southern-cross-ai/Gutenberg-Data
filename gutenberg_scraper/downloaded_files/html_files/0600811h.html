<h2><a id="phoenix1" name="phoenix1">CHAPTER 1</a>
</h2>

<p class="quote"><i>"KNOW, oh prince, that between the years when
the oceans drank Atlantis and the gleaming cities, and the years of
the rise of the Sons of Aryas, there was an Age undreamed of, when
shining kingdoms lay spread across the world like blue mantles
beneath the stars&mdash;Nemedia, Ophir, Brythunia, Hyperborea,
Zamora with its dark-haired women and towers of spider-haunted
mystery, Zingara with its chivalry, Koth that bordered on the
pastoral lands of Shem, Stygia with its shadow-guarded tombs,
Hyrkania whose riders wore steel and silk and gold. But the
proudest kingdom of the world was Aquilonia, reigning supreme in
the dreaming west. Hither came Conan, the Cimmerian, black-haired,
sullen- eyed, sword in hand, a thief, a reaver, a slayer, with
gigantic melancholies and gigantic mirth, to tread the jeweled
thrones of the Earth under his sandalled feet."</i>&mdash;The
Nemedian Chronicles</p>
<br>

<p class="first">OVER shadowy spires and gleaming towers lay the
ghostly darkness and silence that runs before dawn. Into a dim
alley, one of a veritable labyrinth of mysterious winding ways,
four masked figures came hurriedly from a door which a dusky hand
furtively opened. They spoke not but went swiftly into the gloom,
cloaks wrapped closely about them; as silently as the ghosts of
murdered men they disappeared in the darkness. Behind them a
sardonic countenance was framed in the partly opened door; a pair
of evil eyes glittered malevolently in the gloom.</p>

<p>"Go into the night, creatures of the night," a voice mocked.
"Oh, fools, your doom hounds your heels like a blind dog, and you
know it not." The speaker closed the door and bolted it, then
turned and went up the corridor, candle in hand. He was a somber
giant, whose dusky skin revealed his Stygian blood. He came into an
inner chamber, where a tall, lean man in worn velvet lounged like a
great lazy cat on a silken couch, sipping wine from a huge golden
goblet.</p>

<p>"Well, Ascalante," said the Stygian, setting down the candle,
"your dupes have slunk into the streets like rats from their
burrows. You work with strange tools."</p>

<p>"Tools?" replied Ascalante. "Why, they consider me that. For
months now, ever since the Rebel Four summoned me from the southern
desert, I have been living in the very heart of my enemies, hiding
by day in this obscure house, skulking through dark alleys and
darker corridors at night. And I have accomplished what those
rebellious nobles could not. Working through them, and through
other agents, many of whom have never seen my face, I have
honeycombed the empire with sedition and unrest. In short I,
working in the shadows, have paved the downfall of the king who
sits throned in the sun. By Mitra, I was a statesman before I was
an outlaw."</p>

<p>"And these dupes who deem themselves your masters?"</p>

<p>"They will continue to think that I serve them, until our
present task is completed. Who are they to match wits with
Ascalante? Volmana, the dwarfish count of Karaban; Gromel, the
giant commander of the Black Legion; Dion, the fat baron of
Attalus; Rinaldo, the hare-brained minstrel. I am the force which
has welded together the steel in each, and by the clay in each, I
will crush them when the time comes. But that lies in the future;
tonight the king dies."</p>

<p>"Days ago I saw the imperial squadrons ride from the city," said
the Stygian. "They rode to the frontier which the heathen Picts
assail&mdash;thanks to the strong liquor which I've smuggled over
the borders to madden them. Dion's great wealth made that possible.
And Volmana made it possible to dispose of the rest of the imperial
troops which remained in the city. Through his princely kin in
Nemedia, it was easy to persuade King Numa to request the presence
of Count Trocero of Poitain, seneschal of Aquilonia; and of course,
to do him honor, he'll be accompanied by an imperial escort, as
well as his own troops, and Prospero, King Conan's right-hand man.
That leaves only the king's personal bodyguard in the
city&mdash;beside the Black Legion. Through Gromel I've corrupted a
spendthrift officer of that guard, and bribed him to lead his men
away from the king's door at midnight.</p>

<p>"Then, with sixteen desperate rogues of mine, we enter the
palace by a secret tunnel. After the deed is done, even if the
people do not rise to welcome us, Gromel's Black Legion will be
sufficient to hold the city and the crown."</p>

<p>"And Dion thinks that crown will be given to him?"</p>

<p>"Yes. The fat fool claims it by reason of a trace of royal
blood. Conan makes a bad mistake in letting men live who still
boast descent from the old dynasty, from which he tore the crown of
Aquilonia.</p>

<p>"Volmana wishes to be reinstated in royal favor as he was under
the old regime, so that he may lift his poverty-ridden estates to
their former grandeur. Gromel hates Pallantides, commander of the
Black Dragons, and desires the command of the whole army, with all
the stubbornness of the Bossonian. Alone of us all, Rinaldo has no
personal ambition. He sees in Conan a red- handed, rough-footed
barbarian who came out of the north to plunder a civilized land. He
idealizes the king whom Conan killed to get the crown, remembering
only that he occasionally patronized the arts, and forgetting the
evils of his reign, and he is making the people forget. Already
they openly sing <i>The Lament for the King</i> in which Rinaldo
lauds the sainted villain and denounces Conan as 'that
black-hearted savage from the abyss'. Conan laughs, but the people
snarl."</p>

<p>"Why does he hate Conan?"</p>

<p>"Poets always hate those in power. To them perfection is always
just behind the last corner, or beyond the next. They escape the
present in dreams of the past and future. Rinaldo is a flaming
torch of idealism, rising, as he thinks, to overthrow a tyrant and
liberate the people. As for me&mdash;well, a few months ago I had
lost all ambition but to raid the caravans for the rest of my life;
now old dreams stir. Conan will die; Dion will mount the throne.
Then he, too, will die. One by one, all who oppose me will
die&mdash;by fire, or steel, or those deadly wines you know so well
how to brew. Ascalante, king of Aquilonia! How like you the sound
of it?"</p>

<p>The Stygian shrugged his broad shoulders.</p>

<p>"There was a time," he said with unconcealed bitterness, "when
I, too, had my ambitions, beside which yours seem tawdry and
childish. To what a state I have fallen! My old-time peers and
rivals would stare indeed could they see Thoth-amon of the Ring
serving as the slave of an outlander, and an outlaw at that; and
aiding in the petty ambitions of barons and kings!"</p>

<p>"You laid your trust in magic and mummery," answered Ascalante
carelessly. "I trust my wits and my sword."</p>

<p>"Wits and swords are as straws against the wisdom of the
Darkness," growled the Stygian, his dark eyes flickering with
menacing lights and shadows. "Had I not lost the Ring, our
positions might be reversed."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," answered the outlaw impatiently, "you wear the
stripes of my whip on your back, and are likely to continue to wear
them."</p>

<p>"Be not so sure!" the fiendish hatred of the Stygian glittered
for an instant redly in his eyes. "Some day, somehow, I will find
the Ring again, and when I do, by the serpent-fangs of Set, you
shall pay&mdash;"</p>

<p>The hot-tempered Aquilonian started up and struck him heavily
across the mouth. Thoth reeled back, blood starting from his
lips.</p>

<p>"You grow over-bold, dog," growled the outlaw. "Have a care; I
am still your master who knows your dark secret. Go upon the
housetops and shout that Ascalante is in the city plotting against
the king&mdash;if you dare."</p>

<p>"I dare not," muttered the Stygian, wiping the blood from his
lips.</p>

<p>"No, you do not dare," Ascalante grinned bleakly. "For if I die
by your stealth or treachery, a hermit priest in the southern
desert will know of it, and will break the seal of a manuscript I
left in his hands. And having read, a word will be whispered in
Stygia, and a wind will creep up from the south by midnight. And
where will you hide your head, Thoth-amon?"</p>

<p>The slave shuddered and his dusky face went ashen.</p>

<p>"Enough!" Ascalante changed his tone peremptorily. "I have work
for you. I do not trust Dion. I bade him ride to his country estate
and remain there until the work tonight is done. The fat fool could
never conceal his nervousness before the king today. Ride after
him, and if you do not overtake him on the road, proceed to his
estate and remain with him until we send for him. Don't let him out
of your sight. He is mazed with fear, and might bolt&mdash;might
even rush to Conan in a panic, and reveal the whole plot, hoping
thus to save his own hide. Go!"</p>

<p>The slave bowed, hiding the hate in his eyes, and did as he was
bidden. Ascalante turned again to his wine. Over the jeweled spires
was rising a dawn crimson as blood.</p>

<h2><a id="phoenix2" name="phoenix2">CHAPTER 2</a>
</h2>

<p style="text-indent:0; margin-left:33%"><small>When I was a
fighting-man, the kettle-drums they beat;<br>
The people scattered gold-dust before my horse's feet;<br>
But now I am a great king, the people hound my track<br>
With poison in my wine-cup, and daggers at my back.<br>
&mdash;<i>The Road of Kings</i></small>
</p>
<br>

<p class="first">THE ROOM was large and ornate, with rich
tapestries on the polished panelled walls, deep rugs on the ivory
floor, and with the lofty ceiling adorned with intricate carvings
and silver scrollwork. Behind an ivory, gold- inlaid writing-table
sat a man whose broad shoulders and sun-browned skin seemed out of
place among those luxuriant surroundings. He seemed more a part of
the sun and winds and high places of the outlands. His slightest
movement spoke of steel-spring muscles knit to a keen brain with
the co-ordination of a born fighting-man. There was nothing
deliberate or measured about his actions. Either he was perfectly
at rest&mdash;still as a bronze statue&mdash;or else he was in
motion, not with the jerky quickness of over-tense nerves, but with
a cat-like speed that blurred the sight which tried to follow
him.</p>

<p>His garments were of rich fabric, but simply made. He wore no
ring or ornaments, and his square-cut black mane was confined
merely by a cloth-of- silver band about his head.</p>

<p>Now he laid down the golden stylus with which he had been
laboriously scrawling on waxed papyrus, rested his chin on his
fist, and fixed his smoldering blue eyes enviously on the man who
stood before him. This person was occupied in his own affairs at
the moment, for he was taking up the laces of his gold-chased
armor, and abstractedly whistling&mdash;a rather unconventional
performance, considering that he was in the presence of a king.</p>

<p>"Prospero," said the man at the table, "these matters of
statecraft weary me as all the fighting I have done never did."</p>

<p>"All part of the game, Conan," answered the dark-eyed
Poitainian. "You are king&mdash;you must play the part."</p>

<p>"I wish I might ride with you to Nemedia," said Conan enviously.
"It seems ages since I had a horse between my knees&mdash;but
Publius says that affairs in the city require my presence. Curse
him!</p>

<p>"When I overthrew the old dynasty," he continued, speaking with
the easy familiarity which existed only between the Poitainian and
himself, "it was easy enough, though it seemed bitter hard at the
time. Looking back now over the wild path I followed, all those
days of toil, intrigue, slaughter and tribulation seem like a
dream.</p>

<p>"I did not dream far enough, Prospero. When King Numedides lay
dead at my feet and I tore the crown from his gory head and set it
on my own, I had reached the ultimate border of my dreams. I had
prepared myself to take the crown, not to hold it. In the old free
days all I wanted was a sharp sword and a straight path to my
enemies. Now no paths are straight and my sword is useless.</p>

<p>"When I overthrew Numedides, then I was the Liberator&mdash;now
they spit at my shadow. They have put a statue of that swine in the
temple of Mitra, and people go and wail before it, hailing it as
the holy effigy of a saintly monarch who was done to death by a
red-handed barbarian. When I led her armies to victory as a
mercenary, Aquilonia overlooked the fact that I was a foreigner,
but now she can not forgive me.</p>

<p>"Now in Mitra's temple there come to burn incense to Numedides'
memory, men whom his hangmen maimed and blinded, men whose sons
died in his dungeons, whose wives and daughters were dragged into
his seraglio. The fickle fools!"</p>

<p>"Rinaldo is largely responsible," answered Prospero, drawing up
his sword- belt another notch. "He sings songs that make men mad.
Hang him in his jester's garb to the highest tower in the city. Let
him make rimes for the vultures."</p>

<p>Conan shook his lion head. "No, Prospero, he's beyond my reach.
A great poet is greater than any king. His songs are mightier than
my scepter; for he has near ripped the heart from my breast when he
chose to sing for me. I shall die and be forgotten, but Rinaldo's
songs will live for ever.</p>

<p>"No, Prospero," the king continued, a somber look of doubt
shadowing his eyes, "there is something hidden, some undercurrent
of which we are not aware. I sense it as in my youth I sensed the
tiger hidden in the tall grass. There is a nameless unrest
throughout the kingdom. I am like a hunter who crouches by his
small fire amid the forest, and hears stealthy feet padding in the
darkness, and almost sees the glimmer of burning eyes. If I could
but come to grips with something tangible, that I could cleave with
my sword! I tell you, it's not by chance that the Picts have of
late so fiercely assailed the frontiers, so that the Bossonians
have called for aid to beat them back. I should have ridden with
the troops."</p>

<p>"Publius feared a plot to trap and slay you beyond the
frontier," replied Prospero, smoothing his silken surcoat over his
shining mail, and admiring his tall lithe figure in a silver
mirror. "That's why he urged you to remain in the city. These
doubts are born of your barbarian instincts. Let the people snarl!
The mercenaries are ours, and the Black Dragons, and every rogue in
Poitain swears by you. Your only danger is assassination, and
that's impossible, with men of the imperial troops guarding you day
and night. What are you working at there?"</p>

<p>"A map," Conan answered with pride. "The maps of the court show
well the countries of south, east and west, but in the north they
are vague and faulty. I am adding the northern lands myself. Here
is Cimmeria, where I was born. And&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Asgard and Vanaheim," Prospero scanned the map. "By Mitra, I
had almost believed those countries to have been fabulous."</p>

<p>Conan grinned savagely, involuntarily touching the scars on his
dark face. "You had known otherwise, had you spent your youth on
the northern frontiers of Cimmeria! Asgard lies to the north, and
Vanaheim to the northwest of Cimmeria, and there is continual war
along the borders."</p>

<p>"What manner of men are these northern folk?" asked
Prospero.</p>

<p>"Tall and fair and blue-eyed. Their god is Ymir, the
frost-giant, and each tribe has its own king. They are wayward and
fierce. They fight all day and drink ale and roar their wild songs
all night."</p>

<p>"Then I think you are like them," laughed Prospero. "You laugh
greatly, drink deep and bellow good songs; though I never saw
another Cimmerian who drank aught but water, or who ever laughed,
or ever sang save to chant dismal dirges."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it's the land they live in," answered the king. "A
gloomier land never was&mdash;all of hills, darkly wooded, under
skies nearly always gray, with winds moaning drearily down the
valleys."</p>

<p>"Little wonder men grow moody there," quoth Prospero with a
shrug of his shoulders, thinking of the smiling sun-washed plains
and blue lazy rivers of Poitain, Aquilonia's southernmost
province.</p>

<p>"They have no hope here or hereafter," answered Conan. "Their
gods are Crom and his dark race, who rule over a sunless place of
everlasting mist, which is the world of the dead. Mitra! The ways
of the Aesir were more to my liking."</p>

<p>"Well," grinned Prospero, "the dark hills of Cimmeria are far
behind you. And now I go. I'll quaff a goblet of white Nemedian
wine for you at Numa's court."</p>

<p>"Good," grunted the king, "but kiss Numa's dancing-girls for
yourself only, lest you involve the states!"</p>

<p>His gusty laughter followed Prospero out of the chamber.</p>

<br>

<h2><a id="phoenix3" name="phoenix3">CHAPTER 3</a>
</h2>

<p style="text-indent:0; margin-left:33%"><small>Under the caverned
pyramids great Set coils asleep;<br>
Among the shadows of the tombs his dusky people creep.<br>
I speak the Word from the hidden gulfs that never knew the
sun&mdash;<br>
Send me a servant for my hate, oh scaled and shining One.</small>
</p>
<br>

<p class="first">THE SUN was setting, etching the green and hazy
blue of the forest in brief gold. The waning beams glinted on the
thick golden chain which Dion of Attalus twisted continually in his
pudgy hand as he sat in the flaming riot of blossoms and flowering
trees which was his garden. He shifted his fat body on his marble
seat and glanced furtively about, as if in quest of a lurking
enemy. He sat within a circular grove of slender trees, whose
interlapping branches cast a thick shade over him. Near at hand a
fountain tinkled silverly, and other unseen fountains in various
parts of the great garden whispered an everlasting symphony.</p>

<p>Dion was alone except for the great dusky figure which lounged
on a marble bench close at hand, watching the baron with deep
somber eyes. Dion gave little thought to Thoth-amon. He vaguely
knew that he was a slave in whom Ascalante reposed much trust, but
like so many rich men, Dion paid scant heed to men below his own
station in life.</p>

<p>"You need not be so nervous," said Thoth. "The plot can not
fail."</p>

<p>"Ascalante can make mistakes as well as another," snapped Dion,
sweating at the mere thought of failure.</p>

<p>"Not he," grinned the Stygian savagely, "else I had not been his
slave, but his master."</p>

<p>"What talk is this?" peevishly returned Dion, with only half a
mind on the conversation.</p>

<p>Thoth-amon's eyes narrowed. For all his iron self-control, he
was near bursting with long pent-up shame, hate and rage, ready to
take any sort of a desperate chance. What he did not reckon on was
the fact that Dion saw him, not as a human being with a brain and a
wit, but simply a slave, and as such, a creature beneath
notice.</p>

<p>"Listen to me," said Thoth. "You will be king. But you little
know the mind of Ascalante. You can not trust him, once Conan is
slain. I can help you. If you will protect me when you come to
power, I will aid you.</p>

<p>"Listen, my lord. I was a great sorcerer in the south. Men spoke
of Thoth-Amon as they spoke of Rammon. King Ctesphon of Stygia gave
me great honor, casting down the magicians from the high places to
exalt me above them. They hated me, but they feared me, for I
controlled beings from outside which came at my call and did my
bidding. By Set, mine enemy knew not the hour when he might awake
at midnight to feel the taloned fingers of a nameless horror at his
throat! I did dark and terrible magic with the Serpent Ring of Set,
which I found in a nighted tomb a league beneath the earth,
forgotten before the first man crawled out of the slimy sea.</p>

<p>"But a thief stole the Ring and my power was broken. The
magicians rose up to slay me, and I fled. Disguised as a
camel-driver, I was travelling in a caravan in the land of Koth,
when Ascalante's reavers fell upon us. All in the caravan were
slain except myself; I saved my life by revealing my identity to
Ascalante and swearing to serve him. Bitter has been that
bondage!</p>

<p>"To hold me fast, he wrote of me in a manuscript, and sealed it
and gave it into the hands of a hermit who dwells on the southern
borders of Koth. I dare not strike a dagger into him while he
sleeps, or betray him to his enemies, for then the hermit would
open the manuscript and read&mdash;thus Ascalante instructed him.
And he would speak a word in Stygia&mdash;"</p>

<p>Again Thoth shuddered and an ashen hue tinged his dusky
skin.</p>

<p>"Men knew me not in Aquilonia," he said. "But should my enemies
in Stygia learn my whereabouts, not the width of half a world
between us would suffice to save me from such a doom as would blast
the soul of a bronze statue. Only a king with castles and hosts of
swordsmen could protect me. So I have told you my secret, and urge
that you make a pact with me. I can aid you with my wisdom, and you
can protect me. And some day I will find the Ring&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ring? Ring?" Thoth had underestimated the man's utter egoism.
Dion had not even been listening to the slave's words, so
completely engrossed was he in his own thoughts, but the final word
stirred a ripple in his self- centeredness.</p>

<p>"Ring?" he repeated. "That makes me remember&mdash;my ring of
good fortune. I had it from a Shemitish thief who swore he stole it
from a wizard far to the south, and that it would bring me luck. I
paid him enough, Mitra knows. By the gods, I need all the luck I
can have, what with Volmana and Ascalante dragging me into their
bloody plots&mdash;I'll see to the ring."</p>

<p>Thoth sprang up, blood mounting darkly to his face, while his
eyes flamed with the stunned fury of a man who suddenly realizes
the full depths of a fool's swinish stupidity. Dion never heeded
him. Lifting a secret lid in the marble seat, he fumbled for a
moment among a heap of gewgaws of various kinds&mdash;barbaric
charms, bits of bones, pieces of tawdry jewelry&mdash;luck-pieces
and conjures which the man's superstitious nature had prompted him
to collect.</p>

<p>"Ah, here it is!" He triumphantly lifted a ring of curious make.
It was of a metal like copper, and was made in the form of a scaled
serpent, coiled in three loops, with its tail in its mouth. Its
eyes were yellow gems which glittered balefully. Thoth-amon cried
out as if he had been struck, and Dion wheeled and gaped, his face
suddenly bloodless. The slave's eyes were blazing, his mouth wide,
his huge dusky hands outstretched like talons.</p>

<p>"The Ring! By Set! The Ring!" he shrieked. "My Ring&mdash;stolen
from me&mdash;" Steel glittered in the Stygian's hand and with a
heave of his great dusky shoulders he drove the dagger into the
baron's fat body. Dion's high thin squeal broke in a strangled
gurgle and his whole flabby frame collapsed like melted butter. A
fool to the end, he died in mad terror, not knowing why. Flinging
aside the crumpled corpse, already forgetful of it, Thoth grasped
the ring in both hands, his dark eyes blazing with a fearful
avidness.</p>

<p>"My Ring!" he whispered in terrible exultation. "My power!"</p>

<p>How long he crouched over the baleful thing, motionless as a
statue, drinking the evil aura of it into his dark soul, not even
the Stygian knew. When he shook himself from his revery and drew
back his mind from the nighted abysses where it had been questing,
the moon was rising, casting long shadows across the smooth marble
back of the garden-seat, at the foot of which sprawled the darker
shadow which had been the lord of Attalus.</p>

<p>"No more, Ascalante, no more!" whispered the Stygian, and his
eyes burned red as a vampire's in the gloom. Stooping, he cupped a
handful of congealing blood from the sluggish pool in which his
victim sprawled, and rubbed it in the copper serpent's eyes until
the yellow sparks were covered by a crimson mask.</p>

<p>"Blind your eyes, mystic serpent," he chanted in a
blood-freezing whisper. "Blind your eyes to the moonlight and open
them on darker gulfs! What do you see, oh serpent of Set? Whom do
you call from the gulfs of the Night? Whose shadow falls on the
waning Light? Call him to me, oh serpent of Set!"</p>

<p>Stroking the scales with a peculiar circular motion of his
fingers, a motion which always carried the fingers back to their
starting place, his voice sank still lower as he whispered dark
names and grisly incantations forgotten the world over save in the
grim hinterlands of dark Stygia, where monstrous shapes move in the
dusk of the tombs.</p>

<p>There was a movement in the air about him, such a swirl as is
made in water when some creature rises to the surface. A nameless,
freezing wind blew on him briefly, as if from an opened Door. Thoth
felt a presence at his back, but he did not look about. He kept his
eyes fixed on the moonlit space of marble, on which a tenuous
shadow hovered. As he continued his whispered incantations, this
shadow grew in size and clarity, until it stood out distinct and
horrific. Its outline was not unlike that of a gigantic baboon, but
no such baboon ever walked the earth, not even in Stygia. Still
Thoth did not look, but drawing from his girdle a sandal of his
master&mdash;always carried in the dim hope that he might be able
to put it to such use&mdash;he cast it behind him.</p>

<p>"Know it well, slave of the Ring!" he exclaimed. "Find him who
wore it and destroy him! Look into his eyes and blast his soul,
before you tear out his throat! Kill him! Aye," in a blind burst of
passion, "and all with him!"</p>

<p>Etched on the moonlit wall Thoth saw the horror lower its
misshapen head and take the scent like some hideous hound. Then the
grisly head was thrown back and the thing wheeled and was gone like
a wind through the trees. The Stygian flung up his arms in maddened
exultation, and his teeth and eyes gleamed in the moonlight.</p>

<p>A soldier on guard without the walls yelled in startled horror
as a great loping black shadow with flaming eyes cleared the wall
and swept by him with a swirling rush of wind. But it was gone so
swiftly that the bewildered warrior was left wondering whether it
had been a dream or a hallucination.</p>

<h2><a id="phoenix4" name="phoenix4">CHAPTER 4</a>
</h2>

<p style="text-indent:0; margin-left:24%"><small>When the world was
young and men were weak, and the fiends of the night walked
free,<br>
I strove with Set by fire and steel and the juice of the
upas-tree;<br>
Now that I sleep in the mount's black heart, and the ages take
their toll,<br>
Forget ye him who fought with the Snake to save the human
soul?</small>
</p>
<br>

<p class="first">ALONE in the great sleeping-chamber with its high
golden dome King Conan slumbered and dreamed. Through swirling gray
mists he heard a curious call, faint and far, and though he did not
understand it, it seemed not within his power to ignore it. Sword
in hand he went through the gray mist, as a man might walk through
clouds, and the voice grew more distinct as he proceeded until he
understood the word it spoke&mdash;it was his own name that was
being called across the gulfs of Space or Time.</p>

<p>Now the mists grew lighter and he saw that he was in a great
dark corridor that seemed to be cut in solid black stone. It was
unlighted, but by some magic he could see plainly. The floor,
ceiling and walls were highly polished and gleamed dull, and they
were carved with the figures of ancient heroes and half-forgotten
gods. He shuddered to see the vast shadowy outlines of the Nameless
Old Ones, and he knew somehow that mortal feet had not traversed
the corridor for centuries.</p>

<p>He came upon a wide stair carved in the solid rock, and the
sides of the shaft were adorned with esoteric symbols so ancient
and horrific that King Conan's skin crawled. The steps were carven
each with the abhorrent figure of the Old Serpent, Set, so that at
each step he planted his heel on the head of the Snake, as it was
intended from old times. But he was none the less at ease for all
that.</p>

<p>But the voice called him on, and at last, in darkness that would
have been impenetrable to his material eyes, he came into a strange
crypt, and saw a vague white-bearded figure sitting on a tomb.
Conan's hair rose up and he grasped his sword, but the figure spoke
in sepulchral tones.</p>

<p>"Oh man, do you know me?"</p>

<p>"Not I, by Crom!" swore the king.</p>

<p>"Man," said the ancient, "I am Epemitreus."</p>

<p>"But Epemitreus the Sage has been dead for fifteen hundred
years!" stammered Conan.</p>

<p>"Harken!" spoke the other commandingly. "As a pebble cast into a
dark lake sends ripples to the further shores, happenings in the
Unseen world have broken like waves on my slumber. I have marked
you well, Conan of Cimmeria, and the stamp of mighty happenings and
great deeds is upon you. But dooms are loose in the land, against
which your sword can not aid you."</p>

<p>"You speak in riddles," said Conan uneasily. "Let me see my foe
and I'll cleave his skull to the teeth."</p>

<p>"Loose your barbarian fury against your foes of flesh and
blood," answered the ancient. "It is not against men I must shield
you. There are dark worlds barely guessed by man, wherein formless
monsters stalk&mdash;fiends which may be drawn from the Outer Voids
to take material shape and rend and devour at the bidding of evil
magicians. There is a serpent in your house, oh king&mdash;an adder
in your kingdom, come up from Stygia, with the dark wisdom of the
shadows in his murky soul. As a sleeping man dreams of the serpent
which crawls near him, I have felt the foul presence of Set's
neophyte. He is drunk with terrible power, and the blows he strikes
at his enemy may well bring down the kingdom. I have called you to
me, to give you a weapon against him and his hell-hound pack."</p>

<p>"But why?" bewilderedly asked Conan. "Men say you sleep in the
black heart of Golamira, whence you send forth your ghost on unseen
wings to aid Aquilonia in times of need, but I&mdash;I am an
outlander and a barbarian."</p>

<p>"Peace!" the ghostly tones reverberated through the great
shadowy cavern. "Your destiny is one with Aquilonia. Gigantic
happenings are forming in the web and the womb of Fate, and a
blood-mad sorcerer shall not stand in the path of imperial destiny.
Ages ago Set coiled about the world like a python about its prey.
All my life, which was as the lives of three common men, I fought
him. I drove him into the shadows of the mysterious south, but in
dark Stygia men still worship him who to us is the arch-demon. As I
fought Set, I fight his worshippers and his votaries and his
acolytes. Hold out your sword."</p>

<p>Wondering, Conan did so, and on the great blade, close to the
heavy silver guard, the ancient traced with a bony finger a strange
symbol that glowed like white fire in the shadows. And on the
instant crypt, tomb and ancient vanished, and Conan, bewildered,
sprang from his couch in the great golden-domed chamber. And as he
stood, bewildered at the strangeness of his dream, he realized that
he was gripping his sword in his hand. And his hair prickled at the
nape of his neck, for on the broad blade was carven a
symbol&mdash;the outline of a phoenix. And he remembered that on
the tomb in the crypt he had seen what he had thought to be a
similar figure, carven of stone. Now he wondered if it had been but
a stone figure, and his skin crawled at the strangeness of it
all.</p>

<p>Then as he stood, a stealthy sound in the corridor outside
brought him to life, and without stopping to investigate, he began
to don his armor; again he was the barbarian, suspicious and alert
as a gray wolf at bay.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="phoenix5" name="phoenix5">CHAPTER 5</a>
</h2>

<p style="text-indent:0; margin-left:30%"><small>What do I know of
cultured ways, the gilt, the craft and the lie?<br>
I, who was born in a naked land and bred in the open sky.<br>
The subtle tongue, the sophist guile, they fail when the
broadswords sing;<br>
Rush in and die, dogs&mdash;I was a man before I was a king.<br>
&mdash;<i>The Road Of Kings</i></small>
</p>
<br>

<p class="first">THROUGH the silence which shrouded the corridor of
the royal palace stole twenty furtive figures. Their stealthy feet,
bare or cased in soft leather, made no sound either on thick carpet
or bare marble tile. The torches which stood in niches along the
halls gleamed red on dagger, sword and keen-edged ax.</p>

<p>"Easy all!" hissed Ascalante. "Stop that cursed loud breathing,
whoever it is! The officer of the night-guard has removed most of
the sentries from these halls and made the rest drunk, but we must
be careful, just the same. Back! Here come the guard!"</p>

<p>They crowded back behind a cluster of carven pillars, and almost
immediately ten giants in black armor swung by at a measured pace.
Their faces showed doubt as they glanced at the officer who was
leading them away from their post of duty. This officer was rather
pale; as the guard passed the hiding-places of the conspirators, he
was seen to wipe the sweat from his brow with a shaky hand. He was
young, and this betrayal of a king did not come easy to him. He
mentally cursed the vainglorious extravagance which had put him in
debt to the money-lenders and made him a pawn of scheming
politicians.</p>

<p>The guardsmen clanked by and disappeared up the corridor.</p>

<p>"Good!" grinned Ascalante. "Conan sleeps unguarded. Haste! If
they catch us killing him, we're undone&mdash;but few men will
espouse the cause of a dead king."</p>

<p>"Aye, haste!" cried Rinaldo, his blue eyes matching the gleam of
the sword he swung above his head. "My blade is thirsty! I hear the
gathering of the vultures! On!"</p>

<p>They hurried down the corridor with reckless speed and stopped
before a gilded door which bore the royal dragon symbol of
Aquilonia.</p>

<p>"Gromel!" snapped Ascalante. "Break me this door open!"</p>

<p>The giant drew a deep breath and launched his mighty frame
against the panels, which groaned and bent at the impact. Again he
crouched and plunged. With a snapping of bolts and a rending crash
of wood, the door splintered and burst inward.</p>

<p>"In!" roared Ascalante, on fire with the spirit of the deed.</p>

<p>"In!" yelled Rinaldo. "Death to the tyrant!"</p>

<p>They stopped short. Conan faced them, not a naked man roused
mazed and unarmed out of deep sleep to be butchered like a sheep,
but a barbarian wide- awake and at bay, partly armored, and with
his long sword in his hand.</p>

<p>"In, rogues!" yelled the outlaw. "He is one to twenty and he has
no helmet!"</p>

<p>True; there had been lack of time to don the heavy plumed
casque, or to lace in place the side-plates of the cuirass, nor was
there now time to snatch the great shield from the wall. Still,
Conan was better protected than any of his foes except Volmana and
Gromel, who were in full armor.</p>

<p>The king glared, puzzled as to their identity. Ascalante he did
not know; he could not see through the closed vizors of the armored
conspirators, and Rinaldo had pulled his slouch cap down above his
eyes. But there was no time for surmise. With a yell that rang to
the roof, the killers flooded into the room, Gromel first. He came
like a charging bull, head down, sword low for the disembowelling
thrust. Conan sprang to meet him, and all his tigerish strength
went into the arm that swung the sword. In a whistling arc the
great blade flashed through the air and crashed on the Bossonian's
helmet. Blade and casque shivered together and Gromel rolled
lifeless on the floor. Conan bounded back, still gripping the
broken hilt.</p>

<p>"Gromel!" he spat, his eyes blazing in amazement, as the
shattered helmet disclosed the shattered head; then the rest of the
pack were upon him. A dagger point raked along his ribs between
breastplate and backplate, a sword-edge flashed before his eyes. He
flung aside the dagger-wielder with his left arm, and smashed his
broken hilt like a cestus into the swordsman's temple. The man's
brains spattered in his face.</p>

<p>"Watch the door, five of you!" screamed Ascalante, dancing about
the edge of the singing steel whirlpool, for he feared that Conan
might smash through their midst and escape. The rogues drew back
momentarily, as their leader seized several and thrust them toward
the single door, and in that brief respite Conan leaped to the wall
and tore therefrom an ancient battle-ax which, untouched by time,
had hung there for half a century.</p>

<p>With his back to the wall he faced the closing ring for a
flashing instant, then leaped into the thick of them. He was no
defensive fighter; even in the teeth of overwhelming odds he always
carried the war to the enemy. Any other man would have already died
there, and Conan himself did not hope to survive, but he did
ferociously wish to inflict as much damage as he could before he
fell. His barbaric soul was ablaze, and the chants of old heroes
were singing in his ears.</p>

<p>As he sprang from the wall his ax dropped an outlaw with a
severed shoulder, and the terrible back-hand return crushed the
skull of another. Swords whined venomously about him, but death
passed him by breathless margins. The Cimmerian moved in, a blur of
blinding speed. He was like a tiger among baboons as he leaped,
side-stepped and spun, offering an ever-moving target, while his ax
wove a shining wheel of death about him.</p>

<p>For a brief space the assassins crowded him fiercely, raining
blows blindly and hampered by their own numbers; then they gave
back suddenly&mdash;two corpses on the floor gave mute evidence of
the king's fury, though Conan himself was bleeding from wounds on
arm, neck and legs.</p>

<p>"Knaves!" screamed Rinaldo, dashing off his feathered cap, his
wild eyes glaring. "Do ye shrink from the combat? Shall the despot
live? Out on it!"</p>

<p>He rushed in, hacking madly, but Conan, recognizing him,
shattered his sword with a short terrific chop and with a powerful
push of his open hand sent him reeling to the floor. The king took
Ascalante's point in his left arm, and the outlaw barely saved his
life by ducking and springing backward from the swinging ax. Again
the wolves swirled in and Conan's ax sang and crushed. A hairy
rascal stooped beneath its stroke and dived at the king's legs, but
after wrestling for a brief instant at what seemed a solid iron
tower, glanced up in time to see the ax falling, but not in time to
avoid it. In the interim one of his comrades lifted a broadsword
with both hands and hewed through the king's left shoulder-plate,
wounding the shoulder beneath. In an instant Conan's cuirass was
full of blood.</p>

<p>Volmana, flinging the attackers right and left in his savage
impatience, came plowing through and hacked murderously at Conan's
unprotected head. The king ducked deeply and the sword shaved off a
lock of his black hair as it whistled above him. Conan pivoted on
his heel and struck in from the side. The ax crunched through the
steel cuirass and Volmana crumpled with his whole left side caved
in.</p>

<p>"Volmana!" gasped Conan breathlessly. "I'll know that dwarf in
Hell!" He straightened to meet the maddened rush of Rinaldo, who
charged in wild and wide open, armed only with a dagger. Conan
leaped back, lifting his ax.</p>

<p>"Rinaldo!" his voice was strident with desperate urgency. "Back!
I would not slay you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Die, tyrant!" screamed the mad minstrel, hurling himself
headlong on the king. Conan delayed the blow he was loth to
deliver, until it was too late. Only when he felt the bite of the
steel in his unprotected side did he strike, in a frenzy of blind
desperation.</p>

<p>Rinaldo dropped with his skull shattered, and Conan reeled back
against the wall, blood spurting from between the fingers which
gripped his wound.</p>

<p>"In, now, and slay him!" yelled Ascalante.</p>

<p>Conan put his back against the wall and lifted his ax. He stood
like an image of the unconquerable primordial&mdash;legs braced far
apart, head thrust forward, one hand clutching the wall for
support, the other gripping the ax on high, with the great corded
muscles standing out in iron ridges, and his features frozen in a
death snarl of fury&mdash;his eyes blazing terribly through the
mist of blood which veiled them. The men faltered&mdash;wild,
criminal and dissolute though they were, yet they came of a breed
men called civilized, with a civilized background; here was the
barbarian&mdash;the natural killer. They shrank back&mdash;the
dying tiger could still deal death.</p>

<p>Conan sensed their uncertainty and grinned mirthlessly and
ferociously. "Who dies first?" he mumbled through smashed and
bloody lips.</p>

<p>Ascalante leaped like a wolf, halted almost in midair with
incredible quickness and fell prostrate to avoid the death which
was hissing toward him. He frantically whirled his feet out of the
way and rolled clear as Conan recovered from his missed blow and
struck again. This time the ax sank inches deep into the polished
floor close to Ascalante's revolving legs.</p>

<p>Another misguided desperado chose this instant to charge,
followed half-heartedly by his fellows. He intended killing Conan
before the Cimmerian could wrench his ax from the floor, but his
judgment was faulty. The red ax lurched up and crashed down and a
crimson caricature of a man catapulted back against the legs of the
attackers.</p>

<p>At that instant a fearful scream burst from the rogues at the
door as a black misshapen shadow fell across the wall. All but
Ascalante wheeled at that cry, and then, howling like dogs, they
burst blindly through the door in a raving, blaspheming mob, and
scattered through the corridors in screaming flight.</p>

<p>Ascalante did not look toward the door; he had eyes only for the
wounded king. He supposed that the noise of the fray had at last
roused the palace, and that the loyal guards were upon him, though
even in that moment it seemed strange that his hardened rogues
should scream so terribly in their flight. Conan did not look
toward the door because he was watching the outlaw with the burning
eyes of a dying wolf. In this extremity Ascalante's cynical
philosophy did not desert him.</p>

<p>"All seems to be lost, particularly honor," he murmured.
"However, the king is dying on his feet&mdash;and&mdash;" Whatever
other cogitation might have passed through his mind is not to be
known; for, leaving the sentence uncompleted, he ran lightly at
Conan just as the Cimmerian was perforce employing his ax-arm to
wipe the blood from his blinded eyes.</p>

<p>But even as he began his charge, there was a strange rushing in
the air and a heavy weight struck terrifically between his
shoulders. He was dashed headlong and great talons sank agonizingly
in his flesh. Writhing desperately beneath his attacker, he twisted
his head about and stared into the face of Nightmare and lunacy.
Upon him crouched a great black thing which he knew was born in no
sane or human world. Its slavering black fangs were near his throat
and the glare of its yellow eyes shrivelled his limbs as a killing
wind shrivels young corn.</p>

<p>The hideousness of its face transcended mere bestiality. It
might have been the face of an ancient, evil mummy, quickened with
demoniac life. In those abhorrent features the outlaw's dilated
eyes seemed to see, like a shadow in the madness that enveloped
him, a faint and terrible resemblance to the slave Thoth-amon. Then
Ascalante's cynical and all-sufficient philosophy deserted him, and
with a ghastly cry he gave up the ghost before those slavering
fangs touched him.</p>

<p>Conan, shaking the blood-drops from his eyes, stared frozen. At
first he thought it was a great black hound which stood above
Ascalante's distorted body; then as his sight cleared he saw that
it was neither a hound nor a baboon.</p>

<p>With a cry that was like an echo of Ascalante's death-shriek, he
reeled away from the wall and met the leaping horror with a cast of
his ax that had behind it all the desperate power of his
electrified nerves. The flying weapon glanced singing from the
slanting skull it should have crushed, and the king was hurled
half-way across the chamber by the impact of the giant body.</p>

<p>The slavering jaws closed on the arm Conan flung up to guard his
throat, but the monster made no effort to secure a death-grip. Over
his mangled arm it glared fiendishly into the king's eyes, in which
there began to be mirrored a likeness of the horror which stared
from the dead eyes of Ascalante. Conan felt his soul shrivel and
begin to be drawn out of his body, to drown in the yellow wells of
cosmic horror which glimmered spectrally in the formless chaos that
was growing about him and engulfing all life and sanity. Those eyes
grew and became gigantic, and in them the Cimmerian glimpsed the
reality of all the abysmal and blasphemous horrors that lurk in the
outer darkness of formless voids and nighted gulfs. He opened his
bloody lips to shriek his hate and loathing, but only a dry rattle
burst from his throat.</p>

<p>But the horror that paralyzed and destroyed Ascalante roused in
the Cimmerian a frenzied fury akin to madness. With a volcanic
wrench of his whole body he plunged backward, heedless of the agony
of his torn arm, dragging the monster bodily with him. And his
outflung hand struck something his dazed fighting-brain recognized
as the hilt of his broken sword. Instinctively he gripped it and
struck with all the power of nerve and thew, as a man stabs with a
dagger. The broken blade sank deep and Conan's arm was released as
the abhorrent mouth gaped as in agony. The king was hurled
violently aside, and lifting himself on one hand he saw, as one
mazed, the terrible convulsions of the monster from which thick
blood was gushing through the great wound his broken blade had
torn. And as he watched, its struggles ceased and it lay jerking
spasmodically, staring upward with its grisly dead eyes. Conan
blinked and shook the blood from his own eyes; it seemed to him
that the thing was melting and disintegrating into a slimy unstable
mass.</p>

<p>Then a medley of voices reached his ears, and the room was
thronged with the finally roused people of the court&mdash;knights,
peers, ladies, men-at- arms, councillors&mdash;all babbling and
shouting and getting in one another's way. The Black Dragons were
on hand, wild with rage, swearing and ruffling, with their hands on
their hilts and foreign oaths in their teeth. Of the young officer
of the door-guard nothing was seen, nor was he found then or later,
though earnestly sought after.</p>

<p>"The guard is here, you old fool!" cavalierly snapped
Pallantides, commander of the Black Dragons, forgetting Publius'
rank in the stress of the moment. "Best stop your caterwauling and
aid us to bind the king's wounds. He's like to bleed to death."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!" cried Publius, who was a man of plans rather than
action. "We must bind his wounds. Send for every leech of the
court! Oh, my lord, what a black shame on the city! Are you
entirely slain?"</p>

<p>"Wine!" gasped the king from the couch where they had laid him.
They put a goblet to his bloody lips and he drank like a man half
dead of thirst.</p>

<p>"Good!" he grunted, falling back. "Slaying is cursed dry
work."</p>

<p>They had stanched the flow of blood, and the innate vitality of
the barbarian was asserting itself.</p>

<p>"See first to the dagger-wound in my side," he bade the court
physicians.</p>

<p>"Rinaldo wrote me a deathly song there, and keen was the
stylus."</p>

<p>"We should have hanged him long ago," gibbered Publius. "No good
can come of poets&mdash;who is this?"</p>

<p>He nervously touched Ascalante's body with his sandalled
toe.</p>

<p>"By Mitra!" ejaculated the commander. "It is Ascalante, once
count of Thune! What devil's work brought him up from his desert
haunts?"</p>

<p>"But why does he stare so?" whispered Publius, drawing away, his
own eyes wide and a peculiar prickling among the short hairs at the
back of his fat neck. The others fell silent as they gazed at the
dead outlaw.</p>

<p>"Had you seen what he and I saw," growled the king, sitting up
despite the protests of the leeches, "you had not wondered. Blast
your own gaze by looking at&mdash;" He stopped short, his mouth
gaping, his finger pointing fruitlessly. Where the monster had
died, only the bare floor met his eyes.</p>

<p>"Crom!" he swore. "The thing's melted back into the foulness
which bore it!"</p>

<p>"The king is delirious," whispered a noble. Conan heard and
swore with barbaric oaths.</p>

<p>"By Badb, Morrigan, Macha and Nemain!" he concluded wrathfully.
"I am sane! It was like a cross between a Stygian mummy and a
baboon. It came through the door, and Ascalante's rogues fled
before it. It slew Ascalante, who was about to run me through. Then
it came upon me and I slew it&mdash;how I know not, for my ax
glanced from it as from a rack. But I think that the Sage
Epemitreus had a hand in it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hark how he names Epemitreus, dead for fifteen hundred years!"
they whispered to each other.</p>

<p>"By Ymir!" thundered the king. "This night I talked with
Epemitreus! He called to me in my dreams, and I walked down a black
stone corridor carved with old gods, to a stone stair on the steps
of which were the outlines of Set, until I came to a crypt, and a
tomb with a phoenix carved on it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In Mitra's name, lord king, be silent!" It was the high-priest
of Mitra who cried out, and his countenance was ashen.</p>

<p>Conan threw up his head like a lion tossing back its mane, and
his voice was thick with the growl of the angry lion.</p>

<p>"Am I a slave, to shut my mouth at your command?"</p>

<p>"Nay, nay, my lord!" The high-priest was trembling, but not
through fear of the royal wrath. "I meant no offense." He bent his
head close to the king and spoke in a whisper that carried only to
Conan's ears.</p>

<p>"My lord, this is a matter beyond human understanding. Only the
inner circle of the priestcraft know of the black stone corridor
carved in the black heart of Mount Golamira, by unknown hands, or
of the phoenix-guarded tomb where Epemitreus was laid to rest
fifteen hundred years ago. And since that time no living man has
entered it, for his chosen priests, after placing the Sage in the
crypt, blocked up the outer entrance of the corridor so that no man
could find it, and today not even the high-priests know where it
is. Only by word of mouth, handed down by the high-priests to the
chosen few, and jealously guarded, does the inner circle of Mitra's
acolytes know of the resting-place of Epemitreus in the black heart
of Golamira. It is one of the Mysteries, on which Mitra's cult
stands."</p>

<p>"I can not say by what magic Epemitreus brought me to him,"
answered Conan. "But I talked with him, and he made a mark on my
sword. Why that mark made it deadly to demons, or what magic lay
behind the mark, I know not; but though the blade broke on Gromel's
helmet, yet the fragment was long enough to kill the horror."</p>

<p>"Let me see your sword," whispered the high-priest from a throat
gone suddenly dry.</p>

<p>Conan held out the broken weapon and the high-priest cried out
and fell to his knees.</p>

<p>"Mitra guard us against the powers of darkness!" he gasped. "The
king has indeed talked with Epemitreus this night! There on the
sword&mdash;it is the secret sign none might make but him&mdash;the
emblem of the immortal phoenix which broods for ever over his tomb!
A candle, quick! Look again at the spot where the king said the
goblin died!"</p>

<p>It lay in the shade of a broken screen. They threw the screen
aside and bathed the floor in a flood of candle-light. And a
shuddering silence fell over the people as they looked. Then some
fell on their knees calling on Mitra, and some fled screaming from
the chamber.</p>

<p>There on the floor where the monster had died, there lay, like a
tangible shadow, a broad dark stain that could not be washed out;
the thing had left its outline clearly etched in its blood, and
that outline was of no being of a sane and normal world. Grim and
horrific it brooded there, like the shadow cast by one of the apish
gods that squat on the shadowy altars of dim temples in the dark
land of Stygia.</p>
