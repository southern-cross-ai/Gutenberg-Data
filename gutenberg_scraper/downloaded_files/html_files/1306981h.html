  <h3>BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTE</h3>

  <p class="intro">In April 1897 <i>Munsey's Magazine</i> began publishing a
  series of articles in which leading writers of the day discussed their
  favourite authors and what they considered to be their best books. The
following
  authors contributed to the series:</p>

  <ol style="margin-left:35%; font-size:1.1em">
    <li>William Dean Howells, April 1897</li>

    <li>Brander Matthews, May 1897</li>

    <li>Frank R. Stockton, June 1897</li>

    <li>Mrs. Burton Harrison, July 1897</li>

    <li>S.R. Crockett, August 1897</li>

    <li>Paul Bourget, September 1897</li>

    <li>Bret Harte, October 1897</li>

    <li>Ian Maclaren, March 1898</li>

    <li>Jerome K. Jerome, April 1898</li>
  </ol>

  <p class="intro"><i>Munsey's Magazine</i> introduces ACD's contribution to
  the series with the words: "Dr. Conan Doyle finds something admirable in
  almost every school of fiction, but names as his special favorites the
  romances of Sir Walter Scott, and Charles Reade's great historical novel,
  <i>The Cloister and The Hearth</i>."</p>

  <p class="intro">Copies of the other articles in the series are available at
  <a href=
  "http://www.unz.org/Pub/AllPeriodicals?View=Search"><b>Unz.org</b></a>, where
  they can be located by typing "My Favorite Novelist" in the "Title"
  search-box. &mdash;RG.</p><br>

  <br>

  <p class="first">IF some fairy godmother were to lead me into the reading
  room of the British Museum, and to say to me, "Upon these walls you will find
  the works of all the great story tellers of the world. Look at them well,
  weigh one against the other, and when you have quite made up your mind which
  is the greatest, you will yourself be endowed with that writer's virtues and
  failings," I should then, I think, approach the question with a keener sense
  of criticism and a more resolute effort to be clear in my own literary aims.
  But I know that the task would be a hard one, for I am catholic in my tastes,
  and every form of fiction&mdash;be it good of its kind&mdash;appeals to my
  admiration as freely as every flower in a garden. I have no sympathy for the
  petty critics who cannot enjoy Flaubert without belittling Scott, or relish a
  romance without sneering at the modern problem novel. They are all
  good&mdash;if they be but good of their kind&mdash;and there is room and to
  spare for all of them, if they serve to interest some section of the
  public.</p>

  <p>The idea that the writing of a novel is a sort of exact science, only to
  be approached in certain ways and along certain lines, by realism or by
  romance, is the utmost pedantry and cant. Here is the writer and there is the
  audience. Let him seek his subject where he will. Let him treat it how he
  will. But let him hold that audience&mdash;and if he continue to hold it long
  enough to show that his power does not spring from any passing fashion, he
  has then a real vocation, whether he deal with the court of a medieval king
  or that of an East End slum.</p>

  <p>But to recur to the stupendous offer of my fairy godmother, I can imagine
  myself seated in the midst of that enormous room, and gazing round at the
  books which line it, while I carefully consider which are those which I shall
  henceforth claim as my own. I review in my mind all those great writers whom
  I have admired and revered. I try to see their faults as well as their
  beauties. I turn to Tolstoy, and I am attracted by his earnestness and by his
  power of detail, but I am repelled by his looseness of construction and by
  his unreasonable and impracticable mysticism. I covet the literary but not
  the moral conscience of Zola. I long for the human humor of Dickens and the
  polished worldliness of Thackeray, but in each case deplore their want of
  form, their lack of that sense of construction which has been the weakest
  point of our English novelists. There are many great names left, but of them
  all there are three over which I should linger, if such a choice were
  mine&mdash;Scott, Dumas, Maupassant.</p>

  <p>Maupassant, with all his faults of taste, was such a natural, instinctive
  story teller, so concise, so admirably balanced, with such a range of
  sympathies. Of the great masters of fiction none, perhaps, combined high
  imagination with actual knowledge of life so fully as he. Some of his tales
  are, I grant, indefensible, but a French writer is to be judged by the
  standard of his own country, and it may at least be said of him that he is
  never coarse for the sake of coarseness, and that the humor or the drama of
  the situation is its excuse, if not its justification. And yet, as my good
  godmother waits impatiently for my choice, I pass my favorite of all short
  story writers regretfully by, and I turn to the full blooded, fiery Creole,
  the man of a hundred books and plays innumerable, the father of the
  Musketeers, and the grandfather of much of the fiction of today. Who can
  judge him impartially, for who is there who does not owe him a debt of
  gratitude? His colossal imagination, his great sweep, the masterful way in
  which he molds history to his own uses, these give him a place apart. Boy or
  man, simpleton or philosopher, all can find what they want in his pages.</p>

  <p>But if I am to choose between him and Scott, I must become <i>advocatus
  diaboli</i>, and seek for the flaws as well as the beauties of my Dumas. And
  it must be confessed that they abound. Amidst all this rattle of incident I
  catch but dim and uncertain glimpses of the world in which these people
  lived. I learn little&mdash;and that little I mistrust. These St. Vitus'
  dance conversations, too, which jerk and jump in little spasmodic sentences
  with unnecessary questions and gratuitous answers, do they not bear some
  relation to the daily column of some journal which had to be filled with its
  <i>feuilleton</i>? And then again, when a character becomes
  superhuman&mdash;like <i>Porthos</i>, who dies pulling down a mountain and
  slaying a regiment&mdash;he becomes not impressive, but grotesque. No, I will
  pass the Norman Frenchman, and I will pass the shock headed Creole, and I
  will fix my aspirations upon the canny Scotch lawyer, the man with the lame
  leg and the peaked head, who, with the heartiest contempt for his own
  profession, hardly deigning to acknowledge his work after he had done it,
  found time between his dogs, his plantations, and his sheriff's court to
  write the series of novels which has made the name of Scott immortal.</p>

  <p>For apart from the fact of his being the first&mdash;which, <i>ceteris
  paribus</i>, must give him an overwhelming share of the credit &mdash;how
  many points there are in which Scott was the master of Dumas, and how few in
  which he was his inferior. Let us grant that the Frenchman treated his women
  characters with more freedom, if with less reverence. Granted, also, that
  there is a certain touch and go quality about his story-telling which is
  racial rather than individual. But beyond this everything is in Scott's
  favor&mdash;his sanity, his restraint, his accuracy to history, his dignity,
  his power of realizing and reproducing a historical character as he
  reproduced Louis XI from the "Croniques" of Philippe de Comines, his exact
  knowledge, his humor. In the latter quality there can be no comparison
  between the two. Take the four comic servants of the musketeers, and compare
  them with <i>Friar Tuck</i>, with <i>Dandie Dinmont</i>, or, best of all,
  with <i>Dugald Dalgetty</i>, and you see the difference between a marionette
  and a human creature.</p>

  <p>But the most odious of all comparisons are those between two people whom
  you admire, and I should never have ventured upon so ungracious a task had I
  not been forced to justify myself for choosing the one, rather than the
  other, as my ideal. Let me speak rather of Scott's own virtues, without
  reference to any rival.</p>

  <p>First, as to his beautiful reverence for woman: is there in the whole list
  of his books one single scene which verges upon coarseness, or is there one
  precept to be gathered from them which is not gallant and manly? I
  acknowledge that it is not the primary duty of a novel to teach ethics; but
  granting that it fulfils all other conditions of a good novel, then it would
  be absurd to say that this is not an added merit.</p>

  <p>And then there is the fullness and accuracy of his knowledge. He knows the
  peculiarities of every class and of every trade. His fowlers speak like
  fowlers, his soldiers like soldiers, his physicians like the leeches of the
  period. He had a unique power of concentrating all his wide reading so as to
  build up a single definite picture. Take the work of his old age, "Count
  Robert of Paris." Who has ever realized the old Greek empire, grotesque,
  bloodstained, and yet venerable, as he has done in this book, which is
  usually quoted as the least successful of his writings? A student who had
  spent his whole life in studying the subject confessed that he had never
  realized it until this tired old giant came along and made the whole thing
  clear by a single flash of his imagination.</p>

  <p>It is worthy of note that Scott never wrote a line of fiction until after
  he was forty&mdash;in which he resembled many of the greatest novelists, for
  this art is the latest of all to mature. To describe life one must know it.
  Having once begun, he wrote with great rapidity, in spite of many
  distractions. The wise critics who are so ready to accuse modern writers of
  over production should remember that Scott turned out as many as three novels
  a year, each of them exceeding in length the average book of today. If the
  modern cannot justify his books by their merit, he can at least quote the
  aphorism of Dr. Johnson, who said that if a tree only produced crab apples,
  the tree which produced many of them was better than the one which produced
  few. On the whole, then, whether I take his quantity or his quality, his
  literary merit or his clean and noble moral influence, I should from all ages
  and all races place the author of "Ivanhoe" and of "Quentin Durward" at the
  highest pinnacle of his profession.</p>

  <p>But before choosing my favorite novelist I should have, as I have shown,
  to hesitate and to weigh one against the other. This would not be so in the
  case of my favorite novel. There my mind is entirely made up. It is a book by
  none of the great men whom I have mentioned, but it is one which, if the
  author could always have kept to that high level, would have placed him
  higher than them all. It is Charles Reade's "Cloister and the Hearth." Some
  books are great on account of the intellect which is shown in them, and some
  on account of the heart, but I do not know where I can find a book in which
  the highest qualities of head and of heart go together as they do in this
  one. From that noble and sonorous opening paragraph:</p><br>

  <p class="quote">There is a musty Chronicle written in tolerable Latin, and
  in it a chapter where every sentence holds a fact. Here is told with harsh
  brevity the strange history of a pair who lived untrumpeted and died unsung
  four hundred years ago, and lie now as unpitied on that stern page as fossils
  in a rock. Thus, living or dead. Fate is still unjust to them. For if I can
  but show you what lies below that dry Chronicler's words, methinks you will
  correct the indifference of centuries, and give those two sore tried souls a
  place in your heart for a day&mdash;</p>

  <p class="first">down to the last ringing sentence:</p>

  <p class="quote">The words of a genius so high as his are not born to die;
  their immediate work upon mankind fulfilled, they may seem to lie torpid;
  but at each fresh shower of intelligence Time pours upon their students they
  prove their immortal race; they revive, they spring from the dust of great
  libraries, they bud, they flower, they fruit, they seed, from generation to
  generation and from age to age&mdash;</p><br>

  <p>I have never found so much accurate knowledge and ripe wisdom and
  passionate human emotion within the covers of any single book.</p>

  <p>The story is to be told in a few sentences, and sounds bald enough, as all
  stories do when reduced to pure statement.</p>

  <p>A young Dutchman, <i>Gerard</i>, the son of <i>Eli</i>, somewhere about
  the year 1450 marries a girl, <i>Margaret</i>&mdash;sweetest of all heroines
  of fiction&mdash;and has a child, known in after years as the great Erasmus.
  Persecuted at home, he journeys across Europe to Rome, to earn some money by
  his ornamental manuscripts, which are rapidly being ousted by the printing
  press. While at Rome a false report of the death of <i>Margaret</i> reaches
  his ears, and, in his agony, he joins the priesthood and becomes a
  preaching friar. As such he visits Holland and finds the poor, faithful
  <i>Margaret</i> still waiting for him. His vows stand between her and him, so
  they live as friends and die as the novelist tells us. There lies the whole
  of the story, and it is from the struggle between the church and human love,
  the life of the home and that of the cloister, that the book takes its title.
  Such an indictment against celibacy of the clergy has never yet been
  penned.</p>

  <p>But the wonder of the book is the extraordinary clearness and power with
  which the middle ages, in many countries and from many points of view, are
  laid before us. As Mr. Hornung has picturesquely remarked, it is a
  searchlight thrown across medieval Europe. And it is a human medievalism,
  neither stiff nor conventional nor unnatural, but palpitating with rude life
  and with primitive emotions. We are convinced, as we read, that even such the
  people must have been, and so they must have thought and Erasmus, Froissart,
  Deschamps, lived. The atmosphere is so perfect and so consistent that we
  drift back into that dreadful life, and wake at the end of a chapter with a
  start and a sigh of relief to feel that we are living in a cleaner, fresher
  world, where force has been tempered by law and bigotry by reason.</p>

  <p>We see the castle of the brutal and ignorant noble which dominates the
  road. We see also the monastery, where a little spark of learning and
  humanity still glimmers amid that widespread darkness. We realize the inns,
  their discomforts and their dangers, the great woods swarming with robbers,
  the incessant wars, the grossness and superstition of the people, and yet the
  picture is lightened, as life is lightened, by the traits of kindliness and
  nobility which in all ages, and under every condition, will break out in
  human nature; the self sacrifice which springs from love, the loyalty of
  friends, the kindliness of women, and the devotion of the poorer clergy.</p>

  <p>Wonderfully reproduced, also, is that atmosphere of wonder and of
  adventure which pervaded the world in a time when there always hung a mirage
  over the horizon. A man knew the city in which he was born&mdash;perhaps also
  a little of the country around it; but over the river, or beyond the
  mountains, it was all a land of mystery, a place where anything might befall
  him. If he traveled, it was along villainous, deeply rutted roads, with
  danger like a hedge upon either side of them, and the chances of an ambuscade
  at every defile. Printing was coming, the Reformation was coming, the revival
  of learning was just at hand, but the greater part of Europe still lay in
  that blackest night which precedes the dawn.</p>

  <p>I do not know that Charles Reade has anywhere left it upon record how many
  books went to the making of this one, but it is evident that only very wide
  reading could give him the store of knowledge from which he draws so freely.
  And it is necessary not only to collect such knowledge, but to digest and to
  assimilate it, before it can be used in a natural fashion, without any savor
  of pedantry. Sir Walter Besant, who is himself an authority upon this epoch,
  mentions Erasmus, Froissart, Deschamps, Esquillart, Gringoire, Villon, and
  Luther among the roots from which this great book has sprung.</p>

  <p>Consider the many sides of life which are treated here&mdash;all of them
  with the greatest minuteness of detail. We begin with the well ordered
  routine of provincial Holland, the thrifty, spotless, tile lined house of the
  burgher, with a passing glance into the palace of the Duke of Burgundy. We
  learn many things, incidentally and allusively, as such things should be
  learned in a novel, of the house-keeping of these people, of their dress, of
  their lives, of the Dutch school of painters, of the mystery plays, of their
  hunting, their archery, their views of existence. Then you start upon that
  wonderfully vivid journey from Holland to Rome. You pass into medieval
  Germany, you visit the slovenly inns, the dirty, drunken, good hearted
  people, the sluggish but honest traders. You are introduced to the old world
  soldier, and to that more deadly man, the old world physician. At Düsseldorf
  you strike the Rhine, the broad green highway which binds southern and
  northern Europe. You visit good abbeys and bad ones, consort with saints and
  sinners, take your chances with amorous hostesses and murderous hosts, learn
  incidentally the methods of scientific warfare in the middle ages, and the
  more complex methods of scientific begging, and so pass on through Burgundy
  and down to the sea.</p>

  <p>And then there is the Roman section, with its sketch of the renaissance,
  its dilettante cardinals who stand for the new dispensation, and its
  fanatical preaching friars who represent the old; its artists, its
  collectors, its debauched society, its hired assassins, and its very human
  and tolerant pope. Finally there is the somber and elaborate finale, which
  draws the life of the cloister and the life of the cell, and the moving study
  of that poor saint whose troubles arose from never having heard that pithy
  Western maxim, "One world at a time." When you look back on all this wide
  field of information you feel that it is not a mere book, but the
  distillation of a whole library, which you have been reading.</p>

  <p>So much for the head, but it is the qualities of heart which seem to me to
  be the greater of the two. With what tenderness the piteous story is told!
  How warm and true is Reade's sympathy with all that is human and good! The
  great heart of the man sets the whole book throbbing. From the first meeting
  of <i>Gerard</i> and <i>Margaret</i>, when he plucks the straws to suck the
  soup, until he is laid in his coffin and stern old <i>Brother Jerome</i> lays
  the auburn tress upon his body, no such love story, so natural, so beautiful,
  and so tender, has been told in our time. You feel that the author has
  fulfilled that first essential for deeply moving others&mdash;he has been
  deeply moved himself Sad as it is, it is not maudlin or forced, but the
  solemn and tender sadness of life which has something sweet forever mixed
  with its bitterness. I know no scene in fiction which affects me so
  powerfully as the death of <i>Margaret</i>. The man who can read that chapter
  with dry eyes is a man whom I do not wish to know.</p>

  <p>There is no work of man which is not open to adverse criticism. Perfection
  never has and never will be attained. In Reade's case the imperfections, the
  irritating and superficial tricks of manner, are so obtrusive that they catch
  the eye to the exclusion, sometimes, of the rare qualities which lie beneath
  them. That a man of his judgment and discernment should try to emphasize a
  point by using large type, like a sensational daily paper, is a psychological
  curiosity. His style can be sonorous and beautiful, as in the opening and
  closing passages which I have quoted, but it can also be abrupt, jerky, and
  incoherent to an exasperating extent. But at least it was his own&mdash;"his
  skin and not his shirt," as Carlyle expressed it&mdash;and that is something
  in these days, when "style" is usually a short word for affectation.</p>

  <p>Bad also are Charles Reade's familiarities with his reader and with his
  characters, his trick of nicknaming them, his occasionally clumsy
  playfulness, his eternal asides, his habit of destroying the illusion by
  alluding to modern matters in what purports to be an ancient chronicle. But
  when all this has been most freely discounted, there still remains enough
  virtue in this novel to make it, in my eyes, the wisest and the most
  beautiful I have ever read.</p>

  <p>A. Conan Doyle.</p>
