<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>Chapter 1</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>A FAT and rather untidy man sat in a boxlike office in the
second story of a building near Portsmouth Square. In those days
that was not far from the water front, and the man could look
directly out to the Bay where lay, rotting at their chains, scores
of wooden vessels, deserted by their crews for the gold rush of
'49, and since superseded by the faster clippers made necessary by
the shifts of trade. He sprawled back in his chair, his booted feet
on the flat desk, his black wide hat over his eyes. In his mouth
was an unlighted cigar which he revolved methodically with his
teeth and tongue. The end of the cigar had become frayed in the
process. Every so often the man removed it momentarily to blow
forth at random small wet pieces of tobacco that had become
detached.</p>

<p>He was alone in the room, which was small and ostentatiously
plain both in ornament and furnishing: a pine box, carpeted with
coco matting; a few shelves of law-books; another, less
comfortable, chair; and a spittoon. This crudeness was unnecessary,
a pose; for San Francisco was some years out of its swaddling
clothes, and Jake Conger's fortune by now was tidily on toward the
seven figures.</p>

<p>Jake continued to stare at the abandoned ships. After a time,
absent-mindedly, he struck a match and applied the flame to the end
of the cigar. Only with some difficulty, and considerable
mechanical ingenuity, did he manage to get the poor demoralized
thing going. He persisted patiently, though a half-dozen fresh
cheroots peeped from his vest pocket.</p>

<p>Behind him the door opened and closed.</p>

<p>"Hullo?" said Jake Conger inquiringly, but without bothering to
turn his head.</p>

<p>"Jake!" cried an amused voice on a note of false alarm, "your
chewing tobacco's on fire!"</p>

<p>The fat man withdrew his booted feet from the desk top, swiveled
about to face his visitor. The latter was as slender as the other
was fat; as spick and span as the other was untidy; a man perhaps
rising fifty, but with the fresh skin and snapping live eyes of
youth. He was dressed in the height of one of the half-score of
fashions affected by the San Francisco of that day: a high flaring
collar above a wide bow stock; a low-cut waistcoat; an ample blue
coat with a wide rolled collar and tails behind; tight-fitting
striped pantaloons strapped beneath the insteps of varnished boots.
In one hand he skillfully carried a polished cane, a pair of
gloves, and a tall hat. A roach of upstanding white hair alone gave
him his proper age.</p>

<p>Jake Conger's shrewd eyes half closed, but he showed no other
indication of surprise. With one foot he dextrously spun the vacant
chair toward his visitor; and at the same time, as though with the
same motion, he produced more cigars, but from an inside
pocket.</p>

<p>"Set! Smoke!" he invited curtly.</p>

<p>The newcomer spread his tails, seated himself, laid aside his
hat and stick.</p>

<p>"Yours, or political?" he inquired, examining the cigars.</p>

<p>"Mine," said Conger. He touched his outside pocket.</p>

<p>"Political," he added, "next my heart, always, Braidwood."</p>

<p>"In that case&mdash;" accepted the visitor. He puffed for a
moment until the cheroot was well alight. "You seemed busy when I
came in."</p>

<p>"I was looking at them ships," said the fat man with sudden and
surprising animation, as though he had just awakened, "and
figgering. Seems like they ought to be good for <i>something.</i> A
man could get 'em cheap: for nothing, practically."</p>

<p>"You might pass a law," suggested the visitor blandly, "turn 'em
into prison ships, like the old <i>Euphemia.</i> You'll have enough
jailbirds to fill 'em all if things go on as they are. But look
here, Jake, I didn't come in to waste your time. I want you to do
me a favor."</p>

<p>"I thought likely," grunted Conger, but not unamiably. "Let's
hear it."</p>

<p>"I want a job."</p>

<p>"A job!" repeated Jake, after an instant of blank incredulity.
"F'r you? A job? What are you talking about?"</p>

<p>"Not for me," laughed Braidwood, "for someone else. And it has
to be an especial sort of job. That's why I came to you. There's
nothing in it&mdash;for anybody," he added at Conger's expression,
then laughed. "I'll tell you about it," he suggested.</p>

<p>"So do," grumbled Conger. The cigar began again its methodical
revolution, the movement imperiling the integrity of the ash, which
had grown to an inch or more in length. "Permit me," said
Braidwood. He whisked an ash tray from the desk, held it beneath
the end of the cheroot which he delicately flicked with the nail of
his little finger. Conger grunted. "Do not mention it," said the
visitor.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>"It is for my nephew," Braidwood began his explanation.</p>

<p>"Didn't know you had one," growled Conger.</p>

<p>"He has been here but a little over a week. He arrived on the
clipper <i>Thunder Bird.</i> I wish to find him suitable
occupation."</p>

<p>"Why don't you give him a job yourself?" growled Conger. "You
ought to have any amount of them."</p>

<p>"I could; here. But he is pretty young&mdash;just
twenty&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No good, eh?" interrupted Conger. "So it's to be a government
job! Well," he admitted cynically, "don't know but you're
right."</p>

<p>"He's a fine boy," Braidwood denied heatedly, "and he's going to
make a fine and able man, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what?" Jake Conger grinned.</p>

<p>"But he's young; that's all: he's just <i>young,</i> and this
town is bad for him, at least till he gets his feet under him."</p>

<p>"Twenty's not so young," said Conger. "Why, I mind me when
I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It isn't years; it's age&mdash;or rather it's youth, just sheer
youth. Some grow up quicker than others."</p>

<p>"Say!&mdash;" Jake leaned forward so suddenly that even his
heavy chair protested, "that wasn't your nephew by any chance that
I heerd 'em tellin' of that got into a row with Yankee Sullivan at
the El Dorado a night or so ago?"</p>

<p>Braidwood nodded. Conger removed the wreck of the cigar from his
mouth in order to whistle. "Suicidal tendencies, eh?" he remarked
dryly.</p>

<p>"Claimed he saw Sullivan slip a card on a <i>Chileño,"</i> said
Braidwood.</p>

<p>"So he had to horn in! How did he figger in it, even if 'twas
so? And what if it was? Who cares about a <i>Chileño,</i>
anyways?"</p>

<p>"I know, I know!" agreed Braidwood with a slight show of
impatience. "But that's just the point. He's young and he's green
and he's enthusiastic and he's come out West just honing for what
he calls adventure. You know yourself, Jake, that that is a bad
combination the way this town is put together right now. If it
hadn't been for Danny Randall and Diamond Jack, Yankee Sullivan
would have killed him the other night."</p>

<p>"Sure! I heard about that!" Conger contemplated the debris of
the cigar with regret, finally cast it accurately into the
spittoon. "Well, what is it you want of me?"</p>

<p>"I told you. A job for him. Something away from the city, with
some responsibility to it&mdash;or at least something that looks
responsible. Leslie is nobody's fool."</p>

<p>"Ain't many jobs with dry nurses to 'em," said Conger dryly.</p>

<p>Braidwood frowned.</p>

<p>"Now don't get me wrong, Conger," he said sharply. "The lad is
nobody's fool, and he can take care of himself and he'll learn
fast. But he's very young and he's idealistic&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I see your p'int," the fat man interrupted. He thoughtfully
produced another cheroot and stuck it in his mouth. Braidwood
watched him.</p>

<p>"He is the son of my youngest sister," said Braidwood after a
little. "I have not seen her since she was a baby, five or six
years old. That's a long time. But I was very fond of her, and she
must have been very fond of me and talked of me. At any rate, when
she died the boy came straight out here to me. Of course it may
have been merely a spirit of adventure&mdash;the West, the gold
fields. I don't know." He was talking more to himself than to
Conger.</p>

<p>"Well, I tell you: I got a kind of idea," said the latter
thickly over the obstruction of the cheroot. "You know the gov'ment
is tackling the land business lately, examining titles and
adjusting boundaries and the like." He waved his hand toward the
papers that strewed the top of the desk. "Big job. All mixed up."
He chuckled fatly. "Good pickings. Well, I think I could get this
boy of yours an appointment as Field Inspector. How'd that be?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. What is it? What does it amount to?"</p>

<p>"Nothing much. Just takes the grants and plots and checks up on
landmarks and boundaries, and so on, and makes a report as to
whether everything gees or not."</p>

<p>"And if it doesn't?"</p>

<p>"Well, then mebbe the land is declared public and open for
entry, or maybe suit is entered in Federal Courts. It all depends."
Conger grinned reminiscently. "I should say it did depend! You'd
better send your boy into a den of grizzly b'ars as up the Valley
where the squatters are strong. They make their own land laws and
they don't want no interference&mdash;unless it interferes their
way. But I was thinking we could send him up past Soledad. There's
a lot of <i>ranchos</i> up there, so far back that nobody even
knows they're there. How's it strike you?"</p>

<p>Braidwood nodded. "I knew I could depend on you, Jake. I won't
forget it."</p>

<p>"I don't intend you shall," returned Conger dryly. "That's all
right. Send him around to see me."</p>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>LESLIE DAYTON said good-by to his uncle and clambered aboard the
stage for San Jose. He had no regrets at leaving the excitements of
San Francisco, for he was of the forward-looking type that peers
always over the horizon. There true adventure ever dwells, though
to the impartial observer it would seem that enough of that
commodity could be picked up in any street or alley of the young
city. Indeed Leslie had thought such to be the case and had plunged
into the excitements of the place with an eager and reckless zest
that completely submerged his first slight disappointment that he
was not at once to go gold hunting in the placers. Braidwood
laughed indulgently at this idea.</p>

<p>"You're three years too late," said he. "That's all over&mdash;I
mean the romance. Oh, there's gold yet, but it's down mostly to
plain hard work. The fortunes are being made right here."</p>

<p>The boy had snapped eagerly at the position offered him by the
lawyer-politician as soon as he learned that it was to take him
into what, to him, was also a dwelling place of romance&mdash;the
ranch country of the old regime. To Conger's surprise, and somewhat
to his amusement, young Dayton proved to be not only quick of
mental grasp, but deadly earnest in his efforts to prepare
himself.</p>

<p>"You're right," he told Braidwood, "he's quite a youngster. And
he's going to make quite a man&mdash;if he lives that long. I told
him I wanted him to pull out right away, and he talked an arm off
me, insisting he couldn't possibly get ready inside a week. I gave
in to save my ears." Conger chuckled. "He's going to let me know
when he's ready to go," he added dryly.</p>

<p>"A week!" echoed Braidwood, aghast. "But that won't do."</p>

<p>"If you're thinking of Yankee Sullivan," said Jake Conger
comfortably, "rest yore mind. I've spoke my word, and he'll behave,
and so will all that gang as long as they know the kid is gittin'
out soon. I wouldn't answer if he was staying on. And I don't
reckon you need worry about his getting into no more trouble,
either."</p>

<p>"I wish I had your confidence." Braidwood shook his head.</p>

<p>"He's going to be too busy."</p>

<p>"Busy! At what?"</p>

<p>"Gitting him a good ready." The fat man dropped his chair to its
four legs and leaned his elbows on the desk. "You know where he is
now?"</p>

<p>"I'm getting afraid to guess where he is at any time."</p>

<p>"Well, he's at Judge McCain's law library. That kid's going to
know more land law than I know myself before he gets through. I
tried to tell him 'twa'n't necessary, that all he had to do was
report back what he saw and we'd tend to the law part of it, but he
said, if it was all the same to me, he'd ruther know what he was
doing."</p>

<p>"Well!" ejaculated Braidwood, impressed. He ran his hand through
his upstanding white hair, shook his head. "You surprise me! I
never would have suspected him of anything like
thoroughness&mdash;or interest, for that matter."</p>

<p>"I'll let you know when he gives me my orders." And Jake
chuckled again with vast relish.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the week had still two days to go when Jake was
recalled from his favorite occupation of staring across the Bay by
a knock at his door. So unusual a phenomenon was this that he
removed his feet and slewed his chair about before answering.</p>

<p>"Come in!" he shouted.</p>

<p>The door opened and closed.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's you!" said Jake Conger. He surveyed the visitor for
some moments speculatively, with an approval that was completely
cynical, somewhat reluctant, but still was approval. This was a
compact, medium-sized young man, wiry rather than muscular. He was
as dark of complexion as some Spaniards, with good-looking regular
features of no peculiar distinction; characteristics he probably
shared in general with a half hundred other youngsters in this
community of young men. But even in Jake Conger's eyes he stood out
as both individual and arresting. This was due to two things, or
rather to two different manifestations of the same thing. His eyes,
and to a lesser degree the set of his mouth, expressed an outgoing
eagerness: from his whole being emanated a vibrant vitality which
reminded Jake Conger of nothing so much as his setter dog, Shot,
awaiting his command to move forward. The young man had stopped
just inside the door. He held his hat in his two hands and fixed
his brilliant eyes on the lawyer, waiting for him to speak.</p>

<p>"Well?" said the latter after a moment.</p>

<p>"I'm all ready;" announced the boy. Beneath the studied evenness
of his voice was a lilt of eagerness.</p>

<p>"Know what you're to do, eh? And how to do it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"More'n I do," said Conger dryly, but he said it to himself.
"You got your maps of that country, and you copied out those
records like I told you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; all finished."</p>

<p>"Well then, come here." The fat man opened a drawer of his desk
from which he drew a document ornamented with a red seal. He
contemplated it a moment, then thrust it negligently across the
desk. "Thar's your commission," said he. "Hold up your right hand.
You do solemnly swear that you will"&mdash;he gabbled rapidly
through a form of oath, the words tumbling and slurring&mdash;"s'
help you God?" he ended and looked up.</p>

<p>Something in the boy's eyes dragged him to his feet.</p>

<p>"So help me God," repeated Leslie Dayton under his breath. "I
do," he said aloud. He took the paper almost reverently, looked at
it a moment.</p>

<p>"That's all," said Jake, recovering himself and flopping down
again into his chair. "When do you start?"</p>

<p>"Tomorrow." The boy hesitated. "Don't I wear a shield, or a
star, or something like that?"</p>

<p>Conger suppressed a grin.</p>

<p>"No, son," said he. "Them things go with sheriffs and marshals.
That dockyment is your authority. Take care of it. Remember now,"
he added with faint irony, "you're a responsible officer of the
United States gov'nment. Good-by and good luck."</p>

<p>"Good-by, sir." The young man shifted uneasily, finally blurted
out: "I want to tell you, sir, how deeply I appreciate this chance
and how grateful I am to you. I haven't much experience, but I'm
going to do the best I can to keep you from regretting your trust
in me."</p>

<p>Jake Conger, to his profound surprise and somewhat to his anger,
felt his face flush.</p>

<p>"All, right! All, right!" he growled. "Good-by. Let me hear from
you."</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>It had been decided, as most expedient, that Leslie should go by
the regular stagecoaches to San Jose, then to San Juan Bautista. At
the latter place he must buy a suitable horse through the offices
of a man to whom he would be accredited; after which he would
proceed in due course over the mountains to the valley of the
Salinas, and so to the scene of his proposed investigations. For
this purpose Braidwood supplied him with a small sum of money,
which he carried next to his skin in a soft leather belt with
pockets, but more liberally with letters of recommendation to
various people, like the man at San Juan, with whom Braidwood's
wide business interests had relation. These letters, together with
the commission with the red seal and maps and papers, Leslie
carried wrapped in oiled silk in a pair of aggressively new
saddlebags along with a change of clothing. This made rather a
clumsy and heavy parcel. Braidwood tentatively suggested so and
pointed out that a pack horse would make possible a less meager
equipment, but desisted instantly he perceived that the boy saw
this expedition as a kind of lone sortie, on his own resources,
into a wilderness. That was part of the excitement and went with
the little two-barreled derringer and the huge Colt's revolving
pistol that Leslie brought home from his first shopping. Braidwood
looked on these more than doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Those things are just likely to make trouble for you," he
objected. "I've never carried a pistol, and I've never had
difficulty, even when things were pretty rough; before we squelched
the Hounds. If you're known to be unarmed, they're likely to leave
you alone." However, he did not press the point. He refrained
carefully from issuing too much advice or warning. Leslie must cut
his teeth on life in his own way. So he clambered aboard the stage
with the two-barreled derringer up his sleeve, the way Danny
Randall carried it, the Colt's revolving pistol strapped about his
waist, the overstuffed saddlebags at his feet.</p>

<p>The stage was a high, open affair with five seats, each capable
of accommodating three. That occupied by the driver, of course,
faced forward. The remaining four faced one the other, in pairs.
This day there were, including Leslie, only a half-dozen
passengers. One, on invitation, sat with the driver. This was a
young man, tall and well knit, who climbed to his place with a
swing of grace that attested great power in control. He wore a long
linen duster, well buttoned, and a flat, low-crowned Spanish hat.
The darkness of his complexion and hair and the handsome regularity
of his features might, indeed, have indicated a Spanish origin, but
his eyes were of the uncompromising steel gray found in none but
the northern races. The expression of his countenance was grave and
self-contained. His glance crossed Leslie's briefly, without
expression. Nevertheless Leslie felt somehow appraised and young,
though he realized resentfully that this youth's years were no more
than his own. He flushed and climbed to his own place. For the
moment he rather regretted having buckled on the Colt's revolving
pistol quite so prominently. But the next passenger was similarly
armed, so he felt better.</p>

<p>This man was a rough-looking customer, long and angular, his
lean, sallow face covered with stubble of a length that left one in
doubt as to whether he was merely unshaven or was starting a beard.
His eyes were heavy-lidded, but here again one must remain in doubt
whether this expression was of insolence or a physical
characteristic. He wore rough garments, a queer mixture of frontier
and city, the trousers tucked in fancy-stitched boots, and with it
a scattering of Spanish ornamentation-silver <i>conchas</i>
studding belt and holster, a plaited horsehair band to his hat,
soft leather cuffs to his shirt. Leslie could not make him out. He
looked formidable. He settled himself in the seat opposite, spat
copiously overside, looked the boy over from head to foot.</p>

<p>Two other travelers, in no way remarkable, took places in the
seats back of Leslie. At the last moment, as the driver gathered
his reins, a small rotund man appeared, climbed nimbly up the two
iron steps, and plumped down opposite Leslie. He was slightly out
of breath, but he smiled inclusively and uttered a greeting. At
first glance he seemed a simple friendly soul, for his face was
round, his clear china-blue eyes as round as his face, and set so
wide apart that his whole expression was of radiating candor. He
wore a folded linen coat.</p>

<p>Hardly had he seated himself when the hostlers at the leaders'
heads sprang aside; the driver released the brake with a thrust of
his foot; the long-lashed whip cracked like a pistol.</p>

<p>The route led out of town by way of the Mission Dolores, over a
plank road on which the horses' hoofs clattered resoundingly. This
was a new part of town to Leslie, and he hung out the side of the
stage. Beyond the mission were two race tracks and a bull ring, and
as this was a holiday, the plank road was acrowd with interest. The
stage plowed through regardless, scattering the pedestrians and
horsemen right and left, forcing the other wheeled vehicles
perilously near the edge of the planking, beyond which was deep
sand or mud and almost the certainty of an overturn. Nevertheless,
no one seemed to take this in bad part. They scrambled hastily out
of the way, but once in safety they waved their hats at the stage
and grinned and shouted after it. The driver, the numerous reins
held delicately high, the whip slanted across, looked straight
ahead, paying them no attention. It was as if, to him, the road was
empty. The stage rolled grandly in the hollow reverberations from
the planks, and unconsciously Leslie partook of its immense
superiority, and himself became a superior being looking down from
the immunities of privilege.</p>

<p>Then suddenly the ear-filling roar of the wheels ceased, so
abruptly that it was like the casting aside of a garment. The stage
moved more quietly, less swiftly, over the soft earth of the county
road. And to it solitude had come as swiftly as quiet, for the
rabble of miners, hoodlums, Chinese and Mexicans afoot, the stream
of buggies, carts, coaches, and the elegant caleches of the
beautiful ladies had turned off at right angles to the race tracks
and the bull ring. The occasion was off parade. The horses
moderated their pace to a purposeful swift trot. The driver flipped
deftly the long trailing lash of his whip into a loop about its
stock and thrust it in its socket. He turned to talk to his
neighbor. The passengers sat back relaxed. The landscape, which had
been thrust aside for smaller pomposities, moved in close to take
its rightful preponderance, so that the misty Visitación's hills
and the sleepily glinting wide waters of the Bay and the blue
distances of the Contra Costa shores reasserted their quietude,
across which the tiny stagecoach crawled in a proper
insignificance.</p>

<p>This was all new and strange to Leslie, immensely exciting.
There was nothing like any of it in his former Pennsylvania home.
Except perhaps the meadowlarks that perched atop things and sang
golden liquid notes. They looked the same, but the things they sang
were different, Leslie's eyes roved avidly the wayside, eager for
each fresh surprise. And the surprises were many&mdash;a movement
of plumed quail over the gracious shoulder of a hill, hundreds of
them, thousands of them, so that it was as though the whole ground
shifted; an immense rabbit with ears that seemed to Leslie as long
as a mule's; wild fowl rising suddenly from a little near-by pond
which their close-packed bodies had obscured so that Leslie had not
suspected any pond at all, and the whistling of their wings like
the keening of a heavy wind; an iridescent red-and-gold jewel of a
hummingbird that came straight at the stage like a bullet and
poised on misty wings for several seconds not two feet from
Leslie's face and was gone. The road wound in and out the flanks of
the hills, each bend a disclosure and a surprise, and each rise to
a crest an anticipation. And in the sky great birds circling
stately, which Leslie thought might be eagles, but was not
sure.</p>

<p>So vibrantly absorbed was he by these and many other things that
he was aware of little else until a chance phrase caught him from
the conversation of the two men opposite him.</p>

<p>"No right to the land!" the rough-looking customer was saying
incredulously. "Haven't we taken the country?"</p>

<p>"That fact hardly gives title over those who already owned
it,"&mdash;suggested the other, but lazily, without conviction.</p>

<p>"Own it, hell! Who are they? A passel of greasers too lazy to
make any use of it. What right has ary one man to own fifty
thousand acres? I ask you that."</p>

<p>"Don't ask me." The smaller man waved a hand in disclaimer.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll tell you!" returned the other. "They got it by
cheating and false swearing and just plain bribing. Micheltorena
issued land grants after he was kicked out from being governor.
Pico sold 'em fast as he could as soon as he seen the country was
going to be American. Way I look at it that all these old grants
just plain lapsed when the country was took over. You mean to tell
me different?" He thrust his face forward truculently. The little
man seemed unalarmed.</p>

<p>"Not at all," he said amusedly. "But I still am inclined to
speculate on what the law is going to say finally to these
squatters&mdash;for that is exactly what they are. And how they
expect to get title."</p>

<p>"Law! title!" The other spat contemptuously overside. "The boys
across the Bay's got the right idea. They've took up their hundred
and sixty acres apiece, like they got a right to
anywhere&mdash;"</p>

<p>"On public land, not private land," murmured the small man.</p>

<p>The other paused to glare but made no direct answer. "And
they're raising crops. Danged good crops, too! I tell you, there's
a heap of land in Californy, and there's a passel of folks coming
across the plains looking for it. And when anyone asks them where's
their title, they got a cannon, and they point to that and tell 'em
there's their title, and it's good enough."</p>

<p>"Let's see, what's the name of the man the land belongs
to&mdash;is supposed to belong to?" the small man corrected
himself.</p>

<p>"Oh, an old greaser named Peralta. He claimed to own the whole
shore and way back into the hills. We showed him better."</p>

<p>"We? You claim land there?"</p>

<p>"I sort of got the boys settled."</p>

<p>"Peralta; that's it. I remember. Put him in jail, didn't you,
and fined him&mdash;for attempting to put off
trespassers&mdash;what he called trespassers, that is? Isn't that
pretty rough?"</p>

<p>"I'd like to know why. He's got to be l'arned. Don't waste no
tears on that old son of a bitch. He'd steal you blind. He's a
greaser, I tell you, and I never seen one yet that wasn't a dirty
liar and a thief."</p>

<p>The young man on the front seat turned his head, gravely
surveyed the speaker for a moment, and turned back again.</p>

<p>The stage rounded the last of Visitación's shoulders and came
out upon a wide plain between the Santa Cruz mountains and the Bay.
Here were spaced live oaks and ripening grasses that bent in the
breeze, and bands of cattle here and there, and watercourses with
sycamores voiced with the soft mourning of doves. The coolness of
the upper end of the peninsula gave way to the power of the sun, so
that the dust of the road awakened from its damp sleep and
enveloped the vehicle in a cloud. The stage driver and the other
passengers produced wide bandannas of cotton or silk, which they
tied loosely across the lower parts of their faces. The small man
buttoned his long linen coat to his chin. Leslie, inexperienced in
this sort of travel, had provided no such protection. The dust was
powder fine. The slightest wind current lifted it. A ground
squirrel, scampering across, raised a cloud of it that hung in the
air and resettled slowly and reluctantly.</p>

<p>"I suppose," the bigger man continued the conversation in
muffled tones, "that you figger good American citizens are agoing
to pack up and git off'n their own property just because a lot of
lawyers tell 'em to!"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't dare guess."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you fight ef'n somebody tried to put you off yore farm
that you'd t'iled and sweat over to make yourself a home in the
wilderness?" insisted the other oratorically.</p>

<p>"Probably! Probably!" conceded the small man.</p>

<p>"And," he added, "I'd probably do a little fighting if a gang of
cutthroats came and sat down on land I'd always owned and declined
to get off."</p>

<p>"Hell!" said the other man contemptuously. "That kind ain't got
no fight in 'em!"</p>

<p>The small man burst out laughing.</p>

<p>"That's the spirit!" he cried. He fumbled beneath the folds of
his duster and produced a silver-mounted flask. "Wet your whistle,"
he invited. "This is the driest dust I ever saw. Drink hearty!" he
urged. "Here's hoping you find what you want."</p>

<p>The other accepted the flask readily enough but eyed its donor
suspiciously.</p>

<p>"'Now what do you mean by that?"</p>

<p>"Why, you're looking for land yourself, aren't you?"</p>

<p>The other continued to eye him in silence. "No offense. It's
nothing to me." He retrieved the flask and offered it to Leslie,
who touched it to his lips. "If you find anything real good you
might let me know. I might turn farmer myself. How much could you
use, stranger? How many in your gang?" He turned his wide blue eyes
on the other, a certain insolence beneath their blank, candid
surfaces. Leslie looked from one to the other, perplexed.</p>

<p>Shortly the stage drew up at a tiny shack carrying a huge
sign&mdash;Ten Mile House&mdash;and behind it a series of corrals
with horses. Here the team was to be changed. The passengers
descended to walk about, climbing a little stiffly down the series
of small iron steps. The young man in the front seat with the
driver, however, vaulted over the high front wheel to the ground as
lightly as a cat. He turned at once to address Leslie's neighbor
who had so freely aired his views. His head was back; his gray eyes
were cold and level; the curves of the lower part of his handsome
face had hardened.</p>

<p>"I have overheard what you have been saying," he said clearly
and loudly. "I wish to state that Don Luis Peralta is an honorable
man and a gentleman who has been most foully treated by a parcel of
blackguards and cut-throats, and anyone who says different
lies."</p>

<p>The man stared, struck motionless and speechless for a moment by
sheer astonishment. The bystanders took advantage of this pause to
move with considerable celerity to right and left. Leslie looked
from one to the other of the principals, himself a trifle
bewildered, Then slowly the man's chest heaved in a deep breath.
His lips drew back.</p>

<p>"Are you calling me a liar?" he asked softly at length.</p>

<p>"You've called yourself that a dozen times," said the young man.
His hands hung loosely at his sides; his eyes held the other
steadily. Leslie was suddenly invaded by a panic of haste. He
alone, beside these two, seemed alive. The others were like a group
of wax figures, so still and impartially attentive were they. Good
God, did none of them intend to interfere? Could not they see the
man's hand stealing backward to his holster? Were they going to
stand aside while murder was committed, murder of an unarmed man?
Belatedly Leslie remembered the Colt's revolving pistol at his own
belt, for the man's hand was already on the butt of his own weapon.
He snatched for it and tugged at it, but it stuck in the new stiff
leather; and at any rate, his swifter thoughts realized, it would
be too late.</p>

<p>"By God!" cried someone.</p>

<p>The half-drawn pistol had clattered to the ground. Its owner was
holding his right wrist with his left hand and staring
incredulously at a knife transfixing his forearm.</p>

<p>Leslie managed at length to wrench his own weapon free. He
rushed forward and thrust it into the young man's hand. The latter
nodded without looking at him.</p>

<p>"Thanks," said he briefly. "There's no need."</p>

<p>Nevertheless he accepted the weapon.</p>

<p>As though his movement had released the occasion, the bystanders
now crowded about.</p>

<p>"By God!" cried one. "That was the slickest thing I ever
saw!"</p>

<p>"Your hand, sir! I'm free to confess I never saw faster
work!"</p>

<p>"He deserved what he got!" cried a third effusively.</p>

<p>"Like a snake, by gad! Like a snake striking!"</p>

<p>The young man, however, shook them off impatiently.</p>

<p>He addressed the stage driver, who still stood apart, chewing a
nonchalant quid.</p>

<p>"Better take a look at him, Jim," said he, "and get me back my
knife."</p>

<p>The driver nodded and stepped forward to comply.</p>

<p>"I'm a doctor," spoke up the small rotund man. He took charge of
the cursing victim.</p>

<p>"Let go your arm," he commanded. "How can I do anything?" He
drew out the knife with a sudden deft motion and applied his thumbs
to the lips of the wound. "Water," he commanded the stage driver,
"and bring me my bag."</p>

<p>Most of the bystanders, including Leslie, crowded close to watch
his operations. Some talked apart. No one, for the moment,
approached the young man who stood leaning idly against the front
wheel of the stage. The hostlers resumed the changing of the
team.</p>

<p>The doctor worked busily and skillfully, talking the while,
partly to himself, partly to his patient, partly to his
assistant.</p>

<p>"Clean incision&mdash;skipped the artery. Hold still. Of course
it hurts; it may hurt more. You're lucky, no artery punctured, no
tendons cut; good as ever soon...Fresh water...Anybody got a larger
handkerchief?...If that starts to bleed through let me know...Pour
the rest of that over my hands." He straightened his back. He
seemed abruptly to have forgotten the existence of the man he had
been treating, to be unaware of the crowding spectators, so that
miraculously he and the stage driver seemed to be alone together.
"That was like lightning, Jim," he observed, drying his hands
reflectively on a bandanna. "Like a rattlesnake. I suppose it was
no lucky accident? The only man I ever heard of who was said to be
able to handle a knife like that was a man named Burnett, an
old-timer. They told some steep yarns of what he could do."</p>

<p>"Yon lad's name is Djo Burnett," said the stage driver.</p>

<p>The doctor looked across at the young man.</p>

<p>"So!" He picked up the knife and wiped it on the bandanna, which
he threw away. He also possessed himself of the desperado's pistol
from the dust where it had fallen. Briskly he stepped across to the
youth.</p>

<p>"Here's your snickersnee," said he, "and you'd better take
charge of this thing for a while."</p>

<p>"How is he?" The young man nodded his thanks. He thrust the
knife into a sheath beneath the linen duster and handed the
revolver to Jim.</p>

<p>"Clean incision. No major blood vessels cut, nor tendons. He'll
be all right in a fortnight."</p>

<p>"That's good," said Djo Burnett.</p>

<p>"Could you do that again?" asked the doctor curiously.</p>

<p>"Why, he wasn't three yards away!" Djo appeared faintly
astonished.</p>

<p>"Yes, I reckon you could," concluded the doctor with
satisfaction. "But I don't see yet how you did it! I didn't see you
move. How the devil could you get at the thing so fast?"</p>

<p>"The knife? Oh, I had that in my hand. I'd be a fool to talk
trouble without being ready for trouble." He looked about at the
ring of interested observers, obviously embarrassed at so much
publicity. But the little doctor was like a terrier on a root. His
was the scientific mind: he wanted always to get at the bottom of
things.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you kill him?" he persisted. "You could have."</p>

<p>"Too much trouble." Djo was recovering his self-possession and
about to take control. He turned to the stage driver. "About ready,
Jim?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I see; to be sure." The doctor glanced at the late
victim, his arm in a sling, glowering in the background.</p>

<p>"Git aboard," summoned the driver. "We better be gitting on.
Here, you," he called to the wounded man, "you git up here with me.
No, I mean it. We ain't going to have any more trouble while I'm in
charge. Climb up where I can keep an eye on you."</p>

<p>The man grunted contemptuously, but he obeyed.</p>

<p>"You'll hear from me again," he promised Djo; and to Leslie, "As
for you, greenhorn, you better l'arn to keep out of what ain't your
business."</p>

<p>"Come on! Climb!" said Jim, unimpressed.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>The hero of this episode took his place alongside Leslie.</p>

<p>"Here's your pistol," said he, "and I want to thank you again.
It's a beauty. I wish I had one like that. My father has one of the
first ones that ever came out here, and he's promised me one when I
can beat him shooting. That'll be never, I guess," the young man
sighed.</p>

<p>Reassured that his wearing of the weapon was not scorned, Leslie
slipped it back in its holster.</p>

<p>"It was nothing," he muttered. "Nobody could stand by and see a
man murdered in cold blood." He laughed. "But you don't need any
pistol. I never saw anything like that. Is it difficult?"</p>

<p>"Not that close. Just a trick. Takes practice."</p>

<p>"It was a mighty fine thing to do."</p>

<p>The other boy's face flushed slowly. "It was foolish," he
acknowledged candidly. "My father is going to give me the devil
when he hears about it. He thinks it's foolish to fight unless you
have to."</p>

<p>"But you certainly had to," cried Leslie loyally; "you'd have
been killed otherwise."</p>

<p>His companion smiled wryly.</p>

<p>"I didn't have to get into the mess in the first place. What
difference does it make what that sort says?" He changed the
subject abruptly. "My name is Djo Burnett," said he. "You spell it
D-j-o."</p>

<p>"I am Leslie Dayton. I am from Philadelphia. Have you been out
here long?"</p>

<p>"Me? Oh, I was born here." Djo brushed this aside.
"Philadelphia?" he cried. "And have you been to New York?"</p>

<p>His steady gravity had dropped from him, and with it the
illusion of greater maturity and more years. He was of an age with
his companion. He plied Leslie with eager questions of the great
cities of the East and their peoples and their customs.</p>

<p>"It must be wonderful!" he sighed. "I've never seen a city. Only
Monterey and this new San Francisco. But they are not the same. I'd
like to go back there. I'd like to go to one of the colleges. Have
you been to college?"</p>

<p>"Only for a year, at the Boston college of Harvard. Then my
mother died, and I came out here to my uncle, her brother."</p>

<p>"Ah, I am sorry," said Djo gently. Then after a moment, "Is he
all you have left?"</p>

<p>"No, no"&mdash;Leslie hastily disclaimed the pathetic
role&mdash;"but&mdash;well, you see, I wanted to get out
here&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Been to the diggings?" asked Djo shrewdly.</p>

<p>"My uncle says it is too late for them."</p>

<p>Djo nodded. "Yes, that's so, I guess. The fun's mostly out of it
now. Five years ago&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did you see them?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I was too young. I wanted to, but my father wouldn't let
me."</p>

<p>"He went, didn't he? Did he have any luck?"</p>

<p>"No, he didn't go."</p>

<p>"I thought everybody went, according to the stories they
tell."</p>

<p>"Almost everybody did. But you see one side of my family is
Spanish. My mother is Spanish. My grandfather is a very wise man,
an <i>hidalgo.</i> When they found this gold, and everybody dropped
everything and began to rush to the placers, Don
Sylvestro&mdash;that's my grandfather&mdash;called in all my uncles
and all the family to talk it over. This is what he said to us:
that God must have intended the gold for the Americans. 'If he had
wanted the Spanish to have had it,' he said, 'he would have let
them discover it before now. So do not go after it. Go back to the
<i>ranchos.</i> Raise meat, for these people must eat while they
live.'"</p>

<p>"So did none of you go?" asked Leslie, curious.</p>

<p>Djo opened his eyes in surprise. "Why, for sure not! Don
Sylvestro is the head of the family!"</p>

<p>Leslie remembered the enormous upheaval in his own family before
he was allowed to come West.</p>

<p>"But your father&mdash;he is not Spanish," he pointed out.</p>

<p>"No, but he is of the family," replied Djo, as though this
settled it.</p>

<p>The stage had by now left the shore of the Bay.</p>

<p>Through the wide flat gap between the hills of Visitación and
the beginnings of the Santa Cruz mountains sucked a westerly
breeze, bringing with it a faint, far tang of the sea. It flattened
the lazy dust clouds, bore them away in long streamers low to the
ground.</p>

<p>"Whee, that's better!" cried Leslie, breathing deep of the
unsullied air.</p>

<p>The passengers undid the protective bandannas and handkerchiefs,
wiped their faces, beat themselves partially free from the powder
of dust.</p>

<p>"It's no way to travel," said Djo contemptuously. "We shan't get
into San Jose before dark. California fashion we'd do it in six
hours."</p>

<p>"Sixty miles? What do you do: fly?"</p>

<p>Djo explained. A half-dozen horses apiece, <i>vaqueros</i> to
drive them and shift saddles, frequent changes of mount before
anyone tired, abandoning any that showed signs of actual
exhaustion.</p>

<p>"Though that is not often; our horses are good," said he.</p>

<p>"I'd be the one to be abandoned," chuckled Leslie. "I'd never be
able to ride sixty miles. I'd die."</p>

<p>But he got the impression of a certain magnificence that
inspired his imagination. He turned the tables on Djo, began to
question in his turn. Djo knew everything. He knew the smallest
animals, the tiniest birds, often by only a flick of color, a
flutter of wing, or a single note of song caught above the rumble
and creak of the stage. He knew the reasons for apparent
foolishness, such as the broad leather band, or corset, fully eight
inches wide, that the stage driver wore about his middle. It was
studded with silver <i>conchas</i> and embroidered in intricate
patterns of stitches, and Leslie had imagined it sheer swank and
display, with which, secretly, he sympathized. But it seemed the
thing had sense.</p>

<p>"You'll know why before you get to Monterey," said Djo. "You'll
feel as if your insides had been jarred loose, and you'll be so
sore around the body that you can't wiggle." He showed Leslie that
he had bound his own waist close with a number of folds of a broad
Spanish sash. "It's no way to travel," he repeated, "but sometimes
you've got to do it."</p>

<p>In spite of Djo's scorn, however, the stage made good time. It
was part of a service new since the Occupation. Leslie had
difficulty in understanding that only so few years ago wheeled
vehicles were practically unknown in California&mdash;except
<i>carretas</i> and a few state carriages. Djo described
<i>carretas.</i> Behind his habitually grave expression was hidden
a delightful humor. Leslie shouted with laughter.</p>

<p>Every ten miles or so they stopped briefly for a change of
horses. On these occasions the passengers debarked for a hasty
stretch of the leg. But not for long. Jim, the driver, herded them
aboard. He permitted no unnecessary delay. The company was proud of
the fact that it covered the distance to San Jose in a single day.
Nevertheless it was a hard and jolting journey; and, in spite of
his interest in new things and his vital youth, Leslie found
himself lapsing into longer and longer silences as the day
progressed. When at last the stage made its dashing entrance into
the sprawling little town and drew up before the crude frame
structure of its leading hotel, he was glad of the cool basin of
water and the bed in the little redwood box of a room assigned to
him.</p>

<p>There he fell promptly asleep, nor did he stir until aroused by
the beating of a gong. He went to the dining room where he was
placed at a long table seating perhaps forty people. He recognized
among them all his fellow passengers with the exception of young
Burnett. A printed menu offered him, besides beef, a choice of bear
steak, elk steak, venison, rabbit, wild goose, duck, quail, and
snipe. These were on the regular bill. By payment of an extra
dollar he could have canned oysters. One fresh egg was fifty cents.
Potatoes were fifty cents. He resisted these temptations and
ordered bear steak, largely because the sound of it was
picturesque. It proved fibrous and strong, but Leslie chewed away
on it obstinately, unwilling to confess his mistake.</p>

<p>After the meal he sauntered outside toward the narrow wooden
veranda where a row of chairs fronted the night. On his way he was
intercepted by a clerk who handed him a folded paper.</p>

<p class="letter">I waited a while but did not want to wake you up
[it read] I am staying with some friends on a rancho and have to go
on. But I'll be seeing you in Monterey before long. I'll look you
up, and I certainly do appreciate how you stood by. I might have
missed my throw, and then I'd have been in a nice fix. That's what
my father is going to tell me.<br>
<br>
Djo Burnett</p>

<p>Leslie read the note under the oil lamp. Djo had, he remembered,
assumed that he was on his way to Monterey. That was natural, for
Monterey was the stage-line terminus. Now he would not see him
again. That was distinctly disappointing. He liked Djo.</p>

<p>The other guests idled by him on their way from the dining room
to the bar or to the veranda. Among them Djo's antagonist, his arm
in its sling, was bragging loudly.</p>

<p>"It's a damn lucky thing for him he run away," he was saying to
anyone who would listen. "He knows what's good for him. But he'll
hear from me yet."</p>

<p>"Better keep out of knife range, Ransom," someone advised him
dryly.</p>

<p>"He don't ketch me like that again, Now I <i>know</i> he's a
rattlesnake. As for that other little whelp&mdash;" His eye fell on
Leslie. He advanced to within two feet and spread his feet apart
truculently. "I got you fixed in my mind, too, young feller, and
when I get the use of my arm again I'm going to make it my business
to l'arn you to keep out of what ain't your business. Understand
me?"</p>

<p>Leslie flushed. He was acutely uncomfortable. The man's
bloodshot eyes glared; his jaw was thrust forward belligerently. It
was obvious that he was more than half drunk. But his right arm was
helpless, and Leslie noted that his holster was still empty. It was
not fear that held the young man tongue-tied and embarrassed.
Simply that he did not know how he should act in such a situation,
and he felt he had a critical audience.</p>

<p>He was relieved of the necessity by the sudden interposition of
the doctor. The little man, without the envelopment of his linen
duster, was seen to be dressed with exquisite neatness in the
height of fashion. He stopped on his way by, arrested by the
desperado's vehemence and the expectant group around him. He fixed
Ransom with his birdlike black eyes.</p>

<p>"You'd better 'l'arn' yourself to behave and go to bed at once,
or you may not have any arm to get the use of," he snapped
contemptuously. "What did I tell you about drinking?"</p>

<p>The bigger man wilted ludicrously.</p>

<p>"I only had a few little ones, Doc," he pleaded.</p>

<p>The doctor stared him down, then deliberately produced from his
waistcoat pocket an old-fashioned flat snuffbox of silver from
which he took a pinch. He held it suspended before him between his
thumb and forefinger.</p>

<p>"You've had a dozen," he said flatly. He swept his eyes with a
bland and impersonal arrogance over the men standing about. "I
don't know whether any of you have any interest whether this man
lives or dies," said he. "I'm sure I have not. But if you have, get
him to bed." He carried the snuff to his nostrils, turned his back
abruptly, hooking his arm through Leslie's.</p>

<p>"Let us enjoy the cool of the evening," he said. They walked
away together.</p>

<p>"I did not suppose he was so badly hurt," said Leslie.</p>

<p>"He isn't badly hurt. But if he drinks, he will have a fever;
and if the wound becomes inflamed&mdash;that type have none too
clean blood."</p>

<p>They sat in two of the wooden chairs on the veranda and tilted
back against the wall. The doctor produced two long thin cigars,
one of which he offered to Leslie.</p>

<p>"Right. Filthy habit," said he when the young man declined. "I
don't recommend it." He lighted the other and puffed comfortably
for a few moments in silence.</p>

<p>"None of my business," he said abruptly, "but are you going on
tomorrow&mdash;on the stage, I mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"That's good. This man Ransom is a good deal of a bully and a
braggart, but he is dangerous. I'd hate to see the two of you in
the same town."</p>

<p>"Then he's not going on?"</p>

<p>"He thinks he is. But by morning that arm will change his mind
for him. Unless he has more physical nerve than I credit him with."
The doctor removed the cheroot, looked at the end of it, returned
it to his mouth. "I don't want to exaggerate things, but look out
for this fellow. He's thoroughly vindictive. He's the kind that
does not forget what he considers an injury, and he'll go to
considerable lengths to get even. If you ever meet up with him
again, keep your eyes open. But he's a coward," he added.</p>

<p>"I will," said Leslie. "Do you know who he is?"</p>

<p>"I've seen him about. I know of him. He's just a sort of
professional bad actor. Thug for hire. Political henchman. Shyster
lawyer, I understand. Bravo. I don't know what all.
Worthless&mdash;but dangerous. Now about that thing you wear around
your waist." The little man permitted himself a brisk small grin.
"You don't impress me as an expert in its use."</p>

<p>Leslie flushed painfully.</p>

<p>"I'm not making fun of you, boy," said the physician kindly,
"but let me tell you this: unless you are able to use a revolver
quicker and better than the other man, it is much better not to
wear one at all. It's just an invitation for trouble."</p>

<p>"That's what my uncle says," said Leslie in a small voice. "Do
you advise me not to wear it at all?"</p>

<p>"Your uncle has sense." The doctor turned his eyes quizzically
on his embarrassed companion. "None of my business," he repeated.
"Needn't incriminate yourself unless you want to, but aren't you
the young man who got into a row with Yankee Sullivan?" He
chuckled. "Well, you certainly are a connoisseur when it comes to
making enemies! I shall follow your career with interest. Now don't
mind me." He laid his hand on Leslie's knee. "As a matter of fact,
I admire your action keenly. But if you really want my advice, I
should say to wear your revolver by all means, but for heaven's
sake, to learn to use it. And until you do, just arrange, if you
can, to keep it out of the way a little. What think?" He cocked his
head side-wise like a bird and laughed. After a moment Leslie, too,
laughed, but reluctantly.</p>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>THE next overnight stop of the stage was at the mission town of
San Juan Bautista. True to the doctor's prediction, Ransom remained
in San Jose, suffering, it was said, from a fever. Leslie did not
see the doctor again. It had not occurred to him to ask the
physician whether his business led him farther than San Jose, and
the stage left early. Leslie regretted this&mdash;as he regretted
missing Djo Burnett&mdash;but only briefly. The day and the country
and the life itself were full of newness and expectation. Both
experiences and impressions succeeded each other so rapidly that
they must be placed on file, so to speak, for later
examination.</p>

<p>At San Juan Bautista, Leslie came for the first time into the
preponderantly Spanish. The sleepy little town clustered about the
plaza, roughly defined by the dilapidatedly picturesque mission
colonnades, the solid square hotel of adobe, and a half-dozen
larger two-storied residences of the same material, with
second-story balconies running across their fronts. The hotel was
thick-walled, dark and cool. The houses were blind and aloof. When
the stage had left the following morning, Leslie was the hotel's
only guest. The dark-skinned people he encountered, some of them in
picturesque costumes that delighted his heart, were courteous
enough, responded sufficiently to his direct salutations, but
dropped it at that. They were as aloof as the houses on the plaza.
Leslie felt himself puzzlingly solitary. He could not realize that
San Juan had from the beginning stood in the direct stream of
passing; that during the brief period while that stream had eddied
with the currents of history every restless adventurer, on both
sides, had passed through its dusty ways. Walker and his Mountain
Men, Castro, the California revolutionists against Micheltorena,
Fremont and his filibusters, and after the Occupation a constant
stream of people of all sorts going to and from Monterey or the
south. San Juan's natural simplicities had curdled. Her people had
become worldly and sophisticated and suspicious of strangers, for
this brief season, before she sank to a forgetfulness which was to
endure until, after many years, the automobile again found her out
and made her known. Leslie's first impressions, then, of the
<i>califor</i><i>nio</i> were thus wide of the fact and in line
with the usual prejudices of his people.</p>

<p>The man to whom he was accredited was a Californian, one Gomez.
He, too, was wholly polite and willing to meet the young man's
wishes, but he went no further than that. He did not go out of his
way to be helpful, nor to correct Leslie's inexperience. Leslie
wanted a horse and information as to routes over the mountains to
the valley of the Salinas. Señor Gomez sold him a horse and showed
him the road over the mountain, adding that he should turn off from
the road and up the valley just after he reached the river. He
showed no surprise that Leslie wanted but one horse. He did not
suggest that the weight of a heavy saddlebag so far back was no fit
burden for a riding animal bound on a long journey. He made no
mention of the short cut of trail across the slow long lacets of
the stage road by which a horseman could save himself time,
distance, and dust. His attitude was passive. It was the same with
the saddler from whom Leslie bought the rest of his equipment. The
picturesqueness of the place had no chance with him. He was glad to
get out as quickly as the slow tempo of the people would permit.
When finally he rode away it was with a sigh of relief and
anticipation.</p>

<p>The mountains immediately back of San Juan were high and rounded
and green, with here and there bold outcroppings of sandstone and
the dark green of chaparral in cleft and cañon fold. As soon as the
little town had dropped from sight, except for the road the country
was a primeval wilderness. To be sure the road was sufficient
witness to the contrary, for it was rutted deep with the passing of
many wheels. But Leslie's youth was quite capable of ignoring a
little thing like that. He was alone: there were no witnesses. He
was able to enjoy to the full the figure he cut to himself, with
his broad flat hat&mdash;bought at San Juan&mdash;and his Colt's
revolving pistol strapped about his waist, and the extraordinary
huge-roweled spurs with their tinkling clappers and low-hanging
chains at his heels, and the smell of fresh leather and its creak
as the horse climbed. He rested his hand on the butt of the Colt's
revolving pistol. He practiced drawing the weapon and aiming at
things. When he camped he intended to do a little target practice.
He spied about him sharply when he happened to think of it, as he
supposed a traveler of the wilderness should, though he was a
trifle vague in his own mind as for what he spied.</p>

<p>The road mounted steadily by a series of long lacets over the
shoulder of the mountain. Leslie followed it conscientiously,
unaware of the short cuts across the lacets for a mounted man. It
was deeply dusty, but cool small breezes and the dampness of the
early-morning air held the dust low and curling along the ground.
The valley below flattened to a pattern, and sister mountains
across its wide expanse arose steadily, keeping pace.</p>

<p>Toward noon he topped the ridge to look down on the Salinas.
Leslie did not know it, but he had made very slow time. He knew
little of the management of a horse on a long journey: the animal
was overburdened with the weights wrongly distributed. If he were
to reach the <i>casa</i> of Juan Bardillo where, according to señor
Gomez, he should spend the night, he must mend his pace. Even
Leslie, looking down at the distance he must go and back at the
distance he had come, realized that. But he did not care. For he
had no intention nor desire to sleep at the <i>casa</i> of Juan
Bardillo. That did not fit the picture at all. From the beginning
he had seen himself at the end of this first day's journey sleeping
under the stars! The sky his roof! His head on his saddle! The
Colt's revolving pistol near his hand! Coyotes on the hill!</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>Youth's ability to ignore what age is pleased to call realities
is one of its great assets. The bivouac under the stars was
eminently successful, with everything as per schedule, including
the coyotes on the hill. There were various things thrown in, such
as unexpected lumpiness and hardness of the ground, ants, wood
ticks, the horse tangling his picket line, a disconcerting aroma
from the saddle blankets Leslie must use as covering, a certain
ineptness in the matter of preparing food, and the like. They but
scratched the surface of his consciousness without immediate
effect.</p>

<p>According to the schedule laid down for him by señor Gomez, he
should by nightfall have reached the mission settlement of Soledad.
That, however, assumed considerable diligence in travel, and also
that he had spent the previous night with Bardillo. Neither of
these things had come off. Indeed Leslie had not passed Bardillo's,
nor crossed the river to the Camino Real at all. He had left the
road and turned up the valley directly at the foot of the
mountains, riding across country. It was much wilder and more
romantic that way, preserved for him the illusion of the untouched
wilderness. He saw no signs of human habitation, unless occasional
bands of long-horned wild-looking cattle might be so considered. On
the other hand, quail, rabbits, and mourning doves swarmed; coyotes
sat on their haunches to stare at him speculatively, their tongues
hanging, drolly like dogs; twice a wildcat scrambled away through
the thin low brush; once, to his great excitement, for he was city
bred, he flushed a deer from the bottom land of a ravine. The
animal was not much alarmed, so it leaped away in a series of
leisurely high bounces, tucking its legs neatly at the top of each
leap, as though suspended from a spiral spring. Leslie half drew
the pistol from its holster but dropped it back, urged to prudence
by a very suspicious slant to his horse's ear. Once he thought he
saw a bear far up the slope of the hill, but he could not be quite
certain. However, the mere chance that it might be a bear was
exciting. The whole journey was eminently satisfactory. Oddly
enough Leslie came the nearest to dissatisfaction over the
red-winged blackbirds and meadowlarks: they were too much like the
blackbirds and meadowlarks he was accustomed to back home. They
somehow diluted the wilderness.</p>

<p>However, by late afternoon the first fine rapture began to wear
just a little thinner. Leslie's objective contemplation of the
appearance he cut was not so absorbing. He knew intimately what he
looked like. The Colt's revolving pistol was very heavy at his
waist, which was natural, for he had strapped it close to his body
instead of allowing it to hang more loosely at his hips. Finally he
took it off and strapped it to his saddle horn. He began to get a
trifle saddle weary, muscle sore from the unaccustomed riding,
chafed on the inside of his knees. He shifted position often. The
sun was powerful. The broken rest of the night before began to
assert itself.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Leslie continued to ride. He had with him
sufficient provision for another night in the open, but the thought
of a bed and a square meal had begun to possess a certain appeal.
Soledad could not be so very much farther. Leslie peered ahead
hopefully from the top of each small crest of the gently rolling
valley, but in vain. He saw the dark high mountains to the south,
the lower grass-grown ranges close to his left hand, the wide
valley between, the wandering green of the river's cottonwoods. The
sun had dipped low, and the young man had begun seriously to
consider another bivouac, when he caught a glimpse of white beyond
live oaks and the red tiles of a roof. An outpost of Soledad at
last, he reflected with satisfaction, and put his tired and
overburdened horse to a jouncing trot.</p>

<p>But as he drew into plainer sight he reined in again.</p>

<p>This was not Soledad, but a solitary small <i>rancho.</i></p>

<p>Leslie debated with himself. He had seen little of the Spanish
Californian. The idle, swaggering, vicious riffraff of the San
Francisco gambling houses plus the aloof and lazy-looking street
loafers at San Juan had given him a bad impression of the race and
had endorsed the loose "shiftless-greaser" talk of the city. He did
not quite know whether he wanted to show himself or not.</p>

<p>The matter was taken out of his decision by the opening of a
door and the shouting of a greeting. He had then, in common
decency, to ride forward.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>Soledad was far, much too far. But no, it must not be thought
of. The <i>caballero</i> must stop the night. <i>Mañana,</i> yes;
<i>mañana,</i> then was time enough for that; and he, Tomas Valdez,
would put the señor on his way.</p>

<p>So Tomas Valdez; and a flood more of musical syllables that
Leslie's slight Spanish could not completely grasp: but the purport
was plain, and the flash of the man's teeth was friendly; and
behind him a comfortably plump woman, with parted blue-black hair
sleek as a seal and wonderful soft eyes, smiled too; and a welter
of small children and lank dogs pressed close behind her; and a
glimpse through the doorway of red flames in the interior's
darkness. Leslie felt suddenly weary and acquiescent. He dismounted
stiffly, lifting his leg above the overstuffed saddlebags only with
the greatest difficulty. Scarcely had he touched foot to ground
before two lads of twelve or fourteen years had taken the horse in
charge. One tossed the heavy stirrup across the saddle, undid the
cinch, whisked the saddle with one deft motion from the horse's
back.</p>

<p>"Ai-ee!" he whistled softly as he felt its weight. He turned,
half carrying, half dragging it through the doorway of the house.
The other boy led away the horse.</p>

<p>"My house and all that it contains is yours," said Tomas Valdez
with a grand flourish.</p>

<p>The interior of the house was bare. The floor was of earth,
watered and beaten hard. Across one corner was a conical-shaped
open fireplace. In another corner was a heap of dried rawhides and
a pile of wheat. In the center of the room stood two benches, one
higher than the other; the higher might have been called a table.
Around the adobe wall had been built, of the same material, a low
shelf or bench which was used, apparently, as a seat or a bed or a
store shelf as need arose. From the heavy beams overhead hung a
guitar, a violin, and strings of bright red peppers.</p>

<p>Leslie took his place at the bench table with Tomas Valdez.
Señora Valdez brought food. The various-sized children sat on the
floor or the adobe shelf and stared avidly.</p>

<p>In every detail of the entertainment of that evening was almost
a poverty of simplicity. Señora Valdez wore merely a white cambric
robe, loosely belted; was without shoes or stockings, without
ornament except for a few silver rings. The very youngest children
wore nothing; the elder girls merely a single garment; the elder
boys, a loose shirt and trousers. Tomas Valdez had, it appeared,
somewhat more pretension to elegance. He had on a loose shirt, a
small sleeveless jacket, <i>calisoneras</i> of cotton velvet,
leggings and shoes of soft leather, but all threadbare and much
worn. The woman served in unglazed earthenware vessels some stewed
jerked meat with chilis, tortillas, and a hot drink resembling
coffee. There was no table furniture, Leslie discovered he must use
his fingers and his knife. He copied his host carefully, and when
he had finished he wiped his knife blade and mopped out the inside
of his bowl with the last of the tortillas, swallowed the latter.
He arose to present the bowl to his hostess.</p>

<p><i>"Muchas gracias, señora,"</i> he pronounced carefully.</p>

<p>The woman's brown face broke into a delightful smile.</p>

<p><i>"Buen' provecho, señor,"</i> she returned.</p>

<p>His hosts piled bright <i>serapes</i> on the adobe shelf for his
seat. Themselves sat at either hand. They talked to him, slowly and
distinctly for his easy comprehension, smiling at him
encouragingly, their manners gentle with an exquisite courtesy.
They asked him no questions about himself, though Valdez was very
inquisitive as to the effect of the new American government, which
he seemed to favor. Or that might be courtesy, reflected
Leslie.</p>

<p>"I like the Americans," said Valdez. "I refused, myself, to join
the revolt."</p>

<p>Especially he and the woman quizzed Leslie as to the effect of
the new dispensation on the prices of the few things they used.</p>

<p>"This," said señora Valdez, fingering her gown, "cost us twelve
dollars."</p>

<p>"That," interposed Valdez, "is eight skins of the cow."</p>

<p>"Do you think that the <i>americanos</i> will sell it more
cheaply?"</p>

<p>Leslie did not know much of such things, but he had seen the
shop windows in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>"I do not know. But in my home such a dress sells for about
three," said he.</p>

<p>"Ai-ee!" cried señora Valdez. "To think of that!"</p>

<p>She disappeared to return immediately with her arms filled. She
waited anxiously for Leslie's appraisal of all the various items of
her meager wardrobe. He guessed rather wildly at some things, it
must be confessed. The señora Valdez clapped her hands, her fine
eyes alight; she was as vivacious as a girl.</p>

<p>"See, Tomas!" she cried. "Soon under the Americans we shall
become <i>hidalgo!"</i></p>

<p>It cost, under the old regime, they both explained together,
upward of two hundred cattle to clothe a man genteelly, just for a
suit of clothes. How much for a suit of clothes in the señor's
country? Leslie did not know.</p>

<p>Americans did not wear the same kind of clothes; sixty dollars,
perhaps.</p>

<p>The two looked at one another, breathless, like children.</p>

<p>"Forty cows!" señora Valdez.</p>

<p>Tomas took down the violin and guitar from the beams overhead.
He and the oldest boy played. They all sang. The instrumental
pieces were lively, always, but the songs were plaintive and
sometimes sad. After a time Tomas conducted Leslie to a smaller
room in which was a low bedframe laced with rawhide thongs. Only by
next morning's daylight did he find out that this was the only
other room of the house and that the couple must have turned over
to him their own sleeping quarters. He accused them of it. They
merely smiled and spread their hands.</p>

<p>The breakfast was a repetition of the supper. Outside Leslie saw
only a conical clay bake oven and extensive corrals of greasewood
stakes. Nothing else. No more possessions. Yet somehow he carried
with him as he rode away an impression of space and magnificence.
He tried to offer money for his entertainment. Tomas Valdez
refused.</p>

<p>"Señor," said he with dignity, "I am not in the habit of selling
food."</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>Somehow the incident was, to Leslie, like the passing through a
door into a new country with new inhabitants. Thenceforward he rode
in Old California as it had always been, and the new febrile order
of things was over the horizon. This was quite as interesting to
his enthusiasms as had been his illusion of wilderness, so he
ceased riding cross country and veered over to the Camino Real,
courting now, rather than avoiding, chance encounters. There was
not much travel along the old highway, but sufficient. He passed an
Indian with bound straight hair driving oxen to a shrieking
<i>carreta</i> piled with hides; a brown-frocked priest on a mule;
two <i>vaqueros</i> with flat glazed hats tied under their chins
and broad leathern leg aprons, who whirled past in charge of a band
of high-headed, wild-looking horses; a gentleman and his lady who
ambled by, <i>paso lento,</i> very gay and gorgeous in silver and
velvet and broadcloth, and the caparisons of their horses tinkling
with silver bells. These all looked at him with veiled curiosity,
for Leslie's appearance and equipment were strange and unreasonable
to them, but they concealed their astonishment gravely and greeted
him with sonorous courtesy: <i>"Buenos dias, señor";</i> and as
they passed, <i>"Vaya con Dios!</i>"</p>

<p>And Leslie recalled what, among other things, the little doctor
at San Jose had told him:</p>

<p>"As soon as you get into the Spanish country you will be
perfectly safe from the road agents. Until then watch out a bit.
There are here and there quite a number of outlaws disguised as
Californians. You can generally be sure of them, for a genuine
native always salutes you and would do so were his hand on the
trigger of his pistol to kill you the next moment."</p>

<p>Leslie became a little self-conscious because of the big Colt's
pistol. He ended by bestowing it in one of the <i>cantinas,</i> out
of sight.</p>

<p>He stopped overnight at the vast and gloomy fortress-like
Mission of Our Lady of Soledad. Like most of the other missions, it
had by now fallen into disrepair, and its ancient wealth was gone.
Nevertheless it was still maintained meagerly as a church. Leslie
was given a bare clean room in the guest wing, was fed in the
silent refectory, and was blessed at his departure. Except at the
meal and at arrival and departure, he had no company. The two
priests had business of their own, and the Indian servant who
attended his few wants made him no answers. Little bells tinkled,
and at vespers the great bells in the tower spoke. Leslie slipped
into the dimness of the church, partly from a sense of fitting
courtesy, partly from curiosity. The last light of day slanted
milky from windows high up near the roof; candle flames in galaxy
glorified the altar; sweet-smelling smoke eddied; on the high walls
were crude paintings of sinners waist deep in hell flames; a scant
dozen dark figures kneeled. That night Leslie lay for some time
flat on his back, staring straight up into the blackness of his
cell. About him was a comfortable peace like the waters of a bath.
He heard a rapid, soft-voiced little owl repeating something
breathlessly and a commanding hollow-voiced big owl telling the
world of night. Some small metronomic insect went
<i>tick-tick-tick</i> in the beams overhead. A far bell tinkling
attested a ceaseless vigilance against the powers of darkness.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>Chapter 4</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>BOTH Leslie and his much-tried horse left Soledad quite made
over to a new and strange and delightful world. Here, too, offer of
payment had been refused, but Leslie had caught sight of a
contribution box by the door of the church, and his conscience was
clear. In addition to a Latin blessing, he had received at parting
a provision of food and minute directions as to the next stage of
his journey, which was to the Mission of St. Anthony of Padua on
the plateau of Jolon. The <i>hacienda</i> of Don Jose Constansio,
to whom he was accredited, lay but a few leagues beyond. There was
no reason, said Father Feria, why he should not, with proper
diligence, reach the mission by night, and his destination the
following day.</p>

<p>Leslie thanked him kindly and rode away. He had, however, no
intention of using proper diligence. The two nights' sound rest had
so refreshed him that the under-the-stars, open-sky-for-his-roof
appeal had revived.</p>

<p>So now he rode slowly and stopped frequently and looked about
him from a center of vast leisure on the varied phenomena of an
interesting world. Much of it was wholly strange and, therefore,
romantic. The increasing abundance of stately and soaring eagles,
for one thing. Leslie had not yet been told the birds were in
reality buzzards, so they did well enough for the purpose. Then
there were spiders, unbelievably large, with hairy bodies, that
teetered up and down on their legs as though about to spring. And
iridescent lizards like jewels that made him quaint little bows.
And a flat, wide reptile that looked as though it had swallowed a
particularly spiky rosebush and the thorns had come out through its
hide. And scorpions. And magpies. These were all, to Leslie,
exotics. He experienced, on beholding them, the same thrill of the
unbelievable he had felt at sight of his first orange tree or his
first fresh figs. There is a certain opening of the doors of
consciousness when we encounter face to face what has been only a
legend. So Leslie rode that day in a constantly mounting delight,
not only in the rising green country of hills and spaced dark oaks,
but in the numbers of little things the simplicity of that country
contained. His appreciations were heightened by this quickening of
consciousness. He expanded and soaked up and had a grand time.</p>

<p>His horse suddenly leaped sideways, shaking him loose in the
saddle. This was a curious enough phenomenon, for the horse was by
now somewhat subdued by its troubles. Leslie saw something
wriggling away through the grass. He looked closer. There was no
doubt of it! A rattlesnake! In person!</p>

<p>He scrambled from the saddle, hastily tied the animal to the
nearest willow bush, gave pursuit. He wanted that snake's skin on
his hat. But by this time the reptile had disappeared.</p>

<p>Leslie was recalled from eager but cautious search by a snort.
He looked up to confront a wide-horned steer trotting toward him
from the brush. The beast's head was high and swinging from side to
side; its eye was rolling, wild but foolish. Leslie waved his hat
and shouted. The beast snorted again, stopped short. After a moment
it advanced again, nor did another shout nor the stone Leslie cast
in its direction have any other effect than to check its pace
slightly.</p>

<p>Leslie, though city bred, as cities went nearly a hundred years
ago, knew cows well enough back East, where he came from; and it
did not yet occur to him that his predicament was anything but
annoying. Even when the brute lowered its horns and rushed at him
and he was forced to dodge, his emotion was of indignation at
stupidity. But when the steer turned to come again, with every
indication of serious and purposeful business, Leslie suddenly
realized he was in a fix.</p>

<p>The next two or three minutes hammered into him just how serious
that fix was. By continued shouting, leaping about, and casting of
stones and clods of earth he could for a little time hold the
beast, if not at bay, at least in a condition of dull uncertainty.
But sooner or later its tail lashed, down went its head, and at him
it came, full tilt in a short purposeful rush which he but just
managed to evade. He tried to edge over toward a tree but instantly
discovered that the least yielding brought an instant charge. He
wished he had the Colt's revolving pistol. He wished his horse were
nearer; He wondered how long the fool animal would keep this up.
The consequences of a stumble or a fall tightened his muscles. He
was hot, and his breath was beginning to come short. But as yet no
real fear of the outcome had crossed his mind. That came when, in a
pause of this absurd game, he looked beyond his antagonist and saw
more cattle, a great ring of them, just at the edge of the brush
that bordered the meadow. They were staring at the strange
performance taking place out there in the open, making up their
slow minds as to what it was all about, but avidly curious. They
stood motionless, held by this indecision; but the thought came to
Leslie, like a cold blade through his chest, that once their
stupidity was focused he was as surely doomed as though he stood on
the roof of a burning building. Only there would be some sense and
fitness in the danger of such a predicament, and it could be
accepted with a due sense of tragedy; but in this there was none.
But he knew desperately that unless he did something within the
next minute or so to escape this one animal, he had no chance at
all to escape the many.</p>

<p>He remembered the little double-barreled derringer, which he had
bestowed in a pocket, and produced it and took careful aim and
popped it off. Leslie could not expect the tiny bullets to take any
serious effect, but he had a faint hope their sting might
discourage the steer's tenacity. If they hit, which he seriously
doubted, they had no effect; nor did the explosions accomplish
anything. Except that the ring of cattle at the meadow's edge
stirred slightly and two or three made tentative steps forward.
Leslie tightened his muscles for a dash toward safety. It would be
a forlorn chance: he was almost certain to be overtaken and
trampled down, but he must take it. Curiously enough a wave of rage
overwhelmed him that he should meet his end ridiculously.</p>

<p>But at this moment a rider thrust from the brush screen at his
left and loped easily across the meadow. The steer rolled its
bloodshot eyes and shook its head slowly from side to side.</p>

<p>Leslie saw that the rider was a girl.</p>

<p><i>"Guardarse!"</i> he cried in warning. <i>"El</i> <i>toro e
barbaro!"</i></p>

<p>He could not for the life of him summon the Spanish word for
"dangerous."</p>

<p>She did not even glance in his direction. Quite unhurriedly she
cantered directly at the steer. The brute stared, holding its
ground more in the slow stupidity of changing ideas than in
defiance. The girl flicked the end of her romal in the animal's
face.</p>

<p><i>"Holá!"</i> she cried sharply.</p>

<p>Overcome by the sudden panic of its race&mdash;long subservience
to the mounted man, the steer abruptly whirled and lumbered away.
She watched it thoughtfully, then, as though seized by a sudden
impulse, she leaned forward in her saddle and spoke sharply to her
horse.</p>

<p>The steer, running swiftly, had by now almost reached his
companions at the brush edge. But in a dozen leaps the horse was
alongside. Its rider leaned from her saddle in a long graceful
sweep, caught the steer's tail. The horse, without command, sprang
forward violently. The intended maneuver, had Leslie known it, was
the <i>colliar.</i> Its suddenness, combined with a certain
deftness in the application of the power, should have turned the
steer end for end, to his great discomfiture and his edification as
to his proper place in the scheme of things. But the beast was much
too heavy for the girl's strength. She hung on until she was almost
dragged from the saddle before, with a cry of vexation, she was
forced to let go. The steer was slewed only slightly sidewise, but
as it bawled loudly with terror, possibly the ends of the
<i>colliar</i> were subserved. She straightened in her saddle and
rode away without a backward glance.</p>

<p>Leslie watched all this with openmouthed astonishment. Only when
the beautiful golden bay animal and the slim straight figure of its
rider were fairly at the point of disappearance in the chaparral
did he come to himself in the realization that his rescuer actually
intended to ride off thus without a word.</p>

<p>"Hey!" he yelled as a stopgap in his frantic search for Spanish.
<i>"Señorita!</i> <i>S'il</i> <i>vous</i> <i>plait&mdash;</i>damn
it, that's French! O hell and blazes! <i>Volver usted!"</i></p>

<p>The horse stopped short, but its rider did not turn.</p>

<p>Leslie collected himself, uttered a more grammatically correct
plea. Slowly the horse wheeled, paced steadily across the carpet of
flowers.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>Leslie had leisure to see that his rescuer was a young
girl&mdash;hardly more than a child, he would have said had he
himself been older. She rode a very fine golden bay whose skin
rippled and shone in the sunlight, molding the muscles and the
network of veins like gold leaf. A headstall of silver plates and
<i>conchas</i> and a saddle carved and ornamented would have
merited attention&mdash;at another time. It was a man's saddle, and
the girl rode it astride. Her hat also was a man's hat, tied under
her chin by a thong. Her costume was of red and the blue of lupins;
red above and blue in a sort of divided skirt below. Leslie did not
know it, of course, but in such a rig-out on a proper
<i>doncellita</i> of the period he was looking upon something quite
as revolutionary as Bunker Hill. Of this privilege, however, he was
blandly ignorant. He knew only that this was a very good-looking
young lady and that she was staring at him with what seemed to be
grave and steady disapproval. To his smile she made no response,
but waited, from that elevation of superiority one mounted
possesses over one on foot, for what he might say.</p>

<p>"I could not allow you to go away without thanking you," he
ventured in his halting Spanish.</p>

<p><i>"No</i> <i>ay</i> <i>de qui,"</i> she disclaimed briefly and
continued to wait.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I would not make a very good bullfighter, not a
good <i>matador."</i></p>

<p>She continued to look down on him coolly.</p>

<p>Leslie realized quite well the ridiculous figure he must have
cut in the eyes of this very competent young person to whom
man-eating cows were nothing. Nevertheless, ridiculous or not, he
knew well she had saved him from death, and he was determined to
jar her out of this inhuman aloofness, to make her know that he
understood this fact. He tried to tell her so, and especially to
express admiration for her handling of the belligerent steer. Her
face flushed slightly under its olive pallor. Her eyes lost none of
their steadiness, but they glinted with an anger Leslie could not
mistake. He was bewildered. He knew nothing of the <i>colliar</i>
and could not guess her failure, nor her secret mortification. He
wondered what he could have said; in what manner the strange
language had betrayed him.</p>

<p>She looked away at last. Some of the cattle were again venturing
from the chaparral.</p>

<p>"I think," said she, "you'd better get hold of your horse,
before you get into any more trouble."</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" cried Leslie when he had managed to shut his mouth.
"You speak English!"</p>

<p>"And why not?" she demanded haughtily.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;no reason&mdash;except that it is rather
unexpected&mdash;back here so far&mdash;a Spanish girl," Leslie
stammered, taken aback by her prickly challenge. He recovered
himself. "Look here, now that I can talk without thinking of a
dictionary, I want to tell you that I know that you came along just
in time to save my life, and I'm no end grateful. It was silly of
me to get into such a fix, I suppose, but I didn't know anything
about your confounded cattle and their silly customs. I'm new to
the country." A new thought crossed his mind. "Are you
understanding me?" he asked.</p>

<p>Leslie received an instant impression that if the girl had not
been mounted, she would have stamped her foot.</p>

<p>"Will you tell me," she said in the tone of exasperation, "what
there is about what you are saying that I could not understand? Of
course you are new to the country, and of course you are foolish.
Otherwise you would not go on foot where there are cattle."</p>

<p>Leslie remembered the little derringer pistol that he still held
in his hand.</p>

<p>"Are these your cattle? Do you live here?" he asked on a sudden
thought. "I do not think I hurt the beast; I do not think I hit it
at all."</p>

<p>She dismissed the matter with a wave of the hand. She was
examining him steadily, making up her mind about something, Leslie
could see. Her eyes strayed to his meekly patient horse that stood,
ears drooped, one hind foot tucked up, hoping for the best. They
rested on the beast for some moments, taking in every detail of its
equipment, the bulky <i>cantinas</i> over the horn, the stuffed
saddlebags behind the cantle. Here, said they&mdash;could Leslie
have read them&mdash;is probably as complete a greenhorn as ever
rode abroad in Alta California. Not only does he go about among
wild cattle on foot, where only a mounted man is safe, but also he
ties his horse by the bridle reins, and he loads a heavy weight
behind the saddle where it will most certainly result in a sore
back. It is probable that he knows nothing about the
<i>colliar,</i> and therefore he was not making fun of my failure
to execute it properly.</p>

<p>Leslie could not read all that, but he read well enough the
change of mood, and he responded to it with all the cheerful
abandon of a puppy. With a sure instinct, how-ever, he carefully
repressed all evidences of joy beneath a sudden formal
correctness.</p>

<p>"My name, señorita&mdash;" he bowed, "is Leslie Dayton, and I am
journeying to the <i>rancho</i> of Don Jose Constansio."</p>

<p>"Señor," she murmured in acknowledgment.</p>

<p>"And you?" he hinted, as she did not immediately reciprocate but
appeared to consider some inner problem.</p>

<p>She recollected herself with a start.</p>

<p>"I? Your pardon, señor. I am the Doña Amata of the <i>rancho</i>
of Folded Hills. And this," she added gravely, "is Pronto, who is
quite the best horse in the world." Pronto, undoubtedly in response
to some touch of heel or other signal which Leslie did not see,
bent one knee, lowered his glossy head, and sank into a half
obeisance. She broke into a gurgle of delighted laughter. It came
to Leslie suddenly that she was indeed a child. Or was she? She was
very puzzling.</p>

<p>She gathered up the reins and turned Pronto's head.</p>

<p>"Come," she ordered with decision. "Oh, the
<i>p</i><i>obrecito!"</i> she cried of Leslie's dejected
animal.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" he asked in all innocence.</p>

<p>He received a severe small lecture.</p>

<p>"I didn't know," he said contritely. "I'll get another
horse."</p>

<p>He had a brilliant idea.</p>

<p>"Can't I buy one at your place?" he asked. "How far away is it?"
He caught the recoil of doubt. "Come on," he pleaded; "anyway it's
a long way to San Antonio yet. I ought not to try&mdash;now should
I?&mdash;with that horse; and anyway how about all this California
hospitality they talk so much about? Are you going to let the
stranger pass right by your very doorstep without asking
him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop! Stop!" She covered her ears with her gauntleted hands.
"So many words! You do not understand! How would it look; what
would <i>mi madre</i> say that I should speak to a young man, a
stranger? And if I bring him with me&mdash;no! No, no!" In her
excitement she became Latin for the first time. "And
besides&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes? Besides?" prompted Leslie as she hesitated.</p>

<p>She flushed faintly, glanced down.</p>

<p>"My costume, my saddle. That would be a scandal."</p>

<p>"What's the matter with it? It's a very pretty costume, a very
fine saddle."</p>

<p>Leslie learned that ladies did not ride astride; that the Doña
Amata was already somewhat of a scandal to <i>"mi madre"</i> and
one Vicenta because she continued to do so so late in life, even
though the shame were performed only in the supposed strict privacy
of the fifty-odd thousand acres of Folded Hills. "Though," added
Amata in aside, "my father only laughs." If she were now to appear
openly, riding with a strange young man...</p>

<p>"But if your father only laughs," urged Leslie, "and after all,
you can sort of <i>bring</i> me in, can't you?"</p>

<p>"But <i>mi madre</i>..." The girl bit her lip in hesitation.</p>

<p>"Mothers," said Leslie confidently, "are my specialty."</p>

<p>He composed his face to an incredible wide-eyed innocence.</p>

<p>"Señora, I have come to pay my respects in gratitude to your
daughter who has, in the goodness of her heart, rescued me from an
untimely and disagreeable fate. She did this against all her better
inclinations, much as one would pick a skunk out of a mud hole,
actuated only by her good heart which, señora, she undoubtedly
inherited from you. Hold on!" He broke off in alarm. "Does your
mother understand English?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course she does!" cried the Doña Amata indignantly.</p>

<p>"That's good. I'm not at my best in Spanish. Well, and so forth
and so on. I'll handle your mother. Don't you worry about her. I'm
a lot more scared of your father&mdash;even if he does laugh,
You're sure he doesn't bite?"</p>

<p>"Doesn't bite!" the girl repeated and gurgled deliciously. "You
say funny things."</p>

<p>"They'd be a lot funnier in Spanish," stated Leslie confidently.
"Do I have to talk Spanish to your father?"</p>

<p>"My father!" She widened her eyes in amazement. "Talk Spanish?
To my father? Why, my father is <i>americano!"</i></p>

<p>Leslie struck his forehead in mock vexation. "The poor dumb
fish!" he cried.</p>

<p>"What is it?" She leaned down from her saddle in puzzled
alarm.</p>

<p>"You talk English without an accent&mdash;beautiful English,"
said Leslie reproachfully. "You live in the Salinas valley&mdash;on
a <i>rancho.</i> What did you say is the name of the
<i>rancho?"</i></p>

<p>"Folded Hills." She stated at him, puzzled.</p>

<p>"Of course. And your father is an American. All laid out in
front of one, plain as print! And I've just guessed it! Young
woman"&mdash;he raised a forefinger as though in
accusation&mdash;"your name is Burnett, and you have a brother
named Djo."</p>

<p>"For sure." Her voice was wondering. "Did I not tell you
that?"</p>

<p>"You did not!"</p>

<p>"But you asked, and I did tell you my name."</p>

<p>"You said your name is Amata&mdash;which is a very good
name&mdash;and you quit at that."</p>

<p>"That was stupid," she acknowledged. "Such is the Spanish custom
to name one's name thus."</p>

<p>"George, rex," said Leslie.</p>

<p>"What?" She knit her brows.</p>

<p>"Nothing. But such being the case&mdash;that you are Djo's
sister, I mean&mdash;the goose hangs high. You see, Djo is a friend
of mine."</p>

<p>She looked at him doubtfully.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" he asked. "Don't you believe it? Djo will
know me."</p>

<p>"Djo is at Monterey."</p>

<p>"That's too bad. I'd like to see him."</p>

<p>"And if he comes back and finds you here&mdash;as his
friend&mdash;" She hesitated, flushing. "I do not like troubles,"
she said with simple dignity.</p>

<p>Leslie threw back his head and roared with delighted laughter.
She looked at him doubtfully, broke into a reluctant smile.</p>

<p>"But I <i>do</i> know him," choked Leslie at last. "Honest
Injun, cross my heart, hope to die! And I hope he does come back
from Monterey!"</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>When the two surmounted the hill and looked down into the valley
where was located the <i>casa</i> of the ranch, Leslie drew rein
with a whistle of surprise.</p>

<p>"Golly!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Directly below them the fields of the valley were green with
ripening crops of wheat and barley. At the far side of the flats
were wide patches of garden<i>&mdash;milpas&mdash;</i>and orderly
rows of fruit trees. On the slopes sprawled the spring shoots of an
extensive vineyard. A meandering line of green trees marked a
watercourse. At the upper end of the valley was a whole series of
corrals and chutes of all sizes, indicative of the <i>rancho's</i>
major industry. Beyond them, on the upper grassy slope, grazed a
band of horses.</p>

<p>Across the way, nestled comfortably between two huge live-oak
trees, was a long, low white structure with a red-tiled roof. It
occupied the whole top of a knoll. Falling away from it on the
descending slope were innumerable other buildings of various sizes,
scattered apparently at haphazard, until, in a lesser flat a few
hundred yards distant, they clustered into a certain loose
semblance of a village.</p>

<p>Leslie looked toward the girl, impressed. Her slight figure
stood upright in the stirrups; her head was back; her eyes and
nostrils were wide with an obvious pride.</p>

<p>"Folded Hills <i>rancho,"</i> she said simply.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>Chapter 5</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>THEY RODE down into the flat of the valley and across it and up
the gentle slope to the great live-oak trees. Here they drew rein.
The girl cried out sharply, and after a few moments an Indian
<i>mozo</i> sauntered around the grape arbor and took the horses.
In the man's face was no expression, but his black eyes were alight
with curiosity. Without apparent movement their glance roved over
every detail of the young man's appearance and equipment, and a
certain faint astonishment grew in their depths. Of this the Doña
Amata was well enough aware, and her head went up.</p>

<p>"Is Don Andreo in the <i>casa?"</i> she demanded
imperiously.</p>

<p>"The Don Andreo rides, señorita." The <i>mozo</i> hesitated.
"The señor's luggage?" he inquired. "In the west room?"</p>

<p>"Leave it here," commanded the girl, "under the oak. Come!
Hasten!"</p>

<p>The <i>mozo</i> unstrapped, the <i>cantinas,</i> the saddlebags,
deposited them under the oak, led the horses away at a brisk pace.
The girl looked after him and laughed.</p>

<p>"I must go find <i>Mama</i> at once; for quick, like that!" she
snapped her fingers. "This news will be brought to her, and I must
see her first. Will you wait? I shall not be long. Will you come
into the <i>casa?"</i></p>

<p>"I think I would like to wait here, if you don't mind," said
Leslie.</p>

<p>He watched her slender figure until it had disappeared through
the cavernous doorway between incredibly tall hollyhocks. She moved
lightly and gracefully, as he would expect. Two benches stood under
the nearer of the great oaks. He sat down on one of them and took
off his hat.</p>

<p>It was very pleasant in the cool of shade after the ardent
sunshine. A breeze lifted his hair. Small busy birds searched the
foliage of the wide-flung branches and talked in confidential
twitters of their own world in which he had little part. Concealed
in the top, a dove mourned softly over and over. From the drench of
sunshine outside came other, warmed sounds of quail and meadowlark,
of voices muted by distance, a sharp tinkle of something metal
falling, a far-off repeated bellowing of cattle. These sounds were
busy, but here in the somnolent shade of the tree was only a soft
and droning quietude. Leslie fell under its spell. He was quite
content to wait. His eyes wandered with a lazy and sensuous
appreciation over the bright tall flowers of the garden strip along
the walls of the <i>casa</i> and the shadows they cast against the
white. His nostrils expanded to their faint perfume mingled with an
equally faint tang of wood smoke. The house spread out so
comfortably, as though relaxing against the earth. Leslie's own
eyes drooped; his head nodded.</p>

<p>An earthen jar suspended from a limb by a thong of rawhide swung
and turned slowly. Its surface was bedewed with moisture. To avoid
falling asleep Leslie arose idly to investigate it. Its mouth was
closed by a wooden cover. On the cover was a cup. Leslie drank of
the water it contained and was astounded to find it cold as
ice.</p>

<p>He sat down again. Amata was a long time in finding her mother;
or perhaps, Leslie reflected with a grin, in making her peace. He
hoped there was no trouble. Why should there be? But he knew
nothing of these Spanish people, except that he had heard they were
very strict and punctilious. But these weren't Spanish people. Or
were they? In ideas, that is. I'd like mighty well to stay here,
reflected Leslie. It is restful. And beautiful. I'd like to see Djo
again. I liked Djo. Funny way to spell Joe. His thoughts for some
reason avoided the girl, glancing at her only obliquely, as it
were. He spared a passing speculation as to her age. You couldn't
tell a thing, the way she was dressed. There were rare odd moments
when somehow she gave the impression of being nothing but a little
girl.</p>

<p>Leslie heard the sound of hoofs and looked up. In his inner
absorption the horsemen had ridden up the hill unnoticed and were
now close upon him. The one slightly in advance was to Leslie's
boyish eyes a splendid figure of a man. Certainly he was splendidly
mounted. The beast he rode was above the average of size for the
country, of a light chestnut in color. Its mane and tail were long
and silky and had overnight been so tightly braided that now they
flashed in deep ripples that caught the light. The animal's
forehead was wide, its eyes intelligent; its wide-spread nostrils
showed pink as the light shone through them. It stepped daintily,
as though in pride.</p>

<p>The harness was befitting such a creature. The bridle and reins
were of plaited rawhide, the crossing of the straps marked by
silver <i>conchas.</i> The broad sides of the spade bit were silver
inlaid and engraved; silver chains connected it with the reins. The
saddle rested on a gaudy Indian blanket. It was a massive affair,
with a high, wide pommel and broad skirts, the leather deeply and
beautifully tooled, the corners silvered. The leathern stirrup
hoods were extended downward in long
points<i>&mdash;tapaderos&mdash;</i>that all but touched the
ground.</p>

<p>Magnificent a show as all this presented, Leslie's attention
lingered on it but a moment. The man dominated it, compelled his
first interest. He was tall, spare rather than slender. Except for
the wide hat and the big-roweled spurs, he was dressed soberly in
American costume. He sat very straight in his saddle, his legs
fully extended and well beneath him. His body was supple, moved in
response to every slight movement of the horse. His face was lean
and set in lines of determination. His eyes were of a clear hard
gray, and above them the brows almost met in a straight line. This
assured the resemblance, so that Leslie knew he saw Djo's
father&mdash;and, incidentally, the father of the girl.</p>

<p>So wholly was his interest focused on this man that for several
paces of the advance he did not look at the other two riders. When
he did finally turn his eyes to them, surprise brought him to his
feet. One was a <i>vaquero</i> of late middle age. The third
horseman was the man named Ransom, the loud-mouthed bullying
desperado with whom Djo Burnett had clashed on the stage journey to
San Jose.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>Leslie moved out of sight behind the bole of the live-oak tree.
He needed a moment to recall his scattered wits before confronting
the man. What was he after here? Djo? That was not reasonable: he
would hardly have ridden in alone and so openly if he had been on
any errand of ordinary personal revenge. It was ridiculous to
suppose that he had come thus far to complain of Djo to his father,
as one who complains of a small boy who steals his apples. It was
equally ridiculous that, in view of what had passed, he should
suppose himself welcome here on any basis.</p>

<p>Unless he knew that Djo was still at Monterey.</p>

<p>Leslie's young imagination quickened. What then?</p>

<p>What was he up to? What did he hope to accomplish here while Djo
was still away? While he still remained unknown? Something deep and
dastardly and revengeful, without doubt. Worm his way into the
<i>ranchero's</i> confidence, so that when the time came...The plot
became a trifle hazy at this point, but one fact stuck solidly
enough: here was he, Leslie, to step forth dramatically in
confrontation when the time came. If the man's dark plots needed
anonymity, he had another guess coming. Leslie listened
shamelessly.</p>

<p>However, the first exchange he heard, after the men had
dismounted, rather knocked the props from under part of the theory.
If Ransom intended to worm his way into the <i>ranchero's</i>
confidence, he made a bad start. His manner was almost arrogantly
confident. He produced from an inside pocket an envelope containing
a number of papers. He selected and unfolded one, referred to it as
though to refresh his memory.</p>

<p>"You acknowledge yourself then as Andrew Burnett?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>Andy surveyed him from beneath frowning brows.</p>

<p>"I am Andrew Burnett, as I told you," he answered at last.</p>

<p>"You lay claim," continued Ransom, again referring to the
document in his hand, "to that piece of land designated as Folded
Hills <i>rancho</i> comprising eleven leagues <i>'poco mas o
meno'?"</i></p>

<p>"I own Folded Hills ranch," said Andy curtly. His lips were
compressed, his eyes wary.</p>

<p>Ransom restored the papers to his pocket.</p>

<p>"You will produce your title papers and your <i>diseño,"</i>
said he, "and will designate someone&mdash;or come
yourself&mdash;as my assistant to identify the boundary marks."</p>

<p>The tall <i>ranchero</i> sauntered to the nearest bench and sat
down.</p>

<p>"Why should I do this?" he asked at length.</p>

<p>"I am a United States officer," stated Ransom irnportantly.</p>

<p>Andy nodded: "I guessed that. Though I'll let you show me. What
I asked you is why I'm to do these things? What's the idea?"</p>

<p>"Checking your title. If it's good, you got nothing to get
skeered of. If it ain't, the gov'ment wants to know it. There's
aplenty wants land," he ended significantly.</p>

<p>Andy remained silent, pondering. The other watched him, a slight
sneer on his lips.</p>

<p>"There's no use bucking the gov'ment, if that's what you're
thinking of."</p>

<p>"I'm not thinking of bucking the government," said Andy, "but I
want to get this straight."</p>

<p>Leslie stepped from his concealment behind the tree. "How are
you, Ransom?" he said coolly. "Didn't expect to see you here.
You're too late. I'm doing this job."</p>

<p>His voice was without tremor, but his heart was jumping with the
excitement of his inspiration and the course he must hold. He was
conscious of the <i>ranchero's</i> steady tight-lipped scrutiny. He
threw at Andy a smile that he tried to make at once one of amused
and shrewd understanding and an appeal for discretion. This was
rather complicated. But as Andy still said nothing, Leslie plucked
up heart.</p>

<p>Ransom, on the contrary, was vocal enough.</p>

<p>"You!" he cried. "For God's sake! How did <i>you</i> get
here!"</p>

<p>"You're too late," repeated Leslie. "I'm doing this job." He
spoke quickly: he must get on before the <i>ranchero</i> might say
something. "I'm nearly finished."</p>

<p>"What are you driveling about now?" Ransom caught his
breath.</p>

<p>"I, too," said Leslie grandly, "am a Federal Land
Inspector."</p>

<p>It was a great moment, but still perilous with possibilities;
and Leslie's artistic perception felt somehow that the method of
his disclosure smacked perhaps too strongly of the theatrical.
Nevertheless it was effective. Andy Burnett's lips closed in a
straight line; his eyes moved sharply from one to the other; he
waited, saying nothing.</p>

<p>"The hell you are!" said Ransom contemptuously.</p>

<p>Leslie unstrapped his saddlebags, produced his commission with
the red seal, thrust it under Ransom's nose. The latter's eyes
opened wide with surprise. However, he brushed its importance aside
with a contemptuous gesture.</p>

<p>"I got orders to examine this title, and I'm going to do it,"
said he. "I don't know how you got a hold of that appointment, and
I don't care. I been in this business too long to bother about no
young whippersnapper like you are. Who told you to come here,
anyway? I'll take this over. You can give me what you've done. Or,"
he ended violently, "you can go to hell. Anyway, get out!"</p>

<p>His face was red and congested; his hand strayed, a little
stiffly, toward the butt of his weapon. Leslie found leisure for a
brief regret that the Colt's revolving pistol was in the
<i>cantinas</i> and the derringer in his pocket empty. But he did
not recede, and indeed his fears would have been groundless, for
Ransom's movement was purely instinctive. He was angry enough, but
he knew better than to start a gunplay on a lone hand.</p>

<p>"You are not my superior," he told Ransom bluntly. "You cannot
give me orders."</p>

<p>The disputants turned at the sound of Andy's voice.</p>

<p>To Leslie's surprise the <i>ranchero's</i> eyes were twinkling
with amusement.</p>

<p>"That'll be about all, Ransom&mdash;if that's your name," he
drawled. "This young man says he's nigh finished with the job.
That's fast workin'. I like fast work. I'm satisfied."</p>

<p>He arose with an air of finality.</p>

<p>"You deny a gov'ment officer?" cried Ransom, beside himself.</p>

<p>"Why, no"&mdash;Andy opened his eyes mildly&mdash;"but I've
<i>got</i> me a government officer. I don't have to have two, do
I?" His voice took on an edge; his tall form straightened. "Or do
I? How about that, young man? You tell me."</p>

<p>"No," said Leslie boldly. "This man has no standing!"</p>

<p>"Why, you&mdash;" burst out Ransom. He gave it up and turned on
Andy. "Look here, I've got orders, definite orders, I tell you, to
examine this title, and I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There's your hoss," interrupted Andy bluntly. "I never aimed to
turn a man from Folded Hills without feeding him, but, Ransom, I
don't like your face, or your manners, or anything about you." The
man broke in with something about Federal officers and authority.
"I don't know anything about that," said Andy with finality, "but
when I got two of these yere Federal officers, and one says one
thing, and t'other says another, I'm going to pick me the one I
want to believe. It ain't you. Vamoose!"</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>Beaming with pleasure that his inspiration had worked out so
well and that the <i>ranchero</i> had not given the show away by
ill-timed remarks, Leslie was stopped short in his tracks by Andy's
cold eye fixed on him.</p>

<p>"Now, young man," said Andy, "who are you, and what are you
doing here?"</p>

<p>And indeed the question was only reasonable, as Leslie realized.
He named himself, began some explanation of his presence, somewhat
confused in that belatedly it occurred to him, when he was in the
middle of it, that he was not sure how much of Amata's part in it
he should tell. But apparently all this was unimportant to the
<i>ranchero.</i> He brushed it aside.</p>

<p>"What is all this land business?" he demanded. "What is there in
Folded Hills that needs investigation?"</p>

<p>He listened attentively and without interruption to Leslie's
reply, which was succinct and straightforward, for here the young
man was on the sure ground of his preparation before leaving San
Francisco. Leslie was delighted to speak his piece with the
authority of that preparation, for somehow it raised his stature
before this man whom already he admired.</p>

<p>The titles to land in California, Leslie explained, under the
Spanish and Mexicans were of many sorts, some of them
good&mdash;most of them good. But a great many of them were vague;
needed defining. And a great many more were frankly bad: grants
made by the <i>politicos</i> corruptly and illegally. A few had
even been found to be forged or antedated. This made so much
confusion that the government had decreed that every claimant under
a Spanish or Mexican title must validate his title; and for that
reason every <i>rancho&mdash;</i>not merely Folded Hills&mdash;must
be inspected and passed by a commission. Any grants not so
confirmed became part of the public domain.</p>

<p>"I've heard nothing of this," said Andy. "But then," he added,
"I have taken no part in affairs since the Occupation." He was
thoughtful for a moment. "Why did you lie to that man?" he asked
abruptly, and with a snap of sternness.</p>

<p>"Lie?" stammered Leslie, taken aback.</p>

<p>"You told him you were doing this job, that it was almost
finished. That was not true, Why?"</p>

<p>Leslie recovered himself. He looked straight into Andy's eyes,
and his own slowly crinkled in an engaging smile.</p>

<p>"Why did you agree with me, sir?" he asked with entire
respect.</p>

<p>Andy stared for a moment, then laughed shortly, but with genuine
appreciation. His manner changed. His long form relaxed; he
stretched out his legs lazily.</p>

<p>"Reckon you got me there, bub," he acknowledged. His voice had
resumed its lazy drawl. "I'll tell you. I followed your play
because I liked your looks, and I didn't like the looks of this
other feller. But I didn't know what your play was, and I don't
now, and I think you'd better tell me. Don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Leslie. "You see, sir, I was going up beyond
St. Anthony of Padua to a <i>rancho</i> belonging to a señor
Constansio."</p>

<p>"A mite off your route here," pointed out Andy.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir." Leslie passed that by and hurried on. "I was waiting
here when you came up. I couldn't help hearing what that man said
to you. I'd seen him before, but I didn't know that he was a
government agent. But I remembered what I'd heard another man say
to him when they were talking about squatter
troubles&mdash;something about how much land would he need for his
next gang&mdash;and all of a sudden it came to me how easy it would
be for him to put in a report that would make trouble or fix it so
the claim, or maybe only a part of it, would be rejected, and
so&mdash;don't you see how easy it would be? Especially if someone
was backing him among these new settlers, and&mdash;" The words
were tumbling over one another in his eagerness. Andy was watching
him intently.</p>

<p>"Hold on"&mdash;his cool tones interrupted the
torrent&mdash;"you're going too fast. You think this man, Ransom,
might be playing cahoots with somebody to get a hold of my land? Is
that it?" He chuckled at Leslie's assent. "Of course they'd always
have to come and <i>git</i> it." His lips set tight for a moment,
but instantly relaxed to amusement again. "And where do you come
in?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Why"&mdash;Leslie was thrown off his stride&mdash;"why, I
thought, that maybe if we got rid of him that-that I&mdash;" He
floundered. Of a sudden it was not very clear even to him. He
reddened but held his ground. "It sounds pretty impudent, sir," he
said stoutly, "but somebody's got to do it&mdash;that's the new
law&mdash;and I thought that perhaps I could at least send in an
honest report, and I don't believe this man would."</p>

<p>He was aware of Andy's grave scrutiny.</p>

<p>"I'm an old Mountain Man," said the latter after a moment, "and
I like to read my sign clear. And there's two things I don't quite
<i>sabe.</i> If things are like you say, why should this man come
way out here, leagues from nowhere, to get him his land for his
gang, as you call em, when there's land aplenty nearer home? That's
one. And t'other is, how does it come you're so all-fired anxious
to horn in on a total stranger that is nothing to you? And I've got
yet to hear why you're right here so pat, two leagues off your
route&mdash;ef'n you're really headed for Constansio's."</p>

<p>Andy clasped his hands behind his head and examined the young
man before him with half-closed eyes. His tone was almost
insolently challenging, yet beneath the veil of his eyelids lurked
still a spark of lazy amusement.</p>

<p>Leslie reddened to the insolence, which seemed real enough to
him. He drew himself up stiffly.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," he said with dignity. "I shall not trouble you
further."</p>

<p>He turned away but found the effect of his exit somewhat marred
by the fact that his horse had been taken away and he had no place
to go. Likewise there lay his saddlebags and <i>cantinas.</i> He
turned with what dignity he could summon to make the necessary
request. The man was smiling at him.</p>

<p>"Don't get mad, bub," said Andy. "I was only teasing you a mite.
Bless you, I know boys. I've got one, just about your age. And I
know men. I ought to by now. I've seed enough of 'em and enough
kinds in my time. Didn't I follow along with your game?" he
reminded. "I don't doubt you for a minute. You come over here and
sit down. Now tell me all about this. It's a pretty blind trail
from where I am."</p>

<p>Reluctantly at first Leslie obeyed. But Andy's warmth was
genuine, and he had turned serious.</p>

<p>"Now it makes sense," observed the latter with satisfaction,
when he heard of Djo's encounter with Ransom. "I wondered." He
looked at Leslie keenly. "So you came over here to see Djo, eh?
Djo's at Monterey. He'll be back tomorrow."</p>

<p>Leslie hesitated, reddened.</p>

<p>"No, sir," he said frankly. "I didn't even know Djo lived here.
I'd have come, if I had known." He stopped, reflecting swiftly on
the rigid Spanish convention; reflected further that the manner of
his arrival was already known. "Your daughter brought me here," he
confessed. "We met over the hills yonder, about six miles."</p>

<p>"Amata? She brought you here?" Leslie imagined a stiffening in
his host's manner. "How did that happen?"</p>

<p>Painfully but honestly Leslie detailed the episode. He did not
spare either his ignorance or what he called his stupidity. He even
told of the derringer.</p>

<p>"I'm new to the country," confessed Leslie stoutly. "I'm afraid
I'm an awful greenhorn." This was not easy to say, in view of the
Colt's revolving pistol and the sky-for-his-roof.</p>

<p>The <i>ranchero</i> surveyed him with approval.</p>

<p>"That's right, son," said he. "Don't try to be what you ain't.
It can't be done. I knew all that. As for being a
greenhorn"&mdash;he paused, and his keen gray eyes softened and
became far away&mdash;"when I was about your age&mdash;maybe a
trifle younger&mdash;I was just starting out, on foot, from
home&mdash;to try my luck in the world, out West." He chuckled. "I
thought I was quite a figure of a woodsman with my rifle over my
shoulder and my bundle at my back. Old Dan'l Boone was nothing to
me&mdash;by the way, the rifle I carried once belonged to old
Dan'l. I thought I was some pumpkins. I see now I was the greenest
green-horn that ever stepped. A man gets over being a green-horn,
ef'n he's a man. There's worse things..." His voice trailed off in
rumination. "There's a passel of things happened since then. That's
a long time ago." He lost himself in reverie. Leslie looked at him,
fascinated by something strong and sure he could divine but could
not identify. Andy looked up with a twinkle. "You'll stay and see
Djo," he stated, rather than invited. "You two'll team well. He can
learn you lots, and I reckon you can give him a few pointers, too.
Shucks!" said Andy to Leslie's half demur. "Never mind Constansio;
he'll keep. You've got a job here, ain't you?" He grinned
relishingly. "I'll dig up the papers and <i>diseño,</i> and you can
go at it&mdash;whatever it is." Andy's manner was of tolerant
amusement. "Djo'll help you." He laid his hand on Leslie's arm.
"I'd like for you to know Djo," he said persuasively, "and I'd like
for Djo to know you."</p>

<p>Leslie warmed to the obvious approval of the <i>ranchero</i> for
himself, though its reason was obscure to him. But the sincerity of
the invitation was unmistakable.</p>

<p>"What say?" urged Andy.</p>

<p>"I'd like nothing better in the world!" cried Leslie. The
thought of Djo struck him with another thought.</p>

<p>"This Ransom!" he cried.</p>

<p>"What about him?"</p>

<p>"He came to make trouble."</p>

<p>"Well, you headed that off&mdash;for now, anyway," said Andy
comfortably. "We got rid of him."</p>

<p>"But he's not going to give up that easily."</p>

<p>"Probably not," agreed Andy. "We'll try to handle him when the
time comes."</p>

<p>"But Djo!"</p>

<p>"What about Djo?"</p>

<p>"Aren't you afraid that Ransom will&mdash;that Ransom
may&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Djo will take care of himself. I've l'arned him that."</p>

<p>"But this man is armed, and Djo&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Djo," said Andy emphatically, "knows this man is somewhere in
the country and must be layin' to get even. That's enough. He will
be armed by now, and he'll sure see him first, and don't you fret
about his gettin' ambushed because Djo won't be ridin' within long
range of ary ambushes. Besides," added Andy, "this Ransom didn't
come up here to pick any row with just a pistol. Not yet. His arm
is hurt."</p>

<p>"What did he come for, then?" demanded Leslie.</p>

<p>"I don't know: spying around, perhaps." He grinned. "Aiming to
steal the <i>rancho,</i> didn't you say?" This idea continued to
amuse him.</p>

<p>"He might have confederates with him."</p>

<p>"You won't be a greenhorn long," observed Andy approvingly.
Nevertheless he failed to be perturbed. "We'll know, come night, as
soon as the <i>mozas</i> come in," he said presently. He looked at
Leslie's face and chuckled under his breath. "There's no keeping
things hid in this country, son." He relented to explanation: "Down
at the creek the <i>mozas</i> wash clothes all day and talk; about
an equal share of each, I should judge. Every <i>vaquero</i> and
<i>mozo</i> and Injun&mdash;and the dickybirds, I sometimes
think&mdash;traveling about the country for any reason whatever
sees to it they cross the creek where the girls are washing; and
they tell all they know. And the <i>mozas</i> spread the news. And
tell it back. Beats the telegraph. If anything ever happened that
wasn't known from one end of the country to the other by sundown, I
never heard of it<i>.</i> If this Ransom has a gang, we'll know and
take measures according." He arose and stretched his long form.</p>

<p>Leslie arose with him.</p>

<p>"I hope I didn't get Miss Amata in any trouble," said he
respectfully.</p>

<p>Andy stopped and looked at him. "Trouble? What trouble?"</p>

<p>Leslie expounded.</p>

<p>"She tell you all that?" Andy seemed incredulous. He laughed
suddenly with great relish. "Well, seems like the Doña
Amata"&mdash;he chuckled again at the name&mdash;"is growed up all
of a sudden. I can't recall anybody worrying about all that truck
before. Mebbe we'd better go see if old Vicenta has sculped
her!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>Chapter 6</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>EVIDENTLY Amata was not "sculped." Indeed, as far as Leslie
could see, no one, save Amata herself, appeared to be inclined to
pay any attention to the matter. The dreaded Vicenta was most
amiable.</p>

<p>"He is the smiling one," said she.</p>

<p>But it was Djo, who returned next day, who, with fraternal
indifference, put the young lady's romantic pretensions in their
place.</p>

<p>"Amata!" he snorted when he heard. "That <i>niña pequeña!</i>
She's always trying to make people think she's grown up!"</p>

<p>His attitude toward Amata's inclination to ally herself with any
of the lads' expeditions or activities was of denial or easy
tolerance. Leslie suddenly saw her as a child, a charming child,
but a child nevertheless. This was the private solace of his pride.
But in her company somehow, he stepped warily and eyed askance,
for, though she might indeed be but a child, there was something
very close beneath the surface that at once attracted and made
cautious the young man's spirit.</p>

<p>Djo was, naturally, overjoyed to find his new acquaintance at
the <i>rancho.</i> This occupied his mind, so that he merely nodded
when Leslie excitedly told him of Ransom's visit to the
<i>rancho.</i> But Leslie noticed, in spite of this apparent
indifference, that, true to Andy's prediction, Djo had arrived with
a rifle across his saddle.</p>

<p>Naturally, Djo took Leslie in charge, and eagerly. He must do
the honors, show him all there was to be seen, do with him all
there was to do. This, on such a ranch, was a tremendous lot, and
it was all strange and interesting to Leslie.</p>

<p>At first they rode: from morning to night. Leslie found himself
furnished with fresh horses, new equipment, even garments more
appropriate than the few his saddlebags had contained. The latter
disappeared. He never saw them again. He learned of the cattle
business, and the milling business, and the intricate business of
the vineyards and grainfields, and <i>milpas,</i> all of which
fascinated him. He liked every little detail, even to the choking
dust of the corrals where the branding was done, and he eagerly
asked dozens of questions, generally of Djo or Andy, but failing
them of anyone he met. The people of the <i>rancho</i> liked, him.
He was unashamed of his ignorance and his faulty Spanish. He was
repeatedly trying to translate literally English idioms; or even
slang phrases. The results were sometimes astounding. At first his
interlocutors struggled for politeness, but finding him ready to
laugh wholeheartedly with them, a good time was had by all. He was
a smiling one.</p>

<p>And he wanted to try everything. He practiced tirelessly with
the <i>reata.</i> He and Djo spent hours with the Colt's revolving
pistol, banging away at a mark. Here was one thing Djo envied him.
They burned so much powder and made so much noise that finally by
request they moved their range down in the flat, a little farther
from the house. This was an absorbing occupation. There was plenty
of technique to figure out, not only as to the shooting itself, but
in such minor matters as molding successful bullets. It took
several trials before they were able to tap from the mold shining
silverlike bullets undisturbed by shrunken metal or bubble holes: a
matter of temperatures, both of the metal and of the mold
itself.</p>

<p>Djo was already a fair shot, but Leslie at first was likely to
miss the whole tree to which their mark was pegged.</p>

<p>The weapon jumped wildly and erratically, and try as he might he
could not avoid anticipating the loud black-powder <i>bang</i> of
the discharge. Djo could not help him much with theory.</p>

<p>"You just got to get used to it," said he. "It's practice."</p>

<p>But Leslie's mind had an analytical quirk. "Practice is all
right," he returned, "if you know what you're practicing at."</p>

<p>He brooded over the elements of the situation, took them apart
in his mind, had an idea.</p>

<p>"Look here, Djo," said he, "the pistol goes off when the hammer
hits the cap. Don't it?"</p>

<p>"Why, sure!" agreed Djo to the self-evident.</p>

<p>"We've been thinking the kick throws the shot high. Let's find
out." Leslie extended the weapon and took careful aim.</p>

<p>"You've got no cap on," Djo pointed out.</p>

<p>"That's just the idea." Leslie aimed again and pulled the
trigger. "Just as I thought!" he cried with mingled triumph and
chagrin. "The muzzle jerked up a foot! Don't you see? If we can't
hold the muzzle where we aim until the bullet's gone, we aren't
going to hit anything. The bullet's going just exactly where the
muzzle points. We got to keep aiming <i>after</i> we pull the
trigger. Here, try it!"</p>

<p>Djo tried it, tried it again and again.</p>

<p>"Doggone!" he muttered. "I flinched off every time!"</p>

<p>"I don't believe," said Leslie, "that the kick has anything to
do with it!"</p>

<p>This was too radical for immediate acceptance.</p>

<p>The actual shooting ceased. The two lads took turn snapping the
empty pistol. Even after the involuntary flinching from the
explosion had been eliminated from their minds, they found the
greatest difficulty in keeping the sights aligned on the mark after
the fall and jar of the hammer. Both had steady hands and nerves
and keen eyesight. There was no difficulty in taking good aim and
holding it <i>until</i> the trigger was pulled. Why was that?</p>

<p>"Practice," said Djo; but Leslie worried and experimented until
he had, empirically, stumbled on another great principle.</p>

<p>"Don't grip it tight. Hold it loose," he said. "The looser you
hold it in your hand, the better you can hold it on. Try it."</p>

<p>Djo tried it.</p>

<p>"That's right," he acknowledged. "But," he objected, "that's all
right for an empty gun, but if you're going actually to shoot it
you've got to hold it tight or it'll kick all over the place."</p>

<p>"Let's see," said Leslie. He loaded and capped the weapon.
"Stand back," he advised Djo. "This thing may jump out of my hand
and bite you. I'm going to let it just <i>lay</i> in my hand. Let's
see how far off she can kick."</p>

<p>He fired. The pistol leaped, all but wrenching itself from
Leslie's loosened hand. But the bullet, for the first time, hit
squarely in the small blaze they were using as a mark. Djo and
Leslie looked at one another ecstatically. They solemnly shook
hands.</p>

<p>"We've got it by the tail," said Djo,</p>

<p>After which, of course, a measure of disillusion.</p>

<p>Conquests are not made as easily as all that. The gap between
even the most perfect theory and performance cannot be leaped. It
must be bridged. But only a measure. There was now something
definite to be worked upon.</p>

<p>Andy, passing, sometimes dismounted and squatted on his heels
apart, listening. He was much amused and more than a little
interested. Appealed to, in the early stages, for instruction, he
was unable to contribute much. "You've got to squeeze the trigger"
was all he could tell them. On request he fired a few rounds to
show them, There was not much to see, except that his large strong
hand looked to be as steady as a vise, and the bullets grouped
discouragingly in or close to the blaze on the tree. "You just
shoot," said he vaguely. He honestly did not know how he did it,
nor appreciate the long years that lay back of his coordinations.
He examined the bullet holes disparagingly. "Those things can't
shoot close, like a good rifle," said he. "They really ain't much
good. Unless you l'arn to shoot 'em fast. That's what I practice
at, myself." He buckled on the holster. "Look here," said he. He
snatched out the weapon and fired, in one coordinated motion of
shoulder, arm, hand, and thumb. The bullet hit the tree a foot or
so from the blaze. "That's close enough for what these things are
good for. You hunch your shoulder forward," he explained.</p>

<p>"But you've got to learn to hit <i>something</i> slow before you
can hit anything fast," submitted Leslie respectfully.</p>

<p>"That's right, I reckon," admitted Andy.</p>

<p>That was his only demonstration. He sat apart on his heels and
listened, while his beautiful horse stood above him champing the
rollers of its bit, its ears flicking and its nostrils expanding to
an inaudible snort at each discharge, disliking the noise
intensely, but too well trained to expostulate openly.</p>

<p>Andy made no comments, but to Carmel he said later:
<i>"Querida,</i> that boy has a good head on his shoulders. He's
taught me a lot I don't know about shooting."</p>

<p>Carmel turned on him her beautiful eyes.</p>

<p>"You, <i>mi alma?</i> This one has taught <i>you</i> to
shoot!"</p>

<p>"Not <i>how</i> to shoot; <i>why</i> I shoot," corrected Andy.
He explained, "He figured all that out himself. He's going to do
Djo a lot of good. I'm glad he came along. We must try to keep
him."</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>Amata, snubbed once or twice by Djo, left the two young men
quite strictly to themselves. She caused Leslie to understand that
their absorption in noisy and dusty activities did not appeal to
her. She busied herself about the <i>casa</i> or rode abroad,
either alone or with her father or an old hard-bitten
<i>vaquero</i> called Panchito. Her cool and detached, not to say
amused, attitude rather shook Leslie's impression of her
childishness. He began to regret his hasty adoption of Djo's point
of view. It might have been pleasant to have gone along on some of
these rides, but Djo was always on hand with some fresh proposal,
and he a little deprecated Djo's opinion. Once Amata took a dig at
Djo.</p>

<p>"You're just showing off to him," she said.</p>

<p>Djo, stung, repelled this insinuation indignantly.</p>

<p>"I am not so!" he cried. "It's just that he's so green about
everything. But he learns fast," he added loyally. He stared at
Amata, perplexed, seeing her with new eyes.</p>

<p>The evenings, shortened by early bedtime, were spent in the
great hallway of the <i>casa.</i> The Doña Carmel sewed or
embroidered. Andy smoked his pipe. Amata usually sat still as a
mouse by her mother's side, engaged in her own handiwork. There was
a variety of small talk, mostly to do with the affairs of the
<i>rancho,</i> and occasionally music of singing to the guitar. The
framework was simple to the point of dullness, yet it was not dull
somehow. One evening, unexpectedly, Amata took the lead. She began
to question Leslie, to draw him out as to the cities of the East:
his own home, the affairs of the larger world from which he had
come. Leslie answered readily enough, but diffidently. He had not
thought such humdrum matters could possibly interest people living
in the very heart of romance. He was not yet experienced enough to
realize that romance is over the hill.</p>

<p>"Why, I came from Pennsylvania as a lad!" cried Andy when this
fact came out. His interest kindled. He began, in his turn, to ask
questions. Amata fell silent, a faint satisfied smile on <i>her</i>
lips. Carmel looked at her covertly, with speculation. However,
Amata was merely putting Djo in his place.</p>

<p>At the end of a wholly delightful week, however, Leslie's
conscience aroused. He importuned Andy until the latter, half
amused, half annoyed, at last consented to rummage for the papers
and the <i>diseño</i> that represented his title to Folded
Hills.</p>

<p>"I'm not even sure I got one," he grumbled. "Señor Castefiares
made 'em out. That was years ago. I didn't pay much attention. I
was too busy to go out with him. I think Panchito was with him.
I'll ask Panchito. There were papers all right: I remember them,
but I'm not sure Castefiares didn't take 'em with him to Monterey.
I remember! It was time of the rodeo, and we had a passel of folks
here for the <i>fiesta!</i> Don't they record these things?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Leslie. "We could get copies. I have copies of the
Constansio ranch&mdash;where I was going, you know. But if you had
them&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll ask Mrs. Burnett," said Andy, giving it up.</p>

<p>Carmel promptly produced the required documents.</p>

<p>Andy passed them over, apparently without curiosity as to what
was to be done with them, or interest.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>Leslie and Djo, and later Panchito, rode the <i>rancho</i> for
several days, trying to identify landmarks, to establish the
boundaries. It was impossible to do so with any accuracy. "A
white-oak tree," "a curious rock," "a mound of earth." Many of
them, apparently destroyed or disappeared. Others existing in
bewildering duplication. Distances and compass directions sometimes
flatly contradictory. The whole thing was a mess: a jumble. Leslie
could make no head or tail of it. Panchito, though he had been
present, was not of much help. Except that he could, under close
questioning, give Leslie some idea of how this extraordinary
hodgepodge had been accomplished. The whole survey had been done on
horseback, generally at a lope.</p>

<p>"But how could measurements be taken?" cried Leslie. By a
<i>reata.</i> A horseman dropped one end and paid it out until he
reached the other. At full gallop? But of course; how else? And how
about while the rider was recovering and recoiling the
<i>reata?</i> Oh, allowance was made for that. But how? By guess?
But surely; how else?</p>

<p>Leslie looked about him in despair. He reapplied himself to the
terms of the grant. It was an impressive document, on parchment,
with a great seal and the signature of the governor, Figueroa, in a
fine flourish. It read well and fluently. "South three hundred and
fifty <i>estradas</i> to a large live-oak tree, thence a hundred
and twenty-five <i>estradas</i> to a white oak riven by the wind,"
and so on, from one point to another. It was all very clear, except
for one thing: there was rarely by any chance a live oak or a white
oak or a curious rock or whatever within any reasonable distance of
where it ought to be. The indications&mdash;or rather those Leslie
guessed at as being the nearest to description&mdash;led them on
and on until even Djo stopped, bewildered.</p>

<p>"But this is not the boundary of Folded Hills!" he cried.
"Folded Hills extends way over the hills yonder!"</p>

<p>"Let's go back and try again," said Leslie. In spite of the fact
that he seemed the volatile, and Djo the steadfast, character, it
was Leslie who stuck to the task obstinately long after Djo's
patience was exhausted. But Djo did not as yet take the matter very
seriously. Leslie's mind had been educated to a more formal
politic. He was appalled.</p>

<p>The day was strong with the dry heat of interior California that
smells hot and tastes hot in the nostrils, but in which is no
prostration. They drew up finally in the shade of a wide live oak
and dismounted for a little, while Panchito squatted apart, holding
the horses. Djo was chuckling at their discomfiture.</p>

<p>"Well, are you licked, old stick-to-it?" he asked
affectionately.</p>

<p>Leslie had difficulty making him see the gravity of the
situation, or rather its grave possibilities. As the matter stood
right now, it would be entirely possible for any stranger to file
on at least the outlying acres of Folded Hills, with a very fair
possibility that he would, in fact, be taking up legally public
land. As a usual thing, legal remedying of defective titles was so
long drawn out and involved and expensive that, when the smoke had
cleared away, it was likely that nothing remained. Leslie was
eloquent with examples; the result of his week's investigation. Few
of these large landholders had any ready money with which to pay
lawyers or taxes or the expense of defense. To raise such funds
they had often to sell part of the land. Land whose title was
clouded fetched only a fraction of its real value, for only
speculators would buy it&mdash;or the sharper lawyers, who were on
the inside. If the case was decided in the landowner's favor, it
was almost invariably appealed to the higher local court, thence to
Washington. There was no end to it. More and more fees and costs.
The necessity of raising more money. Generally the lawyers were
willing to take their fees, immense fees, in land and cattle; and
so gradually they and their clients changed places, and the lawyers
became the <i>hacendados.</i></p>

<p>That's the way it had happened, was happening about the Bay.</p>

<p>"We don't want your father to get into that kind of a mess,"
said Leslie.</p>

<p>"I should say not!" cried Djo.</p>

<p>All that was bad enough, but there was the further matter of
squatters: such as had overwhelmed Don Luis Peralta. They had no
legal standing whatever, of course, but they had legal backing. At
first merely a scattering of the truculent who took land defiantly
because they wanted it, they had become powerful. Leslie tried to
impress on the skeptical Djo how this could be. The squatters were
organized. They elected senators, judges, court officials, land
officials. At times they even opposed legal ejectment with
arms.</p>

<p>"You heard what Ransom said about the cannon over at Peralta's,"
said Leslie.</p>

<p>The slightest rumor that the title of any land might prove shaky
attracted a swarm of these people. Many had no intention of trying
to hold their claims. They established themselves in the hope of
selling out cheap to some of the land-hungry on their way across
the plains.</p>

<p>To Djo most of this did not at first seem credible. He had to
end by believing, for Leslie's knowledge was exact and detailed and
fortified with examples.</p>

<p>"I'd heard something of these troubles, but I had no idea," said
Djo. He ended by catching Leslie's disquiet. Vallejo himself, it
seemed, was deeply involved. What was there to do?</p>

<p>"Get the title straight," said Leslie promptly. "That's why
we've got to trace out this boundary if we can. So I can make a
good report. If I can't report everything in order, don't you see
what will happen? As soon as it got out, they'd be down here like a
swarm of locusts."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"The squatters. The least little rumor that the title of any
land might turn out to be shaky and they come arunning. Those are
mostly the sort that squat and hang on long enough to sell out to
someone really looking for a farm. They sell out cheap and move on.
They only try it where the title is in doubt. The real squatters
settle down anywhere, regardless."</p>

<p>"How do you know so much about all this?" Djo looked at him with
an admiration that brought to Leslie's spirit a comforting glow.
Leslie had been, at Folded Hills, the humble greenhorn.</p>

<p>"Part of my job," said he.</p>

<p>Of course Folded Hills was a long distance back, still...</p>

<p>"Let's go back to the <i>mojonera</i> and start over again,"
said Djo, rising.</p>

<p>They mounted and rode back to the <i>mojonera,</i> the official
starting: point of Castenares' original "survey." It was clearly
identifiable, "a monument of rounded stones in which is planted a
wooden cross." The wooden cross had long since disintegrated, but
the pile of stones was still there. But the fresh start gave no
better result. The original inaccuracies of measurement and
direction would probably have been sufficient. But
additionally&mdash;and neither Djo nor Leslie could know
that&mdash;the very location of the <i>mojonera</i> was fictitious.
It was supposed to abut a corner of El Rancho Soledad. But señor
Castenares had been unable to find monuments of the latter. He did
not look long.</p>

<p>"Ah, well," he had said comfortably, "it is undoubtedly
somewhere in this valley," and had wasted no more time in the
matter, but had built himself a new one.</p>

<p>Djo drew rein and looked hopelessly at his friend. "The thing to
do," said Leslie with decision, "is to get the boundaries properly
surveyed and marked&mdash;in accordance with this." He brushed the
parchment grant with the flat of his hand. "Then one would fit with
the other, anyway."</p>

<p>"Why, of course." Djo was obviously relieved. He appeared to
think this solved the whole situation and looked at his friend with
admiration. "Who does it? You?"</p>

<p>"I?" Leslie laughed.</p>

<p>"Well, you're a land officer, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"That's the point. I'm a land officer, and I mustn't know
anything is wrong here until it's all right. I've got to report
what I find. There are probably regular surveyors to be had at
Monterey. But it ought to be done right away. I'll have to make my
report, you know." He caught a queer look in Djo's eyes. "I'm under
oath, you know," said he.</p>

<p>Djo nodded soberly. He was deeply impressed.</p>

<p>"Let's go back to the <i>casa</i> and talk to my father," said
he.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>They remounted and jogged slowly cross country in the direction
of the <i>casa.</i> This was now latter April, the gorgeous turn of
the year. The wild flowers lay in brilliant blankets of orange and
yellow and blue flung over the hills, whose green was blurring
toward an imminent ripeness. The air was an infusion of sunlight
and sun warmth that held all things in solution, so that bird
liltings and calls, hot perfumes, blue-toned shadows, and the
harlequin colors of the hills were by it all blended into one
impression of consciousness. It was good to be alive and to breathe
deep.</p>

<p>Atop the first rise of the foothills they drew rein and looked
back over the broad flat of the valley. Between its confining
ramparts it flowed like a river to lose itself in a brown mist of
distance, beyond which was the sea. On its bosom floated tiny the
details of its identity. There were the dabs of green that were the
scattered oaks, and the strips of green that were tire cottonwoods
and sycamores of the river, and a splash of white so small that
almost it must be guessed, and that must be the Mission of Nuestra
señora de la Soledad.</p>

<p>Djo's eyes narrowed to a focus. He touched Leslie's arm. From
behind the shoulder of a hill below them appeared a horseman. He
was riding at a foot pace and peering about him closely as though
in search of something, so closely that he did not look up to see
the three on the sky line above him. Djo, his eyes dancing,
signaled caution to his companions and slowly backed his horse into
the concealment of the chaparral. The others imitated him. Leslie
looked his inquiry, but Djo paid him no attention. From the screen
of the brush they watched the man below them.</p>

<p>The latter zigzagged, almost as though at random, spying his
immediate surroundings, turning often in his saddle to look back.
When he came to the pile of stones, the <i>mojonera,</i> he stopped
his horse. Djo at last turned to Leslie.</p>

<p>"Do you know who it is?" he asked excitedly in a low voice.
"It's Ransom!"</p>

<p>"Ransom!" repeated Leslie, dumfounded. "Are you sure? I couldn't
make out at that distance."</p>

<p>"It's Ransom," repeated Djo emphatically, "and you know what I
think? He's following us: that's just where we came from."</p>

<p>"Gosh!" cried Leslie. "What'll we do?"</p>

<p>The boys looked at one another. For a time they had carried with
them on their excursions the Colt's revolving pistol, but its
oppressive weight had outlasted its romance. They were unarmed. Djo
spoke rapidly to Panchito in Spanish.</p>

<p>"We could ride him down with our <i>reatas,"</i> said he. "I
don't believe he could hit us with a pistol."</p>

<p>But Leslie's very inexperience gave him the cooler, or perhaps
the more cautious, head.</p>

<p>"He has a rifle&mdash;under his leg," he pointed out, "and,
anyway, what right have we got to attack him without knowing for
sure that he <i>is</i> after us?"</p>

<p>Djo looked at him with amazed scorn.</p>

<p>"What else is he hanging around here for?" he wanted to
know.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Leslie clung to his point. It was finally agreed
that they should arm themselves at the <i>casa,</i> return, call
upon Ransom for an accounting of his presence at Folded Hills.</p>

<p>"Though we really don't know if it <i>is</i> Folded Hills,"
Leslie reminded with a flash of humor.</p>

<p>Panchito would stay here.</p>

<p>"You will see in which direction this one goes," Djo instructed
him. "But he must not know you watch him. And wait here until we
return. If he follows our tracks up the hill, then slip away and
ride to let us know. Understand?"</p>

<p>"Have no fear, <i>patroncito,"</i> said Panchito comfortably.
The two dropped over the brow of the hill and raced away. They
returned within the hour, armed with the derringer, the revolving
pistol, and a rifle.</p>

<p>"He must be still in the valley&mdash;otherwise Panchito would
have met us," panted Djo. "What can he be doing there?"</p>

<p>"Lying in wait for us," hazarded Leslie. "We've been riding
there a lot lately looking for the boundary. He saw it by our
tracks."</p>

<p>Djo nodded. They slackened down, crept forward to where they had
left Panchito. Panchito was still there, sprawled out at ease,
smoking a cigarette.</p>

<p>"He has ridden away, down the valley," said Panchito. "In the
direction of Soledad."</p>

<p>"Come on!" said Djo,</p>

<p>The three followed after Ransom. To Leslie it was very
interesting, for immediately the flat country was reached, Djo led
them aside, so they followed, not on Ransom's direct trail, but off
the flank. Every so often they stopped, and either Djo or Panchito
rode at right angles to cut the tracks and redetermine their
direction. Soon it became evident that the man was angling toward
the Camino Real, the regular route north and south. Once he had
reached this, he pursued his journey methodically. He passed
Soledad. He continued on toward the west.</p>

<p>Djo drew rein.</p>

<p>"There's no sense going farther," said he. "It's getting late. I
can't make it out. What is he doing, Panchito?" he asked in
Spanish.</p>

<p>"He is going away," replied the <i>vaquero.</i></p>

<p>Djo laughed vexedly. "Evidently. But why? Where did he come
from? Has he been around here all the time since he visited the
<i>rancho?</i> If so, where's he been staying? What is he
after?"</p>

<p>"I suppose he wants to get even with you&mdash;with us,"
suggested Leslie.</p>

<p>"Then why hasn't he? He must have had chances for ambush!
Well"&mdash;Djo set his jaw grimly&mdash;"he won't have any
more!"</p>

<p>He turned his horse, shaking his head, puzzled.</p>

<p>"Well, come on!" He struck spurs to his horse. "Let's get home.
It'll be dark&mdash;"</p>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>Chapter 7</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>THEY took Andy apart after the evening meal. He listened,
questioning them sharply as to a detail now and again.</p>

<p>"Why should he want to bother Leslie?" He caught up that
point.</p>

<p>"Because Leslie gave me his pistol that time we had our little
mix-up," said Djo.</p>

<p>"You didn't tell me about that," Andy accused Leslie.</p>

<p>"It wasn't anything," the latter disclaimed.</p>

<p>Andy grunted. His eye was kind.</p>

<p>"I don't know," he said when the story was finished, "why he
didn't take a pot shot: he must have had plenty chances. Nothing to
go on. You think he's gone?"</p>

<p>"We followed him beyond Soledad, and he was still going," said
Djo.</p>

<p>"Well, we'll make sure." He stepped to the door and issued an
order. To Panchito he said, "Send one of the
Indians&mdash;Ramirez&mdash;to follow the way this man has gone and
see that he has not doubled back. He may have seen you on the hill
and is doing this to fool you," he told the two young men. Having
given this command, he apparently dismissed the whole matter from
his mind. Nor was he particularly impressed by what Leslie had to
say of the boundary situation. He nodded gravely to the young man's
arguments.</p>

<p>"That's very interesting," he said. "I had no idea things were
quite so bad. I'm obleeged to you, Leslie; First chance I get I'll
have someone come up from Monterey to make a survey." But he could
not promise to do so immediately. "I reckon I'd have to go myself,"
said he. "Since Tom Larkin moved to San Francisco, I wouldn't know
who to write a letter to. And we're going to be busy now with the
spring rodeo."</p>

<p>The reasons for haste did not impress him.</p>

<p>"Nobody's going to bother us way out here," said he. "Be
reasonable. What those fellers want is farm claims, and there are
thousands of acres to squabble over a sight nearer the cities than
we are here. Now why," said Andy, "should anybody come this far to
squat on land when there's aplenty nearer home?"</p>

<p>It was pointed out to him that Leslie's official position
required him to make a report which, once it was in, would place on
file for all time irregularities that might make trouble. Andy
appeared to consider this seriously, though the mention of the
official position brought a twinkle to his eye.</p>

<p>"Better postpone it till after the rodeo anyway," he suggested.
"You've never seen a rodeo. You'll like it. Only means a week or
so. And then why can't you go up to Constansio's and do your work
there; and by the time you get that done I'll have things
straightened out here. You supposed to get back to San Francisco
any particular time?"</p>

<p>That seemed to be a sound idea. Andy went on about his
preparations for the rodeo. Though he tried to conceal the fact, he
did not take the matter seriously. Undoubtedly the stories Leslie
had to tell were true, at least in part. But Andy knew that many of
the alleged Spanish grants were indeed fraudulent, dished out
corruptly and illegally by some of the later Mexican governors in a
scramble to get something for themselves before the collapse.
Larkin had told him something of that. Some pieces of land were
covered, it was said; by five different grants! But Folded Hills
was an old establishment; it came direct from Figueroa. Andy could
not believe that any small technicalities could affect him, And as
a loyal American he could not conceive that any real injustice
would be long tolerated.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>The Indian reported that Ransom had kept on going, had not
doubled back.</p>

<p>"Well, I can't figure him," said Andy, perplexed. However, he
had no time to waste on mere theory. "Keep your eyes skinned, Djo,
case he comes back," and made no further reference to the
episode.</p>

<p>Nor did it long linger in Leslie's thoughts except as something
vague over the horizon of the future, to be taken up later, like
this land-inspection business. The immediate present was full,
gorgeously full, bewilderingly full.</p>

<p>Leslie at times felt his flesh surreptitiously to be sure he was
really awake and present. The thing was unbelievably stage-set,
romantic, picturesque. The <i>casa</i> overflowed with people, come
in from the neighboring <i>ranchos</i> for the occasion, all sorts
of people, young and old, of both sexes. Most of them dressed in
what, to Leslie, was an extreme of fancy-dress costume. They were
dark and handsome and lighthearted, and they took the young
stranger to their hearts with a touching spontaneity. The days
brimmed full with doings, from morning starlight, when the men rode
forth in the dusk on the business of the cattle, until all hours of
the night, when the last guitar muted. The serious work of the year
was forward and was efficiently performed, but somehow it was so
intermingled with picnic and games and dance and feast and a sly
gallant love-making that it was tossed off as a heady draught of
pleasure. When the last guest had departed, Leslie drew a deep
breath and looked about him as though awakening from a dream.
Somehow a long period of time seemed to have elapsed, though the
rodeo had actually lasted but a week. And the placidity of life
seemed only slowly to reestablish itself, to resume its accustomed
routine.</p>

<p>So real was this impression of lapse of time that Leslie was
unreasonably conscience-stricken over his own dawdling. After all,
he told himself, he was a government official, and he had raised
his hand and sworn an oath to be honest and diligent about the
government's affairs, and he supposed he was drawing some sort of a
salary. Or was he? Leslie stopped short, laughed at himself. This
was the first time that question had occurred to him. At any rate,
he had no excuse to stay on at Folded Hills. At the rodeo he had
met señor Constansio, a very dignified white-bearded old fellow,
who had assured Leslie he would be more than welcome at Alisal, but
who had the greatest difficulty in comprehending his errand there.
However, if Don Andreo approved, it was all right. <i>Arividerse,
señor.</i> Andy laughed.</p>

<p>"I doubt if you'll find Alisal much better marked than Folded
Hills," said he. "Or any other of the <i>ranchos,</i> as far as
that goes. I was talking to Ramon about it&mdash;Ramon
Rivera&mdash;you know, the one who talks English. He's Mrs.
Burnett's brother. He has a <i>rancho</i> over Jolon way. We
thought it might be a good idea, once we get us that surveyor from
Monterey, to have him go over all the <i>ranchos</i> hereabouts and
straighten 'em all out. There's only a half a dozen or so."</p>

<p>Leslie thought this an excellent idea and said so. He had no
specific instructions, except as to the Constansio <i>rancho,</i>
but he saw no reason why he should not extend his operations. That
would take some time. He saw himself much at Folded Hills. Perhaps
it would be possible to make his headquarters at Folded Hills.
Leslie's ideas of Californian distances were still crude. He felt a
great relief when his departure was thus postponed. He strongly did
not want to leave Folded Hills. He liked it. He liked the life. He
liked Djo. He increasingly admired Andy, in whom he had but lately
discovered a veritable mine&mdash;if cautiously worked&mdash;of the
most astounding adventure stories. Leslie had had no idea that his
host had been an Indian fighter! He liked the Doña Carmel and her
soft beautiful eyes, and her dark hair, and her comforting air of
wise understanding, and her heartening fashion of treating him as a
grown man of dependence. He liked Amata, at whom he looked with
fresh attention now that he was so soon to depart. He even tried to
make up for his absorption in Djo and men's activities <i>by</i>
asking her to ride with him and was promptly snubbed for his pains.
But Djo was wrong about one thing. She was no child, now that he
took a good look at her. She was quite grown up, or would be in a
year or so.</p>

<p>There was no reason why Leslie should not have accompanied the
Constansio outfit when it returned to its <i>rancho.</i> However,
he was easily persuaded to delay a day or two in order to observe
and perhaps take a small part in the <i>matanza</i> that must
follow the rodeo. Andy sent a messenger with a letter to Monterey,
for he learned that an old friend, Jacob Leese, had moved into
Larkin's house there, and Leese would get him a surveyor. Leslie
took the opportunity to send out a letter which must eventually
reach his uncle. It was a rather rhapsodic mixture of business and
ecstasy. Its purport was to convey for approval this new idea of
covering all the <i>ranchos;</i> its burden was what a perfectly
tremendous time he was having. Leslie piled on the local color.
Indeed he neglected to mention his present host as other than Don
Andreo. There was much more atmosphere to that than plain Andy
Burnett, and how could he know the difference the mention of that
name might have made?</p>

<p>Somehow the dispatch of this document impressed Leslie's
subconscious as something accomplished, so he felt justified in
yielding to persuasion and accompanying Andy and Djo on an
excursion through the low easterly mountains and hills toward the
great Valley. This was a pleasure excursion, Mountain-Man fashion,
with a single pack horse for the three and no <i>vaqueros.</i>
Leslie saw elk and antelope and many deer and several of the huge,
lumbering grizzly bears that stopped and stood on their hind legs,
their forepaws hanging ludicrously, and wrinkled their noses in
olfactory inquiry, but looked drolly good-humored. Leslie was much
excited over these animals and was disappointed to find that none
of them were to be killed, for he had never shot any big game. He
thought he concealed this chagrin, but Andy drew Djo one side.
"Take him out and let him git him a deer," said he. "Pick you a
yearlin' buck or a barren doe. We can use the meat."</p>

<p>So after a number of mortifying failures, which Djo comfortingly
took in his stride, Leslie triumphantly potted his first deer.</p>

<p>That night's camp was made in a stream bottom where the last of
the hills broke into the great Valley of the Joaquin. Leslie had
never been more happy in his life. The air was tepid; the sky hung
low with stars. The velvet of night covered the earth. The
firelight illumined the sycamore over their heads with weird
upward-flung shadows. The three men sat cross-legged, each with a
rib of venison in his hand. Other ribs, roasting, leaned toward the
flames, and their juices fell softly hissing in the embers.
Altogether to Leslie a completely satisfactory picture. He reveled
inwardly at being a part of it.</p>

<p>Suddenly Andy threw up his head in the attitude of
listening.</p>

<p>"Someone coming," he said under his breath.</p>

<p>Leslie could hear nothing at all, but he knew by Djo's
expression that he, too, had caught the indication. Leslie started
to speak but was warned to silence.</p>

<p>"Don't know who that can be this time of night," muttered
Andy.</p>

<p>As though by common consent he and Djo seized their rifles and
rose swiftly to their feet. Obeying a signal, Leslie followed. The
three glided into the darkness beyond the firelight and lay
flat.</p>

<p>"No hostile Injuns this side of the Valley, far as I know,"
whispered Andy, "but no use to take a chance."</p>

<p>Leslie's heart beat with a delirious excitement. He thrilled
from head to foot. Indians!</p>

<p>Now even he could hear the sounds of an approaching horse.</p>

<p>"He's alone," said Andy, sitting up and stretching his arms.
"Still, we'll just bide here and see what he looks like."</p>

<p>After a moment Panchito rode into the firelight and stopped,
looking about him.</p>

<p>"Señor!" he called. "Don Andreo!" His eyes narrowed as the
others moved in the darkness. "Señor." He bent from his saddle to
converse rapidly in Andy's ear. Andy turned to the young men. His
face had a queer expression, but his eyes were steady and
undisturbed.</p>

<p>"Ransom's back," said he, "and he's brought a passel of people
with him."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>Chapter 8</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>IN THE precision and swiftness of the next few minutes nothing
more was said and explained. Panchito brought in the horses,
shifted his saddle to the back of the animal that had been used for
packing, turned loose the one he had ridden. Andy and Djo deftly
bundled the items of the simple camp equipment and lashed it in the
branches of the tree. They worked silently and intently. Within the
five minutes they were in the saddle and away.</p>

<p>Leslie had never ridden at speed, in the dark, over a rough
country. Uncontrolledly his mind and his nerves shrank back from
this headlong plunge into the unseen; his body was tense with
muscles braced against a fall. He tried, but in vain, to emulate
the free and apparently careless swing of his companions in their
saddles. Mentally he could manage it, for brief periods; but his
instincts were stronger. Once Andy spoke to him.</p>

<p>"Slack your reins; give him his head," said he, "but keep ready
to pick him up if he stumbles."</p>

<p>By the grace of heaven, as Leslie thought, the beast did not
stumble, for he had not the vaguest idea of how he was to pick him
up if he did. At the end of a half-hour or so Andy drew rein. They
proceeded for a while at a foot pace to recover the horses. Not
until then did Leslie learn the whole of Panchito's tidings.</p>

<p>These people, according to Panchito, had made camp down the
valley, at the end of the grainfield, below the <i>milpas,</i> He
had not seen them, but it was reported that they numbered a half
hundred or so. They had come in horse-drawn wagons. There were
women. Beyond that he knew nothing. He had come away promptly in
search of the <i>patron.</i> The señora had dispatched him at
once.</p>

<p>And Ransom?</p>

<p>It was Ransom who had come to the <i>casa,</i> alone. He had
demanded to see Don Andreo, When he had learned that Don Andreo was
absent, he had departed, saying that he would await his return.
Thus said the Doña Carmel; he, Panchito, had seen none of this. The
Doña Carmel was not alarmed; the man had been polite, had made no
demands. Andy shook his head, doubtful, for his mind ran on war
parties, and on the plains war parties do not bring women and
children. It was Leslie who guessed the clue, but then Leslie had
recollection of a certain overheard conversation, and Andy had not.
Diffidently he spoke up, making his suggestion.</p>

<p>"This doctor on the stagecoach," he said. "You remember, Djo. He
asked this Ransom how many there were in his gang, how much land he
could use, and said something about if he found anything good to
let him know; he might turn farmer himself. And, yes, I'm beginning
to remember before that Ransom had made some sort of brag about
having something to do with the Peralta land. 'I sort of got the
boys settled.' That's it. Remember?"</p>

<p>Andy was listening attentively.</p>

<p>"Do you know what I think?" Leslie was in the uplift of a
gorgeous inspiration. "I don't believe this Ransom is a government
man at all! I'd bet he's some kind of a lawyer, or agent, or
whatever you call it, and he goes around looking up shaky titles
and bringing people to take them up, and&mdash;These people with
him; they are squatters, and he's brought them here, and that's
what he's been doing hanging around here; and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Slow up, bub; slow up!" Andy's drawl had its under-lilt of
amusement, but its real tone was serious. He pondered for a moment,
then slapped his thigh smartly with the flat of his hand. "That's
it. It fits. He's no friend of ours!"</p>

<p>"What'll you do?" cried Leslie.</p>

<p>"How do I know till we git there?" said Andy. He leaned from his
saddle to tap Leslie's shoulder. "You've got a head on you, son."
He touched spurs to his horse. The little cavalcade again dashed
forward. But for some time Leslie forgot to sit taut against
catastrophe, but rode relaxed in the glow of the <i>ranchero's</i>
approbation.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>They arrived at Folded Hills in the gray of the first dawn,
their horses slowed by the beginnings of fatigue, but still with
their tails out, for these consummate horsemen had known how to
conserve their energies for a notable journey. All the people of
the <i>rancho</i> were gathered about and near the <i>casa,</i>
men, women, and children. They crowded around the riders with many
cries and exclarnations. In the light of the fire someone had built
beneath the live oak and a few fat-pine torches, their faces showed
lighted with excitement. Some of the women were weeping
dramatically, their hair unbound. Andy quieted them with a
gesture.</p>

<p>"What has been done? Have these <i>e'tranjeros</i> attempted any
harm?" he demanded.</p>

<p>A dozen voices answered. He quieted them, indicated one. No, it
seemed, the intruders had stayed at the lower end of the valley.
They had occupied themselves in mysterious business of their own,
wandering by twos and threes over the flats and the lower hills.
None had ventured toward the <i>casa</i> save one, who had inquired
if the <i>patron</i> had yet returned, but who had retired after
receiving his answer.</p>

<p>"Very well"&mdash;Andy raised his voice&mdash;"return yourselves
to your homes and go to sleep. Go, I tell you! There is too much
noise here. You disturb the señora's rest."</p>

<p>He dismounted and, without looking back, strode into the house.
Djo and Leslie followed.</p>

<p>In the <i>sala,</i> fully dressed, sat Carmel and Amata. Andy
kissed them. They looked at him expectantly.</p>

<p>"Come," said Andy, "we are all weary. Let us get some rest."</p>

<p>"Rest"&mdash;Carmel shuddered&mdash;"with those <i>ladrones</i>
at our door? What shall we do?"</p>

<p>"Why, that," said Andy comfortably, "we shall determine in the
morning." He shifted to English, including Djo and Leslie in his
next remark. "Never decide anything when you're tired, less'n you
have to. Vicenta will tell you: 'When you're tired every flea is an
elephant.'" He made the quotation in Spanish. "Thing to do now is
to go to bed and get us some sleep."</p>

<p>"Sleep!"&mdash;cried Carmel. "I couldn't sleep!"</p>

<p>"Well, I could," said Andy, "and so, I reckon, could these boys.
We've come quite a ways." He laid his arm across Leslie's shoulder.
"And Leslie, here, has come twice as far because he's half as used
to it!" He laughed at the quaintness of his conceit. "He's all
right," said Andy to nobody in particular. "He came right along
without a squawk."</p>

<p>Leslie flushed, half with embarrassment, half with pleasure. He
had not known that Andy could have appreciated his involuntary
nervousness. He caught Amata's eyes fixed gravely upon him, but
whether with scorn or approval he could not for the life of him
guess.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>In spite of his conviction that he was too excited to sleep,
Leslie dropped off promptly enough once his head had touched the
pillow. Indeed he would probably have slept until noon had he not
been awakened by a persistent shaking of his shoulder. He opened
his eyes drowsily. Diego, one of the housemen, stood at his
bedside, a tray with chocolate in his hands, showing all his teeth
in a smile.</p>

<p>"The <i>patron</i> sends his good morning," said he, "and would
request your presence as soon as your excellency shall be pleased
to dress."</p>

<p>"What time is it, Diego?"</p>

<p>"Midmorning, señor."</p>

<p>Ashamed of his laziness, Leslie threw aside the bedclothes.
"Tell señor Burnett I shall be there soon. Is there any news of the
strangers?"</p>

<p><i>"N</i><i>ada, nada, señor."</i> Diego spread wide his hands.
"Now that the <i>patron</i> is here," he added comfortably, "all
will be well."</p>

<p>Leslie swallowed his chocolate, dressed hastily. After a
moment's hesitation he resisted the temptation to buckle on the
Colt's revolving pistol. Examining the reason for this, he
discovered it to be based on Amata's cool scorn which had lately
made him a little shy of what his host called "foofaraw." So
defiantly he did buckle it on and set out.</p>

<p>Leslie found nobody in the hall of the <i>casa.</i> Outside the
door were the Doña Carmel, Djo, and Amata. They greeted him,
exchanging with him news of the night's rest, brief
speculation.</p>

<p>"Don Andreo comes presently," said Carmel.</p>

<p>Leslie noticed two saddled horses awaiting in charge of
Panchito, who was afoot. One of them was a beautiful creature he
had not seen before, a "silver horse," a <i>palomino,</i> of creamy
buckskin color with silver-white mane and tail which had been
water-braided so that they rippled in waves. The animal bore a
saddle which, to Leslie, was likewise strange: an elaborate affair
of carved leather ornamented with silver and colored embroidery,
the stirrups hooded with leather in long points that all but
touched the ground. Djo caught Leslie's glance of admiration.</p>

<p>"It is Lucero," he said of the horse. "He is very old. He
carried <i>mi padre</i> and <i>mi madre</i> when they were married,
so they say. He must be twenty-five years old."</p>

<p>"He does not look it," said Leslie in admiration. Lucero's head
was high, his small fine ears slanted in dainty but alert virtue,
his velvet nostrils wide, his eyes fixed in haughty pride on
something far away and invisible.</p>

<p>"He is proud that he is ridden," said Carmel simply.</p>

<p>"That do not happen so often now. Only for ceremony."</p>

<p>The door opened and closed behind them. Andy appeared.</p>

<p><i>"Querido!"</i> gasped Carmel. Leslie stared with all his
eyes.</p>

<p>From the top of his head to the tip of his toes the
<i>ranchero</i> was transformed. Gone were the drab and utilitarian
garments to which Leslie was accustomed. Only the wide flat hat was
the same, and to that had been added a wide ribbon, with a rosette,
that passed under the chin. The upper part of his body was clad in
a short jacket heavily laced with silver that reached hardly to the
waist and failed by several inches to meet in front. Beneath it was
a loose white shirt of fine linen and a wide red sash that
encircled closely the waist and hips. Below Andy wore
<i>calzoneras</i> of velvet&mdash;the pantaloons slashed down the
side&mdash;but over them he had drawn <i>botas</i> of soft
particolored leather that would reach to the middle of the thigh.
However, they had been doubled over until they came to just below
the knee, where they were held by garters, They were soled with
rawhide, which had been led over to cover the toes and heels with
the purpose of protecting the former against the stirrup hood and
to support the huge spurs on the latter. One of the garters carried
a knife in a sheath. Otherwise, as far as could be seen, Andy was
unarmed.</p>

<p><i>"Querida!"</i> repeated Carmel, but now less on a note of
surprise than of pleasure. Leslie could not help but share her
evident admiration, for undoubtedly the <i>ranchero,</i> with his
tall spare body and the darkly handsome gravity of his face, made a
fine figure of a man. Andy flashed the briefest grin in
appreciation of their surprise.</p>

<p>"I got this place as a <i>californio,"</i> said he with a
certain grimness.</p>

<p>Carmel's brows drew together, but Leslie's ardent spirit caught
the half explanation and glowed in response. He looked toward Djo.
Djo, too, understood. And as a <i>californio</i> Andy intended to
hold it, or not at all.</p>

<p>Andy swung into the saddle of <i>the palomino,</i> who pricked
forward his ears, but otherwise made no motion. Djo stepped forward
as a matter of course to mount the other horse.</p>

<p>"Not you," said Andy, "Leslie." Djo stopped in dumfounded
surprise, unable to believe his ears. "I want you to stay with your
mother and sister&mdash;and the <i>casa,"</i> Andy explained.
"Leslie is a government officer. I want an official witness."</p>

<p>His tone was curt and businesslike. He caught Carmel's unspoken
alarm. "There'll be no trouble," he assured her, "not now. Leslie
and I are just going scouting. I wouldn't take him with me if there
was going to be any trouble." He noticed the Colt's revolving
pistol. "Take that thing off," he ordered. "Give it to Djo. We're
not on the war-path&mdash;yet."</p>

<p>Leslie obeyed, acutely conscious of Amata's silent scrutiny. Her
face was unreadable. She had not uttered a word. But he sensed a
faint underlying feminine triumph of some kind that had no reason,
He scrambled into his saddle rather more hastily than he had meant
to do, and the horse, shied sideways and all but eluded his swing
into the saddle. He did not hear what else was said before the
<i>ranchero</i> turned his horse down the hill. He was too angry,
not so much with that solemn-eyed little brat of a child as with
himself for being bothered by what such an insect thought. Or what
he thought she thought; she never said anything, come to think of
it.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>"We are going," said Andy when Leslie had caught up and drawn
alongside, "to find out what this is all about. So you let me do
the talking. You keep your ears open. Understand?" He spoke not
unkindly, but with a certain deadly directness that silenced
Leslie, except for his assent.</p>

<p>They rode down the hill. Leslie's heart beat strongly; he
fidgeted in the saddle; he hoped his hands did not tremble, nor his
voice. He was not frightened, but tremendously excited, and he had
no outlet. What would happen in the next hour? What sort of people
were these into whose camp they were riding so confidently? What
would be their own reception? What did Andy intend? What if these
people&mdash;if Ransom&mdash;turned ugly, and they unarmed? He
glanced sidewise with envy of his companion's calm and steady
assurance. Apparently Andy had not a nerve in his body. The
<i>palomino</i> stepped daintily in pride, his small ears swinging
rhythmically to his pace, the rollers of his bit champing over and
over in the animal's blissful content.</p>

<p>They reached the flat of the valley and rode down the length of
the ditch that served the grainfield in lieu of a fence. They came
in time to a dozen long and rakish wagons, with canvas covers over
their bows, drawn up in a loose circle. Within the circle were
fires and a great scattering of gear of all sorts and a number of
people. Beyond, on the slope of a hill, grazed a band of horses in
charge of a mounted man. Leaning against the wagon wheels on the
outside of the circle nearest the visitors, squatted on their heels
in the shade of the wagon bodies, perched on the wagon tongues,
were over a score of men. They wore broad slouch hats, floppy from
use, dark garments. In their hands they one and all carried
long-barreled rifles or other weapons. Their attitude was of stolid
expectation.</p>

<p>Andy's eyes roved keenly over every detail of the scene before
him. Leslie's intuitions, sharpened by the thrill of expectation,
could almost feel the working of the strange, sure mechanism of the
man's perceptions. He was suddenly seized by a great curiosity, for
he sensed here a skill of which he knew nothing.</p>

<p>"What do you make of them, sir?" He could not restrain his
inquiry.</p>

<p>"They&mdash;someone&mdash;knows their business," muttered Andy,
as though more than half to himself. "They've fit injuns&mdash;or
some of them have. The way they got their wagons"&mdash;he yielded
to Leslie's unspoken but evident question&mdash;"the way they got
together to meet us&mdash;must have scouts out to watch what we're
up to&mdash;rifles, none of your farmer blunderbusses." He turned
to Leslie. "I don't <i>sabe</i> this," he confessed. He touched the
<i>palomino</i> with his heel. "Let's go see what it is all about.
Don't seem reasonable-like, but maybe we'll have to strike the post
a'ter all."</p>

<p>"The post?" echoed Leslie.</p>

<p>"War post," said Andy briefly.</p>

<p>"You mean fight?"</p>

<p>Andy grinned wholeheartedly at the expression of his face.</p>

<p>"Not right this minute, bub," said he.</p>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>Chapter 9</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>THEY rode up to the lounging men and stopped. Leslie thought he
had never seen such a hard-bitten lot. They were all over the
average in height. They wore slouch hats and clothes of homespun,
the trousers tucked into the tops of rough cowhide boots. In or on
the belts at their waists was a variety of knives and pistols.
Their lean cheeks were stubbled or completely unshaven. They said
nothing, nor moved, but stared with a sullen hostility, their jaws
moving slowly on their tobacco quids. Beyond them, inside the
circle formed by the covered wagons, Leslie saw women and girls in
shapeless calico and sunbonnets and small children in single
garments; and all these, too, had stopped short in whatever they
were doing and had frozen to immobility and now stared. It seemed
to the young man that he could almost feel the physical impact of
those challenging eyes.</p>

<p>"You men are welcome to camp on my property as long as it suits
you," said Andy clearly. "Keep your animals out of the wheat. Clean
up after you when you move on."</p>

<p>His words fell without effect, as though into the darkness of a
bottomless well. Noone moved; it almost seemed that no one winked.
Except for the slow movement of their jaws these might have been
figures of wax. Finally one spat, passed his hand over his
beard.</p>

<p>"We ain't aimin' to move on," said this one with a certain
leaden finality. "This ain't yore land."</p>

<p>"No?" said Andy softly.</p>

<p>"No." returned the man.</p>

<p>Several of the loungers stirred slightly, as though in
expectation, Andy made no reply. He waited.</p>

<p>"You greasers are licked," said the man after a time. "You don't
own this kentry no more. This bottom land is ours. Keep off'n it.
We don't like trespassers."</p>

<p>"Are you the boss of this outfit?" Andy's voice was mild, devoid
of resentment.</p>

<p>"Ef'n I'm not, you kin talk to me till the boss comes
along."</p>

<p>"Well, I want you to understand that you are on private land,
that you are trespassing, and I serve you warning to get out."</p>

<p>One of the younger men laughed briefly but instantly sobered.
The spokesman spat insolently in the direction of the
<i>palomino.</i> Lucero tossed his head with a snort. Andy soothed
the animal with the palm of his hand.</p>

<p>"Look yere, greaser," said the Missourian, "we don't want no
trouble, but we ain't dodging any. We're American citizens, and we
know our rights. This yere ain't yore land. It belongs to the
guv'ment, and we've tuk up on it accordin' to law, and yere we're
goin' to stay. We don't aim to move for your say-so, and we don't
aim to bother you. Not while you behave. Is that clear?"</p>

<p>"Just one thing," said Andy. "Why do you say it's not my
land?"</p>

<p>"Because it ain't!" cried one of the younger men fiercely.
"Ain't we done conkered the kentry!"</p>

<p>But the leader silenced him with a gesture.</p>

<p>"Ransom!" He raised his voice. "Hi! Ransom! Whar be ye?"</p>

<p>From one of the covered wagons on the far side of the circle
Ransom slowly descended, rubbing his eyes ostentatiously, as though
just awakened, though both Andy and Leslie knew he had not been
asleep. He sauntered across the circle, slipped between the wagons,
and surveyed the two visitors with an insolent but veiled
triumph.</p>

<p>"This yere jaybird wants to know why this yere ain't his land,"
said the Missourian. "You tell him."</p>

<p>Ransom bared his fangs with an evil smile. He rattled off an
impressive-sounding rigmarole of technicalities, to which his own
audience listened with profound respect and as profound
incomprehension; Leslie with growing indignation and an almost
uncontrollable urge to break in with what even his slender legal
knowledge told him was good refutation; Andy, apparently, not at
all. Before Ransom had finished his speech the <i>ranchero</i>
lifted his bridle hand. The <i>palomino</i> half reared, carried
his forelegs about in a complete half circle until he faced the
other way, set his hoofs down as lightly as a thistledown, paced
away. Andy did not look back. Leslie followed, somewhat awkwardly,
the spectacle of Ransom's significant leer in his eyes.</p>

<p>Ransom watched the pair of them ride away. He spat. "What'd I
tell you?" he challenged. "He won't make no trouble. And if he
does&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I reckon we-all can take keer of it," said the bearded man, not
without a certain dignity.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>Leslie was boiling over with indignation, which he voiced as
soon as he caught up. This whole business was outrageous: it would
not stand for any moment in any court in the land; even assuming
the title was defective, it had not been declared so, and the land
could, by no theory, be considered open to filing or to settlement
until so declared; a good lawyer, a writ of trespass, or ejectment,
or whatever it was...So far from his sense of civilized equities,
the orderliness of his education, the smattering of legalisms as to
the land he had picked up from his week in Judge McCain's office.
He fell silent. He saw that Andy was paying to him no more
attention than to the wind through the trees.</p>

<p>They drew rein at the edge of the wide live oak before the door
of the <i>casa.</i> With the exception of certain of the
<i>vaqueros</i> out on the range, of the <i>mozas</i> at the stream
bank, and of the Indians of the <i>milpas,</i> the entire personnel
of the <i>rancho</i> had gathered, waiting for news of the
<i>patron's</i> excursion. They stood about, and near the doorway
of the <i>casa</i> were Carmel and Djo and his sister and a few of
the more privileged of the house servants. They were silent with
anxiety, for none knew what this excursion might portend, though
all had heard rumors, until now little considered, of similar
doings nearer the Bay.</p>

<p>Andy paid them no attention. His eyes passed them over,
identified Djo. He summoned Djo with a slight lift of the head and
dismounted. A <i>mozo</i> led away the <i>palomino</i> and Leslie's
horse. After a moment of hesitation Leslie followed his host.</p>

<p>Andy squatted on his heels, his forearms on his knees, his hands
hanging. Djo took a similar position opposite him. Leslie, to whom
this posture was impossible for long at a time, leaned against the
tree trunk. As Andy talked he scraped together bits of twig, of
bark, of dried leaves from the ground litter, heaped them in a
little pile. He produced a pipe, which he lighted with a flint and
steel and a string of tinder, and when he had finished this he
ignited the heap of debris he had scraped together, so that in a
moment it hurst into flame, and blue smoke arose composedly in the
air currents of the branches overhead. He did this as though
mechanically, and thereafter from time to time he reached out his
long arm at appropriate intervals to retrieve another bit of fuel
by which to keep alive his council fire. For that was what it was.
In the fire and the pipe, had Leslie known it, he was seeing
welling up from the man's subconscious, in response to emergency,
old forgotten ceremony that had met emergency in a past long
gone.</p>

<p>Andy talked directly to Djo, who listened gravely and without
comment.</p>

<p>"Twenty-two men," said he. "Fourteen grooved bar'ls and some
smooth bores. Sixteen wagons. <i>Remuda</i> on the
sidehills&mdash;less'n a hundred hosses. No oxen. Three men that's
seen sarvice on the plains&mdash;rest greenhorns, exceptin' what
experience they got crossing. Used to backwoods, though. Squirrel
and deer shots." He spoke slowly, in a voice and vernacular whose
smooth drawl Leslie did not recognize, for it, too, was reminiscent
of old, less grammatical days. Djo nodded understanding of the
points raised and the conclusions reached. Leslie did not
understand some of them. He marveled at the man's detailed
observation, the things Andy had noticed while he himself had been
preoccupied with indignations. Shortly Andy had finished,
methodically, his recital of what he had seen. As simply he went on
to his deductions and conclusions, speaking always slowly,
detachedly, almost as though of things that did not concern him,
but which he must proffer.</p>

<p>"This man Ransom," he said, "he's back of them. He brought 'em
here. It's his way of making trouble, of getting even. That's why
he brought 'em so far; brought 'em here. That's what he's been up
to. That's why he came here before. That's why he was here a while
back, before the rodeo, when you boys saw him." Andy's eyes were
blank with inner concentration. "He's no farmer," he continued
after a moment. <i>"And</i> he's no fighter," he added. He puffed
thoughtfully on the almost extinct tobacco in his pipe until it was
well alight again. <i>"He</i> wa'n't looking for a pot shot at you
boys," he resumed, "though he might have took one ef'n he'd had a
good chance. No, he was a'ter other game. Scouting around. The lay
of the land. And I'd bet you this: I'd bet if you'd have rummaged
his possible sack you'd have found he'd a copy of the
records&mdash;like Leslie has of Constansio's. He knowed more about
those fuzzy boundaries than you boys did&mdash;finding out whether
he had a good excuse to come." Andy spoke slowly, as though groping
a way.</p>

<p>Leslie started forward to interpose, He wanted to repeat that
the mere indeterminateness of the grant, of the <i>diseño,</i>
meant nothing until illegality was properly established. He stopped
short as though checked by a curb. He looked about at the waiting
people. They stood with scarce a motion, without a sound, their
eyes fixed upon the squatting figures on either side the tiny fire.
From the doorway the women of the household likewise watched, with
the same attentive suspense. Leslie had a curious feeling that he
had been saved from a grave indiscretion of some sort.</p>

<p>"And he's no farmer," the slow drawl resumed after a moment. "He
did not corne to farm, like these other critters. He came for pay.
And he came here to git even. So," was Andy's unexpected
conclusion, "it ain't him we got to bother about. Now we got that
straight."</p>

<p>He tapped out the ashes from his pipe. The action seemed to
terminate that something with which Leslie could not interfere. He
spoke up at last. Andy turned on him blank eyes of total
incomprehension.</p>

<p>"Lawyer?" he repeated. "Lawyer? Ef'n I can't take keer of what
belongs to me, I certainly ain't going running to ary lawyer! This
gang's got no right now to whar they are, title or no title,
boundaries or no boundaries&mdash;ain't that what you said?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then, by the 'tarnal, off they get, and thar's no more to be
said!" Andy for the first time spoke with a deadly unleashed
passion. But immediately he regained his sardonic calm. "We'll talk
lawyer when the time comes," said he.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>Andy seemed to regain touch with his immediate surroundings. Up
to this moment it was as though he had been communing with
himself.</p>

<p>"Come," said he, "let's hold council."</p>

<p>He looked about him, searching identities among those who stood
in expectation.</p>

<p>"Panchito," he summoned, "and you, Benito. And Means. Where is
Abel Means?"</p>

<p>"Coming, boss," said the old ex-sailor and millwright, moving
into view.</p>

<p>Without command a <i>mozo</i> stepped forward with an armful of
fuel. He rebuilt carefully the haphazard little fire into an
orderly blaze and withdrew. Andy and Djo arose from squatting on
their heels and took their places on one of the wooden benches.
Those summoned occupied the other, holding their broad hats in
their laps. At a gesture of invitation from Djo, Leslie joined the
<i>ranchero</i> and his son. The gathered peoples of the
<i>rancho</i> held their places, gazing with a dumb expectancy. In
the doorway Leslie caught a glimpse of the Doña Carmel, her smooth
brows knit with repressed anxiety, and he thought it strange she
was not included in this conference that must affect her so deeply.
He could not know that again he witnessed a reversion to old days,
to old habits so deeply grooved that in emergency life flowed
through them as naturally as waters in a channel. If Leslie had
possessed that sort of second sight, so that realities had clothed
themselves to him in their outward seeming, his vision would have
been of cowled warriors, and the smoke of the calumet rising to
mingle with the smoke of the ceremonial fires, and in the
background the women who could take no part in council.</p>

<p>Matters, said Andy, speaking in Spanish, are thus and so. He
described the situation as he had observed it in the squatters'
camp.</p>

<p>"There are of them," he enumerated, "twenty-two men armed to
fight. We have here three&mdash;four," he corrected himself, "who
know the business of the rifle and pistol, and a dozen with lance
and <i>reata.</i> To use the lance and <i>reata</i> one must ride
close, and these men are skilled <i>rifleros</i>. We cannot attack
them. Nor," said Andy, "if they should themselves attack the
<i>rancho</i> could we prevent its capture. It is possible we might
hold them from the <i>casa</i> for a time, but only for a time." He
glanced from one to the other, assuring himself that he was fully
understood. "It is not probable that they will attack us unless we
provoke them to it. Therefore, that is the first thing that must be
told the people: that they must do nothing to provoke these men.
That is understood?"</p>

<p>He challenged each with a look. They nodded.</p>

<p>"Each is responsible for his own people," said Andy.</p>

<p>"Until the time comes when we are ready, all must go on as
usual. Is there anyone on the <i>rancho</i> who cannot be trusted
to be quiet? One word of what we shall be doing," he warned, "one
word to make these people suspicious that we are not afraid of
them, that we have not given up because we are afraid of them, that
they aren't going to have their own way&mdash;they'll be up here.
You, Panchito, your <i>vaqueros.</i> Are they all to be
trusted?"</p>

<p>"As myself, <i>patron,"</i> growled the major-domo.</p>

<p>"How about your people, Abel?"</p>

<p>The millwright spat copiously into the fire. "I'll answer for
what men there be," said he in English, "but I won't be responsible
for no women."</p>

<p>"This isn't women's business," said Andy. "Benito?"</p>

<p>The moonfaced master of the fields and dairies smiled
comfortably, waved his hands. He seemed to think this sufficient
reply. When Andy spoke next it was with the staccato snap of
command.</p>

<p>"Three of the <i>vaqueros</i> will come to me after dark. Mount
them well. They will carry messages," he said to Panchito. "Eight
of your best Indians"&mdash;he turned to Benito&mdash;"they will
watch these people, two by two, for four hours at a time for each
two. One will come to me if there is anything unusual, while the
other remains to watch. They must not be discovered. Abel," he said
to Means, still in Spanish, so the others might understand, "your
business is around and near the <i>casa.</i> You're <i>sabio.</i>
Leave all your other affairs for this: that you watch always that
matters go on as they have always done and that nothing happens out
of the ordinary. Three of these men are old Indian fighters," he
added in English; "I can see that, and it mout be they'd do a
little scouting on their own hook. Leastwise for a day or two till
they're satisfied we're skeered to make trouble. And you tell 'em,
specially the youngsters, that if I hear of ary one of 'em as much
as <i>lookin'</i> down that hill, I'll skin 'em alive."</p>

<p>"You won't need to," said Means grimly; "they'll he already
skun."</p>

<p>"That is all for now, until we are ready," said Andy, again in
Spanish. "It is important that we have time. If these
<i>ladrones</i> should get it into their heads to attack us before
we are ready, we would have to get out, And the saints know what
they might not do here." He looked about at the <i>casa</i> and its
surroundings. "Has anyone anything to say?"</p>

<p>The <i>californios</i> looked questioningly at one another.</p>

<p>"Are we then not to fight, señor?" growled Panchito.</p>

<p>It was Abel Means who spoke up before Andy could reply.</p>

<p>"You'll get plenty of fighting; don't worry," said he dryly.</p>

<p>"'He who would enter a low door must stoop,'" quoted Benito
comfortably.</p>

<p>Andy looked at him with approval.</p>

<p>"That's it," said he, "and this one may be so low you may have
to crawl on your belly. Very well, crawl."</p>

<p><i>"Señor Padre"-</i>it was Djo, speaking up rather hesitatingly
and using the ceremonial form.</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"My mother, my sister. Would it not be well that we send them
for a while to visit at the <i>hacienda</i> or at Los Madrones with
my uncle Ramon and the Doña Conchita?"</p>

<p>"No," said Andy.</p>

<p>"But if these <i>ladrones</i> do attack us&mdash;and they
here&mdash;</p>

<p>"No," repeated Andy. His eyes, it seemed to Leslie, were like
flints, so hard were their outer surfaces. But after a moment he
yielded to explanation. "If it warn't for that old he-coon and his
pair of Injun fighters, I'd say yes. But they'll be watchin' for a
move like that. We've got to keep 'em quiet, and nothing will do
that better than keeping our women and children here;" He laid his
hand on Djo's arm. "I know, son. It's dangerous. But this is
war&mdash;We've struck the post. And don't you worry"&mdash;he
extended his great fist, opened and shut it slowly&mdash;"I aim to
take keer of my own."</p>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>Chapter 10</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>LESLIE seemed to himself to be living in a strange, unreal world
of double consciousness. On the surface things went on much as
usual on the <i>rancho.</i> It stirred to life about daylight; it
moved with spacious leisure through the day; it withdrew early to
the darkness of repose. The sun soaked the hours that passed to the
droning of bees. The people rode or walked about their affairs
gently, with space for the leisure of little courtesies. Down by
the wash stones at the stream bed the <i>mozas</i> laughed and
chattered. The <i>vaqueros</i> rode out, or in, to a jangling of
spurs and bit chains. In the bottom lands Benito's Indians bent
over their hoes. Benito himself went about his leisurely
preparations to harvest the barley. About the <i>casa</i> the
numerous retainers attended their business, chattering soft-voiced,
or singing. The Doña Carmel's gracious figure was everywhere about
the place, her smooth brow placid beneath her smoothed hair. The
girl, Amata, was much with her.</p>

<p>This was one of the small differences&mdash;that for the time
being the girl, Amata, rode no more abroad. Nor did the
<i>ranchero</i> himself. Andy sat most of the day on one of the
benches beneath the live-oak tree, where he smoked and talked
occasionally to people who came to him. But such trifles could be
noticeable only to a familiar. To a stranger it must have seemed
that affairs moved in the quiet old routine.</p>

<p>But Leslie sensed beneath this surface of accustomedness a
vibrant taut swiftness of action, an inner expectation behind the
drowsy eyes, gathered muscles beneath the slow, lazy movement of
life. Something peeped out from studied reticences. For nobody
talked. They waited.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>The surface was only a surface. Surprising things sometimes
thrust themselves above it for a moment. As when Leslie, restless
for some reason, and unable to sleep, arose from his bed and
wandered outside the <i>casa</i> in the thought that the night air
might make him drowsy, and so came face to face with Djo. Or rather
Djo came face to face with him as he stood motionless in the
shadow. Leslie was startled. After a moment's hesitation Djo burst
out laughing. He choked back the sound.</p>

<p>"What on earth!" cried Leslie, dumfounded.</p>

<p>"Hush!" warned Djo. He seized Leslie by the elbow and drew him
down the colonnade and into his own room. He shut the heavy door
carefully. Then he laughed again at Leslie's expression.</p>

<p>Djo was dressed in black, from head to foot. On his feet he wore
deerskin moccasins. His face and hands had been rubbed with
charcoal, and from this mask his gray eyes and white teeth flashed
grotesquely.</p>

<p>"What on earth!" repeated Leslie helplessly.</p>

<p>Djo explained with relish, while he splashed water from the ewer
into the basin. Scouting...the squatters' camp...crawling, inch by
inch, until he lay fairly inside the enemy lines, so near he could
hear the men's breathing. The most exciting fun in the world! Djo
spoke with pride of the <i>ranchero's</i> confidence in him to do
this delicate job.</p>

<p>"My father trained me to do it," said he. "My father learned
these things from the Indians, over the mountains. No
<i>california</i> could do it. I have once&mdash;when I was a
boy&mdash;made my way into the <i>milpas</i> by daylight, and the
Indians and Benito working there, and carried away vegetables. When
I played <i>wild man.</i> I'll tell it to you someday. That was
just a game. If I was caught at it, it would not matter much: I
just lost the game. But now"&mdash;Djo chuckled&mdash;"I wonder
what <i>would</i> happen?"</p>

<p>"Does the Doña Carmel know of this?"</p>

<p>"Heaven forbid!" Djo was alarmed. "You must not breathe a word
to her."</p>

<p>"I won't," promised Leslie.</p>

<p>Djo had finished scrubbing his face. He sat on the edge of his
bed.</p>

<p>"It's not difficult now," said he. "There's no sentry. They've
made up their minds we've knuckled down. They stood sentries at
first. And they're sound sleepers. I'm more scared of the dogs.
Though they don't pay much attention to the dogs, either. They're
always answering back at the coyotes."</p>

<p>"How long you been at this?" asked Leslie, astonished.</p>

<p>"Every night."</p>

<p>"But why?" To Leslie it seemed that one, or at most two, visits
should be ample to gather any desired information. What could there
be to know? "What are you looking for? What do you do?"</p>

<p>"I know," said Djo impressively, "exactly where every man
sleeps, and how he sleeps, and how easy he is to wake. It wasn't
two days before I knew exactly the habits of the place. I could go
in there blindfolded and lay my hand on any man&mdash;or woman or
child, for that matter&mdash;you have a mind to name. I know just
where each man keeps his weapons, and how. I know where each horse
is tied. By golly, I mighty near know where every man lays his quid
when he turns in!" He laughed to conceal his genuine pride of
achievement; for, though he was pleased to impress his friend, he
did not wish to appear to do so.</p>

<p>"What you keep on going for, if you knew all about it in two
days?" asked Leslie sensibly. "You're bound to get caught."</p>

<p>"I won't get caught," said Djo, who was a trifle above himself
from the release of strain.</p>

<p>"Well, a dog'll bite you, anyway," insisted Leslie.</p>

<p>Djo laughed. "That might be," he admitted. "I'll tell you. My
father sends me backto see if there is any change. What I mean is,
if the arrangements are always the same, or if they shift around
any&mdash;if a man sleeps here one night and there the
next&mdash;that sort of thing."</p>

<p>"I see," said Leslie. "Do they?"</p>

<p>"Not to amount to anything."</p>

<p>"How long do you keep this up?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Until my father tells me. I don't know. He does
not talk."</p>

<p>"I wish I knew enough to help," said Leslie from a mixture of
humility and envy. He hesitated before possible indiscretion.
"What's he going to do? Do you know?"</p>

<p>"Nobody knows but <i>mi padre,"</i> Djo answered readily enough.
"He is like that." He yawned. "Golly, I'm sleepy!" said he.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>Every few hours, with the change of watch, the two Indians who
had lain in the brush spying reported to Andy, sitting under the
live-oak tree. At irregular intervals one of those on duty came in
to tell of the departure of some of the intruders from their camp.
Then Andy sent out one of his people to discover at least the
direction of their errand. This was done not by following after
them, which must surely be discovered, for the <i>californios</i>
were little skilled in concealment, but by arranging to cut across
their trail, or to meet them as though by accident. The excursions
proved invariably to be in search of meat. The hills were full of
deer. Most of the older bucks had by now climbed to the higher
peaks, but the lower country still harbored many spikes and forked
horns and there were, of course, plenty of does. The latter were
heavy with fawn, but the Missourians made no distinctions.
Curiously, this appeared to arouse Djo's indignation&mdash;at least
his surface indignation&mdash;more even than the trespass.</p>

<p>Djo had been brought up by Andy in the utilitrian sportsmanship
of the pioneer and Indian, and it was so deeply ingrained as to
have ceased to be conscious. He reacted as automatically as to an
instinct. Andy stopped sending him on these errands. Djo alone of
the ranch people was able actually to follow unobserved and be
witness of whatever was doing, but this was unimportant. Few days
passed without such an expedition toward the hills. The parties
were generally of a half dozen or so&mdash;probably for protection
against possible "treachery" by the ranch people with pack horses.
The faint far sound of their rifles could be heard at intervals
throughout the day. They brought back the pack horses laden, and
often some of the horsemen carried a carcass before him across his
saddle. These small coast-range blacktails did not dress a hundred
pounds. First and last they slaughtered a great many deer, and day
by day the sound of the rifles sounded fainter as the game was
decimated or withdrew from the nearer hills.</p>

<p>Djo chafed bitterly, for to him its game was a part of Folded
Hills. But Andy, remembering perhaps old days of "living on the
country," showed no impatience, Indeed he seemed impervious to
indignations that periodically shook those around him. He appeared
to survey them from a preoccupation in more important things.
Panchito's men found indubitable evidence that the meat parties
were, at least occasionally, killing cattle. Andy nodded.</p>

<p>"I've been expecting that," he said to Djo and Leslie; "the deer
are getting scarce&mdash;or being druv back. They got to eat, and
cattle are easier."</p>

<p>"What shall we do, señor?" asked Panchito.</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Andy. "Nothing!" he repeated in the sharp
accents of command as he saw Panchito's face. The <i>vaquero</i>
rode away grumbling.</p>

<p>Down in the bottom lands, the Indians reported, the intruders
were cutting down the trees. They were building houses, corrals,
splitting rails for fences! A madness, señor, what with the adobe
underfoot and greasewood at hand, and a ditch needs only digging!
Nevertheless, if one listened, one could hear the rhythmical
ringing clop of the axes. This stirred Carmel as the sounds of the
distant rifles among the deer stirred Djo. These lower groves were
dear to her, for there the subsoil drainage from the hills
nourished the oaks and sycamores and cottonwoods to a greater
height and size, and it was there were held the <i>meriendas.</i>
The sound of the axes&mdash;like the sound of the rifles&mdash;was
so very faint and far that the slightest nearer noises, a
preoccupation of mind even, were sufficient to submerge it. One had
to listen to hear it at all. Yet it seemed to Carmel that she must
listen and that each blow was struck at her heart.</p>

<p>"Cannot we do something to stop it?" she cried.</p>

<p>"Not yet," said Andy.</p>

<p>And the placid and comfortable Benito came wringing his hands.
The horses of these <i>ladrones</i> had invaded the lower wheat and
barley fields. They had broken down the ditches. They were
trampling the nearly ripened grain, bedding in it, eating it down
like grass.</p>

<p>"And the hills fat with <i>alfileria, señor!"</i> lamented
Benito.</p>

<p>Should he not send down <i>los indios</i> to drive the animals
out<i>?</i></p>

<p>"Not yet," said Andy. And Benito, too, went away sullen, for he
had come to Folded Hills when they were wilderness, and the
grainfields had become more his children than the dozen or so grown
men and women who carried his name.</p>

<p>So the anger of each grew, nourished by his own, which was
perhaps what Andy intended; or his reticence until the time of
accomplishment might have been a throwback to old days when a
warrior kept his counsel, or it might, more simply, have been a
precaution against some tattle reaching the squatters untimely.
Though everyone on the <i>rancho</i> knew that the <i>patron</i>
was not one to sit tamely under aggression.</p>

<p>Only to Abel Means, the millwright, did Andy partly open his
mind. The ex-sailor showed no curiosity. Andy knew he never talked,
even of unimportant things. Yet not even to Abel Means did the
<i>ranchero</i> disclose his full thought until the thought was
formed. Then he summoned the millwright, and the two sat under the
oak, their heads together. Occasionally Means nodded or spat in the
fire. Now that the time for action was nearing Andy spread his plan
out, not so much for the opinion of criticism as for his own
examination.</p>

<p>"You know and I know, Abel," said Andy, exaggerating his trapper
drawl after his fashion when talking to old-timers, like Means,
"that twenty good men with rifles, ahind wagons, can stand off a
power of people like ours. The <i>californio</i> is a brave man and
a good fighter, no matter what they say. He's not skeered to die
ef'n he means business. But he's got no arms, and he hasn't got the
habit of using arms. Greatest hoss fighters in the world, as I've
always said, give 'em a chance. I suppose we could get together
enough men, even without rifles, to ride over 'em. But we'd get a
lot of men killed doing it. No question of that. These Missouri
backwoodsmen are good shots. So I've been studying on something
else."</p>

<p>"Yes?" said Abel Means.</p>

<p>"Ef'n we had a half-dozen more used to the rifle and trained up
to Injun fighting, we could make it. I sent Djo down to look 'em
over. I figgered maybe we could do a night surprise, or early
morning. But Djo and I are about the only ones around here could
make it to get close enough without being diskivered. You couldn't
do it?" he said on a note of inquiry.</p>

<p>"I'm a sailor," said Abel Means, who had not touched foot to
deck for eighteen years.</p>

<p>"Even three'd be too few, anyway. Needs at least a half a dozen
to hold 'em till the riders could get in. Then I tried to figger a
way to git'em out of that on hossback. Ef'n we could git 'em on
hossback out in the open, I'd guarantee to deliver 'em, tied up, in
ten minutes. Ef'n it was only these backwoodsmen, that would be
easy: they're terrible greenhorns when it comes to open-kentry
fighting. But they got three pretty <i>sabe</i> plainsmen in the
lot. They wouldn't toll out of cover for a cent, not if they knew
their business like I think they do. So I let that go. And then it
struck me that a man does his best when he works with nature, uses
the strong p'ints for him instead of agin him. These folks have two
strong p'ints&mdash;their rifles and their three plainsmen. So I'm
going to use 'em."</p>

<p>"Anon?" queried Means, justifiably puzzled.</p>

<p>"A plainsman don't know a thing about cattle, but he knows a
heap about buffalo," said Andy. He bent closer, speaking low,
glancing about from time to time to be sure nobody could hear.</p>

<p>"Have you got enough?" asked Means.</p>

<p>"Enough are on the way," said Andy.</p>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>Chapter 11</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>THE day after this conference a <i>vaquero</i> rode in at full
speed to report a great cloud of dust on the slopes of the ranges
toward Jolon, as though an army were advancing.</p>

<p>"Or maybe cattle, fool," said Panchito scornfully. "Go back to
your business."</p>

<p>By noon the dust cloud had rolled lazily forward until its fog
was on the lower hills of the <i>rancho.</i> At this time Ramon
Rivera rode in at an easy lope, a <i>vaquero</i> at his heels. He
swung from his saddle a little heavily, for Ramon had not Andy's
youthful hard condition, but with a bubbling effervescence of
spirit that was still young.</p>

<p>"We come, <i>amigo!"</i> he cried gaily. "All I could gather so
quickly. And fifteen good riders. Where would you have them?"</p>

<p>"The upper <i>prado;</i> Panchito will show your men."</p>

<p>"Shall they be held?"</p>

<p>"Let them graze. But keep some riders with them to see that they
do not scatter too much. It may be two days yet."</p>

<p>Ramon nodded, turned to give instructions to his <i>vaquero,</i>
who rode away.</p>

<p>"And the others?" Andy asked, when the man had departed.</p>

<p>"They come, and gladly," said Ramon in English. "Tomorrow, I
think. Don Jose Constansio, yes; the Cermenos, yes; also those from
El Chapitel <i>rancho,</i> and those others those could tell. Those
three will bring the many cow, as you have said, but I think also
will come a many of men from the <i>ranchos</i> that are too far to
send the cow."</p>

<p>Andy looked anxious, Ramon noticed.</p>

<p>"Do not be escare, <i>valedor,"</i> said he reassuringly.
"Nobody know the why but you, but me, but the Don Jose, but Don
Nicolas Cermenos"&mdash;he counted each on a finger&mdash;"and Don
Pedro of El Chapitel. Just those. All other come because it is told
that Don Largo have <i>matanza."</i> Ramon laid his finger aside
his nose <i>"matanza&mdash;</i>what you call? The killing&mdash;of
many cow. Oh yes! That Don Largo give the <i>fiesta,</i> ask them
to come to the killing."</p>

<p><i>"Fiesta!"</i> Andy was still more uneasy. "This is no time
for women."</p>

<p>"No woman; man <i>fiesta,"</i> Ramon said solemnly, then
laughed. "It is all right, <i>amigo.</i> Nobody going talk."</p>

<p>"I hope not," grumbled Andy. "Well, come on; Carmel will want to
see you."</p>

<p>"You tell Carmelita?" asked Ramon.</p>

<p>"No, nobody. Not even Djo."</p>

<p>Ramon shook his head.</p>

<p>"You are like&mdash;what you call&mdash;the clam,
<i>valedor,</i> and that is not good for all peoples, only for
those you do not love. You mus' tell Carmelita," he said earnestly.
"It is very bad if you do not tell to Carmelita."</p>

<p>"I don't want to worry her too soon," muttered Andy.</p>

<p>"He don' want to worry her too soon," mocked Ramon. "You titch
me many thing, <i>valedor,</i> but I think I'm always going to
titch you about the womans. You go tell Carmel, <i>pronto,</i>
right off queek!"</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>So it happened that Carmel was present at the strange councilor
gathering in the <i>sola</i> of Folded Hills the following evening.
All the candles of sperm wax in the sconces along the wall were
lighted as for a <i>fiesta.</i> The long room was full. Andy stood
in front of the empty fireplace, beneath the long Boone rifle that
hung, almost symbolically, across the pegs over his head. In chairs
sat various grandees of the neighborhood&mdash;and some from a
considerable distance. There were of course Ramon Rivera of Los
Madrones and Don Jose Constansio of Alisal from the Jolon Plateau
and, standing back of them, Basil Rivera and Samuel Constansio,
their sons; the Cermenos&mdash;father and three sons&mdash;the six
from the <i>rancho</i> of El Chapitel, Calderon and his tall boys
from Soledad. But also, in the big armchair, ordinarily Andy's
evening comfort, rested the still-straight and erect figure of Don
Sylvestro, who had ridden from the <i>hacienda,</i> apparently
without fatigue in spite of his age. He sat quietly, stroking his
long white beard, his young eyes, in which harbored a relish of
expectation, traveling from one to the other. With him had ridden
the elder of Carmel's brothers, Ygnacio, and the youngest, Felipe.
Cristobal dwelt now near San Luis Obispo.</p>

<p>"I could bring no cattle, <i>hijo mio,"</i> Don Sylvestro had
said to Andy. "It is too far. But I have brought some
<i>vaqueros.</i> Use them as you will."</p>

<p>"This is, then, a matter of common news," said Andy, half
vexed.</p>

<p>"But no!" Ramon hastened to assure him. "It was I. I sent by an
especial messenger. You would not have my papa miss such essport?"
he asked reproachfully.</p>

<p>"No one else?" probed Andy with suspicion.</p>

<p>"No-no-no!" cried Ramon. "Only those you have told me!"</p>

<p>But in the <i>sala,</i> beside these of the <i>hidalgo</i>
class, were a dozen or more grave-faced, hard-bitten riders of the
range, the chief <i>vaqueros,</i> the trusted men of the
<i>haciendas</i><i>.</i> They leaned against the wall, without
expression, without comment, their hands crossed before them
beneath their wide hats, waiting in respectful silence.</p>

<p>The windows of the <i>sala</i> were open for coolness and air,
for the night was warm and the gathering overcrowded for the room.
A guard, or sentry, one of Panchito's choosing, paced slowly back
and forth outside lest any of the numerous people should approach
within earshot, for this council was secret. From the direction of
the hills came the bellowing and lowing of cattle, in all keys and
tones, so that the composite sound was like the sweep and roll of a
mighty organ, and almost one could feel a faint trembling of the
solid earth.</p>

<p>Andy spoke. He addressed them all but deferred especially to Don
Sylvestro and Don Jose, who sat side by side. With the opening
brief phrases, which pointed out the need of doing something, they
nodded agreement.</p>

<p>"We know of Don Luis Peralta," said Don Sylvestro simply.</p>

<p>"We have come to your summons, Don Andreo," Constansio pointed
out.</p>

<p>They listened attentively while Andy sketched, as he had to Abel
Means, the formidable character of the Missourians and the
certainty of heavy loss in a direct attack. Some of the younger men
growled at this.</p>

<p>"If you lead us, Don Largo, we shall ride them down!" cried one.
The rest murmured eager assent.</p>

<p>Andy flashed a look in their direction.</p>

<p>"We have no arms," said he. "That would be suicide for many. But
here is what we shall do," said he. "Listen to that." He paused,
and the deep diapason of the cattle rolled through the momentary
silence. "There are twenty thousand cattle there in the hills. We
shall drive them down the valley. We shall <i>drive</i> them down
the valley," he added significantly.</p>

<p>Like most naturally adventurous men, Andy had a hidden but
powerful sense of the dramatic. He stopped with the simple
statement, allowing it time to kindle in these men's comprehension.
A breathless pause ensued. The young men turned to each other,
their eyes alight.</p>

<p>"The cattle are our weapon!" cried Ygnacio Rivera.</p>

<p>"Exactly," said Andy.</p>

<p>He waited for the hubbub to die, glancing with an easy humor
from the excited and wholly enthusiastic younger men to the grave
countenances of the elder. But it was to neither he finally
appealed.</p>

<p>"Panchito," he summoned.</p>

<p>"Señor!" The head <i>vaquero,</i> surprised, but with full
composure, straightened his tall form.</p>

<p>"What think you?" asked Andy.</p>

<p>Panchito looked about the company in deprecation of the
prominence into which he had been thrust over his betters.
Nevertheless he answered directly enough.</p>

<p>"It is the señor's idea to drive these cattle down the valley
and over these <i>ladrones?"</i> he asked, or rather stated. "This
cannot be done, señor."</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Andy.</p>

<p>"It would be impossible to drive cattle over the wagons, señor,
no matter how rapidly they are pressed. They will turn away, or
they will split in two parts and pass around, and there is no power
that could push them over wagons. At night, if they are very
frightened, perhaps a few, señor, but only a few." He spoke
regretfully, respectfully, but with the firm assurance of the
expert; and his companion <i>vaqueros</i> along the wall nodded
their heads in confirmation. "Yes, that is so, señor." And the
<i>hacendados</i> nodded too, and the young men eyed Panchito,
resentful that he must destroy so gorgeous a conception, but with a
reluctant assent. One turned to Panchito direct.</p>

<p>"When they are away from their wagons," said he. "They do not
live always in their accursed wagons, <i>madre de Dios."</i></p>

<p>Andy shook his head, answering for Panchito.</p>

<p>"That would be so, were it not for one thing," said he. "There
are with these people those who have lived in the Indian country
and have learned the wisdorn of battle. It has been brought to them
that we hold a great <i>matanza,</i> and I think they believe that.
If it were not for these three of whom I speak, we might, as Don
Gasper says, ride them down with the cattle when they were away
from their encampment. But as long as there are so many of us
<i>californios</i> gathered near, no matter for what reason, they
will not stir from their shelter. These wise ones will see to that.
Is that what you are thinking, Panchito?"</p>

<p><i>"Si, señor."</i>
</p>

<p>"Well, you are right." Andy turned to Leslie. "Do you understand
what we're saying?" he asked, still in Spanish.</p>

<p>"Pretty well," said Leslie in English.</p>

<p>"Speak Spanish," said Andy. "Did you get what Panchito said
about not being able to drive cattle across the wagons?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I understood that,"</p>

<p>"Did you know that before?"</p>

<p>"No," said Leslie. "I do not know much about cattle," he
confessed.</p>

<p>"Nor do these others." Andy turned to the room at large.
"But"&mdash;he held them for a moment, before
proceeding&mdash;"they all know buffalo. And buffalo, when they get
started, will run over anything. Unless they are split or turned.
This can be done. It is done by shooting down the leaders. Here is
my plan."</p>

<p>He looked about him at the attentive faces, collected
himself;</p>

<p>"It is a chance," he warned, "but it may succeed. In any case it
will help. It will be better than a direct attack against riflemen
behind wagons.</p>

<p>"We have together, in the hills beyond the <i>matanza</i>
grounds, somewhere near twenty thousand cattle. Tomorrow we shall
cut out about two thousand and drive them against the wagons. We
shall stampede them, rush them: To these robbers it will seem that
they are to be trampled down. They know buffalo; they do not know
cattle. They will shoot, as they would shoot into a buffalo
stampede: The cattle will turn or will divide to left and right.
They will go by."</p>

<p>"Hah!" surmised Don Sylvestro. "The rifles will all be emptied.
We shall ride in."</p>

<p>"They might all be emptied," admitted Andy, "but I think not.
And for this reason: these plains fighters, these three, have been
brought up on stratagems of that sort. The Indians use the
stampede&mdash;of buffalo and of horses. Some of the rifles will
not be fired. They will be kept in reserve for such an attack and
until the others can be reloaded."</p>

<p>"What then?" asked the <i>hidalgo.</i></p>

<p>"Another two thousand, and another, and another, as rapidly as
one can follow the other."</p>

<p>The younger men were looking toward each other ecstatically.
Ramon, the ever youthful, gave them voice.</p>

<p><i>"Holá!"</i> he cried. "But that will be sport!"</p>

<p>But the older heads saw farther.</p>

<p>"To what end, Don Andreo? How will the twentieth occasion differ
from the first?" Asked Don Jose Constansio courteously, "Is it your
thought that thus these will exhaust their powder?"</p>

<p>Andy shook his head.</p>

<p>"No, señor," he disclaimed, "for twenty rounds could not have
that effect."</p>

<p>"The cattle could be gathered and driven again," said Ramon.</p>

<p>"With due respect, señor, one such run will cure them of running
for that day," suggested Calderon.</p>

<p>"Then the next day," insisted Ramon stubbornly. "These people do
not fly like birds. They will be there."</p>

<p>"It would be impossible to hold so many cattle; the grass would
be gone, and the water." Calderon was becoming just as
obstinate.</p>

<p>"I think, señores, that Don Ramon's idea may be possible. But it
is my hope that we shall not need it," Andy interposed to end the
discussion. "I have not said all my plan."</p>

<p>"We will listen to Don Andreo," said señor Rivera with
authority.</p>

<p>"This maneuver I have told you," went on Andy. He spoke very
slowly and distinctly, not only to reach the intelligences of the
<i>vaqueros</i> against the wall, but also, Leslie felt gratefully,
that he might follow the Spanish.</p>

<p>"This maneuver might have several results. It is just possible
that from pressure behind, or even from panic, that some of the
cattle might dash against one or more of the wagons and overturn
them. If that happens we must be ready to ride, to charge fast and
get inside before the gap is closed. Once inside&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>"Viva!"</i> cried Ramon, who already saw this as an
accomplished fact. He subsided, like a small boy, under Don
Sylvestro's glance.</p>

<p>"I do not think this will happen," continued Andy, "but we must
be ready.</p>

<p>"It is also possible," he commented, "that after two, or three,
or six, or eight times these <i>sabios</i> may conclude that we
know nothing of stratagem, that we are simple <i>rancheros,</i> and
that all we are doing is to try to trample them down. In that case,
if the danger seems to them great enough; it might be that they
<i>would</i> empty all their rifles and pistols. Also if that
happens, we must be ready to charge before they can reload. We
shall test that when the moment seems to me ripe." He paused,
reflecting.</p>

<p>"And how will you do that test, Don Andreo?" the <i>hidalgo</i>
asked.</p>

<p>"By sending in more cattle at one time. Or perhaps two lots
quickly, one after the other, or even three. That I must decide
when the time comes.</p>

<p>"But these things are only possibilities, which we will seize if
they happen. But here, señores, is something sure. And it is on
this I really count. Here is my plan.</p>

<p>"Before very long it must be that the attention of everybody
will be fixed on the direction from which these cattle are coming.
At first, perhaps, there will be men watching the other sides. But
not for long, and not while the cattle are actually rushing upon
them. That is human nature. Now it is my thought that each time,
while attention is so fixed in one direction, that certain selected
ones, on foot, draw nearer on all other sides. They must do so
unseen. If any man is seen, then this part of the plan is lost. But
it can be done. When these have come very close, then we shall
stampede down the valley as many cattle as remain, and under cover
of that these selected men shall thrust aside the wagons to make an
entry for the horsemen."</p>

<p><i>"Viva!"</i> cried Ramon again.</p>

<p><i>"Viva! Viva!"</i> echoed others. The idea seemed to nobody
either fantastic or impracticable. Except perhaps the hardheaded
old sailor, Abel Means. He looked across the room at Andy, shifted
his quid speculatively, wondered just how mad the <i>patron</i>
might be.</p>

<p>"Crazy like an owl," concluded Abel Means finally, after due
deliberation. "Couldn't git a sober white man to take such a fool
notion serious enough to make it work, But with these yere lunatics
most likely it will!" He looked at Andy with admiration. He turned
to Leslie, who stood at his elbow. "It's going to be quite a
circus, anyways," said he; "it's a great thing to know jist how to
git the best out of what you got."</p>

<p>"Eh?" Leslie was puzzled.</p>

<p>"Nothin'," said Abel Means.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>The council did not break up until well after midnight.</p>

<p>Once the main idea had been grasped, there were many details.
There must be men to cut out, or collect, the requisite number for
each drive or attack or demonstration. This would be dull work,
hard work, but, worst of all, remote from the scene of the real
excitement. Andy assigned this task to some of his own men, under
Panchito, but he instantly took out some of the sting of
disappointment by arranging for reliefs from among those who had
already made a drive. There must be men, a number of groups of men,
to fill this latter function: a half dozen to each hand Andy
considered sufficient to keep them going once the cattle had been
started down the valley by the combined crews awaiting their turn.
Here would be the dash of riding and the honor and the glory of
excitement, and every man present was eager to be assigned the
captaincy of one of these groups. Andy picked swiftly and surely
from the younger men, apparently at hazard, but actually with sense
of their positions and abilities.</p>

<p>"You will pick your own men from among your own
<i>vaqueros,"</i> he told them. "What you are to do is to drive
your cattle as straight and as fast as you can directly at the
wagons. When they split or turn you are to get into the hills and
out of range as quickly and as safely as you can. I am not going to
tell you how. You will make your own arrangements and give your own
orders. I trust to your skill and good sense not to lose any of
your men."</p>

<p>He looked appraisingly from face to face.</p>

<p>"There must be a <i>capataz,"</i> he said, "someone who must
order when each band is to start. This man must be obeyed. I need
one who will not lose his head from excitement and whose judgment
is good. You, Panchito, shall be this <i>capataz.</i> I will talk
with you later. You will instruct each of these <i>caballeros</i>
when they shall start. And"&mdash;he turned to the
<i>caballeros&mdash;"</i>what Panchito says, that shall you do,
without question, for he shall be as myself." He held them, rather
sternly, with his eye until he had caught their murmur of
assent.</p>

<p>Abel Means was rubbing his hands slowly one over the other. He
nudged Leslie in the ribs.</p>

<p>"Purty slick," he murmured to that young man. "Takes him to put
a <i>vaquero</i> to bossing these young squirts and makin' 'em both
like it. Panchito was feeling pretty sore being left in the rear.
Now look at 'im!"</p>

<p>Leslie followed his indication. Certainly the carved wooden
immobility of the <i>vaquero's</i> face had, for the first time in
Leslie's experience, an expression.</p>

<p>The young men had been whispering together apart.</p>

<p>"Who shall be the first, señor?" one of them asked.</p>

<p>Andy ran his eyes over the faces turned toward him.</p>

<p>Some were eager; some were belligerent; some were sullen. He
checked, considering; for here, he sensed at once, were the makings
of a petty jealousy.</p>

<p>"Why, señores," he said slowly, "it seems to me that that matter
is beyond the decision of any of us. It is a question we must leave
to chance, for one man could not reasonably be chosen before
another. The name of each shall be written on a paper and shall be
taken, one by one, from a <i>sombrero,</i> and the names shall be
read out by the Doña Amata. Thus, señores, it shall be decided, for
no true <i>caballero</i> will deny the words of a
<i>doncellita."</i> He looked toward the corner where sat Carmel
and the little girl, smiling to himself at the stiffly erect pride
of the latter at being thus singled out for a part in these
proceedings. Carmel seized the opportunity to throw him a pleading
glance. Djo's name had not yet been mentioned.</p>

<p>"I," said Andy, "shall be on the little hill on the other side
of the valley, and just below the wagons. There I can watch. With
me shall be all the <i>caballeros</i> and all of the other men not
otherwise assigned. There shall gather those who have driven the
cattle. The slope is wide and easy. Down it we shall ride, if a
good chance offers, or if this plan works out."</p>

<p>"Señor," suggested young Basil Constansio, "if we were to wait
until such time as these ones graze their horses, we could
undoubtedly, by a sudden dash, stampede them."</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly, señor," agreed Andy courteously. "For that reason
we shall make our first drive as early as possible so that the
horses may remain in their possession. In that case it may be just
possible that these people might be tempted to mount and ride out
against us."</p>

<p>A murmur of appreciation arose, for no <i>californio</i> but
considered, and justly so, that in open warfare on horse-back, with
his own weapons of lance and <i>reata,</i> he was more than a
match, man for man, for any other race.</p>

<p>"You think of everything, Don Largo!" murmured Don
Sylvestro.</p>

<p>"You understandin' this?" asked Means, aside.</p>

<p>"Most of it," replied Leslie.</p>

<p>"Wal," said Means disparagingly, "it takes a hossman to know
good handling when he sees it."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Leslie was puzzled.</p>

<p>"Mebbe you've noticed that the <i>californios</i> are
different," said Means and relapsed into grumpy silence.</p>

<p>There were further details&mdash;signals, warnings, questions to
be answered. Amata must draw the lots. The party dispersed. But not
to sleep. The young men designated sought out their men, made their
selections among their <i>vaqueros,</i> gave instructions. Panchito
aroused his <i>vaqueros.</i> The combined forces began, by the dim
light of the stars, to gather together and separate into bands the
bawling herds.</p>

<p>As soon as the last visitor had gone and Andy and Carrnel were
alone together, her placidity broke. She seized his arm in both her
hands. "And those who must crawl in the grass and lie hidden and
make the hole in the wagon circle for the horsemen," she said
tensely. "You did not name them!"</p>

<p>Andy grinned.</p>

<p>"You noticed that! Nobody else did. Glad they didn't. I didn't
want to hurt anybody's feelings."</p>

<p>"Who is to do that?" She gave his arm a little shake. Her eyes
were wide.</p>

<p>"There's only one who could," said Andy.</p>

<p>"Djo!"</p>

<p>Andy nodded. "Who else? He's well trained; he can do it," he
said with simple pride.</p>

<p>"He will be killed," wailed Carmel, her head dropping. She threw
his arm from her in a sudden passion. "You send him
there&mdash;your own son&mdash;to be killed!"</p>

<p>"I'd do it myself," said Andy soberly, "but somebody's got to
overlook the game, and there's nobody but me can do that. Same," he
added, "as there's nobody but Djo to do this other job."</p>

<p>"He'll be killed! He'll be killed!"</p>

<p>Andy took her two wrists in his great hands.</p>

<p>"Look at me!" he commanded. "There! I don't think Djo will be
killed. I'm going to fix it to be as safe as I can. But this is
war. And it's our war. A man must take his chance. If he don't he's
not a man. And Djo's a man. I raised him to be a man." Andy stood
tall and straight. His eyes grew vacant; his grasp on Carmel's
wrists relaxed. He was looking across the years to a past so remote
that his own eyes had never seen it. Yet it was for the moment as
vivid to him as though the scene were enacting in the present. He
seemed to himself, for that flash, to stand in the gloom and murk
of a dark room so low that his head almost touched its beams, and
narrow slits of light where its wall was pierced, and the sharp
acrid tang of powder smoke, and the dim forms of men peering
through the slits cuddling rifle stock to cheek, and the sharp
crack of bullet and the dull thud at arrow searching the walls. All
this was dim and as though inside himself, but one thing was clear
and sharp, so that it seemed outside himself. And it came to him
that this dauntlessness at his elbow had been his grandmother, the
friend of Boone in the Dark and Bloody Ground; or perhaps, more
widely, the women of the Burnetts who had fronted battle with their
men. The moment passed. Andy sighed, drew Carmel gently to him.</p>

<p>"Djo will be all right," he said. "Our Lady will keep him safe,
and the blessed saints."</p>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>NO ONE SLEPT. Those who had charge of the cattle had their work
cut out for them. The others were too interested. Andy summoned to
him one after the other of those responsible and went over with
each separately, again and again, the few contingencies and the
signals to be employed in the one event or the other: for a frontal
attack in case a breech should be made in the defense of wagons, or
if, in Andy's judgment, the firearms had all been discharged at the
same time; for a rear attack when and if Djo's contingent had
succeeded in doing their part, or if it seemed to Andy that for any
other reason the moment was favorable. Each one's task in these
simple maneuvers he assigned and caused each to repeat back his
understanding. Andy knew well enough the impossibility of keeping
such an undisciplined and excitable people closely to any rigid
plan of action, but he had strong faith that if they were started
out right, something favorable was sure to develop. As Means had
hinted to Leslie, Andy had acquired an uncanny knowledge of his
adopted people and how best to make use of them. It is doubtful if
the hardheaded Indian fighters of his earlier life could have
pumped up enough enthusiasm for so fantastic a scheme to have
carried it through; nor, on the other hand, would the
<i>californios</i> have had the tenacity and cold-blooded courage
to stick out a day of siege warfare. But for something like this,
with movement, and excitement, and an element of rivalry, and a
considerable appeal to the imagination, the <i>californio</i> was
the man. Leslie vibrated in sympathy to the lighthearted and eager
impatience for the show to begin that animated into restless
skylarking the young men, both <i>caballero</i> and <i>vaquero,</i>
who were to take part in the drives.</p>

<p>He himself was to have no share in that. He was in a way
disappointed, for he could imagine the wild, mad, blood-stirring
rush and movement of such a unique charge. On the other hand, it
would soon be over, and the participants must take their places in
waiting. While Leslie, in company with Djo and Abel Means and two
young Spanish lads, would be from start to finish in the thick of
the action. Theirs was the responsible task of getting to the rear
wagons unseen and, unseen, of drawing thern aside for the charge of
the horsernen.</p>

<p>Andy talked to them as a group together; all the others he had
instructed only through their <i>capitans.</i> Leslie was inclined
to deprecate his own choosing.</p>

<p>"I'm no good at this scouting work," said he.</p>

<p>"You're one of the few around here who knows anything about
shooting," said Andy, "and for the rest of it, you just follow
close at Djo's heels, and you do the same thing he does, <i>and at
exactly the same time:"</i> He emphasized strongly the latter
point. He grinned. "Chance maybe to show what good is all that
pistol palaver," said he. Andy was still tolerantly amused at the
lad's shooting theories. He turned to Means. "Same to you, Abel.
You're about the only other one on the <i>rancho</i> who can use
firearms."</p>

<p>"I'm a sailor," grumbled Means; "I ain't no rifleman!"</p>

<p>"I know that," said Andy with another grin, "but you don't shut
both eyes when you pull trigger."</p>

<p>The Spanish lads, one of whom was Benito's son, were to go along
as man power to help move the wagons. They carried knives and
<i>machetes.</i> They listened with shining eyes to their simple
instructions. Andy slapped them on the back.</p>

<p>"Show them what a <i>californio</i> is made of," said he.</p>

<p>"Now yere you are, Djo." Andy reverted to trapper talk as
befitting the occasion. "Make your sneak like I told you, when
they're so busy they haven't time to look your way. Take no chances
of being seen. There's lots of time. If you <i>are</i> diskivered
before you get there, pull out. Don't linger. Get away. We'll just
let that part of it go then. Ef'n you get caught hauling at the
wagons, drop flat and put up a fight. Hold 'em off best you can. It
won't be for long; we'll be with you in two shakes. Ef'n you get a
hole made all right without no one seeing you, hop into a wagon and
lie flat, Don't you try to get in no fight afoot. We'll tend to the
fight part of it. As soon as we charge in, <i>you get out,</i> as
fast as you can. No ifs and ands. Understand?" There was fire in
Andy's eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>señor padre,"</i> said Djo, standing very erect.</p>

<p>"Well, you better; I'm serious." The fire slowly died. "If you
behave yourselves and do this right there ought not to be much
danger. We'll be watching, and we'll hop in <i>pronto</i> if it
looks like it's necessary. But I don't want to git any of you boys
hurt less'n it's necessary. That"&mdash;he turned to
Means&mdash;"is another reason I'm sending you. Djo's the boss
because he knows more about this kind of game, but I'm lookin' to
you just the same. That's all. Git along with you and get hid
before it gets too light."</p>

<p>He took it entirely for granted that Leslie was to be included
in this singular warfare; nor did it occur to the young man that
his official and sworn position under the government might be
inconsistent with his taking a part. But if it had, it is doubtful
if the thought would have influenced him. Shortly he and Djo and
Abel Means and the two slim <i>californio</i> youths set off in the
darkness. Djo carried the rifle he had brought from Monterey and
wore his long throwing knife; Abel Means had likewise a rifle and a
pair of single-shot horse pistols: Leslie had his Colt's and his
derringer and in addition was given a light-calibered short-stocked
rifle that Djo said had been especially made for him as a boy.</p>

<p>"It's too small and light, really," said he, "but it might help.
It's all there is."</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>Soon after daylight the first band of cattle moved. To Leslie,
concealed with his companions in the high yellow mustard on the
sidehill below the ring of wagons, it was a wonderful sight. They
came in a long narrow brown river, crowding between the hills and
the deep ditch that stood to the grainfields in lieu of a fence;
Once below that restriction, they spread across the whole width of
the valley. Then for the first time the riders became
intermittently visible through the thin haze of dust, darting back
and forth at full speed, on their task of getting this unwieldy
mass into rapid motion. At first so heavy was the impression of
inertia, this seemed to Leslie impossible. But the <i>vaqueros</i>
were masters of beasts. They swung their <i>reatas;</i> they dashed
into the milling mass, leaning from their saddles to play their
quirts or to twist tails. But especially they gave voice to queer
sharp cries that seemed to have a maddening effect, not only on the
cattle, but upon their own mounts as well. The brown flood heaved
sluggishly forward, suddenly broke, as a dam breaks to pressure of
water.</p>

<p>Even to Leslie, safely above level on the sidehill, the sight of
this rushing torrent of beasts was stupendous in its feeling of the
irresistible, for it seemed that no physical structure could stand
against it and no physical power could stem or deflect it from its
course. Remembering his introduction to these acres of Folded
Hills, he could see with the eyes of those in the path of this
living avalanche. He shivered with a vicarious thrill.</p>

<p>The oval enclosed by the wagons seethed into activity.</p>

<p>Evidently aroused by the bawling and the dust of the herd when
slowly approaching down the lane between the ditch and the hill,
the squatters were already out and afoot. Some climbed for a moment
to the wagon boxes in order better to see. But the majority, after
a brief glance of identification, had gone about their affairs of
beginning the day. The business of rodeo Interested them little.
Even with the first urgings of the riders comprehension had failed
to come. A few&mdash;and among them, Leslie suspected, were the
three Indian fighters&mdash;had climbed to wagon seats for a better
view. Only after the cattle had definitely broken did someone
appear to understand. Leslie could see him waving his arms,
clamoring for attention, and the arrested attitudes of those who
had been moving about on the morning's errands. The man pointed,
shouted something. Leslie was too far away to hear the words. But
the wagon corral broke into beelike activity. Men darted to wagons,
probably in search of weapons, returned with rifles in their hands,
urged vigorously forward by the man on the wagon box, and dropped
on their bellies beneath the wagons. Women and older girls scurried
about more frantically, collecting children, hoisting them into the
wagon boxes. Leslie recognized instantly that here must be a
complication when it came time for him and his companions to
attempt to move some of the wagons. He glanced at Djo. Djo's brows
were knit. Evidently the thought had occurred to him also. But
Leslie had no time to worry about that now. Things were happening.
Rifles were cracking, their sharp reports the only sounds audible
above the rush of the cattle. A beast&mdash;another&mdash;another
stumbled, went down, disappeared beneath the brown flood. The front
rank wavered, tried to turn to right and left, were swept on by the
press of those behind, half sidewise, still struggling mightily,
leaning the whole weights of their bodies in a frantic effort to
change their direction. In this they succeeded at last, though a
few, unable to hold their feet against the current, were swept
sidewise to collide with a resounding crash against the wagons
themselves. The vehicles shook but were too wide and solid to be so
easily overset by a single impact. Nevertheless Leslie could well
imagine the leap of heart each of these collisions must cause to
those on a level with the imminent flood, and he almost found it in
him to sympathize with the frantic haste of the reloading.</p>

<p>Then with a roar the herd had swept by on either side.</p>

<p>The pursuing riders, following their orders, had magically
disappeared to right and left into the hills. A slow following
billow of dust rolled lazily across the encampment, half obscuring
it, settled almost as though with a sigh of completion.</p>

<p>Leslie turned to Djo. Djo was staring into space, two lines
between his eyes.</p>

<p>"We'll make a try for that patch of sage on the next run," said
he. "As far as I could see nobody paid any attention except to the
cattle. Did you see anyone, Leslie?"</p>

<p>"I-I'm afraid I wasn't looking," Leslie stammered.</p>

<p>"The dust is going to help," said Djo appraisingly. "It will get
thicker the more cattle are driven." He looked at Leslie. "What you
shaking for? Scared?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I'm not scared," protested Leslie stoutly. "I'm just shivering.
It's cold."</p>

<p>He felt Djo's eyes on him in detached appraisal. It was as
though Djo were a stranger, He flushed again, indignant at himself,
indignant that the sheer spectacle had blinded him to the
elementary observations, indignant that mere excitement should so
uncontrolledly unsteady his hands and body. He looked Djo squarely
in the eye, almost with defiance. Djo stared back at him
impersonally, as though in judgment.</p>

<p>"All right," said Djo finally, "I know how it is. I was that way
first time I was waiting to shoot a bear. You get over it when
there's something to do. It's just the waiting."</p>

<p>The warmth of self-esteem returned to Leslie's veins at this
understanding. And curiously enough the shaking stopped.</p>

<p>"What about those women and children in the wagons?" he asked.
"They're going to bother us, aren't they? They'll give us away. How
are we going to take care of them?"</p>

<p>"There's none in the wagon with the yellow wheels or the one
next it on the left," said Djo briefly.</p>

<p>Leslie again subsided to his own disesteem. He had not noticed
that.</p>

<p>"Here comes another batch," said Djo. He spoke to the
Californian youths. "Now, all of you," he warned, "don't watch down
there this time. Watch me. Do as I do. We'll make a try to get
nearer."</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>With each successive wave of cattle driven down the valley, the
dust clouds rose thicker as the turf was torn and the soil
pulverized. With each successive wave the emulative excitement of
the young <i>californios</i> and their <i>vaqueros</i> arose to
higher and higher pitch. From their point of view the thing was
succeeding beyond expectation. The Missourians were thoroughly
bamboozled by the demonstration. They shot desperately and as
rapidly as they could reload. There was no doubt that, with each
splitting of the herd, the defenders drew deep breaths of relief
over a destruction but just averted. To the light-spirited
<i>californios,</i> who knew that the same thing would have taken
place without a shot fired, this was a huge and private joke. The
situation became farcical to them. They skylarked. Under cover of
the dust cloud one of the riders dashed fairly up against the
wagons, whirling the loop of his <i>reata.</i> No living mark
presented itself for his cast. He contented himself with snatching
from its socket on a wagon's footboard a long-lashed "bull" whip,
which he dragged away after him as he fled, Iaughing
derisively.</p>

<p>The rifles were empty, but a scatter of pistol-bullets whistled
by him harmlessly.</p>

<p>His example was contagious. As nothing small and movable
remained to snare as a trophy, the young riders swooped past to
strike the canvas covers of the wagons resounding blows with their
extended <i>reatas.</i> It became a game, for a time played without
accident. The billowing clouds of dust rolling along after the
herds were so thick that the horsemen were able to dash in and to
dash out again so quickly and from such unexpected angles that none
of them were hit. Andy from his hilltop could not see what was
going on. Then the dust cleared to discover one horse down and its
rider, by the grace of the blessed saints, loping away ahold of
another's stirrup leather, and a second horse limping painfully
from the field, its rider swaying in his saddle, clinging
desperately to his pommel, Two riders, already well on their way,
discovering his plight, turned back to help. Rifles cracked.
Another horse went down. One of the riders fell from his saddle
heavily, like a sack of grain. Others rode down the hill to the
rescue. The wounded man and the dead man were somehow carried off.
The two dead horses remained on the field.</p>

<p>Andy, seeing these things from his vantage place, was furiously
angry. He mounted his horse behind the shelter of the hills and
dashed to the head of the valley where awaited in eager impatience
those in charge of the bands of cattle yet to make the run. These
he lashed to sobriety, threatening to shoot with his own rifle any
who departed from the strict business of the occasion. Panchito,
who had tried in vain to hold down their exuberance, looked grimly
triumphant. Andy returned to his lookout. The operations had been
interrupted for nearly an hour. The cattle were milling restlessly,
for they were thirsty with the strengthening sun.</p>

<p>The last hour had had other effects on the situation.</p>

<p>The <i>californios</i> gathered behind the hill were angry. The
<i>fiesta</i> mood had evaporated. This was no longer a lark.</p>

<p>The killing of the young Cermenos and the horses and the
wounding of Basil Constansio had driven home the realities; It is
probable that most of those present appreciated that reality for
the first time: that these people below them, on the flat, within
the circle of wagons, were not playing a part in a rather
entertaining drama; that they were there in serious intention as
despoilers; that the outrage of appropriation and destruction begun
was not part of <i>opera bouffe,</i> over with the fall of curtain,
but something accomplished and actual that might next happen to
each and anyone of them. Their handsome faces set grimly. They
dismounted and thoughtfully drew on the broad <i>latigos,</i>
tightening the <i>cinchas</i> of their saddles, and that, with
these horsemen, was significant as a symbol of determination.</p>

<p>This Andy, riding up, noted with satisfaction. But the
satisfaction was mixed. He drew Ramon aside.</p>

<p>"I'm talking to you seriously, <i>valedor,"</i> said he. "This
is no time for jesting."</p>

<p>"That I understand," said Ramon.</p>

<p>Andy looked at his friend's face that had sobered to
attention.</p>

<p>"Those skylarking fools have done a heap of damage," said he,
shifting to English. "I'd thought we could rush the wagons sometime
when I figgered they'd emptied all their rifles. They won't do that
now."</p>

<p>"No?" Ramon looked his inquiry.</p>

<p>"No. They'll be holding their fire&mdash;some of it&mdash;for
more of these crazy loons."</p>

<p>"I see," said Ramon.</p>

<p>"And that," said Andy, "means somebody's going to git hurt. No
way out. These can shoot." He shook his head. "We're bound to lose
men. I hoped maybe we wouldn't have to. What I want to know is: can
we sit down and starve 'em out?"</p>

<p>"No," said Ramon promptly.</p>

<p>"That's what I figgered." Andy looked at the frowning intent
faces about him, sighed. "Your people are good fighters, Ramon, and
that's what I always said, but they only fight good while they're
mad." He drew his long figure erect and stretched his hands above
his head. "Well," said he, "we'll go at it. But we got no time now
to monkey. We'll throw all we got at them at once and do our best.
If we dribble along as we been doing they'll soon get onto the fact
that the cattle won't run over 'em." He thrust his head cautiously
above the grass level to appraise the situation below. "They've
knocked over a dozen critters already," said he. "Pile up a few
more and we'll have trouble driving down the valley at all. All
right. You ride up and bring down every head of beef that's left up
there. Start 'em fast and keep 'em coming. See if you can't make
'em think hell's at their tails." He turned his gray eyes mildly on
his friend. "When," he drawled in exaggerated trapper lingo, "you
git the critters past, ef'n you see anything of a fight goin' on,
you might pile in: it's likely to be a good one!"</p>

<p>"How about Djo?" asked Ramon. "He's not at the wagons yet."</p>

<p>"No," said Andy, "that's why I'm so mad at these damn fools that
started this. Wish I'd seen 'em! However"&mdash;he hunched his
shoulders, shrugging that off&mdash;"soon's I see your dust close
enough, I'll start 'em off. They got to take a chance." His brows
were knit with a real anxiety. If the lad and his companions
started too soon and should be seen by anybody within the wagon
circle, they could hardly escape the squatters' rifles. If, on the
other hand, the rush of cattle caught them before they had
traversed the flat to the shelter of the wagons, they must be
trampled underfoot.</p>

<p>Ramon also saw this point.</p>

<p>"No"&mdash;Andy negatived his suggestion&mdash;"won't do. See
what happens: by the time mounted men could hop off'n their hosses
and pull away the wagons to make a hole through you'd have them
shooting right in the thick of you, and yo're all huddled together
at that. We'd lose half our men, or more, We're agoin' to lose
consid'able as it is." He fell silent, pondering. Confident as he
was&mdash;as he had always been&mdash;of the basic courage of the
Californians, he could not but admit to himself that to attack
expert riflemen practically barehanded required something
approaching fanaticism. Would they carry through when this fact was
borne in on them by the actual test? Not unless the planned
surprise worked out; that was certain. Aloud he said, "I've changed
my mind about one thing. Don't you bother about any fight that's
goin' on. Let your <i>vaqueros</i> take care of that. This is your
job, and Panchito's; you look for Djo and his lot, and you stand
ready to snake them up behind you <i>and git out</i> with 'em if
things look like they're&mdash;well, like they mout be goin' wrong.
Understand?"</p>

<p>Ramon nodded.</p>

<p>"They's five of 'em. You and Panchito, and you'll need three
more. Pick your men well, and see that they stick to just that and
nothin' else. I'm dependin' on you. I won't have time to bother
myself, and anyway, you'll be comin' along, behind the cattle, just
about the right time."</p>

<p>"Djo will not come," suggested Ramon.</p>

<p>"He's had his marching orders, but I'm going to sneak down to
where he is and give them to him all over again," said Andy grimly.
"He'll come! This thing ain't going to be decided by two-three
rifles. It'll be the <i>reata,</i> and cold iron&mdash;or nothin'."
He patted Ramon on the shoulder. "All right; git again'. You wait
up there where you can see. I'll wave my hat when to start."</p>

<p>Ramon mounted, flashed his white teeth in his old gay smile.</p>

<p>"Be not escare, <i>valedor!</i>" he cried. "I shall r-rernove
Djo myself. Is he not my <i>ahijado&mdash;</i>what you
call?&mdash;my godson? If he shall not come, then I may&mdash;I
may&mdash;what you call?&mdash;espank!"</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>After fifteen minutes had passed the men lying under the wagons
arose.</p>

<p>"Reckon that's got 'em licked," they said on varying notes of
satisfaction and doubt.</p>

<p>"We sure got meat for a barbecue!" chuckled one of the younger
men.</p>

<p>"Reckon they're through, Williams?" queried someone from one of
the Indian fighters.</p>

<p>"Sartin!" returned the latter contemptuously. "Kill one or two
of 'em and they quit like dogs. I fit 'em under Taylor."</p>

<p>"Those were Mexs," observed a graybeard on a tone of doubt.</p>

<p>"Greaser's greasers," returned Williams succinctly. "Sometimes
they put up quite a argument for a while, but once you got 'em
licked, they stay licked."</p>

<p>A man perched on a wagon box spat copiously into the powdery
dust outside.</p>

<p>"Then I reckon we ain't got 'em licked," he observed dryly, "fer
it looks like to me they's a lot more where they come from!"</p>

<p>They crowded to the wagons to look up the valley. "It's shore a
lot of dust," said someone. "Reckon they're comin' agin?"</p>

<p>"I bet you they air!" The man on the wagon glared contemptuously
at Ransom. "Thought you said as how these greasers wouldn't
fight?"</p>

<p>"Well, they haven't fit; have they?" demanded Ransom
belligerently. "Do you call it fightin', drivin' a lot of dumb
beasts?"</p>

<p>"Mebbe it's not fightin'," said the graybeard, "but it kept my
bar'l hot. Looked to me like we just about saved our ha'r, whatever
you call it."</p>

<p>"Keep this up, we're li'ble to set around here till Fourth er
July!" grumbled the misanthrope on the wagon box.</p>

<p>"They won't keep it up," said Ransom confidently.</p>

<p>"You said they wouldn't fight," the other pointed out. "Looks to
me like they done put up a purty good job."</p>

<p>"Hell!" said Ransom in disgust. "What's the matter with you!
Gittin' yaller? Expect things handed to you on a silver platter?"
He looked about him for approval. The tall, sallow man nodded
gravely. Thus encouraged, Ransom went on. "Got yore land, ain't ye?
And dang good land. And if it warn't for this renegade white
man&mdash;" He stopped, checked by a sudden shift in the group
about him. A powerfully built man with a full seal brown beard
thrust himself forward.</p>

<p>"What's this about a white man?" he demanded. "You didn't tell
us about no white man."</p>

<p>"There wa'n't nothing to tell, Porter," protested Ransom
stoutly, but evidently on the defensive. "He's just one of these
renegades, turned greaser years ago."</p>

<p>"What's he got to do with it?" persisted Porter. "Where does he
come in?"</p>

<p>"Well, he's supposed to own this ranch," admitted Ransom
reluctantly.</p>

<p>The big man ripped out an oath.</p>

<p>"I never aimed to have no truck with ary white man's land," said
he.</p>

<p>"But this feller's no white man," insisted Ransom. "You saw him.
He's gone greaser as yaller as the best on 'em."</p>

<p>"Elmer! Hi, you, Elmer!" called a shrill voice. A woman's
sunbonnet protruded from the puckered cover of a wagon. "Kain't we
all git down?"</p>

<p>"You stay whar you be till I tell you," replied the big man
decisively.</p>

<p>"But the children got to git down&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You heerd me!" Porter shut her up. He turned to Ransom.
"Greaser or no greaser, he's a white man, and it's a white man
we're fightin'."</p>

<p>"I didn't know you were so plumb sentimental on white men,"
sneered Ransom.</p>

<p>The other stared him down contemptuously.</p>

<p>"When you fight a white man," he condescended at last, "you
ain't fightin' a fool greaser with only one idee in his head. Yere
you, Tawn: you sneak over and watch out in the rear thar, that
nobody attacks thar, and Jake and Jimmy watch out both sides, Crawl
around clost under the wagons so nobody sees you take yore places.
I've fit greasers in Mexico," he muttered quaintly in his beard,
"and I've fit Injuns, and I kind of trust 'em, but I don't trust no
white man."</p>

<p>"Gee-ker snipes!" exclaimed the man on the wagon box. "Look at
that!"</p>

<p>He extended his arm up the valley. In the distance a brown mass
was pouring slowly over the summit of the hill and down the slope,
like a sluggish, muddy river. Across the face of it sharp eyes
could just make out the mounted figures riding back and forth,
holding control until Ramon should receive the signal.</p>

<p>"There must be a million of 'em!" said the lookout, awed.</p>

<p>"They're gain' to make their big try this time," said Porter.
"Stand steady, boys, and shoot clost."</p>

<p>"Do we shoot this time?" asked one of the men.</p>

<p>"No," said Porter.</p>

<p>"They's a power of 'em," said the man, glancing doubtfully up
the valley. "Do you-all think you can turn 'em?"</p>

<p>"Ef'n we don't, I'll let you know," said Porter with a certain
grim humor. "You hold yore fire. And," he added, "you keep yore eye
on Tawm and Jake and Jimmy and you let me know ef'n anything comes
up."</p>

<p>"What you thinkin', Cap?" asked another curiously.</p>

<p>"Nothin'," admitted Porter, "exceptin' I don't trust no white
man, and I ain't intendin' anybody's goin' to sneak in on us
without gittin' a bellyful of lead."</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p>Andy, unaware of this new development, paused for a last look
around before giving the signal which would launch Ramon and his
men on their wild charge. Djo and his companions he had visited.
They had reached the last patch of cover safely above the flat. It
was over a hundred yards from the wagons. This hundred yards they
must traverse. They must do so only after the cattle had been
stampeded near enough to hold the attention of the squatters.
Naturally they must complete the distance before the leaders could
trample them. It was a nice calculation at best. They knew nothing
of Tawm and Jake and Jimmy and the almost certain death of the long
rifle barrels now protruding between the spokes of wheels. Andy had
made the journey to and from Djo's concealment unseen. He was
satisfied Djo understood what he must do and that he intended to
obey the injunction to keep out of the fight.</p>

<p>Behind the concealment of the hills to which he returned awaited
the riders who had already made the runs, some forty-odd in number.
Probably twice that number remained with Ramon. Here also were some
of the older men, including Don Sylvestro himself. A few carried
big smooth bore pistols at their saddlebows; a few had lances taken
from the walls where they had hung for many years; a few even
sported slim old-fashioned rapiers. But all carried knives and the
deadly <i>reata</i>, They were grimly in earnest. Andy believed
they would stick. He had only one word for them.</p>

<p>"Don't fight them any more than you must, señores," said he.
"Rope them and tie them up. Work fast before they can recharge
their pieces."</p>

<p>They nodded, balancing their rawhide loops.</p>

<p>The sun was by now hear the meridian. The breeze that blew every
afternoon up the valley from the sea was beginning faintly to stir.
It bore with it certain small homely sounds from the <i>rancho,</i>
sounds such as the slow contemplative clucking of hens that stood
out daintily in relief against their background of the dull and
heavy bawling of the cattle. For a queer instant the eternal
quietudes that were made up of just these small accustomed things,
and the sunshine, and the mountains, and the serene detachment of
birds alone seemed real to Andy, and all this dust and row of
danger and death were illusory as mist. He laughed and snapped
back. They were genuine enough. He straightened in his saddle, took
off his broad hat to wave the signal to Ramon.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>Chapter 13</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>PEDRO, the <i>mozo,</i> who had been left on watch, slipped
through the tall mustard on the hilltop.</p>

<p>"Señor!" he gasped. "One comes!"</p>

<p>"One comes where? What?" Andy was impatient, but he stayed his
signal, impressed by the man's excitement.</p>

<p>"Down the middle of the valley, where the cattle run from the
direction of the <i>casa</i>&mdash;in plain view!"</p>

<p>"Well, what of it?"</p>

<p>"But this one has the look of an <i>hidalgo,</i> señor!"</p>

<p>"Who is it? Do you know him?"</p>

<p>"No, señor."</p>

<p>Andy slipped from his saddle and dropped the reins over his
horse's head. The degree of the man's excitement was inexplicable,
even though this stranger were blundering into real danger. Andy
ducked through the mustard to a point of vantage.</p>

<p>Down the middle of the valley, as Pedro had said, rode at a foot
pace a stranger. He was headed directly toward the wagons. The
animal he rode was a fine one, finely caparisoned in the
Californian manner. The rider was not a Californian; nor was he
dressed in any fashion familiar to Andy. He wore a high beaver hat,
a light blue tailed coat, tight pantaloons strapped under the
insteps of thin varnished boots, gloves of light lemon color. In
his hand he carried, at what even the untutored Andy knew
instinctively to be the correct angle, a short-knobbed riding crop,
an implement also unfamiliar. He sat his horse well and gracefully,
with the ease of the accomplished rider.</p>

<p>Apparently his whole interest was centered in the pleasure of
his ride. He seemed to be unaware of the menace or the existence of
the wagons, to which by now he had drawn near, incurious of the
dead cattle at which his horse shied aside daintily. His eyes
rested on the vivid yellow green of the new foliage on the oaks,
were attracted upward by the shadow of a vulture. He struck idly at
the top of an artemisia. He seemed not to hear hoarse commands to
halt; nor did he pay attention to the rifle barrels thrust forward
in threat from beneath the cover of the wagons. Only when his horse
stopped, its nose fairly against a wheel, did the stranger appear
to come to himself. Andy saw him lean forward slightly in his
saddle. Apparently he held a short colloquy with those inside the
corral of wagons. Then he lifted his reins. The horse half reared,
executed a pretty turn&mdash;the demivolte of the riding schools,
had Andy known anything about riding schools. The extraordinary
stranger then rode slowly and serenely up the hill through the tall
yellow mustard, directly toward Andy's concealment.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>Andy slipped back over the brow of the hill. He had no wish that
the stranger should stumble upon him in the grass and so disclose
his presence, and time pressed for the delivery of the attack. But
as though the horseman had sensed his withdrawal, he put his animal
to a canter up the slope. So he overtook Andy as the latter reached
his own horse and the waiting group of <i>californios.</i> He
reined in, raised his riding crop in easy and negligent salute,
ignoring the stares of astonishment that greeted his
appearance.</p>

<p>"Mr. Burnett," he stated rather than inquired. Andy felt himself
the object of a scrutiny that checked him with a quality he could
not define. He nodded shortly.</p>

<p>"I'll talk to you later," said he. "I have business afoot."</p>

<p>"So," said the stranger, "I perceive. It is of that business I
wish to speak."</p>

<p>"What is it of yours?" demanded Andy.</p>

<p>"None, none whatever," admitted the stranger.</p>

<p>"Then stand one side," said Andy. A sudden thought struck him.
"How did you know where to find me?"</p>

<p>"I inquired of your charming wife."</p>

<p>"She told you? You have been to the <i>casa!"</i> cried Andy,
his face darkening. He remembered the stranger's pause at the
wagons. "What is your business here?" he demanded bluntly.</p>

<p>"I have no interest whatever in the trespassers on your land,"
said the stranger as though reading his thoughts, "nor have I
disclosed aught to them. And Mrs. Burnett was justified in
accepting my assurances of good faith." He was smiling quizzically,
surveying Andy's perplexity with a delighted mischief. For Andy was
indeed perplexed. If the man were lying, if he had passed on to the
defenders of the wagons the fact that over this hill lay a flanking
force ready to attack, why then all this careful strategy was
useless. And if the attack were launched, if Djo and his little
party were to attempt to cross the open space that lay before them,
they must be annihilated. Of course the man might be sincere; how
did it happen that Carmel had confided in him so readily? Carmel
had more sense. Dared he take that chance?</p>

<p>"I think you must tell me what your business is here. And
quickly," said he.</p>

<p>The <i>californios</i> moved restlessly. They did not understand
the stranger's presence, nor the purport of this long colloquy.</p>

<p><i>"Que es, señor?"</i> they asked.</p>

<p>Andy silenced them with a gesture. "What are you doing here?" he
demanded roughly.</p>

<p>The stranger produced along cheroot, the end of which he clipped
with a penknife. He prolonged the operation with a hidden enjoyment
that at the same time both perplexed and angered Andy.</p>

<p>"Speak up!" he urged. His straight brows were drawn together
dangerously. The stranger examined him and laughed lightly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I'd better;" said he. "I was at Monterey. I heard rumor
of squatter trouble up the valley," He spoke now crisply and to the
point. "If there was trouble anywhere in his vicinity I knew my
nephew would be in the thick of it. So here I am! Where is my
nephew? That is my business here."</p>

<p>Ramon dashed up at full speed, scattering turf and pebbles
fanwise before his horse's forefeet as he wrenched the animal to
its haunches.</p>

<p><i>"Valedor,"</i> he cried, "what is wrong? We cannot much
longer hold the cattle. They thirst. They will break from us!"</p>

<p>"Wait," said Andy in English, raising the flat of his hand
toward Ramon, but keeping his eyes keenly on the other. "This man
is Leslie's uncle. I will tell you where your nephew is," said he.
"He is with my son and three others on the edge of the brush just
this side of the wagons. When my friend here drives those cattle
against the wagons, these boys are goin' to make a dash across and
pull out a wagon or so to make a hole for me and these others to
git in through. That," said he deliberately, "sounds dangersome,
but it's purty safe." His eyes bored into the depths of the
other's. Now, said Andy to himself, if he's said ary word to the
squatters, he must show it, for that would mean certain death to
his kin. Apparently he was satisfied, for after a tense half-minute
he turned to Ramon.</p>

<p>"All right, Ramon," said he, "let 'em come through."</p>

<p>'"Wait!" commanded the stranger with a snap of authority in his
voice. "I think, if you will give me a chance, I can resolve this
matter."</p>

<p>"It ain't a matter for argument," said Andy. "These men have got
to get off my land."</p>

<p>"I'll get 'em off."</p>

<p>"You!" Andy stared at him. "What makes you think you can do
that?" His eyes were narrowed with returning suspicion.</p>

<p>"Give me an hour."</p>

<p>"I ain't got an hour," said Andy bluntly. "I can't hold my
cattle&mdash;or my men&mdash;that long." A thought struck him that
softened the lines between his eyes. "I'll send Pedro down to order
Leslie to keep out of this," said he.</p>

<p>The other thrust this aside with an impatient gesture; "He can
take a chance as well as your son," said he.</p>

<p>Andy frowned at him from beneath lowered brows, all his
suspicions returning. How did he even know the man was Leslie's
uncle as he claimed? Something funny about this. The whole affair
was suspicious; Why had he stopped at the wagons? Andy for once was
undecided. He did not know what to do; what he dared do. He studied
the man's face. He liked it. And about it there was something
hauntingly familiar, something that plucked at his memory. About
the man's lips came and went a mysterious smile, as though of a
secret amusement.</p>

<p><i>"Amigo,"</i> pleaded Ramon.</p>

<p>The stranger's smile deepened.</p>

<p>"I think I'd have known you anyway, Andy," said he. "You've
changed, of course, but those eyebrows I could not mistake. And is
that the same rifle? The rifle that old Dan'l Boone carried?" He
leaned from his saddle to touch the stock of the weapon with his
forefinger. He looked up into Andy's straight stare, his own eyes
surprisingly misted. "Don't you know me, Andy?" he pleaded. Andy
continued to stare, recollection slowly piecing itself in the back
of his brain. His mind moved slowly back and, forth, groping
through crowded years. His eyes widened.</p>

<p>"Russ Braidwood!" he gasped. He reached from his, saddle to
envelop the other man's shoulder in his mighty grasp. "My God, man,
where did you come from? Where have you been?"</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>Ramon thrust his mount forward insistently.</p>

<p>"Andreo!" he pleaded, "what are we to do? We cannot hold the
cattle longer! Look how they are breaking for the water!"</p>

<p>"Haste, Don Largo!" "Give the signal." "We lose the chance,"
urged others.</p>

<p>Andy turned to them a shining countenance.</p>

<p>"Señores," said he, the words poured out from him in an
unaccustomed and breathless haste, "here, by the grace of the
blessed saints, comes the only friend I knew as a boy. It is thirty
years since I have seen him. Why, he and I"&mdash;Andy chuckled
affectionately&mdash;"the first day we laid eyes on each other,
fought over nothing until we fell down in an icy puddle, and so
became fast friends. He knew my old home&mdash;he himself lived
near there. He knew my grandmother. It was because of him, in a
way, that I left my home. Do you understand Spanish?" he asked of
Braidwood.</p>

<p>"A little. I understand what you are saying."</p>

<p>"Señor," Don Sylvestro spoke up with formality, "it is
gratifying to us that you have thus encountered an old friend, but
it is still a fact that Ramon awaits your commands."</p>

<p>Andy looked at Braidwood inquiringly.</p>

<p>"You said an hour?" he asked. At Braidwood's nod the
<i>ranchero</i> turned again to the Californians. "My friend thinks
it possible he may be able to arrange matters. We shall give him
the chance."</p>

<p>"I cannot hold the cattle. We lose our chance," said Ramon.</p>

<p>"Let them water; there is always <i>mañana,"</i> said Andy.</p>

<p>In the word he voiced the philosophy of the race; yet the
<i>californios</i> looked sullen or rebellious, and Ramon rode
away, shaking his head.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>Braidwood descended the hill through the mustard.</p>

<p>Djo and his companions watched him with curiosity. As he
debouched from the high growth to plain view, Leslie uttered an
exclamation. Djo caught his expression of blank amazement.</p>

<p>"It's my uncle!" gasped Leslie.</p>

<p>"Your uncle! What's he doing here?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"What business has he with these robbers?"</p>

<p>"I don't know!" Leslie half started up as though to show himself
to the horseman.</p>

<p>"Sit tight!" commanded Djo, hauling him down, none too
gently.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>Chapter 14</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>BRAIDWOOD stopped his horse ten feet from the wagons.</p>

<p>"Ransom," he challenged in his high, clear voice, "what have you
been telling these people?"</p>

<p>For a moment no one spoke. It was Powers, of the square
seal-brown beard, who finally replied.</p>

<p>"Who air you that yore questions should be answered?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>"Ask Ransom if he knows me," returned Braidwood crisply. "That
is," he added, "if you still believe what he says."</p>

<p>Powers turned his head.</p>

<p>"Ransom," he called. "Whar be ye, Ransom?"</p>

<p>No one replied.</p>

<p>"He was right yere by me a few minutes ago," said one of the
younger men.</p>

<p>The question of Ransom's whereabouts was instantly, resolved.
From diagonally across the wagon circle came the sounds of a
violent scuffle. Appeared Tawm prodding the reluctant Ransom
forward with the muzzle of his rifle.</p>

<p>"I'd moved over from whar I was lying to git me a gourd of
water," explained Tawm, "and I cotched him just drawing a bead on
this yere stranger. I didn't know whether you wanted the stranger
kilt or not, so I kicked up his shootin' iron and brung him along
over. Did you want him kilt?"</p>

<p>"Ef'n we want him kilt, we'll do it ourselves," returned the
captain gravely. "You done right, Tawm. Git back to yore post, and
keep yore eyes skinned." He turned to Ransom. "Wal, Ransom, speak
up. What's the idee?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you," interposed Braidwood. "The idea is that I know
too much to suit him." He leveled a forefinger, like a pistol, at
Ransom as the latter opened his mouth to bluster. "You're at the
wrong tree, Ransom," he snapped. "You can't make this stick."</p>

<p>"No?" Ransom found his voice. "What do you know about it? This
title is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did he tell you that you are squatting on a white man's land?"
Braidwood dernanded of Powers, adopting the arrogant classification
of the "conquerors."</p>

<p>Powers shook his head with a certain rueful humor. "If we'd
knowed that we never would have come," he acknowledged. "But," he
added, "now we're here, I reckon we'll stay." The bystanders
uttered a growl of approval.</p>

<p>"The man's a renegade," broke in Ransom, "a bastard yallerbelly.
He's a white man turned greaser, and they ain't nothing more
despisable than that, less'n its a rattlesnake. And if I get a
chance I'll tell him so, the&mdash;" And Ransom added other and
more varied descriptions. "He ain't got no more right to hog the
land than any other goddamn greaser!" He was feeling the sure
ground of demagoguery beneath his feet and swept on in the specious
and oratorical sophistry of the land-grabber, more for the benefit
of the immigrants than for any effect on Braidwood. The latter
allowed him to finish, an amused half-smile on his lips.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's the talk," he applauded when Ransom had had his
say. "It generally sticks. But it won't stick here. You wish to
know why? I could give you several reasons. I'll give you two. The
first is that Jake Conger will see that it doesn't."</p>

<p>"Jake Conger!" echoed Ransom on a slight accent of incredulous
dismay.</p>

<p>"You doubt that?" Braidwood laughed shortly. "The Inspector at
present examining this land&mdash;who is, by the way, my
nephew&mdash;was appointed at Jake Conger's request. If you do not
believe that now, you will find it out later."</p>

<p>"I didn't know Jake Conger was int'rested in this land,"
muttered Ransom, obviously taken aback.</p>

<p>"You should better inform yourself before your undertakings,"
said Braidwood sweetly. "What has this man told you?" he demanded
again of Porter. Ransom recovered from his momentary dismay.</p>

<p>"I told him what everybody knows," he began aggressively.</p>

<p>The man with the square beard stopped him preemptorily. "Light
from yore hoss, stranger," he invited. "Looks like this will b'ar
talkin' of."</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>Braidwood sat leaning against the wheel of a wagon, his horse's
reins in his hand. The captain of the immigrants squatted to face
him. The other men, with the exception of Tawm and his two fellow
sentries, who stuck to their posts but cast longing eyes at the
conclave, drew close.</p>

<p>"What, exactly, did this man tell you?" Braidwood repeated his
question for the third time.</p>

<p>"Why, that this yere land was part and passel of one of these
old grants that was no good."</p>

<p>"I see. How did he get you to come so far down country? There's
plenty of land of the same kind nearer the city."</p>

<p>"That's tuk up. We're law-abiding citizens. We ain't no
squatters. That there land ain't open no longer: it's all been took
up&mdash;or declared reg'lar."</p>

<p>"And this was not regular and was open for entry. That right?
Well"&mdash;Braidwood turned deliberately to confront
Ransom&mdash;"he lied to you."</p>

<p>"Set still!" thundered Porter at Ransom's demonstration. "You
subside! You'll have your turn. Zeke, you see he keeps quiet. I
want to know more of this. Whar do you come in on this, stranger?
How come you know so much?"</p>

<p>"I am associated with Jake Conger," said Braidwood simply. "You
do not know who he is? Ask your friend Ransom. He'll tell you."</p>

<p>Porter glanced at Ransom, back at Braidwood, studying each from
beneath shaggy brows.</p>

<p>"Explain yoreself," he grunted.</p>

<p>"Gladly, and briefly. This man makes a business of settling
immigrants on land. It is but rarely that that land is actually
open for settlement. But he makes it stick because he is in cahoots
with political powers. In this case it happens that those political
powers are on the other side of the fence. Is that clear?"</p>

<p>"I hear you say it," returned Porter guardedly. "What you got to
say?" he asked Ransom.</p>

<p>Ransom had plenty to say in general denial and somewhat involved
rebuttal. His appeal was, naturally, emotional.</p>

<p>"May I ask a question?" requested Braidwood, when he had
finished.</p>

<p>"Speak up."</p>

<p>"Why did this man try to shoot me just now? So I would not tell
you exactly what I am telling you." He answered his own
question.</p>

<p>But Ransom pounced on his chance here.</p>

<p>"Hell!" he lied contemptuously. "I tried to kill you&mdash;and
I'll kill you yet when I get a chanct&mdash;because you had the
goddamn gall to fool with my gal, and you know it!"</p>

<p>Some of the younger men laughed. The reaction was decidedly in
Ransom's favor. Some cried out impatiently for an end to this
futile conference. The man with the sealbrown beard quieted
them.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute." He turned to Braidwood. "What you trying to do,
stranger? You ain't answered my question: whar do you come in? And
what you aimin' to do?"</p>

<p>"I'm trying to avoid trouble," said Braidwood desperately, for
he perceived the tide was setting against him. He turned to Ransom.
"You aren't going to make this stick, you know. Until this title is
decided to be bad, these people are squatters, nothing more, and
are subject to ejectment as trespassers. You and your like have
been able to quash ejectments on the Peralta lands, to be sure;
but, as I told you, Jake Conger is interested in this case. You
know what that means. There'll be troops down here, if necessary,
to make the ejectment stick."</p>

<p>"So you say!" sneered Ransom for the benefit of the immigrants,
but Braidwood saw plainly enough his concealed uneasiness. And,
indeed, the man was already casting about in his mind for
expedients by which he could, even without expected profits, drop
out of a situation that he foresaw was going to be too hot to hold.
In the meantime he must make good his temporary position. "Hell!"
he cried contemptuously. "Can't you' see this feller's a spy?" He
caught the stir of attention from the tall Missourians lounging
against the wagon bodies. "He's holdin' us in talk while his
friend, the renegade&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hesh, you!" commanded Porter. He turned sternly on Braidwood.
"Declar' yore self, stranger. Jist what are you after? What you
yere for? What you want us to do?"</p>

<p>Braidwood looked about him, appraising the sullen faces bent
forhis reply. His heart sank, for he sensed that he was in the
presence of an ignorance and obstinacy impervious to the type of
argument his civilized mind had thought to be compelling.</p>

<p>"I came here," nevertheless he said, "in the hope that a plain
statement of fact would bring you to a realization of your
position. You have been lied to by this man on every point, and
you've followed him with your eyes shut, like a pack of fools.
Why," he said stingingly, in defiance of the growl of resentment at
this, "you didn't even know whose land you were claiming! You said
so yourselves. You didn't even know he was a white man! You so
confessed!" He arose, deliberately flicked away the soil from his
pantaloons with his handkerchief.</p>

<p>"You going to let him git back and tell what he's spied?" cried
Ransom. He tugged at a pistol but was restrained from using it by
Zeke, who, nevertheless, looked inquiringly toward his chief for
orders.</p>

<p>"That's right!" "Tie the son of a bitch up." "String him up
where his friends can see him!" "Shoot him and have done with
it!"</p>

<p>One of the tall young men leaped agilely from the wagon box and
seized Braidwood by the arm.</p>

<p>"That's the stuff! Grab him!" yelped Ransom.</p>

<p>Braidwood did not struggle; nor did he appear to notice the
surge forward of the younger men. He addressed himself directly to
Porter. His voice was calm, his manner unruffled.</p>

<p>"I was allowed to come here freely," said he. "Am I not to be
allowed to go as freely? Is that fair play? What should I spy
on?"</p>

<p>"Let him go," said Porter curtly. "Let him go, I say!" he roared
as the man appeared to hesitate.</p>

<p>Braidwood mounted, lifted his beaver hat.</p>

<p>"I will bid you good day, gentlemen," said he. "I assure you, in
spite of Mr. Ransom's perhaps not unnatural suspicions, I am but
this hour arrived. My errand has been voluntary, and my visit to
you has been in the hope of rendering service to both parties. I
shall, however, report to Mr. Burnett that my errand has been in
vain. And, gentlemen"&mdash;his voice was cutting-"I do not conceal
from you that, though until now I have been neutral, I shall align
myself with his cause. Unless, of course," he added suavely, his
head high, his eyes glittering, "you elect to shoot me in the back.
That is your privilege."</p>

<p>"I reckon you'll not need to worry about that," said the man
with the brown beard with a quiet gleam of-humor. "We don't shoot
in the back&mdash;especially men with your guts."</p>

<p>"I thank you," said Braidwood, and executed again the same
riding-school half turn as before. But before he could ride away he
was arrested by an abrupt command from Williams, the old Indian
fighter, who had, throughout all the proceeding, sat back against a
wagon wheel, his heavy buffalo rifle across his lap, placidly
chewing tobacco.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, you!" said Williams.</p>

<p>The horse reared, half turned, came down on its front feet,
again facing the wagons.</p>

<p>"Well?" its rider demanded.</p>

<p>"What's that name you spoke?" asked Williams.</p>

<p>"Burnett?"</p>

<p>"The man who owns this land. Do you mean to say you don't even
know the name of the man you're trying to rob?" said Braidwood with
contemptuous amazement.</p>

<p>"I know, but what's the rest of the name?" Williams rushed this
aside.</p>

<p>"Andrew. Andrew Burnett," replied Braidwood.</p>

<p>"What for a man is he? About six foot or more? And is he a
homely kind of cuss with black eyebrows that go straight across?"
Braidwood nodded. "He ain't, by chance, still carryin' an
old-fashion long rifle looks like it was made for old Noah
himself?" Williams turned to the man with the square beard. He
appeared to be greatly amused. "Wal, Elmer," he drawled, "I dunno,
but it looks like it to me. You know who it looks like we're
buckin'?"</p>

<p>"No. Who?"</p>

<p>"I-tam-api," said Williams with relish.</p>

<p>"Sho! No!" cried Porter after a blank pause.</p>

<p>"Sounds like him," said Williams.</p>

<p>"Who's I-tam-api?" asked one of the younger men.</p>

<p>"Who's Kit Carson? Who's Jesus Christ?" Williams subdued this
ignorance contemptuously.</p>

<p>Porter's face darkened with sudden passion. He turned upon
Ransom.</p>

<p>"You mean to tell me you brung us all this way to put us down on
land belonging to a man like I-tam-api? Why, you pore&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute." Williams laid his hand on Porter's knee. "We
ain't sartin, you know."</p>

<p>Porter heaved himself to his feet.</p>

<p>"Well, we're agoin' to <i>be</i> sartin," he growled. "You used
to know him; come along. As for this pizen snake" he turned upon
the justifiably puzzled Ransom&mdash;"take his arms. Tie him up
ef'n you have to. I want him yere when I come back. Now, stranger,"
he said to Braidwood, "lead us up to this Burnett. I want to see
ef'n he is genuwine."</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>The two men trudged up through the mustard on either side of
Braidwood's horse. To his tentative questions they opposed an
obstinate silence. Over the brow of the hill Andy sat his horse,
waiting. With him were the Californians, some of them mounted, most
of them apart, squatted on their heels, their bridle reins in their
hands, silent and somewhat sullen over this distasteful turn of
affairs, for far up the valley the widening dust clouds attested
the scattering of the herds. Djo was there, and Leslie and Abel
Means and the two <i>california</i> youths who had been with them,
recalled by Andy as soon as he knew his position was no longer
secret.</p>

<p>The three stopped at the crest of the hill.</p>

<p>"It's him," the old plainsman told his companion.</p>

<p>They moved forward again. Williams raised his right hand, palm
forward.</p>

<p>"How, I-tam-api!" said he.</p>

<p>Andy's face betrayed a momentary surprise from which instantly
he recovered. He raised his own right hand in similar gesture.</p>

<p>"How!" He returned the greeting. His eyes searched the other's
countenance for recognition but failed. He waited composedly.</p>

<p>The big man stepped forward, planted his feet apart, spoke in
his great voice.</p>

<p>"I'm yere to say that ef'n we'd known who you are, we wouldn't
be yere. We been fooled. You won't be troubled no more, I kain't
say fairer. Come on, Williams." He turned to go away as though his
whole errand here were finished.</p>

<p>At the name Andy's face lighted in recollection. He slapped his
hand so violently that his horse leaped, startled.</p>

<p>"Seth Williams, by the 'tarnal!" he cried. He spurred his mount
sidewise to lean from the saddle in grasp of the other's hand. "I'd
never know you! You've done changed! What you hiding your face for
in all that brush?" His own face was beaming with an animation so
foreign to its customary gravity that the <i>californios</i> stared
in arrested astonishment. "My God, it's been a long time!"</p>

<p>"Rising thutty year," said Williams, his own face, even behind
its "hiding of brush," shining with smiles.</p>

<p>"You old horny toad!" cried Andy.</p>

<p>The two men pumped at each other's arms, too engrossed with one
another to notice for the moment that Porter had turned his back
and was walking purposefully away again toward the valley.</p>

<p>"Hi there, stranger," Andy called after the square sturdy
figure, "come back here! Whar you going?"</p>

<p>Porter faced about.</p>

<p>"Snake killin'," said he briefly and proceeded on his way.</p>

<p>Andy's horse leaped to the spur.</p>

<p>"Let be," he said, looking down from his saddle to Porter's
upturned face. "We got to talk this over. He'll keep. No object
going off half cock. We got to have a <i>big</i> smoke on all
this."</p>

<p>"I shore despise a coyote," said Porter, his jaw set. He met
Andy's eyes. "Ef'n you ask it, I-tam-api," he yielded
reluctantly.</p>

<p>"I do," said Andy.</p>

<p>"All right," said Porter.</p>

<p>Andy leaned from the saddle to clap him on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"I better go tell my folks." Porter turned away again.</p>

<p>"And I better talk to mine," agreed Andy. "Tonight, come
sundown. At the <i>casa."</i> He grinned. "I reckon we'll have beef
enough for everybody," said he.</p>

<p>The immigrant's eyes turned to the valley below and the fringe
of cattle carcasses across the wagons' fronts, and he, too,
grinned.</p>

<p>"I reckon," said he.</p>

<p>"Looks like the war's over," observed Braidwood dryly to no one
in particular.</p>

<p>"War!" spoke up Williams, almost indignantly. "Agin
I-tam-api?"</p>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>Chapter 15</h2>

<p>THE DUSK was falling. Russell Braidwood stood apart with his
nephew, staring in silence at the spectacle before him. He could
not rid himself of the impression that by some magic he had been
transported to the old romantic past of days long gone. He had to
shake his head and look about him with deliberately focused eyes to
realize that this was indeed the present, the year of our Lord
1853, and that this was the land of California.</p>

<p>Beneath the spreading oak gleamed a tiny fire. Seated
cross-legged about it were five men. They stared into the flames,
listening while one of their number talked. The one who talked was
on his feet. When he had finished, he sat down. Then whoever had
anything to say, in his turn, arose. This had been going on for an
hour. When first the five men had sat down, and before a word was
spoken. Andy had produced a calumet, or Indian pipe. Its bowl was
of stone and had come with him in his "possible" sack when he had
crossed the Sierra from the plains country. He had fitted it with a
long reed mouthpiece which he had decorated with feathers, so that
now again it was as it had been back in its Indian origins. This he
had stuffed with tobacco and ignited with a coal. When it was well
going, he pointed with the stem to each of the four points of the
compass, then toward the zenith, and downward toward the earth,
after which he took from it three long whiffs and passed it to his
neighbor. The latter likewise drew on it thrice and passed it on.
When it had rounded the circle Andy arose to his feet and spoke the
first words of the conference.</p>

<p>For a time Braidwood scarcely heard what was said, so fascinated
was he by the mere spectacle. In the shadows outside the
illumination of the fire many people stood motionless. In a somber
group to one side were a dozen tall Missourians, apart, their faces
stolid, holding together compactly, suspicious in spite of the
explicit assurances of their leaders, uneasy that their protests
had been overruled and they had come unarmed. The
<i>californios,</i> in gay contrast of raiment, were scattered
around the other segments of the circle; the <i>rancheros</i> and
<i>hacendados</i> in two close groups about Djo and Ramon, who
translated to them in low voices; the ranch people and visiting
<i>vaqueros</i> at a more respectful distance, watching these
strange proceedings with alert but unsatisfied curiosity. Of them
could be seen, as the darkness gathered, only an occasional gleam
of metal or of white, or some slight movement that stirred the
shadows. The white background of the <i>casa</i> more clearly
defined the women of the household: Carmel seated, her anxieties
but partly allayed; Amata on one side, leaning against the back of
the chair, her mother's hand in hers; old Vicenta on the other,
holding her great bulk tirelessly and defiantly erect. This was a
great multitude, for no human was absent from the gathering, and
yet no sound or whisper broke the stillness of the evening save the
slow-measured voices of the councilors at the fire and the faint
murmur of Djo's and Ramon's whispered comments.</p>

<p>Braidwood's quick imagination was afire. He was no longer in the
California that he knew. He was in a past of which at firsthand he
could know nothing, in a scene his eyes had never beheld. It seemed
to him that by the slightest shift of focus a hidden reality would
clothe itself in its proper physical seeming, that this grave small
group about the fire and the hushed multitude in the background
might transform, so that in his own proper eyes he would be looking
upon feathered and blanketed warriors. So imminent was the illusion
that almost his senses persuaded him. The dim people, waiting
darkened, reemerged: painted tribesmen, cowled and muffled squaws,
a gleam of tepees in the night. The soft evening breeze sharpened
in the chill of a greater spaciousness.</p>

<p>His eyes caught Leslie's. They were shining. Braidwood seized
his nephew's hand in a clasp of shared understanding.</p>

<p>The spell was broken by Djo at his elbow. Djo had for the moment
left his self-imposed task of translation for other explanations.
He was eager that his friends should miss nothing.</p>

<p>"It is a council fire," he said in guarded tones. "See how it is
made&mdash;The sticks are all pointing away from a common center.
And the pipe. Did you notice it passed from left to right around
the circle? That means it is a real 'medicine smoke.' If it had
been an 'ordinary smoke,' a 'friendship smoke,' it would have
passed from right to left. They are all old Mountain
Men&mdash;except the big man, Porter."</p>

<p>He glided away again.</p>

<p>"What, about that, I-tam-api?" asked the speaker of the moment
and sat down.</p>

<p>I-tam-api! There seemed to be in these syllables a grave and
portentous respect, a magic that commanded. And it came to
Braidwood that he heard in them the distillation of years of
accomplishment that had imbued them with this magic, so he looked
upon his friend with a new wonder of what those years had
contained, the years between, since he parted from this man as a
boy back on the old Pennsylvania farm; and that he looked upon a
rare thing, a life rewarded.</p>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>Chapter 16</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>THE COUNCIL was over, the council fire long since fallen to
ashes, the people dispersed to their rest. The guests of the
<i>casa</i> had lingered for a time in close discussion but had
departed at last for their quarters, some of them shaking their
heads doubtfully. It was not easy to forget at once the insult of
outrage, as they thought; they resented fiercely the death of young
Cermenos.</p>

<p>"But that was war," Andy had said reasonably. He refrained from
pointing out that it was also disobedience of his orders.</p>

<p>Afterward Andy, and Carmel, and Djo, and Leslie, and Amata, and
Braidwood had sat still later in the <i>sala,</i> for this was only
reasonable that Carmel should hear, And first Andy would talk, and
then Braidwood, Andy briefly and sketchily, as was his usual wont
save on occasion, Braidwood with the polished ease and fluency of
the experienced man of the world he was. Carmel listened, with
occasional questions, occasional small exclamations of surprise or
wonder. For, beginning with the day's doings and their conclusion
in the council of the evening, it was necessary for their
understanding to go on back and back into the past for explanation.
Russell Braidwood must explain his presence and the potency of that
presence, and that involved something of San Francisco, and his
business there, and Jake Conger, and what was his business, and how
it came about that Russell had influence with Jake; and that in
turn led across seas and continents to a great commercial house,
and Russell's rise in it, and his wanderings in its service, until
the narrative thus returned again to San Francisco.</p>

<p>"I was at Monterey." He repeated what he had told Andy on the
hill. "I heard vaguely of trouble in the valley. If there was
trouble I knew my beloved nephew would be in it. So I rode up to
see. That, señora, is how I happened to be here. Until I arrived, I
had not the remotest idea that Andy was here." He looked
quizzically at Leslie, who was somewhat flushed. "My nephew
referred to his host only as Don Andreo. So I did not know until I
had talked with you, señora, on my arrival. I feel flattered even
now that you so instantly trusted me, señora. I might well have
been a spy."</p>

<p>Andy looked at her keenly, for this point had been in the back
of his mind. But Carmel was undisturbed. She laughed with a gentle
and derisive scorn.</p>

<p>"I am not a fool, señor," said she. "I saw your face when I told
you my name." She added, "It was so happee," she explained to Andy.
"You mus' be the great <i>amigo</i> in the old day."</p>

<p>"Yes." Braidwood was thoughtful. "And yet&mdash;it is queer." He
turned to Andy. "Do you realize that we knew each other only a
little over three weeks and saw each other just three times? And
that was over thirty years ago! señora, the first time we met we
fought with each other over nothing until we both fell into muddy
ice water, and the last time&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The las' time his <i>padrasto,</i> the bad man, he whip you,
the horse, and order that you never come no more," supplied
Carmel.</p>

<p>"You know all about it!" cried Braidwood.</p>

<p>Carmel nodded her small sleek head.</p>

<p><i>"Si,"</i> she assented. "I know all about heem. That was not
easy, but I have live with heem nearly twenty years."</p>

<p>She smiled her slow smile in Andy's direction. "It tak' twenty
years," she added. Andy grinned at her.</p>

<p>"Well!" Braidwood considered this. "I never did go back to the
farm&mdash;could go back," he amended, "not until five years later.
I was away five years. Then I did. Strangers. Nobody knew anything.
I never could find out." He looked toward Andy.</p>

<p>"I tried to kill the brute," he said simply. "Then I ran away.
My grandmother died."</p>

<p>"He weel tell you"&mdash;Carmel answered Braidwood's look of
expectation comfortably&mdash;"sometime. If you ask the many
question mos' careful." She smiled at Andy affectionately, then at
Braidwood with so complete a wisdom of understanding that he
laughed.</p>

<p>"But through all these years," said he, "in spite of the fact
that I never heard of him again, that I did not even know if he was
alive or dead, I always thought of him, as you say, as a great
friend&mdash;I think, in a way, as my greatest friend, though I
have had a full life and have met a many."</p>

<p>"I think I shall love you for that, señor," said Carmel
simply.</p>

<p>Andy shifted uncomfortably. A faint color showed beneath the
bronze of his skin. Carmel uttered again her soft mischievous
laugh.</p>

<p>"He think so too," said she, "but he cannot say. Never can he
say."</p>

<p>"Shucks!" muttered Andy.</p>

<p>"You think this cur-ious, señor," said Carmel in her slow,
painstaking way. "I do not find it so. Do you know our California?
Have you watch how the groun' is hard like the iron, and it is
brown and dry and bare like the estone? There come the leetle small
rain, and it estop, and for a long, long time there is no more. The
groun' he's just the same, brown and dry and bare. And then, after
long, long time come more rain. And, pronto! In two-three-four hour
the groun' is not bare but is all green. You have seen that,
sefior?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Braidwood.</p>

<p>"That also is curious, is it not? A magic? But it is not a
magic. It is because in the heart of the earth"&mdash;she placed
her hand on her bosom&mdash;"something is there that waits. Until
the good God send the rain."</p>

<p>Braidwood looked at her with eyes in which was a new
respect.</p>

<p>"Señora," said he, "you are very charming&mdash;and very
wise!"</p>

<p><i>"Gracias, señor,"</i> said Carmel.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>It was well along toward morning. The others had long since gone
to bed, but Andy and his new-found friend had lingered on, and
lingered on, bringing together the ragged edges of the years to fit
neatly into continuity. Now the dawn grayed the windows, and they
were surprised.</p>

<p>"Too late for bed now," said Andy. "Let's go for a ride."</p>

<p>Braidwood assented and found himself laughing at himself. He had
ridden most of the day before and had sat up all the night, and he
had not the iron habitude of the old Mountain Man to such
excursions. Yet he was willing, even eager, for the excursion, as
for a refreshing bath in the morning.</p>

<p>"I don't know where my <i>mozo</i> has made off to," he told
Andy. He laughed. "I don't even know where is my room, or my
portmanteau, for that matter."</p>

<p>"We don't need him; we'll get our own hosses," said Andy.</p>

<p>They stole out of doors and across the dimness to the corral,
where the riding animals selected for the day threw up their heads
and snorted at their appearance; and Andy, to Russell's admiration,
roped two of them with seemingly careless flip casts, and they
picked saddles at random from the pegs and so rode quietly
away.</p>

<p>"We'll be back before anybody wants 'em," said Andy. "Besides,
there's plenty of saddles."</p>

<p>"You've a lot of skills, haven't you, Andy?" observed Russell,
half curiously, apropos of the accuracy of the roping. "Your life
has taught you a good many of them: Do you remember our shooting
match with the old rifle? And how you threw the knife at a mark on
the stump? Can you still do that?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't do much with it then," said Andy. "I l'arned how
later, on the plains."</p>

<p>Braidwood laughed amusedly.</p>

<p>"I thought you miraculous as you were then," said he; "I still
do. I never learned many skills&mdash;I can ride a little, fence a
little. That's about all. I've never carried a pistol because I
never learned to shoot; It's safer."</p>

<p>Andy nodded agreement to this last.</p>

<p>"As for what you call skills," said he, "there ain't much to
that. They're just what a man has use for in the way he lives.
Tools, sort of. A man looks foolish lugging around a lot of tools
he won't ever have use for, I reckon," said Andy shrewdly, "you've
got a lot of tools I wouldn't even know the names of."</p>

<p>They let it go at that and rode on down the valley in sociable
silence. They had talked much that night, and in face of the
growing morning there was nothing to say.</p>

<p>The light strengthened. Far across the greater valley beyond the
hills, the tops of the ranges were gilt with sun. Linnets, orioles,
and vireos in the treetops were awakening to song. Below them the
chirping birds were very busy, arguing officiously the dominance of
day against the last reluctant yielding of night. The floor of the
valley was milky blue with mists crouching below the triumphantly
growing imminence of the sun.</p>

<p>"Kind of purty, isn't it?" said Andy.</p>

<p>Braidwood breathed deep, again and again, of the air's
freshness, which of a sudden seemed to have grown perceptibly
cooler. He remarked on this. Andy nodded.</p>

<p>"Always that way at dawn," said he. "Ef'n I was blind, I'd know
the dawn by the taste of it."</p>

<p>Braidwood reined in his horse the better to look about him.</p>

<p>"Where does your land go?" he asked. Andy laughed.</p>

<p>"She's supposed to begin over yander, beyond that low <i>puerto
suelo,"</i> said he, "but Leslie's been telling me nobody could
even guess where she begins. I've sent for a surveyor to Monterey.
But back of us she goes as far as you can see over the slopes, and
a sight farther. She's a fine <i>rancho."</i></p>

<p>"Let's ride over to the <i>puerto suelo</i> and see what it
looks like at the boundaries. Is it good land? For farming, I
mean."</p>

<p>"It's bottom land&mdash;and water. Why?"</p>

<p>"That's where you'll have your trouble, even if your title's
right."</p>

<p>"That's what Leslie says. I reckon I better look after it."</p>

<p>"I reckon you'd better." Braidwood imitated him dryly. They
turned up the slope of the hill to the crest of the low ridge,
along which they rode slowly in the direction of the <i>puerto
suelo.</i> The valley of the <i>milpas</i> and the grainfields lay
at their right. Shortly they came opposite the wagon encampment. It
slept. Except for the lazy rise of a smoke spiral from a dying fire
there was no motion at the camp proper. Scattered over the sidehill
opposite, horses were preparing to abandon grazing for the luxury
of the first sun warmth. Andy looked down speculatively.</p>

<p>"What you so tickled about?" asked Russell, struck by Andy's
unmistakable pleasure.</p>

<p>"They got no guards&mdash;for themselves or hosses," said
Andy.</p>

<p>For a moment Braidwood did not get this; then he understood his
friend's gratification at this evidence he was trusted.</p>

<p>"Poor cusses," continued Andy. "They come a long way for
land&mdash;a long way, and a hard way. Thought it lay free for the
takin', all over the place. All they want is farms. It ain't
right."</p>

<p>"But surely there's plenty of land!" cried Braidwood. "Good
Lord, man, I never saw a rich country more thinly settled!"</p>

<p>"Not free land," amended Andy; "it's all been took up, one way
or another. Except maybe over in the big Valley. That's a long
ways. Oh yes, there's a plenty of land, and it's cheap. Why, you
can get you some of the <i>pueblo</i> lands, over Soledad way, or
maybe what's left of the mission lands for most nothing&mdash;two
bits an acre, maybe. But," added Andy dryly, "you got to have the
two bits. These folks ain't got a cent."</p>

<p>They rode on slowly. Suddenly Braidwood stopped again, this time
with a jerk that wrenched his horse's head around.</p>

<p>"What's that?" he asked sharply.</p>

<p>"What?" Andy's voice was unnaturally mild.</p>

<p>Braidwood pointed.</p>

<p>"There. In those trees. It looks like a man&mdash;hanging!"</p>

<p>Andy appeared to look. "So it does," he agreed.</p>

<p>"Ransom!" cried Braidwood in a flash of illumination. "Seems
likely," Andy agreed again. "Didn't lose much time."</p>

<p>"You knew of this?" he accused.</p>

<p>"Seth did speak of it," Andy acknowledged. "Seemed, way he put
it, a likely way to head off trouble. Sure to be trouble for
somebody," he added. "It's the man's natur'. Seth asked my
advice."</p>

<p>"You approved!" Braidwood was obviously shocked. Andy looked at
him with what Braidwood perceived to be a faint surprise.</p>

<p>"Why not?" he asked simply. "You find a rattlesnake, you stomp
on him. You don't leave him loose to sink his fangs in you&mdash;or
some other feller&mdash;next time you come along."</p>

<p>They rode on. Braidwood was no greenhorn. He had gone through
the Vigilance of 1851 in San Francisco. But even that experience
had not quite prepared him for this tranquil attitude of
indifference. He looked covertly askance at his friend. Andy met
his glance.</p>

<p>"It ain't purty," he acknowledged. "I don't like hanging. I
think myself I'd have shot him. Depends how a man's been brought
up, I suppose. I sort of halfway expected I mout have to do it." He
examined his friend's face keenly, again reined in his horse. "Look
here, Russ," said he, "this man had it in for Djo&mdash;for Leslie,
too, for that matter. And for you and for me and for these folks
down yere. He's the killer kind, and, what I hear, he's trained
with a rough lot. Sooner or later he's going to git somebody, and
git him in the back. No two ways about it. There's no sense having
to be always looking out for that sort of thing. No manner of
sense. Nobody's going to protect you ef'n you don't protect
yourself. I don't like it any better than you do. And, as I said,
it ain't purty. No sense in that, either. They ought not to leave
him hanging there. On our way back we'll just stop and speak to
Seth Williams about it. Let's ride."</p>

<p>He apparently dismissed the subject from his thoughts.</p>

<p>But Braidwood could not do so, at least for some time. He could
acknowledge the good sense of Andy's point of view, but he could
not yet understand it, nor appreciate that here also he was looking
upon a darker distillation of the years between.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>On the return journey toward the <i>casa</i> the two stopped
again atop the ridge overlooking the small valley in which were
encamped the settlers. Neither had spoken for some time. Each
pursued his own train of thought. Both started to speak at the same
instant. Each deferred to the other with a laugh.</p>

<p>"I was thinking of those folks down there," said Andy under
Braidwood's insistence. "They ain't the bad sort at all. Ef'n the
country's going to be settled, I'd ruther see that class come in
than many others. They've been raised to take care of themselves.
That kind makes purty good neighbors, ef'n you understand
them."</p>

<p>Braidwood looked at him keenly.</p>

<p>"What you driving at, Andy?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Why, I just thought"&mdash;Andy looked embarrassed&mdash;"that
a'ter all, they're Americans, and purty good Americans-and I got
more'n fifty thousand acres here&mdash;all they want is just farms,
where they can make a living&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I thought so," Braidwood interrupted with a laugh. "I've seen
it coming."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't take more'n a couple thousand acres," said Andy.</p>

<p>Braidwood laid his hand affectionately on the other's arm.</p>

<p>"What you need, are going to need, in this new dispensation, is
a business manager, Andy; and you'd better get one before you're
stripped bare. The old days are gone, and they won't come back. The
country is going to swarm with men out for what they can get,
sharpers, and what are called legitimate businessmen. You won't be
able to cope with them. They'll get everything you've got."</p>

<p>"I reckon I'll have something to say about that. I can keep
what's mine!"</p>

<p>"You don't even know the words," said Braidwood bluntly. "Your
rifle will do you no good. I've been talking to Leslie this
afternoon. That boy is smart."</p>

<p>"He's going to make a fine man," agreed Andy gravely.</p>

<p>"From what he tells me your boundaries and your titles are in a
mess, and if you don't straighten them out pretty soon you may find
you have no title at all."</p>

<p>"You think there's something in that, then?" Andy looked
troubled and for the first time somewhat impressed. "Well, I've
sent to Monterey for a surveyor."</p>

<p>"That part's all right. And what will you do then?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," confessed Andy.</p>

<p>"Did you know this," demanded Braidwood, "that it is the law
that every claimant<i>&mdash;every</i> claimant, mind you&mdash;of
land under a Spanish or a Mexican grant must prsent his claim for
endorsement with all documentary and other evidence within two
years? And that failing this endorsement the land becomes part of
the public domain? And that the two years are almost up?"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't," confessed Andy. "I've been too busy here at the
<i>rancho."</i></p>

<p>"Nor your neighbors either, I'll warrant."</p>

<p>"What do you do about it?" asked Andy with some anxiety, for the
hearing of this from Braidwood impressed him.</p>

<p>"Present your proof to the Commissioners," Braidwood hesitated
whether to go on. "And then, probably, appeal their decision to
local courts, and after that to the Supreme Court." He laughed at
Andy's expression. "It won't come to that. I'll engineer it for
you. Jake Conger is under certain obligations to me."</p>

<p>"Jake Conger? The fellow you was telling us about?"</p>

<p>"A lawyer," said Braidwood briefly. "I'll attend to it."</p>

<p>Andy knit his straight brows.</p>

<p>"How about Ramon? Don Jose? Don Nicolas? All the others? They in
the same fix?"</p>

<p>"I should think likely."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose you could&mdash;that this Conger
could&mdash;"</p>

<p>The horses stretched out their necks, dragging the reins through
lax fingers, Having thus filched enough slack from their riders'
inattention, they proceeded to crop mouthfuls of grass which they
tried to masticate around the obstruction of their long spade bits.
This was an intricate process, with little actual sustenance, but
undoubtedly a pleasing taste. They stared abstractedly into the
distance and revolved the soft cud over and over the rollers of the
bits, and green saliva stained the silvered plates at the sides of
their mouths.</p>

<p>Braidwood did not answer directly.</p>

<p>"Andy," said he, "I don't know the back country of your
<i>rancho,</i> of course, but isn't there good farming land
there?"</p>

<p>"Some. In pockets and spots. But that back there is mostly
grazing land. The land good for farming is mostly down in the
bottoms here, toward the river."</p>

<p>Braidwood nodded. "And," he pointed out, "I won't conceal from
you that you'll find, when your survey is made, that you're likely
to lose quite a strip of that. I don't know how much, but quite a
lot. These old claims always take in a heap more than was actually
granted."</p>

<p>"Think so?" said Andy. "Well, there's plenty."</p>

<p>"And," persisted Braidwood, "you're proposing&mdash;or hinting,
anyway&mdash;that you give away a couple of thousand acres more,
for that's what it amounts to. How much you going to have
left?"</p>

<p>"Enough to raise what I need. I'm a cattleman, not a farmer,"
said Andy stoutly.</p>

<p>"The future is farming, not cattle," returned Braidwood
succinctly. "What about Djo?"</p>

<p>Andy shifted uneasily in his saddle. The horse, recalled by the
movement, stopped munching at the grass.</p>

<p>"You see?" said Braidwood. "'I can keep what's mine.'" He quoted
Andy's words. "Can you? Will you?"</p>

<p>Andy brooded, his face dark.</p>

<p>"It's tough. They are good folks," he said at last. "I don't
know what they're going to do'!" He brightened with an idea. "This
extra land you spoke of that mout be outside the survey. Quite a
strip, you said. How about that? That's good farming land. Why
can't they take that up? How much of it you reckon there'd be?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't say until the survey is made." Braidwood answered
the second question first. "But in any case they cannot have
that."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because," said Braidwood deliberately, "I intend to file on it
myself."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Andy. He touched his horse to set it in motion. The
animal stretched its neck for one last mouthful of grass, snorted
and leaped as the spur bit its flanks. But Andy's face was
inscrutable. He instantly subdued his mount to a walk. Braidwood
spurred alongside.</p>

<p>"If I straighten things out, surely I should get something out
of it, shouldn't I?" said he.</p>

<p>"I reckon so," said Andy shortly. He looked straight ahead of
him. Braidwood surveyed him for a moment in private amusement, but
his own eyes were soft.</p>

<p>"Andy," said he, "stop your horse and listen to me. I'm going to
tell you what I'm going to do. I've been thinking and figuring
things over while we've been riding about."</p>

<p>"Go ahead." Andy reined in his horse.</p>

<p>"I'm going to take up, for myself, whatever of the present
<i>rancho</i> the survey cuts out. And I'm not going to turn it
over for settlement either to these Missourians or anybody else.
I'm going to keep it as it is. That's the first thing I'm going to
do."</p>

<p>"The second thing I'm going to do is this: I'm going to buy
sufficient land of the Soledad <i>pueblo,</i> or the mission, to
settle these people on farms to suit them."</p>

<p>For the first time Andy looked at his friend.</p>

<p>"Anon?" he inquired in blank astonishment. Braidwood repeated.
"What for?" asked Andy.</p>

<p>"To head you off from giving them your good bottom land, you old
fool," returned Braidwood crisply, "for that's exactly what you'd
do. These may be good people, as you say, but you don't want them
too close to you. They'd kill your game all off, for one thing,
and," added Braidwood dryly, "for all you say, I'd prefer to have
them live out of walking distance if I was going to raise
chickens."</p>

<p>Andy burst out laughing. In the notes of his laughter was an
exaggeration that, to Braidwood's keen ear, measured a secret
relief and perhaps as secret an apology.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you're right on that, Russ," said he. "It's a
first-class idee. I'll do it."</p>

<p>"You will not," Braidwood negatived flatly. "I thought of it
first, and I'm going to do it myself."</p>

<p>"But why should you?" Andy was puzzled again. "These folks ain't
nothing to you."</p>

<p>"Not one thing," agreed Braidwood cheerfully.</p>

<p>"And a'ter all, it's my <i>rancho</i> they're kept off
from."</p>

<p>"That's just the point," said Braidwood, smiling.</p>

<p>Andy shrugged his shoulders in despair. "I s'pose it's going
without sleep," said he, "or else mebbe I'm getting old and my mind
is wore out. Or else I'm crazy. Or else you are."</p>

<p>"None of 'em," said Braidwood promptly. "I told you you ought to
have a business manager, and I'm trying to fix it to get you one.
No, this is serious. I'll quit fooling. But first answer me one
thing, and answer me fairly and honestly. I know you will, for I
mean it. Do you like my nephew Leslie?"</p>

<p>He felt Andy's direct look boring into him.</p>

<p>"I come to love him like a son&mdash;we all do," Andy finally
answered with sober directness.</p>

<p>"Would you feel like keeping him on at the <i>rancho?</i> I
don't mean for a visit, but for always, to learn ranching, grow up
with it."</p>

<p>"By the 'tarnal!" Andy's face lighted up. "Would you want him to
do that? Why, he and Djo&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All right," Braidwood cut him short. "Then here is my proposal
to you. I shall, as I said, take up whatever surplus land the
survey shows to exist. That I shall turn back to you. This
<i>rancho</i> should be kept intact."</p>

<p>"Look here," tried Andy, relapsing in his heat to the
vernacular, "I don't need no pay to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shut up," commanded Braidwood, "and listen to me! I'm not
offering to pay you anything, and I'm not offering to give you
anything, either. Wait till I get through talking and then see what
you have to say. Do you always go off half cock like this?"</p>

<p>"Go ahead," said Andy, made meek by his own favorite figure of
speech.</p>

<p>"In addition," went on Braidwood in dry business tones, "I shall
permit you to reimburse me for the moneys I expend in getting your
friends their farms. They are your friends;" he pointed out, "not
mine. You shall reimburse me for that&mdash;and also for whatever
lands I take up and turn back into the <i>rancho&mdash;</i>by an
interest, an undivided interst, in the <i>rancho</i> itself, the
amount of that interest to be proportional, by appraisement." He
watched Andy's groping comprehension with delighted amusement. "In
other words," he explained, "I'm trying to buy in, in a small way,
as your partner. If it's agreeable to you," he added.</p>

<p>Andy uttered a wild Indian yell that startled not only both
horses, but Braidwood himself. The latter dodged a mighty swing
that probably would have dislodged him from his saddle.</p>

<p>"My pardner!" shouted Andy. "Why, you damned old horny toad!
Ef'n it's agreeable to me!" he mocked. "You mis'able hound! Hell's
flames! By the 'tarnal; I could chase my tail around like a dawg!
Is <i>that</i> what you're driving at? To blazes with all that
monkey work! That ain't necessary, and you ought to know it. I'll
<i>give</i> it to you, and gladly! You're my pardner right this
minute, from now on. You fix it up. Sooner the better. I'll make
you over a half share, and we'll run the thing together&mdash;you
and me. Braidwood &amp; Burnett, Business Manager and Field
Boss!"</p>

<p>In his delight the grave hard lines of Andy's face had softened,
so that Braidwood stared at it with amazement and a little awe, for
he thought to see again the boy he had known so many years ago.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>"Well," yielded Andy in reluctant resignation, after the ensuing
discussion, "ef'n you won't, you won't! But I sort of halfway hoped
you'd be here with us, at Folded Hills, and that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't forget that I've a great deal of business of my own.
You'll be seeing more of me than you want," Braidwood interrupted.
"I like this. It is California. The city is not. I'll be here a
lot. Though the city is an interesting place, at that. You'll have
to come to see me there. No, Andy; all I want is enough share in
the place to have some say-so when you try to give it all
away."</p>

<p>"Your say-so would always be good anyhow," Andy assured him
earnestly, "and glad to get it."</p>

<p>"I know. But then too, in case of any legal trouble I'd have
some legal standing, so I could do something. And then there's the
matter of Leslie. It makes a great difference to a boy of that age
whether he has a real stake in what he's doing, no matter how small
it is."</p>

<p>"I reckon you're right," agreed Andy, but still with reluctance.
A passing thought creased his brown skin with sly wrinkles. "I
expect that someday Djo and Amata will each git equal shares of
what I've got, so Leslie mout git to be a half owner after
all."</p>

<p>Braidwood looked at him sharply.</p>

<p>"Nothing could be better," he agreed, "but they're children! She
can't be more than twelve or thirteen."</p>

<p>"Twelve," said Andy. "I'm not talkin' about now. Near as I can
make out, they got about as much use for each other as Benito has
for grasshoppers. I can't see any symptoms at all. But
Carmel&mdash;" He stopped, laughed deprecatingly.</p>

<p>"Your wife's opinions have my profoundest respect," said
Braidwood.</p>

<p>"Carmel says it's a nat'ral ef'n Leslie stops here long
enough."</p>

<p>"I sincerely hope she's right," said Braidwood heartily.</p>

<p>"I'd like nothing better for him, myself. But," he warned, "be
mighty careful! The surest way to spoil the whole business is to
show in any way that you want it to happen!"</p>

<p>"That's what Carmel says." Andy hesitated. "Now about Ramon, and
Don Jose, and Don Nicolas&mdash;and I'm not so sartin Don
Sylvestro&mdash;"</p>

<p>Braidwood threw up both arms with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Hold on! Hold on!" he cried. "You're overestimating my
influence. I can't take on the whole of California."</p>

<p>"I'm not asking you to," returned Andy, "just these. They're my
neighbors-have been for nigh twenty year: some of 'em are
<i>parientes."</i></p>

<p>"Give me a list," said Braidwood. "I'll do what I can."</p>

<p>"Come on," urged Andy. "Let's get back to the folks!" He struck
spurs to his chestnut. They raced away in the headlong California
fashion, full speed, helter-skelter, without slackening pace for
hill slopes or toughness of ground. Andy's eagerness grew. He must
get home to carry to all his world his satisfactions.</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p>Djo marveled aloud at the way things work out in this strange
world.</p>

<p>"Think," said he to Leslie, "if you just hadn't happened
along!"</p>

<p>He seemed to consider, in the extravagance of his delight in the
arrangement and his friendship, that the outcome was all due to
Leslie, as, indeed, in it way it was.</p>

<p>But Amata was not impressed.</p>

<p>"Humph!" she sniffed. "I can't see he's done
anything&mdash;except to pick out a good uncle!"</p>
