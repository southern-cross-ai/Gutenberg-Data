  <h2><a id="preface"
     name="preface">PREFACE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">During the first few days of November 1914 Messines was
  lost&mdash; in silence; during the first few days of June 1917 Messines was
  regained&mdash;and the noise of its capture was heard in London. And during
  the two and a half years between these two events the game over the water has
  been going on.</p>

  <p>It hasn't changed very much in the time&mdash;that game&mdash;to the
  player. To those who look on, doubtless, the difference is enormous. Now they
  speak easily of millions where before they thought diffidently of thousands.
  But to the individual&mdash;well, Messines is lost or Messines is won; and he
  is the performer. It is of those performers that I write: of the hole-and-
  corner work, of the little thumbnail sketches which go to make up the big
  battle panels so ably depicted over the matutinal bacon and eggs.</p>

  <p>And as one privileged to assist at times in that hole-and-corner work, I
  offer these pages as a small tribute to those who have done so far more than
  I: to the men who have borne the burden of the days, the months, the
  years&mdash;to the men who have saved the world&mdash;to the Infantrymen.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="part1"
     name="part1">PART I. &mdash; THE WAY TO THE LAND</a></h2>

  <h2><a id="chap101"
     name="chap101">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It came suddenly when it did come, it may be remembered.
  Every one knew it was coming, and yet&mdash;it was all so impossible, so
  incredible. I remember Clive Draycott looking foolishly at his recall
  telegram in the club&mdash;he had just come home on leave from
  Egypt&mdash;and then brandishing it in front of my nose.</p>

  <p>"My dear old boy," he remarked peevishly, "it's out of the question. I'm
  shooting on the 12th."</p>

  <p>But he crossed the next day to Boulogne.</p>

  <p>It was a Sunday morning, and Folkestone looked just the same as it always
  did look. Down by the Pavilion Hotel the usual crowd of Knuts in very tight
  trousers and very yellow shoes, with suits most obviously bought off the peg,
  wandered about with ladies of striking aspect. Occasional snatches of
  conversation, stray gems of wit, scintillated through the tranquil August
  air, and came familiarly to the ears of a party of some half-dozen men who
  stood by a pile of baggage at the entrance to the hotel.</p>

  <p>"Go hon, Bill; you hare a caution, not 'arf." A shrill girlish giggle, a
  playful jerk of the "caution's" arm, a deprecating noise from his manly lips,
  which may have been caused by bashfulness at the compliment, or more probably
  by the unconsumed portion of the morning Woodbine, and the couple moved out
  of hearing.</p>

  <p>"I wonder," said a voice from the group, "if we are looking on the passing
  of the breed."</p>

  <p>He was a tall, thin, spare fellow, the man who spoke; and amongst other
  labels on his baggage was one marked Khartoum. His hands were sinewy and his
  face was bronzed, while his eyes, brown and deep-set, held in them the glint
  of the desert places of the earth: the mark of the jungle where birds flit
  through the shadows like bars of glorious colour; the mark of the swamp where
  the ague mists lie dank and stagnant in the rays of the morning sun.</p>

  <p>No one answered his remark; it seemed unnecessary, and each was busy with
  his own thoughts. What did the next few days hold in store for the world, for
  England, for him? The ghastly, haunting fear that possibly they held nothing
  for England gnawed at men's hearts. It would be incredible, inconceivable;
  but impossible things had happened before. Many must have felt that fear, but
  to none can it have been quite so personal, so hideously personal, as to the
  officers of the old Army and the Navy. To them it was as if their own honour
  were at stake, and I can see now a man opposite me almost sobbing with the
  fury and the shame of it when for a while we thought&mdash;the worst. But
  that was later.</p>

  <p>"Time to go on board, gentlemen."</p>

  <p>Almost as beings from another world, they passed through the noisy throng,
  so utterly inconsequent, so absolutely ignorant and careless. One cannot help
  wondering now just how that throng has answered the great call; how many lie
  in nameless graves, with the remnants of Ypres standing sentinel to their
  last sleep; how many have fought and cursed and killed in the mud-holes of
  the Somme; how many have chosen the other path, and even though they had no
  skill and aptitude to recommend them, are earning now their three and four
  pounds a week making munitions. But they <i>have</i> answered the call, that
  throng and others like them; they <i>have</i> learned out of the book of life
  and death; and perhaps the tall man with the bronzed face might find the
  answer to his question could he see England today. Only he lies somewhere
  between Fletre and Meteren, and beside him are twenty men of his battalion.
  He took it in the fighting before the first battle of Ypres...</p>

  <p>"I call it a bit steep." A man in the Indian Cavalry broke the silence of
  the group who were leaning over the side watching the coast fade away. "In
  England two days after three years of it, and now here we are again. But the
  sun being over the yard-arm&mdash;what say you?"</p>

  <p>With one last final look at the blue line astern, with one last
  involuntary thought&mdash;"Is it <i>au revoir</i>, or is it good-
  bye?"&mdash;they went below. The sun was indeed over the yard-arm, and the
  steward was a hospitable lad of cosmopolitan instincts....</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap102"
     name="chap102">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"It is impossible to <i>guarantee</i> a ticket to
  Marseilles." So the ticket vendor at Folkestone had informed them, and his
  pessimism was justified by future events.</p>

  <p>The fun began at the Gare du Nord. From what I have since learned, I have
  often wished since that my mission in life had been to drive a fiacre in
  Paris during the early days of August '14. A taxi conjures up visions too
  wonderful to contemplate; but even with the humble horse-bus I feel that I
  should now be able to afford a piano, or whatever it is the multi-millionaire
  munition-man buys without a quiver. I might even get the missus a fur
  coat.</p>

  <p>Every living soul in Paris seemed obsessed with the idea of going
  somewhere else; and the chances of the stranger within their gates approached
  those of an icicle in Hades, as our friends across the water would say.
  Finally, in despair, Draycott rushed into the road and seized a venerable
  flea-bitten grey that was ambling along with Monsieur, Madame, and all the
  little olive-branches sitting solemnly inside the cab. He embraced Madame, he
  embraced the olive-branches; finally&mdash;in despair&mdash;I believe he
  embraced Monsieur. He wept, he entreated, he implored them to take him to the
  Gare de Lyon. It was imperative. He would continue to kiss them without
  cessation and in turn, if only they would take him and his belongings to the
  Gare de Lyon. He murmured: "Anglais&mdash;officier anglais"; he wailed the
  mystic word, "Mobilisation." Several people who were watching thought he was
  acting for the cinematograph, and applauded loudly; others were convinced he
  was mad, and called for the police.</p>

  <p>But Monsieur&mdash;God bless him!&mdash;and Madame&mdash;God bless
  her!&mdash;and all the little olive-branches&mdash;God bless
  them!&mdash;decided in his favour; and having piled two suit-cases and a
  portmanteau upon that creaking cab, he plunged into the family circle.</p>

  <p>It was very hot; he was very hot; they were very hot; and though Draycott
  confesses that he has done that familiar journey between the two stations in
  greater comfort, he affirms that never has he done it with a greater sense of
  elation and triumph. The boat train to Marseilles, he reflected complacently;
  if possible a bath first; anyway, a sleeper, a comfortable dinner,
  and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Parbleu, M'sieur; la Gare de Lyon c'est fermÚe." Madame's voice cut into
  his reflections.</p>

  <p>As in a dream he extricated himself from tonight's supper and three sticky
  children, and gazed at the station. They were standing six deep around the
  steps&mdash;a gesticulating, excited mob; while at the top, by the iron
  railings, a cordon of soldiers kept them back. Inside, between the railings
  and the station, there was no one save an odd officer or two who strolled
  about, smoking and talking.</p>

  <p>Mechanically he removed his baggage and dumped it in the road;
  mechanically he re-kissed the entire party; he says he even kissed the flea-
  bitten grey. Then he sat down on a suit-case and thought.</p>

  <p>It was perfectly true: the Gare de Lyon was shut to all civilians; the
  first shadow of war had come. As if drawn by a magnet the old men were there,
  the men who remembered the last time when the Prussian swine had stamped
  their way across the fields of France. Their eyes were bright, their
  shoulders thrown back as they glanced appraisingly at the next
  generation&mdash;their sons who would wipe out Sedan for ever from the pages
  of history. There was something grimly pathetic and grimly inspiring in the
  presence of those old soldiers: the men who had failed through no fault of
  their own.</p>

  <p>"Not again," they seemed to say; "for God's sake, not a second time. This
  time&mdash;Victory. Wipe it out&mdash;that stain."</p>

  <p>They had failed, true; but there were others who would succeed; and it was
  their presence that made one feel the unconquerable spirit of France.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap103"
     name="chap103">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The French officer in charge was polite, but firmly non-
  committal.</p>

  <p>"There is a train which will leave here about midnight, we hope. If you
  can get a seat on it&mdash;well and good. If not&mdash;" he shrugged his
  shoulders superbly, and the conversation closed.</p>

  <p>It was a troop train apparently, and in the course of time it would arrive
  at Marseilles&mdash;perhaps. It would not be comfortable. "Mais, que
  voulez-vous, M'sieur? c'est la guerre."</p>

  <p>At first he had not been genial; but when he had grasped the fact that
  mufti invariably cloaked the British officer, <i>en permission</i>, he had
  become more friendly.</p>

  <p>He advised dinner; in these days, as he truly remarked, one never knows.
  Also, what was England going to do?</p>

  <p>"Fight," Draycott answered promptly, with an assurance he did not feel.
  "Fight, mon Colonel; Þa va sans dire."</p>

  <p>"C'est bien," he murmured, and stood up. "Vive l'Angleterre." Gravely he
  saluted, and Draycott took off his hat.</p>

  <p>"Mon Colonel, vive la France." They shook hands; and having once again
  solemnly saluted one another, he took the Frenchman's advice and went in
  search of dinner.</p>

  <p>In the restaurant itself everything seemed normal. To the close observer
  there was possibly an undue proportion of women who did not eat, but who
  watched with hungry, loving eyes the men who were with them. Now and again
  one would look round, and in her face was the pitiful look of the hunted
  animal; then <i>he</i> would speak, and with a smile on her lips and a jest
  on her tongue she would cover a heart that seemed like to burst with the
  agony of it. Inexorably the clock moved on: the finger of fate that was to
  take him from her. They had quarrelled, <i>sans doute</i>&mdash;who has not?
  there had been days when they had not spoken. He had not been to her all that
  he might have been, but... But&mdash;he was her man.</p>

  <p>And now he was going; in half an hour her Pierre was going to leave her.
  For him the bustle and glamour of the unknown; for her&mdash;the empty chair,
  the lonely house, and her thoughts. Dear God! but war is a bad thing for the
  women who stop behind....</p>

  <p>And on Draycott's brain a tableau is stamped indelibly, just a little
  tableau he saw that night in the restaurant of the Gare de Lyon. They came,
  the three of them, up the flight of steps from the seething station below,
  into the peace and quiet of the room, and a roar of sound swept in with them
  as the doors swung open. Threading their way between the tables, they stopped
  just opposite to where he sat, and instinctively he turned his head away. For
  her the half-hour was over, her Pierre had gone; and it is not given to a man
  to look on a woman's grief save with a catching in the throat and a pricking
  in the eyes. It is so utterly terrible in its overwhelming agony at the
  moment, so absolutely final; one feels so helpless.</p>

  <p>The little boy clambered on to a chair and sat watching his mother
  gravely; a grey-haired woman with anxious eyes held one of her hands clasped
  tight. And the girl&mdash;she was just a girl, that's all&mdash;sat dry-eyed
  and rigid, staring, staring, while every now and then she seemed to whisper
  something through lips that hardly moved.</p>

  <p>"Maman," a childish voice piped out. "Maman." He solemnly extended a small
  and grubby hand towards her.</p>

  <p>Slowly her head came round, her eyes took him in&mdash;almost
  uncomprehendingly; she saw the childish face, the little dirty hand, and
  suddenly there came to her the great gift of the Healer.</p>

  <p>"Oh! mon bÚbÚ, mon pauv' p'tit bÚbÚ!" She picked him up off the chair and,
  clutching him in her arms, put her face on his head and sobbed out her
  heart.</p>

  <p>"Come on." Draycott got up suddenly and turned to the man he was dining
  with. "Let's go." They passed close to the table, and the fat waiter, wiping
  his eyes on a dinner napkin, and the grey-haired woman leaning gently over
  her, were talking in low tones. They seemed satisfied as they watched the
  sobbing girl; and they were people of understanding. "Pauvre petite,"
  muttered the waiter as they passed. "Mon Dieu! quelle vâche de guerre."</p>

  <p>"My God!" said Draycott, as they went down the steps. "I didn't realise
  before what war meant to a woman. And we shall never realise what it means to
  our own women. We only see them before we go. Never after."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap104"
     name="chap104">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Half an hour later he encountered Monsieur le Colonel once
  again, and suggested that they should split a bottle of wine together if he
  could spare the time. It was then nine o'clock, and the three hours till
  midnight loomed uninviting. His only hope, as he told him, was that the train
  at present standing at the platform was not going to be typical of the one he
  was to embark on. It seemed to be of endless length, and presented a most
  enticing spectacle. Four fortunates in each compartment had got the racks,
  otherwise the passengers stood: on the footboards, in the corridors, on the
  seats. If any one opened a door the pressure was such that at least six
  people fell on to the platform, and in one carriage a small <i>poilu</i> was
  being squeezed through the open window. In the end he went&mdash;suddenly
  like a cork out of a bottle, and the human mass closed up behind him.</p>

  <p>Draycott laughed, the Colonel laughed, and went on laughing. He laughed
  unrestrainedly, even as a man who enjoys a secret jest. At last, with some
  difficulty, he controlled his mirth.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur," he remarked gravely, but with twinkling eyes, "I fear your
  hopes are ill-founded. This is the midnight train."</p>

  <p>"Under those circumstances," Draycott murmured, with a ghastly attempt at
  mirth, "the wine is off. I must go and secure my sleeping-berth."</p>

  <p>Have you ever seen a fly-paper which has come "to the end of a perfect
  day"? Lumps of glutinous flies drop off on one's head, and still it seems as
  full as ever. It was the same with that train. Lumps of Frenchmen,
  permanently welded together, fell out periodically, unstuck themselves, and
  departed, only to return in a few moments with the long thin loaves of France
  and bottles of wine. Sometimes they got in again, sometimes they
  didn't&mdash;but they were happy, those poilus. What matter anything, bar
  killing the Boche? And that was the only thing in the air that night....</p>

  <p>In every carriage it was the same, until suddenly there came salvation. A
  horse-box, with two horses in it and some grooms singing the Marseillaise,
  loomed out of the darkness, and into it the fed-up wanderer hurled his bag.
  Yet again did he embrace every one, including the horses; and then, overcome
  with his labours, he sank into a corner and laughed. And it was only when
  they had been under way for two hours that he remembered his two other bags,
  sitting alone and forlorn at the Gare de Lyon....</p>

  <p>It was a great journey that. The heat was sweltering, and they stopped at
  every station between Paris and Marseilles&mdash;generally twice, because the
  train was too long for the platform. And at every station the same programme
  was repeated. Completely regardless of the infuriated whistles and toots of
  the French conductors, absolutely unmindful of the agonised shouts of "En
  voiture, en voiture! Montez, messieurs, le train part," the human freight
  unloaded itself and made merry. As far as they were concerned, let the train
  "part." It never did, and the immediate necessity was the inner man. But it
  was all very nerve-racking.</p>

  <p>At times there were forty Frenchmen in the truck, at others none. Whether
  they fell off or were pushed Draycott knew not: they simply
  occurred&mdash;periodically. One man disappeared for five hours, and then
  came back again; possibly he was walking to stretch his legs; there was
  plenty of time. But to those who travel in trains de luxe, let me recommend a
  journey in a cattle-truck, where, if one is lucky, one gets a front seat, and
  sits on the floor with legs dangling over the side; a bottle of wine in one
  hand, a loaf of bread in the other, and a song when the spirit is in one. No
  breathless rushing through space: just a gentle amble through the ripening
  corn, with the poppies glinting red and the purple mountains in the distance;
  with a three days' growth on one's chin and an amalgamation of engine soots
  and dust on one's face that would give a dust storm off the desert points and
  a beating. That is the way to travel, even if the journey lasts from Sunday
  night to Tuesday evening, and a horse occasionally stamps on your face. And
  even so did Clive Draycott, Captain of "Feet," go to the great war....</p>

  <h2><a id="chap105"
     name="chap105">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Marseilles has always been a town of mystery&mdash;the
  gateway of the East. Going from it one leaves European civilisation&mdash;if
  such a thing can be said to exist today&mdash;and steps into the unknown.
  Coming to it through that appalling Gulf of Lyons, beside which the dreaded
  Bay of Biscay seems like the proverbial duck-pond, Notre Dame de la Garde
  holds out a welcoming hand, and breathes of fast trains and restaurant cars,
  and London. It is the town of tongues, the city of nations. It is not French;
  it is universal.</p>

  <p>And never can Marseilles have been so universal as in the early days of
  August 1914. Usually a port of call only, then it was a terminus. The ships
  came in, but did not leave: there seemed to be a concensus of opinion amongst
  skippers that the <i>Goeben</i> was a nasty thing to meet alone on a dark
  night. And so the overcrowded docks filled up with waiting vessels, while
  Lascars and Levantine Greeks, Cingalese and Chinamen, jostled one another in
  the cafÚs.</p>

  <p>The other jostlers were principally Americans of fabulous wealth: at least
  as they thronged the shipping offices they said so. Also they were very
  angry, which is where they differed from the Cingalese and Chinamen, who
  liked Marseilles and prayed to remain for ever. But the Americans desired to
  return to God's own country&mdash;they and their wives and their sons and
  daughters; moreover, they expressed their desire fluently and frequently.
  There is something stupendous about an American magnate insisting on his
  rights on a hot day, when he can't get them.... It cheers a man up when he is
  waiting and wondering&mdash;and England is still silent.</p>

  <p>It was just as Draycott had made the unpleasant discovery that no longer
  did the weekly boat run from Marseilles to Tunis and thence to Malta, and was
  debating on the rival merits of a journey through Italy, and thence by
  Syracuse to the island of goats; or a journey through Spain to Gibraltar, and
  thence by sea&mdash;with luck, that a railway magnate entered and gave his
  celebrated rendering of a boiler explosion. It appeared&mdash;when every one
  had partially recovered&mdash;that he was the proud possessor of ten francs
  and three sous. He also admitted to a wife suffering from something with a
  name that hurt, and various young railway magnates of both sexes. It
  transpired that the ten francs and three sous had been laboriously collected
  from his <i>mÚnage</i> only that morning; that the youngest hopeful had wept
  copiously on losing her life's savings; and further, that it was the limit of
  his resources. He had letters of credit, or something dangerous of that sort,
  to the extent of a few million; he was prepared to buy the whole one-donkey
  country by a stroke of the pen, but&mdash;in hard cash&mdash;he had ten
  francs and three sous....</p>

  <p>It was pathetic; it was dreadful. An American multi-millionaire, one of
  those strange beings of whom one reads, who corner tin-tacks and things, and
  ruin or make thousands with a word, reduced to ten francs and three sous.</p>

  <p>For not another cent piece did America's pride obtain; not another sou to
  add to the three. Politely, firmly, a harassed clerk shooed him away. No, he
  could not tell him when the next boat would sail&mdash;perhaps tomorrow,
  perhaps in a fortnight. He did not know, and he did not care how he proposed
  to live during that period, and he had no intention of furnishing him with
  any money to do it with. He had definite orders from his firm: no cheques
  cashed under any circumstances whatever. He was sorry the gentleman didn't
  like Marseilles, or war, or France, or him personally; he regretted deeply
  that the gentleman's wife liked peaches with every meal, and hoped he'd
  manage all right on his ten francs; he&mdash;And then came the
  interruption.</p>

  <p>They crowded to the door, and watched them coming. Occasionally a cheer
  rang out, but for the most part they came in silence, passing through the
  ranks of people that lined the road each side. Half way down the column a
  band blared forth, and every now and then the Colonel in front lifted his
  right hand gravely in a salute. They were small men, the poilus of that
  regiment; but they marched well, with a swing, and the glint of white teeth.
  Sometimes they waved a greeting to a girl on the footpath, and she would
  smile back, or throw them a flower or a kiss. And like a ripple going down
  the lines of spectators, men took off their hats suddenly. The Colours were
  passing....</p>

  <p>Almost dazedly the American took off his hat as the ripple reached him;
  then he put it on again and turned to Draycott.</p>

  <p>"Hell!" he remarked tersely, "and I've been worry in' over a ten-franc
  note. I guess I feel a bit small." He turned and followed the regiment, with
  his hands deep in his pockets, and his shoulders squared.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap106"
     name="chap106">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It came through the following afternoon&mdash;the news they
  had been waiting for; and now for a certain period the curtain of discretion
  must be drawn. I gather that Draycott has dim recollections of a stout field
  officer endeavouring to stand on a small marble-topped table, with a glass of
  beer in each hand. He was making a speech&mdash;chiefly in Hindustani&mdash;
  to the frenzied mob of cheering Frenchmen around him. Then he came to the
  point when the best people say "Vive la France!" He remembered he had a hat
  on; he remembered he ought to take it off; he did. The only thing he forgot
  was the beer. But as he said later when they sorted him out, it was an old
  suit, and England didn't declare war every day....</p>

  <p>The following night they left in an ancient old cargo boat, skippered by
  the type of man who has since made our mercantile marine the glory of the
  world. His job was to get his peculiarly odoriferous cargo home to his owners
  as soon as possible; beyond that he either failed or refused to look. The
  entire German Navy might have been waiting outside for all he cared; he
  merely consumed a little more whisky, and conducted morning prayers. He would
  give them no assurance; they went at their own risk, but, if the boat got
  there, he would land them at Gibraltar. And having thought the matter over,
  and realised that firstly a journey through Italy might result in their being
  kept as prisoners of war; secondly, that a journey through Spain would
  probably take a fortnight at least; and thirdly, that any way they could do
  neither as they could get no money, Draycott and his friends embarked with
  the patent manure, and watched the lights of Marseilles growing fainter and
  fainter till they dropped below the horizon astern.</p>

  <p>It was an uneventful voyage, and never for one hour after the first day
  were they out of sight of land. It was the only concession the skipper would
  make for the safety of his boat; and so they jogged along at a peaceful ten
  knots and watched the sun set each evening in a blaze of golden glory over
  the rocky coast of Spain. For the first time since leaving England a week
  before, they were able to think. In the rush to Paris, in the horse-box to
  Marseilles, in Marseilles itself, they had been too busy. Besides, they were
  outsiders....</p>

  <p>Now, England was in it; the thing which they had known in their hearts was
  coming, ever since a kindly senior subaltern had first taken it upon himself
  to shape their destinies, had actually come. And bitterest thought of
  all&mdash;<i>they</i> were not there.</p>

  <p>"It can't last more than three months." A pessimistic garrison gunner from
  Malta, who was playing patience, cheated savagely. "I tell you no European
  country could stand it." Undoubtedly the fatuous drivel of certain writers
  had influenced even the Army itself. "Peace will be declared before
  Christmas. An' I'll have sat on that cursed island, and whenever I see a ship
  I'd like to poop at, the searchlight will go out, an' I'll be bitten by sand
  flies." He glared morosely at Draycott; until, suddenly, a dawning look of
  joy spread over his face. "It's coming out. I swear it's coming out!"</p>

  <p>"You cheated," remarked an onlooker cruelly. "I saw you with my own
  eyes."</p>

  <p>It was then that he burst into tears....</p>

  <p>Shut off as they were from the outside world&mdash;the old tramp had no
  wireless&mdash;they could only wonder, and wait, fuming with impatience. What
  had happened? Had the fleets met? Had the wonderful day which the German Navy
  was popularly supposed to be living for&mdash;had it arrived? And if it
  had&mdash;what had been the result? They could only lean over the stern and
  try and grasp the one monumental fact&mdash;war. And what did it hold in
  store?...</p>

  <p>Visions of forlorn hopes, visions of glory, visions of the glamour of war
  rose unbidden in their minds. And then, when they had got as far as that, the
  smell of that patent manure obtruded itself once again, and the dreamers of
  honours to come passed sadly down the gangway to the Levantine villain who
  presided over the vermouth and the gin. Which might be taken as the text for
  a sermon on things as they are. In this war it is the patent manure and the
  vermouth which dominate the situation as far as the fighters, at any rate,
  are concerned. The talkers may think otherwise, may prate of soul-stirring
  motives, and great ideals. But for the soldiers, life is a bit too grim and
  overpowering for gloss. After a spell they come for their vermouth, for
  something to help nerves a trifle jangled, something to give a contrast to
  stark reality, and having had it they go back again to the patent manure;
  while the onlookers see visions and dream dreams. I suppose it's a fair
  division of labour!...</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap107"
     name="chap107">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It was the distinguished-looking gentleman in blue who came
  alongside just after they dropped anchor at the Rock, who brought the
  glorious news. He ascended the gangway with great dignity, and disappeared
  into some secret place with the skipper. After some delay and a slight
  commotion, various flags were hoisted, and he majestically appeared again. It
  seemed that the hoisting of the flags had apparently been successful.
  Suspicion had been averted by this simple act; there was no longer any danger
  of being made a target for enthusiastic gunners. And, what was more to the
  point, the distinguished gentleman was now free to impart his great
  tidings.</p>

  <p>"The German fleet, gentlemen," he remarked genially, "has ceased to
  exist."</p>

  <p>"Who said so?" asked a doubting voice.</p>

  <p>"It is in all the Spanish papers." The Admiral, or whatever he was, eyed
  the speaker compassionately. "A great action has taken place in the North
  Sea; we have lost nineteen big ships in addition to destroyers, and the
  German fleet is wiped out."</p>

  <p>"It doesn't seem good enough, does it?" murmured a graceless member of the
  group.</p>

  <p>"But if it's really authentic?" Draycott turned to him doubtfully. "And
  there must be something in it if it's in all the Spanish papers."</p>

  <p>"On the contrary," returned the graceless one. "It is precisely that fact
  that makes me believe there is nothing in it."</p>

  <p>The remark seemed conclusive; and yet so detailed was the information all
  over Gib, so definite the lists of vessels sunk on each side, that even
  intelligent Scorps&mdash;as the inhabitants of the place are known&mdash;were
  impressed. Strangely enough, exactly the same detailed lists, with just
  sufficient difference to make them credible, were in all the Italian papers
  at the same time&mdash;though this only transpired later.</p>

  <p>At the moment nothing much mattered but the time of the next boat going
  East: it was their own little personal future that counted. A naval
  battle&mdash;yes, perhaps; nineteen ships down&mdash;the German fleet as
  well; fifty or sixty thousand men&mdash;gone, finished, wiped out. And yet it
  was the next boat they wanted to know about.</p>

  <p>Callous&mdash;I think not; merely a total incapability to realise a thing
  so stupendous. It has been the same all through the war: the tragedies have
  been too big for human minds to grasp. It is the little things that tell; the
  isolated thumb-nail impressions that live in one's mind, and will go with us
  to the grave. The one huddled form lying motionless in the shell-hole, with
  its staring, sightless eyes; the one small, but supreme sacrifice: that is
  the thing which hits&mdash;hits harder than the <i>Lusitania</i>, or any
  other of the gigantic panels of the war. The pin-pricks we feel; the sledge
  hammer merely stuns. And the danger is that those who have felt the
  pin-pricks may confuse them with the sledge hammer; may lose the right road
  in the bypaths of personal emotion. War means so infinitely much to the
  individual; the individual means so infinitely little to war. Only it is
  sometimes hard to remember that simple fact....</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap108"
     name="chap108">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It was from the top of the Rock that they watched their
  evil-smelling boat depart, to plug on northward up the home trail,
  unperturbed by naval battles or rumours thereof. And it was from the top of
  the Rock they first saw the smoke of the P. and O., outward bound, on which
  they were destined to complete the journey. Below lay the bay, dotted with
  German and Austrian ships caught on the high seas at the outbreak of war; a
  destroyer was going half-speed towards the Atlantic; a cruiser lay in dock,
  her funnels smoking placidly. Out towards Algeciras an American battleship,
  with her peculiar steel trellis turrets, was weighing anchor; and in the
  distance, across the Straits, Africa, rugged and inhospitable, shimmered in
  the heat haze of an August day.</p>

  <p>"So long." The gunner subaltern waved a weary hand from his point of
  vantage, where he was inspecting life with a telescope. "There's your barge,
  but she won't leave till tomorrow. If this goes on for much longer, my nerves
  will give way under the strain. The excitement is too great."</p>

  <p>It appears that Draycott had forebodings even before he got on board that
  P. and O. Since then she has become almost historic amongst those of the
  Regular Army whose abode at the beginning of the war was overseas. Save for
  the fact that no one was playing the harmonium, or any other musical
  instrument, the appearance of her decks as they came alongside was
  reminiscent of one of those delightful pleasure steamers on which one may
  journey, at comparatively small cost, up and down the Thames. A seething mob
  of people, almost exclusively composed of the male sex, glared furiously at
  them and one another&mdash;but principally at them&mdash;as they came up the
  gangway, and departed in search of the purser. All the stairs down to the
  dining saloon were occupied by morose passengers, and an enlivening
  altercation was in progress between two elderly gentlemen of ferocious aspect
  anent the remnants of what had once been a cushion. A mild-looking being,
  closely clutching a tired deck-chair, was descending to the dining saloon,
  where infuriated men were loudly thumping the tables.</p>

  <p>"Good heavens, gentlemen! what do you want?" A haggard purser peered at
  them from his office. "Berths!" He broke into a shout of maniacal laughter,
  and then pulled himself together. "The fourteenth stair leading to the
  engine-room is not taken, but there's an exhaust pipe passes under it, and it
  becomes too hot to sit on. There is room for two in a coal bunker which
  should be empty by tonight; otherwise, the hold, if you can find room."</p>

  <p>"But what's all the trouble," they queried peevishly. "Surely&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Trouble!" The purser swallowed hard. "We have on board eighty-four
  generals, two hundred and twenty colonels, and one thousand eight hundred and
  ninety-one what-nots of junior rank. They have all been recalled from leave;
  they have all come by this boat. The eighteenth breakfast is now being
  served&mdash;perhaps." With a dreadful cry he seized the brandy bottle, while
  they faded slowly and sadly away. There are things too terrible for
  contemplation....</p>

  <p>It was a wonderful trip&mdash;that final stage to the Half Way House of
  Malta. There was the dreadful incident of the short-sighted subaltern who got
  into a full Colonel's bed by mistake, when that worthy officer had just gone
  down on four no trumps redoubled. In vain to point out the similarity of
  engine-room gratings&mdash;in vain to plead short sight. The subsequent scene
  lingered in the memory for days.</p>

  <p>There was the case of the sleep walker, who got loose in the hold, and
  ambled heavily over four hundred infuriated human sardines, till he finally
  fell prostrate into what was apparently the abode of spare china.</p>

  <p>Last but not least there was the dreadful Case of the Major-General's
  Bath. Of this Draycott speaks first hand; he, personally, was an awe-struck
  spectator. Now the question of baths on that boat was not one to be trifled
  with. The queue for the pit of a popular play was as nothing to the
  procession that advanced to the bath in the morning. And the least penalty
  for sharp practice with regard to one's turn was death.</p>

  <p>Into the bathroom, then, prepared for him by a perspiring Lascar, the
  Major-General stepped. At the time Draycott did not know he was a Major-
  General: he was just a supreme being resplendent in a green silk dressing-
  gown. The door closed, only to open again at once.</p>

  <p>"I have forgotten my sponge," he announced. "I shall not be a moment." He
  gazed directly at Draycott, who bowed, choking slightly. It was inconceivable
  to imagine that the resplendent one thought he might&mdash;to put it in the
  vulgar tongue&mdash;pinch his bath. By nature he was a timorous individual,
  and that green dressing-gown&mdash;ye gods! perish the thought.</p>

  <p>It was while he waited humbly that the catastrophe occurred. Advancing
  magnificently came a second being, still more resplendent, in a purple
  dressing-gown; and he was complete, with towel, sponge, and soap. His eye
  would have impaled a London taxi-driver, and, scenting trouble, the Lascar
  made himself scarce.</p>

  <p>"It is preposterous to keep people waiting in this manner," he boomed;
  "perfectly monstrous." The next moment the door was shut and bolted, and
  Draycott followed the Lascar's example&mdash;just in time: green dressing-
  gown was returning with his sponge. In official parlance, a general action
  seemed imminent....</p>

  <p>It opened with the crash of heavy artillery in the shape of strange and
  loud expletives of an Indian nature, to be followed immediately by an attack
  in force on the hostile position. This resulted in a sanguinary repulse, and
  the attacking party hopped round, apparently in pain, nursing a stubbed toe.
  The temporary set-back, however, seemed only to raise the <i>morale</i> of
  the force; and after a further heavy bombardment of a similar nature to the
  one before, a succession of blows were delivered in rapid succession at all
  points along the front, which suddenly gave way and the victor was
  precipitated in some confusion, but triumphant, upon the floor of the
  captured position.</p>

  <p>How true it is, that great utterance of our hand-books on war! "Every
  leader must bear in mind the necessity of immediately consolidating a newly
  won position, in order to resist the counter-attack of the enemy, which
  sooner or later is bound to be launched."</p>

  <p>In this case it was distinctly sooner. With a loud shout the defending
  troops arose from a recumbent position&mdash;to wit, the bath&mdash;and with
  deadly accuracy launched the contents of a large bucket of hot water upon the
  still prostrate foe.</p>

  <p>"What is the meaning of this monstrous intrusion?" The battle cry of the
  purples rang through the quivering air.</p>

  <p>"You s'scoundrel! you impudent s'scoundrel!"</p>

  <p>With a loud spluttering noise the greens got up and assumed a belligerent
  attitude. "You m'miserable villain! that is <i>my</i> bath. How d'dare
  you&mdash;how d'dare you&mdash;throw w'water over me. D'do you know what I
  am, sir? I am a Major-General, sir, and I shall report your infamous
  c'conduct to the captain."</p>

  <p>"And I, sir," howled his opponent, "will have you put in irons; I will
  have you chained to the crow's-nest, if they have one on board. Keel-hauled,
  sir, amongst the barnacles and things. I, sir, I am a Lieutenant-
  General."</p>

  <p>Draycott was still slightly dazed when he landed in Malta.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap109"
     name="chap109">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Thus did he reach the Half Way House on his journey to the
  Land; and at that Half Way House he was destined to remain for a short space.
  It may be that there is a harder school than forced inaction; if so, I have
  no desire to become a pupil. "Those are your orders; there is nothing more to
  be said." Only too true; there <i>is</i> nothing more to be said&mdash;but
  thinking is a different matter....</p>

  <p>And what brush can paint the indescribable longing of those who were
  fitted for it, who were trained in its ways, to get to their goal&mdash; to
  get to the Land of Promise. For it was a Land of Promise; it was the land of
  the regular soldier's dreams. And in those days there was no thought of the
  dream becoming a nightmare....</p>

  <p>So Clive Draycott and those with him, in that little rocky outpost of
  Empire, carried on as cheerfully as a wet sirocco wind and an ever-present
  heart-burning to be in France would allow, and waited for deliverance.</p>

  <p>Perhaps they suffered more acutely than even those who were in the Great
  Retreat. Out of it, as they thought, out of it. Would they ever be able to
  hold up their heads again?</p>

  <p>And then the worst thing of all: that awful day when the news came
  through&mdash;the news which England got one Sunday. Fellows kept it from the
  men as far as they could; they covered up places on the map with their hand,
  unostentatiously; and when they had found Compiþgne they folded the map up,
  and told the men everything was well. It was that evening that Draycott and a
  pal watched the sun go down over Gozo from St. Paul's Bay, where the statue
  stands in the sea, and the shallow blue water ripples against the white
  sandstone.</p>

  <p>"My God! it can't be true!" His companion turned to him, and his eyes were
  tired. "It can't be true. We're b&mdash;" And his lips would not frame the
  word.</p>

  <p>Only, in their hearts they knew it was true; and in their hearts a
  dreadful hopelessness wormed its bitter way. But crushing it down there was
  another feeling&mdash;stronger and more powerful. England <i>could</i>not be
  beaten, <i>would</i> not be beaten; the thing was impossible, unbelievable.
  Triumphant it arose, that great certainty. It arose then, and has never died
  since, though at times the sky has been black and the storm clouds ominous.
  They knew that all would be well; and now&mdash;after three years&mdash;all
  is well. Their faith has been justified, the faith of the men who waited
  their call to the work. Only a small proportion remain to see that
  justification with their own eyes; the Land has claimed the rest. Ypres, the
  Marne, Neuve Chapelle, Festubert&mdash;names well-nigh forgotten in the
  greater battles of today&mdash;in each and all of them the seed of "a
  contemptible little Army" has been sown. Thus it was ordained in the Book of
  Fate.</p>

  <p>But at the moment there were just two men, sick of heart, watching the
  sun, in a blaze of golden glory, setting over Gozo....</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap110"
     name="chap110">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Draycott's deliverance from the Half Way House came in three
  or four weeks. With the men swarming in the rigging, and the Territorials who
  had come to replace them cheering from the shore, the transport moved slowly
  down the Grand Harbour past the French and British warships that lay at
  anchor. It would indeed be pleasing to record the fact that the departing
  warriors sang patriotic songs concerning their country's greatness; and that
  the officers with a few well-chosen words improved the shining hour, and
  pointed the moral of the great Entente with special reference to the warships
  around them. But being a truthful&mdash;or, shall we say, comparatively
  truthful&mdash; historian, I regret that it cannot be done.</p>

  <p>Such songs as did rise above the medley of catcalls and gibes of a dark
  nature which passed in playful badinage between the sister services were of a
  nature exclusively frivolous; and the conversation of such officers as were
  not consuming the midday cocktail consisted entirely of a great thankfulness
  that they had seen the last of an abominable island, and a fervent prayer
  that they would never see it again.</p>

  <p>The relief of it&mdash;the blessed relief! They would be in time for the
  end of the show any way, which was something. They were not going to miss it
  all; they would be able to look their pals in the face after it was over. A
  few, it is true, shook their heads and communed together in secret places: a
  paltry few, who looked serious, and spoke of a long war and a bloody war such
  as had never been thought of. Avaunt pessimism! war was war, and a damned
  good show at the best of times for those who were trained to its ways. The
  Germans had asked for it for years, and now they had got it&mdash;and serve
  'em right. A good sporting show, and with any luck they would get the fag end
  of the hunting at home after peace was declared.</p>

  <p>Thus it was, nearly three years ago; thus it has been, with slight
  modifications, ever since. A nation of sportsmen going merrily forth, with
  the ideal of sport as their guide, to fight a nation of swine, with the ideal
  of fouling as theirs. And so the world wags on in its funny old way, while
  the gods laugh, and laugh, and laugh....</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap111"
     name="chap111">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">On the boat Draycott hardly realised. For the first week of
  the three he spent in England he hardly realised&mdash;he was too excited. He
  was going out; that was all that mattered; until one morning his eyes were
  opened to his personal case. It is easy to see things where others are
  concerned; but in one's own case....</p>

  <p>He was at home on three days' leave, and the girl was there too.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!" he remarked at breakfast; "Jerry Thornton gone too." His eye
  was running down the casualty list. "Whole battalion must have taken it in
  the neck&mdash;five officers killed, fourteen wounded. I wish to
  heaven&mdash;" He looked up, and the words died away on his lips.</p>

  <p>"I didn't realise what war meant to women." His remarks at the Gare de
  Lyon hit him like a blow. For he had seen the look in the girl's eyes; he had
  seen the look in his mother's. Blotted out at once, it is true; effaced the
  instant they had realised he was watching them; but&mdash;too late. He had
  seen.</p>

  <p>"Was that Major Thornton, dear?" His mother was speaking. "The one who
  shot so well?" Her voice was casual; her acting superb. And God! how they can
  act&mdash;these women of ours.</p>

  <p>For a moment something stuck in his throat. He saw just such another
  breakfast room, with a woman staring with dull eyes at the laconic name in
  the paper: a name which so baldly confirmed the wire she had had three days
  before. Stunned, still dazed by the shock, she sat silently, apathetically;
  as yet she could hardly feel the blow which Fate had dealt her. In time
  perhaps; just now&mdash;well, it couldn't be; there must be some mistake.
  Other men had died&mdash;true; but&mdash;not hers. He was different; there
  must be some mistake....</p>

  <p>For each and every name in that list Clive Draycott of a sudden realised
  the same thing was occurring. And then he saw it&mdash;personally; he felt
  it&mdash;personally; he realised that it concerned him&mdash;personally.
  Those other women had looked, just as had his mother and the girl, a few
  weeks ago. Those other women had laughed and joked and asked casual questions
  to cover their true feelings, just the same. Those other women had been
  through it all and&mdash;"We only see them before we go&mdash;never after."
  In the theatre, at the restaurant, playing the fool with us, dancing with
  us&mdash;then we see them; afterwards&mdash;when the train has gone and we
  are looking out of the window or talking with the man opposite, then, we do
  not see them. And it is just as well. "Mon Dieu! Quelle vâche de
  guerre."...</p>

  <p>Something of all this did Draycott feel at that moment; something which
  caught him and shook him and mocked him. Something which whispered, "You ass,
  you wretched ass! You think it's you who will suffer; you think it's you who
  will be acclaimed a hero. Fool! Your sufferings, your achievements, whether
  you live or die, are as nothing to those of these two women. You may wear the
  cross for a moment's heroism: they bear it all the time. And they get no
  praise; they just endure."...</p>

  <p>Yes; something like that struck him for the first time as being personally
  applicable to himself. And having looked thoughtfully out of the window for a
  moment, he laughed gently, and then he spoke.</p>

  <p>"That's the fellow," he remarked quietly. "An' if the tea ain't cold I'll
  take another dish. Three glasses of the old man's port, Dolly, is enough. I
  had four last night."</p>

  <h2><a id="chap112"
     name="chap112">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A week later he sat in a mud bath at Havre, which went by
  the name of a rest camp; the Way to the Land was nearly trodden. Thousands of
  others had sat in that glutinous mud before him; hundreds of thousands were
  destined to do so after. And each and all of them were thinking men;
  wondering in a greater or less degree according to the size and activity of
  their grey matter what it was all about. To some the Unknown gave the
  prospect of sport, and they thanked their stars they were nearly there; to
  some it gave the prospect of Duty, and they trusted they would not fail. With
  some the fear of the future blotted out their curiosity; with others
  curiosity left no room for fear. But in every case they had something to
  think about&mdash;even if it were only the intense discomfort of their
  surroundings. And in every case the woman over the water
  had&mdash;nothing.</p>

  <p>By cattle trucks and carriages, by so-called fast trains and unabashed
  troop trains they left in batches big and small; and others came and filled
  the gaps. The Land was calling; the Seed must not be delayed.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"You'll have to wait till it's dark." A weary Quartermaster,
  wandering through Ypres, met Draycott and stopped. "Thank God! you've come.
  We've got three officers left and a hundred and twenty men."</p>

  <p>"Where are they?" he demanded. "How shall I find them?"</p>

  <p>"Very likely you won't." The other laughed mirthlessly. "I'll take you up
  tonight&mdash;we walk the last bit to the trenches. If a flare goes
  up&mdash;stand still; there's no other rule."</p>

  <p>"You're about done in, Seymour," said Draycott, watching him keenly.
  "What's the trouble?"</p>

  <p>"The trouble is Hell." The Quartermaster passed his hand wearily over his
  forehead. "Utter, absolute, complete&mdash;Hell. The boys have been in the
  front line for twenty-one days; and"&mdash;he spoke with a sudden dreadful
  earnestness&mdash;"the end is not far off."</p>

  <p>"My God!" muttered Draycott, "is it as bad as that?"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">No trenches, no dug outs, no reserves. Ceaseless German
  attacks, rain, mud, death. And then, three or four days of icy coldness, with
  the bitter Arctic wind cutting the sodden, tired, breaking men like a knife.
  Fighting every hour, with rifles and bayonets and fists&mdash;sleepless,
  tired out, finished. Only a spirit which made possible the impossible
  supported them: only the glory of their traditions held the breaking line of
  Old Contemptibles to the end. And at the end&mdash;they died....</p>

  <p>But their spirit lives on, undimmed, untarnished. It is the spirit of the
  New Armies&mdash;the Civilian Armies of Britain. They were training back in
  England when Clive Draycott went to the Land: they were learning the message
  of the old Regulars from New Zealand to Yukon. It is not learned in a
  day&mdash;that message: there is much watering and weeding to do before the
  seed can reach perfection, but the Land would not wait.... It was greedy
  then&mdash;as now; the only difference was the amount of grain available. And
  when Clive Draycott went to it there was very little. To God Almighty the
  praise. What there was, was very good.</p>

  <h2><a id="part2"
     name="part2">PART II. &mdash; THE LAND</a></h2>

  <h2><a id="chap201"
     name="chap201">I. &mdash; A DAY OF PEACE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"For the fourteenth morning in succession I rise to a point
  of order. Why is there no marmalade?" The Doctor glared round the breakfast
  table. "I perceive a pot of unhealthy-looking damson, and a tin of golden
  syrup, the greater part of which now adorns the infant's face. Why is there
  no marmalade?"</p>

  <p>"Could I remind you that there is a war on two miles up the road, my
  splay-footed bolus-booster?" With a grand rolling of his R's, the man who had
  driven a railway through the Rocky Mountains, and who now boasted the badges
  of a subaltern in His Majesty's Corps of Royal Engineers, let drive. "Ye come
  to live with us much against our will, because you're a poor homeless
  wanderer&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"All dressed up and nowhere to go," broke in the Doctor mournfully.</p>

  <p>"You come to live with us, I say," went on the Scotchman, "and then do
  nothing but criticise our food and our morals."</p>

  <p>"Heaven knows they both need it. Pass me what's left of the syrup, little
  one. Scrape the rest of it off your chin, my cherub, and wrap it up in a
  handkerchief and take it up to the trenches with you."</p>

  <p>"You're vewy wude." The junior subaltern adjusted the balance in the
  matter of the letter R with the Scotchman. Two months ago he had been at
  home&mdash;in peace time he would still have been at school. But of such
  mixtures is the present British Army made. "It's my face."</p>

  <p>As a statement of fact the remark left nothing to be desired; as a
  statement of expediency, when other infants were present, the same cannot be
  said. Words, in fact, were trembling on the tongue of a veteran of six months
  when the C.O. came suddenly into the room.</p>

  <p>"Bring me an egg," he shouted to the mess waiter in the kitchen next door.
  "Listen to this, my bonnie boys." He produced a paper from his coat pocket
  and sat down at the table. "Secret. A large object has fallen beside the sap
  leading out to Vesuvius crater. It is about the size of a rum jar, and is
  thought to be filled with explosive. It has been covered with sandbags and
  its early removal would seem desirable, as the sap is frequently
  bombarded&mdash;Damn it, this egg's addled. Take it away, it's got spots on
  it. Where did I get to? Oh! yes&mdash;bombarded with aerial darts and rifle
  grenades." He replaced the paper in his pocket and reached for the
  teapot.</p>

  <p>"Thought to be filled with explosive!" The Scotchman looked up
  sarcastically from the letter he was censoring. "What's it likely to be
  filled with?"</p>

  <p>"Marmalade, ducky," remarked the Doctor, still harping on his
  grievance.</p>

  <p>"In addition to that the Pumpkin desires my presence at the Centre
  Battalion Head-quarters at 10 ak emma." The C.O. was prodding his second egg
  suspiciously.</p>

  <p>The Pumpkin, it may be explained in parenthesis, was the not unsuitable
  nickname of the Divisional General.</p>

  <p>"Is the old man coming round the trenches?" Jackson, the subaltern in
  whose tender care reposed the crater of Vesuvius and all that appertained
  thereto, including rum jars, looked up with mild interest.</p>

  <p>The C.O. glanced at the message beside him. "'The G.O.C. wishes to meet
  the Engineer Officer in charge of Left Section, at Centre Battalion
  Headquarters, at 10 a.m., A.A.A. Message ends.' There in a nutshell you have
  the glorious news."</p>

  <p>Breakfast is never a loquacious meal, and for a while silence reigned,
  broken only by a few desultory remarks as to the vileness of the food
  produced by the officer responsible for the mess catering, and the exorbitant
  price he demanded for it&mdash;statements which had staled with much vain
  repetition.</p>

  <p>"For heaven's sake dry up," he remarked peevishly. "You've had sardines on
  toast twenty-one nights running; what more do you want? Listen to the words
  of Sapper Mackintosh&mdash;the pudding-faced marvel. This"&mdash;he held up a
  letter&mdash;"is the fifth which he hopes will find the recipient as it
  leaves him at present&mdash;in the pink, and with the dreadful pains in his
  stummik quite gone."</p>

  <p>"Our Doctor has a wonderful bedside manner," remarked the Scotchman. "Did
  ye no hear the story of him and the lady way back by Hazebrook?"</p>

  <p>"That'll do," said the Doctor, rising hurriedly. "She had very bad
  rheumatism&mdash;that poor girl."</p>

  <p>"I know she had, Doc," put in the C.O. heartily. "And when I think of the
  way you eased her sufferings I became lost in admiration over the noble
  nature of your calling. In the meantime I'd be glad if you'd see one of the
  men in the Head-quarters Section. From the strange explosive noises he made
  when I spoke to him before breakfast I gathered by the aid of an interpreter
  that he had somewhat foolishly placed his complete set of uppers and lowers
  on a truss of compressed hay, and one of the mules has eaten them."</p>

  <p>He strolled to the door on his way to the kitchen in the next house that
  served as his office.</p>

  <p>"You'd better be careful with that rum jar, Jacko. Unless you're pretty
  certain there's no danger, I'd put a slab of gun-cotton against it where it
  is, and pop her off. No sense in running any risks carrying it back."</p>

  <p>"Right-ho! I'll have a look as soon as I go up. Are you coming, Mac?" He
  turned to the Scotchman.</p>

  <p>"In five minutes, my boy. I have to perform a few blasting operations on
  my pipe before I start, and then I'm with you." He pulled a battered veteran
  out of his pocket, and peered into its noisome bowl.</p>

  <p>"Not indoors, man, for heaven's sake!" The Doctor backed hurriedly out of
  the room. "The last billet you cleaned your pipe in they complained to the
  Mayor of the village."</p>

  <p>"Go away, Doctor, go away. Go and put chloride of lime round the cook-
  house," Mac was shouting through the window at the receding medico. "And ask
  yon woman if she has a hairpin. My pipe...." But the Doctor was out of
  sight.</p>

  <p>Ten minutes later the room was empty save for a batman clearing the
  breakfast table.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Now as a general rule the Sappers do not live in the
  trenches, but go up there each day and most nights, the remainder of the time
  being spent in dwellings of dubious sanitation and indubitable draughtiness a
  mile or so in rear. To each company a certain front is allotted, and it is
  their joy and pride to maintain this front and the network of trenches behind
  it spotless and untarnished, what time they minister ceaselessly to the
  lightest whim of its heroic defenders&mdash;usually known by the generic term
  of P.B.I., or poor bally Infantry. Which, of course, is not what really
  happens, but one likes to think thus beautifully.</p>

  <p>In addition to the Infantry, other people thrust themselves forward in a
  manner which requires firmness and tact to deal with: gunners require O.P.'s,
  or observation posts; other gunners require trench mortar emplacements;
  dangerous men with machine guns sit up and take notice, and demand concrete
  and other abominations; while last, but not least, the medical profession
  demand secret and secure places in which to practise their nefarious trade.
  Finally, the Ordnance Department is with one always. It was that branch of
  the great Machine which caused the frown on the face of the Sapper Captain,
  hitherto alluded to as the O.C., while next door the batman cleared the
  breakfast table.</p>

  <p>"We're six bicycles short, you say, Quartermaster-Sergeant?" he exclaimed
  irritably, gazing at some papers in front of him, while he filled his
  pipe.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir; and two more with wheels buckled, and three that free-wheel
  both ways."</p>

  <p>"What d'you mean&mdash;free-wheel both ways?"</p>

  <p>"The pedals rotate, sir, with great speed, but the bicycle remains
  motionless." When a man habitually calls an armchair, A chair, arm&mdash;
  Officers, for the use of, one&mdash;his conversation is apt to become
  stilted.</p>

  <p>"How were the wheels buckled?" demanded the Captain when he had digested
  this great thought.</p>

  <p>"Two of the officers, sir&mdash;playing what I believe they called bicycle
  polo with a brick and two pick-helves&mdash;had&mdash;er&mdash;a slight
  mishap."</p>

  <p>"When did it happen?"</p>

  <p>"Er&mdash;after dinner, sir, one night." The N.C.O. looked tactfully out
  of the window.</p>

  <p>The officer did not pursue the topic. "Well, what about these six that
  have been lost?"</p>

  <p>"Completely destroyed by shell-fire," said the C.Q.M.S. firmly. "I have
  prepared a statement of what happened for your perusal and signature." He
  handed the officer a written paper and respectfully withdrew a few paces to
  avoid any semblance of coercion.</p>

  <p>"'The six bicycles were placed on the morning of the 10th ult. against the
  entrance to the R.E. Dump at A.21, C.2.4. It would appear that during the
  absence of the riders a hostile shell of large calibre fell on the six said
  bicycles, completely demolishing them, for when the riders returned after the
  day's work merely a few fragments remained scattered round the shell
  crater.'"</p>

  <p>The Captain read it over slowly, and then, in tones of awe, a murmured
  "Wonderful" wafted through the office.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon, sir?" The N.C.O. was again at his side.</p>

  <p>"I said wonderful, Quartermaster-Sergeant&mdash;quite wonderful. Do you
  think they'll swallow it?"</p>

  <p>"It has been done before, sir." The tone was non-committal. "And one of
  the six was undoubtedly badly punctured by a stray rifle bullet before we
  lost it&mdash;er&mdash;that is, before it was finally destroyed by shell-
  fire."</p>

  <p>"Right." With the air of a man who communes with great destinies, the
  Captain signed his name. "Anything more?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing at present, sir. The question of the consumption of Candles,
  Tallow dip, Pounds Twenty-four, stolen from our yard by the 940th Tunnelling
  Company has come back again with remarks from the Chief Ordnance Officer at
  the Base&mdash;but it will wait until you come back from the trenches."</p>

  <p>"I'm glad of that," remarked the Captain, rising. "I'm not feeling very
  strong this morning, and candles, tallow dip&mdash;especially lbs. 24 of
  them&mdash;would cause a relapse. Orderly"&mdash;he strolled to the
  door&mdash;"my bicycle, please."</p>

  <p>A few minutes later he was riding slowly down the road towards the place
  where there was "a war on." A cool mist hung over the fields on each side of
  him, and in the early morning stray cobwebs glistening with moisture brushed
  lightly across his face.</p>

  <p>"<i>B'jour, monsieur.</i>" A woman standing in the door of a roadside
  <i>estaminet</i> greeted him as he passed&mdash;a woman undisturbed by the
  guns that at times roared close by; a woman whose house was one concentrated
  draught, which whistled through what had once been walls and now were holes
  held together by odd bricks.</p>

  <p>He returned the greeting and rode on, while once again the
  comparison&mdash;never far absent from those who live "within
  range"&mdash;came into his mind: the comparison between England and
  France&mdash;between the country which has only learned of war through its
  soldiers, and the country whose women and children have learned of it first
  hand, even unto death. All was absolutely silent&mdash;the peace and glory of
  a summer's morning hung over everything, while the smell of the wet clover
  came faintly to his nostrils. A military policeman at the corner saluted
  smartly, while a small boy in a little cart drawn by three straining dogs
  raced him blithely up the village street. At the end of the battered houses
  still occupied by their owners, and the temporary abode of half a battalion
  of infantry resting from a spell in the trenches, progression by bicycle
  became a little harder. Great branches lay across the road, and pits torn out
  of the pave by bursting shells made steering a trifle intricate; while
  occasionally one of the many signal wires which had slipped during the night
  and was hanging low above his head, scraped the top of his steel helmet.</p>

  <p>Once more the familiar "<i>B'jour, monsieur</i>"&mdash;this time from an
  old dame who sat day in day out in a corner under a wall selling chocolate.
  Just above her head, so that by raising her arm she could have touched it,
  the nose of a "dud" German shell poked out from the brickwork.</p>

  <p>Ruin, desolation&mdash;and shrouding it all the cool damp mist of seven
  o'clock in July.</p>

  <p>"The very man!" A voice hailed him from behind, and a gunner subaltern
  materialised. "Are you going up the line?"</p>

  <p>"I am&mdash;at once." The Sapper placed his bicycle against a heap of
  sandbags. "What does my dear one desire?</p>

  <p>"The accursed Hun placed two large obuses into the Ritz yesterday
  afternoon. What do you propose to do about it?" They were strolling slowly
  through the sopping grass.</p>

  <p>"Nothing&mdash;if I can possibly avoid it," answered the Sapper firmly.
  "You select for an O.P. the most prominent house in the locality&mdash; put a
  signaller on the top of it with a large flag&mdash;wait till midday, when the
  sun is at its brightest, and then send a message back that the bully beef is
  bad. You&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Laddie," interrupted the gunner, "desist. All that you say is true and
  more&mdash;but we must stick to the Ritz, if we can. It commands a soul-
  inspiring view of the trenches behind that new crater in a way we can't get
  from anywhere else. What I want you to do is to cover the cellar with boards.
  Yesterday the second shell knocked two men insensible, and they fell
  backwards into it. As they nearly drowned, it will be obvious, even to your
  intelligence, that it contains&mdash;amongst other things&mdash;water.
  Moreover, the water is deep, and stinketh. If, therefore, my brainy
  <i>confrþre</i>, you will authorise me to draw planks twelve, I myself will
  cover yon hole with my own fair hands. The cadaverous gentleman at your
  store, whose face has been passed over by some heavy body, proved both
  unsympathetic and suspicious this morning when I asked him for them.
  Wherefore, if you will sign&mdash;" He held out a book to the Sapper.</p>

  <p>"'Please issue bearer with twelve planks 9 inch by 2 inch; length, 6
  feet.'" The Sapper glanced at the page and signed. "There you are, James.
  Tell him to get them cut for you."</p>

  <p>"I was going to, dearie. How marvellously your brain grasps the importance
  of these trifling details! Are you passing the Ritz by any chance? If so,
  tell my warriors to come down to the Store."</p>

  <p>"Aren't you coming up?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;it's too light. I have to be careful whom I'm seen with." He
  turned back and was quickly lost in the white mist&mdash;though for some time
  afterwards the faint strains of musical items selected from <i>The Bing
  Boys</i> followed the Sapper as he walked on.</p>

  <p>Occasional voices came mysteriously from apparently nowhere, as a party of
  men went up one of the deep communication trenches close by him&mdash;a
  trench invisible in summer until you actually stood over it, for the long
  rank grass hid everything: grass splashed with the red of great masses of
  poppies, and the white of the daisies, with odd little patches of blue
  cornflowers and borage, and buttercups glinting yellow. Just rank luxuriant
  vegetation, run wild&mdash;untouched for more than a year.</p>

  <p>Suddenly out of the mist there loomed the Ritz&mdash;the name of the
  broken-down, shell-battered house which served his late companion as an O.P.
  The Sapper gave the message as requested, and stepped down three stairs into
  the communication trench, which passed close under one of the crumbling
  walls. There was no necessity, as far as safety was concerned, to get into
  the trench for several hundred yards&mdash;the mist effectually prevented any
  chance of being seen from the German lines half a mile farther on.</p>

  <p>But he was mindful to see the condition of the trench&mdash; whether the
  sides were crumbling, and whether the floor was suitably provided with
  trench-boards and bricks. Twisting, winding with the poppies and the weeds
  meeting over his head, and the water brushing off them against his face and
  coat, he walked slowly on. Seven feet deep, perhaps three feet wide, it might
  have been a sunken Devonshire lane in model, and a faint red tinge in the
  soil helped the illusion.</p>

  <p>Stale as it all was, unprofitable and a weariness to the flesh as it had
  all become, the strangeness of it still struck him at times. He wondered
  lazily what the people he knew at home would think if they were following him
  at that moment on a tour of inspection. Especially his Uncle John. Uncle John
  was something in the City, and looked it. He lived near Ascot, and nightly
  slept with a gas-mask beside his bed. He could imagine Uncle John trembling
  audibly in that quiet model lane, and assuring his faithful wife of his
  ability to protect her. He laughed at the picture in his mind, and then with
  a slight frown stopped.</p>

  <p>The trench bent sharply to the right, and almost subconsciously he noticed
  a hole framed in thick wood, half filled in, in the wall in front of him. The
  top had broken. He bent and peered through it. It went right through the wall
  in front, and beyond, the same deep communication trench could be seen
  stretching away. Just a loophole placed in a traverse through which a rifle
  could be fired along a straight thirty yards of trench, if the Germans ever
  got in. But to fire a rifle to any purpose the loop-hole must not be broken,
  and so the Sapper made a note before resuming his stroll.</p>

  <p>Rounding a bend, a big white board at a cross-roads confronted him. It
  advertised two or three salient facts written in large black letters. It
  appeared that by turning to the right one would ultimately reach Leicester
  Square and an aid post, to say nothing of the Charing Cross Road, which was a
  down trench. By turning to the left, on the contrary, one would reach Regent
  Street and a pump. It also stated that the name of our wanderer's present
  route was the Haymarket, and further affirmed that it was an up trench. For
  it will be plain to all that, where a trench is but three feet wide, it is
  essential not to have men going both ways in it&mdash;and further, it will
  also be plain why the aid posts occur in the down ones.</p>

  <p>A further interesting and momentous piece of information was imparted from
  another board, to the effect that the name of the trench by which one could
  reach the pump on one hand and the aid post on the other was Piccadilly, and
  that it constituted the reserve line of the position.</p>

  <p>In other words, it was not merely a communication trench, but was recessed
  and traversed like a fire trench. In very fact, it was a fire
  trench&mdash;the third of the system. In front was the support line, known as
  Pall Mall, and in front of that, again, the firing line, whither later the
  Sapper proposed to wend his way. He wanted to gaze on "the rum jar reputed to
  be filled with explosive." But in the meantime there was the question of the
  pump&mdash;the ever-present question which is associated with all pumps. To
  work or not to work, and the answer is generally in the negative.</p>

  <p>He turned to the left down Piccadilly, wondering what particular ailment
  had attacked this specimen of the breed, and had caused the Adjutant of the
  battalion to write winged words anent it. The aspect of the trench had
  changed; no longer did the red, white, and blue of the tangled wild flowers
  meet over his head, but grey and drab the sandbag walls rose on each side of
  him. Occasionally the mouth of a dug-out yawned in the front of the trench, a
  dark passage cased in with timber, sloping steeply down to the cave below.
  Voices, and sometimes snores, came drowsily up from the bottom, where odd
  bunches of the South Loamshires for a space existed beautifully.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, old man&mdash;how's life?" He rounded a traverse to find an
  officer of the battalion lathering his chin for his morning shave. A cracked
  mirror was scotched up between two sandbags, and a small indiarubber basin
  leaked stealthily on the firing step.</p>

  <p>"So-so! That bally pump of yours won't work again, or so the cook says.
  Jenkins, pass the word along for Smithson. He is the cook, and will tell you
  the whole sordid story."</p>

  <p>"Quiet night?" The Sapper sat down and refilled his pipe.</p>

  <p>"Fairly. They caught one of our fellows in the entrance to his dug-out up
  in the front line with an aerial dart about seven o'clock. Landed just at the
  entrance. Blew the top of his head off. Good boy, too&mdash;just been given
  his stripe. Oh, Smithson!&mdash;tell the Engineer officer about that pump.
  Confound!&mdash;I've shaved a mosquito bite!"</p>

  <p>The cook&mdash;a veteran of many years&mdash;looked at the placidly
  smoking Sapper and cleared his throat. On any subject he was an artist; on
  pumps and the deficiencies of Ally Sloper's Cavalry&mdash;as the A.S.C. is
  vulgarly known&mdash;he was a genius.</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, it's like this 'ere. That there pump is a funny kind o' pump.
  Sometimes it gives you water and sometimes it don't."</p>

  <p>"You surprise me," murmured the Sapper.</p>

  <p>"Now, if I might be so bold, sir, I would suggest that another well be
  sunk, sir&mdash;starting fresh-like from the beginning. Then I could keep my
  heye on it, and see that no one wasn't a-monkeying with it. As it is, wot
  with the stuff we're a-getting and the shortage of tea and the distance I
  'ave to go for water, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, what do you expect?" A bitter voice from round the traverse rudely
  interrupted the discourse. "We make pumps to pump water&mdash;not dead rats.
  Wasting my time, that's what it is. Where 'ave I put it? In that there
  perisher Smithson's dug-out, and 'e can 'ave it for his dinner." The plumber
  previously sent up on receipt of the Adjutant's note came round the corner,
  and, seeing his officer, stopped and saluted.</p>

  <p>"That there pump's all right, sir. There was a dead rat in it. They
  <i>will</i> leave the cover off the well." He perceived the horrified
  Smithson, and fixed him with the frozen eye.</p>

  <p>"Right. Then you can rejoin your section." The Sapper rose, the plumber
  departed, the cook faded away, and for a space there was silence.</p>

  <p>"Damn that fellow Smithson&mdash;he's the limit." The Infantry Officer
  laughed. "I'll rend him for this."</p>

  <p>"Sometimes it gives you water, and sometimes it don't," remarked the
  Sapper pensively. "Last time it was a sock. Bye-bye. I hope he'll enjoy his
  dinner."</p>

  <p>He followed the plumber back along Piccadilly, composing in his mind a
  suitable answer to the message of despair from the Adjutant.</p>

  <p>"With ref. to your min. of yesterday I would suggest that a larger flow of
  somewhat purer water would be available if the practice of inserting deceased
  rodents in the delivery pipe was discontinued forthwith. I am fully alive to
  the fact that what the eye does not see the heart does not grieve about, and
  I realise that, viewed from that standpoint only, the grave of the little
  animal in question could not well be improved on. I also realise that it adds
  that flavour to the tea which is so sought after by the true connoisseur.
  But, desiring to view the matter from the clearer vantage point of an
  unbiassed onlooker, I venture to suggest&mdash;"</p>

  <p>His meditations were interrupted by a procession of gunners each carrying
  on his shoulder an unpleasant-looking object which resembled a gigantic dumb-
  bell with only one blob on the end&mdash;a huge spherical cannon-ball on a
  steel stalk. They were coming from Leicester Square, and he met them just as
  they turned up the Haymarket. Waiting until they had all gone by, he followed
  on in the rear of the party, which suddenly turned sharp to the left, and
  disappeared into the bowels of the earth.</p>

  <p>"No. 7," murmured the Sapper to himself. "I wonder if the officer is new?"
  He turned to a bombardier standing at the entrance to the passage. "Is your
  officer here?"</p>

  <p>"He's down below, sir." The man drew to one side, and the Sapper passed up
  a narrow deep trench and went "down below" to the trench-mortar emplacement,
  a cave hewn out of the ground much on the principle of an ordinary dug-out.
  But there were certain great differences; for half the roof had been removed,
  and through the hole thus formed streamed in the early morning sun. A screen
  of rabbit wire covered with bits of grass, lying horizontally over the open
  hole when the gun was not firing, helped to conceal it from the prying eyes
  of Hun aeroplanes. Let into the ground and mounted and clamped to a stand was
  the mortar itself&mdash;while beside it sat a very young gunner officer, much
  in the attitude of a mother beside her firstborn. He was obviously new to the
  game, and the Sapper surveyed him with indulgent eye.</p>

  <p>"Good morning." The Gunner looked up quickly. "I'm the Sapper Officer on
  this bit of line. You've just come in, haven't you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, early this morning. Everything seems very quiet here."</p>

  <p>"From four till eight or nine it's always peaceful. But I don't know that
  you'll find this spot very quiet once you start pooping off. This particular
  emplacement was spotted some two months ago by the wily Hun, and he got some
  direct hits on it with small stuff. Since then it hasn't been used. There are
  lots of others, you know."</p>

  <p>"I was ordered to come to this one," answered the boy doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"Right-oh! my dear fellow&mdash;it's your funeral. I thought I'd just let
  you know. Are you letting drive this morning?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;as soon as I get the order to fire."</p>

  <p>The boy was keen as mustard, and, as I have said, very young&mdash; just
  another infant. He had not long to wait, for hardly were the words out of his
  mouth when a sergeant came in.</p>

  <p>"Captain's compliments, sir, and will you fire two rounds at G. 10 C. 5
  4?"</p>

  <p>Rapidly and without confusion the men did their appointed jobs; the great
  stalk slithered down the gun, the bomb&mdash;big as a football&mdash; filled
  with high explosive was fixed with a detonator, the lanyard to fire the
  charge was adjusted. Then every one cleared out of the emplacement, while the
  Sapper took his stand in the trench outside.</p>

  <p>"Let her rip." The lanyard was pulled, and with a muffled crack the huge
  cannon-ball rose into the air, its steel stalk swaying behind it. Plainly
  visible, it reached its highest point, and still wobbling drunkenly went
  swishing down on to G. 10 C. 54&mdash;or thereabouts. A roar and a great
  column of black smoke rose from the German lines.</p>

  <p>Almost before the report had died away, the gun was sponged out, and
  another inebriated monster departed on its mission. But the Sapper was
  already some way up the Haymarket. It was not his first view of a
  trench-mortar firing.</p>

  <p>A vicious crack from a rifle now and then broke the stillness, and
  proclaimed that the sun was clearing away the morning mist, and that rest-
  time was nearly over; while the sudden rattle of a machine gun close by him,
  indulging in a little indirect fire at a well-known Hun gathering place a
  thousand yards or so behind their lines, disturbed a covey of partridges,
  which rose with an angry whirring of wings. Then came four of those
  unmistakable faint muffled bursts from high above his head, which betokened
  an aeroplane's morning gallop; and even as he automatically jerked his head
  skywards, with a swishing noise something buried itself in the earth not far
  away. It is well to remember that even Archibald's offspring obey the laws of
  gravity, and shells from an anti-aircraft gun, burst they never so high,
  descend sooner or later in the shape of jagged fragments&mdash;somewhere. And
  if the somewhere is your face, upturned to see the fun...!</p>

  <p>The Sapper, with the remembrance fresh in his mind of a pal looking up in
  just such a way a week before, quickly presented the top of his tin hat to
  the skies, and all that might descend from them. There had been that same
  swishing all round them as they stood watching some close shooting at one of
  our own planes. He recalled the moment when he cried suddenly&mdash;"Jove!
  they've got him!" He had turned as he spoke to see the officer with him,
  slipping sideways, knees crumpling, body sagging. "Good God! old man, what is
  it?" The question was involuntary, for as he caught the limp figure&mdash;he
  knew.</p>

  <p>The plane was all right: the German shells had not got it; but a piece of
  shrapnel, the size of a match-box, had passed through that officer's eye, and
  entered his brain. He had laid him on the firing-step, and covered his
  head&mdash;or what was left of it....</p>

  <p>He reached Pall Mall, to be once again confronted with a large white
  notice board. To the right were Boyaux 93 and 94&mdash;to the left, 91 and
  90. Straight on to the front, 92 led to the firing line. With his ultimate
  destination Vesuvius crater and the rum jar in view, he turned to the right,
  and walked along the support trench. It was much the same as Piccadilly: only
  being one degree nearer the front, it was one degree more warlike. Boxes of
  bombs everywhere; stands for rifles on the firing-step, which held them
  rigidly when they fired rifle grenades; and every now and then a row of grey-
  painted rockets with a red top, which in case of emergency send up the
  coloured flares that give the S.O.S. signals to those behind. Also men: men
  who slept and ate and shaved and wrote and got bored. A poor show is trench
  warfare!</p>

  <p>"Look out, sir. They've knocked it in just round the corner last night
  with trench mortars." A sergeant of the South Loamshires was speaking.
  "Having a go at Laburnum Cottage, I'm thinking."</p>

  <p>"What, that sniper's post? Have you been using it?"</p>

  <p>"One of our men in there now, sir. He saw an Allemand go to ground in his
  dug-out half an hour ago through the mist, and he reckons he ought to finish
  breakfast soon, and come out again."</p>

  <p>The Sapper crawled on his stomach over the <i>dÚbris</i> that blocked the
  trench, and stopped at the entrance to Laburnum Cottage, officially known as
  Sniper's Post No. 4. In a little recess pushed out to the front of the
  trench, covered in with corrugated iron and surrounded by sandbags, sprawled
  the motionless figure of a Lance-Corporal. With his eye glued to his
  telescopic sight and his finger on the trigger of his rifle, he seemed hardly
  to be breathing. Suddenly he gave a slight grunt, and the next instant, with
  a sharp crack, the rifle fired.</p>

  <p>"Get him?" asked the Sapper.</p>

  <p>"Dunno, sir," answered the sniper, his eye still fixed to the telescope.
  "Three 'undred yards, and 'e ducked like 'ell. It wasn't far off 'is nibs,
  but one can't tell for sure." He got down and stretched himself. "I've waited
  'alf an 'our for the perisher, too, without no breakfast." He grinned and
  scrambled over the broken-down trench to remedy the latter deficiency, while
  once more the Sapper walked on. No need with this particular regiment to
  suggest rebuilding the broken-in trench; it would be done
  automatically&mdash; which cannot be said of them all.</p>

  <p>At last he reached Boyau 94, and turned up towards the firing-line. Twenty
  yards from the turn a mass of barbed wire crossed the trench above his head,
  the barbed wire which ran in front of the support line. For it is not only
  the fire-trench that is wired&mdash;each line behind is plentifully supplied
  with this beautiful vegetable growth.</p>

  <p>The mist had cleared away, and the morning sun was blazing down from a
  cloudless sky, as he reached the front trench. Just to his left a monstrous
  pair of bellows, slowly heaving up and down under the ministrations of two
  pessimistic miners, sent a little of God's fresh air down to the men in the
  mine-shafts underneath. The moles were there&mdash;the moles who scratched
  and scraped stolidly, at the end of their gallery thirty or forty yards in
  front, deep down under the earth in No Man's Land.</p>

  <p>A steady stream of sandbags filled with the result of their labours came
  up the shaft down which the pipe from the bellows stretched into the
  darkness&mdash;sandbags which must be taken somewhere and emptied, or used to
  revet a bit of trench which needed repair.</p>

  <p>To right and left there stretched the fire-trench&mdash;twisting and
  turning, traversed and recessed&mdash;just one small bit of the edge of
  British land. A hundred yards away, a similar line stretched right and left,
  where other pessimistic miners ministered to other monstrous bellows, and
  Piccadilly was known as Unter den Linden. The strange stagnation of it
  all!</p>

  <p>Look through the periscope at the country in front. Not a sign of life in
  the torn-up crusted earth; not a movement between the two long lines of wire.
  A few poppies here and there, and at one point a motionless grey-green lump
  close to the farther wire. Impossible to tell exactly what it is from the
  periscope&mdash;the range is too far. But, in No Man's Land, such strange
  grey&mdash;and khaki&mdash;lumps may often be seen. The night, a wiring
  party, perhaps a little raid or an officer's patrol, and&mdash;discovery. You
  cannot always get your dead back to the trench, and the laws that govern No
  Man's Land savour of the primitive....</p>

  <p>The Sapper watched the phlegmatic bellows-heaver for a few moments
  curiously. His stoical indifference to any one or anything save the job in
  hand, the wonderful accuracy with which he spat from time to time, the
  appalling fumes from his short clay pipe, all tended to make of him an
  interesting study. Supremely apathetic to friend or foe, Generals or Huns, he
  did his shift without comment and, as far as could be seen, without
  thought.</p>

  <p>"Where are you putting the earth?" asked the Sapper after watching for a
  while.</p>

  <p>"Round corner, in a 'ole." The speaker pointed with his pipe, and the
  subject dropped.</p>

  <p>The officer turned away smiling slightly, and decided on the inspection of
  the rum jar. The answer was clear and succinct, even if not couched in the
  language of the old army discipline. He inspected the hole, and, finding it
  was at the back of the trench, in a crater that was formed nightly by German
  <i>minenwerfer</i>, and that more earth there not only would not block the
  trench but, <i>mirabile dicta</i>, would be an actual advantage, he passed on
  and shortly came to a passage leading out of the front of the trench.</p>

  <p>The passage was labelled Sap No. 130, and presented exactly the same
  appearance as the boyaux which ran out of the support line to the front
  trench. Only when one got into it did the difference become apparent, for
  whereas the boyaux had continued until finally opening into a new trench, the
  sap was a cul-de-sac, and finished abruptly in a little covered-in recess
  built into a miniature mountain of newly-thrown-up earth. And this great,
  tumbled mass of soil was the near lip of Vesuvius crater&mdash;blown up half
  way between the two front lines.</p>

  <p>Over the top of the mountain there was no passage. A man standing or
  crawling there in daytime would have been in full view of German snipers at a
  range of forty yards; while had he accomplished it in safety, he would have
  slithered down the farther side into a great cavity shaped like an egg-cup,
  at the bottom of which a pool of dirty, stagnant water was slowly forming.
  Moreover, if we imagine the man continuing his journey and climbing up the
  other side, he would run the gauntlet of the English snipers as he topped the
  farther lip, before reaching the German sap which ran out in just such a
  similar cul-de-sac to the one already described.</p>

  <p>Thus are craters consolidated; each side holds the lip nearest to them,
  and hurls curses and bombs at his opponents on the other. The distance
  between the sapheads is perhaps twenty or twenty-five yards, instead of the
  hundred odd of the parent fire-trenches; and any closer acquaintanceship is
  barred by the egg-cup crater, which stretches between them.</p>

  <p>"Keep down, sir&mdash;well down. Lot of sniping today." A sergeant of the
  South Loamshires whispered hoarsely to the Sapper as he reached the end of
  the sap&mdash;it is etiquette to whisper in a sap. Three men inside the
  recess were drinking tea with the calmness born of long custom, while lying
  on his side, with a periscope to his eye, was Jackson, the subaltern.</p>

  <p>"Anything fresh, Jacko?" muttered the Sapper, crouching down beside
  him.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;I think they're coming closer with their left sap round the
  crater. Their periscope seems to be nearer than it was yesterday."</p>

  <p>"Let's have a look." The two changed position, and the Captain turned the
  periscope gently round until he got the exact direction. Absolute stillness
  brooded over the ground he could see; a few rough strands of wire straggled
  about, and disappeared into the great mound of earth that formed the
  <i>dÚbris</i> of the crater.</p>

  <p>There were the enemies' trenches&mdash;a railway embankment behind them
  with a derelict row of trucks&mdash;a great chimney, gaunt and desolate, with
  the buildings at its foot in ruins. But it was not on these old friends that
  he was concentrating; his target was the bit of ground just in front of him
  that lay close to the thrown-up earth of Vesuvius, along which the German sap
  was reputed to be creeping nearer.</p>

  <p>At last he got what he wanted. Close at hand, perhaps twenty yards away,
  there stuck up out of the ground a motionless stick with something on the
  end&mdash;the German's periscope. Now it is reputed to be a fact by several
  people of apparent truthfulness that it is possible, in circumstances such as
  these, for each watcher to see the other man's eyes reflected from the
  mirrors of the periscopes; and it is an undoubted fact that the laws which
  govern the refraction of light would allow of this phenomenon. Personally, I
  am glad to say I have never seen a German's eye through a periscope; but then
  personally I am inclined to doubt if any one has. It must be quite dreadful
  to see a thing like a poached egg regarding you balefully from the top of a
  stick a few yards away.</p>

  <p>At last the Sapper got up. "He's no nearer, Jacko. What do you think,
  sergeant?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think they were working last night, sir," one of the tea-
  drinkers answered.</p>

  <p>"There was a party of 'em out, and we bunged some bombs. We 'eard 'em
  padding the 'oof back."</p>

  <p>"Been pretty quiet, then?"</p>

  <p>"Except for that there rum jar, sir," answered the sergeant. "We thought
  we was napoo[1] when we 'eard that little bundle of fun a-coming."</p>

  <p>"Have you seen it, Jacko?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, it rolled into the sap, and I've had it put into the fire-trench.
  I'm taking it back to blow it up. I think it's a percussion fuse, but it
  seems fairly safe. I've sent for a stretcher to carry it on."</p>

  <p>"Let's go and have a look at it."</p>

  <p>The two officers walked down the sap and back into the trench, and started
  to investigate with a professional eye the object lying on the fire-step.
  Apparently of steel, and painted a dull grey, it looked harmless
  enough&mdash;but all those little love offerings of the Hun are treated with
  respect. About the size of an ordinary rum jar, with a fuse of sorts in place
  of a neck, it was at the time an unknown brand of abomination, to them at any
  rate.</p>

  <p>"It differs only in appearance, I fear," remarked the Captain, after
  inspecting it gingerly, "from other presents they give us. Its object is
  undoubtedly nefarious. Where do you propose to blow it up?"</p>

  <p>"In that little quarry near the Ritz. Will that do all right?"</p>

  <p>"Most excellently." With a smile he looked at his watch. "Just set your
  watch by mine, Jacko&mdash;and poop it off at 10.5 ak emma. Do you take
  me?"</p>

  <p>The other looked puzzled for a moment; then his face cleared.</p>

  <p>"I'd forgotten for the moment that Centre Battalion Head-quarters was not
  far from the quarry," he grinned. "Sir&mdash;I take you."</p>

  <p>"My dear boy, the day is hot, and the Pumpkin is fat, and the flies are
  glutinous. He doesn't want to see the trenches any more than I do&mdash; and
  one's mission in life is to anticipate the wishes of the great."</p>

  <p>It was just as he finished speaking that from up the line in the direction
  of the Haymarket there came four dull, vicious cracks in succession, and some
  clouds of black smoke drifted slowly over his head.</p>

  <p>"Just about No. 7 T.M. emplacement," he muttered to himself. "I hope to
  heavens..."</p>

  <p>"Put it on the stretcher carefully, boys." His subaltern was speaking to
  the two men who had arrived with a stretcher. "Have you got the slab of gun-
  cotton?"</p>

  <p>"Corporal 'Amick 'as gone to get it at the store, sir. He's a-going to
  meet us at the quarry."</p>

  <p>"Right-ho! Walk march."</p>

  <p>The cavalcade departed, and the Captain resumed his morning walk, while
  his thoughts wandered to the beer which is cold and light yellow. For many
  weary months had he taken a similar constitutional daily; not always in the
  same place, true; but variety is hard to find in the actual trenches
  themselves. It is the country behind that makes the difference.</p>

  <p>Time was when communication trenches existed only in the fertile brain of
  those who were never called upon to use them; but that time has passed long
  since. Time was when the thin, tired breaking line of men who fought the
  Prussian Guard at Ypres in 1914&mdash;and beat them&mdash;had hard work to
  find the fire-trenches, let alone the communication ones; when a daily
  supervision was a nerve-shattering nightly crawl, and dug-outs were shell-
  holes covered with a leaking mackintosh. It was then that men stood for three
  weeks on end in an icy composition of water and slime, and if by chance they
  did get a relief for a night, merely clambered out over the back, and
  squelched wearily over the open ground with bullets pinging past them from
  the Germans a few score yards away.</p>

  <p>But now there are trenches in canal banks where dead things drift slowly
  by, and trenches in railway embankments where the rails are red with rust and
  the sleepers green with rot; there are trenches in the chalk, good and deep,
  which stand well, and trenches in the slush and slime which never stand at
  all; there are trenches where the smell of the long grass comes sweetly on
  the west wind, and trenches where the stench of death comes nauseous on the
  east. And one and all are they damnable, for ever accursed...</p>

  <p>But the country behind&mdash;ah! there's where the difference comes. You
  may have the dead flat of pastoral Flanders, the little woods, the plough,
  the dykes of Ypres and Boesinghe; you may have the slag-heaps and smoking
  chimneys of La BassÚe and Loos; you may have the gently undulating country of
  Albert and the Somme. Each bears the marks of the German beast&mdash;and,
  like their inhabitants, they show those marks differently. Ypres and the
  North, apathetic, seemingly lifeless; the mining districts, grim and dour;
  the rolling plains still, in spite of all, cheerful and smiling. But
  underlying them all&mdash;deep implacable determination, a grand national
  hatred of the Power who has done this thing....</p>

  <p>He turned out of the Old Kent Road into a siding which harboured the dug-
  outs of the Centre Battalion.</p>

  <p>"Is the General here yet, Murdock?" A tall sergeant of the
  regiment&mdash;an old friend of his&mdash;flattened himself against the side
  of the trench to let him pass.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir." The sergeant's face was expressionless, though his eyes
  twinkled. "I think, sir, as 'ow the General is feeling the 'eat. 'E seems
  worried. 'E's been trying to telephone."</p>

  <p>The Sapper, with a suppressed chuckle, went down some steps into a
  spacious dug-out. The darkness made him temporarily blind, so he saluted and
  stood still just inside the doorway.</p>

  <p>"Damn you, don't blow at me! What's that fool blowin' down the thing for?
  I <i>have</i> pressed a button&mdash;confound you!&mdash;and rung the bell
  twice. No&mdash;I didn't ring off; somebody blew at me, and the machine fell
  on the floor."</p>

  <p>"The General is trying to get through to his château." A voice full of
  unholy joy whispered in the Sapper's ear, and that worthy, whose eyes had got
  accustomed to the gloom, recognised the Adjutant.</p>

  <p>"I gathered that something of the sort was occurring," he whispered
  back.</p>

  <p>But the General was at it again. "Who are you&mdash;the R.T.O.? Well, ring
  off. Exchange. Exchange. It is the Divisional General speaking. I want my
  head-quarters. I say, I want my&mdash;oh, don't twitter, and the bally
  thing's singin' now! First it blows and then it sings. Good God! what's
  that?"</p>

  <p>A deafening explosion shook the dug-out, and a shower of earth and stones
  rained down in the trench outside.</p>

  <p>"They're very active this morning, sir," said the Sapper, stepping
  forward. "Lot of rum jars and things coming over."</p>

  <p>"Are you the Sapper officer? Good morning. I wish you'd get this accursed
  instrument to work."</p>

  <p>"There may be a line broken," he remarked tactfully.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;I shall have to go back; I can't hear a word. The thing does
  nothin' but squeak. Now it's purring like a cat. I hate cats. Most annoyin'.
  I wanted to come round the front line this morning."</p>

  <p>"In very good condition, sir; I've just been all round it. Mighty hot up
  there, General&mdash;and swarms of flies."</p>

  <p>"And they're puttin' over some stuff, you say?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir&mdash;quite a lot."</p>

  <p>"Hum! Well, of course, I fully intended to come round&mdash;but, dash it
  all, I must get back. Can't hear a word the fellow says. Does nothing but
  play tunes." The Pumpkin rose and stalked to the door. "Well, I'll come round
  another morning, my boy. I wonder, by Jove! if that last one was meant for
  this head-quarters? Devilish near, you know." He walked up the stairs,
  followed by his staff officer. "Good mornin'&mdash;mind you see about that
  telephone. Cursed thing blows."</p>

  <p>"Dear old Pumpkin," murmured the Adjutant as his steps died away. "He's a
  topper. His figure's against him, but he's got the heart of a lion."</p>

  <p>"He has," answered the Sapper, preparing to follow his footsteps. "And the
  men would do anything for him."</p>

  <p>"What price that rum jar I sent in a bird about?"</p>

  <p>"That was the last explosion you heard," laughed the Sapper. "I wasn't
  leaving anything to chance. I am going to go and drink beer&mdash;iced beer,
  in long glasses. <i>Toujours à toi</i>."</p>

  <p>He was gone, leaving the Adjutant staring. A few moments later he
  clambered out of the trench, and struck out for the crumbling church that
  betokened a road and the near presence of his bicycle.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">A day of peace&mdash;yes, as things go, a day of perfect
  peace. Away down South things were moving; this was stagnation. And
  yet&mdash;well, it was at dinner that night...</p>

  <p>"For the fourteenth night in succession I rise to a point of order." The
  Doctor was speaking. "Why is the lady with the butterfly on her back pushed
  away into one corner, and that horrible woman with the green wig accorded the
  place of honour?"</p>

  <p>I would hurriedly state that the Doctor's remarks were anent two pictures
  which are, I believe, occasionally to be found in officers' messes in the
  B.E.F.&mdash;pictures of a Parisian flavour as befits the Entente&mdash;
  pictures which&mdash;at any rate they are well known to many, and I will not
  specify further.</p>

  <p>"Yes, the lady with the gween wig is dweadful." The boy sipped his
  port.</p>

  <p>"Infant, I'm shocked at you. The depravity of these children
  nowadays..."</p>

  <p>An orderly came into the room with an envelope, which he handed to the
  Captain.</p>

  <p>The C.O. spread out the flimsy paper and frowned slightly as he read the
  message.</p>

  <p>"T.M. Emp. No. 7, completely wrecked by a direct hit 9.30 a.m. this
  morning, A.A.A. Please inspect and report, A.A.A., C.R.E., 140th
  Division."</p>

  <p>"Delayed as usual," grunted the Scotchman. "I was there just after it
  happened, and reported it to the O.C. Trench Mortars. Did you not hear, sir,
  for it's useless repairing it? That position is too well known."</p>

  <p>"Were there any casualties?" The Sapper Captain's voice was quiet.</p>

  <p>"Aye. The poor lad that was crooning over his gun when I saw him this
  morning, like a cat over her undrowned kitten, just disappeared."</p>

  <p>"What d'you mean, Mac?"</p>

  <p>"It was one of the big ones, and it came right through the wire on top of
  him." The gruff voice was soft. "Poor bairn!"</p>

  <h2><a id="chap202"
     name="chap202">II. &mdash; OVER THE TOP</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"On the afternoon of the 21st we gained a small local
  success. Our line was advanced on a front of six hundred yards, over an
  average depth of a quarter of a mile. All the ground gained was successfully
  consolidated. Up to date eighty-six unwounded prisoners have passed through
  the corps cage, of whom three are officers."</p>

  <p>Thus ran the brief official notice so tersely given in the "Intelligence
  Summary," known to the ribald as "Comic Cuts"; later it will appear even more
  tersely in the daily communiquÚ which delights the matutinal kipper and twin
  eggs of England. It's all so simple; it all sounds such a ridiculously easy
  matter to those who read. Map maniacs stab inaccurate maps with pins; a few
  amateur strategists discourse at length, and with incredible ignorance, on
  the bearing it&mdash;and countless other similar operations&mdash; will have
  on the main issue. And the vast majority remark gloomily to the other members
  of the breakfast table that there is nothing in the paper as usual. Nothing,
  my friend! I wonder....</p>

  <p>This is not a story; there is no plot; it is just what happens every day
  somewhere or other in the land of glutinous, stinking mud, where the soles
  are pulled off a man's boots when he walks and horses go in up to their
  bellies; where one steers a precarious and slippery course on the narrow
  necks of earth that separate shell holes, and huddled things stare up at the
  sky with unseeing eyes. They went "over the top" themselves&mdash;ten days
  ago&mdash;in just such another local success. Nothing, my friend! Perhaps
  you're right; it's mainly a sense of proportion that is needed in war, as in
  other things....</p>

  <p>"Good morning, dear old soul." The machine-gun officer emerged from a
  watery hole of doubtful aspect, covered with a dented sheet of corrugated
  iron and a flattened-out biscuit tin&mdash;the hole that is, not the officer.
  "We have slept well, thank you; and the wife and family are flourishing.
  Moreover&mdash;you're late."</p>

  <p>The Sapper regarded him pessimistically through the chilly mist of an
  October dawn. "Entirely owing to my new and expensive waders being plucked
  from my feet with a sucking noise. A section of haggard men are now engaged
  in salvage operations. Shall we process?"</p>

  <p>"We shall&mdash;in one sweet moment, not before. Sweet, brave heart,
  because&mdash;" He put his head round the corner. "Jones&mdash;the raspberry
  wine&mdash;<i>toute suite</i>. Just a hollow tooth full, and we will gambol
  like young lambs the whole long weary way."</p>

  <p>"It is well," remarked the Sapper, returning the empty mug to the soldier
  servant. "Personally I like it burnt at night, with a noggin of port. You put
  it in a mug, add three spoonfuls of sugar, set light to it, and let it burn
  for seven minutes. Then add some port, and drink hot. Man, you can lead an
  army corps..." His voice died away as the two officers departed on their
  three-mile squelch to the front line, and the unshaven Jones gazed after them
  admiringly.</p>

  <p>"A hartist!" he murmured admiringly, "a plurry hartist. Personally, the
  rasberry juice, any old 'ow for me." He disappeared from view, and further
  disclosures would be tactless....</p>

  <p>And so we lift the curtain on the dawn of the 21st. Doubtless the setting
  is frivolous, but it has served to introduce two of the supers who go to make
  up the final scene. In the portion of the front line for which they were
  bound there lay the battalion which was cast for the principal part, and it
  is the prerogative of stars to have their entrance led up to....</p>

  <p>The mist hung thick over the shell-torn ground as the two officers walked
  on. In places stretches of half-demolished wire and blown-in trenches showed
  where the Germans had put up a fight. Stray graves, ours and theirs, were
  dotted about promiscuously, and little heaps of dirty and caked equipment
  showed that salvage work was in progress. Away to the left a few crumbling
  walls and shattered trees marked a one-time prosperous agricultural village,
  from which with great regularity there came the sighing drone of a German
  crump followed by a column of black smoke and a shower of bricks and
  <i>dÚbris</i>. But the place was dead; its inhabitants gone&mdash;God knows
  where. And soldiers: well, soldiers have a rooted dislike to dead villages
  near the trenches.</p>

  <p>A strange squat object loomed suddenly into sight&mdash;a well-known
  landmark to those who wandered daily behind the lines. Derelict, motionless,
  it lay on a sunken road, completely blocking it; and the sunken road was
  heavy with the stench of death. It is not good for the Hun to take liberties
  with a tank, even if it is temporarily <i>hors-de-combat</i>.</p>

  <p>A man limping wearily, his head bandaged, his face unshaved, his khaki
  coated with half-dry mud, plodded heavily towards them.</p>

  <p>"Can you tell me the way to the dressing-station, sir?" He had stopped
  and, swaying slightly, stood in front of the two officers.</p>

  <p>"Straight on, lad. You'll find it somewhere back there." The machine-gun
  officer pointed vaguely into the mist. "About half a mile."</p>

  <p>"You ain't got a drop of water, 'ave you, sir? The water party got lost
  last night, and we've only had about a teacupful this last twenty-four
  hours."</p>

  <p>But when going up to visit the trenches water-bottles are a useless
  encumbrance, and, with a tired sigh, the wounded Tommy resumed his thirsty
  way in the direction of the dressing-station.</p>

  <p>"Cooked, poor devil," remarked the Sapper, as he disappeared. "Pretty
  nearly finished."</p>

  <p>"But he'll be his mother's own bright boy again when he gets his nose
  inside that aid post. We go left here, I think."</p>

  <p>They paused for a moment to get their bearings&mdash;a matter of some
  importance and no little difficulty.</p>

  <p>It may seem an easy thing to walk up to the trenches. One goes on, and
  ultimately one arrives, the casual reader will surmise. And with luck the
  casual reader will be right. But there are certain small points which may
  have escaped his ken and which render the task of reaching the front line a
  trifle harder than walking to the club for lunch.</p>

  <p>In the first place the aspect of the ground is not of that cheerful and
  varied type which has inspired so many gifted landscape painters. No trees
  and little rivers, no cottages and flowering paths delight one's eye. It is
  impossible to say: "Take the turn to the left after passing the cactus bush,
  and keep straight on till you come to the asparagus bed; and then you'll see
  the front trench on your right."</p>

  <p>The local cactus bush or its equivalent is hurled into space twice daily,
  thereby largely interfering with its use as a landmark. The local asparagus
  bed or its equivalent differs only from the remainder of the ground in the
  fact that a mule passed peacefully away on it some weeks previously. And one
  day even that difference vanished. The mule passed away again&mdash;in small
  fragments.</p>

  <p>Even the front trenches where they exist have a variegated career. At
  certain periods quite a large proportion of them are in the air at the same
  time, in company with the village just behind; and when they come down again
  it is more than likely their position will change to the next row of damp and
  unpleasant holes.</p>

  <p>That is the trouble: the whole ground is one huge hole. Holes are the only
  features of the landscape: big holes, little holes, damp ones, smelly ones;
  holes occupied and holes to let; holes you fall into and holes you
  don't&mdash;but, holes. Everywhere holes. The cactus bush is a hole; the
  asparagus bed is a hole; the trenches are holes. The whole country looks like
  a disease. A large amount of the wandering must perforce be done at night;
  and should the casual reader still doubt the difficulty of finding one's way,
  let him imagine three voluntary descents, and as many compulsory ones, into
  the wet brand of hole; let him further imagine a steady downpour of rain, no
  sign of a star, and a shrewd suspicion that if he's walked as far as he
  thinks he has in the right direction he ought to be in the front line; and
  then let him imagine&mdash;holes. Whenever he moves he either negotiates or
  fails to negotiate&mdash; holes. Having, in scrambling out of holes turned
  round twice he doesn't know which way he's facing; he only knows there
  are&mdash;holes. Toc&mdash; toc&mdash;toc; the slow tapping of a German
  machine-gun sounds from the direction he had fondly imagined Battalion
  Head-quarters to be; the swish of bullets come nearer as the Hun sweeps the
  ground; a flare goes up, showing&mdash; holes. Another compulsory descent; a
  phut! as a bullet passes over his head, and the swishing passes on. Shortly
  that swishing will come back, and in the meantime are there not&mdash;holes?
  But as for the front trench, whither he is bound, the contest is unequal. No
  man can fight&mdash;holes.</p>

  <p>A further point which is worthy of remark <i>en passant</i> may possibly
  escape the notice of the uninitiated. It is a well-known fact, and will be
  vouched for by all who have experienced the Somme, that that part of the
  ground which is not hole is carried, like the unexpended portion of the day's
  rations, on the person. Acres of soil have been removed from their original
  abode and have been carried laboriously to other acres. They have then been
  brought back again; not by boot only, but by hand, and face, by hair and
  teeth. It is reported&mdash;though I will not vouch for the accuracy of the
  statement&mdash;that on one occasion a relieving battalion completely
  defeated a small German counter-attack by standing on the parapet and kicking
  viciously towards the advancing Huns. The enormous mass of soil thus
  propelled not only crushed the hated foe but effectually buried him. However,
  that is by the way. We are digressing far from the Sapper and the machine-gun
  officer who stood by a derelict tank in the damp mist of an October dawn and
  cogitated on the direction of their particular piece of front line.</p>

  <p>"It is amazing," said a voice behind them, "that man can have descended to
  such a state of congenital idiocy as to do all this to an inoffensive carrot
  field."</p>

  <p>The Brigade-Major, followed by the Brigadier, joined the two officers.
  Behind them the signal officer plucked France from his face. And then of a
  sudden five officers disappeared. A droning roar rose with extreme rapidity
  to that pitch of loudness that denotes undesirable closeness; a mass of black
  fumes and flying mud shot up twenty odd yards away; a flight of cockchafers
  seemed to pass into the distance as the jagged fragments whizzed
  overhead&mdash;and five faces appeared as suddenly from the ground. Holes
  have their uses at times.</p>

  <p>"This sunken road is always hairy," remarked the signal
  officer&mdash;known to his intimates as Sigs&mdash;giving the General a
  hand-up from his particular lair. "It were unwise to linger, sir."</p>

  <p>"Another quarter-mile and we hit Essex Trench," remarked the Brigade-
  Major. "Sally's head-quarters are there." The five officers passed on,
  squelching loudly, and once again peace and silence reigned in the sunken
  road....</p>

  <p>And now we come to the principal actors in the drama. Crowded in Essex
  Trench, damp with mist, were the men of the South Loamshires. A few were
  scribbling notes, and an all-pervading smell of frying bacon permeated the
  air. One or two, wrapped in great-coats, with a mackintosh sheet over them,
  still slept peacefully&mdash;but the whole regiment was stirring into life.
  The morning of the day had come. To many it was a new experience; to others
  it was stale&mdash;going over the top. But, new or old, not a man but
  realised that by evening the roll of the regiment would have many gaps; new
  or old, not a man but realised that his name might be one of those gaps. Just
  the luck of the game; perhaps nothing, perhaps a Blighty, perhaps...</p>

  <p>It is well without doubt that the lower the intelligence the less the
  imagination. To ninety per cent. of these men the situation lost much of its
  edge; to the remaining ten the edge was sharpened. What is to be is to be, in
  war as elsewhere. Fatalism as regards one's own prospects is inevitable;
  essential. But fatalism is an unsatisfying creed; the word "Why?" is apt to
  creep into the back of a man's mind, and the word "Why?" when the
  intelligence is low, is a dangerous one. For the word "Why?" can only be
  satisfactorily answered by the realisation of the bigness of the issue; by
  the knowledge that individual effort is imperative if collective success is
  to be obtained; by the absolute conviction that no man can be a law unto
  himself. To the ten per cent. these facts were clear; but then, to the ten
  per cent. the "Why?" was louder. The factor of their composition which said
  to them "Why?"&mdash;clearly and insistently&mdash;even as they lay
  motionless under their coats or outwardly wrangled for bacon and
  tea&mdash;that very factor supplied the answer.</p>

  <p>To the thinkers and dreamers there comes at such times the greater
  knowledge: the knowledge which lifts them above self and the trivialities of
  their own lives; the knowledge that is almost Divine. They appreciate the
  futility&mdash;but they realise the necessity. And in their hearts they laugh
  sardonically as the shadow of Dream's End clouds the sky. The utter futility
  of it all&mdash;the utter necessity now that futility has caught the world.
  Then they realise the bacon is cold&mdash;and curse.</p>

  <p>To the ninety per cent. it is not so. Not theirs to reason so acutely, not
  theirs to care so much; to them the two dominant features of this
  war&mdash;death and boredom&mdash;appeal with far less force. For both depend
  so utterly on imagination in their effect on the individual. Death is only
  awful in anticipation; boredom only an affliction to the keen-witted. So to
  the ninety, perhaps, the "Why?" does not sound insistently. It is as well,
  for if the answer is not forthcoming there is danger, as I have said. And one
  wonders sometimes which class produces the best results for the business in
  hand&mdash;the business of slaughtering Huns.... The small one that rises to
  great heights and sinks to great depths, or the big one, the plodders.</p>

  <p>But I have digressed again. It is easy to wander into by-paths when the
  main road is prosaic, and the study of a body of men before an
  attack&mdash;the men who fear and don't show it, the men who fear and try not
  to show it, the men who don't care a hang what happens&mdash;cannot but grip
  the observer who has eyes to see. Almost does he forget his own allotted part
  in the drama; the psychology of the thing is too absorbing. And it can only
  be realised when seen first hand.</p>

  <p>Let us leave them there for the time&mdash;that battalion of the South
  Loamshires. Sally&mdash;as the C.O. is generally known&mdash;has talked with
  the Brigadier and the Brigade-Major. He knows that zero hour is 11.30 a.m.;
  he knows his objective&mdash;Suffolk Trench; he knows the strong point at its
  northern end which the sappers are going to consolidate. The Sapper has found
  his section subaltern and his section nursing coils of barbed wire and
  shovels, and has been informed with much blasphemy that the guide had lost
  his way, and the party had been wandering all night. The machine-gun officer
  has delivered words of wisdom to various guns' crews&mdash;both Lewis and
  otherwise&mdash;who came under his eagle eye at intervals along the trench.
  Just the prosaic main road; the details are tedious; the actual orders
  uninteresting. The attack would either succeed or it would fail; the strong
  point would either be consolidated or it would not. The orders&mdash;the
  details&mdash;are necessary adjuncts to the operation; of no more interest
  than the arrangements for pulling up the fire curtain. Only if the fire
  curtain sticks, the play is robbed of much of its natural charm to the
  onlooker.</p>

  <p>"Bring me some more breakfast. That walk gives one the devil of a hunger."
  The Brigadier was back once more in his dug-out, while, outside, the mist had
  lifted and the autumn sun shone down on a world of mud.</p>

  <p>The Brigade-Major was shaving; the Staff Captain&mdash;a non-starter in
  the morning's walk&mdash;was demanding corrugated iron from the unmoved
  Sapper.</p>

  <p>"I tell you this roof is a disgrace. Cascades of water pour through into
  the soup at dinner. Why don't you do something?"</p>

  <p>"What do you propose I should do, brave heart? Sit on the roof and catch
  it?"</p>

  <p>The subject was a complicated one, touching deep problems of supply and
  demand, to say nothing of carrying parties; so let us leave them to their
  warfare.</p>

  <p>The signal officer was looking wise over something that boomed and buzzed
  alternately; the machine-gun officer may, or may not, have been enjoying
  another toothful.</p>

  <p>In short, the supers, the stage-managers had departed. The last directions
  had been given, and the play was due to start in an hour and a quarter. All
  that could be done for its success had been done by those who were behind;
  now it was up to the men who sat and sprawled in the mud-holes in front, with
  the blue smoke of their cigarettes curling upwards and their equipment and
  rifles stacked beside them.</p>

  <p>A desultory bombardment on each side droned stolidly on, while away to the
  front three British aeroplanes, seemingly come from nowhere, tumbled and
  looped round two Germans like mosquitoes over a pool. A row of sausage
  balloons like a barber's rash adorned the sky as far as the eye could see.
  Just an everyday scene on the Somme, and meanwhile the actors waited.</p>

  <p>"Come up to the top. There's ten minutes to go." The Staff Captain and the
  Sapper&mdash;their dispute settled&mdash;strolled amicably to the top of the
  hill behind the dug-out and produced their field-glasses. Away in front Essex
  Trench could be seen, and the men inside it, standing to. For them the period
  of suspense was nearly over&mdash;the curtain was just going up.</p>

  <p>"One minute." The Sapper snapped his watch to and focussed his glasses.
  "They're on."</p>

  <p>Suddenly from all around, as if touched by a spring, an ear-splitting din
  leaped into life. In the valley behind them it seemed as if hundreds of
  tongues of flame were darting and quivering, sprouting from what a moment
  before was barren ground. The acrid smell of cordite drifted over them, while
  without cessation there came the solemn boom&mdash;boom&mdash;boom of the
  heavier guns way back. Like the <i>motif</i> of an opera, the field-guns and
  light howitzers cracked and snorted, permeating everything with one
  continuous blast of sound; while the sonorous roar and rumble of the giant
  pieces behind&mdash;slower, as befitted them&mdash;completed the mighty
  orchestra. Neither man could hear the other speak; but then, they were both
  watching too intently for that.</p>

  <p>Hardly had hell been let loose when a line of men arose from Essex Trench
  and walked steadily to their front. Just ahead of them great clouds of smoke
  rose belching from the ground: clouds into which they vanished at times, only
  to reappear a moment later. They were advancing behind a creeping barrage,
  and advancing with the steadiness of automatic machines.</p>

  <p>"Good lads! Good lads!" The Staff Captain's lips framed the words; his
  voice was inaudible.</p>

  <p>Every now and then a man pitched forward and lay still; or muttered a
  curse as he felt the sting of something in his arm. A section on the left
  dropped suddenly, only to worm on again by ones and twos, trying to avoid the
  dreaded toc-toc&mdash;slow and menacing&mdash;of a German machine-gun. Then
  the bombers were there. Crouching back, a man would pull the pin out of his
  bomb, run forward, and hurl it into the trench where the Germans were huddled
  in groups. And away behind the South Loamshires, on the shell-pocked ground
  that now boiled and heaved like some monstrous sulphur spring, with thick
  black and yellow fumes drifting slowly across it, there lay the first fruits
  of the harvest: a few of the gaps in the evening's roll-call.</p>

  <p>On the flank a machine-gun was going, taking them in enfilade. In front,
  Germans&mdash;numbers of Germans&mdash;glared snarling at them out of the
  trench, or whimpered in a corner with arms upraised, as was the nature of the
  beasts. A non-commissioned officer picked up a bomb and hurled it at the
  advancing platoon sergeant; only to cry "<i>Kamerad</i>" when it failed to
  explode....</p>

  <p>And so the South Loamshires, or such as were left of them, came to their
  objective; the first part of the play was over. The machine-gunner who had
  enfiladed them passed in his checks, fighting to the end, brained with the
  butt of a rifle.</p>

  <p>Occasionally a wounded man crawled into the trench; a German officer sat
  sullenly in a corner stanching a gaping hole in his leg. Behind them, towards
  the Essex Trench, the air was now clearer; the bombardment had moved over the
  line they had won, and thundered down on the German communications.</p>

  <p>"Runner!" A Company Commander stood shakily trying to patch up a wound in
  his arm. As far as he could tell from a hasty reconnaissance, he was the
  senior officer present. "Give this to the C.O.: 'Objectives won. Situation on
  right doubtful. Estimated casualties two hundred.'" He handed the man a slip
  of paper.</p>

  <p>At a steady lope the runner went over the back of the trench, into the
  barrage of German shrapnel and high explosive. They saw him reach it, stop
  suddenly, twist round, and slither slowly forward.</p>

  <p>"Runner down, sir." A sergeant standing by spoke almost casually.</p>

  <p>"Runner!" Once again the officer called; once again a man went off at a
  jog-trot. They saw him reach his predecessor; stop a moment and bend down. He
  looked round and shook his head and went steadily on. The luck of the
  game&mdash;that's all. And it's only when one's sitting still&mdash;waiting,
  that one asks "Why?" Ten minutes later he was with the C.O., waiting for the
  answer to take back.</p>

  <p>And so the drama is over; the play has been a success. From the wings the
  Staff Captain and the Sapper have returned to Brigade Head-quarters.</p>

  <p>"Saw 'em getting over the top, sir. Then they got into the smoke and we
  lost 'em. Like a witches' cauldron."</p>

  <p>"We shan't hear anything for two hours." The General thoughtfully knocked
  the ashes out of his pipe. They were his men who had gone into that witches'
  cauldron; with them daily he lived and daily died. Their Dream's End was his
  too. But&mdash;a sense of proportion, always. "We might as well have lunch,"
  he remarked casually.</p>

  <p>Gradually the bombardment died away, though from time to time the guns
  burst into sullen mutterings, as though hungry at being baulked of their
  food.</p>

  <p>The same old aeroplanes&mdash;or different ones&mdash;buzzed busily about;
  the same old stoical balloons looked more rash-like than ever.</p>

  <p>And then suddenly outside the brigade office there was a stir.</p>

  <p>A runner had hove in sight, and the signal officer emerged to get his
  tidings.</p>

  <p>"Good," he muttered to himself; "the old man will be pleased." He went
  into the General's dug-out.</p>

  <p>"Message just through, sir, from C.O. South Loamshires: 'Objectives
  obtained. A.A.A. Situation on right somewhere obscure. A.A.A. Estimated
  casualties 200 all ranks. A.A.A. Will be consolidated tonight. A.A.A.'"</p>

  <p>The "old man" <i>was</i> pleased.</p>

  <p>And so, on the afternoon of the 21st, we gained a small local success. We
  advanced our line on a front of six hundred yards over an average depth of a
  quarter of a mile, etc., etc.</p>

  <p>It wasn't much, my friends at home; but&mdash;that runner will run no
  more, and some eighty odd of that odd two hundred have cooked their last
  ration of bacon. Their "Why?" is answered.</p>

  <p>No, it wasn't much; but it wasn't&mdash;nothing.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap203"
     name="chap203">III. &mdash; THE MAN-TRAP</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Should you, in the course of your wanderings, ever run
  across Brigadier-General Herbert Firebrace, do not ask him if he knows Percy
  FitzPercy. The warning is probably quite unnecessary: not knowing FitzP.
  yourself, the question is hardly likely to occur to you. But I mention it in
  case. One never knows, and Herbert will not be prejudiced in your favour if
  you do.</p>

  <p>As far as I know, the story of their first&mdash;and last&mdash; meeting
  has never yet been told to the world at large. It is a harrowing tale, and it
  found no place in official <i>communiquÚs</i>. Just one of those regrettable
  incidents that fade into the limbo of forgotten things, it served as a topic
  of conversation to certain ribald subalterns, and then it gradually
  disappeared into obscurity along with Percy FitzPercy. Only it took several
  months for the topic to fade; Percy beat it in about ten seconds.</p>

  <p>Before the war Percy had been, amongst other things, an actor of
  indifferent calibre; he had helped a barman in Canada, carried a chain for a
  railroad survey, done a bit of rubber-planting, and written poetry. He was,
  in fact, a man of many parts, and cultivated a frivolous demeanour and an
  eyeglass. Unkind acquaintances described him as the most monumental ass that
  has yet been produced by a painstaking world; personally, I think the picture
  a trifle harsh. Percy meant well; and it wasn't really his fault that the
  events I am about to chronicle ended so disastrously. Unfortunately, however,
  he was unable to get the General to see eye to eye with him in this trifling
  matter; and so, as I have already said, Percy beat it in about ten
  seconds.</p>

  <p>The whole trouble started over the question of man-traps. "If," remarked a
  Sapper subaltern one night after the port had been round more than
  once&mdash;"If one could construct a large conical hole like an inverted
  funnel in the front-line trench, so that the small opening was in the trench
  itself, and the bottom of the funnel fifteen or twenty feet below in the
  ground, and if the Huns came over and raided us one night, one might catch
  one or two." He dreamily emptied and refilled his glass.</p>

  <p>"By Jove, dear old boy"&mdash;Percy fixed his eye-glass and gazed
  admiringly at the speaker&mdash;"that's a splendid idea! Sort of glorified
  man-trap&mdash;what!&mdash;dear old thing."</p>

  <p>"That's it, Percy, old lad. Why don't you make one next time you're in the
  trenches?" The speaker winked at the remainder of the party.</p>

  <p>"'Pon my soul, dear old man, I think I will." Percy was clearly struck
  with the idea. "Cover the hole, don't you know, with trench-boards by day,
  and have it open at night. Great idea, old sport, great idea!"</p>

  <p>"You could go and fish for them in the morning with a sausage on the end
  of a string," murmured some one. "Get 'em to sing the 'Hymn of Hate' before
  they got any breakfast."</p>

  <p>"Or even place large spikes at the bottom on which they would fall and
  become impaled." The first speaker was becoming bloodthirsty.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, dear old chap! I don't think an impaled Hun would look very nice.
  It would be quite horrible in the morning, when one started to count up the
  bag, to find them all impaled. Besides, there might be two on one stake."
  Exactly the objection to the last contingency was not clear; but after dinner
  attention to such trifles is of secondary importance.</p>

  <p>"Percy inaugurates new form of frightfulness," laughed the Major. "May I
  be there when you catch your first!"</p>

  <p>The conversation dropped; other and more intimate topics anent the fair
  ones at home took its place; but in the mind of Percy FitzPercy the germ of
  invention was sown. When he went back to his battalion that night, in their
  so-called rest-billets, he was thinking. Which was always a perilous
  proceeding for Percy.</p>

  <p>Now it so happened that his part of the line at the moment had originally
  belonged to the Hun. It was a confused bit of trench, in which miners carried
  on extensively their reprehensible trade. And where there are miners there is
  also spoil. Spoil, for the benefit of the uninitiated, is the technical name
  given to the material they remove from the centre of the earth during the
  process of driving their galleries. It is brought up to the surface in
  sandbags, and is then carried away and dumped somewhere out of harm's way. In
  reality it is generally stacked carefully in the trenches themselves, thereby
  completely blocking all traffic; which is by the way.</p>

  <p>But after mining has been in progress for some time, and various craters
  have been blown and sapped out to, and after trench mortars have "strafed"
  consistently for many months and torn the original surface of the ground to
  pieces, the actual position of the trenches themselves becomes haphazard.
  They cease in many cases to bear the slightest likeness to the ordinary
  trenches of commerce; they become deep gorges in mountains of sandbags. I
  have sometimes wished that those officers who apparently write home to
  devoted bands of female workers asking for more sandbags would get in touch
  with me instead. I shall be delighted to let them have anything up to five
  million, all filled, by return; which is again by the way.</p>

  <p>To return to Percy. In his part of the front sandbags grew like pebbles on
  a shingly beach; and from time to time fresh cuts off the trenches were
  opened to allow for further expansion in the sandbag family. The existing
  front line in one place had started life as a cut off the old trench, and had
  gradually been taken into use as a permanency, and it was at this point that
  he stumbled on the great discovery which was destined to cause all the
  trouble. How he first stumbled is not recorded; but early one morning Percy
  FitzPercy could have been seen like a terrier with his nose down a
  rabbit-hole, lying flat at the bottom of the trench, peering into a noisome
  and foul-smelling cavity underneath him.</p>

  <p>"My dear old boy," he remarked, enthusiastically, to a brother subaltern,
  who was watching the proceeding coldly, "it's an old German dug-out; I'm
  certain it's an old German dug-out."</p>

  <p>"I don't care a damn if it is," answered the other, without enthusiasm.
  "It stinks like a polecat, and is undoubtedly full of all creeping things.
  For heaven's sake, let's go and get something to eat."</p>

  <p>Slowly and reluctantly Percy allowed himself to be led away, thinking
  deeply. Only the week before had the Hun attempted a raid and actually
  entered the trench close to the spot in question, and here was apparently a
  ready-made man-trap should he do so again. After breakfast he would explore
  his find; after breakfast he would himself set to work and labour
  unceasingly. As I have said, Percy FitzPercy meant well.</p>

  <p>It is possible that lesser men might have been deterred by the unpromising
  results of that exploration. Descending gingerly through the hole, which had
  been widened sufficiently to allow of the passage, Percy switched his torch
  around the cavity he found himself in. Above his head long rounded timbers,
  side by side and touching one another, formed the roof, which was in good
  condition, save in the centre, where the blue sky shone through the hole he
  had entered by. In one corner stood a bedstead covered by a moth-eaten
  blanket, while all over the floor crumbling sandbags and old clothes and
  equipment gave it the appearance of a rag-and-bone shop. In one place the
  wall had fallen in, a mound of chalk filled the corner, and from a score of
  vantage points elderly rodents watched with increasing disfavour this
  unexpected human invasion.</p>

  <p>Up above in the trench the disfavour was repeated in that picturesque
  phraseology for which Thomas is famous.</p>

  <p>"Wot are you a-doing 'ere?" An incensed sergeant rounded a corner, and
  gazed wrathfully at three privates, each armed with a spade and wearing gas
  helmets. "Wot 'ave you got them 'elmets on for?" He approached the fatal
  hole, and recoiled slightly. "Gaw-lumme! Wot's that smell?"</p>

  <p>"Percy," answered a sepulchral voice. "Our little Perce."</p>

  <p>"Wot yer mean&mdash;Percy? Wot's that 'ole?" A cloud of dust at that
  moment rose through it, and he recoiled still farther. "Oo's down there?"</p>

  <p>"Percy," answered the same sepulchral voice. "Percy FitzP. carrying hout a
  reconaysance in force. 'E's found a 'Un smell factory, and 'e's fair
  wallowing in it."</p>

  <p>At that moment a voice came gently through the opening. "I say, you
  fellahs, just come down here a moment, and bring your shovels&mdash;
  what?"</p>

  <p>A face, covered with a fine coating of blackish-grey dust, popped up out
  of the bottom of the trench. "We're fairly going to catch the old Hun before
  we've finished."</p>

  <p>With a choking gasp the sergeant lost all self-control and faded rapidly
  away, while the three privates slowly and reluctantly followed the face
  through the hole.</p>

  <p>It was fortunate&mdash;or possibly, in view of future events,
  unfortunate&mdash;that during the next two hours no responsible individual
  came along that particular piece of front line. Incidentally there was
  nothing surprising in the fact. In most places, especially during the day,
  the front line is held but lightly by isolated posts, which are visited from
  time to time by the company or platoon commander, and more rarely by the
  Colonel. On this particular occasion the C.O. had already paid his visit to
  the scene of activity. The company commander was wrestling with returns, and
  Percy himself led the long-suffering platoon. And so without hindrance from
  any outsiders the fell business proceeded.</p>

  <p>Volumes of evil-smelling dust poured out into the trench, punctuated from
  time to time with boots, a few rats who had met with an untimely end, some
  unrecognisable garments, and large numbers of empty bottles. An early
  investigation had shown the indomitable leader that the old shaft which had
  led down to the dug-out in the days when it was used was completely blocked
  up, and so the hole through the roof was the only means of entrance or exit.
  Moreover, the hole being in the centre of the roof, and the dug-out being a
  high one, there was no method of reaching it other than by standing on the
  bed or the decomposing chair. Once the bird was in there, granted the bed had
  been removed, there was therefore no way by which he could get out without
  being helped from above. And so with joy in his heart the indefatigable Percy
  laboured on, what time three sweating privates consigned him to the uttermost
  depths of the pit.</p>

  <p>Now one may say at once that Percy had all the makings in him of the true
  artist. Having decided to stage his performance, he had no intention of
  letting it fail through lack of attention to detail. Life in the front
  trenches is not at any time an enlivening proceeding; the days drag wearily
  by, the nights are full of noises and Verey lights&mdash;and this particular
  part of the line was no exception to the general rule. So our hero was not
  distracted by mundane influences or stress of work from elaborating his
  scheme. In addition, once the miasma had subsided, and the idea had been
  explained to them, the three supers became quite keen themselves. It was one
  of them, in fact, who suggested the first detail.</p>

  <p>"'Ow are we to know, sir," he remarked, as they sat resting on an adjacent
  fire-step after three hours' strenuous exhuming, "that supposing two of the
  perishers fall through the 'ole they won't escape? Two men could get out of
  that there place without no bed to 'elp 'em."</p>

  <p>"By Jove, yes!" Percy scratched his forehead and left furrows of white in
  the general darkness. "By Jove, yes; you're quite right&mdash;what? Break
  one's heart to lose the blighters, don't you know. You're a doocid clever
  fellow to think of that, Jenkins."</p>

  <p>"Tomkins, sir," murmured the originator of the brain-wave, slightly
  abashed by the unexpected praise.</p>

  <p>"We might," remarked another of the world's workers, thoughtfully sucking
  his teeth&mdash;"we might 'ave a trap-door, a 'eavy one, to let down over the
  'ole once they was in."</p>

  <p>"Yus&mdash;and 'ow are we to know when they is in?" The third member of
  the party proceeded to justify his existence. "They won't come over 'ere and
  fall into the 'ole and then shout to us to let down the trap." He
  thoughtfully lit a Woodbine. "The 'Un will be strafing if there's a raid on,
  and there'll be the 'ell of a beano going on, and no one won't never 'ear
  nothing."</p>

  <p>With which sage aphorism he relapsed into silence, and a gloom settled on
  the meeting.</p>

  <p>"By Jove, you fellows, we must think of something! We must pull up our
  socks and think&mdash;what? After we've spent all this time clearing the
  bally place out we must really think of something&mdash;by Jove!" Percy gazed
  hopefully at his three supers, but it seemed that their contributions to the
  conversation were at an end, and for a space silence reigned, broken only by
  the gentle lullaby of the tooth-sucker.</p>

  <p>"We might," remarked Tomkins at length, after a period of profound
  thought, "'ave a trip-wire, wot would ring a gong."</p>

  <p>"That's it&mdash;that's it! 'Pon my word, you're a doocid clever fellow,
  Thomson, doocid clever fellow&mdash;what?" Percy became enthusiastic. "Ring
  the gong where the fellah is who lets down the door. He lets down the door,
  and we bag the Hun. Dam good idea!"</p>

  <p>"I don't believe in no gongs," remarked the musical one scornfully.
  "No&mdash;nor trip-wires neither." He eyed his audience pugnaciously.</p>

  <p>"But, my good fellah&mdash;er&mdash;what do you believe in?" Percy's
  spirits were sinking.</p>

  <p>"Tins, china, cups and saucers, plates, old saucepans&mdash;anything and
  everything wot will make a noise when the 'Un falls on it. That's the ticket,
  sir," he continued, with gathering emphasis as he noted the impression he was
  causing. "Lumme&mdash;a trip-wire: it might break, or the gong mightn't ring,
  or the blighter mightn't 'ear it. Wiv china&mdash;every step he took 'e'd
  smash anuvver pot. Drahn a rum jar 'e would. But&mdash;a trip-wire!" He spat
  impartially and resumed his tune.</p>

  <p>"By Jove, that's a splendid idea!" The mercurial Percy's face shone again.
  "Splendid idea! Fill it full of old tins and china&mdash;what? And when we
  hear the second fellah hit the floor and start breakin' up the home we can
  pull the string and let down the trap-door. Splendid idea! Doocid clever of
  you, 'pon my soul it is!"</p>

  <p>"And where do you think of getting the china from?" Tomkins, fearing that
  his mantle of doocid cleverness was descending upon the tooth-sucker, eyed
  him unconvinced. "I wasn't aware as 'ow there was a penny bazaar in the
  neighbourhood, nor yet a William Whiteley's."</p>

  <p>"Yes, by Jove," chirped Percy, "where do we get it all from? We shall want
  lots of it, too, don't you know&mdash;what?"</p>

  <p>"Get it?" The suggester of the idea looked scornful and addressed himself
  to Tomkins. "There ain't no bully tins in the perishing trenches, are there?
  Ho no! An' there hain't no china an' bits of glass and old cups and things in
  that there village about 'alf a mile down the road? Ho no! I reckon there's
  enough to fill twenty 'oles like that there." Once again the oracle resumed
  his hobby.</p>

  <p>"Splendid!" Percy jumped to his feet. "The very thing! We'll do it this
  next company relief, by Jove! Now, boys, two more hours. We just want to get
  the bedstead out and straighten things up, and we'll be all ready for the
  dinner-service&mdash;what?"</p>

  <p>Now there was another thing in which Percy FitzPercy showed that he had
  the makings of a true artist. He fully appreciated the value of secrecy in
  presenting his performances to the public at large. True, all his platoon
  were bound to find out, and the remainder of the company had a shrewd idea
  that something was afoot. But one does not walk along trenches&mdash;
  especially in the front line&mdash;for pleasure; and beyond a casual inquiry
  as to what new form of insanity he was up to now, the company commander was
  not interested in Percy's doings. Now that the place had been cleared out,
  the opening was covered during the day by a trench-board carefully stolen
  from the nearest R.E. dump; while the members of the platoon assiduously
  collected old tin and china utensils, both great and small, which were thrown
  into the cavity and arranged tastefully by the stage-manager.</p>

  <p>At night the trench-board was removed, and after careful weighting with
  two dud shells, a piece of rail, and the stalk of a sixty-pound trench-
  mortar bomb, it was placed on edge beside the hole. It was so arranged that
  it leaned slightly inwards, and was only kept from falling by a cord which
  passed in front of it and which was attached to two screw pickets&mdash;one
  on each side. The hole itself was covered with a sack. So much for the
  scenery.</p>

  <p>The stage directions were equally simple. The curtain rises on a German
  raid. Noises off, etc.; the flashes of guns, the bursting of rum jars, the
  dazzling brilliance of flares lighting up the lowering night. On the entrance
  of the Hun into the trench (if he did), a watch would be kept on the hole (if
  any one was there to watch). On the sound of the first crash of breaking
  china, no action. On the sound of the second crash of breaking china, Percy
  himself (if alive) or a substitute (if not), would dash forward and cut the
  string. The trap-door would fall; and then, having repelled the Hun, they
  could return and examine the bag at their leisure. So much for the plot. Now
  for the action.</p>

  <p>It has always been my contention that Brigadier-General Herbert Firebrace
  rather brought it on himself. There are things which generals may do, and
  there are things which they may not; or shall we say, lest I be deemed guilty
  of <i>lþse majestÚ</i>, things it were better they did not? All things to
  them are lawful, but all things most undoubtedly are not expedient. And no
  one&mdash;not even his most fervent admirer&mdash;could say that the
  General's action was a wise one. Let it be understood that when the more
  exalted ones of the earth desire to make a tour of trenches, there is a
  recognised procedure for doing it. First comes the sergeant of the platoon
  occupying the portion of the line under inspection&mdash;experience has shown
  the wisdom of having the only trustworthy guide in front. Then comes the
  company commander, followed by the Colonel, the Staff officer and the Great
  One. Immediately behind, the Adjutant (taking notes), the platoon commander
  (partially dazed), the machine-gun officer (not essential), and the Sapper
  (if he's been caught by the human avalanche) advance in echelon. At intervals
  the procession halts, and the same religious rite takes place.</p>

  <p>SERGEANT (<i>peering round the next traverse, in voice of fury</i>):
  "Don't drink tea out of yer tin 'at, yer perisher! 'Ere's the General a-
  coming."</p>

  <p>COLONEL (<i>prompted by company commander</i>): "Now from here, sir, we
  get a most magnificent field of fire behind&mdash;ah&mdash;those craters
  there. I thought that&mdash;where was it we decided?&mdash;oh, yes,
  by&mdash;ah&mdash;putting a Lewis gun here... er, well, perhaps you'd like to
  look yourself, sir."</p>

  <p>GREAT ONE: "Yes, very much. Have you got my periscope?" (<i>Staff officer
  produces, and Great One peers through it.</i>) "I quite agree with you."
  (<i>After long inspection</i>) "You might make a note of it."</p>

  <p>STAFF OFFICER: "Just make a note of that, will you?"</p>

  <p>ADJUTANT (<i>makes note</i>): "Make a note of it, Bill, will you?"</p>

  <p>PLATOON COMMANDER (<i>recovering slightly from stupor</i>): "Make a note
  of what?"</p>

  <p>MACHINE-GUN OFFICER: "All right, old boy. It's my pidgeon." (<i>Sotto voce
  to SAPPER</i>) "I've had a gun there for the last two nights." (<i>Aloud to
  OMNES</i>) "An excellent place, sir. I'll see to it."</p>

  <p>SAPPER (<i>to M.G.O., with seeming irrelevance</i>): "Well, when he got to
  the house he was told she was having a bath, and&mdash;" Procession moves on,
  while infuriated sentry on sap duty misses the point of the story. And that
  is the right way of touring the trenches.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately General Firebrace was a new broom. It was quite permissible
  for him to do what he did, but, as I said before, I am doubtful if it was
  altogether wise. In a moment of rashness he decided to go round the trenches
  alone. As a matter of fact, at the moment of this resolve the Brigade-Major
  was out, the evening was fine, and the General was energetic. Perfect peace
  reigned over that portion of the battle area which concerned him, and he was
  anxious to see that the arrangement of sentry groups in the various sap-heads
  met with his approval. His predecessor, he recalled, had had words with the
  still greater ones of the earth anent a couple of small, but nevertheless
  regrettable, incidents when men had been removed somewhat forcibly by the
  wily Hun from out those same sap-heads. So he settled his steel helmet firmly
  on his head, and stepped out of his dug-out into the communication
  trench.</p>

  <p>Now in that particular part of the line the communication trenches were
  long ones, and by the time he reached the front line it was getting dark. A
  man of small stature, but withal fiery appearance, General Herbert Firebrace
  strode along through the deepening gloom, humming gently to himself. At first
  the trenches were fairly populous&mdash;he was in a part of the front line
  between two groups of craters&mdash;and he found it necessary to bark
  "Gangway!" continuously. Then he reached his goal, the saps behind one of the
  groups&mdash;short trenches which stretch out from the fire trench into No
  Man's Land and finish on the near lips of the craters. He grunted with
  satisfaction as he found the first of the saps held to his satisfaction. The
  sentry group were quietly smoking; the sentry up at the head of the sap was
  watching fixedly through his periscope. The rifles and bayonets of the men
  rested close at hand, the Mills bombs were conveniently placed on a narrow
  ledge under cover.</p>

  <p>"Ha, good! All quiet here, my lads?"</p>

  <p>"All quiet, sir," answered the corporal, scrambling up.</p>

  <p>"That's all right. Good night, corporal." And the martial little figure
  disappeared round the corner.</p>

  <p>Now the corporal was new in that bit of the line; to be exact, he had just
  returned from leave. That was one cause.</p>

  <p>"Look out&mdash;oil-can!" The sentry gave a hail, and every one ducked.
  That was the other cause.</p>

  <p>For at the precise moment that an oil-can exploded with a thunderous crump
  twenty yards or so beyond the trench, there was a sudden noise of ripping
  canvas, an agonised shout, and the heavy crash of a body encountering china.
  Then&mdash;silence. The sap parties heard only the oil-can; Percy FitzPercy
  for a wonder was not brooding over his invention, and there was no one who
  knew that close beside them in an odoriferous underground abode the
  Brigadier-General lay completely stunned, with his head in a metal soup
  tureen and his rather extensive set of uppers in a disused tin hitherto
  devoted to that painstaking gentleman, Mr. Maconochie.</p>

  <p>Up to this point it will be willingly conceded, I think, by any one
  acquainted with trench etiquette that the unfortunate predicament of Herbert
  Firebrace, General and Great One, was only what he deserved. To depart so
  flagrantly from the spirit of the rules as to wander round front-line
  trenches alone and in the falling shades of night is asking for trouble; and
  if the matter had ended there I have no doubt&mdash;knowing the strict sense
  of justice which is one of the praiseworthy features of the house of
  Firebrace&mdash;I have no doubt that he would have sent for Percy FitzPercy
  and apologised handsomely for the inconvenience he had so unwittingly caused.
  But the matter did not end there; it only began. And the finale, reviewed
  dispassionately, undoubtedly gives one to think&mdash;one might even say
  think furiously.</p>

  <p>A quarter of an hour after the regrettable occurrence just described Percy
  stood chatting lightly and inconsequently with his company commander in the
  support line. At the moment he was expatiating on the merits of a new pipe of
  his own invention designed for use in No Man's Land on a dark night. Its
  exact beauties escape my memory; as far as I can remember one put the bowl in
  one's mouth and the tobacco in the stem and blew. It was an invention typical
  of Percy&mdash;utterly futile. He had just called the company commander "dear
  old soul" for the tenth time, and was explaining how no sparks or glowing ash
  could be seen if you made use of this patent atrocity, when a Lewis gun
  started rattling away in front. Half a dozen Verey lights shot up, there was
  a sudden brisk burst of firing, with the explosion of a number of bombs.</p>

  <p>"By Jove!" cried Percy, pipe and all else forgotten. "By Jove, dear old
  man&mdash;a raid&mdash;what? A Hun raid&mdash;now for the man-trap!" He
  departed at speed up the nearest boyau, leaving a trail of sparks behind him
  like a catherine-wheel that has been out in the rain; to be followed by his
  Captain, who had first taken the precaution of loading his automatic.</p>

  <p>The first man Percy met was the tooth-sucker, who was shaking with
  uncontrollable excitement.</p>

  <p>"There's a perisher fell in the 'ole, sir! Three of 'em come in, and we
  killed two an' the other fell in the 'ole."</p>

  <p>I am given to understand that on receipt of the news what little intellect
  our pipe-inventor ever possessed completely deserted him. Uttering hoarse
  cries, he dashed down the trench, and, unmindful of his own orders to wait on
  the chance of catching a second, he feverishly slashed at the string, and
  with an ominous clang and a squelch of mud the trap-door descended into its
  appointed position. Certain it is, when the company commander came in sight,
  he was standing upon it, in an attitude strongly reminiscent of the heavy
  tragedian&mdash;out of a "shop"&mdash;holding forth in his favourite
  Bodega.</p>

  <p>"What the blazes are you doing there?" howled his infuriated Captain. "Why
  aren't you in number eight sap, instead of doing a dumb-crambo show?"</p>

  <p>"The raid is over, sir," answered Percy, majestically. "The raider
  is&mdash;ah&mdash;below."</p>

  <p>"What the&mdash;" began the frenzied senior. And then he paused. "Great
  Scott! What's that infernal shindy?"</p>

  <p>From below their feet there rose a perfect orgy of breaking china and
  rattling tins, with ever and anon a loud musical note as of a bucket being
  belaboured with a stick. Grunts and guttural curses, followed by strange
  hollow noises indicative of pain, for a while drowned all attempts at
  conversation. Finally there was a grand finale of crashing cups and tinkling
  tins, the sound of a heavy blow, a grunt of muffled agony and&mdash;silence.
  The lights still hissed up into the night, stray rifles still cracked at
  intervals, but otherwise&mdash;silence.</p>

  <p>At last Percy spoke. "Do you know, dear old boy, I believe there are two
  of them down there; 'pon my soul, I do&mdash;what?" He spoke with
  deliberation, as befits an inventor. "It seemed to me that the one who swore
  and the one who grunted were different people."</p>

  <p>The tooth-sucker opined likewise; also Tomkins, who had arrived on the
  scene.</p>

  <p>"What is this dam foolishness?" said the Captain irritably. "Am I to
  understand there are two Germans inside there, under the trench?"</p>

  <p>"One for certain; two possibly&mdash;or even three, dear old boy." At the
  thought of three, he of the teeth played a tune in his excitement.</p>

  <p>"Then for heaven's sake get the top off and let's get them out!"</p>

  <p>It was then that the last cruel blow of Fate was dealt to the hapless
  Herbert. For after a brief period of feverish pulling, during which the
  company commander broke his nails and Percy fell over backwards, the
  trap-door remained <i>in statu quo</i>.</p>

  <p>"What the devil's the matter with the beastly thing?" muttered the
  Captain, savagely. "It's your fool-trick, FitzPercy! Can't you open it?"</p>

  <p>"My dear old boy," remarked the proud inventor vaguely, "it generally
  opens&mdash;'pon my soul, it does." He turned his torch on to the reluctant
  trench-board and examined it through his eyeglass. "By Jove! that's it, dear
  old son, there's the trouble. The dud shell has slipped forward and got
  wedged in the rafters. How doocid funny&mdash;what?"</p>

  <p>"What is doocid funny, you blithering ass?"</p>

  <p>"Why, if we'd gone on, dear old sport, the shell might have gone off. By
  Jove, that's good, that is!" Percy chuckled immoderately. "If we go on, the
  shell goes off!"</p>

  <p>"You're the type of man who ought to be in a home," remarked his senior
  officer dispassionately. "Get a saw as soon as you can, and cut through the
  board. And if the bally shell goes off and kills you, it'll serve you right.
  You're a disease, FitzPercy, that's what you are. A walking microbe; an
  example of atavism; a throw-back to the tail period." Still muttering, his
  company commander passed out of sight, leaving the triumphant Percy
  completely unabashed and glowing with righteous success.</p>

  <p>Now, in the trenches saws do not grow freely. You cannot wander round a
  corner and pick one up; in fact, a saw that will saw is an exceeding precious
  thing. Moreover, they are closely guarded by their rightful owners, who show
  great reluctance in parting with them. It therefore was not surprising that
  over an hour elapsed before a perspiring messenger returned with one and
  operations commenced. And during that hour Percy lived.</p>

  <p>It is given to few to see their hopes and aspirations realised so
  beautifully and quickly; as in a dream he listened to the hideous
  cachinnations that floated up through the slabs of the trench-board. A
  continuous booming noise as of a bittern calling to its young was varied with
  heavy grunts and occasional blows of a heavy bludgeon on metal. And
  throughout it all there ran a delicate motif of crashing cups and tinkling
  tins.</p>

  <p>"We have them, dear old soul," murmured Percy ecstatically to himself; "we
  have them simply wallowing in the mulligatawny!"</p>

  <p>But there is an end of everything&mdash;even of getting a saw out of an
  R.E. store. A glorious full moon shone down upon the scene as, an hour
  afterwards, the trench-board was removed and the entrance opened. An "up-
  and-over"&mdash;or trench-ladder&mdash;was lowered into the dug-out, and the
  excited onlookers waited to vet the catch. At last the ladder shook, as the
  first of the prisoners prepared to ascend.</p>

  <p>"Entrance, dear old man," cried the stage-manager, majestically, "of what
  we have hitherto described as 'male voices off.'"</p>

  <p>"Get up, you swine, and get a move on!" rasped a voice in perfect English
  from the depths of the hole; while a palsied silence settled on the
  audience.</p>

  <p>The ladder shook again, and at last there emerged from the bottom of the
  trench a large round tin which completely encased the head of its wearer, who
  slowly followed, maintaining a continuous booming roar. Immediately behind
  him came the owner of the voice, severely chipped about the face, but with
  the light of battle in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Now, you&mdash;" The words died away in his mouth. "Great heavens! The
  General!" And as the frozen eye of the speaker, who had been the other
  occupant of the hole, wandered round the stricken onlookers, even Percy's
  nerve broke. It was the Colonel.</p>

  <p>I will draw the veil of reticence over the remainder of this harrowing
  narrative. The procession back to Brigade Head-quarters has become historic.
  The attempt to remove the soup tureen on the spot caused its unhappy
  possessor such agony, and gave rise to so much unseemly and ill-repressed
  mirth on the part of the audience, that it was hastily abandoned, and the
  wretched man was led gently back to his dug-out.</p>

  <p>The Brigade-Major, who had been notified over the telephone, met him at
  the entrance with a handkerchief suspiciously near his mouth.</p>

  <p>"How dreadful, sir!" he murmured, in a voice that shook a little. "I
  have&mdash;er&mdash;sent for a tin-opener."</p>

  <p>The General was led to a chair, into which he sank wearily, while in
  hushed tones the Colonel explained what had happened to the shaking
  Staff.</p>

  <p>"I was told that the General had been seen going down to the front line
  alone," he remarked in a low tone, "and so I at once followed him. Just as I
  got to the craters there was a small Hun raid. I let drive at one of them
  with my revolver, and the next instant I fell through a hole, full on top of
  some one's back. He let out a roar of pain and scrambled up. Of course I
  thought it was a Hun, and proceeded to beat him over the head with my stick.
  Great Scott, what a show!"</p>

  <p>The Colonel mopped his brow, and the Staff shook still more.</p>

  <p>"I'd dropped my revolver, or I'd probably have shot him. Then suddenly
  there was a clang, and the hole was closed up, while at the same moment
  something charged past me, head down, and hit the wall. There was a roar of
  pain, and the tin became a fixture. The poor old boy had rammed the wall with
  the soup tureen."</p>

  <p>A gurgling noise from the chair interrupted him.</p>

  <p>"What is it, sir?" cried the Staff Captain, solicitously.</p>

  <p>The General hooted mournfully.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. He'll be here very soon, sir. Not much longer now. We've sent
  for a tinsmith from one of the Engineer companies."</p>

  <p>But the booming cantata continued.</p>

  <p>"What does he want?" whispered the Staff Captain. "A drink?"</p>

  <p>The Brigade-Major looked hopeful.</p>

  <p>"Yes; get a whisky and soda and a straw, if there's one left."</p>

  <p>The booming died away.</p>

  <p>A few minutes later the Staff, ably assisted by the General's batman, got
  one end of the straw into the worthy Brigadier's mouth. The Colonel closed
  those holes he could see with his fingers, and the signalling officer held
  the drink.</p>

  <p>"Now, are we ready?" cried the Brigade-Major anxiously. "All right,
  sir&mdash;suck."</p>

  <p>The experiment was not a success. Jets of liquid spurted in all
  directions, an explosion like a geyser shook the tin, and the Staff recoiled
  a pace. In fact, I am given to understand that the chief clerk, an intensely
  interested spectator, so far forgot himself as to counsel the Staff Captain
  to "sit on 'is 'ead."</p>

  <p>"Do you think we could do anything with one of those instruments for
  opening tongues?" hazarded the Staff Captain, when the silence had become
  oppressive and the outbursts of fire extinguished.</p>

  <p>"We might try." The signalling officer was doubtful, but sallied forth,
  and after some delay returned with one. "Where shall we start?"</p>

  <p>"Any old place." The Staff Captain gripped the implement and stepped
  manfully forward. "We're going to try something else, sir&mdash;a tongue-
  opener."</p>

  <p>The General hooted apathetically; the onlookers looked anxious, and the
  Staff Captain got his first grip on the tin.</p>

  <p>"Hold the General's head, Bill," he cried to the Brigade-Major, "so that I
  can get a purchase. Now, then&mdash;one&mdash;two&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A howl of agony rent the air, and even the chief clerk looked pensive.</p>

  <p>"It's his ear, you fool!" The Colonel dodged rapidly out of the door to
  evade the human tornado within, and the situation became crucial. Even the
  tinsmith, who arrived at that moment, a man of phlegmatic disposition, was
  moved out of his habitual calm and applauded loudly.</p>

  <p>"Thank heavens you've come!" gasped the Brigade-Major, keeping a wary eye
  fixed on his frenzied senior, who, surrounded with <i>dÚbris</i> and red ink,
  was now endeavouring to pull the tin off with his hands. "The General has had
  a slight mishap. Can you remove that tin from his head?"</p>

  <p>The expert contemplated his victim in silence for a few moments.</p>

  <p>"Yus," he remarked at length, "I can, sir, if 'e keeps quite still. But I
  won't be answerable for the consequences if 'e don't."</p>

  <p>"No more will I." The Brigade-Major mopped his brow. "For heaven's sake
  get on with it."</p>

  <p>Thus ended the episode of Percy FitzPercy&mdash;his man-trap.</p>

  <p>It might have happened to any one, but only FitzPercy would have searched
  carefully amongst the crockery, and having found what he was looking for made
  a point of bringing it to head-quarters just as the tin was finally
  removed.</p>

  <p>To emerge into the light of two candles and an electric torch with a bit
  of one ear and half a face deficient, and realise that the man responsible
  for it is offering you your uppers in three parts and some fragments, is a
  situation too dreadful to contemplate.</p>

  <p>As I said before, Percy gave up trying after about ten seconds.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap204"
     name="chap204">IV. &mdash; A POINT OF DETAIL</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"Hist!" The officer gripped the sergeant's arm just above
  the elbow, bringing his mouth close up to his ear. "Don't move." The words
  were hardly breathed, so low was the tense, sudden whisper, and the two men
  crouched motionless, peering into the darkness which enveloped them.</p>

  <p>"Where, sir?" The sergeant slowly twisted his head till it was almost
  touching that of the man beside him; and he too, whose normal voice resembled
  a human fog horn, scarcely did more than frame the words with his lips.</p>

  <p>"Behind that mound of chalk. Several of them." The sergeant's eyes
  followed the line of the outstretched hand until they picked up the dark
  menacing lump in the ground twenty feet away. Sombre, grim, apparently
  lifeless, outlined against the night sky&mdash;it appeared almost monstrous
  in size to the men who lay on the edge of a shell hole, with every nerve
  alert. A bullet spat over them viciously, but they did not alter their
  position&mdash;they knew they were not the target; and from their own lines
  came the sudden clang of a shovel. All around them the night was full of
  vague, indefinable noises; instinctively a man, brought suddenly into such a
  place and ignorant of his whereabouts, would have known that there were men
  all around him: men whom he could not see, men who flitted through the
  shadows bent on mysterious tasks, men who moved silently, with eyes strained
  to pierce the darkness. Behind the German lines a trench tramway was in use;
  the metallic rumble of the trolleys on the iron rails came continuously from
  the distance. And suddenly from close at hand a man laughed....</p>

  <p>"Do you see them?" Once again the officer was whispering, while he still
  grasped, almost unconsciously, the sergeant's arm. "There&mdash;there!
  Look!"</p>

  <p>Two or three shadowy blobs seemed to move uncertainly above the edge of
  the chalk mound and then disappear again; and a moment afterwards, from
  almost on top of them, came a hoarse guttural whisper. The officer's grip
  tightened convulsively; the night of a sudden seemed alive with men close to
  them&mdash;pressing around them. Almost involuntarily he got up and moved
  back a few steps, still peering, straining to see in the inky blackness.
  Something loomed up and bumped into him, only to recoil with a muttered oath;
  and even as he realised it was a German he heard his sergeant's low voice
  from a few feet away. "Where are you, sir? Where are you?" The next moment he
  was back at his side.</p>

  <p>"Get back your own way," he whispered; "we've bumped a big patrol. Don't
  fire." And as he spoke, with a slight hiss a flare shot up into the
  night.</p>

  <p>Now had it not been for that one untimely flare this story would never
  have been written. Indecent curiosity in other wanderers' doings in No Man's
  Land is an unprofitable amusement; while the sound of strafing, to say
  nothing of revolver shots, is calculated to produce a tornado of fire from
  all directions, administered impartially by friend and foe alike. Wherefore
  it is more than likely that but for the sudden ghostly light both the
  Englishmen would have got away. As it was, John Brinton, M.C., Lieutenant in
  His Majesty's Regiment of the Royal Loamshires, found himself crouching in a
  slight dip in the ground and contemplating from a range of four feet no less
  than six Huns similarly engaged. There was the sharp crack of a revolver, a
  struggle, a muffled cry; then silence. Half a dozen more flares went up from
  each line; everywhere sentries peered earnestly towards the sound of the
  shot; a few desultory rifles cracked, and then the night resumed its
  whispering mystery. But at the bottom of the dip five Huns lay on the top of
  a stunned English officer; while the sixth lay still and twisted, with a
  revolver bullet in his brain.</p>

  <p>Twenty minutes afterwards the sergeant, crawling warily on his belly,
  approached a saphead and after a brief word or two dropped in.</p>

  <p>"'Ave you seen Mr. Brinton, sir," he asked anxiously of an officer whom he
  found in the sap, pessimistically smoking a cigarette&mdash;saps are
  pessimistic places.</p>

  <p>"No." The officer looked up quickly. "He was out with you, wasn't he,
  Sergeant Dawson?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir&mdash;on patrol. We'd just a-got to that there chalk 'ummock,
  when we ran into some of 'em. 'E said to me&mdash;'Get back,' 'e said, 'your
  own way,' and then they put up a flare. I couldn't see 'im as I was lying
  doggo in a 'ole, but I 'eard a revolver shot about ten yards away. I looked
  round when the flare was out, but couldn't see him, nor 'ear him. So I
  thought 'e might 'ave got back."</p>

  <p>"Pass the word along for Mr. Brinton." The officer went out of the sap
  into the fire trench. "And get a move on with it." He stood for a few
  moments, looking thoughtful. "I hope," he muttered to himself, "I hope the
  old boy hasn't been scuppered."</p>

  <p>But&mdash;the old boy <i>had</i> been scuppered. A runner failed to
  discover him in the trench; two strong patrols scoured the ground around the
  chalk 'ummock and drew blank. And so, in the fullness of time there appeared
  in the Roll of Honour the name of Lieut. John Brinton, of the Royal
  Loamshires, under the laconic heading of Missing, believed Prisoner of War,
  which is the prologue of this tale of the coalfields of France.</p>

  <p>The part of the line in which the Royal Loamshires found themselves at the
  time of the unfortunate matter of John Brinton, M.C., was somewhere south of
  La BassÚe and somewhere north of Loos&mdash;closer identification is
  undesirable. It is not a pleasant part of the line, though there are many
  worse. The principal bugbears of one's existence are the tunnelling
  companies, who without cessation practise their nefarious trade, thereby
  causing alarm and despondency to all concerned. Doubtless they mean well, but
  their habit of exploding large quantities of ammonal at uncertain hours and
  places does not endear them to the frenzied onlookers, who spend the next
  hour plucking boulders from their eyes. In addition, there is the matter of
  sandbags. The proximity of a mine shaft is invariably indicated by a young
  mountain of these useful and hygienic articles, which tower and spread and
  expand in every direction where they are most inconvenient. I admit that,
  having placed half the interior of France in bags, the disposal of the same
  on arriving in the light of day presents difficulties. I admit that the fault
  lies entirely with the harassed and long-suffering gentleman who boasts the
  proud title of "spoil's officer." I admit&mdash;But I grow warm, in addition
  to digressing unpardonably. The trouble is that I always do grow warm, and
  digress at the mention of sandbags.</p>

  <p>In part of the Loamshires' front line, mining activity was great. A
  continuous group of craters stretched along No Man's Land, separating them
  from the wily Hun, for half the battalion front&mdash;a group which we will
  call Outpost. The name is wrong, but it will serve. To the near lips of each
  crater a sap ran out from the front line, so that merely the great yawning
  hole lay between the saphead and the corresponding abode of the Germans on
  the other lip. Each night these sapheads were held by a small group of men
  armed with Verey lights, bombs, bowie-knives, and other impedimenta of
  destruction; while between the saps the trench was held but lightly&mdash;in
  some cases, not at all. The idea of concentrating men in the front line has
  long been given up by both sides.</p>

  <p>If therefore one strolls along the firing line&mdash;a tedious amusement
  at all times&mdash;it is more than likely that one will find long stretches
  completely deserted. The scene is desolate; the walk is strangely eerie.
  Walls of sandbags tower on each side, in some cases two or three feet above
  one's head; the clouds go scudding by, while the shadows of a traverse dance
  fantastically as a flare comes hissing down. The Hun is thirty yards away;
  the silence is absolute; the place is ghostly with the phantoms of forgotten
  men. And sometimes, as one walks, strange fancies creep into one's brain.
  Relics of childish fears, memories of the bogey man who waited round the end
  of the dark passage at home, come faintly from the past. And foolish though
  it be, one wonders sometimes with a sharp, clutching pang of nervous
  fear&mdash;What is round the next corner?</p>

  <p>Nothing&mdash;of course not. What should there be? The night is quiet; the
  trench is English. The next party is forty yards farther on; the voices of
  the last still come softly through the air. And yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;! But
  I digress again.</p>

  <p>Now not one of the least of all the crimes of those responsible for the
  disposal of the underworld of France, when it comes to the surface in
  sandbags, is the following. (Lest any one may think that I am writing a
  text-book, I would crave patience.) Be it known, then, that to keep out a
  bullet some four feet of earth are necessary. Less than that and the bullet
  will come through and impinge with great violence on the warrior behind. This
  fact is well known to all whose path in life leads them to the trenches; but
  for all that Tommy is a feckless lad. In some ways he bears a marked
  resemblance to that sagacious bird, the ostrich; and because of that
  resemblance, I have remarked on this question of disposing sandbags in terms
  of pain and grief. The easiest thing to do with a sandbag in a trench, if you
  don't want it, is to chuck it out. Human nature being what it is, the
  distance chucked is reduced to a minimum&mdash;in other words, it is placed
  on the edge of the parapet. More follow&mdash;and they are placed beside it
  on the edge of the parapet; which causes the inside edge of the parapet to
  increase in height, but not in thickness. In other words, after a while the
  top two or three layers of bags, though looking perfectly safe from the
  inside, are not bullet proof. Which Tommy knows&mdash;but... well, I have
  mentioned the ostrich.</p>

  <p>Now this state of affairs existed in one or two places behind Outpost
  craters. There were spots where the top of the parapet was not of sufficient
  thickness to keep out a rifle bullet. And it was just by one of these spots
  that the Company Commander, going round one night, suddenly stumbled on
  something that lay sprawling at the bottom of the trench&mdash;an
  unmistakable something. It lay half on the fire step and half off, midway
  between two saps, and the head sagged back helplessly. He switched on his
  torch, and having looked at the huddled form, cursed softly under his breath.
  For it was his senior subaltern, and a bullet had entered his head from
  behind just above the neck. It had come out at his forehead, and we will not
  specify further.</p>

  <p>"Stretcher bearers at once." He went back to the group he had just left.
  "Mr. Dixon has been shot through the parapet, farther up."</p>

  <p>"Killed, sir?" The N.C.O. in charge was in Dixon's platoon.</p>

  <p>"Yes." The Company Officer was laconic. "Brains blown out. It's that
  damned parapet&mdash;one sandbag thick. What the hell's the use of my
  speaking?"</p>

  <p>He had had a trying day, and his tone may be excused. "You sit here and
  you do nothing. The whole company are a set of cursed lazy loafers."</p>

  <p>Seeing that the men were getting an average of six hours' sleep the remark
  was hardly fair, but, as I said, the day had been a trying one and this had
  been the last straw. He strode back again to the dead subaltern, muttering
  angrily.</p>

  <p>"Poor old man," he whispered gently, lifting the legs on to the fire step
  and bending over the still form. "Poor old man; you've solved the Big Mystery
  by now, anyway." The light of his torch fell on the dead man's face, and he
  shuddered slightly: a bullet can do a lot of damage. Then he climbed on the
  fire step and looked over the parapet. It was a place where the spoils party
  had been particularly busy; and though the Company Officer was full six foot,
  he could only just see over the top; as a fire step it was useless to any one
  but a giant from a freak show.</p>

  <p>"Hullo! what's happened?" A voice behind him made him turn round.</p>

  <p>"That you, Dick? Poor little Jerry Dixon been shot through the
  parapet&mdash;that's what's happened." He got down and stood at the bottom of
  the trench beside the second-in-command. "The three top layers there are only
  one bag thick." Once again his language became heated.</p>

  <p>"Steady, old man," Dick Staunton puffed steadily at his pipe, and looked
  at the body lying beside them. "Were you with him when he was hit?"</p>

  <p>"No. Came round visiting the sentries and found him lying there dead."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" He switched on his torch and continued smoking in silence. Suddenly
  he bent forward and peered closely at the shattered head. "Give me a hand for
  a minute. I want to turn the boy over."</p>

  <p>Faintly surprised, he did as he was bid.</p>

  <p>In silence they turned the body over, and again there was silence while
  Staunton carefully examined the spot where the bullet had entered.</p>

  <p>"Strange," he muttered to himself after a few moments, "very strange. Tell
  me, Joe"&mdash;his voice was normal again&mdash;"exactly how did you find
  him? What position was he in?"</p>

  <p>"He was half sitting on the fire step; with his head in the corner and his
  legs sprawling in the bottom of the trench."</p>

  <p>"Sitting? Then his face was towards you."</p>

  <p>"Why, yes. Is there anything peculiar in the fact? He'd probably just been
  having a look over the top, and as he turned away to get down he was hit
  through the sandbags in the back of the neck. His head was a bit forward as
  he was getting down, so the bullet passed through his head and out of his
  forehead."</p>

  <p>In silence they turned the boy over again and covered his face with a
  pocket-handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"You're too much of a blooming detective, you know, old man. Much police
  work has made thee mad," laughed the Company Commander. "What else can have
  happened?"</p>

  <p>"I'm no detective, Joe." The other man smiled slightly. "But there are one
  or two small points of detail which strike me, though I can make nothing out
  of them, I admit. First&mdash;his height. He's six inches shorter than you,
  and yet you could barely see over the top. Therefore, what was he doing
  trying to look over the parapet here of all places? Secondly, the way he
  fell. A man killed instantaneously, and shot through the back of his head,
  would in all probability pitch forward on his face. You say his face was
  towards you, and that he was sitting in the corner of the traverse." He
  paused to fill his pipe.</p>

  <p>"Go on," said the Company Commander curiously. "You interest me."</p>

  <p>"The third point is one on which I admit that I am doubtful. The bullet
  wound is clean. Now I am inclined to think&mdash;though I don't
  know&mdash;that a bullet passing through a chalk bag would become jagged, and
  would not be travelling straight when it continued its flight. However, I
  don't attach much importance to that. And the fourth and last point is almost
  too trifling to mention. Do you notice anything peculiar about his
  uniform?"</p>

  <p>The listener flashed his torch over the dead officer, "No," he said at
  length. "I can't say that I do. Except that one of his regimental badges is
  missing. I suppose you don't mean that, do you?" The Company Officer laughed
  irritably.</p>

  <p>"I do," returned the other quietly. "It's a point of detail, even if a
  little one." He looked thoughtfully at the man in front of him. "Do I strike
  you as a callous sort of devil, old man?"</p>

  <p>"You seem to be treating the boy rather on the line of a specimen for
  improving your deductive powers."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you're right." Staunton turned away. "But I didn't mean it that
  way&mdash;quite. Sorry, Joe; the boy was a pal of yours?"</p>

  <p>"He was."</p>

  <p>"God rest his soul!" The second-in-command spoke low. Then, with a final
  salute to the youngster whose soul had gone to the haven of fighting men, he
  turned away and vanished into the night.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The next day the Company Commander came round to Battalion
  Headquarters.</p>

  <p>"My two best subalterns," grunted the Colonel in disgust, "within two
  days. Very annoying. Good boys&mdash;toppers both of them. You'd go quite a
  way, Dick, before you bettered Brinton and Dixon."</p>

  <p>"You would," affirmed the second-in-command. "Quite a way."</p>

  <p>"And with all your theorising last night, old man," remarked the Captain
  slyly, "we both forgot the obvious solution. He got on the fire step, found
  he couldn't see over&mdash;so he clambered up on top. Then, when he was
  getting down, he was hit, and slithered into the position I found him
  in."</p>

  <p>Staunton regarded the speaker through a haze of tobacco smoke. "I wonder,"
  he murmured at length. "I wonder."</p>

  <p>He did not state that during the morning he had made a point of
  interrogating Jerry Dixon's servant. And that worthy&mdash;an old and trusted
  soldier&mdash;had very positively denied that either of the Pelicans Rampant,
  which formed the regimental badge, had been missing from his master's coat
  the previous evening.</p>

  <p>"Now Mr. Brinton's coat, sir," he remarked thoughtfully, "that did 'ave a
  badge off, that did. But 'is servant!" He snorted, and dismissed the subject
  scornfully.</p>

  <p>As I say, the Major did not mention this fact. After all, it was such a
  very small point of detail.</p>

  <p>To the frivolous-minded, Dick Staunton was at times the cause of a certain
  amount of amusement. Originally in the Army, he had left it when a junior
  captain, and had settled down to the normal life of a country gentleman. By
  nature of a silent disposition, he abominated social functions of all sorts.
  He hunted, he fished, and he shot, and spent the rest of his time studying
  the habits of the wild. And as always happens to a man who lives much with
  nature, his mind gradually got skilled in the noticing of little things.
  Small signs, invisible to the casual observer, he noticed automatically; and
  without being in any sense a Sherlock Holmes, he had acquired the habit of
  putting two and two together in a manner that was, at times, disconcertingly
  correct.</p>

  <p>"Points of detail," he remarked one evening in the dug-out after dinner,
  "are very easy to see if you have eyes to see them with. One is nothing; two
  are a coincidence; three are a moral certainty. A really trained man can see
  a molehill; I can see a mountain; most of you fellows couldn't see the
  Himalayas." With which sage remark he thoughtfully lit his pipe and relapsed
  into silence. And silence being his usual characteristic he came into the
  Battalion Head-quarters dug-out one evening and dropped quietly into a seat,
  almost unnoticed by the somewhat noisy group around the table.</p>

  <p>"Afternoon, Dickie." The Sapper officer looked up and saw him. "D'you hear
  we're pinching your last recruit? Jesson&mdash;this is Major Staunton." He
  turned to a second lieutenant in the Royal Loamshires beside him as he made
  the introduction.</p>

  <p>"How d'you do, sir." Jesson got up and saluted. "I've only just got over
  from England; and now apparently they're attaching me to the R.E., as I'm a
  miner."</p>

  <p>He sat down again, and once more turned his attention to that excellent
  French illustrated weekly without which no officers' mess in France is
  complete. Lest I be run in for libel, I will refrain from further information
  as to its title and general effect on officers concerned.</p>

  <p>For a few moments Staunton sat watching the group and listening with some
  amusement to the criticisms on those lovely members of the fair sex so ably
  portrayed in its pages, and then his attention centred on the revolver he was
  cleaning. Jesson, a good-looking, clean-cut man of about twenty-nine or
  thirty was holding forth on an experience he had had in Alaska, which
  concerned a woman, a team of dogs, and a gentleman known as One-eyed Pete,
  and as he spoke Staunton watched him idly. It struck him that he seemed a
  promising type, and that it was a pity the Tunnellers were getting him.</p>

  <p>"Haven't you got enough disturbers of the peace already," he remarked to
  the Tunnelling officer, "without snatching our ewe lamb?"</p>

  <p>"We are at full strength as a matter of fact, Major," answered an officer
  covered with chalk; "but they do some funny things in the palaces of the
  great. We often get odd birds blowing in. I've been initiating him all this
  morning into the joys of Outpost."</p>

  <p>"And how is jolly old Blighty?" remarked the Adjutant. "Thank Heaven!
  leave approaches."</p>

  <p>"About the same." Jesson helped himself to a whisky-and-soda. "Darker than
  ever, and taxis an impossibility. Still I dare say I shall be glad enough to
  go back when my first leave comes due," he added with a laugh.</p>

  <p>"Is this your first time out?" asked Staunton.</p>

  <p>"Yes." Jesson unbuttoned his burberry and took out his cigarette case.
  Outside the dusk was falling, and he bent forward to get a light from the
  candle flickering on the table in front of him. "The very first time. I've
  been on Government work up to now."</p>

  <p>It was at that moment that a very close observer might have noticed that
  Dick Staunton's pipe ceased to draw with monotonous regularity: he might even
  have heard a quick intake of breath. But he would have had to be a very close
  one&mdash;very close indeed; for the next instant he was again speaking and
  his voice was normal.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you've been at the depot," he hazarded. "Who are there
  now?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, the usual old crowd," answered Jesson "I don't expect you know many
  of them though, do you, Major? Ginger Stretton in the 14th Battalion&mdash;do
  you know him by any chance?"</p>

  <p>"No, I don't think I do." His face was in the shadow, but had it been
  visible a slightly puzzled frown might have been seen on his forehead. "I
  suppose they still make all you fellows on joining go to the regimental
  tailor, don't they?"</p>

  <p>Jesson looked a trifle surprised at the question. "I don't think they are
  as particular as they were," he returned after a moment. "Personally I went
  to Jones &amp; Jones." He casually buttoned up his mackintosh and turned to
  the Tunneller. "If you're ready I think we might be going. I want to see
  about my kit." He got up as he spoke and turned towards the entrance, while
  at the same moment the Sapper rose too. "I'd like to drop in again, sir,
  sometimes if I may." He spoke to the shadow where Staunton had been
  sitting.</p>

  <p>"Do." Jesson gave a violent start, for the voice came from just behind his
  shoulder. Like the hunter he was, Dick Staunton had moved without a sound,
  and now stood directly between Jesson and the door. "But don't go yet. I want
  to tell you a story that may amuse you. Have some tea."</p>

  <p>"Er&mdash;won't it keep till some other time, Major? I'm rather anxious to
  see about my kit."</p>

  <p>"Let the kit keep. Sit down and have some tea."</p>

  <p>"What the devil has come over you, Dickie?" The Adjutant was looking
  frankly amazed. "You aren't generally so loquacious."</p>

  <p>"That's why tonight my little whim must be humoured," answered Staunton
  with a slight smile. "Sit down, please, Jesson. It's quite an amusing little
  yarn, and I would like your opinion on it."</p>

  <p>"No hope for you, old boy. Dickie has turned into a social success." The
  Adjutant laughed and lit a cigarette, and once again became immersed in his
  paper.</p>

  <p>To the casual observer the scene was a very normal one. Four men in a dug-
  out, yarning and reading; while outside the occasional whine of a shell, the
  dirty deeds of a Stokes gun, the noises of the trenches filled the air.
  Nothing unusual, nothing out of the way except&mdash;something, an
  indefinable something. As the Sapper said afterwards there must have been
  something tangible in the atmosphere&mdash;else why did his pulses quicken.
  He glanced at the Adjutant sitting opposite him engrossed in his book; he
  looked at Staunton across the table&mdash;Staunton, with a slight smile on
  his lips&mdash;and his eyes fixed on Jesson. He looked at Jesson beside
  him&mdash;Jesson, whom he had met that morning for the first time. And all he
  noticed about Jesson was that his left knee twitched ceaselessly....</p>

  <p>He ran over in his mind the day's work. He had met him at about eleven
  that morning, wandering along the support line with an officer in the
  Loamshires whom he knew well, who had hailed him and introduced Jesson.</p>

  <p>"A recruit&mdash;a new recruit," he had said, "for your atrocious trade.
  He's just left old pimple-faced Charlie, who was writing returns in
  triplicate as usual."</p>

  <p>Now pimple-faced Charlie was his own Major, who habitually did write
  returns in triplicate; wherefore, after a few remarks of a casual nature in
  which he elicited the fact that Jesson was a mining engineer and had suddenly
  been ordered while waiting at the base to join the 940th Tunnelling Company,
  he took him in tow and showed him round the mine galleries.</p>

  <p>Mining work was very active in the sector. Four or five small mines and
  one big one were going up in the near future, so the tour of inspection had
  been a long one. That his companion was not new to the game was obvious from
  the outset; and his pertinent inquiries anent cross-cuts, listening
  galleries, and the whole of the work in hand had shown that he was keen as
  well. Altogether a promising recruit, he had mused: quite a find&mdash;keen
  and able, two qualities which unfortunately do not go hand in hand quite as
  often as one would like. And now Staunton and this find of his were facing
  one another in silence across the plank table of the dug-out; Jesson, with an
  expression of polite indifference as befitted a subaltern compelled to listen
  to a senior officer's story which he didn't want to hear; Staunton, with an
  enigmatic smile. Then of a sudden Staunton spoke.</p>

  <p>"Have you ever studied the question of the importance of matters of
  detail, Jesson?" he remarked quietly to the impassive figure facing him
  across the table.</p>

  <p>"I can't say that I have, sir," answered the other, politely stifling a
  yawn.</p>

  <p>"You should. A most interesting study. My story concerns points of detail.
  The imperative thing is to be able to sort out the vital points from all the
  others; then piece them together, and arrive at the right answer."</p>

  <p>"It must be very easy to be led astray, I should imagine; and arrive at
  the&mdash;er&mdash;wrong one." Jesson concealed a smile, and waited for the
  Major to continue.</p>

  <p>"Yes and no. It's all a matter of practice." Staunton's imperturbable
  voice was as quiet as ever. "And anyway, it's only in peace time that it
  matters very much whether one is right or wrong. Nowadays! Well&mdash; <i>à
  la guerre comme à la guerre</i>." He smiled gently. "But my story. I want
  you, as an impartial observer, just arrived, with an unbiassed mind, to tell
  me if you think my joining up of two or three points of detail is a sound
  one. Both these officers know the points of detail, so your opinion will be
  more valuable than theirs.</p>

  <p>"A few nights ago our battalion had one of those unfortunate little
  contretemps that so often happen in war. A subaltern of ours, John Brinton by
  name, went out on patrol, and never returned. An exhaustive search in No
  Man's Land failed to discover his body; so we were reluctantly compelled to
  conclude that he was in German hands; whether alive or dead we don't know.
  There we have the first fact in my case. Now for the second.</p>

  <p>"Two nights after that another of our subalterns was killed in a way which
  struck me as peculiar. I will not weary you with all the various little
  points that led me to believe that the bullet which killed him did not come
  from the trenches opposite; I will merely say that his position, his height,
  and the depth of the trench were the most obvious. And granted that my
  conclusions were correct, strange as it might appear at first sight, his
  death must have been caused at close quarters, possibly in the trench
  itself."</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!" muttered the Adjutant, who was now listening with interest.
  "What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Two facts, you see," went on Staunton quietly. "And they would have
  remained unconnected in my mind&mdash;Brinton's capture and Dixon's
  death&mdash;but for a small point of detail. Dixon's jacket was without the
  left regimental badge when his body was found. His servant knows he had them
  both earlier in the day. On the contrary, Brinton had lost his left
  regimental badge for some time. Am I interesting you?"</p>

  <p>"Profoundly, thank you, sir." The man opposite smiled amiably.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad of that; it's an interesting problem. You see the significance
  of that small point about the badge, the way in which it connects very
  intimately Brinton's capture and Dixon's death. So intimately, in fact, does
  it connect them, that one is almost tempted to assume that the man who killed
  Dixon was the man in possession of Brinton's uniform. Are you with me so
  far?"</p>

  <p>"The evidence seems a trifle slight," remarked Jesson.</p>

  <p>"Quite true; the evidence is very slight. But then, it often is.
  Everything up to date turns on the question of the badge. Let me reconstruct
  a possible&mdash;only possible, mark you&mdash;story, based on the
  supposition that my badge theory is correct. A German who speaks English
  perfectly is given a nice warm uniform taken from a captured British officer.
  Then he is told to go over to the British lines and see what he can find out.
  He comes one night; perfectly easy; no trouble; until walking along the front
  line he meets another officer&mdash;alone: an officer of the same regiment as
  that whose uniform he is wearing. Unavoidable; in fact, less likely to raise
  suspicion with the frequent changes that occur if he goes to the same
  regiment than if he went to another. But something happens: either the other
  officer's suspicions are aroused, or the German does not wish to be
  recognised again by him. The trench is quiet; an occasional rifle is going
  off, so he does the bold thing. He shoots him from point-blank
  range&mdash;probably with a Colt. As he stands there with the dead officer in
  front of him, waiting, listening hard, wondering if he has been heard, he
  sees the two badges on the officer's coat. So, being a cool hand, he takes
  off the left one, puts it on his own coat, and disappears for a time. Quite
  easy; especially when the trenches are old German ones."</p>

  <p>"Really, Major, you seem to have made a speciality of detective fiction.
  As you said, I suppose your theory is possible."</p>

  <p>Jesson spoke casually, but his eyes for the first time left the face of
  the man opposite him and roved towards the door. For the first time a sudden
  ghastly suspicion of the truth entered the Sapper's brain; and even as it did
  so he noticed that Staunton's revolver&mdash;the cleansing
  finished&mdash;pointed steadily at Jesson's chest.</p>

  <p>"I am glad you think it possible. To render it probable we must go a bit
  farther. The essence of all detective stories is the final clue that catches
  the criminal, isn't it?" The revolver moved an inch or two farther into
  prominence.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord, Dickie? Is that gun of yours loaded?" cried the Adjutant in
  alarm. For the first time he also seemed to become aware that something
  unusual was happening, and he suddenly stood up. "What the devil is it,
  Major? What have you got that gun on him for?"</p>

  <p>"For fun, dear boy, for fun. It's part of the atmosphere. We've got to the
  point haven't we, where&mdash;in my story, of course&mdash;the German dressed
  in Brinton's uniform comes into the English lines. Now what sort of a man
  would they send in this part of the line, where mining activity is great? I
  continue the theory, you see; that's all."</p>

  <p>He looked at Jesson, who made no reply; though without cessation he
  moistened his lips with his tongue.</p>

  <p>"A miner." The Adjutant's voice cut in. "Go on, for God's sake."</p>

  <p>"Precisely&mdash;a miner. The second point of detail; and two points of
  detail are a strange coincidence&mdash;nothing more. Only&mdash;there is a
  third."</p>

  <p>"And three are a moral certainty, as you've often said." The Adjutant once
  again bent across the table and spoke softly. "Are you fooling,
  Dickie&mdash;are you fooling? If so, the joke has gone far enough."</p>

  <p>But the Sapper's eyes were fixed on a leg that twitched, and they wandered
  now and then to a neck where&mdash;even in the dim light of a candle&mdash;he
  could see a pulse throbbing&mdash;throbbing.</p>

  <p>"It's not a joke," he said, and his mouth was dry. "What is the third
  point of detail, Dickie?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, what is the third point of detail, sir?" Jesson's voice was steady
  as a rock. "I am very interested in your problem." He raised his hands from
  the table and stretched them in front of him. Not a finger quivered, and with
  a sublime insolence he examined his nails.</p>

  <p>To the Sapper there occurred suddenly those lines of Kipling,</p>

  <p>"For there is neither East nor West, border nor breed nor birth, When two
  strong men come face to face though they come from the ends of the
  earth."</p>

  <p>He <i>knew</i> now; he realised the man beside him was a German; he knew
  that the sentence of death was very near. What the clue was that had given
  the man away he hardly thought about&mdash;in fact, he hardly cared. All he
  knew was that death was waiting for the man beside him, and that his hands
  were steady as a rock.</p>

  <p>Quietly Staunton leant forward and undid Jesson's mackintosh. Then he sat
  back and with his finger he pointed at a spot above his left breast-pocket.
  "You have never been out to the front, you say; your coat is a new one by
  Jones &amp; Jones; and yet&mdash;until recently&mdash;you have been wearing
  the ribbon of a medal. What medal, Jesson, what medal? It shows up, that
  clean patch in the light. John Brinton went to Jones &amp; Jones; and John
  Brinton had a Military Cross."</p>

  <p>For a full minute the two men looked into one another's eyes&mdash; deep
  down, and read the things that are written underneath, be a man English or
  German. Then suddenly Jesson smiled slightly and spoke.</p>

  <p>"You are a clever man, Major Staunton. When will the rifle practice take
  place?"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Thus it ended, the play of which John Brinton's
  disappearance formed the prologue. But before the curtain rang down on the
  epilogue the German told them one or two little things: that John Brinton was
  alive and well; that the existence of Ginger Stretton, to whom he had alluded
  so glibly, had only become known to him from a letter in Brinton's coat; that
  the peculiarities of pimple-faced Charlie had been forced on him by his guide
  before they met the Sapper.</p>

  <p>"In fact," as the Adjutant remarked, "the fellow was almost too good a
  sportsman to&mdash;" But that's the epilogue.</p>

  <p>A file of men; a watery sun just starting its day's work; a raw, chilly
  morning. In front&mdash;a man: a man with a white disc of paper pinned over
  the heart.</p>

  <p>A word of command; a pushing forward of safety catches; a volley; a
  finish.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap205"
     name="chap205">V. &mdash; MY LADY OF THE JASMINE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The Kid staggered wearily along the road through the
  blinding rain. Dodging between the endless streams of traffic, which moved
  slowly in both directions, now stopping for ten minutes, now jolting forward
  again for a couple of hundred yards, he walked on towards where he thought
  his battalion was. The last Staff officer he had seen had told him that, as
  far as he knew, they had pulled out to rest in some dug-outs about four miles
  farther on&mdash;dug-outs which had only recently been taken from the
  Germans. To start with he had got on to a lorry, but when darkness fell, and
  the total progression had been one mile, he decided to walk and save time.
  Occasionally the lights of a car shone in his face, as its infuriated
  occupant broke every rule of the Somme roads by double banking; that is,
  trying to pass the vehicles in front. But at last the traffic wore thinner as
  the road approached the front line, and an hour and a half after he had left
  the lorry, it stopped altogether, save for pack-mules and squelching men. The
  rain still sogged down, and&mdash;ye gods! the Kid was tired. Away into the
  night there stretched a path of slippery duck-boards, threading its way
  between shell holes half filled with water. Men loomed up out of the darkness
  and went past him, slipping and sliding, cursing below their breath. A shower
  of sparks shot up into the air from a dug-out on his right, and a great
  lobbing flare away in the distance lit up the scene for a second or two with
  a ghostly radiance. It showed the Kid the only other near occupant of the
  reclaimed territory at the moment: a mule, whose four hoofs stuck stiffly out
  of a shell hole&mdash;pointing at him, motionless. With a shudder he moved on
  along the duck-walk. After all he was but a kid, and he was almighty
  tired.</p>

  <p>For three days he seemed to have been on the run without closing his eyes.
  First the battalion had gone over the top; then they had worked like slaves
  consolidating what they'd won; afterwards he had been sent for because of his
  knowledge of French and German to go back to Divisional Headquarters; and
  then he had come back to find the battalion had moved. And any who may have
  tried walking five or six miles by night in heavy rain to an unknown
  destination along some of the roads east of Albert, will bear out that it is
  a wearisome performance. When to these facts is added the further information
  that the age of the boy was only eighteen, it will be conceded that the
  breaking-point was not far off.</p>

  <p>Now I have emphasised the physical condition of the Kid, as he was known
  to all and sundry, because I think it may have a bearing on the story I am
  going to relate. I am no expert in "ologies" and other things dealing with
  so-called spiritualistic revelations. I might even say, in fact, that I am
  profoundly sceptical of them all, though to say so may reveal my abysmal
  ignorance. So be it; my thumbs are crossed. This is not a controversial
  treatise on spiritualism, and all that appertains thereto. One thing,
  however, I will say&mdash;in my ignorance, of course. Until some of the great
  thinkers of the world have beaten down the jungle of facts beyond our ken,
  and made a track&mdash;be it never so narrow&mdash;free from knaves and
  charlatans, it is ill-advised for Mrs. Smith or Lady de Smythe to believe
  that Signer Macaroni&mdash;<i>nÚ</i>Jones&mdash;will reveal to them the
  secrets of the infinite for two pounds. He may; on the other hand, he may
  not. That the secrets are there, who but a fool can doubt; it is only Signer
  Macaroni's power of disinterested revelation that causes my unworthy
  scepticism.</p>

  <p>And so let us come back to the Kid, and the strange thing that happened in
  a recently captured German dug-out on the night of which I have been writing.
  It was just as he had decided&mdash;rain or no rain&mdash;to lie down and
  sleep in the mud and filth&mdash;anywhere, anything, as long as he could
  sleep&mdash;that suddenly out of the darkness ahead he heard the Adjutant's
  voice, and knew that he had found the battalion. With almost a sob of
  thankfulness at the unexpected finish to his worries, he hailed him.</p>

  <p>"Hullo! is that you, Kid?" The Adjutant loomed out of the darkness. "We
  thought you were lost for good. Are you cooked?"</p>

  <p>"I'm just about done in," answered the boy. "Where is B Company?"</p>

  <p>"I'll show you. It's the hell of a place to find even by day; but you've
  got 'some' dug-out. Beer, and tables, and beds; in fact, it's the first
  dug-out I've seen that in any way resembles the descriptions one reads in the
  papers."</p>

  <p>"Well, as long as I can get to sleep, old man, I don't care a damn if it's
  the Ritz or a pigsty." The Kid plucked his foot from a mud-hole, and
  squelched on behind the Adjutant.</p>

  <p>Now much has been written about German dug-outs&mdash;their size, their
  comfort, the revolving book-cases, the four-poster beds. Special mention has
  frequently been made of cellars full of rare old vintages, and of concreted
  buttery hatches; of lifts to take stout officers to the ground, and of
  portable derricks to sling even stouter ones into their scented valises. In
  fact, such stress has been laid upon these things by people of great
  knowledge, that I understand an opinion is prevalent amongst some earnest
  thinkers at home that when a high German officer wishes to surrender he first
  sends up two dozen of light beer on the lift to placate his capturers,
  rapidly following himself with a corkscrew. This may or may not be so;
  personally, I have had no such gratifying experience. But then, personally, I
  have generally been hard put to it to recognise the dug-outs of reality from
  the dug-outs of the daily papers. Most of them are much the same as any
  ordinary, vulgar English dug-out; many are worse; but one or two undoubtedly
  are very good. In places where the nature of the ground has lent itself to
  deep work, and the lines have been stagnant for many moons, the Huns have
  carried out excellent work for the suitable housing of their officers. And it
  was down the entrance of one of these few and far between abodes that the Kid
  ultimately staggered, with the blessed feeling in his mind of rest at last.
  Round a table in the centre sat the other officers of B Company, discussing
  the remains of a very excellent German repast. As he came in they all looked
  up.</p>

  <p>"The lost sheep," sang out the Captain cheerfully. "Come on, my kidlet,
  draw up, and put your nose inside some beer."</p>

  <p>"Not a bad place, is it?" chimed in the Doctor, puffing at a large and fat
  cigar of Hun extraction. "Excellent cellar of rare old ale, cigars of great
  potency&mdash;real genuine Flor de Boche&mdash;a picture gallery
  of&mdash;er&mdash;a pleasing description, and a bed. What more can man
  desire?"</p>

  <p>"Private MacPherson does not approve, I fear me, of the pictures,"
  chuckled the senior subaltern. "I heard him muttering dark things about
  'painted Jezebels,' and 'yon scarlet women of Babylon.'"</p>

  <p>"It must be very dreadful for all concerned to go through life with a mind
  like MacPherson's." The Doctor was examining his cigar doubtfully. "There is
  an obstruction in this. It's either going to explode with great force in a
  minute, or else I'm coming to the motto. Hi! you blighter&mdash;" he jumped
  up hurriedly to avoid the stream of beer that shot across the table from the
  Kid's overturned glass.</p>

  <p>"Idiot child." The Company Commander roused himself from his gentle doze
  to contemplate the delinquent. Then he smiled. "Man, he's asleep; the boy's
  beat to a frazzle."</p>

  <p>"Aye, you're right. Tim, come off that bed; the Kid is fair cooked. Wake
  up, infant." The Doctor shook him by the shoulder. "Wake up. Take off your
  boots, and then get down to it on the bed."</p>

  <p>The Kid sat up blinking. "I'm very sorry," he said after a moment. "Did I
  upset the beer?"</p>

  <p>"You did&mdash;all over me," laughed the Doctor. "Get your boots off and
  turn in."</p>

  <p>"I'm so cursed sleepy." The Kid was removing his sodden puttees. "I've
  walked, and walked, and I'm just about&mdash;" He straightened himself in his
  chair, and as he did so the words died away on his lips. With a peculiar
  fixed look he stared past the Doctor into the corner of the dug-out. "My
  God!" he whispered at last, "what are you doing here?"</p>

  <p>A sudden silence settled on the mess, and instinctively everybody,
  including the Doctor, glanced towards the corner. Then the Doctor turned once
  more to the boy, and his glance was the glance of his profession.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter, Kid?" His tone was abrupt, even to curtness. "Did you
  think you saw something?"</p>

  <p>"I thought&mdash;I thought&mdash;" The boy passed his hand over his
  forehead. "I'm sorry&mdash;I must have been dreaming. It's gone now. I
  suppose I'm tired." But his eyes still searched the dug-out fearfully.</p>

  <p>"What did you think you saw?" asked the Doctor shortly.</p>

  <p>"I thought I saw&mdash;" Once again he stopped; then he laughed a little
  shakily. "Oh! it doesn't matter what I thought I saw. Damn it! I'm tired; let
  me turn in."</p>

  <p>The Doctor's eye met the Company Commander's over the table, and he
  shrugged his shoulders slightly. "Dead beat." His lips framed the words, and
  he returned to the contemplation of his cigar, which was not doing all that a
  well-trained cigar should.</p>

  <p>The Kid stood up and glanced round the mess at his brother officers a
  little shamefacedly; only to find them engrossed&mdash;a trifle
  ostentatiously&mdash;in their own business. "I'm sorry, you fellows," he
  blurted out suddenly. "Forgive me being such a fool; I suppose I'm a bit
  tired."</p>

  <p>The Doctor took him firmly by the arm, and led him towards the bed. "Look
  here, old soul," he remarked, "if you wish to avoid the wrath of my
  displeasure, you will cease talking and go to bed. Every one knows what it is
  to be weary; and there's only one cure&mdash;sleep."</p>

  <p>The Kid laughed and threw himself on the bed. "Jove!" he muttered
  sleepily; "then it's a pleasant medicine, Doctor dear." He pulled a blanket
  over his shoulders; his head touched the pillow; his eyes closed; and before
  the Doctor had resumed his seat the Kid was asleep.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">It seemed only a minute afterwards that he was awake again,
  staring into the dim-lit dug-out with every sense alert. He was conscious
  first of a faint elusive scent&mdash;a scent which was new to him. His mind
  wandered to the scents he knew&mdash;Chaminade, MystÚrieuse, Trþfle
  Incarnat&mdash;but this was different. Delicate, sensuous, with the slightest
  suggestion of jasmine about it, it seemed to permeate every part of him.
  Vaguely expectant, he waited for something that he knew must happen. What it
  would be, he had no idea; he felt like a man waiting for the curtain to rise
  on a first night, when the music of the overture is dying away to a finish.
  He experienced no fear: merely an overwhelming curiosity to witness the
  drama, and to confirm his certainty about the owner of the scent. In his mind
  there was no doubt as to who she was. It was the girl he had seen in the
  corner as he was taking off his puttees: the girl who had looked at him with
  eyes that held the sadness of the world and its despair in them; the girl who
  had vanished so quickly. Her disappearance did not strike him as peculiar;
  she would explain when she came. And so the Kid waited for the drop-scene to
  lift.</p>

  <p>It struck him as he glanced round the dug-out that the furniture had been
  moved. The table seemed nearer the wall; the chairs were differently
  arranged. Instead of the remnants of a finished meal, papers arranged in neat
  piles met his eye. The place looked more like an office than a mess. Suddenly
  he stiffened into attention; steps were coming down the entrance to the dug-
  out. A man came in, and with a gasp the Kid recognised a German soldier. He
  strove to shout&mdash;to warn his brother officers who he knew were
  peacefully sleeping in valises on the floor; but no sound came. His tongue
  stuck to the roof of his mouth; he could only watch, rigid and
  motionless.</p>

  <p>The German moved to the hanging lamp, and turned it up till a bright light
  flooded the dug-out.</p>

  <p>"Now," the Kid's brain was racing, "he must see them. My God! they must
  have got back during the night."</p>

  <p>But no. The German servant moved towards the cupboard which contained the
  food, brushing so close to the bed that the Kid could have touched him with
  ease as he passed. Very cautiously he raised his head as he saw the man, his
  back turned, fumbling on the shelves, and looked round the room. Then with
  the icy hand of terror clutching at his heart he lay back again. The room was
  empty; his brother officers had gone&mdash;murdered probably&mdash; and with
  him it could only be a question of moments before he too was discovered.</p>

  <p>For an instant he had a wild idea of hurling himself upon the German: of
  taking him unawares&mdash;of trying to escape. Then the soldier turned: the
  opportunity had passed, and once again the silent spectator on the bed lay
  rigid. The servant, stolid and unemotional, moved heavily about the dug-out,
  laying the table for a meal. Once it seemed to the Kid that he looked
  straight at him; he could have sworn that he must have been seen; and
  yet&mdash; apparently not. The man gave no sign, and it occurred to the Kid
  that perhaps he was lying in the shadow. Stealthily he wormed himself even
  nearer the wall: impelled by the instinct of self-preservation that would put
  off to the last possible moment the inevitable discovery. And hardly had he
  edged himself in against the wall, when with a sinking heart he heard voices
  outside: voices which spoke in German. With only the servant to tackle,
  somehow he had not felt so hopeless; now he knew the end had come.</p>

  <p>Two officers entered, wiping the perspiration from their foreheads. One
  from his badges of rank he recognised as a Colonel&mdash;the other was a
  Lieutenant; and the discussion was&mdash;as far as their difference of rank
  allowed&mdash;obviously of an acrimonious nature. The Kid listened intently;
  thanking Heaven, not for the first time in his life, that some one with a
  grain of common sense had had him taught French and German by a method other
  than the Public School one. The predilection of his aunt's gardener for pens,
  ink, and paper would not have helped him much in that conversation.</p>

  <p>"Beer, you fool," grunted the Colonel to the stolid servant. "Then,
  go."</p>

  <p>Impatiently he waited till the orderly's footsteps died away, and then he
  turned savagely on the other officer.</p>

  <p>"I tell you, Lieutenant Rutter, we <i>must</i> know," he snarled. "A
  girl&mdash;what is a girl, when big issues are at stake? There are many more
  girls, Lieutenant Rutter; many more girls. Be very careful lest not only does
  this one die, but you also meet with an accident. Dead men cannot make love
  to those other girls." He banged his fist on the table and glared at the
  Lieutenant, who was staring moodily in front of him.</p>

  <p>"I know that, Excellency," he returned after a moment. "But there is a
  proverb about bringing a horse to the water and not being able to make him
  drink."</p>

  <p>"Bah! There are methods, my friend, of drowning the brute with water, if
  it won't drink willingly. And those methods will have to be adopted in this
  case."</p>

  <p>"They are doubtless effective in killing the horse; but they will not lead
  us very much farther in our inquiries."</p>

  <p>"Which is the reason why I have allowed you so much rope. I know as well
  as you do that willing information is worth ten times as much as when it is
  forced. You have made love to the girl, you have been playing the fool for
  six weeks with her, and we are no nearer than when we started." He sneered
  openly. "Since when have we become so dilatory, my friend? You seem to have
  lost your form with the fair sex."</p>

  <p>The Lieutenant flushed, and his fist clenched. "Don't mention those
  others. I love this girl."</p>

  <p>"No doubt thinking of marriage?" The sneer was even more in evidence.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Excellency, I am thinking of marriage." His voice was ominously
  quiet.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid, Lieutenant Rutter, it will remain in the beautiful and
  nebulous realms of thought, unless&mdash;" He paused and drained his beer
  ostentatiously, though all the while his eyes never left his companion's
  face.</p>

  <p>"Unless," repeated the Lieutenant drearily, "she agrees to do some
  charming and honourable spying work for us on the other side of the
  lines."</p>

  <p>"You speak very strangely, Lieutenant Rutter." The little pig eyes of the
  senior officer glinted menacingly. "Have a care."</p>

  <p>"Pardon, Excellency. For the moment I forgot." With a weary gesture he got
  up. "I will ask her this morning." He looked at his watch. "She should be
  here very soon."</p>

  <p>"Then I will await the result of your interview through here." The Colonel
  moved to a door half concealed by a curtain. "You shall have your turtle
  dove, Rutter, in peace and quiet." He chuckled harshly. "You know what we
  want?"</p>

  <p>"By heart, Excellency."</p>

  <p>"And you remember that her brother the Comte is not really dead. For our
  purposes he is a prisoner."</p>

  <p>"I am not likely to forget; but I warn you, Excellency, I have but little
  hope of succeeding."</p>

  <p>The Colonel's jaw shut like a vice. "Then God help you both, my friend;
  God help you both." His voice was soft, but horribly menacing; and as the
  curtain dropped behind him, the Kid, who had been listening spellbound,
  understood for the first time the type of man who represented Prussian
  militarism.</p>

  <p>Instinctively his heart warmed towards the Lieutenant, who with a weary
  gesture of despair was resting his head on his arms. He was young, clean cut,
  almost an Englishman to look at, save for his close-cropped bristling hair;
  and, moreover, he was up against it. All the Kid's sporting instincts rose
  within him. Boche or no Boche this was not the type of swine who launched gas
  and liquid fire on a horror-struck world. Forgetful of everything he was on
  the point of going over to him and telling him to stick it out, when his eyes
  rested on the entrance. And there was the girl: the girl he had seen in the
  corner, the girl of the jasmine scent. For a while she stood watching the
  bowed figure at the table, and then she tip-toed across to him and laid her
  hand on his head.</p>

  <p>With a quick start he looked up, and into his face there came the light of
  all the ages, the light of the man for the woman he loves.</p>

  <p>"Marie," he whispered hoarsely. "Marie&mdash;<i>que je t'adore</i>." He
  caught her to him and kissed her on the lips. Then, with a bitter groan, he
  pushed her away and sat down again.</p>

  <p>"Fritz, what is it?" she cried in wondering tones. "You sent for me, my
  dear. Why? I came; but it is not right for me to come to you here&mdash; in
  your dug-out."</p>

  <p>"I was ordered to send for you, my Marie." His French was pure if
  guttural.</p>

  <p>"Ordered!" An adorable look of amazement came on her face. "And you liked
  not this order, my Fritz. But why? It is not right for me to be here, I know;
  but now that I have come, it is very nice, <i>mon ami</i>. Why do you look so
  glum?"</p>

  <p>For a while he did not reply, but paced the dug-out with long, uneven
  steps. And the Kid, watching his lady of the jasmine, saw her bite her lips,
  as a look of puzzled fear came into her great round eyes. At last the man
  paused in front of her and took her roughly by the arms, so that she cried
  out.</p>

  <p>"You love me, Marie?" he demanded hoarsely. "You love me enough to marry
  me when this accursed war is over?" His voice sank over the last few words,
  and he glanced, half fearfully, at the curtained door.</p>

  <p>"But of course, my Fritz," she answered softly. "You have been good to me,
  and you are different to these others. Mon Dieu! they frighten me&mdash;those
  harsh, brutal men; but they have been good to me and the little mother for
  your sake. It is terrible, I suppose&mdash;a French girl and a German
  officer; but the little god Love, <i>mon ami</i>, he laughs at the great god
  Mars&mdash;sometimes. Poor little me&mdash;I cannot help myself." She laughed
  adorably, and the Kid laughed with her. She seemed to him like the spirit of
  the Spring, when the bluebells are flowering and the world is young. But on
  the German's face there was no answering smile. It was set and stern, and
  imprinted with a look of such utter hopelessness that the Kid, who saw it
  over the girl's shoulder, almost cried out with the pain of it.</p>

  <p>"Do you love me enough, Marie," he went on at length, "to do a big thing
  for me&mdash;a very big thing?"</p>

  <p>"That depends on what it is." She spoke gaily, but the Kid could see her
  body stiffen slightly. "I'm no good at big things."</p>

  <p>"Will you go to Paris for me?" His voice was dull and jerky.</p>

  <p>"Paris!" She gazed at him in amazement. "But how, and why?"</p>

  <p>"It will be easy to get you there." He seized on the part of her question
  which postponed for a few seconds the hideous thing he was to ask her. "We
  can arrange all that quite easily. You see&mdash;" He rambled on with the
  method of making plans for the journey, until he caught her eyes, and the
  look in them made his faltering words die away to a dreadful silence.</p>

  <p>"And why do you want me to go to Paris, Fritz?" Her voice was hardly above
  a whisper.</p>

  <p>Twice he essayed to speak; twice he failed to do more than falter her
  name. Then with a gasping cry he took her in his arms and kissed her
  passionately. "They shan't," he muttered; "by God! they shan't." And it was
  as the Kid watched the scene, with parted lips and quickened breath, that the
  curtain moved aside, and he saw the Colonel, like an evil spirit, regarding
  the pair with cold malevolence.</p>

  <p>"Delightful!" he remarked after a few moments of cynical observation;
  "delightful! Lieutenant Rutter, you are to be congratulated.
  Mademoiselle&mdash;you are charming; all that my young friend has said, and
  more."</p>

  <p>He moved forward and stood by the table, while Marie&mdash;her face as
  white as death&mdash;clung to her lover. "Who is he, Fritz, this ugly old
  man?" she whispered terrified.</p>

  <p>"Permit me to introduce to you..." Fritz forced the words from his dry
  lips, only to stop at the upraised hand of the other.</p>

  <p>"My name, dear young lady, is immaterial," he remarked genially. "Just an
  ugly old man, who has had no time to bask in the sunshine of the smiles of
  your charming sex." He sat down and lit a cigar. "So you are going to become
  a German's wife! Ah, Fritz, my boy, you're a lucky dog! You'll have to guard
  your Marie carefully from the rest of the garrison, when we have finally won
  and the war is over." He gave a grating laugh, and blew out a cloud of
  smoke.</p>

  <p>"What do you want of me?" asked Marie, in a terrified whisper, looking at
  him like a bird at a snake.</p>

  <p>"A little service, my dear young Frõulein to be&mdash;a little service to
  the Fatherland. You must not forget that Germany is now your country in
  spirit, if not in actual truth. You are pledged to her just as you are
  pledged to your Fritz&mdash;in fact, he being an officer, the two are one and
  the same thing." He smiled again, and waved his cigar gently in the air. "And
  not only will your service benefit the country that you have chosen as your
  own, but it will benefit you, because it will bring the end of the war, and
  with it your marriage, closer."</p>

  <p>He paused to let the words sink in, but she still watched him
  fascinated.</p>

  <p>"One thing more." His eyes gleamed dully through the haze of smoke as he
  fixed them on her. "Unless this little service is fulfilled, though it won't
  make any difference to the ultimate result as far as Germany is concerned, it
  will make a very considerable difference as far as you
  and&mdash;er&mdash;Fritz are concerned."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" The girl hardly breathed the words.</p>

  <p>"I mean that there will be no marriage. Painful&mdash;but true."</p>

  <p>The Kid watched the young officer's arm tighten convulsively round her
  waist&mdash;and began to see red. Then the harsh guttural voice continued.
  "Well, now, without wasting any more time, let us come to the point. I had
  proposed to let Lieutenant Rutter explain things to you;
  but&mdash;er&mdash;from one or two things I overheard, it struck me he might
  not make them clear." The beady eyes came slowly round to the Lieutenant.
  "That is why I interrupted." Once again he stared at the trembling girl. "To
  be brief, Mademoiselle Marie, we anticipate an attack&mdash;a big
  attack&mdash; by the English. We have good information that it is coming in
  this neighbourhood."</p>

  <p>The Kid pricked up his ears; what the devil was the man talking about? "We
  have every reason to hope that Ovillers, Fricourt, Thiepval are impregnable;
  at the same time&mdash;in war&mdash;one never leaves things to chance." The
  Kid's astonishment turned to stupefaction; he himself had been in the
  storming of Ovillers. "And the chance," continued the imperturbable voice,
  "in this matter is the probable action of the French&mdash;your charming
  compatriots&mdash;er&mdash;compatriots, <i>that were</i>, Frõulein. We
  anticipate this offensive in about a month or six weeks; and the matter on
  which we require all the confirmation we can is whether the French, after
  their hideous losses at Verdun, can play any important part in this operation
  of the enemy. That is where you can help us."</p>

  <p>For a moment there was dead silence, and then the girl turned her stricken
  face to the man beside her. "Dear God!" she muttered, "is this why you made
  love to me? To make me a spy?"</p>

  <p>"Marie&mdash;no, on my honour; I swear it!" Forgetful of the man sitting
  at the table Fritz stretched out his hand in an agony of supplication.</p>

  <p>"Lieutenant Rutter." With a snarl the Colonel stood up. "You forget
  yourself. I am speaking. A truce to this fooling. Mademoiselle"&mdash;he
  turned again on the girl&mdash;"we have other things to do beside babble of
  love. Call it spying if you will, but we want information, and you can help
  us to get it&mdash;<i>must</i> help us to get it."</p>

  <p>"And what if I refuse?" Superbly she confronted him; her voice had come
  back; her head was thrown up.</p>

  <p>"In the first place you will not marry Lieutenant Rutter; and in the
  second place&mdash;have you heard that the Comte de St. Jean was taken
  prisoner at Verdun?"</p>

  <p>"Philippe. Oh, monsieur, where is he?" The girl threw herself on her knees
  before him. "I implore you&mdash;he is my only brother."</p>

  <p>"Indeed. Well, if you ever desire to see him again you will carry out my
  suggestion. Otherwise&mdash;" he paused significantly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you could not! You could not be so cruel, so vile as to harm him if
  he is a prisoner. It would break my mother's heart."</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle, there is nothing which I would scruple to do&mdash;
  nothing&mdash;if by so doing I advanced the glorious cause of our
  Fatherland." The man's small eyes gleamed with the fire of a fanatic;
  revolting though he was, yet was there an element of grandeur about him. Even
  the Kid, watching silently from the bed, felt conscious of the power which
  seemed to spring from him as he stood there, squat and repulsive, with the
  lovely French girl kneeling at his feet. He saw her throw her arms around his
  knees, and turn up her face to his in an agony of pleading; and then of a
  sudden came the tragedy.</p>

  <p>Discipline or no discipline, a man is a man, and Fritz Rutter had reached
  the breaking-point. Perhaps it was the sight of the woman he loved kneeling
  at the feet of one of the grossest sensualists in Europe, perhaps&mdash;But
  who knows?</p>

  <p>"Marie," he cried hoarsely, "it's not true. Philippe is dead; they cannot
  hurt him now. Get up, my dear, get up." With folded arms he faced the other
  man as the girl staggered to her feet. Heedless of the blazing passion on the
  Colonel's face, she crept to Fritz and hid her face against his chest. And as
  she stood there she heard the voice of her tormentor, thick and twisted with
  hate.</p>

  <p>"For that, Lieutenant Rutter, I will have you disgraced. And then I will
  look after your Marie. Orderly!" His voice rose to a shout as he strode to
  the door.</p>

  <p>"Good-bye, my love." Fritz strained her to him, and the Kid saw her kiss
  him once on the lips. Then she disengaged herself from his arms, and walked
  steadily to where the Colonel still shouted up the entrance. Outside there
  was the sound of many footsteps, and the girl paused just behind the cursing
  maniac in the door.</p>

  <p>"So you will look after me, will you, monsieur?" Her voice rose clear
  above the noise, and the man turned round, his malignant face quivering. The
  Kid watched it fascinated, and suddenly he saw it change. "I think not," went
  on the same clear voice; and the guttural cry of fear rang out simultaneously
  with the sharp crack of a revolver.</p>

  <p>"My God!" Rutter stood watching the crumpling figure as it slipped to the
  ground in front of the girl; and then with a great cry he sprang forward. And
  with that cry, which seemed to ring through his brain, there came the power
  of movement to the Kid. He hurled himself off the bed towards the
  girl&mdash;his girl&mdash;his lady of the jasmine. But he was too late. The
  second shot was even truer than the first, and as her head hit the floor she
  was dead.</p>

  <p>Regardless of Rutter the Kid knelt down beside her, and as he did so, he
  got it&mdash;in the face.</p>

  <p>"What the blazes are you doing?" roared an infuriated voice. "Damn you!
  you young fool&mdash;you've nearly killed me."</p>

  <p>Stupefied the boy looked around. The same dug-out; the same officers of B
  company; the same beer bottles; but where was the lady of the jasmine? Where
  was the man who lay dead in the doorway? Where was Rutter?</p>

  <p>He blinked foolishly, and looked round to find the lamp still burning and
  his brother officers roaring with laughter. All, that is, except the Doctor
  on whose stomach he had apparently landed.</p>

  <p>But the Kid was not to be put off by laughter. "I tell you it happened in
  this very dug-out," he cried excitedly. "She killed the swine in the doorway
  there, and then she killed herself. This is where she fell, Doc, just where
  you're lying, and her head hit the wall there. Look, there's a board there,
  nailed over the wall&mdash;where her head went. Don't laugh, you fool! don't
  laugh&mdash;it happened. I dreamed it. I know that now; but it happened for
  all that&mdash;before the big advance. I tell you she had light golden
  hair&mdash;ah! look." The Doctor had prised off the board, and there on the
  wall an ominous red stain showed dull in the candlelight. Slowly the Doctor
  bent down and picked up something with his fingers. Getting up he laid it on
  the table. And when the officers of B Company had looked at it, the laughter
  ceased. It was a little wisp of light golden hair&mdash;and the end was thick
  and clotted.</p>

  <p>"Tomorrow, Kid, you can tell us the yarn," said the Doctor quietly. "Just
  now you're going to have a quarter-grain of sleep dope and go to bed
  again."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The following evening the officers of B Company, less the
  Kid, who was out, sat round the table and talked.</p>

  <p>"What do you make of it, Doc?" asked the Company Commander. "Do you really
  think there is anything in the Kid's yarn? I mean, we know he dreamed
  it&mdash;but do you think it's true? I suppose that tired as he was he would
  be in a receptive mood for his imagination to run riot."</p>

  <p>For a long while the Doctor puffed stolidly at his pipe without answering.
  Then he leaned forward and put his hand in his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Imagination, you say. Do you call that imagination?" He produced the lock
  of hair from a matchbox. "Further, do you call that imagination? I found it
  under the pillow this morning." On the table beside the match-box he placed a
  small pocket handkerchief, and from it there came the faint, elusive scent of
  jasmine. "And last of all, do you call that imagination? I found it in one of
  the books yonder." He placed an old envelope in front of him, and the others
  crowded round. It was addressed to Ober-Lieutenant Fritz Rutter.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap206"
     name="chap206">VI. &mdash; MORPHIA</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The man stirred uneasily, and a faint moan came from his
  lips. A numbness seemed to envelop his body from the waist downwards, and in
  the intervals of a stabbing pain in his head, he seemed to hear people
  whispering near by. A figure passed close to him, the figure of a girl with
  fair hair, in a grey dress&mdash;the figure of a girl like Molly. A red-hot
  iron stabbed his brain; his teeth clenched on his lips; he fought with all
  his will, but once again he moaned; he couldn't help it&mdash;it was
  involuntary. The girl stopped and came towards him; she was speaking to him,
  for he heard her voice. But what was she saying? Why did she speak so
  indistinctly? Why&mdash; ah, but her hand on his forehead was cool. It seemed
  to quiet those raging devils in his head; it helped him, as Molly always
  helped him. It seemed to&mdash; why, surely, it must be Molly herself, with
  her dear, soft touch, and her lips ready to kiss, and the sweet smell of her
  hair mounting to his brain like wine. Something pricked his arm: something
  that felt like the needle of a syringe; something that... But anyway, what
  the deuce was she doing? Then suddenly he recalled that pin at the back of
  her dress, where he'd pricked his wrist so badly the first time he'd kissed
  her.</p>

  <p>He laughed gently at the remembrance; and the hand on his forehead
  trembled. For laughter to be a pleasant thing to hear it is essential that
  the person who laughs should be in full possession of&mdash;well, it is
  better, at any rate, that his head should not have been hit by a bomb,
  especially if it was his lower jaw that bore the brunt.</p>

  <p>"What are you trembling for, Molly?" The voice was tender. "The pain has
  quite gone&mdash;I must have had a touch of the sun."</p>

  <p>But for a question to be answered it must be audible; and the girl whose
  hand was on his forehead heard no words. Merely was there a great and
  wonderful pity in her eyes, for the remnant&mdash;the torn-up
  remnant&mdash;who had fought and suffered for her. And the remnant, well, he
  was way back in the Land of Has-been. Did I not say that the pin was at the
  back of Molly's waist?</p>

  <p>The woods were just at their best, with the glorious yellow and brown of
  early autumn, touched with the gold of the setting sun. In a clearing a boy
  was sitting on a fallen tree-trunk, puffing furiously at a cigarette. Twice
  had the smoke gone the wrong way, and once had it got into his eyes; but when
  one is aged sixteen such trifles are merely there to be overcome. The
  annoying thing was that he was still engaged in absorbing the overflowing
  moisture from his eyes, with a handkerchief of doubtful cleanliness, when a
  girl came into the glade and started to laugh.</p>

  <p>"There's no good pretending, Billy. The smoke has got into your eyes, and
  your handkerchief is dirty, and you aren't impressing me in the
  slightest."</p>

  <p>"Hallo, Molly! I wasn't expecting you so soon." The smoker looked a little
  sheepish.</p>

  <p>"Indeed! Then if I'm not wanted, I'll go away again."</p>

  <p>"No, no, Molly&mdash;don't do that." The boy rose eagerly, and went
  towards her. Then he stopped awkwardly, and putting his hands in his pocket,
  fidgeted with his feet.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;why not?" The girl smiled provokingly. "And what are you
  hopping about for? Are you going to try to learn to dance, as I
  suggested?"</p>

  <p>"I will if you will teach me, Molly&mdash;dear." He took a step forward
  eagerly&mdash;and then paused again, aghast at the audacity of that "dear."
  Something in the cool, fresh young girl standing so easily in front of him,
  smiling with faint derision, seemed to knock on the head all that carefully
  thought out plan which had matured in his mind during the silent watches of
  the previous night. It had all seemed so easy then. Johnson major's
  philosophy on life in general and girls in particular was one thing in the
  abstract, and quite another when viewed in the concrete, with a real, live
  specimen to practice on. And yet Johnson major was a man of much
  experience&mdash; and a prefect of some standing at school.</p>

  <p>"My dear fellows," he had said on one occasion when holding the floor in
  his study, "I don't want to brag, and <i>we</i> do not speak about these
  things." The accent on the <i>we</i> had been wonderful. It implied
  membership of that great body of youthful dare-devils to whom the wiles of
  women present no terrors. "But women, my dear fellows, why&mdash;good lord,
  there's nothing in it when one knows the way to manage them. They adore being
  kissed&mdash;provided it's done the right way. And if you don't know the
  right way instinctively, it comes with practice, old boy, it comes with
  practice." Billy had listened in awe, though preserving sufficient presence
  of mind to agree with the speaker in words of suitable nonchalance.</p>

  <p>Of course, Johnson major must have been right; but, devil take it, there
  seemed remarkably little instinct available at the present moment; and up to
  date in Billy's career, practice in the proper procedure had been conspicuous
  by its absence.</p>

  <p>"I think you're rather dull today." The girl was speaking again, and there
  was more than a hint of laughter in her voice. "What's the matter with you?
  Has that cigarette made you feel sick?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly not. I&mdash;er&mdash;oh, Molly, I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The desperate words trembled on his lips&mdash;trembled and died away
  under the laughter in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Yes?" she murmured inquiringly. "What is it, Billy?"</p>

  <p>Oh, woman, woman! Just sixteen, but at two you have learned the beginnings
  of the book of Eve.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;er&mdash;I&mdash;oh, dash it, let's go for a walk!" With a gasp
  of relief he swung on his heel; the fatal plunge had been put off for a
  little; he hadn't made a fool of himself&mdash;yet, at any rate. "Do you mind
  if I smoke?"</p>

  <p>"Not if you don't." The girl was walking demurely beside him, down the
  narrow lane carpeted with its first layers of auburn brown. "Are you sure
  it's wise? Two so close together might not be good for you."</p>

  <p>Two close together&mdash;not good for him! Absurd; it was nothing to what
  he was accustomed to, and yet&mdash;why, his head was throbbing, throbbing as
  he looked at the girl beside him? What was that distant noise like the slow
  beating of a mighty drum, that seemed to quiver and vibrate in the air till
  it filled his brain with a great rush of sound, and then sobbed away into
  silence? What was the matter with his right hand that it burned and twitched
  so ceaselessly? Surely he hadn't burnt himself with the cigarette! He looked
  down to see, but somehow things were indistinct. It almost seemed as if he
  hadn't got a hand; the woods were hazy&mdash;Molly seemed far away. In her
  place was a man, a man with a stubby growth on his chin, a man who bent over
  him and muttered something.</p>

  <p>"Gawd, Ginger, the poor devil ain't dead neither! Lift him up carefully.
  There's his right arm over there, and his back&mdash;Oh, my gawd! Poor
  devil!"</p>

  <p>Thus had the battalion stretcher-bearers found him the day before....</p>

  <p>The man became irritable.</p>

  <p>"Go away at once! Can't you see I'm with a lady. Molly, dear, where are
  you? What is this dirty-looking fellow doing here at all?"</p>

  <p>But Molly for the moment seemed aloof. He saw her there, standing in the
  path in front of him&mdash;so close and yet somehow so curiously far
  away.</p>

  <p>"Molly, do you hear that noise&mdash;that strange beating in the air? I
  think I'm going to be ill. Perhaps two close together are too much."</p>

  <p>But no&mdash;apparently not. Suddenly everything was clear again, and
  there was Molly with the autumn wind blowing the soft tendrils of hair back
  from the nape of her neck; Molly, with the skirt that betokens the half-way
  period between flapperhood and coming out; Molly, with her lithe young figure
  half turned from him as she watched the sun sinking over the distant
  hills.</p>

  <p>"They adore being kissed." The words of the wonderful Johnson major were
  ringing in his brain as he watched her, and suddenly something surged up
  within him. What matter rules and theories? What matter practice? There is
  only one way to kiss a girl, and rules and theories avail not one jot. With a
  quick step he had her in his arms, and, with his pulses hammering with the
  wonder of it, he watched her face come round to his. He kissed her cheek, her
  eyes, her mouth&mdash;shyly at first, and then with gathering confidence as a
  boy should kiss a girl.</p>

  <p>The sweetness of it, the newness of it, the eternal joy of a woman in a
  man's arms for the first time! Surely it had never been quite like that with
  any one else before. Of course, other people kissed, but&mdash;this was
  different. Suddenly the girl disengaged her arms and wound them gently round
  his neck. She pulled his head towards her, and kissed him again and again,
  while he felt her heart beating against his coat.</p>

  <p>"Billy, my dear!"</p>

  <p>Almost he missed the whispered words coming faintly from somewhere in the
  neighbourhood of his tie.</p>

  <p>"Molly&mdash;Molly, darling&mdash;I love you!"</p>

  <p>The boy's voice was shaky, his grip almost crushed her.</p>

  <p>"Do you, Billy? I'm so glad! I want you to love me, because&mdash;
  because&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She looked at him shyly.</p>

  <p>"Say it, sweetheart, say it." He held her at arm's-length&mdash;no longer
  bashful, no longer wondering whether he dared; but insistent, imperious, a
  young god for the moment. "Because what?"</p>

  <p>"Because I love you too, you darling!"</p>

  <p>Once again she was in his arms, once again did time cease, while the
  lengthening shadows stole softly towards them; and a squirrel, emboldened by
  their stillness, watched for a while with indulgent eyes.</p>

  <p>At last the girl gently turned away, and the boy's arms fell to his
  side.</p>

  <p>"Molly, you've got a pin in your waistband. Look, you've pricked my
  wrist."</p>

  <p>"Billy, my dear, let me do it up. Why didn't you tell me, you poor old
  boy?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't notice it, I didn't even feel it, you darling."</p>

  <p>The boy laughed gladly as she bound his handkerchief round the wounded
  arm; and, bending forward, kissed her neck, just where the hair left it, just
  where&mdash;but what had happened? Where was she? She had gone, the trees had
  gone, the sun had set, and it was dark, terribly dark.</p>

  <p>Once again that mighty drum beat close by, and voices came dimly through a
  haze to the man's brain. Some one was touching him, a finger was probing
  gently over his head, a sentence came to him as if from a vast distance.</p>

  <p>"Good God! Poor devil! If we have to go we must leave him. Any movement
  would kill him at once."</p>

  <p>"I won't have you touching the bandage that Molly has put on!" said the
  man angrily. "My wrist will be quite all right; it's absurd to make a fuss
  about a pin-prick."</p>

  <p>And perhaps because there are sounds to which no man can listen unmoved,
  the quiet-faced doctor drew out his hypodermic syringe. The girl with the
  grey dress, her steps lagging a little with utter physical weariness, paused
  at the foot of his bed, and waited with an encouraging smile.</p>

  <p>"Molly," he cried eagerly, "come and talk to me! I've been dreaming about
  you."</p>

  <p>But she merely continued to smile at him, though in her eyes there was the
  sadness of a divine pity. Then once again something pricked his arm. A great
  silence seemed to come down on him like a pall, a silence that was tangible,
  in which strange faces passed before him in a jumbled procession. They seemed
  to swing past like fishes drifting across the glass window of an
  aquarium&mdash;ghostly, mysterious, and yet very real. A man in a dirty grey
  uniform, with a bloodstained bandage round his forehead, who leered at him;
  Chilcote, his company commander, who seemed to be shouting and cheering and
  waving his arm; a sergeant of his platoon, with a grim smile on his face, who
  held a rifle with a fixed bayonet that dripped.</p>

  <p>"All right, Chilcote," he shouted, "we'll have the swine out in a
  minute!"</p>

  <p>But Chilcote had gone, and through the silence came a muffled roar.</p>

  <p>"The drum again!" he muttered irritably. "What the devil is the good of
  trying to surprise the Huns if we have the band with us! You don't want a
  band when you're attacking a village! A band is for marching to, and dancing,
  not for fighting." Of course, if it was going to continue playing, they might
  just as well have a dance, and be done with it. He laughed a little. "You've
  had too much champagne for supper, my boy," he soliloquised. "What do you
  mean by 'might as well have a dance'? Can't you see that awe-inspiring
  gentleman in the red coat is on the point of striking up now?" He looked
  across the room, a room that seemed a trifle hazy, and thought hard. Surely
  he hadn't had too much to drink, and yet the people were so vague and unreal?
  And why the deuce did a ballroom band have a big drum? He gave it up after a
  moment, and silently watched the scene.</p>

  <p>He remembered now quite clearly, and with an amused laugh at his momentary
  forgetfulness, he looked at his programme. The third supper extra was just
  beginning, and two dances after that he had four in succession with
  Molly&mdash;the fateful hour when he had determined to try his luck.</p>

  <p>At present she was having supper with a nasty-looking man, with long hair
  and an eyeglass, who was reputed to be a rising politician, in the running
  for an under-secretaryship, and was also reputed to be in love with Molly. He
  looked savagely round the room, and, having failed to discover them, he
  strolled to the bar to get a drink.</p>

  <p>"Hallo, Billy; not dancing? She loves me; she loves me not! Cheer up,
  dearie!"</p>

  <p>An inane-looking ass raised his whisky-and-soda to his lips with a fatuous
  cackle.</p>

  <p>"I wonder they don't have a home for people like you, Jackson," remarked
  Billy curtly. "Whisky-and-soda, please."</p>

  <p>He gave his order to the waiter and lit a cigarette. He hardly heard what
  the irrepressible Jackson was saying, but allowed him to babble on in peace
  while his thoughts centred on Molly. How absolutely sweet she was looking in
  that shimmering, gauzy stuff that just went with her hair, and showed off her
  figure to perfection! If only she said "yes," he'd arrange the party going
  back in the cars so that he got her alone in the two-seater. If only&mdash;
  good lord, would the dance never come?</p>

  <p>He looked up, and saw her passing into the ball-room with her supper
  partner; and, as he did so, she looked half round and caught his eye. Just a
  second, no more; but on her lips had trembled the faintest suspicion of a
  smile&mdash;a smile that caused his heart to beat madly with hope, a smile
  that said things. He sat back in his chair and the hand that held his glass
  trembled a little.</p>

  <p>"I don't believe you've been listening to me, Billy." The egregious
  Jackson emitted a plaintive wail. "I don't believe you've heard a word I
  said."</p>

  <p>"Perfectly correct in both statements, dear boy!" Billy rose abruptly to
  his feet and smacked him on the back. "One must give up something in Lent,
  you know."</p>

  <p>"But it isn't Lent." Jackson looked aggrieved. "And you've made me spill
  my drink."</p>

  <p>But he spoke to the empty air and a melancholy waiter, for Billy was back
  in the ballroom, waiting....</p>

  <p>"You smiled at me, lady, a while ago," he said softly in her ear, as they
  swung gently through the crowded room. "I thought it was a smile that said
  things. Was thy servant very presumptuous in thus reading his queen's glance?
  Confound you, sir; that's my back!"</p>

  <p>He glared furiously at a bull-necked thruster in a pink coat.</p>

  <p>"Hush, Billy!" laughed the girl, as they lost him in the crowd. "That's
  our master!"</p>

  <p>"I don't care a hang who he is, but he's rammed one of my brace-buttons
  into my spine! He's the sort of man who knocks you down and tramples on your
  face, after supper!"</p>

  <p>For a few moments they continued in silence, perhaps the two best dancers
  in the room, and gradually she seemed to come closer to him, to give herself
  up entirely to him, until, as in a dream, they moved like one being and the
  music softly died away. For a moment the man stood still, pressing the girl
  close to him, and then, with a slight sigh that was almost one of pain, he
  let her go.</p>

  <p>"Are you glad I taught you to dance?" she asked laughingly; while the room
  shouted for an encore.</p>

  <p>"Glad," he whispered, "glad! Ah! my lady, my lady, to dance with you is
  the nearest approach to heaven that we poor mortals may have. For all
  that"&mdash;he steered her swiftly through the expectant couples towards a
  door covered with a curtain&mdash;"I want an answer to a question I asked you
  just before my spine was broken!" He held up the curtain for her to pass
  through, and piloted her to an easy-chair hidden behind some screens in a
  discreetly lighted room. "Did your smile say things, my lady? Did you tell me
  something as you went into the ballroom with that long-haired lawyer?"</p>

  <p>"My dear boy, I wasn't smiling at you! I was smiling at that nice Mr.
  Jackson man."</p>

  <p>"Molly, you're a liar! You know you hate that ass; you told me so yourself
  yesterday!"</p>

  <p>"All the more reason to smile at him. Billy, give me a cigarette." She
  leaned towards him slightly as he offered her his case, and their eyes met.
  Her breath came a little quicker as she read the message blazing out of his,
  and then she looked away again. "And a match, please," she continued
  quietly.</p>

  <p>"Confound the match and the cigarette, too!" His voice was shaking.
  "Molly, Molly, I know I'm mad! I know it's just the height of idiocy from a
  so-called worldly point of view, but I can't help it. I've tried and
  struggled; I've been away for two years and haven't seen you. But, oh! my
  dear, the kisses you gave me when you were a flapper, before you came out,
  before your mother got this bee in her bonnet about some big marriage for
  you&mdash;those kisses are still burning my lips. I can feel them now,
  princess, and the remembrance of 'em drives me mad! I know I'm asking you to
  chuck your mother's ambitions; I know I've got nothing to offer you, except
  the old name, which doesn't count for much these days. But, oh! my lady, I
  just worship the very ground you walk on. Is there just a chance for me? I'd
  simply slave for you, if you'd let me!"</p>

  <p>Through the closed door came stealing the soft music of a waltz, while
  from another corner came the sound of a whispered tête-à-tête. Very still
  was the girl as she sat in the big arm-chair, with the man pleading
  passionately at her side. Once she caught her breath quickly when he recalled
  the time gone by&mdash;the time before her mother's political ambitions had
  ruthlessly waged war on her, and done their best to drive Nature out of her
  outlook on life; and, when he had finished speaking, she gave a little tired
  smile.</p>

  <p>"Billy boy," she whispered, "is that how you've felt about it all this
  while?"</p>

  <p>He made no answer, but, stretching out his hands, he took hold of her two
  wrists.</p>

  <p>"You've really remembered those kisses when we were kids?" she went on
  softly.</p>

  <p>"Remembered them? Dear heavens, my lady, I wouldn't lose that remembrance
  for untold wealth! It's been with me in Alaska; it's been with me in Hong
  Kong. I've woken up at nights with the feel of your lips on mine, and all the
  glory of you, and the sweetness; and it's helped me on when everything was
  black, and made things bright when the world was rotten!" With a bitter sigh
  he took his hands away and sat back in his chair. "And I've failed! Jove! the
  wild schemes and the plans, the golden visions and the Eldorados&mdash;all
  failed. Just a little money, just enough to have a burst in England, just
  enough to be able to see you. And then it slipped out. Lady, dear, I never
  meant to before I came to the Towers. I knew you were there, but I never
  meant to ask you. Wash it out, my princess; wash it out! I haven't said a
  word. You've been teaching me a new step; let's go back and dance. I've been
  mad this evening, and, unless we go back and dance, I can't guarantee
  remaining sane!"</p>

  <p>But the girl made no move. With parted lips she swayed towards him, while
  he watched her, with the veins standing out on his forehead. "Billy&mdash;I
  don't care; I'm mad, too!" The scent she used was mounting to his
  brain&mdash;the nearness of her was driving him mad.</p>

  <p>"Molly, get back to that ballroom; get back quick, or&mdash;" He spoke
  through his clenched teeth.</p>

  <p>"Or what, Billy boy?" She smiled deliciously.</p>

  <p>And then he kissed her: a kiss that seemed to draw her soul to her lips: a
  kiss that lifted him until he travelled through endless spaces in a great
  aching void where time and distance ceased, and nothing happened save a
  wonderful ecstasy, and ever and anon the mighty booming of a giant drum.</p>

  <p>He seemed to be treading on air, and though the ballroom had vanished, and
  the discreet apartment with shaded lights had faded away, yet he was very
  conscious of the nearness of his girl. But just now, he could not see
  her&mdash;she eluded him, leaving an ever-present feeling that she would be
  waiting for him round the next of those intangible masses he seemed to be
  drifting through.</p>

  <p>"You don't mind waiting, my princess?" he murmured ceaselessly. "After
  this war it will all come right. Just now I've got to go&mdash;I must go out
  there; but afterwards, it will all come right&mdash;and we'll live in a house
  in the country and grow cabbages and pigs. You'll wait, you say? Ah! my dear,
  my dear; it's sweet of you; but perhaps you ought to have married the lawyer
  man. You might have been Mrs. Prime Minister one of these days."</p>

  <p>For a while the tired brain refused to act; the man felt himself falling
  into unplumbed depths&mdash;depths which echoed with monstrous
  reverberations.</p>

  <p>"Molly, where are you, dear? It's cold, and my head is throbbing to beat
  the band. If only that cursed drum would stop! Do you hear it echoing through
  the air? And the noise hurts&mdash;hurts like hell, Molly. Ah! Heaven, but
  it's cold; and I can't see you, my lady; I don't know where you are."</p>

  <p>Once again he became conscious of figures moving around him. They seemed
  to be carrying motionless men past his feet&mdash;men on stretchers covered
  with blankets. With staring eyes he watched the proceeding, trying to
  understand what was happening. In front of him was a window in which the
  glass had been smashed, leaving great jagged pieces sticking out from the
  sides of the frame. He wondered vaguely why it had been left in such a
  dangerous condition; when he and Molly had their house such a thing would
  never be allowed to happen&mdash;if it did it would be mended at once. He
  asked one of the passing figures what had caused the damage, and when he got
  no answer he angrily repeated the question.</p>

  <p>He fretted irritably because no one seemed to take any notice of him, and
  suddenly his head began throbbing worse than ever. But the hazy
  indistinctness was gone; the man was acutely conscious of everything around
  him. Memory had come back, and he knew where he was and why he was there. He
  remembered the fierce artillery bombardment; he recalled getting over the
  parapet, out on to the brown shell-pocked earth, sodden and heavy with the
  drenching rain; he recalled the steady shamble over the ground with boots so
  coated with wet mud that they seemed to drag him back. Then clear in his mind
  came the picture of Chilcote cheering, shouting, lifting them on to the ruins
  of what once had been a village; he saw Chilcote falter, stop, and, with a
  curious spinning movement, crash forward on to his face; he saw the
  Germans&mdash;he saw fierce-faced men like animals at bay, snarling,
  fighting; he heard once again that trembling cry of "<i>Kamerade</i>"; and
  then&mdash;a blank. The amazing thing was that it was all jumbled up with
  Molly. He seemed to have been with her lately&mdash;and yet she couldn't have
  been out there with him. He puzzled a bit, and then gave it up: it hurt his
  head so terribly to think. He just lay still, gazing fixedly at the jagged,
  torn pane of glass....</p>

  <p>"They are all out, Doctor, except this one."</p>

  <p>A woman was speaking close beside him, and his eyes slowly travelled round
  in the direction of the voice. It was another woman&mdash;a woman he hadn't
  seen before&mdash;swaying slightly as if she would drop.</p>

  <p>"Good heavens! it's Billy Saunders!"</p>

  <p>A man in khaki was bending over him&mdash;a man whom he recognised as a
  civilian doctor he'd known at home&mdash;a man, moreover, who knew Molly.</p>

  <p>"Do you know me, old chap?"</p>

  <p>"Of course," answered the man. "What's all the trouble?"</p>

  <p>The doctor bit his lip, and the man noticed his hand clench hard. Then
  there started a low-voiced conversation, a conversation to which he listened
  attentively&mdash;his hearing seemed abnormally acute.</p>

  <p>"Has he spoken since he's been in, sister?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;only those dreadful moans. The whole of his face&mdash;
  absolutely hopeless&mdash;spinal cord."</p>

  <p>The man lying motionless caught the disjointed words. What did they mean?
  They were mad&mdash;insane. Dying? He&mdash;Billy Saunders! What about
  Molly&mdash;his Molly? What about.... Gentle fingers once again touched his
  head, and, looking up, he saw the doctor's eyes fixed on his.</p>

  <p>"They're shelling the hospital, dear old man; we've got to get&mdash;Great
  Scott, look out!"</p>

  <p>Like the moan of a giant insect, the shrill whine came through the air,
  rising to an overwhelming scream. There was a deafening crash&mdash;a great
  hole was torn in the wall just by the window with the jagged pane, and the
  room filled with stifling black fumes. A sudden agonising stab, and the man,
  looking up, saw Molly in front of him. She was standing in the acrid
  smoke&mdash; beckoning.</p>

  <p>"I'm coming, dear, I'm coming!" he cried; "it's good of you to have
  waited, girl of mine&mdash;so good."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"Are you hurt, sister?" The doctor, who had been crouching
  by the bed, stood up.</p>

  <p>"Not touched, thank you." She was white and shaking. "Did you hear the
  bits whizzing through the room?"</p>

  <p>"I did," remarked the doctor grimly, holding out an arm from which the
  blood already dripped. "And I felt one of them too. But there's no time to
  lose&mdash;I don't know what to do about him, poor old chap."</p>

  <p>He turned once again to the bed, and even as he turned he knew that the
  decision had been made for him: and he thanked the Maker. Billy Saunders had
  also felt a bit&mdash;a jagged bit&mdash;through the heart.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap207"
     name="chap207">VII. &mdash; BENDIGO JONES&mdash;HIS TREE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">My story&mdash;such as it is&mdash;concerns a camouflage
  tree and Bendigo Jones: both of which&mdash;or whom&mdash;will require a
  little more introduction. That Bendigo would indignantly repudiate any such
  necessity, I am fully aware; nevertheless, even at the risk of offending him,
  I propose to outline briefly his claims to greatness, before embarking on the
  incident in his military career which forms the subject of these pages.</p>

  <p>First however&mdash;the camouflage tree. It is only meet that the material
  and sordid details of the stage properties should be given, before branching
  into any discussion of the capabilities of the actor. The phrase, then, does
  not imply&mdash;as the ignorant might possibly be led to believe&mdash;a new
  type of tree. It does not grow in the tropics amongst a riotous tangle of
  pungent undergrowth; it does not creak sadly in the north wind on the open
  hill. It shelters not the hibiscus anthropoid, it gives not lodging to the
  two-tailed newt. From a botanical point of view, the tree is a complete and
  utter frost. It is, in point of hard and bitter fact, not a tree at all.</p>

  <p>"Camouflage" is that which conceals: it is a fraud, and speaketh not the
  truth. I am not even certain whether it is a noun or a preposition, but the
  point is immaterial. Along with other canons of military matters, its virtue
  lies in its application rather than in its etymology. What the eye doth not
  see the trench mortars do not trouble is as true today as when Noah first
  mentioned the fact; and camouflage is the application of this mighty
  dictum.</p>

  <p>The value of any particular piece of camouflage depends entirely on its
  capability for deceit; but to the youthful enthusiast I would speak a word of
  warning. I have in mind the particular case of young Angus MacTaggart, a lad
  from Glasgow, with freckles and a sunny disposition. He was a sapper by
  trade, and on his shoulders there devolved, on one occasion, the job of
  covering a trench mortar emplacement with a camouflage of wire and grass
  which would screen the hole in which sat the mortar from the prying gaze of
  Hun aeroplanes. It was a deep hole, for the mortar was large; and the screen
  of wire was fastened to a framework of wood. When the gun wished to do its
  morning hate, a pessimistic individual first scoured the heavens with his
  glasses in search of Hun planes. If the scouring revealed nothing, the screen
  was lowered, and the gun was made ready. Then the detachment faded away, and
  the gun was fired by a man of great personal bravery by means of a long
  string. Ever since the first trench mortars, which consisted of a piece of
  piping down which a jam-tin bomb was dropped, in the hopes that when the
  charge at the bottom was lighted, the bomb would again emerge, I have
  regarded trench mortars as dangerous and unpleasant objects, and the people
  who deal with them as persons of a high order of courage. One remembers the
  times when the bomb did not emerge, but stuck half way and exploded
  violently; one remembers when the entire gun fell over and propelled the bomb
  in the direction of battalion headquarters; above all, one remembers the
  loathing and contumely with which the mere arrival of the trench mortar in
  any part of the trenches was greeted. Then there was no attempt at
  camouflage; one's sole endeavour was to avoid being killed by the beastly
  thing.</p>

  <p>To return, however, to Angus. Though of a sunny disposition, as I have
  said, he was a somewhat earnest individual&mdash;and thorough withal. He
  determined that as a camouflage, <i>his</i> should stand pre-eminent; it
  should be the model and pattern of all camouflages. He succeeded.</p>

  <p>Labouring at night&mdash;largely with his own fair hands&mdash;he produced
  a screen cunningly woven with grasses and weeds which he swore would defy the
  most lynx-eyed pilot. He even went so far as to place in the centre of it a
  large bunch of nettles, which he contended gave it an air of insouciance and
  lightheartedness that had been lacking before.</p>

  <p>Now, as I mentioned above, the value of camouflage depends on its
  capability for deceit; and it is by this criterion that I claim his work as a
  success. It should be added, however, in no uncertain tones, that it is the
  Germans whom one is desirous of deceiving, and that is where my warning to
  the youthful enthusiast comes in.</p>

  <p>The thing came too quickly for warning. Suddenly from above the
  inhabitants of the hole, with whom Angus was consuming a midday glass of
  port, was heard the voice: "It must be somewhere about here, sir, I think."
  The voice was right&mdash;it was.</p>

  <p>They came through in a phalanx of fire, and descended abruptly on the
  detachment below. It was a magnificent compliment to the work, but it was
  unfortunate that the General should have been the one to consume the nettles.
  However, I have always thought that Angus's voice of disgust as he
  contemplated the wreckage of his screen did not improve matters.</p>

  <p>"The door," he remarked, with painful distinctness, "is full of
  possibilities." With that he left.</p>

  <p>I trust the moral of my digression is obvious.... Having then, in a few
  well-chosen phrases, discussed one type of camouflage, I would pass on and
  lead the thirster for information still farther into the by-paths of
  knowledge. Just as there are many and divers types of deceit, varying from
  that which conceals what is, to that which exposes what is not&mdash;involved
  that last, but think it out&mdash;so are there many types of camouflage. And
  the particular one with which I am concerned, deals with a tree.</p>

  <p>On a certain slight eminence in what was otherwise a flat and dreary
  outlook, there stood the stump of a tree. It was a tired stump, strongly
  reminiscent of the morning after. It had had a hard life, and much of its
  pristine glory had faded. No longer did the sprightly sparrow chirrup
  cheerfully to its young from leafy branches; no longer did cattle recline in
  its shade during the heat of the day. It was just a stump&mdash;a stump
  complete with splinters.</p>

  <p>Its sole claim to notoriety lay in its position. It commanded a view of
  the German lines which was not to be had elsewhere; in fact, from the
  eminence on which it stood you could obtain the only good observation of the
  opposite trenches in that particular sector of the line.</p>

  <p>It was the Brigade Major who first suggested the idea in the fertile brain
  of the C.R.E. of the Division, who happened to be talking to him at the
  moment. They were in the support line trenches, and close to where they
  stood, the tree&mdash;gaunt, repulsive and toothpicky&mdash;raised its
  stunted head to heaven.</p>

  <p>"What a pity that tree ain't hollow!" ruminated the Staff officer
  thoughtfully. "Splendid view from it of the Huns. Can't do anything in that
  line, can you, Colonel?"</p>

  <p>The C.R.E. thoughtfully considered the proposition. "Afraid not, old boy,"
  he answered after a few moments' deliberation. "Bit of a job hollowing out a
  tree. All the same, you're quite right. It would make a great O.P."</p>

  <p>"Why not make another down in your yard, and put it up instead?" The
  Brigadier joined in the discussion. "We must have better observation in this
  sector if we possibly can."</p>

  <p>"Cut this one down one night and put up a dummy in its place." The C.R.E
  once again considered the wretched stump. "Not a bad idea, General; the only
  question is who is to do it. It will have to be a good model, or the Huns
  will spot the difference; and..." Suddenly his face cleared. "By Jove! I've
  got it&mdash;Bendigo Jones. He's the man for the job."</p>

  <p>"And who the deuce is Bendigo Jones?" asked the General, as the Sapper
  rapidly jotted down something in his note-book. "He sounds like a prize
  fighter or the inventor of a patent medicine."</p>

  <p>"Bendigo Jones, General, is my latest acquisition. I have it on no less an
  authority than his own that he is a very remarkable man. I gather that he is
  futurist by inclination, and dyspeptic by nature, which I take to be a more
  or less natural sequence of events. At present he adorns my office, and looks
  intense."</p>

  <p>"He sounds rather like a disease," murmured the Brigade Major. "From what
  you say, I gather he considers himself an artist."</p>

  <p>"He sculpts, or whatever a sculptor does when he gets busy." The Colonel
  smiled gently. "How he ever blew out here I cannot imagine, but these things
  will occur. I offended him mortally, I regret to say, the first day he
  arrived, by confessing that I had never even heard his name, much less seen
  his work, but I think he's forgiven me. I allowed him to arrange the timber
  yard today more aesthetically, and the Sergeant-major thinks he is soft in
  the head, so Bendigo is supremely happy."</p>

  <p>"He sounds a perfect treasure," remarked the Brigadier drily. "However, as
  long as he models that tree and we get it up somehow, and I never see him, I
  shall be quite happy, old boy."</p>

  <p>"It shall be done," answered the C.R.E., "by our little Bendy himself. A
  life-size, hollow camouflage stump shall replace the original, complete with
  peephole and seat."</p>

  <p>Thus lightly was settled the immediate future of one of the world's great
  ones. In view, however, of the fact that the world is so often lamentably
  ignorant of greatness, it now becomes necessary for me to carry out my second
  introduction and enlighten the Philistines as to what they have missed by
  their miserable and sordid materialism.</p>

  <p>Be it known then that for several years Bendigo Jones had been in the
  habit of inflicting upon a long-suffering and inoffensive public a series of
  lumps of material. What these lumps were supposed to represent no one has yet
  discovered; and I am given to understand that unless the proud perpetrator
  noted it himself on completion, he too was usually unable to elucidate the
  mystery. It was not of great account, as he ran not the slightest risk of
  contradiction whatever he said; and as no person ever willingly went twice to
  his exhibitions, he could vary the title daily without fear of discovery.
  Another great point about his work was its many-sidedness. A lump looked at
  from one side would perhaps represent "Pelican with young," while on the
  other "The Children's Hour, or six o'clock at Mud View Villa," would be
  depicted. This, needless to say, economised greatly in space and matter; and
  in case any special exhibit failed to arrive in time, or was thrown away by
  mistake, an old one turned upside down at once remedied the defect.</p>

  <p>His nearest approach to fame occurred during the period which followed the
  perpetration of his celebrated "Mother with her Child." It was announced that
  the gifted sculptor had worked on it for five years; and a certain amount of
  light was thrown on his methods by an interview he managed to get published
  in some obscure journal.</p>

  <p>"Rising with a hoarse cry," ran this effusion, "Mr. Bendigo Jones hurled
  himself at his work. With a single blow he removed a protuberance, and then
  sank back exhausted.</p>

  <p>"'You see the difference,' he cried, 'you see how I have altered her
  expression.'</p>

  <p>"'Whose?' I murmured dazedly.</p>

  <p>"'Why, the face of the woman. Ah! dolt, blockhead, have you no
  eyes&mdash;have you no soul?'</p>

  <p>"'But you told me that was a church at sunset,' I remonstrated feebly.</p>

  <p>"'What has that to do with it?' he shouted. 'It is what I like to make it,
  fool. What is a name? Nothing&mdash;a bagatelle. I have changed my mind every
  day for the last five years, and now my life's work is done&mdash; done.'</p>

  <p>"Mr. Bendigo Jones sobbed quietly, and I stole away. It was not for me to
  gaze on such grief. And as I went through the open window I heard his final
  whisper.</p>

  <p>"'It shall be none of these things. I will pander to vile utilitarianism.
  It shall be&mdash;"A City Magnate at Lunch."'"</p>

  <p>It may be remembered that when it was finally put on view in London,
  enormous interest was aroused by an enterprising weekly paper offering prizes
  to the extent of a thousand pounds to any one who could guess what it was;
  and though Bendigo Jones's pocket was helped considerably by his percentage
  of the gate money, his pride suffered considerably when the answers were made
  public. They ranged from, "Model of the first steam engine when out of
  control," to "An explosion of a ship at sea," both of which happy efforts
  gained a bag of nuts. The answer adjudged most nearly correct was sent in by
  a Fulham butcher, who banked on "Angry gentleman quarrelling with his
  landlord on quarter-day": which at any rate had the merit of making it
  human.</p>

  <p>But I have digressed enough; I will return to my sad story. How our friend
  ever did arrive in France is as much of a mystery to me as it was to the
  Colonel; presumably a ruthless government, having decided it required men,
  roped him in along with the other lesser lights. The fiat went forth, and so
  did Bendigo&mdash;mildly protesting: to adorn in the fullness of time the
  office of the C.R.E. of whom I have spoken. And he was sitting there
  exhausted by his labours in helping the Sergeant-major rearrange the timber
  yard aesthetically, when a message arrived that the Colonel wished to speak
  to him.</p>

  <p>"I understand, Jones, that you are a sculptor," remarked that officer
  genially, as our hero entered the office. "Now, can you model a tree?"</p>

  <p>Bendigo gazed dreamily out of the window. "A tree," he murmured at length.
  "A little, beautiful tree. Green with the verdant loveliness of youth...
  green... green."</p>

  <p>"It isn't," snapped the Colonel. "It's brown, and damned hideous, and full
  of splinters."</p>

  <p>"Only to the eye of unbelief, sir." The sculptor regarded him
  compassionately. "To us&mdash;to those who can see things as they ought to
  be&mdash;more, as they spiritually are... it is different."</p>

  <p>A door closed somewhat hastily, and the sounds from the next room seemed
  to indicate that the Adjutant's cough was again troubling him. The Colonel
  however remained calm.</p>

  <p>"I have no doubt, Jones," he remarked dispassionately, "that what you have
  just said has some meaning. It is even remotely possible that you know what
  it means yourself. I don't; and I do not propose to try. I propose, on the
  other hand, to descend to the sordid details of what I wish you to do. You
  will commence without delay." He leaned back in his chair, and proceeded to
  fill his pipe.</p>

  <p>"Up the line there is a tree stump standing on rising ground, which I wish
  you to copy. The model must be sufficiently good to deceive the Germans. It
  will be hollow, and of such a size as will accommodate an observer. The back
  will be hinged. When your model is made, the real tree stump will be removed
  one night and the sham one substituted. Do you follow me?"</p>

  <p>It is more than doubtful if he even heard. A slight attack of dyspepsia
  shook him as the Colonel finished speaking, and he passed his hands twice
  through his hair. "The thought&mdash;the future vista&mdash;is beautiful," he
  murmured. "And think; think of the advertisement. Tomorrow, sir, I will gaze
  upon it, and fashion it in clay. Then I will return and commence the great
  work."</p>

  <p>He faded slowly through the door; and after a long pause the Colonel
  spoke. "I wonder," he remarked thoughtfully to the Adjutant who had returned:
  "I wonder why such things are...."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">I am given to understand that the arrival of Bendigo Jones
  at the scene of his labours the next morning caused such a sensation amongst
  those privileged to witness the spectacle that the entire trench was blocked
  for two hours. To only a chosen band was vouchsafed the actual sight of the
  genius at work; the remainder had to be content with absorbing his remarks as
  they were passed down the expectant line. And it was doubtless unfortunate
  that the Divisional General should have chosen the particular moment when the
  divine fire of genius was at its brightest to visit the support line in
  company with his G.S.O.I. and a galaxy of other bright and shining luminaries
  of the military world.</p>

  <p>"What is the meaning of this extraordinary crush in the trench this
  morning?" he remarked irritably to his Staff officer, as the procession was
  again held up by a knot of interested men.</p>

  <p>"I really don't know, sir," murmured that worthy. "It's most unusual;
  it's..."</p>

  <p>His words were drowned by howls of delighted laughter from round the
  traverse in front, and the next moment a perspiring soldier forced his way
  into the bay where the great ones were temporarily wedged. It was the special
  runner who was carrying the latest gem from the lips of Bendigo&mdash;at work
  a little farther up&mdash;to the expectant and breathless audience.</p>

  <p>"Hay! little sandbag! Ho! little sandbag! 'Ow beautiful hart thou in
  textchah."</p>

  <p>"Go on, Bill. Did the perisher say that?" An incredulous member of the
  group looked doubtful.</p>

  <p>"Did 'e say it?" The carrier of news looked scornfully at the doubter.
  "Did 'e say it? Lumme! 'E said it twice, and then he buried 'is mug in its
  loverly fragrant surface, and pricked his nose on Ginger's bayonet. 'E's mad,
  boys; 'e's as mad as a plurry 'atter; 'e's got bats in 'is belfry."</p>

  <p>Now, in spite of what I know of Bendigo Jones, I must admit that this
  reputed remark taxes even my credulity. Mad he undoubtedly was when viewed by
  the sordid standards of the vandals around him, but this inspiring ode to a
  sandbag grew somewhat, I cannot but help thinking, in the transmission. The
  regrettable thing was that it should have reached this stage when it was
  unwittingly presented to the Divisional General.</p>

  <p>"Gangway!" he roared, as the hilarity remained unabated: "gangway!" He
  elbowed his way through the suddenly silent throng and confronted the special
  runner. "Now, my man, tell me&mdash;what is all this tommy rot about?"</p>

  <p>"Bloke farther up the trenches, sir, wot don't seem quite right in the
  'ead." Somewhat confused at the sudden appearance of the powers that be, the
  perspiring harbinger of bons mots relapsed into an uncomfortable and
  depressing silence.</p>

  <p>"Not right in the head," barked the General. "God bless my soul! It must
  be the heat. Dreadful. What shall we do, Curtis?" He appealed for support to
  his Staff officer.</p>

  <p>"I think, sir, the Doctor might precede us," answered the other
  resourcefully, "and see if the man is dangerous. If so, no doubt he will
  arrange for his removal before he does any harm."</p>

  <p>The A.D.M.S., or Assistant Director of Medical Services&mdash;the official
  title of the principal bolus booster in a Division&mdash;emerged with a
  sickly smile from behind a corner, and advanced unwillingly to the head of
  the procession.</p>

  <p>"Excellent idea," remarked the General affably. "You can prescribe for him
  when you see the symptoms, old boy. Probably a most interesting
  case&mdash;provided he doesn't stab you on sight."</p>

  <p>"Sit on his head, Doc., if he comes for you," remarked the Staff officer,
  gracefully handing over the position of leader, "and, above all, dear old
  thing, don't let him bite you. Give him a Number Nine to chew, and we'll bind
  him when he becomes unconscious."</p>

  <p>"It's all jolly fine for you to laugh," said the Doctor peevishly. "I'm
  fat and you're thin, and you can hide behind me."</p>

  <p>They reached the bay of the trench next to Bendigo, just as a further
  great utterance was starting on its way. In the excitement of the moment,
  caused by the General's sudden appearance, much of this gem was lost.</p>

  <p>What was heard, however, did not diminish the Doctor's alarm.</p>

  <p>"Howls in the leafy verdure," he remarked anxiously. "Good Heavens,
  General, he must be up the tree stump!"</p>

  <p>"That's all right, sir!" remarked a sergeant reassuringly. "'E's quite
  'armless. It's his spirit mind, 'e says. He thinks the tree is full of
  leaves."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;but who is howling in it," asked the General irritably. "I
  don't hear a sound."</p>

  <p>"It's his spirit mind again, sir," answered the sergeant respectfully.
  "There ain't no one 'owling really; 'e means howls wot 'oot."</p>

  <p>The procession paused awhile to digest this momentous fact, and the Staff
  officer seized the opportunity to again comfort the Doctor.</p>

  <p>"Get him at once, old sport, before he becomes homicidal. You never know
  when the phase will change. He may fish in his tin hat with a bent pin first
  or he may shoot you on sight, but I'd go at once if I were you. You stand
  more chance."</p>

  <p>Undoubtedly the sight which confronted them on rounding the traverse
  justified their worst fears. The Doctor recoiled with a choking noise and
  endeavoured to wave the Staff officer forward.</p>

  <p>"Not on your life, Doc.," remarked that worthy grimly&mdash;"not on your
  life. Go right in; and with your bulk you oughtn't to feel it much, wherever
  he kicks you."</p>

  <p>Personally, I maintain the whole thing was rather hard on Bendigo. Before
  sending him up the line he should have been labelled; some warning as to his
  habits should have been noised abroad by the town crier. Then the unfortunate
  episode with the General would never have occurred. He would have made
  allowances, and withdrawn early for light refreshment.</p>

  <p>But when a man whose face is of the type peculiar&mdash;the sort that you
  give the baby to play with&mdash;practises the habits of fourteen years
  unsuccessful dyspeptic futurism in a support line trench on a hot day, the
  result is likely to be full of incident. True&mdash;the wretched Bendigo knew
  no better; but no more did the General. And life is made of these trifling
  misunderstandings....</p>

  <p>The entranced spectators stiffened to attention as the procession of great
  ones&mdash;partially hidden behind the Doctor&mdash;advanced with due
  military precautions. Even the phlegmatic and weary Sapper who was assisting
  the genius, with base utilitarian details, such as the size of the trap door
  at the back of the proposed model, showed signs of animation. Not so Bendigo.
  With an expression on his face suggestive of great internal pain, he remained
  seated on the fire-step muttering softly to himself and clasping to his bosom
  a large lump of what appeared to be mud.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he placed it on the step beside him and rose with an air of
  determination. The staff performed two or three nimble steps of the foxtrot
  variety to the rear, and as they did so Bendigo sprang to the assault. With a
  sweeping half-arm blow he struck the mud and the mud retaliated. While it
  lasted the action was brisk, but the issue was never in doubt. After two
  minutes in fighting, Bendigo withdrew exhausted, and most of the mud went
  with him. What was left looked tired.</p>

  <p>"A clear case of shell shock," muttered the Staff officer nervously in the
  Doctor's ear. "For Heaven's sake do something!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but what the deuce am I to do?" Perspiring freely the gallant
  officer advanced slowly in the direction of Bendigo, who suddenly perceived
  him.</p>

  <p>The sculptor smiled wearily and pointed a languid hand at the result of
  his labours. "A great work, my friend," he murmured. "One of my most
  wonderful studies."</p>

  <p>"Doubtless," remarked the Doctor cautiously. "Don't you
  think&mdash;er&mdash;you'd better lie down?"</p>

  <p>"The leafy foliage; the wonderful green effect; the tree&mdash;as I see
  it. Fresh, fragrant, superb." Bendigo burbled on, heedless of his mundane
  surroundings.</p>

  <p>"What is the fool talkin' about?" howled the General, who was standing on
  tip toe trying to see what was happening.</p>

  <p>"Hush, sir, I beg of you!" The Doctor looked round nervously. "A most
  peculiar&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I won't hush," roared his irascible senior. "Why should I hush? Some
  idiot is standing on my feet; and I'm wedged in here like a sardine. Let me
  speak to him." The General forced his way forward. "Now, you&mdash;my man,
  what the devil are you doing? And what's that damned lump of mud on the fire-
  step?"</p>

  <p>"I am Bendigo Jones," returned the other dreamily. "Sculptah&mdash;
  artist&mdash;genius."</p>

  <p>"I didn't ask who you were," barked the now infuriated General. "I asked
  you what that thing that looks like an inebriated blancmange is meant to
  be."</p>

  <p>"That model?" Bendigo bent forward and gazed at it lovingly. "That is
  yonder tree as I see it. The base materialist with the foot rule will inform
  you of the mundane details."</p>

  <p>The Sapper alluded to scowled heavily at the unconscious Bendigo. Somewhat
  uncertain as to what a base materialist might be, he felt dimly that it was a
  term to be resented.</p>

  <p>"I was sent up 'ere, sir, with 'im to help 'im make a model of that there
  stump," he remarked morosely. "That's the fifteenth mess 'e's made this
  morning; and 'e's carried on 'orrible over the 'ole lot. If I might say so,
  sir, 'e don't seem quite right in his 'ead."</p>

  <p>"I am inclined to agree with you," answered the General grimly. "He must
  be swept up and..."</p>

  <p>Exactly what fate was in store for Bendigo will never be known. One of
  those visitations of fate which occur periodically in the trenches
  interrupted the General's words, and ended the situation in more ways than
  one.</p>

  <p>"Look out, sir," cried a sergeant, with a sudden shout. "Rum jar
  coming."</p>

  <p>It came: wobbling, turning, and twisting, the little black object
  descended from the skies towards them, and the crouching occupants of the
  trench heard it hit the ground a few yards away. Then it burst with a
  deafening roar: a roar which was followed by an ominous creaking.</p>

  <p>It was the phlegmatic Sapper&mdash;the base materialist&mdash;who broke
  the news first.</p>

  <p>With an expression of great relief on his face he gazed over the top of
  the trench. "Thank 'Eavens! you can't make a sixteenth, mate. The whole
  plurry tree's nah poo."</p>

  <p>"Nah poo," murmured Bendigo Jones. "Nah poo. What is nah poo?" He stood up
  and peered over the top also. "I see no change. To some eyes it might seem
  that the tree had fallen; to mine it lives for ever&mdash;fragrant and cool."
  He descended and trod heavily on the General's toe. "To you, sir, as a man of
  understanding, I give my morning's labours. I have rechristened it. It
  symbolises 'Children at play in Epping Forest.'"</p>

  <p>Magnificently he thrust the lump of disintegrating dirt into the arms of
  his outraged superior. "It is yours, sir; I, Bendigo Jones, have given you my
  masterpiece."</p>

  <p>Then he departed.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The only man who really suffered was the base materialist.
  Two hours later he rolled up for his dinner, in a mood even more
  uncommunicative than usual.</p>

  <p>"'Ullo, Nobby," remarked the cook affably, "you don't seem yer usual
  chatty self this morning. An' wot 'ave you got on your neck?"</p>

  <p>"Less of it," returned the other morosely. "It's Hepping Forest. And
  that"&mdash;he plucked a fragment from his hair&mdash;"that is the bally
  twins playin' ''Unt the slipper.'"</p>

  <p>Even the cook was stirred out of his usual air of superiority by this
  assertion, and contemplated the speaker with interest. "You don't say." He
  inspected the phenomenon more closely. "I thought as 'ow it was mud."</p>

  <p>"It is." Nobby was even more morose. "It belonged to that 'orror Bendigo
  Jones, and 'e went and give it to the General." The speaker swallowed once or
  twice. "Then the General, 'e gives it back, in a manner of speaking. Only
  Bendy had gone by the time it come, and&mdash;I 'adn't. Lumme! wot a
  life."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap208"
     name="chap208">VIII. &mdash; THE SONG OF THE BAYONET</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Two men were seated at a table in a restaurant. Dinner was
  over, and from all around them came the murmur of complacent and well-fed
  London. A string band of just sufficient strength gave forth a ragtime
  effort; a supreme being hovered near to ensure that the '65 brandy was all it
  should be. Of the men themselves little need be said: my story is not of
  them. Only their conversation, half serious, half joking, brought back the
  picture of Jimmy O'Shea&mdash;Irishman, cowpuncher, general scallywag, and
  his doctrines of war and the way of his death. As I sat at the next table
  lazily watching pictures in the haze of tobacco smoke, their words conjured
  up the vision of that incomparable fighter who paid the great price a year
  ago, and now lies somewhere near Le Rutoire in the plains beyond Loos. For
  their talk was of a strange thing: the bayonet and the psychology of
  killing....</p>

  <p>"Have you ever killed a man, Joe? that is, killed him with a bayonet?" It
  was the man in mufti who was speaking; and his companion&mdash;a Major in
  khaki&mdash;laughed shortly.</p>

  <p>"I can't say that I have. I've shot one or two Huns, but I've never put a
  bayonet into one."</p>

  <p>The other grunted. "They were teaching me to use a bayonet this morning.
  It's rather fun. An intensely pugilistic little man stamped his foot at me,
  and brandished a ball on the end of a stick in front of my face. One's aim
  and object, as far as I could tell from the book of the words, was to stab
  the ball with the point of one's bayonet, and at the same time grunt in a
  manner calculated to cause alarm and despondency to every one within earshot.
  At times you hit the ball with the butt of the rifle; at others you kick it,
  endeavouring if possible not to stub your toe. Everything depends on what
  part of the German's anatomy it is supposed to represent at the moment." He
  paused and relit his cigar; then he smiled slightly. "I rather enjoyed it.
  The pugilistic warrior was quite pleased with me. He barked 'stomach' at me
  out of my turn, and there was the dam ball about a yard away. I stabbed it,
  kicked it, hit it with my butt, and fell down, all in the course of two
  seconds. But you know, Joe,"&mdash;again he paused slightly&mdash;"it's one
  thing to joke and talk about it here. I can't help thinking it's going to be
  a very different matter when one gets to the real goods. Fancy putting a foot
  of cold steel into a man's body."</p>

  <p>A woman paused by their table on the way out.</p>

  <p>"So you've actually joined up, you poor dear. Your wife told me you quite
  liked it."</p>

  <p>"Yes, dear lady." He stood up and bowed. "After refusing me a commission
  for two years they've pushed me into what I believe they call the Feet. It's
  rather jolly. I haven't felt so well for years."</p>

  <p>"And what do you do?" She adjusted her wrap to pass on.</p>

  <p>"Oh! learn to stab people, and kick them in the tummy; and all sorts of
  little parlour tricks like that."</p>

  <p>"You dreadful man! I don't believe you're a bit bloodthirsty really." She
  shook a reproving finger at him and laughed. "But I shan't mind a bit if you
  kill a lot of those nasty Germans."</p>

  <p>She drifted away, and the man in mufti sat down again. "The last time I
  saw her she had a concert for the wounded at her house. A slightly bow-
  legged woman of great bulk was singing about her soldier lover, who saved her
  icckle bruvver. My hostess cried&mdash;she's that type. Only a little of
  course; but one tear somehow arrived."</p>

  <p>The soldier laughed. "There are a few like that; thank heaven! not many.
  They've learned, Dick; they're learning every day."</p>

  <p>"Up to a point. I am learning to stab people; a thing which, when you
  actually come down to it, is beyond her comprehension. She vaguely knows that
  that is a soldier's job&mdash;or one of them; but it means nothing to her.
  And I don't know that it means very much more to me."</p>

  <p>"You'll find it will, my dear fellow, when the moment comes, and you've
  got your rag out and are seeing red. Let's go."</p>

  <p>The two men got up; waiters hastened forward; and in a few moments their
  table was empty. For a brief space the curtain of imagination had been
  lifted; the drama of grim stark death had flashed into a setting of luxury
  and life....</p>

  <p>And with the rise of the curtain Jimmy O'Shea had stepped on to the
  boards; for no man who knew him could ever hear the word bayonet without
  recalling him, if only for a second.</p>

  <p>He was a mixture was Jimmy&mdash;one of those strange jumbles of character
  in which no country is more rich than Ireland. He would not take a
  commission, though times and again he was offered one by his Colonel.</p>

  <p>"I can teach the boys more as a sergeant, sir," he would answer; "teach
  them better how to score the points that win."</p>

  <p>"You bloodthirsty ruffian," laughed the Colonel. "Your old doctrine, I
  suppose, of close-quarter work."</p>

  <p>"You have it, sir," answered O'Shea quietly. "Every dead German is one
  point up to us; every dead Englishman is a point down. I am teaching the boys
  how to kill, and not be killed themselves."</p>

  <p>"But what the devil do you suppose they have been taught?" The C.O. would
  lean back and light a cigarette. "To sit and pick buttercups, and ask the
  Huns to shoot 'em?"</p>

  <p>"Shooting, is it?" Jimmy's tone expressed immeasurable scorn. "The
  shooting will look after itself. It's the bayonet I talk to them about, and
  where to put it, and how to use it. As you know yourself, sir, a man will
  shoot to kill, where he'll hesitate to use his bayonet&mdash;if he's
  new."</p>

  <p>"That's so. It's instinctive at times."</p>

  <p>"Bedad, sir, they have no instinct when I've finished with them&mdash;save
  one. Kill clean and kill fast; and God help you if you slip...."</p>

  <p>It is possible that when a person has given no thought to war, and the
  objects of war, this distinction may seem strange. Death is a big matter to
  the average being, and one of some finality; and the manner of one's going
  may strike him as of little account. In which assumption he is perfectly
  right&mdash;if he is the member of the party who is going to be killed. But
  that is not the idea which a man going into a scrap should hold for a moment.
  A man goes into a scrap to kill&mdash;not to be killed. To die for one's
  country may be glorious; to kill for one's country is very much more so, and
  a deuced sight less uncomfortable. Wherefore, as Jimmy O'Shea would have
  said, if you'd asked him, "It's outing the other swine you're after, me
  bucko; not being outed yourself. Once you've got your manicured lunch hooks
  (as a phrase for hands I liked that sentence) on the blighter's throat, it's
  up to you to kill him before he kills you. And don't forget it's no dress
  rehearsal show. You won't fail twice."</p>

  <p>Now I do not wish to appear over-bloodthirsty, or to pretend for one
  moment that war is a gigantic and continuous shambles. It is not. But the
  essence of war is man power, and the points are scored by putting men out of
  action, without being put out of action yourself. The idea may not be
  nice&mdash;but war is not nice: one may not approve of the sea being salt,
  but disapproval does not alter hard truth. And having once granted that
  fact&mdash;and surely none can deny it&mdash;it is the different methods of
  scoring points which must be discussed. Some are impersonal&mdash;some are
  not: some are done in cold blood&mdash;some in hot. The whole thing is just a
  question of human nature; and in war, above every other known thing in this
  world, it is human nature that tells: it is human nature that is the great
  deciding factor. A man throws a bomb into a saphead full of Huns. He lies
  there covered by the darkness, crouching, waiting&mdash;One, two,
  three&mdash;and the sharp roar of the explosion shatters the peace of the
  night. Guttural cursings and a dreadful agonised moaning follow in the
  silence that seems the more intense through the contrast. And with a smile of
  great content wreathing his face, the bomber creeps stealthily away to avoid
  intrusive flares. The matter was impersonal, the groaning Hun was a Hun, not
  an individuality....</p>

  <p>A couple of men, mud-caked and weary, with a Lewis gun between them, are
  peering over the top in an early light of dawn. Beside them there are others:
  tense, with every nerve alert, looking fixedly into the grey shadows,
  wondering, a little jumpy.</p>

  <p>"Wot is it, Bill?" A man at the bottom of the trench is fixing a rifle
  grenade in his rifle. "Shall I put this one over?"</p>

  <p>"Gawd knows." Bill is craning his head from side to side, standing on the
  fire-step. "Lumme! there they are. Let 'em 'ave it, Joe. It's a ruddy working
  party." Drawing a steady hand he fires, only to eject his spent cartridge at
  once and fire again. With a sudden phlop the rifle grenade goes drunkenly up
  into the mist; with a grunt of joy the Lewis gun and its warrior discharge a
  magazine at the dim-seen figures. And later, with intense eagerness, the
  ground in front will be searched with periscopes for the discovering and
  counting of the bag. The matter is impersonal; the dead are Huns, not
  individuals....</p>

  <p>But with a bayonet the matter is different. No longer is the man you fight
  an unknown impersonality. He stands before you, an individual whose face you
  can see, whose eyes you can read. He has taken unto himself the guise of a
  man; he has dropped the disguise of an automaton. In those eyes you may read
  the redness of fury or the greyness of terror; in either case it is you or
  him. And a soldier's job is to kill....</p>

  <p>In nine cases out of ten he has forfeited the right to surrender, for as
  Jimmy used to say, "There's only one method of surrendering, and that's by
  long-distance running. When the blackguards come out of their trenches fifty
  yards away and walk towards you bleating, 'Yes, sare; coming at once, sare,
  thick or clear, sare;' you may take 'em prisoners, boys."</p>

  <p>Thus the doctrine in brief of Jimmy O'Shea, sergeant and cowpuncher,
  scallywag and sahib, devil and tender-hearted gentleman. I lifted my glass in
  a silent toast. The music was sobbing gently; the voices of women came
  stealing into my reverie; the smell of the brandy in my glass brought back a
  memory of other women, other brandy....</p>

  <p>The square in the old French town was alive with market carts, which
  lumbered noisily over the cobble stones, while around the pavements, stalls
  and barrows did a roaring trade. It was market-day, and the hot summer sun
  shone down on the busy crowds. Soldiers and civilians, women and small
  children bargained and laughed and squabbled over the prices of "oofs" and
  other delicacies for the inner man. Except for the khaki and the ever present
  ambulance which threaded its way through the creaking country carts, it might
  have been peace time again in Northern France. Yet eight or nine miles away
  were the trenches.</p>

  <p>Facing the square was an open-air cafÚ, where a procession of large light
  beers was pursuing its way down various dry throats, belonging to officers
  both French and British: beer that was iced, and beautiful to behold. Away
  down a little farther on sat Jimmy O'Shea; not admitted into the sacred
  portals marked "Officers only," but none the less happy for that. In front of
  him was a small glass of cognac....</p>

  <p>It was just as a stout and somewhat heated Frenchman in civilian clothes
  got up from the little table next to mine that it happened. There was no
  sound of warning&mdash;it just occurred. The house by the clock was there one
  moment; the next moment it was not. A roar filled the air, drowning the
  clattering carts; bricks, tables, beds went hurtling up into space; walls
  collapsed and crashed on to the cobbles. A great cloud of stifling dust rose
  swiftly and blotted out the scene. Then silence&mdash;the silence of
  stupefaction settled for a while on the watching hundreds, while bricks and
  stones rained down on them from the sky.</p>

  <p>It was the little Frenchman who spoke first. "Mon Dieu! une bombe. Et moi
  je suis le Maire." He walked unsteadily towards the cloud of dust, and with
  his going pandemonium broke loose. Mechanically the beer went down our
  throats, while in all directions carts bumped and jolted, wheels got locked,
  barrows overturned. Still the same blue sky; still the same serene sun; but
  in the place of a quiet grey house&mdash;wreckage, dust, death. And around us
  the first frenzy of panic.</p>

  <p>"Do you put that down to an aeroplane?" I looked up to see Jimmy O'Shea
  beside me. "All right, mother." He was patting an excited woman on her back.
  "I'll help you." He started to pick up the contents of her barrow, which
  reposed principally in the gutter, having been knocked off by a bolting
  horse. "No need to get your wind up. You're cutting no ice in this show;
  you're only on as a super."</p>

  <p>The woman somewhat naturally did not understand a word; but O'Shea had a
  way with women and children, wherein lay the charm of his strange mixture of
  character.</p>

  <p>"Now these eggs, mother dear, these eggs. Bedad! they've gone to their
  last long rest. We can't even scramble them. Oofs, dear heart, oofs;
  napoo&mdash;finis."</p>

  <p>"<i>C'est tout napoo.</i>" She even laughed as she looked at the
  concentrated essence of yellow and white flowing slowly down the gutter.
  "<i>Mon Dieu! voilà une autre.</i>" Another thunderous roar; another
  belching, choking cloud of dust and death, and a house on the other side of
  the square collapsed.</p>

  <p>"It's no aeroplane, sir," said Jimmy, with his eyes on the sky. "It's a
  long-range gun, or I'm a Dutchman." He looked down to find a little girl
  clasping his knee and whimpering. "And phwat is it, me angel?" He caught her
  up in his arms and laughed. "Shure! and I've forgotten me little glass of
  stuff. Come along with me and find it."</p>

  <p>He strode away, only to return with her in a second or two, laughing all
  over her face. Yes&mdash;he had a way with him, had Jimmy O'Shea.</p>

  <p>But it was in the final tableau of that morning's work that I remember him
  best. It was a long-range gun as he said; and they put in fifteen twelve-
  inch shells in an hour, round about the square. Two got the hospital, and one
  hit a barber's shop where an officer was being shaved. I remember we saw him
  with half his face lathered, and later on we found his hand still gripping
  the arm of the chair. As for the barber&mdash;God knows&mdash;</p>

  <p>We sorted out the remnants of some children from the dÚbris of one house;
  and I left O'Shea after a while with a little kid of eight or nine in his
  arms. She was booked for God's nursery, and the passing was not going to be
  easy, for she was hit&mdash;nastily. And it was while Jimmy was nursing the
  poor torn atom with the tenderness of a woman that another sergeant of his
  battalion came on the scene to see if he could help.</p>

  <p>"God! Jimmy," I heard him say, "this makes one sick."</p>

  <p>"Sick!" O'Shea's voice was quiet. "Sick! I've stuck many of them, thank
  the powers, but never again&mdash;never again, my bucko&mdash;will it be
  anywhere save in the stomach. Anything else is too quick."</p>

  <p>I looked at his face; and I understood....</p>

  <p>Yes&mdash;I understood because I had seen: otherwise, I should not. He
  would have been talking another language&mdash;one to which I was a stranger:
  even as were those around me, in that London restaurant, strangers&mdash;even
  as the men, when they first come to France, are strangers. That is the point
  which is in danger at times of being overlooked, especially by those who
  remain behind. The men are not changed in nature because they don a khaki
  coat, or even because they go into the trenches. They have gone to a new
  school, that is all; and if they would do well they must learn all the
  lessons&mdash; the many and very divergent lessons&mdash;they are taught. For
  in the hotch-potch of war there is a strange mixture of the material and the
  spiritual; and though at present I am concerned with the former, the latter
  is just as important. It is the material side of which the men such as Jimmy
  O'Shea are the teachers. Unless the pupils learn from the O'Sheas, they will
  have to do so from the Hun. And the process may not be pleasant....</p>

  <p>There are many branches of the main lesson: the counters in the game may
  be shells or bombs or rifle bullets or bayonets. But the method of scoring is
  the same in each case&mdash;one down or one up. And of them all the bayonet
  is the counter which is at once the most deadly and the most intolerant of
  mistakes. A good friend, a hard taskmaster is the bayonet, and O'Shea was the
  greatest of all its prophets.... The main object of his life was to imbue his
  men, and any one else he could persuade to listen, with its song. His
  practical teaching was sound, very sound; his verbal lashings were wonderful,
  unique. He'd talk and talk, and one's joy was to watch his audience. A sudden
  twitch, a snap of the jaw, and a bovine face would light up with unholy joy.
  The squad drawn up ready for practice, with the straw-filled sacks in front
  of them, would mutter ominously, and teeth would show in a snarl. Absurd, you
  say; not a bit; just a magnetic personality, and men of the right stuff. Dash
  it! I've seen even the Quartermaster, whose ways do not lie near such
  matters, hopping about from one leg to the other when Jimmy's peroration rose
  to its height.</p>

  <p>"Have you a child, MacNab, a little wee kid?" he would begin.</p>

  <p>"I have, sargint," MacNab would answer.</p>

  <p>"Then can you imagine that wee kid with his little hands cut off? Is it a
  boy, MacNab?"</p>

  <p>"It is, sargint."</p>

  <p>"It is. That's good. But they preferred doing it to boys, MacNab. Listen
  to me, the lot of you. Don't mind the aeroplane. Number Two in the rear rank.
  They're like gooseberries out here." Number Two's eyes would abruptly come to
  earth again and focus themselves on the man in front. "I want you to think,"
  Jimmy would go on quietly, "of the dirty, lousy crowd of German waiters you
  remember at home in the days before the war. Do you remember their greasy-
  looking clothes, and their greasy-looking faces, and the way you used to
  treat 'em as the scum of the world? Would you have one of them, MacNab, cut
  the hands off your kid; would you, me bucko?"</p>

  <p>"I would not, sargint." MacNab's slow brain was working; his eyes were
  beginning to glint.</p>

  <p>"Then come out here." Jimmy's voice rose to a shout. "Come out and move.
  Do you see that sack? do you see that white disc? Run at it, you blighter;
  run, snarl, spit. That's the German who has killed your kid. The white paper
  is his heart; run, man, run. Stab him, kill him; stuff your bayonet in him,
  and scream with rage."</p>

  <p>The bewildered MacNab, on the conclusion of this tirade, would amble up to
  the sack, push his gun feebly in its direction, completely miss it&mdash;and
  look sheepishly into space.</p>

  <p>"Mother of heaven! The first competitor in Nuts and May. Did you hear me
  tell you to hit the sack, MacNab? For God's sake, man, stick your bayonet in;
  hit it with your butt; kick it; tear it in pieces with your teeth; worry it;
  do anything&mdash;but don't stand there looking like a Scotchman on Sunday.
  The dam thing's laughing at you."</p>

  <p>And so at last MacNab would begin. Bits of sacking would fly in all
  directions, streams of straw and sawdust would exude. He's kicked it twice,
  and hit it an appalling welt with the butt of his gun. The sweat pours from
  his face; but his eyes are gleaming, as he stops at last from sheer
  exhaustion.</p>

  <p>"Splendid, MacNab; you're a credit to Glasgow, me boy. Are you beginning
  to feel what it's like to stick your point into something, even though it's
  only a sack?"</p>

  <p>But MacNab is already more than half ashamed of his little outburst; he is
  unable to understand what made him see red&mdash;and somewhat uncomfortably
  he returns to his place in the squad. Only, if you look at Jimmy, you will
  see the glint of a smile in his eyes: the squad is new&mdash;the beginning
  has not been bad. He knows what made MacNab see red; by the time he has
  finished with him, the pride of Glasgow will never see anything else....</p>

  <p>And yet what do they know of seeing red, these diners of London? It is
  just as well, I grant, that they should know nothing; but sometimes one
  wonders, when they talk so glibly of the trenches, when they dismiss with a
  casual word the many months of hideous boredom, the few moments of blood-red
  passion of the overseas life, what would they think&mdash;how would they
  look&mdash;if they did know.</p>

  <p>Would they look as did O'Neil's bride, when the robber chief's head
  arrived at the breakfast table? Lest there be any unfortunates who know not
  Kipling let me quote:</p>

  <p>As a derelict ship drifts away with the tide The Captain went out on the
  Past from his Bride, Back, back, through the springs to the chill of the
  year, When he hunted the Boh from Maloon to Tsaleer. As the shape of a corpse
  dimmers up through deep water, In his eye lit the passionless passion of
  slaughter, And men who had fought with O'Neil for the life Had gazed on his
  face with less dread than his wife....</p>

  <p>Perhaps&mdash;who knows? It is difficult to imagine the results of an
  impossibility&mdash;and knowledge in this case is an impossibility. Still at
  times the grim cynicism of the whole thing comes over one with a rush, and
  one&mdash;laughs. It is the only solution&mdash;laughter. Let us blot it out,
  all this strange performance in France: let us eat, drink and be merry. But
  some quotations are better not finished....</p>

  <p>"Come and join us at our table." A girl was speaking, an awfully dear
  girl, one to whom I had been among the many "also rans." Her husband&mdash;an
  officer in the infantry&mdash;grinned affably from another table.</p>

  <p>"In a moment," I answered her, "I will come, and you won't like me at all
  when I do." Then I remembered something. "Why do you dine with that
  scoundrel?"</p>

  <p>"Who?&mdash;My funny old Dick? A dreadful sight, isn't he, but quite
  harmless."</p>

  <p>"Is he? You ask him about the German at Les Boeufs whom he met
  unexpectedly, and see what he says."</p>

  <p>The "Ballad of Boh da Thone" came back&mdash;the humour of it.
  Dick&mdash;the old blackguard&mdash;a rifle butt, and a German's head after
  he'd hit it&mdash;one side; a boiled shirt, dress clothes, and a general air
  of complacent peacefulness&mdash;the other. And the girl: it is always the
  girl who points the contrast....</p>

  <p>I laughed. "Go away, and talk to your harmless husband. I am wrapped in
  thought, or was, till you disturbed me."</p>

  <p>What did she know&mdash;God bless her&mdash;of the details, the filthy,
  necessary details of war. To her it was just a parting from one man, who went
  into an unknown land where there was danger&mdash;hideous, intangible
  danger.</p>

  <p>But of the reality....</p>

  <p>It is all contained in the one axiom&mdash;Kill, and kill at once, so as
  to have a maximum of time to kill more. And with the bayonet, do not let it
  be imagined for a moment that the work is easy. Bayonet fighting requires
  perfect condition, a fair share of strength, and a quick eye. Mistakes, when
  a man comes to the real thing, are not likely to occur twice, and there are
  many things which a man must learn who aspires to become even as Jimmy
  O'Shea.</p>

  <p>How to go round a traverse when a Boche is on the other side, and it's him
  or you; how to take on three men in succession, when the last one throws his
  arms round your neck, and burbles, "Ve vos friends&mdash;nein?" Jimmy was
  great on that point: with the bayonet jabbed upwards into the chin, and the
  sapient remark, "Ve <i>vos</i>, ma tear." But enough; this is not a treatise
  on bayonet fighting, and I have in mind to tell of O'Shea's last fight.</p>

  <p>There is just one more scene which comes back vividly before I reach the
  end, and that is the final exercise he gave his men in their training. When
  they'd thrust and parried and stabbed; when they'd jumped trenches and thrust
  their bayonets into sacks on the other side; when they'd been confronted with
  strange balls of straw in unexpected places, and kicked them or jabbed them
  or bit them as the case might be&mdash;then came the gem, the <i>bonne
  bouche</i>.</p>

  <p>These preliminary practices were only one stroke, one thrust; the last was
  a fight to the death in a manner of speaking, and it was generally preceded
  by one of Jimmy's better stories. The best he kept for recital just before
  going over the top; so as to send 'em along frothing at the mouth, as he put
  it.</p>

  <p>"You don't remember Captain Trent, do you, boys?" he'd begin. "Just stand
  easy a while, and I'll tell you about him. After that you've got to fight a
  bit. He was a great officer, boys, a grand officer&mdash;one of the best. Did
  you ever hear how he was killed? Come out here, Malvaney; we'll just start
  the scrapping while I tell you. Do you see this straw ball on the top of the
  stick? As long as it's off the ground, it's a German. Hit it, stick it, bite
  it, kick it, and go on till I put it on the ground again. And curse, you
  blighter, curse. Just think it's the German who stuck his bayonet into
  Captain Trent&mdash;one of <i>your</i> officers&mdash;while he was lying on
  the ground wounded in the head."</p>

  <p>The ball began to dance. "Go on, Malvaney. Kill it, man, kill it; grunt,
  snarl; think of the swine and what they've done. Jab, jab&mdash;up in his
  throat. I'll get you a live one to practise on one day." At last the ball
  would come to rest, and Malvaney&mdash;his teeth bared, snarling&mdash; would
  face Jimmy, who stood there smiling grimly. And in a few seconds Malvaney
  would grin too, and the blood lust would die out of his eyes....</p>

  <p>"Good boy&mdash;not half bad!" O'Shea would nod approvingly. "The worst of
  it is the swine will never stand up to you&mdash;bayonet to bayonet. They
  prefer women and wounded men&mdash;like the Captain. Come here, MacNab, and
  get an appetite for your dinner. You can just rest a while&mdash;I'll get on
  a bit with that story. It was way back in the Spring, down south a bit; and
  we went over the top. Have you been over the top, MacNab?"</p>

  <p>"I have that," answered the Scotchman in a reminiscent tone.</p>

  <p>"How many did you kill?"</p>

  <p>"Four-r&mdash;ah'm thinking; but ah'm no certain aboot one of them."</p>

  <p>"Four! And none too dusty. Hit it, MacNab, me boy"&mdash;the ball would
  dance in his face&mdash;"hit it, as if 'twas the one of which you are not
  certain. Listen here, boys"&mdash;once again the ball was at rest on the
  ground&mdash;"I was behind Captain Trent when we went over&mdash;in the third
  wave; and when I got to the Germans I was just in time to see it." Jimmy's
  pauses were always dramatic.</p>

  <p>"See wot, sargint?" An interested and comparatively new arrival to the
  battalion would lean forward.</p>

  <p>"Captain Trent lying at the bottom of the trench&mdash;he'd gone over with
  the first wave&mdash;and a Hun pulling a bayonet out of him. Moreover,
  Captain Trent was wounded in the head." His voice gathered in fury. "Think of
  it, me bohunks; then think of a conscientious objector; and then come and
  kill this ruddy ball. A dirty filthy scut of a German waiter murdering a
  wounded Englishman. Hit it, MacNab; hit it; stab it, kick it; think you're
  scrambling for whisky in a prohibited area."</p>

  <p>"Wot did you do, sargint?" The new arrival was still interested.</p>

  <p>"What would you have done, Marmaduke? Come here, my boy; come here and
  breathe blood."</p>

  <p>The new arrival&mdash;a little bashful at his sudden
  notoriety&mdash;stepped forward. "I'd have killed him, sargint."</p>

  <p>"Then kill this ball; go on&mdash;kill it. Damme, boy; you're jumping
  about like an old woman looking for a flea in a bed. Move, boy, move; the
  ball's the flea, and you're the old trout. Bite it, boy, bite it; stamp on
  it; take out your fork and stick it with that." The ball came to rest; the
  new arrival mopped his brow. "Did I ever tell you how to kill a man with your
  dinner fork, by sticking it into his neck? I will some day; it's a good death
  for a Hun."</p>

  <p>"Did you catch that there swine, sergeant?" Another voice from the squad
  took up the tale.</p>

  <p>"Did I catch him? Did I catch him? If I hadn't caught him, Percival, I
  wouldn't be here now. I wouldn't dare look an exempted indispensable in the
  face&mdash;let alone you. And for a fat man he ran well."</p>

  <p>"Didn't 'e fight?" Marmaduke had more or less recovered his breath.</p>

  <p>"Fight!" O'Shea grinned at the recollection. "He looked up; he saw me
  about five yards away; he gave one squawk like the female ducked-billed
  platypus calling to her young, and he faded round the traverse like the
  family do when the landlord comes for the rent. Come here,
  O'Sullivan&mdash;and break up the home."</p>

  <p>Marmaduke retired, to be replaced by a brawny Irishman.</p>

  <p>"I caught him, O'Sullivan&mdash;hit, man, hit&mdash;just as he reached his
  dug-out. Kick it, man; you can't use your butt from there. Jab, jab&mdash;you
  blighter; for God's sake use your gun as if you loved it. He stuck in the
  door, O'Sullivan, for half a second. There's the ball&mdash; that's his back.
  Go on. Good, good." With an awful curse the Irishman lunged and the ball
  dropped to the ground.</p>

  <p>"Dead," O'Shea grinned. "That's what I did; through the back. But the
  blamed thing stuck; I couldn't get it out. What do you do then,
  Marmaduke?"</p>

  <p>"Put a round in, sargint, and blow it out."</p>

  <p>"Good boy, Marmaduke. You'll be a Field-Marshal before you've done. That's
  what I did too; and I blew the swine down the entrance. Now then, half with
  sticks and half with rifles; go on&mdash;fight&mdash;"</p>

  <p>This, as I said, was one of Jimmy's better stories. Incidentally it had
  the merit of being true....</p>

  <p>But one could continue indefinitely. Some one will write a book one day
  about Jimmy O'Shea, and the manner of his life. If so, order an advance copy;
  it will be the goods. Just at the moment it was the manner of his death that
  had me. I was back again in derelict Vermelles, with its spattered water
  tower, and the flat desolate plain in front. Loos is out of sight over the
  hill; only the great slag heap lies squat and menacing on one's left, with
  the remnants of Big Willie and Little Willie near to its base in the old
  blood-soaked Hohenzollern redoubt. Cambrin, Guinchy, La BassÚe&mdash;silent
  and haunted, teeming with ghosts, lie stagnant in the morning sun. The
  cobwebs drift across the Hulluch road, and in the distance, by the first
  bend, a man pushing a wheeled stretcher comes slowly walking back to the
  dressing station. It's still going on: nothing much has changed; and
  yet&mdash;the cigar is good; the brandy superb: the brandy Jimmy preferred.
  He only spent one leave in England; as a sergeant he couldn't get more; but I
  dined with him one night, dress clothes and all complete, and we drank that
  brandy. One need hardly say, perhaps, that the writing on the register of his
  birth would have been hard put to it to spell O'Shea. There have been many
  like him this war, from "the legions of the lost ones and the cohorts of the
  damned"; and they've come to us out of the waste places, out of the lands
  that lie beyond the mountains. Unhonoured, unknown, they've finished the
  game; and having finished, they lie at peace. Britain called them; they
  came&mdash;those so-called wasters; look to it, you overmuch righteous ones,
  who have had to be dragged by the hairs of your heads&mdash;bleating of home
  ties and consciences....</p>

  <p>I forget which of the stories I heard him telling the men that morning
  before they went over. He read one lot a thing he swore he'd got out of a
  German paper&mdash;Heaven knows if it was true. I remember it ended up:
  "Above all things show no mercy to the accursed English. They are the
  starters of this war; so spit on them, kick them, use them as the swine they
  are."</p>

  <p>"There you are, boys," cried Jimmy cheerily, "listen to what the pretties
  say about you. You'll be into 'em in a minute; and don't forget what I've
  told you about the way to use your gun. Kill fast and kill clean. Don't you
  put up with any back lash from a sausage-eating waiter. Remember you're
  English, me boys; and remember the Regiment&mdash;the Regiment that's never
  yet failed."</p>

  <p>And so he went on; worth a hundred times his weight in gold to men going
  in for the first time.</p>

  <p>"Your point is at his throat, boy, don't forget it. You ain't playing the
  goat with a dam lump of straw now; you're going to get a bit of your own back
  with a real live Fritz. And if you make a mistake you may not have a chance
  of making another. Go there steady; don't get blown, or you'll find you won't
  be able to do what you'd like when you bump Master Boche."</p>

  <p>He passed me with a salute and a wink.</p>

  <p>"Coming over?" he asked me.</p>

  <p>"I am, Jimmy, with some wire and other atrocities."</p>

  <p>"Good," he said. "The boys are simply frothing blood."</p>

  <p>He went on; and that was the last time I saw Jimmy O'Shea alive.</p>

  <p>Ye Gods! My Lord&mdash;some day I'll tell you of your son's end. You
  kicked him out&mdash;perhaps rightly; though mercy was never your strong
  point. But if any of the belted ancestors in that gallery of yours did as
  much for England as Jimmy did, or died as gloriously as Jimmy died, well, you
  should be a proud man, prouder even than you are. He sent the boys over
  raving mad with blood, and they struck Bavarians&mdash;and good Bavarians:
  men who could fight, and men who did fight. They were at it, teeth, feet, and
  steel for ten minutes: primitive, lustful fighting; and then the Bavarians
  broke; with the boys after them, stabbing and cursing. One or two were left,
  though they wouldn't surrender, more power to them. A Bavarian officer, in
  fact, concluded the eventful career of Sapper O'Toole, the company
  rum-swallowing champion. True he brained that officer with a coil of barbed
  wire on the end of a pick helve, even as the bullet entered his heart; but he
  was a great loss to us. And it was just as we surged over their bodies that
  we came to the tableau.</p>

  <p>Jimmy lay round the traverse. We found him at the bottom when we'd sorted
  out the litter. There were six of them he'd done in in all; you could trace
  what had happened. They'd been lining the trench, and he'd taken them in
  order. It was in the fifth that his bayonet stuck. He couldn't get it out. It
  was still there. At that moment, evidently, Number Six had come at him, and
  he'd had no time. So they closed; and, my God! they'd fought.</p>

  <p>I think they both must have gone out about the same time. Jimmy was shot
  through the heart by the Bavarian's revolver; the Bavarian's throat was cut
  with Jimmy's clasp knife.</p>

  <p>No bad end, my lord; what say you? I will show you the exact spot some
  day, and your son's grave near by. I'd have his picture in the gallery if I
  were you.... I've got a snapshot I can let you have, taken in France. But I
  treasure it; and unless you hang it in the place of honour, amongst the
  Raeburns&mdash;I keep it. Mark you, he deserves that place of honour....</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"Captain Johnson's compliments, sir, and are you coming over
  to have a liqueur at his table?"</p>

  <p>The waiter's voice cut in on my thoughts. The band was hitting a ragtime
  stunt; London had dined and was pleased with itself; Dick and his lady were
  beckoning. For the moment it felt like coming to from an anaesthetic.</p>

  <p>I shook myself and got up. Of course I was drinking a liqueur with them:
  another glass of brandy&mdash;Jimmy O'Shea's brandy.</p>

  <p>"Are you in love?" queried the girl anxiously as I sat down. "You've been
  muttering to yourself and squinting and Dickie got worried about you."</p>

  <p>"Not more than usual&mdash;though I'm glad to learn the symptoms." Then I
  looked at her, and the wonder of a girl in love hit me almost like a blow. In
  it lay the answer to my thoughts. No longer a cynical amusement in their
  failure to realise the contrast, but rather a mighty thankfulness. For it is
  they, in their blessed ignorance, who keep us sane.</p>

  <p>I raised my glass. "To things as they are, my lady," I murmured. And from
  the land of shadows Jimmy drank with me.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="part3"
     name="part3">PART III. &mdash; SEED TIME</a></h2>

  <h2><a id="chap301"
     name="chap301">I. &mdash; THE SEED</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I have in my mind the tale of a superior young man&mdash;a
  very superior young man, genteel, and thoroughly versed in the intricacies of
  etiquette. The majority of the human race was, without any loss to itself,
  unaware that he existed; but the "ladies" and "gentlemen" on the staff of
  Mogg's Mammoth Emporium viewed him as the supreme arbiter of elegance. And
  just because the average human being would have asserted&mdash;and asserted
  correctly&mdash;that for such as him there is no hope save drowning in
  puppyhood, I would tell his story. It is the exception which proves the rule.
  It is the proof that we are the slaves of custom and environment; and that,
  given something as the bed-rock, much may be done by a good teacher. There
  was something in this very superior young man as it turned out, though few
  would have suspected it, had they seen him before the war. But then, no one
  can ever listen to a person of the male sex proffering a good line of
  stockings in Lisle thread at one and eleven-three without experiencing a
  strong desire to be sick. Which goes back to what I said before: the whole
  thing is one of environment. The stocking vendors knew no better; for want of
  the necessary teaching they took to their nauseating trade. It's all in the
  Old Book&mdash;how shall they learn, unless they be taught? Had they had the
  teaching&mdash;well, listen to the story of this very superior young
  "gentleman," one time deputy chief stomach bender of Mogg's Mammoth Millinery
  Emporium&mdash;terms. Strictly Cash. What the sub deputy chief waistcoat
  creaser will say if he reads these words I shudder to think. You see, the
  very superior young "gentleman" was <i>so</i> genteel.</p>

  <p>A hot morning sun shone down on the outskirts of the town. Nothing moved,
  nothing stirred; utter silence brooded over the houses that once had been
  buzzing with people&mdash;the people of Arras. Now their only occupants were
  rats. The little gardens at the back were dank with unchecked weeds, save
  where a great conical hole showed the clean brown earth. And at the bottom of
  each of these holes lay a pool of foetid green water. The walls were
  crumbling, decay was rampant, the place breathed corruption. Occasionally the
  silence would be broken by a crash, and a little heap of brick rubble would
  subside into the road, raising a cloud of thick choking dust. Occasionally
  there would be another sound, like the drone of a great beetle, followed by a
  dull echoing roar and a bigger cloud of dust. Occasionally would come the
  ping-phut of a stray bullet; but of human life there was no sign.</p>

  <p>Not, that is to say, to the casual observer; but to the man who looked out
  of the aeroplane circling above much was visible which you or I would not
  see. To him there came the vision of an occasional move behind some
  mouldering wall: sometimes an upturned face, sometimes the glint of steel. In
  one garden by a broken cucumber frame a man was polishing his bayonet, and
  the flash from it caught the observer's eye. Just opposite&mdash;thirty yards
  away&mdash;two or three men were sitting round a fire from which the smoke
  curled slowly up. And the bayonet cleaner was clothed in khaki, while the
  cookers had on a dirty field grey; between them lay No Man's Land. But to the
  casual observer&mdash;silence: silence and death and the dreadful stink of
  corruption. Many others had cleaned bayonets and cooked stews under these
  same conditions, and many in the doing thereof had gone suddenly, and without
  warning, into the great Silence. For it was a sniper's paradise, as the
  victims&mdash;could they have spoken&mdash;would have testified. As it was
  they lay there lightly buried, and the same fool men made the same fool
  mistakes and came and joined them. As I say, it was a sniper's
  paradise....</p>

  <p>Into this abode of joy, then, came the very superior young "gentleman." It
  was principally owing to the fact that Miss Belsize&mdash;the "lady" who
  dispensed camisoles, or some equally seductive garments&mdash;had flatly
  refused to accompany him any longer to the High Street Picture Palace if he
  remained in his frock coat, that our friend had donned khaki. For a long
  while he had stoutly affirmed that he was indispensable; then the transfer of
  affection on the part of camisoles to a dangerous-looking corporal from the
  wild and woolly West decided him. He did not like that corporal. No man who,
  meeting a comparative stranger, beat him on the back painfully, and, having
  looked his latest glad rags up and down, remarked with painful distinctness,
  "Lumme! is it real?" could possibly be considered a gentleman. But Miss
  Belsize had laughed long and laughed loud; and&mdash;well, I will not labour
  the point. In due course our superior one found himself in the haunt of death
  I have briefly described above, still full of self-importance and as
  inconceivably ignorant as the majority are who come for the first time to the
  game across the water.</p>

  <p>Recently arrived with a draft it was his initial experience of war in
  France, in contrast with training in England; in fact, the morning in
  question was his first visit to the trenches. And because many better men
  than he have endeavoured to conceal a peculiar sinking of the stomach by an
  assumed bravado, let us not blame him for the attitude he endeavoured to take
  up.</p>

  <p>"Pretty quiet, isn't it, corporal?" he remarked airily, as his section
  came to rest in a trench behind a mass of broken brick and cobble stones.
  "Lor', look at that glass up there, hidden in the stones." For a moment
  curiosity mastered him, and he reached up towards it with his hand. The next
  instant he gave a cry of anger, as a jolt in his ribs with a rifle doubled
  him up. "What the deuce&mdash;" he began angrily.</p>

  <p>"Don't you deuce me, my lad," said the corporal dispassionately, "or you
  and me will quarrel. Just you do what you're told, and I'll write and tell
  your ma you're a good little boy." The corporal&mdash;a man of few
  words&mdash;went on his way, leaving our hero&mdash;whose name by the way was
  Reginald Simpkins&mdash;fuming.</p>

  <p>"If that blighter hits me again," he remarked when the N.C.O. was out of
  hearing, "I'll&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You'll what?" An old soldier looked at him scornfully. "He goes an' saves
  yer mouldy life and then yer bleats. Got yer bib, Reggie darling?"</p>

  <p>"Not so much of your row." The corporal had come back again. "This ain't a
  ruddy colony of rooks in the nesting season. Now, Simpkins, you and
  Ginger&mdash;first relief. There's your periscope&mdash;you can relieve them
  other two."</p>

  <p>"Where's the periscope?" asked Reginald of his companion in a whisper.</p>

  <p>"The glass up there, you flat-faced perisher&mdash;hidden in the stones.
  Wot d'you think it is? A noyster laying eggs!"</p>

  <p>The trench settled down to silence as the company relief was completed,
  and Reginald morosely nursed his grievance. Much of the gentle flattery to
  which he had been accustomed at Mogg's Mammoth Emporium seemed conspicuous by
  its absence in this new sphere in which he found himself. Not to put too fine
  a point on it, people seemed positively rude at times, even ruder than they
  had been at home. He confided as much in an aggrieved whisper to the
  unsympathetic Ginger.</p>

  <p>"Rude!" That worthy spat with violence and accuracy. "You wait till you
  bump into Shorty Bill. Rude! Gawd! 'E's a 'oly terror."</p>

  <p>"Who is Shorty Bill?" queried Reggie, his eyes fixed on the glass whose
  mysteries he was beginning to understand.</p>

  <p>But Ginger was in no mood for further confidences. "You'll find out fast
  enough 'oo Shorty is. 'E's down 'ere today. You watch that there periscope.
  This ain't no rest cure&mdash;this bit 'ere. It's 'ell."</p>

  <p>"It seems pretty quiet," ventured the watcher after a short silence.</p>

  <p>"Yus! That's wot the last man said wot I was with behind this wall.
  There's 'is brains on that stone behind you."</p>

  <p>With an involuntary shudder Reginald looked round at the stone, on which
  the grim stains still remained. "What did it?" he asked, barely above a
  whisper.</p>

  <p>"Black Fritz," answered the other. "'E's a sniper, what lives opposite;
  and 'e's paid for 'is keep that swine 'as&mdash;paid for 'is keep. Charlie
  Turner, an' 'Arry, an' Ginger Woodward, an' Nobby Clark, an' the sergeant-
  major, an' two orficers. Yus&mdash;'e's paid for 'is keep, 'e 'as&mdash;'as
  Master Black Fritz."</p>

  <p>"And he's over there," said Reggie, a little breathlessly.</p>

  <p>"Yus. Where the 'ell do you think 'e is? In an aeryplane?" Once again
  Ginger spat dispassionately, and then relapsed into a silence from which he
  refused to be drawn until the presence of two more men beside him indicated
  that the hour of relief had come.</p>

  <p>"Now look here, Simpkins," said the corporal when the relief was
  completed, "this is your first visit to the trenches, isn't it? Well, you can
  sit down now and have a sleep, or you can write or read if you like. But,
  whatever you do, don't go showing your ugly face over the top; because this
  place ain't healthy." He turned away, and Reggie was left to his own
  resources.</p>

  <p>"Come round the corner," said Ginger in his ear. "I'll show you a spot to
  sleep. I know this 'ere bit like me own back parlour."</p>

  <p>And so&mdash;had any one been sufficiently interested in his doings to
  report the fact&mdash;it might have been noted that ten minutes later our
  friend was sitting on the fire step writing a lurid epistle to Miss Belsize,
  while Ginger lay peacefully asleep beside him, breaking the complete silence
  with his snores.</p>

  <p>At last the letter was finished, and Reggie gave way to meditation.
  Everything was so utterly different to what he had anticipated that he could
  hardly believe he was actually in that mystic place the trenches. To his left
  a crumbling wall ran along until it bent out of sight, a wall which in most
  places was three or four feet high, but which at one spot had been broken
  down until it was almost flush with the ground, and the bricks and rubble
  littered the weeds. In front of him lay the town, desolate, appalling, with a
  few rooks cawing discordantly round the windowless houses. And over
  everything brooded an oppressive hot stinking stillness that almost terrified
  him....</p>

  <p>After a while his gaze settled on the place where the wall was broken
  down, and his imagination began to play. If he went there&mdash;it was only
  about ten yards away&mdash;he would be able to look straight at the Germans.
  So obsessed did he become with this wonderful idea that he woke up the
  sleeping Ginger and confided it to him. There being a censor of public morals
  I will refrain from giving that worthy warrior's reply when he had digested
  this astounding piece of information; it is sufficient to say that it did not
  encourage further conversation, nor did it soothe our hero's nerves. He was
  getting jangled&mdash;jangled over nothing. It was probably because there was
  such a complete nothing happening that the jangling process occurred. A
  shell, a noise, anything; but not this awful, silent stagnation. He bent down
  mechanically and picked up half a brick; then just as mechanically he bowled
  the half-brick at the lump of dÚbris behind the broken bit of the wall. And
  it was that simple action which changed our very superior young "gentleman"
  into a man: on such slender threads hang the destinies even of nations.</p>

  <p>He watched the brick idly as it went through space; he watched it idly as
  it hit the ground just by a clump of dock leaves; and from that moment idly
  ceases to be the correct adverb. Five seconds later, with a pricking
  sensation in his scalp and a mouth oddly dry, he was muttering excitedly into
  the ear of the now infuriated Ginger.</p>

  <p>"A man where, you ruddy perisher?" he grunted savagely. "Fust yer tells me
  if you goes and looks at the 'Uns you can see 'em; and then you says there's
  a man in the nettles. You ought to be locked up."</p>

  <p>"There is, I tell you. I heaved a brick at that bunch of leaves, and it
  hit something that grunted." Reginald was still clutching his companion's
  arm.</p>

  <p>"Un'and me, Clara," said the other peevishly, "this ain't a sixpenny
  'op."</p>

  <p>He got up&mdash;impressed in spite of himself by the other's
  manner&mdash;and peered at the mass of dÚbris. "Wot d'yer want with 'eaving
  bricks for, anyway," he continued irately after a long inspection which
  revealed nothing. "This 'ere ain't a bean-feast where you gets the bag of
  nuts."</p>

  <p>"Watch this time, Ginger." Once again a large fragment came down in the
  neighbourhood of the dock leaves&mdash;followed by an unmistakable groan.</p>

  <p>"Lumme, mate," said Ginger hoarsely, "wot is it?" The two men stood
  peering at the rubbish, not ten yards away. "I'll go and get the corporal.
  You..." But he didn't finish his sentence.</p>

  <p>Two shots rang out almost simultaneously. One was from the German lines,
  and there was a short stifled scream from the other side of the traverse. The
  other was from the rubbish heap ten yards away, and the blast made a piece of
  hemlock rock violently. Otherwise the rubbish heap was lifeless&mdash; save
  for a sepulchral voice&mdash;"Got him." There was a crash of falling bricks
  from a house opposite&mdash;the sound of what seemed to be a body slithering
  down&mdash;and then silence.</p>

  <p>Ginger's grip relaxed, and he grinned gently. "Gawd 'elp you, Reginald;
  you 'ave my blessing. You've been dropping the brickyard on Shorty Bill's
  back." He faded rapidly away, and our friend was left alone, gazing with
  fascinated eyes at the miraculous phenomenon which was occurring under his
  very nose. Suddenly and with incredible swiftness a portion of the rubbish
  heap, with dock leaves, nettles, old cans, and bricks adhering to it,
  detached itself from the main pile and hurled itself into the trench. With a
  peculiar sliding movement it advanced along the bottom, and then it stopped
  and stood upright. Speechless with amazement, Reginald found himself gazing
  into the eyes of a man which were glaring at him out of a small slit in the
  sacking which completely covered him. A pair of dirty earth-stained hands
  gently laid down a rifle on the fire-step&mdash;a rifle with a telescopic
  sight. Then from the apparition came a voice.</p>

  <p>"Say, kid, are you the son of a &mdash;, who has been practising putting
  the weight in my back? Don't speak, son, don't speak, or I might forget my
  manners. Once in the ribs&mdash;and once in the small of the back. God above,
  my lad, if I'd missed Black Fritz, after lying up there for him for eight
  hours as part of the scenery, I'd have&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"'Ullo, Shorty." The corporal rounded the traverse. "Fritz has got
  another. Poor old Bill Trent. Copped clean through the 'ead."</p>

  <p>The corporal, followed by the strange uncouth being in sacking, with his
  leaves and bricks hanging about him, moved away, and Reginald followed. With
  his heart thumping within him he looked at the dreadful thing that ten
  minutes before had been a speaking, seeing, man; and as he looked something
  seemed to be born in his soul. With a sudden lightning flash of insight he
  saw himself in a frock coat behind the counter; then he looked at the silent
  object on the step, and his jaw set. He turned to Shorty Bill.</p>

  <p>"I'm dam sorry about that brick; but I'm new to the game, and I had no
  idea you were there. Didn't you say you'd got Black Fritz?"</p>

  <p>"'Ave you, Shorty&mdash;'ave you got the swine?" An eager chorus assailed
  him, but the man in the sack had his eyes fixed on the very superior young
  "gentleman." At length he turned to the men around.</p>

  <p>"Yep&mdash;I got him. Half left&mdash;by the base of that red house. He
  came out of the top window. You can see a black thing there through a
  periscope." The men thronged to have a look, and Shorty Bill turned to the
  stone thrower.</p>

  <p>"Can you shoot?"</p>

  <p>"A little; not much I'm afraid."</p>

  <p>"Like to learn the game? Yep?&mdash;Right. I'll teach you. It's great." He
  moved slowly away and turned up a communication trench, while into the eyes
  of Mogg's pride there came a peculiar look quite foreign to his general
  disposition. A game&mdash;a great game! He looked again at the poor still
  thing on the step, and his teeth clenched. Thus began his fall from
  gentility!...</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap302"
     name="chap302">II. &mdash; THE FIRST LESSON</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It was not a very rapid descent. The art of sniping and its
  attendant pastime scouting is not learned in a day. Moreover, in company with
  the other games that are played in the trenches, it has the one dominant
  feature about it. One mistake made in the rules is one too many; there is no
  chance of making a second. True, the player will have taught the man who
  takes his place yet another of the things not to do; but
  personally&mdash;even at the risk of being dubbed a pessimist&mdash;the
  method of teaching is one I would prefer to see others employ, sentiments
  which were shared to the full by Shorty Bill. Therefore our superior young
  friend, having gazed upon the result of a sniper's bullet, and in the gazing
  remoulded his frock-coated existence, could not have come under a better
  master.</p>

  <p>Shorty Bill was a bit of a character. Poacher and trapper, with an eye
  like a lynx and a fore-arm like a bullock's leg, he was undoubtedly a tough
  proposition. What should have made him take a liking to Reginald is one of
  those things which passes understanding, for two more totally dissimilar
  characters can hardly be imagined. Our friend&mdash;at the time of the
  shooting of Black Fritz&mdash;was essentially of that type of town-bred youth
  who sneers at authority behind its back and cringes to its face. Such a
  description may sound worse than the type deserves; for all that, it is a
  true one of the street-bred crowd&mdash;they've been reared on the doctrine.
  Shorty was exactly the reverse. Shorty, on one occasion, having blocked six
  miles of traffic with a fractious mule, and being confronted suddenly by an
  infuriated Staff officer who howled at him, smiled genially and electrified
  the onlookers by remarking pleasantly, "Dry up, little man; this is <i>my</i>
  show." That was Shorty in front of authority. Behind its back&mdash; well,
  his methods may not have commended themselves to purists in etiquette, but I
  have known officers sigh with relief when they have found out unofficially
  that Shorty had taken some little job or other into his own personal care.
  There are many little matters&mdash;which need not be gone into, and which
  are bound to crop up when a thousand men are trying to live as a happy
  family&mdash; where the unofficial ministrations of our Shorty
  Bills&mdash;and they are a glorious if somewhat unholy company&mdash;are
  worth the regimental sergeant-major, the officers, and all the N.C.O.'s put
  together. But&mdash;I digress; sufficient has been said to show that the two
  characters were hardly what one would have expected to form an alliance.</p>

  <p>The gentle art of sniping in the battalion when Bill joined with a draft
  had been woefully neglected. In fact, it was practically non-existent. It is
  not necessary to give any account of how Bill got the ear of his platoon
  commander, how he interested him in the possibilities of sniping in trench
  warfare, or any other kind of warfare for that matter, and how ultimately his
  platoon officer became mad keen, and with the consent of his C.O. was made
  Battalion sniping officer. Though interesting possibly to students of the gun
  and other subjects intimately connected with sniping, I have not the time to
  describe the growth of the battalion scouts from a name only to the period
  when they became a holy terror to the Hun. I am chiefly concerned with the
  development of our frock-coated friend into a night prowler in holes full of
  death and corruption, and one or two sage aphorisms from the lips of Shorty
  Bill which helped that development. They were nothing new or original, those
  remarks of his teacher, and yet they brought home to him for the first time
  in his life the enormous gulf which separated him from the men who live with
  nature.</p>

  <p>"Say, kid, do you ever read poetry?" remarked Bill to him one night soon
  after the episode of the brick-bats as they sat in an estaminet. "I guess
  your average love tosh leaves me like a one-eyed codfish; but there's a bit
  I've got in me head writ by some joker who knows me and the likes o' me.</p>

  <p>"'There's a whisper on the night wind, there's a star agleam to guide us,
  And the wild is calling, calling... let us go.'"</p>

  <p>Shorty contemplatively finished his beer. "'The wild is calling.' Ever
  felt that call, kid?"</p>

  <p>"Can't say I have, Shorty." His tone was humble; gone was the pathetic
  arrogance that had been the pride of Mogg's; in its place the beginnings of
  the realisation of his utter futility had come, coupled with a profound hero
  worship for the man who had condescended to notice him. "When are you going
  to teach me that sniping game?"</p>

  <p>The real sniping commander of the battalion&mdash;I mean no disrespect to
  the worthy young officer who officially filled that position&mdash; looked at
  the eager face opposite him and laughed.</p>

  <p>"You'd better quit it, son. Why, to start with, you're frightened of the
  dark."</p>

  <p>"I'm damned if I am." The aggrieved Percy waxed indignant.</p>

  <p>"Oh, cut it out! I don't mean you're frightened of going to bed in the
  dark, or that you want a nightlight or a nurse. But yours is a town dark:
  standing under lamps gettin' the glad from a passing skirt. But in the real
  dark, when it's pressing round you like a blanket, and there are things
  moving, and people breathing near by, and you don't know whether it's a
  German or a pal, or where the wire is, or which way your own trenches
  are&mdash;what then, son, what then? Why, I reckon you don't even know which
  the Pole Star is, or what it's there for?"</p>

  <p>"I guess not, Shorty," remarked the other, abashed; "but I'd soon learn,
  if you'd teach me."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll see. An' there's that blamed old woman with a face like a wet
  street tryin' to shut up the shop. Give me another, mother darling; no good
  your na-poohing me&mdash;I'm going to have it if I takes it."</p>

  <p>Being what he was he got it, and that evening the lessons began. Going
  back to their billet, they had to cross a field. It was a pitch-black night,
  and before they had proceeded twenty yards Reggie could hardly see his hand
  in front of his face.</p>

  <p>"Dark, Shorty, ain't it?" he remarked.</p>

  <p>There was no answer, and he stopped and repeated the question. Still no
  answer, though he seemed to feel some one close by. Something brushed his
  face, and then silence. With a short laugh he walked on&mdash;a laugh which
  had just the faintest touch of bravado in it. Four times in the distance to
  the billet did that something brush his face again, and though each time he
  felt that there was some one near him, yet he heard nothing. The fourth time
  he stopped and spoke.</p>

  <p>"Is that you, Shorty?" The next instant he gave a jump of pure nervous
  fright. From within six inches of his ear came the single word "Yep."</p>

  <p>"Jove! You did give me a start." He laughed a little shakily. "Where have
  you been?"</p>

  <p>"Circling round you, son, dusting your face with my glove. Understand now
  what I meant by helpless in the dark?"</p>

  <p>Thus ended the first lesson....</p>

  <p>The others followed in due course. The correct way to crawl through grass
  so as to avoid being mistaken for a rhinoceros going to water; the power of
  observation so as to be able to spot a change in the German
  trenches&mdash;maybe, only a few sand bags moved, but just enough to place
  the position of a machine gun; the value of disguise to defeat the curious on
  the other side; patience, the way to fire a rifle, the use of his eyes. All
  these and certain other things was he taught.</p>

  <p>And the certain other things were mysterious and secret. They occurred at
  odd times and in odd places, and the instructor was always Shorty Bill
  personally.</p>

  <p>"Some men," he would say, "like killing with a rifle; I do for one. Some
  like killing with a revolver; not bad either, and essential, son, when you're
  out on the tiles by night and can't carry a rifle. A rifle is a dam nuisance
  at night if one's on patrol, whatever any one says to the contrary. An' if
  you don't carry a gun you can't use a bayonet, which is a beautiful method of
  sticking 'em." Shorty thoughtfully removed his pipe. "I was almost converted
  to the bayonet one day by a pal of mine. He's dead now, poor devil, but he
  lived well. He was givin' tongue over the beauties of picking Huns out of
  dug-out entrances with the bayonet like winkles out of their shells with a
  pin. Gosh! it was great&mdash;that boy's palaver. He almost converted me, an'
  then I showed him a couple o' little stunts of mine." Shorty put his pipe in
  his pocket. "Come here, son, an' pay attention. It was through forgetting in
  the excitement of the moment and not payin' attention that my pal the winkle
  plucker went west."</p>

  <p>Thus the mysterious lesson would start. "There'll come a time one night,
  boy, when you're out in the dark, an' you're crawling near the wire, when
  you'll feel on a sudden there's some one near you. Maybe, by the smell of
  him, you'll know it's a Boche. Well&mdash;then it's up to you to make good.
  You can plug him with your hand gun when you've got his dirty face dead set;
  but if you start shooting practice in No Man's Land, the audience join in. So
  I'll just show you a couple o' little tricks&mdash;silent tricks, which you
  can use when you get your hands on him. They kill just as clean if not
  cleaner than a gun, and no one's the wiser. Now come at me as if you meant to
  hurt me. No; not as if you were out pushing the baby in the pram, but just as
  if you was goin' all out to kill me. That's better, son; an' where are you
  now?"</p>

  <p>To be correct our one and only Reginald was lying on his face with the
  unpleasant knowledge in his brain that if he moved an inch his left arm would
  snap at the elbow; and that kneeling above him Shorty held, in the
  neighbourhood of his ear, a villainous weapon of his own invention, which
  resembled a cross between a bill-hook and a kukri.</p>

  <p>"You see the idea, boy, don't you? Now, you ask him if he'd like to
  surrender, and if you don't understand what he says or he seems doubtful
  like, put your clasp knife in there." Reginald felt a prick under his right
  ear. "Right in&mdash;you take me. Get up, and we'll do it again."</p>

  <p>"Where did you learn that, Shorty?" asked our pupil as he got up.</p>

  <p>"A Jap taught me that an' a good few more in Los Angeles. Jujitsu, he said
  it was; dam good sense I call it. Come on&mdash;it takes practice."</p>

  <p>And Reginald Simpkins practised. With growing confidence he practised day
  in, day out. Mogg's had faded into the limbo of forgotten things; his horizon
  consisted of a foetid shell hole, a panting, writhing Hun fighting for his
  life in the darkness of the night, a cracking arm and then... His imagination
  never took him beyond that point. Sufficient of the old Adam of gentility
  still remained to prevent him picturing the final tableau. You see, Reginald
  Simpkins had not as yet killed anything larger than a rat, and even then he
  had bungled....</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap303"
     name="chap303">III. &mdash; AN IMPERSONAL DEMONSTRATION</a></h2>

  <p class="first">As was proper and fitting his first head was gained cold-
  bloodedly and from a distance. It was his blooding into the ranks of the
  snipers. His probationary period was over; Shorty Bill had professed himself
  satisfied. The battalion had moved from the place in which we found them, and
  had gone farther north. The country was flat and desolate; periodically the
  ground would shake and tremble, and in No Man's Land chalk and rubble and the
  salmon-pink fumes of ammonal would shoot upwards, showing that the men of the
  underworld still carried on. Slag-heaps, sandbags, and desolate mounds of
  earth formed the scenery for his debut, while the orchestra consisted of rum
  jars and rifle grenades.</p>

  <p>D Company it was who had lost a sergeant through a German sniper; and the
  fact was duly reported. Now when a German sniper takes the life of a man in a
  battalion which goes in for the art itself, it is an unwritten law that from
  that moment a blood feud exists between the German and English snipers
  opposite. Though it takes a fortnight to carry out, yet death is the only
  finish.</p>

  <p>Wherefore, one morning, just as the first pale glints of dawn came
  stealing over the silent land, Reginald Simpkins climbed carefully into a
  great mound of sandbags which had conveniently been deposited just behind the
  front line by the miners. But it is doubtful if Miss Belsize of the camisole
  department would have recognised him. No longer the frock coat and pearl tie,
  no longer the patent-leather boots and immaculate trousers. In their place a
  dirty-faced man in khaki, tastefully draped in flapping sandbags&mdash; his
  boots covered, his hands stained. Very cautiously he made himself
  comfortable; with immense care he laid his rifle&mdash;also covered with
  sacking&mdash;in the direction he required; and then he covered his front and
  sides with filled bags. Through a hole&mdash;also carefully
  arranged&mdash;his screened telescope covered the bit of German trench where
  the day before the German sniper had lain. Then he waited.</p>

  <p>The mists cleared away; the morning sun shone down. From his point of
  vantage&mdash;for he was seven or eight feet above the trenches
  below&mdash;he watched the German lines. His fingers itched to pull the
  trigger two or three times; and once when he saw a German officer come out of
  his dug-out in the second line and lean against the back of the trench,
  smoking a fat cigar, he almost yielded to the temptation. But the splintering
  of a periscope glass below him, as a German bullet hit it, told him that the
  sniper was there&mdash;hidden somewhere, and watching too; and he knew that,
  perfect though his position was for one shot, that one shot would probably
  give him away. And that <i>one</i> shot was for the sniper, and not to be
  wasted on a fat Ober Lieutenant....</p>

  <p>Three or four hours passed, and the silence was complete. The perspiration
  trickled down his neck as he lay there motionless and clouded the eyepiece of
  his telescope. Then suddenly he saw a little black object shoot up into the
  air from the junction of two trenches near the German support line&mdash;an
  object which turned over and over in the air, and fell with a soft thud fifty
  yards to his right. A roar&mdash;and some sandbags and lumps of chalk flew in
  all directions, while fragments pattered down on Reginald out of the sky.</p>

  <p>"Hope to God they don't come any closer," he muttered, watching the next
  rum jar shoot up. "Anyway, I've marked the place they're coming from." Then
  his eyes came back to the sniper's locality, and as they did so a quiver of
  excitement ran through him. Utterly regardless of the second rum jar which
  burst with a crack behind him, he knew for the first time the feeling of the
  big game man who has stalked his quarry successfully. There, five yards to
  the left of where he had been looking, a little stunted bush was
  moving&mdash; <i>and there was no wind</i>. Trembling with excitement he
  focussed his telescope on the bush, and even as he did so, he knew his vigil
  was over. The thing which up to that moment he had taken for a log was a
  man&mdash; <i>the</i> man, the sniper. He could see the faint outline of his
  face, now that his attention was drawn to it, and with infinite care he drew
  a bead on the centre of it. Then suddenly he started shaking with nervous
  keenness; his left hand wobbled like a jelly through sheer excitement until
  he almost sobbed with rage. The German moved again as another rum jar burst,
  confident that the English would have gone to ground to escape the trench
  mortaring. It was that arrogant movement that infuriated our friend. It
  struck him as a deliberate challenge. And for just a moment the German's face
  and the crossed hairs of his telescopic sight coincided, and coincided
  steadily.</p>

  <p>It seemed to Reginald that his pressing the trigger and the wild
  convulsive lurch of the man opposite were simultaneous. With his eye to the
  telescope he watched the log that writhed and squirmed; then it grew still,
  and the disguise had gone. No more a log: just a motionless twisted form;
  while something that showed dark and ominous through the telescope spread
  round its head. The sergeant of D Company was avenged....</p>

  <p>With a feeling rather as if he personally had won the war, our hero
  slipped backwards into the boyau beside him, and went in search of Shorty
  Bill. Two hours later he found him and poured out the story. Shorty listened
  in silence; then he spoke.</p>

  <p>"I've heard men talk like you, son, when they've kissed their first woman.
  Have you reported where that trench mortar is?"</p>

  <p>"God! Shorty, I clean forgot. I'll go and do it now," remarked Reggie, his
  ardour somewhat damped.</p>

  <p>"I should dam well think you'd better." Shorty relit his pipe, and grinned
  amiably. "Well done, kid; but for Holy Mike's sake don't crow over one plurry
  Boche. When you've touched three figures we'll celebrate...."</p>

  <p>He may have been right; but even on his own showing, is there any kiss
  which is quite like the first? Is there any Hun, who&mdash;? Still, possibly
  the analogy is unfortunate. Anyway, I have given the account of his first
  cold-blooded victim; I will follow with his first hot-blooded one.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap304"
     name="chap304">IV. &mdash; SOMEWHAT MORE PERSONAL</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It occurred about six weeks later in the same part of the
  line; and as a mark of special favour he had been allowed to accompany Shorty
  on one of his nightly prowls. That worthy was wont to remark that two men on
  a joy ride in No Man's Land was one too many; wherefore it must be assumed
  that Reginald had grown in wisdom and cunning, and found favour in the sight
  of his taskmaster.</p>

  <p>They slipped over the top about ten p.m. Shorty was armed as usual merely
  with the villainous billhook-kukri of his own design, while Reggie carried a
  revolver and a clasp knife which resembled a young bayonet. It was not a
  reconnoitring patrol as laid down in the book of the words; it was merely a
  pleasure ramble, so Shorty said, as they passed silently out of a sap and
  disappeared in the darkness.</p>

  <p>The first thing Reggie did was to kick a tin and fall into a shell hole,
  where he was joined by Shorty.</p>

  <p>"Frightening rooks, son," he remarked kindly, "or rehearsing as a
  knockabout comedian? About twenty-five yards from here on our left is the
  German sap party that I am visiting tonight. I like 'em to know I'm
  coming."</p>

  <p>"Sorry, Shorty," muttered the delinquent. "I never saw the ruddy
  thing."</p>

  <p>"You don't say. I thought you'd a-done it on purpose," returned the other
  with ponderous sarcasm. "Now you stop here; I'm goin' to that sap&mdash; an'
  I'll come back for you."</p>

  <p>Like a wraith Shorty faded into the night, leaving our friend alone with
  his thoughts. A Lewis gun was firing away down the line in short bursts,
  while Verey lights and flares went up every now and then with a faint hiss.
  Above, the low-flying clouds scudded over the sky, and our friend lay back in
  his shell hole and pondered. With an inward chuckle he wondered what the
  beautiful Miss Belsize and the other fair ones of Mogg's would say if they
  could see him at that moment. A sense of physical well-being was on him, and
  he stretched himself luxuriously. The next instant he was struggling
  impotently in a grip that throttled him.</p>

  <p>"Quite so," remarked a voice as the grip relaxed, and by the light of a
  flare he found Shorty occupying the shell hole once again. "A ruddy lot o'
  good you are. Killed and dead as mutton by now, if I'd been a Boche."</p>

  <p>Reggie reddened in the darkness with shame. "I wasn't thinking, Shorty.
  I&mdash;er..." His words died away.</p>

  <p>"Thinking! You flat-footed clam&mdash;this show ain't a debating society,
  nor yet a penny reading." Shorty snorted with rage. "Go over to that saphead
  there&mdash;d'you see it&mdash;an' see what thinking does." His hand pointed
  to a low hummock of chalk behind a crater. "Go an' look in, I tell you; an'
  if ever you sit out here again dreaming like a love-sick poet, I hope to God
  it happens to you. You'll deserve it."</p>

  <p>With a push like the kick of an elephant's hind leg he propelled the
  wretched Reggie in the required direction. Puzzled and surprised, but feeling
  very ashamed of himself, he moved cautiously towards the low mound that stood
  up dimly outlined against the night sky. Once on the short journey he
  crouched motionless while a flare burnt itself out twenty yards away, only to
  move forward immediately the darkness settled again with quickened step.
  There is no time so good to movement as the few seconds after the eyes of
  possible watchers have been dazzled....</p>

  <p>And so he came to the saphead, and cautiously peered in. Under ordinary
  circumstances his action was that of a fool; but Shorty had ordered, and
  those who knew Shorty got in the habit of carrying out his instructions. For
  a while in the blackness he could see nothing. He noted the sap running back
  towards the German lines; but at the head of it there was no sign of life. He
  carefully stretched farther over, and as he looked at the bottom of the
  trench he made out a dark, huddled figure. Then the next flare went up, and
  Reginald Simpkins got the shock of his life.</p>

  <p>The green ghostly light came flooding in, and then went out as abruptly as
  it had come. But the moment was enough. Clear stamped on his brain, like a
  photographic exposure, was the image of two men. One lay at the bottom of the
  trench and grinned at the sky with his throat cut from ear to ear; the
  other&mdash;huddled in a corner with his hand still clutching a bomb&mdash;
  was even as he looked turning on his head and his knees, only to subside with
  a squelch in the mud, kick spasmodically, and lie still.</p>

  <p>"Right in&mdash;you take me?&mdash;with your clasp knife." Shorty's words
  came back to him and he gasped. So this was what his teacher had meant, when
  he'd sent him to see the dangers of thinking.</p>

  <p>It was just as he was visualising the scene: the sudden ghostly appearance
  of Shorty on top of the unsuspecting Germans; the sudden stroke of that awful
  weapon; the feeble attempt to get the bomb; the&mdash;well, it was just then
  that Reggie found himself contemplating from about six inches range the
  glaring face of a Prussian N.C.O. who had suddenly materialised. By the light
  of a flare down the line he watched, as he lay on top of the ground, with his
  head over the edge of the sap, the ring of the Prussian's revolver as it
  moved up towards his face.</p>

  <p>What happened, happened quickly: most of these things are touch and go.
  The bullet whizzed past his face into the night&mdash;his left hand hit the
  revolver just in time; and even as the bullet went wide his right hand struck
  sideways with the knife. It sank into the Prussian's neck; he felt a rush of
  something warm and sticky, and then he was grabbed from behind.</p>

  <p>"Quick," muttered Shorty in his ear, "hop it; hop it like hell. I'll guide
  you."</p>

  <p>Blinded and dazed by the blast of the revolver, he stumbled mechanically
  after his leader. "Into this shell hole for a moment," whispered Bill
  imperatively, as a machine gun let drive with a few rounds which passed over
  them like a flight of cockchafers. "Now come on. Home this trip, my
  boy&mdash;I didn't know that swab was there...."</p>

  <p>"I killed him, Bill," said Reginald, half an hour later, as he sat rubbing
  his eyes on the fire step of their own trenches to get the stinging of the
  cordite out.</p>

  <p>"You done well, son," said Bill; "an' if any one doubts it&mdash; show 'em
  your hand."</p>

  <p>By the light of a match Reggie looked at it, and he shuddered. It bore, as
  Bill implied, the proof of death.</p>

  <p>He was silent too awhile; the first hot-blooded one is more rattling to
  the nerves than a stranger three hundred yards away. Then a great thought
  struck him, and he cursed.</p>

  <p>"I've left my knife in his neck, Bill. What a blasted idiot!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap305"
     name="chap305">V. &mdash; A PROJECT AND SOME SIDE-ISSUES</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It is quite possible that there are some who, having read
  thus far, will consider that the education of Reginald Simpkins as a soldier
  was now complete. Transformed from a dreadful being who cut up silks and
  things and discoursed on the merits of what I understand is known as
  lingerie, he had become a man: a man with a quick hand and a sure eye, a man
  who had met one of his kind in fair fight and killed him. In his mind there
  had been born pride&mdash;the right sort of pride. Not the spurious article
  which had passed for it at Mogg's&mdash;that unpleasant type of conceit of
  which pimples and a high collar are the outward and visible sign. No, not
  that at all. He had cast that off with his frock coat, and in its place had
  grown the inherent pride which is the birthright of a <i>man</i>.</p>

  <p>It was just because the metamorphosis had been so complete, and the growth
  had been so rapid, that his education was by no means finished. It had only
  just begun.</p>

  <p>So far I have dealt principally with one phase in the gentle game of war:
  the phase that concerns itself with outing the wily Hun by means of a rifle
  bullet. True, Reginald had tasted of other pleasant methods under the kindly
  guidance of Shorty Bill; he had even gone so far as to enter into wordy
  warfare with the battalion exponent of bayonet fighting with regard to the
  relative merits of the bayonet G.S. and the weapon that he had presented to
  the Huns on his night prowl. In fact, our friend was beginning to hold
  opinions&mdash;and quite decided opinions&mdash;of his own. He was still in
  his infancy, I admit; but to those who were privileged to watch his growth he
  seemed a hopeful specimen. The seed appeared to be falling on good soil.</p>

  <p>But it may be remembered that with regard to the question of the sower,
  the seed which fell on stony ground appeared good for a time, until it was
  found that there was nothing behind it. Precocity is a dangerous thing, and
  in his new school Reginald was certainly precocious. Nowadays it is necessary
  to form judgments quickly in the Army: the game is being played at such high
  pressure. And so mistakes are bound to occur, though the Honourable James
  Lascelles disliked making them now, just as much as he did in the days when
  he could take his time.</p>

  <p>The thing in question at the moment was the fitness of our friend for the
  stripe when a vacancy occurred; and the Honourable Jimmy, being the Adjutant
  of the South Devons, and having the headquarter specialists under his eye,
  was somewhat intimately concerned with the solution of the question. I think
  I have failed to mention previously that it was the South Devons that
  Reginald adorned&mdash;that celebrated regiment known to the Army and the
  world at large by the more familiar soubriquet of the "Stick 'em and be
  damned."</p>

  <p>So when the edict of Toby Seymour, the C.O., went forth, the Adjutant
  seized the opportunity of trying to find out a little more fully whether it
  really was good soil in Reginald's case, or whether it was stony. Today the
  edict would seem almost a matter of routine; at that time things were
  different. Toby ordered a raid, and it was so.</p>

  <p>It was to be a raid on a large scale: no isolated affair like the
  pilgrimages of Shorty Bill, but an affair where the enemy's trenches were to
  be entered by a large party. No silent, stealthy work, but a thorough good
  jolly, with bombs and noises complete.</p>

  <p>Today raids are stale, and things of but little account. Sometimes the bag
  is large, and sometimes the bag is small; but the performance occurs twice
  nightly, with frequently a matinee thrown in. Then they were something new,
  and enterprises to be talked about.</p>

  <p>The project first took concrete form in the back room of a certain
  estaminet which served as the Headquarters mess when the battalion was
  resting after a spell in the trenches. The omelette had been successful, the
  port had recently arrived, and that pleasing, though somewhat selfish, glow
  which comes even to the best of us when we realise that it is the other
  fellow who is out in the cold wet night permeated the room.</p>

  <p>"Sarah Jane," remarked Toby to his second-in-command, as he thoughtfully
  sipped his port, "I have been thinking."</p>

  <p>"Have you, dear old soul? That's very jolly."</p>

  <p>"I have been thinking," went on the C.O., "that the boys require waking
  up. There is a danger of their degenerating into trench machines. They want
  ginger."</p>

  <p>The second-in-command looked at his Colonel keenly. "I agree with you," he
  returned after a short silence. "But it's rather hard to give 'em anything to
  ginger with in the middle of winter and in this locality. The division will
  probably be pulling out to train shortly, and then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;that won't do," Toby interrupted him. "I don't mean that sort of
  ginger. How many men of this battalion feel instinctively, and know as a
  positive fact, that&mdash;man for man&mdash;they are better than the Huns?
  That's the point, and training behind won't help that; at least, it won't
  start it. Once give it to them as a foundation, and the training will gain
  five hundred per cent. in its value."</p>

  <p>"True, O king, but how?"</p>

  <p>"They must fight the Germans, and find out for themselves. We've got some
  new drafts, Sarah&mdash;quite a number of new drafts who not only have never
  fought the Hun, but who have never even seen him. Their horizon is bounded by
  a dirty sandbag and a smell; and I maintain that their value as fighting
  troops is not one quarter what it might be."</p>

  <p>He carefully lit his pipe while the rest of the mess watched him
  curiously&mdash;wondering what was in his mind.</p>

  <p>"Listen to me, you fellows." Toby leant forward in his chair and
  emphasised his remarks with his ancient and powerful briar. "Every one in
  this room is&mdash;for want of a better word&mdash;blooded. We have all,
  thank Heavens! had the unforgettable pleasure of killing Huns at close
  quarters, with our own hands. Now that broadens one's horizon at once. We are
  not bounded by sandbags and stinks; when we are in the trenches, we
  know&mdash;our imagination tells us&mdash;that over the way are men whom we
  can visualise: living, actual beings whose ideal and object in life is to
  kill us. Not so, I regret to say, with a new draft: how can you expect it? To
  them the Hun is a strange something living in a trench, whom they never see,
  and whom they don't particularly want to. One might almost say that 'live and
  let live' is bound to be the way they look at life at present. Until the
  terrier sees the rat he has no wish to kill it; and until he has killed it he
  has no idea what a delightful occupation it is. Same with the men; and we've
  got to alter it."</p>

  <p>"Bravely spoken, sir, as the poets would say," remarked the Honourable
  James. "The only point is how to do it."</p>

  <p>"Easy as falling off a log. One night we will pay the Huns a visit and
  kill 'em. Cheery amusement, charming hobby. The terriers will get bitten on
  the nose, and as soon as that happens they'll see red. Then they'll start to
  kill; and once they've done that there will be no holding them. Their tails
  will be stickin' up above their heads."</p>

  <p>"It was done a few weeks ago up the line, wasn't it?" The second-in-
  command thoughtfully replenished his glass.</p>

  <p>"I believe it was&mdash;but what matter? The Stick'ems don't require any
  damned pilot for their fences." The C.O. brought a fist like a leg of mutton
  down on the table. "Before the division leaves the line, we are going to
  visit the Hun; we are going to kill the Hun; we are going to capture the
  swab, to wound him, to out him; and when we've done it and got him as wild as
  a civet cat in the nesting season, we'll laugh at him by platoons."</p>

  <p>"Prolonged applause from a breathless audience," laughed the Adjutant. "We
  can merely murmur a Benedictined Bismillah."...</p>

  <p>Now it is possible that to those who sit at home, and regard war from
  armchairs as a movement of little flags on a large-scale map, the words of
  Toby Seymour may come in the nature of a surprise. It is possible that they
  have never really thought about the human side of killing: of killing as a
  hobby&mdash;as a trade. Vaguely they realise that a soldier does not go into
  the army to pick buttercups; vaguely they understand that men die and are
  killed in war, and that soldiers are the people who kill and are killed. But
  I venture to think that they do not realise the intense importance of
  inculcating in every private soldier the necessity and the desire of outing
  the other fellow. Horrible, you say; revolting. Of course it's horrible, my
  good man; of course it's revolting; but what the devil do you think this war
  is&mdash; minding a crþche for imbecile children? <i>You</i> bring in a crowd
  of men whose sole qualification in August 1914 to be considered soldiers was
  an intense and national love of games. <i>You</i> pit them against a machine
  perfect in technique, in which every part had been trained from earliest
  infancy in the trade of soldiering, and the trade of ruthless killing.</p>

  <p><i>You</i> ask them to go across the water and beat this machine for
  <i>you</i>. And so, if I harry you at times with details of the type blood-
  curdling, it is only that you may understand something of the nature of the
  task: the task which <i>your</i> brothers and sons and partners and clerks
  are carrying to a successful issue.</p>

  <p>Has it occurred to you why they are succeeding?</p>

  <p>You say that right is triumphing over might; that a good cause must win.
  It is beautiful, it is magnificent your contention; but it is not war.
  History does not support you; common sense does not bear you out. We are
  beating them because as a nation of sportsmen the men have taken to the new
  sport as a duck takes to water; and the new sport is to kill, capture, wound,
  or out the Boche before he kills, captures, wounds, or outs you. And having
  taken to it as a sport, now that the technique and other things are equal, we
  are better at it than the Hun who views it as a business.</p>

  <p>Which recalls to mind the celebrated utterance of a celebrated officer.
  Should he read these lines, I trust he will pardon the plagiarism; but the
  utterance was so wonderful that it should be perpetuated, even thus modestly.
  He spoke lightly; but if I may be forgiven the platitude, there is many a
  true word spoken in jest.</p>

  <p>Why not institute, he suggested, a list of battalion averages? Just as the
  relative position of Tottenham Hotspur and Sheffield Wednesday in the
  Football League is the subject of frenzied back chat; just as the defeat of
  Yorkshire by Kent causes head shakings in the public-houses of the North
  towards the end of August, why not have a league of battalions?</p>

  <p>A wonderful idea if one thinks into it. A dead'un two points, a prisoner
  one; the Ober-lieutenant five points and a Colonel twenty&mdash;with other
  grades according to fancy. Think of the frantic excitement in the London
  clubs and the quiet villages when the relative scoring merits of a Jaeger
  sharpshooter and a one-eyed Landsturmer were sized up. Think of the Putney
  Peashooters' ladies meeting those of the Shoreditch Snipers at a small and
  early, and counting up the bag: five Saxons and a stretcher-bearer against
  four prisoners and a carrier pigeon.</p>

  <p>One might almost wind up with England versus Scotland, the winner to play
  Australia on a percentage basis. In fact, there is no limit to it; and I will
  cease, lest I get lost in a maze of wonderful developments.</p>

  <p>I will cease, and return to the Stick'ems; but as a last word I would say,
  in all seriousness, that wildly farcical though that celebrated utterance may
  be, there underlies it an absolutely true valuation of the fundamental
  bedrock of war. To emulate the deeds of others and go one better, to put the
  men in good heart with their tails up, that is the secret of winning. And the
  best way of doing it is to treat the matter as a sport: the Englishman
  understands it that way best....</p>

  <h2><a id="chap306"
     name="chap306">VI. &mdash; THE SECOND LESSON, AND<br>
  SOME FURTHER SIDE-ISSUES</a></h2>

  <p class="first">No Man's Land in that part of the line where the South
  Devons resided was wide&mdash;well over a quarter of a mile to be exact.
  Across their front, about a hundred and fifty yards from the German lines,
  there ran a small bank two or three feet high, with its right resting on a
  main road which crossed No Man's Land, and its left gradually falling away
  till it came level with the ground. The remnants of a hedge and two or three
  forlorn tree stumps still remained on the bank, over the top of which could
  be seen the German wire&mdash;running round a small orchard in which lay
  their front line trenches. The locality was peaceful; the Hun was quiet,
  asking for nothing more than that he should be left alone, which undoubtedly
  made Toby Seymour's breach of the rules the more reprehensible from the
  exclusively Teuton point of view. They were extremely angry; in fact, one
  large prisoner went so far as to state that it was a barbarous method of
  fighting, and unheard of in civilised warfare. The suggestion that he should
  be kept as the battalion mascot and supply the comic relief at all subsequent
  smoking concerts, unfortunately fell through. Other "non-barbarians" who
  escaped joining him in captivity emulated his altruistic spirit by informing
  the South Devons daily from a position where the lines ran close together,
  that they were looking forward to crucifying the next Englishman they caught,
  which again was an immense success, and was greeted invariably by a specially
  selected choir chanting the Hymn of Hate. And yet the damage done was not
  very great from the material point of view. It was the mental jolt, the jar
  to their spiritual loftiness, that tickled the dear souls up....</p>

  <p>Now primarily my story concerns Reginald Simpkins and his transformation
  to manhood. And therefore, before I tell of the raid itself, I will touch on
  one or two matters concerning that transformation, and the methods of the
  Honourable James.</p>

  <p>D Company won the toss, so to speak, and was deputed to perform; and
  Reginald Simpkins was not in D Company. Being a sniper, he was attached to
  that mystic band of specialists who adorn battalion headquarters. And so, one
  morning, the snipers were assembled and the Adjutant gazed at them benignly
  through his eyeglass.</p>

  <p>"D Company are going to raid the Huns," he remarked. "I want six
  volunteers to go with them." The result was as he anticipated. "I said six,
  not the whole bunch," he continued genially, "so I'll have to draw lots."</p>

  <p>Now nothing would induce me to hint that everything was not perfectly
  square in that drawing, but&mdash;Reginald Simpkins was one of the six. In
  due course his part in the programme was explained to him, and during the
  explanation his face became more and more suggestive of a street corner on a
  rainy day.</p>

  <p>"You understand what you have to do, Simpkins?" The Honourable James
  looked at him keenly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, I understand; but&mdash;but&mdash;ain't I to have a go at the
  swine at all?" Our friend's grievance boiled over. "Can't I just go into the
  trench once and have a go at them? It'll be a bit hard sitting by the tree
  stump, and hearing the boys at it, and having to ...." His words died away
  under the steady glance of the man opposite.</p>

  <p>"And because it's a bit hard, you don't want to do it?"</p>

  <p>"It ain't that, sir, it's&mdash;it's&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, what is it? Not the showy part of the performance, eh? Not the part
  where the fun comes&mdash;sitting by a bank and taking the roll as they come
  back. But some one has to do it&mdash;why not you?"</p>

  <p>The second lesson in the making of a soldier&mdash;subordination of
  self.... As a matter of fact there was no reason why Reginald should have
  been deputed to the job: there were many others who could have done it
  equally well if not better. But the Honourable Jimmy had his own
  methods....</p>

  <p>The desire for the game was there in the pupil: that he knew: the point
  was whether the character which would suppress and master that desire when
  necessary was there too. Could reliability be added to keenness? ...</p>

  <p>That was what the Adjutant wished to find out. He knew that our friend
  was&mdash;in the vernacular&mdash;throwing a chest. He knew that lately,
  well, Reginald Simpkins had been rather full of&mdash;Reginald Simpkins.
  Adjutants&mdash;good Adjutants&mdash;do know these things. Which was all to
  the good&mdash;within certain limits....</p>

  <p>An unpromising subject had learned the first lesson of the soldier: would
  he be able to learn the second, without which the third and greatest would be
  impossible? All soldiers must learn the first lesson; only a limited number
  can learn the second and third.</p>

  <p>So it came about that for the good of his soul Reginald played a very
  minor part in this raid, and my information on the doings that occurred in
  the Hun lines was obtained from the lips of one Samuel Pipston, sometime
  auctioneer's assistant, who had joined the battalion with the last draft. He
  was just a second Reginald&mdash;one stage behind him in development, that's
  all&mdash;an apathetic lad, finding war a tedious operation.</p>

  <p>It was not until ten o'clock on the night, as he lay with his party behind
  the bank of which I have spoken, that a pleasurable thrill of anticipation
  began to take hold of Samuel. A slight frost nip was in the air, and in the
  sky there shone a myriad stars. Away behind him lay the trenches he had just
  quitted, peaceful and still in the faint moonlight; and looking to his front
  he could see the German lines, just as still, only much closer. He tried to
  realise that he was shortly going to be inside those trenches, and that when
  he got there he would meet real live men, who would endeavour to
  kill&mdash;him, Samuel Pipston. He thought of Mary Johnston, the daughter of
  the leading grocer, and wondered what she was doing at the moment, and what
  she would think if&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Don't shoot&mdash;for God's sake&mdash;not a sound."</p>

  <p>With a start Samuel heard the hoarse whisper of a subaltern beside him,
  and became suddenly aware that a struggle was going on two or three yards
  away. He peered eagerly in the direction of the noise, and saw three men in a
  confused mass heaving on the ground behind the bank.</p>

  <p>"What the devil&mdash;" he muttered, and then the heaving ceased. In the
  dim light he saw a still figure lying on the ground, and two men crouching
  over him. "Someone 'ad a fit, I reckons," he whispered to the man next him,
  an old hand at the game.</p>

  <p>"Fit be blowed. It's a 'Un, yer fool&mdash;or was before he 'opped it.
  He's dead."</p>

  <p>"A 'Un!" Samuel gazed stupidly at the speaker, and then peered at the
  motionless figure. "Wot's the sargint a-doin' of."</p>

  <p>A low question came from the officer. "Have you killed him, Melstead?"</p>

  <p>"I have that, sir; but I can't get my perishing bayonet out. Put your foot
  on his chest, Charlie, and heave. Again, so, heave." The sergeant sat down
  suddenly as the bayonet came out, and immediately crawled to the subaltern.
  "There'll be another with him, sir, for a cert." The two peered over the bank
  towards the German lines, while drawn by an irresistible impulse Samuel crept
  towards the dead man. He peered into the distorted face, he looked at the
  still twitching body, and an uncontrollable fit of shuddering took him and
  gripped him. His knees knocked together; his tongue stuck to the roof of his
  mouth; and only one coherent thought hammered at his brain.</p>

  <p>"Lemme get away; it's awful. Gawd! it's awful. Lemme go." He was
  whispering and muttering to himself, and Heaven knows what might have
  happened, because there are moments when a man is not responsible for his
  actions, when a large body hit him on the head, and he found himself at the
  bottom of a mass of struggling, kicking men.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact it was merely the expected arrival of number two of
  the German patrol, and he could not have selected a better place to come to
  as far as Samuel was concerned. There is no better banisher of knocking knees
  than a heavy kick in the ribs from a German boot, and in an instant our
  friend was fighting like a tiger cat.</p>

  <p>"Quietly, quietly, for the love of Heaven." The officer's insistent voice
  reached him, and he felt for the German's mouth with his hands. He was lying
  on his back, and the Hun was on top of him; but beyond that, the only other
  clear remembrance of the episode he has is of a fine and complete set of
  teeth nearly meeting in his hand. That was enough; one new terrier at any
  rate was blooded. He don't quite know how he killed him; in fact, it is quite
  on the cards that it wasn't he who killed him at all. The fact remains that
  the German died; and whether it was the sergeant, or whether it was the
  subaltern, or whether it was Samuel, is immaterial. All that matters is that
  as far as motive and endeavour went Samuel Pipston killed his first rat, and
  gloried in the operation. Such is the effect of mistaking the thumb of even
  our nearest and dearest for a ration biscuit....</p>

  <p>Thus ended the little episode of the German patrol. For months previously
  those two men, or others like them, had wandered over No Man's Land, and
  returned in due course to their sausage and their beer, with nothing of
  interest to report. Then, as the invariable rule of war, there came the
  hundredth time when the unexpected happened. Shells, bombs, bullets&mdash;
  they take the others and pass you by. But sooner or later, it will be "nah-
  poo." You can only pray Heaven it's a Blighty. With the German patrol, it was
  not.</p>

  <p>A whispered word came down the waiting line. "Get ready." All along the
  bank men tightened their belts and took a last look at their bombs and
  rifles. Two parties&mdash;each under a subaltern&mdash;were going to enter
  the German lines, while, as a reserve, the Company Commander, with a machine
  gun and some rifle grenadiers, <i>and</i> Reginald Simpkins were remaining at
  the bank. The two parties were going to enter at different points and move
  towards one another, the leading men of each ceaselessly calling out, "'Ow's
  yer father?" Then when the mystic answer came, "Merry and bright," they would
  know they were meeting one another and be careful with their bombs. <i>En
  passant</i>, it is not too easy to recognise who's who at night in a strange
  trench when every one is somewhat excited.</p>

  <p>"Are you all ready, 'A' party? Then come on." Worming over the bank Samuel
  followed his subaltern into the darkness, and the raid had begun. Without a
  sound they approached the wire through which they had to cut, crawling as
  they had practised. Timed to a nicety they reached it and lay still, just as
  a couple of flashes from the rear proclaimed the gunners were beginning.
  Five&mdash;six&mdash;seven seconds, and with a shrill scream two shells
  whistled over their heads and burst fifty yards in front of them.</p>

  <p>"Come on." The whisper was hardly audible, and quite unnecessary: they had
  all been too well drilled. Snip&mdash;snip; the wire strands parted as they
  forced their way through to the silent lines, while the shells still moaned
  over their heads; and the German sentries, who had heard shells before and
  liked them no more than any one else, kept their heads down till the English
  swine should have concluded their nightly hate. Three minutes later the party
  dropped into a deserted bit of trench and the fun commenced....</p>

  <p>Samuel was a bomber, and he carried twenty of these pleasant little
  instruments as his stock in trade. With every nerve tingling with excitement
  he followed the officer in front of him, who with a couple of bayonet men
  headed the party. The first man they met was the sentry, who was crouching on
  the fire-step to avoid the shelling, and from that moment on&mdash;well,
  things hummed.</p>

  <p>The subaltern&mdash;an excitable youth&mdash;smiled genially at the dazed
  Bavarian, who was regarding the sudden invasion of his privacy as if it was a
  bad dream; and having shot him in the stomach, passed breezily on round the
  traverse, followed by his surging mob.</p>

  <p>"Picket the other entrance," he roared to those behind, as he stepped by
  the first shaft of a dug out, up which a man was rushing. "Come on, my pet,
  come on&mdash;roll, bowl, or pitch, it's a cocoa-nut to a berlud orange...."
  The man fell back with a bullet through his brain, and slid head down to the
  bottom of the shaft. "Bomb 'em, boys; bomb 'em."</p>

  <p>With a roar the bombs went off in the confined space below the ground; the
  lights went out, and a confused medley of shouts and groans followed them up
  the trench as they sought pastures new. Control was impossible: it was every
  man for himself, and to hell with everything he could see. Each man fought
  his own little battle, in his own little way, against one or two or three of
  the bewildered men who appeared suddenly from odd places. And though they
  were bewildered, they fought&mdash;those Huns: fought like good 'uns. In one
  corner a great burly miner grappled with a Bavarian N.C.O. who had suddenly
  dropped over the back of the trench armed only with a pick&mdash;straight
  from a working party. Farther on, the subaltern and a bayonet man carried on
  the good work with howls of joy, while a small party of bombers, having found
  a large sump pit covered by boards in a communication trench, removed the
  boards just in time to catch a relief party of six who came rushing up the
  trench. With a resounding splash they went through the ice several feet below
  the top of the hole, and were immediately joined by two bombs.</p>

  <p>As the corporal in charge of that party put it afterwards: "It was a good
  idea that sump 'ole; because them that wern't killed by the bombs was
  drowned, and the only one wot was neither, I 'it over the 'ead with me gun;
  and 'ere he is. Ain't 'e a little dear?" The little dear with a cracked jaw,
  and a face reminiscent of Hindenburg on the morning after, looked the
  part....</p>

  <p>But I have neglected Samuel Pipston. As I mentioned, he was a bomber, and
  he was also excited. In the general confusion and darkness he got parted from
  the rest of the gallant band, and found himself in a bit of trench alone save
  for a large and morose sapper who was tenderly nursing a mobile charge of
  several pounds of ammonal. Away in front the noise and shouting and the crack
  of bursting bombs was getting fainter, and Samuel was undecided. He had
  explored a little <i>cul-de-sac</i> on his own, and had drawn blank; and at
  the moment he was in the unfortunate predicament of thirsting for blood and
  being unable to get any. In front the trench was being cleared up; behind it
  had been cleared up; wherefore Samuel stood undecided, and cursed
  fluently.</p>

  <p>"Shut yer mouth"&mdash;the morose sapper gripped his arm&mdash; "an'
  listen. I heard some of the swine, I reckons."</p>

  <p>Silently the two men stood in the trench, and suddenly from close at hand
  there came the noise of a man climbing a dug-out shaft. It was exactly as a
  faint cry of "'Ow's yer father?" came from a long way off that a curtain just
  beside them moved, and a man, crouching slightly, came out of a screened dug-
  out shaft into the trench. It must be remembered that neither of our warriors
  had a rifle, and that bombs and ammonal charges are not weapons with which to
  tackle a man you can touch. They are apt to be impartial to friend and foe
  alike.... Resource was necessary, and it is at moments such as these that the
  national instinct for games is so invaluable. There was a psychological
  moment as the crouching man came up into the trench with his rifle and
  bayonet, when his chin was in the perfect position: moreover, the sapper was
  a full back of merit. He kicked hard and true, and if any one doubts the
  effect of a service boot on the point of the jaw, no doubt he can experiment
  with the matter&mdash;at a small cost. The Bavarian fell forward as if he had
  been pole-axed, and having relieved him of his rifle the sapper held
  forth.</p>

  <p>"There's a ruddy dug-out full of 'em, mate, wot was missed." They peered
  down the opening, where a faint light showed. "They think we've gone on, and
  they're coming up to see. Look, there's one."</p>

  <p>The shadow of a man showed grotesquely in the flickering light, and Samuel
  quivered with excitement.</p>

  <p>"I'm a-going down the plurry steps," he affirmed, "an' I'll bomb 'em from
  the bottom."</p>

  <p>The next instant he was down the shaft and peering cautiously round the
  corner; and having peered he let out one wild whoop and gently lobbed his
  first bomb into the far corner. It was a bomber's paradise.</p>

  <p>All round the walls in bunks were Bavarians&mdash;stout ones, thin ones,
  drunk ones, sober ones&mdash;and the bunks were arranged in tiers one above
  the other. Two men were up, getting on their equipment, and evidently
  preparing to sally forth after the gentleman upstairs; but after the first
  bomb burst the fog of war descended on that Hun hostel. Samuel had just time
  to see the fearful mess up in the far corner before the light went out, and
  then things moved. Shots came whizzing past his head into the woodwork of the
  shaft, but Samuel didn't care a damn for shots; had he not been bitten in the
  hand less than an hour previously? Methodically he pulled out pins, and
  impartially he distributed his favours in every direction, what time he
  softly sang a song that had long been one of his favourites, and which dealt
  with the singer's overmastering predilection for "fish and chips."</p>

  <p>Suddenly he found the sapper behind him. "Stand by to 'op it like a ruddy
  'are," remarked that worthy tersely. "I'm a going to give 'em my little
  present from Brighton, and it won't be 'ealthy when it goes off."</p>

  <p>There was a sudden sizzle as he lit the fuze, and he saw a stream of smoky
  light fly through the darkness and fall on to the ground in the centre of the
  dug-out. Then Samuel 'opped it, the sapper just behind him, up the shaft and
  into the trench. The sapper rushed him round a bend, and then crouched
  down.</p>

  <p>"Twenty seconds," he gasped, "an' me out of training. Lumme! wot a
  life."</p>

  <p>The next instant the ground quivered as if an earthquake had occurred; a
  thunderous roar shook the air, while the blast of the explosion nearly
  knocked them down.</p>

  <p>"Nothin' wrong with that there ammonal," remarked the Sapper
  professionally. "'Andy stuff it is too. Let's go and see what's
  'appened."</p>

  <p>But that they will never know. From the dug-out shaft a volume of smoke
  and dust was belching out, while from inside there came a medley of noises
  and grunts indicative of annoyance and pain.</p>

  <p>"Sounds like one of them there gramophone records, don't it?" murmured
  Samuel. "A summer morning, or the departure of a troop ship. Ain't it lovely?
  'Ullo, wot's that?"</p>

  <p>Clear above the din and the moaning, and the spasmodic fighting which they
  could still hear going on up the trench, there sounded the officers' dinner
  call. Twice it blared forth from the British lines, and every man knew what
  it meant: "Come back, at once." The raid was over....</p>

  <p>And so by ones and two and threes D Company returned to the fold, where
  hot tea and a noggin of rum awaited them, giving their names to Reginald on
  the way. To the casual observer it might have seemed that D Company were
  drunk&mdash;one and all. They were&mdash;but not with wine. They were drunk
  with excitement, and with the knowledge just acquired that they could beat
  the Germans, man-to-man. They were blooded.</p>

  <p>The lies they told&mdash;those cheery lads! Not a man had done in less
  than forty Boches, which rose to eighty when they wrote their girls. What
  matter? D Company of the Stick'em and be damned was made for life. The men
  walked three inches higher; the men, as men, had come into their own. Every
  new draft that came heard the story; every new draft realised it had got
  something to live up to. No longer sand bags and smells their horizon, but
  the memory of one glorious half-hour.</p>

  <p>And when he thought over it afterwards, there was only one small thing
  that struck Samuel Pipston as peculiar. He was just retailing to Reginald
  Simpkins&mdash;with some wealth of detail&mdash;his experiences in the German
  dug-out, when he became aware of the Honourable James beside him, who
  listened for a while until he had finished.</p>

  <p>"So you had a good time did you, Pipston?" he remarked. "Splendid!" Then
  he turned to Simpkins. "The Company Commander tells me you were a great help
  to him, checking the men as they came back. Well done."</p>

  <p>It struck Samuel that he might have had a "Well done."</p>

  <p>But then, he didn't know the Honourable Jimmy's methods; nor did he know
  that while he and those with him had merely learned the first and easiest
  lesson that night, Reginald Simpkins had learned the second.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap307"
     name="chap307">VII. &mdash; THE THIRD LESSON,<br>
  AND A DIGRESSION</a></h2>

  <p class="first">And so, with two of the lessons learned, we come to the
  third and greatest. The first was basely material, and was taught by Shorty
  Bill; the second was a little nearer the heart of things, and was taught by
  the Honourable James; the third is the heart of things, and can be taught by
  no one. The rules&mdash;vague rules&mdash;may be given by men who have
  learned it to those who have not; but its true meaning, its real
  significance, can only be reached by the pupil for himself. And there are
  many who fall by the way....</p>

  <p>It arises out of the second: it must be preceded by subordination of self.
  For until a man can subordinate himself, he cannot take on his shoulders the
  cares of others; he cannot put those others first, And until he can put
  others before him, he cannot be put in a position of responsibility: he is
  not fitted to fill it. And it is the principle of responsibility on which the
  British Army is built up: another thing about which I am very doubtful as to
  the knowledge of those whose paths have not led them near things
  military....</p>

  <p>I have touched on things material; let me hold forth awhile on things
  spiritual.</p>

  <p>What think you, my masters, is the driving force of a regiment in the
  field? The answer is in one word&mdash;Leadership. Quite so, you say; the
  remark seems to have been made before. It has, which makes it all the
  stranger that it is so little understood.</p>

  <p>What does the word mean to you? Prancing in front of the men with a drawn
  sword, shouting, "For King and Country"? They'd laugh at you, and follow
  a&mdash;leader: one of their own. Ruling by fear, ruthlessly without thought
  of human weakness, without tinge of mercy? They'd hate you, and you would
  have to drive them like the Prussians do. Ruling by pusillanimous kindness,
  by currying favour, by seeking to be a popularity Jack? They'd despise
  you&mdash;and rightly.</p>

  <p>The quality of leadership is none of these things: it is something much
  more simple, much more homely, if I may use the word. To lead men a man must
  first of all understand men, understand human nature; he must know his job,
  and know it better than his men; he must possess intensity of purpose.</p>

  <p>Human nature! What the men like and what they dislike; the little fetishes
  they put up, the little gods; the few words of praise when they have done
  well, of disappointment when they have not; consideration for them, giving
  them beer and concerts; being with them in the trenches when the weather is
  bad, and not in a dug-out. Little points perhaps, but it's the little points
  that are so important.</p>

  <p>Human sympathy&mdash;the appealing to the spark of better things that lies
  in the worst; the inculcation of an ideal to live up to&mdash;the ideal of
  the regiment. All the hundred and one things that go to make up a man's life
  and not an automaton's; all the things that make for the affection and love
  of those under you. It is a very great thing for an officer to be loved by
  his men....</p>

  <p>Knowledge! The capability of doing yourself anything you call on those
  under you to do; of showing them when they are right and when they are wrong;
  of making them trust your ability. It is a very great thing for an officer to
  be trusted by his men.</p>

  <p>Intensity of purpose! The driving force that gives enthusiasm, that causes
  the hand on the plough to remain there until the job is done; the quality
  that abhors vacillation, that prevents a man taking a thing up one moment
  with red-hot eagerness and dropping it the next because he's tired of it. The
  men despise vacillation and chopping and changing. Being "messed about," they
  call it; only the word is not messed. And it is a terrible thing for an
  officer to be despised by his men....</p>

  <p>From good leadership there springs good discipline, that other word so
  little understood by those who have not met it in the flesh. Not, believe me,
  the rigorous punishment for breaking certain arbitrary rules, enforced by an
  autocrat on men placed temporarily under him by a whim of fate; far from it.
  Discipline is merely the doctrine which teaches of the subordination of self
  for the whole; it teaches the doctrine of playing the game; it teaches the
  all-important fact that the fear of being found out and punished should
  <i>not be</i> the chief force in a man's life, but rather that the
  realisation of his responsibility should be the guiding factor.</p>

  <p>Such is the ideal aimed at in a good regiment. That there are some who
  miss that aim none but a fool would deny; the same may be said of most
  professions, even, I suppose, of bishops. That there are some officers who go
  the wrong way to work, who nag and bully and generally turn themselves into
  something even worse than nature intended is an undoubted fact. That there
  are some men who are wasters; who were born wasters and will die as such is
  also quite true. But I maintain that the training, the ideals, the
  traditions, the morale of the good British regiment does produce, and has
  produced, a growth of character and a condition of mind in the men who belong
  to it which was largely conspicuous by its absence in civil life.</p>

  <p>Why, I do not profess to say. Why the great thinkers and the vaporising
  burblers between them should not have hit on some method of training
  character which would have produced equally good results to those produced by
  what they are still pleased to call "militarism," I do not know. All that I
  do know is that they did not. Let us leave it at that.</p>

  <p>I have digressed; our Reginald is calling. For weeks his battalion was
  destined to remain in peace trenches, to live that dreary life of monotony
  which tests the capabilities of the leader as no big push can do. The
  excitement is absent, there is plenty of time&mdash;too much time&mdash;for
  thought. And boredom is of all things one of the hardest to combat. It calls
  for leadership of the highest type. There is many a man capable of supreme
  devotion in a crisis who is incapable of the steady, unseen strain, day in,
  day out, of keeping up his men's spirits&mdash;in fact, of appreciating human
  nature in one of its many phases.</p>

  <p>The men feel that dull routine on which the lime-light does not shine, and
  only the leader can help them. It claims its victims, just as do the big
  offensive, that trench life, when the flares lob up ceaselessly and the
  bursts of machine-gun fire come swishing over the ground. Here men are
  wiring; there is a party digging a new bit of trench; and out beyond&mdash;in
  No Man's Land&mdash;an officer and three scouts are creeping about examining
  the enemy's wire. So it goes on throughout the night, until as the first
  streaks of dawn show faintly in the east it ceases. The men come in, back to
  the dreary mud holes; and next night there is the same damned thing to be
  done all over again somewhere else....</p>

  <p>Only, Ginger won't be there any more; he has put up his last bit of wire.
  He started on the last journey unnoticed save by the man standing next him;
  and&mdash;Gawd above!&mdash;what's the use? They'd been together for two
  years, share and share alike; and now the end. Putting up a bit of rusty wire
  round a sap....</p>

  <p>"Easy, boy, easy. 'Ere, cut them ruddy braces away. 'Orl rite, old son,
  you've copped a Blighty. Thro' yer stummik&mdash;Gor luv yer&mdash; no. Get
  that dressing on, Bill; turn over, mate&mdash;we'll give yer a drink in a
  minute; but one thing at a time, old pal, that's my motto. Always merry and
  bright, as the perisher said in the play." Back in the trench, pulled in from
  the wire where the work goes on, an officer's electric torch shines on the
  stretcher bearers working with clumsy gentleness on the quivering body. "Now,
  then, mate, we can't get the blinking stretcher along this 'ere trench, so
  we'll 'ave to carry you."</p>

  <p>"Copped it?" asks an N.C.O. in a whisper.</p>

  <p>"Gawd! a fair crumpler," mutters the other. "Come on, Ginger, let's get
  off on the first stage for Blighty. On me back, we does it&mdash;on me back.
  'Ere, boy&mdash;lumme! turn 'im over, Bill." The torch shines down on the
  face upturned to the stars; the stretcher bearers bend down and suddenly
  straighten up again. For Ginger is even now passing along the last great
  road: he has copped it. The group disperse; the officer goes back to his job;
  the stretcher bearers do their work; and soon nothing remains save the stain
  on the dirty sandbags. Just another letter to a woman at home; just war.</p>

  <p>Only to his pal, it's Ginger: Ginger whom he'd joined up with;
  Ginger&mdash;killed putting up a bit of rusty wire. Not doing anything
  brilliant, not in a charge or going over the top, but putting up a bit of
  ruddy wire. What is the use of it all, what?...</p>

  <p>Come on, my leader; come on, you platoon commander; the soul of Ginger's
  pal is in the melting-pot, though he doesn't know it, and would curse in your
  face if you told him so. A quiet hand on the back, a laugh perhaps, just a
  word to show him that you feel with him. His outlook on life is not as big as
  yours; help him&mdash;for Heaven's sake, help him. Thus is it done if the
  leader of the regiment is a man of understanding; for each of his assistants,
  right down the long chain to the junior lance-corporal, have been imbued with
  their responsibility to those under them. They are there to help them, to
  lighten their burdens, to sink self for the men they lead. The strong must
  help the weak&mdash;that is the principle; and every one must pull his weight
  for the good of the team.</p>

  <p>But I have got off the rails again; I apologise.</p>

  <p>During those weeks of boredom, Reginald, though he knew it not, was being
  watched, still watched, by the Honourable James. And it seemed to that judge
  of character that the soil was good.</p>

  <p>"The Adjutant asked me if I'd like to take the stripe this morning,
  Shorty." Reginald and his pal were watching an inter-company football match
  on the ground by the Lens main road, near the little village of Noyelles-les-
  Vermelles. It is on the borders of the coal country&mdash;that village, and
  all around it rise the great pyramidical slag heaps of the pits.</p>

  <p>"Did 'e now?" Shorty contemplated with interest a shell bursting on the
  derelict fosse in the next village of Annequin, and turned thoughtfully to
  the speaker. "An' what did you say to him?"</p>

  <p>"I said I didn't want to. Why the devil should I? I don't want a stripe,
  Bill&mdash;I'm happier as I am. It means a lot of extra work an' trouble,
  an'&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Did you tell him that, son?" Shorty Bill hooked himself over on his arm
  and proceeded to fill his pipe.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I told him that: and he&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He did not finish his sentence for a moment or two; he seemed to be
  turning something over in his mind. Then he burst out: "He talked a lot of
  rot about responsibility."</p>

  <p>"Cut it out. It's you that is coughing up the rot. Listen here a moment,
  an' I'll tell you what the Honourable James said. Got a match?" He took the
  proffered box and carefully lit up. "He first-ways told you that he'd had his
  eye on you for some time, an' he was pleased with 'ow you was doing. That may
  have been a lie or it may not, but the Honourable Jimmy knows more'n one
  cottons to. Then he told you what a gran' thing it was to be in this
  regiment, and that to be in a position of responsibility was grander still.
  Then he told you that no man worthy of the name of a man ought to be afraid
  of shouldering responsibility. An' lastly he said: 'Will you take the
  stripe?'"</p>

  <p>Reggie was staring at the speaker amazed. "Lumme! you might have been
  there, Shorty. How did you know?"</p>

  <p>"Because he offered the same thing to me six months ago," returned the
  other shortly. "Now see here, boy: that there aristocratic Johnny is the
  goods. It don't matter a damn to me if a man's a duke or a coal-heaver as
  long as he's the goods, and the Honourable Jimmy is. So's the ole man. An'
  what he says&mdash;goes. He's right d'you see, son; he's right." Shorty
  brought his fist down into his open palm. "I've been watching you lately, an'
  you're worth teaching&mdash;you've shown that. But now you've begun to feel
  your legs, you're inclined to think you're a bit bigger cheese-mite than you
  really are. You want a bit o' sobering up; an' there's nothing like taking on
  responsibility to sober up a man. As soon as you start looking after other
  fellows, you begin to realise you ain't the Lord High Emperor of the whole
  outfit."</p>

  <p>"But I don't want to look after other fellows, Shorty." Our friend's tone
  was dubious. "Why, good Lord! I'd be bossing it over you if I took the
  stripe."</p>

  <p>An enigmatic smile wreathed gently over Shorty's face. "Don't you worry
  about that; I'll chance it." Then he turned suddenly on the man lying beside
  him. "You've got to take it&mdash;this bally little stripe in this funny old
  army. Otherwise you're a quitter&mdash;see? a quitter. You'd not be pullin'
  your weight. Do you get me?"</p>

  <p>"Right ho! Bill; I'll tell him I will." Reginald Simpkins stared silently
  at the football match for a while, and then a sudden thought struck him.
  "Say, why didn't <i>you</i> take it, Shorty?"</p>

  <p>"Never you mind; there are things as you can't get a hold of as yet. I
  pull more weight where I am, my son, than I would if I was the ruddy
  sergeant-major himself."</p>

  <p>With which sage utterance our friend had to rest content. But while we are
  on the question, it is passing strange that, in a community such as a
  regiment, the power of the old soldier should be as great as it is. There was
  but little exaggeration in Shorty's last remark. In his present position he
  exercised a far greater influence on the men around him than if he had been a
  sergeant. It was his individuality&mdash;an individuality which made him an
  oracle whom all approached with their little grievances and their little
  troubles. Had he been a senior N.C.O. there would have been the bar of rank;
  and though his influence would have been very great, now it was even greater.
  But with our friend the case was different. He had no such individuality
  developed as yet which marked him out at once as a man among men; and before
  he could become an oracle to whom others would turn in their troubles, he
  must first be given a helping hand&mdash;shown a short cut, so to
  speak&mdash;to the character on which men lean instinctively.</p>

  <p>And there is only one way to produce that character&mdash;only one. It may
  succeed and it may fail; the shrewdest judges of human character make
  mistakes, the best leaders err sometimes. But&mdash;give him responsibility,
  and help him to understand that responsibility, with the help that only a
  good leader can give. Help him to grasp that phrase&mdash;<i>My</i> men; help
  him to realise that their worries are his worries, their amusements his
  amusements; help him to understand the value of cheerfulness when everything
  is damnable&mdash;utterly damnable. Then watch him. He may fail; well, you've
  made a mistake; but he may succeed, and then you've made a man. Which is
  always a thing worth doing....</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap308"
     name="chap308">VIII. &mdash; THE THIRD LESSON IS LEARNED</a></h2>

  <p class="first">And so it came about that three months later Reginald
  Simpkins&mdash; lance-corporal&mdash;and Shorty Bill&mdash;private&mdash;were
  seated on the fire-step of a trench side by side. With one continuous droning
  roar the shells passed over their heads and crumped into the German lines
  opposite. The days of peace for the battalion were over; in a quarter of an
  hour they were going over the top. Thousands like them sat on similar
  fire-steps and realised that same fact, for it was no little show this time:
  it was one where divisions and corps were involved. But to the pawns in the
  game, the horizon is limited: it is just their own destination, their own
  life, their own fate that looms up big and blots out the rest. It's not the
  other hundred thousand who matter at the moment&mdash;it's the pawn himself
  who wonders, and laughs, and sings, and prays....</p>

  <p>Shorty, smoking his pipe imperturbably, was feeling the edge of his own
  particular weapon, with critical finger, and every now and then stealing a
  look at the boy beside him. Apparently satisfied at last with its sharpness
  he laid it down on the step and turned to our friend.</p>

  <p>"You done well, son," he remarked at length, thoughtfully removing his
  pipe. "I'm pleased with you. I was afraid at one time&mdash;just after you
  took the stripe&mdash;when some of 'em was ragging you, as you would turn out
  a quitter. But you got guts. You're twice the man you was when you took it;
  and as for what you was when you joined us, you wasn't nothing at all save a
  walking disease."</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you think I've made good, Shorty." Reginald was swallowing a
  little hard. "I&mdash;er&mdash;I&mdash;Good God! Shorty, I'm just sick with
  funk&mdash;that's straight." It was out at last, and Shorty Bill smiled
  gently and nodded his head.</p>

  <p>"Son," he remarked, "it's one good sign that you ain't afraid o' saying
  so. Now personally I'm not&mdash;though it ain't no credit to me. It's how
  we're made, I reckon. When my time comes, it comes, and there's no blamed use
  worrying."</p>

  <p>"I know all that, but&mdash;somehow&mdash;it ain't much comfort that idea,
  when it comes to the point. I tell you, Shorty, I don't want to be killed;
  I&mdash;" His voice died away, and he looked shamefacedly at the sandbags in
  front of him.</p>

  <p>"No more don't I, son; no more don't I. An' no more don't your
  men&mdash;your six boys you are responsible for. They're your men, that
  little bunch: they're looking to you, they're relying on you." He put his
  hand on the other's knee. "Are you a'-goin' to let 'em down, that six?"</p>

  <p>Once again the great doctrine&mdash;the third great lesson&mdash; the
  doctrine that laughs at life and death, the doctrine of thinking for
  others&mdash;of responsibility.</p>

  <p>"It's better, I reckon, to die a man than live a worm. So long, son;
  time's up."</p>

  <p>The last words were shouted, and even then they could not be heard. Five
  minutes previously it would have seemed impossible that there could have been
  more noise; then suddenly it seemed to double and treble in intensity. The
  ground shook; and over the German trenches there hung a choking cloud of
  fumes which drifted slowly across the front with the wind. As if by
  clockwork, the men got out of their trenches and walked slowly over No Man's
  Land behind the creeping barrage towards the reeking caldron. A great long
  line of men&mdash;thousands and thousands of men; but do not think of them as
  the men of "some of our county regiments who did well, whom we are now
  allowed to mention"; as some "kilted battalions and Canadians who greatly
  distinguished themselves"; do not think of them in the mass, rather think of
  the individual.</p>

  <p>The farm-hand, until two years ago just a clod-hopping countryman, was
  there; and the local lawyer's articled clerk. The gillie from a Scotch
  stream, and the bar-tender from a Yukon saloon walked side by side; and close
  to them a High Church curate in a captain's uniform grinned pleasantly and
  strolled on. The sheep-rancher, the poacher, the fifth son of an impecunious
  earl, and the man from the chorus were all there&mdash;leaving their
  respective lives behind them, the things which they had done, good and bad,
  the successes and the failures. For the moment nothing mattered save that
  seething volcano in front: it might be the end&mdash;it might not.</p>

  <p>And some were quiet, and some were green; some were shouting, and some
  were red; some laughed, and some cursed. But whatever they did, however they
  took it, the leaders of whom I have spoken, each in his own sphere, big or
  little as the case might be, kept 'em, held 'em, looked after 'em, cheered
  'em. Though their own stomachs were turning, though their own throats were
  dry, they had a job to do: a responsibility rested on their shoulders. And
  until death relieved them of that responsibility they could not lay it down.
  They were the leaders; to them much had been given; of them much was
  expected....</p>

  <p>But in this great advance, which has already been ably portrayed by the
  powers of the journalistic world, we are only concerned with the fortunes of
  two individuals. To them those flowery phrases, those magnificent "dashes
  carried out in faultless style," those wonderful "lines which went into the
  jaws of hell as if on parade," would have conveyed a peculiarly inept
  description of their feelings. Not that the descriptions in many cases are
  not wonderfully good! They are&mdash;but they represent the point of view of
  the spectator in a pageant; not the point of view of one of the actors. To
  him they are meaningless: he only knows the intense vital part he plays
  himself. The shell that burst next door to him and killed his sergeant is
  only one of similar thousands to the looker-on behind....</p>

  <p>And so, in a dazed world of his own, Reginald Simpkins, Lance-Corporal and
  sometime pride of Mogg's, walked over No Man's Land. Every now and then he
  looked mechanically to his left and right, and grinned. At least he made a
  contortion with his facial muscles, which experience told him used to produce
  a grin. He did it to encourage the six. Whether he succeeded or not is
  immaterial: the intention was good, even if the peculiar tightness of his
  skin spoiled the result. Occasionally he spoke. No one could have heard what
  he said, but once again the intention was good.</p>

  <p>"Steady, boys&mdash;come on." He said it four or five times and punctuated
  it with grins. Then he tripped over a body and cursed.</p>

  <p>He wondered if he was doing all right; he wondered if Shorty was pleased
  with him. The funk seemed to have gone: in its place had come a kind of dazed
  doggedness, while a fury of impatience to justify himself and his powers of
  leadership shook him at times. Surely to God they could go faster than this
  cursed crawl. Why was the barrage lifting so slowly? It seemed interminable
  that walk over the torn-up earth; and yet the German trenches were still some
  way off.</p>

  <p>He grinned again, and turned round just in time to see the garage
  assistant next to him fall forward into a shell hole, and lie with his head
  stuck in the slimy ooze at the bottom. He frowned, and then almost
  uncomprehendingly he saw the back of the fallen man's head. Of
  course&mdash;he was shot, that's what it was: his six were reduced to
  five.</p>

  <p>"Steady, boys&mdash;come on." As he spoke he felt something catch his
  coat, and he looked down irritably on feeling the material tear. It was a
  strand of barbed wire that stuck up from the ground, with its free end loose.
  They had come to the wire....</p>

  <p>In all directions&mdash;twisted and torn, with ends that stuck up, and
  stray strands uncut&mdash;was wire: thick and rusty it coiled in and out
  between the screw pickets&mdash;cut to pieces, but still there. Men picked
  their way over it gingerly, stepping with care and walking round the little
  ridges that separated the shell holes. Festoons of it lay in these holes, and
  in one large crater a dead Hun lay sprawled on a mattress of it. To the
  spectator behind, it was one dead Hun&mdash;one of thousands. To the man who
  happened to see him as he passed, it was an individual whose chalky face had
  been ripped by one of the barbs as he fell.</p>

  <p>And there is a difference....</p>

  <p>Then they came to the trenches&mdash;the front line, or what was left of
  it. Just facing them a man with his hands above his head opened and shut his
  mouth. He appeared to be saying something, but no voice could be heard above
  the din. Reginald grinned again: the Hun who was trying to imitate a fish
  struck him as a humorous spectacle; moreover, in a flash of memory, he
  reminded him very much of Mr. Mogg's ample wife. He grinned again as he
  thought of Mogg's.</p>

  <p>Once more they were advancing again over the other side of the trench: the
  moppers-up would attend to the piscatorial gentleman. Our friend was better
  now&mdash;very much better; he felt more sure of himself; in fact, absolutely
  sure of himself. In addition he was beginning to get excited. And then a
  machine gun opened fire.</p>

  <p>Hundreds of other machine guns opened fire too; but this one was
  Reginald's machine gun&mdash;the one that concerned his limited horizon. For
  a moment it did not strike him that way, though he saw the gun quite clearly.
  He looked round for help, and in looking round for help, he found that his
  five and three others who were close to him were looking to him for help. And
  he realised his responsibility: he had learned the lesson....</p>

  <p>It was a masterly little piece of work: an excellent piece of subordinate
  leadership. With his arm he directed those eight&mdash;he had not been
  trained as a scout in vain&mdash;and with the loss of only two he got them
  out of the direct zone of fire. A few minutes later he, with the six
  remaining, fell upon that gun's team from a flank. In five seconds it was
  over, and the little group passed on.</p>

  <p>It was just after this that he saw Shorty. At the moment that worthy was
  lying in a shell hole drawing a bead on some target with the utmost care.
  Reggie saw the kick of the gun, but failed to see what he had been firing at
  until the firer stood up and screamed in his ear.</p>

  <p>"Machine gunner&mdash;nest of them over there. Hanging up the ruddy
  advance."</p>

  <p>"We're doing well, Shorty." He howled back the answer.</p>

  <p>"I reckon so. The swine are running all along the line; only one or two of
  'em holdin' us up. Look out." He pulled Reginald to one side, and pointed
  behind him.</p>

  <p>Majestically, squelching through the mud, came Tiny Tim, or the Tired
  Tank. It was pitching and rolling like a squat old tramp making heavy weather
  beating up Channel. They waved at it as it passed by, lurching ominously but
  going straight for the machine-gun nest. Once it almost seemed to disappear
  as it waddled down an extra large hole with its two stern wheels waving
  foolishly in the air; but a moment later it squirmed solemnly up the far
  side, and rolled on to its chosen target. The wire was uncut; but it trod on
  the wire, and the wire was not.</p>

  <p>"Look at the perishers running," howled Shorty, as he watched some men
  doubling back from the death-trap. Their arms were waving foolishly: one
  could imagine their faces grey-green with terror, their hoarse shouts of
  fear, their desperate hurry to avoid the thing that was coming. "Lumme! I
  must draw a bead on that bunch," muttered Shorty eagerly. "Now then, son, you
  can hit one of that lot." He turned from the scene in front, and the next
  instant he was down on his knees. "What is it, boy, what is it?"</p>

  <p>The man lying stiffly on the ground grinned yet once again, and shook his
  head. Thus does it come&mdash;suddenly, in a second. To the spectator
  behind&mdash;"our losses were not as great as had been anticipated." To the
  man&mdash;journey's end.</p>

  <p>"I've got it this time, Shorty," he remarked, and he seemed to speak with
  difficulty. The roar of the guns was passing onwards, the din was not quite
  so deafening. "My bally old back seems all numb."</p>

  <p>Just a stray bullet; just a broken back; just a finish. With the eye of
  knowledge Shorty looked at the grey tinge already spreading over the boy's
  face, and the mystery of death struck him forcibly: something of the
  strangeness of it all. In five minutes&mdash;four&mdash;ten&mdash; what
  matter?&mdash;the lips now capable of speech would close for ever: the man
  whom he had known and lived alongside of for months would be gone for good.
  The desperate finality of it; the utter futility of the onlooker....</p>

  <p>"Is the Tank clearing 'em out, Shorty?" The dying man interrupted his
  thoughts, and he looked up to see what was happening.</p>

  <p>"It is that, son; it's doing fine. The old thing is sittin' there like a
  broody hen spittin' at 'em, and the swine are running like hell."</p>

  <p>"God! Shorty, could one hit 'em with a gun?" The glazing eyes brightened;
  the lolling head straightened with a jerk.</p>

  <p>"Sure thing." Shorty looked at him, and understood. "Like to try, boy;
  you'd get the cocoa-nut, I'll bet."</p>

  <p>"That's it, Shorty; that's it. Turn me over, an' prop me up. I'd like
  to.... Lord! man, I can see 'em there, hundreds of 'em running to beat the
  band. Give me the gun, Bill, quick; I must just get one; I...."</p>

  <p>With powerless hands he took the rifle for the last time, and looked along
  the sights. "God!" he whimpered, "I can't hold it steady&mdash;I can't....
  Shorty, Shorty, I'm wobbling all over the target."</p>

  <p>But Shorty did not come to him. He was lying on the ground two or three
  feet away, with his own rifle hugged to his shoulder. "If there be anything
  in religion," he muttered fiercely, "let me shoot straight this time,
  God."</p>

  <p>"That's all right," he shouted; "you've got him covered fine. Fire, son,
  fire&mdash;an' hit the perisher. You ain't wobbling."</p>

  <p>And so Reginald Simpkins, lance-corporal and man, fired his last shot.
  Heaven knows where it went; all that matters is that a running grey-green
  figure two hundred yards away suddenly threw his hands above his head and
  pitched forward on his face.</p>

  <p>"Great shooting, son, great shooting." Shorty Bill was beside him, turning
  him over once again on his back. "You plugged him clean as a whistle. Good
  boy."</p>

  <p>The grey had spread; the end was very near. "I thought I heard&mdash;
  another shot&mdash;close by." The tired eyelids closed. "I've made good,
  Shorty, ain't I?... Honourable Jimmy... Regiment great thing...
  responsibility... greater...." And so he died.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap309"
     name="chap309">IX. &mdash; "AND OTHER FELL ON GOOD GROUND"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Shorty Bill thoughtfully ejected a spent cartridge case from
  his magazine and pulled back the safety catch. "I'm glad I hit him. It'll be
  something for the boy to take away with him. I suppose he'll remember it."
  Shorty's brow wrinkled with the strain of this abstruse theological problem.
  Then he shrugged his shoulders and gave it up. "So long, son; you made
  good&mdash;you did well. But the old Tank has cleared 'em out, an' I must be
  toddling on." Then he remembered something, and produced his own patent
  weapon. It was only as he actually started to cut another nick in the long
  row which adorned the stock of his rifle that he paused: paused and looked
  up.</p>

  <p>"Lumme! I'd better wait a bit; it wouldn't never do for the boy to know it
  was me what hit that Hun. I'll just go on a little, I'll... Good-bye, boy;
  I'm sorry&mdash;dam sorry."</p>

  <p>With his strange, loping walk the poacher and jailbird walked off in the
  wake of the Tank, which was now ploughing merrily forward again. Fifty yards
  away he stopped, and cut another nick. "Ninety-three," he muttered; "not bad.
  But it wouldn't never have done for the boy to have known." Undoubtedly
  theology was not his strong point.</p>

  <p>Slowly, an inch or two at a time, Reginald Simpkins slithered down the
  sloping side of the shell hole till he reached the bottom. To the batches of
  prisoners coming back&mdash;just a casualty; to the reinforcements coming
  up&mdash;just a casualty. To the boy himself&mdash;the great price.</p>

  <p>And so, in the shell-ploughed, gun-furrowed No Man's Land is the seed of
  Britain sown. And the harvest&mdash;?</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="part4"
     name="part4">PART IV. &mdash; HARVEST</a></h2>

  <p class="quote"><i>"Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in
  bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn."</i> &mdash;Matthew
  xiii. 30.</p>

  <p class="quote"><i>"For shoulders curved with the counter stoop will be
  carried erect and square;<br>
  And faces white from the office light will be bronzed by the open air;<br>
  And we'll walk with the stride of a new-born pride, with a new-found joy in
  our eyes;<br>
  Scornful men who have diced with death under the naked skies.</i></p>

  <p class="quote"><i>"For some of us smirk in a chiffon shop, and some of us
  teach in a school;<br>
  Some of us help with the seat of our pants to polish an office stool;<br>
  The merits of somebody's soap or jam some of us seek to explain;<br>
  But all of us wonder what we'll do when we have to go back again."</i>
  &mdash;R.W. Service.</p><br>

  <p>What of the harvest? It is coming, perhaps sooner than we expect, perhaps
  not for many weary months. But the reaper is even now sharpening his sickle
  in readiness, and&mdash;what of the crops?</p>

  <p>Into No Man's Land have gone alike, the wheat of honest endeavour and
  hardship well borne, and the tares of class hatred and selfishness. Had ever
  reaper nobler task in front of him than the burning of those tares and the
  gathering of that wheat into the nation's barn?...</p>

  <p>In the Château at Boesinghe, where the moss is growing round the broken
  doors and the rank weeds fill the garden, with the stagnant Yser hard by; in
  Ypres, where the rooks nest in the crumbling Cloth Hall and a man's footsteps
  ring loud and hollow on the silent square; in Vermelles, where the chalky
  plains stretch bare towards the east, and the bloody Hohenzollern redoubt,
  with the great squat slag heap beside it, lies silent and ominous; in
  Guillemont and Guinchy, where the sunken road was stiff with German dead and
  no two bricks remain on top of one another; on Vimy Ridge, in Bullecourt and
  Croisilles, in all these places, in all the hundred others, the seed has been
  sown. What of the harvest?</p>

  <p>If I have made of war a hideous thing&mdash;unredeemed,
  repulsive&mdash;the picture is not consciously exaggerated. As far as in me
  lies I have drawn the thing as I have seen it.</p>

  <p>But after the lean years, the fat; after the hideous sowing, the glorious
  aftermath.</p>

  <p>The more one thinks of it, the more amazing does the paradox
  become&mdash;the paradox of cause and effect. To fit these civilians of
  Britain for all the dirty details which go to make winning or losing, to fit
  them for the business of killing in the most efficient manner, the tuition
  must include the inculcation of ideals&mdash;more, the assimilation of
  ideals&mdash; which are immeasurably superior to any they learned in their
  civilian life. At least so it seems to one who makes their acquaintance when
  they first join up. In their civilian life self ruled; there, each individual
  pawn scrambled and snarled as he pushed the next pawn to him under&mdash;or
  went under himself as the case might be&mdash;in his frenzied endeavour to
  better himself, to win a little brief authority! The community was composed
  of a mass of struggling, fighting units, each one all out for himself and
  only himself.</p>

  <p>But from the tuition which the manhood of Britain is now undergoing, there
  must surely be a very different result. Self no longer rules; self is sunk
  for the good of the cause&mdash;for the good of the community. And the
  community, realising that fact, endeavours, by every means in its power, to
  develop that self to the very maximum of which it is capable, knowing that,
  in due course, it will reap the benefit. No longer do individual pawns
  struggle one against the other, but each&mdash;developing his own particular
  gift to the maximum&mdash;places it at the disposal of the community who
  helped him in his development. And that is the result of so-called
  militarism&mdash; <i>British</i> militarism.</p>

  <p>Surely what has been accomplished in the Army can be carried into other
  matters in the fullness of time. I am no prophet; I am no social reformer to
  speak of ways and means. All I can say with certainty is that I have seen
  them come in by hundreds, by thousands&mdash;these men of our country now
  fighting in every corner of the globe&mdash;resentful, suspicious, intolerant
  of authority. I have seen them in training; I have seen the finished article.
  And the result is good: the change for the better wonderful.</p>

  <p>It cannot be that one must presuppose such a hideous thing as this war to
  be necessary, in order to attain such results. I cannot believe it. There
  must be some other method of teaching the lessons of playing for the side and
  unselfishness. The spurred culprits of Mr. Wells' imagination have given a
  lead over the fence; surely all the rest of the field is not going to
  jib.</p>

  <p>And when the harvest does come in, when the sickle is finally put to the
  crop, there will be such an opportunity for statesmanship as the world has
  never before seen.</p>

  <p>Winnowed by the fan of suffering and death, the wheat of the harvest will
  shed its tares of discord and suspicion. The duke and the labourer will have
  stood side by side, and will have found one another&mdash;men. No longer self
  the only thing; no longer a ceaseless growse against everybody and
  everything; no longer an instinctive suspicion of the man one rung higher up
  the ladder. But more self-reliant and cheery; stronger in character and
  bigger in outlook; with a newly acquired sense of self-control and
  understanding; in short, grown a little nearer to its maximum development,
  the manhood of the nation will be ripe for the moulder's hand. It has tasted
  of discipline; it has realised that only by discipline for the individual can
  there be true freedom for the community; and that without that discipline,
  chaos is inevitable. Pray heavens there be a moulder&mdash;a moulder worthy
  of the task.</p>

  <p>"Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one
  vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?"</p>

  <p>He will have grand clay&mdash;that moulder: clay such as has never been
  known before. Its God will be the God of Reality, its devil the Devil of
  Pretence. Just as it has ceased to look at Death through a haze of drawn
  window-blinds and frock-coats redolent of moth-balls, so it will cease with
  scorn to look at some of the clumsy sophistries of modern life through the
  rose-tinted spectacles so kindly provided for the purpose by men of great
  vocal, and correspondingly small mental, power.</p>

  <p>Out of the evil, good will come: surely it must be so. In the wisdom of
  the Infinite Power, madness has been let loose on the world. The madness was
  not of our seeking. It was hurled upon us by a race whose standards are based
  on bombing or crucifying their prisoners, and eating their own dead; on
  sinking unarmed liners and murdering an odd woman or two to fill in time; and
  finally&mdash;though perhaps last on the list of witticisms from a material
  point of view, almost first from that of contempt&mdash;of crucifying an
  emaciated cat and stuffing a cigar in its mouth. A race without an instinct
  of sport, without an idea of playing the game. Gross and contemptible they
  bluster first, and then they whine; and the rare exceptions only make the
  great drab mass seem even more nauseating....</p>

  <p>But the crushing of that race will have been hard, the sacrifices great.
  And even so will the results of those sacrifices be great. Of social problems
  I am, as I have said, not qualified to speak; indeed of any of the great
  problems of reconstruction it would be presumption on my part to hold
  forth.</p>

  <p>It is not for the soldier to see visions and dream dreams: there are
  others more fitted, more suited to the task. It is of the individual I have
  written; it is to the individual I dedicate the result of my labours.</p>

  <p>I remember meeting a Padre one day several months ago. He was conjuring at
  a concert for an Infantry Battalion that evening&mdash;between the forefinger
  and thumb of the right hand you now perceive a baby giraffe sort of
  business&mdash;and I told him I thought it was very good of him to take the
  immense amount of trouble he always did to amuse the boys.</p>

  <p>"Good!" His face expressed genuine amazement. "Good! To these boys! I tell
  you, when I think of what the ordinary private soldier is doing for
  me&mdash;aye! and for all of us who are not in the Infantry&mdash;I just
  stand quite still and take off my hat."</p>

  <p>And so I have written of the individual. Inadequately it is true, and with
  a due sense of my short-comings in attempting the task, I have written of the
  men I have met and lived with across the narrow sea. Not of armies and army
  corps, not of divisions and brigades, but of the units&mdash;the individual
  men&mdash;who form them. For it is the man we know. It is the man who has
  suffered and endured, the man who touches our laughter and our tears. He has
  given his all, unstintingly, unsparingly; and now, perchance, he lies
  peaceful and at rest in the land where the seed has been sown; perchance he
  will come back to the country he has fought for when the final reckoning is
  over. And whichever it is&mdash;the quiet, solitary grave with the cross
  above it and the wild flowers blooming freshly underneath the crumbling walls
  of a town that was; or the taking up again of the work so long
  neglected&mdash;the office or the ranch, the railway in Yukon or the rubber
  in Malay&mdash;whichever it is, he has played the great game well. To him the
  great reward....</p>

  <p>And the women? the women who have suffered and endured with their
  men&mdash;more than their men. To some the great reunion, the blessed feeling
  that it is over. Never again will he go into the great unknown; never again
  that clutching terror of the telegraph boy. He has come back, and there shall
  be no more parting. The joy bells will be ringing out: the war will be
  over&mdash;won.</p>

  <p>Thus shall it be for some.</p>

  <p>And for the others....</p>

  <p>It is not for me to comfort: there are things too deep for the written
  word. Only one thing I say, and I say it with a full sense of its pitiful
  inadequacy. When the joy bells do ring out, and in the ringing seem to mock
  so hideously the empty chair, the voice for ever silent, then in that bitter
  moment, remember one thing. Somewhere or other, in the Soldier's Valhalla, he
  is waiting for you&mdash;waiting with a trusty band of friends, happy,
  contented, proud. He was glad to pay that final price; he knows now, where
  all is clear, that it was necessary. He would have you know it too....</p>

  <p class="quote"><i>For except a grain of wheat fall into the ground and
  die....</i></p>
