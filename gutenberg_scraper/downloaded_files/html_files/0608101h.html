<h2><a id="vulture1" name="vulture1">CHAPTER 1</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">SO THEY BROUGHT the envoys, pallid from months of
imprisonment, before the canopied throne of Suleyman the
Magnificent, Sultan of Turkey, and the mightiest monarch in an age
of mighty monarchs. Under the great purple dome of the royal
chamber gleamed the throne before which the world trembled&mdash;
gold-paneled, pearl-inlaid. An emperor's wealth in gems was sewn
into the silken canopy from which depended a shimmering string of
pearls ending a frieze of emeralds which hung like a halo of glory
above Suleyman's head. Yet the splendor of the throne was paled by
the glitter of the figure upon it, bedecked in jewels, the aigrette
feather rising above the diamonded white turban. About the throne
stood his nine viziers, in attitudes of humility, and warriors of
the imperial bodyguard ranged the dais&mdash;Solaks in armor, black
and white and scarlet plumes nodding above the gilded helmets.</p>

<p>The envoys from Austria were properly impressed&mdash;the more
so as they had had nine weary months for reflection in the grim
Castle of the Seven Towers that overlooks the Sea of Marmora. The
head of the embassy choked down his choler and cloaked his
resentment in a semblance of submission&mdash;a strange cloak on
the shoulders of Habordansky, general of Ferdinand, Archduke of
Austria. His rugged head bristled incongruously from the flaming
silk robes presented him by the contemptuous Sultan, as he was
brought before the throne, his arms gripped fast by stalwart
Janizaries. Thus were foreign envoys presented to the sultans, ever
since that red day by Kossova when Milosh Kabilovitch, knight of
slaughtered Serbia, had slain the conqueror Murad with a hidden
dagger.</p>

<p>The Grand Turk regarded Habordansky with scant favor. Suleyman
was a tall, slender man, with a thin down-curving nose and a thin
straight mouth, the resolution of which his drooping mustachios did
not soften. His narrow outward-curving chin was shaven. The only
suggestion of weakness was in the slender, remarkably long neck,
but that suggestion was belied by the hard lines of the slender
figure, the glitter of the dark eyes.</p>

<p>There was more than a suggestion of the Tatar about
him&mdash;rightly so, since he was no more the son of Selim the
Grim, than of Hafsza Khatun, princess of Crimea. Born to the
purple, heir to the mightiest military power in the world, he was
crested with authority and cloaked in pride that recognized no peer
beneath the gods.</p>

<p>Under his eagle gaze old Habordansky bent his head to hide the
sullen rage in his eyes. Nine months before, the general had come
to Stamboul representing his master, the Archduke, with proposals
for truce and the disposition of the iron crown of Hungary, torn
from the dead king Louis' head on the bloody field of Mohacz, where
the Grand Turk's armies opened the road to Europe.</p>

<p>There had been another emissary before him&mdash;Jerome Lasczky,
the Polish count palatine. Habordansky, with the bluntness of his
breed, had claimed the Hungarian crown for his master, rousing
Suleyman's ire. Lasczky had, like a suppliant, asked on his bended
knees that crown for his countrymen at Mohacz.</p>

<p>To Lasczky had been given honor, gold and promises of patronage,
for which he had paid with pledges abhorrent even to his avaricious
soul&mdash; selling his ally's subjects into slavery, and opening
the road through the subject territory to the very heart of
Christendom.</p>

<p>All this was made known to Habordansky, frothing with fury in
the prison to which the arrogant resentment of the Sultan had
assigned him. Now Suleyman looked contemptuously at the staunch old
general, and dispensed with the usual formality of speaking through
the mouthpiece of the Grand Vizier. A royal Turk would not deign to
admit knowledge of any Frankish tongue, but Habordansky understood
Turki. The Sultan's remarks were brief and without preamble.</p>

<p>"Say to your master that I now make ready to visit him in his
own lands, and that if he fails to meet me at Mohacz or at Pesth, I
will meet him beneath the walls of Vienna."</p>

<p>Habordansky bowed, not trusting himself to speak. At a scornful
wave of the imperial hand, an officer of the court came forward and
bestowed upon the general a small gilded bag containing two hundred
ducats. Each member of his retinue, waiting patiently at the other
end of the chamber, under the spears of the Janizaries, was
likewise so guerdoned.</p>

<p>Habordansky mumbled thanks, his knotty hands clenched about the
gift with unnecessary vigor. The Sultan grinned thinly, well aware
that the ambassador would have hurled the coins into his face, had
he dared. He half-lifted his hand, in token of dismissal, then
paused, his eyes resting on the group of men who composed the
general's suite&mdash;or rather, on one of these men. This man was
the tallest in the room, strongly built, wearing his Turkish
gift-garments clumsily. At a gesture from the Sultan he was brought
forward in the grasp of the soldiers.</p>

<p>Suleyman stared at him narrowly. The Turkish vest and voluminous
khalat could not conceal the lines of massive strength. His tawny
hair was close-cropped, his sweeping yellow mustaches drooping
below a stubborn chin. His blue eyes seemed strangely clouded; it
was as if the man slept on his feet, with his eyes open.</p>

<p>"Do you speak Turki?" The Sultan did the fellow the stupendous
honor of addressing him directly. Through all the pomp of the
Ottoman court there remained in the Sultan some of the simplicity
of Tatar ancestors.</p>

<p>"Yes, your majesty," answered the Frank.</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>"Men name me Gottfried von Kalmbach."</p>

<p>Suleyman scowled and unconsciously his fingers wandered to his
shoulder, where, under his silken robes, he could feel the outlines
of an old scar.</p>

<p>"I do not forget faces. Somewhere I have seen yours&mdash;under
circumstances that etched it into the back of my mind. But I am
unable to recall those circumstances."</p>

<p>"I was at Rhodes," offered the German.</p>

<p>"Many men were at Rhodes," snapped Suleyman.</p>

<p>"Aye." agreed von Kalmbach tranquilly. "De l'Isle Adam was
there."</p>

<p>Suleyman stiffened and his eyes glittered at the name of the
Grand Master of the Knights of Saint John, whose desperate defense
of Rhodes had cost the Turk sixty thousand men. He decided,
however, that the Frank was not clever enough for the remark to
carry any subtle thrust, and dismissed the embassy with a wave.</p>

<p>The envoys were backed out of the Presence and the incident was
closed. The Franks would be escorted out of Stamboul, and to the
nearest boundaries of the empire. The Turk's warning would be
carried posthaste to the Archduke, and soon on the heels of that
warning would come the armies of the Sublime Porte.</p>

<p>Suleyman's officers knew that the Grand Turk had more in mind
than merely establishing his puppet Zapolya on the conquered
Hungarian throne. Suleyman's ambitions embraced all
Europe&mdash;that stubborn Frankistan which had for centuries
sporadically poured forth hordes chanting and pillaging into the
East, whose illogical and wayward peoples had again and again
seemed ripe for Moslem conquest, yet who had always emerged, if not
victorious, at least unconquered.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
It was the evening of the morning on which the Austrian emissaries
departed, that Suleyman, brooding on his throne, raised his lean
head and beckoned his Grand Vizier Ibrahim, who approached with
confidence. The Grand Vizier was always sure of his master's
approbation; was he not cup-companion and boyhood comrade of the
Sultan?</p>

<p>Ibrahim had but one rival in his master's favor&mdash;the
red-haired Russian girl, Khurrem the Joyous, whom Europe knew as
Roxelana, whom slavers had dragged from her father's house in
Rogatino to be the Sultan's <i>harim</i> favorite.</p>

<p>"I remember the infidel at last," said Suleyman. "Do you recall
the first charge of the knights at Mohacz?"</p>

<p>Ibrahim winced slightly at the allusion.</p>

<p>"Oh, Protector of the Pitiful, is it likely that I should forget
an occasion on which the divine blood of my master was spilt by an
unbeliever?"</p>

<p>"Then you remember that thirty-two knights, the paladins of the
Nazarenes, drove headlong into our array, each having pledged his
life to cut down our person. By Allah, they rode like men riding to
a wedding, their great horses and long lances overthrowing all who
opposed them, and their plate-armor turned the finest steel. Yet
they fell as the firelocks spoke until only three were left in the
saddle&mdash;the knight Marczali and two companions. These paladins
cut down my Solaks like ripe grain, but Marczali and one of his
companions fell&mdash;almost at my feet.</p>

<p>"Yet one knight remained, though his vizored helmet had been
torn from his head and blood started from every joint in his armor.
He rode full at me, swinging his great two-handed sword, and I
swear by the beard of the Prophet, death was so nigh me that I felt
the burning breath of Azrael on my neck!</p>

<p>"His sword flashed like lightning in the sky, and glancing from
my casque, whereby I was half-stunned so that blood gushed from my
nose, rent the mail on my shoulder and gave me this wound, which
irks me yet when the rains come. The Janizaries who swarmed around
him cut the hocks of his horse, which brought him to earth as it
went down, and the remnants of my Solaks bore me back out of the
melee. Then the Hungarian host came on, and I saw not what became
of the knight. But today I saw him again."</p>

<p>Ibrahim started with an exclamation of incredulity.</p>

<p>"Nay, I could not mistake those blue eyes. How it is I know not,
but the knight that wounded me at Mohacz was this German, Gottfried
von Kalmbach."</p>

<p>"But, Defender of the Faith," protested Ibrahim, "the heads of
those dog-knights were heaped before thy royal pavilion&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And I counted them and said nothing at the time, lest men think
I held thee in blame," answered Suleyman. "There were but
thirty-one. Most were so mutilated I could tell little of the
features. But somehow the infidel escaped, who gave me this blow. I
love brave men, but our blood is not so common that an unbeliever
may with impunity spill it on the ground for the dogs to lap up.
See ye to it."</p>

<p>Ibrahim salaamed deeply and withdrew. He made his way through
broad corridors to a blue-tiled chamber whose gold-arched windows
looked out on broad galleries, shaded by cypress and plane-trees,
and cooled by the spray of silvery fountains. There at his summons
came one Yaruk Khan, a Crim Tatar, a slant-eyed impassive figure in
harness of lacquered leather and burnished bronze.</p>

<p>"Dog-brother," said the Vizier, "did thy koumiss-clouded gaze
mark the tall German lord who served the emir Habordansky&mdash;the
lord whose hair is tawny as a lion's mane?"</p>

<p>"Aye, <i>noyon</i>, he who is called Gombuk."</p>

<p>"The same. Take a <i>chambul</i> of thy dog-brothers and go
after the Franks. Bring back this man and thou shalt be rewarded.
The persons of envoys are sacred, but this matter is not official,"
he added cynically.</p>

<p>"To hear is to obey!" With a salaam as profound as that accorded
to the Sultan himself, Yaruk Khan backed out of the presence of the
second man of the empire.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
He returned some days later, dusty, travel-stained, and without his
prey. On him Ibrahim bent an eye full of menace, and the Tatar
prostrated himself before the silken cushions on which the Grand
Vizier sat, in the blue chamber with the gold-arched windows.</p>

<p>"Great khan, let not thine anger consume thy slave. The fault
was not mine, by the beard of the Prophet."</p>

<p>"Squat on thy mangy haunches and bay out the tale," ordered
Ibrahim considerately.</p>

<p>"Thus it was, my lord," began Yaruk Khan. "I rode swiftly, and
though the Franks and their escort had a long start, and pushed on
through the night without halting, I came up with them the next
midday. But lo, Gombuk was not among them, and when I inquired
after him, the paladin Habordansky replied only with many great
oaths, like to the roaring of a cannon. So I spoke with various of
the escort who understood the speech of these infidels, and learned
what had come to pass. Yet I would have my lord remember that I
only repeat the words of the Spahis of the escort, who are men
without honor and lie like&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Like a Tatar," said Ibrahim.</p>

<p>Yaruk Khan acknowledged the compliment with a wide dog-like
grin, and continued.</p>

<p>"This they told me. At dawn Gombuk drew horse away from the
rest, and the emir Habordansky demanded of him the reason. Then
Gombuk laughed in the manner of the Franks&mdash;huh! huh!
huh!&mdash;so.</p>

<p>"And Gombuk said: 'The devil of good your service has done me,
so I cool my heels for nine months in a Turkish prison. Suleyman
has given us safe conduct over the border and I am not compelled to
ride with you.'</p>

<p>"'You dog,' said the emir, 'there is war in the wind and the
Archduke has need of your sword.'</p>

<p>"'Devil eat the Archduke,' answered Gombuk; 'Zapolya is a dog
because he stood aside at Mohacz, and let us, his comrades, be cut
to pieces, but Ferdinand is a dog too. When I am penniless I sell
him my sword. Now I have two hundred ducats and these robes which I
can sell to any Jew for a handful of silver, and may the devil bite
me if I draw sword for any man while I have a penny left. I'm for
the nearest Christian tavern, and you and the Archduke may go to
the devil.'</p>

<p>"Then the emir cursed him with many great curses, and Gombuk
rode away laughing, huh! huh! huh!, and singing a song about a
cockroach named&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Enough!" Ibrahim's features were dark with rage. He plucked
savagely at his beard, reflecting that in the allusion to Mohacz,
von Kalmbach had practically clinched Suleyman's suspicion. That
matter of thirty-one heads when there should have been thirty-two
was something no Turkish sultan would be likely to overlook.
Officials had lost positions and their own heads over more trivial
matters. The manner in which Suleyman had acted showed his almost
incredible fondness and consideration for his Grand Vizier, but
Ibrahim, vain though he was, was shrewd and wished no slightest
shadow to come between him and his sovereign.</p>

<p>"Could you not have tracked him down, dog?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"By Allah," swore the uneasy Tatar, "he must have ridden on the
wind. He crossed the border hours ahead of me, and I followed him
as far as I dared&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Enough of excuses," interrupted Ibrahim. "Send Mikhal Oglu to
me."</p>

<p>The Tatar departed thankfully. Ibrahim was not tolerant of
failure in any man.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
The Grand Vizier brooded on his silken cushions until the shadow of
a pair The Grand Vizier brooded on his silken cushions until the
shadow of a pair of vulture wings fell across the marble-tiled
floor, and the lean figure he had summoned bowed before him. The
man whose very name was a shuddering watchword of horror to all
western Asia was soft-spoken and moved with the mincing ease of a
cat, but the stark evil of his soul showed in his dark countenance,
gleamed in his narrow slit eyes.</p>

<p>He was the chief of the Akinji, those wild riders whose raids
spread fear and desolation throughout all lands beyond the Grand
Turk's borders. He stood in full armor, a jeweled helmet on his
narrow head, the wide vulture wings made fast to the shoulders of
his gilded chain-mail hauberk. Those wings spread wide in the wind
when he rode, and under their pinions lay the shadows of death and
destruction. It was Suleyman's scimitar-tip, the most noted slayer
of a nation of slayers, who stood before the Grand Vizier.</p>

<p>"Soon you will precede the hosts of our master into the lands of
the infidel," said Ibrahim. "It will be your order, as always, to
strike and spare not. You will waste the fields and the vineyards
of the Caphars, you will burn their villages, you will strike down
their men with arrows, and lead away their wenches captive. Lands
beyond our line of march will cry out beneath your heel."</p>

<p>"That is good hearing, Favored of Allah," answered Mikhal Oglu
in his soft courteous voice.</p>

<p>"Yet there is an order within the order," continued Ibrahim,
fixing a piercing eye on the Akinji. "You know the German, von
Kalmbach?"</p>

<p>"Aye&mdash;Gombuk as the Tatars call him."</p>

<p>"So. This is my command&mdash;whoever fights or flees, lives or
dies&mdash;this man must not live. Search him out wherever he lies,
though the hunt carry you to the very banks of the Rhine. When you
bring me his head, your reward shall be thrice its weight in
gold."</p>

<p>"To hear is to obey, my lord. Men say he is the vagabond son of
a noble German family, whose ruin has been wine and women. They say
he was once a Knight of Saint John, until cast forth for guzzling
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yet do not underrate him," answered Ibrahim grimly. "Sot he may
be, but if he rode with Marczali, he is not to be despised. See
thou to it!"</p>

<p>"There is no den where he can hide from me, oh Favored of
Allah," declared Mikhal Oglu, "no night dark enough to conceal him,
no forest thick enough. If I bring you not his head, I give him
leave to send you mine."</p>

<p>"Enough!" Ibrahim grinned and tugged at his beard, well pleased.
"You have my leave to go."</p>

<p>The sinister vulture-winged figure went springily and silently
from the blue chamber, nor could Ibrahim guess that he was taking
the first steps in a feud which should spread over years and far
lands, swirling in dark tides to draw in thrones and kingdoms and
red-haired women more beautiful than the flames of hell.</p>

<h2><a id="vulture2" name="vulture2">CHAPTER 2</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">IN A SMALL thatched hut in a village not far from
the Danube, lusty snores resounded where a figure reclined in state
on a ragged cloak thrown over a heap of straw. It was the paladin
Gottfried von Kalmbach who slept the sleep of innocence and ale.
The velvet vest, voluminous silken trousers, khalat and shagreen
boots, gifts from a contemptuous sultan, were nowhere in evidence.
The paladin was clad in worn leather and rusty mail. Hands tugged
at him, breaking his sleep, and he swore drowsily.</p>

<p>"Wake up, my lord! Oh, wake, good knight&mdash;good
pig&mdash;good dog-soul&mdash;will you wake, then?"</p>

<p>"Fill my flagon, host," mumbled the slumberer. "Who?&mdash;what?
May the dogs bite you, Ivga! I've not another asper&mdash;not a
penny. Go off like a good lass and let me sleep."</p>

<p>The girl renewed her tugging and shaking.</p>

<p>"Oh dolt! Rise! Gird on your spit! There are happenings
forward!"</p>

<p>"Ivga," muttered Gottfried, pulling away from her attack, "take
my burganet to the Jew. He'll give you enough for it to get drunk
again."</p>

<p>"Fool!" she cried in despair. "It isn't money I want! The whole
east is aflame, and none knows the reason thereof!"</p>

<p>"Has the rain ceased?" asked von Kalmbach, taking some interest
in the proceedings at last.</p>

<p>"The rain ceased hours ago. You can only hear the drip from the
thatch. Put on your sword and come out into the street. The men of
the village are all drunk on your last silver, and the women know
not what to think or do. Ah!"</p>

<p>The exclamation was broken from her by the sudden upleaping of a
weird illumination which shone through the crevices of the hut. The
German got unsteadily to his feet, quickly girt on the great
two-handed sword and stuck his dented burganet on his cropped
locks. Then he followed the girl into the straggling street. She
was a slender young thing, barefooted, clad only in a short
tunic-like garment, through the wide rents of which gleamed
generous expanses of white flesh.</p>

<p>There seemed no life or movement in the village. Nowhere showed
a light. Water dripped steadily from the eaves of the thatched
roofs. Puddles in the muddy streets gleamed black. Wind sighed and
moaned eerily through the black sodden branches of the trees which
pressed in bulwarks of darkness about the little village, and in
the southeast, towering higher into the leaden sky, rose the lurid
crimson glow that set the dank clouds to smoldering. The girl Ivga
cringed close to the tall German, whimpering.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what it is, my girl," said he, scanning the glow.
"It's Suleyman's devils. They've crossed the river and they're
burning the villages. Aye, I've seen glares like that in the sky
before. I've expected him before now, but these cursed rains we've
had for weeks must have held him back. Aye, it's the Akinji, right
enough, and they won't stop this side of Vienna. Look you, my girl,
go quickly and quietly to the stable behind the hut and bring me my
gray stallion. We'll slip out like mice from between the devil's
fingers. The stallion will carry us both, easily."</p>

<p>"But the people of the village!" she sobbed, wringing her
hands.</p>

<p>"Eh, well," he said, "God rest them; the men have drunk my ale
valiantly and the women have been kind&mdash;but horns of Satan,
girl, the gray nag won't carry a whole village!"</p>

<p>"Go you!" she returned. "I'll stay and die with my people!"</p>

<p>"The Turks won't kill you," he answered. "They'll sell you to a
fat old Stamboul merchant who'll beat you. I won't stay to be cut
open, and neither shall you&mdash;"</p>

<p>A terrible scream from the girl cut him short and he wheeled at
the awful terror in her flaring eyes. Even as he did so, a hut at
the lower end of the village sprang into flames, the sodden
material burning slowly. A medley of screams and maddened yells
followed the cry of the girl. In the sluggish light figures danced
and capered wildly. Gottfried, straining his eyes in the shadows,
saw shapes swarming over the low mud wall which drunkenness and
negligence had left unguarded.</p>

<p>"Damnation!" he muttered. "The accursed ones have ridden ahead
of their fire. They've stolen on the village in the dark&mdash;come
on, girl!"</p>

<p>But even as he caught her white wrist to drag her away, and she
screamed and fought against him like a wild thing, mad with fear,
the mud wall crashed at the point nearest them. It crumpled under
the impact of a score of horses, and into the doomed village reined
the riders, distinct in the growing light. Huts were flaring up on
all hands, screams rising to the dripping clouds as the invaders
dragged shrieking women and drunken men from their hovels and cut
their throats. Gottfried saw the lean figures of the horsemen, the
firelight gleaming on their burnished steel; he saw the vulture
wings on the shoulders of the foremost. Even as he recognized
Mikhal Oglu, he saw the chief stiffen and point.</p>

<p>"At him, dogs!" yelled the Akinji, his voice no longer soft, but
strident as the rasp of a drawn saber. "It is Gombuk! Five hundred
aspers to the man who brings me his head!"</p>

<p>With a curse von Kalmbach bounded for the shadows of the nearest
hut, dragging the screaming girl with him. Even as he leaped he
heard the twang of bowstrings, and the girl sobbed and went limp in
his grasp. She sank down at his feet, and in the lurid glare he saw
the feathered end of an arrow quivering under her heart. With a low
rumble he turned toward his assailants as a fierce bear turns at
bay. An instant he stood, head out-thrust truculently, sword
gripped in both hands; then, as a bear gives back from the onset of
the hunters, he turned and fled about the hut, arrows whistling
about him and glancing from the rings of his mail. There were no
shots; the ride through that dripping forest had dampened the
powder-flasks of the raiders.</p>

<p>Von Kalmbach quartered about the back of the hut, mindful of the
fierce yells behind him, and gained the shed behind the hut he had
occupied, wherein he stabled his gray stallion. Even as he reached
the door, someone snarled like a panther in the semi-dark and cut
viciously at him. He parried the stroke with the lifted sword and
struck back with all the power of his broad shoulders. The great
blade glanced stunningly from the Akinji's polished helmet and rent
through the mail links of his hauberk, tearing arm from
shoulder.</p>

<p>The Muhammadan sank down with a groan, and the German sprang
over his prostrate form. The gray stallion, wild with fear and
excitement, neighed shrilly and reared as his master sprang on his
back. No time for saddle or bridle. Gottfried dug his heels into
the quivering flanks and the great steed shot through the door like
a thunderbolt, knocking men right and left like tenpins. Across the
firelit open space between the burning huts he raced, clearing
crumpled corpses in his stride, splashing his rider from heel to
head as he thrashed through the puddles.</p>

<p>The Akinji made after the flying rider, loosing their shafts and
giving tongue like hounds. Those mounted spurred after him, while
those who had entered the village on foot ran through the broken
wall for their horses.</p>

<p>Arrows flickered about Gottfried's head as he put his steed at
the only point open to him&mdash;the unbroken western wall. It was
touch and go, for the footing was tricky and treacherous and never
had the gray stallion attempted such a leap. Gottfried held his
breath as he felt the great body beneath him gathering and tensing
in full flight for the desperate effort; then with a volcanic heave
of mighty thews the stallion rose in the air and cleared the
barrier with scarce an inch to spare.</p>

<p>The pursuers yelled in amazement and fury, and reined back. Born
horsemen though they were, they dared not attempt that breakneck
leap. They lost time seeking gates and breaks in the wall, and when
they finally emerged from the village, the black, dank, whispering,
dripping forest had swallowed up their prey.</p>

<p>Mikhal Oglu swore like a fiend and leaving his lieutenant Othman
in charge with instructions to leave no living human being in the
village, he pressed on after the fugitive, following the trail, by
torches, in the muddy mold, and swearing to run him down, if the
road led under the very walls of Vienna.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="vulture3" name="vulture3">CHAPTER 3</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">ALLAH did not will it that Mikhal Oglu should take
Gottfried von Kalmbach's head in the dark, dripping forest. He knew
the country better than they, and in spite of their zeal, they lost
his trail in the darkness.</p>

<p>Dawn found Gottfried riding through terror-stricken farmlands,
with the flame of a burning world lighting the east and south. The
country was thronged with fugitives, staggering under pitiful loads
of household goods, driving bellowing cattle, like people fleeing
the end of the world. The torrential rains that had offered false
promise of security had not long stayed the march of the Grand
Turk.</p>

<p>With a quarter-million followers he was ravaging the eastern
marches of Christendom. While Gottfried had loitered in the taverns
of isolated villages, drinking up the Sultan's bounty, Pesth and
Buda had fallen, the German soldiers of the latter having been
slaughtered by the Janizaries, after promises of safety sworn by
Suleyman, whom men named the Generous.</p>

<p>While Ferdinand and the nobles and bishops squabbled at the Diet
of Spires, the elements alone seemed to war for Christendom. Rain
fell in torrents, and through the floods that changed plains and
forest-bed to dank morasses, the Turks struggled grimly. They
drowned in raging rivers, and lost great stores of ammunition,
ordnance and supplies when boats capsized, bridges gave way, and
wagons mired. But on they came, driven by the implacable will of
Suleyman, and now in September, 1529, over the ruins of Hungary,
the Turk swept on Europe, with the Akinji&mdash;the
Sackmen&mdash;ravaging the land like the drift ahead of a
storm.</p>

<p>This in part Gottfried learned from the fugitives as he pushed
his weary stallion toward the city which was the only sanctuary for
the panting thousands. Behind him the skies flamed red and the
screams of butchered victims came dimly down the wind to his ears.
Sometimes he could even make out the swarming black masses of wild
horsemen. The wings of the vulture beat horrifically over that
butchered land and the shadows of those great wings fell across all
Europe. Again the destroyer was riding out of the blue mysterious
East as his brothers had ridden before
him&mdash;Attila&mdash;Subotai&mdash;Bayazid&mdash;Muhammad the
Conqueror. But never before had such a storm risen against the
West.</p>

<p>Before the waving vulture wings the road thronged with wailing
fugitives; behind them it ran red and silent, strewn with mangled
shapes that cried no more. The killers were not a half-hour behind
him when Gottfried von Kalmbach rode his reeling stallion through
the gates of Vienna. The people on the walls had heard the wailing
for hours, rising awfully on the wind, and now afar they saw the
sun flicker on the points of lances as the horsemen rode in amongst
the masses of fugitives toiling down from the hills into the plain
which girdles the city. They saw the play of naked steel like
sickles among ripe grain.</p>

<p>Von Kalmbach found the city in turmoil, the people swirling and
screaming about Count Nikolas Salm, the seventy-year-old warhorse
who commanded Vienna, and his aides, Roggendrof, Count Nikolas
Zrinyi and Paul Bakics. Salm was working with frantic haste,
leveling houses near the walls and using their material to brace
the ramparts, which were old and unstable, nowhere more than six
feet thick, and in many places crumbling and falling down. The
outer palisade was so frail it bore the name of
Stadtzaun&mdash;city hedge.</p>

<p>But under the lashing energy of Count Salm, a new wall twenty
feet high was thrown up from the Stuben to the Karnthner Gate.
Ditches interior to the old moat were dug, and ramparts erected
from the drawbridge to the Salz Gate. Roofs were stripped of
shingles, to lessen the chances of fire, and paving was ripped up
to soften the impact of cannonballs.</p>

<p>The suburbs had been deserted, and now they were fired lest they
give shelter to the besiegers. In the process, which was carried
out in the very teeth of the oncoming Sackmen, conflagrations broke
out in the city and added to the delirium.</p>

<p>It was all hell and bedlam turned loose, and in the midst of it,
five thousand wretched noncombatants, old men and women, and
children, were ruthlessly driven from the gates to shift for
themselves, and their screams, as the Akinjis swooped down,
maddened the people within the walls.</p>

<p>These hellions were arriving by thousands, topping the skylines,
and sweeping down on the city in irregular squadrons, like vultures
gathering about a dying camel.</p>

<p>Within an hour after the first swarm had appeared, not one
Christian remained alive outside the gates, except those bound by
long ropes to the saddle-peaks of their captors and forced to run
at full speed or be dragged to death.</p>

<p>The wild riders swirled about the walls, yelling and loosing
their shafts. Men on the towers recognized the dread Mikhal Oglu by
the wings on his cuirass, and noted that he rode from one heap of
dead to another, avidly scanning each corpse in turn, pausing to
glare questioningly at the battlements.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, from the west, a band of German and Spanish troops
cut their way through a cordon of Sackmen and marched into the
streets to the accompaniment of frenzied cheers, Philip the
Palgrave at their head.</p>

<p>Gottfried von Kalmbach leaned on his sword and watched them pass
in their gleaming breastplates and plumed crested helmets, with
long matchlocks on their shoulders and two-handed swords strapped
to their steel-clad backs. He was a curious contrast in his rusty
chain-mail, old-fashioned harness picked up here and there and
slovenly pieced together&mdash;he seemed like a figure out of the
past, rusty and tarnished, watching a newer, brighter generation go
by. Yet Philip saluted him, with a glance of recognition, as the
shining column swung past.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Von Kalmbach started toward the walls, where the gunners were
firing frugally at the Akinji, who showed some disposition to climb
upon the bastions on lariats thrown from their saddles. But on the
way he heard that Salm was impressing nobles and soldiers in the
task of digging moats and rearing new earthworks, and in great
haste he took refuge in a tavern, where he bullied the host, a
knock-kneed and apprehensive Wallachian, into giving him credit,
and rapidly drank himself into a state where no one would have
considered asking him to do work of any kind.</p>

<p>Shots, shouts and screams reached his ears, but he paid scant
heed. He knew that the Akinji would strike and pass on, to ravage
the country beyond. He learned from the tavern talk that Salm had
20,000 pikemen, 2,000 horsemen and 1,000 volunteer citizens to
oppose Suleyman's hordes, together with seventy guns&mdash;cannons,
demi-cannons and culverins.</p>

<p>The news of the Turks' numbers numbed all hearts with
dread&mdash;all but von Kalmbach's. He was a fatalist in his way.
But he discovered a conscience in ale, and was presently brooding
over the people the miserable Viennese had driven forth to perish.
The more he drank the more melancholy he became, and maudlin tears
dripped from the drooping ends of his mustaches.</p>

<p>At last he rose unsteadily and took up his great sword, muzzily
intent on challenging Count Salm to a duel because of the matter.
He bellowed down the timid importunities of the Wallachian and
weaved out on the street. To his groggy sight the towers and spires
cavorted crazily; people jostled him, knocking him aside as they
ran about aimlessly. Philip the Palgrave strode by clanking in his
armor, the keen dark faces of his Spaniards contrasting with the
square, florid countenances of the Lanzknechts.</p>

<p>"Shame upon you, von Kalmbach!" said Philip sternly. "The Turk
is upon us, and you keep your snout shoved in an ale-pot!"</p>

<p>"Whose snout is in what ale-pot?" demanded Gottfried, weaving in
an erratic half-circle as he fumbled at his sword. "Devil bite you,
Philip, I'll rap your pate for that&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Palgrave was already out of sight, and eventually Gottfried
found himself on the Karnthner Tower, only vaguely aware of how he
had got there. But what he saw sobered him suddenly. The Turk was
indeed upon Vienna. The plain was covered with his tents, thirty
thousand, some said, and swore that from the lofty spire of Saint
Stephen's cathedral a man could not see their limits. Four hundred
of his boats lay on the Danube, and Gottfried heard men cursing the
Austrian fleet which lay helpless far upstream, because its
sailors, long unpaid, refused to man the ships. He also heard that
Salm had made no reply at all to Suleyman's demand to
surrender.</p>

<p>Now, partly as a gesture, partly to awe the Caphar dogs, the
Grand Turk's array was moving in orderly procession before the
ancient walls before settling down to the business of the siege.
The sight was enough to awe the stoutest. The low-swinging sun
struck fire from polished helmet, jeweled saber-hilt and
lance-point. It was as if a river of shining steel flowed leisurely
and terribly past the walls of Vienna.</p>

<p>The Akinji, who ordinarily formed the vanguard of the host, had
swept on, but in their place rode the Tatars of Crimea, crouching
on their high-peaked, short-stirruped saddles, their gnome-like
heads guarded by iron helmets, their stocky bodies with bronze
breastplates and lacquered leather. Behind them came the Azabs, the
irregular infantry, Kurds and Arabs for the most part, a wild,
motley horde. Then their brothers, the Delis, the Madcaps, wild men
on tough ponies fantastically adorned with fur and feathers. The
riders wore caps and mantles of leopard skin; their unshorn hair
hung in tangled strands about their high shoulders, and over their
matted beards their eyes glared the madness of fanaticism and
bhang.</p>

<p>After them came the real body of the army. First the beys and
emirs with their retainers&mdash;horsemen and footmen from the
feudal fiefs of Asia Minor. Then the Spahis, the heavy cavalry, on
splendid steeds. And last of all the real strength of the Turkish
empire&mdash;the most terrible military organization in the
world&mdash;the Janizaries.</p>

<p>On the walls men spat in black fury, recognizing kindred blood.
For the Janizaries were not Turks. With a few exceptions, where
Turkish parents had smuggled their offspring into the ranks to save
them from the grinding life of a peasant, they were sons of
Christians&mdash;Greeks, Serbs, Hungarians&mdash;stolen in infancy
and raised in the ranks of Islam, knowing but one master&mdash;the
Sultan; but one occupation&mdash;slaughter.</p>

<p>Their beardless features contrasted with those of their Oriental
masters. Many had blue eyes and yellow mustaches. But all their
faces were stamped with the wolfish ferocity to which they had been
reared. Under their dark blue cloaks glinted fine mail, and many
wore steel skull-caps under their curious, high-peaked hats from
which depended a white sleeve-like piece of cloth, and through
which was thrust a copper spoon. Long bird-of-paradise plumes
likewise adorned these strange head-pieces.</p>

<p>Besides scimitars, pistols and daggers, each Janizary bore a
matchlock, and their officers carried pots of coals for the
lighting of the matches. Up and down the ranks scurried the
dervishes, clad only in kalpaks of camel-hair and green aprons
fringed with ebony beads, exhorting the Faithful. Military bands,
the invention of the Turk, marched with the columns, cymbals
clashing, lutes twanging. Over the flowing sea the banners tossed
and swayed&mdash;the crimson flag of the Spahis, the white banner
of the Janizaries with its two-edged sword worked in gold, and the
horse-tail standards of the rulers&mdash;seven tails for the
Sultan, six for the Grand Vizier, three for the Agha of the
Janizaries. So Suleyman paraded his power before despairing Caphar
eyes.</p>

<p>But von Kalmbach's gaze was centered on the groups that labored
to set up the ordnance of the Sultan. And he shook his head in
bewilderment.</p>

<p>"Demi-culverins, sakers, and falconets!" he grunted. "Where the
devil's all the heavy artillery Suleyman's so proud of?"</p>

<p>"At the bottom of the Danube!" A Hungarian pikeman grinned
fiercely and spat as he answered. "Wulf Hagen sank that part of the
Soldan's flotilla. The rest of his cannon and cannon royal, they
say, were mired because of the rains."</p>

<p>A slow grin bristled Gottfried's mustache.</p>

<p>"What was Suleyman's word to Salm?"</p>

<p>"That he'd eat breakfast in Vienna day after tomorrow&mdash;the
29th."</p>

<p>Gottfried shook his head ponderously.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="vulture4" name="vulture4">CHAPTER 4</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE SIEGE COMMENCED, with the roaring of cannons,
the whistling of arrows, and the blasting crash of matchlocks. The
Janizaries took possession of the ruined suburbs, where fragments
of walls gave them shelter. Under a screen of irregulars and a
volley of arrow-fire, they advanced methodically just after
dawn.</p>

<p>On a gun-turret on the threatened wall, leaning on his great
sword and meditatively twisting his mustache, Gottfried von
Kalmbach watched a Transylvanian gunner being carried off the wall,
his brains oozing from a hole in his head; a Turkish matchlock had
spoken too near the walls.</p>

<p>The field-pieces of the Sultan were barking like deep-toned
dogs, knocking chips off the battlements. The Janizaries were
advancing, kneeling, firing, reloading as they came on. Bullets
glanced from the crenelles and whined off venomously into space.
One flattened against Gottfried's hauberk, bringing an outraged
grunt from him. Turning toward the abandoned gun, he saw a
colorful, incongruous figure bending over the massive breech.</p>

<p>It was a woman, dressed as von Kalmbach had not seen even the
dandies of France dressed. She was tall, splendidly shaped, but
lithe. From under a steel cap escaped rebellious tresses that
rippled red gold in the sun over her compact shoulders. High boots
of Cordovan leather came to her mid-thighs, which were cased in
baggy breeches. She wore a shirt of fine Turkish mesh-mail tucked
into her breeches. Her supple waist was confined by a flowing sash
of green silk, into which were thrust a brace of pistols and a
dagger, and from which depended a long Hungarian saber. Over all
was carelessly thrown a scarlet cloak.</p>

<p>This surprizing figure was bending over the cannon, sighting it
in a manner betokening more than a passing familiarity, at a group
of Turks who were wheeling a carriage-gun just within range.</p>

<p>"Eh, Red Sonya!" shouted a man-at-arms, waving his pike. "Give
'em hell, my lass!"</p>

<p>"Trust me, dog-brother," she retorted as she applied the glowing
match to the vent. "But I wish my mark was Roxelana's&mdash;"</p>

<p>A terrific detonation drowned her words and a swirl of smoke
blinded every one on the turret, as the terrific recoil of the
overcharged cannon knocked the firer flat on her back. She sprang
up like a spring rebounding and rushed to the embrasure, peering
eagerly through the smoke, which clearing, showed the ruin of the
gun crew. The huge ball, bigger than a man's head, had smashed full
into the group clustered about the saker, and now they lay on the
torn ground, their skulls blasted by the impact, or their bodies
mangled by the flying iron splinters from their shattered gun. A
cheer went up from the towers, and the woman called Red Sonya
yelled with a sincere joy and did the steps of a Cossack dance.</p>

<p>Gottfried approached, eying in open admiration the splendid
swell of her bosom beneath the pliant mail, the curves of her ample
hips and rounded limbs. She stood as a man might stand, booted legs
braced wide apart, thumbs hooked into her girdle, but she was all
woman. She was laughing as she faced him, and he noted with
fascination the dancing sparkling lights and changing colors of her
eyes. She raked back her rebellious locks with a powder-stained
hand and he wondered at the clear pinky whiteness of her firm flesh
where it was unstained.</p>

<p>"Why did you wish for the Sultana Roxelana for a target, my
girl?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Because she's my sister, the slut!" answered Sonya.</p>

<p>At that instant a great cry thundered over the walls and the
girl started like a wild thing, ripping out her blade in a long
flash of silver in the sun.</p>

<p>"That bellow!" she cried. "The Janizaries&mdash;"</p>

<p>Gottfried was already on his way to the embrasures. He too had
heard before the terrible soul-shaking shout of the charging
Janizaries. Suleyman meant to waste no time on the city that barred
him from helpless Europe. He meant to crush its frail walls in one
storm. The bashi-bazouki, the irregulars, died like flies to screen
the main advance, and over heaps of their dead, the Janizaries
thundered against Vienna. In the teeth of cannonade and musket
volley they surged on, crossing the moats on scaling-ladders laid
across, bridge-like. Whole ranks went down as the Austrian guns
roared, but now the attackers were under the walls and the cumbrous
balls whirred over their heads, to work havoc in the rear
ranks.</p>

<p>The Spanish matchlock men, firing almost straight down, took
ghastly toll, but now the ladders gripped the walls, and the
chanting madmen surged upward. Arrows whistled, striking down the
defenders. Behind them the Turkish field-pieces boomed, careless of
injury to friend as well as foe. Gottfried, standing at an
embrasure, was overthrown by a sudden terrific impact. A ball had
smashed the merlon, braining half a dozen defenders.</p>

<p>Gottfried rose, half-stunned, out of the debris of masonry and
huddled corpses. He looked down into an uprushing waste of
snarling, impassioned faces, where eyes glared like mad dogs' and
blades glittered like sunbeams on water. Bracing his feet wide, he
heaved up his great sword and lashed down. His jaw jutted out, his
mustache bristled. The five-foot blade caved in steel caps and
skulls, lashing through uplifted bucklers and iron shoulder-pieces.
Men fell from the ladders, their nerveless fingers slipping from
the bloody rungs.</p>

<p>But they swarmed through the breach on either side of him. A
terrible cry announced that the Turks had a foothold on the wall.
But no man dared leave his post to go to the threatened point. To
the dazed defenders it seemed that Vienna was ringed by a
glittering, tossing sea that roared higher and higher about the
doomed walls.</p>

<p>Stepping back to avoid being hemmed in, Gottfried grunted and
lashed right and left. His eyes were no longer cloudy; they blazed
like blue balefire. Three Janizaries were down at his feet; his
broadsword clanged in a forest of slashing scimitars. A blade
splintered on his basinet, filling his eyes with fire-shot
blackness. Staggering, he struck back and felt his great blade
crunch home. Blood jetted over his hands and he tore his sword
clear. Then with a yell and a rush someone was at his side and he
heard the quick splintering of mail beneath the madly flailing
strokes of a saber that flashed like silver lightning before his
clearing sight.</p>

<p>It was Red Sonya who had come to his aid, and her onslaught was
no less terrible than that of a she-panther. Her strokes followed
each other too quickly for the eye to follow; her blade was a blur
of white fire, and men went down like ripe grain before the reaper.
With a deep roar Gottfried strode to her side, bloody and terrible,
swinging his great blade. Forced irresistibly back, the Moslems
wavered on the edge of the wall, then leaped for the ladders or
fell screaming through empty space.</p>

<p>Oaths flowed in a steady stream from Sonya's red lips and she
laughed wildly as her saber sang home and blood spurted along the
edge. The last Turk on the battlement screamed and parried wildly
as she pressed him; then dropping his scimitar, his clutching hands
closed desperately on her dripping blade. With a groan he swayed on
the edge, blood gushing from his horribly cut fingers.</p>

<p>"Hell to you, dog-soul!" she laughed. "The devil can stir your
broth for you!"</p>

<p>With a twist and a wrench she tore away her saber, severing the
wretch's fingers; with a moaning cry he pitched backward and fell
headlong.</p>

<p>On all sides the Janizaries were falling back. The field-pieces,
halted while the fighting went on upon the walls, were booming
again, and the Spaniards, kneeling at the embrasures, were
returning the fire with their long matchlocks.</p>

<p>Gottfried approached Red Sonya, who was cleansing her blade,
swearing softly.</p>

<p>"By God, my girl," said he, extending a huge hand, "had you not
come to my aid, I think I'd have supped in Hell this night. I
thank&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thank the devil!" retorted Sonya rudely, slapping his hand
aside. "The Turks were on the wall. Don't think I risked my hide to
save yours, dog-brother!"</p>

<p>And with a scornful flirt of her wide coattails, she swaggered
off down the battlements, giving back promptly and profanely the
rude sallies of the soldiers. Gottfried scowled after her, and a
Lanzknecht slapped him jovially on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Eh, she's a devil, that one! She drinks the strongest head
under the table and outswears a Spaniard. She's no man's light o'
love. Cut&mdash;slash&mdash;death to you, dog-soul! There's her
way."</p>

<p>"Who is she, in the devil's name?" growled von Kalmbach.</p>

<p>"Red Sonya from Rogatino&mdash;that's all we know. Marches and
fights like a man&mdash;God knows why. Swears she's sister to
Roxelana, the Soldan's favorite. If the Tatars who grabbed Roxelana
that night had got Sonya, by Saint Piotr! Suleyman would have had a
handful! Let her alone, sir brother; she's a wildcat. Come and have
a tankard of ale."</p>

<hr>

<p>The Janizaries, summoned before the Grand Vizier to explain why
the attack failed after the wall had been scaled at one place,
swore they had been confronted by a devil in the form of a
red-headed woman, aided by a giant in rusty mail.</p>

<p>Ibrahim discounted the woman, but the description of the man
woke a half-forgotten memory in his mind. After dismissing the
soldiers, he summoned the Tatar, Yaruk Khan, and dispatched him
up-country to demand of Mikhal Oglu why he had not sent a certain
head to the royal tent.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="vulture5" name="vulture5">CHAPTER 5</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">SULEYMAN did not eat his breakfast in Vienna on
the morning of the 29th. He stood on the height of Semmering,
before his rich pavilion with its gold-knobbed pinnacles and its
guard of five hundred Solaks, and watched his light batteries
pecking away vainly at the frail walls; he saw his irregulars
wasting their lives like water, striving to fill the fosse, and he
saw his sappers burrowing like moles, driving mines and
counter-mines nearer and nearer the bastions.</p>

<p>Within the city there was little ease. Night and day the walls
were manned. In their cellars the Viennese watched the faint
vibrations of peas on drumheads that betrayed the sounds of digging
in the earth. They told of Turkish mines burrowing under the walls,
and sank their counter-mines, accordingly. Men fought no less
fiercely under the earth than above.</p>

<p>Vienna was the one Christian island in a sea of infidels. Night
by night men watched the horizons burning where the Akinji yet
scoured the agonized land. Occasionally word came from the outer
world&mdash;slaves escaping from the camp to slipping into the
city. Always their news was fresh horror. In Upper Austria less
than a third of the inhabitants were left alive; Mikhal Oglu was
outdoing himself. And the people said that it was evident the
vulture-winged one was looking for one in particular. His slayers
brought men's heads and heaped them high before him; he avidly
searched among the grisly relics, then, apparently in fiendish
disappointment, drove his devils to new atrocities.</p>

<p>These tales, instead of paralyzing the Austrians with dread,
fired them with the mad fury of desperation. Mines exploded,
breaches were made and the Turks swarmed in, but always the
desperate Christians were there before them, and in the choking,
blind, wild-beast madness of hand-to-hand fighting they paid in
part the red debt they owed.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
September dwindled into October; the leaves turned brown and yellow
on Wiener Wald, and the winds blew cold. The watchers shivered at
night on the walls that whitened to the bite of the frost; but
still the tents ringed the city; and still Suleyman sat in his
magnificent pavilion and glared at the frail barrier that barred
his imperial path. None but Ibrahim dared speak to him; his mood
was black as the cold nights that crept down from the northern
hills. The wind that moaned outside his tent seemed a dirge for his
ambitions of conquest.</p>

<p>Ibrahim watched him narrowly, and after a vain onset that lasted
from dawn till midday, he called off the Janizaries and bade them
retire into the ruined suburbs and rest. And he sent a bowman to
shoot a very certain shaft into a very certain part of the city,
where certain persons were waiting for just such an event.</p>

<p>No more attacks were made that day. The field-pieces, which had
been pounding at the Karnthner Gate for days, were shifted
northward, to hammer at the Burg. As an assault on that part of the
wall seemed imminent, the bulk of the soldiery was shifted there.
But the onslaught did not come, though the batteries kept up a
steady fire, hour after hour. Whatever the reason, the soldiers
gave thanks for the respite; they were dizzy with fatigue, mad with
raw wounds and lack of sleep.</p>

<p>That night the great square, the Am-Hof market, seethed with
soldiers, while civilians looked on enviously. A great store of
wine had been discovered hidden in the cellars of a rich Jewish
merchant, who hoped to reap triple profit when all other liquor in
the city was gone. In spite of their officers, the half-crazed men
rolled the great hogsheads into the square and broached them. Salm
gave up the attempt to control them. Better drunkenness, growled
the old warhorse, than for the men to fall in their tracks from
exhaustion. He paid the Jew from his own purse. In relays the
soldiers came from the walls and drank deep.</p>

<p>In the glare of cressets and torches, to the accompaniment of
drunken shouts and songs, to which the occasional rumble of a
cannon played a sinister undertone, von Kalmbach dipped his basinet
into a barrel and brought it out brimful and dripping. Sinking his
mustache into the liquid, he paused as his clouded eyes, over the
rim of the steel cap, rested on a strutting figure on the other
side of the hogshead. Resentment touched his expression. Red Sonya
had already visited more than one barrel. Her burganet was thrust
sidewise on her rebellious locks, her swagger was wilder, her eyes
more mocking.</p>

<p>"Ha!" she cried scornfully. "It's the Turk-killer, with his nose
deep in the keg, as usual! Devil bite all topers!"</p>

<p>She consistently thrust a jeweled goblet into the crimson flood
and emptied it at a gulp. Gottfried stiffened resentfully. He had
had a tilt with Sonya already, and he still smarted.</p>

<p>"Why should I even look at you, in your ragged harness and empty
purse," she had mocked, "when even Paul Bakics is mad for me? Go
along, guzzler, beer-keg!"</p>

<p>"Be damned to you," he had retorted. "You needn't be so high,
just because your sister is the Soldan's mistress&mdash;"</p>

<p>At that she had flown into an awful passion, and they had parted
with mutual curses. Now, from the devil in her eyes, he saw that
she intended making things further uncomfortable for him.</p>

<p>"Hussy!" he growled. "I'll drown you in this hogshead."</p>

<p>"Nay, you'll drown yourself first, boar-pig!" she shouted amid a
roar of rough laughter. "A pity you aren't as valiant against the
Turks as you are against the wine-butts!"</p>

<p>"Dogs bite you, slut!" he roared. "How can I break their heads
when they stand off and pound us with cannon balls? Shall I throw
my dagger at them from the wall?"</p>

<p>"There are thousands just outside," she retorted in the madness
induced by drink and her own wild nature, "if any had the guts to
go to them."</p>

<p>"By God!" the maddened giant dragged out his great sword. "No
baggage can call <i>me</i> coward, sot or not! I'll go out upon
them, if never a man follow me!"</p>

<p>Bedlam followed his bellow; the drunken temper of the crowd was
fit for such madness. The nearly empty hogsheads were deserted as
men tipsily drew sword and reeled toward the outer gates.</p>

<p>Wulf Hagen fought his way into the storm, buffeting men right
and left, shouting fiercely, "Wait, you drunken fools! Don't surge
out in this shape! Wait&mdash;" They brushed him aside, sweeping on
in a blind senseless torrent.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Dawn was just beginning to tip the eastern hills. Somewhere in the
strangely silent Turkish camp a drum began to throb. Turkish
sentries stared wildly and loosed their matchlocks in the air to
warn the camp, appalled at the sight of the Christian horde pouring
over the narrow drawbridge, eight thousand strong, brandishing
swords and ale tankards. As they foamed over the moat a terrific
explosion rent the din, and a portion of the wall near the
Karnthner Gate seemed to detach itself and rise into the air. A
great shout rose from the Turkish camp, but the attackers did not
pause.</p>

<p>They rushed headlong into the suburbs, and there they saw the
Janizaries, not rousing from slumber, but fully clad and armed,
being hurriedly drawn up in charging lines. Without pausing, they
burst headlong into the half-formed ranks. Far outnumbered, their
drunken fury and velocity was yet irresistible. Before the madly
thrashing axes and lashing broadswords, the Janizaries reeled back
dazed and disordered. The suburbs became a shambles where battling
men, slashing and hewing at one another, stumbled on mangled bodies
and severed limbs. Suleyman and Ibrahim, on the height of
Semmering, saw the invincible Janizaries in full retreat, streaming
out toward the hills.</p>

<p>In the city the rest of the defenders were working madly to
repair the great breach the mysterious explosion had torn in the
wall. Salm gave thanks for that drunken sortie. But for it, the
Janizaries would have been pouring through the breach before the
dust settled.</p>

<p>All was confusion in the Turkish camp. Suleyman ran to his horse
and took charge in person, shouting at the Spahis. They formed
ranks and swung down the slopes in orderly squadrons. The Christian
warriors, still following their fleeing enemies, suddenly awakened
to their danger. Before them the Janizaries were still falling
back, but on either flank the horsemen of Asia were galloping to
cut them off.</p>

<p>Fear replaced drunken recklessness. They began to fall back, and
the retreat quickly became a rout. Screaming in blind panic they
threw away their weapons and fled for the drawbridge. The Turks
rode them down to the water's edge, and tried to follow them across
the bridge, into the gates which were opened for them. And there at
the bridge Wulf Hagen and his retainers met the pursuers and held
them hard. The flood of the fugitives flowed past him to safety; on
him the Turkish tide broke like a red wave. He loomed, a steel-clad
giant, in a waste of spears.</p>

<p>Gottfried von Kalmbach did not voluntarily quit the field, but
the rush of his companions swept him along the tide of flight,
blaspheming bitterly. Presently he lost his footing and his
panic-stricken comrades stampeded across his prostrate frame. When
the frantic heels ceased to drum on his mail, he raised his head
and saw that he was near the fosse, and naught but Turks about him.
Rising, he ran lumberingly toward the moat, into which he plunged
unexpectedly, looking back over his shoulder at a pursuing
Moslem.</p>

<p>He came up floundering and spluttering, and made for the
opposite bank, splashing water like a buffalo. The blood-mad
Muhammadan was close behind him&mdash;an Algerian corsair, as much
at home in water as out. The stubborn German would not drop his
great sword, and burdened by his mail, just managed to reach the
other bank, where he clung, utterly exhausted and unable to lift a
hand in defense as the Algerian swirled in, dagger gleaming above
his naked shoulder. Then someone swore heartily on the bank hard
by. A slim hand thrust a long pistol into the Algerian's face; he
screamed as it exploded, making a ghastly ruin of his head. Another
slim, strong hand gripped the sinking German by the scruff of his
mail.</p>

<p>"Grab the bank, fool!" gritted a voice, indicative of great
effort. "I can't heave you up alone; you must weigh a ton. Pull,
dolt, pull!"</p>

<p>Blowing, gasping and floundering, Gottfried half-clambered, was
half lifted, out of the moat. He showed some disposition to lie on
his belly and retch, what of the dirty water he had swallowed, but
his rescuer urged him to his feet.</p>

<p>"The Turks are crossing the bridge and the lads are closing the
gates against them&mdash;haste, before we're cut off."</p>

<p>Inside the gate Gottfried stared about, as if waking from a
dream.</p>

<p>"Where's Wulf Hagen? I saw him holding the bridge."</p>

<p>"Lying dead among twenty dead Turks," answered Red Sonya.</p>

<p>Gottfried sat down on a piece of fallen wall, and because he was
shaken and exhausted, and still mazed with drink and blood-lust, he
sank his face in his huge hands and wept. Sonya kicked him
disgustedly.</p>

<p>"Name o' Satan, man, don't sit and blubber like a spanked
schoolgirl. You drunkards had to play the fool, but that can't be
mended. Come&mdash;let's go to the Walloon's tavern and drink
ale."</p>

<p>"Why did you pull me out of the moat?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Because a great oaf like you never can help himself. I see you
need a wise person like me to keep life in that hulking frame."</p>

<p>"But I thought you despised me!"</p>

<p>"Well, a woman can change her mind, can't she?" she snapped.</p>

<p>Along the walls the pikemen were repelling the frothing Moslems,
thrusting them off the partly repaired breach. In the royal
pavilion Ibrahim was explaining to his master that the devil had
undoubtedly inspired that drunken sortie just at the right moment
to spoil the Grand Vizier's carefully laid plans. Suleyman, wild
with fury, spoke shortly to his friend for the first time.</p>

<p>"Nay, thou hast failed. Have done with thine intrigues. Where
craft has failed, sheer force shall prevail. Send a rider for the
Akinji; they are needed here to replace the fallen. Bid the hosts
to the attack again."</p>

<h2><a id="vulture6" name="vulture6">CHAPTER 6</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE PRECEDING ONSLAUGHTS were naught to the storm
that now burst on Vienna's reeling walls. Night and day the cannons
flashed and thundered. Bombs burst on roofs and in the streets.
When men died on the walls there was none to take their places.
Fear of famine stalked the streets and the darker fear of treachery
ran black-mantled through the alleys.</p>

<p>Investigation showed that the blast that had rent the Karnthner
wall had not been fired from without. In a mine tunneled from an
unsuspected cellar inside the city, a heavy charge of powder had
been exploded beneath the wall. One or two men, working secretly,
might have done it. It was now apparent that the bombardment of the
Burg had been merely a gesture to draw attention away from the
Karnthner wall, to give the traitors an opportunity to work
undiscovered.</p>

<p>Count Salm and his aides did the work of giants. The aged
commander, fired with superhuman energy, trod the walls, braced the
faltering, aided the wounded, fought in the breaches side by side
with the common soldiers, while death dealt his blows
unsparingly.</p>

<p>But if death supped within the walls, he feasted full without.
Suleyman drove his men as relentlessly as if he were their worst
foe. Plague stalked among them, and the ravaged countryside yielded
no food. The cold winds howled down from the Carpathians and the
warriors shivered in their light Oriental garb. In the frosty
nights the hands of the sentries froze to their matchlocks. The
ground grew hard as flint and the sappers toiled feebly with
blunted tools. Rain fell, mingled with sleet, extinguishing
matches, wetting powder, turning the plain outside the city to a
muddy wallow, where rotting corpses sickened the living.</p>

<p>Suleyman shuddered as with an ague, as he looked out over the
camp. He saw his warriors, worn and haggard, toiling in the muddy
plain like ghosts under the gloomy leaden skies. The stench of his
slaughtered thousands was in his nostrils. In that instant it
seemed to the Sultan that he looked on a gray plain of the dead,
where corpses dragged their lifeless bodies to an outworn task,
animated only by the ruthless will of their master. For an instant
the Tatar in his veins rose above the Turk and he shook with fear.
Then his lean jaws set. The walls of Vienna staggered drunkenly,
patched and repaired in a score of places. How could they
stand?</p>

<p>"Sound for the onslaught. Thirty thousand aspers to the first
man on the walls!"</p>

<p>The Grand Vizier spread his hands helplessly. "The spirit is
gone out of the warriors. They can not endure the miseries of this
icy land."</p>

<p>"Drive them to the walls with whips," answered Suleyman, grimly.
"This is the gate to Frankistan. It is through it we must ride the
road to empire."</p>

<p>Drums thundered through the camp. The weary defenders of
Christendom rose up and gripped their weapons, electrified by the
instinctive knowledge that the death-grip had come.</p>

<p>In the teeth of roaring matchlocks and swinging broadswords, the
officers of the Sultan drove the Moslem hosts. Whips cracked and
men cried out blasphemously up and down the lines. Maddened, they
hurled themselves at the reeling walls, riddled with great
breaches, yet still barriers behind which desperate men could
crouch. Charge after charge rolled on over the choked fosse, broke
on the staggering walls, and rolled back, leaving its wash of dead.
Night fell unheeded, and through the darkness, lighted by blaze of
cannon and flare of torches, the battle raged. Driven by Suleyman's
terrible will, the attackers fought throughout the night, heedless
of all Moslem tradition.</p>

<p>Dawn rose as on Armageddon. Before the walls of Vienna lay a
vast carpet of steel-clad dead. Their plumes waved in the wind. And
across the corpses staggered the hollow-eyed attackers to grapple
with the dazed defenders.</p>

<p>The steel tides rolled and broke, and rolled on again, till the
very gods must have stood aghast at the giant capacity of men for
suffering and enduring. It was the Armageddon of races&mdash;Asia
against Europe. About the walls raved a sea of Eastern
faces&mdash;Turks, Tatars, Kurds, Arabs, Algerians, snarling,
screaming, dying before the roaring matchlocks of the Spaniards,
the thrust of Austrian pikes, the strokes of the German
Lanzknechts, who swung their two-handed swords like reapers mowing
ripe grain. Those within the walls were no more heroic than those
without, stumbling among fields of their own dead.</p>

<p>To Gottfried von Kalmbach, life had faded to a single
meaning&mdash;the swinging of his great sword. In the wide breach
by the Karnthner Tower he fought until time lost all meaning. For
long ages maddened faces rose snarling before him, the faces of
devils, and scimitars flashed before his eyes everlastingly. He did
not feel his wounds, nor the drain of weariness. Gasping in the
choking dust, blind with sweat and blood, he dealt death like a
harvest, dimly aware that at his side a slim, pantherish figure
swayed and smote&mdash; at first with laughter, curses and snatches
of song, later in grim silence.</p>

<p>His identity as an individual was lost in that cataclysm of
swords. He hardly knew it when Count Salm was death-stricken at his
side by a bursting bomb. He was not aware when night crept over the
hills, nor did he realize at last that the tide was slackening and
ebbing. He was only dimly aware that Nikolas Zrinyi tore him away
from the corpse-choked breach, saying, "God's name, man, go and
sleep. We've beaten them off&mdash;for the time being, at
least."</p>

<p>He found himself in a narrow, winding street, all dark and
forsaken. He had no idea of how he had got there, but seemed
vaguely to remember a hand on his elbow, tugging, guiding. The
weight of his mail pulled at his sagging shoulders. He could not
tell if the sound he heard were the cannon fitfully roaring, or a
throbbing in his own head. It seemed there was someone he should
look for&mdash;someone who meant a great deal to him. But all was
vague. Somewhere, sometime, it seemed long, long ago, a
sword-stroke had cleft his basinet. When he tried to think he
seemed to feel again the impact of that terrible blow, and his
brain swam. He tore off the dented head-piece and cast it into the
street.</p>

<p>Again the hand was tugging at his arm. A voice urged, "Wine, my
lord&mdash;drink!"</p>

<p>Dimly he saw a lean, black-mailed figure extending a tankard.
With a gasp he caught at it and thrust his muzzle into the stinging
liquor, gulping like a man dying of thirst. Then something burst in
his brain. The night filled with a million flashing sparks, as if a
powder magazine had exploded in his head. After that, darkness and
oblivion.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
He came slowly to himself, aware of a raging thirst, an aching
head, and an intense weariness that seemed to paralyze his limbs.
He was bound hand and foot, and gagged. Twisting his head, he saw
that he was in a small bare dusty room, from which a winding stone
stair led up. He deduced that he was in the lower part of the
tower.</p>

<p>Over a guttering candle on a crude table stooped two men. They
were both lean and hook-nosed, clad in plain black
garments&mdash;Asiatics, past doubt.</p>

<p>Gottfried listened to their low-toned conversation. He had
picked up many languages in his wanderings. He recognized
them&mdash;Tshoruk and his son Rhupen, Armenian merchants. He
remembered that he had seen Tshoruk often in the last week or so,
ever since the domed helmets of the Akinji had appeared in
Suleyman's camp. Evidently the merchant had been shadowing him, for
some reason. Tshoruk was reading what he had written on a bit of
parchment.</p>

<p class="letter">"My lord, though I blew up the Karnthner wall in
vain, yet I have news to make my lord's heart glad. My son and I
have taken the German, von Kalmbach. As he left the wall, dazed
with fighting, we followed, guiding him subtly to the ruined tower
whereof you know, and giving him drugged wine, bound him fast. Let
my lord send the emir Mikhal Oglu to the wall by the tower, and we
will give him into thy hands. We will bind him on the old mangonel
and cast him over the wall like a tree trunk."</p>

<p>The Armenian took up an arrow and began to bind the parchment
about the shaft with light silver wire.</p>

<p>"Take this to the roof, and shoot it toward the mantlet, as
usual," he began, when Rhupen exclaimed, "Hark!" and both froze,
their eyes glittering like those of trapped vermin&mdash;fearful
yet vindictive.</p>

<p>Gottfried gnawed at the gag; it slipped. Outside he heard a
familiar voice. "Gottfried! Where the devil are you?"</p>

<p>His breath burst from him in a stentorian roar. "Hey, Sonya!
Name of the devil! Be careful, girl&mdash;"</p>

<p>Tshoruk snarled like a wolf and struck him savagely on the head
with a scimitar hilt. Almost instantly, it seemed, the door crashed
inward. As in a dream Gottfried saw Red Sonya framed in the
doorway, pistol in hand. Her face was drawn and haggard; her eyes
burned like coals. Her basinet was gone, and her scarlet cloak. Her
mail was hacked and red-clotted, her boots slashed, her silken
breeches splashed and spotted with blood.</p>

<p>With a croaking cry Tshoruk ran at her, scimitar lifted. Before
he could strike, she crashed down the barrel of the empty pistol on
his head, felling him like an ox. From the other side Rhupen
slashed at her with a curved Turkish dagger. Dropping the pistol,
she closed with the young Oriental. Moving like someone in a dream,
she bore him irresistibly backward, one hand gripping his wrist,
the other his throat. Throttling him slowly, she inexorably crashed
his head again and again against the stones of the wall, until his
eyes rolled up and set. Then she threw him from her like a sack of
loose salt.</p>

<p>"God!" she muttered thickly, reeling an instant in the center of
the room, her hands to her head. Then she went to the captive and
sinking stiffly to her knees, cut his bonds with fumbling strokes
that sliced his flesh as well as the cords.</p>

<p>"How did you find me?" he asked stupidly, clambering stiffly
up.</p>

<p>She reeled to the table and sank down in a chair. A flagon of
wine stood at her elbow and she seized it avidly and drank. Then
she wiped her mouth on her sleeve and surveyed him wearily but with
renewed life.</p>

<p>"I saw you leave the wall and followed. I was so drunk from the
fighting I scarce knew what I did. I saw those dogs take your arm
and lead you into the alleys, and then I lost sight of you. But I
found your burganet lying outside in the street, and began shouting
for you. What the hell's the meaning of this?"</p>

<p>She picked up the arrow, and blinked at the parchment fastened
to it. Evidently she could read the Turkish characters, but she
scanned it half a dozen times before the meaning became apparent to
her exhaustion-numbed brain. Then her eyes flickered dangerously to
the men on the floor. Tshoruk sat up, dazedly feeling the gash in
his scalp; Rhupen lay retching and gurgling on the floor.</p>

<p>"Tie them up, brother," she ordered, and Gottfried obeyed. The
victims eyed the woman much more apprehensively than him.</p>

<p>"This missive is addressed to Ibrahim, the Wezir," she said
abruptly. "Why does he want Gottfried's head?"</p>

<p>"Because of a wound he gave the Sultan at Mohacz," muttered
Tshoruk uneasily.</p>

<p>"And you, you lower-than-a-dog," she smiled mirthlessly, "you
fired the mine by the Karnthner! You and your spawn are the
traitors among us."</p>

<p>She drew and primed a pistol. "When Zrinyi learns of you," she
said, "your end will be neither quick nor sweet. But first, you old
swine, I'm going to give myself the pleasure of blowing out your
cub's brains before your eyes&mdash;"</p>

<p>The older Armenian gave a choking cry. "God of my fathers, have
mercy! Kill me&mdash;torture me&mdash;but spare my son!"</p>

<p>At that instant a new sound split the unnatural quiet&mdash;a
great peal of bells shattered the air.</p>

<p>"What's this?" roared Gottfried, groping wildly at his empty
scabbard.</p>

<p>"The bells of Saint Stephen!" cried Sonya. "They peal for
victory!"</p>

<p><br>
<br>
She sprang for the sagging stair and he followed her up the
perilous way. They came out on a sagging shattered roof, on a
firmer part of which stood an ancient stone-casting machine, relic
of an earlier age, and evidently recently repaired.</p>

<p>The tower overlooked an angle of the wall, at which there were
no watchers. A section of the ancient glacis, and a ditch interior
the main moat, coupled with a steep natural pitch of the earth
beyond, made the point practically invulnerable.</p>

<p>The spies had been able to exchange messages here with little
fear of discovery, and it was easy to guess the method used. Down
the slope, just within long arrow-shot, stood up a huge mantlet of
bullhide stretched on a wooden frame, as if abandoned there by
chance. Gottfried knew that message-laden arrows were loosed from
the tower roof into this mantlet.</p>

<p>But just then he gave little thought to that. His attention was
riveted on the Turkish camp. There a leaping glare paled the
spreading dawn; above the mad clangor of the bells rose the crackle
of flames, mingled with awful screams.</p>

<p>"The Janizaries are burning their prisoners," said Red
Sonya.</p>

<p>"Judgment Day in the morning," muttered Gottfried, awed at the
sight that met his eyes.</p>

<p>From their eyrie the companions could see almost all of the
plain. Under a cold gray leaden sky, tinged a somber crimson with
dawn, it lay strewn with Turkish corpses as far as the sight would
carry.</p>

<p>And the hosts of the living were melting away. From Semmering
the great pavilion had vanished. The other tents were now coming
down fast. Already the head of the long column was out of sight,
moving into the hills through the cold dawn.</p>

<p>Snow began falling in light swift flakes.</p>

<p>"They shot their bolt last night," said Red Sonya to von
Kalmbach. "I saw their officers lashing them, and heard them cry
out in fear beneath our swords. Flesh and blood could stand no
more.</p>

<p>The snow continued to fall.</p>

<p>The Janizaries were glutting their mad disappointment on their
helpless captives, hurling men, women and children living into the
flames they had kindled under the somber eyes of their master, the
monarch men called the Magnificent, the Merciful. All the time the
bells of Vienna clanged and thundered as if their bronze throats
would burst.</p>

<p>Look!" cried Red Sonya, and she clutched her companion's arm.
"The Akinji will form the rear-guard."</p>

<p>Even at that distance they made out a pair of vulture wings
moving among the dark masses; the sullen light glimmered on a
jeweled helmet. Sonya's powder-stained hands clenched so that the
pink, broken nails bit into the white palms, and she spat out a
Cossack curse that burned like vitriol.</p>

<p>"There he goes, the bastard that made Austria a desert! How
easily the souls of the butchered folk ride on his cursed winged
shoulders! Anyway, old warhorse, he didn't get your head."</p>

<p>"While he lives it'll ride loose on my shoulders," rumbled the
giant.</p>

<p>Red Sonya's keen eyes narrowed suddenly. Seizing Gottfried's
arm, she hurried downstairs. They did not see Nikolas Zrinyi and
Paul Bakics ride out of the gates with their tattered retainers,
risking their lives in sorties to rescue prisoners. Steel clashed
along the line of march, and the Akinji retreated slowly, fighting
a good rear-guard action, balking the headlong courage of the
attackers by their very numbers. Safe in the depths of his
horsemen, Mikhal Oglu grinned sardonically. But Suleyman, riding in
the main column, did not grin. His face was like a death-mask.</p>

<p>Back in the ruined tower, Red Sonya propped one booted foot on a
chair, and cupping her chin in her hand, stared into the
fear-dulled eyes of Tshoruk.</p>

<p>"What will you give for your life?"</p>

<p>The Armenian made no reply.</p>

<p>"What will you give for the life of your whelp?"</p>

<p>The Armenian started as if stung. "Spare my son, princess," he
groaned. "Anything&mdash;I will pay&mdash;I will do anything."</p>

<p>She threw a shapely booted leg across the chair and sat
down.</p>

<p>"I want you to bear a message to a man."</p>

<p>"What man?"</p>

<p>"Mikhal Oglu."</p>

<p>He shuddered and moistened his lips with his tongue.</p>

<p>"Instruct me; I obey," he whispered.</p>

<p>"Good. We'll free you and give you a horse. Your son shall
remain here as hostage. If you fail us, I'll give the cub to the
Viennese to play with&mdash;"</p>

<p>Again the old Armenian shuddered.</p>

<p>"But if you play squarely, we'll let you both go free, and my
pal and I will forget about this treachery. I want you to ride
after Mikhal Oglu and tell him&mdash;"</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Through the slush and driving snow, the Turkish column plodded
slowly. Horses bent their heads to the blast; up and down the
straggling lines camels groaned and complained, and oxen bellowed
pitifully. Men stumbled through the mud, leaning beneath the weight
of their arms and equipment. Night was falling, but no command had
been given to halt. All day the retreating host had been harried by
the daring Austrian cuirassiers who darted down upon them like
wasps, tearing captives from their very hands.</p>

<p>Grimly rode Suleyman among his Solaks. He wished to put as much
distance as possible between himself and the scene of his first
defeat, where the rotting bodies of thirty thousand Muhammadans
reminded him of his crushed ambitions. Lord of western Asia he was;
master of Europe he could never be. Those despised walls had saved
the Western world from Moslem dominion, and Suleyman knew it. The
rolling thunder of the Ottoman power re-echoed around the world,
paling the glories of Persia and Mogul India. But in the West the
yellow-haired Aryan barbarian stood unshaken. It was not written
that the Turk should rule beyond the Danube.</p>

<p>Suleyman had seen this written in blood and fire, as he stood on
Semmering and saw his warriors fall back from the ramparts, despite
the flailing lashes of their officers. It had been to save his
authority that he gave the order to break camp&mdash;it burned his
tongue like gall, but already his soldiers were burning their tents
and preparing to desert him. Now in darkly brooding silence he
rode, not even speaking to Ibrahim.</p>

<p>In his own way Mikhal Oglu shared their savage despondency. It
was with a ferocious reluctance that he turned his back on the land
he had ruined, as a half-glutted panther might be driven from its
prey. He recalled with satisfaction the blackened, corpse-littered
wastes&mdash;the screams of tortured men&mdash;the cries of girls
writhing in his iron arms; recalled with much the same sensations
the death-shrieks of those same girls in the blood-fouled hands of
his killers.</p>

<p>But he was stung with the disappointment of a task
undone&mdash;for which the Grand Vizier had lashed him with
stinging word. He was out of favor with Ibrahim. For a lesser man
that might have meant a bowstring. For him it meant that he would
have to perform some prodigious feat to reinstate himself. In this
mood he was dangerous and reckless as a wounded panther.</p>

<p>Snow fell heavily, adding to the miseries of the retreat.
Wounded men fell in the mire and lay still, covered by a growing
white mantle. Mikhal Oglu rode among his rearmost ranks, straining
his eyes into the darkness. No foe had been sighted for hours. The
victorious Austrians had ridden back to their city.</p>

<p>The columns were moving slowly through a ruined village, whose
charred beams and crumbling fire-seared walls stood blackly in the
falling snow. Word came back down the lines that the Sultan would
pass on through and camp in a valley which lay a few miles
beyond.</p>

<p>The quick drum of hoofs back along the way they had come caused
the Akinji to grip their lances and glare slit-eyed into the
flickering darkness. They heard but a single horse, and a voice
calling the name of Mikhal Oglu. With a word the chief stayed a
dozen lifted bows, and shouted in return. A tall, gray stallion
loomed out of the flying snow, a black-mantled figure crouched
grotesquely atop of it.</p>

<p>"Tshoruk! You Armenian dog! What in the name of
Allah&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Armenian rode close to Mikhal Oglu and whispered urgently in
his ear. The cold bit through the thickest garments. The Akinji
noted that Tshoruk was trembling violently. His teeth chattered and
he stammered in his speech. But the Turk's eyes blazed at the
import of his message.</p>

<p>"Dog, do you lie?"</p>

<p>"May I rot in hell if I lie!" A strong shudder shook Tshoruk and
he drew his kaftan close about him. "He fell from his horse, riding
with the cuirassiers to attack the rear-guard, and lies with a
broken leg in a deserted peasant's hut some three miles
back&mdash;alone except for his mistress Red Sonya, and three or
four Lanzknechts, who are drunk on wine they found in the deserted
camp."</p>

<p>Mikhal Oglu wheeled his horse with sudden intent.</p>

<p>"Twenty men to me!" he barked. "The rest ride on with the main
column. I go after a head worth its weight in gold. I'll overtake
you before you go in camp."</p>

<p>Othman caught his jeweled rein. "Are you mad, to ride back now?
The whole country will be on our heels&mdash;"</p>

<p>He reeled in his saddle as Mikhal Oglu slashed him across the
mouth with his riding whip. The chief wheeled away, followed by the
men he had designated. Like ghosts they vanished into the spectral
darkness.</p>

<p>Othman sat his horse uncertainly, looking after them. The snow
shafted down, the wind sobbed drearily among the bare branches.
There was no sound except the receding noises of the trudging
column. Presently these ceased. Then Othman started. Back along the
way they had come, he heard a distant reverberation, a roar as of
forty or fifty matchlocks speaking together. In the utter silence
which followed, panic came upon Othman and his warriors. Whirling
away they fled through the ruined village after the retreating
horde.</p>

<h2><a id="vulture7" name="vulture7">CHAPTER 7</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">NONE NOTICED when night fell on Constantinople,
for the splendor of Suleyman made night no less glorious than day.
Through gardens that were riots of blossoms and perfume, cressets
twinkled like myriad fireflies. Fireworks turned the city into a
realm of shimmering magic, above which the minarets of five hundred
mosques rose like towers of fire in an ocean of golden foam.
Tribesmen on Asian hills gaped and marveled at the blaze that
pulsed and glowed afar, paling the very stars. The streets of
Stamboul were thronged with crowds in the attire of holiday and
rejoicing. The million lights shone on jeweled turban and striped
khalat&mdash;on dark eyes sparkling over filmy veils&mdash;on
shining palanquins borne on the shoulders of huge ebony-skinned
slaves.</p>

<p>All that splendor centered in the Hippodrome, where in lavish
pageants the horsemen of Turkistan and Tatary competed in
breathtaking races with the riders of Egypt and Arabia, where
warriors in glittering mail spilled one another's blood on the
sands, where swordsmen were matched against wild beasts, and lions
were pitted against tigers of Bengal and boars from northern
forests. One might have deemed the imperial pageantry of Rome
revived in Eastern garb.</p>

<p>On a golden throne, set upon lapis lazuli pillars, Suleyman
reclined, gazing on the splendors, as purple-togaed Caesars had
gazed before him. About him bowed his viziers and officers, and the
ambassadors from foreign courts&mdash;Venice, Persia, India, the
khanates of Tatary. They came&mdash;including the
Venetians&mdash;to congratulate him on his victory over the
Austrians. For this grand fete was in celebration of that victory,
as set forth in a manifesto under the Sultan's hand, which stated,
in part, that the Austrians having made submission and sued for
pardon on their knees, and the German realms being so distant from
the Ottoman empire, "the Faithful would not trouble to clean out
the fortress (Vienna), or purify, improve, and put it in repair."
Therefore the Sultan had accepted the submission of the
contemptible Germans, and left them in possession of their paltry
"fortress"!</p>

<p>Suleyman was blinding the eyes of the world with the blaze of
his wealth and glory, and striving to make himself believe that he
had actually accomplished all he had intended. He had not been
beaten on the field of open battle; he had set his puppet on the
Hungarian throne; he had devastated Austria; the markets of
Stamboul and Asia were full of Christian slaves. With this
knowledge he soothed his vanity, ignoring the fact that thirty
thousand of his subjects rotted before Vienna, and that his dreams
of European conquest had been shattered.</p>

<p>Behind the throne shone the spoils of war&mdash;silken and
velvet pavilions, wrested from the Persians, the Arabs, the
Egyptian memluks; costly tapestries, heavy with gold embroidery. At
his feet were heaped the gifts and tributes of subject and allied
princes. There were vests of Venetian velvet, golden goblets
crusted with jewels from the courts of the Grand Moghul,
ermine-lined kaftans from Erzeroum, carven jade from Cathay, silver
Persian helmets with horse-hair plumes, turban-cloths, cunningly
sewn with gems, from Egypt, curved Damascus blades of watered
steel, matchlocks from Kabul worked richly in chased silver,
breastplates and shields of Indian steel, rare furs from
Mongolia.</p>

<p>The throne was flanked on either hand by a long rank of youthful
slaves, made fast by golden collars to a single, long silver chain.
One file was composed of young Greek and Hungarian boys, the other
of girls; all clad only in plumed head-pieces and jeweled ornaments
intended to emphasize their nudity.</p>

<p>Eunuchs in flowing robes, their rotund bellies banded by
cloth-of-gold sashes, knelt and offered the royal guests sherbets
in gemmed goblets, cooled with snow from the mountains of Asia
Minor. The torches danced and flickered to the roars of the
multitudes. Around the courses swept the horses, foam flying from
their bits; wooden castles reeled and went up in flames as the
Janizaries clashed in mock warfare. Officers passed among the
shouting people, tossing showers of copper and silver coins amongst
them. None hungered or thirsted in Stamboul that night except the
miserable Caphar captives.</p>

<p>The minds of the foreign envoys were numbed by the bursting sea
of splendor, the thunder of imperial magnificence. About the vast
arena stalked trained elephants, almost covered with housings of
gold-worked leather, and from the jeweled towers on their backs,
fanfares of trumpets vied with the roar of the throngs and the
bellowing of lions. The tiers of the Hippodrome were a sea of
faces, all turning toward the jeweled figure on the shining throne,
while thousands of tongues wildly thundered his acclaim.</p>

<p>As he impressed the Venetian envoys, Suleyman knew he impressed
the world. In the blaze of his magnificence, men would forget that
a handful of desperate Caphars behind rotting walls had closed his
road to empire. Suleyman accepted a goblet of the forbidden wine,
and spoke aside to the Grand Vizier, who stepped forth and lifted
his arms.</p>

<p>"Oh, guests of my master, the Padishah forgets not the humblest
in the hour of rejoicing. To the officers who led his hosts against
the infidels, he has made rare gifts. Now he gives two hundred and
forty thousand ducats to be distributed among the common soldiers,
and likewise to each Janizary he gives a thousand aspers."</p>

<p>In the midst of the roar that went up, a eunuch knelt before the
Grand Vizier, holding up a large round package, carefully bound and
sealed. A folded piece of parchment, held shut by a red seal,
accompanied it. The attention of the Sultan was attracted.</p>

<p>"Oh, friend, what has thou there?"</p>

<p>Ibrahim salaamed. "The rider of the Adrianople post delivered
it, oh Lion of Islam. Apparently it is a gift of some sort from the
Austrian dogs. Infidel riders, I understand, gave it into the hands
of the border guard, with instructions to send it straightway to
Stamboul."</p>

<p>"Open it," directed Suleyman, his interest roused. The eunuch
salaamed to the floor, then began breaking the seals of the
package. A scholarly slave opened the accompanying note and read
the contents, written in a bold yet feminine hand:</p>

<p class="letter">To the Soldan Suleyman and his Wezir Ibrahim and
to the hussy Roxelana we who sign our names below send a gift in
token of our immeasurable fondness and kind affection.<br>
<br>
Sonya of Rogatino, and Gottfried von Kalmbach</p>

<p>Suleyman, who had started up at the name of his favorite, his
features suddenly darkening with wrath, gave a choking cry, which
was echoed by Ibrahim.</p>

<p>The eunuch had torn the seals of the bale, disclosing what lay
within. A pungent scent of herbs and preservative spices filled the
air, and the object, slipping from the horrified eunuch's hands,
tumbled among the heaps of presents at Suleyman's feet, offering a
ghastly contrast to the gems, gold and velvet bales. The Sultan
stared down at it and in that instant his shimmering pretense of
triumph slipped from him; his glory turned to tinsel and dust.
Ibrahim tore at his beard with a gurgling, strangling sound, purple
with rage.</p>

<p>At the Sultan's feet, the features frozen in a death-mask of
horror, lay the severed head of Mikhal Oglu, Vulture of the Grand
Turk.</p>
