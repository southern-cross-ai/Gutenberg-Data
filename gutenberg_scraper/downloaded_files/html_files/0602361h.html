<p class="intro">FOR their honeymoon Rollo Lenox Smeaton Aubrey,
Earl of Redgrave, and his bride, Lilla Zaidie, leave the earth
on a visit to the moon and the principal planets, their sole
companion being Andrew Murgatroyd, an old engineer who had
superintended the building of the Astronef in which the journey
is made. By means of the "R Force," or Anti-Gravitational Force,
of the secret of which Lord Redgrave is the sole possessor, they
are able to navigate with precision and safety the limitless
ocean of space. Their adventures on the moon were described in
the first story of the series.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>

<p class="first">THE Earth and the Moon were more than a hundred
million miles behind in the depths of Space, and the Astronef
had crossed this immense gap in eleven days and a few hours; but
this apparently inconceivable speed was not altogether due to
the powers of the Navigator of the Stars, for Lord Redgrave had
taken advantage of the passage of the planet along its orbit
towards that of the earth; therefore, while the Astronef was
approaching Mars with ever-increasing speed, Mars was travelling
towards the Astronef at the rate of sixteen miles a second. The
great silver disc of the earth had diminished until it looked
only a little larger than Venus appears from the earth. In fact
the planet Terra is to the inhabitants of Mars what Venus is to
us, the star of the morning and evening.</p>

<p>Breakfast on the morning of the twelfth day, or, since there
is neither day nor night in Space, it would be more correct to
say the twelfth period of twenty-four earth-hours as measured by
the chronometers, was just over, and the Commander of the
Astronef was standing with his bride in the forward end of the
glass-covered deck looking downwards at a vast crescent of rosy
light which stretched out over an arc of more than ninety
degrees. Two tiny black spots were travelling towards each other
across it. "Ah!" said her ladyship, going towards one of the
telescopes, "there are the moons. I was reading my Gulliver last
night. I wonder what the old Dean would have given to be here,
and see how true his guess was. Have you made up your mind to
land on them?"</p>

<p>"I don't see why we shouldn't," said her husband. "I think
they'd make rather convenient stopping-places; besides, we want
to know whether they have atmospheres and inhabitants."</p>

<p>"What, people living on those wee things?" she laughed, "why,
they're only about thirty or forty miles round, aren't
they?"</p>

<p>"That's about it," he said, "but that's just one of the
points I want to solve, and as for life, it doesn't always mean
people, you know. We are only a few hundred miles away from
Deimos, the outer one, and he is twelve thousand five hundred
miles from Mars. I vote we drop on him first and let him carry
us towards his brother Phobos. Then when we've examined him
we'll drop down to Phobos and take a trip round Mars on him. He
does the journey in about seven hours and a half, and as he's
only three thousand seven hundred miles above the surface we
ought to get a very good view of our next stopping-place."</p>

<p>"That ought to be quite a delightful trip!" said her
ladyship, "but how commonplace you are getting, Lenox. That's so
like you Englishmen. We are doing what has only been dreamt of
before, and here you are talking about moons and planets as if
they were railway stations."</p>

<p>"Well, if your ladyship prefers it, we will call them
undiscovered islands and continents in the the Ocean of Space.
That does sound a little bit better, doesn't it? Now I must go
down and see to my engines."</p>

<p>When he had gone, Zaidie sat down to the telescope again and
kept it on one of the little black spots travelling across the
crescent of Mars. Both it and the other spot rapidly grew
larger, and the features of the planet itself became more
distinct. She could make out the seas and continents and the
mysterious canals quite plainly through the clear rosy
atmosphere, and, with the aid of the telescope, she could even
make out the glimmer which the inner moon threw upon the
unlighted portion of the disc.</p>

<p>Deimos grew bigger and bigger, and in about half-an-hour the
Astronef grounded gently on what looked to her like a
dimly-lighted circular plain, but which, when her eyes became
accustomed to the light, was more like the summit of a conical
mountain. Redgrave raised the keel a little from the surface
again and propelled her towards a thin circle of light on the
tiny horizon. As they crossed into the sunlit portion it became
quite plain that Deimos at any rate was as airless and lifeless
as the moon. The surface was composed of brown rock and red sand
broken up into miniature hills and valleys. There were a few
traces of byegone volcanic action, but it was evident that the
internal fires of this tiny world must have burnt themselves out
very quickly.</p>

<p>"Not much to be seen here," said Redgrave, "and I don't think
it would be safe to go out. The attraction is so weak here that
we might find ourselves falling off with very little exertion.
You might take a couple of photographs of the surface, and then
we'll be off to Phobos."</p>

<p>A few minutes later Zaidic got a couple of good photographs
of the satellite. The attraction of Mars now began to make
itself strongly felt, and the Astronef dropped rapidly through
the eight thousand miles which separate the inner and outer
Moons of Mars. As they approached Phobos they saw that half the
little disc was brilliantly lighted by the same rays of the sun
which were glowing on the rapidly increasing crescent of Mars
beneath them. By careful manipulation of his engines Lord
Redgrave managed to meet the approaching satellite with a hardly
perceptible shock about the centre of its lighted portion, that
is to say the side turned towards the planet.</p>

<p>Mars now appeared as a gigantic rosy moon filling the whole
vault of the heavens above them. Their telescopes brought the
three thousand seven hundred and fifty miles down to about
fifty. The rapid motion of the tiny satellite afforded them a
spectacle which might be compared to the rising of a moon
glowing with rosy light and hundreds of times larger than the
earth. The speed of the vehicle of which they had taken
possession, something like four thousand two hundred miles an
hour, caused the surface of the planet to apparently sweep away
from below them from west to east, just as the earth appears to
slip away from under the car of a balloon.</p>

<p>Neither of them left the telescopes for more than a few
minutes during this aerial circumnavigation. Murgatroyd,
outwardly impassive, but inwardly filled with solemn fears for
the fate of this impiously daring voyage, brought them wine and
sandwiches and later on tea and toast and more sandwiches; but
they hardly touched even these, so absorbed were they in the
wonderful spectacle which was passing swiftly under their eyes.
Their telescopes were excellent ones, and at that distance Mars
gave up all his secrets.</p>

<p>Phobos revolves from west to east almost along the plane of
the planet's equator. To left and right they saw the huge ice-caps
of the South and North Poles gleaming through the red
atmosphere with a pale sunset glimmer. Then came the great
stretches of sea, often obscured by vast banks of clouds, which,
as the sunlight fell upon them, looked strangely like the
earth-clouds at sunset. Then, almost immediately underneath them
spread out the great land areas of the equatorial region. The
three continents of Halle, Gallileo, and Tycholand; then
Huygens&mdash;which is to Mars what Europe, Asia, and Africa are
to the earth. Then Herschell and Copernicus. Nearly all of these
land masses were split up into semi-regular divisions by the
famous canals which have so long puzzled terrestrial
observers.</p>

<p>"Well, there is one problem solved at any rate," said
Redgrave, when after a journey of nearly four hours they had
crossed the western hemisphere. "Mars is getting, very old, her
seas are diminishing, and her continents are increasing, and
those canals are the remains of gulfs and isthmuses which have
been widened and deepened and lengthened by human, or we'll say
Martian, Iabour, partly, I've no doubt, for purposes of
navigation, and partly to keep the inhabitants of the interior
of the continent within measurable distance of the sea. There's
not the slightest doubt about that. Then, you see, we've seen
scarcely any mountains to speak of so far, only ranges of low
hills."</p>

<p>"And that means, I suppose," said Zaidie, "that they've all
been worn down as the mountains of the earth are worn away. I
was reading Flammarion's 'End of the World' last night, and he,
you know, painted the earth at the end as an enormous plain of
land, no hills or mountains, no seas, and only sluggish rivers
draining into marshes. I suppose that's what they're coming to
down yonder. Now, I wonder what sort of civilisation we shall
find. Perhaps we shan't find any at all. Suppose all their
civilisations have worn out, and they are degenerating into the
same struggle for sheer existence those poor creatures in the
moon must have had."</p>

<p>"Or suppose," said his lordship seriously, we find that they
have passed the zenith of civilisation, and are dropping back
into savagery, but still have the use of weapons and means of
destruction which we, perhaps, have no notion of, and are
inclined to use them. We'd better be careful, dear.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Lenox?" she said. "They wouldn't try to do
us any harm, would they? Why should they?"</p>

<p>"I don't say they would," he replied, "but still you never
know. You see, their ideas of right and wrong and hospitality
and all that sort of thing might quite different to what we have
on the earth. In fact, they may not be men at all, but just a
sort of monster with a semi-human intellect, perhaps a
superhuman one with ideas that we have no notion of. Then
there's another thing: suppose they fancied a trip through
Space, and thought that they had quite as good a right to the
Astronef as we have? I dare say they've seen us if they've got
telescopes, as no doubt they have, perhaps a good deal more
powerful than ours, and they may be getting ready to receive us
now. I think I'll get the guns up before we go down, in case our
reception may not be a friendly one."</p>

<p>The defensive armament of the Astronef consisted of four
pneumatic guns, which could be mounted on swivels, two ahead and
two astern, and which carried a shell containing either one of
two kinds of explosives invented by her creator. One was a
solid, and burst on impact with an explosive force equal to
about twenty pounds of dynamite. The other consisted of two
liquids separated in the shell, and these, when mixed by the
breaking of the partition, nurse into a volume of flame which
could not be extinguished by any known human means. It would
burn even in a vacuum, since it supplied its own elements of
combustion. The guns would throw these shells to a distance of
about seven terrestrial miles. On the upper deck there were also
stands for a couple of light machine guns, capable of
discharging seven hundred bullets a minute.</p>

<p>The small arms consisted of a couple of heavy, ten-bore,
elephant guns carrying explosive bullets, a dozen rifles and
fowling pieces of different makes of which three, a single and a
double-barrelled rifle and a double-barrelled shot-gun, belonged
to her ladyship, as well as a dainty brace of revolvers, one of
half-a-dozen brace of various calibres which completed the minor
armament of the Astronef.</p>

<p>These guns were got up and mounted while the attraction of
the planet was comparatively feeble, and the guns themselves
were, therefore, of very little weight. On the surface of the
earth a score of men could not have done the work, but on board
the Astronef, suspended in space, his lordship and Murgatroyd
found the work easy, and Zaidie herself picked up a Maxim and
carried it about as though it were a toy sewing-machine.</p>

<br>

<p>"Now I think we can go down." said Redgrave, when everything
had been put in position as far as possible. "I wonder whether
we shall find the atmosphere of Mars suitable for terrestrial
lungs. It will be rather awkward if it isn't."</p>

<p>A very slight exertion of repulsive force was sufficient to
detach the Astronef from the body of Phobos. She dropped rapidly
towards the surface of the planet, and within three hours they
saw the sunlight for the first time since they had left the
Earth shining through an unmistakable atmosphere, an atmosphere
of a pale, rosy hue, instead of the azure of the earthly skies,
and an angular observation showed that they were within fifty
miles of the surface of the undiscovered world.</p>

<p>"Well, there's air here of some sort, there's no doubt. We'll
drop a bit further and then Andrew shall start the propellers.
They'll very soon give us an idea of the density. Do you notice
the change in the temperature? That's the diffused rays instead
of the direct ones. Twenty miles! think that will do. I'll stop
her now and we'll prospect for a landing-place."</p>

<p>He went down to apply the repulsive force directly to the
surface of Mars, so as to check the descent, and then he put on
his breathing-dress, went into the exit chamber, closed one door
behind him, opened the other and allowed it to fill with Martian
air; then he shut it again, opened his visor and took a cautious
breath.</p>

<p>It may, perhaps, have been the idea that he, the first of all
the sons of Earth, was breathing the air of another world, or it
might have been some peculiar property from the Martian
atmosphere, but he immediately experienced a sensation such as
usually follows drinking a glass of champagne. He took another
breath, and another. Then he opened the inner door and went on
to the lower deck, saying to himself:</p>

<p>"Well, the air's all right if it is a bit champagney, rich in
oxygen, I suppose, with perhaps a trace of nitrous-oxide in it.
Still, it's certainly breathable and that's the principal
thing.</p>

<p>"It's all right, dear." he said as he reached the upper deck
where Zaidie was walking about round the sides of the glass dome
gazing with all her eyes at the strange scene of mingled cloud
and sea, and land, which spread for an immense distance on all
sides of them. "I have breathed the air of Mars, and even at
this height it is distinctly wholesome, though of course it's
rather thin, and I had it mixed with some of our own atmosphere.
Still I think it will agree all right with us lower down."</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Zaidie, "suppose we get down below those
clouds and see what there really is to be seen."</p>

<p>"Your ladyship has but to speak and be obeyed," he replied,
and disappeared into the lower regions of the vessel.</p>

<p>In a couple of minutes she saw the cloud belt below them
rising rapidly. When her husband returned the Astronef plunged
into a sea of rosy mist.</p>

<p>"The clouds of Mars," she exclaimed, "fancy a world with pink
clouds! I wonder what there is on the other side." The next
moment they saw.</p>

<p>Just below them, at a distance of about five earth-miles, lay
an irregularly triangular island, a detached portion of the
Continent of Huygens almost equally divided by the Martian
equator, and lying with another almost similarly shaped island
between the fortieth and fiftieth meridians of west longitude.
The two islands were divided by a broad straight stretch of
water about the width of the English Channel between Folkestone
and Boulogne. Instead of the bright blue green of terrestrial
seas, this connecting link between the great Northern and
Southern Martian oceans had an orange tinge.</p>

<p>The land immediately beneath them was of a gently undulating
character, something like the Downs of South-Eastern England. No
mountains were visible in any direction. The lower portions,
particularly along the borders of the canals and the sea, were
thickly dotted with towns and cities, apparently of enormous
extent. To the north of the Island Continent there was a
Peninsula, covered with a vast collection of buildings, which,
with the broad streets and spacious squares which divided them,
must have covered an area of something like two hundred square
miles.</p>

<p>"There's the London of Mars!" said Redgrave, pointing down
towards it; "where the London of Earth will be in a few thousand
years, close to the equator. And you see all those other towns
and cities crowded round the canals! I dare say when we go
across the northern and southern temperate zones we shall find
them in about the state that Siberia or Patagonia are in."</p>

<p>"I dare say we shall," replied Zaidie, "Martian civilisation
is crowding towards the equator, though I should call that place
down there the greater New York of Mars, and see there's
Brooklyn just across the canal. I wonder what they're thinking
about us down there."</p>

<p>"Hullo, what's that!" exclaimed Redgrave, interrupting her
and pointing towards the great city whose roofs, apparently of
glass, were flashing with a thousand tints in the pale crimson
sunlight. "That's either an airship or another Astronef, and
it's evidently coming up to interview us. So they've solved the
problem, have they? Well, dear, I think it quite possible that
we're in for a pretty exciting time on Mars."</p>

<p>While he was speaking a little dark shape, at first not much
bigger than a bird, had risen from the glittering roofs of the
city. It rapidly increased in size until in a few minutes Zaidie
got a glimpse of it through one of the telescopes and said:</p>

<p>"It's a great big thing something like the Astronef, only it
has wings and, I think, masts; yes, there are three masts and
there's something glittering on the tops of them."</p>

<p>"Revolving helices, I suppose. He's screwing himself up into
the air. That shows that they must either have stronger and
lighter machinery here than we have, or, as the astronomers have
thought, this atmosphere is denser than ours and therefore
easier to fly in. Then, of course, things are only half their
earthly weight here. Well, I suppose we may as well let them
come and reconnoitre; then we shall see what kind of creatures
they are. Ah! there are a lot more of them, some coming from
Brooklyn, too, as you call it. Come up into the wheelhouse and
I'll relieve Murgatroyd so that he can go and look after his
engines. We shall have to give these gentlemen a lesson in
flying. Meanwhile, in case of accidents, we may as well make
ourselves as invulnerable as possible."</p>

<p>A few minutes later they were in the little steel conning-tower
forward, watching the approach of the Martian fleet
through the thick windows of toughened glass which enabled them
to look in every direction except straight down. The steel
coverings had been drawn down over the glass dome of the main
deck, and Murgatroyd had gone down to the engine-room, which was
connected with the conning-tower by telephone and electric
signal, as well as by speaking tubes. Fifty feet ahead of them
stretched out a long shining spur, the forward end of the
Astronef of which ten feet were solid steel, a ram which no
floating structure built by human hands could have resisted.</p>

<p>Redgrave was at the wheel, standing with his hands on the
steering-wheel, looking more serious than he had done so far
during the voyage. Zaidie stood beside him with a powerful
binocular telescope watching, with cheeks a little paler than
usual, the movements of the Martian air-ships. She counted
twenty-five vessels rising round them in a wide circle.</p>

<p>"I don't like the idea of a whole fleet coming up," said
Redgrave, as he watched them rising, and the ring narrowing
round the still motionless Astronef. "If they only wanted to
know who and what we are, or to leave their cards on us, as it
were, and bid us welcome to the world, one ship could have done
that just as well as fifty. This lot coming up looks as if they
wanted to get round and capture us."</p>

<p>"It does look like it!" said Zaidie, with her glasses fixed
on the nearest of the vessels; "and now I can see they've guns,
too, something like ours, and, perhaps, as you said just now,
they may have explosives that we don't know anything about. Oh,
dear, suppose they were able to smash us up with a single
shot!"</p>

<p>"You needn't be afraid of that, dear!" said Redgrave, laying
his hand on her shoulder; "but, of course, it's perfectly
natural that they should look upon us with a certain amount of
suspicion, dropping like this on them from the stars. Can you
see anything like men on board them yet?"</p>

<p>"No, they're all closed in," she replied, "just as we are;
but they've got conning-towers like this, and something like
windows along the sides; that's where the guns are, and the guns
are moving, they're pointing them at us. Lenox, I'm afraid
they're going to shoot."</p>

<p>"Then we may as well spoil their aim," he said, pressing an
electric button three times, and then once more after a little
interval. In obedience to the signal Murgatroyd turned on the
repulsive force to half power, and the Astronef leapt up
vertically a couple of thousand feet; then Redgrave pressed the
button once and stopped. Another signal set the propellers in
motion, and as she sprang forward across the circle formed by
the Martian air-ships, they looked down and saw that the place
which they had just left was occupied by a thick, greenish-yellow
cloud.</p>

<p>"Look, Lenox, what on earth is that?" exclaimed Zaidie,
pointing down to it.</p>

<p>"What on Mars would be nearer the point, dear," he said, with
what she thought a somewhat vicious laugh. "That I'm afraid
means anything but a friendly reception for us. That cloud is
one of two things. It's either made by the explosion of twenty
or thirty shells, or else it's made of gases intended to either
poison us or make us insensible, so that they can take
possession of the ship. In either case I should say that the
Martians are not what we should call gentlemen."</p>

<p>"I should think not," she said angrily. "They might at least
have taken us for friends till they had proved us enemies, which
they wouldn't have done. Nice sort of hospitality that,
considering how far we've come, and we can't shoot back because
we haven't got the ports open."</p>

<p>"And a very good thing too!" laughed Redgrave. "If we had had
them open, and that volley had caught us unawares, the Astronef
would probably have been full of poisonous gases by this time,
and your honeymoon, dear, would have come to a somewhat untimely
end. Ah, they're trying to follow us! Well, now we'll see how
high they can fly."</p>

<p>He sent another signal to Murgatroyd, and the Astronef, still
beating the Martian air with the fans of her propellers, and
travelling forward at about fifty miles an hour, rose in a
slanting direction through a dense bank of rosy-tinted clouds,
which hung over the bigger of the two cities&mdash;New York, as
Zaidie had named it. When they reached the golden red sunlight
above it, the Astronef stopped her ascent, and with half a turn
of the wheel her commander sent her sweeping round in a wide
circle. A few minutes later they saw the Martian fleet rise
almost simultaneously through the clouds. They seemed to
hesitate a moment, and then the prow of every vessel was
directed towards the swiftly moving Astronef.</p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen." said Redgrave, "you evidently don't know
anything about Professor Rennick and his R. Force; and yet you
ought to know that we couldn't have come through space without
being able to get beyond this little atmosphere of yours. Now
let us see how fast you can fly."</p>

<p>Another signal went down to Murgatroyd, and the whirling
propellers became two intersecting circles of light. The speed
of the Astronef increased to a hundred miles an hour, and the
Martian fleet began to drop behind and trail out into a triangle
like a flock of huge birds.</p>

<p>"That's lovely; we're leaving them!" exclaimed Zaidie leaning
forward with the glasses to her eyes and tapping the floor of
the conning&mdash;tower with her toe as if she wanted to dance,
"and their wings are working faster than ever. They don't seem
to have any screws."</p>

<p>"Probably because they've solved the problem of the bird's
flight," said Redgrave, "They're not gaining on us, are
they?"</p>

<p>"No, they're at about the same distance."</p>

<p>"Then we'll see how they can soar."</p>

<p>Another signal went over the wire, the Astronef's propellers
slowed down and stopped, and the vessel began to rise swiftly
towards the Zenith, which the Sun was now approaching. The
Martian fleet continued the impossible chase until the limits of
the navigable atmosphere. about eight earth-miles above the
surface, was reached. Here the air was evidently too rarefied
for their wings to act. They came to a standstill arranged in an
irregular circle, their occupants no doubt looking up with
envious eyes upon the shining body of the Astronef glittering
like a tiny star in the sunlight ten thousand feet above
them.</p>

<p>"Now, gentlemen," said Redgrave, "I think we have shown you
that we can fly faster and soar higher than you can. Perhaps
you'll be a bit more civil now. And, if you're not, well, we
shall have to teach you manners."</p>

<p>"But you're not going to fight them all dear, are you? Don't
let us be the first to bring war and bloodshed with us into
another world."</p>

<p>"Don't trouble about that, little woman, it's here already."
said her husband. "People don't have air-ships and guns, which
fire shells or whatever they were, without knowing what war is.
From what I've seen, I should say these Martians have civilised
themselves out of all the emotions, and, I daresay, have fought
pitilessly for the possession of the last habitable lands of the
planet. They've preyed upon each other till only the fittest are
left, and those, I suppose, were the ones who invented the
air-ships and finally got possession of all that existed. Of course
that would give them the command of the planet, land, and sea.
In fact, if we were able to make the personal acquaintance of
the Martians, we should probably find them a set of
over-civilised savages."</p>

<p>"That's a rather striking paradox, isn't it, dear?" said
Zaidie, slipping her hand through his arm: "but still it's not
at all bad. You mean, of course, that they've civilised
themselves out of all the emotions until they're just a set of
cold, calculating, scientific animals. After all they must be.
We should not have done anything like that on earth if we'd had
a visitor from Mars. We shouldn't have got out cannons, and shot
at him before we'd even made his acquaintance.</p>

<p>"Now, if he or they had dropped in America as we were going
down there, we should have received them with deputations, given
them banquets, which they might not have been able to eat, and
speeches, which they would not understand, photographed them,
filled the newspapers with everything that we could imagine
about them, put them in a palace car and hustled them round the
country for everybody to look at."</p>

<p>"And meanwhile," laughed Redgrave, "some of your smart
engineers, I suppose, would have gone over the vessel they had
come in, found out how she was worked, and taken out a dozen
patents for her machinery."</p>

<p>"Very likely," replied Zaidie, with a saucy little toss of
her chin; "and why not? We like to learn things down
there&mdash;and anyhow that would be better than shooting at
them."</p>

<p>While this little conversation was going on, the Asfronef was
dropping rapidly into the midst of the Martian fleet, which had
again arranged itself in a circle. Zaidie soon made out through
the glasses that the guns were pointed upwards.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's your little game, is it!" said Redgrave, when she
told him of this. "Well, if you want a fight, you can have
it."</p>

<p>As he said this, his jaws came together, and Zaidie saw a
look in his eyes that she had never seen there before. He
signalled rapid two or three times to Murgatroyd. The propellers
began to whirl at their utmost speed, and the Astronef, making a
spiral downward course, swooped down on to the Martian fleet
with terrific velocity. Her last curve coincided almost exactly
with the circle occupied by the fleet. Half-a-dozen spouts of
greenish flame came from the nearest vessel, and for a moment
the Astronef was enveloped in a yellow mist.</p>

<p>"Evidently they don't know that we are air-tight, and they
don't use shot or shell. They've got past that. Their
projectiles kill by poison or suffocation. I daresay a volley
like that would kill a regiment. Now give that fellow a lesson
which he won't live to remember."</p>

<p>They swept through the poison mist. Redgrave swung the wheel
round. The Astronef dropped to the level of the ring of Martian
vessels which had now got up speed again. Her steel ram was
directed straight at the vessel which had fired the last shot.
Propelled at a speed of more than a hundred miles an hour, it
took the strange-winged craft amidships. As the shock came,
Redgrave put his arm round Zaidie's waist and held her close to
him, otherwise she would have been flung against the forward
wall of the conning tower.</p>

<p>The Martian vessel stopped and bent up. They saw human
figures, more than half as large again as men, inside her,
staring at them through the windows in the sides. There were
others at the breaches of the guns in the act of turning the
muzzles on the Astronef; but this was only a momentary glimpse,
for in a second or two after the Astronef's spur had pierced
her, the Martian air-ship broke in twain, and her two halves
plunged downwards through the rosy clouds.</p><br>

</div>

<br>

<p>"Keep her at full speed, Andrew." said Redgrave down the
speaking-tube, "and stand by to jump if we want to."</p>

<p>"Ready, my lord!" came back up the tube.</p>

<p>The old Yorkshireman during the last few minutes had
undergone a transformation which he himself hardly understood.
He recognised that there was a fight going on, that it was a
case of "burn, sink and destroy," and the thousand-year-old
savage awoke in him just, as a matter of fact, it had done in
his lordship.</p>

<p>"Well, they can pick up the pieces down there," said
Redgrave, still holding Zaidie tight to his side with one hand
and working the wheel with the other. "Now we'll teach them
another lesson."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do, dear?" she said, looking up at him
with somewhat frightened eyes.</p>

<p>"You'll see in a moment," he said, between his shut teeth. "I
don't care whether these Martians are degenerate human beings or
only animals; but from my point of view the reception that they
have given us justifies any kind of retaliation. If we'd had a
single port hole open during the first volley you and I would
have been dead by this time, and I'm not going to stand anything
like that without reprisals. They've declared war on us, and
killing in war isn't murder."</p>

<p>"Well, no, I suppose not," she said; "but it's the first
fight I've been in, and I don't like it. Still, they did receive
us pretty meanly, didn't they?"</p>

<p>"Meanly? If there was anything like a code of interplanetary
morals, one might call it absolutely caddish."</p>

<p>He sent another message to Murgatroyd. The Astronef sprang a
thousand feet towards the zenith; another signal, and she
stopped exactly over the biggest of the Martian air-ships;
another, and she dropped on to it like a stone and smashed it to
fragments. Then she stopped and mounted again above the broken
circle of the fleet, while the pieces of the air-ship and what
was left of her crew plunged downwards through the crimson
clouds in a fall of nearly thirty thousand feet.</p>

<p>Within the next few moments the rest of the Martian fleet had
followed it, sinking rapidly down through the clouds and
scattering in all directions. "They seem to have had enough of
it," laughed Redgrave, as the Astronef, in obedience to another
signal, began to drop towards the surface of Mars. "Now we'll go
down and see if they're in a more reasonable frame of mind. At
any rate we've won our first scrimmage, dear."</p>

<p>"But it was rather brutal, Lenox, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"When you are dealing with brutes, Zaidie, it is sometimes
necessary to be brutal."</p>

<p>"And you look a wee bit brutal now," she replied, looking up
at him with something like a look of fear in her eyes. "I
suppose that is because you have just killed somebody&mdash;or
some things&mdash;whichever they are."</p>

<p>"Do I, really?"</p>

<p>The hard-set jaw relaxed and his lips melted into a smile
under his moustache, and he bent down and kissed her. And then
he said:</p>

<p>"Well, what do you suppose I should have thought of them if
you had had a whiff of that poison?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear," she said; "I see now."</p>

<p>When the Astronef dropped through the clouds, they saw that
the fleet had not only scattered, but was apparently getting as
far out of reach as possible. One vessel had dropped into the
principal square in the centre of the city which her ladyship
had called New York.</p>

<p>"That fellow has gone to report, evidently," said Redgrave.
"We'll follow him, but I don't think we'd better open the ports
even then. There's no telling when they might give us a whiff of
that poison-mist, or whatever it is."</p>

<p>"But how are you going to talk to them, then, if they can
talk?&mdash;I mean, if they know any language that we do?"</p>

<p>"They're something like men, and so I suppose they understand
the language of signs, at any rate. Still, if you don't fancy
it, we'll go somewhere else."</p>

<p>"No thanks," she said. "That's not my father's daughter. I
haven't come a hundred million miles from home to go away before
the first act's finished. We'll go down to see if we can make
them understand."</p>

<p>By this time the Astronef was hanging suspended over an
enormous square about half the size of Hyde Park. It was laid
out just as a terrestrial park would be in grassland, flower
beds, and avenues, and patches of trees, only the grass was a
reddish yellow, the leaves of the trees were like those of a
beech in autumn, and the flowers were nearly all a deep violet,
or a bright emerald green.</p>

<p>As they descended they saw that the square, or Central Park,
as her ladyship at once christened it, was flanked by enormous
blocks of buildings, palaces built of a dazzlingly white stone,
and topped by domed roofs, and lofty cupolas of glass.</p>

<p>"Isn't that just lovely!" she said, swinging her binoculars
in every direction. "Talk about Fifth Avenue and the houses in
Central Park; why, it's the Chicago Exposition, and the Paris
one, and your Crystal Palace, multiplied by about ten thousand,
and all spread out just round this one place. If we don't find
these people nice, I guess we'd better go back and build a fleet
like this, and come and take it."</p>

<p>"There spoke the new American imperialism," laughed Redgrave.
"Well, we'll go and see what they're like first, shall we?"</p>

<p>The Astronef dropped a little more slowly than the air-ship
had done, and remained suspended a hundred feet or so above her
after she had reached the ground. Swarms of human figures, but
of more than human statures clad in tunics and trousers or
knickerbockers, came out of the glass-domed palaces from all
sides into the park. They were nearly all of the same stature
and there appeared to be no difference whatever between the
sexes. Their dress was absolutely plain; there was no attempt at
ornament or decoration of any kind.</p>

<p>"If there are any of the Martian women among those people,"
said her ladyship, "they've taken to rationals and they've grown
about as big as the men. And look; there's someone who seems to
want to communicate with us. Why, they're all bald! They haven't
got a hair among them&mdash;and what a size their heads
are!"</p>

<p>"That's brains&mdash;too much brains, I expect! Those people
have lived too long. I expect they've ceased to be
animals&mdash;civilised themselves out of everything in the way
of passions and emotions, and are just purely intellectual
beings, with as much human nature about them as a limited
company has."</p>

<p>The orderly swarms of figures, which were rapidly filling the
park, divided as he was speaking, making a broad lane from one
of its entrances to where the Astronef was hanging above the
air-ship. A light four-wheeled vehicle, whose framework and
wheels glittered like burnished gold, sped towards them, driven
by some invisible agency. Its only occupant was a huge man,
dressed in the universal costume, saving only a scarlet sash in
place of the cord-girdle which the others wore round their
waists. The vehicle stopped near the air-ship, over which the
Astronef was hanging, and, as the figure dismounted, a door
opened in the side of the vessel and three other figures,
similar both in stature and attire, came out and entered into
conversation with him.</p>

<p>"The Admiral of the Fleet is evidently making his report,"
said Redgrave. "Meanwhile, the crowd seems to be taking a
considerable amount of interest in us."</p>

<p>"And very naturally, too!" replied Zaidie. "Don't you think
we might go down now and see if we can make ourselves understood
in any way? You can have the guns ready in case of accidents,
but I don't think they'll try and hurt us now. Look, the
gentleman with the red sash is making signs."</p>

<p>"I think we can go down now all right," replied Redgrave,
"because it's quite certain they can't use the poison guns on us
without killing themselves as well. Still, we may as well have
our own ready. Andrew, load up and get that port Maxim ready. I
hope we shan't want it, but we may. I don't quite like the look
of these people."</p>

<p>"They're very ugly, aren't they?" said Zaidie; "and really
you can't tell which are men and which are women. I suppose
they've civilised themselves out of everything that's nice, and
are just scientific and utilitarian and everything that's
horrid."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder. They look to me as if they've just got
common sense as we call it, and hadn't any other sense; but, at
any rate, if they don't behave themselves, we shall be able to
teach them manners of a sort, though I dare say we've done that
to some extent already."</p>

<p>As he said this Redgrave went into the conning-tower, and the
Astronef moved from above the air-ship, and dropped gently into
the crimson grass about a hundred feet from her. Then the ports
were opened, the guns, which Murgatroyd had loaded, were swung
into position, and they armed themselves with a brace of
revolvers each, in case of accident.</p>

<p>"What delicious air this is!" said her ladyship, as the ports
were opened, and she took her first breath of the Martian
atmosphere. "It's ever so much nicer than ours; it's just like
breathing champagne."</p>

<p>Redgrave looked at her with an admiration which was tempered
by a sudden apprehension. Even in his eyes she had never seemed
so lovely before. Her cheeks were glowing and her eyes were
gleaming with a brightness that was almost feverish, and he was
himself sensible of a strange feeling of exultation, both mental
and physical, as his lungs filled with the Martian air.</p>

<p>"Oxygen," he said shortly, "and too much of it! Or, I
shouldn't wonder if it was something like nitrous-oxide&mdash;you
know, laughing gas."</p>

<p>"Don't!" she laughed, "it may be very nice to breathe, but it
reminds one of other things which aren't a bit nice. Still, if
it is anything of that sort it might account for these people
having lived so fast. I know I feel just now as if I were living
at the rate of thirty-six hours a day and so, I suppose, the
fewer hours we stop here the better."</p>

<p>"Exactly!' said Redgrave, with another glance of apprehension
at her. Now, there's his Royal Highness, or whatever he is,
coming. How are we going to talk to him? Are you all ready,
Andrew?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord, all ready," replied the old Yorkshireman,
dropping his huge, hairy hand on the breach of the Maxim.</p>

<p>"Very well, then, shoot the moment you see them doing
anything suspicious, and don't let anyone except his Royal
Highness come nearer than a hundred yards."</p>

<p>As he said this, Redgrave, revolver in hand, went to the
door, from which the gangway steps had been lowered, and, in
reply to a singularly expressive gesture from the huge Martian,
who seemed to stand nearly nine feet high, he beckoned to him to
come up on to the deck.</p>

<br>

<br>

<p>As he mounted the steps the crowd closed round the Astronef
and the Martian air-ship; but, as though in obedience to orders
which had already been given, they kept at a respectful distance
of a little over a hundred yards away from the strange vessel,
which had wrought such havoc with their fleet. When the Martian
reached the deck Redgrave held out his hand and the giant
recoiled, as a man on earth might have done if, instead of the
open palm, he had seen a clenched hand gripping a knife.</p><br>

<br>

<div align="center">

<p class="caption">

</div>

<br>

<p>"Take care, Lenox," exclaimed Zaidie, taking a couple of
steps towards him, with her right hand on the butt of one of her
revolvers. The movement brought her close to the open door, and
in full view of the crowd outside.</p>

<p>If a seraph had come on earth and presented itself thus
before a throng of human beings, there might have happened some
such miracle as was wrought when the swarm of Martians beheld
the strange beauty of this radiant daughter of the earth. As it
seemed to them, when they discussed it afterwards, ages of
purely mechanical and utilitarian civilisation had brought all
conditions of Martian life up&mdash;or down&mdash;to the same
level. There was no apparent difference between the males and
females in stature; their faces were all the same, with features
of mathematical regularity, pale skin, bloodless cheeks, and all
expression, if such it could be called, utterly devoid of
emotion.</p>

<p>But still these creatures were human, or at least their
forefathers had been. Hearts beat in their breasts, blood flowed
through their veins, and so the magic of this marvellous vision
instantly awoke the long-slumbering elementary instincts of a
bye-gone age. A low murmur ran through the vast throng, a
murmur, half-human, half-brutish, which swiftly rose to a
hoarse, screaming roar.</p>

<p>"Look out, my lord! Quick! Shut the door, they're coming!
It's her ladyship they want; she must look like an angel from
Heaven to them. Shall I fire?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Redgrave, gripping the lever, and bringing the
door down. "Zaidie, if this fellow moves, put a bullet through
him. I'm going to talk to that air-ship before he gets his
poison guns to work."</p>

<p>As the last word left his lips, Murgatroyd put his thumb on
the spring on the Maxim. A roar such as Martian ears had never
heard before resounded through the vast square, and was flung
back with a thousand echoes from the walls of the huge palaces
on every side. A stream of smoke and flame poured out of the
little port-hole, and then the onward-swarming throng seemed to
stop, and the front ranks of it began to sink down silently in
long rows.</p>

<p>Then through the roaring rattle of the Maxim, sounded the
deep, sharp bang of Redgrave's gun, as he sent twenty pounds'
weight of an explosive, invented by Zaidie's father, which was
nearly four times as powerful as Lyddite, into the Martian
air-ship. Then came an explosion, which shook the air for miles
around. A blaze of greenish flame, and a huge cloud of steamy
smoke, showed that the projectile had done its work, and, when
the smoke drifted away, the spot on which the air-ship had lain
was only a deep, red, jagged gash in the ground. There was not
even a fragment of the ship to be seen.</p>

<p>Then Redgrave left the gun and turned the starboard Maxim on
to another swarm which was approaching the Astronef from that
side. When he had got the range, he swung the gun slowly from
side to side. The moving throng stopped, as the other one had
done, and sank down to the red grass, now dyed with a deeper
red.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Zaidie had been holding the Martian at something
more than arm's length with her revolver. He seemed to
understand perfectly that if she pulled the trigger, the
revolver would do something like what the Maxims had done. He
appeared to take no notice whatever either of the destruction of
the airship or of the slaughter that was going on around the
Astronef. His big pale blue eyes were fixed upon her face. They
seemed to be devouring a loveliness such as they had never seen
before. A dim, pinky flush stole for the first time into his
sallow cheeks, and something like a light of human passion came
into his eyes.</p>

<p>Then he spoke. The words were slowly uttered, passionless,
and very distinct. As words they were unintelligible but there
was no mistaking their meaning or that of the gestures which
accompanied them. He bent forward, towering over her with
outstretched arms, huge, hideous, and half human.</p>

<p>Zaidie took a step backwards and, just as Redgrave whipped
out one of his revolvers, she pulled the trigger of hers. The
bullet cut a clean hole through the smooth, hairless skull of
the Martian, and he dropped to the deck without a sound other
than what was made by his falling body.</p>

<br>

<div align="center">

<p class="caption"> Zaidie took a step backwards and pulled the
trigger.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>"That's the first man I've ever killed," she faltered, as her
hand fell to her side, and the revolver dropped from it. "Still,
do you think it really was a man?"</p>

<p>"That a man!" said Redgrave through his clenched teeth. "Not
much! Here, Andrew, open that door again and help me to heave
this thing overboard, and then we'd better be off or we shall be
having the rest of the fleet with their poison guns around us.
Hurry up! Zaidie, I think you'd better go below for the present,
little woman, and keep the door of your room tight shut. There's
no telling what these animals may do if they get a chance at
us."</p>

<p>Although she would rather have remained on deck to see what
was to happen, she saw that he was in earnest, and so she at
once obeyed.</p>

<p>The dead body of the Martian was tumbled out, Murgatroyd
closed all the air-tight doors of the upper deck chamber, while
Redgrave set the engines in motion and, with hardly a moment's
delay, the Astronef sprang up into the crimson sky from her
first and last battle-field in the well-named world of the War
God.</p>
