Concerning Opportunities</b>
</h2>

<p>"Peter King&mdash;Please&mdash;Peter King&mdash;Peter
King!"</p>

<p>With a telegram on his tray, the bell-boy traversed the crowded
hotel dining-room, chanting his monotonous refrain, until I managed
to make him realize that I owned the above name, and persuaded him
to hand over the message. It was short, and extremely
characteristic of the sender</p>

<p class="telegram">House party. Take afternoon train Saturday.
Stay Tuesday. I. G.<br>
PHILIP MAXWELL</p>

<p>I was more than willing to take the designated train, and looked
forward with satisfaction to a few days of pleasure. Philip had a
decided genius for arranging parties of congenial people, and,
moreover, the telegram assured me that at least one of my fellow
guests would prove attractive. For the letters "I. G."
meant nothing more nor less than that Irene Gardiner would be
there. Though I had met this young woman only twice, she already
exerted a fascination over me such as I had never before
experienced.</p>

<p>As I had hoped, she too went down to Hamilton on the afternoon
train, and the four hours' journey gave me an opportunity to
cultivate her acquaintance more informally than at our previous
meetings.</p>

<p>This pleased me, and yet when we were comfortably settled in our
chairs, and rushing swiftly through the monotonous and
uninteresting landscapes of central and southern New Jersey, I was
conscious of a certain disappointment regarding my fair companion.
In the daylight, and on a railroad train, she lost the subtle charm
which perhaps had been imparted by the glamour and artificial light
of a ballroom; and she looked older and less ingenuous than I had
thought her.</p>

<p>And yet she was a beautiful woman. Her clear dark eyes were
straightforward without being piercing; nor were they soulful or
languishing, but capable of a direct gaze that was both perceptive
and responsive. Her clear-cut mouth and chin betokened not only a
strong will, but a strong character and a capable nature. No, seen
by daylight there was no glamour about Irene Gardiner, but the very
lack of it, where I had expected to find it, interested me.</p>

<p>She was entirely at her ease as we pursued our journey, and with
a ready, graceful tact adapted herself to all the exigencies of the
situation.</p>

<p>Perhaps it would be more nearly true of Irene Gardiner to say
that she adapted situations to herself. Without seeming to dictate,
she anticipated my wishes, and made just such suggestions as I
wished to carry out.</p>

<p>Within an hour of our leaving New York, I found myself enjoying
a cigar in the smoker, and wondered how I had managed it.</p>

<p>When I realized that I had come there at her advice and even
insistence, I gave her immediate credit for tactful
cleverness&mdash;woman's most admirable trait.</p>

<p>Yet somehow I felt a certain chagrin. To be sure I did want a
smoke, but I didn't want to be made to smoke;&mdash;and to
obey the suggestion unconsciously at that!</p>

<p>There was no one in the smoker that I knew, and after I had
finished my cigar, I began to feel a strong inclination to return
to Miss Gardiner's society, and with a sudden intuition I
felt sure that this was just the result she had intended to bring
about, and that she had dismissed me in order that we might not
both become bored by a long and uninterrupted tete-a-tete.</p>

<p>This very thought determined me not to go back; but such is the
perversity of the human will, that the more I stayed away, the more
I felt inclined to go.</p>

<p>So half angry at myself I returned to my chair in the
parlor-car, and was greeted by a bright smile of welcome.</p>

<p>"I've been reading a detective story," she
said, as she turned down a leaf and closed the paper-covered book
she held. "I don't often affect that style of
literature, but the train-boy seemed of the opinion that this book
was the brightest gem of modern fiction, and that no
self-respecting citizen could afford to let it go
unread."</p>

<p>"Don't scorn detective fiction as a class," I
begged. "It's one of my favorite lines of light
reading. I have read that book, and though its literary style is
open to criticism, it advances a strong and tenable theory of
crime."</p>

<p>"I haven't finished the story," said Miss
Gardiner, "but I suppose you mean the idea that innocence is
only the absence of temptation."</p>

<p>"That is perhaps putting it a little too strongly, but I
certainly think that often opportunity creates a sinner."</p>

<p>"It is not a new idea," said Miss Gardiner
thoughtfully; "I believe Goethe said 'We are all
capable of crime&mdash;even the best of us.' And while he
would doubtless have admitted exceptions to his rule, he must have
thought it applicable to the great majority."</p>

<p>"It's impossible to tell," I observed,
"for though we often know when a man succumbs to temptation
we cannot know how often he resists it."</p>

<p>"But we can know about ourselves," exclaimed Miss
Gardiner with a sudden energy. "Honestly, now, if the motive
were sufficient and a perfect opportunity presented itself
unsought, could you imagine yourself committing a great
crime?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I have a vivid imagination," I replied gaily,
"and it isn't the least trouble to imagine myself
cracking a safe or kidnapping a king. But when it came to the
point, I doubt if I'd do it after all. I'd be afraid of
the consequences."</p>

<p>"Now you're flippant. But I'm very much in
earnest. I really believe if the motive were strong enough, I mean
if it were one of the elemental motives, like love, jealousy, or
revenge, I could kill a human being without hesitation. Of course
it would be in a moment of frenzy, and I would doubtless regret it
afterward, and even wonder at my own deed. But the point I'm
trying to make is only that, in proportion to the passions of which
we are capable, we possess an equivalent capability of executing
the natural consequences of those passions."</p>

<p>I looked at Miss Gardiner curiously. She certainly was in
earnest, yet she gave me the impression of a theorist rather than
one speaking from personal conviction.</p>

<p>And, too, it shocked me. She couldn't mean it, and yet the
positiveness of her speech and the earnestness of her look
indicated sincerity.</p>

<p>With her animated dark beauty she looked just then like Judith
and Jael and Zenobia all in one. It was not at all difficult, at
that moment, to imagine her giving way to an elemental emotion, but
the thought was far from pleasant and I put it quickly away from
me.</p>

<p>"Let us leave ourselves out of the question," I
said, "and merely admit that crimes have been committed by
persons innocent up to the moment when strong temptation and
opportunity were present at the same time."</p>

<p>"You will not be serious," she retorted, "so
we'll drop the subject. And now, unless you make yourself
very entertaining, I'll return to my storybook and leave you
to your own devices."</p>

<p>"That would be a crime, and you would commit it because
you see your opportunity," I replied, whereupon Miss Gardiner
laughed gaily, and abandoned her discussion of serious
theories.</p>

<p>I must have proved sufficiently entertaining, for she did not
reopen her novel, and we chatted pleasantly during the rest of the
journey.</p>

<p>"Is it a large and a gay party we're travelling
toward?" I asked, as we neared Hamilton.</p>

<p>"I don't really know," said Miss Gardiner;
"Miss Maxwell invited me, and the only other guests she
mentioned in her letter, beside yourself, were Mildred Leslie and
the Whitings."</p>

<p>"You mean Mildred's sister Edith, and her
husband?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you know Edith married Tom Whiting. He's a
most delightful man and the Leslies are dear girls."</p>

<p>"I remember Edith as a beauty, but I haven't seen
Mildred since she was a youngster."</p>

<p>"Prepare yourself for a surprise, then; she's grown
up to be the most fascinating little witch you ever saw."</p>

<p>"At any rate, Philip thinks so," I said, smiling,
and Miss Gardiner returned an understanding glance.</p>

<p>"Yes," she agreed, "Philip is perfectly daft
about her, but I don't think Miss Maxwell is altogether
pleased at that. She's awfully fond of Mildred, but I think
she would rather Philip should choose a different type for a
wife."</p>

<p>"But I doubt if Philip will ask his aunt's advice in
such a matter."</p>

<p>"Indeed he won't; nor his uncle's either.
Phil's a dear fellow, but those two old people have spoiled
him by humoring him too much; and now they can't be surprised
if he insists upon his own way."</p>

<p>"Do you approve the match?" I asked, rather
pointedly.</p>

<p>"No; I can't. Milly is a perfect darling, but she
would lead Philip a dance all his life. She's a born coquette
and she can't help flirting with everybody."</p>

<p>"She may try it with me, if she likes," I said,
nonchalantly, and Miss Gardiner responded, "Have no doubts of
that! She's bound to do so. I only wish you would involve
her, or let her involve you in so deep a flirtation that Philip
would lose his interest."</p>

<p>"My dear Miss Gardiner, don't you know that that
would be just the way to pique Philip's interest, and defeat
your own very admirable intent?"</p>

<p>"I suppose it would," said Irene, with a little
sigh, and then our train drew into the Hamilton station.</p>

<p>Philip met us at the train with his automobile.</p>

<p>"I say, but you're late!" he shouted.
"We've been waiting twenty minutes." He led the
way to his big touring car, as shinily spick-and-span as a steam
yacht, and bundled us into it. "You sit back, Peter,"
he directed, "with Mrs. Whiting and Miss Leslie, and
I'll take Miss Gardiner with me. We'll run around the
country a bit before we go home."</p>

<p>I hadn't seen Mildred Leslie for several years and I was
all unprepared for the change which had transformed the shy
schoolgirl into one of the most beautiful women I had ever
seen.</p>

<p>She was of the apple-blossom type, and her frivolous, dimpled
face was adorably pink and white, with big pansy-blue eyes, and a
saucy, curved mouth. A riotous fluff of golden hair escaped from
her automobile-veil, and the first glance proved the girl to be a
coquette to her finger-tips.</p>

<p>Her sister, Mrs. Whiting, was totally unlike her. She was a
solid, sensible little woman, whose sole occupation in life seemed
to be a protracted futile attempt to keep Mildred in order.</p>

<p>I took my seat between these two ladies, feeling that, for the
next few days at least, my lines had fallen in pleasant places.</p>

<p>"I do love a house party at the Maxwells',"
said Mildred, "because the party never stays in the house.
There are so many lovely, outdoorsy things to do that if it
weren't for meals we'd never see the inside of the
beautiful old mansion."</p>

<p>"It is a beautiful house," said Mrs. Whiting.
"I almost wish it would rain to-morrow so that we might stay
in and enjoy it"</p>

<p>"Oh, Edith, not to-morrow!" cried Mildred;
"we've too many things planned. Why, Mr. King,
there's a different picnic arranged for every hour in the
day, and you can pick out whichever ones you like best to go
to."</p>

<p>"I've such faith in your taste," I replied,
"that I'll just follow you, and go to the ones you
attend."</p>

<p>"I'm going to send regrets to several of the
picnics," announced Irene Gardiner, "and ramble around
the house. I've never seen it, but I've often heard of
its glories."</p>

<p>"We must stay indoors long enough to have some
music," said Mrs. Whiting; "I want to hear Irene sing
some of her old songs again."</p>

<p>"I cannot sing the old songs," Irene said, laughing;
"but I know a lot of new ones."</p>

<p>"I'll stay home from any picnic to hear
them,"</p>

<p>"I'll stay, too," said I, but though this
sounded as if a compliment to Miss Gardiner's music, a flash
of appreciation from Mildred's blue eyes proved to me that
she read my intent.</p>

<a name="ch02"></a><hr><h2><b>II<br>
"Maxwell Chimneys"</b>
</h2>

<p>"Oh, how stunning!" cried Irene Gardiner, for just
then we whizzed up the driveway to the Maxwell house, and though
perhaps not the word a purist would have chosen,
"stunning" did seem to express the effect. The white
pillars and porticoes of the mansion gleamed through the evergreen
trees that dotted the broad lawn; the sunset in progress was of the
spectacular variety, and a nearby lake reflected its gorgeous
colorings.</p>

<p>Alexander Maxwell had chosen to call his beautiful home
"Maxwell Chimneys," and the place was as picturesque
and unusual as its name. It had chimneys of the reddest of red
brick, and these stuck up all over the roof of the many-gabled
house, and also ran up the sides and down the back, and nestled in
corners, and even presented the novel spectacle of a fireplace
right out on the broad front veranda.</p>

<p>Though Philip had laughed at this addition to the heating
facilities of the mansion, it proved to be a great success, and on
cool summer evenings the open fire lit up the atmosphere gaily and,
incidentally, warmed a small portion of it.</p>

<p>The truth was, Miss Maxwell did not herself like outdoor life;
so, by filling her home with cosy fireplaces, she often enticed her
guests indoors, which thoroughly pleased her hospitable soul. For
the great house was always filled with guests, and one house-party
followed close on the heels of another all summer long.</p>

<p>"Maxwell Chimneys" occupied one of the most
desirable locations in Fairmountain Park, and the views from its
various windows and balconies were like a series of illuminated
post-cards. Or, at least, that was the remark made by seven out of
every ten of the guests who visited there.</p>

<p>As we neared the veranda, a cheery voice shouted
"Hello," and Tom Whiting ran down the steps to meet us.
The big, good-natured chap was a general favorite, and I cordially
returned his hearty greeting. Then the wide front door swung open,
and the old doorway made a fitting frame for the gentle lady of the
house who stood within it.</p>

<p>Miss Miranda Maxwell was Philip's aunt and, incidentally,
was his devoted slave.</p>

<p>She and her brother Alexander had lived in the old house for
many years, beloved and respected by the townspeople of Hamilton,
though deemed perhaps a shade too quiet and old-fogy for the rising
generation.</p>

<p>But this was all changed when their nephew Philip came to live
with them, and filled the house with young life and new interests.
He had been there about three years now, and though the village
gossips had concluded that he would never make the gentleman of the
old school that his uncle was, yet he had won his own place in
their regard, and his gay, sunny nature had gained many friends for
him.</p>

<p>Phil was a good-looking chap of about twenty-three and had been
an orphan since childhood.</p>

<p>After his school and college days, his uncle had invited him to
make his permanent home at "Maxwell Chimneys," and
Philip had accepted the invitation.</p>

<p>It was generally understood that he would eventually inherit the
place, together with Alexander Maxwell's large fortune, and
though not avaricious, Philip looked forward complacently to a life
of ease and luxury.</p>

<p>So far as social life went, he was practically master of Maxwell
Chimneys; he invited guests whenever he chose, and entertained them
elaborately.</p>

<p>Though Mr. Maxwell joined but seldom in the young people's
festivities, he paid the bills without a murmur, and smiled
indulgently at his merry-hearted nephew.</p>

<p>I had known Philip all through our college days, and I had made
long and frequent visits at Maxwell Chimneys, where the hours of
quiet enjoyment were often varied by delightful impromptu
entertainments, the product of Philip's ingenuity.</p>

<p>I was a favorite with both the old people, and I fully returned
their regard.</p>

<p>Mr. Maxwell was a collector in a modest way, and I was always
gratified when I could assist him in his quest or researches.</p>

<p>Miss Maxwell had such a kind, motherly heart that I think she
was a friend to everybody, but she, too, seemed specially to like
me, and so my visits to Hamilton were always pleasant
occasions.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Peter? I'm very glad to see
you," she said, so cordially, that the warm welcome of her
tone made the commonplace salutation a heart-felt one.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Miss Miranda?" I responded, with
equal cordiality. "I'm most happy to be here again. It
is a long time since I've enjoyed your hospitality. Ah! here
is Mr. Maxwell; how do you do, sir?"</p>

<p>I raised my voice to speak to my elderly host, for I remembered
his deafness. He shook hands, and greeted me warmly, expressing his
pleasure that I was with them once again.</p>

<p>I counted this brother and sister among my best friends, and
aside from their kindness and hospitality they represented the best
type of our American people. Educated, cultured and refined, they
imbued their home with an atmosphere of pleasantest good humor.</p>

<p>The house was luxurious, and their manner of living, though
rather elaborate, was not formal and not uncomfortably
conventional.</p>

<p>Miss Maxwell herself showed me to my room, and as she left me at
the door, she gave a motherly little pat to my shoulder, saying:
"Now, Peter, dear boy, Philip's man will look after
you, but if everything isn't just to your liking let me know,
won't you?"</p>

<p>"Sure he will, Aunt Miranda," broke in
Philip's gay voice, as he passed us in the hall; "look
alive, now, Peter, old boy, and tog yourself for dinner at once;
and drop down to the terrace as soon as you're
ready."</p>

<p>But after I was dressed, I stepped out onto the balcony through
my own window, lured by the beauty of the scene before me. The
distant hills were purple in the late twilight, and the crisp air
of early autumn was pleasant after the warmth of the house. I stood
at the balcony rail, and as I looked down I saw two people
strolling along the terrace just beneath me. In the dusk, I was
uncertain who they were, and then I heard Philip's clear,
deep voice:</p>

<p>"You're a rattle-brained, butterfly-minded and
extremely conceited young person," he declared, "but I
have the misfortune to love you as I love life itself; so, once
more, Mildred, darling, won't you marry me?" Mildred
laughed.</p>

<p>"Philip," she said, "I do believe that's
the thousandth time you've asked me that question. Please
don't do it again. My answer is&mdash;No."</p>

<p>"Milly," and Philip's voice took on a new
tone, "I shall ask you that question just once more. Not now;
and only once more. Remember, dear, only once. Come, let us go back
to the house."</p>

<p>I felt no compunction at my involuntary eavesdropping, for these
people were speaking in casual tones, and any one on the verandas
might have overheard them. And, too, what they said was no secret.
Miss Gardiner had told me that Philip wanted to marry Mildred, and
I felt sure that the laughing reply she had given him was merely
coquetry, and that he would again ask her the same question and get
another answer.</p>

<p>I went downstairs and met the pair just entering the house, and
then we went in to dinner.</p>

<p>Later on, as was the custom at Maxwell Chimneys, we all gathered
on the front veranda to watch the moon rise. Now, moonrise over
Fairmountain was of the nature of a solemn function, and by no
means to be lightly treated. The feminine members of the party,
therefore, had selected their places with a view to their own
picturesque effect in connection with the view and the men
naturally fell into position near the women they most admired.</p>

<p>This, of course, meant that Philip Maxwell should establish
himself in the near vicinity of Mildred Leslie. But the young man
had learned by experience that Mildred's nature was possessed
of a certain butterfly quality, that often caused her to hover
about from one place to another, before settling on a final choice.
And as he could not, with dignity, jump up and run about after her,
he wisely paused, and stood carelessly leaning against a pillar,
watching her as she fluttered about.</p>

<p>The young man had certainly shown no error in taste in admiring
Mildred. She was without doubt the prettiest girl present, and
prettier than any girl one would meet in many a long summer day.
Her piquant, merry little face was always smiling, and her deep
blue eyes seemed to be full of half-hidden sunshine. Her hair was
just on the darker side of golden, and owing to a bewitching
waviness seemed to look prettier every new way she arranged it.</p>

<p>Mildred was not quite twenty, and had not outgrown a certain
childish wilfulness that was inherent in her nature. But though
sometimes provokingly saucy, she was so winsomely attractive that
her friends declared her adorable, in spite of the fact that she
was a spoiled child.</p>

<p>Philip's devotion to her was an open secret, and though
there were others whose devotion was equally evident, the somewhat
strong-willed young man had determined to win her, and of late had
felt that he might consider his case hopeful.</p>

<p>In her dainty white evening gown, befrilled with fluffy laces,
Mildred was a picture as she flitted about, from one group to
another, the filmy blue scarf trailing around her, never in place,
but always picturesque.</p>

<p>"Dear Miss Maxwell," she said, pausing a moment by
her hostess' chair, "mayn't we have a picnic to
Heatherwood, some day, soon?"</p>

<p>"Oh, do let us," chimed in Irene Gardiner, "a
real old-fashioned picnic, with devilled eggs and lemon
pie."</p>

<p>"My dear girls," replied Miss Maxwell, "you
may have a picnic at Land's End if you choose, provided you
don't ask me to go to it." For though Miss Miranda
wanted young people about her, she didn't fancy running
around much.</p>

<p>"Dear old Dearie," said Mildred, patting her
shoulder, "she shall stay at home if she wants to, and toast
her toes at her own fire-side, so she shall. Edith, you'll
chaperon us, won't you?" she asked of the young matron
of the party.</p>

<p>"I'll be chaperon in name only," said Mrs.
Whiting, laughing; "but as to exercising any real authority
over you rollicking creatures, I shouldn't like to promise
it."</p>

<p>"Now, Mrs. Whiting," exclaimed Irene,
"that's too bad! Milly, we all know, is difficult, but
I'm as good as gold. At least, I have my good days;
they're Tuesdays and Sundays this summer, and as to-morrow is
Sunday you needn't worry at all about me."</p>

<p>"That's a lovely plan of yours," said Mildred,
"to have days on which to be good. I wish I had one. I think
one would be enough for me."</p>

<p>"You!" exclaimed Gilbert Crane, a neighbor who had
strolled over; "you'd have to choose Tib's Eve,
or the thirty-first of February."</p>

<p>"How delightfully rude you are," said Mildred, her
dimples deepening, as she slowly drawled out the words at him;
then, as if it were an afterthought&mdash;"I love rude
men."</p>

<p>"It's nice of you to put it that way," he
responded, "and as a reward I'll take you for a walk.
Come on, we'll go and hunt up that moon. I don't
believe it's ever going to rise over that mountain. Must have
slipped a cog, or something."</p>

<p>"Thank you so much," said Mildred settling herself
complacently in a rustic chair beside Miss Maxwell, "but
I'm not going out this evening."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you are!" declared Crane in a gaily
commanding tone. "Just gather up that undecided blue wrap
that seems to be detaching itself from your personality, and come
along with me."</p>

<p>"Observe me go," said Mildred calmly, as she sat
motionless in her big rattan easy chair.</p>

<p>Gilbert Crane laughed, and sat down beside her, and began to
chat in low tones, paying no attention to Philip's haughty
look. Presently their attention was arrested by what Miss Maxwell
was saying.</p>

<p>"Yes, he's coming to-morrow," declared that
lady, with a note of triumph in her voice. She had been reading a
telegram which a servant had just brought her, and as she folded it
away, Mildred asked:</p>

<p>"Who is coming to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Clarence, Earl of Clarendon," was the proud
reply.</p>

<p>"Goodness! What a name! He ought to have it dramatized.
But I suppose we can call him Clare or Clarry. Is he a real live
earl, and what's he coming for?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, he's real," said Miss Maxwell,
in reply to the first question. "I was so afraid he
wouldn't come, that I didn't tell you I had asked him.
But he is coming, and all you girls must make yourselves
particularly charming, and give him a good time. His people were
perfectly lovely to us in England, so we must reciprocate.
He'll be here in time for your picnic, Milly."</p>

<p>"He won't like me," said Mildred, pensively.
"I'm too Stars and Stripesy to please an English earl.
He'll succumb to Irene's statuesque charm and Vere de
Verean repose of manner."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course, Clarence will think Irene the gem of this
collection," agreed Edith Whiting; "but let's put
up a brave fight, Milly. If we can't charm the belted
gentleman, let's at least impress him with our free-born
Americanism. We can attract his attention in some way, unless
he's hunting an heiress."</p>

<p>"Why are earls always belted?" asked Mildred,
drowning Miss Maxwell's protest at Edith's last
words.</p>

<p>"They deserve to be belted for coming over here and
bothering our girls," said Philip.</p>

<p>"I sha'n't bother with him," declared
Mildred. "United States boys are good enough for me";
and she cast an approving glance at the good-looking young American
men standing about.</p>

<p>"That's all very well," said Gilbert Crane,
"and I hope you won't bother with his Earlship; but, I
say, Milly, if you cast those big blue soup-plates of eyes of yours
at him, I shouldn't like to answer for the consequences. You
know English girls stare, they don't dart fascinating glances
through a regular Niagara Falls of eyelashes; and I prophesy that
his Belted Highness won't know where he's at, when
you've smiled at him a few."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said Mildred; "he won't give
me a chance to look at him. Those English grandees are awfully
stuck up, and they only come to quiz us and write us up. What does
he look like, Miss Miranda? I suppose, as Lord Fauntleroy says, he
doesn't wear his coronet all the time."</p>

<p>"I won't tell you anything more about him,"
rejoined Miss Maxwell, decidedly. "It isn't fair for
you to know about him when he doesn't know anything about
you."</p>

<p>"I think," said Tom Whiting, "I shall draw up
a sort of descriptive catalogue of you girls, and nail it on the
inside of his door. It will save him lots of trouble. Something
like this, you know: Miss Irene Gardiner, raving beauty of the
Burne-Jones type; classic features, amiable disposition, great
tennis player and all-round athlete."</p>

<p>"There's no use going any further than Irene,"
interrupted Edith, with a disheartened sigh; "after that
description, Clarence won't read any more."</p>

<p>"Wait and see," said her husband, laughingly.
"Next, we have Mrs. Whiting; a perfect blonde, of the peaches
and cream variety. Sings like an angel and plays the mandolin to
beat the band."</p>

<p>"That ought to charm any old earl," declared Crane;
"now hit off Milly, though no mere words can do her
justice."</p>

<p>"Ah, there's the rub!" exclaimed Tom.
"If anyone can describe Mildred Leslie they're welcome
to do it. <i>I</i> can't."</p>

<p>"I'll try," said Crane, "and if my
descriptive powers give out, somebody else can take up the tale. To
begin with, I should say Miss Mildred Leslie is a mischievous,
roguish, saucy, adorable bit of humanity, who flirts with everybody
within hailing distance."</p>

<p>"I don't!" put in Milly, making a
<i>moue</i>.</p>

<p>"You do," asserted Philip. "Go on, Gilbert; a
willful, perverse, spoiled child, who always has her own
way."</p>

<p>"Because everybody is so good to her," interrupted
Milly again.</p>

<p>"Because everybody loves her," said Miss Maxwell,
looking affectionately at the young girl. At which Mildred kissed
that lady's hand, and suddenly jumped up and ran away.</p>

<p>Later, when their hostess declared it was growing chilly, and
they would go indoors and have some music, Philip came upon Milly
and myself in a vine-draped corner of the veranda.</p>

<p>"See here, Milly," he said, "you're not
to let that foreign popinjay tie himself to your
apron-strings."</p>

<p>"Oh, do you suppose that's what he is coming over
here for?" asked the girl, dropping her voice to an
awe-struck tone.</p>

<p>"If you weren't you, Milly, I should say you are a
goose!" and Philip's tone actually sounded vexed.</p>

<p>Mildred's manner became coldly dignified, but her eyes
gleamed as she said, "Why, that's what I wanted to say
to you."</p>

<p>At that Philip laughed genially. "Then let me beg you
again not to let the Britisher tie himself up with any of your
danglers."</p>

<p>"I certainly sha'n't ask him to," said
Mildred carelessly, "but if he sees fit to tie himself, I
can't help it. And you must admit, Phil, it would be a novel
experience to have a real earl at my beck and call! Oh, I'd
love to be proposed to by a nobleman! How do you suppose they do
it, Philip?"</p>

<p>"You ought to know all there is to know about how men
propose; you've been through it often enough."</p>

<p>"Yes, but it's almost always you, you
know."</p>

<p>"I only wish that were true."</p>

<p>"Well, it is&mdash;almost," Mildred sighed.
"But anyway, I like you better than most of the others;
you're a lot nicer than Gilbert Crane, for
instance."</p>

<p>"Well, I am glad you think so!" and Philip squared
his shoulders with an unconscious air of superiority.</p>

<p>"You needn't act so conceited over it!"
Mildred exclaimed. "Of course, you're big and
handsome&mdash;and he's insignificant looking; but he
can't help that, and you oughtn't to be
vain."</p>

<p>Philip tried to look modest and self-depreciatory, but only
succeeded in achieving a satisfied grin, whereat we all
laughed.</p>

<p>"But you know," Mildred went on, "it
isn't everything to be big and handsome and rich, as you are;
and if I promised to marry you, I might afterward see someone I
liked better."</p>

<p>"An earl, perhaps," said Philip, not noticing me,
but looking at her steadily.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mildred, returning his look with an
unflinching gaze, "an earl, perhaps."</p>

<p>"Well," said Philip, giving her a curious look,
"you might do worse."</p>

<p>"Indeed I might," she responded, a little curtly;
"very much worse."</p>

<p>And, laughing a little at their foolish banter, I left them and
went into the house.</p>

<a name="ch03"></a><hr><h2><b>III<br>
The Belted Earl</b>
</h2>

<p>Clarence, Earl of Clarendon, was arriving. Wherefore, the
feminine guests at Maxwell Chimneys were peeping with careful
discretion through curtains and window blinds, in their impatience
to comment upon the appearance of the distinguished visitor.</p>

<p>But from their vantage ground they could see only a big,
heavy-coated figure emerging from a motor-car, followed by a
quantity of foreign-looking luggage.</p>

<p>"He's gone to his rooms," announced Milly,
after a skirmishing peep into the hall, "and of course we
won't see him until dinner time. Come on, Irene, let's
go and put on our very bestest frocks. I wish I had a tiara or a
coronet! Do you think I'd better wear feathers in my hair or
just a wreath of roses?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know about earls," I
put in, "but I'm sure, Miss Leslie, that most men
prefer natural flowers to those fanciful confections that you young
ladies sometimes perch on your heads."</p>

<p>"You tell us, Mr. Maxwell," said Irene Gardiner, as
our host entered the room, "do you suppose earls prefer
made-up hair ornaments or natural flowers?"</p>

<p>"Bless my soul! I'm sure I don't know,"
declared the bewildered old gentleman; "I never was an
earl!"</p>

<p>"You ought to be," said Mildred, smiling at him;
"your manners are courtly enough to grace
any,&mdash;any&mdash;what do earls grace, anyway?"</p>

<p>"Well, as one will grace our dinner table pretty soon, it
would be wise for you girls to run away and get ready to do your
part of the gracing," said Miss Maxwell, smiling at pretty
Milly, who was in her most roguish mood.</p>

<p>"I simply can't dress, Miss Miranda, until I decide
between my silver filigree headdress and a wreath of pink
roses."</p>

<p>"Nor I," said Edith; "I believe I'll
wear a single rosebud."</p>

<p>"Yes, do," said Mildred; "do wear the simple
little blossom, dear; it will make you look younger!" As
Edith was only two years older than her sister this could not be
called an unkind sarcasm.</p>

<p>"Baby-face!" she retorted; "nothing could make
<i>you</i> look younger, unless, perhaps, you carry a Teddy Bear in
your arm."</p>

<p>"I've a notion to do just that!" said Mildred,
laughing. "I must shock that English prig,
somehow."</p>

<p>"How do you know he's a prig?"</p>

<p>"All Englishmen are. I've never met any, but
I'm sure they're snippy and critical, and not a bit
like our own brave lads. I've lost interest in him anyhow.
You may have him, Irene, if you want to."</p>

<p>"That's all very well, now, but as soon as you see
him, you'll appropriate him."</p>

<p>"No, I won't, honest; I hereby make over to you
whatever interest I may have had in the noble Earl of Clarendon,
and promise not to interfere with your game, if you choose to add
his very likely bald scalp to your other trophies of the
chase."</p>

<p>"Oh, pshaw, that won't do a scrap of good if you
even talk to him or look at him at all," said Irene, putting
on a rueful look. "Just as Mr. Crane said, if you sweep your
eyelashes round once, he'll be done for."</p>

<p>"All right," said Mildred; "then, furthermore,
I promise not to talk or converse with the abovementioned Clarence
beyond the ordinary civilities of the house; never to smile at him
voluntarily and never to wave my eyelashes at him across the table.
And now," she rattled on, "I know I'll be late
for dinner!" and then she ran away to her own room.
Presumably, she took great pains with her toilette, for it happened
that she was the latest to enter the drawing-room. She had elected
to wear a gown of palest blue organdy, which, though of simple
effect, was in reality a marvelous confection, born of art and
science. Her hair was massed in a curly top-knot, secured by
shining combs, and on her soft fair neck rested a string of wax
beads, which she chose to call "The Leslie Pearls."</p>

<p>Her cheeks were a little flushed with the exertion of her hasty
dressing, and fear of tardiness lent her an apologetic air, half
timid and half cajoling, as she crossed the room to her
hostess.</p>

<p>Miss Maxwell stood near the fireplace and smiled indulgently at
the pretty dismay of her young guest. Mildred smiled, too, and
then, raising her eyes, suddenly discovered that at Miss
Maxwell's side stood six feet two of man, with the broadest
shoulders she had ever seen!</p>

<p>"Oh," she almost gasped; "I thought&mdash;" and
then she seemed to realize that a formal introduction was being
made.</p>

<p>She dropped a slight and very dainty curtsey, and as she was
about to raise her eyes to the face which she naturally assumed
surmounted this column of humanity, she remembered she had promised
not to wave her eyelashes at him.</p>

<p>Convulsed with the ridiculousness of the situation, she
stammered a greeting which meant nothing, and resolutely turned her
face away.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Mildred; are you ill?"
said Miss Maxwell solicitously.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, indeed," said Mildred, raising her blue
eyes to meet the elder lady's glance, and just giving the
Earl a three-quarter view of her really wonderful lashes.
"No&mdash;I&mdash;I, that is, I was afraid I would be late
for dinner, you know."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, child; don't be foolish. Talk to Lord
Clarence for a few minutes, before we go to the
dining-room."</p>

<p>So Mildred dutifully talked, but, in a moment dinner was
announced, and it fell to her lot to be escorted to the dining-room
by my humble self.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" I asked after we were
seated at the dinner table. "Why did you turn down his Noble
Nibs so soon? You scarcely spoke to him."</p>

<p>"Too English for me," said Mildred briefly, not
wishing to discuss his lordship.</p>

<p>"He's a handsome chap," I went on. "And
he's a good, all-round fellow, too. I've been talking
with him, and he's broad-minded and fair, with a keen sense
of humor. Go in and win, Milly; I'll give you my
blessing."</p>

<p>"No, thank you," said Mildred, turning her eyes
resolutely away from the stranger. "Columbia is the
'Gem of the Ocean,' for me."</p>

<p>"Why don't you announce your engagement to Philip,
and have done with it?" I said audaciously.</p>

<p>"One reason is, that I'm not engaged to him,"
said Mildred calmly.</p>

<p>"But you will be. He has every chance in the
world."</p>

<p>"That's where you're wrong. There's only
one chance in the world that I shall marry Philip Maxwell."
She smiled as she remembered Philip's emphatic assurance that
he should ask her once more only. "But I'm not going to
marry anybody for <i>years</i> yet. Let's talk about
something more interesting. Look at Phil, now! He's devotedly
reciting poetry to Irene."</p>

<p>"Oho, that's your more interesting topic, is it?
But, wait, the noble Britisher is making good. Just listen to that
yarn he's telling. He's a ripping good
story-teller." And Mildred, listening, was forced to
agree.</p>

<p>On the terrace, after dinner, the party broke up into small
groups of two or three, and Mildred, quite unintentionally, found
herself talking to Lord Clarendon, or rather he was talking to
her.</p>

<p>"Don't run away," he said, as she tried to
edge off toward another group; "stay and talk to
me."</p>

<p>"I can't talk to you," she said, stammering a
little, "because&mdash;because&mdash;" and as he smiled at
her, she continued, in sheer desperation, "because&mdash;
because I don't know what to call you!"</p>

<p>"Don't you know my name?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but I don't know whether to address you as
'my lord' or 'your lordship.'"</p>

<p>She knew she was talking nonsense, but she was honestly trying
to get away, and so said anything at random.</p>

<p>The Earl stood looking down at her, with his half-mocking
smile.</p>

<p>"Either would succeed in attracting my attention, if I
heard you; but why not call me Clarence?"</p>

<p>"It's a stunning name," said Mildred,
"but I couldn't use it so soon. Indeed I never
can."</p>

<p>With a sudden determination she turned abruptly and walked away,
leaving him standing there.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" said his lordship to me as he looked
after her; "I can't make her out at all; but
she's a dear little enigma."</p>

<p>The evening wore away, and it was quite late when Mildred and I,
again together for a moment, saw someone coming near. Then a kind
voice over her shoulder said, "Is it possible that this
little lady's afraid of me?"</p>

<p>There was a laughing note in the voice, an amused, yet
self-assured tone that seemed joyously confident and contradictory
to the words.</p>

<p>I wondered what reply she would make, for the terrace in the
moonlight was a dangerous place. Acting on a sudden impulse,
whether courage or cowardice I didn't know, she whispered in
a broken voice, "yes, I <i>am</i> afraid of you," and
turned swiftly and suddenly away from him.</p>

<p>Philip was never very far away from Mildred's side, and
though he was glad to notice her apparent lack of interest in the
Earl, he was at a loss to understand her persistent rejection of
the nobleman's advances.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with the Belted One,
Milly?" he asked; "I'm sure I don't want
you to chum with him, but why treat him with such desperate
scor-r-r-m?"</p>

<p>"I don't scorn him, but he doesn't interest
me," said Mildred, a little impatiently, for she was
beginning to be tired of her own game.</p>

<p>But Philip was not entirely unversed in the whims and ways of
the Eternal Feminine, and he responded, "Oho! piqued, are
you?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I'm not, and, pray, why should I
be?"</p>

<p>"Oh, for many reasons. Perhaps because Clarence is so
devoted to Irene. She'd look well wearing a coronet,
wouldn't she? It would suit her tall stateliness a lot better
than it would your <i>petite</i> effects."</p>

<p>"Don't talk any more about that horrid Earl.
I'm tired of the thought of him."</p>

<p>"That's your attitude toward everything," said
I.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, it isn't," she responded saucily.
"I never get tired of myself, and I'm not yet tired of
you."</p>

<p>"Don't think of him, then," said Philip.
"I'm truly glad, if you don't like him. But your
overdoing it so made me a bit suspicious. You see, I know your
tricks and your manners!"</p>

<p>"Am I very bad, Philip?" said Mildred, a little
wistfully.</p>

<p>"You are indeed. You're a heartless little witch,
and you'd not only flirt with a wooden Indian, but
you'd know just the best way to go about it."</p>

<p>"Thank you for the subtle compliment. And yet&mdash;with
all my faults, you&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do, and always shall! Does it please you to
know it?"</p>

<p>"Not especially," said Mildred, her mocking eyes
smiling gaily into Philip's handsome, earnest face.
"And I sha'n't talk to you any more now, for you
seem to have only two subjects of conversation&mdash;yourself and
the Earl of Clarendon. And I don't care a straw for
either."</p>

<p>Philip only smiled, for though Mildred's words sounded
indifferent, the glance that reached him from beneath the long
lashes belied the words, and, I am sure, strengthened his
conviction that the butterfly heart was really his.</p>

<p>I left the pair then, and strolled away in the direction of
Irene Gardiner.</p>

<a name="ch04"></a><hr><h2><b>IV<br>
Saucy Mildred</b>
</h2>

<p>"I'm so glad we're going to have a dance
tonight," said Edith Whiting at luncheon next day.</p>

<p>"Oh, so am I," declared Mildred, "I'd
rather dance than eat; and we haven't had a real party dance
since we've been here."</p>

<p>"Give me four two-steps, won't you, Miss
Leslie?" said I.</p>

<p>"Why don't you ask for eight steps; can't you
multiply? Indeed I won't give you four two-steps, Mr.
King."</p>

<p>"Oh, I <i>so</i> hoped you <i>would!"</i> I
responded, in mock dejection.</p>

<p>"Why, how can you expect it?" she exclaimed.
"There'll be a lot of strange men here from all the
country round, and I'm going to give them all my dances. I
can dance any day with you men who are staying in the
house."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that, Miss Leslie?" exclaimed
Clarendon, in such apparent consternation that everybody
laughed.</p>

<p>"On second thoughts, I'll give you one apiece, all
round," said Mildred gaily.</p>

<p>Philip sat next her at the table.</p>

<p>"You'll give me more than that," he said in a
low tone, "or else you needn't give me any."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Mildred airily, "you
needn't have any. Lord Clarendon, if you care for two dances
to-night, I have an extra one that has just been returned with
thanks, which you may have."</p>

<p>"I accept it gladly, fair lady, but don't let it be
one of your American two-steps, for I have not yet mastered their
intricacies."</p>

<p>"They shall be any ones you choose," said Mildred,
with a glance at the Earl, that was deliberately intended to
delight him and to anger Philip, and succeeded perfectly in both
cases.</p>

<p>"Mildred," said Tom Whiting, under his breath, as
they left the table, "you are playing with fire."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I wish to get burnt," she retorted saucily,
and ran laughing away.</p>

<p>That afternoon Philip and I chanced to find ourselves alone for
a time. I was glad, for I hadn't had an opportunity to talk
much with him.</p>

<p>We sat in a shady corner of the veranda and he looked moody and
glum. Finally he threw his cigar away, and said, frankly,
"What would you do with her, Peter?"</p>

<p>"Do you want me to answer you seriously," I said,
"or flippantly?"</p>

<p>"Seriously, please."</p>

<p>"Then I think you'll have to teach her a lesson. You
let her go too far, Philip; and you may find, when you try to curb
her, you can't do it."</p>

<p>"I know I can't, King; she's reached that
point already."</p>

<p>"Then begin as soon as possible. Tell her that she must
either be engaged to you or not. And if she is engaged to you, she
must stop flirting with the Earl."</p>

<p>"Good Heavens, Peter! it isn't the Earl that bothers
me. It's someone quite different."</p>

<p>"Who?" I asked in astonishment, but just then we
were interrupted, and I had no answer to my question. But it
bothered me for a time; and I couldn't help wondering if by
any possibility Philip could be jealous of me! It seemed absurd,
for though of course I admired Milly Leslie, as everybody did, yet
I wouldn't for the world have intruded upon Philip's
rights. I could get no opportunity to speak to Philip again on the
matter until that evening after dinner. The ladies had all gone
away to dress for the dance, and Philip and I chose to stroll and
smoke in the rose garden. But again my intention came to nought,
for Earl Clarence joined us. Philip seemed in better spirits than
in the afternoon, and he chaffed the Earl gaily, in an unusually
merry mood.</p>

<p>It was after dark, but by the faint light of a moon which had
not yet risen, we saw what seemed almost like a fairy being coming
toward us. It was Mildred, and she was wrapped in a voluminous
cloak of pale blue, beneath which showed a pair of dainty white
dancing slippers.</p>

<p>"Oh," she exclaimed, drawing back as she recognized
us, "I thought you were the gardener!"</p>

<p>"To which one of us did you pay that compliment?"
inquired Philip, laughing.</p>

<p>"Oh, I won't be partial, I thought you were all
gardeners," said Mildred drawing her cloak around her and
seeming about to leave us,&mdash;though I felt sure she had no such
intention, and was coquetting as usual.</p>

<p>"Do you want a gardener?" said I; "won't
I do for one?"</p>

<p>"Well," and Mildred hesitated, "I was just
dressing for the dance you know, and I found I must
have,&mdash;simply <i>must</i> have some of those tiny yellow
roses, that grow over there. I would have sent the maid for them,
but I know she wouldn't select the very <i>tiniest</i> ones,
and those are the ones I must have. So I thought I'd just run
down and get them myself,&mdash;I never <i>dreamed</i> I'd
meet anybody!" Though the big blue eyes looked babyishly
innocent above the closely held blue wrap, I felt a secret
conviction that those same eyes had seen the group of men in the
rose garden, and did <i>not</i> mistake us for a group of
gardeners.</p>

<p>"I knew everybody was dressing for the dance," she
went on, "so I thought I couldn't <i>possibly</i> meet
anybody." She pouted a little, as if we were to blame for
interfering with her plan.</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter that you have met us,
dear," said Philip, gently; "I'll cut some roses
for you,&mdash;which ones do you want?"</p>

<p>Milly was a tease, there was no doubt about it. She smiled at
Philip, and then turning deliberately to the Earl, said,
"You're nearest to the yellow rose
tree,&mdash;won't you cut me some, please?"</p>

<p>Philip spoke no word, but stood for a moment looking at the girl
he loved. Then, in a tense, unnatural voice, he said,
"Clarendon, will you look after Miss Leslie?" and,
turning on his heel, walked rapidly away.</p>

<p>"Milly," said the Earl, eagerly stepping toward
her.</p>

<p>It was the first time he had ever addressed her so, but Mildred
had no intention of precipitating matters in this unconventional
situation, and, too, she was troubled at the remembrance of
Phil's disapproving glance.</p>

<p>"Lord Clarendon," she said coldly, "will you
be so very kind as to pick me a few yellow roses, and let me hasten
back to the house?"</p>

<p>"There is plenty of time," he said quietly;
"please give me a few moments."</p>

<p>"No," said Mildred, stamping her foot impatiently,
"I wish to return at once."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Clarendon gently, "I will
not detain you. Will you have this spray?"</p>

<p>He selected a charming cluster of roses, and taking his penknife
from his pocket cut them for her, and stood trimming off the
thorns.</p>

<p>"I wish I might have given you flowers to wear this
evening," he said.</p>

<p>His manner was gentle and deferential, and I was sure Mildred
felt perhaps she had been too brusque, as she said kindly, "I
wish so, too; but how could you have bought any flowers 'way
off here in the country?"</p>

<p>"I could have sent to town for them, or gone myself for
them."</p>

<p>"But I oughtn't to accept real hothouse flowers from
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why not? Because it would mean a special favor on your
part? But that is just what I want it to mean, dear little
girl&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord Clarendon, please don't! Please give me my
flowers and let me go."</p>

<p>"Will you consider them a gift from me, as I can't
get any others now? And will you let them mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh no, they don't mean anything&mdash;not anything
at all&mdash;yet."</p>

<p>He had taken her hands and placed the spray of roses between
them, and still held the two little hands, roses and all, close
clasped in his own. Her long cloak, released, fell away, and the
vision in the pale silken robe seemed to the noble Englishman quite
the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. He caught his breath, as
he looked at the baby face, with its troubled, beseeching eyes.</p>

<p>"Please let me go, Lord
Clarendon&mdash;<i>please!"</i> Then she gently disengaged
her hands from his, and gathering up the folds of her blue cloak,
prepared to run away.</p>

<p>But he detained her a moment. "Miss Leslie," he
said, and his choking voice betrayed his passion, "I
won't keep you now&mdash;but to-night you will give me an
opportunity, won't you, to tell you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To-night, my lord, you are to have one dance with me, you
know."</p>

<p>"One? You promised me two!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I never keep dance promises. I'm not at all
sure I shall give you one."</p>

<p>"But I'm sure you will, you tantalizing
baby!"</p>

<p>"Now which shall be the first one that I may call
mine?"</p>

<p>"Choose for yourself, my lord," said Mildred, in her
most demure way.</p>

<p>"Seven is a lucky number, may I have number
seven?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll save that for you," and, with a
laughing glance over her shoulder, she ran away.</p>

<p>"What a little witch she is, to be sure, eh?" and
Earl Clarence gave a short laugh.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon if I offend," I said, a little
stiffly; "but I think you,&mdash;that is we,&mdash;ought to
remember that she is pledged to Philip."</p>

<p>"Ah, I did not know it was announced."</p>

<p>"Nor is it, officially. But in this country, we accept
such a situation, without words,&mdash;if we are friendly with the
people concerned."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" was the cool response; "but the men
of my country have their own code of honor, and it is not to be
impugned."</p>

<p>This was a fine opening for a quarrel, but as I had no intention
of indulging in a dispute with our titled visitor, I said only,
"I have no criticism to make of the English code of
honor,&mdash;I'm sure!" and turning on my heel, I left
his lordship among the yellow roses.</p>

<p>Soon after, standing in the lower hall, I watched Mildred Leslie
come dancing down the stairs. She wore a short dancing gown of
palest yellow chiffon, and in her shining curls nestled the tiny
yellow roses. It was an unusual color for a pronounced blonde to
wear, but it suited her dainty beauty, and she looked like a spring
daffodil.</p>

<p>Of course she was immediately surrounded by would-be partners,
but Philip Maxwell was not among them.</p>

<p>"Sulky," said naughty Mildred, as I asked her where
he was. "Well, it will do him good to worry a
little."</p>

<p>As was usually the case, pretty Mildred was the belle of the
ball.</p>

<p>She halved most of her dances, and changed her mind so
frequently about her partners that she soon tore up her program,
declaring it bothered her, and she should accept invitations only
as each dance began.</p>

<p>She finished the sixth dance with me, and as we sauntered about
after the music ceased, we met Philip apparently looking for
her.</p>

<p>"The next dance is ours," he said looking at her in
an unsmiling way.</p>

<p>"Indeed it isn't!" declared Mildred, who had
by no means forgotten to whom she had promised the seventh
dance.</p>

<p>"It is," said Philip sternly,
"come!"</p>

<p>"Better go," I whispered in Mildred's ear;
"he's in an awful huff!"</p>

<p>Meekly she allowed herself to be led away, and Philip took her
out on the veranda.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, as they passed out of hearing,
"with whom are you going to dance this next dance, with me or
with that confounded foreigner?"</p>

<p>"With him, Philip," said Mildred, very quietly.
"I promised it to him before the party began."</p>

<p>I was thoroughly angry at the little coquette, and I turned away
and strolled idly through the rooms. I did not feel like dancing,
for the moment; and seeing Miss Maxwell, sitting alone in a corner
of the drawing-room, I went and sat by her for a few moments'
chat.</p>

<p>She seemed preoccupied, and after some perfunctory answers to my
trivial remarks, she said:</p>

<p>"Peter"&mdash;she always called me by my first name,
and somehow her soft, sweet voice gave the ugly word a pleasant
sound&mdash;"there is something wrong with Philip. I
can't imagine what it is, but for a week or more he has been
so different. It began all at once.</p>

<p>"One day last week he came to luncheon looking so harassed
and worried that my heart ached for him. I said nothing about
it&mdash;we are not confidential as a family, you know&mdash;I only
tried to be especially gentle and tender toward him. But he
didn't get over it. He spoke sharply to his uncle, he failed
to show his usual deferential courtesy to me, and he behaved
altogether like a man stunned and bewildered by some sudden
misfortune.</p>

<p>"I talked to his uncle about it when we were alone, and
he, too, had noticed it, but could not account for it in any way.
He though perhaps it might be money difficulties of some sort, and
he offered to increase Philip's allowance. But Philip refused
to accept an increase, and said he had no debts and plenty of
spending money. So we are at our wits' end to understand
it."</p>

<p>"Could it have anything to do with Miss Leslie?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"I think so," replied Miss Miranda, looking about to
make sure we were not overheard. "He is very much in love
with her, and I think she cares for him, but she is such a
coquettish little rogue that one cannot be sure of her. Besides,
this trouble of Philip's began before he planned this house
party, and before he thought of inviting Miss Leslie and her sister
down here."</p>

<p>"Does he talk frankly to you about Mildred?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, he hopes to win her&mdash;indeed, he says he
feels confident of succeeding. But I think he tries to persuade
himself that he will succeed, while really she is breaking his
heart over her flirtation with Gilbert Crane."</p>

<p>"Gilbert Crane!" I exclaimed, greatly surprised.
"Why, I thought she was flirting so desperately with the
Earl."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Mildred is just teasing Philip with him. When
she flirts so openly, there is no danger. But she conceals her
liking for Gilbert Crane. He's here to-night, and I'm
sure I don't know what will happen."</p>

<p>"But Gilbert Crane! why he's a friend of
Philip's."</p>

<p>"Yes, our fellow townsman, and one of Philip's best
friends."</p>

<p>"But he can't hold a candle to Philip."</p>

<p>"I know it. Philip is rich, or will be, and Philip is
handsome and talented, while Gilbert is none of these. But somehow
he has a queer sort of fascination over Mildred, and she is
certainly very gracious to him."</p>

<p>"Philip and Gilbert are as good friends as ever,
aren't they?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so. At least they were until lately. But
Mildred's evident preference for Gilbert's society has
wounded Philip, and though he treats Gilbert as kindly as ever,
I've seen him look at him as if he wondered how he could play
such an unfriendly part."</p>

<p>"You think, then, to put it plainly, that Gilbert is
trying to win Mildred away from Philip?"</p>

<p>"I do, and I think Philip is as much hurt by
Gilbert's treachery as by Mildred's fickleness. But I
cannot think that it is this affair that worried Philip so last
week. For then, Mildred hadn't come, and Gilbert was right
here all the time, and he and Philip were inseparable. No,
it's something else, and I can't imagine
what."</p>

<p>"Phil seems about as usual to me," I said.</p>

<p>"Yes, he is much brighter since you young people came.
More like his old self. But when he's alone, even now, he
drops into an attitude of absolute despair. I've seen him,
and it is something very dreadful that has come to my boy. Oh,
Peter, can't you find out what it is, and then I'm sure
we can help him."</p>

<p>I assured Miss Miranda that I would try in every possible way to
do all I could to help, but I felt convinced that no one could help
Philip at the present time, except Mildred Leslie herself.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Maxwell came in and joined us, and the tenor of our
conversation changed.</p>

<p>I should have been glad to talk with him about Philip, but owing
to his deafness I couldn't carry on such a conversation in
the drawing-room. But notwithstanding his affliction, Mr. Maxwell
had a fine ear for music, and greatly enjoyed it. A piano, violin
and harp furnished the music on this occasion, and as it was of
exceedingly good quality, Mr. Maxwell sat and listened, tapping his
foot gently in time with the rhythm. I saw him glance at Philip
several times, and, if the boy was smiling, the old
gentleman's anxiety seemed relieved, but if Phil was
over-quiet or sober-looking, Mr. Maxwell sighed and glanced away
again.</p>

<p>The drawing-room was the front room on the left, as one entered
the great hall that ran through the centre of the house. Back of it
was the billiard-room; back of that, Mr. Maxwell's study and
behind that a well-filled conservatory.</p>

<p>On the right of the wide hall, the front room was the
music-room; behind it was the dining-room, and back of that a short
cross hall and a butler's pantry,&mdash;the kitchen being
still farther back.</p>

<p>The large library was on the second floor, and was in many ways
the most attractive room in the house. There were bedrooms on both
the second and third floors, so that Maxwell Chimneys was well
adapted for generous hospitality.</p>

<p>A broad veranda ran all around three sides of the house both on
the ground floor and second story, and on it, from most of the
rooms, opened long French windows.</p>

<p>After watching the dancers for awhile Miss Miranda urged that I
join them, and though I would have quite willingly remained with
her, I did as she bade me.</p>

<p>"And, Miss Miranda," I said, as I left her,
"don't worry about Philip's affairs. I
hope&mdash;I'm sure you exaggerate to yourself his
despondency, and I can't help thinking that soon matters will
be brighter for him."</p>

<a name="ch05"></a><hr><h2><b>V<br>
The Tragedy</b>
</h2>

<p>I was fortunate in finding Miss Gardiner free to give me a
dance, and in a moment we were circling the polished floor.</p>

<p>She said little or nothing during the dance, and when it was
over I took her for a stroll on the upper balcony, where, standing
at the front railing we looked out on the beautiful country spread
before us in the moonlight.</p>

<p>Irene Gardiner puzzled while she attracted me. I never could
feel quite sure whether or not she was as frank as she seemed.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was only the natural effect of her dark, almost
Oriental beauty, but she somehow seemed capable of diplomacy or
intrigue.</p>

<p>To-night, however, she was simply charming, and whether assumed
or not, her attitude was sincere and confidential.</p>

<p>We traversed the three long sides of the house on the upper
balcony and then, turning, retraced our steps. Frequently we met or
passed other couples or groups of young people, and exchanged
merry, bantering words.</p>

<p>At last Irene paused at the southeast end of the balcony, and we
sat down on a wicker settee.</p>

<p>"Mr. King," she said, almost abruptly,
"don't you think it's a shame, the way Mildred
treats Mr. Maxwell?"</p>

<p>I was surprised at the question, but had no intention of
committing myself to this mystifying young woman.</p>

<p>"Who can criticize the ways of such an enchanting fairy as
Miss Leslie?" I replied lightly.</p>

<p>"Do you think her so fascinating?"</p>

<p>The question was wistful and very earnestly asked.</p>

<p>"She is both beautiful and charming, and she has
completely bewitched Philip," I said.</p>

<p>"Yet she does not really care for him," cried Irene,
passionately. "She adores Gilbert Crane, but she leads Philip
on, and is breaking his noble, splendid heart, merely for her own
amusement."</p>

<p>My eyes were opened.</p>

<p>"Oho, my lady," I thought to myself. "So you
are in love with the handsome Philip. Sits the wind in that
quarter?" But I only said, "Gilbert Crane! do you
really think so? Why I thought she was lavishing all her favors on
our titled guest."</p>

<p>"Oh, he's only an incident. Milly sees that it
teases Philip for her to flirt with the Earl, and she does so
openly. But her liking for Mr. Crane is another matter. You men are
so blind! can't you see that just because she doesn't
flirt openly with Gilbert Crane, it proves that she's really
interested in him?"</p>

<p>"She is only a child after all," I said, "and
we must forgive her a great deal."</p>

<p>"On account of her youth and beauty!" said Miss
Gardiner, in a tone that was positively bitter; "that's
always the way! A baby face and golden hair and big blue eyes will
excuse any amount of fickleness and treachery and
deceit!"</p>

<p>"Those are strong words, Miss Gardiner," I said,
amazed at her unkindness; "are you sure they are deserved by
our little friend?"</p>

<p>"Yes; <i>I</i> know Mildred Leslie as she is! You men only
know her as she chooses to appear to you!"</p>

<p>"I don't think I can agree with you, Miss Gardiner.
If Mildred Leslie were of a deeper nature, I might think you are
right. But she is as open as the day; a superficial, butterfly sort
of girl, who cares only for the pleasure of the passing moment. I
mean no disparagement, but I think that the lightheartedness of her
nature is her best defense against your charges. And truly, in her
heart I think she cares for Phil. Who could help preferring that
splendid fellow to young Crane?"</p>

<p>"I know it seems so," went on Irene, "but she
does like Mr. Crane better. She told me so herself, only to-day.
She said Philip is egotistical and purse-proud, and that Mr. Crane
has a true poet-soul."</p>

<p>"Perhaps she didn't mean her confidences for me,
Miss Gardiner," I said a little stiffly, for I was of no mind
to discuss these things.</p>

<p>"I don't care," cried Irene, her eyes blazing,
"I'm telling you because I want you to know how matters
really stand, and then I want you to warn Mr. Maxwell against such
a fickle, shallow little thing as Mildred is."</p>

<p>"I can't consent to do that," I answered.
"Philip is old enough to know what he is about. If Miss
Leslie prefers Gilbert Crane, Phil will certainly find it out for
himself, and soon. But I think he will convince her that she has
only a passing fancy for Crane, and that he himself is really her
destined fate."</p>

<p>I tried to speak gaily, for I did not wish to take the subject
seriously. But in a low, tense voice Irene exclaimed:</p>

<p>"It shall never be! Philip Maxwell shall not throw himself
away on a heartless little coquette who doesn't know how to
value him! Since you refuse to help me, I will take matters into my
own hands!"</p>

<p>I was amazed at her intensity of speech, but still trying to
treat it all lightly, I said:</p>

<p>"That is your privilege, fair lady. Come, let us return to
the dancing-room,&mdash;sha'n't we?"</p>

<p>"You go down, please, Mr. King," she said, and her
voice was quieter. "Leave me here for a little, and I will
rejoin you soon." As she seemed to be very much in earnest, I
did her bidding, and sauntering around, I entered the house by the
long French window into the front hall. As I passed through the
hall, I met Miss Miranda just going to her own room.</p>

<p>"Leaving us?" I inquired, smiling at her.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. "I am very weary to-night,
and I have excused myself. Mrs. Whiting will look after you young
folks, and I am sure she will ably represent me."</p>

<p>She looked not only tired, but worried, and I felt sure Miss
Leslie's behavior was grieving her dear old heart.</p>

<p>"Don't worry, dear lady," I said, earnestly;
"you know we must allow a certain latitude to frivolous,
butterfly-minded little girls."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know it," and she smiled, slightly;</p>

<p>"And I hope there is a true womanly heart under that
mischievous nature."</p>

<p>"I'm sure there is,&mdash;and I'm sure it is
devoted to our Philip. Don't take it too seriously; remember
that Philip is not a weak sort of a man, and he is able to control
his own affairs."</p>

<p>"But he is simply wax in Mildred's hands; she can do
anything she likes with him. She can send him into the seventh
heaven of joy or into the depths of despair by her smile or
frown."</p>

<p>"I know it; but that has been lovely woman's
privilege through all the world's history. We can't
expect our Phil to escape the common fate. So cheer up, and let us
hope that he will yet capture the pretty little rogue, and that
they will live happy ever after."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Peter; you have cheered me up, as you always
do; and I shall sleep better for your words of hope. Good
night."</p>

<p>"Good night," I said gently, "and I trust you
will rise to-morrow morning refreshed and happy."</p>

<p>"I hope so," she said. "Good night,
Peter." As I turned to go down-stairs, I heard voices in the
library, which I realized were those of Philip and Miss Leslie.
With no intention of eavesdropping, I couldn't help hearing
him say:</p>

<p>"Don't trifle with me to-night, Mildred; I am
desperate." The tone, more than the words, struck a chill to
my heart, and I hastened down-stairs lest I should hear more of a
conversation not meant for me.</p>

<p>There were groups of merry people in the music-room and in the
drawing-room, but somehow I didn't feel like joining them,
and I wandered back through the long hall, and looked in at the
open door of Mr. Maxwell's study.</p>

<p>This attractively furnished room could have been called a
"den" by a younger man, but my host was conservative in
his language, and adhered to old-fashioned customs.</p>

<p>I well knew it was his habit to devote an hour or two after
dinner to his evening paper, which, naturally, never reached
Maxwell Chimneys until late.</p>

<p>The household always refrained from intrusion on him at this
time, and so, when I saw him intently studying the market reports,
I turned away. But he had seen me, and laying down his paper, he
said cordially:</p>

<p>"Come in, my boy, come in and smoke a pipe with me, if you
are tired of your young and somewhat noisy
contemporaries."</p>

<p>"No," said I, going into the room, "not now,
Mr. Maxwell. You finish your paper, and later, I'll drop in
for a smoke. I'd very much like to have a talk with
you."</p>

<p>"About Philip?" he asked, looking at me with a
concerned air.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "but don't be
apprehensive. Indeed, I think we may have cause to congratulate the
boy before the evening is over. He and Miss Leslie are even now in
the library, and I hope that they will arrive at a happy
understanding."</p>

<p>"Good, Mr. King, good," said the old man in his
kindly, pleasant way. "Let us hope for the best, and I trust
it will all come out right."</p>

<p>"I'm sure it will," said I, and was about to
go on, when he detained me a moment longer.</p>

<p>"What about that decorated Britisher?" he asked,
looking at me intently.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm told he isn't in the running,"
I replied, lightly; for, as Mr. Maxwell was deaf, I didn't
care to discuss this matter in tones loud enough to be heard in
other rooms.</p>

<p>"I dare say,&mdash;I dare say," Mr. Maxwell replied,
but the blank look on his face made me think he hadn't heard
me clearly. However, I went on through the study, and, lifting the
portiere, passed into the billiard-room.</p>

<p>Here I found Gilbert Crane, alone, and sitting with his face
buried in his hands in an attitude of deepest dejection.</p>

<p>I suddenly realized that, as I was obliged to speak to Mr.
Maxwell in a loud, clear voice, Mr. Crane must necessarily have
heard what I said. He looked up as I entered, and his face showed
bitter despair.</p>

<p>He said nothing, however, and as I had nothing in particular to
say to him, I went on through the drawing-room, across the main
hall and into the music-room.</p>

<p>Pretty Edith Whiting was dancing with a Mr. Hunt, whom I knew,
and as I passed Tom Whiting, I praised his wife's grace.</p>

<p>His kindly, good-natured face lighted up. "She is a
beautiful dancer," he said, "try to get a turn with
her, King."</p>

<p>"I will," I responded, and went on. I soon found a
partner, and later, another, so that two or three dances passed
before I had a chance to ask Edith Whiting.</p>

<p>But I finally did so, and with a pretty gesture she laid her
hand on my arm and we whirled away. It chanced that we were just
opposite the door into the hall, when suddenly, Gilbert Crane
appeared in the doorway. His face was white with terror and wild
with fright, and he cried:</p>

<p>"Dr. Sheldon, Philip and Mildred have shot each other!
Come up to the library. Quick!"</p>

<p>Although Dr. Sheldon was quick in his response to Gilbert
Crane's summons, I was quicker, and, dashing up-stairs, I
reached the library door first, with Edith and Tom Whiting close
behind me.</p>

<p>Of course Gilbert's statement that they had shot each
other was manifestly improbable, and was doubtless the
irresponsible speech of frenzy.</p>

<p>My first glance at the tragedy showed me Philip stretched on the
floor, apparently dead, and Mildred fallen in a heap, a few feet
away.</p>

<p>I did not touch them, but I saw she had a pistol grasped in her
right hand.</p>

<p>In a moment Dr. Sheldon and several others came hastening in. I
had expected to see the whole crowd, but as I learned afterward,
Lord Clarence, with rare good judgment and presence of mind, had
insisted on most of the guests remaining downstairs until more
particulars of the accident were learned.</p>

<p>Dr. Sheldon gave a quick look at Philip, flung open his
clothing, placed his hand on his heart, and after a moment, said
gently:</p>

<p>"He is dead."</p>

<p>Then he turned to Mildred, and stooping, took her unconscious
form in his arms.</p>

<p>"She is not," he said eagerly. "Telephone for
my assistant, Dr. Burton, to come at once and bring my instruments.
I think we can yet save her life. Tell him to fly. Tell him what
has happened, but don't delay him."</p>

<p>Dr. Sheldon, who was acting as rapidly as he talked, took the
weapon from Mildred's hand and laid it on the table.</p>

<p>"Let no one touch that," he ordered, "and let
no one touch Philip Maxwell's body. Send for the coroner at
once.</p>

<p>"Mr. Crane, will you keep guard in this room? And, Mr.
King, will you dismiss the guests, and inform Mr. Maxwell and his
sister what has happened? Mr. and Mrs. Whiting will assist me with
Miss Leslie."</p>

<p>Tom Whiting and the doctor bore Mildred to her room, and I, not
at all liking the part assigned to me, went toward Miss
Maxwell's door. But I suddenly thought of Irene Gardiner, and
resolved to tell her first, thinking she could break the news to
the dear old lady with a better grace than I could.</p>

<p>I stepped out on the front balcony, wondering if I would find
her around the corner where I had left her, but to my surprise she
was seated near the front window, and was weeping violently.</p>

<p>"Irene," I said, as I touched her shoulder,
"Miss Gardiner, do you know what has happened?"</p>

<p>"What?" she said, still shaking with convulsive
sobs.</p>

<p>I told her, and her piercing shriek brought Miss Maxwell to her
door.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she cried, as she flung open the door.
"What is the matter?"</p>

<p>Suddenly Miss Gardiner grew calm, and with a return to her own
tactful manner, she took the old lady in her arms, and told her the
sad news.</p>

<p>Miss Maxwell's face turned white with grief and shock; she
tottered, but she did not faint. Then her loyal heart prompted her
to cry out:</p>

<p>"My brother! Does he know? Has he been told?"</p>

<p>"No," I said, "but I will tell him."</p>

<p>"Do," she said, "you know and love him."
Then, supported by Irene, she returned to her room.</p>

<p>I hurried down-stairs, and found Mr. Maxwell still alone and
undisturbed in his study. It was the hardest task I had ever had to
do in my life.</p>

<p>The old man laid down his paper, stretched his arms, and
said:</p>

<p>"Well, have you come for our smoke?"</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Maxwell," I said, "I am the bearer of
sad news. Philip has been hurt."</p>

<p>"Eh?" he said, not quite hearing my words.</p>

<p>"Philip has been hurt," I repeated,
"shot."</p>

<p>"Shot!" and the old man's face grew ashy pale,
as he leaned back in his chair.</p>

<p>I had heard hints of heart disease, and I was thoroughly
frightened. But just then Dr. Burton came in, and I begged him to
take a look at Mr. Maxwell, even before he went up-stairs to
Mildred Leslie.</p>

<p>Dr. Burton gave the old gentleman a stimulant of some sort, and
I resumed my awful errand.</p>

<p>He was very quiet, seemingly stunned by the news, and after a
few moments, his sister came into the room. I believe I never was
so glad to see any one in my life, and feeling now that they were
better alone, I left them.</p>

<a name="ch06"></a><hr><h2><b>VI<br>
"He Shot Me!"</b>
</h2>

<p>I went next to the music-room, where Lord Clarence was
dismissing the guests who, less than a half-hour before, had been
so hilarious.</p>

<p>The Earl acted like a splendid fellow, and his cool head and
capable management proved to be just what was needed for the sorry
situation.</p>

<p>In a short time nearly all the guests had gone. Gilbert Crane
remained, and Mr. Hunt, who was a sort of society detective, asked
to be allowed to stay. The coroner arrived just then, and learning
in a few words the facts of the case, he advised Hunt to stay, for
a time, at least.</p>

<p>Miss Lathrop, a trained nurse, who had been sent for by Dr.
Sheldon, also came, and she was taken at once to Mildred's
apartment.</p>

<p>"Mysterious case," said the coroner, after a long
look at the room and its contents. "Might be an attempt at
double suicide, or suicide and murder."</p>

<p>"Or double murder," said Mr. Hunt.</p>

<p>The coroner gave him a quick glance.</p>

<p>"We must work on evidence," he said, "not
imagination."</p>

<p>"What evidences do you see?" asked Gilbert
Crane.</p>

<p>"Very little, I confess," replied the coroner, who
was a frank, straightforward sort of a man, and whose name, as I
afterward learned, was Billings.</p>

<p>"But," he went on, "when a gentleman is found
dead, and a wounded lady near-by, with a pistol in her hand, it
doesn't require an unusual intellect to deduce that she
probably shot him. Unless, as I said, it is a double suicide, and
he shot himself first, and then she shot herself."</p>

<p>"Is Philip's wound one that could have been
self-inflicted?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Without a doubt," replied Mr. Billings. "He
is shot directly through the heart, and that could have been done
by himself or another."</p>

<p>"But of course we shall have medical evidence as to
that."</p>

<p>"How about the powder marks?" asked the quiet voice
of Mr. Hunt, who was already examining the room and taking
notes.</p>

<p>"It is difficult to judge," answered Mr. Billings.
"The shot went through both coat and waistcoat, and while the
powder marks would seem to prove that the shot was fired from a
distance of three or four feet, yet I cannot say so
positively."</p>

<p>I felt a certain relief at this, for while it was bad enough to
think of poor Philip shooting himself, somehow it was worse to
imagine Mildred shooting him.</p>

<p>Soon Dr. Burton came into the library. He talked with Mr. Hunt
and Mr. Billings, and then said:</p>

<p>"As soon as you have completed all necessary
investigations, Dr. Sheldon requests that the body shall be removed
to Mr. Philip Maxwell's room and laid upon the bed, in order
that it may seem less shocking to his aunt and uncle."</p>

<p>I liked this young doctor. He had Dr. Sheldon's clean-cut,
assured ways, but he spoke and moved with rather more grace and
gentleness.</p>

<p>Dr. Sheldon had been a guest at the dance, which was fortunate,
as it may have been the means of saving Mildred's life. But
Dr. Burton looked as if he were not at all inclined toward
gayeties. Serious, grave, he gave Dr. Sheldon's message, and
then turned away, knowing he could do nothing more.</p>

<p>The coroner agreed to his suggestions, and later, I saw Mr.
Maxwell and Miss Miranda go together to the room that had always
been Philip's.</p>

<p>As I look back upon that night now, it seems to me like a
horrible dream&mdash;so many people coming and going, the servants
beside themselves with grief and fright, and the dreadful facts
themselves so mysterious and so difficult to realize.</p>

<p>It seemed impossible that Philip could be dead&mdash;merry,
light-hearted Phil, who, except for the last week or so, had always
been so gay and joyous.</p>

<p>And Mildred Leslie's life hung in the balance.</p>

<p>Dr. Burton's news of her had been this: she had been shot
in the right shoulder, and the wound was dangerous but not
necessarily fatal.</p>

<p>Partially paralyzed by the shot, or perhaps only fainting from
fright, she had fallen to the floor, and struck her temple as she
fell, presumably against the corner of the table near which she
stood.</p>

<p>It was this blow which had made her unconscious, and which had
left its mark in a huge, swollen discoloration on her fair
brow.</p>

<p>She had as yet uttered no word, for she had been placed as soon
as possible under the influence of ether, while the doctors probed
for the bullet.</p>

<p>It had been successfully extracted, and was now in Dr.
Sheldon's possession.</p>

<p>Dr. Burton thought that Miss Leslie would soon regain
consciousness, but deemed it exceedingly unwise to question her, or
excite her in any way for some time to come. Indeed, he said he was
sure Dr. Sheldon would allow no one to see her for several days
except the nurse, and possibly her sister.</p>

<p>At last Mr. Maxwell and Miss Miranda were persuaded to retire,
and the rest of us were advised to do so.</p>

<p>But Gilbert Crane announced his intention of staying at the
house all night. He said some one should be in general charge, and
as Philip's best friend he considered he had the right to
assume such a position. He established himself in Mr.
Maxwell's study, and told the servants and the doctors to
call on him in any emergency.</p>

<p>Seeing that Mr. Hunt sat down there too, with the evident
intention of discussing the affair, I delayed my retiring and
joined them.</p>

<p>Lord Clarence looked in, and seemed to hesitate to intrude.</p>

<p>"Come in," I said; "as one of the house guests
you surely have a right."</p>

<p>He came in, and almost immediately after, Mrs. Whiting and Irene
came, and we went over and over the mysterious details.</p>

<p>"What were Mr. Philip Maxwell's sentiments toward
Miss Leslie?" inquired the detective.</p>

<p>No one seemed inclined to reply, and as I thought it my duty to
shed all the light possible on the case, I said:</p>

<p>"I have good reason to believe that, at or about the time
of his death, Mr. Maxwell was asking Miss Leslie to marry
him."</p>

<p>"Did she favor his suit?" pursued Mr. Hunt.</p>

<p>"No," broke in Irene, "she did not. She told
me so only this morning."</p>

<p>"But that would be no reason for her shooting him and then
shooting herself," wailed Edith Whiting. "Oh, I am sure
Mildred never did it. Or, at least, not intentionally.</p>

<p>"I've reasoned it all out, and I think he must have
been showing her his pistol, or explaining it to her, and it went
off accidentally, and then, in her grief and fright, she turned the
weapon on herself."</p>

<p>"Was it Philip's pistol?" asked Irene.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the detective, "that is, it had P.
M. engraved on the handle."</p>

<p>"Oh, it was Phil's pistol," said Gilbert
Crane. "I know it well. And he always keeps it in the top
drawer of that big table-desk they were standing by."</p>

<p>"How do you know they were standing by it?" This
question came from the Earl, who, though he had not spoken before,
had been intently listening, and who now spoke in a curt, sharp
voice, almost as if he were making an accusation.</p>

<p>"Because," said Gilbert quietly, "there were
no chairs near the desk. They both fell near the desk. Philip could
not have walked a step after that shot through his heart, and
Mildred must have been standing near the desk to fall and hit her
head on it. Am I clear?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly," said the Englishman, but his voice
sounded ironical.</p>

<p>"Mildred never shot Philip intentionally,"
reiterated Mrs. Whiting. "She is a rattle-pated girl&mdash;a
coquette, I admit&mdash;and she was not in love with Philip
Maxwell; but truly she was no more capable of a murderous thought
or instinct than I am. You know that, don't you,
Irene?"</p>

<p>Irene Gardiner gave me one quick glance, and like a flash I
remembered our conversation in the train about opportunity creating
a criminal.</p>

<p>Could it be that pretty Mildred, holding a pistol in her hand,
and alone with an unwelcome suitor could&mdash;no, I could no more
believe it than Edith, and I flashed a look of amazed disapproval
at Irene. But she was already speaking.</p>

<p>"I'm sure Mildred didn't shoot Philip at all,
Edith," she said. "I think he shot himself and she
tried to wrest the pistol from him, and in doing so wounded
herself."</p>

<p>This explanation struck us all as so plausible that we gladly
accepted it&mdash;all of us except Gilbert Crane&mdash;and wondered
we hadn't thought of it before.</p>

<p>Gilbert said slowly:</p>

<p>"There could have been no struggle after that shot entered
Philip's heart. If he shot himself, and Miss Leslie then took
the pistol from him, it was after he had ceased to
breathe."</p>

<p>"Was death, then, absolutely instantaneous?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Hunt, "both doctors are sure
of that."</p>

<p>Just here Tom Whiting came down-stairs and joined us in the
study. His face wore a peculiar expression. One of awe and
perplexity, yet tinged with a certain relief.</p>

<p>"I think you ought to know," he said, "that
Mildred is coming out of the ether's influence, and has
spoken several times, but only to repeat the same thing over and
over. She continually cries: 'He shot me. Oh, to think he
should shoot me!' I tell you this injustice to my
wife's sister."</p>

<p>"I knew Mildred didn't do it!" cried Edith,
almost fainting in her husband's arms. "I don't
care how black the evidence looked against her, I knew she never
did it."</p>

<p>The next morning it was a sad party that gathered around the
Maxwell breakfast table.</p>

<p>After we were seated, the nurse, Miss Lathrop, glided in and
took her place among us. It may have been prejudice, but I took an
instant dislike to the woman from the way she glided in. Many
trained nurses show a sense of their own importance, indeed, it
seems to be a part of their uniform. But aside from this, Miss
Lathrop gave an impression of knowing far more about the whole
affair than any of the rest of us.</p>

<p>It was by no means what she said that carried this impression,
but rather, what she didn't say. If one of us made an
observation or expressed an opinion, she turned suddenly to the
speaker, gave him a sharp look, and then dropped her eyes again,
but with a little superior smile hovering round her thin lips.</p>

<p>It exasperated me beyond endurance, though I had no real reason
to resent her attitude.</p>

<p>In response to the queries we put to her, her definite news of
Mildred was not encouraging.</p>

<p>"She will have brain fever," announced Miss Lathrop;
"Doctor Sheldon fears it, but I am sure of it. I have had
great experience with patients of her temperament, and I know it
cannot be averted." She shut her lips together, giving the
impression that since she so willed it, Mildred should have brain
fever in spite of anybody.</p>

<p>"Has she talked at all?" asked Miss Maxwell.
"She has said nothing," replied Miss Lathrop,
"except to repeat over and over again: 'Oh, to think
that <i>he</i> should shoot me!' in surprised and agonized
tones."</p>

<p>Probably from her enjoyment of a dramatic sensation, Miss
Lathrop's voice and expression were almost theatrical, and
though this jarred on all of us, it was especially harrowing for
Miss Maxwell and her brother, who of course were the ones most
deeply affected by Philip's death.</p>

<p>Poor old Mr. Maxwell was crushed, and unless some one spoke
directly to him, paid little heed to anything that was said.</p>

<p>Miss Miranda, on the other hand, tried to forget herself and her
troubles in caring for her guests. It was pathetic to see her
efforts to be cheerful and unselfish, and she seemed to me like a
lovely saint ministering to unworthy mortals. .</p>

<p>As Mr. Hunt had remained over night, he was at breakfast with
us. It seemed a strange coincidence that he should have been
present the night before, for surely he would be of help in
unravelling the mystery.</p>

<p>While not a professional detective, he had proved successful in
many difficult cases in which he had chosen to interest
himself.</p>

<p>"I can't help thinking," Mr. Hunt observed,
"that when Miss Leslie is rational again, what she tells us
may throw a new light on the matter."</p>

<p>"I quite agree with you, Mr. Hunt," said Miss
Lathrop, in her cold, concise way; "I have reason to think
that Miss Leslie will yet make further revelations. And I'm
sure we are very fortunate in having an able detective right here
in the house." Miss Lathrop flashed a glance at Hunt, which
obviously implied she knew more than she cared to tell, and then,
with her odious little smile, calmly proceeded to extract the seeds
from her grapes.</p>

<p>Mr. Maxwell looked up with a pained face. Miss Lathrop's
speech had seemed to rouse him almost to indignation.</p>

<p>"It is no case for a detective," he said, with a
severity of manner I had never noticed in him before. "If, as
Miss Leslie asserts, my poor boy shot her, that is all that is
necessary for us to know about the affair. As to motive, my nephew
has been seriously troubled of late, and doubtless his worry so
disturbed his mind that he was irresponsible for his act. At any
rate, I choose to consider him so."</p>

<p>"I'm sure we all agree to that," said Lord
Clarence, in his kind voice; "not one of us can believe for a
moment, that Philip Maxwell would commit such a deed, if he were
sane at the time."</p>

<p>Miss Lathrop gave the Earl the benefit of one of her mysterious
glances, and though she said no word, she clearly did not agree
with him.</p>

<p>To my secret gratification, his lordship caught her up.
"Have you definite reasons for not agreeing, Miss
Lathrop?" he said.</p>

<p>Miss Lathrop was taken by surprise. She colored slightly, and
then pursing her mouth, said primly; "Professional ethics
will not allow me to say."</p>

<p>"Professional ethics are out of place at this
moment," said Mr. Maxwell, sternly. "If you know
anything, Miss Lathrop, that will cast any light on this subject,
it is your duty to tell us at once."</p>

<p>"I know nothing," Miss Lathrop said, shortly, and I,
for one, believed she spoke truly.</p>

<a name="ch07"></a><hr><h2><b>VII<br>
A Search For Clues</b>
</h2>

<p>After breakfast when Mr. Hunt started to go home, I accompanied
him to the gate. Lord Clarence was also with us, and we both urged
him not to go.</p>

<p>"I think it better that I should," Hunt responded;
"Mr. Maxwell objects to seeing a detective about, and I
can't blame the poor old man."</p>

<p>"I suppose it is a natural feeling," said Lord
Clarence; "and, too, if Philip Maxwell did the shooting in a
moment of temporary insanity, then, as Mr. Maxwell says, there is
no occasion for detective work. But do you think that is the true
explanation of the matter?"</p>

<p>"It is a possibility," I said, "though
it's a new theory to me. But Philip was very much upset,
indeed, deeply troubled for some unknown cause; and I, for one, do
not think that cause was connected with Miss Leslie."</p>

<p>"Then why did he shoot her?" demanded Hunt.
"He didn't, intentionally. But if his mind was
unbalanced, who can hold him responsible for his deed?"</p>

<p>"That's true," said Hunt. "Well, I
suppose it will be all cleared up at the inquest. But since the
perpetrator of this murder is not alive, it will doubtless be a
mere matter of form."</p>

<p>"Where will it be held?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"Right here in the house, probably. To-day or to-morrow, I
should think; as the funeral will be on Thursday, and they
can't bury him without a permit."</p>

<p>I shuddered at the dreadfulness of it all. Hitherto I had
thought an ordinary death and burial sad enough, but how much worse
with these attendant circumstances.</p>

<p>"Queer, nobody heard the shots," went on Mr.
Hunt.</p>

<p>"Did nobody hear them?" I exclaimed. "I
hadn't thought of that at all."</p>

<p>"And, yet your questions and opinions in the matter seem
to imply a detective bent," said he, glancing at me a bit
quizzically.</p>

<p>"I do take a great interest in detective work," I
replied, "but I feel like Mr. Maxwell in this case. I see no
occasion to detect anything beyond what we already know. It seems
mysterious, I admit, but we know that one or both of the two
victims did the shooting, and truly, to me, it doesn't much
matter which."</p>

<p>"It does to me," said Gilbert Crane, who had joined
us as we stood by the gate, and had heard my last remark.</p>

<p>"Well," said Mr. Hunt, with what seemed to me like a
brutal cheerfulness, "if Miss Leslie gets well, we'll
know all about it; and if she doesn't, we'll never know
any more than we do now."</p>

<p>"If she fired either ball, she did it accidentally,"
declared Crane.</p>

<p>"Didn't you hear the shots either?" asked the
Earl, turning on him suddenly.</p>

<p>"No," said Gilbert, "and I can't find
any one who did hear them."</p>

<p>"But you were first on the scene?"</p>

<p>"Yes, so far as I know."</p>

<p>"How did you happen to go up to the library just
then?" asked Hunt.</p>

<p>"I didn't start for the library," said Gilbert
slowly. "I was feeling pretty blue and forlorn, and the gay
music jarred on me, so I thought I'd go home. I went
up-stairs for my banjo, which I had left on the upper front balcony
in the afternoon."</p>

<p>"Was there any one on the balcony?" said Hunt,
casually.</p>

<p>"I didn't see anybody," said Crane,
"though I think I heard voices around the corner. But I
didn't notice them; you know the house was full of
people."</p>

<p>"I can't understand," pursued the Earl,
thoughtfully, "why nobody heard the shots."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't think that's so strange,"
returned Crane. "Mr. Maxwell is quite deaf, and Miss Maxwell
is slightly so. And as for the young people, with the music and
dancing, they wouldn't be apt to hear them."</p>

<p>"And you came directly down-stairs after coming in from
the balcony?" went on Hunt.</p>

<p>"As I reached the top of the stairs, I couldn't help
looking toward the library, and as I heard no sounds, though I had
been told Philip and Mildred were in there, I glanced in, I suppose
from sheer curiosity."</p>

<p>"Who told you they were in there?"</p>

<p>"I did," said I, "or rather, I told Mr.
Maxwell, in Mr. Crane's hearing. I saw them there when I went
down-stairs. That was, I should think, about half an hour before
Mr. Crane gave the alarm."</p>

<p>"Can either of you fix the time of these
occurrences?" said Mr. Hunt He was very polite, even
deferential in his manner, and I saw no harm in accommodating
him.</p>

<p>"I can tell you only this," I said. "After I
passed the library, where I both heard and saw Philip and Miss
Leslie, I went on down-stairs and looked into Mr. Maxwell's
study.</p>

<p>"He asked me to sit down. I did not do so; but after a
word or two, I went on through to the billiard-room. I looked at
the clock in the study as I passed, and it was exactly ten. I
can't say, though, at just what time the general alarm was
given; I should think less than a half hour later."</p>

<p>"I can tell you," said Gilbert. "When I
concluded to go home, I looked between the portieres into Mr.
Maxwell's study, and it was twenty minutes past ten. Mr.
Maxwell was nodding over his paper; he is a little deaf, so he
probably didn't hear me.</p>

<p>"At any rate, he didn't look up. Then I went
immediately up-stairs, and it could not have been more than two
minutes before I called Dr. Sheldon."</p>

<p>"All this is of interest, and I thank you," said
Detective Hunt. "Though, as you say, since there is no
criminal to discover, there is small use of collecting
evidence."</p>

<p>"Queer chap, isn't he?" I said to Gilbert, as
the detective went away.</p>

<p>"Yes, but I think he's clever."</p>

<p>"I don't; if there were any occasion for detective
work on this case, I believe I could give him cards and spades, and
then beat him at his own game."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you could," said Gilbert, but he spoke
without interest. There was plenty for all to do that day. I had
expected to return to New York, but both Mr. Maxwell and Miss
Miranda begged me to stay with them till after the funeral. As
there was no reason for my immediate presence in the city, I was
glad to be of service to my good friends.</p>

<p>I assisted Mr. Maxwell to write letters to the various
relatives, and together we looked over poor Philip's
effects.</p>

<p>The boy had no business papers to speak of, for he had no money
except what was given him by his uncle, and apparently he kept no
account of its expenditures.</p>

<p>"I paid all his bills," said Mr. Maxwell, in
explanation of this, "and kept the receipts. I allowed Philip
such ready cash as he wanted, and, I may say, I never stinted him.
Whatever his recent trouble may have been, it could not have arisen
from lack of funds."</p>

<p>"Unless he had been speculating privately," I
suggested.</p>

<p>"I can't think so," replied his uncle.
"Philip wasn't that sort, and, too, had that been the
case, we would surely find papers of some sort to show
it."</p>

<p>This was true enough, and as Philip's papers consisted
entirely of such documents as scented notes addressed in feminine
hands, letters from college chums, circulars of outing goods and
cigars, and old dance-orders, I agreed that there was no indication
of financial trouble.</p>

<p>Mr. Maxwell was very careful and methodical in his search. In a
business-like way he went rapidly through the papers, replacing the
contents of each pigeon-hole or drawer after rapidly looking them
over. He showed no curiosity concerning the social notes or the
circulars, but seemed searching for some letter or document that
might throw light on Philip's recent despondency.</p>

<p>"It was about two weeks ago that Philip began to act
differently," mused Mr. Maxwell, as he scanned the dates on
various papers, "but I can find nothing here that would show
any reason for it. The poor boy must have had some secret trouble;
and doubtless, after all, it was either directly or indirectly
concerned with Mildred Leslie."</p>

<p>The old gentleman seemed almost relieved that no letters or
documents were found that showed a reason for Philip's
trouble. And I could understand this, for surely it was better that
a love affair should be the explanation, than some secret and
perhaps dishonorable reason.</p>

<p>The desk we had been searching was in Philip's
dressing-room, a small room off his bedroom. With the systematic
thoroughness that was characteristic of him, Mr. Maxwell opened the
drawers of the chiffonier, and examined the contents of a few small
cabinets and boxes that stood about. He even glanced over the
crumpled papers that were in the waste-basket, and then declared
himself satisfied that we could find no written evidence bearing
upon the secret of the boy's recent strange behavior.</p>

<p>Mr. Maxwell returned to his study, and I went for a stroll with
Irene Gardiner.</p>

<p>The girl looked so pale and wan, that I hoped a brisk walk would
do her good.</p>

<p>"Do you believe in the 'accidental'
theory?" she asked, as soon as we were started.</p>

<p>"No," I replied. "Philip was too well used to
fire-arms to shoot anybody accidentally, or allow any one to shoot
him. But I now fully believe in Mr. Maxwell's theory that the
boy's brain was temporarily affected, and that he shot
himself in a moment of insanity."</p>

<p>"But if he shot himself first, how did he then shoot
Mildred?"</p>

<p>"I've puzzled over that, I confess, and I think he
shot her first&mdash;as I said&mdash;not being responsible for his
actions. And then, overcome by grief at what he had done, he killed
himself in his sudden despair."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Irene. "I suppose that must have
been the way of it. But, granting all that, I don't see how
Mildred came to have the pistol in her hand."</p>

<p>"Nor I. It is all most mysterious. Let us hope that
Mildred will soon recover, and then we will know all."</p>

<p>"Mr. King, I suppose you will think very hardly of me, but
I have looked at this matter in all lights, and I want to ask you
if this isn't a possible case. Mightn't Philip have
shot Mildred, and, since she is not very severely wounded, might
she not have then snatched the pistol from him and shot at him in
return."</p>

<p>I looked at Miss Gardiner in amazement. I felt horrified that
she should imagine this, and yet there was a shadow of plausibility
in it.</p>

<p>"It seems almost impossible," I said slowly,
"that a wounded girl could have energy enough to secure a
pistol and shoot her assailant. And yet, I admit, I can think of no
other way to explain Miss Leslie's repeated expressions of
grieved amazement that Philip should have shot her."</p>

<p>"You don't think it possible, then, that Mildred may
not be as unconscious as she seems, and that she is making this
repeated statement for reasons of her own."</p>

<p>"Miss Gardiner!" I exclaimed, now thoroughly
aroused, "I am surprised at you. Even if you suspect Miss
Leslie of absolute crime, pray give the poor girl the benefit of
the doubt until she can defend herself, or&mdash;is beyond all need
of defense."</p>

<p>"You do me injustice," said Irene, raising her head
haughtily. "My logical mind necessitates the consideration of
every possible solution of this puzzle. I look upon Mildred
impersonally, merely as one of the actors in a tragic
drama."</p>

<p>"You have indeed a logical mind," I said coldly,
"if you can entirely eliminate the personal element from your
estimate of Miss Leslie."</p>

<p>"I see no reason why I should not. I judge her fairly, and
without prejudice. But I fail to see why the ravings of a mind
affected by the consequences of an anesthetic should be accepted as
unquestioned truth."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, the revelations made by a brain just
reviving from the unconsciousness produced by ether, are conceded
by all medical authorities invariably to be true statements. Many
secrets have been revealed in this way."</p>

<p>"That fact is new to me," said Irene thoughtfully,
"and it is very interesting. I am always willing to accept
authoritative facts, but I decline to accept unproved
theories."</p>

<p>"At any rate," I ventured, "you have no word
of blame for Philip." She turned flashing eyes toward me, and
in a moment I realized the situation. She was in the grip of two
strong emotions. Grief for the man she had loved, and jealousy of
her rival.</p>

<p>"Never speak of him to me!" she exclaimed. "I
claim that much consideration from you."</p>

<p>"And you shall certainly receive it," I said gently.
"But, on the other hand, let me beg of you not to do an
innocent girl an injustice, which your better nature will surely
regret later."</p>

<p>Irene looked at me. She had never seemed more beautiful, and her
wonderful eyes expressed contrition, gratitude, and a deep and
hopeless sadness.</p>

<p>She held out her hand.</p>

<p>"I thank you," she said, "you have saved me
from a grave mistake."</p>

<p>Still I didn't understand her, but I realized she was
beginning to fascinate me in her mysterious way, and I abruptly
turned our steps toward home. When we reached Maxwell Chimneys, we
found Dr. Sheldon, and the Whitings, with Mr. Maxwell and Miss
Miranda in the study. Evidently something had happened.</p>

<p>Each one looked excited; Mr. Maxwell was writing rapidly, and
Tom Whiting was hastily turning the leaves of the telephone
book.</p>

<p>"What is it?" I inquired. "Is Mildred--"</p>

<p>"No," said Dr. Sheldon, "Miss Leslie is no
worse. On the contrary, she is much better. Her mind is entirely
cleared, and she talks rationally, though I am not willing she
should be questioned much as yet. I am very glad you have come, for
there is a new and startling development in the case, and there is
much to be done."</p>

<p>"What is it?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Simply this. Miss Leslie, being perfectly rational, you
understand, says that neither she nor Philip fired any shots at
all. They were both shot by an intruder who came in at the library
window."</p>

<p>"But," I exclaimed, "then what did she mean by
saying 'He shot me!' in such a grieved tone?"</p>

<p>"She tells us," said Dr. Sheldon, "that those
were the last words uttered by Philip as he fell, and that they
rang in her brain to the exclusion of all else. That is why she
repeated them, parrot-like, during her unconsciousness."</p>

<p>"This changes the whole situation," said I, thinking
rapidly.</p>

<p>"It does," said Mr. Maxwell. "It is now a case
for a detective." Then he added, in a manly way, "I am
sorry I spoke so shortly to Mr. Hunt this morning, and I am ready
to tell him so, and to ask him to return and help us."</p>

<p>"But what&mdash;" I began.</p>

<p>"You know all that we do," interrupted the doctor.
"If Miss Leslie is questioned further, or in any way excited
at present, I will not answer for the consequences. My first duty
is to my patient.</p>

<p>"This afternoon, and in my presence, she may be
interviewed by some one who can do it gently and discreetly.
To-morrow, in all probability, she will be quite herself, and may
be questioned by a detective or any one empowered by Mr.
Maxwell." And with this, we were obliged to be content.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a name="ch08"></a><hr><h2><b>VIII<br>
The Inquest</b>
</h2>

<p>The situation was indeed changed. My latent detective instinct
was now fully roused, and I determined to do all I could toward
solving the mystery.</p>

<p>I said as much to Mr. Maxwell, and he thanked me for my sympathy
and interest.</p>

<p>He also asked whether I thought Mr. Hunt a skilled detective, or
whether I advised sending to New York for a more expert man. This
annoyed me, for it proved that he considered my services as
well-meant, but not especially valuable. However, I showed no
irritation, and answered simply that I thought Mr. Hunt quite
capable of discovering all that could be discovered.</p>

<p>"You see," I went on, "we are at a
disadvantage in having lost so many hours already. Had we known
last night there was an intruder from outside, we could perhaps
have caught him. As it is, he has probably made good his
escape."</p>

<p>"That is true," said Mr. Maxwell with a sigh.
"But we must do our best, and leave no stone unturned in our
endeavor to find Philip's assailant."</p>

<p>Miss Maxwell also agreed to this. "Peter," she said,
and her look at me was pathetic, "you will help us,
won't you? You loved Philip, I know; and you are clever and
intelligent. Can't you help Mr. Hunt, and between you find
the villain who murdered our boy?"</p>

<p>The usually timid and gentle lady was stirred, as I had never
seen her, by her righteous indignation. I was touched by her
confidence in me, and I assured her that such capability as I
possessed should be devoted toward the tracking of the
criminal.</p>

<p>I determined to go at once to the library, the scene of the
crime, and make a thorough search for clues before Mr. Hunt should
arrive. All the detective literature I had ever read, had taught me
that it is next to impossible for a human being to enter a room and
go out again, without leaving a trace of some sort, though visible
only to a trained detective.</p>

<p>So to the library I went, and subjected the room and all its
contents to a minute and systematic scrutiny. Contrary to all
precedent, literary and reportorial, I found nothing.</p>

<p>Again I went over the room, even more diligently, remembering
Sherlock Holmes' wise advice to discriminate carefully
between vital and incidental clues.</p>

<p>But, alas, I could find neither, except the very doubtful one of
a small and shiny black spangle, a tiny disk, which might have
fallen from the trimmings of some lady's gown.</p>

<p>I remembered no one who had worn such a decoration the night
before, but then, I take little note of ladies' dress.</p>

<p>In lieu of anything more interesting, I put the spangle
carefully away in my note-book, and proceeded with my examinations.
All to no purpose. The room had been put in order by the servants
that morning&mdash;dusted, and possibly swept&mdash;so it was
absurd to look for anything on the floor or furniture.</p>

<p>Sighing to think of the opportunities we had lost, I turned my
attention to the window by which the intruder must have entered. It
was a long French window reaching from floor to ceiling. It was in
three divisions, each of which was really a door, and opened out on
the balcony, which as I have said, ran around both sides and the
front of the house without barrier.</p>

<p>The panes were of ground glass, in a diamond pattern; and I knew
that at night, with lights inside the room, an outsider might look
in through the glass unseen by those within.</p>

<p>I opened the middle door, stepped out on the balcony, and
endeavored to scrutinize in a scientific way.</p>

<p>Signs of a scuffle there certainly were. Just outside the
library window, in the dust of the balcony, I observed many long,
sweeping marks, that had every appearance of being the tracks of
men who scraped their feet around in a wrestle, or struggle of some
sort. From the shape of these streaks in the dust, I could not
gather the size of the shoes that made them, nor the style of their
toes; but as even the paint of the balcony floor was scratched by
the marks, I felt sure that a tussle of some sort had taken place
there.</p>

<p>I looked for a continuation of these tracks, but found none,
save the scratches that were to be seen everywhere over the balcony
floor. As many people had walked there the night before, this was
of no importance, but unless some one had danced a clog dance
outside the library window, I saw no reason for changing my first
conclusion.</p>

<p>I found nothing else of note, save two more of those little
black spangles&mdash;one in the outside library blind, and another
farther front on the balcony. These I put away with my first one,
determined to find out who wore such trimmings the evening
before.</p>

<p>By this time Mr. Hunt had arrived. The coroner had come, too,
bringing his jury, for it had been decided to begin the inquest
that very afternoon.</p>

<p>How strange it seemed, to hold an inquest in Miss
Miranda's stately drawing-room! But that was not more strange
than realizing that Philip's dead body lay up-stairs, and
that we had not the faintest idea whose hand wrought this evil.</p>

<p>I paused in the library to talk to Mr. Hunt He was not
mysterious and uncommunicative like the regulation detective, but
was frankly at his wits' end.</p>

<p>When I saw this, and knew that I was similarly unenlightened, I
wondered if I had done wisely in advising Mr. Maxwell against
getting a man from the city.</p>

<p>"Very little to work on, eh, Hunt?" I said.</p>

<p>"Just about nothing at all," he said, moodily
staring at the carpet. "Look here, Mr. King, who is that
foreigner staying here?"</p>

<p>"The Earl of Clarendon? Oh, he's a noble Britisher,
all right. Don't try to stir up anything against
him!"</p>

<p>"I'm not; don't be absurd. But, have they
known him long?"</p>

<p>"When Mr. Alexander Maxwell and Miss Miranda traveled
abroad a few years ago, I believe he entertained them in London, or
at his country house. He's the real thing, Hunt, don't
get any notions about that."</p>

<p>"I can't get any notions anywhere; there's
nothing to work on."</p>

<p>"But the inquest may bring out some important
facts."</p>

<p>"I doubt it. If any one knew anything, he would have told
it at once. Why shouldn't he? We are all of one interest. The
deed was doubtless done by a burglar who was trying to effect an
entrance, and who was frightened away by his own shots."</p>

<p>"Well," I responded, "I'm willing to
suspend judgment until I have something more definite to base my
opinions on. Come, let us go down-stairs."</p>

<p>A crowd had assembled in the lower rooms, for the inquest was,
in a way, a public function.</p>

<p>I was sure the Maxwells were terribly annoyed at this invasion
of their beautiful home, but I was also sure that such thoughts
were swallowed up in their eagerness to discover and punish the
murderer of Philip.</p>

<p>Mr. Billings was calm and business-like.</p>

<p>He had impaneled his jury, and was already examining the first
witness.</p>

<p>Mr. Maxwell's own lawyer was present, also the district
attorney and several other gentlemen of legal aspect who were
strangers to me.</p>

<p>The first witness was Gilbert Crane.</p>

<p>To my surprise he appeared agitated and ill at ease. In one way,
this was not astonishing, for, as the first one to discover the
tragedy, his testimony would be of great importance. But he had
been so cool and self-possessed all day that I couldn't
understand his present demeanor.</p>

<p>"Will you tell us," said the coroner, not unkindly,
"the circumstances which led to your going to the library
last evening?"</p>

<p>"I was alone in the billiard-room," said Gilbert.
"I had been there alone for some time, as I was troubled and
did not care to join the merry crowd in the drawing-room. I heard
Mr. King come down-stairs, go into Mr. Maxwell's study and
talk to him for a few moments. After this I heard Mr. King tell Mr.
Maxwell that Philip Maxwell and Miss Leslie were in the
library.</p>

<p>"After this, Mr. King walked through the room I was in,
but we said nothing to each other, and he went on to the
drawing-room. I stayed exactly where I was for some time longer,
and then I concluded I would go home.</p>

<p>"Not wishing to make my adieux to the guests, I thought I
would merely say good night to Mr. Maxwell. I lifted the
porti&egrave;re and looked into his study, but as he was asleep, I
thought I wouldn't disturb him, but would just run up-stairs
for my banjo, and then slip away unnoticed.</p>

<p>"I went up-stairs and I admit it was curiosity concerning
the two people inside that led me to pause and look toward the
library door. I heard no sound of voices, so I took another step or
two in that direction, and, looking, saw Philip's figure
stretched on the floor.</p>

<p>"Then, of course, I went into the room. It has no door,
and the porti&egrave;res were but partly drawn. Seeing what was
evidently a serious accident of some sort, I immediately ran
down-stairs and called Dr. Sheldon to the scene."</p>

<p>"You saw no one else in the room?"</p>

<p>"N&mdash;no," said Gilbert, but he seemed to
hesitate.</p>

<p>"You are quite sure?" asked the coroner.</p>

<p>"I am positive I saw no one else in the room," said
Gilbert, decidedly this time.</p>

<p>"Can you fix the time of your going up-stairs?"</p>

<p>"I can. When I looked into Mr. Maxwell's study, I
noticed by his large clock that it was twenty minutes after ten. In
less than a minute after that I was up-stairs."</p>

<p>"That will do," said Mr. Billings, and Gilbert was
dismissed.</p>

<p>Dr. Sheldon was called next, and testified that he had responded
immediately to Mr. Crane's call, and on reaching the library
found Philip Maxwell's dead body on the floor, and Miss
Leslie, wounded and unconscious, a few feet away.</p>

<p>"She was shot?" asked the coroner.</p>

<p>"Yes, shot in the shoulder. She had fallen, and in so
doing had hit her temple. This rendered her unconscious. I
extracted the ball, and found it to be a thirty-eight caliber. The
revolver found in Miss Leslie's hand is also thirty-eight
caliber."</p>

<p>"And has the ball been extracted from Mr. Philip
Maxwell's body?"</p>

<p>"Yes; that is also a thirty-eight caliber. He was shot
through the heart, and must have died instantly."</p>

<p>"In your opinion, how long had he been dead, when you
examined the body?"</p>

<p>"Not long, as the body was still warm. Not more than half
an hour at the most."</p>

<p>"The pistol found in Miss Leslie's hand, and which
is now in my possession," said Mr. Billings, "has two
empty chambers. In view of Miss Leslie's statement that the
shooting was done by a person who came in by the window, it would
seem that the intruder might have placed the weapon in Miss
Leslie's hand after she was wounded. In your opinion, Dr.
Sheldon, would this be possible?"</p>

<p>"Possible, yes, but highly improbable, as I myself took
the pistol from her hand, and she was holding it in a tight grasp.
This would scarcely have been the case, had it been thrust into her
hand while she lay unconscious."</p>

<p>"We will not pursue this line of investigation further,
until we can hear Miss Leslie's story," said Mr.
Billings. "Dr. Sheldon, you are excused."</p>

<p>Mr. Maxwell's testimony was merely to the effect that he
had spent the evening in the drawing-room until about half past
nine, at which time he went to his study, and remained there,
reading and occasionally dozing, until he had been told the
dreadful news.</p>

<p>He corroborated my statement about my looking in on him at ten
o'clock, though he didn't notice the time, and he said
that he neither saw nor heard Gilbert Crane look in later.</p>

<p>Asked if he heard any shots, he said he did not, owing,
doubtless, to his deafness, and the fact that he was asleep part of
the time.</p>

<p>He was excused, and Mr. Billings then inquired if any one had
heard any shots.</p>

<p>We who were in the drawing-room during the half-hour between ten
and ten-thirty (when the murder was judged to have taken place)
declared we heard no shots; and this was but natural, as the
library was up-stairs and some distance away, and the music was, at
that time, of a noisy variety.</p>

<p>Gilbert Crane said he heard no shots, but said that he was so
deeply immersed in his own thoughts, that he doubted if he would
have heard a cannon fired.</p>

<p>Then Miss Maxwell's gentle voice was heard, saying:</p>

<p>"I heard two shots, and they were fired at exactly ten
o'clock."</p>

<p>"This is most important, madam," said the coroner.
"Will you kindly take the witness-chair?"</p>

<p>Then Miss Miranda testified that she was in her own room
preparing for bed. Her doors were closed, and the water was running
for her bath, so that she could not hear distinctly, but at ten
o'clock she heard two sounds that seemed to her like pistol
shots.</p>

<p>At the time, however, she hardly thought they were shots, but
she opened her hall door and looked out. Seeing nothing unusual,
and hearing the gay music down-stairs, she assumed it was the
slamming of doors or some other unimportant noise, and so thought
no more of it, until informed of what had happened.</p>

<p>"This, then," said Mr. Billings, "fixes the
firing of the two shots at ten o'clock. That coincides with
your diagnosis, Dr. Sheldon?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said the doctor. "I went up-stairs
at about half past ten, and found the body still warm."</p>

<p>"It is fortunate that we are able thus to fix the time so
accurately," said the coroner, "as it may be helpful in
discovering the criminal."</p>

<a name="ch09"></a><hr><h2><b>IX<br>
Further Testimony</b>
</h2>

<p>The next witness called was Irene Gardiner.</p>

<p>For some unaccountable reason, I trembled as I saw her take the
stand.</p>

<p>There was no knowing what sort of an impression this strange
girl might create, and there were certain bits of evidence which I
would feel sorry to have brought out in reference to her.</p>

<p>"Where were you between ten and ten-thirty last
evening?" asked Mr. Billings.</p>

<p>Although the tone was courteous, the question had somewhat the
sound of a challenge.</p>

<p>"On the upper balcony," replied Irene, her head held
high, and her red lips curled in a haughty expression.</p>

<p>"Which part of the balcony?" The coroner's
voice was a little more gentle.</p>

<p>"The south end of the east side."</p>

<p>That was where I had left her when I came down-stairs at ten
o'clock. The library opened on the southern end of the west
balcony.</p>

<p>"Were you there alone?"</p>

<p>"Mr. King was with me part of the time. Also there were
others in different parts of the balcony. After Mr. King left me I
was alone."</p>

<p>"Were not the others you mentioned there?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; I could see no one from where I
sat."</p>

<p>"How long did you remain there?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell the exact time. When I came into the house
again, I was met by Mr. King, who told me what had happened, and
asked me to break the news to Miss Maxwell."</p>

<p>"While sitting on the balcony alone did you see any
strangers, or any one, around the grounds, or on the
driveway?"</p>

<p>"None."</p>

<p>"Did you stay in the same place all the time you were on
the balcony, after Mr. King left you?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;that is, yes."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that answer?"</p>

<p>"I walked a few steps back and forth."</p>

<p>"Not around the corner into the north side?"</p>

<p>"N&mdash;no. Not so far as that."</p>

<p>As Irene made this statement, her face grew ashen pale, and I
thought I saw her glance in the direction of Gilbert Crane.</p>

<p>But I was not sure of this, and I was most anxious to make all
allowance for the girl, who was certainly pitiably nervous and
disturbed.</p>

<p>"You are quite sure, Miss Gardiner, that you did not walk
round on the north or west sides of the balcony until the time you
came into the house?"</p>

<p>"Quite certain," said Irene, but her voice was so
low as scarcely to be heard, and her eyes were cast down.</p>

<p>I didn't know what to make of her strange manner, and just
then I chanced to look at Gilbert Crane. To my surprise, he was
equally pale and agitated in appearance. No one else seemed to
notice this, so I kept my own counsel concerning it.</p>

<p>Miss Gardiner was dismissed, and the Earl of Clarendon was next
called.</p>

<p>Mr. Billings inquired rather definitely as to the title and
pedigree of the English nobleman, and, seemingly satisfied with the
replies, he asked the witness to tell what he could of the
tragedy.</p>

<p>"I can tell very little," the Earl responded.
"I was dancing with a young lady in the drawing-room, when I
heard Mr. Crane announce from the doorway that somebody had been
shot. I realized at once that unless restrained, the guests would
all rush to the scene. I took the young lady who was with me to a
sofa, and then I spoke to all the people at once, advising them to
remain in the drawing-room. I may have taken upon myself undue
authority, but I did it in an endeavor to avoid a scene of
confusion. After a time, we all learned what had happened, and of
course the guests for the most part went away at once."</p>

<p>"Where had you been just before the dance during which you
heard the news?"</p>

<p>"I had been on the lower veranda."</p>

<p>"With whom?"</p>

<p>"I was alone. I wanted to smoke a cigarette, and I
strolled round the verandas, toward the back of the
house."</p>

<p>"On the same side of the house as the library,
up-stairs?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the same side."</p>

<p>"Did you see any person or persons other than the guests
of the house?"</p>

<p>"No, that is, not that I could distinguish. But I saw a
motor car which came swiftly up the drive, passed me, and went on
round the house."</p>

<p>"Did you notice the car especially?"</p>

<p>"I gave it little thought, as it might have been bringing
or taking guests, or might have had to do with the caterers or
servants."</p>

<p>"Can you describe the car?"</p>

<p>"Though I didn't see it clearly, it gave me the
impression of being long and low, and of a gray color. Also, it was
going rapidly."</p>

<p>"That would scarcely seem to indicate the motor vehicle of
a caterer."</p>

<p>"Nor do I say that it did. I have no reason to give the
car any thought whatever; and I have merely a memory of the car
passing me as I finished my cigarette and returned to the
dancing-room. I can tell you no more of it."</p>

<p>"You didn't notice its occupants?"</p>

<p>"No; nor could I see them distinctly. I fancy, however,
there were three or four men in it; but again, that is merely an
impression I gained from the fleeting vision. I turned away from
it, even as it passed me."</p>

<p>After a few more inquiries the Earl was dismissed, and other
witnesses followed. None was important, in the sense of throwing
any further light on the incidents of the evening before.</p>

<p>The Whitings and other guests who had been in the drawing-room,
simply repeated what was already known.</p>

<p>The servants had heard no shots, but as they were at that time
in the outer kitchen, busily engaged in preparations for supper,
that was not surprising.</p>

<p>The coachman and gardener had rooms in the barn buildings, and
said they heard nothing unusual until notified of the
catastrophe.</p>

<p>There were now no more witnesses to be heard from, save the most
important one of all, Mildred Leslie.</p>

<p>Dr. Sheldon consented that she should be interviewed, but
requested a delay of an hour or so.</p>

<p>The coroner, therefore, announced a brief recess, and as we had
all given our testimony, we were not required to remain in the
drawing-room with the jury and the officials. But as we were all
more than anxious to be on hand to hear Mildred's statement,
we did not drift far away.</p>

<p>Gilbert Crane and I strolled on the front lawn, smoking and
discussing the inquest. I was most curious to know the reason of
his extraordinary hesitation at some points of his testimony, but
not caring to inquire directly, I resolved to find out in a
roundabout way.</p>

<p>"What did you think of Miss Gardiner's
testimony?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I think the poor girl was so agitated she did not know
what she was saying," he replied somewhat shortly, and as if
he did not wish to dwell on the subject.</p>

<p>But I was not to be turned from it</p>

<p>"It is not like Miss Gardiner," I went on, "to
lose her poise in an emergency. She is usually so calm and
self-possessed."</p>

<p>"I do not consider Miss Gardiner's a calm
temperament," said Crane; "I think she is decidedly
emotional."</p>

<p>"Emotional, yes; but she has a wonderful control over her
emotions. And aside from that, she positively contradicted herself
this morning. I wonder if she did walk around to the west side of
the balcony and look in at the library window." This was mere
idle speculation on my part, but it had a strange effect on Gilbert
Crane.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he cried angrily. "Are you
insinuating anything against Miss Gardiner's veracity, or do
you perhaps consider her implicated in the affair?"</p>

<p>"I have no thought of Miss Gardiner, save such as are most
honorable and loyal," I said; "but, by the way, Crane,
what sort of a gown did she wear last night?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, I'm sure. I'm no
authority on ladies' dress. I never notice their
furbelows." Somehow, the emphasis with which he said this
made me think he was overdoing it, and that perhaps he was not so
ignorant as he wished me to suppose. But I had no desire to
antagonize him, so I dropped the discussion of Irene
altogether.</p>

<p>He was amiable enough then, and we returned to the house,
chatting affably.</p>

<p>Determined to settle a certain point, I went in search of Miss
Maxwell, and found that good lady in the study with her
brother.</p>

<p>"Miss Miranda," I said, without subterfuge,
"what sort of a gown did Miss Gardiner wear last
evening?"</p>

<p>"Irene? Why, she had on a lovely rose-colored
silk-gauze&mdash;a sort of pineapple material."</p>

<p>"Was it trimmed with black spangles?"</p>

<p>"No, Peter, it was all pink."</p>

<p>She didn't inquire why I wished to know; indeed, I think
she scarcely realized what she was talking about, for she spoke
almost automatically.</p>

<p>I understood this, for all day she had seemed dazed and
bewildered, and unable to concentrate her mind.</p>

<p>"What is it, Peter?" asked Mr. Maxwell, "have
you learned anything new?"</p>

<p>They were very pathetic, these two old people, who had lost
their only link to the world of youth and happiness, but the
brother seemed to me especially to be pitied. Owing to his
deafness, he heard nothing except what was directly addressed to
him, and was naturally anxious for any side-lights on the
affair.</p>

<p>"No, sir," I replied, "nothing new. But I
think we shall soon hear Miss Leslie's statement, and then we
will know where to begin our work."</p>

<p>"Leave no stone unturned, my boy; call on me for any money
you may need, and spare no trouble or expense in your efforts.
You're something of a detective yourself, aren't you,
Peter? Can't you ferret this thing out?"</p>

<p>"I mean to try, sir," I replied. "But we have
lost so much time, and there is so little evidence, I have small
hope of success."</p>

<p>"Have you any theory or suspicion?" asked Mr.
Maxwell.</p>

<p>I couldn't tell him of my finding the spangles, and I
hadn't a thought of Irene that could deserve the name
suspicion, but he seemed to notice my hesitation.</p>

<p>"You needn't answer that," he said in a kind
way, "only remember this, my boy. Be careful how you proceed
on suspicion, unless your proof is pretty positive. Trace your
clues carefully, and don't let them mislead you."</p>

<p>It seemed as if he must have read my thought&mdash;or had he
too found some spangles?</p>

<p>Well, at any rate, I would follow his advice, and be very
careful before I let even my own thoughts doubt Irene.</p>

<p>And now we heard the people coming down from up-stairs, and all
hastened back to the drawing-room.</p>

<p>Since Mildred's assertion that Philip was killed by an
intruder, the district attorney had been called in, and had of
course attended the whole inquest. He was a Mr. Edwards, and seemed
to be, an alert and intelligent man.</p>

<p>Like the rest of us, he eagerly awaited the expected statement,
and when the Coroner rose, the general excitement, though subdued,
was intense.</p>

<a name="ch10"></a><hr><h2><b>X<br>
Mildred's Strange Story</b>
</h2>

<p>"I will call the next witness," the coroner
announced, "Miss Mildred Leslie."</p>

<p>There was an expectant hush all over the room, as Mildred came
through the door, supported on one side by the white-capped nurse
and on the other by Doctor Sheldon. Edith Whiting followed, looking
very anxious, and, it seemed to me, annoyed. I knew she thought her
sister was not well enough to go through this ordeal, but I knew,
too, that it must be gone through, for of course this testimony was
the most important of all.</p>

<p>Mr. Billings looked at his witness almost with consternation,
when he saw how weak and fragile she appeared, and he spoke in very
gentle tones.</p>

<p>"Miss Leslie," he said, "I will detain you no
longer than is absolutely necessary. Will you tell, in your own
words, the story of what occurred last evening in the
library?"</p>

<p>Mildred stirred uneasily in the big chair, where the nurse had
placed her, and grasped nervously at the hand of Miss Lathrop as
she sat beside her. The nurse, the doctor and Edith Whiting were
all looking anxiously at Milly as if afraid of her collapse.</p>

<p>But seeming to nerve herself, with an effort, the girl
began:</p>

<p>"Philip Maxwell and I were in the library, and had been
there some time, when a man appeared."</p>

<p>"Wait a moment, Miss Leslie," interrupted Mr.
Billings. "I must ask for more details. Excuse me, but on
what subjects were you and Mr. Maxwell conversing?"</p>

<p>"Do I have to tell that?" and Milly smiled at the
coroner, looking almost like her old self again.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to annoy you,"&mdash;Mr. Billings
was certainly under the spell of Milly's smile,&mdash;"but
I must ask you to."</p>

<p>"Well, then," and Milly pouted a little, "he
was asking me to marry him."</p>

<p>"And you said?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I refused to. I had refused him lots of times before.
He knew I didn't care for him,&mdash;that way."</p>

<p>"He knew then, that his was a hopeless suit?"</p>

<p>"He certainly did."</p>

<p>"Why, then, did he continue to insist upon it?"</p>

<p>"Well, he said that he had something to tell me that would
make me change my mind."</p>

<p>"What was it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, I'm sure. Before he had time to
tell me, that awful man came, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Milly put her hands up to her face, and swayed from side to
side, as her thoughts flew back to the dreadful scene. Miss Lathrop
put an arm around her, and offered her smelling-salts, while Edith
Whiting whispered to the doctor, who only shook his head.</p>

<p>Indeed, all the members of the household sympathized with the
poor little girl, suffering from shock and real illness. But the
coroner and the District Attorney were determined to get her story
if possible.</p>

<p>"Rest a few moments, Miss Leslie," said Mr.
Billings, "and then try to continue."</p>

<p>"It's an outrage," murmured old Mr. Maxwell;
"it's a shame to torment the poor child!"</p>

<p>"But better to get it over at once," said Lord
Clarendon, who was gravely listening to the proceedings of the
inquest.</p>

<p>I liked the Earl's manner; though solicitous for
Mildred's comfort, he seemed to desire that the inquiry
should go on as steadily as possible, toward the discovery of the
truth.</p>

<p>"Never mind the intruder at present, Miss Leslie,"
went on the coroner. "What did you do then?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. I was so paralyzed with fright, that I
couldn't move,&mdash;I couldn't even scream."</p>

<p>"And what did Mr. Maxwell do?"</p>

<p>"He seemed paralyzed too. It seemed like minutes, but I
don't suppose it was, that we three stood there, looking at
each other."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"And then," Mildred gasped as if for breath, but
gripping the arms of her chair tightly, she went steadily on;
"and then, Philip pulled open the top drawer of the
table-desk, and grabbed out a pistol. He raised it to aim at the
man, but at the same time, he said, in a low, mooning voice,
'Oh, to think he would shoot me!'"</p>

<p>"Then, Miss Leslie, you think Mr. Maxwell knew who shot
him?"</p>

<p>"I think he must have known, from the way he spoke. But
the man was a stranger to me. He had&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You may describe him later. Go on with your connected
story, please."</p>

<p>"Well, when I saw Philip take his pistol, I had a wild
desire to prevent either of the men from shooting. I suppose I was
almost crazed by fright, and scarcely knew what I was doing. But my
only thought was to attack the man who was threatening Philip, and
so I threw&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mildred stopped suddenly in her recital. Both nurse and doctor
leaned forward to see if she were exhausted, but she was not. She
seemed to have been struck by a sudden thought, and hesitating what
to say next. I chanced to look at the Earl and found him regarding
Milly intently. He had a curious look on his face, and his tightly
interlaced fingers were the first sign of nervousness he had shown.
He did not glance my way, but kept his gaze fixed on Milly's
face, as if trying to attract her attention. If so, he succeeded,
for she turned slowly and looked in his direction. She gazed
straight at him for a moment, and then tossed her head with a
wilful little gesture peculiar to herself. Then she turned again to
the coroner.</p>

<p>"Proceed, Miss Leslie. You threw something at this
intruder?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I thought if I could hit him I might prevent his
shooting. I snatched up a heavy cut-glass inkstand full of ink,
from the desk, and threw it at him. I don't know whether it
hit him or not, but the next second I picked up a bronze
horse,&mdash;a paper-weight,&mdash;from the desk and threw that at
him, too."</p>

<p>Milly was talking rapidly, and growing very much excited. Her
cheeks burned, her eyes were big and shiny, and her fingers picked
nervously at the arms of her chair.</p>

<p>Mr. Billings looked at her curiously. "You threw these
heavy missiles at him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I did! and it didn't take as long to do it, as
it does to tell it, for my hands fairly flew. I couldn't
speak or make a sound, but I felt impelled to act!"</p>

<p>"You are <i>sure</i> you threw these things, Miss
Leslie?" and the coroner's tone was emphatically one of
incredulity.</p>

<p>"Of course I'm sure!" she declared,
angrily.</p>

<p>"And did any of these things hit him?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, I tell you! It's all a blur to
me,&mdash;the whole scene. But I remember that Philip and the man
paid no attention to me, but stood with their pistols pointed at
each other. Then Philip said again, in that moaning voice,
'to think <i>he</i> would shoot me!' and just then the
man fired."</p>

<p>"With what result?"</p>

<p>"Philip fell backward, and as he fell, his pistol dropped
from his hand onto the desk." Mildred's excitement had
died away, and she spoke now in a tense, low voice, and seemed to
be holding herself together by a desperate effort. Her eyes had a
far-away look, and she went steadily on. "I don't know
what gave me courage, for I had never so much as touched a revolver
before; but I suppose I was nerved up by fright, and I picked up
Philip's pistol and aimed at the man, myself. With
that," and Mildred's voice sank to a whisper, "he
turned his own pistol toward me,&mdash;I heard the report,&mdash;
and I remember falling forward. I remember nothing more."</p>

<p>There was a silence as Milly stopped speaking. Everyone felt the
horror of the recital; everyone realized the mystery surrounding
the crime. Who could have been desirous of killing both these young
people?</p>

<p>I glanced round at our household group. The old people,
Alexander Maxwell and his sister, sat hand in hand, their heads
bowed with grief. Mr. Maxwell, I felt sure, had not heard all of
the evidence, but of course it would be repeated to him afterwards.
And perhaps after all it were well if he could be spared the
harrowing details. Miss Maxwell sat with trembling lips, and though
her heart was breaking, she controlled herself in her effort to be
a comfort and stay to her brother.</p>

<p>Irene Gardiner was listening to Mildred with rapt attention and
alert intelligence. She had not missed a word of all the inquiry,
and I knew she was storing up in her memory every bit of testimony
to be coldly considered afterward. Her air was judicial, and her
calm impressed me unpleasantly. I admired the girl so much, that I
resented this calculating side of her nature, which always jarred
upon me.</p>

<p>Edith Whiting and her husband were more concerned lest the
occasion prove too much for Mildred's strength and nerves,
than they were in the outcome of the inquest.</p>

<p>The Earl sat with his eyes on the floor, now, and occasionally
shook his head, as if dissatisfied with his own thoughts. Gilbert
Crane was very nervous, and fidgeted incessantly with his
watch-chain or a lead pencil or any small object he could lay hands
on.</p>

<p>But the coroner was continuing his questions. "Miss
Leslie," he said, "you have given a very clear and
coherent statement. Now if you will describe the intruder, we will
not disturb you further to-day."</p>

<p>"I can't describe him very much, except to say that
he wore motoring clothes. A big coat, a cap with a visor, and
goggles which covered most of his face."</p>

<p>"Not the lower part of his face?"</p>

<p>"No, but his large collar was turned up, and buttoned
across in a way to hide his mouth and chin."</p>

<p>"Would you recognize him if you saw him again?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I could not. The clothes were not peculiar
in any way. Just such as all men wear motoring."</p>

<p>"Was it a fur coat?"</p>

<p>"No, not that kind. A sort of thick cloth, I
think,&mdash;of medium color, but rather light than
dark."</p>

<p>"And the cap?"</p>

<p>"I think that was light, too, but I couldn't say for
certain."</p>

<p>"Did he wear gloves?"</p>

<p>Mildred looked perplexed. "I can't say; I rather
think he did, but my eyes rested on the pistol,&mdash;it seemed to
fascinate me,&mdash;and I thought only of how I could prevent him
from firing it."</p>

<p>"That is all, Miss Leslie," said Mr. Billings, and
Mildred was allowed to be taken back to her own room.</p>

<p>All! I should think it was enough!</p>

<p>I felt as if I must get away to think things over by myself.</p>

<p>I rushed from the room and out on the veranda, where I found a
secluded corner.</p>

<p>What sort of a story had Mildred told, and why?</p>

<p>For the doctor had sworn she was perfectly sane and rational,
and quite capable of describing the affair.</p>

<p>Why, then, did she say she threw an inkstand full of ink and a
bronze horse at the intruder, when I, who had so carefully searched
the room for clues, found no traces of ink? And, moreover, I
especially remembered seeing that bronze horse on the desk when I
first entered the library after Gilbert Crane had given the
alarm!</p>

<p>Not for a moment did I doubt Mildred's good faith in the
matter. It would be too absurd to think of her making such
statements if they were not true.</p>

<p>And yet how could they be true? How could any one throw an
inkstand full of ink, and not leave black spots somewhere? How
could any one throw a heavy bronze paper-weight, and, being shot a
moment later, restore the bronze to its place on the table?</p>

<p>Clearly she must be laboring under an hallucination regarding
these things. Probably she so strongly desired to throw the
inkstand or the horse that she really believed she did throw them.
Yes, that must be it. There was no other plausible explanation of
her words.</p>

<a name="ch11"></a><hr><h2><b>XI<br>
The Black Spangles</b>
</h2>

<p>As was to be expected, the jury returned a verdict of wilful
murder against a person unknown; and I concluded from this, that
they had accepted Mildred's story as true.</p>

<p>And if so, then the main thing now, was to find the man in the
automobile clothes. He must be some one whom Philip knew and
recognized in spite of the goggles.</p>

<p>He must have come in an automobile, for men do not walk around
the country in such attire. But Miss Gardiner on the balcony
commanded a view of the entrance and driveway, and she had seen no
one enter the grounds.</p>

<p>Possibly then he had come from a distance, had left his machine
at some point nearby, and had approached the house secretly and on
foot.</p>

<p>But how had he gained an entrance?</p>

<p>The servants had not let him in. He couldn't have come in
by the front door without being seen. The conservatory door was
always locked at night.</p>

<p>Oh, well, while all these things were true, still there were
many windows by which he might have entered, and slipped up-stairs
unseen. Then he could have gone out on the balcony through the
little cross-hall and so reached the library window.</p>

<p>Or, he might have climbed to the balcony by means of a veranda
pillar. An agile man could easily do this&mdash;still, not so
easily if dressed in a bulky automobile coat.</p>

<p>It was mysterious enough, but of course the first thing to do
was to look for traces. If I had only known sooner that there was
an intruder to be looked for, how much better a chance we should
have had of finding him.</p>

<p>But there was no use crying over spilled milk, so I started at
once to look carefully at the veranda pillars. There I found myself
forestalled.</p>

<p>Mr. Hunt and Gilbert Crane were already examining them.</p>

<p>"Any scratches?" said I.</p>

<p>"Plenty of old ones," said Mr. Hunt, "but none
that seems to have been made as recently as last night."</p>

<p>"How about automobile tracks?"</p>

<p>"There are any number of those, all over the drive; but as
several people came in automobiles last night, they mean nothing
definite."</p>

<p>"What do you make of those marks on the balcony floor that
look as if made by scuffling feet?"</p>

<p>"They may be the marks of a scuffle," said Mr. Hunt,
"or it may be that some one stood for some time looking in at
the library window. A nervous person standing there might move
about in a manner to leave just such traces."</p>

<p>For some unaccountable reason these remarks of Mr. Hunt's
seemed to disturb Gilbert Crane. He turned pale and was about to
speak, then set his lips firmly, and turned silently away.</p>

<p>"There is one circumstance that ought to be
explained," I said, speaking to Mr. Hunt, and hoping that
Crane would leave us.</p>

<p>But Gilbert turned back and seemed anxious to know what I was
about to say. I watched him closely as I went on, though addressing
my remarks directly to Mr. Hunt.</p>

<p>"I found these bits of evidence this morning," I
said, taking my note-book from my pocket. "They may not be
vital clues, but anything found in the library is of
interest."</p>

<p>Even before I opened my note-book Crane showed signs of
agitation which he tried vainly to suppress. His white, frightened
face and his clenched hands showed that he feared the
disclosure.</p>

<p>Still watching him covertly, I produced the three black
spangles.</p>

<p>"Do you recognize these?"</p>

<p>"No," said Mr. Hunt, "what are they, and where
did they come from?"</p>

<p>"Do <i>you</i> recognize them?" I said, turning
suddenly to Crane.</p>

<p>"No!" he declared, but with such emphasis that I
doubted him. "But they can't possibly be of any
importance."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," I returned, "but I picked them
up in the library, and on the balcony, and one piece I disengaged
from the catch of the library window-shutter."</p>

<p>"Well," said Gilbert Crane, trying to speak
naturally, "and what does that prove to you?"</p>

<p>"It doesn't prove anything," I said slowly,
"but it is a peculiar coincidence that they should be found
just where the intruder of last night must have stood."</p>

<p>"Meaning that it might have been a woman?" said
Hunt, quickly.</p>

<p>"Possibly," I returned. "But none of the
ladies were on the upper balcony last evening at ten o'clock,
except Miss Gardiner, and she declares that she was not in the
library or on the west balcony at all."</p>

<p>"She says that?" said Hunt, looking up sharply,
while Gilbert Crane looked more distressed than ever.</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered. "Did you speak, Mr.
Crane?"</p>

<p>"No," said Gilbert, "I have nothing to say on
the subject." And turning abruptly, he left us and walked
rapidly across the lawn and out of the front gate.</p>

<p>"I don't understand Miss Gardiner's
attitude," said Mr. Hunt. "I cannot think she had
anything to do with the crime, but I do think she is withholding
information of some sort. But I must go now, and I will return this
evening. Then, if you please, Mr. King, I would like to discuss
matters more at length with you."</p>

<p>Hunt went away, and I paced the veranda slowly, thinking things
over. I went round the house, and seeing the Earl in the
billiard-room, I went in through the open French window.</p>

<p>His lordship seemed disinclined to talk, but he was courteous
enough, and by a little diplomacy I succeeded in drawing him out on
the subject that absorbed us all.</p>

<p>"But it's better I should say nothing," he
declared. "The truth is I've my own opinion of American
detectives, and,&mdash;well, never mind&mdash;only you may as well
give up first as last."</p>

<p>The Earl spoke emphatically, and Tom Whiting, coming into the
room just then, heard the remark.</p>

<p>"No," declared Tom, "we'll never give
up; not till we find that man who shot Philip, and so clear our
Milly."</p>

<p>"Clear Milly!" I exclaimed; "why, who could
possibly imagine that that child had done any wrong? She is the
sufferer, not the culprit."</p>

<p>"I wish everybody thought so," said Tom, with but
slightly concealed meaning.</p>

<p>"Doesn't everybody think so?" inquired the
Earl, politely.</p>

<p>"Speak for yourself," said Whiting, in a more bitter
voice than I had ever heard from the genial chap.</p>

<p>"I think we must admit it's all a mystery,"
returned the Earl, in his coldest manner; "and perhaps we
must also admit that little Miss Leslie is the greatest mystery of
all. It's not surprising if her brain is affected by the
shock that she should tell those strange stories of throwing things
around the room. But if she is rational and perfectly sane, I think
we must all admit her statements are mysterious."</p>

<p>Tom Whiting's honest round face showed despair. He
couldn't deny Lord Clarendon's assertions, though it
was easily seen that he deeply resented them.</p>

<p>"But she sounded perfectly sane and sensible as she gave
her testimony," I said. "Of course Miss Leslie is
excitable, but she told a straightforward story, and we have no
reason to doubt her word."</p>

<p>I realized as I said this that I was speaking insincerely, for I
certainly couldn't help doubting Mildred's statement
myself. If she had thrown those things, we couldn't have
found them on the table when we all went up there immediately
after. I knew, too, that I spoke as I did, out of sympathy for
Whiting, and also out of a general sense of chivalry to the
girl.</p>

<p>And yet, after all, was it not more generous toward her, to
assume, as Lord Clarence did, that her mind must be affected?</p>

<p>"I think, Whiting," I said slowly, "that while
Mildred's statements are untrue, they are not intentionally
so. I think she had in her mind such a strong impulse to throw
those heavy things that she really thought she did do
it."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" said the Earl, in a most
unconvinced way.</p>

<p>"Look here, Lord Clarendon," I said, rather sharply,
"are you making implications or insinuations against Miss
Leslie? I had reason to think that you greatly admired
her."</p>

<p>"So I do," returned his lordship, promptly,
"and I make no implication whatever; I hold that the kindest
explanation we can make of her conduct, is to believe that she is
not quite in her right mind. And I hold that this should be no
offence to the lady herself, or to her relatives."</p>

<p>He looked at Whiting as he said this, and Tom returned his
glance. There was not a friendly feeling between the two men, and
Tom Whiting was not one to make a pretence of such.</p>

<p>"Nurse Lathrop says that Milly's mind is perfectly
all right," he said, doggedly, "and I have no reason to
doubt her opinion."</p>

<p>"I don't suppose you care for my advice," said
the Earl, seriously; "but don't trust that nurse too
far. If I'm any reader of character she is disingenuous and
not entirely to be trusted."</p>

<p>"We have seen no reason, Lord Clarendon, to feel any
dissatisfaction with Miss Lathrop," said Tom, stiffly;
"she is devoted to her patient and is exceedingly skilled in
her profession."</p>

<p>"She is an English woman," returned the Earl,
seeming not at all offended by Tom's manner. "And
though I have every regard and respect for the women of my country
as a class, yet perhaps I understand them better than you do over
here. And if you'll believe me, that nurse knows more than
she tells, and what she tells isn't true."</p>

<p>"You're making grave accusations, Lord
Clarendon," I said, amazed at his speech.</p>

<p>"Not accusations," he returned, lightly;
"merely my opinions, based on my experience with English
women. But it's also my opinion that you'll never know
any more about this mystery than you know now. If you had a good
man from Scotland Yard, he'd soon find the criminal for you;
but with all due respect to the American nation, they have no
detectives worthy of the name."</p>

<p>Tom Whiting turned on his heel and walked away. But though I was
incensed at his lordship's speech, he made it with such an
air of simply stating a self-evident fact, that I wondered if he
mightn't be more than half right.</p>

<p>"You see," he went on calmly, after Whiting had
gone, "Miss Leslie's story cannot be true. We must all
admit that. Also she knows more than she has told. Also in her
delirium, she has babbled of things that she doesn't want
told, but which of course are known to Nurse Lathrop. Probably,
too, Mr. and Mrs. Whiting know these things, which is why Mr.
Whiting is annoyed at me."</p>

<p>"But, Lord Clarendon, just what sort of things do you
mean? You don't think that Miss Leslie is implicated in the
shooting!"</p>

<p>"I do not,&mdash;most emphatically I do not. But I do
think that Miss Leslie knows far more than she told at the
inquest."</p>

<p>"That leads to all sorts of conjectures," said I,
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"What does?" said a voice from the doorway, and
Irene Gardiner walked slowly into the room.</p>

<p>She was looking superb in a dinner gown of a thin black
material, which, trailing behind her, added to her natural dignity.
The soft dusky folds of her bodice threw into relief the marble
whiteness of her neck and throat, and she wore a long rope of black
beads.</p>

<p>I determined to ask her the question that was burning in my
mind. "You rarely wear black, Miss Gardiner," I said,
taking the risk of being too personal, "and it suits you so
well. Didn't you wear a black spangled gown the night of the
dance?"</p>

<p>In spite of my intending to ask this question most
diplomatically, I had blurted it out in the least tactful way
possible. And Miss Gardiner evidently thought so. She gave me first
a cold stare, and then seeming to realize that I had asked the
question for a definite reason, she flushed painfully and dropped
her eyes.</p>

<p>"No," she said, but her voice trembled, "I
wore a rose-colored gown, with no black trimming of any
sort."</p>

<p>"And a charming gown it was," said the Earl, with a
very evident intention of filling an awkward pause.</p>

<p>But Irene was not willing to drop the subject. "What
possible interest can you have in the details of my costume?"
she asked, turning to me. She had recovered her poise, and her eyes
flashed as she seemed to accuse me of a rudeness.</p>

<p>"None," I replied, with a calmness that equalled her
own. "Pardon an idle curiosity."</p>

<p>She gave me a glance that denoted anything but pardon, and
turned to the Earl. "It is chilly, isn't it?" she
said; "the autumn will be an early one."</p>

<p>"Shall I close the window? May I get you a wrap?"
asked the Earl, solicitously; while I stood by, ignored.</p>

<p>"Here is a wrap for Miss Gardiner," said a low
voice, and Nurse Lathrop stepped quietly into the room. She brought
a light, gauzy scarf, which she adjusted around Irene's
shoulders. "I brought this down," she said, by way of
explanation, "because I thought you might need it."</p>

<p>This sounded plausible, but after what the Earl had said, I had
a dim suspicion that Miss Lathrop might have been eavesdropping and
made the scarf a pretext. I fancy Miss Gardiner thought so, too,
for she accepted the wrap with a cold "Thank you," and
immediately left the room.</p>

<p>"How is your patient, Miss Lathrop?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I cannot say she is any better, Mr. King. It was cruel to
make her go through that ordeal this afternoon. The reaction is
very great, and she is weak now and shows much loss of
vitality."</p>

<p>"Is she delirious?" asked the Earl, directly.</p>

<p>"She is not delirious; but her mind wanders. She tells
many things which of course it would not be right for me to repeat.
Still, if I thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," said the Earl, sternly. "The
secrets of a sick-room should be inviolable."</p>

<p>"But," I began, "if they throw any light on
the mystery&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They don't!" the Earl again interrupted;
"the ramblings of that sick girl's mind have no
foundation of truth, and would only confuse the case instead of
clearing it!"</p>

<p>"You know a great deal about it, Lord Clarendon!"
said Miss Lathrop, with that annoying smile of hers.</p>

<p>"I know what my common sense tells me. And I advise you,
nurse, not to tangle things more deeply by repeating Miss
Leslie's irresponsible remarks."</p>

<p>"They're not entirely irresponsible; and if I told
all I knew, people might look in a different direction from where
they're looking now. And perhaps the high and mightiness of
some people might have a sudden fall."</p>

<p>As Miss Lathrop glanced out on the veranda where Irene was
walking up and down with Tom Whiting, it was impossible not to
believe that her hint referred to Miss Gardiner. But I also
realized that Irene had not a very friendly attitude toward the
nurse, and that doubtless Miss Lathrop's vague remarks were
induced merely by a spirit of petty revenge.</p>

<p>Miss Lathrop was not an attractive woman. She was good-looking,
but her spirit of self-importance and her readiness to imagine a
slight cast upon her, seemed to imply a character of little
sweetness and light.</p>

<p>The Earl of Clarendon as if struck by a sudden thought, said
abruptly, "Miss Lathrop, I do not think you could tell us
anything of importance. But if you do know positively any facts
that bear on the case it is of course your duty to divulge them.
Your opinions, however, would be entirely uncalled for." I
couldn't help wondering why the Earl treated Miss Lathrop so
brusquely. However, she seemed not so much to resent it as to wish
to return it in kind.</p>

<p>"Oh, of course <i>I</i> don't know anything of
importance," and she smiled superiorly; "but Miss
Leslie did say that she thought the motor-coat and goggles might
have disguised a woman as easily as a man."</p>

<p>I was thunderstruck at this, but the Earl took it coolly.
"Did she say that?" he asked, "or did you suggest
it, and she merely acquiesce?"</p>

<p>The flash of surprise in Miss Lathrop's eyes proved that
he had hit upon the truth, though she deigned no reply
whatever.</p>

<p>"Moreover," he went on, "if Miss Leslie said
that, or even agreed to it, it was with the intent of diverting
suspicion from a man."</p>

<p>"You don't really think Miss Leslie knows who the
intruder was!" I exclaimed, while Miss Lathrop looked at the
Earl in utter astonishment.</p>

<p>"Of course I don't," he replied, "nor
shall I think so, until she says so herself."</p>

<p>I knew this only meant that he considered it the part of
chivalry not to admit any suspicion of Mildred's veracity and
sincerity before Nurse Lathrop; though he had certainly given me to
understand, that he very much doubted Milly's whole
story.</p>

<p>The nurse went away, and her complacent air gave no sign of
annoyance; but I was sure, all the same, that the Earl's
straightforward talk had at least stirred her calm
self-assurance.</p>

<p>"Don't ever try to get information from that
woman," said the Earl to me, confidentially; "she would
withhold the truth if it suited her purpose, or she would so
distort it that it would only lead you astray. You seem to be
somewhat of a detective, Mr. King, and I hope you won't take
my advice amiss."</p>

<p>"What makes you think I'm inclined to detective
work, Lord Clarendon?"</p>

<p>"Only because you ask questions of everybody, and then go
away by yourself to puzzle out the answers."</p>

<p>I was inclined to feel a little chagrined at this brief
description of my procedure, but the Earl's smile was
friendly, and I concluded not to take exception to his good-natured
chaffing. So I only said, "Well, help me out whenever you
can, won't you?" And then we went away to dress for
dinner.</p>

<a name="ch12"></a><hr><h2><b>XII<br>
An Interview With Milly</b>
</h2>

<p>When Mr. Hunt came back that evening he found me with Mr.
Maxwell in the study. Although I did not wish to pain the old
gentleman with more details than were necessary, yet I wanted him
to know as nearly as possible how matters stood; and, too, I wanted
the benefit of his sound judgment and good advice.</p>

<p>"Come in, Mr. Hunt, come in," I said to the
detective. "Let us three sum up the real evidence we have and
see what may be best to do next."</p>

<p>I closed the doors in order that we might feel more free to
speak in tones which Mr. Maxwell could hear easily, and then I left
it to Mr. Hunt to open the conversation.</p>

<p>"First," said the detective, "I would like to
know Mr. Maxwell's opinion of Miss Leslie's
testimony."</p>

<p>"I have just been reading the stenographer's report
of it," said Mr. Maxwell. "I did not hear it clearly,
so I asked permission to read the paper myself. I do not know Miss
Leslie very well, but she impresses me as nothing more nor less
than a merry, light-hearted, innocent girl. Coquettish, perhaps,
but I think the depths of her nature are honest and sincere.</p>

<p>"Now, we have all agreed that her testimony regarding the
inkstand and the bronze paper-weight cannot, in the very nature of
things, be true testimony. For ink spilled on a carpet will remain
there, and bronze horses cannot get up on a table by
themselves.</p>

<p>"Personally, then, I am forced to the opinion that Miss
Leslie's mind is affected&mdash;temporarily only, I
trust.</p>

<p>"But surely there is no other explanation for her strange
statements. And, granting this, may it not be possible that her
whole story of the man in the automobile coat is but a figment of
her diseased brain?"</p>

<p>"It is possible," said Mr. Hunt, "but they
tell me that Miss Leslie is so clear-headed and rational in her
conversation that I find it difficult to disbelieve her story of
the intruder."</p>

<p>"Nor do I ask you to," said Mr. Maxwell. "I
only want to call your attention to the logical point that such
grave discrepancies in one part of her recital might argue doubt in
other directions.</p>

<p>"I have a logical mind, but I have none of what is often
called the 'detective instinct.' That is why I wish to
put this whole affair entirely in the hands of an able
detective.</p>

<p>"And again of a detective's ability I do not
consider myself a judge. If you think, Mr. Hunt, that you can take
care of it successfully, I have sufficient confidence in you to
give you the entire responsibility. Or, should you prefer to call
in an assistant or an expert from the city, I am quite willing you
should do so."</p>

<p>"I don't want to seem egotistical, Mr.
Maxwell," said Mr. Hunt, "but I can't help
feeling that Mr. King and I can take care of this thing. Mr. King,
though not a professional, tells me he has what you have called the
'detective instinct,' at least, in some degree. And if
he will help me, I would prefer his assistance to that of a
stranger."</p>

<p>"Then we will leave it that way," said Mr. Maxwell.
"I shall be glad to have Mr. King for my guest as long as he
will stay, and you may consider yourselves authorized to make such
investigations as you see fit.</p>

<p>"I do not presume to advise you, but I want to ask you to
take an old man's warning, and be sure of your proofs before
you act upon them. Clues are often misleading; evidence may be
false. But there are certain kinds of facts that point unmistakably
to the truth. Those facts you must discover, and then follow where
they lead, irrespective of whom they may implicate, and oblivious
to any personal prejudice."</p>

<p>I couldn't help wondering if Mr. Maxwell shared my faint
but growing suspicion that either Mr. Crane or Miss Gardiner, or
both, knew more about the tragedy than they had yet told. I was
sure the old gentleman's conservative habits of speech would
not allow him to put this into words, but that his sense of justice
demanded an intimation of the idea.</p>

<p>After a little further conversation with Mr. Maxwell, we left
the study, and Hunt and I went for a walk.</p>

<p>"It's clear to my mind," said Hunt,
"that this shooting was done by an intruder from outside, not
a common burglar but some past acquaintance of Philip's who
had some strong motive for ending the boy's existence.</p>

<p>"It was some one whom Philip knew and recognized. The
motive he did not know, for he was both surprised and grieved that
this individual should intend to kill him."</p>

<p>"Then you believe Mildred's story, as a
whole?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It seems to me that we have as yet no real reason to
doubt her main statement, even though the details are
mystifying."</p>

<p>"Mystifying! They are impossible!"</p>

<p>"Nothing is impossible in detective work," said Mr.
Hunt, "at least nothing that is mysterious." With that
we parted. Mr. Hunt went home, and I went back to Maxwell Chimneys
to toss all night on a bed of wakefulness. I felt flattered that
Mr. Hunt had asked me to work with him and I resolved to do
something that would prove my worth as his assistant.</p>

<p>I thought over what the nurse had said, but dismissed it from my
mind as being merely the vagary of an ill-tempered and self-centred
nature. I frankly admitted to myself that had her insinuations been
directed toward anyone except Irene, I might have given them a
little more thoughtful consideration. But it was out of the
question to imagine Miss Gardiner in any way involved in the
affair. And then I thought, suddenly, how I had left her at her own
request on the upper veranda, before I saw Philip and Mildred in
the library. But I had left her far around on the other side of the
house, and later when I returned to tell her of the tragedy, she
was on the veranda at the front of house. To be sure, when I found
her there she was crying, or had been. But all these facts gave me
no suggestion of her connection with the tragedy, but rather made
me anxious to keep my knowledge of her movements to myself, lest
any one else might put on them a wrong construction.</p>

<p>Then I thought about what the Earl had said regarding
Mildred's statements. Of course, Mildred Leslie was a
frivolous-minded, mischievous girl, and more than once I had known
her to make up stories out of her own fanciful brain, entirely for
the purpose of astonishing her hearers. But I couldn't think
she would do this, when giving witness before a jury. And yet, I
well remembered, when I dashed into the library that night after
Crane's fearful announcement, that I distinctly saw the
inkstand in the middle of the table. It was one of those enormous
glass and silver affairs, intended as an expensive gift and not
always well adapted to practical use. It was, of course, shining
and clean, and it was an absolute impossibility, if Mildred had
thrown it, that she or anyone else could have replaced it in that
immaculate condition in so short a time.</p>

<p>I mulled over the inkstand question until I felt as if my own
brains were addled, and I finally fell asleep resolving to make the
solution of that puzzle my definite work for the next day.</p>

<p>As a beginning, I begged Dr. Sheldon to allow me a short
interview with Mildred the next morning.</p>

<p>He hesitated about this, and expressed himself as doubtful of
its wisdom. He said his patient was rapidly recovering from the
shock sustained by her nervous system, and was now suffering mainly
from the flesh wound in her shoulder, but still, he feared that any
excitement might bring on fever.</p>

<p>"But, Doctor Sheldon," I said, "I particularly
want to avoid excitement. I only want to ask her a few calm and
straightforward questions. The nurse and Mrs. Whiting and yourself
may all be present, and if you fear that I am alarming or
overexciting your patient, I will go away at once."</p>

<p>It required some further persuasion, but at last Doctor Sheldon
reluctantly consented to the interview.</p>

<p>I stepped into the sick room, trying to assume a most casual
air; and sitting by the girl's bedside, I said, lightly,
"I just ran in for a moment to say good morning, and to hope
that you will soon be out among us again, for we miss you
awfully."</p>

<p>Mildred Leslie may have been ill, and may have been weakened by
the shock and by the wound in her shoulder, but to look at her, one
would never think it. Two long braids of golden hair lay outside
the coverlet, tied at the top by enormous pink bows at each side of
her head. The lacy frills of her gown fell away from her babylike
throat, and the piquant face with its dancing blue eyes was as
saucy as ever. One arm of course was in bandages, daintily hidden
by the light folds of a lace scarf, but the other hand was held out
to me in welcome.</p>

<p>"I'm awfully glad to see you, Mr. King," she
said, smiling; "they won't let me see anybody; and
going down-stairs yesterday afternoon was so perfectly horrid, that
I think I ought to see somebody nice to make up for it."</p>

<p>I looked at the girl in secret amazement. How could she show
such lightness and gayety after the fearful tragedy she had been
through, and which was even yet with us? I felt sure she had never
loved Philip, but even so, his dreadful death which had appalled
everybody else, must surely have affected her to some degree.</p>

<p>I think Edith Whiting read my thoughts, for she spoke quickly;
"I'm glad you've come, too, Mr. King, to cheer
Milly up. We do everything we can to keep her mind on pleasant
things and away from any trouble."</p>

<p>It seemed to me they had succeeded in their attempts, for
certainly Milly's manner was gay and care-free enough,
although a little petulant at being kept in her room.</p>

<p>"I could just as well go down-stairs as not," she
declared, pouting; "you'd carry me down, wouldn't
you, Mr. King? I've one good arm that I could put round your
neck."</p>

<p>She waved a pretty dimpled arm toward me, and then, taking her
hand, as if that would help to pin down her butterfly mind to
seriousness for one moment, I spoke to her quietly but
decidedly.</p>

<p>"I will carry you down-stairs, when the doctor allows it;
but just now, Miss Leslie, I want to ask you one or two questions,
and I know you'll be kind enough to answer them. I'm
sorry that I must turn your thoughts back to a scene that you must
naturally try to forget. But please tell me if you are sure that
you really threw that inkstand? Might you not have intended to
throw it without doing so?"</p>

<p>She looked at me in amazement.</p>

<p>"Certainly I'm sure I threw it," she said.
"I distinctly remember picking it up and throwing it at the
man. It did not hit him; it fell short of him, for it was heavier
than I thought.</p>

<p>"So then I threw the bronze horse at him. That was heavy,
too, and it struck the thick rug with a soft thud. That
didn't hit him, either; I never could throw things very well.
But I scarcely knew what I was doing, and my acts were impulsive,
almost unconscious."</p>

<p>"That is just the point, Miss Leslie; since they were
almost unconscious, might it not be that they were not acts at all,
merely intention and imagination?"</p>

<p>"I am perfectly sure that I threw those things. Will you
tell me why you doubt it?"</p>

<p>"Because," I said, watching her carefully,
"when I entered the room where you lay unconscious, the
inkstand was undisturbed on the desk, and the bronze horse
also."</p>

<p>She drew her hand away from mine, and, as far as it was
possible, her pretty baby face assumed a look of hurt dignity.</p>

<p>"I think," she said, "I have as much reason to
doubt your statements as you have to doubt mine. For I know I threw
those things. The whole affair is like a dream, a vivid dream, in
one way; yet in another way every instant of it is more acutely
real to me than any other moment of my life.</p>

<p>"I positively threw those things just as I have described
to you, and if, which seems impossible, they were returned to the
desk, it was done by other hands than mine, either human or
supernatural." The last words were uttered in a rising key
and ended in an almost hysterical shriek. She threw her right arm
across her eyes, and turning away from me, thereby greatly
disturbing her bandaged left shoulder, she burst into a fit of
sobbing.</p>

<p>"I told you so!" exclaimed Nurse Lathrop, who had
stood during our conversation, with an air of disapproval on her
face.</p>

<p>She rushed to Milly, almost pushing me out of her way, and as I
had promised to do in case this happened, I quickly left the
room.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. King," exclaimed Edith Whiting, who had
followed me, "I'm so sorry you stirred Milly up so! Now
she will have brain fever, I know! I daren't go back there,
for I am too much upset myself, and the doctor and nurse can take
care of her best. But won't you promise me that she shall not
be disturbed again?"</p>

<p>It was plain enough that Mrs. Whiting did not blame me, for she
knew that the inquiry and investigation must go on. But she seemed
to think that I could prevent the further disturbing of her
sister.</p>

<p>"I will promise you, Mrs. Whiting," I returned,
"that Miss Leslie shall not be questioned again until she is
entirely well. I don't think she will have brain
fever,&mdash;though she will doubtless bring on feverish conditions
by that hysterical sobbing."</p>

<p>But even as I spoke Milly's sobs died away and there was
silence in the sick room.</p>

<p>In a moment the nurse came out into the hall, and said
dictatorially, "You people must go away from here. We have
given Miss Leslie an opiate, and I shall not allow any talking, or
any noise near this room. It is too bad, Mr. King, that you should
have brought on this relapse."</p>

<p>"I'm not willing to take an individual
responsibility for it, Miss Lathrop," I returned; "I
went to Miss Leslie's room this morning with Doctor
Sheldon's full consent."</p>

<p>"Yes! a consent forced from him, and which he knew was
most injudicious! And now will you please go away?"</p>

<p>Without another word I bowed and turned away, and Mrs. Whiting
went with me. We went downstairs, and finding the music-room empty,
she drew me in there.</p>

<p>"You mustn't think Milly heartless," she said,
and a sad look came over her face. "But, you see, Doctor
Sheldon told us that we must not let her mind dwell on the scene of
that night, or it would greatly retard her recovery. So we have not
mentioned it, but have tried our best to talk of other things, and
to keep her thoughts on joyful and pleasant subjects. We have read
to her amusing stories, and Nurse Lathrop has been most ingenious
in entertaining her. Don't think hard of us for this, for my
little sister is my beloved charge, and I would do any thing to
help her to a quick recovery."</p>

<p>"I quite appreciate the situation, Mrs. Whiting, and I
cannot tell you how sorry I am that it was necessary to have that
interview this morning, for it was necessary, for we must continue
our investigation; and I had to know whether Miss Leslie's
statements were true, or whether at the inquest she was under some
sort of hallucination, and detailed imaginary deeds."</p>

<p>"And do you feel sure now that my sister has told you the
truth?"</p>

<p>"I must admit the way that she talked to me just now was
very convincing. She seemed so entirely herself and so sure of her
memory, that I feel I have no reasonable grounds to doubt her
assertions."</p>

<p>"And you must not doubt them," said Edith Whiting,
earnestly; "I'm sure Milly told you the truth, and I
think you will find that out for yourself sooner or later. Will you
tell me, Mr. King, why you have&mdash;why anybody has a suspicious
attitude toward my sister? It seems to me that Milly is one to be
avenged, almost as much as Philip. Whoever murdered him, attempted
to murder her. Why, then, is his a sainted memory, and my sister
talked about and looked at with doubt and uncertainty?"</p>

<p>"Since you ask, Mrs. Whiting, I will admit frankly that
there is as yet a mystery about it all. I'd rather not
discuss it with you, but, as you know, Miss Leslie is of a
volatile, even erratic nature, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know what you're going to say," said Edith
sadly; "that as Milly was found with a pistol in her hand,
there is a doubt as to the truth of any of her stories! No,
don't interrupt me, Mr. King,&mdash;I quite understand; and I
want you to go ahead with your investigations, and find the
murderer as soon as you can. It will not prove to be my sister! but
the only way she can be vindicated, is to bring the real criminal
to justice and prove the truth of her stories. I don't care
if you did see that inkstand on the table, I am perfectly positive,
after what she said this morning, that she did throw it at the man
who came in at the window, exactly as she says she did! And you
will yet believe this, too!"</p>

<p>She went away then, but she had left me something to think
about; and she had made me more than ever determined to solve the
mystery of the inkstand and the bronze horse before going any
further.</p>

<a name="ch13"></a><hr><h2><b>XIII<br>
The Mysterious Missiles</b>
</h2>

<p>I went in search of some of the servants and learned from them
two important facts: first, that the library had not been swept
since Monday night, although it had been dusted; second, that the
maid who dusted it distinctly remembered seeing the bronze
paper-weight in its usual place, and also asserted that the large
inkstand was undisturbed, and that it did not need refilling.</p>

<p>With this new knowledge, or, rather, with this corroboration of
previously attested statements, I went to the library, determined
to discover something, if I had to remain there all day.</p>

<p>First I looked at the bronze horse as it stood in its place on
the library table. This table, which was really a flat-topped desk,
was covered with books, writing implements and bric-a-brac of
various kinds.</p>

<p>The bronze horse was one of a half dozen different
paper-weights, and was a beautiful specimen of its kind. I picked
it up and gazed at it intently, wishing it could speak for itself
and solve the mystery. As I stared at it I suddenly noticed that
one ear was broken off.</p>

<p>It was a very small bit that was missing; indeed, scarcely
enough to impair the beauty or value of the ornament; but if that
missing ear could be found on the library floor, it would be a
pretty fair proof that Mildred had thrown the horse in the way she
had described.</p>

<p>Eagerly I went in search of the maid whose duty it was to dust
the library. In response to my questions she told me that the horse
had belonged to Mr. Philip; that it was one of his favorite
possessions; and that it was comparatively new.</p>

<p>She had noticed the day before that the horse's ear was
broken. She could not say positively, but she thought that if it
had been broken before that, she would have known it.</p>

<p>Excited at the prospect of something like a real clue at last, I
returned to the library and began a systematic search for the
missing ear. Getting down on my hands and knees in the space
between the desk and the window, I searched, inch by inch, the
thick Persian rug and was finally rewarded by discovering the tiny
piece of bronze that I was hunting for.</p>

<p>Comparing it with the other ear&mdash;indeed, fitting it to the
very place from which it was broken&mdash;I saw there was no doubt
that I had succeeded; and though I could not imagine how the horse
had been replaced on the table, I could no longer doubt the truth
of Mildred's assertion regarding it.</p>

<p>Carefully wrapping the broken ear in a bit of tissue paper, I
put it away and devoted my attention to the inkstand.</p>

<p>The large and elaborate affair stood in the center of the table.
The inkwell itself was of heavy cut glass, and was mounted on an
ornate silver standard which was also a penrack.</p>

<p>The longer I looked at it the more I felt convinced that nobody
could disturb the ponderous ornament and restore it again to its
place in the way Mildred told of. For it held as much as a small
cupful of jet black ink, and even though the Persian rug was of an
intricate design in small figures, yet it was light enough in its
general coloring to make ink spots perceptible.</p>

<p>Helpless in the face of this assurance, my eye wandered
aimlessly over the articles on the desk, when toward the right-hand
end and not far from the bronze horse I spied a second
inkstand.</p>

<p>It was heavy, but not so large as the other, and had no silver
standard. I opened it and looked in, and found it to be nearly
half-full of red ink.</p>

<p>I looked again at the rug. The predominating color was red in
varying shades. Instantly the thought struck me that if Mildred had
thrown that inkstand and if there had not been much ink in it, the
drops on the carpet would be unobservable because of the similarity
of color.</p>

<p>Without stopping to inquire how it could be restored intact to
its place, I dropped again to my knees, and again searched for
traces. The pattern of the rug being so complicated and
mosaic-like, it was almost impossible to discover red spots other
than those which belonged there; but at last, I thought I did find
on a small white figure red blotches that were not of the Persian
dye.</p>

<p>Almost trembling with excitement, I procured from a drawer in
the desk a fresh white blotter. Moistening this, I placed it on the
doubtful red spots and gently pressed it. Then lifting it, I found
that it showed dull red blurs which had every appearance of being
red ink.</p>

<p>Reserving further experiments of this nature to be done in the
presence of witnesses, I went in search of Mr. Hunt. He had not yet
arrived, so I telephoned him to come as soon as he could.
Meanwhile, I returned to the library to think over my
discoveries.</p>

<p>I admitted to myself that they gave us no enlightenment
whatever, but they had proved the truth of the only doubtful parts
of Mildred's story, and left us therefore no excuse for not
believing her entire statement.</p>

<p>Hunt soon arrived, and was more than pleased at what I had
done.</p>

<p>"I knew you had ingenuity," he said, in his honest,
generous way. "Now, I don't believe I should ever have
thought of that blotting-paper scheme."</p>

<p>"But what good does it do?" said I. "Granting
that she did throw them, how did they get back to the
table?"</p>

<p>"That is another part of the problem," said Hunt,
"and one which we need not consider at this moment. First, I
think, if you have any more of those clean white blotters,
we'll find out the route traveled by that
inkstand."</p>

<p>I found plenty of blotters in the drawer, and, proceeding with
great care, we succeeded in getting a blotting-paper impression of
many more red-ink spots.</p>

<p>We proved to Mr. Hunt's satisfaction, and to mine, that
the inkstand had reached the floor about midway between the desk
and the window, and that it had then rolled toward the couch, and
had stopped just under the long upholstery fringe which decorated
the edge of the couch, and which reached to the floor.</p>

<p>"That gives a ray of light!" exclaimed Hunt,
triumphantly.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?" said I wondering, for I
could see no indication of light.</p>

<p>"I can't tell you now," said Hunt, "for
some one is coming. I think, Mr. King, it will be wiser to keep
these discoveries quiet for the present. Indeed, it is imperative
that we should do so."</p>

<p>And so, though I wanted to go at once, and tell Mrs. Whiting
that I had proved her sister's statements true, as she had
said I would, I restrained myself because of Hunt's
advice.</p>

<p>It was Thursday morning when one of the servants told me that
Mr. Hunt wanted to see me in the library. I went there at once, and
found the detective in conversation with a pretty and very much
flustered Swedish parlor-maid.</p>

<p>"This is Emily," said Hunt, in a quiet voice,
"she has been telling me of something in which you will be
interested. Emily, repeat your story to Mr. King."</p>

<p>The girl fingered her apron nervously as she stood before us,
and spoke with embarassment and hesitation.</p>

<p>"It was this way, yes. I have, the day after
the,&mdash;the dying of Mr. Philip,&mdash;I have to dust in this
room. I sweep not, but I do the dusting. And under a chair, yes,
under that great soft chair with the fringes I,&mdash;I find the
jewel,&mdash;yes. And I,&mdash;oh, it is that I cannot
confess!" The girl buried her face in her apron and seemed
unable to go on.</p>

<p>"There, there, Emily," said Hunt, gently, "you
kept the jewel and said nothing about it until now. But let that
go; we will forgive your stealing the jewel,&mdash;now that you
have confessed,&mdash;if you will tell truly everything you know
about it. This is the jewel, King."</p>

<p>He placed in my hand a large topaz set as a seal. It was not a
ring, but seemed to me to be a pendant of a watch fob.</p>

<p>"It's part of a fob," said Hunt, "and I
want you to look at the design."</p>

<p>The design, deeply cut into the stone, was a crest, coat-of-arms
and motto, that I realized at once belonged to the House of
Clarendon. Without a doubt it was the property of our noble
visitor.</p>

<p>"It's the Earl's," I said simply, as I
handed it back to Hunt.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course. And now, Emily, tell Mr. King where you
found it."</p>

<p>Reassured by the forgiveness of her theft, the maid showed us
where she had found the seal, beneath a chair near the library
window. Heavy fringe hung to the floor from the upholstery, and the
seal, the girl explained, she had found just inside the fringe, on
the rug.</p>

<p>"So," she said, "I have move the chair when I
dust him, and I see the sparkle stone,&mdash;yes! I pick him up,
and wickedly I put him in my pocket! It is bad, yes; but I'm
tempt, and I fall! but you forgive? you say so!"</p>

<p>I took little interest in the maid's somewhat dramatic
recital, for I was intent on learning just when she had found this
thing. It seemed she had found it early Wednesday morning, before I
myself had looked for clues, and had found the black spangles.
Since she had dusted but not swept, she had not noticed the
spangles; but the seal had naturally attracted her attention as
being valuable, and she had dishonestly kept it.</p>

<p>"Hunt," I said, "there is one thing I can
swear to, and that is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait a moment," said Hunt, giving me a warning
glance. "I think that is all, Emily; you may go now, and
understand, you are forgiven for this theft, only on condition that
you tell nobody a single word about the matter."</p>

<p>"Ah, that am I only too glad to do, yes! I do not want
that any one should know my baseness! I thank you much, sir, for
your goodness, and never, never will I tell." She left the
room and Hunt closed the door.</p>

<p>"It may not mean anything, after all," he said,
"for Lord Clarence may have dropped that thing in the library
at any time during the day, on Monday. It doesn't implicate
him in any way, but I wanted you to hear the girl's
story."</p>

<p>"You're wrong, Hunt, it does implicate our noble
friend! As I began to say, I can swear that Lord Clarence was
wearing that fob himself, at about nine o'clock Monday
evening."</p>

<p>"Great goodness!" exclaimed Hunt; "do you
really mean that? How do you know?"</p>

<p>"Because he showed it to me, especially. We were in Mr.
Maxwell's study,&mdash;I remember the people were just
beginning to arrive for the dance. We happened to be speaking of
seals, and Lord Clarence showed us this one, as a specially fine
example of gem engraving. So, my lord was in this room that
evening!"</p>

<p>"But it might have been before the murder, King. He might
have come in here, casually, as others did, before Philip and Miss
Leslie were here."</p>

<p>"But he said at the inquest he wasn't in this room
all the evening. And, you know, he didn't come up here when
we rushed up. He stayed below, and looked after the guests. I
thought that was a particularly clever thing for him to do. But
now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And also his lordship has about half an hour on the west
veranda unaccounted for, just at the time of the murder.
Don't you remember, he said he was smoking a cigarette, and a
long gray motor whizzed past him,&mdash;and all that. It looks a
little queer, King."</p>

<p>"It looks more than a little queer, Hunt. But I
can't help thinking there's some commonplace
explanation for it, after all."</p>

<p>"How can there be a commonplace explanation? The man had
that seal on, you say, at nine o'clock. He says he was not in
the library that evening at all. Next morning early, Emily finds
the seal here! What's the explanation?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, I'm sure; but what I say is,
let's put it right up to him. I know if anybody found
evidence against me, I'd rather they'd come straight to
me with it, than to go nosing around. And I think that Clarence
Personage is a good deal of a man."</p>

<p>"You know I never did share your great admiration of
him."</p>

<p>"It isn't a great admiration; but I think he's
a right good sort. And I think the fairest way, is to take this
seal to him, tell him where it was found, and give him a chance to
speak up for himself."</p>

<p>"I'm not sure that's the best plan,"
said Hunt, doubtfully; "but you know him better than I do, so
I'll agree."</p>

<p>Hunt put the seal in his pocket and we went down-stairs in
search of Clarendon.</p>

<p>It was now nearly noon, and Philip's funeral was to be
held that afternoon at two. Even as we went through the hall,
quiet-mannered men in black were unfolding chairs and placing them
in rows. The oppressive scent of massed flowers was everywhere, and
it seemed incongruous and inappropriate to pursue our errand in
this sorrowful atmosphere.</p>

<p>In the study we found Alexander Maxwell and Miss Miranda. The
brother and sister were much together, and oftenest in the study,
seeming to prefer to be alone there in their grief.</p>

<p>Miss Maxwell looked up as we entered, but, as often happened,
Mr. Maxwell did not hear us, and so did not turn his head.</p>

<p>Not wanting to intrude, I said, quietly, "We're
looking for Lord Clarendon. Do you know where he is?"</p>

<p>"He has gone," said Miss Maxwell.</p>

<p>"Lord Clarendon gone! where?" I cried,
unintentionally raising my voice in my surprise; and then her
brother turned and saw us.</p>

<p>"He has gone home," said Mr. Maxwell; "he
remembered an important engagement that called him to the city, and
after explaining to my sister and myself that he must go at once,
he went, leaving his adieux for the rest of you."</p>

<a name="ch14"></a><hr><h2><b>XIV<br>
In Pursuit of the Earl</b>
</h2>

<p>Here was a fine state of affairs, indeed! The Earl, whom we
wanted so much to see, was gone; and it seemed to me, and I was
sure Hunt felt the same, that his going was, in a way,
suspicious.</p>

<p>"Why did he go so suddenly?" I asked.</p>

<p>"He had to," returned Miss Maxwell; "he
didn't say definitely what his engagement was, but he said it
was important."</p>

<p>"I have an idea," said Mr. Maxwell, "that he
didn't care to stay for the funeral. You know how queer
Englishmen are that way, and I dare say it got on his
nerves."</p>

<p>"Nerves nothing!" I exclaimed; "that man is
mixed up in the shooting of Philip, and now we've let him get
away! Hunt, tell Mr. Maxwell the circumstances."</p>

<p>So the detective told the two interested listeners about the
finding of the letter and the conclusions we must draw from it.</p>

<p>"You see," I said, "I know, and you do too,
Mr. Maxwell, that the Earl was in this room wearing that seal at
about nine o'clock Monday evening. Early next morning it was
found in the library. The Earl denied having been in the library at
all that night, and so, you must admit, an explanation is called
for."</p>

<p>"But I can't think that the explanation would prove
Lord Clarendon guilty of the crime,&mdash;or even accessory,"
said Mr. Maxwell, looking thoughtfully at the gem he held in his
hand; "he had no quarrel with our boy."</p>

<p>"He greatly admired Miss Leslie," I said, knowing it
to be the truth.</p>

<p>"But he had only known her a day or two," broke in
Miss Miranda's gentle voice; "he couldn't
possibly become so infatuated in that short time that he would
commit a crime for her! And besides, he's a
nobleman."</p>

<p>The good lady had always been deeply impressed by the glory of
the Earl's title,&mdash;a truly American weakness; and she
could think no ill of one who rightfully displayed a coronet.</p>

<p>But to my mind the fact of his being a foreigner, and a titled
one at that, rather argued against him; though I realized that my
prejudice was quite as illogical as Miss Maxwell's.</p>

<p>"Aside from any possible motive," said Hunt,
"we have to explain the discrepancy between the Earl's
statement that he was not in the room and the finding of a piece of
his personal property there. You returned the fob to him after
looking at it, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Certainly I did," said Mr. Maxwell, a little
shortly; "but I can not agree that the finding of it in the
library implicates his lordship in our tragedy."</p>

<p>"What then would be your hypothesis, sir," said
Hunt, "as to finding it in the library?"</p>

<p>"My hypothesis, Mr. Hunt, would be, that the maid, Emily,
did not tell the truth, rather than that the Earl of Clarendon did
not."</p>

<p>"I hadn't thought of that," I said; "to
be sure, that girl might have made up the story, but I can't
see why she should do so. She would have kept the jewel, but that
Mr. Hunt in questioning her about her dusting of the library,
surprised her into a confession. She is simple-minded and
emotional, and her confession, I am sure, was entirely
truthful."</p>

<p>"It may be," said Mr. Maxwell, coldly; "but I
cannot think that logically you have any more reason to assume
truthfulness on her part than on the part of the Earl."</p>

<p>"Emily might have found it somewhere else,"
suggested Miss Maxwell.</p>

<p>"Then why make up that story?" said Hunt.</p>

<p>"I don't know, I'm sure, unless to make a
sensation. She's a queer girl and I've never understood
her."</p>

<p>"I'm positive that she did not make up that story,
dear Miss Maxwell," said I; "and I know if you had
heard her, you would agree with me. But I am willing to admit that
there may be and probably is some commonplace explanation; and
whatever it may be, we must know it before we go any further. Do
you know where the Earl has gone?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Miss Maxwell, "he went to New
York. I think he is staying at the Waldorf; at least, that's
where he was just before he came to us."</p>

<p>"Then I'm going straight there to see him," I
declared, "and I shall start at once."</p>

<p>Hunt looked his approval of this, but the other two did not.</p>

<p>"I don't think you'd better, King," said
Mr. Maxwell, slowly; but Miss Maxwell grasped my arm impulsively,
and said, "Oh, don't go, Peter! please don't go
until after the funeral, anyway."</p>

<p>I couldn't resist her pathetic appeal, and I agreed not to
go until after the funeral, but I insisted on my plan of going
then.</p>

<p>"Did the Earl say good-by to Miss Leslie?" I asked
Miss Maxwell, pausing, as I was about to leave the room.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," she answered; "Milly is very ill
again. The excitement of that talk with you this morning threw her
into a high fever and we are all very anxious about her. I told
Lord Clarendon this, and it was after that, that he told me he was
going."</p>

<p>"Because of it?" asked Hunt, suddenly.</p>

<p>"No, of course not. In fact he left a message for Milly in
addition to his good-by, to the effect that she would be glad he
had gone."</p>

<p>"What could he have meant by that, Miss
Maxwell?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, unless he felt that his attentions to
her had been unwelcome, and she would be glad to know he was
gone."</p>

<p>"No man's attentions are unwelcome to Mildred
Leslie," I said, "and I don't think that's
what he meant at all. I tell you, Miss Maxwell, that man is mixed
up in our trouble, and Milly Leslie knows it. Suppose for a moment
that it was the Earl who shot Philip, wouldn't Philip
exclaim, 'Oh, to think he should shoot me!' and
wouldn't Milly, if she knew or suspected it, be glad to have
the Earl go away?"</p>

<p>"Peter," said Mr. Maxwell, somewhat sternly,
"your suggestion is monstrous! I should be angry at you, were
it not that your idea is so absurd! You are carried away with your
desire to detect somebody or something. Now, my boy, put this all
out of your mind, at least for the present. This afternoon we shall
give the last honors we can to our Philip; and after that it will
be time to turn our attention to avenging the crime that took him
from us."</p>

<p>Mr. Maxwell's manner was impressive, and I felt rebuked
that I should have obtruded my theories and suspicions at this
moment. I said as much, in an apologetic way, and then Hunt and I
withdrew.</p>

<p>"You're dead right, Mr. King," said Hunt,
after we had left the study; "it was his Noble Nibs that
turned the trick! And I hope you will track him down at once. You
can take that five o'clock train to New York, but, even so,
he has hours the start of you. I wish the old people would let you
go now."</p>

<p>"No, I can't offend those gentle souls by insisting
on that. But I'll go up this afternoon, Hunt, and I'll
find that man, unless he has really fled from justice."</p>

<p>I don't care to dwell upon the sad rites of that
afternoon. It was hard to realize that we were gathered there to
pay the last honors to Philip Maxwell. He had always been so alert
and alive, so light-hearted and debonair, that it was difficult to
think of him as dead. And the mystery of his death added a peculiar
horror to it all.</p>

<p>But at last the ceremonies were over, and I was free to go away
if I chose.</p>

<p>I hesitated about discussing the matter again with the Maxwells,
for I knew they would oppose my going to New York on such an
errand. And though I might persuade them that it was my duty to do
so, the argument would doubtless be a long one, and I might be late
for the train I wanted to take.</p>

<p>So I asked Hunt to tell them that I had gone, and to say that I
would soon return. I advised him, too, to tell them that it was the
most straightforward thing to do. For, if the Earl could give a
simple and rational explanation of the question of the seal,
certainly no harm would be done. And if he could not, surely the
matter must be looked into.</p>

<p>And so I found myself in the train, returning over the road that
Miss Gardiner and I had traveled a few days before.</p>

<p>Naturally my thoughts strayed to her, for mysterious though she
was in some ways, she had made a greater impression on my heart
than ever woman had done before. I ascribed her strange ways to her
strength of character, and her cold logic to her high order of
intellect. If a thought crept in that she knew more than she had
told about the mystery, I determinedly put it away from me.</p>

<p>It seemed to me everybody was acting mysteriously. Mildred
Leslie was inexplicable. Her rapid transitions from gay
thoughtlessness to feverish hysterics surely denoted guilty
knowledge of some sort. Miss Lathrop was queer enough, too; but of
course, she could know nothing about the crime, except what she had
heard from us, or what Mildred had revealed in her delirium.</p>

<p>Irene was strange; Gilbert Crane had acted very strangely, and
certainly Lord Clarence's behavior was astonishing.</p>

<p>However, I didn't really think the nobleman had done the
shooting; but I did think that he knew something about it that he
preferred not to tell, and so had put himself beyond
questioning.</p>

<p>Before ten o'clock I was at the Waldorf, inquiring for the
Earl, only to be informed that he was out. He had left no word of
his whereabouts at the office, but as he still retained his rooms I
decided to wait for him. The clerk told me that he had come to the
hotel that afternoon about four, and later had gone out, apparently
to dinner.</p>

<p>But though I waited until midnight, his lordship did not
appear.</p>

<p>Again I conferred with the clerk, telling him I was especially
anxious to see the Earl of Clarendon.</p>

<p>He was not greatly disturbed over my anxiety, but was willing to
do what he could, and suggested that I interview his
lordship's man-servant.</p>

<p>This was a truly brilliant idea, and I directed that the valet
be sent for. But the response was, that Lord Clarendon's
man,&mdash;by name, Hoskins,&mdash;was not at present in the
hotel.</p>

<p>"Did he go away with the Earl?" I inquired, but
this, nobody seemed to know. The Earl had left at about six
o'clock, and as it was now twelve, all the porters and
bell-boys had shifted, and no one at present on duty could give me
the information I wanted.</p>

<p>Nonplussed, I told the clerk that I would go to his
lordship's rooms and wait for him there; for secretly I had a
hope that I might learn something from an examination of his
apartments.</p>

<p>But permission to do this was refused me; and then, though I
didn't want to hint my suspicions openly, I gave the clerk to
understand, that it was in the character of a detective that I
wished to see the Earl's rooms.</p>

<p>Whereupon the clerk nonchalantly asked to see my badge. As I had
none, not being a real detective at all, he seemed to consider the
interview closed; and realizing I could do nothing more that night,
I asked for a room and went to bed.</p>

<p>I rose the next morning with a firm determination to find the
Earl. Surely such a personage could not drop out of civilization
without leaving a trace; and he had kept his apartments at the
hotel, so he evidently intended to return. But to sit and wait for
him was not my plan.</p>

<p>I went down-stairs and inquired for him at the desk, but, as I
had anticipated, I received no information whatever, except that he
was not at present in the hotel.</p>

<p>I thought it over, as I ate breakfast on the sunny side of the
dining-room, and at last a brilliant idea came to me. I was
determined to do real detective work in this matter; something more
than merely making inquiries of a secretive clerk.</p>

<p>My brilliant plan might not prove successful, but after
breakfast I put it at once to the test.</p>

<p>Going up in the elevator, I stepped off at the fourth floor
where the Earl's rooms were, instead of going on to my own on
the ninth floor.</p>

<p>I knew the Earl's apartment was numbered four-ninety-two.
I managed to get to its door unobserved, and then stood there,
hesitating, as if just leaving the room.</p>

<p>I stood thus for sometime, but my patience was finally rewarded
by seeing a chamber-maid coming along the hall.</p>

<p>"Ah! there you are," I said, stepping briskly
forward; "Now, look here, my good woman, I find that I put an
important paper in my waste-basket by mistake. When did you empty
the baskets?"</p>

<p>"Last evening, sir," she said, looking a little
alarmed. "It should have been done earlier, sir, but I got
behind-hand with my work, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind; show me the place where the papers were
thrown. They're not burned yet, are they?"</p>

<p>She hesitated, but a powerful argument that was green and crisp
induced further information. "They're in a sack, in my
broom-closet, sir. But I'd be fined if it were
known."</p>

<p>"It sha'n't be known, I promise you.
There's no one about; show me where they are. I want to see
the contents of the basket that was in four-ninety-two."</p>

<p>"They're all together, sir, but that room is near
the top. Step in here, please."</p>

<p>I followed the woman into her broom-closet, which proved to be a
small but fairly well lighted room. She took up a large sack and
tossed part of its contents out on the floor.</p>

<p>"Will you search, yourself, sir? I must be at my
work."</p>

<p>"Yes, my good woman, go along. I'll find what I
want, and no one will be the wiser."</p>

<p>She went away and I began the well-nigh hopeless task of looking
over the waste paper. But after a time I began to find torn
envelopes addressed to the Earl of Clarendon, and these I examined
with interest. There were many invitations, advertisements and
personal letters, but none seemed to bear on his present absence
until I struck a note from one Mrs. Ogilby Pauncefote. This was an
invitation to her country house on Long Island, at
Osprey-by-the-Sea. The lady asked Lord Clarendon to come the
afternoon before, and as I found also a timetable with the railroad
station checked, I couldn't help thinking that his lordship
had accepted her invitation. At any rate I found nothing else to
give me any idea of where the nobleman had gone, and I resolved to
go to this place, and if he were not there, perhaps to learn from
Mrs. Pauncefote where he might be.</p>

<p>Making use of the discarded time-table, I started at once toward
my destination. But taking the first available train, it was eleven
o'clock when I reached the ornate mansion at
Osprey-by-the-Sea.</p>

<p>The footman who answered my ring informed me that Mrs.
Pauncefote was not at home.</p>

<p>"Is the Earl of Clarendon here?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"No sir; he has been here all night, but he went with the
party in the yacht."</p>

<p>"Ah, in the yacht," I said, endeavoring to assume an
air of intimacy with the family. "What time did they
start?"</p>

<p>"At ten o'clock, sir."</p>

<p>I looked at my watch. "Then they've been gone about
an hour," I observed. "And where are they headed
for?"</p>

<p>"Montauk Point, sir."</p>

<p>"Montauk Point! why they can't reach that till late
this afternoon."</p>

<p>"No, sir; they will lunch on board the yacht, and reach
the point by dinner-time,&mdash;or I should say, perhaps at
tea-time, about four o'clock, sir." He was an amiable
sort of man, and as he probably thought me a friend of the family,
he was giving me all the information he could.</p>

<p>"H'm," I said; "I wonder how I could
catch up to them. Could I get a motor-boat anywhere?"</p>

<p>"I don't think you could overtake the
<i>Butterfly</i> that way, sir. She's a clipper. But of
course you could take the train."</p>

<p>This seemed to be the only thing to do, and I turned away and
went back to the railway station. If I had only risen earlier and
started sooner, I could have found my Lord Clarence with no trouble
at all. But there was nothing for it but to keep on to Montauk
Point. I had time before my train went, to send a telegram to Hunt,
in which I told him that I was making progress and was on the trail
of the Earl.</p>

<a name="ch15"></a><hr><h2><b>XV<br>
The Earl's Story</b>
</h2>

<p>I grew very impatient during the long ride. I had no appetite
for luncheon, and occupied myself with wondering whether I were not
on a wild goose chase. The yacht, <i>Butterfly</i>, might change
her course and I might wait in vain on the eastern end of Long
Island. But surely I was following a direct clue. Surely we wanted
the Earl and I was taking the only way to find him. I reached
Montauk Point and went at once to the dock where the
Pauncefotes' steam-yacht might be expected to arrive. She was
not in, so I waited with such patience as I could command and at
last she came&mdash;a beautiful craft which seemed to be the last
word in elaborate luxury.</p>

<p>As the party came ashore I looked in vain for my elusive
nobleman, but he was certainly not with them. There were a dozen or
more fashionable people, and deciding that the gray-haired,
important-looking lady was the hostess, I went up to her and
introduced myself. With polite apologies for intruding, I inquired
for the Earl of Clarendon.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pauncefote was exceedingly affable.</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. King," she said, "we did have Lord
Clarence with us, but he had an engagement in New York that made it
necessary for him to be there at five o'clock. So we put him
off at Wading River and he took the train back to town. We hated
awfully to do it, and we really came near kidnapping him and
bringing him along with us; but he insisted so that we had to let
him go, though it broke our hearts! didn't it,
Gerry?"</p>

<p>Miss Geraldine Pauncefote, the daughter of the important lady,
agreed that they were indeed desolate at losing the Earl, and she
even suggested that I should take his place in their merry
party.</p>

<p>"I should only be too glad to do so," I replied,
glancing regretfully at the pretty girl, "but it is
imperative that I find the Earl as soon as possible. Can you tell
me if he is going directly to his hotel?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, really," returned Miss
Pauncefote; "I was so annoyed at him for deserting us that I
wouldn't speak to him when he went away."</p>

<p>"He must indeed have had an important engagement to go in
those circumstances," I said, smiling at her; "and I
must go away I fear with a similar abruptness. But you'll
speak to me, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said gayly, "if you'll
promise to come with us some other time. We go sailing nearly every
day."</p>

<p>"I shall only be too glad to do so. By the way, Miss
Pauncefote, may I ask you if Lord Clarence seemed anxious or
troubled in any way?"</p>

<p>"Not that exactly," she said, thoughtfully,
"but he was quiet and rather sad. He told me that a friend of
his had just died, but he gave us no particulars. However, I think
that was the real reason he left our merry-making, and not because
of an engagement in town."</p>

<p>"And it was most considerate of him," said Mrs.
Pauncefote; "for I'm sure there was no reason why my
house party should have its pleasure spoiled by the death of
somebody we didn't know. And of course, if the Earl felt sad,
it was far better for him to go away than to remain, and act
gloomy." This seemed a little heartless, and yet I realized
that a hostess does not like an unnecessary cloud to mar the
happiness of her party. With a few more words of leave-taking, I
went back to the railway station.</p>

<p>I was getting a little tired of railroad travel, but I had no
choice save to follow the developments of my case, so I accepted it
with as good a grace as possible, and seven o'clock found me
back at the Waldorf, once more endeavoring to extract information
from the taciturn clerk.</p>

<p>Again he disclaimed all knowledge of the Earl or his movements,
and with a feeling of utter disappointment, I stood around in the
crowded lobby.</p>

<p>I was uncertain just what I should do next, when a cordial voice
said, "Well, Mr. King, and how do you do?"</p>

<p>I looked up startled, to see Lord Clarence, himself, holding out
his hand. In my gratitude at finding him, I grasped it and shook it
warmly, but I did not tell him that I had just traveled the length
of Long Island in search of him.</p>

<p>"Have you dined?" he asked; "no? Then dine
with me, won't you? I assure you, I'd be glad of your
company. Do you know, Mr. King, I can't shake off the horror
of that Maxwell affair. I went off with a yachting party, by way of
diversion, but it jarred too terribly, and I left the yacht
somewhat abruptly, and came back to New York. I've never been
through such an experience before, and that death of young Maxwell
was an awful thing. Awful!"</p>

<p>I accepted the Earl's invitation and went with him to the
dining-room, my mind in a complete chaos. If the Earl were in any
way implicated in the mystery, he certainly was putting up a
magnificent bluff. And if he were entirely innocent, as he seemed,
then I wanted to talk matters over with him.</p>

<p>It was difficult to accuse him, or even to imply his possible
connection with the tragedy, in the face of his straightforward and
earnest sympathy.</p>

<p>"You stayed for the funeral, I suppose," he
observed, after the first course had been served to us; "I
couldn't do it. The whole affair got awfully on my nerves.
What is your theory of the crime, if I may ask?"</p>

<p>Here was an opening, but I countered. "I'm rather at
sea, Lord Clarence," I returned, "what do you think
about it all? Often an outsider can get a better perspective than
those more closely associated with the occurrence."</p>

<p>The Earl sipped his soup, thoughtfully. "I hesitate to say
what I think," he said, slowly, "for I have so little
on which to base any opinion. But do you mean to tell me that
nothing has been accomplished by the police or the
detectives?"</p>

<p>"It isn't really in the hands of the police,"
I said, a little apologetically; "You see Mr. Maxwell thinks
Mr. Hunt can ferret out the truth, and I am trying to help
him."</p>

<p>The Earl looked up at me with a flash of amusement in his eyes.
"And you're helping him," he said, "by
trailing me?"</p>

<p>I was chagrined and not a little embarrassed. Surely a guilty
man could not show that expression of indulgent amusement. Surely
no one even indirectly associated with the crime, could wear such
an aspect of serious concern and honest inquiry.</p>

<p>I concluded that frankness would be the best plan for me.
"I did come in search of you, Lord Clarendon," I said;
"for I wanted to ask your explanation of a certain bit of
evidence. And as I think you would prefer it, I will put the matter
to you without preamble."</p>

<p>"I should certainly prefer direct accusation to beating
about the bush."</p>

<p>"It isn't accusation," I responded, "and
it's simply this. This seal, which is doubtless one of your
belongings, was found on the floor of the library where Philip
Maxwell was shot. It was found there the morning after the murder;
and if you remember, you were wearing it, and in fact showing it to
us, in Mr. Maxwell's study, on Monday evening before the
tragedy."</p>

<p>I laid the seal on the table before him, and the Earl looked at
it thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"It certainly looks like a case against me, Mr. King; and
I cannot blame you or the detective, Hunt, for thinking that it
implicates me very seriously in the crime. Indeed, I think that our
Scotland Yard men would think it a fairly strong piece of evidence.
Now, Mr. King, I take it you don't accuse me of the murder.
Or, do you?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," I replied; "But I ask you to
remember, Lord Clarence, that you stated at the inquest that you
had not been in the library that evening at all. So I merely ask
you how it came about that this jewel was found there?"</p>

<p>"But, Mr. King, since you don't suspect me of the
murder, what is it of which you do accuse me? Complicity or
concealed knowledge?"</p>

<p>"Not necessarily complicity, but possibly concealed
knowledge. But understand, I do not accuse you; I merely ask the
explanation, hoping, and indeed, feeling fairly sure that you can
make it."</p>

<p>"That's just the trouble, Mr. King; I can't
give you an explanation."</p>

<p>"What, you mean you don't know how the seal came to
be there?"</p>

<p>"I don't say that; but I say I cannot give you the
explanation."</p>

<p>"Then you practically confess that you are concealing
knowledge important for us to know. I think, Lord Clarence, we
shall have to insist on that explanation."</p>

<p>"By what authority, Mr. King?"</p>

<p>"In the interests of right and justice."</p>

<p>"That is a strong argument," and the Earl looked
thoughtful. "Indeed, I'm not sure but that it is my
duty to tell you all I know. Of course, Mr. King, you must know why
I hesitate."</p>

<p>"I don't," I returned, flatly.</p>

<p>"Well, of course you must know that I didn't kill
Philip Maxwell, and that I had no interest in having him killed.
Nor do I want to express any opinion, that may be wrong or
unfounded, and thereby cast suspicion toward one who may be,&mdash;
who must be entirely innocent."</p>

<p>"Meaning whom?" I asked, breathlessly.</p>

<p>"That's just what I hesitate to say. As you well
know, a slight bit of ocular evidence goes so far, and is so
difficult to suppress, though it may mean nothing."</p>

<p>"Lord Clarence," I said, seriously, "if you
will tell me what you know, I will promise that the secret shall be
carefully guarded, and put to no use whatever, unless we can feel
sure that it will positively lead to the discovery of the
criminal."</p>

<p>"Then I will tell you about this seal. As you remember, I
was showing it to Mr. Alexander Maxwell in his study, and you were
present. That was just before the guests arrived for the dance.
Very shortly after, I danced with Miss Leslie. She told me,
laughing, that a watch fob was entirely incorrect with evening
clothes, and in obedience to her pretty, wilful dictate, I took the
fob off my watch. She admired this seal, being especially
interested in the crest, and I detached it from the rest of the fob
and gave it to her."</p>

<p>"As an out and out gift?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I was greatly attracted by Miss Leslie, in fact I
quite lost my head over her. She attached the seal to a long
neck-chain she was wearing, and seemed childishly delighted with
it. She is a strange little person, isn't she?"</p>

<p>"She is. And since you were not in the library that night,
it is to be supposed then, that she lost this seal from her chain
while she was there with Philip."</p>

<p>"Or perhaps she purposely detached it to throw at the
intruder. It is a heavy missile, you know, and the little lady
seemed inclined to throw anything she could lay her hands
on."</p>

<p>I pondered a few moments on this. The fact that the' seal
was found under the chair, near the window, lent a probability to
the Earl's assumption.</p>

<p>"But why didn't she mention this, when she told her
story?" I said.</p>

<p>"Ah, who can understand a woman? Miss Leslie declared she
threw things which she couldn't possibly have thrown, and
then fails to tell of a missile she could and probably did
throw."</p>

<p>"But you don't think Mildred Leslie in any way
guilty?" I exclaimed; "and beside, she did throw that
horse and inkstand." And then I detailed to the Earl how we
had found the red ink stains, and the broken ear of the horse.</p>

<p>He looked utterly astounded. "But," he said,
"how could those things get back on the table
again?"</p>

<p>"That is the mystery. To me it simply proves that some one
else was in that room later who had a reason for wanting those
things restored to their places."</p>

<p>"And you thought I did it, and left my seal by
mistake," said the Earl, smiling a little; "but Mr.
King, to return to your former question, I do not think Miss Leslie
guilty of any part in the shooting, but I do think she knows very
well who the intruder was."</p>

<p>"You do!" I exclaimed; "why I had never
thought of that! Why do you think so?"</p>

<p>"Since you have promised to keep these matters
confidential, at your discretion, I will tell you of the motor-car
that I saw while I was on the lower veranda. That car, with four
men in it, was coming in when I saw it, not going out. That would
be about ten minutes after ten. I've been thinking that out.
Then as you know, I returned to the dancing-room, of course, giving
no further thought then to the car, and at half-past ten Mr. Crane
announced to us the news of the tragedy. My theory is, Mr. King,
that the murderer came in that car, shot young Maxwell and went
away again. I think the whole affair was premeditated and carefully
planned by the murderer. And I think, moreover, that Miss Leslie
recognized the intruder in spite of his disguise, and is
withholding and confusing her evidence through a desire to shield
him." I thought it over. It was all a new theory to me, and
though it might not be the true one, it called for
investigation.</p>

<p>"When you were on the lower veranda, you were on the
library side of the house?" I went on.</p>

<p>"Yes; and that car came in swiftly and passed
me."</p>

<p>"Going around toward the back of the house?"</p>

<p>"Yes; there is a little staircase that runs from the lower
veranda to the upper one."</p>

<p>"Not on the library side?"</p>

<p>"No, on the other side. But of course a man running up
that staircase, could easily reach the library window by going
around the house on the upper veranda, or by going through the
house."</p>

<p>"If he were not intercepted. But a man in full automobile
togs could hardly go around or through, unnoticed."</p>

<p>"I'm not explaining the details, I'm only
stating a possible theory. And I think there was no one on the
upper veranda at that time. We were all in the dancing-room or
somewhere on the lower floor."</p>

<p>"Miss Gardiner was up there," I said, thoughtlessly;
"I left her there as I came down-stairs."</p>

<p>"Then if my theory is the true one, and if the man did go
round the verandas and appear at the library windows in accordance
with Miss Leslie's story, Miss Gardiner must have seen
him."</p>

<p>I quickly dropped the subject of Irene Gardiner, as I did not
wish her even tacitly involved in this matter. "Frankly, you
do not believe Miss Leslie's story, then?" I said.</p>

<p>"Frankly, I do not," replied the Earl; "and
that is the reason I left Maxwell Chimneys when I did. I learned
that Miss Leslie had become much worse, and was growing feverish
and hysterical, and I honestly thought that my departure would help
her to feel more secure and less harassed. I feared it might come
about that I should have to tell of this motor-car, and that it
would worry or annoy Miss Leslie to think that I had seen it. And
it might be the means of disclosing something that she didn't
wish to have known. I felt sure she had done something with my
seal, because I asked her sister the next day if it were on her
chain when she was carried to her room, and Mrs. Whiting told me it
was not. Altogether, Mr. King, though perhaps my reasons were not
entirely logical, they were sufficiently strong to make me want to
leave Maxwell Chimneys."</p>

<p>"To be honest, you had lost your deep interest in Miss
Leslie."</p>

<p>"To be honest, I had. She is most attractive, an unusual
type to me, and positively fascinating. But I cannot think her
entirely truthful; and at any rate, I preferred to come away, lest
my presence should disturb her or make harder for her the sorrow
she has to bear and the part she has to endure in the tragedy. That
is my story, Mr. King, and I assure you that I have no direct
suspicion of anybody; and moreover, that I came away myself merely
out of consideration for Miss Leslie. I trust you're
convinced of my own honesty and truthfulness?"</p>

<p>"I am, indeed," I said, heartily; "I should
apologize to you for having come to New York to find you, if I had
unjustly suspected you. But I did not do that, Lord Clarendon. We
found your seal in suspicious circumstances, and I deemed it only
fair to us and to you to give you an opportunity to explain it. You
have done so, to my entire satisfaction, and I thank you. Shall I
give you back your property, or do you consider that it belongs to
Miss Leslie?"</p>

<p>"As I really presented it to her, I don't like to
take it back. Suppose you take it to her, Mr. King, and if she
doesn't wish to keep it, send it to me again. But if she
does, by all means let her have it."</p>

<p>"One thing more, Lord Clarence; since you have put thought
on this matter, what in your opinion could be the motive of the man
in the car for committing such a crime?"</p>

<p>"Of that I can form no theory. Of course he must have had
some grudge against Philip Maxwell, or he must have been a jealous
suitor of Miss Leslie's. But I think, Mr. King, your next
move should be to discover the identity of that car and its
occupants."</p>

<p>"We certainly shall try to do so, Lord Clarence, though I
fear we have let too much time pass. It is not easy to trace a car
after so many days, and with no knowledge whatever of the men in
it."</p>

<p>"No, it will not be easy," said the Earl, "but
I am sure that if she would do so, Miss Leslie could give you the
information you want. Another thing, Mr. King, since you're
kind enough to listen to my suggestions, I think Miss Lathrop, the
nurse, knows more than she has told."</p>

<p>"But how can she? You remember she didn't come to
the house at all, until after the crime had been
committed."</p>

<p>"No; but she has had opportunity to hear Miss
Leslie's talk in her delirium. Without a doubt, the girl told
many things which the nurse, with her extreme idea of professional
ethics, is not willing to reveal. This is merely a suggestion, Mr.
King, but if you can find out anything from that nurse, I think it
will prove of importance."</p>

<p>Truly the Englishman gave me food for thought. At his request,
we dismissed the subject from our dinner conversation; but I had
carefully laid up in my memory all he had said, and resolved to act
upon it later.</p>

<a name="ch16"></a><hr><h2><b>XVI<br>
The Gray Motorcar</b>
</h2>

<p>Saturday morning I went back to Maxwell Chimneys. Though I had
done very little, if anything, toward a definite solution of the
mystery, yet I had eliminated the Earl as a possible factor in the
case, and surely that was something.</p>

<p>At the luncheon table I told about it, but only in a general way,
and without going into details.</p>

<p>After luncheon, however, Mr. Hunt arrived, and we had a
conference in Mr. Maxwell's study. The guests of the house
were all present except Miss Leslie and her nurse.</p>

<p>Mr. Maxwell led the discussion. "I've been thinking
it over, Peter," he said, "while you were away, and
I've pretty much come to the conclusion that we may as well
give up our efforts to find the man who shot Philip. I was sure,
before you went away, that the Earl of Clarendon had no hand in it,
and I cannot think that we shall ever learn who was in the
mysterious motor-car that Lord Clarence saw that night. And should
we find the car, I dare say it would turn out to be some tradesman
or other equally innocent person. I, myself, am too old to take an
active part in any search. Both my sister and I have a prejudice
against calling in the police or applying to the detective bureau.
And so, it seems to me, that my sister and I would rather bear our
grief undisturbed by harrowing publicity."</p>

<p>"I quite appreciate your ideas, Mr. Maxwell," said
Tom Whiting, respectfully; "but I want to call to your
attention the fact that my wife's sister is, in a way, under
a suspicion of knowing who that intruder was, and of being willing
to shield him. Now we can't stand for this! Edith and I have
agreed that, unless you positively forbid it, we must at least make
an attempt to discover who that man was. You see, the Earl of
Clarendon thinks that the man in that motor-car came up on the
veranda, and shot Philip through the library window. Moreover, he
distinctly implies that Milly knows who the man is, and will not
tell; and that he, the Earl, went away lest his knowledge of the
car and its occupants should annoy or disturb Milly. Now this is
all utter poppycock! Milly isn't shielding any man. She
doesn't know who that intruder was,&mdash;although Philip
did. Now, I propose to track that car, and that man, whether he is
the criminal or not!"</p>

<p>"Go ahead, Mr. Whiting, if you like," said Hunt;
"but you'll find yourself on a wild goose chase. To my
mind, that precious Earl is not so innocent as he makes out! He
pulled the wool over Mr. King's eyes, but he doesn't
fool me. And trying to hide behind a woman's skirts, is just
what I should expect from a British rascal of his stamp!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Hunt," said Miss Miranda, looking greatly
pained; "please don't talk like that about one of my
guests! Why, he scarcely knew Philip, and he had no reason for
wishing him ill."</p>

<p>"He was in love with a girl that Philip was as good as
engaged to," said Hunt, bluntly; "that's enough
motive for his state of mind toward Philip."</p>

<p>"There it is," said Mr. Maxwell, "as soon as
you detectives begin to suspect anybody you let your imagination
run away with you. Granting the Earl of Clarendon was attracted by
Miss Leslie, it doesn't follow that he would shoot another
man who happened to be in love with her, also! No, the Earl is
entirely innocent, and the criminal is as far removed from our
knowledge or suspicion as he ever was."</p>

<p>"But he won't be," said Tom Whiting, "if
I can once catch that motor-car! Can't you all see clearly
how a man from that car could have run up that little back
staircase, around the veranda, and back again after committing the
crime in a very short space of time? Of course he must have been an
enemy of Philip's, and of course he must have had his plans
carefully laid. But a murderer always lays his plans carefully. He
doesn't go around on a casual chance!"</p>

<p>"But if your theory is the right one," observed
Hunt, "Miss Gardiner must have seen that man, for she was on
the upper veranda at the time of the crime."</p>

<p>"Did you see anybody, Irene?" said Edith Whiting,
but she said it perfunctorily, for she knew if Miss Gardiner had
seen a stranger she would have told of it before this.</p>

<p>"No, of course not," said Irene; "Do you
suppose if I had seen Philip Maxwell's murderer I
shouldn't have said so long ago? I think, with Mr. Maxwell,
that he can never be found; and I see no use in keeping up a search
for that motor-car. I doubt if the Earl saw one anyway."</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" exclaimed Tom Whiting, "why
is it that everybody doubts the Earl's veracity? Surely he
would have no reason for making up that story of the motor-car!
Certainly he saw It; and I, for one, am determined to find out
about it!"</p>

<p>"Yes, do," said Mrs. Whiting; "for I can never
rest happy until Mildred is entirely cleared from any suspicious
thought. The poor child has enough to bear, without the added
insult of an unjust suspicion."</p>

<p>"What does she say about the Earl's seal?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"We haven't asked her yet," returned Mrs.
Whiting. "Nurse Lathrop is to ask her as soon as Milly wakens
from her nap."</p>

<p>"Perhaps Milly has wakened already," said Miss
Maxwell, and acting on that suggestion, Edith went up-stairs to
see.</p>

<p>In a few moments the nurse came down, leaving Edith with the
patient.</p>

<p>The white, stiffly-starched personage came into the room with
her usual air of professional importance, and taking a chair,
folded her hands primly, awaiting questions.</p>

<p>Miss Maxwell spoke gently: "Have you asked Milly, Miss
Lathrop, about the seal the Earl gave her?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have, Miss Maxwell."</p>

<p>"And what did she say?" went on the gentle voice,
which was such a contrast to the nurse's cold, metallic
tones.</p>

<p>"She said that the Earl gave it to her."</p>

<p>"Did she say she left it in the library? Tell us all she
said, can't you?" This was from Mr. Maxwell, who was
clearly impatient at the aggravating slowness of Miss
Lathrop's story and indeed he voiced what we all felt.</p>

<p>The nurse rolled her hard &nbsp;eyes slowly toward him. "I
would rather be questioned," she said; "I might say
more than would be discreet."</p>

<p>"Oh, bother discretion!" exclaimed Tom Whiting, whose
nerves were on edge; "the seal business doesn't amount
to anything, any way; and you're purposely trying to make it
seem important."</p>

<p>"Why should I do that?" and Miss Lathrop smoothed
her immaculate apron in a most exasperating manner.</p>

<p>"I don't know why you should, and I don't
care," went on Whiting; "here, <i>I'll</i>
question you. After Milly said the earl gave her the seal, what did
you ask her next?"</p>

<p>"I asked her what she did with it?"</p>

<p>"And what did she say?"</p>

<p>"She said she fastened it on her neck-chain."</p>

<p>"And after that?"</p>

<p>"She said she pulled it off her chain and threw it at the
man."</p>

<p>"What man?"</p>

<p>"The man that shot Mr. Maxwell."</p>

<p>"Oh, she did, did she? that's just what I supposed.
Did she throw it before she threw the horse or after?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, Mr. Whiting."</p>

<p>"And it doesn't make a scrap of difference anyhow!
Mr. Maxwell, there's the whole seal story. The Earl gave it
to Milly, and she wore it on a chain. With the impulse, which she
has already described, and which is a very natural feminine
instinct, to throw something at the intruder, she grabbed that
heavy jewel from her chain and threw it. She probably didn't
hit him, but whether she did or not, the seal fell under the edge
of the chair, and was found next morning by Emily. This in no way
implicates his lordship, and you can readily see that he went away,
lest he should seem to know anything that might react against
Milly, in an ultra-suspicious mind! Now, then, the Earl is out of
the question, once for all,&mdash;to my mind,&mdash;and the only
suspicion we have left, tends toward that motor-car, which must
have brought here the man who shot both Philip and my sister. Even
though you, Mr. Maxwell, do not wish to trace this man, I hold that
I have a right to do so; for the fact that he did not kill Milly,
in no way excuses his intent and effort to do so!"</p>

<p>"Do not misunderstand me, Mr. Whiting," said Mr.
Maxwell; "as I said, I am unable myself to work actively in
the matter. But you must surely know that I'm entirely in
sympathy with your feeling, and that I wish as much as you do, to
bring the villain to an accounting. If you will instigate and
conduct the search, I will defray any expenses incurred, and thus,
in a way, do my share."</p>

<p>"All right, Mr. Maxwell," said Whiting, with
enthusiasm. "I only wanted your sanction to go ahead with my
plans. King, I hope you will help me. Mr. Hunt, may I also count on
you?"</p>

<p>"Of course," said Hunt, "but I tell you
frankly, Mr. Whiting, that I cannot believe, as the rest of you do,
in the entire innocence of that English Earl!"</p>

<p>"And I want to say," said Irene Gardiner,
"that while I cannot share Mr. Hunt's actual suspicion
of the Earl, I do think we ought to verify his story by some
evidence other than his own."</p>

<p>"That's just what we're going to do,
Irene," said Tom Whiting; "if we spot that car and nail
the man we want, that's going to prove the Earl a real
detective, and worthy of his own Scotland Yard!"</p>

<p>To my surprise, Miss Gardiner turned white, and trembled as if
beneath a blow. Even as I watched her, I saw also that Miss Lathrop
was watching her, stealthily but closely.</p>

<p>Irene endeavored to speak further, but was unable to do so. Her
quivering lips would utter no word, and as we looked at her in
amazement, unable to guess what had so stirred her, Nurse Lathrop
arose and taking Irene's arm, led her from the room.</p>

<p>"Whatever's the matter with Irene?" exclaimed
Mr. Whiting. "Anybody would think she was shielding the man
in the motor-car, instead of Milly! I tell you the whole thing
hinges on that man, and I'm going to find him!"</p>

<p>"Will it,&mdash;will it be necessary to consult the
police?" said Miss Maxwell, timidly, a little alarmed at
Whiting's emphatic manner.</p>

<p>"Certainly not," said Mr. Maxwell. "Mr.
Whiting's determination, and the skilled assistance of Mr.
Hunt and Mr. King, can track that car quicker than all the police
in the county. Go on, my boys, and may success go with you! But I
will leave all questions of method and procedure to your judgment.
I'm quite sure I could not help you; and if you'll
excuse me, I would rather not take part in your
planning."</p>

<p>I felt sure that this decision of Mr. Maxwell's was
largely induced by his recognition of his sister's wishes.
She was shrinkingly averse to having herself or her brother drawn
into the actual investigation of the crime, and I think her gentle
heart would have preferred that the criminal go unpunished, rather
than take part in or even have cognizance of the sordid details of
the search.</p>

<p>And so I went with Tom Whiting and Mr. Hunt to the library to
discuss what we should do first.</p>

<p>The memory of what had happened there made it a ghastly place to
converse in, but the fact that it was the scene of the crime,
seemed to stir Whiting's mind to even a more intense
determination to succeed in his quest.</p>

<p>"I propose," he said, "that we three canvass
the neighborhood, and see if we can find anyone who saw that car
Monday night."</p>

<p>"It may be a car belonging in the neighborhood," I
suggested.</p>

<p>"Then we must find that out. At any rate this idea will do
for a start."</p>

<p>We agreed to this, and after some further confab, in which Tom
was the main spokesman, and Hunt took a very uninterested part, we
set out on our preliminary search.</p>

<p>Later on Whiting and I returned to Maxwell Chimneys, and found
there a note from Hunt, saying that he had discovered nothing of
consequence.</p>

<p>"Let's leave him out of it," said Whiting to
me; "he's no sort of a detective, anyway, unless
he's working on his own individual theory. What did you find
out, King?"</p>

<p>As we mutually discovered, we had found out considerable. Sifted
out and checked up, the evidence seemed to be, that the car
described by the Earl was neither fiction nor imagination.</p>

<p>Mr. Plattner, the neighbor on the right,&mdash;though the
country houses sat some distance apart,&mdash;had seen that car
come from the village of Hamilton at about ten o'clock on
Monday night. He had chanced to notice it because of its great
speed, and he described it as a long gray car with several men in
it.</p>

<p>Mr. Allen, the neighbor on the other side, had seen the car pass
his house, going very fast, at some time after ten. His description
was the same, and we couldn't doubt the identity of the car
seen by the Earl and by these two neighbors. This made it pretty
positive that a fast car had come up from the village at ten, had
turned in and stopped at the Maxwells', and had gone on along
the main road by or before half-past ten.</p>

<p>The definiteness of this seemed to Whiting to be a long step
toward our goal, and my half-formed doubts had no weight with
him.</p>

<p>"But the man in the car couldn't have gone up on the
veranda by that little outside staircase, without Miss Gardiner
seeing him," I said.</p>

<p>"Don't you be too sure that Irene didn't see
him," said Whiting; "that girl knows a whole lot more
than Mildred about things, but there's no earthly use in
trying to get anything out of her. Irene Gardiner is a sphinx and a
sibyl and a siren and all such things, but as a witness she's
absolutely worthless! She doesn't want to tell anything, and
wouldn't tell it if she did! But she knows! O Lord, yes, that
girl knows a lot!"</p>

<p>"Not guilty knowledge!" I cried.</p>

<p>"Depends on what you mean by guilty. She didn't
shoot Philip, of course, but she knows a thing or two about who
did."</p>

<p>I made no reply to this, for I was beginning to realize that I
could not speak restrainedly when I tried to defend Irene. So
Whiting went on.</p>

<p>"Now let's go down to the village and see if that
car didn't stop at the inn before coming up toward Mr.
Plattner's. It would be a most natural thing to
do."</p>

<p>So to the inn we went, taking for the purpose a little runabout
from the Maxwell garage.</p>

<p>The ample-faced inn-keeper listened to our questions and then
said thoughtfully: "Yep, I do seem to remember that there
car. It stopped here along about half-past nine or a little later
on Monday night. But I never once thought of connectin' that
up with the Maxwell murder! Land! do you think them men did
it?"</p>

<p>"Did the men come in? How long did they stay?" said
Whiting, impatiently.</p>

<p>"No, they didn't come in; they didn't hardly
stop, as you might say. They jus' whizzed up here, stopped a
minute, and asked me where the Maxwell place was."</p>

<p>"They did!" we cried, in amazed duet.</p>

<p>"Yes sir, they did! and of course I told 'em, and
never thought of it again. Good land! so they wuz the murderers,
was they?"</p>

<p>"We don't know," said Tom, "but
we're going to find out, and we want you to help us all you
can. Can you describe the car?"</p>

<p>"Well, of course, I'm mighty used to cars, as cars
go,&mdash;but I couldn't just say the make of that one. It
was long, extra long, I should say,&mdash;and gray,&mdash;darkish
gray. It was a touring car, and there were four young fellows in it
beside the chauffeur. Now, that's jus' about all I know
about it."</p>

<p>"Do you know the number?"</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't look at it purposely, but I
'most always glance at a number on general principles. But
all I can tell you is, that the first two figures were sixes. The
other three I couldn't swear to, though I'm 'most
sure one of them was a four. Of course I only caught a glimpse of
it, as they swung away, but I'd know that car again
anywhere!"</p>

<p>"Well! we may want you to identify it, if we can find it
anywhere. What were the men like?"</p>

<p>"I didn't notice them much. It was the chap that sat
by the driver that asked me where the Maxwells lived. He was a big
man, one of the biggest I ever saw, and with a big, deep voice and
a off-hand way,&mdash;kind of like a Westerner. The whole crowd was
off-hand; kind of laughin' and carryin' on, but I
didn't pay much attention to 'em. If I'd a
thought anything about it, I'd a thought they was some
friends of the Maxwells, but I didn't even think that. If you
hadn't brought it up, I'd never have thought of that
car again! How are you going to find it?"</p>

<p>"That's just what I don't know," said
Whiting, gloomily; "you see, King, we've lost so much
time. The trails are all cold, the clues all destroyed, and I
confess I don't know which way to look."</p>

<p>The inn-keeper looked on in sympathetic silence, his bland face
devoid of any idea or suggestion.</p>

<p>But I had an inspiration. "There's one thing,
Whiting," I said; "if those men left the
Maxwells' as late as half-past ten, they must have gone
somewhere to spend the night Of course, they would want to get
pretty well away, but I doubt if they'd travel all night.
Now, let's telephone to the most likely places, and see if
they know anything about them."</p>

<p>"Now, that's a smart idea," commented
Schwartz, the inn-keeper. "I can give you a list or a map of
all the hotels and inns in this part of New Jersey."</p>

<p>"It's a pretty slim chance," said Whiting, but
his face showed a gleam of hope.</p>

<p>"We've got to take slim chances," said I,
"if we take any."</p>

<p>We called up a score of places on the telephone, and spent two
good hours doing it. But at one of them we spotted our quarry.
About midnight that gray motor-car had put up at a small hotel in
Millville, a town some thirty miles away. The hotel man described
the car and the party, and said that the man who registered was not
the big Westerner, but one of the others, and who signed James
Mordaunt and party.</p>

<p>We asked no further information over the wire, but determined to
go to Millville early the next morning and learn what he could.
Then, if we could trace our men, to go on wherever we might be
led.</p>

<a name="ch17"></a><hr><h2><b>XVII<br>
Big Jack Judson</b>
</h2>

<p>We went back to the house rather elated with our success; but
when we told the others what we proposed to do, our plan did not
meet with entire approval. The Maxwells thought it a hopeless
quest. Edith Whiting said it could not possibly lead to anything
worth while; and as for Hunt, he openly ridiculed the whole
thing.</p>

<p>Miss Gardiner, too, endeavored to dissuade us. "Why, Mr.
King," she said, "it's utterly absurd to think
you can find that car or those people after nearly a week has
passed!"</p>

<p>"But we can at least try, Miss Gardiner," I said,
wondering at her persistence.</p>

<p>"But what's the use, when you know you can't
catch them?"</p>

<p>"What's the use of any endeavor? and there's
always a chance that it <i>may</i> succeed."</p>

<p>"Well, then, may I go with you?"</p>

<p>"Why certainly," I replied; "so far as
I'm concerned, I should be delighted to have you. Perhaps
Mrs. Whiting will go, too."</p>

<p>We spent most of the evening in grave discussion. There was an
undercurrent of disturbance that I could not understand. At one
moment we would seem to be all working harmoniously in the same
direction; and then one or another would fly off at a tangent with
some inexplicable remark or criticism. But since Mr. Maxwell and
his sister raised no real objection to our going,&mdash;though they
had little hope of its successful result,&mdash;I paid scant heed
to others' advices.</p>

<p>Miss Gardiner's attitude bothered me most. She seemed
determined to persuade us not to go, but she took no definite stand
in the matter. She merely implied her opinions, and made vague
suggestions that we might get into trouble by interfering with what
was doubtless a party of young men on a pleasure trip.</p>

<p>"Even if that car did come in and go around the house and
out again," said Miss Gardiner, almost angrily, "that
doesn't prove the men criminals! Why, they might not even
have known Philip or Mildred."</p>

<p>"But they asked the inn-keeper where the Maxwells
lived," I reminded her.</p>

<p>"Probably because this is the show place of the town, and
they wanted to see it," she retorted.</p>

<p>"But they wouldn't come at ten o'clock at
night to see it," exclaimed Tom Whiting; "I don't
know, Irene, why you're so afraid we'll find those
men."</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid of any such thing," responded
Miss Gardiner, with a rising color at the implied accusation.
"How should I know or care who the men are?"</p>

<p>"You were on the upper veranda when they came," went
on Tom.</p>

<p>"And I have told you that I saw no one," and Irene
spoke coldly; and rising, immediately left the room.</p>

<p>"Now she's mad," said Whiting, with a sigh;
"but I do think that girl is holding something
back."</p>

<p>"Oh, surely she can't know anything about it that
she won't tell," said Miss Maxwell, looking anxious;
"I can't bear to think Irene deceitful."</p>

<p>"She isn't deceitful," I declared; "I
don't believe she knows anything she hasn't told, but
if she does, you may depend upon it she is withholding it from
right motives."</p>

<p>"I can't imagine any right motive for concealing the
truth in a case like this," said Whiting, sternly.</p>

<p>"She may be shielding somebody else." Miss Lathrop
said this in her most insinuating tones, and I at once had a
conviction that she only said it to involve Irene. If so, I
determined to call her bluff.</p>

<p>"Just what do you mean by that, Miss Lathrop?" I
inquired; "if you know that Miss Gardiner is shielding
somebody, surely you ought not to withhold the fact."</p>

<p>"I know nothing about Miss Gardiner," said the
nurse, pursing her lips, primly; "it is not for me to have
opinions on this matter at all."</p>

<p>"Quite so," I returned coolly, "I admit
opinions are of little value; but if you know of any facts you
should not conceal them."</p>

<p>"When I learn of any facts I will not conceal them,"
returned the nurse, and a gleam in her eye made me think that she
looked forward hopefully to gaining such knowledge.</p>

<p>Next morning we started on our trip to Millville. Miss Maxwell
proposed that we take Miss Lathrop with us to give her some fresh
air; and that she herself would sit with Milly in the absence of
the nurse.</p>

<p>Miss Leslie was slowly regaining her strength, but was still
prostrated from the effects of the shock, and also by the delayed
healing of her wound. She was allowed to see no one except those
who took care of her. Of course this necessitated the
Whitings' continued stay at Maxwell Chimneys, and as I was
determined to see the case through, my stay was also indefinitely
prolonged. As for Miss Gardiner, she declared each morning that she
was going home that day, and each afternoon concluded to stay
longer.</p>

<p>And so we started off for Millville; Tom Whiting and his wife in
front, while I sat back with Miss Gardiner and the nurse. It was a
beautiful drive in the fresh morning air, and the roads were
bordered with golden-rod and red sumac. The foliage was beginning
to turn, and for a time the casual conversation was entirely
regarding the weather and the scenery.</p>

<p>And then Miss Gardiner said abruptly, "Who is James
Mordaunt?"</p>

<p>"I never heard of him before," I replied. "But
you know he isn't the one who asked Schwartz where the
Maxwells lived."</p>

<p>"What was his name?" demanded Irene in a nervous
tone.</p>

<p>"I don't know I'm sure; that's what we
hope to find out in Millville."</p>

<p>"I hope you won't," she exclaimed, and it
seemed involuntary.</p>

<p>"Why?" I said, and Miss Lathrop said,
"why?" at the same moment.</p>

<p>"Oh, I didn't exactly mean that, but I am so sure he
can't be the criminal, that I hate to see you get on a wrong
trail."</p>

<p>"I think that's rather a weak explanation of your
speech, Miss Gardiner," said the nurse, with one of her most
annoying smiles.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you can give a better explanation!" and
Miss Gardiner's voice was coldly angry.</p>

<p>But I had no desire to listen to a feminine quarrel, and I said,
pleasantly, "Miss Gardiner's speech doesn't need
an explanation. Indeed, we're all so bewildered by our
conflicting thoughts that I fear we sometimes talk at
random."</p>

<p>"I fear some of us do," said Miss Lathrop,
shortly.</p>

<p>But I diplomatically managed to keep peace between them, and at
last we reached Millville. Our destination was the Prospect House,
and we went directly there and interviewed the proprietor, Mr.
Halkett, with whom we had talked over the telephone.</p>

<p>He greeted us cordially, and took us at once to his private
parlor. I told him frankly that we wanted to know the names of
those men who were with Mr. Mordaunt, but I did not tell him why we
were inquiring.</p>

<p>He told us that only the one name was registered, but that
during their stay he had learned the others. There were two men
named Greene, and one, the big Western man, was Judson; and the
chauffeur was Hopkins.</p>

<p>"That Judson's the man," I declared,
"whose name we want. What's his first name?"</p>

<p>"John," said Mr. Halkett; "John Judson. But
his comrades called him Jack or Juggins. They were a hearty lot of
fellows, and all in gay spirits except big Judson."</p>

<p>"Wasn't he?" asked Whiting, eagerly.</p>

<p>"No," returned Mr. Halkett, "he was moody and
silent; and when the other men tried to cheer him up, he would say,
'Let me alone, boys, I'm feeling down.'
"</p>

<p>"How long were they here?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"Just over the one night. They arrived before midnight,
last Monday night, and went away the next morning, about ten or
eleven."</p>

<p>"Where did they go?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know exactly; but they seemed to be
making a tour along the Southern New Jersey coast. I know they were
going to Atlantic City and later to Cape May. They did say
they'd stop here on their way back, but I never place much
dependence on those promises. Young fellows often think
they'll come back the same way and then they switch off to
another road."</p>

<p>"Where were they from?" asked Whiting.</p>

<p>"Mordaunt registered from Philadelphia; and that big
Judson was from out West. I don't know about the
others."</p>

<p>We asked further questions, but none brought any more definite
information. We didn't want to let Mr. Halkett know that we
had any sinister reason for wanting to find these men, and he
probably thought they had been speeding, or some such light offence
as that.</p>

<p>As we took our leave, I fell back a little, and whispered to Mr.
Halkett that if the party should return, he was to telephone me at
once and privately. This he agreed to do, and then we went back to
Maxwell Chimneys.</p>

<p>Our conference at home after this trip was more amiable than the
one the night before.</p>

<p>Miss Gardiner seemed relieved that we had not traced the men;
though I by no means felt inclined to drop our search for them, and
I had my own notions of what I should do next.</p>

<p>Miss Lathrop made no unkind remarks, but I couldn't help
observing that she watched Irene stealthily, and with much the same
assured expression that a cat watches a mouse.</p>

<p>Mr. Maxwell merely observed that he couldn't believe Mr.
Mordaunt was implicated in our tragedy, as he had never heard that
name before. But when I went on to tell of big Jack Judson known by
his friends as Juggins, both Mr. Maxwell and his sister exclaimed
in surprise.</p>

<p>"That's the man!" declared Miss Maxwell;
"Juggins is the man who shot our Philip! oh, how dreadful!
and that's why he said, 'to think he should shoot
me!' Mr. King, you have indeed found the criminal!" and
Miss Miranda burst into such hysterical sobbing, that Miss Lathrop
at once went over and took her in her arms.</p>

<p>"There, there, Miranda," said her brother,
"don't jump at conclusions. It couldn't have been
he! Why, there wasn't time for such a thing!" Then he
turned to us, and explained, "This Judson, or Juggins, as his
classmates called him, was in Philip's class at college, but
they never were friends. I don't know the reason, but there
was a never healed feud between them. Philip stayed away from class
re-union because he didn't wish to meet Judson. I never
forced my boy's confidence, and he never told me what it was
all about, but I know they were enemies. My sister knows it, too,
and that is why she now suspects this man of the crime. But I
cannot think it. I can't believe that Judson came here
secretly, and shot my boy down in cold blood! No, Mr. King, I
cannot think we have the criminal yet."</p>

<p>This speech amazed me. If Judson were Phil's enemy, if he
came to Hamilton that night and asked where the Maxwells lived, if
his car, or the car he was in, was seen to enter and leave Maxwell
Chimneys at the time of the murder,&mdash;what more evidence, save
the man's own confession, could be required? And the hotel
man in Millville had told us that Judson was sad and gloomy, though
his companions were merry. Surely then, the others didn't
know it, but Judson had stopped at Maxwell Chimneys just long
enough to commit his dreadful deed and had then gone on with
them.</p>

<p>I repeated all this to Mr. Maxwell, but he only shook his head.
"Not likely," he said, "not likely. It was too
sudden, too quickly done, to be even a possibility. And, too,
though they were not friends, there could not have been such bitter
hatred as to culminate in murder. And they hadn't met for
years."</p>

<p>"You don't know that, Mr. Maxwell," I argued;
"they may have met elsewhere than here, or they may have
corresponded. At any rate the circumstances are too suspicious to
be ignored. Judson must be found and questioned, if only to give
him the chance of clearing himself."</p>

<p>"I suppose that is so," agreed Mr. Maxwell;
beginning to take a more rational view of the case; "Go ahead
then, Mr. King, in your own way. I will not interfere. But
don't accuse Judson without giving him a chance to explain
himself."</p>

<p>I promised this, and then I went away to confer with Hunt as to
this new development. It was about seven o'clock that same evening,
when, as I chanced to be alone in the music-room, Miss Lathrop
came to me, and as she approached put her finger to her lip in a
warning manner.</p>

<p>"I must speak to you alone, Mr. King," she
whispered.</p>

<p>"We are alone," I answered, a little coldly, for her
manner irritated me.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "if we're not
interrupted. Now listen, while I tell you something."</p>

<p>"I am listening," I said, really annoyed by her
important and mysterious manner.</p>

<p>"Don't be so rude! you'll change your tune
when you hear what I have to tell you."</p>

<p>"What have you to tell me?" I asked, more gently,
for I suddenly realized that if I antagonized her, I might miss
some real information.</p>

<p>"Only this. Miss Gardiner has just mailed a letter
addressed to Mr. John Judson."</p>

<p><i>"What?"</i>
</p>

<p>"Don't speak so loud! It is just as I tell you. So
you see they are colleagues!"</p>

<p>"They are <i>what?"</i></p>

<p>"Do stop asking absurd questions,&mdash;you heard me! I
tell you because I think you ought to know, that Miss Gardiner is
in correspondence with that man."</p>

<p>"She <i>isn't</i> in correspondence with
him!"</p>

<p>"Well, she has just written him, at any rate; and she must
be in correspondence with him or how could she know his
address?"</p>

<p>"What is his address?"</p>

<p>"The letter is directed to him at Cape May."</p>

<p>I had recovered from my first dazed bewilderment, and though
still angry, I knew it was better not to show this. Moreover, if
what the nurse told me was true, as of course it must be, I must
find out all I could from her.</p>

<p>"How do you know this? You've been prying into Miss
Gardiner's private affairs!"</p>

<p>"Is not that allowable if one is tracking a
murderer?"</p>

<p>I could not restrain my anger entirely. "I didn't
know you were officially employed in this matter," I flung at
her.</p>

<p>"Nor am I," she said, proudly; "if my
voluntary assistance is scorned, I will discontinue it."</p>

<p>She turned away, and I saw I was defeating my own ends.
"Wait a moment, Miss Lathrop," I begged; "I ask
your pardon if I have offended you, but I'm nearly at my
wits' end in this matter, and your revelation is indeed a
surprise to me. How did you discover this letter?"</p>

<p>"I happened to take a letter myself to the mailbox in the
hall, and I found the footman just emptying the box to take the
letters to the post office. I chanced to see the name Judson on one
of them, and naturally it caught my eye. So I looked at the letter,
and saw that it was in Miss Gardiner's handwriting. I noted
the address, and I said nothing to anyone else, but brought the
information directly to you. Have I done right?"</p>

<p>"You have certainly done right in telling me about it,
Miss Lathrop. May I ask you not to mention it to any one
else,&mdash;at least not for the present?"</p>

<p>"I will not mention it," said Miss Lathrop, and then
she glided swiftly away, and I was left to ponder on her
astonishing news.</p>

<p>But after only a short consideration, I decided to go at once to
Miss Gardiner and ask for the truth. There could be no ordinary or
innocent reason why she should be corresponding with the man we
suspected of crime. She must have concealed knowledge of some sort,
whether guilty or not. It was nearly dinner time, but I sent a
message to her asking her to see me at once for a moment in the
music-room.</p>

<p>She came down almost immediately, and as she entered, though her
manner was cold and distant, I thought I had never seen her look
more beautiful. Her soft, trailing, black gown was most becoming,
and a gauzy black scarf that veiled her white shoulders seemed to
add to her dignity and hauteur.</p>

<p>"You sent for me?" she said, without a smile, and in
low, level tones.</p>

<p>"I did," I replied, "and I'm going to
tell you frankly, why I did so. I have learned, Miss Gardiner, that
you have just sent a letter to Mr. John Judson."</p>

<p>"Have I not a right to send letters to whom I
choose?"</p>

<p>"You certainly have. But when such a letter proves that
you know the address of the man we are looking for, I have a right
to ask you what you know of him, and why you conceal from us the
fact that you do know him."</p>

<p>"And if you have a right to ask those questions, I also
have a right to refuse to answer them."</p>

<p>"You have that right, but is it wise to exercise it, Miss
Gardiner? Please drop this antagonistic attitude, and if
you're not willing to help us in our search, won't you
tell me why?"</p>

<p>"I'm not willing to help you in your search, and I
refuse to tell you why."</p>

<p>Miss Gardiner spoke deliberately, and turning slowly, left the
room. It may have been my imagination, but I thought she hesitated
an instant at the doorway, as if half hoping I would call her back.
But I did not do so, as I knew it was but a few moments before
dinner time, and I quickly concluded to wait until the evening, and
then endeavor to get her alone for a more protracted interview.</p>

<p>All through the meal I was pre-occupied and found it difficult
to control my thoughts sufficiently to take part in the general
conversation. Moreover, when I lifted my eyes, I invariably found
either Miss Gardiner or Miss Lathrop regarding me intently, and I
found it embarrassing to meet their gaze.</p>

<a name="ch18"></a><hr><h2><b>XVIII<br>
A Pistol Shot</b>
</h2>

<p>Dinner was nearly over when I was called to the telephone.
Excusing myself from the table, I answered the summons, only to
find that it was Mr. Halkett, of the Millville Hotel, who wished to
speak to me. His message was of importance, for it told me that the
gray car and the four men of Mordaunt's party had returned to
the Prospect House, on their way back to Philadelphia.</p>

<p>"Why, I thought they had gone to Cape May," I said,
impulsively.</p>

<p>"They did intend to," replied Mr. Halkett,
"but they changed their plan, and they're here for the
night. They're going to stay here until eleven o'clock
or so to-morrow morning. They don't know I'm telling
you this, as that's according to your orders."</p>

<p>"All right, Mr. Halkett," I said, seriously;
"don't let them know you've telephoned me; for,
understand, this is an important matter. On no account raise their
suspicions in any way, but see to it that they don't leave
any earlier than eleven tomorrow morning."</p>

<p>"All right, Mr. King; I'll see to that."</p>

<p>I went back to the table, intending to tell them all what I had
just heard, but on second thoughts I decided not to. So I said
nothing about it until after dinner, when I told Tom Whiting only.
I also told him about Irene's letter to Judson, proving that
she had thought him at Cape May, whereas the party were on their
return trip. He agreed with me that the situation had grown
serious, and that we must move carefully.</p>

<p>We concluded to say nothing to anyone, but to go alone next
morning over to Millville.</p>

<p>Of course, I gave up my idea of another interview with Irene
that night, as I wanted to keep her unaware of the fact that Judson
was at Millville.</p>

<p>Nor did I tell Hunt, as it seemed to me that Whiting and I could
handle the case best alone.</p>

<p>So next morning, immediately after breakfast, we started. The
little runabout was a swift car, and we had ample time to reach
Millville by ten o'clock.</p>

<p>But just at the last moment, indeed, as I was getting into the
car, Miss Lathrop ran out to speak to me.</p>

<p>"I couldn't get a chance to tell you before,"
she whispered; "but Miss Gardiner has sent that Judson man
another letter! She had it mailed late last night, and it was
addressed to Millville, and it had a special delivery stamp on
it."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Miss Lathrop," I said, and for once I
was honestly grateful to her.</p>

<p>"Speed her up, Tom!" I said, as I swung into the
little car beside Whiting; "we've a new reason for
haste. Get over to Millville as quick as you can. Irene has sent
that man another letter, and he'll get away from us
yet!"</p>

<p>"Great Scott, King!" said Tom, as we took a higher
speed; "what is that girl up to? You know, King,
there's nothing crooked about Irene."</p>

<p>"Then she's coerced or threatened by that villain
Judson," I declared. "He's the murderer, Tom, and
Irene knows it!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no! not so bad as that! Well, any how,
we'll soon find out."</p>

<p>We said little more as we tore along the miles. My thoughts were
busy with this sudden new surprise. How had Irene discovered that
Judson was in Millville, when a few hours before she had thought
him at Cape May? To be sure she might have had a letter or telegram
in the meantime; or,&mdash;and what was more likely the
case,&mdash;she had heard enough of my telephoning to realize that
the Mordaunt party were back at Millville and to act
accordingly.</p>

<p>On we flew, and I said no word to Tom, lest I distract his
attention from his driving. Moreover, I knew the situation must
mystify him quite as much as it did me.</p>

<p>After an incredibly short trip, we whirled in at the hotel
entrance. Only to be met by a distracted proprietor, who told us
the car had just left with the Mordaunt party. .</p>

<p>"But I told you not to let them get away!" I
thundered, in mad disappointment.</p>

<p>"I know it, Mr. King," said Halkett, apologetically,
"but I couldn't help it. I had to go over to the bank
on an important matter and when I came back the party had just
gone. Of course I couldn't forcibly restrain them."</p>

<p>"No, I suppose you couldn't. Which way did they
go?"</p>

<p>"That way. The main road to Philadelphia."</p>

<p>"Turn around, Tom! chase them! it's our only
chance."</p>

<p>Whiting swung the car around, and we flew out of the gate and
along the main road.</p>

<p>"There's little hope," I shouted at him, as we
whizzed madly on, "but if they've had tire trouble or
anything, we might overtake them. Anyway, we'll have a try at
it for a few miles,&mdash;and then give it up, if we have
to."</p>

<p>Whiting fully entered into the spirit of the thing, and we went
faster than I had ever before traveled in a motor-car. The little
machine rocked, and I involuntarily grasped at the side of the
seat, lest I be flung out. Fortunately the road was clear, and of
course a good one, and we kept on. I was just about ready to cry
quits, when we saw a car ahead of us. And, moreover, it was
<i>the</i> car!</p>

<p>"That's it, Tom!" I shouted; "speed
her!" He couldn't speed her any more than he was
already doing, but as we had gained on the big car, I believed we
could continue to gain.</p>

<p>And we did! Of course Mordaunt's car was not going at top
speed, as they didn't know they were being pursued,&mdash;a
fact which I hoped they would not discover.</p>

<p>But they did discover it. Whether a case of a guilty conscience
or not, a man rose from his seat in the tonneau, and turned to look
backward. He saw us, and must have realized that we were chasing
them, for they immediately began to go faster.</p>

<p>The big car sped ahead, and we followed. "Speed her,
Tom!" I cried; "whoop her up!"</p>

<p>"Can't do any more," Tom replied; "this
is our best." The poor fellow was straining every nerve, and
bent to his wheel in a frenzy of excitement. The man in the car
ahead was still standing, and looking backward at us.</p>

<p>The space between the cars lengthened slowly, and I realized
that soon they would spin ahead out of our sight. I said nothing to
Tom, for I knew he could not get another ounce of speed out of our
car.</p>

<p>The big man who stood gazing at us, as the touring car streaked
ahead, was doubtless Jack Judson. He was an enormous man, and swung
his arms with the free movement of a Westerner. Though I could not
see his features distinctly, I felt the triumphant smile on his
face, as he took off his soft, flapping hat and waved it at us in
farewell.</p>

<p>But even as he replaced that hat, I saw his face more clearly,
and I suddenly realized that this meant a lessening of the distance
between us!</p>

<p>"Tom!" I fairly yelled in his ear;
"they're slowing down! they don't mean
to,&mdash;but something has happened! we're gaining on them!
Never mind, boy, don't even look up,&mdash;just saw
wood!"</p>

<p>Obediently Tom watched his wheel, and I stared at the car, to
which we were certainly creeping nearer. Yes, slowly but steadily
nearer, and now I could discern Judson's face clearly, and
could see his baffled expression give way to one of new resolve.
Stooping an instant, the big man straightened up again, and now in
his right hand he held what was unmistakably a deadly
sharpshooter!</p>

<p>"Tom!" I cried, actually more alarmed for my
unconscious companion than for myself;
"Tom,&mdash;<i>duck!</i> he's going to shoot
us!"</p>

<p>In my excitement, I didn't think of ducking myself, and I
sat spellbound, gazing at that weapon aimed surely at us, while
Tom, after one glance, dropped his head in an effort to shield
himself.</p>

<p>The next instant a report rang out, and as the big car passed
out of sight, our pace slackened and we went along limpingly.</p>

<p>The big Westerner had cleverly and purposely punctured one of
our front tires!</p>

<p>After the report, Tom's head came up, and he evidently
expected, as he was unhurt, to see me wounded or dead beside him.
His look of amazement was almost comical, when I said, "He
shot at the tire, Whiting, not at us, and with his blooming Western
skill, he hit it!"</p>

<p>He had done just that, and now there was nothing for us to do,
but to get out and mend the tire and then go home.</p>

<p>We did so, and though we talked the matter over all the way
home, we could come to no other conclusion than that Judson was the
murderer and that he had escaped us.</p>

<p>"I shall put it straight up to Miss Gardiner," I
declared; "she knows about this thing and she must be made to
tell."</p>

<p>"She must know about it," said Whiting, "but I
can't believe yet that she is wilfully shielding a murderer.
It must be from some mistaken sense of duty or loyalty to some
one."</p>

<p>"She's certainly very much interested in this man
Judson," I returned, a little gloomily. I was really under
the spell of Miss Gardiner's fascination, and of course I
hoped she could clear up all these uncertainties, but certainly the
Judson affair looked ominous.</p>

<p>After luncheon that day, I made a special request of Miss
Gardiner that she would confer with Tom Whiting and myself. She
agreed willingly enough, and we went to the music-room for our
talk.</p>

<p>We had thought it better not to tell the rest of the household
about our morning's experience until after the conference
with Irene. So I had told Mr. Maxwell that the Mordaunt party had
left the hotel before we reached there and told him nothing more.
But he discerned somehow, that there was more to the story, and he
joined us in the music-room, uninvited.</p>

<p>As there was no real reason why he shouldn't know all
about it, I was quite willing he should be there.</p>

<p>In consideration of his deafness, we all sat near together and
spoke distinctly.</p>

<p>"To begin with," I said, "I'm positive
that John Judson is the man who shot Philip and Mildred."</p>

<p>"And I am equally positive he did not!" declared
Irene, her eyes blazing; "and I can prove it!"</p>

<p>"You can!" exclaimed Tom Whiting; "what do you
know, Irene, that the rest of us don't know? and why are you
willing to defeat the efforts of right and justice?"</p>

<p>"First tell me what happened this morning," said the
girl.</p>

<p>So I gave a rapid account of our pursuit of the Mordaunt car,
and of Judson's shooting our tire in order to make his own
escape.</p>

<p>"Then he got away safely?" asked Irene, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Yes, he is now well on toward Philadelphia. Are you glad
he escaped?"</p>

<p>"I certainly am, as the man is absolutely innocent of any
connection with our mystery."</p>

<p>"You know this Judson, then, Miss Gardiner?" asked
Mr. Maxwell.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know him very well."</p>

<p>"Then you know he was an enemy to Philip?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly an enemy, though I know they never liked each
other. But since Mr. Judson is safely away, I will tell you the
whole story. He has been a friend of mine for some years, and
though he has asked me several times to marry him, I have always
refused him. Last week he went to see me at my home in New York,
and they told him I was down here. He was making a motor trip with
Mr. Mordaunt, and on their way to Atlantic City, they stopped here
at Mr. Judson's request. He wrote me that he wanted to see me
once more before he went West, but he did not care to meet Philip.
So I wrote him that I would be on the upper veranda Monday night at
ten o'clock, and that he might come up by the little outside
staircase, and thus he need not see Philip at all. He did this, and
it was Mr. Mordaunt's car that the Earl saw that
night."</p>

<p>"Then Judson did come up on the upper veranda, Monday
night at ten o'clock," Said Tom Whiting; "and yet
you say he had nothing to do with the shooting!"</p>

<p>"Absolutely nothing," said Irene. "We were on
the other side of the house from the library, and he remained with
me not more than two minutes."</p>

<p>"Why such a short stay?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"Because,&mdash;because I was crying when he came, and I
didn't want to see him anyway, and I begged him to go away at
once."</p>

<p>"At what time was this?"</p>

<p>"I don't know exactly, but it was quite some time
after ten. In fact, Mr. King came and told me about Philip and
Mildred, very soon after Mr. Judson went away. But I can swear, if
necessary, that he only came up to see me, stayed but a few moments
and went away again. He did not go round to the library side of the
house at all."</p>

<p>"What were you crying about?" asked Whiting,
gently.</p>

<p>"I was upset and nervous, and I couldn't control
myself."</p>

<p>"You have heard from Mr. Judson since?" asked Mr.
Maxwell, who was paying close attention to Irene's story.</p>

<p>"Yes,&mdash;and of course he has heard of the murder, but
he has no idea he was suspected of it. But I wanted him to get
away, for to detain him and make inquiries, would only mean trouble
for an innocent man. So I wrote him at Millville that you were
going over there, and begged him to get away before you came. I
think he must have been mystified at my urging him to a speedy
departure, but I'm glad to know that he did as I advised
him."</p>

<p>"It is a strange story, Miss Gardiner," said Mr.
Maxwell, thoughtfully, "but of course I do not doubt your
word."</p>

<p>"You need not," said Irene, haughtily. "I have
told only the exact truth. If I have concealed this episode, it is
only because I didn't wish Mr. Judson's name brought
into question at all."</p>

<p>We talked for some time after this, and we all agreed that as
Judson was now entirely out of it, we must look in some other
direction.</p>

<p>"I don't think Mr. Hunt is doing much," said
Whiting, "and I think, Mr. Maxwell, it would be wise to put
the whole affair in the hands of the police."</p>

<p>"If you think best," said the old gentleman,
hopelessly. "I think myself, that Mr. Hunt is not discovering
anything, but that may not be his fault. As I told you, Tom,
whatever you and Peter agree upon, I will agree to. But I cannot
seem to take any initiative. I am too old, and my deafness stands
in my way, when I would question anybody."</p>

<p>"Certainly, Mr. Maxwell," said I, "you could
not be expected to take up this matter personally. I'll see
Hunt again, and if he agrees, I think we will give it over to the
police."</p>

<p>But before I saw Hunt, I determined to do a little more
investigating by myself. I went up to the library, hoping that from
the scene of the crime I could get some hint of which direction to
turn.</p>

<p>Of course, too much time had elapsed to look for further clues,
but as I sat there, something brought back to my mind the black
spangles I had found that next morning. The maid who had found the
Earl's seal must have overlooked the tiny spangles as I found
them later. But she might have found others of the same sort when
she dusted the room, and I determined to ask her.</p>

<p>I went in search of her, and showing her the spangles I had, I
inquired if she had seen any like them in the library the morning
she had found the seal. At first she couldn't remember, and
then she recollected having picked up two or three near the
window.</p>

<p>"Have you any idea," I said, "where they could
have come from? Did any of the ladies wear a spangled dress that
night?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I know where they have come from," she said,
quickly; "they are from the fan of Miss Gardiner."</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"Because Miss Gardiner carried the black fan that evening.
She left it on a seat on the veranda, and I found it and put it
again in her room."</p>

<p>"You are certain, Emily, that Miss Gardiner carried the
fan that evening?"</p>

<p>"I am sure, Mr. King."</p>

<p>"That is all, Emily, you may go."</p>

<p>Here was something definite. For I remembered distinctly that
Miss Gardiner went to her room to get that fan just before she and
I walked together on the upper veranda. Then I left her, and she
remained up there, and Judson found her there, crying. Meantime,
some spangles from that fan had been dropped by the library window!
It seemed to me positive proof that Irene had been around there
between half past nine and half past ten that night. The more I
thought it over the more I was convinced that it must be so. And
yet, I did not like to face her with these facts and ask an
explanation. But it seemed to me that I must do this, before going
any further.</p>

<p>So I went on my very distasteful errand, and found Miss Gardiner
in the music-room with Miss Maxwell.</p>

<p>"You know," I said, speaking to the girl, "it
is our duty to investigate every possible clue."</p>

<p>"Of course," said Irene, but she trembled nervously
and seemed to apprehend some new disclosure.</p>

<p>"Then I will show you these spangles," I said,
taking them from my pocketbook, "and ask you if they could
have dropped from a fan of yours." Irene looked at them, and
said, quietly, "I have a black spangled fan; they may very
likely have dropped from it."</p>

<p>"Did you carry it the Monday night that Philip
died?"</p>

<p>"I may have done so; I don't remember exactly.
Why?"</p>

<p>"Because these spangles were found in the library, the
morning after the shooting."</p>

<p>"And you think that turns suspicion toward me?"
Irene rose, and stood with flashing eyes, the embodiment of
indignation and anger. "You are entirely mistaken, Mr. King,
as to your suspicions! They may be spangles from my fan, they may
have been dropped in the library; but I was in and out of that room
during the early evening, long before the time of the
tragedy."</p>

<p>"But you didn't have the fan with you, then,"
I persisted; "because I remember you went to your room for
it, when you and I were together after our dance."</p>

<p>Miss Gardiner turned perfectly white, and swayed as if about to
faint. Miss Maxwell sprang to her aid, and putting an arm about her
led her from the room.</p>

<p>"I can't have this poor girl tortured, Peter,"
said the gentle old lady, and they went away leaving me to face a
new suspicion that was as unwelcome as it was unexpected.</p>

<a name="ch19"></a><hr><h2><b>XIX<br>
Red Ink Spots</b>
</h2>

<p>I resolved to say nothing more about the fan or the spangles to
any member of the household, but to lay the case before Hunt, when
he came over to the house the next morning.</p>

<p>To my surprise he did not seem at all impressed with the idea of
Miss Gardiner being implicated.</p>

<p>"You let your idea of clues run away with you, Mr.
King," he said. "To be sure the spangles may point in
Miss Gardiner's direction, but she certainly cannot be the
intruder who came in the motor coat and cap. Now, it seems to me if
we're going to look for our man through any clues, we'd
better consider that red ink. When Miss Leslie threw that inkstand,
and so much ink was spilled on the rug, it is extremely probable
that some also spattered on the coat of the assailant."</p>

<p>"Well, it seems to me," I said, "that
that's about the most elusive clue you could think of! We
can't possibly, after all these days, trace a motor coat with
red ink spots on it."</p>

<p>"He might have taken it to a cleaner's," said
Hunt, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Then shall we advertise for a cleaner who has had such a
job recently?"</p>

<p>But my sarcasm was lost upon Hunt. "I doubt if a cleaner
could take out such spots," he went on; "red ink is
almost indelible."</p>

<p>"Well, I have little hope of finding these mythical spots
on a mythical coat belonging to a mythical man!"</p>

<p>"You're wrong there, for certainly the coat and the
man are not mythical. Miss Leslie saw them. Perhaps she can tell us
if the red ink spattered him," said Hunt, hopefully.</p>

<p>"She can't tell us anything at present. The doctor
won't let her be spoken to on this subject. It seems to me,
Hunt, the only thing to do is to call in the police. Of course if
they find the man and the coat, some red ink spots on it would go a
long way toward proving his guilt. But I'm sure that to find
the man will require the skill of the police force, rather than our
ineffectual attempts."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you're right," agreed Hunt,
"but all the same I shall try to find that coat."</p>

<p>Then Tom Whiting and his wife appeared at the library door.</p>

<p>"We want you, Mr. King, if Mr. Hunt will excuse
you," said Edith Whiting, in her pleasant way.</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Mr. Hunt "I am just going
home anyway."</p>

<p>"Have you discovered anything new?" asked Tom
Whiting.</p>

<p>"We hope to do so," said Mr. Hunt. "I think we
are on the right track, though we have not progressed very far, as
yet."</p>

<p>"We want you to go with us for a motor ride, Mr.
King," said Edith Whiting to me. "Tom insists on my
going, and we are taking Irene with us." We started away, but
Hunt called me back to whisper a parting message.</p>

<p>"If you find any strangers in automobile togs," he
said, "observe carefully whether there are any signs of their
having tried to erase red inkspots from the lower fronts of their
coats."</p>

<p>"That's the slimmest kind of a slim chance
yet," I said, almost smiling at the idea, "but I
promise you if I find an automobolist spattered with red ink, I
will arrest him at once."</p>

<p>I found the others ready and waiting for me. It seemed pathetic
to ride away in Philip's big automobile, but, as Tom Whiting
had said, the ladies really needed some fresh air, and he thought
the trip would do us all good.</p>

<p>Mr. Maxwell and Miss Miranda insisted on our going, and so we
started off. Mr. and Mrs. Whiting sat in front, for Tom was quite
as good a chauffeur as Philip had been; and Miss Gardiner and I sat
behind.</p>

<p>As there was ample room for another, Irene proposed that we stop
for Gilbert Crane. This we did, and he seemed glad to accept the
invitation.</p>

<p>It scarcely seemed like the same party who a few days before,
accompanied by Philip, had traveled so merrily over these same
roads.</p>

<p>On our return, Mrs. Whiting asked Mr. Crane to come in to
luncheon with us, and he accepted.</p>

<p>He alighted before I did, and as he stood waiting to help Miss
Gardiner out, the midday sunlight shone full upon him.</p>

<p>I looked at him curiously, thinking what a large, fine-looking
fellow he was physically, and how becoming his fashionable
automobile coat was to him. Its color was a light brownish gray,
and as my eye rested idly upon it, I suddenly noticed something
that made my heart stand still.</p>

<p>On the front of this same coat, on the lower edge, were several
small spots, visible only in the brightest sunlight, which,
whatever they might be, had every appearance of being red ink.</p>

<p>To say I was stunned would pretty well express my feelings, but
I was learning not to show surprise at unexpected developments.</p>

<p>I went into the house with the rest, and finding that Mr. Hunt
had gone, I sent a note to him, by one of the servants, asking him
to return at two o'clock.</p>

<p>He came just as we finished luncheon, and bidding him go in the
library and await me there, I went into Mr. Maxwell's study.
Finding my host there as I had hoped, and not wishing to elevate my
voice, I scribbled on a bit of paper a request that Mr. Maxwell
would ask Mr. Crane to come into his study, and would keep him
there, securely, for twenty minutes at least.</p>

<p>Mr. Maxwell read the paper quietly, handed it back to me, gave
me a quick nod of comprehension, and immediately went in search of
Gilbert Crane.</p>

<p>A moment later, I saw him return with Gilbert Crane. They
entered the study and closed the door, so I knew that the coast was
clear, and that for twenty minutes I need fear no interruption from
them.</p>

<p>Eagerly seizing his coat from the hat-stand where he had flung
it, I hastened to the library.</p>

<p>I found Hunt there, and after closing the door I held up the
coat for his inspection.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say you have found the
man!" he cried.</p>

<p>"I don't know about that," I said, very
soberly, "but I have certainly found a coat that ought to be
looked after. What do you make of this?"</p>

<p>I held the front of the coat toward the window to catch the
bright sunlight, and drew Hunt's attention to the almost
invisible spots on it.</p>

<p>He looked at them in silence a moment, and then said abruptly:
"Get some more blotters."</p>

<p>We dampened the blotters and applied them very carefully, for
the spots were faint, and the surface of the cloth dusty.</p>

<p>But the results showed strong evidence that the stains were
similar to those on the carpet.</p>

<p>"Whose coat is it?" said Hunt, though I think he
knew.</p>

<p>"Gilbert Crane's," I answered, looking
straight at the detective.</p>

<p>"But that does not prove that Gilbert Crane committed the
murder," he responded, looking at me with equal
directness.</p>

<p>"It does not," I said, emphatically,'
"but it is certainly a clue that must lead
somewhere."</p>

<p>"And we must follow it wherever it leads."</p>

<p>"Yes," I assented, "now that we have something
to work on, let us get to work. Shall I call Crane up here, and ask
him if he can explain these spots on his coat? Somehow, I
can't help thinking that he could do so."</p>

<p>"Not yet," said Mr. Hunt. "I think it wiser to
straighten out a few points before we speak to Mr. Crane on the
subject. He is a peculiar man, and I don't want to antagonize
him.</p>

<p>"I would much rather, if you please, that you would
replace the coat where you found it, let Mr. Maxwell know that he
need not detain Mr. Crane any longer, and then bring Miss Gardiner
back here with you for a short consultation."</p>

<p>I followed Mr. Hunt's suggestions to the letter, but it
was with a rapidly sinking heart. Not for a moment did I think
Gilbert Crane a villain, and yet there were many circumstances that
looked dark against him.</p>

<p>I was also disturbed at Mr. Hunt's request for Irene. A
strange foreboding made me fear that some dreadful revelation was
about to take place.</p>

<p>The jury had rendered its verdict of "wilful murder by a
person unknown," and I fervently hoped the criminal might
remain forever unknown rather than that the shadow of guilt might
fall on any one who had been hospitably received at Maxwell
Chimneys.</p>

<p>Still, in the cause of justice, every possibility must be
considered, and I knew that Mr. Hunt would shirk no duty, but would
doggedly follow any clue that presented itself.</p>

<p>I looked in at the study door, and the merest lifting of my
eye-brows was sufficient to inform Mr. Maxwell that a detention of
Gilbert was no longer necessary. I looked at young Crane's
inscrutable face, and was obliged to admit to myself that it was
not a frank countenance in its general effect. But I resolved that
this fact should not be allowed to prejudice me against him.</p>

<p>Finding Mrs. Whiting in the hall, and learning from her that
Miss Gardiner had gone to her own room, I asked her to say to Miss
Gardiner that Mr. Hunt desired to see her in the library. Mrs.
Whiting promised to send Irene there at once, and, greatly dreading
the interview, I returned to the library myself.</p>

<p>I found Hunt making a tabulated statement of certain facts.</p>

<p>"You see, Mr. King," he said, with a very grave
face, "while these things are not positively incriminating,
they are serious questions which need clearing up.</p>

<p>"Granting that the bronze horse was thrown at the intruder
and replaced on the desk before you entered the room that night, we
must allow that it was picked up and replaced by somebody. Miss
Leslie was incapable of this act, the murderer was not likely to do
it.</p>

<p>"Gilbert Crane was the first to find out that the tragedy
had occurred. There is no witness to say what he might or might not
have done in this room. It is possible therefore that he restored
the horse to its place."</p>

<p>"And the inkstand?"</p>

<p>"You remember that Gilbert Crane insisted on spending the
night in this house. Is it not, therefore, conceivable that he
should have waited until every one else had gone home, or retired
to their rooms, and that he should then have come to the library,
found the empty stand, refilled it, and replaced it?"</p>

<p>"But," said I, in utter amazement, "if he did
not commit the crime why should he be so careful about these
details?"</p>

<p>"I am not sure," said Mr. Hunt in a low voice,
"that he did not commit the crime."</p>

<a name="ch20"></a><hr><h2><b>XX<br>
Irene Tells The Truth</b>
</h2>

<p>Although horrified and even indignant at Mr. Hunt's
assertion, I could not fail to be impressed by his arguments. I was
still bewildered at the possibilities he suggested, when a tap was
heard at the library door. Mr. Hunt rose quietly and admitted Miss
Gardiner.</p>

<p>The girl looked haggard and worn. Her brilliant coloring seemed
faded, and her whole attitude betrayed deep distress not unmixed
with fear.</p>

<p>But all of this she tried to hide beneath a mask of impassivity.
I think she impressed Hunt with her appearance of calmness, though
I felt sure that her turbulent spirit was far from placid.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Miss Gardiner," said Hunt kindly.
"I wish to ask you a few questions."</p>

<p>Irene sat down, and with an air both haughty and dignified
awaited the detective's next words. Had it not been for her
restless, troubled eyes, she would have deceived me into thinking
her assumed indifference real.</p>

<p>"In your testimony, Miss Gardiner," began Mr. Hunt,
"you declared that you did not leave the spot where you were
sitting, on the east end of the balcony, the night of the murder,
until you came into the house at about half past ten. Are you still
prepared to swear to this statement?"</p>

<p>"Why should I not be, Mr. Hunt?" said Irene, but her
lips grew white, and her voice trembled.</p>

<p>"You might have since recollected that you did go around
to the west side, if only for a moment."</p>

<p>"I have no recollections that cause me to change my sworn
statement in any way," declared Irene.</p>

<p>Her voice had sunk almost to a whisper and her eyes refused to
meet mine.</p>

<p>Mr. Hunt continued:</p>

<p>"Were you around on the west side, near the library
window, at any time during the evening&mdash;earlier, perhaps,
than the time you spent sitting alone on the east side?"</p>

<p>"No," said Irene, and this time her voice was
stronger and her whole air more decided, as she looked the
detective straight in the eye. "I was not on the west balcony
earlier in the evening. I was not there at all!"</p>

<p>The last sentence came with a desperate burst of emphasis, that
somehow did not carry conviction. For some reason the girl was
under a severe tension, and I couldn't help thinking there
was danger of her physical collapse.</p>

<p>"Then," said Mr. Hunt, suddenly producing the black
spangles&mdash;"then may I ask, Miss Gardiner, how these
chanced to be found in the library, and on the library
window-shutter?"</p>

<p>Irene Gardiner gave a low cry, and hiding her face in her hands,
seemed in immediate danger of the collapse I had feared.</p>

<p>"Miss Gardiner," I said, for though her actions were
inexplicable, I was still deeply under the spell of her
fascination, and greatly desired to help her&mdash;"Miss
Gardiner, let me advise you, as a friend, to tell your story
frankly and truthfully. I am sure it will be better for all
concerned."</p>

<p>Raising her head, Irene Gardiner flashed a look at me so full of
faith and gratitude, that, assured of her complete innocence, I
determined to become her strong ally.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she exclaimed, "I would be so glad to
tell the truth! I swore to a falsehood from a sense of duty to
another."</p>

<p>"It is always a mistaken sense of duty that leads to false
swearing," said Mr. Hunt.</p>

<p>"I believe that is so," said Irene earnestly,
"but I had no one to advise me and I thought I was doing
right. The truth is, then, that I did go around to the west end of
the balcony, and that I did look in at the library
window."</p>

<p>"At what time was this?" asked Mr. Hunt.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Irene, "but it was
just before Mr. Judson came, and about ten minutes later Mr. King
came to me on the front balcony, and told me what had
happened."</p>

<p>"What did you see in the library?" asked Mr.
Hunt.</p>

<p>"Must I tell that?"</p>

<p>"You must."</p>

<p>"Then I saw Philip lying on the floor, and Mildred fallen
to the floor also. But she was partly hidden by the
desk."</p>

<p>"Is that all you saw?" asked Mr. Hunt, looking at
her intently. "Was there no one else in the room?"</p>

<p>"Must I tell that?" asked Irene again, with an
appealing glance at me.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Hunt sternly, "much may depend
on your telling the absolute truth."</p>

<p>"Then," said Irene, "I saw Mr. Crane placing a
pistol in Mildred's hand."</p>

<p>"Wait," said I, "was this occurring just as
you arrived at the window?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then," I went on, "you cannot swear that he
was placing the pistol in her hand. He might have been taking it
away from her, or attempting to do so."</p>

<p>"I never thought of that," said Irene, an expression
of relief lighting up her face.</p>

<p>"Even so," said Mr. Hunt, "he should have told
of the incident in his own testimony. What did you do next, Miss
Gardiner?"</p>

<p>"I went away at once. I went to the east side of the
veranda. I was so mystified and horrified by what I had just seen
that I flung myself into a chair and cried. I was still crying
when, soon after, Mr. Judson came in search of me. And I was still
crying when Mr. King came later to tell me what had
happened."</p>

<p>"She was," I said, "and crying so violently
that I was alarmed. But as Miss Maxwell appeared almost
immediately, I left the two ladies to look after each
other."</p>

<p>"And had it not been for the incriminating spangles, did
you not intend to correct your misstatement?" said Mr. Hunt,
looking at her severely.</p>

<p>"No," said Irene, and her manner now was frank and
self-assured, "for I felt sure Mr. Crane had done nothing
wrong, and I did not wish to attract any unfounded suspicions
toward him."</p>

<p>"A suspicion that is really unfounded can do no one any
harm," said Mr. Hunt, who seemed to be in a mood for oracular
utterances.</p>

<p>"I am glad," said Irene simply, "for I would
not wish any harm to come to Mr. Crane through my
testimony."</p>

<p>"That is as it may be," said Mr. Hunt, and the
interview was at an end.</p>

<p>Although Irene's evidence had placed Gilbert in a doubtful
position, I was not yet willing to believe the man guilty, or even
that he was implicated in the crime.</p>

<p>Indeed, I was for going straight to him, and asking him for the
explanation which I felt sure he could give.</p>

<p>But Mr. Hunt did not agree with me. He was in the grasp of a new
theory, and therefore subject to the temptation which too often
assails a detective, to make the facts coincide with it.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "don't let us go ahead
too rapidly. Let us formulate a definite proposition, and then see
if we are warranted in assuming it to be a true one. In the first
place, whoever killed Philip Maxwell must have had a strong
personal motive for the deed.</p>

<p>"There is no reason to suspect an ordinary burglar, for
there is nothing whatever to indicate burglary in the whole affair.
If Philip Maxwell had any personal enemies, the fact is not known
to us. Even his uncle is unaware of the existence of any such.</p>

<p>"The only man we know of who might have had an ill-feeling
toward Philip Maxwell&mdash;mind, I say, might have had&mdash;is
Gilbert Crane. We know that an antagonism existed between the two
men on account of Miss Leslie. While it would not seem to us that
this antagonism was sufficient to develop a crime, yet parallel
cases are not unknown. Gilbert Crane is a man of deep passions,
fiery temper, and uncontrollable impulses.</p>

<p>"He is erratic, eccentric, and, while I do not wish to
judge him too harshly, I must admit he seems to be of the stuff of
which villains are made."</p>

<p>"But none of this is definitely incriminating," I
said, appalled at the sudden directness of Hunt's attack.</p>

<p>"No," he replied, "and that is why I'm
not willing to proceed as if it were, or as if I so considered
it."</p>

<p>"It is absurd anyway," I said almost angrily,
"for you know that he was in the billiard-room at exactly ten
o'clock. I saw him there myself. And according to Miss
Maxwell, the shots were fired at ten o'clock."</p>

<p>"Yes, according to Miss Maxwell. But it has occurred to me
that hers is the only evidence that the shots were fired at ten
o'clock, and we are by no means certain that her clock or
watch was exactly right."</p>

<p>"The clock in the study was right," I said doggedly,
"it always is. Mr. Maxwell is very particular about
that."</p>

<p>"Yes, but ladies are not apt to be so exact with their
timepieces. At any rate, I shall make it my business to find
out."</p>

<p>"Let us find out now," I said eagerly. "If
there is anything in this horrible theory I want to know it at
once."</p>

<p>"Go yourself," said Hunt "Go at once, and ask
Miss Maxwell as to the accuracy of her clock." I found Miss
Maxwell alone, and I asked her in a casual manner how she knew it
was ten o'clock when she heard, or thought she heard, the two
pistol shots.</p>

<p>"It was ten by the little clock on my
dressing-table," she replied. "I am sure of that, for
it was striking at the time I heard the reports."</p>

<p>"And is that clock always right?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No," she said; "in fact, it is almost never
right. For some time I have been intending to have it
regulated."</p>

<p>"Is it slow or fast?" I asked, trying to preserve my
casual manner.</p>

<p>"It runs slow," she said, "and that night it
must have been as much as ten minutes slow, because I remember I
was late for dinner, though I thought I was in ample
time."</p>

<p>"You should have stated this discrepancy sooner, Miss
Maxwell," I said, unable to keep a note of grave concern out
of my voice.</p>

<p>"Why," she returned, in astonishment. "I had
no idea that would make any difference. In fact, I didn't
think anything about it. How can it make any difference?"</p>

<p>"Never mind, Miss Maxwell," I said soothingly,
"perhaps it won't make any difference. Don't give
it any further thought. You have quite enough trouble as it
is."</p>

<p>"Oh, I have indeed!" said the dear old lady.
"I don't know what I shall do, Mr. King. Philip's
death has affected my brother terribly. He was always a quiet man,
but now he is so crushed and heart-broken that he is more silent
than ever.</p>

<p>"And I can't seem to comfort him. I think we will
have to go away from Maxwell Chimneys. We have a sister out West,
and I think we will go out there. I am sure that entire and
permanent change of scene is the only thing that will help
Alexander at all."</p>

<p>I looked admiringly at the dear lady whose unselfish spirit
thought of her brother's comfort, ignoring her own sorrow,
and assuring her of my sincere sympathy and my assistance in every
possible way, I returned to Hunt.</p>

<p>"I am not surprised," he said, when I told him that
Miss Maxwell's clock had undoubtedly been ten minutes slow on
Monday evening. "It is alarming, the way the links fit into
the chain of evidence, but it must be more than mere
coincidence.</p>

<p>"Look at it in this way for a moment&mdash;supposing, for
the sake of argument, that events proceeded like this:</p>

<p>"You saw Gilbert Crane in the billiard-room at ten
o'clock. This you are sure of. Now according to Crane's
own statement he looked into Mr. Maxwell's study some twenty
minutes later. But we have no other witness for this.</p>

<p>"Mr. Maxwell says he neither heard nor saw him, and Crane
himself admits that he did not. With the exception of Miss Gardiner
on the balcony, the guests were all in the music-room, not only
absorbed in their music, but making a great deal of noise.</p>

<p>"Miss Maxwell was in her own bedroom, and the servants
were busy in the kitchens, of which the doors were closed. As
nearly as I can find out, Gilbert Crane came running down-stairs
for Dr. Sheldon a few moments before half past ten. If you have
followed my reasoning, you will see that his whereabouts between
ten o'clock and, say, ten twenty-five, are unaccounted for
except by himself.</p>

<p>"His coat&mdash;the automobile coat on which we have
discovered the red spots&mdash;hung on the hat-stand in the back
part of the hall. He, therefore, had ample opportunity to leave the
billiard-room, put on his coat and the cap and goggles which he
always carries in that coat pocket, go up the back staircase, and
through the hall window at the head of that staircase out on to the
west balcony.</p>

<p>"The library window is directly next to the hall window.
He had therefore, I say, both time and opportunity to fire the
shots at about ten minutes after ten, which would accord with Miss
Maxwell's inaccurate testimony. He had also time and
opportunity to return down-stairs the way he came, restore his coat
to its place on the hat-stand, and go back to the
billiard-room.</p>

<p>"This yet left sufficient time for him to go up-stairs
again&mdash;the front stairs this time&mdash;in full view of the
people in the music-room if they chanced to look, and return to
make his startling announcement to Dr. Sheldon."</p>

<p>I had followed Hunt's words with such intense interest
that I seemed to be living through the successive scenes myself. As
he paused, I remarked thoughtfully:</p>

<p>"And that would explain why Philip cried out, 'Oh,
to think that <i>he</i> should shoot me!'"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Hunt gravely, "it explains a great
many things. It explains of course the spots on his
coat&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait," I cried eagerly, "when the ink
spattered on his coat it must also have fallen on his shoes and the
bottoms of his trousers."</p>

<p>"Not necessarily on his trousers," said Hunt,
"for the coat is long and large, and would probably entirely
protect them. As to his shoes, they have doubtless been blackened
since, and so all trace would be lost."</p>

<p>"As a chain of circumstantial evidence it is certainly
complete," I said, with a sigh. "But all my intuitions
cry out against its being the truth."</p>

<p>"Have you any other theory to offer?"</p>

<p>"Not the shadow of one. I only wish I had. But stay. What
do you make of Miss Gardiner's assertion that she saw Gilbert
placing a pistol in Miss Leslie's hand?"</p>

<p>"I think she is mistaken as to what he was doing. I think
Miss Leslie's story is true in every detail. Possibly Mr.
Crane endeavored to take the pistol out of her hand, then, changing
his mind for some reason, concluded not to do so."</p>

<p>I sat staring at Mr. Hunt, almost stunned by his convincing
arguments.</p>

<p>"What will be your next move?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I shall submit this report to Inspector Davis, and he
must do whatever he thinks best."</p>

<a name="ch21"></a><hr><h2><b>XXI<br>
Circumstantial Evidence</b>
</h2>

<p>Further investigation only served to strengthen the case against
Gilbert Crane. It was discovered that he owned a thirty-eight
caliber pistol. When found, this pistol was properly cleaned and
loaded. It was not rusty, and had every appearance of having been
used recently, but how recently who could say?</p>

<p>To my mind the fact that Gilbert possessed a thirty-eight
caliber pistol was not a vital bit of evidence. Anybody might
possess one.</p>

<p>But as Hunt said, it was not contradictory evidence, and, taken
in conjunction with the other clues, it was of importance.</p>

<p>It seemed, also, to the authorities, that the motive imputed to
Gilbert Crane was a strong one, and among those which most often
lead to crime.</p>

<p>And so, Gilbert was arrested and held for trial.</p>

<p>Though everybody at Maxwell Chimneys was shocked and astounded
at the news of his arrest, it affected them in different ways.</p>

<p>Mildred Leslie was frantic with grief and indignation. She
declared that although the intruder might have worn Gilbert's
coat, it was positively not Gilbert Crane himself. She vowed she
would know Gilbert in any circumstances and in any disguise, and
she was sure the man who shot her was a man with whom she was
unacquainted, though he was apparently well known to Philip
Maxwell.</p>

<p>She grew so excited as to become hysterical, and the doctor
ordered that she should again be remanded to absolute seclusion,
and allowed to see no one save the nurse and her sister.</p>

<p>Irene Gardiner seemed uncertain as to the justice of the arrest
She viewed the whole matter from a stern, judicial standpoint, and
seemed unable to take a personal view of it. I felt sure that she
had never liked Mr. Crane, and, feeling equally sure that Mildred
was very much in love with him, I could easily understand the
different attitudes of the two girls.</p>

<p>I was conscious myself of a growing regard for Irene, and while
I could wish her a little softer and more sympathetic toward the
prisoner, yet I couldn't help admiring her splendid
appreciation of law and justice.</p>

<p>As for the Maxwells, Miss Miranda was so completely crushed
already, that another unexpected blow could make but little
difference in her demeanor. She said she could not believe Gilbert
guilty, but that it was not for her to judge.</p>

<p>Alexander Maxwell showed a like philosophical spirit. After the
first shock of surprise, he admitted that justice must have its
way, wherever that way might lead; but he again begged us not to be
misled by false or incomplete clues, and to prove beyond all doubt
whatever we accepted as a fact.</p>

<p>I fully shared the old gentleman's spirit of caution, and
kept a vigilant watch on Mr. Hunt's proceedings. But I was
forced to admit the evidence all pointed one way, and my only hope
lay in the fact that it was purely circumstantial evidence.</p>

<p>Resolved, if possible, to find some weak spot in Hunt's
diagnosis of the case, I obtained permission to visit Gilbert Crane
in his cell.</p>

<p>I felt a certain embarrassment as I entered, for I expected to
see a despairing, broken-down man.</p>

<p>But I found I did not yet know Gilbert Crane. Instead of
appearing dejected, he rose to greet me with an expectant look, and
held out his hand.</p>

<p>"Will you take it?" he said impulsively, and
eagerly. "You need not hesitate. It is the hand of an honest
man. I am no more guilty of Philip's death than is Philip
himself."</p>

<p>Quite aside from his words, there was honor and truth in the
sound of his voice, and the look of his eye. I am very sensitive to
deceit, and in every fibre of my being I felt at that moment that
an honest man stood before me.</p>

<p>Acting in accordance with this conviction I grasped his hand
heartily, and said:</p>

<p>"I am sure of it! I admit, and you must admit yourself,
that the circumstantial evidence against you is pretty bad. But
even before your denial I could not think you guilty, and now you
have removed any lurking doubt I may have had."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Crane simply. "And now I
wonder if you can help me."</p>

<p>"It is what I want to do," I said, "but I fear
I can do little. I have tried to get at some counterevidence, or
refutation of Hunt's theories, but so far I have been unable
to do so."</p>

<p>"That's just the point," said Gilbert, in a
practical way that seemed to show me a new side of this man.
"I don't know myself what to tell you to do. The whole
situation is so absurd. To me it is like lightning out of a clear
sky.</p>

<p>"Here am I, arrested for the murder of a man' who
was one of my best friends. I didn't murder him, and yet
circumstances are such that I cannot prove I did not."</p>

<p>"Since we are speaking frankly," I said, "will
you tell me if you touched the pistol that Miss Leslie
held?"</p>

<p>Gilbert looked at me gravely. "I will," he said.
"I ought to have been more straightforward about that, but I
didn't mention it, because I thought it of absolutely no
importance.</p>

<p>"When I saw the bodies, I thought that Philip was dead,
but that Miss Leslie was still living. I went nearer to look, and
on an impulse I started to take the pistol from her hand. But I at
once realized that it would be better to call Dr. Sheldon before I
touched anything, and I did so."</p>

<p>"You didn't pause to pick up the bronze
horse?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Certainly not," was the surprised reply.</p>

<p>"That horse and inkstand play a most mysterious part in
the matter. But there must be some explanation for them, and we
must find it."</p>

<p>"It will be made clear," said Gilbert, "if you
do what I ask."</p>

<p>"I am more than willing to do your bidding," I
said.</p>

<p>"Then send for Stone. He is a New York detective, and
though I do not know him personally, I know enough about him to
feel sure he can unravel this tangle as no one else can."</p>

<p>"How shall I find him?"</p>

<p>"I don't know his address. You will have to go or
write to Jack Hemingway; he can tell you. Stone will be expensive,
but this is no time for economy. Will you get him?"</p>

<p>"I certainly will," I replied, "and do all in
my power to help him."</p>

<p>"Fleming Stone won't need much help," said
Gilbert, not ungratefully, but decidedly, "he is a wizard. He
can see right through anybody or anything."</p>

<p>"Then he is the man for us, and I'll go for him
myself."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Crane, after a moment's
thought, "it would be wiser not to let it be generally known
that he is a celebrated detective."</p>

<p>"All right," I replied; "but the Maxwells will
have to know it, because I want to put him up there. They'll
be willing, I know. Indeed, Mr. Maxwell has himself suggested that
we should get a city detective down."</p>

<p>"I know it," said Gilbert, "but I wish
you'd act as if he were just a friend of yours who has a
taste for detective work."</p>

<p>"Very well, I'll fix it that way then. But I hate to
have you staying here, even for a few days."</p>

<p>"That can't be helped," said Gilbert,
"and mustn't be considered. If you can only get Fleming
Stone to come down here, I am as good as released."</p>

<p>Glad that he could view the situation in this cheerful manner, I
went away, prepared to go at once on Gilbert's errand.</p>

<p>Miss Maxwell hospitably agreed to my proposal to burden her home
with another visitor, but Mr. Maxwell did not seem quite
pleased.</p>

<p>I couldn't help wondering if he thought that a more astute
detective would only succeed in proving Gilbert's guilt more
conclusively. He expressed himself as thinking it wise to let well
enough alone, but as he made no definite protest against my going,
I went to New York that very day in search of Fleming Stone.</p>

<p>I found him, and after some persuasion, I induced him to return
to Hamilton with me in the interests of Gilbert Crane.</p>

<p>Never shall I forget the delight of my first long conversation
with Fleming Stone.</p>

<p>As to personal appearance, he was a fine-looking man without
being in any way remarkably handsome. He was large and well-formed,
between forty and fifty years old, with iron-gray hair and a clear,
healthy complexion.</p>

<p>His eyes were his chief charm and their attraction lay largely
in their expression, and in their surrounding dark lashes and
brows. Mr. Stone had a kindly smile, and his face in repose seemed
to denote an even temper and a gracious disposition. He was
possessed of great personal magnetism, and the liking which I felt
for him the first moment I saw him, grew rapidly into
admiration.</p>

<p>On the way down, at his request, I told him everything I knew
about the Maxwell mystery. He was intensely interested; and I was
secretly filled with joy when he expressed a decided approval of
the methods I had used in discovering the red ink.</p>

<p>After I had told him every detail of the story, he changed the
subject courteously, but very decidedly, and talked of other
matters.</p>

<p>He was a brilliant conversationalist, which surprised me, for my
mental picture of a great detective had always represented a most
taciturn gentleman of sinister aspect.</p>

<p>When we reached Maxwell Chimneys it was nearly dinner time.</p>

<p>At the dinner table, Mr. Stone gave no hint of his profession
either in manner or appearance. He was simply a well-bred,
well-dressed gentleman, with irreproachable manners and a talent
for interesting conversation.</p>

<p>I noticed that Mr. Maxwell looked at him with occasional furtive
glances, and seemed to be mentally weighing the man's
professional ability. Either he was satisfied with the result of
his scrutiny, or the charm of Mr. Stone appealed to him, for he
distinctly showed a liking for his new guest before the close of
the meal.</p>

<p>As Mildred Leslie was not yet allowed to leave her room, the
Whitings and Miss Gardiner made up the rest of the dinner guests.
Edith Whiting and her husband were always to be depended on for a
correct demeanor of any sort that the situation might require, but
I was anxious to see what attitude Irene would assume toward the
newcomer.</p>

<p>To my surprise she showed an intense interest in him. She seemed
fairly eager lest she lose one word of his conversation, and her
brilliant cheeks and shining eyes proved her vivid enjoyment of the
occasion.</p>

<p>After dinner there was music. In addition to his other talents,
Mr. Stone was a musician, and though he declined to play for us
that night, he seemed thoroughly to enjoy the music we made for
him.</p>

<p>Though quite content to leave matters in his hands, I
couldn't help wondering when he intended to begin his
detective work. But almost as if in answer to my thought, Mr. Stone
remarked that if it met with the approval of them all, he would ask
for a short but absolutely private interview with each one.</p>

<p>"I assume there are no secrets among us," he said,
in his winning way, "and as I understand the situation, from
what Mr. King has told me, I think we are all earnestly anxious to
discover the person who took the life of Philip Maxwell."</p>

<p>This was said gravely, almost solemnly, and for a moment no one
spoke.</p>

<p>Then Miss Maxwell said, in her gentle voice, "I trust I am
not too revengeful in spirit, but I own I would be glad to see the
slayer of my boy brought to justice."</p>

<p>Fleming Stone seemed to consider this an authority to proceed in
his own way. Asking Miss Maxwell to go with him to the study, he
escorted her from the room with an air of courtly grace that sat
well upon him.</p>

<p>After not more than ten minutes, Mr. Stone brought her back, and
asked that he might next have a few words with Mr. Maxwell. When
the two men had gone, Miss Maxwell gave voice to her admiration of
her new guest and declared that she had never seen any one who gave
her such favorable first impressions. We all agreed with her, and
were enthusiastic in our praise of Fleming Stone as a man, whatever
he might prove to be as a detective.</p>

<p>When Mr. Maxwell's short interview was finished, the
others were taken in turn, and I was somewhat surprised to notice
that Mr. Stone detained Tom Whiting far longer than any of the
rest.</p>

<p>When he finally rejoined the group in the music-room, Fleming
Stone said:</p>

<p>"These preliminary and perhaps not entirely necessary
formalities are now over; and I think I have learned all that I
need to know from you who are here. I can, of course, do nothing
more tonight. To-morrow I must ask for a short talk with Miss
Leslie, and after that I will see Mr. Crane."</p>

<p>But later that evening, Fleming Stone and I had a short
conference in the library. I showed him the horse and the inkstand;
described the exact position of Philip and Mildred when they were
found; showed him where the black spangles were discovered; and
pointed out how the balcony floor had been marked by signs of an
apparent scuffle.</p>

<p>Mr. Stone showed an unexpected interest in this last-named clue,
though I confess it had seemed to me the least important of any.
The balcony had since been swept, but there were still visible
slight scratches in the long, sweeping marks I have described.</p>

<p>"I do not deduce from these scratches that there was a
scuffle," said Mr. Stone. "That is, not in the sense of
there having been a struggle between two persons. I see no reason
for thinking that these marks were made by more than one pair of
feet."</p>

<p>"Mr. Stone," I said, almost timidly, "perhaps
I have no right to ask, but have your suspicions fallen in any
direction as yet?"</p>

<p>Fleming Stone looked at me with an expression of sorrow in his
deep gray eyes.</p>

<p>"I will tell you," he said, "for I know you
will not betray my confidence, that I am positively certain who the
criminal is; that it is not Gilbert Crane; and that it is a person
upon whom I can lay my hand at any moment."</p>

<a name="ch22"></a><hr><h2><b>XXII<br>
Fleming Stone's Discoveries</b>
</h2>

<p>The next morning, although Fleming Stone was the same affable,
courteous gentleman that he had been the night before, yet there
was a shade more of seriousness in his manner. He spoke cheerfully,
but it seemed to be with an effort, and I felt a vague sense of an
impending disaster which might be worse than anything that had gone
before.</p>

<p>After breakfast, Mr. Hunt came over and in the fateful library
he was introduced to Fleming Stone.</p>

<p>I was present at their interview, and I was glad to see that the
two men at once assumed cordial attitudes, and seemed prepared to
work together harmoniously.</p>

<p>I think Hunt may have felt a natural professional jealousy of
the city detective, but if so he showed no trace of it. Besides,
Mr. Hunt was quite at the end of his resources&mdash;completely
baffled by the case. If Gilbert Crane were not the guilty man,
neither our local detective nor I myself knew where to look for the
criminal.</p>

<p>Our discussion in the library did not last long, but it was
exceedingly business-like and to the point. Without losing a shade
of his graceful politeness.</p>

<p>Fleming Stone showed also the quick working of his direct,
forceful mind. He approved of all that Hunt and I had done. In a
few words he commended our methods and accepted our results.</p>

<p>Then in silence he scrutinized the library. I think nothing in
the room escaped the swift, thorough glances of those dark eyes. He
rose to examine the rug, and the window casing, and then stepped
out on the balcony to look at the scratches of which I had told
him. These latter were very faint, but with a large magnifying
glass which he took from his pocket he examined them carefully and
seemed satisfied with what he found.</p>

<p>Returning to the library, he took the waste-paper basket from
under the desk and examined its contents. It was empty save for a
few scraps of torn paper which I had thrown there myself the day
before, but I saw his action with a sudden shock of dismay.</p>

<p>Neither Hunt nor I had thought of looking in the waste-basket,
and though I had no definite hope of anything to be found there, it
was a chance we ought not to have lost.</p>

<p>"Did Mr. Philip Maxwell ever write letters in this
room?" asked Mr. Stone.</p>

<p>"Sometimes he did," I replied, "but more often
he wrote down in his uncle's study."</p>

<p>"But he might have opened letters and read them
here?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he used this desk a great deal."</p>

<p>"Where are the papers from the waste-baskets
thrown?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, Mr. Stone; but the servants can tell
you. Shall I call the maid who attends to the cleaning of this
room?"</p>

<p>"I wish you would do so; then we will consider this
consultation at an end. I have no wish to be unduly secret about my
plans, but I must work uninterruptedly to-day, for I think
developments will come thick and fast."</p>

<p>Mr. Hunt and I left the library, and I at once sent the maid to
Mr. Stone as he had requested.</p>

<p>Less than fifteen minutes later, I saw him coming up from the
cellar.</p>

<p>Seeing that I was alone, he said:</p>

<p>"I found a paper that is a most important link in our
chain. Will you look at it a moment?"</p>

<p>He drew from his pocket a paper which had evidently been
smoothed out after being much crumpled, and turned down the top of
the sheet so that I did not see the address. "That is Mr.
Philip Maxwell's handwriting, is it not?" he said.</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied, and in Phil's well-known
characters I read:</p>

<p class="quote">At last I have discovered the truth, and it has
broken my heart. Even now I could not believe it, but
your&mdash;</p>

<p>The writing stopped abruptly, and the letter had evidently been
thrown aside unfinished. I restrained my intense curiosity, and did
not ask to see the name at the head of the letter, but apparently
Fleming Stone divined my thoughts.</p>

<p>"You will know only too soon," he said with that sad
note in his voice that always thrilled me. "Now I am going to
see Miss Leslie."</p>

<p>The doctor had permitted a short interview, and I learned
afterward from Edith Whiting, that though Mildred had dreaded it,
she was at once put at her ease by Mr. Stone's gentleness,
and gave a brief but coherent account of the affair.</p>

<p>It was shortly before noon that I went for a walk with Irene
Gardiner. As we went away, I saw Mr. Stone and Miss Miranda Maxwell
in the music-room. Miss Maxwell was knitting some fleecy white-wool
thing, and though she looked sad she was calm and unexcited. They
seemed to be chatting cosily, and yet I felt sure that Fleming
Stone was learning some details about Philip's life or
character which he considered important.</p>

<p>I sighed to think that the net was certainly closing in around
somebody, and the amazing part was that I had not the remotest idea
toward whom Fleming Stone's suspicions were directed.</p>

<p>Miss Gardiner and I walked down the path to the river. As was
inevitable, we talked only of the all-absorbing topic, and
especially of Fleming Stone.</p>

<p>"Isn't he wonderful?" she exclaimed. "He
is certainly the ideal detective."</p>

<p>"He is in his methods and his intellect," I said,
"but his personal appearance is far from my preconceived
notions of the regulation detective. I had always imagined them
grim and sinister. This man is not only affable but positively
sunny."</p>

<p>"He is fascinating!" declared Irene. "I have
never met any one who seemed so attractive at first
sight."</p>

<p>I quite agreed with her, but I was suddenly conscious of an
absurd pang of jealousy. I was beginning to think that Irene
Gardiner was pretty nearly necessary to the happiness of my life,
and this avowed interest of hers in another man spurred me to a
sudden conclusion that I cared for her very much indeed.</p>

<p>But this was no time or place to tell her so. At the
Maxwells' invitation she had decided to remain at Maxwell
Chimneys with the Whitings until Mildred was able to travel to New
York. Dr. Sheldon had said that the journey might safely be taken
about the middle of the following week. I had made my plans to go
at the same time, but in view of the rapid developments of the past
two days I had unmade those plans and had made no others.</p>

<p>"Doesn't it seem strange," said Irene,
"that you and I were talking about crime and criminals on the
way down here last week? How little we thought that we were coming
straight to a tragedy."</p>

<p>"It is a tragedy," I said, "and it may prove
even more of a one than we yet know. Irene, if Gilbert didn't
shoot Philip, have you any idea who did?"</p>

<p>"No," she said, looking at me with a candor in her
eyes which left no room for doubt. "No, I have not the
faintest idea. And yet I cannot believe Gilbert did it. I never
liked him, but he does not seem to me capable of crime."</p>

<p>"And yet you hold the theory that, given an opportunity,
we are all capable of crime."</p>

<p>"I know I said that," said Irene thoughtfully.
"And it does seem true in theory, but it is hard to believe
it in an individual case."</p>

<p>"I am sure Gilbert was not the criminal," I said,
"but my certainty is based on something quite apart from the
question of his capability in the way of committing crime.</p>

<p>"First, I was convinced of his innocence by his own
attitude. A simple assertion might be false, but Gilbert's
look and voice and manner told far more than his words. No criminal
could have acted as he did.</p>

<p>"Even his scornful indifference to the fact of his arrest
carried conviction of his innocence. But aside from all that,
Fleming Stone says he knows that Gilbert is not guilty, and
moreover he knows who is."</p>

<p>"He knows who is!" exclaimed Irene. "Who can
it be?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; but I am sure from what Mr. Stone
says it is some one whom we all know, and whose conviction will not
only surprise but sadden us."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose," said Irene slowly, her great eyes
wide with horror, "that it could have been Mildred after
all?"</p>

<p>So this strange girl had dared to put into words a thought which
I had tried hard to keep out of my mind.</p>

<p>"Don't!" said I, "I cannot think of
it!"</p>

<p>"But her whole story about the intruder may have been a
fabrication."</p>

<p>"Don't," I said again, "such remarks are
unworthy of you&mdash;are unworthy of any woman."</p>

<p>"You always misunderstand me," said Irene
impatiently. "I don't mean it the way you think I do.
If I could see Mildred myself, I would talk to her in the same way.
There is no harm in asking a frank question."</p>

<p>"Then," I said abruptly. "I will ask you one.
What did you mean last Monday night when you told me that if I
wouldn't interfere between Philip and Mildred you would take
matters into your own hands?"</p>

<p>"I am not at all offended by your question," said
Irene, looking me straight in the eyes, "neither do I assume
that, because you ask it, you think that I meant anything
desperate. I meant only what I said&mdash;that if you
wouldn't advise Philip Maxwell not to be infatuated by such a
foolish, artful little coquette as Mildred Leslie, then I would
warn him myself."</p>

<p>"Since we are speaking frankly, I must admit that it would
seem to me unwarranted interference on your part."</p>

<p>"I suppose I am peculiar," said Irene with a sigh,
"but it doesn't seem that way to me. However, this is a
question capable of much discussion. Suppose we leave its
consideration for some other time, and return to the house
now."</p>

<p>We walked back, chatting in a lighter vein, and somehow my heart
sank when I saw Fleming Stone sitting alone on the veranda. It may
have been imagination, or perhaps intuition, but as soon as I saw
him, I felt a conviction that he had accomplished his work, and
that we would soon know the result.</p>

<p>"I've been waiting for you," he said, as I
went toward him. Irene went into the house, and Mr. Stone
continued. "I have discovered everything, and I want you to
be prepared for a sad revelation."</p>

<p>"Did you learn anything from your interview with Miss
Leslie?" I asked impulsively.</p>

<p>"Nothing more than I knew before I saw her," he
replied, and his inscrutable face gave me no glimmer of
information.</p>

<p>"It is almost one o'clock," he went on,
"and after luncheon I will tell you all. I have asked Mr.
Hunt to be present, and you will both please meet me in the library
at two o'clock."</p>

<p>Somehow the sad foreboding that had taken possession of me made
me glad of even an hour's further respite. I went to the
luncheon table and made my bravest endeavor to seem my natural
self. But a depressing cloud seemed to hang over us all.</p>

<p>Although each one tried to be cheerful, the efforts were far
from being entirely successful. Even Mr. Maxwell seemed disturbed.
Indeed, Miss Miranda was most placid of all, and I felt sure that
was due to the calming effect of Mr. Stone's kindly
consideration for her.</p>

<p>At last the meal was over, and, unable to keep up the strain any
longer I went at once to the library, and awaited the others.</p>

<p>Mr. Hunt came first.</p>

<p>"Have you any idea of the disclosure Mr. Stone is about to
make?" he said to me.</p>

<p>"No," said I, "I think I can truthfully say I
haven't."</p>

<p>"He has asked Dr. Sheldon to be here by half past
two," said Hunt.</p>

<p>Again my thoughts flew to Mildred Leslie, but I said
nothing.</p>

<p>Then Fleming Stone came into the room. There was sadness still
in his eyes, but he had again assumed that alert, official air
which characterized his professional moments.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," he said, "I came down here, as
you know, an absolute stranger and entirely unprejudiced. I have
listened to various accounts of the crime; I have weighed the
evidence offered to me; I have made investigations on my own
account and drawn my own deductions.</p>

<p>"I have considered the character and dispositions of all
persons known to be in the vicinity of Philip Maxwell at the time
of his death; have pondered over the possible motive for the crime;
and, from the facts learned as a result of my investigation and
consideration, I have discovered the murderer.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, Philip Maxwell was shot by his uncle, Mr.
Alexander Maxwell!"</p>

<a name="ch23"></a><hr><h2><b>XXIII<br>
The Confession</b>
</h2>

<p>There was nothing to be said. I was silent, because I felt as if
the earth had suddenly given way beneath me, and all was chaos. Not
for a moment did I doubt Fleming Stone's statement, for his
words compelled conviction.</p>

<p>But in the confused mass of sudden thoughts that surged through
my brain, I seemed to see clearly nothing but Miss Miranda's
placid face, and I cried out involuntarily:</p>

<p>"Don't let his sister know!"</p>

<p>Hunt sat like a man stunned. His expression was positively
vacant, and I think he was trying to realize what Mr. Stone's
announcement meant.</p>

<p>"It is terrible, I know," said Fleming Stone,
"and I quite appreciate the shock it must be to you. But
inexorable justice demands that we proceed without faltering.</p>

<p>"I think that, without telling you of the various steps
which led me to this conclusion, I can best prove to you that it is
the true one by asking you to go with me while I lay the facts
before Mr. Maxwell. I think his reception of what I have to say,
and the visible effect of my accusations upon him, will prove to
you beyond any possible doubt his connection with the crime.
Indeed, from what I know of the man I am disposed to think he will
make full confession of his guilt."</p>

<p>Fleming Stone's words sounded to me like a voice heard in
a dream; and even my own voice sounded strange and unreal, as I
murmured: "It will kill him. He has heart disease."</p>

<p>"I know it," said Fleming Stone, "and I, too,
fear the effect upon him. For that reason I have asked Dr. Sheldon
to be present."</p>

<p>When Dr. Sheldon arrived, he came directly to us in the library,
and Fleming Stone told him in a few words of the ordeal we had to
undergo.</p>

<p>The four of us then went down to Mr. Maxwell's study. We
found him there alone. We all went in, and Fleming Stone closed the
door. He stood for a moment looking directly at Mr. Maxwell, and
his deep eyes were filled with a great compassion.</p>

<p>"Mr. Maxwell," he said&mdash;and his voice though
quiet was most impressive&mdash;"we have come to tell you
that we have discovered that Philip Maxwell died by your
hand."</p>

<p>If any of us had doubted Alexander Maxwell's
guilt&mdash;and I think some of us had&mdash;all possibility of
doubt was at once removed.</p>

<p>If ever I saw a face on which confession was stamped as plainly
as on a printed page, it was Alexander Maxwell's face at that
moment. Instinctively, I turned away, but almost immediately I
heard Mr. Maxwell gasp, and I knew that Fleming Stone's
expectations had been verified, and that Mr. Maxwell's heart
had not been able to stand the shock.</p>

<p>Dr. Sheldon sprang to his side, and with the assistance of the
others laid the unconscious man on the couch.</p>

<p>"He is not dead," said Dr. Sheldon, after a few
moments. "And he will soon rally from this; but I feel sure
it is a fatal attack. I think he cannot live more than a few
hours."</p>

<p>As the doctor had surmised, Mr. Maxwell soon rallied and
spoke:</p>

<p>"Don't let Miranda know," he said,
"don't <i>ever</i> let Miranda know."</p>

<p>Fleming Stone stepped forward.</p>

<p>"Mr. Maxwell," he said, "if you will make a
full confession in the presence of these gentlemen, I will promise
you on my honor that I will use every endeavor to keep the
knowledge of your guilt from your sister."</p>

<p>"I will not only assist Mr. Stone in his endeavor,"
said Dr. Sheldon, "but I think I can safely promise that Miss
Miranda shall never learn the secret. You are very ill, Mr.
Maxwell, and whatever you wish to say must be said at
once."</p>

<p>"I am ready," said Alexander Maxwell, and though his
voice was faint, and though he seemed to realize his own fearful
position, yet his manner expressed a certain sense of relief which
I believed to be due to the relaxation of the tension of fear he
had been under so long.</p>

<p>"I am ready," he said again, "and, to make
clear to you the motive for my deed, I must begin my story many
years back."</p>

<p>"But you must make it brief," said Dr. Sheldon.
"I cannot allow you to talk long at this time."</p>

<p>"There will not be any other time," said Mr. Maxwell
quietly.</p>

<p>I could not help marvelling at this strange man, whose wonderful
power of self-control did not desert him in this moment of mental
and physical extremity.</p>

<p>Mr. Maxwell proceeded, and Fleming Stone took stenographic notes
of his statement.</p>

<p>"Twenty-five years ago I lived in California and so did my
brother John. Though not partners, our business interests were
closely united in many ways. My brother married, and, about a year
after Philip's birth, his wife died.</p>

<p>"Five years later, John Maxwell died, and left the whole
of his large fortune with me in trust for Philip. Although it was
supposed at that time that my own fortune was as large or larger
than John's, the reverse was true. I had lost much money in
unfortunate speculation, and it was to my surprise that I
discovered the large amount of money my brother had left behind
him.</p>

<p>"I used this money to make good my losses, trusting to
replace it with further gains of my own before Philip should come
of age. I was always a close-mouthed man, and neither Miranda nor
my other sister, Hannah, knew anything about John's
money.</p>

<p>"I came East to live, and after some years the lawyer who
was the only one beside myself who knew the circumstances died.
Having by this time become a well-known and respected citizen of
Hamilton, being president of the bank, and holding, or having held,
various public offices, my pride and ambition rebelled at giving up
my entire fortune to Philip.</p>

<p>"But it would have taken all my available assets to make
up the sum entrusted to me by the boy's father. For many
years I struggled with this temptation, and at last, when Philip
was twenty-one, I succumbed.</p>

<p>"On his twenty-first birthday, instead of telling him the
truth, I offered him a permanent home at Maxwell Chimneys and
agreed to support him indulgently and even
extravagantly."</p>

<p>Here, at the very climax of the recital, Mr. Maxwell sank back
upon the couch, breathless and exhausted. But after a
moment's rest he continued: "We lived happily enough
for a few years&mdash;in fact, until one day about a fortnight
ago.</p>

<p>"That morning I was here in my study and had spread out
before me the principal papers relating to the trust I had held for
Philip.</p>

<p>"Suddenly I was called to the telephone and, thinking to
return in a minute, left the papers on my desk. But I was detained
at the telephone much longer than I anticipated, and, when I
returned, although there was nobody in sight, it seemed to me the
papers had been disturbed.</p>

<p>"They were tossed about, and I felt a presentiment that
Philip had been in there and had read them. It would have been no
breach of honor on his part, for he had always been allowed free
access to my study and to my business papers.</p>

<p>"From that time on Philip was a changed man. His manner
toward me confirmed my suspicion that he had discovered my guilt.
No mention was made of the subject between us, but for more than a
week Philip continued to act like a man crushed by a sudden
disaster.</p>

<p>"Last Monday he wrote a letter to me in which he told me
that he had discovered the truth, and that he felt he was entitled
to an explanation. This explanation I knew I could not give, nor
was I willing to face my nephew's well-deserved condemnation
and the exposure of my treachery to the public.</p>

<p>"On Monday then, after reading Philip's letter, I
determined that I would take my own life, as being a cowardly but
final solution of my difficulties.</p>

<p>"Monday evening I sat in my study and decided that the
time had come. I had placed my pistol in my pocket, and had
intended to go up to my own room and there expiate my guilt toward
my brother and his son.</p>

<p>"At this moment, Mr. King chanced to come into my study,
and mentioned that Philip and Mildred were in the library. This
strengthened my purpose, for I felt sure that Philip was even then
telling Miss Leslie that he was in reality a rich man.</p>

<p>"Mr. King went on through the billiard-room and across the
hall to the music-room. I left the study at once, and saw Mr. King
enter the music-room door.</p>

<p>"As I crossed the back part of the hall, I felt an impulse
to look once more on Philip's face. I knew I could step out
on the balcony from the hall window and look in at the library
window unobserved.</p>

<p>"It has always been my habit when going out for a moment
into the night air to catch up any coat from the hat-stand and
throw it around me. I did this mechanically, and it chanced to be
Gilbert Crane's automobile coat.</p>

<p>"I went up the back stairs, putting the coat on as I went.
Instinctively putting my hands into the pockets, I felt there the
cap and goggles.</p>

<p>"It was then that the evil impulse seized me. I saw my
beautiful home with its rich appointments, its lights, and its
flowers; I heard the gay music and laughter; and like a flash it
came to me that Philip should be the one to give up all that, and
not I.</p>

<p>"I realized, as by an inspiration, that the goggles and a
turned-up coat-collar would be ample disguise, and I thought the
crime would be attributed to an outside marauder.</p>

<p>"The rest you know. Philip recognized me. But Miss Leslie
did not. That is all."</p>

<p>Mr. Maxwell fell back, and Dr. Sheldon, thinking the end had
come, went toward him.</p>

<p>But Fleming Stone, the inexorable, leaned forward, and said
distinctly to Mr. Maxwell: "Wait&mdash;did you refill the
inkstand?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Maxwell, with a sudden revival of
strength, "yes. I returned to the room late that night,
picked up the inkstand, washed it, refilled it, and replaced it.
The bronze horse I picked up and replaced before leaving the room
the first time."</p>

<p>I gazed at Alexander Maxwell, wonderingly. And yet, for a man
who could live the life he had lived, who could conduct himself as
he had during the past week, it was not strange that he was able
thus, in the face of death, calmly to relate these details of his
own crime.</p>

<p>"One more thing," said Mr. Stone. "Did you
scrape your foot around on the balcony to efface a possible
footprint?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I knew the dust was thick there, and I wished to
eliminate all traces."</p>

<p>Here Mr. Maxwell's strength seemed to leave him all at
once. On the verge of total collapse, he said again,
"Don't let Miranda know"&mdash;and then sank into
unconsciousness.</p>

<p>"He will probably not rally again," said Dr.
Sheldon. "I think his sister should be notified at once of
his illness. But we shall all agree that she must not know of his
crime."</p>

<p>"Shall I call her?" I volunteered, as no one else
moved to do so.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Dr. Sheldon. "She will be
startled, but it will not be entirely unexpected. I have warned her
for years that the end would come like this."</p>

<p>In justice to the innocent, Fleming Stone and I went at once to
Inspector Davis to ask that Gilbert Crane be released. The order
for release was sent immediately, and at last we were free to ask
Fleming Stone a few questions.</p>

<p>"How did you do it?" cried Hunt, in his abrupt
way.</p>

<p>"How did you do it so soon?" cried I, no less
curious.</p>

<p>"It was not difficult," said Fleming Stone, in that
direct way of his, which was not over-modest, but simply truthful.
"Mr. King's statement, which was the first one I heard,
showed me that, although Mr. Crane's alibi from ten
o'clock till half past ten depended entirely upon his own
uncorroborated word, yet Mr. Maxwell's alibi was equally
without verification.</p>

<p>"Mr. King saw Mr. Maxwell in his study at ten
o'clock. He was found there again some time after ten-thirty.
This proved nothing but the opportunity. Then all the evidence
regarding the coat, the clues found in the library, and elsewhere,
would apply to him as well as to Crane. It remained, however, to
find what motive, if any, could have impelled Alexander Maxwell to
the deed.</p>

<p>"I had not talked with him ten minutes before I concluded
that he was a man with a secret. Miss Maxwell supplied a clue when
she told me what she knew of Philip's early history.</p>

<p>"Another clue was the crumpled letter found among the
waste paper. This was addressed to Alexander Maxwell, and was
probably begun and discarded for the one which Philip wrote and
sent to his uncle.</p>

<p>"The fact that the inkstand had been refilled and replaced
argued some one familiar with the library; even Gilbert Crane would
not be apt to know where the supply of red ink was kept. Everything
pointed in one direction.</p>

<p>"But perhaps the most convincing clue was given to me last
evening by Mr. Maxwell himself. You remember, Mr. King, that I took
each member of the household to the study separately. When I
interviewed Mr. Maxwell there, I took care not to alarm him, but
rather to put him at his ease as much as possible.</p>

<p>"Noticing a well-worn foot-rest, I felt sure that it was
his habit to sit with his feet up on it. In hopes of his taking
this position, I asked him to show me just how he was sitting when
the news of the crime was brought to him.</p>

<p>"As I surmised, he sat down in his big armchair, and put
his feet upon the footrest. This gave me an opportunity to examine
the soles of his shoes, and I discovered on one of them a large
stain of a dull, purplish red. The stain made by red ink is
indelible and of a peculiar tinge, so that I felt sure this was the
man at whom the inkstand had been thrown, and who had unknowingly
stepped upon a wet spot of red ink.</p>

<p>"Owing to the awkward goggles which he wore, and, too, the
excitement of the moment, he probably did not notice the ink at
all. When he returned later, the spots had sunk into the crimson
rug, and partly dried. The shoes were light house-shoes, and
probably he did not wear them out of doors, for dampness or hard
wear would have tended to obliterate the stain.</p>

<p>"As it was, the color could plainly be seen. I am sure
that a chemical test would prove it to be a stain of red
ink."</p>

<p>Mr. Maxwell died that night, and Dr. Sheldon at once took Miss
Miranda to his own home, and kept her there, safely out of the
reach of gossip, until she went out to Colorado to live with her
sister. Her nerves were shattered, and she begged so piteously that
she might not be obliged to enter Maxwell Chimneys again, that her
wishes were willingly respected. The rest of us remained at the
house until the sister, Hannah, came to take charge of affairs, and
to take Miss Miranda home with her.</p>

<p>"It is a case," I said to Irene Gardiner,
"which proves your theory&mdash;the murder of Philip Maxwell
was brought about solely by opportunity.</p>

<p>"My chance remark to Mr. Maxwell that the young people
were in the library; the inadvertent snatching up of
Gilbert's coat; the fact that the goggles and cap were in the
pocket; the fact that Philip's uncle had a weapon with
him&mdash;all these things form tiny links in a strong chain of
opportunity."</p>

<p>"But the evil impulse must have been in his heart, or he
would never have taken advantage of this opportunity," said
Irene, unconsciously refuting a theory she had herself
advanced.</p>

<p>"I would rather not think," said Fleming Stone, in
his sweet, serious voice, "that opportunity creates a sinner,
or even that it creates an evil impulse. I would rather
believe&mdash;and I do believe&mdash;that opportunity only warms
into action an evil impulse that is lying dormant; and I do not
believe that dormant evil impulse is in everybody."</p>

<p>"Nor do I," said Irene; "it would be a sad
world, indeed, if that were true. And yet," she looked at me,
"I confess I used to think so. But I have learned much in the
last few weeks, and I realize how difficult it is to judge what
anyone would do or would not do upon occasion. And yet I would
rather believe that the evil impulse was created in Mr.
Maxwell's mind by the especial opportunity, than to think he
had all his life been a man capable of crime."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you're right," said Stone; "and
after all, it makes little difference. The thing is to have a
strong enough character or will to resist any evil impulse or any
special opportunity that may present itself. And that no one can
declare he possesses, until he has been tried and proven. But let
us be thankful that the opportunities are comparatively rare and
the natures that succumb to them are rarer still."</p>

<p>"It is a satisfaction to realize that," I returned,
"but that very knowledge makes it seem all the more strange
and sad that an exceptional case should be this of Alexander
Maxwell."</p>
