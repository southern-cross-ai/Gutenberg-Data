<p class="footnote">[* Mt Nicholson was named by Ludwig Leichhardt
(1813-1848?), naturalist and explorer, on 27 November 1844, after
Charles Nicholson (1808-1903) doctor, politician, landowner and
businessman. Leichhardt noted in his <i>Journal of an Overland
Expedition in Australia</i> that "the most distant range was
particularly striking and imposing; I called it "Expedition Range,"
and to a bell-shaped mountain bearing N. 68 degrees W., I gave the
name of 'Mount Nicholson,' in honour of Dr. Charles Nicholson, who
first introduced into the Legislative Council of New South Wales,
the subject of an overland expedition to Port Essington." Charles
Nicholson was Evelyn Louise Nicholson's father-in-law. More
information about him and about Evelyn Louise Nicholson and her
husband, Charles Archibald Nicholson, together with brief details
about a number of other people mentioned in the diary, can be found

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This ebook incorporates the untitled diary that Evelyn Louise
Nicholson kept from 10 June 1897 to 13 October 1897, during a trip
to Australia in 1897, together with a number of the sketches which
she and her husband painted during the trip.</p>

<p>In the diary, Evelyn Nicholson gives a picture of life during,
what she terms, a "honeymoon trip.*" She describes the voyages to
and from England, the cities and towns which they visit and
provides an account of the food, the landscape, the flora and fauna
and the weather, as well as acute observations of her
fellow-travellers.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Honeymoon trip: See <a href="#page71">20
September 1897</a>]</p>

<p>The diary and sketch book are held in the Rare Book and Special
Collections section of University of Sydney Library.* A partial
transcription of the diary was published by the library in
1999.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <a href=
"https://digital.library.sydney.edu.au/nodes/view/7536">Evelyn
Nicholson's trip to Australia, 1897</a>.]</p>

<p>After the first few pages of the diary, in which the author
describes the departure of her husband and herself from England and
begins to describe the sea voyage, the narrative is interrupted by
a description of a visit to Sydney University. The author then, on
page 10, under the date of 27 August 1897, describes a some of
their movements on returning to Sydney, after a voyage by steamer
to Rockhampton and return. Then, on page 11, under the date of 6
September 1897, she writes that the diary had:</p>

<p class="newspaper">"met the usual fate of dairies, and ended
abruptly. In fact it is so short a time ago that I can clearly
remember all the incidents, tedious and otherwise, of our outward
voyage. Possibly it is as well that the diary came to an untimely
end, owing to headaches and general slackness, as it could at best
have been but a gossiping record of our first impressions (modified
or confirmed as time went on) of one's fellow passengers, and of
the few sails we passed. And the more numerous specimens of the
animal and bird would [have been] so much more beautiful than
either."</p>

<p>The author then takes up the narrative from where she left off,
at sea, a short time out from London, and the rest of the diary
describes the voyage to Sydney, the return trip to Rockhampton and
the Nicholson's return voyage back to England. The text of this
ebook is in the same order as the diary.</p>

<p>Evelyn Nicholson's sketchbook contains watercolour sketches, by
both herself and her husband. Some of the sketches are referred to
in the diary. All of the sketches have been inserted into the text
at relevant places, according to the dates shown on them. Some
other images of printed menus, passenger lists, and miscellaneous
drawings are included in the collection. These have also been
inserted into the ebook, at appropriate places in the text.</p>

<p>Evelyn Nicholson's sketches often bear the initials "ELN" whilst
Charles' sketches are signed "CAN". Some sketches are unsigned.</p>

<p>The text of the diary is out of copyright in Australia, as are
the sketches by Evelyn and Charles Nicholson. Original content
added by me, such as the cover and notes are copyright. Readers may
enjoy them under the Creative Commons licence shown at the
beginning of this ebook.</p>

<h2>Evelyn Louise Nicholson's Diary</h2>

<p class="nowudont">{P1}</p>

<p><b>Thursday 10 June 1897 to &mdash; Monday 14 June 1897</b>
</p>

<p><a name="depart-england-1" id="depart-england-1"></a>
</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><b>1. Departure from England</b>
</p>

<p>The fourth day we have been at sea. We embarked at the Albert
Docks on Thursday 10 June but the ship did not start until next
day, while we were at breakfast. It was a relief to get out of
those horrid docks and steam slowly down the Thames with its
prismatic coloured flats and hazy blue hills, past innumerable
boats and barques with sails all shades of red and brown and
drab.</p>

<p>Archie left us at Gravesend. We felt rather blank at first and I
began to wake up out of the dreamlike existence of the last few
days and realise we were off and alone and together. I can't say I
saw much of the Kentish shore or of anything else that evening for
my head ached so badly, after the sounds and smells of the night,
that I stayed in my cabin the rest of the evening, only coming up
for a few minutes to see the end of a most gorgeous sunset, red and
purple over a golden and green sea.</p>

<p>We made up for everything by an excellent night and found
ourselves nearing Plymouth, when we arrived on deck. I had
<span class="nowudont">{P2}</span> made acquaintance with the
two Miss Bournes the day before, or rather, renewed my acquaintance
with Miss Clara Bourne, who was as charming as ever. We much
regretted her leaving us at Plymouth where the pilot, a nice old
man in a top hat, also wished Charlie and me an affectionate
farewell.</p>

<p>We both painted all the morning. Charlie began to find an
affectionate boy who had limpetted [<i>sic</i>] himself, after the
manner of boys; rather a nuisance. I slept all the afternoon (we
left Plymouth Harbour during lunch time) and when I woke we came on
deck and watched the Cornish coast fading into the distance.</p>

<p>The weather was perfect and we sat on deck in the moonlight till
quite late. We both drew one or two full-rigged ships that passed
us and caught the evening light in the most effective way.
Yesterday (Sunday) we only saw three ships altogether and no land.
It was a grey day, with gleams of sun and a most <span class=
"nowudont">{P3}</span> unpleasant swell, which made everyone
very miserable, though they all considered themselves very
brave.</p>

<p>I don't think anyone was actually seasick, though Charlie became
very green at tea time, so the kind Mr. Inman cut that meal (which
we had in his cabin, with him and the doctor) rather short and,
after lying down for a bit in our cabin, Charlie was soon all right
again.</p>

<p class="nowudont">{P4}</p>

<p><b>Monday 26 July 1897</b>
</p>

<p class="caption2">[The narrative of the voyage is interrupted here<br>
to give an account of a visit to Sydney University,<br>
after taking a return trip to Rockhampton]
</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><b>2. Sydney University</b>
</p>

<p>Ink is too valuable, and so is time, so I must put down my
impressions of Sydney University in pencil. I do so much wish it
were finer, as the view from there must be lovely, but one could
only see a few towers and chimneys through the thick haze of rain.
They have not had a rainfall like this for many years, and many
places which are usually green fields, are converted into
lakes.</p>

<p>We splashed through the streets with Thomas and eventually found
a steam train which rushed us through what seemed interminable
suburbs, where parks and dust heaps; huge stores and tiny dwelling
houses one storey high; miles of hoardings with advertisements of
purely local productions boldly purporting to be in use all over
the world; were mixed up in bewildering confusion.</p>

<p>The suburbs extend to, and beyond, the gates of the University
gardens, which no longer are in the country. They are well planted
and plenty of hibiscus, trumpet ash, laurestinus and other
flowering shrubs were out. The older part of the building is by far
the best. The medical school, a large separate building in the same
<span class="nowudont">{P5}</span> style, is a mongrel
imitation, the Macleay museum being a terrible edifice in brown
brick which is being smothered with ivy as fast as possible. The
tin roof, however, nothing can hide. The Schools of Chemistry,
Physics, and Engineering are in low somewhat shed-like buildings,
and at the back there are even wooden and corrugated iron erections
(some of them devoted to the lady students) mixed up with
tennis-grounds and asphalt paths, which give a very un-scholastic
appearance to that part of it.</p>

<p>The more temporary ones will, however, be swept away if
Government grants the £30,000 necessary to complete the side of the
quadrangle opposite to the Great Hall. This, Mr. Barff, the
Registrar, who took us round and showed us everything with the
greatest kindness, told us they had great hopes of commencing next
year. I said I hoped they would also complete the cloisters.</p>

<p>They allow golden ivy to grow up the buttresses of the hall
which give it a more venerable appearance than the rest of the main
building, but <span class="nowudont">{P6}</span> the coats of
arms between each are not going to be covered up. I saw the
well-known one, on the right of the big door of the hall outside,
and also in one of the windows in the entrance hall, where some of
the tapestry, and pictures given by Pater are also hung.</p>

<p>The great hall is very fine indeed, the roof beautiful. The
picture at home does not give a good idea of it, as it is very
dark, the large windows being all filled with coloured glass.
Pater's portrait occupies the left hand side of the end wall, in
the place of honour, and there are various prints of it in other
parts of the building. It is too much in the dark to be well seen,
and though strikingly like Syd, is not an altogether good likeness,
the head being so small as to give the impression of a very tall
man.</p>

<p>We recognised the portrait of Mr. Denison and were shown that of
Sir W. Manning and other people. We saw some of the lecture rooms
and then Mr. Barff took us to the museum where everything seemed to
be labelled with <span class="nowudont">{P7}</span> Pater's
name, and there was a general idea of him pervading everything.</p>

<p>This beautiful collection is not seen to the best advantage, as
it occupies one large, and two smaller rooms, but the things are
beautifully mounted and most carefully arranged. The new buildings
will consist of a museum below and new library above.</p>

<p>For the splendid collection of books they possess, the present
premises are very much cramped. The Etruscan vases in Pater's
collection cannot be seen to advantage, being too near together.
They are most beautiful and varied, and the Egyptian collection is
wonderfully interesting. I do not think two such enthusiastic
visitors as ourselves can have surveyed them for a long time.</p>

<p>Mr. Barff says the Greek and Roman things are the most
interesting to the general visitors. The paintings on the mummy
covers are as fresh as possible, and Charlie was delighted with
them and the little Etruscan cinerary urns and the inscriptions and
everything. We are going again when we return, if possible.</p>

<p class="nowudont">{P8}</p>

<p>They are very proud of them, though I doubt if many people know
much about them! We were loath to leave the museum, but there was
so much to see, and we got home very late, as it was. The Macleay
Museum of Natural History has some good specimens, but is not well
arranged. Several huge casts of Egyptian antiquities (waiting for
the new buildings) mixed up with the stuffed animals and skeletons,
give it a somewhat grotesque appearance.</p>

<p>While we were here, a violent storm of rain descended with a
noise like thunder on the iron roof, and when it was over we rushed
through mud and puddles to the Medical School. They are very proud
of this and the stained glass in the windows thereof. I have no
doubt it is a most convenient and suitable building, but it is
extremely hideous. There is an excellent pathological museum, with
rather too many horrors for my taste, and we also saw the huge
lecture rooms, and well fitted laboratories, and declined to go
into the dissecting room!</p>

<p class="nowudont">{P9}</p>

<p>The Engineering School interested me very much, as did that of
Chemistry where we were introduced to Professor Liversidge and much
enjoyed seeing some most beautiful specimens of gold in nuggets,
which he brought out for our benefit. When sawn through, the finest
of these (about 3 inches across) presented the appearance of
crystalline formation, all in the purest gold. He took us to see
the furnaces for refining, and the gold, and we also saw the
museum, with good specimens of minerals and a quantity of the
copper sheathing of a vessel, which the professor told us contained
minute particles of gold, and which he was going to test.</p>

<p>Professor Threlfall showed us the Chemistry School, and
described his interview with Pater in London, which seems to have
much amused him, and then, last of all, we inspected the Biology
School, which I think pleased me, most of all the new part. It is
only a tiny, low building with a creeper covered verandah, but is
most compact and well arranged, and the little museum perfect in
its way. Mr. Barff kindly promised to get one or two photographs
done <span class="nowudont">{P10}</span> for me to take to
Pater, as I did not see any good ones of the University in
Sydney.</p>

<hr class="a">

<p><i>[In Sydney, after returning from a trip to Rockhampton.]</i>
</p>

<p><b>Friday 27 August 1897</b>
</p>

<p>When we returned to Sydney, we spent another delightful
afternoon at the University, this time in fine weather, and in
company with Lady Manning. Mr. Barff was away, but had left a proof
of his kindheartedness and sympathetic interest, in the shape of a
lovely book of photographs for Pater.</p>

<p>We spent a long time in the Great Hall, and wondered more than
ever at the bad taste of the present Sydneyites with such an
example before them. In the Nicholson Museum* we made one or two
little sketches of some of the beautiful things, but our time was
too short. We were extremely glad to have the opportunity of
refreshing our remembrance of what interested us most there and, in
fact, of what we shall always remember as the pleasantest of our
experiences in Sydney.</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><b>3. The Voyage from Teneriffe to Sydney.</b>
</p>

<p>It does not seem at all long since I resolved to keep the diary
which has met the usual fate of diaries and ended abruptly. In
fact, it is so short a time ago that I can clearly remember all the
incidents, tedious and otherwise, of our outward voyage. Possibly
it is as well that the diary came to an untimely end, owing to
headaches and general slackness, as it could at best have been but
a gossiping record of one's first impressions (modified or
confirmed as time went on) of one's fellow passengers, and of the
few sails we passed, and the more numerous specimens of the animal
and bird world so much more beautiful than either.</p>

<p>We soon got accustomed to the objectless horizon and, by the end
of the first week, to our fellow passengers, the whole of whose
names I did not, however, arrive at till about halfway.</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><b>3.1 Teneriffe</b>
</p>

<p>We reached Teneriffe on June 17* and got up early to see as much
of that beautiful coast as possible. Our table companions and chief
friends were already on deck. They were:</p>

<p class="footnote">[* There is a blank space in the manuscript
where, it seems, the author intended to enter the day, but did not
do so. There are sketches made at Teneriffe on 17 June 1897, so
that date has been used.]</p>

<p>Mr. &amp; Miss Headington, an old gentleman of a most sunny and
happy disposition and an equally good-natured daughter; Mrs.
<span class="nowudont">{P12}</span> Cohen, a pretty Jewess with
two dear little children, going back to her home in Melbourne after
a year's absence; The Hon. C. E. Hill-Trevor and Lieut. H. D. O.
Ward, R.H.A., Lord Ranfurley's two aides de camp* with whom we soon
became great friends.</p>

Zealand.]</p>

<p>Why everyone on board failed to do so, I can only attribute to
jealously, or some small measures of that sort, as they were
uniformly kind and pleasant and most considerate for all on board,
excellent company and clever into the bargain.</p>

<p>Well, all these people met us, brandishing sketchbooks for the
most part, and upbraided us with our lateness. I accomplished two
sketches before the sun was very high, so did not do badly. Charlie
went on shore almost immediately in a small boat with Mr.
Inman.</p>

<p class="caption2">Peak of Teneriffe after sunset, 17 June
1897</p>

<p>It was a very hot day, and my head ached, so I did not join the
rest who went on shore, but tried to paint till the black dust (we
were coaling) over everything stopped me. I finished up our letters
and later on watched the little dark-skinned boys diving for
pennies from a boat by the ship's side.</p>

<p class="nowudont">{P13}</p>

<p>Charlie returned in the afternoon, with ten sketches, which give
me a better idea of the place than anything else could, and the
others arrived just in time, before we started, having had a long
drive to Laguna and brought back some lovely fruit.</p>

<p>Mr. Inman had brought me some in the morning, when I was
gasping, and I was also looked after by Mr. Buxton, with whom we
had made quite friends, he being, as I soon discovered, younger
brother to V. Buxton and going out to his people at Adelaide. His
sister, a young lady with a charming face, which attracted me at
once, had seen him off at Plymouth (where Mr. Ward also came on)
and I did not then know she was the girl I had met at Grasse eleven
years before.</p>

<p>All through the voyage these continued our chief friends and, by
degrees, one corner of the library got to be looked on as our
property, though in the hot weather we did not trouble that stuffy
apartment much. Charlie and I almost always had tea with Mr. Inman
on Sundays, and sometimes in the week, and there used to meet Mr.
Bartlett and Mr. Gannule, two of the ships officers, which wretched
individuals <span class="nowudont">{P14}</span> are not allowed
by the Shaw Savill regulations to be acquainted with the
passengers. Mr. Gannule, however had known my cousin, George
Oliver, so we ignored the regulations.</p>

<p>In fact, as much as possible, we annoyed the Captain, for whom
no one had any love, and as even a polite question was an annoyance
to him (so great was the great man's dignity) it was no difficult
matter. Mr. Inman, the Dr. and the Captain took turns weekly to
reside at our table and much jollier it was the weeks our friend
was there. At any time it was the jolliest and most conversational
on the ship and was envied or hated accordingly, as the case might
be.</p>

<p>During the hot weather, life was only possible on deck, and our
principal occupations were drawing each other and talking. Mrs.
Cohen and Mr. Ward did some really clever caricatures. Charlie got
through a certain amount of work, and was regarded as a wonder by
all on board.</p>

<p><b>Sunday 20 June 1897</b>
</p>

<p>I remember Sunday June 20 remarkably well. It was intensely hot
and I got a slight <i>coup de soleil</i>, looking over the ships
side, at the curious <span class="nowudont"><a name="p15" id=
"p15"></a>{P15}</span> little Portuguese men of war, floating
on a perfectly shining sea. Besides that, two dolphins, the most
gorgeous blue and prismatic fish, passed under the ship.</p>

<p>At service, where the Captain presided as usual, we had the
special prayer for the day and the hymns chosen for the occasion in
England.* I had played the hymns the first Sunday, but got Mr.
Inman to let me off and a rather feeble person played them as far
as the Cape. The Captain's pronunciation of the names in the
lessons was a cause of hilarity during the whole voyage. I remember
he called Phessice "Venice," Sisera "Sisira," and prayed for
protection from the "voylance" of the tempest.</p>

</p>

<p>On 22 June the saloon presented a gala appearance, being hung
with flags and jubilee tri-coloured muslin, and every table was
ornamented with flowers by Mr. Inman, who had kept them alive in
the freezing room and sat up half the night to make the saloon look
as festive as possible.</p>

<p>Besides extra good meals and unlimited champagne at dinner, and
drinking Her Majesty's health, <span class="nowudont"><a name="p16"
id="p16"></a>{P16}</span> the only other special thing to mark
the day was that at four o'clock a rocket was fired off and we all
on the two decks joined in singing <i>God Save the Queen</i>, (with
the new verse), after which I retired to bed and lay with my head
on ice all night.</p>

<p>I was very bad all next day with the usual accompaniments of
sun-stroke, but the next day I was better, though my head still
ached. That Monday we had heavy thunder-storms and all that week
the weather was oppressively hot, with rain at night, so that the
windows were kept shut and life was a burden.</p>

<p>The evenings on deck were cool and the phosphorescence
beautiful.</p>

<p>During the whole voyage, we had a concert in the evening, given
by the steerage, to which we all listened, a much more successful
affair than one we had attempted on deck the previous week.</p>

</p>

<p>After the worst of the hot weather was over (we crossed the line
on 23 June) the Sports Committee set to in earnest and three or
four days were enlivened by most people making, more or less,
exhibitions of themselves. I won the <span class="nowudont">{P17}</span>
second prize [in the] egg and spoon race, and C. the
first [in] arithmetic. Lord Ranfurley's ten servants came out
strong in the sports. The caricatures went on as usual, and by the
time we got to the Cape, we had quite settled everyone's histories
and the skeletons in their most private cupboards, and were on
better terms than ever with our special friends.</p>

<p><a name="cape-town-32" id="cape-town-32"></a>
</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><b>3.2 Cape Town</b>
</p>

<p>On 2 July we reached Cape Town and there kind Miss Bourne left
us. The others who departed were a somewhat sordid-minded couple
with a family of five nice boys; some Americans who were no special
loss; and a young lady on the subject of whom speculations had been
rife, and whose dress, flirtations, and guileless innocence, to say
nothing of her pretty face, had been the amusement of all on
board.</p>

<p>We afterwards heard she was an actress at the <i>Variety
Theatre</i> at Johannesburg, and the last we saw of her was going
off in a hansom with another not-to-be-regretted passenger&mdash;"a
man with a history"&mdash;which, in his case, meant
mostly&mdash;drink. However there were still two, <span class=
"nowudont">{P18}</span> if not three, dipsomaniacs left on
board, and we took on a very ill-conditioned looking "crowd" at the
Cape, so there was still come excitement.</p>

<p>One of the new passengers, a Mr. Musters, who had been in
"Jameson's Raid"*, and was a very good sort, became our friend and
joined the little circle in the corner of the library. The rest
were no gain at all, and we could well have dispensed with a Scotch
bagman and his wife, who made day and night hideous with their
howls at the piano, and whose opinion of us was much what ours was
of them.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* The Jameson Raid (29 December 1895 - 2
January 1896) was a botched raid against the South African Republic
(commonly known as the Transvaal) carried out by British colonial
statesman Leander Starr Jameson and his Company troops. <a href=

<p class="caption2">Table Bay, 2 July 1897, (C.A.N.)</p>

<p>On 2 July we woke up to find ourselves slowly steaming along the
lovely African Coast with low lying purple hills, a glorious green
blue sea, whales at intervals and flights of the most charming
birds, among whom we saw, for the first time, the sweet little
chequered cape pigeon.</p>

<p class="caption2">Sunset, Table Bay, 2 July 1897, [C.A.N.]</p>

<p>We painted hard all we could, but we moved so fast it was
difficult. Table Bay and Mountain are very fine <span class=
"nowudont">{P19}</span> and the harbour was full of lovely
sailing ships, and some picturesque old hulks showed green in the
green water. All along the jetty myriads of birds sat in black and
white rows, but we passed everything so quickly one could not take
in all one saw.</p>

<p>The tender with the mail was a welcome sight and we shouted
enquiries to a sailor, as to how the Jubilee had gone off in
England, in a way that seemed to astonish him.</p>

<p>We heard there of the loss of the <i>Aden</i>* and the death of
Barnato**, not much else. Mr. Buxton got a wire to say he was 1st
in 1st class in his Tripos, so someone was happy at any rate. As
for Charlie and me, we bundled on shore as fast as we could, as
there were not more than four hours before the ship started.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Wreck of the Aden. See <a href=
"https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/EP18970819.2.3"><i>Papers

<p class="footnote">[** Barney Barnato, born Barnet Isaacs, was a
British Randlord, one of the entrepreneurs who gained control of
diamond mining, and later gold mining, in South Africa from the
1870s. He is perhaps best remembered as being a rival of Cecil
Rhodes. <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barney_Barnato">Wikipedia</a>.]</p>

<p>Charlie was in great woe, and desired beyond everything to
return straight to England, but he seemed to have recovered his
spirits again when I met him later on at the bank, where I had gone
with Mrs. Cohen, as she did not care to go alone.</p>

<p class="nowudont">{P20}</p>

<p>The "blacks," of whom we saw many on the wharf, are, some of
them, most repulsive looking, others rather fine men. In Cape Town
there are people of every shade of colour. Some of the old Malay
women are rather picturesque, and the children quite
pretty-looking. Beyond a gay coloured crowd of niggers round some
fishing boats on the beach, I saw nothing really picturesque at
Cape Town, which is the most squalid looking place I ever saw;
miserable shanties jumbled up with pretentious and awful buildings,
in the most degraded styles.</p>

<p>The "Cathedral" is a box-like building with square windows, only
one of which was good. It possessed high pews and the fittings
overall were awful. However, we were glad to be in a church again
and also, later on, to see some real green grass in the Botanical
Gardens, where we sat for a little time and looked at the bare
English oaks and some poinsettias and clumps of narcissus and
forgot, or pretended to, all the discomforts of the voyage. We also
enjoyed having a meal to ourselves again and altogether felt better
(n.b. C. had some beer!).</p>

<p class="nowudont">{P21}</p>

<p>The Nixons, from whom we had had a kind letter, were out when we
called, so we returned to the town and had some tea. We met Mrs.
Cohen in tears because she had lost her children, but they were
soon afterwards found by Mr. Inman. We only just got to the tender
in time, as our cabby went to the wrong wharf, but soon found
ourselves on the ship again listening to the experiences of our
friends and struggling hard to paint the effect on the mountains of
one of the most lovely sunsets I have ever seen.</p>

<p>We moved out of the harbour only too soon with the sunset glow
lingering for long after the sun had set and a little crescent new
moon hanging in the crimson for a good omen for the next three
weeks. They passed very quickly indeed. It was cold and wet, and we
had some days when the ship rolled heavily all the time, others
when she pitched, and a good many on which we were glad to stay in
the library with rugs and I, for my part, slept more than ever in
my life before.</p>

<p>Two days off the Cape we passed the largest shoal of porpoises
anyone on board had ever seen. <span class="nowudont">{P22}</span>
It was more than a mile long, and the sea seemed
literally alive with the dear things all jumping in rows and
looking the happiest of living things. We had one or two lovely
days then one when, all unprepared, we sat or lay on deck as usual
and there came a great wave and down went Charlie's drawing things,
just rescued in time by Mr. Musters and, after a good deal of
laughing and shrieking and scrambling, everyone (no one got wet)
moved their chairs to a safer place and tried to forget how we were
rolling.</p>

<p>I had two bad falls that day, [one] on the slippery deck and the
next, when Charlie's instruments and all the loose chairs were
sliding up and down the library. He got a bad bang on his head from
a pillar coming towards him and I had to strap him up with plaster.
Several people had bad falls and much china was broken those days.
Mrs. Gannule told me the ship had been at an angle of thirty-eight
degrees which, in such a monster, rolling slowly, is not a pleasant
position.</p>

<p><b>Tuesday 20 July 1897</b>
</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><b>3.3 Hobart</b>
</p>

<p>We had a good many letters to write and plans to arrange etc.,
and the time went very quickly so that we came to 20 July and the
low shores of the Derwent early that day, almost before we could
realize the voyage was over. Hobart has a lovely harbour and is a
most pretty old-fashioned looking town, dominated by the beautiful
crags of Mount Wellington, all streaked with snow.</p>

<p>We had lunch on board and said farewell to most of the
passengers but left the final goodbyes till we returned to see the
<i>Gothic</i> off at four. Mrs. Cohen met her husband and went on
shore to Hayley's Hotel, as did Mr. Evans and his brother (a poor
consumptive man who had nearly died on board) and some other of the
passengers. Mr. Mercer, a cheerful young Australian, Mr. Buxton and
ourselves went to Heethome's Hotel, the latter coming with us in a
cab.</p>

<p>It was nice to be on shore and I began to get an appetite at
once and Charlie looked more cheerful than he had done for six
weeks, though he was very depressed at finding we could not get on
till the Thursday, nor possibly get to Sydney before Saturday 24th.
We returned to the <i>Gothic</i> before any of her remaining
passengers did, <span class="nowudont">{P24}</span> and watched
them all returning by twos and threes. These violets* were some of
a large quantity of most beautiful flowers Mr. Inman had had sent
on board.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Two dried flowers are attached, with sticky
tape, to this page of the diary.]</p>

<p>We had bought a cup (with "Love the Giver" on it) for Miss
Headington, and a spoon, and presented them to her great
satisfaction and amusement.</p>

<p>Mr. Hill-Trevor and Mr. Ward, having lingered to buy her a hat
and a bun, were late and the big ship had begun to move slowly out
of the wharf before they arrived, breathless. Their embarkation and
that of Messrs Butler and Dudgeon, also left behind, was scarcely
dignified.</p>

<p>We walked along the wharf exchanging last words with our friends
and Charlie threw them some apples, then we left the Cohens and
others and went right on to the end and waved and waved till our
floating home swung slowly around in the bay, pouring out volumes
of black smoke, and then seemed to shoot off and become a mere dot
in no time. Mr. Inman's tall figure waving a pocket handkerchief on
a stick, was the last we could distinguish. It was very pathetic
altogether.</p>

<p class="nowudont">{P25}</p>

<p>We went back to tea with Mr. Buxton and then C. and I poked
about a little, went into the cathedral, which is a somewhat cold
looking building, but churchlike and well appointed, heard most
part of Evensong, and then came back to our hotel where that night
we slept the sleep of the just as much as was possible from the
intense stillness and stationariness of everything.</p>

<p>The next day was rather rainy, but with gleams of sun. Mr.
Buxton had dined with the Gormistons and found out we "ought to
see" the Fern Tree Bower, a bit of tropical forest on the slopes of
Mount Wellington, about five miles distant. So we four started and
had a most lovely drive. The road wound slowly up through suburbs
first, small cottages and villas with shingled roofs and bright
gardens, then through more or less cultivated country and finally
through bush: thick undergrowth of sheoak, wattle, tamarisk and
other shrubs, with fringes of scarlet and white heaths and towering
masses of gum trees, which, in Tasmania, are real giants, very
different to <i>any</i> we saw in Australia.</p>

<p class="nowudont">{P26}</p>

<p>Everywhere the practice of ringing* is adopted, and we passed
some large tracts of these skeleton trees, while other solitary
specimens gleamed white through the surrounding foliage. All the
way, lovely peeps of the harbour, river and surrounding hills, blue
or purple under cloud shadows, greeted us at the turns of the road.
Fern Tree Bower is, in itself, a sort of tropical tea garden and
therefore a disappointment.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* ringing, or ringbarking: the complete
removal of a strip of bark from around the entire circumference of
the trunk of a tree, which results in the death of the tree]</p>

<p>There is a tiny inn and a church on the same scale, and one or
two wooden shanties, and one wooden house, also a gate with "To the
Bower" on it. You proceed for about a quarter of a mile along a
neat path with benches and tree ferns at regular intervals and you
arrive, finally, at a clearing with more benches; a sort of cricket
pavilion; a stream; two rows of tree ferns, neat and clean and
looking like (as C. said) cigars with a tuft on the top; and an
inscription put up by the municipality of Hobart. It looks like the
grave of something, possibly poetry, for there is no sign of that,
but I daresay it is a convenient spot for tea picnics.</p>

<p>The woods are full of the flat fern opposite*. The indented sort
is one side frond of a frond of tree fern. These are about six feet
long when full grown. The highest tree fern at the Bower was
thirteen feet, but we saw some really beautiful ones afterwards,
after walking about half a mile along a rougher path into the
forest. The gum trees are here most grand, with huge roots about
sixteen feet or more in diameter, near the ground, towering up into
the most fantastic shapes.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* The specimen has been removed from the page,
with only a vague impression remaining.]</p>

<p>After a clearing of dead giants, we came into a dense forest, oh
so damp, and dripping and mossy, and looked down from the raised
path, down the hill into a tangle of tree ferns and gum tree roots
and stems, which must have looked the same for centuries. (Plenty
of living poetry here.)</p>

<p>The dead tree ferns have fallen on one another and got matted
together with creepers, so that you can't see where the ground is,
while everywhere their huge fern leaves spread, and the upright
plants (many of them have stems twenty feet high) carry ball-like
heads of drooping leaves, as you see in an old palm, very different
to the broom-like specimens in the Bower.</p>

<p class="nowudont">{P28}</p>

<p>We came round by a different way to the inn, where a curious
meal of chops cheese, raspberry jam, cream, potatoes and tea had
been prepared for us. On our return to Hobart Charlie and I went
out and bade farewell to Mrs. Cohen and the Evanses, went to the
end of evensong and finished up by doing a little shopping on the
way home.</p>

<p>In the evening we all sat in a snug little room by a fire and
Charlie, Mr. Mercer and Mr. Buxton, smoked and held forth on
Australian politics. It was great fun.</p>

<p>Our train left at eight next morning and we were quite sorry to
say goodbye to pretty English-looking Hobart. Tasmania is a lovely
country but it strikes an English person as being dreadfully
uncultivated and yet it is a garden compared with Australia. The
railway took such sharp curves and kept one in such a state of
agitation with jolts and bangs that I was quite surprised to arrive
safely at Launceston.</p>

judge of it before our steamer, the <i>Coogee</i>, started and
[there was] a great scrimmage to get the luggage. All the
population and one individual in a top hat were occupied in staring
at Lady Gormiston, which accounted for the fact that <span class=
"nowudont">{P29}</span> our luggage was left behind, as we
found, at Melbourne. We enjoyed steaming down the Tamar in the
lovely evening light, and watched the most glorious sunset as we
emerged into Bass Straits.</p>

<p>I had an amusing conversation with Mr. Buxton in the evening, re
his family. He wanted us to come to lunch at Government House at
Melbourne and see his father. We had a good crossing, slept pretty
well, and fairly early came in sight of that most ugly place,
Melbourne.</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><b>3.5 Melbourne, Victoria</b>
</p>

<p>We disembarked on a squalid wharf where I saw old Sir Fowell and
we heard of Lady Brassey's accident. C. and I were not sorry to
escape lunching there. Grief followed, as our baggage was not
forthcoming, so after bidding a sad farewell to our two pleasant
fellow travellers we went up to the office to telegraph, etc.</p>

<p>Melbourne is all huge offices and public buildings, built in
what someone told me was the Scotch Gothic style (n.b. a very ugly
style). Electric and cable trams tear up and down, busy men and
dowdily dressed women jostle you rudely. Nowhere seemed there a
rest for the sole of one's foot. I was especially struck with the
<span class="nowudont">{P30}</span> mixture of squalor and
splendour and the extremely frumpy style of the ladies'
dresses.</p>

<p>Melbourne Cathedral is a very fine building, by Butterfield,
with ghastly fittings by a local man. I sat there and rested some
time. We also found a seat in the sun in a rather bare public
garden and I nearly went to sleep on C.'s shoulder, I was so
tired.</p>

<p>Our train left at four so we had some tea first and then, there
being no room anywhere else, I stayed in the ladies' carriage with
a young lady and a child, and C. hovered about between that and the
smoking carriage. At Albury at 12 pm, on the frontier, we had to
change. After that the line was broad gauge and less jolty; it was
awful before.</p>

<p>We could only find room in a carriage with four men, but they
were very kind, especially in the matter of all getting out by 3
a.m. and leaving us to get a little sleep at last. In the night we
passed the remains of three bushfires, the stumps still
smouldering. That was the only relief from the monotony of three
hundred miles of gum trees&mdash;gum trees&mdash;gum
trees&mdash;small and stunted, on bare brown ground, with here and
there a clearing, and a few wooden houses and occasionally, a
church.</p>

</p>

<p>The approach to Sydney by the railway is not imposing , but we
were most delighted and thankful to get there about eleven, after
passing through about ten miles of beadvertisemented [<i>sic</i>]
suburbs. It was pouring with rain, much needed after a terrible
drought. We settled ourselves in at the <i>Grosvenor</i>. Charlie
went out to see Thomas and send off telegrams about the luggage,
and I wrote letters and rested. Not much could I see of Sydney
through the haze of rain.</p>

<p>Thomas Fenn came about 2 o'clock, and as he was most anxious to
take us out, out we went, regardless of the pouring rain. We had
only our journey clothes on, so did not care. I had various small
purchases to make, owing to the lack of luggage, and we found only
one shop still open, it being Saturday afternoon. Some of the
warehouses and public buildings in Sydney are fine and solid
looking, and the whole place has a much more established, and not
such a mushroom look, as Melbourne. The streets are not wide. They
are paved with cobbles. Omnibuses rattle over these.</p>

<p class="nowudont">{P32}</p>

<p>In some streets your life is imperilled by steam trams, in
others you find great comfort in the cable or electric trams. The
traffic is not regulated by the police, but where the steam trams
cross the cable ones, there is a signal post which is some slight
comfort. Except for the corrugated iron verandahs to the shops,
Sydney is an English looking place.</p>

<p><b>Sunday 25 July 1897</b>
</p>

<p>We woke early to find heavy rain still falling, and we puddled
through the wet streets to the Cathedral to Early Service. We liked
the Cathedral very much, though it is not such an imposing building
as Melbourne and the windows are bad. There is also a dado of most
terrible tiles, but it all felt homelike.</p>

<p>The service was performed in a somewhat slovenly manner, a good
deal by the clerk! but we were too glad to be in a Church again to
mind. We managed to get a cab, coming home. In the afternoon we
energetically started for Ashfield (about 10 miles out) to see the
Corlettes. We got an omnibus to the station at Sydney, but there
was no cab at Ashfield Station and apparently no one knew where the
Corlettes lived.</p>

<p class="nowudont">{P33}</p>

<p>One peculiarity of Australians is that, if they can't answer a
question, they don't say so, but simply stare, and go on. After
some wandering and many enquiries we saw the house in the distance
and rushed up the path in a pouring shower of rain, certain that we
were right by the appearance of an unmistakable Corlette in the
doorway.</p>

<p>They received us very kindly and we promised to come and stay
with them on Tuesday, if they would excuse our travelling clothes.
We saw the whole family except the eldest son, who had gone to
England. Miss Corlette drove us back in the buggy to the Station.
It still rained.</p>

<p>We did some telephoning for the first time in our lives that
evening, to Lady Manning, to whom I had written, and she promised
to come to lunch on Tuesday. No, I remember it was Monday evening
we telephoned. It is a strange sensation hearing a voice from five
miles away [that] you last heard in England.</p>

<p><b>Monday 26 July 1897</b>
</p>

<p>On Monday morning C. went to see Pater's old House, now a
convent, and other places with Thomas, and in the afternoon he took
us to the University where we spent a most pleasant afternoon, in
spite of the rain.</p>

<p class="nowudont">{P34}</p>

<p>A good deal of our time in Sydney was spent in various offices,
re tickets, steamers, luggage etc. Also, we presented all the
letters of introduction, [which] we brought.</p>

<p>On Monday morning C. also went by steamer to Manly, and saw the
harbour and brought me back some lovely wild flowers, which I
painted. He also called on Mrs. Knox, which she returned, finding
me in.</p>

<p><b>Tuesday 27 July 1897</b>
</p>

<p>Tuesday morning we went to the Bank etc., and then looked up Mr.
Statham, who was most kind and jolly. He took us in a little
electric launch, across the Harbour to the Pastoral Produce Co.'s
Warehouse and Refrigerating works, of which he is, I think,
Consulting Engineer. It is a huge building. We went up in the lift
to the top, passing floor after floor, some empty, some full of
huge bales of "dumped" wool. Mr. Statham showed us the machinery
where this was done, also the engine rooms where the ammonia
freezing process causes the engines to be covered with snow.
<span class="nowudont">{P35}</span> In several places a valve
causes one side to be covered with snow, while the other is so hot
you could not bear your hand on it.</p>

<p>We saw the huge condensers, and entered a small and arctic
chamber where the snow lay in heaps and the temperature was about
26 degrees below freezing point. There is a huge store, where the
sheep are frozen, after being run in along a rail at a certain
height above the floor. There were about a thousand carcasses
there, as hard as iron and giving back much the same sound when
struck.</p>

<p>The view from the roof of the building is very fine, and I got a
better idea of Sydney harbour than I ever did in any of our
journeys up and down it. It was a brilliantly fine day, the water
blue, and enough clouds to make effective shadows on the more
distant hills. The shipping was most picturesque. Several fine
boats, a P. &amp; O., N. G. Lloyd, and other big liners, lay
outside Circular Quay.</p>

<p>Sydney Harbour has a most wonderful number of small bays and
inlets and could, I should think, accommodate all the fleets in the
world. The effects at sunset are lovely, especially as the features
one could dispense with, such as the numbers of <span class=
"nowudont">{P36}</span> villas that spoil the appearance of some
of the most beautiful bays, are then veiled in a mysterious golden
light.</p>

<p>We were a little disappointed after Hobart, in finding all the
hills round Sydney Harbour so low, and no one striking feature, but
possibly we had expected more than the beauties we did find in it,
from the exaggerated accounts one reads, which are hardly
applicable to any place on earth, certainly not to any place where
there is a large population, and Nature is by no means left to
herself.</p>

<p>Lady Manning came to lunch, and was very kind. She had not got
into her house yet, but wanted us to come there on our return. She
deprecated our going to the Corlettes, as she said we should not be
comfortable. However we were, in an Australian way. They are most
kind, and we liked them very much. Isabelle does wonders, but one
sees the result of the real mistress of the house being "feckless"
in the general muddle and impunctuality of everything. Mrs.
Corlette is very fond of drawing and took a great interest in my
efforts. I spent most of Wednesday morning painting.</p>

<p class="nowudont">{P37}</p>

<p>Dr. Corlette took Charlie [on] a ruridecanal* round, in the
buggy, and I stayed at Ashfield and lazed and, in the afternoon,
helped to entertain various ladies who came to tea. Dr. Corlette
and Charlie, who mutually liked each other, stayed out so long that
the good ladies only had a momentary glimpse of my better half, and
I had to be extra amiable to make up.</p>

clergy who presides over a "rural deanery." "Ruridecanal" is the
corresponding adjective for the term. <a href=

<p>As a punishment, poor Charlie got bitten by the Corlettes'
horse, "Charlie," a waler* of uncertain temper. It did not graze
the skin, but was a bad bruise for nearly a fortnight and needed a
lot of rubbing and bandaging and commiseration on my part, as the
poor dear could not use his arm.</p>

some hot beverage or other all day long, viz. seven times. Tea
before breakfast, tea or coffee at breakfast, cocoa in the middle

before going to bed.</p>

<p>Isabelle drove us to the station next morning and we had a
certain amount of business to do before going to tea with Mrs.
Tregarthen, Lady Manning's daughter, with whom she was staying in
Rose Bay.</p>

<p class="nowudont">{P38}</p>

<p>In answer to telegram news [that] had come that the luggage had
been sent on by ship and would be at Sydney on Friday, for which
piece of calm stinginess Charlie sent the Shaw Savill Co. at
Melbourne a letter which must have been rather unpleasant to
receive. By their carelessness and delay we had missed the fast
boat to Rockhampton and had to put up with a little coasting boat
(A.U.S.N. Co.), the <i>Eurimbla</i>, leaving on Saturday at 2
p.m.</p>

<p>Rose Bay is a very pretty part of Sydney, as we saw, from Mrs.
Tregarthen's, Pater's old House, <i>Lindsay</i>, in a lovely
position with garden down to the water's edge. There are houses all
the way to Rose Bay, now.</p>

<p><b>Friday 30 July 1897</b>
</p>

<p>The luggage arrived early, and we spent nearly all the morning
repacking it. Mr. Thomas Knox came to call, and was very kind,
giving us two letters of introduction; one, to Mr. Walsh at
Brisbane, and one to Mr. Hamilton Turner at Rockhampton, both also
in Dalgetys. (n.b. Mr. Moore is the head of the Shaw Savill Dept.
of Dalgetys in Sydney).</p>

<p>After lunch we went out and did a great deal of business. In the
morning we had gone to a little opal shop where I bought four, and
also plunged in the way of being <span class="nowudont">{P39}</span>
photographed at the celebrated Crown Studios. We got our
tickets, money, letters etc., also bought some charming toys for
Thomas' children, and then started, somewhat late, by the 4 o'clock
steamer for Coogee. So I saw the harbour with the advantage of the
sunset light, and did some little sketches of the Heads etc. on the
way.</p>

<p>Coogee is a small place with a big house, belonging to the

We then patronized the chief industry of the place, viz. the
providing of teas, and just caught our steamer back nicely.</p>

<p>We were very happy, sitting in the half darkness, watching the
numberless lights reflected in the water, especially so, as the
next day we would really be off and near the end of our long
journey.</p>

<p>We had unpacked the presents for Thomas and took them with the
toys to his house after dinner, where we spent the evening with
him, his wife and little boy (the other two children were in bed)

<p>This little boat, on whom we spent many subsequent day, proved a
comfortable and homelike place. Fortunately we had very fair
weather, or we should not have got on so well, there being no
sitting room except a tiny smoking room on deck, as one could not
count the saloon which was just over the screw. There was no
gallery round the companion where one could sit, as in the
<i>Coogee</i>, which is one of Huddart Parker's boats.</p>

<p>The <i>Eurimbla</i> is an A.U.S.N. boat. Our cabin was of the
tiniest, but on deck. The berths were hard and the drain from the
wash-hand basin smelt, but for all that we liked the little boat
very much.</p>

<p class="nowudont">{P41}</p>

<p>Her captain (Grahl) was a very nice cheery, untidy man with whom
we soon made great friends. His great idea is his wife, of whom he
is evidently very fond. We found out all this and heard all his
history later on. He was always a especially kind to me, being a
"Hampshire man" born at Portsmouth.</p>

<p>Charlie was not over well that first evening. Somehow, without
being a bad sailor, he never is very well the first day or so on a
ship and the whole time I was on the <i>Eurimbla</i> I felt seedy.
I think it was the stuffiness and smells.</p>

<p>The sunset that evening was lovely. I tried to paint it to
please Charlie, who could not draw, poor dear, his arm being in a
sling. We sat side by side and watched the shore and were quite
happy. We were never out of sight of land all that journey and
sometimes came quite close.</p>

<p>I did a good many sketches all the way, but it is a monotonous
coast, nothing but gum trees and sandhills alternately, and here
and there distant blue mountains, but for the most part low
hills.</p>

<p class="nowudont">{P42}</p>

<p>In all the 500 miles from Sydney to Brisbane we only passed four
lighthouses (in the day time) and one village (on Sunday), no sign
of any other human habitation. One does not wonder at the centres
the towns become when one sees what immense tracts of wasteland
separate them from one another.</p>

<p><b>Sunday 1 August 1897</b>
</p>

<p>Sunday was a somewhat heathen experience. There was a tall man
dressed as a person with a long head, and still longer hair, and I
wondered if he would have any sort of service, but it was a good
thing he did not, as he was probably a Baptist, as they all dress
alike out here.</p>

<p>There were some nice people on board, a Mr. and Mrs. Bethell and
her brother. She had travelled a good deal and I found a good many
subjects of interest in common with her. They kindly lent us some
papers on Sunday afternoon and Charlie spent some time asleep on a
bench, where I covered him up and sat by him.</p>

<p>Next day, the coast was very uninteresting and flat, hardly any
blue hills. Brisbane River is full of curious buoys and landmarks
which the gulls consider their special property and on which they
sit in rows. It was dark when we got in and [we] could only see by
the lights, that it is a largish place.</p>

<p class="nowudont">{P43}</p>

<p>We were a long time getting birthed and were very glad to get
onshore and walk up to our hotel, <i>The Imperial</i>, where, after
some tea etc., we went to bed. It was much warmer here and we saw
several people in white dress as we came up the main street, while
in Sydney they are still in very winterly clothes.</p>

<p>Brisbane is difficult to describe, as it did not impress us in
any way. There is so little of it and yet it is large. The post
office is a fine building, with arcades and a flavour of the
Uffizzi about it. We found some dear letters awaiting us, of which
we were very glad.</p>

<p>We had pretty well made up our minds in many long talks on the
<i>Eurimbla</i>, to go by the <i>Tongariro</i> on 2 September or,
at any rate, try to, and risk staying in New Zealand if we
missed&mdash;all this if a fortnight sufficed us at
Rockhampton.</p>

<p><b>Tuesday 3 August 1897</b>
</p>

<p>We had had so much cold water thrown on the whole thing in
Sydney, where everyone considers Rockhampton a sort of inferno,
that I should have stayed behind if we had not both been rather
miserable at the idea. Mr. Statham, however, had told us it was all
right there now, and so did Mr. Walsh, whom we duly called on, on
Tuesday morning, and found most kind and pleasant.</p>

<p class="nowudont">{P44}</p>

<p>It was hot, and so glary, we both found our black spectacles
necessary. We called on Mr. Bland (head of the A.U.S.N in Brisbane)
and Mr. Forrest. The latter was out, but subsequently telephoned
his regret at missing us. We heard at the wharf that our tiresome
boat did not leave till 8 p.m, this being a great blow to our
worthy skipper, as we thereby missed all the good tides.</p>

<p>Charlie and I then found the cathedral, a small church with iron
pillars and, what was far more interesting, the museum where there
is a really splendid natural history collection. We saw some of our
old friends the porpoises; some swordfish; a Tasmanian devil, which
is a harmless looking beast though very ugly; whole families of
kangaroos; opossum; wallabies; and other marsupials. There were a
good many platypi, also fine specimens of fish, snakes,
butterflies, all kinds of reptiles, and the most exquisite
birds.</p>

<p>We recognised our dear friends the albatross, of whom we had
seen many after <span class="nowudont">{P45}</span> the Cape,
grand stately birds amid a crowd of molly hawks, cape pigeons, and
seagulls, but lost our hearts completely to the funeral cockatoos,
huge and black and fierce, with enormous plumes and a few scarlet
or yellow feathers at the edge of the tail.</p>

<p>All the parrots were lovely. The two things that amused me most
were a lizard with a frill and an animal I have never seen before,
a wombat. Oh! So fat, all down the same size, legs and tail and
all, something like Mab!</p>

<p>There is a good collection of minerals which also interested us.
After lunch I had a good rest, it was so hot and tiring; and C.
went out for a walk. His arm made him rather sad as he could do
nothing.</p>

<p>We went out together later and had tea in a nice clean shop,
then went on, and after looking at a lot of opals I bought one or
two, before we returned to dinner.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding being on board in good time, we did not start
till late so, after sitting on deck and talking a bit, we went to
bed.</p>

<p class="nowudont">{P46}</p>

<p><b>Wednesday 4 August 1897</b>
</p>

<p>All Wednesday morning we were going through Sandy Straits* where
a narrow channel of deep water runs between sandbanks. The Straits
are formed by Fraser island, a Long island covered with gum and
other trees, and mangrove swamps along the coast.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Now called "Great Sandy Strait."]</p>

<p>Here and there we saw pelican and crane. The island is named
after Fraser, who was shipwrecked there with his wife. He was
killed by the aborigines and eaten, but Mrs. Fraser lived among
them for three years, at the end of which time she was rescued by
some escaped convicts, who she afterwards rewarded by denouncing
them to the authorities! I hope she was not an Englishwoman. Beyond
a horse station, established there by some Englishman, the island
is only inhabited by "blacks."</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><b>4.2a Maryborough, Queensland</b>

<p>In the afternoon we reached Maryborough, after steaming slowly
up seven miles of the Mary River. As the ship did not leave again
till ten, we had plenty of time to see all there is to be seen at
Maryborough, which does not take long. There is a post office; two
or three dreadful edifices called churches, of which the RC is the
worst; a long wide street with verandahs; a few shops; and
innumerable public houses and restaurants.</p>

<p class="nowudont">{P47}</p>

<p>We had tea in one of these, but they looked shocked when we
asked for ices, which were advertised in the window, as, though
very hot, it was winter time.</p>

<p>We saw some shockingly scurrilous democratic papers outside a
bookseller, which made us feel angry, and yet sorry that these
benighted people should be fed on such trash and have no chance of
better.</p>

<p>The great thing at Maryborough is the garden, a lovely place on
the river bank planted with palms bolinieas, bougainvilleas and
masses of bamboo, towering up to quite forty feet. The flowering
shrubs were in full beauty and we sat in the shade and much enjoyed
ourselves.</p>

ground falls very prettily into several sorts of basins, which are
taken the best advantage of, and well planted. We came back two
hours late for dinner, but returned again to the garden to sit in
the moonlight till it was time to go back and turn in, before the
ship at last started.</p>

ending in a causeway, built up over the swamp, at the end of which
we could see a chimney. The town is four miles inland. This is the

Rockhampton, but to our eyes looked like Martin Chuzzlewit's

<p class="footnote">[* Mark Tapley accompanied Martin Chuzzlewit
when Martin went to the United States to seek his fortune. The two
men attempted to start new lives in a swampy, disease-filled
settlement named Eden, but both nearly died of malaria. <a href=

<p>We went on shore, but I don't think I should have done so, if I
had had any idea what a mangrove swamp was like. These ghastly
looking trees, with their high interlaced roots, all whitened with
salt, grow in thick black slime where nothing else will live. The
smell was horrible and, but for finding a tiny plant of eucalyptus
on the track, I think I should have gone back. Charlie smoked
vigorously.</p>

<p>We emerged onto a salt pan, a white waste stretching on all
sides, across which the causeway ran, and at length brought us to
the meatworks.</p>

<p>There is a wooden post office on piles, two or three shanties on
a bare hill, with a few scanty gum trees. Here and there a waler
was trying to find something to eat. A curious conveyance with two
rat-like horses waited to take passengers to the "town." Bones and
ashes lay all about, and the smell was so insufferable that we beat
a most cowardly retreat, without exploring further.</p>

<p>We stopped about seven times in the course of the night, as the
Fitzroy is a difficult river to navigate, in a thick fog. However,
the morning light found us safely tied up to the wharf at
Rockhampton and looking out one could see little white wooden
houses along the bank and high hills.</p>

<p>We slept again till the steward informed us Mr. Mawdsley was
asking for us. It was raining, but he had slept the night before at
the hotel in order to meet us. We dressed quickly and went on
shore, a cab taking us and our possessions to the Criterion Hotel,
a substantial stone building with deep verandahs and loggia over,
where we had a bed and dressing room (opening out of one another
and onto the loggia) and where A. Mawdsley stayed to breakfast with
us, before taking C. out to show him round.</p>

<p class="caption2">Rockhampton, 10 August 1897, (C.A.N.)</p>

<p>Rockhampton is by far the prettiest place we saw in Australia.
The hills are such lovely shapes with deep blue coombes in them.
They sunsets and early morning effects are glorious. It is not
prejudice, though possibly our knowing so much about it all,
<span class="nowudont">{P50}</span> and feeling more or less at
home there, had something to do with our liking it so much.</p>

<p>Sydney is so un-English really, and yet so unlike a foreign
place that we felt altogether fish out of water there, but
Rockhampton is so thoroughly colonial, with its wooden houses built
on piles, its gardens, hills and woods, and we entered so much more
into the colonial manner of life, that we could feel it to be a new
experience and enjoy it accordingly.</p>

<p>Charlie, of course, was quite happy having plenty to do at last,
and his arm got all right very soon. Almost every day he bicycled
somewhere with Mr. Blain, to look at the land, and spent much time
in the office and seemed soon to grasp the situation
completely.</p>

<p><b>Friday 13 August 1897</b>
</p>

<p>We stayed at the hotel till Wednesday the 11th and were very
comfortable there. On Friday, the day we arrived, Mr. C. Thomson
came to lunch and I went out with C. in the evening and saw A. M.'s
office and also Isabella, who came in to fetch him.</p>

<p><b>Saturday 14 August 1897</b>
</p>

<p>On Saturday, Miss Rees Jones called on me in the morning and
Mrs. Mawdsley came to lunch. C. went to see Mr. Thomson off in the
morning and met Mr. Archer and Mr. Meacham. Mr. Reid was away. C.
had been made a member of the club for a month and used to see
people there occasionally.</p>

<p class="nowudont">{P51}</p>

<p><b>Sunday 15 August 1897</b>
</p>

<p>On Sunday I did not go to church in the morning. Mr. and Mrs.
Fergusson came to see me, both in great grief at not having known
before and wanting to carry us off there at once. However, I told
them the Mawdsleys expected us first. I arranged to go for a drive
next day. They were very kind.</p>

<p>The weather was so hot that I was only comfortable in white but
the inhabitants went about saying the wind was cold. However, on
Wednesday that dropped, and they allowed that it was warm, even
very warm, towards the end of our stay. They have had practically
no winter this year.</p>

<p>The moon was lovely every night and we tried our best to paint
sunsets. I went to part of the evening service with C. on Sunday.
The cathedral looks as if it was built of cardboard and as if a
good wind would blow it away. The only really substantial thing in
it is the reading desk!</p>

<p>The man who took the service had a fine voice. The choir
evidently considered they had too, and proceeded at their own sweet
will, <span class="nowudont">{P52}</span> half a note ahead of
the organ all the time. It did not much matter, as the organist was
not particular and played wrong notes in the non-vocal portions of
the service.</p>

<p><b>Monday 16 August 1897</b>
</p>

<p>On Monday afternoon I went on a long drive with Mrs. Fergusson
and her daughter, Mrs. Sydney Jones. We started along the road up
the river, went round by the jail and Mrs. E. V. Reid's house,
along the ridge to the south of the town, past the residences of
the elite (n.b. except the Fergussons, all are of wood with
corrugated iron roofs) and returned through the town and a little
way along the road, down the river.</p>

<p>From the ridge you have a magnificent view across the lagoons to
the south, a wide tract of country, mostly uninhabited, with grand
Hills in the distance. None, however, are so beautiful as the three
to the north of the river, Mounts Berserker, Archer and Nicholson,
especially the second.</p>

<p>From the ridge, the town of Rockhampton reminded me of nothing
so much as a brickfield, the acres of corrugated iron roofs being
only occasionally varied by larger buildings. Of these, the post
office is by far the best, a graceful looking building with pillars
and arched verandahs.</p>

<p class="nowudont">{P53}</p>

<p><b>Tuesday 17 August 1897</b>
</p>

<p>On Tuesday afternoon, just as I was setting out with Minnie
Mawdsley, for a drive in their buggy, came Mrs. Blain, an old
Scotch lady, who seemed to think three quarters of an hour the
regulation length for a visit. On the two occasions when I saw this
most excellent person, what chiefly impressed me was her evident
desire to talk on what she considered <i>my</i> subjects.
Consequently we discoursed on the "very best" society. The Baroness
Burdett-Coutts was quite the least exalted person mentioned.</p>

<p>When she asked me what I thought of the fashions out here, I was
quite at a loss and merely exclaimed, "are there any?" The good
soul was evidently quite satisfied with the date of the mode of her
best black silk.</p>

<p><b>Wednesday 18 August 1897</b>
</p>

<p>The next day, having had various callers, I went by myself in a
covered buggy, to return them. This calling amused me very much. It
is the one thing the ladies of Rockhampton have to do, and it is
evidently a high crime and misdemeanour not to be very particular
about it. There are difficulties however. [In the] first place the
roads <span class="nowudont">{P54}</span> would not be called
roads in England. Even the main thoroughfares are so terribly up
and down that I always came back from a drive feeling like a jelly.
The other roads are mere tracks, where the trees have been cleared.
Here and there it has been too much trouble to grub a stump and it
stands in the middle of the road, a foot or so high. Here and there
the "road" goes across a creek, down one side, bump, bump, up the
other, at an angle of about 30 [degrees].</p>

<p>I never quite made up my mind whether I preferred being on the
celestial or terrestrial side on these occasions. Ruts, of course,
are a mere nothing. What the horses are made of, that they don't
shy, I cannot think. Their nerves are considerably better than mine
as, on a moonlight night, a weird white gum stump (all the trees
are white gums, and very ugly they are) six feet high, with just
room between it and a hole for you to pass, if you have luck, used
to make me even feel nervous.</p>

<p>Those people who have no roads to their house, (like Mr.
Hamilton Turner), <span class="nowudont">{P55}</span> but where
you drive over the downs, with its short dusty grass, wherever
there are least hummocks, are the best off. Then too, having drawn
up on a slope and the carriage having got through the gate, the
family horse, which is walking about the drive, may chance to think
it would like to get through too, and some delay occurs before it
is induced to change its mind.</p>

<p>All the houses are built on high posts, to keep off the white
ants, and a flight of steps leads you into the verandah. If the
lady is at home the house door is open, and a bell generally stands
on a bracket, which she as often as not answers herself. Some of
the houses are very pretty and cosy and English-looking. Some are
most untidy, like one place where I called and thought I had got
into a chicken yard by mistake. There was rabbit wire all round,
ashes and bones strewn everywhere, not a flower or green leaf, and
such a funny shanty-like house, all closed up, as the lady was
out.</p>

<p>Some of the houses have lovely creepers, but most people are
afraid of these, on account of the snakes.</p>

<p class="nowudont">{P56}</p>

<p>I called on Mrs. E. V. Reid, Mrs. Sandford Wills, Mrs. Dove,
Mrs. Fergusson, Mrs. Sydney Jones and Mrs. Allen, besides those I
have mentioned, while at Rockhampton and C. called on Captain
Hunter.</p>

<p>On Wednesday we began a delicious, free, open-air existence with
the Mawdsleys, with whom we stayed till the following Tuesday. They
do everything for themselves and we helped them as much as they
would let us. It all reminded me of our life at Alassio.</p>

<p>The delight of having no servants sleeping in the house, no one
can imagine who has not tried it. Out there in the bush it is so
safe that they never lock up anything, not even the doors of the
ground floor rooms, kitchen, store and dining rooms. One night we
went out possum shooting, the dogs in a wild state of excitement.
None were shot, however, that night, though Charlie and A. Mawdsley
brought back one, another evening.</p>

<p>The moonlight was lovely and the creek was delicious at night,
to all but one's nose, for there were skeletons of dead beasts
everywhere and here and there a carcase, not yet finished up by the
birds of prey.</p>

<p class="nowudont">{P57}</p>

<p>It is so curious, the bare brown grass and big boulders, and the
shadeless gum trees, mixed up with shrubs and ti-trees,
bush-apples, hibiscus here and there, white stumps or fallen
trees&mdash;a most weird landscape.</p>

<p>It was very hot in the day time. One day when I went out and
caught some of the gorgeous butterflies, (which I let loose again,
n.b.) I nearly got sunstroke.</p>

<p>The birds were exquisite&mdash;several kinds of hawks and kites,
magpies, parrots green and pink, the sweetest little tree creepers,
wrens and finches&mdash;these were common and so tame.</p>

<p>Then there were the soft gentle-looking black and white butcher
birds with the curious cry; the laughing jackasses whose insane
cackle seems to go on all day sometimes, and once I saw one of the
exquisite little bee-eaters, a wonder of blue and golden
glories.</p>

<p>On Sunday, when there was a new "bush violet" in the creek, I
saw, among other curious birds, the king hawk, a grand bird which
Mr. Inman pointed out to me. He came to see us, but missed Charlie,
who had gone on a long walk with the two Mawdsleys, (Harry having
come down from <span class="nowudont">{P58}</span> Mt. Morgan on
Saturday) attired in very little besides a pith hat. However, they
were none to cool. Charlie came back enchanted with the wild beauty
of the hills, but oh the heat! He went to see Mr. Inman twice and
got me two opals.</p>

<p>On Thursday we had a long lovely day on the river. Charlie and
I, Archibald and Minnie Mawdsley, and Mr. Schmidt of the Harbour
Board, and his sister, were the party.</p>

<p>We went about thirty miles down the river in the H.B.* steam
launch to Broadmount, where a pier, a hotel, and a station Master's
house, form the nucleus of a new town.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Harbour Board.]</p>

<p>We saw a good many crane and one porpoise, but no alligators,
which was a great disappointment. Mr. Schmidt afterwards gave me a
crocodile's egg which, with sixty-six others, he had got out of a
large nest on the river bank.</p>

<p>Friday, Charlie was busy so I stayed in and painted and in the
afternoon went with Isabella to see kind old Mrs. Fergusson in her
big upholstery house. There was a "crowd" playing tennis who all
stared, but we excused ourselves and so avoided being delayed, and
[having] an inventory of my clothes taken by the Rockhampton
ladies.</p>

<p class="nowudont">{P59}</p>

<p>Charlie missed his way that night and Isabella and I waited a
long time for him, but got so eaten by mosquitoes we had to
return.</p>

<p>Saturday stands out in my memory as a typical Australian day,
very hot. We went by train to Gracemere early and were met by Mr.
C. Archer and driven to the house, which is what they call a slab
house and is one of the oldest about. On three sides it is
surrounded by the lake and the garden is exquisite though, owing to
bad times, not well kept up now. It was an ideally lazy day, most
of it spent in the cool verandah, covered with masses of thunbergia
out in flower, part of it playing with Mrs. Archer's fat baby, and
talking to her and her nice sister, Mrs. Allen, in her room. I do
not know how many pipes Charlie smoked!</p>

<p>Mr. W. Archer was away, but his brother was very kind. They
insisted on our taking away some native curios. Indeed, everyone
was most kind in giving us things. Most of Sunday morning I spent
talking to <span class="nowudont">{P60}</span> Mr. Inman in the
verandah. It was a hot day, one could not sleep in the afternoon or
breathe anywhere in the house, but it was very lovely. What must
the heat be in the summer?</p>

<p>Harry Mawdsley did not return to the mine till Tuesday morning,
on the afternoon of which day we left Grangemount, sadly, and went
to Kenmore, the Fergusson's big house.</p>

<p>I much enjoyed the three days we spent with those excellent and
kind people whom we both liked. They are so much more simple than
their surroundings. Our bedroom was a sumptuous apartment with a
mosquito netted brass bed in the middle and an arched verandah all
to ourselves on which, after the heat of the day, I walked with
Charlie in my night dress and felt cool for the first time. All the
rooms are big and the house is well adapted for the climate, with
beautiful bathrooms.</p>

<p>On Thursday evening we drove back with A. Mawdsley and had
dinner with them and a pleasant last evening, driving back in the
dark to the town, where we got a cab on.</p>

<p class="nowudont">{P61}</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Fergusson brought me down to our ship (the
<i>Eurimbla</i> again) next day and Charlie met us there. Archibald
and Mr. Rees Jones lunched with us at The Criterion and at 2
o'clock saw us off, as did also Mr. Schmidt and Mr. Blain.</p>

<p>I threw Archibald some of the lovely roses Mrs. Sydney Jones had
given me, as we sheered off. Our journey back to Brisbane differed
from the last, as we only stopped at Bundaberg, where we arrived on
Saturday afternoon. The banks of the river are lined with
plantations of cane and there is a huge sugar mill at the wharf,
where we stopped.</p>

<p>We were not to go on till next day, so went on shore and drove
to the hotel. It is a rather pretty place. there is a winding river
and a good deal of variety in the trees, a change from the
everlasting gums. It was very hot.</p>

<p>The town is like all these new places, an immensely wide street
with low buildings with iron verandahs, a small English church, a
more imposing RC one, a large post office, and several
substantially built banks, and a great many pubs and eating
shops.</p>

<p class="nowudont">{P62}</p>

<p>We saw a good many kanakas, who are nice cheerful clean-looking
people with a good type of face. We much enjoyed having dinner
alone together again and were preparing for a cosy evening when we
heard, accidentally, that the ship would sail at 2 a.m. if the tide
rose high enough.</p>

<p>Having verified this fact, we reluctantly packed up again and
returned to our boat. A wretched night followed, hot and
mosquito-ey. Poor Charlie's hands and feet where a sight, and I
killed fifteen mosquitoes in our cabin next morning.</p>

<p>We were still at the wharf and felt very injured altogether.
However it was a lovely morning and we were on shore before 8
o'clock. The English church was hermetically sealed and no signs of
a service. We inquired and heard "not till 11", so we went on to
the RC church, which was crowded.</p>

<p>The Irish priest gave out a notice of a forthcoming "social" for
the benefit of the church. "If ye don't approve of the manes
[means] ye must approve of the end, and it doesn't matter whether
ye come or not, so long as ye send yer cash to father Maloney or
me."</p>

<p class="nowudont">{P63}</p>

<p>We also heard a peculiar notice given out in our church, which
we attended later on, after sitting a little on the wharf, and
Charlie drawing a picture of the ship for the captain. The English
church is a wooden building, very light and sunny looking. The
congregation consists mostly of very young women, a good many
children, one young man, several old ones, a kanaka or two, two old
ladies, and a fox terrier dog, who behaved admirably.</p>

<p>He belonged to a lady with two children and his conduct was far
more devout them theirs. The parson was an old Scotsman who
preached a really excellent sermon, conducted the second part of
the service on lines not authorised in the prayer book and gave out
a notice that the "Reverend Mr. Stone Wig would lecturer on Wilson
and Barrett's startling and thrilling drama, 'The Sign of the
Cross,' illustrated by slides."</p>

<p>At intervals in the service, the lowing of two cows feeding
around the church mingled with the music. There were three nice
hymns sung, numbers &mdash; [a space was left in the diary for the
numbers but these were not inserted].</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><b>4.6 Brisbane, Queensland</b>
</p>

<p>The <i>Eurimbla</i> got under weigh about 2 o'clock and we
reached Brisbane on Monday evening, too late to get our tickets
changed for railway ones. Nevertheless Charlie went to see Mr.
Bland at Kangaroo Point to see what could be done, but we found
that even if we risked it and got the money back, at the other end,
from the A.U.S.N. it would cost us about £11 and we did not
consider 24 hours extra in Sydney worth that.</p>

<p>We slept at the Imperial again and the next day the wretched
boat's start was altered from 12 to 5 p.m. so we had plenty of time
in Brisbane. We called on Mr. Chambers, Mr. Walsh and Mr. Bland,
Mrs. Chambers and the two Miss Fergussons came to see me about 12,
and Charlie got his hair cut, a great event.</p>

<p>At 4 p.m. we went to Mr. Walsh's office and he most kindly took
us a short drive to see the Parliament house, gardens and club,
where we had tea. He is a most pleasant Irishman and from his
manners one would never guess that he has never left the colony. He
helped us a good deal and, when we got to Sydney, Charlie got our
tickets arranged <span class="nowudont">{P65}</span> entirely to
his satisfaction, so that we could change them in New Zealand if
necessary.</p>

<p>Mr. Walsh saw us off. We had a terrible crowd of bounders on
board, some of whom sang and shouted and made fools of themselves
late into the night. I never saw such people. There were one or two
dreadful females who were, fortunately, seasick most of the way to
Sydney.</p>

<p>The nicest passengers were a racehorse and nineteen mules, which
were going to the miners in New Guinea. The <i>Eurimbla</i> always
carries a tame sheep on board, "pour encourager les autres*." We
did not understand this at first and used to be quite afraid of
eating mutton, it was such a dear gentle looking thing.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* "An order to encourage the others," usually
stated ironically, of an action carried out as a warning to
others.]</p>

<p>The voyage to Sydney was sad and dull. Charlie was seasick and
generally miserable and we neither of us felt fit for much. We used
to come down to meals but spent a good deal of time in our
births.</p>

leave him at Sydney, which we reached about 8.30 on Thursday
evening. The faithful Thomas was awaiting us with a pile
<span class="nowudont">{P66}</span> of letters, among others a
note from Lady Manning, begging us to come or not, just as suited
us best. We thought it the only chance of seeing her so, depositing
some of our luggage at the bank, we drove straight to 111 Macleay

nearly an hour to read. I answered as many as I could. The news
from home was delightful to get: little Harry having a Winchester

me up, we had been <i>so</i> long without news.</p>

so much. In the afternoon we went with Lady Manning to the

<p>We did not get to Wellington till Wednesday 1 September and all
the way till we got into the straits and most awful weather. I
never saw such a ship. She rolled even when there was nothing to
make her, and we were throwing about like balls. It was a very
miserable time, the ship was so dirty, the rats ate my shoes and
one was afraid of leaving the cabin.</p>

<p>Sunday and Tuesday we <span class="nowudont">{P68}</span> had
huge seas over the deck all day and it rolled and rained
incessantly. Everyone was ill, many people, including myself, who
had never been so before. We soon got cheerful again though, and
were out most of Wednesday.</p>

<p>Wellington Harbour is most lovely, both coming into it at night,
and as we saw it next day. The town is on the lower slopes of a
grand mountain, the shapes and colours of the hills are exquisite,
and the water the clearest blue. Next to us in the wharf lay our
good <i>Tongariro</i> and we went up a gangway and made enquiries
as to when she sailed, feeling most elated at having caught her
after all.</p>

<p>We did enjoy a calm night's rest in a stationary room and woke
feeling fit for anything. On Thursday morning we saw our ship out
in the blue water of the harbour, very pretty she looked. We went
to see Captain Rose and found him most kind and courteous. He
fetched Mr. Inman to see us. Presently C. went on with Captain R.
to get the luggage and see to things, and I returned slowly to the
hotel, buying some books, a pipe for Charlie and other little
things on the way.</p>

<p class="nowudont">{P69}</p>

<p>I had written to Mr. Hill-Trevor the night before and now got a
note expressing great grief that, owing to their having been at
Auckland with the governor, and only returning the night before, he
had only just got my former letter. They accepted our invitation to
lunch and duly turned up. It was pleasant to see their familiar
figures coming down the street. We had a very jolly lunch. It would
be difficult to say who talked the fastest. Their experiences had
been most funny and we nearly died of laughter at their account of
the subsequent history of some of the <i>Gothic</i> passengers.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pearson was married. Mr. Hutchinson, one of the most pious
people on board, was so overcome at parting with the very vulgar
widow, with whom he had been flirting all the way, that he had
taken to drink and smashed all the windows of his sister's house!
"Dips" the M.P. had also "broken out." So had Dr Wynne, the keeper
of another dipsomaniac!</p>

<p class="nowudont">{P70}</p>

<p>The Dr. (Hill) and Mr. Inman had nearly come to blows, and
"Legs," after inventing new calumnies against the innocent Mr.
Ward, had been "took worse" and was apparently at the point of
death. We felt very sorry to leave our friends in, what is, of
course, a most uncongenial atmosphere.</p>

<p>Their last words were to the effect that they should certainly
call on us in three years. They could not stand five. Mr. Inman and
his wife and captain Rose also saw us off. The two aides tied their
handkerchiefs to sticks and waved them till we were out of
sight.</p>

<p>There appeared to be some excitement on board the
<i>Tongariro</i> as the tender drew near and everyone stared at us,
the two only first class passengers. A gentleman sent by Captain
Rose for that purpose, introduced us to Captain Mayoss.</p>

<p>We made friends with the doctor on deck and before long our
luggage was all on-board, and ourselves steaming away down that
lovely harbour, most regretful to leave no chance of drawing in
that beautiful scenery, but heartily glad to be all to ourselves,
and on our way home at last.<a name="page71" id="page71"></a></p>

<p class="nowudont">{P71}</p>

<p>Monday 20 September 1897</p>

<p>We have had a most satisfactory voyage so far and ought to get
to Montevideo tonight. The sea, for the last few days, has been a
marvel of lovely colours. Today it surpassed itself, deep
green-blue showing the white and brown of the innumerable birds off
well.</p>

<p>Since we left New Zealand, we have not been one day without
seeing birds: cape pigeons every day and occasionally molly hawks
and gulls. The molly hawks are dear birds, they have such wise
faces. There have been a couple of boobies also, following the ship
all day.</p>

<p>We are very happy, indeed, having a perfect honeymoon trip, with
the variety of the societies of the ships officers, who are all
gentlemen, and some of whom we like very much. Mr. Turner, the
first officer, comes and sits with us for a bit every morning, in
the cosy deck drawing room and Mr. Devine, the second, does the
same, nearly every afternoon. I fear this peaceful existence may
come to an end if any "bounders" come on tomorrow.</p>

<p class="nowudont">{P72}</p>

<p>It has been most wonderfully calm all the way, even off the
Horn, which we passed on Sept. 16th. The wind has been with us, and
we have had our sails out nearly all the time.</p>

<p>It was very cold on Sept. 8th, Wednesday, on which day, as we
were passing it all day, we must have sighted about 200 miles of
ice. We woke up in the night feeling the ship stop, but she soon
went on again, and when we looked out in the morning the ice lay
some distance off to starboard, in a glittering white line, with
occasional icebergs. It was very cold and I did not go out all
day.</p>

<p><a name="cape-horn-52" id="cape-horn-52"></a>
</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><b>5.2 Cape Horn</b>
</p>

<p>For two or three days I was kept in by a cold, as the wind was
bitter, but I soon got all right again and we both have been very
well indeed. We had hail and snow storms while passing Cape Horn,
but the sun shone out brightly between, and enabled us to see and
sketch the grand mountain 3500 ft. high, crowned with snow, while
cloud-like lines of snow mountains stretched away into the
distance, beyond. There was a glorious sunset.</p>

<p class="nowudont">{P73}</p>

<p>The coast of Terra del Fuego is very grand, bare and desolate
looking with high peaks and glaciers. At night we went up on deck
with the captain to see him fire off three rockets, as a tribute to
the memory of the missionary who died there! We are now in the
estuary of the River Plate, but it is so wide that one can see no
land.</p>

<p><a name="montevideo-53" id="montevideo-53"></a>
</p>

<p><b>Tuesday 28 September 1897</b>
</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><b>5.3 Montevideo</b>
</p>

<p>Sept 28th, Tuesday. On the morning of mother's birthday, Mr.
Turner sent us a message about 5.30 from on deck to see Montevideo
in the sunrise. It is a large place, with various towers and domes
and crowds of shipping everywhere on the muddy water. No hills,
only a long, low line of coast. Near us was an Uruguayan man-of-war
and also the masts of a wreck with one or two tugs fussing around
her. There appeared to be steamers of all nationalities all around
us.</p>

<p>Our tender did not come alongside with the health officer and
our letters till about 10 o'clock and we had watched all the
previous ones in vain. It only brought us one postcard, but that
was sufficient to tell us our relations were alive.</p>

<p class="nowudont">{P74}</p>

<p>The captain was much annoyed at having to wait till 12 next day
for the mails, and so lose all the time we had gained. We went on
shore when the tug left, as did also a certain female from the
lower class whose efforts at fraternizing had been successfully
nipped in the bud by us, during the previous three weeks.</p>

<p>Some the second class people were very tiresome, wanting to come
in our part, as the ship was so empty, and this lady (a dancing
mistress), an elderly spinster, was polite enough to ask us to tea
which C. considered great cheek. We declined. I think we were the
only people who slept on shore. We went to what we were told was
the best hotel, a large, cold, rather badly drained building, built
round two courts.</p>

<p>All the houses in Montevideo are built round these "patios." It
is very like Turin, large squares with arcades round, and seats and
trees in the middle. It is very hot and glary. The cathedral and
the other large church, San Francisco, are all stucco and profusely
ornamental with dolls in fine clothes. Even the crucifix was
dressed up in some tinsel or other.</p>

<p class="nowudont">{P75}</p>

<p>We spent most of the day poking about and bought one or two
things. Charlie made a little sketch in the Piazza del
Independencia and soon had a large crowd around us, dispersed by a
policeman about four feet high. The men are small, the women
enormously fat. All the Spanish ladies paint, which gives them a
most sickly appearance. They dress very well, in rather bright
colours, and walk languidly about, showing them off.</p>

<p>Of course all the poorer women were in black, with mantillas.
They do not paint. We were struck by the numbers of people in
mourning, but were told they had lost friends in the revolution,
which had only come to an end the Sunday before. The president was
shot just before we started from New Zealand. Many of the shop
windows were full of firearms and knives. Nearly everyone carries a
revolver. Some of the Spanish girls are really very pretty, before
they get too fat. They have very arched black eyebrows, dark eyes
and nearly all of them a most becoming little black line outlining
their upper lip.</p>

<p class="nowudont">{P76}</p>

<p>We had a most excellent dinner at our hotel and drank mother's
health in Spanish claret. Next morning we prowled about a little
more and went into the cathedral again.</p>

<p>The tender did not start punctually, but we got back to our ship
about a quarter to one, and found it in possession of a large crowd
of strangers and the captain fuming at being kept waiting. Some of
the people were seeing friends off, but a good many remained when
these were gone. A large number of ladies and children and a few
men in the first saloon.</p>

<p>Five of the ladies are grass widows and there are also a nice
little lady with a husband and two babies (a Mrs. Garland) on their
way back to settle in England and a Mr. and Mrs. Nicholson! She is
a Creole and they don't seem quite so vulgar as some of the others.
None of the ladies seem to miss their husbands much, except a Mrs.
Harcourt, a doctor's wife, with a sweet little baby girl. Judging
from the manners of some of them I should think they were glad to
be independent and I should certainly be the same were I their
husband!</p>

<p class="nowudont">{P77}</p>

<p>It was a little rough that night, but nothing to what it was
next day, when it blew a regular gale and there was no peace or
quietness anywhere. All that day and the next night the rain poured
and the ship had hard work to make any way against a strong
headwind, with the sea running mountainous high. Every minute, seas
swept over the deck on the starboard side, and the forecastle, as
the captain informed me, had hundreds of tons of water over it
every minute.</p>

<p>It was not a pleasant experience in the beautiful large deck
cabin into which we had most kindly been moved by the good offices
of Mr. Turner. The captain also was most anxious to give it [to] us
but a little afraid of a certain passenger connected with the
office. However it was all right, and of course we had the best
night's rest of anyone on board.</p>

<p>It was impossible to go out of the cabin by its own door without
being swamped so the other one, through the Captain's 2-cabin, was
opened for us. Even there I could not get along the deck without
help, the ship rolled and pitched so.</p>

<p class="nowudont">{P78}</p>

<p>Poor Charlie was ill whenever he attempted to move, so he stayed
on his bunk all day. I went down to all the meals, except tea. I
was really afraid to venture there as there was no one there to
help me. Two of the ladies struggled down to part of breakfast and
lunch and also two men, besides the officers, but at dinner I sat
with the captain at one end of the long table and the ship's
officers and two other men, for half the meal, at the other, with a
long space covered with flying apples, sliding dishes, capsized
salt cellars, and drifts of knives and forks against the edges of
the fiddles, between us.</p>

<p>The captain was very depressed about losing so much time. One of
the men had got washed half through a port on the deck and would
have been drowned if Mr. Turner had not seen him. He was badly hurt
and is still laid up. I sat out on the port side till eleven, when
I was getting so wet through all my wraps that I came in, but the
sea was grand to watch, and I was lashed on to the seat, so quite
safe.</p>

<p class="nowudont">{P79}</p>

<p>It was an immense relief, after a wakeful night, getting very
bruised about the knees by the incessant rolling, to find the sun
shining in the morning and the wind dropped, though it was still
pretty rough. By the afternoon most of the passengers struggled up
on deck and the next day I think everyone was all right again.</p>

<p><b>Sunday 19 September 1897</b>
</p>

<p>Sunday 19th was a lovely day as, indeed, the weather has
continued to be ever since. It has been very amusing making out who
everybody is etc. Mr. Turner comes to us with wonderful tales and
we get a good deal of fun out of various episodes with the doctor,
who has come out as a great ladies man, and looks more foolish than
ever.</p>

<p>Charlie and I sit on the top deck, remote from the cackle which
goes on below, and draw and amuse ourselves in our own way. There
is an awning spread, and a most lovely breeze blowing, which makes
one forget we are in the tropics. I have made more friends with
Mrs. Garland over her baby than with anyone. Most of them are so
un-English and seem to think <span class="nowudont">{P80}</span>
Buenos Aires a far better place in every way than their native
land. But none of them are really congenial and we don't mind. We
are quite happy.</p>

<p><b>Saturday 2 October 1897</b>
</p>

<p>October 2nd, Saturday. We are to cross the Line today, and have
still the most lovely wind to keep us cool and have had our
trysails set for the last three or four days.</p>

<p>On Tuesday evening Mrs. Salmon, a very energetic young female,
induced the captain to have an awning put up on the port side and
enable us to have an impromptu dance. It was rather a fiasco, as
none of the men wanted to come. Miss W., the dancing mistress from
the second class, was in great form, and Charlie distinguished
himself manfully. I danced one set of lancers but it was much too
hot for any sensible person.</p>

<p>The next evening, however, was cooler and we had a very superior
affair, with flags all over the place, and such evening dress as
could be "got at" and a grand supper at eleven. Two of the stewards
played the piano and fiddle. It was a great success. Some of the
gentleman from the second class <span class="nowudont">{P81}</span>
came in white ties and "Baptist" coats and everybody was
very festive indeed.</p>

<p>The captain danced indefatigably. He is very stout. A mess
jacket is not the most becoming garb for a man of his size to caper
about in, but he was very jolly and good natured. I put on a tea
gown to avoid dancing, but enjoyed watching it, and seeing Charlie,
who made a complete conquest of Miss Walker and also had three
dances with the other good lady dancer, Mrs. Salmon. She dances
beautifully but is very silly, I think.</p>

<p>I went to bed a 11.30 and C. soon followed. He had worked hard.
It was very hot next day and they were painting the ship. I had a
splitting headache. Mrs. W. Nicholson was also bad, and Mrs.
Farrar. We none of us, came down to meals, but had our dinner
together on deck.</p>

<p>Mrs. Nicholson is fearfully delicate, always fainting. Yesterday
was our wedding day*. I was better and it was a very happy one. We
spent all day on the top, deck as usual.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Evelyn and Charles were married on 1 October
1895.]</p>

<p class="nowudont">{P82}</p>

<p>All the children on board got more or less garmed [<i>sic</i>]
with paint as the lower deck was being finished.</p>

<p>We finished off the sketches we had done for Mr. Turner and the
captain and presented them. Mr. Turner came and had some champagne
with us and we finished the last of our wedding cake. He is full of
the last story, re the Doctor, who has offended a second class
passenger and goes in fear of his life. I think it would do him
good to be kicked. He is such a fool and thinks everyone else
one.</p>

<p>Charlie and I went and looked at the stars from under the
bridge. We hope soon to see the Bear. I saw dear Orion again on
29th for the first time. We have seen no birds for four or five
days, nothing to look at but the flying fish, and yesterday we
passed a barque, English, but going the wrong way, poor thing.</p>

<p>This morning we have passed three ships, one with her top mast
broken off, perhaps in the storm. We are sitting on deck and the
children are ramping around. They are varnishing below and poor Mr.
Harper is trying in vain to clean brasses. This salt-wet air
discolours everything.</p>

<p class="nowudont">{P83}</p>

<p><b>Monday 4 October 1897</b>
</p>

<p>October 4th. On Saturday evening we went with Mr. Turner to the
forecastle and watched the phosphorous and moonlight on the waves.
Yesterday was Sunday, and a terribly hot day. Of course my head was
bad. The heat increased as the day went on and our cabin, for some
unknown reason, was one of the hottest at night. The sea was like
oil.</p>

<p>I went to sleep in the afternoon with a cold bandage on my head,
but nothing did one much good. In the evening I was better and we
spent the evening in the captain's cabin, where he showed us his
books and we had cool drinks. Everything possible is iced now. The
butter on this ship is much better than on the <i>Gothic</i> as is
the commissariat generally.</p>

<p>Yesterday and today I have seen one small bird, black with white
underneath, skimming over the oily sea. There was no wind at all
last night, nor is there any today, except what is made by the
ship, and the heat has been intolerable. I scarcely slept all night
and got up on deck very early, feeling faint and wretched. Mr.
Turner carried my chair on to the other deck, under the bridge,
where I got cooler and where I have spent most of <span class=
"nowudont">{P84}</span> the day. The captain had my breakfast
sent me there, which the stewardess did not at all appreciate.</p>

<p>Have been making friends with Miss Annie Jones, a superior
minded person, very different, I should say, to the somewhat vapid
"ladies" in this class. We do get so tired of hearing how
infinitely superior the Scotch are to any other nation (in the
opinion of our opposite neighbour, a plebeian person, and also of
the bounder aforesaid) and the captain has just told us, with a
sigh, how much he hopes the Scotch will have a place all to
themselves in the next world, a hope which, with a very few
exceptions, I echo.</p>

<p>I have been reading some of Kipling's poems, and especially like
Mr. Andrew's Hymn, which reminds me that Mr. Brown the Chief
Engineer showed us all over the engine room one day, in the cooler
part of the voyage. Both yesterday and today Charlie has read me a
long bit of Nansen which we have nearly finished.</p>

<p><b>Thursday 7 October 1897</b>
</p>

<p>Oct 7th, Thursday. On Monday evening about nine a breeze sprang
up and I got a better night by dint of turning my pillow to the
other end of the bunk <span class="nowudont">{P85}</span> and
getting all the air there was, but in the morning it was as hot as
ever. We spent nearly the whole day on the second class deck.
Charlie read to me there, in the afternoon, and I watched the two
little Buckley babies, who their father tries to keep in order, by
tying a string around them and holding the end. When a boy goes too
far he give a tug and the infant yells lustily. They have nothing
to play with, so I conceived the brilliant idea of making them rag
dolls stuffed with rope yarn Mr. Harper gave me, and nearly
finished one that evening.</p>

<p>I determined to sleep well at night, so Charlie brought out some
cushions and I reclined on the bench outside our door, till a late
hour, Mr. Turner talking to as usual, iced drinks etc.</p>

<p>The "scandal ends" are becoming more preposterous than ever! Mr.
Turner even appears to have his "hair curled" occasionally and, as
for me, well I never met people like this before. Their
conversation would not be so out of place in a servant's hall,
though it is a libel on respectable servants to say so. There are
about four who I am thinking of. I am very amiable to all and
<span class="nowudont">{P86}</span> so is Charlie, but they
don't like us a bit and I should be very sorry if they did.</p>

<p>Whether it was the lemon squash, or the cushions, or our
prolonged gossip, I don't know, but I slept well after listening,
to a late hour, to Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;'s wearisome voice and the
giggles of herself and another lady who profess to find it too hot
downstairs. I think, myself, that the opportunity of displaying
themselves in white dressing gowns with their hair down and bare
feet, to about six men, long after the captain had gone to bed and
given them a broad hint to do ditto, had more to do with it, than
the delights of sleeping in the music room.</p>

<p>Wednesday was much cooler, in fact the wind early was almost too
strong, but it got very hot later and was quite cold again at
night. We sat on the lower deck as there were too many smuts* on
the upper one. I worked most of the day at the dolls, which were
highly successful, and much appreciated. One was a lady in a pink
hood and the other a nigger boy, with a striped silk garment, and
dear little black feet.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* smut: a small flake of soot &mdash;
presumably from the coal burned in the ship's engine.]</p>

<p>When I presented them, Mr. B. began telling me about
<span class="nowudont">{P87}</span> his wife and how she ought
to have been well long ago, and leading the subject up to the
doctor, but I changed it. It is the first time I have spoken to
him.</p>

<p>In the evening I talked to Captain Patmore, son of Coventry
Patmore, a queer man and rather a l&mdash;r* I am afraid, but a
gentleman. He was on the <i>Britannia</i> the same time as Leonard
and Seymour Dacres. When he went off, I joined C. and Mr. Turner
and we had an amusing conversation till bedtime.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* l&mdash;r: Probably "liar."]</p>

<p>Today the sea is very calm again, the sun bright, a delicious
warm wind blowing and we must have crossed the line of the Tropic
this afternoon, so expect no more hot weather. The day has been one
of events. We were all photographed in the boiling sun this morning
by "the American gentleman" (a bag-man in point of fact). The group
was kept waiting while two ladies were dressing themselves and the
baby in their best, an effort which one fears will be wasted in a
midget photograph!</p>

<p>The feud between the Doctor and Mr. Buckley came to a crisis
this morning. I believe "Docky" has not ventured on to the
<span class="nowudont">{P88}</span> second class deck since the
declaration of hostilities (when Mr. B. has been there) till this
morning when Mr. Buckley, having shouted through the skylight to
some of the passengers to come up and see fair play, went for him
and "blacked his eye," a most foolish proceeding as the doctor had
him on the floor in a minute, and was holding him down, when Mr.
Turner was called by the Captain to separate them.</p>

<p>I believe Miss Walker, having a front seat at the time, is
envied and hated by all the other second class passengers and I
would have given anything to see it. The Captain informed me, as an
immense joke, that he had bound Mr. Buckley over to keep the peace
but Docky is still in a most bloodthirsty humour. I met him
surrounded by an admiring circle of ladies, with a swollen cheek
(his appearance rendered still more interesting by having cut
himself while shaving), and got him to tell me his account of the
affair. He is quite a hero today and I see him, as I write,
interrupting a most interesting tête-à-tête with further
details.</p>

<p>The Scotchwoman, <span class="nowudont">{P89}</span>
aforesaid, is the worst flirt on board. As far as I can see, her
only charms consist in being able to walk well, and possessing
pretty feet, which she exhibits a good deal, and a perfectly
unlimited supply of brass.</p>

<p>Charlie has been working hard all the day, except reading to me
and finishing Nansen. Mrs. Nicholson thinks he must be making his
fortune, "he is so plodding." They do not seem to think him mad, as
they did on the <i>Gothic</i>, as he was the only hard working
person on board&mdash;but they think us a hopelessly dull couple, I
am sure.</p>

<p><b>Monday 11 October 1897</b>
</p>

<p>Oct 11th. We sat out and talked to Mr. Turner, as usual that
evening, and slept much better, owing to the coolness. The next day
was lovely and, as the awning was not taken down till night, we sat
on deck all the day, except part of the morning, when we got
through a little packing, Charlie working hard at plans, all his
spare time.</p>

<p>I talked to Miss Rogers a little, as we also did the night
before, she having been cut by the other ladies for some unknown
reason. We passed, about 4 o'clock, the huge steamer, <span class=
"nowudont">{P90}</span> <i>Delphic</i>, the new and largest
White Star boat on this line.</p>

<p><a name="teneriffe-54" id="teneriffe-54"></a>
</p>

<p>8 October 1897</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><b>5.4 Teneriffe</b>
</p>

<p>About five we arrived at Teneriffe. I believe I was the first
person on board who saw land in the morning. About 11 o'clock, I
distinctly saw the left hand slope and peak of the Peak, but no one
(especially the doctor) would quite believe me at first. Sometime
later the Captain came, having just seen it, so I triumphed
considerably and the outline I had first seen never varied, but
grew more clear, as the hours passed. When quite near, C. and I
both sketched it about 2 pm.</p>

</p>

<p class="caption2">Peak of Teneriffe, 8 October, 1897</p>

<p>Teneriffe looks very pretty, as you come into it. I remembered
every point of the jagged hills. There had been some doubt about
our going on shore, as the agent at Montevideo had taken away the
bill of health by mistake, however the Health Officer who arrived,
almost directly, in a tiny boat, was most polite and took the
doctor's word for it that it was all right. Immediately we were
boarded by a motley throng, carrying birds in cages, fruit,
baskets, lace, embroidery, jewellery and all kinds of rubbish,
<span class="nowudont">{P91}</span> and the four coaling barges
came close at once and we began to coal through the ports.</p>

<p>I thought of nothing and looked at nothing but a small white
packet carried on board by the agent and handed to the Chief
Steward. We got our letters almost at once, and it was a joy to
have news, only a week old, after receiving none, since that dated
July 22nd. It was all good and we did not wait longer over our
fourteen letters, than to ascertain so much, then rushed down and,
after a very mild amount of bargaining over table cloths etc., we
got into one of the picturesque little three-oared boats, rocking
on the water, and were soon on shore to see all we could, in the
waning daylight, of the quaint town of Teneriffe.</p>

<p>Charlie walked me around to the principal objects of interest
and the points of his former sketches. I was most dreadfully tired
and glad to rest in the quiet dark cathedral (lit only by eight
candles at various angles), the tower of which is very grand and
original. The town is most picturesque, reminding me of
<span class="nowudont">{P92}</span> Mentone, with its narrow
streets and whitewashed house and green shutters, with the heaps of
jagged hilltops through the street openings, but it has one or two
characteristically individual features. All the doors are panelled
with small square diamond-shaped or octagonal panels and most of
the houses have balcony windows overhanging the street, carved and
panelled, or shuttered with lattice-work, all painted green.</p>

<p>They make great use of lattice work in the patios. Many of the
chimneys are quite Venetian in shape. Charlie and I were beset by a
most persistent tout, in the shape of a boy, who even interrupted
our moonlight tête-à-tête in the gardens, which otherwise we much
enjoyed.</p>

<p>We had dinner at the famous Comachio's, a lengthy affair which
gave us plenty of time to read our letters, between the courses.
The food was not as good as on the ship, but the wine was
excellent. We sat in the patio afterwards and had a long talk. It
was so nice to be quite all to ourselves.</p>

<p>At the boats we met the other passengers who <span class=
"nowudont">{P93}</span> had come on shore, among others Miss
Jones, with whom we sat and talked in the shelter of the coaling
screens, when we at last got back to our ship. She looked so pretty
in the moonlight as we came near. We passed very close in under the
stern. We did not go to bed till past eleven as the coaling was
still going on, but sat and talked, first to Miss Jones, then to
Mr. Vine, and then to each other. When we did go to bed we could
not sleep. We talked till late and I did not get to sleep till
after the ship started at 1 o'clock.</p>

<p><b>Saturday 9 October 1897</b>
</p>

<p>On Saturday we settled down into our normal state only, of
course, everything was much quieter than usual. The weather was
lovely, but everything got very damp all these last few days,
especially yesterday. Charlie sat and worked on the upper deck and
I sat with him and read a book of Manning's, the Captain had lent
me. In the afternoon we sat on the lower deck and I slept most of
the time. We had a long walk and talk there in the evening and
finished up by a talk to Mrs. Turner. The "scandal ends" are
becoming worse than ever.</p>

<p class="nowudont">{P94}</p>

<p>Yesterday it was still fine and we passed one sailing ship. We
had a long walk on the poop, before service, which was held, as
usual, at 10.30. Mrs. Farrar asked me afterwards if I did not think
it was a beautiful little service. What I did think was that, of
all the vices, I think the one I detest most is hypocrisy, but I
know this sounds very uncharitable!</p>

<p>Charlie drew a lovely cover for the newspaper, which Mr. Cowan
and Mr. Garland were getting up. I read some of the many papers
sent and lent to us. In the evening we had a longer talk than usual
with Mr. Turner, who showed us a letter sent from Waterloo by his
grandfather, after the battle.</p>

<p>Today it rained all the morning, but we have had a lovely
sunset. We spent some time in Mr. Turner's cabin this morning,
looking at all the ships books, logs etc. This afternoon I have
derived a good deal of amusement from watching, and joining in,
practising for an entertainment this evening. People's characters
declare themselves in these things! Charlie working hard at plans
all day. <span class="nowudont">{P95}</span> I packed nearly all
the rest of my things and the "provision" basket.</p>

<p><b>Tuesday 12 October 1897</b>
</p>

<p>Tuesday Oct 12. The "entertainment" last night was a remarkable
affair. We sat by Mr. Turner, whose comments added to our
amusement. There were various plantation songs, and also efforts at
solos by most incompetent performers. Mrs. W. A. Nicholson played a
piece upon the tin kettle, which served as a piano, which was a
distinct improvement on the original, as all the top notes were
dumb. Mr. Vine played a flute solo, as did Docky in the "interval,"
a performance wildly cheered to cover the confusion of the
audience, who had all been choking with laughter.</p>

<p>Mrs. Garland was so overcome she had to go, and Charlie covered
his face with his hands. The best things were some conjuring tricks
by Mr. Blackwell, the Chief Steward. Miss Walker did a fan dance
well. One wished she had been somewhat younger and less scraggy. I
had to listen to a lot of complaints later from Mr. W. A. N. (who
is a well-meaning bounder) about the Captain's absence <span class=
"nowudont">{P96}</span> and, in fact, so many people have been
talking about it today that I have been taking up the cudgels for
that worthy most of the time. I hope it does any good.</p>

<p>They would probably prefer a man more of their own stamp, as was
Captain Kidley. One cannot expect them to appreciate either a
gentleman or a cultivated man. Poor old Captain, he often says to
me he wishes we could have gone on as we were before Montevideo.
Some of the junior officers, however, seem to prefer the present
state of things.</p>

<p>Today has been a lovely day, bright sun and an English-feeling
wind, drying the decks and invigorating our somewhat enervated
selves. I had a long talk with little Mrs. Garland this morning and
then knitted while C. worked. Mr. Turner also came and talked. Mr.
Harper looks very happy at the prospect of being clean again soon.
He braves public (sailors') opinion now more than ever and talks to
us whenever he gets a chance.</p>

<p>This afternoon there has been a "wedding" party of children
given by the third officer.</p>

<p class="nowudont">{P97}</p>

<p><b>Wednesday 13 October 1897</b>
</p>

<p>Wednesday, Oct 13th. Today has been a lovely day and I am now
resting at 5 pm, all the packing being practically finished, and
most of the passengers being employed in looking out for the first
signs of land. I don't think they'll see any yet, as we don't
expect to be at Plymouth before ten. We are getting dreadfully
excited.</p>

<p>Last night there was a more than usually festive dinner and C.
and I had a bottle of champagne for the Captain's benefit. He is
quite low spirited today at parting with us and says he shall not
come down to meals any more. C. did the menu, on the back of which
everyone in the first saloon signed their names. Up till 10 p.m. he
was busy finishing his writing, while I talked to Mr. Turner.</p>

<p>This morning the paper came out and an auction was held on the
middle deck, of the eleven copies by Mr. Garland, which was most
amusing. We got one. Most of it is rubbish, but there are some good
things. All the ladies are <span class="nowudont">{P98}</span>
very amiable to each other now, in the prospect of so soon parting,
and as their packing occupies them more than flirting, they are
less objectionable than a few days ago.</p>

<p><a name="england-55" id="england-55"></a>
</p>

<p class="date-jnl"><b>5.5 England</b>
</p>

<p>The captain and Mr. Turner are very kindly sorry to lose us, but
it is worth anything to get twenty-four extra hours of England and
possibly of Harry. Joyful thought!</p>

<p><i>Later</i>. As we got nearer we became more and more excited
and after dinner, (at which meal none of the officers were
present), Charlie sat in the smoking room and illustrated nearly a
whole pack of cards, for the benefit of the other gentlemen. I sat
in there and watched him. Then we adjourned to Mr. Turner's cabin
and had a final haver* with him (and he and Charlie whiskies and
sodas!) till we came up to the Eddystone and we rushed up just too
late to see the pilot come on board.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* haver: a foolish or nonsense talk]</p>

<p>The cutter was dancing on the waves in the moonlight and we soon
left her, and the tiny boat, and the lighthouse, far behind and in
a very short time saw land again. <span class="nowudont">{P99}</span>
The whole of the first and second class passengers,
ourselves included, worked, off their excited feelings by singing
"Rule Britannia" and "God Save the Queen" on the poop, several
times, and some of them danced and Charlie did the cobblers dance
for the benefit of Mrs. Garland and myself, in a remote corner,
which did us a great deal of good!</p>

<p>At last we were anchored, our letters on board, (all good news),
and the tender waiting to take us and a few others on shore. It was
quite sad to say goodbye, especially to our dear ship, which we
watched steaming quickly off, till the last speck of light
disappeared around the point.</p>

<p>After four hours sleep at the Duke of Cornwall Hotel we once
more found ourselves in the train, passing the dear green fields
again and reading the following in the Western Gazette:</p>

<p class="newspaper">At eleven o'clock last evening the New Zealand
Shipping Company's steamer <i>Tongariro</i>, Captain H. Mayoss,
arrived in Plymouth Sound from Wellington, N.Z., September 2nd,
Montevideo 22nd, and Teneriffe October 9th. Fair weather was
experienced throughout the passage , which occupied 40 days 10
hours. The <i>Tongariro</i> brought 64 passengers, 14 boxes of
specie value £16,386, four sacks of mails, 31 boxes of post
parcels, 21,005 carcases of mutton, 15,000 legs of mutton, 902
cases of butter, and 960 bales of wool. After landing twelve
passengers, the mails and post parcels, the <i>Tongariro</i> was
cleared at 11.50 p.m. by Mr. A. Ward (Henry J. Waring and Co.) for
London. The follwoing vessels were spoken during the
voyage:&mdash;On October 1st, <i>Still Water</i>, barque steering

people and places which she had seen, covering the period 14 June
1897 to 13 October 1897*.</p>
