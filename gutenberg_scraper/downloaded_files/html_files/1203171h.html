  <h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

  <p>Reginald Philip Graham Thursford, Baron Travers, Marquis of Mandeleys,
  issued, one May morning, from the gloomy precincts of the Law Courts without
  haste, yet with certain evidences of a definite desire to leave the place
  behind him. He crossed first the pavement and then the street, piloted here
  and there by his somewhat obsequious companion, and turned along the Strand,
  westwards. Then, in that democratic thoroughfare, for the first time since
  the calamity had happened, his lips were unlocked in somewhat singular
  fashion.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm damned!" he exclaimed, with slow and significant emphasis.</p>

  <p>His companion glanced up furtively in his direction. The Marquis, as
  Marquises should be, was very tall and slim, with high well-shaped nose, very
  little flesh upon his face, a mouth of uncertain shape and eyes of uncertain
  colour. His companion, as solicitors to the aristocracy should be, was of a
  smaller, more rotund and insignificant shape. He had the healthy complexion,
  however, of the week-end golfer, and he affected a certain unlegal rakishness
  of attire, much in vogue amongst members of his profession having connections
  in high circles. In his heart he very much admired the ease and naturalness
  with which his patron, in the heart of professional London, strode along by
  his side in a well-worn tweed suit, a collar of somewhat ancient design, and
  a tie which had seen better days.</p>

  <p>"The judge's decision was, without doubt, calamitous," he confessed
  gloomily.</p>

  <p>The Marquis turned in at the Savoy courtyard with the air of an
  habitu&eacute;.</p>

  <p>"I am in need of a brief rest and some refreshment," he said. "You will
  accompany me, if you please, Mr. Wadham."</p>

  <p>The lawyer acquiesced and felt somehow that he had become the tail end of
  a procession, the Marquis's entrance and progress through the grillroom
  towards the smoking-room bar was marked by much deference on the part of
  porters, cloak-room attendants and waiters, a deference acknowledged in the
  barest possible fashion, yet in a manner which his satellite decided to make
  a study of. They reached a retired corner of the smoking room, where the
  Marquis subsided into the only vacant easy chair, ordered for himself a glass
  of dry sherry, and left his companion to select his own refreshment and pay
  for both.</p>

  <p>"What," the former enquired, "is the next step?"</p>

  <p>"There is, alas!" Mr. Wadham replied, "no next step."</p>

  <p>"Exactly what do you mean by that?" the Marquis demanded, knitting his
  brows slightly as he sipped his sherry.</p>

  <p>"We have reached the end," the lawyer pronounced. "The decision given by
  the Court to-day is final."</p>

  <p>The Marquis set down his glass. The thing was absurd!</p>

  <p>"Surely," he suggested, "the House of Lords remains?"</p>

  <p>"Without a doubt, your lordship," Mr. Wadham assented, "but it is of no
  use to us in the present instance. The judge of the Supreme Court&mdash;this
  is, by-the-by, our third appeal&mdash;has delivered a final decision."</p>

  <p>The Marquis seemed vaguely puzzled.</p>

  <p>"The House of Lords," he persisted, "remains surely a Court of Appeal for
  members of my order whose claims to consideration are not always fully
  recognised in the democracy of the common law court."</p>

  <p>"I fear," Mr. Wadham replied, with a little cough, "that the House of
  Lords is supposed to have other functions."</p>

  <p>"Other functions?"</p>

  <p>"In an indirect sort of fashion," Mr. Wadham continued, "it is supposed to
  assist in the government of the country."</p>

  <p>"God bless my soul!" the Marquis exclaimed.</p>

  <p>There was a queer, intangible silence. The lawyer was quite aware that a
  storm was brewing, but as his distinguished client never lost his temper or
  showed annoyance in any of the ordinary plebeian ways, he was conscious of
  some curiosity as to what might happen next.</p>

  <p>"You mean to say, then," the Marquis continued, "that for the rest of my
  days, and in the days of those who may succeed me, that edifice, that cottage
  which for generations has sheltered one of the family retainers, is to remain
  the property of&mdash;of an alien?"</p>

  <p>"I fear that that is the decision of the court," the lawyer admitted. "The
  deed of gift was exceptionally binding."</p>

  <p>The Marquis shook his head. The thing was incomprehensible.</p>

  <p>"I can stand upon the roof of Mandeleys," he said, "and I can look north,
  south, east and west, and in no direction can I look off my own land. Yet you
  mean to tell me that almost in my garden there is to remain a demesne which
  can be occupied by any Tom, Dick or Harry which its nominal owner chooses to
  place in possession?"</p>

  <p>The lawyer signed to the waiter for their glasses to be replenished.</p>

  <p>"It is certainly not justice, your lordship," he admitted,&mdash;"it is
  not even reasonable&mdash;but it is the law."</p>

  <p>The Marquis produced a gold cigarette case, absently lit a cigarette, and
  returned the case to his pocket without offering it to his companion. He
  smoked meditatively and sipped his second glass of sherry.</p>

  <p>"A state of things," he declared, "has been revealed to me which I cannot
  at present grasp. I must discuss the matter with Robert&mdash;with my
  son-in-law, Sir Robert Lees. He is an intensely modern person, and he may be
  able to suggest something."</p>

  <p>"Sir Robert is a very clever man," the lawyer acknowledged, "but failing
  an arrangement with the tenant himself, I cannot see that there is anything
  further to be done. We have, in short, exhausted the law."</p>

  <p>"A process," the Marquis observed sympathetically, "which I fear that you
  must have found expensive, Mr. Wadham."</p>

  <p>"The various suits into which we have entered on behalf of your lordship,
  and the costs which we have had to pay," the latter hastened to announce,
  "amount, I regret to say, to something over eighteen thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>"Dear me!" his companion sighed. "It seems quite a great deal of
  money."</p>

  <p>"Since we are upon the subject," the lawyer proceeded, "my firm has
  suggested that I should approach your lordship with regard to some means
  of&mdash;pardon me&mdash;reducing the liability in question."</p>

  <p>So far as the face of Mr. Wadham's client was capable of expressing
  anything, it expressed now a certain amount of surprise.</p>

  <p>"It appears to me, Mr. Wadham," he remarked, "that you are asking me to
  attend to your business for you."</p>

  <p>The lawyer knitted his brows in puzzled fashion.</p>

  <p>"I am not sure that I quite follow your lordship," he murmured.</p>

  <p>"Do I employ you," his patron continued, "to manage my estates, to control
  my finances, to act as agent to all my properties, and yet need to keep a
  perspective myself of my various assets? If eighteen thousand pounds is
  required, it is for your firm to decide from what quarter the money should
  come. Personally, as you know, I never interfere."</p>

  <p>Mr. Wadham coughed in somewhat embarrassed fashion.</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact, your lordship," he confessed, with a most illogical
  sense that it was his duty to apologise for his client's impecuniosity, "as a
  matter of fact, neither my partners nor I can at the present moment see where
  a sum of eighteen thousand pounds can be raised."</p>

  <p>The Marquis rose to his feet and shook the cigarette ash carefully from
  his coat.</p>

  <p>"Our conversation, Mr. Wadham," he said, "is reaching a stage which bores
  me. I have just remembered, too," he added, with a glance at the clock, "that
  my daughter is entertaining a few friends to lunch. You must write to
  Merridrew. He is really a most excellent agent. He will tell you what
  balances are likely to be available during the next few months."</p>

  <p>Mr. Wadham received the suggestion without enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>"We made an application to Mr. Merridrew some few weeks ago," he remarked,
  "as we needed some ready money for the purpose of briefing the barristers.
  Mr. Merridrew's reply was not encouraging."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" the Marquis murmured. "Merridrew is a gloomy dog sometimes. Try him
  again. It is astonishing how elastic he can be if he is squeezed."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid your lordship has done all the squeezing," the solicitor
  observed ruefully.</p>

  <p>A little trill of feminine laughter rang through the room. Two smartly
  attired young ladies were seated upon a divan near the door, surrounded by a
  little group of acquaintances. One of them leaned forward and nodded as the
  Marquis and his companion passed.</p>

  <p>"How do you do, Marquis?" she said, in distinctly transatlantic
  accents.</p>

  <p>The behaviour of his client, under such circumstances, remained an object
  lesson to Mr. Wadham for the rest of his life. The Marquis gazed with the
  faintest expression of surprise at, or perhaps through, the young person who
  had addressed him. Fumbling for a moment in his waistcoat pocket, he raised a
  horn-rimmed monocle to his eye, dropped it almost at once, and passed on
  without the flicker of an eyelid. On their way to the outside door, however,
  he shook his head gravely.</p>

  <p>"What a singular exhibition," he murmured,&mdash;"demonstration, perhaps I
  should say&mdash;of the crudeness of modern social intercourse! Was it my
  fancy, Wadham, or did the young person up there address me?"</p>

  <p>"She certainly did," the other assented. "She even called you by
  name."</p>

  <p>They were standing in the courtyard now, waiting for a taxi, and the
  Marquis sighed.</p>

  <p>"In a public place, too!" he murmured. "Wadham, I am afraid that we are
  living in the wrong age. I came to that conclusion only a few days ago, when
  I was invited, actually invited, to dine at the house of&mdash; But I forget,
  Wadham, I forget. Your grandfather would appreciate these things. You
  yourself are somewhat imbued, I fear, with the modern taint. A handful of
  silver, if you please," he added, holding out his hand. "I am not accustomed
  to these chance conveyances."</p>

  <p>The lawyer searched his trousers pockets, and produced a couple of pink
  notes and a few half-crowns. In some mysterious fashion, the whole seemed to
  pass into the Marquis's long, aristocratic hand. He turned to the porter who
  was standing bare-headed, and slipped a ten-shilling note into his palm.</p>

  <p>"Well, good morning, Wadham," he said, stepping into his taxicab. "I have
  no doubt that you did your best, but this morning's unfortunate happening
  will take me some time to get over. My compliments to your senior partner.
  You can say that I am disappointed&mdash;no more."</p>

  <p>The Marquis crossed his legs and leaned back in the vehicle. Mr. Wadham
  remained upon the pavement, gazing for a moment at his empty hand.</p>

  <p>"Taxi, sir?" the hall porter asked obsequiously.</p>

  <p>Mr. Wadham felt in all his pockets.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," he replied gloomily, "I'll walk."</p><br>

  <h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

  <p>Lady Letitia Thursford, the only unmarried daughter of the Marquis, stood
  in a corner of the spacious drawing-room at 94 Grosvenor Square, talking to
  her brother-in-law. Sir Robert, although he wanted his luncheon very badly
  and, owing to some mistake, had come a quarter of an hour too soon, retained
  his customary good nature. He always enjoyed talking to his favourite
  relation-in-law.</p>

  <p>"I say, Letty," he remarked, screwing his eyeglass into his eye and
  looking around, "you're getting pretty shabby here, eh?"</p>

  <p>Lady Letitia smiled composedly.</p>

  <p>"That is the worst of you <i>nouveaux riches</i>," she declared. "You do
  not appreciate the harmonising influence of the hand of Time. This isn't
  shabbiness, it's tone."</p>

  <p>"<i>Nouveaux riches</i>, indeed!" he repeated. "Better not let your father
  hear you call me names!"</p>

  <p>"Father wouldn't care a bit," she replied. "As for this drawing-room,
  Robert, well, sixty years ago it must have been hideous. To-day I rather like
  it. It is absolutely and entirely Victorian, even to the smell."</p>

  <p>Sir Robert sniffed vigorously.</p>

  <p>"I follow you," he agreed. "Old lavender perfume, ottomans, high-backed
  chairs, chintzes that look as though they came out of the ark, and a few
  mouldy daguerreotypes. The whole thing's here, all right."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it's just as well for us that it is," she observed. "I have come
  to the conclusion that furniture people are the least trustful in the world.
  I don't think even dad could get a van-load of furniture on credit."</p>

  <p>Sir Robert nodded sympathetically. He was a pleasant-looking man, a little
  under middle age, with bright, alert expression, black hair and moustache,
  and perhaps a little too perfectly dressed. He just escaped being called
  dapper.</p>

  <p>"Chucking a bit more away in the Law Courts, isn't he?"</p>

  <p>Letitia indulged in a little grimace.</p>

  <p>"Not even you could make him see reason about that," she sighed. "He is
  certain to lose his case, and it must be costing him thousands."</p>

  <p>"Dashed annoying thing," Sir Robert remarked meditatively, "to have a
  cottage within a hundred yards of your hall door which belongs to some one
  else."</p>

  <p>"It is annoying, of course," Letitia assented, "but there is no doubt
  whatever that Uncle Christopher made it over to the Vonts absolutely, and I
  don't see how we could possibly upset the deed of gift. I am now," she
  continued, moving towards a stand of geraniums and beginning to snip off some
  dead leaves, "about to conclude the picture. You behold the maiden of bygone
  days who condescended sometimes to make herself useful."</p>

  <p>The scissors snipped energetically, and Sir Robert watched his
  sister-in-law. She was inclined to be tall, remarkably graceful in a fashion
  of her own, a little pale, with masses of brown hair, and eyes which defied
  any sort of colour analysis. But what Sir Robert chiefly loved about her were
  the two little lines of humour at the corners of her firm, womanly mouth.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you're in the setting all right, Letty," he declared, "and yet you
  are rather puzzling. Just now you look as though you only wanted the
  crinoline and the little curls to be some one's grandmother in her youth. Yet
  at that picture show the other night you were quite the most modern thing
  there."</p>

  <p>"It's just how I'm feeling," she confided, with a little sigh, standing
  back and surveying her handiwork. "I have that rare gift, you know, Robert,
  of governing my personality from inside. When I am in this room, I feel
  Victorian, and I am Victorian. When I hear that Russian man's music which is
  driving every one crazy just now&mdash;well, I feel and I suppose I look
  different. Here's Meg coming. How well she looks!"</p>

  <p>They watched the motor-car draw up outside, and the little business of
  Lady Margaret Lees's descent carried out in quite the best fashion. A footman
  stood at the door, a grey-haired butler in plain clothes adventured as far as
  the bottom step; behind there was just the suggestion of something in
  livery.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Meg's all right," Sir Robert replied. "Jolly good wife she is, too.
  Why don't you marry, Letty?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," she laughed, leaning a little towards him, "because I did not
  go to a certain house party at Raynham Court, three years ago."</p>

  <p>"Are you conceited enough," he inquired, "to imagine that I should have
  chosen you instead of Meg, if you had been there?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I should have been a little too young," she admitted. "Why
  haven't you a brother, Robert?"</p>

  <p>"I don't believe you'd have married him, if I had," he answered bluntly.
  "I'm not really your sort, you know."</p>

  <p>Lady Margaret swept in, very voluble but a little discursive.</p>

  <p>"Isn't this just like Bob!" she exclaimed. "I believe he always comes here
  early on purpose to find you alone, Letty! Who's coming to lunch, please? And
  where's dad?"</p>

  <p>"Father should be on his way home from the Law Courts by now," Letitia
  replied, "and I am afraid it's a very dull luncheon for you, Meg. Aunt
  Caroline is coming, and an American man she travelled over on the steamer
  with. I am not quite sure whether she expects to let Bayfield to him or offer
  him to me as a husband, but I am sure she has designs."</p>

  <p>"The Duchess is always so helpful," Robert grunted.</p>

  <p>"So long as it costs her nothing," Lady Margaret declared, "nothing makes
  her so happy as to put the whole world to rights."</p>

  <p>"Here she comes&mdash;in a taxicab, too," Sir Robert announced, looking
  out of the window. "She is getting positively penurious."</p>

  <p>"She is probably showing off before the American," Lady Margaret remarked.
  "She is always talking about living in a semi-detached house and making her
  own clothes. Up to the present, though, she has stuck to Worth."</p>

  <p>The Duchess, who duly arrived a few moments later, brought with her into
  the room a different and essentially a more cosmopolitan atmosphere. She was
  a tall, fair woman, attractive in an odd sort of way, with large features, a
  delightful smile, and a habit of rapid speech. She exchanged hasty greetings
  with every one present and then turned back towards the man who had followed
  her into the room.</p>

  <p>"Letty dear, this is Mr. David Thain&mdash;Lady Letitia Thursford. I told
  you about Mr. Thain, dear, didn't I? This is almost his first visit to
  England, and I want every one to be nice to him. Mr. Thain, this is my other
  niece, Lady Margaret Lees, and her husband, Sir Robert Lees. Where's
  Reginald?"</p>

  <p>"Father will be here directly," Letitia replied. "If any one's famished,
  we can commence lunch."</p>

  <p>"Then let us commence, by all means," the Duchess suggested. "I have been
  giving the whole of the morning to Mr. Thain, improving his mind and showing
  him things. We wound up with the shops&mdash;although I am sure Alfred's
  tradespeople are no use to any one."</p>

  <p>Letitia moved a few steps towards the bell, and on her way back she
  encountered the somewhat earnest gaze of her aunt's prot&eacute;g&eacute;.
  Even in those few moments since his entrance, she had been conscious of a
  somewhat different atmosphere in the faded but stately room. He had the air
  of appraising everything yet belonging nowhere, of being wholly out of touch
  with an environment which he could scarcely be expected to understand or
  appreciate. He was not noticeably ill-at-ease. On the other hand, his
  deportment was too rigid for naturalness, and she was conscious of some
  quality in his rather too steadfast scrutiny of herself which militated
  strongly against her usual toleration. He seemed to stand for events, and in
  the lives which they mostly lived, events were ignored.</p>

  <p>The butler opened the door and announced luncheon. They crossed the very
  handsome, if somewhat empty hall, into the sombre, mahogany-furnished dining
  room, the walls of which were closely hung with oil paintings. Letitia
  motioned the stranger to sit at her right hand, and fancied that he seemed a
  little relieved at this brief escape from his cicerone. Having gone so far,
  however, she ignored him for several moments whilst she watched the seating
  of her other guests. Her brother-in-law she drew to the vacant place on her
  left.</p>

  <p>"I dare say father will lunch at the club," she whispered. "Aunt Caroline
  always ruffles him."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid he will have found something down Temple Bar way to ruffle
  him a great deal more this morning," Sir Robert replied.</p>

  <p>The door of the dining room was at that moment thrown open, however, and
  the Marquis entered. Pausing for a moment on the threshold, in line with a
  long row of dingy portraits, there was something distinctly striking in the
  family likeness so mercilessly reproduced in his long face, with the somewhat
  high cheek bones, his tall, angular figure, the easy bearing and gracious
  smile. One missed the snuffbox from between his fingers, and the uniform, but
  there was yet something curiously unmodern in the appearance of this last
  representative of the Mandeleys.</p>

  <p>"Let no one disturb themselves, pray," he begged. "I am a little late. My
  dear Caroline, I am delighted to see you," he went on, raising his sister's
  fingers to his lips. "Margaret, I shall make no enquiries about your health!
  You are looking wonderfully well to-day."</p>

  <p>The Duchess glanced towards her prot&eacute;g&eacute;, who had risen to
  his feet and stood facing his newly arrived host. There was a moment's
  poignant silence. The two men, for some reason or other, seemed to regard
  each other with no common interest.</p>

  <p>"This is my friend, Mr. David Thain," the Duchess announced,&mdash;"my
  brother, the Marquis of Mandeleys. Mr. Thain is an American, Reginald."</p>

  <p>The Marquis shook hands with his guest, a form of welcome in which he
  seldom indulged.</p>

  <p>"Any friend of yours, Caroline," he said quietly, "is very welcome to my
  house. Robert," he added, as he took his seat, "they tell me that you were
  talking rubbish about agriculture in the House last night. Why do you talk
  about agriculture? You know nothing about it. You are not even, so far as I
  remember, a landed proprietor."</p>

  <p>Sir Robert smiled.</p>

  <p>"And therefore, sir, I am unprejudiced."</p>

  <p>"No one can talk about land, nowadays, without being prejudiced," his
  father-in-law rejoined.</p>

  <p>"Father," Letitia begged, "do tell us about the case."</p>

  <p>The Marquis watched the whiskey and soda with which his glass was being
  filled.</p>

  <p>"The case, my dear," he acknowledged, "has, I am sorry to say, gone
  against me. A remarkably ill-informed and unattractive looking person, whom
  they tell me will presently be Lord Chief Justice, presumed not only to give
  a decision which was in itself quite absurd, but also refused leave to
  appeal."</p>

  <p>"Sorry to hear that, sir," Sir Robert remarked. "Cost you a lot of money,
  too, I'm afraid."</p>

  <p>"I believe that it has been an expensive case," the Marquis admitted. "My
  lawyer seemed very depressed about it."</p>

  <p>"And you mean to say that it's really all over and done with now?" Lady
  Margaret enquired.</p>

  <p>"For the present, it certainly seems so," the Marquis replied. "I cannot
  believe, personally, that the laws of my country afford me no relief, under
  the peculiar circumstances of the case. According to Mr. Wadham, however,
  they do not."</p>

  <p>"What is it all about, anyway, Reginald?" his sister asked. "I have heard
  more than once but I have forgotten. Whenever I look in the paper for a
  divorce case, I nearly always see your name against the King, or the King
  against you, with a person named Vont also interested. Surely the Vont family
  have been retainers down at Mandeleys for generations? I remember one of them
  perfectly well."</p>

  <p>The Marquis cleared his throat.</p>

  <p>"The unfortunate circumstances," he said, "are perhaps little known even
  amongst the members of my own family. Perhaps it will suffice if I say that,
  owing to an indiscretion of my uncle and predecessor, the eleventh Marquis, a
  gamekeeper's cottage and small plot of land, curiously situated in the shadow
  of Mandeleys, became the property of a yeoman of the name of Vont. This
  ill-advised and singular action of my late uncle is complicated by the fact
  that the inheritors of his bounty have become, as a family, inimical to their
  patrons. Their present representative, for instance, is obsessed by some real
  or fancied grievance upon which I scarcely care to dilate. For nearly twenty
  years," the Marquis continued ruminatively, "the cottage has been empty
  except for the presence of an elderly person who died some years ago. Since
  then I have, through my lawyers, endeavoured, both by purchase and by
  upsetting the deed of gift, to regain possession of the property. The legal
  owner appears to be domiciled in America, and as he has been able to resist
  my lawsuits and has refused all my offers of purchase, I gather that in that
  democratic country he has amassed a certain measure of wealth. We are now
  confronted with the fact that this person announces his intention of
  returning to England and taking up his residence within a few yards of my
  front door."</p>

  <p>Sir Robert laughed heartily.</p>

  <p>"Upon my word, sir," he exclaimed, "it's a humorous situation!"</p>

  <p>The Marquis was unruffled but bitter.</p>

  <p>"Your sense of humour, my dear Robert," he said, "suffers, I fear, from
  your daily associations in the House of Commons."</p>

  <p>The man by Letitia's side suddenly leaned forward. After the smooth and
  pleasant voice of the Marquis, his question, with its slight transatlantic
  accent, sounded almost harsh.</p>

  <p>"What did you say that man's name was, Marquis?"</p>

  <p>"Richard Vont," was the courteous reply. "The name is a singular one, but
  America is a vast country. I imagine it is scarcely possible that in the
  course of your travels you have come across a person so named?"</p>

  <p>"A man calling himself Richard Vont crossed in the steamer with me, three
  weeks ago," David Thain announced. "I have not the least doubt that this is
  the man who is coming to occupy the cottage you speak of."</p>

  <p>"It is indeed a small world," the Marquis remarked. "I will not inflict
  this family matter upon you all any longer. After lunch, perhaps, you will
  spare me a few moments of your time, Mr.&mdash;Mr. Thain. I shall be
  interested to hear more about this person."</p>

  <p>Letitia rose, presently, to leave the room. Whilst she waited for her aunt
  to conclude a little anecdote, she glanced with some interest at the man by
  her side. More than ever the sense of his incongruity with that atmosphere
  seemed borne in upon her, yet she was forced to concede to him,
  notwithstanding the delicacy of his appearance, a certain unexpected
  strength, a forcefulness of tone and manner, which gave him a certain
  distinction. He had risen, waiting for her passing, and one lean brown hand
  gripped the back of the chair in which she had been sitting. She carried away
  with her into the Victorian drawing-room, with its odour of faded lavender, a
  queer sense of having been brought into momentary association with stronger
  and more vital things in life.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

  <p>Sir Robert preferred to join his wife and sister-in-law in the
  drawing-room after luncheon. The Marquis, with a courteous word of
  invitation, led his remaining guest across the grey stone hall into the
  library beyond&mdash;a sparsely furnished and yet imposing looking apartment,
  with its great tiers of books and austere book cases. On his way, he drew
  attention carelessly to one or two paintings by old masters, and pointed out
  a remarkable statue presented by a famous Italian sculptor to his
  great-grandfather and now counted amongst the world's treasures. His guest
  watched and observed in silence. There was nothing of the uncouth sight-seer
  about him, still less of the fulsome dilettante. They settled themselves in
  comfortable chairs in a pleasant corner of the apartment.</p>

  <p>A footman served them with coffee, a second man handed cigars, and the
  butler himself carried a tray of liqueurs. The Marquis assumed an attitude of
  complete satisfaction with the world in general.</p>

  <p>"I am pleased to have this opportunity of a few words with you, Mr.
  Thain," he said. "You are quite comfortable in that chair, I trust?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly, thank you."</p>

  <p>"And my Larangas are not too mild? You will find darker-coloured cigars in
  the cabinet by your side."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," David Thain replied, "I smoke only mild tobacco."</p>

  <p>"Personally," the Marquis sighed, "I can go no further than cigarettes. A
  vice, perhaps," he added, watching the blue smoke curl upwards, "but a
  fascinating one. So you came across this man Vont on the steamer. Might I ask
  under what circumstances?"</p>

  <p>"Richard Vont, as I think he called himself," was the quiet reply, "shared
  a cabin in the second class with my servant. I was over there once or twice
  and talked with him."</p>

  <p>"That is very interesting," the Marquis observed. "He travelled second
  class, eh? And yet the man has many thousands to throw away in these absurd
  lawsuits with me."</p>

  <p>"He may have money," Thain pointed out, "and yet feel more at home in the
  second class. I understood that he had been a gamekeeper in England and was
  returning to his old home."</p>

  <p>"Did he speak of his purpose in doing so?"</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, he was singularly taciturn. All that I could gather from
  him was that he was returning to fulfill some purpose which he had kept
  before him for a great many years."</p>

  <p>The Marquis sighed. On his high, shapely forehead could be traced the
  lines of a regretful frown.</p>

  <p>"I was sure of it," he groaned. "The fellow is returning to make himself a
  nuisance to me. He did not tell you his story, then, Mr. Thain?"</p>

  <p>"He showed no inclination to do so&mdash;in fact he avoided so far as
  possible all discussion of his past."</p>

  <p>"Richard Vont," the Marquis continued, raising his eyes to the ceiling,
  "was one of those sturdy, thick-headed, unintelligent yeomen who have been
  spoiled by the trifle of education doled out to their grandfathers, their
  fathers and themselves. A few hundred years ago they formed excellent
  retainers to the nobles under whose patronage they lived. To-day, in these
  hideously degenerate days, Mr. Thain, when half the world has moved forward
  and half stood still, they are an anachronism. They find no seemly place in
  modern life."</p>

  <p>David Thain sat very still. There was just a little flash in his eyes,
  which came and went as sunlight might have gleamed across naked steel.</p>

  <p>"But I must not forget," his host went on tolerantly, "that I am speaking
  now to one who must to some extent have lost his sense of social proportion
  by a prolonged sojourn in a country where life is more or less a jumble."</p>

  <p>"You refer to America?"</p>

  <p>"Naturally! As a country resembling more than anything a gigantic sausage
  machine wherein all races and men of all social status are broken up on the
  wheel, puffed up with false ideas, and thrown out upon the world, a newly
  fledged, cunning, but singularly ignorant race of individuals, America
  possesses great interest to those&mdash;to those, in short," the Marquis
  declared, with a little wave of the hand, "whom such things interest. I am
  English, my forefathers were Saxon, my instincts are perhaps feudal. That is
  why I regard the case of Richard Vont from a point of view which you might
  possibly fail to appreciate. Would it bore you if I continue?"</p>

  <p>"Not in the least," David Thain assured him.</p>

  <p>"Richard Vont was head-keeper at Mandeleys when I succeeded to the title
  and estates, an advent which occurred a few years after my wife's death. He
  was already occupying a peculiar position there, owing to the generosity of
  my predecessor, whose life he had had the good fortune to save. He had very
  foolishly married above him in station&mdash;the girl was a school mistress,
  I believe. When I came to Mandeleys, I found him living there, a widower with
  one daughter, and a little boy, his nephew. The girl inherited her mother's
  superiority of station and intellect, and was naturally unhappy. I noticed
  her with interest, and she responded. Consequences which in the days of our
  ancestors, Mr. Thain, would have been esteemed an honour to the persons
  concerned, ensued. Richard Vont, like an ignorant clodhopper, viewed the
  matter from the wrong standpoint.... You said something, I believe? Pardon
  me. I sometimes fancy that I am a little deaf in my left ear."</p>

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>The Marquis leaned forward but David Thain shook his head. His lips had
  moved indeed, but no word had issued from them.</p>

  <p>"So far," his host went on, "the story contains no novel features. I
  exercised what my ancestors, in whose spirit I may say that I live, would
  have claimed as an undoubted right. Richard Vont, as I have said, with his
  inheritance of ill-bestowed education, and a measure of that extraordinary
  socialistic poison which seems, during the last few generations, to have
  settled like an epidemic in the systems of the agricultural classes, resented
  my action. His behaviour became so intolerable that I was forced to dismiss
  him from my service, and finally, to avoid a continuance of melodramatic
  scenes, which were extremely unpleasant to every one concerned, I was obliged
  to leave England for a time and travel upon the Continent."</p>

  <p>"And, in the meantime, what happened at Mandeleys?" David Thain asked.</p>

  <p>"Richard Vont and his nephew appear to have left for the United States
  very soon after my own departure from England. The cottage he left in the
  care of an elderly relative, who gave little trouble but much annoyance. She
  attended a Primitive Methodist Chapel in the village, and she passed both
  myself and the ladies of my household at all times without obeisance."</p>

  <p>"Dear me!" David Thain murmured under his breath.</p>

  <p>"After her death, I instructed my lawyers to examine the legal title to
  the Vont property and to see whether there was any chance of regaining it.
  Its value would be, at the outside, say six or seven hundred pounds. I
  advertised and offered two thousand, five hundred pounds to regain, it. My
  solicitors came into touch with the man Vont through an agent in America. His
  reply to their propositions on my behalf does not bear repetition. I then
  instructed my lawyers to take such steps as they could to have the deed of
  gift set aside, sufficient compensation of course being promised. That must
  have been some eight years ago. My efforts have come to an end to-day. The
  cottage remains the property of Richard Vont. My own law costs have been
  considerable, but by some means or other this man Vont has contrived to
  defend his property at the expenditure of some five or six thousand pounds.
  One can only conclude that he must have prospered in this strange country of
  yours, Mr. Thain."</p>

  <p>"To a stranger," the latter observed, "it seems curious that this man
  should have set so high a value upon a property which must be full of painful
  associations to him."</p>

  <p>"The very arguments I made use of in our earlier correspondence," his host
  assented. "I have told you the story, Mr. Thain, because it occurred to me
  that this man might have communicated to you his reason for returning after
  all these years to the neighbourhood."</p>

  <p>"He told me nothing."</p>

  <p>"Then I have wasted your time with a long and, I fear, a very dull story,"
  the Marquis apologised gracefully. "Shall we join the others?"</p>

  <p>"There was just one question, if I might be permitted," David Thain said,
  "which I should like to ask concerning the story which you have told me. The
  girl to whom you have alluded&mdash;Vont's daughter&mdash;what became of
  her?"</p>

  <p>The Marquis for a moment stood perfectly still. He had just risen to his
  feet and was standing where a gleam of sunlight fell upon his cold and
  passionless features. His silence had, in its way, a curious effect. He
  seemed neither to be thinking nor hesitating. He was just in a state of
  suspense. Presently he leaned forward and knocked the ash from his cigarette
  into the grate.</p>

  <p>"The lady in question," he replied, "has found that place in the world to
  which her gifts and charm entitle her. I fear that my sister will be getting
  impatient. My daughter, too, I am sure, would like to improve her
  acquaintance with you, Mr. Thain."</p>

  <p>David Thain was, in his way, an obstinate and self-willed man, but he
  found himself, for those first few moments, subject to his host's calm but
  effectual closure of the conversation. Nevertheless, he recovered himself in
  time to ask that other question as they left the room.</p>

  <p>"The lady is alive, then?"</p>

  <p>"She is alive," the Marquis acquiesced, in a colourless tone.</p>

  <p>A servant threw open the door of the drawing-room. The Marquis motioned to
  his guest to precede him.</p>

  <p>"As I imagined," he murmured, "I see that my sister is impatient. You will
  forgive me, Caroline," he went on, turning to the Duchess. "Mr. Thain's
  conversation was most interesting. Letitia, my dear, do press Mr. Thain to
  dine with us one evening. This afternoon I fear that I have been unduly
  loquacious. I should welcome another opportunity of conversing with him
  concerning his wonderful country."</p>

  <p>Letitia picked up a little morocco-bound volume from the table and
  consulted it. Sir Robert drew the prospective guest a little on one side.</p>

  <p>"For heaven's sake," he whispered, "don't give the Marquis any financial
  tips. He has a fancy that he is destined to restore the fortunes of the
  Mandeleys on the Stock Exchange. He is a delightfully ornamental person, but
  I can assure you that as a father-in-law he is a distinct luxury."</p>

  <p>David Thain smiled grimly.</p>

  <p>"I shall be careful," he promised.</p>

        id="ch04"></a>

  <h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

  <p>The Marquis devoted the remainder of that afternoon, as he did most
  others, to paying a call. Very soon indeed after David Thain's departure, he
  left the house, stepped into the motor-car which was waiting for him, and,
  with a little nod to the chauffeur which indicated his indulgence in a
  customary enterprise, drove off towards Battersea. Here he descended before a
  large block of flats overlooking the gardens, stepped into the lift and,
  without any direction to the porter, was let out upon the sixth floor. He
  made his way along the corridor to a little mahogany front door, on which was
  a brass plate inscribed with the name of <i>Miss Marcia Hannaway</i>. He rang
  the bell and was at once admitted by a very trim parlourmaid, who took his
  hat and cane, and ushered him into a remarkably pleasant little sitting room.
  A woman, seated before a typewriter, held out two ink-stained hands towards
  him with a little laugh.</p>

  <p>"I've been putting a ribbon in," she confessed. "Did you ever see such a
  mess! Please make yourself comfortable while I go and wash."</p>

  <p>The Marquis glanced with a slight frown at the machine, and, taking her
  wrists, stooped down and kissed them lightly.</p>

  <p>"My dear Marcia," he expostulated, "is this necessary!"</p>

  <p>She shook her head with a droll smile.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps if it were," she confessed, "I should hate to do it. There's a
  <i>Nineteenth Century</i> on the sofa. You can read my article."</p>

  <p>She hurried out of the room, from which she was absent only a very few
  moments. The Marquis, with a finger between the pages of the review which he
  had been reading, looked up as she re-entered. She was a woman of nameless
  gifts, of pleasant if not unduly slim figure. Her forehead was perhaps a
  little low, her eyes brilliant and intelligent, her mouth large and
  exceedingly mobile. She was not above the allurements of dress, for her house
  gown, with its long tunic trimmed with light fur, was of fashionable cut and
  becoming. Her fingers, cleansed now from the violet stains, were shapely,
  almost elegant. She threw herself into an easy chair opposite her visitor,
  and reached out her hand for a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Well," she asked, "and how has the great trial ended?"</p>

  <p>"Adversely," the Marquis confessed.</p>

  <p>"You foolish person," she sighed, lighting the cigarette and throwing the
  match away. "Of course you were bound to lose, and I suppose it's cost you no
  end of money."</p>

  <p>"I believe," he admitted, a little stiffly, "that my lawyers are somewhat
  depressed at the amount."</p>

  <p>She smoked in silence for a moment.</p>

  <p>"So he will go back to Mandeleys. It is a queer little fragment of life.
  What on earth does he want to do it for?"</p>

  <p>"Obstinacy," the Marquis declared,&mdash;"sheer, brutal, ignorant
  obstinacy."</p>

  <p>"And the boy?" she asked, pursuing her own train of thought. "Have you
  heard anything of him?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing. To tell you the truth, I have made no enquiries. Beyond the fact
  that it seems as though, for the present, Richard Vont will have his way, I
  take no interest in either of them."</p>

  <p>She nodded thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"If only we others," she sighed, "could infuse into our lives something of
  the marvellous persistence of these people whom in other respects we have
  left so far behind!"</p>

  <p>"My dear Marcia," he protested, "surely, with your remarkable
  intelligence, you can see that such persistence is merely a form of
  narrow-mindedness. Your father has shut in his life and driven it along one
  narrow groove. To you every day brings its fresh sensation, its fresh object.
  Hence&mdash;coupled, of course, with your natural gifts&mdash;your success.
  The person who thinks of but one thing in life must be indeed a dull
  dog."</p>

  <p>"Very excellent reasoning," she admitted. "Still, to come back to this
  little tragedy&mdash;for it is a tragedy, isn't it?&mdash;have you any idea
  what he means to do when he gets to Mandeleys?"</p>

  <p>"None at all!"</p>

  <p>"Let me see," she went on, "it is nineteen years ago last September, isn't
  it?&mdash;nineteen years out of the middle of his life. Will he sit in the
  garden and brood, I wonder, or has he brought back with him some scheme of
  mediaeval revenge?"</p>

  <p>"There was a time," the Marquis reflected, "when several of my Irish
  tenants used to shoot at me every Saturday night from behind a hedge. It was
  not in the least a dangerous operation, and I presume it brought them some
  relief. With Vont, however, things would be different. I remember him
  distinctly as a most wonderful shot."</p>

  <p>"Psychologically," Marcia Hannaway observed, "his present action is
  interesting. If he had shot you or me in his first fit of passionate
  resentment, everything would have been in order, but to leave the country,
  nurse a sullen feeling of revenge for years, and then come back, seems
  curious. What shall you do when you see him sitting in his garden?"</p>

  <p>"I shall address him," the Marquis replied. "I fear that his long
  residence in such a country as America will have altered him considerably,
  but it is of course possible that the instincts of his class remain."</p>

  <p>"How feudal you are!" she laughed.</p>

  <p>The Marquis frowned slightly. Although this was the one person in the
  world whom he felt was necessary to him, who held a distinct place in his
  very inaccessible heart, there were times when he entertained a dim suspicion
  that she was making fun of him. At such times he was very angry indeed.</p>

  <p>"In any case," he said, "we will not waste our time in speculating upon
  this man's attitude. I am still hoping that I may be able to devise means to
  render his occupancy of the cottage impossible."</p>

  <p>"I should like to hear about the boy."</p>

  <p>"If," the Marquis promised, "I find Vont's attitude respectful, I will
  make enquiries."</p>

  <p>"When are you going to Mandeleys?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I am in no hurry to leave London," he replied.</p>

  <p>"When you go," she told him, "I have made up my mind to take a little
  holiday. I thought even of going to the South of France."</p>

  <p>The lines of her companion's forehead were slightly elevated.</p>

  <p>"My dear Marcia," he protested gently, "is that like you? The class of
  people who frequent the Riviera at this time of the year&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She laughed at him delightfully.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you foolish person!" she interrupted. "If I go, I shall go to a tiny
  little boarding house, or take a villa in one of the quiet places&mdash;San
  Raphael, perhaps, or one of those little forgotten spots between
  Hy&egrave;res and Cannes. Phillis Grant would go with me. She isn't going to
  act again until the autumn season."</p>

  <p>Her visitor's expression was a little blank.</p>

  <p>"In the case of your departure from London," he announced, in a very even
  but very forlorn tone, "I will instruct Mr. Wadham to make a suitable
  addition to your allowance. At the same time, Marcia," he added, "I shall
  miss you."</p>

  <p>His words were evidently a surprise to her. She threw away her cigarette
  and came and sat on the sofa by his side.</p>

  <p>"Do you know, I believe you would," she murmured, resting her hand upon
  his. "How queer!"</p>

  <p>"I have never concealed my affection for you, have I?" he asked.</p>

  <p>This time the laugh which broke from her lips was scarcely natural.</p>

  <p>"Concealed your affection, Reginald!" she repeated. "How strangely that
  sounds! But listen. You said something just now about my allowance. If I
  allude to it in return, will you believe that it is entirely for your
  sake?"</p>

  <p>"Of course!"</p>

  <p>She rose from her chair and, crossing the room, rummaged about her desk
  for a moment, produced a letter, and brought it to him. The Marquis adjusted
  his horn-rimmed eyeglass and read:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">Dear Madam:</p>

  <p class="letter">We feel that some explanation is due to you with regard to
  the non-payment for the last two quarters of your allowance from our client,
  the Marquis of Mandeleys. We have to inform you that for some time past we
  have had no funds in our possession to pay this allowance. We informed his
  lordship of the fact, some time back, but in our opinion his lordship
  scarcely took the circumstance seriously. We think it better, therefore, that
  you should communicate with him on the subject.</p>

  <p class="letter">Faithfully yours,<br>
  <small>WADHAM, SON AND DICKSON.</small></p><br>

  <p>The Marquis deliberately folded up the letter, placed his eyeglass in his
  pocket, and sat looking into the fire. There was very little change in his
  face. Only Marcia, to whom he had been the study of a lifetime, knew that so
  far as suffering was possible to him, he was suffering at that moment.</p>

  <p>"You mustn't think it matters," she said gently. "You know my last novel
  was quite a wonderful success, and for that article in the <i>Nineteenth</i>
  you were looking at, they gave me twenty guineas. I am really almost opulent.
  Still, I thought it was better for you to know this. The same thing might
  refer to other and more important matters, and you know, dear, you are rather
  inclined to walk with your head in the air where money matters are
  concerned."</p>

  <p>"You have been very considerate, but foolishly so, my dear Marcia," he
  declared. "This matter must be put right at once. I fear that a younger
  element has obtruded itself into the firm of Wadham, an element which
  scarcely grasps the true position. I will see these people, Marcia."</p>

  <p>"You are not to worry about it," she begged softly. "To tell you the
  truth&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Marcia was a brave woman, and the moment had come up to which she had been
  leading for so long, which for many months, even years, had been in her mind.
  And when it came she faltered. There was something in the superb, immutable
  poise of the man who bent a little courteously towards her, which checked the
  words upon her lips.</p>

  <p>"It will be no trouble to me, Marcia, to set this little affair right," he
  assured her. "I am only glad that your circumstances have been such that you
  have not been inconvenienced. At the same time, is it entirely necessary for
  you to manipulate that hideous machine yourself?" he enquired, inclining his
  head towards the typewriter.</p>

  <p>"There are times," she confessed, "when I find it better. Of course, I
  send a great deal of my work out to be typed, but my correspondence grows,
  and my friends find my handwriting illegible."</p>

  <p>"I have never found it difficult," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"Well, you've had a good many years to get used to it," she reminded
  him.</p>

  <p>His hand rested for a moment upon her shoulder. He drew her a little
  towards him. She suddenly laughed, leaned over and kissed him on both cheeks,
  and jumped up. The trim little parlourmaid was at the door with tea.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she went on, "you have learned to read my handwriting, and I have
  learned how you like your tea. Just one or two more little things like that,
  and life is made between two people, isn't it? Shall I tell you what I think
  the most singular thing in the world?" she went on, pausing for a moment in
  her task. "It is fidelity to purpose&mdash;and to people, too, perhaps. In a
  way there is a quaint sort of distinction about it, and from another point of
  view it is most horribly constraining."</p>

  <p>"I interrupted you this afternoon, I imagine," he observed, "in the
  construction of some work of fiction."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no!" she replied. "What I write isn't fiction. That's why it sells.
  It's truth, you see, under another garb. But there the fact
  remains&mdash;that I shouldn't know how to make tea for another man in the
  world, and you wouldn't be able to read the letters of any other woman who
  wrote as badly as I do."</p>

  <p>"The fact," he remarked, "seems to me to be a cause for mutual
  congratulation."</p>

  <p>She stooped down to place a dish of muffins on a heater near the fire,
  graceful yet as a girl, and as brisk.</p>

  <p>"I can't imagine," she declared, "why it is that my sex has acquired the
  reputation for fidelity. I am sure we crave for experience much more than
  men."</p>

  <p>The Marquis helped himself to a muffin and considered the point. There
  were many times when Marcia's conversation troubled him. He was by no means
  an ill-read or unintellectual man, only his studies of literature had been
  confined to its polished and classical side, the side which deals so much
  with living and so little with life.</p>

  <p>"Are you preparing for a new work of fiction, Marcia," he asked, "or are
  you developing a fresh standpoint?"</p>

  <p>"Dear friend," she declared, lightly and yet with an undernote of
  earnestness, "how can I tell? I never know what I am going to do in the way
  of work. I wish I could say the same about life. Now I am going to ask you a
  great favour. I have to attend a small meeting at my club, at the other end
  of Piccadilly, at half-past five. Would you take me there?"</p>

  <p>"I shall be delighted," he answered, a little stiffly.</p>

  <p>She went presently to put on her outdoor clothes. The Marquis was
  disappointed. He realised how much he had looked forward to that quiet
  twilight hour, when somehow or other his vanity felt soothed, and that queer
  weariness which came over him sometimes was banished. He escorted Marcia to
  the car when she reappeared, however, without complaint.</p>

  <p>"I see your name in the papers sometimes, Marcia," he observed as he took
  his place by her side, "in connection with women's work. Of course, I do not
  interfere in any way with your energies. I should not, in whatever direction
  they might chance to lead you. At the same time, I must confess that I have
  noticed with considerable pleasure that you have never been publicly
  associated with this movement in favour of Woman's Suffrage."</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"I should like a vote myself," she admitted simply, "but when I think of
  the number of other women who would have to have it, and who don't yet look
  at life seriously at all, I think we are better as we are. Is it my fancy,"
  she went on, a little abruptly, "or are you really troubled about the return
  of&mdash;of Richard Vont?"</p>

  <p>"As usual, Marcia," he said, "you show a somewhat extraordinary perception
  where I am concerned. I am, as you know, not subject to presentiments, and I
  have no exact apprehension of what the word fear may mean. At the same time,
  you are right. I do view the return of this man with a feeling which you, as
  a novelist, might be able to analyse, but which I, as a layman, unused to
  fresh sentiments, find puzzling. You remember what a famous Frenchman wrote
  in his memoirs, suddenly, across one blank page of his journal&mdash;'To-day
  I feel that a great change is coming.'"</p>

  <p>She smiled reassuringly.</p>

  <p>"Personally," she told him, "I believe that it is just the call of England
  to a man who lived very near the soil&mdash;her heart. I think he wants the
  smell of spring flowers, the stillness of an English autumn, the winds of
  February in the woods he was brought up in. It is a form of heart-sickness,
  you know. I have felt it myself so often. It is scarcely possible that after
  all these years he is still nursing that bitter hatred of us both."</p>

  <p>The car had reached the great building in which Marcia's club was
  situated. The Marquis handed her out.</p>

  <p>"I trust that you are right," he remarked. "You will allow me to leave the
  car for you?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"There are so many women here with whom I want to talk," she said. "I may
  even stay and dine. And would you mind not coming until Wednesday? To-morrow
  I must work all day at an article which has to be typed and catch the
  Wednesday's boat for America."</p>

  <p>"Exactly as you wish," he assented.</p>

  <p>She waved her hand to him and ran lightly up the steps. The Marquis threw
  himself back in his car and hesitated. The footman was waiting for an
  address, and his august master was suddenly conscious that the skies were
  very grey, that a slight rain was falling, and that there was nowhere very
  much he wanted to go.</p>

  <p>The man waited with immovable face.</p>

  <p>"To&mdash;the club."</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

  <p>Messrs. Wadham, Son and Dickson were not habited in luxury. Theirs was one
  of those old-fashioned suites of offices in Lincoln's Inn, where the passages
  are of stone, the doors of painted deal, and a general air of bareness and
  discomfort prevails. The Marquis, who was a rare visitor, followed the
  directions of a hand painted upon the wall and found himself in what was
  termed, an enquiry office. A small boy tore himself away with apparent regret
  from the study of a pile of documents, and turned a little wearily towards
  the caller.</p>

  <p>"I desire," the Marquis announced, "to see Mr. Wadham, Senior, or to
  confer at once with any member of the firm who may be disengaged."</p>

  <p>The small boy was hugely impressed. He glanced at the long row of black
  boxes along the wall and a premonition of the truth began to dawn upon
  him.</p>

  <p>"What name, sir?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>"The Marquis of Mandeleys."</p>

  <p>The office boy swung open a wicket gate and pointed to the hard remains of
  a horsehair stuffed easy-chair. The Marquis eyed it curiously&mdash;and
  remained standing. His messenger thereupon departed, exhibiting a rare and
  unlegal haste. He returned breathless, in fact, from his mission, closely
  followed by Mr. Wadham, Junior.</p>

  <p>"This is quite an honour, your lordship," the latter said, hastily
  withdrawing his hand as he became aware of a certain rigidity in his
  visitor's demeanour. "My father is disengaged. Let me show you the way to his
  room."</p>

  <p>"I should be obliged," the Marquis assented.</p>

  <p>Mr. Wadham, Senior, was an excellent replica of his son, a little fatter,
  a little rosier and a little more verbose. He rose from behind his desk and
  bowed twice as his distinguished client entered. The Marquis indicated to Mr.
  Wadham, Junior, the chair upon which he proposed to sit, and waited while it
  was wheeled up to the side of the desk. Then he withdrew his gloves in
  leisurely fashion and extended his hand to the older man, who clasped it
  reverently.</p>

  <p>"Your lordship pays us a rare honour," Mr. Wadham, Senior, observed.</p>

  <p>"I should have preferred," the Marquis said, with some emphasis, "that
  circumstances had not rendered my visit to-day necessary."</p>

  <p>The head of the firm nodded sympathetically.</p>

  <p>"You will bear in mind," he begged, "our advice concerning these recent
  actions."</p>

  <p>"Your advice was, without doubt, legally good," his visitor replied, "but
  it scarcely took into account circumstances outside the legal point of view.
  However, I am not here to discuss those actions, which I understand are now
  finally disposed of."</p>

  <p>"Quite finally, I fear, your lordship."</p>

  <p>"I find myself," the Marquis continued sternly, "in the painful position
  of having to prefer a complaint against your firm."</p>

  <p>"I am very sorry&mdash;very sorry indeed," Mr. Wadham murmured.</p>

  <p>"I discovered yesterday afternoon, entirely by accident, that the
  allowance which you have my instructions to make to Miss Hannaway has not
  been paid for the last two quarters."</p>

  <p>"Through no neglect of ours, I assure your lordship," Mr. Wadham insisted
  gravely. "You will remember that we wrote to you last October, pointing out
  that the yield from the estates was insufficient, without the help of the
  bank, to meet the interest on the mortgages, and that, amongst other claims
  which we were obliged to leave over, we should be unable to forward the usual
  cheque to the young lady in question."</p>

  <p>The Marquis cleared his throat and tapped with his long forefingers upon
  the desk. It was a curious circumstance that, although both Mr. Wadham,
  Senior, and Junior had done more than their duty towards their distinguished
  client, each had at that moment the feeling of a criminal.</p>

  <p>"You are, I believe, perfectly well aware, Mr. Wadham," the Marquis
  declared, "that I never read your letters."</p>

  <p>Mr. Wadham, Senior, coughed. His son thrust both hands into his trousers
  pockets. The statement was unanswerable.</p>

  <p>"I was therefore," the Marquis continued severely, "in complete ignorance
  of your failure to carry out my instructions."</p>

  <p>Mr. Wadham, Junior, less affected than his father by tradition, and
  priding himself more upon that negligible gift of common sense, interposed
  respectfully but firmly.</p>

  <p>"We can scarcely be responsible," he pointed out, "for your lordship's
  indisposition to read letters containing business information of
  importance."</p>

  <p>The Marquis changed his position slightly and looked at the speaker. Mr.
  Wadham, Junior, became during the next few seconds profoundly impressed with
  the irrelevance, almost the impertinence of his words.</p>

  <p>"I should have imagined," the former said severely, "that my habits are
  well-known to the members of a firm whose connection with my family is almost
  historical."</p>

  <p>"We should have waited upon your lordship," Mr. Wadham, Senior, admitted.
  "But with reference to the case of this young lady, not hearing from your
  lordship, we wrote to her, very politely, indicating the great difficulties
  which we had to face in the management of the Mandeleys estates, owing to the
  abnormal agricultural depression, and we promised to send her a cheque as
  soon as such a step became possible. In reply we heard from her&mdash;a most
  ladylike and reasonable letter it was&mdash;stating that owing to recent
  literary successes, and to your lordship's generosity through so many years,
  she was only too glad of the opportunity to beg us to cease from forwarding
  the quarterly amount as hitherto. Under those circumstances, we have devoted
  such small sums of money as have come into our hands to more vital
  purposes."</p>

  <p>"I suppose it did not occur to you," the Marquis observed, "that I am the
  person to decide what is or is not vital in the disposition of my own
  moneys."</p>

  <p>"That is a fact which we should not presume to dispute," the lawyer
  admitted, "but I should like to point out that, on the next occasion when we
  had a little money in hand, your household steward, Mr. Harrison, was here in
  urgent need of a thousand pounds for the payment of domestic bills connected
  with the establishment in Grosvenor Square."</p>

  <p>"It appears to me," the Marquis said, with a trace of irritability in his
  tone, "that the greater part of my income goes in paying bills."</p>

  <p>The complaint was one which for the moment left Mr. Wadham speechless. He
  was vaguely conscious that an adequate reply existed, but it eluded him. His
  son, who had adopted the attitude of being outside the discussion, was
  engaged in an abortive attempt to appear as much at ease in his own office as
  this client of theirs certainly was.</p>

  <p>"I will discuss the matter of Miss Hannaway's future allowance with that
  young lady, and let you know the result," the Marquis announced. "In the
  meantime, how do we stand for ready money?"</p>

  <p>"Ready money, your lordship!" his interlocutor gasped.</p>

  <p>"Precisely," the Marquis assented. "It is, I believe, a few days after the
  period when my tenants usually pay their rents."</p>

  <p>"Your lordship," Mr. Wadham said, speaking with every attempt at gravity,
  "if every one of your tenants paid their full rent and brought it into this
  office at the present moment, we should still be unable to pay the interest
  on the mortgages due next month, without further advances from the bank."</p>

  <p>"These mortgages," the Marquis remarked thoughtfully, "are a
  nuisance."</p>

  <p>So self-evident a fact seemed to leave little room for comment or denial.
  The Marquis frowned a little more severely and withdrew his forefingers from
  the desk.</p>

  <p>"Figures, I fear, only confuse me," he confessed, "but for the sake of
  curiosity, what do my quarterly rents amount to?"</p>

  <p>"Between seven and eight thousand pounds, according to deductions, your
  lordship," was the prompt reply. "That sum I presume will be coming in from
  your agent, Mr. Merridrew, within the course of a few days. The interest upon
  the mortgages amounts to perhaps a thousand pounds less than that sum. That
  thousand pounds, I may be permitted to point out to your lordship, is all
  that remains for the carrying on of your Grosvenor Square establishment, and
  for such disbursements as are necessary at Mandeleys."</p>

  <p>"It is shameful," the Marquis declared severely, "that any one should be
  allowed to anticipate their income in this way. Mortgages are most vicious
  institutions."</p>

  <p>Mr. Wadham coughed.</p>

  <p>"Your lordship's expenditure, some ten or fifteen years ago, rendered them
  first necessary. After that there was the unfortunate speculation in the tin
  mines&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That will do, Mr. Wadham," his client interrupted. "All I desire to know
  from you further is a statement of the approximate sum required to clear off
  the mortgages upon the Mandeleys estates?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Wadham, Senior, looked a little startled. His son stopped whistling
  under his breath and leaned forward in his chair.</p>

  <p>"Clear off the mortgages," he repeated.</p>

  <p>"Precisely!"</p>

  <p>"The exact figures," was the somewhat hesitating pronouncement, "would
  require a quarter of an hour's study, but I should say that a sum of two
  hundred and twenty thousand pounds would be required."</p>

  <p>"I have not a head for figures," the Marquis acknowledged gravely, "but
  the amount seems trifling. I shall wish you good-day now, gentlemen. Two
  hundred and twenty thousand, I think you said, Mr. Wadham?"</p>

  <p>"That is as near the amount as possible," the lawyer admitted.</p>

  <p>The Marquis drew on his gloves, a sign that he did not intend to honour
  his adviser with any familiar form of farewell. He inclined his head slightly
  to Mr. Wadham, and more slightly still to Mr. Wadham, Junior, who was holding
  open the door. The small boy, who was on the alert, escorted him to the front
  steps, and received with delight a gracious word of thanks for his
  attentions. So the Marquis took his departure.</p>

  <p>Mr. Wadham, Junior, closed the door and threw himself into the chair which
  had been occupied by their distinguished client. There was a faint perfume of
  lavender water remaining in the atmosphere. His eyes wandered around the
  further rows of tin boxes which encumbered the wall.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," he murmured, "it's a great thing to have a Marquis for one's
  client."</p>

  <p>"I suppose it is," Mr. Wadham, Senior, assented gloomily.</p>

  <p>"Father, do you ever feel at ease with him?" his son asked curiously. "Do
  you ever feel as though you were talking to a real human being, of the same
  flesh and blood as yourself?"</p>

  <p>"Never for a single moment," was the vigorous reply. "If I felt like that,
  John, do you know what I should do? No? Well, then, I'll tell you. I should
  have those tin boxes taken out, one by one, and stacked in the hall. I should
  say to him, as plainly as I am saying it to you&mdash;'We lose money every
  year by your business, Marquis. We've had our turn. Try some one
  else&mdash;and go to the Devil!'"</p>

  <p>"But you couldn't do it!" Mr. Wadham, Junior, observed disconsolately.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't," his father agreed, with a note of subdued melancholy in his
  tone.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

  <p>Lady Margaret, who chanced to be the first arrival on the night of the
  dinner party in David Thain's honour, contemplated her sister admiringly.
  Letitia was wearing a gown of ivory satin, a form of attire which seemed
  always to bring with it almost startling reminiscences of her Italian
  ancestry.</p>

  <p>"So glad to find you alone, Letty," she remarked, as she sank into the
  most comfortable of the easy chairs. "There's something I've been wanting to
  ask you for weeks. Bob put it into my head again this afternoon."</p>

  <p>"What is it, dear?" Letitia enquired.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you marry Charlie Grantham?" her sister demanded abruptly.</p>

  <p>"There are so many reasons. First of all, he hasn't really ever asked
  me."</p>

  <p>"You're simply indolent," Lady Margaret persisted. "He'd ask you in five
  minutes if you'd let him. Do you suppose Bob would ever have thought of
  marrying me, if I hadn't put the idea into his head?"</p>

  <p>"You're so much cleverer than I," Letitia sighed.</p>

  <p>"Not in the least," was the prompt disclaimer. "I really doubt whether I
  have your brains, and I certainly haven't your taste. The only thing that I
  have, and always had, is common sense, common sense enough to see that girls
  in our position in life must marry, and the sooner the better."</p>

  <p>"Why only our class of life?"</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly! It's perfectly obvious, isn't it, that the daughters of
  the middle classes are having the time of their lives. They are all earning
  money. Amongst them it has become quite the vogue to take situations as
  secretaries or milliners or that sort of thing, and it simply doesn't matter
  whether they marry or not. They get all the fun they want out of life."</p>

  <p>"It sounds quite attractive," Letitia admitted. "I think I shall take a
  course in typewriting and shorthand."</p>

  <p>"You won't," Margaret rejoined. "You know perfectly well that that is one
  of the things we can never do. You've got to marry first. Then you can branch
  out in life in any direction you choose&mdash;art, travel, amours, or
  millinery. You can help yourself with both hands."</p>

  <p>"Which have you chosen, Meg?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I am an exception!" Margaret confessed. "You see, Bob is such fun,
  and I've never got over the joke of marrying him. Besides, I haven't any
  craving for things at all. I am not temperamental like you. Where's
  father?"</p>

  <p>"Just back from the country. He'll be here in time, though."</p>

  <p>"And who's dining?"</p>

  <p>"Charlie, for one," Letitia replied, "Aunt Caroline, of course, and Uncle,
  Mrs. Honeywell, and the American person. The party was got up on his account,
  so I expect father wants to borrow money from him."</p>

  <p>"He doesn't look an easy lender," Lady Margaret remarked.</p>

  <p>"There's no one proof against father," Letitia declared. "He is too
  exquisitely and transparently dishonest. You know, there's a man's story
  about the clubs that he once borrowed money from Lewis at five per cent.
  interest."</p>

  <p>Margaret remained in a serious frame of mind.</p>

  <p>"Something will have to be done," she sighed. "Robert went down and looked
  at the mortgages, the other day. He says they are simply appalling, there
  isn't an acre missed out. It's quite on the cards, you know, Letty, that
  Mandeleys may have to go."</p>

  <p>Letitia made a little grimace.</p>

  <p>"I am getting perfectly callous," she confided. "If it did, this house
  would probably follow, father would realise everything he could lay his hands
  upon and become the autocrat of some French watering place, and I should
  cease to be the honest but impecunious daughter of a wicked nobleman, and
  enjoy the liberty of the middle-class young women you were telling me about.
  It wouldn't be so bad!"</p>

  <p>"Or marry&mdash;" Margaret began.</p>

  <p>"Mr. David Thain," the butler announced.</p>

  <p>The juxtaposition of words perhaps incited in Letitia a greater interest
  as she turned away from her sister to welcome the first of her guests. He had
  to cross a considerable space of the drawing-room, with its old-fashioned
  conglomeration of furniture untouched and unrenovated for the last two
  generations, but he showed not the slightest sign of awkwardness or
  self-consciousness in any form. He was slight and none too powerfully built,
  but his body was singularly erect, and he moved with the alert dignity of a
  man in perfect health and used to gymnastic training. His clean-shaven face
  disclosed nervous lines which his manner contradicted. His mouth was
  unexpectedly hard, his deep-set grey eyes steel-like, almost brilliant. These
  things made for a strength which had in it, however, nothing of the uncouth.
  The only singularity about his face and manner, as he took his hostess'
  fingers, was the absence of any smile of greeting upon his lips.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that I am a little early," he apologised.</p>

  <p>"We are all the more grateful to you," Lady Margaret assured him. "Letitia
  and I always bore one another terribly. A married sister, you know, feels
  rather like the cuckoo returning to the discarded nest."</p>

  <p>"One hates other people's liberty so much," Letitia sighed.</p>

  <p>"I should have thought liberty was a state very easy to acquire," David
  Thain observed didactically.</p>

  <p>"That is because you come from a land where all the women are clever and
  the men tolerant," Letitia replied. "Where is that husband of yours,
  Margaret?"</p>

  <p>"I am ashamed to say," her sister confessed, "that he stayed down in the
  morning room while Gossett fetched him a glass of sherry. Look at him now,"
  she added, as Sir Robert entered the room unannounced and came smiling
  towards them. "How can I have any faith in a husband like that. Doesn't he
  look as though the only thing that could trouble him in life was that he
  hadn't been able to get here a few minutes earlier!"</p>

  <p>"Given away, eh?" the newcomer groaned, as he kissed Letitia's fingers.
  "How are you, Mr. Thain? Your country is entirely to blame for my habits. I
  got so into the habit of drinking cocktails while I was over there that I
  really prefer my aperitif to my wine at dinner."</p>

  <p>Sir Robert, who had discovered within the last few days exactly where Mr.
  David Thain stood amongst the list of American multi-millionaires, drew this
  very distinguished person a little on one side to ask about a railway. Then
  the Marquis made his appearance, and immediately afterwards the remaining
  guests. David Thain, of whom many of the morning papers, during the last few
  days, had found something to say, found himself almost insinuated into the
  position of favoured guest. He took Mrs. Honeywell&mdash;a dark and rather
  tired-looking lady&mdash;in to dinner, but he sat at Letitia's left hand, and
  she gave him a good deal of her attention.</p>

  <p>"You know everybody, don't you, Mr. Thain?" she asked him, soon after they
  had taken their places.</p>

  <p>"Except the gentleman on your right," he answered.</p>

  <p>She leaned towards him confidentially.</p>

  <p>"His name," she whispered, "is Lord Charles Grantham. He is the son of the
  Duke of Leicester, who is, between ourselves, almost as wicked a duke as my
  father is a marquis. Fortunately, however, his mother left him a fortune. Do
  you notice how thoughtful he looks?"</p>

  <p>David Thain glanced across the table at the young man in question, who was
  exchanging rather weary monosyllables with his right-hand neighbour.</p>

  <p>"He is perhaps overworked?"</p>

  <p>Letitia shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Not at all. He cannot make up his mind whether or not he wants to marry
  me."</p>

  <p>"And can you make up your mind whether you wish to marry him?"</p>

  <p>Letitia lost for a moment her air of gentle banter.</p>

  <p>"What a downright question!" she observed. "However, I can't tell you
  before I answer him, can I, and he hasn't asked me yet."</p>

  <p>"I should think," David Thain said coolly, "that you would make an
  excellent match."</p>

  <p>Their eyes met for a moment. There was a challenging light in hers to
  which he instantly responded. Her very beautiful white teeth closed for a
  moment upon her lower lip. Then she smiled upon him once more.</p>

  <p>"It is so reassuring," she murmured, "to be told things like that by
  people who are likely to know. Charles, talk to me at once," she went on,
  turning towards him. "Mr. Thain and I agree far too perfectly upon
  everything."</p>

  <p>Thain was deep in conversation with his neighbour before Lord Charles was
  able to disentangle himself from the conversational artifices of the Duchess.
  Letitia took note of his aptness with a little, malicious smile. It was
  towards the close of dinner when she once more turned towards him.</p>

  <p>"Have you been telling Mrs. Honeywell how you made all your millions?" she
  asked.</p>

  <p>"I have been trying to point out," he replied, "that the first million is
  all one has to make. The rest comes."</p>

  <p>"What a delightful country!" Letitia observed. "If I were to borrow from
  all my friends and collected a million, do you think I could go out there and
  become a multi-millionaire?"</p>

  <p>"Women are not natural money-makers," he pronounced.</p>

  <p>"What is her real sphere?" she asked sweetly. "I should so much like to
  know your opinion of us."</p>

  <p>"As yet," he replied, "I have had no time to form one."</p>

  <p>"What a pity!" she sighed. "It would have been so instructive."</p>

  <p>"In the small amenities of daily life," he said thoughtfully, "in what one
  of our writers calls the insignificant arts, women seem inevitably to excel.
  They always appear to do better, in fact, in the narrower circles. Directly
  they step outside, a certain lack of breadth becomes noticeable."</p>

  <p>"Dear me!" she murmured. "It's a good thing I'm not one of these modern
  ladies who stand on a tub in Hyde Park and thump the drum for votes. I should
  be saying quite disagreeable things to you, Mr. Thain, shouldn't I?"</p>

  <p>"You couldn't be one of those, if you tried," he replied. "You see, if I
  may be permitted to say so, nature has endowed you with rather a rare gift so
  far as your sex is concerned."</p>

  <p>"Don't be over-diffident," she begged. "I may know it, mayn't I?"</p>

  <p>"A sense of humour."</p>

  <p>"When a man tells a woman that she has a sense of humour," Letitia
  declared, "it is a sure sign that he&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She suddenly realised how intensely observant those steely grey eyes could
  be. She broke off in her sentence. They still held her, however.</p>

  <p>"That he what?"</p>

  <p>"Such a bad habit of mine," she confided frankly. "I so often begin a
  sentence and have no idea how to finish it. Ada," she went on, addressing
  Mrs. Honeywell, "has Mr. Thain taught you how to become a millionairess?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't even tried to learn," that lady replied. "He has promised me a
  subscription to my Cripples' Guild, though."</p>

  <p>"What extraordinary bad taste," Letitia remarked, "to cadge from him at
  dinner time!"</p>

  <p>"If your father weren't within hearing," Mrs. Honeywell retorted, "I'd let
  you know what I think of you as a hostess! Why are we all so frightened of
  your father, Letitia? Look at him now. He is the most picturesque and kindly
  object you can imagine, yet I find myself always choosing my phrases, and
  slipping into a sort of pre-Victorian English, when I fancy that he is
  listening."</p>

  <p>"I see him more from the family point of view, I suppose," Letitia
  observed, "and yet, in a way, he is rather a wonderful person. For instance,
  I have never seen him hurry, I have never seen him angry, in the ordinary
  sense of the word; in fact he has the most amazing complacency I ever knew.
  Of course, Aunt Caroline," she went on, turning to the Duchess a few moments
  later, "if you want to stay with the men, pray do so. If not, you might take
  into account the fact that I have been trying to catch your eye for the last
  three minutes."</p>

  <p>Thain drew up nearer to his host after the women had withdrawn, and found
  himself next Sir Robert, who talked railways with eloquence and some
  understanding. Lord Charles was frankly bored, and bestowed his whole
  attention upon the port. The Marquis discussed a recent land bill with his
  brother-in-law, but in a very few moments gave the signal to rise. He
  attached himself at once to David Thain.</p>

  <p>"You play bridge?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Never if I can avoid it," was the frank reply.</p>

  <p>"Then you and I will entertain one another," his host suggested.</p>

  <p>The Marquis's idea of entertainment was to install his guest in a
  comfortable chair in a small den at the back of the house, which he kept for
  his absolutely private use, and to broach the subject which had led to
  David's welcome at Grosvenor Square.</p>

  <p>"Let me ask you," he began, "have you seen anything more of this man
  Vont?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing."</p>

  <p>The Marquis looked ruminatively at the cedar spill with which he had just
  lit his cigarette.</p>

  <p>"I am almost certain," he said, "that I saw him on the platform at
  Raynham&mdash;the nearest station to Mandeleys&mdash;yesterday. He seemed
  marvellously little altered."</p>

  <p>"He has probably taken up his abode down there, then," David observed.</p>

  <p>The Marquis's face darkened. He brushed the subject aside.</p>

  <p>"There is a matter concerning which I wish to speak to you, Mr. Thain," he
  said. "You are one of the fortunate ones of the earth, who have attained, by
  your own efforts, I believe, an immense prosperity."</p>

  <p>David listened in silence, watching the ash at the end of his cigar.</p>

  <p>"Your money, my son-in-law, Sir Robert, tells me," the Marquis continued,
  "has been made in brilliant and sagacious speculation. There have no doubt
  been others who have followed in your footsteps, and, in a humbler way, have
  shared your success."</p>

  <p>David had developed a rare gift of silence. He smoked steadily, and his
  expression was remarkably stolid.</p>

  <p>"I find myself in need of a sum," the Marquis proceeded, with the air of a
  man introducing a business proposition, "of two hundred and twenty thousand
  pounds&mdash;there or thereabouts."</p>

  <p>There was a momentary gleam of interest in David's eyes, gone, however,
  almost as soon as it had appeared. For the first time he made a remark.</p>

  <p>"Over a million dollars, eh?"</p>

  <p>The Marquis inclined his head.</p>

  <p>"My position," he continued, "naturally precludes me from making use of
  any of the ordinary methods by means of which men amass wealth. I have at
  various times, however, made small but not entirely unsuccessful
  speculations&mdash;upon the Stock Exchange. The position in which I now find
  myself demands something upon a larger scale."</p>

  <p>"What capital," David Thain enquired, "can you handle?"</p>

  <p>The Marquis stroked his chin thoughtfully. He was aware of a pocketbook a
  shade fuller than usual, of three overdrawn banking accounts, and his recent
  interview with his lawyers.</p>

  <p>"Capital," he repeated. "Ah! I suppose capital is necessary."</p>

  <p>"In any gambling transaction, you always have to take into account the
  possibility," David reminded him, "that you might lose."</p>

  <p>"Precisely," the Marquis assented, selecting another cigarette, "but that
  is not the class of speculation I am looking for. I am anxious to discover an
  enterprise, either by means of my own insight into such matters, which is not
  inconsiderable, or the good offices of a friend, in which the chances of loss
  do not exist."</p>

  <p>David was a little staggered. He contemplated his host curiously.</p>

  <p>"Such speculations," he said at last, "are difficult to find."</p>

  <p>"Not to a man of your ability, I am sure, Mr. Thain," the Marquis
  asserted.</p>

  <p>"Do I gather that you wish for my advice?"</p>

  <p>The Marquis inclined his head.</p>

  <p>"That," he intimated, "was my object."</p>

  <p>David smoked steadily, and his host contemplated him with a certain
  artistic satisfaction. He had been something of a sculptor in his youth, and
  he saw possibilities in the shape and pose of the great financier.</p>

  <p>"The long and short of it is," David said at last, "that you want to make
  a million dollars, without any trouble, and without any chance of loss. There
  are a good many others, Marquis."</p>

  <p>"But they have not all the privilege," was the graceful rejoinder, "of
  knowing personally a Goliath of finance. You will pardon the allegory. I take
  it from this morning's <i>Daily Express</i>."</p>

  <p>"In my career," David continued, after a moment's pause, "you would
  perhaps be surprised to hear that I have done very little speculating. I have
  made great purchases of railways, and land through which railways must run,
  because I knew my job and because I had insight. The time for that is past
  now. To make money rapidly one must, as you yourself have already decided,
  speculate. I can tell you of a speculation in which I have myself indulged,
  but I do not for a moment pretend that it is a certainty. It was good enough
  for me to put in two million dollars, and if what I believe happens, my two
  millions will be forty millions. But there is no certainty."</p>

  <p>The Marquis fidgeted in his chair.</p>

  <p>"By what means," he asked tentatively, "could I interest myself in this
  undertaking?"</p>

  <p>"By the purchase of shares," was the prompt reply.</p>

  <p>The Marquis considered the point. The matter of purchasing anything
  presented fundamental difficulties to him!</p>

  <p>"Tell me about these shares?" he invited. "What is the nature of the
  undertaking?"</p>

  <p>"Oil."</p>

  <p>The Marquis grew a little more sanguine. There was an element of fantasy
  about oil shares. Perhaps they could be bought on paper.</p>

  <p>"Large fortunes have been made in oil," he said. "Personally, I am a
  believer in oil. Where are the wells?"</p>

  <p>"In Arizona."</p>

  <p>"An excellent locality," the Marquis continued approvingly. "What is the
  present price of the shares?"</p>

  <p>"They are dollar shares," David replied, "and their present price is par.
  You may find them quoted in some financial papers, but as practically the
  entire holding is in my possession, the market for them is limited."</p>

  <p>"Precisely," the Marquis murmured. "To come to business, Mr. Thain, are
  you disposed to part with any?"</p>

  <p>David appeared to consider the matter.</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't know," he said, "I've made something like twenty million
  dollars out of my railways, and I have about reached that point when
  speculations cease to attract."</p>

  <p>The Marquis held on to the sides of his chair and struggled against the
  feeling almost of reverence which he feared might be reflected in his
  countenance.</p>

  <p>"A very desirable sum of money, Mr. Thain," he conceded.</p>

  <p>"It's enough for me," David acknowledged. "There are two million shares in
  the Pluto Oil Company, practically the whole of which stand in my name. If
  the calculations which the most experienced oil men in the States have worked
  out materialise, those shares will be worth ten million dollars in four
  months' time. Let me see," he went on, "two hundred and thirty thousand
  pounds is, roughly speaking, one million, one hundred and fifty thousand
  dollars. You can have two hundred thousand of my shares, if you like, at a
  dollar."</p>

  <p>"This is exceedingly kind of you," the Marquis declared. "Let me see," he
  reflected, "two hundred thousand dollars would be&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A matter of forty thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>"I see!" the Marquis ruminated. "Forty thousand pounds!"</p>

  <p>"You are not, I am sure, a business man," his guest continued, "so you
  will pardon my reminding you that you can easily obtain an advance from your
  bankers upon the title deeds of property, or a short mortgage would produce
  the amount."</p>

  <p>"A mortgage," the Marquis repeated, as though the idea were a new one to
  him. "Ah, yes! I must confess, though, that I have the strongest possible
  objection to mortgages, if they can in any way be dispensed with."</p>

  <p>"I suppose that is how you large English landowners generally feel," David
  remarked tolerantly. "If you would prefer it, I will take your note of hand
  for the amount of the shares, payable, say, in three months' time."</p>

  <p>The Marquis upset the box of cigarettes which he was handling. He was not
  as a rule a clumsy person, but he felt strongly the need of some extraneous
  incident. He stood on the hearthrug whilst the servant whom he summoned
  collected the cigarettes and replaced them in the box. As soon as the door
  was closed, he turned to his guest.</p>

  <p>"Your offer, Mr. Thain," he said, "is a most kindly one. It simplifies the
  whole matter exceedingly."</p>

  <p>"You had better make the usual enquiries concerning the property," the
  latter advised. "I am afraid you will find it a little difficult over on this
  side to get exact information, but if you have any friends who understand oil
  prospecting&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The Marquis held out his hand.</p>

  <p>"It is not an occasion upon which a further opinion is necessary," he
  declared. "I approve of the locality of the property, and the fact that you
  yourself are largely interested is sufficient for me."</p>

  <p>"Then any time you like to meet me at your lawyer's," David suggested,
  "I'll hand over the shares and you can sign a note of hand for the
  amount."</p>

  <p>The Marquis considered the matter for a moment, thoughtfully. There was
  something about the idea of letting Mr. Wadham see him sign a promissory note
  for forty thousand pounds which occurred to him as somewhat precarious.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you have legal connections of your own here," he ventured. "To
  tell you the truth, I have been obliged to speak my mind in a very plain
  manner to my own solicitors. I consider that they mismanaged the Vont case
  most shamefully. I would really prefer to keep away from them for a
  time."</p>

  <p>David nodded.</p>

  <p>"I have a letter to some lawyers, at my rooms," he said. "I will send you
  their address, and we can make an appointment to meet at their office."</p>

  <p>The Marquis assented gravely. He considered that the matter was now better
  dismissed from further discussion.</p>

  <p>"I have no doubt," he said, "that my sister would like to talk to you for
  a time. Shall we join the ladies?"</p>

  <p>David threw away his cigar and professed his readiness. They crossed the
  hall and entered the drawing-room. There was one table of bridge, and Letitia
  was seated with her sister on a divan near the window. The former sighed as
  she watched the entrance of the two men.</p>

  <p>"Do look at father, Meg," she whispered. "I am perfectly certain he has
  been borrowing money."</p>

  <p>Margaret shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"What if he has, my dear!" she rejoined. "These people can afford to pay
  for their entertainment. I think it's rather clever of him."</p>

  <p>Letitia groaned.</p>

  <p>"You have such ignoble ideas, Meg," she said reprovingly. "Now I know I
  shall have to make myself agreeable to Mr. Thain, and I either like him or
  dislike him immensely. I haven't the least idea which."</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't be surprised," her sister whispered, as Thain approached, "if
  he didn't help you presently to make up your mind."</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

  <p>Marcia Hannaway called upon her publisher during the course of the
  following day. She found the ready entr&eacute;e of a privileged
  client&mdash;with scarcely a moment's delay she was ushered into the presence
  of James Borden, the person who for some years now had occupied the second
  place in her thoughts and life.</p>

  <p>"Anything happened, Marcia?" he enquired, after their quiet but familiar
  greeting. "You look as though you were bringing Fate with you."</p>

  <p>She made herself comfortable in the easy-chair which he had drawn up to
  the fire. Outside, an unexpectedly cold wind made the sense of warmth doubly
  pleasant. She unfastened her simple furs and smiled at him a little
  dolefully.</p>

  <p>"Just this," she replied, handing him a letter.</p>

  <p>He spread it out, adjusted his eyeglasses and read it
  deliberately:</p><br>

  <p class="letter"><small>94, GROSVENOR SQUARE</small>, Thursday.</p>

  <p class="letter">My dear Marcia:</p>

  <p class="letter">I have made enquiries with reference to the non-payment of
  your allowance for the last two quarters, and now enclose cheque for the
  amount, drawn by my agent in Norfolk and payable to yourself. I think I can
  promise you that no further irregularities shall occur.</p>

  <p class="letter">I look forward to seeing you to-morrow afternoon, and I
  must tell you of a financial operation I am now conducting, which, if
  successful, may enable me to pay off the mortgages which render the Norfolk
  estates so unremunerative.</p>

  <p class="letter">I trust that you are well, dear. I have ordered Carlton
  White's to send in a few flowers, which I hope will arrive safely.</p>

  <p class="letter">Yours,<br>
  <small>REGINALD.</small>&gt;</p><br>

  <p>James Borden read the letter carefully, glanced at the small coronet at
  the top of the paper, and folded it up.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, Marcia," he said simply.</p>

  <p>She made a little grimace.</p>

  <p>"My dear man," she confessed, "so am I. After all, though, I am not sure
  that the money makes all the difference. You see, if he really were too
  poor&mdash;or rather if his lawyers couldn't raise the money to send to
  me&mdash;I fancy that I should feel just the same."</p>

  <p>The publisher turned his chair round towards the fire. He was a man of
  barely middle age, although his black hair was besprinkled with grey and
  growing a little thin at the temples. His features were good, but his face
  was a little thin, and his clothes were scarcely as tidy, or the appointments
  of his office so comfortable as his name and position in the publishing world
  might have warranted. Marcia, who had been looking at him while he read,
  leaned forward and brushed the cigarette ash from his coat sleeve.</p>

  <p>"Such an untidy man!" she declared, straightening his tie. "I am not at
  all sure that you deserve to have lady clients calling upon you. Were you
  late last night?"</p>

  <p>"A little," he confessed.</p>

  <p>"That means about one or two, I suppose," she went on reprovingly.</p>

  <p>"I dined at the club and stayed on," he told her. "There was nothing else
  to do except work, and I was a little tired of that."</p>

  <p>"Any fresh stuff in&mdash;interesting stuff, I mean?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Three more Russian novels," he replied, "all in French and want
  translating, of course. The only one I have read is terribly grim and sordid.
  I dare say it would sell. I am going to read the other two before I decide
  anything. Then perhaps you'll help me."</p>

  <p>"Of course I will," she promised. "I do wish, though, James, you wouldn't
  stay at the club so late. How many whiskies and sodas?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't count," he confessed.</p>

  <p>She sighed.</p>

  <p>"I know what that means! James, why aren't you a little more human? You
  get heaps of invitations to nice houses. Much better go out and make some
  women friends. You ought to marry, you know."</p>

  <p>"I am quite ready to when you will marry me," he retorted.</p>

  <p>"But, my dear man, I am bespoke," she reminded him. "You know that quite
  well. I couldn't possibly think of marrying anybody."</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do with that money?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"I think I shall keep it," she decided. "Not to do so would hurt him
  terribly."</p>

  <p>"And keeping it hurts me damnably!" he muttered.</p>

  <p>She shook her head at him.</p>

  <p>"We've had this over so often, haven't we? I cannot leave Reginald as long
  as he wants me, relies upon me as much as he does now."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" was the almost rough demand. "He has had the best of your
  life."</p>

  <p>"And he has given me a great deal of his," she retorted. "For nineteen
  years I have been his very dear friend. During all that time he has never
  broken a promise to me, never told a falsehood, never said a single word
  which could grate or hurt. If he has sometimes seemed a little aloof, it is
  because he really believes himself to be a great person. He believes in
  himself immensely, you know, James&mdash;in the privileges and sanctity of
  his descent. It seems so strange in this world, where we others see other
  things. If I only dared, I would write a novel about it."</p>

  <p>"But you don't care for him any more?"</p>

  <p>"Care for him?" she repeated. "How could I ever stop caring for him! He
  was my first lover, and has been my only one."</p>

  <p>"Let me ask you a question," James Borden demanded suddenly. "Don't you
  ever feel any grudge against him? He took you away from a very respectable
  position in life. He ruined all sorts of possibilities. He was fifteen or
  twenty years older than you were, and he knew the world. You pleased him, and
  he deliberately entrapped your affections. Be honest, now. Don't you
  sometimes hate him for it?"</p>

  <p>"Never," she answered without hesitation. "I was, as you say, most
  respectably placed&mdash;a teacher at a village school&mdash;and I might have
  married a young farmer, or bailiff's son, or, with great luck, a struggling
  young doctor, and lived a remarkably rural life, but, as you have observed,
  in great respectability. My dear James, I should have hated it. I was, I
  think, nineteen years old when Reginald, in a most courtly fashion, suggested
  that I should come to London with him, and I have exactly the same feelings
  to-day about my acceptance of his proposal as I had then."</p>

  <p>"You are a puzzle," he declared. "You wouldn't be, of course, only you're
  such a&mdash;such a good woman."</p>

  <p>"Of course I am, James," she laughed. "I am good, inasmuch as I am
  faithful to any tie I may make. I am kind, or try to be, to all my fellow
  creatures, and I should hate to do a mean thing. The only difference between
  me and other women is that I prefer to choose what tie I should consider
  sacred. I claimed the liberty to do that, and I exercised it. As to my right
  to do so, I have never had the faintest possible shadow of hesitation."</p>

  <p>"Oh, it all sounds all right when you talk about it," he admitted, "but
  let's come to the crux of this thing now we are about it, Marcia. I am eating
  my heart out for you. I should have thought that one of the great privileges
  of your manner of life was your freedom to change, if you desired to do so.
  Change, I mean&mdash;nothing to do with infidelity. You may have the nicest
  feelings in the world towards your Marquis, but I don't believe you love him
  any more. I don't believe you care for him as much as you do for me."</p>

  <p>"In one sense you are perfectly right," she acknowledged. "In another you
  are altogether wrong."</p>

  <p>"And yet," he continued, almost roughly, "you have never allowed me to
  touch your fingers, much more your lips."</p>

  <p>"But, my dear man," she remonstrated, "you must know that those things are
  impossible. I would kiss you willingly if you were my friend, and if you were
  content with that, but you know it would only be hypocrisy if you pretended
  that you were. But listen," she went on. "I, too, sometimes think of these
  things. I will be very frank with you. I know that I have changed lately, and
  I know that the change has something to do with you. Reginald is sometimes a
  little restless about it. A time may come when he will provoke an
  explanation. When that time comes, I want to answer him with a clear
  conscience."</p>

  <p>Mr. James Borden brightened up considerably.</p>

  <p>"That's the most encouraging thing I've heard you say for a long time," he
  confessed.</p>

  <p>She smiled.</p>

  <p>"There are all sorts of possibilities yet," she said. "Now fetch a clothes
  brush and let me give you a good brushing, and you can take me out to
  lunch&mdash;that is to say, if you can find something decent to wear on your
  head," she went on, pointing to a somewhat disreputable looking hat which
  hung behind the door. "I won't go out with you in that."</p>

  <p>"That," he replied cheerfully, "is easily arranged. I can change my
  clothes in five minutes, if you prefer it."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"You look quite nice when you're properly brushed," she assured him. "Send
  upstairs for another hat, and we'll go into the grill room at the Savoy. I
  want a sole colbert, and a cutlet, and some of those little French peas with
  sugar. Aren't I greedy!"</p>

  <p>"Delightfully," he assented. "If you only realised how much easier it is
  to take a woman out who knows what she wants!"</p>

  <p>They lunched very well amidst a crowd of cosmopolitans and lingered over
  their coffee. Their conversation had been of books and nothing but books, but
  towards the end Marcia once more spoke of herself.</p>

  <p>"You see, James," she told him, "I have the feeling that if Reginald
  really does succeed in freeing the estates from their mortgages, he will have
  any quantity of new interests in life. He will probably be lord-lieutenant of
  the county, and open up the whole of Mandeleys. Then his town life would of
  course be quite different. I shall feel&mdash;can't you appreciate
  that?&mdash;as though my task with him had come naturally and gracefully to
  an end. We have both fulfilled our obligations to one another. If he can give
  me his hand and let me go&mdash;well, I should like it."</p>

  <p>She looked so very desirable as she smiled at him that Borden almost
  groaned. She patted his hand and changed the conversation.</p>

  <p>"Very soon," she continued, "I am going to undertake a painful duty. I am
  going down to Mandeleys."</p>

  <p>"Not with him?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"My father is back in England," she explained. "He has come back from
  America and is living in the cottage of many lawsuits. I must go down and see
  him."</p>

  <p>"Has the boy returned, too?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>"I have heard nothing about him," Marcia replied. "He was very delicate
  when he was young, and I am not even sure whether he is alive. My father
  probably doesn't want to see me in the least, but I feel I ought to go."</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't like me to motor you down, I suppose?" Borden suggested
  diffidently. "The country is delightful just now, and it would do us both
  good. I could get away for three days quite easily, and I could bring some
  work with me to peg away at whilst you are being dutiful."</p>

  <p>"I should love it," she declared frankly, "and I don't see the least
  reason why we shouldn't go. You won't mind," she went on, after a second's
  hesitation, "if I mention it to Reginald? I am sure he won't object."</p>

  <p>James Borden bit through the cigarette which he had just lit, threw it
  away and started another.</p>

  <p>"You must do whatever you think right," he said. "Perhaps you will
  telephone."</p>

  <p>"As soon as I know for certain," she promised him.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

  <p>It was obvious that the Marquis was pleased with himself when he was shown
  into Marcia's little sitting room later on that same afternoon. He was
  wearing a grey tweed check suit, a grey bowler hat, and a bunch of hothouse
  violets in his buttonhole. His demeanour, as he drew off his white chamois
  leather gloves and handed them, with his coat and cane, to the little
  parlourmaid, was urbane, almost benevolent.</p>

  <p>"You look like the springtime," Marcia declared, rising to her feet, "and
  here have I been cowering over the fire!"</p>

  <p>"The wind is cold," her visitor admitted, "but I had a brisk walk along
  the Embankment."</p>

  <p>"Along the Embankment?"</p>

  <p>"I have been to one of those wonderful, cosmopolitan hotels," he told her,
  as he bent down and kissed her, "where they have hundreds of bedrooms and
  every guest is a potential millionaire."</p>

  <p>"Business?"</p>

  <p>"Business," he assented. "My lawyers&mdash;I am very displeased,
  by-the-by, with Mr. Wadham&mdash;having been unable for many years to assist
  me in disposing of the mortgages upon Mandeleys, I am making efforts myself
  in that direction, efforts which, as I believe I told you, show much promise
  of success."</p>

  <p>"I am delighted to hear it," she replied. "From every point of view, it
  would be so satisfactory for you to have the estates freed once more. You
  would be able to entertain properly, wouldn't you, and take up your rightful
  position in the county?"</p>

  <p>The Marquis seated himself in his favourite easy-chair.</p>

  <p>"It is quite true," he confessed, "that I have been unable, for the last
  ten years, to exercise that position in the county to which I am entitled. I
  must confess, moreover, that the small economies which have formed a
  necessary and galling part of my daily life have become almost unendurable.
  You received my cheque, I hope?"</p>

  <p>She nodded and laid it upon the table.</p>

  <p>"It was dear of you, Reginald," she said, "but do you know it's
  astonishing how well I seemed to be able to get on without those last three
  payments. I am earning quite a great deal of money of my own, you know, and I
  do wish you would let me try and be independent."</p>

  <p>His grey eyes were fixed almost coldly upon her.</p>

  <p>"Independent? Why?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't be foolish about it, please," she begged. "For nineteen years,
  I think it is now, you have allowed me six hundred a year. Do you realise
  what a great deal of money that is? Now that I am beginning to earn so much
  for myself, it is absurd for me to go on taking it."</p>

  <p>"Do I understand it to be your desire, then, Marcia," he asked, "to effect
  any change in our relations?"</p>

  <p>She came over and sat on the arm of his chair.</p>

  <p>"Not unless you wish it, dear," she replied, "only the money&mdash;well,
  in a sense I've got used to having it all these years, because it was
  necessary, but now that it isn't necessary, I can't help feeling that I
  should like to do without it. I earned nearly six hundred pounds, you know,
  last year, by my stories."</p>

  <p>The Marquis had half closed his eyes. He had become momentarily
  inattentive. Somehow or other, Marcia realised that her words had brought him
  acute suffering. There were tears in her eyes as she took his hand.</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly about this, Reginald dear," she pleaded. "If it means so
  much to you to feel&mdash;I mean, if you look upon this money as really a tie
  between us&mdash;give me a little less, then&mdash;say three hundred a year,
  instead of six."</p>

  <p>Her visitor was recovering his momentarily disturbed composure.</p>

  <p>"You are still nothing but a child in money matters, dear," he said. "We
  will speak of this again before the end of the year, but in the meantime, if
  you have anything to spare, invest it. It is always well for a woman to have
  something to fall back upon."</p>

  <p>Tea was brought in, and their conversation for a time became lighter in
  tone. Presently, however, Marcia became once more a little thoughtful.</p>

  <p>"I have made up my mind," she declared abruptly, "to go down to Mandeleys
  to see my father."</p>

  <p>The Marquis was silent for a moment. Then he shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Well, why not, if you really feel it to be your duty," he conceded.
  "Personally, I think you will find that Vont is unchanged. You will find him
  just as hard and narrow as when he disowned you."</p>

  <p>"In that case," Marcia acknowledged, "I shall not trouble him very much,
  but when I think of all these years abroad&mdash;it was through me he left
  England, you know, Reginald&mdash;I feel that I ought to do my best, at any
  rate, to make him see things differently&mdash;to beg his forgiveness with my
  lips, even if I feel no remorse in my heart. I have a most uncomfortable
  conviction," she went on reflectively, "that I have grown completely out of
  his world, but, of course, in all this time he, too, may have changed. I
  wonder what has become of my little cousin."</p>

  <p>"Vont came back alone, I believe," her visitor told her, "and he came back
  second class, too. I heard of him, curiously enough, from an American
  gentleman who crossed on the same steamer, and who happened to be a guest at
  my house the other night."</p>

  <p>Marcia nodded.</p>

  <p>"The boy left England too young," she remarked, "to miss his country. I
  suppose he has settled down in America for ever."</p>

  <p>"I must say that I wish Vont had stayed with him," the Marquis declared.
  "Yes, go down and see him, by all means, Marcia. I should rather like to hear
  from you what his state of mind is. I gather that he is obdurate, as he
  resisted all my efforts to repossess myself of his cottage, but it would be
  interesting to hear."</p>

  <p>"Should you mind," she asked, "if I motored down there with my
  publisher&mdash;Mr. James Borden? You have heard me speak of him."</p>

  <p>"Not in the least," was the ready reply. "Has your friend connections in
  the locality?"</p>

  <p>"None," Marcia admitted. "He would come simply for the sake of a day or
  two's holiday, and to take me."</p>

  <p>"He is one of your admirers, perhaps?"</p>

  <p>"He has always been very kind to me."</p>

  <p>The Marquis was momentarily pensive.</p>

  <p>"You are a better judge than I, Marcia," he observed, "but is such an
  expedition as you suggest&mdash;usual? I know that things have changed very
  much since the days when I myself found adventures possible and interesting,
  but have they really progressed so far as this?"</p>

  <p>Marcia considered the matter carefully.</p>

  <p>"On the whole," she decided, "I should say that our proposed expedition
  was unusual. On the other hand, Mr. Borden has no near relatives, and I
  myself enjoy a certain amount of liberty."</p>

  <p>The Marquis smiled at her.</p>

  <p>"As much liberty as you choose. If I hesitated then for a moment, it was
  for your own sake. I do not think that I have ever sought to curtail your
  pleasures, or to interfere in your mode of living."</p>

  <p>"You have been wonderful," she admitted gratefully. "Perhaps for that very
  reason, because my fetters have been of silk, I have never realised but
  always considered them. Do you know that you are the only man who has ever
  sat down in this flat as my guest, during the whole sixteen years I have
  lived here?"</p>

  <p>"I should never have asked you," he said, "but I am not in the least
  surprised to hear it. Sometimes," he went on, drawing her towards him in a
  slight but affectionate embrace, "you have perhaps thought me a little cold,
  a little staid and distant from you, even in our happiest moments. I was
  brought up, you must remember, in the school which considers any exhibition
  of feeling as a deplorable lapse. The thing grows on one. Yet, Marcia," he
  added, drawing her still closer and clasping her hand, "you have been my
  refuge in all these years. It is here with you that I have spent my happiest
  hours. You have been my consolation in many weary disappointments. I often
  wish that I could give you a different position than the one which you
  occupy."</p>

  <p>"I should never be so contented in any other," she assured him, patting
  his hand. "In all these years I have felt my mind grow. I have
  read&mdash;heavens, how I have read! I have felt so many of the old things
  fall away, felt my feet growing stronger. You have given me just what I
  wanted, Reginald. To quote one of your own maxims, we have only one life, but
  it is for us to subdivide. We take up a handful of circumstances, an emotion,
  perhaps a passion, and we live them out, and when the flame is burnt we are
  restless for a little time, and then we begin it all over again. That is how
  we learn, learn to be wise by suffering and change."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," the Marquis sighed, "that I do not live up to my own
  principles. All my life I have detested change. There could be no other home
  for me but Mandeleys, no other clubs save those where I spend my spare time,
  no other pursuits save those which I have cultivated from my youth, no other
  dear friend, Marcia, to whom one may turn in one's more human moments, than
  you."</p>

  <p>Marcia shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"It is queer," she admitted, "to hear such professions of fidelity from
  you."</p>

  <p>"Had I a different reputation?" he asked. "Well, you see how I have
  outlived it."</p>

  <p>Marcia's silence, natural enough at the time, puzzled him a little
  afterwards, puzzled him as he leaned back in his car, on his way homewards,
  puzzled him through the evening in the few minutes of reflection which he was
  able to spare from a large dinner party.</p>

  <p>"Borden!" he muttered to himself. "I wonder what sort of a man he is."</p>

  <p>In his library, where he lingered for a few moments before retiring to
  bed, he took down a volume of "Who's Who." Borden's name, rather to his
  surprise, was there. The man, it seemed, was of decent family, had done well
  at Oxford, both in scholarship and athletics. He was born&mdash;the Marquis
  counted his years. He was forty-one years old&mdash;nineteen years younger!
  He closed the book and sat down in his chair, forgetting for once to mix for
  himself the whiskey and soda which lay ready to his hand. It seemed to him
  that there was a tragedy in that nineteen years. Borden was of the age now
  that he himself had been when Marcia had first listened to his very courtly
  and yet uncommonly definite love-making. He rose almost like a thief, crossed
  the hall, and, opening softly the door of the drawing-room, turned up the two
  lights before a great gilt mirror. He stood and regarded himself
  thoughtfully, appraisingly, critically. He was tall and very little bowed.
  His figure was still the figure of a young man, and the court clothes which
  he was wearing became him. That he was handsome so far as regards his finely
  chiselled features, his high forehead and his soft grey hair, he granted
  himself. The world had given him few chances of forgetting it. But there was
  a little whiteness about his cheeks, a slight dropping of the flesh under his
  eyes, just something of that tired look which creeps along with the years, a
  silent, persistent ghost. The Marquis switched off the lights and turned
  towards the door. He tiptoed his way across the hall and threw himself once
  more into his easy-chair. His eyes were fixed upon the opposite wall. He
  still saw that presentment of himself. And there was Marcia, barely in the
  prime of her life, the figure of her girlhood developed, yet not, even now,
  matronly; her bright complexion, her broad, intellectual forehead with its
  masses of brown hair, her humorous mouth, her dark, undimmed eyes, still
  hungry for what life might have to give. Those nineteen years remained a
  tragedy.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

  <p>David Thain, arrived at the end of his journey, seated himself on the
  second stile from the road, threw away his cigar and looked facts in the
  face. He who had run the gamut of the Wall Street fever, who in his earlier
  days had relied almost upon chance for a meal, who had stood the tests of
  huge successes as well as the anxieties of possible failures without visible
  emotion&mdash;in such a fashion, even, that his closest friends could
  scarcely tell whether he were winning or losing&mdash;found himself now,
  without any crisis before him, and engaged in the most ordinary undertaking
  of a stroll from the station across a few fields, suddenly the victim of
  sensations and weaknesses which defied analysis and mocked at restraint. It
  was the England of his boyhood, this, the sudden almost overpowering
  realisation of those dreams which had grown fainter and fainter during his
  many years of struggle in a very different atmosphere. Birds were singing in
  the long grove which, behind the high, grey-stone wall, fringed the road for
  miles. Rooks&mdash;real English rooks&mdash;were cawing above his head. A
  light evening breeze was bending the meadow grass of the field which his
  footpath had cloven, and from the hedge by his side came the faint perfume of
  hawthorn blossom. Before him was the park with its splendours of giant oaks,
  with deer resting beneath the trees, and in the distance the grey, irregular
  outline of Mandeleys Abbey. He had played cricket, when he was a boy, in the
  very field through which he was passing. Some time in that dim past, he had
  stood with his uncle, whilst he had issued with the beaters from that long
  strip of plantation, watching with all a boy's fervid admiration the careless
  ease with which the Lord of Mandeleys was bringing the pheasants down from
  the sky. He had skated on the lake there, had watched at a respectful
  distance the antics of the ladies Letitia and Margaret, anxious to escape
  from their retinue of servants and attendants. A queer little vision came
  before him at that moment of Lady Letitia hobbling towards him upon the ice,
  with one skate unbuckled, and a firm but gracious entreaty that the little
  boy&mdash;he was at least a head taller than she&mdash;would fasten it for
  her. Strange little flashes of memory had come to him now and then in that
  new world where he had carved his way to success, memories so indistinct that
  they brought with them no thrills, scarcely even any longing. And now all his
  strength and hardness, qualities so necessary to him throughout his strenuous
  life, seemed to have passed away. He was a child again, breathing in all
  these simple sights and perfumes, his memory taking him even further back to
  the days when he sat in the meadow, in the hot sun, picking daisies and
  buttercups, and watching for the fish that sometimes jumped from the stream.
  It was an entirely unexpected emotion, this. When once more he strode along
  the footpath, he felt a different man. He had lost his slight touch of
  assurance. He looked about him eagerly, almost appealingly. He was ashamed to
  confess even to himself that he had the feeling of a wanderer who has come
  home.</p>

  <p>He crossed the last stile and was now in the park proper. Several
  villagers were strolling about under the trees, and they looked at this
  newcomer, with his dark-coloured clothes and strangely-shaped hat, with some
  surprise. Nevertheless, he held uninterruptedly on his way until he reached
  the broad drive which led to the Abbey. He walked on the turf by the side of
  it, over the bridge which crossed the stream, through the inner iron gates,
  beyond which the village people were not allowed to pass, and so to the
  well-remembered spot. On his right was the house&mdash;a strange, uneven
  building, at times ecclesiastical, here and there domestic, always ancient,
  with its wings of cloisters running almost down to the moat which surrounded
  it. And just over the moat, crossed by that light iron handbridge, with its
  back against what he remembered as a plantation, but which had now become a
  wood, the little red brick cottage, smothered all over with creepers, its
  tiny garden ablaze with flowers, its empty rows of dog kennels, its deserted
  line of coops. David glanced for a moment at the drawn blinds of the Abbey.
  Then he crossed the footbridge and the few yards of meadow, lifted the latch
  of the gate and, walking up the gravel path, came to a sudden standstill. A
  man who was seated almost hidden by a great cluster of fox-gloves rose to his
  feet.</p>

  <p>"It's you, then, lad!" he exclaimed, holding out both his hands. "You're
  welcome! There's no one to the house&mdash;there won't be for a quarter of an
  hour&mdash;so I'll wring your hands once more. It's a queer world, this,
  David. You're back with me here, where I brought you up as a stripling, and
  yon's the Abbey. Sit you down, boy. I am not the man I was since I came
  here."</p>

  <p>David Thain dragged an old-fashioned kitchen chair from the porch, and sat
  by his uncle's side. Richard Vont, although he was still younger than his
  sixty-four years, seemed to his nephew curiously changed during the last
  week. The hard, resolute face was disturbed. The mouth, kept so tight through
  the years, had weakened a little. There was a vague, almost pathetic
  agitation, in the man's face.</p>

  <p>"You'll take no notice of me, David," his uncle went on. "I'm honest with
  you. These few days have been like a great, holy dream, like something one
  reads of in the Scriptures but never expects to see. There's old Mary
  Wells&mdash;she's doing for me up there. Just a word or two of surprise, and
  a grip of the hand, and no more. And there's the Abbey&mdash;curse
  it!&mdash;not a stone gone, only the windows are blank. You see the weeds on
  the lawn, David? Do you mark the garden behind? They tell me there's but two
  gardeners there to do the work of twenty. And the drive&mdash;look at it as
  far as you can see&mdash;moss and weed! They're coming down in the world,
  these Mandeleys, David. Even this last little lawsuit, the lawyers told me,
  has cost the Marquis nineteen thousand pounds. God bless you for your wealth,
  David! It's money that counts in these days."</p>

  <p>David produced a pouch of tobacco from his pocket and handed it over to
  his uncle, who filled a pipe eagerly.</p>

  <p>"That's thoughtful of you, David," he declared. "I'd forgotten to buy any,
  and that's a fact, for I can't stand the village yet. You're looking
  strange-like, David."</p>

  <p>"And I feel it," was the quiet answer. "Uncle, hasn't it made any
  difference to you, this coming back?"</p>

  <p>"In what way?" the old man asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't know. I walked across those fields to the park, and I
  seemed suddenly to feel more like a boy again, and I felt that somehow I was
  letting go of things. Do you know what I mean?"</p>

  <p>"Letting go of things," Richard Vont repeated suspiciously. "No!"</p>

  <p>"Well, somehow or other," David continued, as he filled his own pipe and
  lit it, "I found myself looking back through the years, and I wondered
  whether we hadn't both let one thing grow too big in our minds. Life doesn't
  vary much here. Things are very much as we left them, and it's all rather
  wonderful. I felt a little ashamed, as I came up through the park, of some of
  the things we've planned and sworn. Didn't you feel a little like that,
  uncle? Can you sit here and think of the past, and remember all that burden
  we carried, and not feel inclined to let it slip, or just a little of it
  slip, from our shoulders?"</p>

  <p>Vont laid down his pipe. He rose to his feet. His fingers suddenly gripped
  his nephew's shoulder. He turned him towards the house.</p>

  <p>"Listen, David," he said; "there's twilight an hour away yet, but it will
  soon be here. The blackbirds are calling for it, and the wind's dropping. Now
  you see. That was her room," he added, touching the window, "and there's the
  door out, just the same. You see that tree there? I was crouching behind that
  with my gun ready loaded, and there was murder in my heart&mdash;I tell you
  that, boy. I watched the Abbey. I was supposed to be safe in Fakenham Town,
  safe for a good two hours, and I lay there and watched because I knew, and no
  one came. And then I heard a whisper. I turned my head, although I was most
  afeared, and out of that door&mdash;that door from Marcia's room,
  David&mdash;I saw him come. I saw her arms come out and draw him back, and
  then I began to breathe hard, but the trees were thick that way&mdash;I'd
  been looking for him coming from the Abbey&mdash;-and they stole out
  together, arm in arm. I was so near them that they must have heard me groan,
  for Marcia started. And then, before I knew what was happening, he&mdash;the
  Marquis, mind&mdash;had struck up my gun, caught it by the barrel and sent it
  flying. My hand was on his throat, but he was as strong as I was, in those
  days, and a mighty wrestler. It's my shame, boy, after all these years to
  have to confess it, but he got the better of me. I was crazy with anger, and
  he had me down. And then he stood aside and bade me get up, and my strength
  seemed all gone. He stood there looking at me contemptuously. 'Don't make a
  fool of yourself, Vont,' he said. 'Your daughter and I understand one
  another, and our concerns have nothing to do with you. If you have anything
  to say to me, come up to the Abbey to-morrow. You'll find your gun in the
  thicket.' He turned round and he kissed Marcia's fingers, just like I'd seen
  them do in the distance at their fine parties up there, and he strolled away.
  There was the gun in the thicket, and he knew it, and I knew it, and I
  couldn't move, and he went. And all I could hear was Marcia crying, and those
  birds singing behind, and I just slipped away into the wood."</p>

  <p>"Uncle, is it worth while bringing this all up again?" David
  interrupted.</p>

  <p>"Aye, it's worth while!" the old man insisted fiercely. "It's worth while
  for fear I should forget, for the old place has its cling on me. That next
  day I went to the Abbey, and I saw the Marquis. He was quite cool, sent the
  servants out&mdash;he'd no weapon near&mdash;and he talked a lot that I don't
  understand and never shall understand, but it was about Marcia, and that she
  was his, and was leaving with him for London that evening. I just asked him
  one question. 'It's for shame, then?' I asked. And he looked at me just as
  though I were some person whom he was trying to make understand, who didn't
  quite speak the language. And he said&mdash;'Your daughter made her choice
  months ago, Vont. She will live the life she desires to live. I am sorry to
  take her away from you. Think it over, and try and feel sensible about it.'
  It was then I felt a strange joy, that I've never been able rightly to
  understand. I'd just remembered that the cottage was mine, and I had a sudden
  feeling that I wanted to sit at the end of the garden and watch the Abbey and
  curse it, curse it with a Bible on my knee, till its stones fell apart and
  the grass grew up from the walks and the damp grew out in blotches on the
  walls. And that's why I've come back after all these years."</p>

  <p>"And you're just the same?" David asked curiously. "You feel just the same
  about him?"</p>

  <p>"Don't you, my lad?" his uncle demanded. "You're not telling me that
  you're climbing down?"</p>

  <p>David took the old man's arm.</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, uncle," he said, "my promised share of the work is done.
  I hold his promissory notes for forty thousand pounds, due in three months. I
  have sold him some shares that aren't worth forty thousand pence, and won't
  be for many a year. I've cheated him, if you like, but when the three months
  comes you can make him a bankrupt, if you will. I'll give you the notes."</p>

  <p>Richard Vont drew himself up. He turned his face towards the Abbey,
  growing a little indistinct now in the falling twilight.</p>

  <p>"It's grand hearing," was all he said. "There's Mary, coming round with
  the supper, boy. I'll take the liberty of asking you to have a bite with me
  and a glass of ale, but I'll not forget that you're the great David Thain,
  the millionaire from America, who took kindly notice of me on the steamer.
  Come this way, sir," he went on, throwing open the cottage door. "It's a
  queer little place, but it's a novelty for you American gentlemen. Step right
  in, sir. Mrs. Wells," he announced, "this is a gentleman who was kind to me
  upon the steamer, and he promised that if ever he was this way he'd drop in.
  He'll take some supper with me. You'll do your best for us?"</p>

  <p>The old lady looked very hard at David Thain, and she dropped a
  curtsey.</p>

  <p>"From America, too," she murmured. "'Tis a wonderful country! Aye, I'll do
  my best, Richard Vont."</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

  <p>Mr. Wadham, Junior, a morning or so later, rang the bell at Number 94
  Grosvenor Square and aired himself for a moment upon the broad doorstep,
  filled with a comfortable sense that this time, at least, in his prospective
  interview, he was destined to disturb the disconcerting equanimity of his
  distinguished client. He was duly admitted and ushered into the presence of
  the Marquis, who laid down the newspaper which he was reading, nodded affably
  to his visitor and pointed to a chair.</p>

  <p>"Your request for an interview, Mr. Wadham," the former said, "anticipated
  my own desire to see you. Pray be seated. I am entirely at your service."</p>

  <p>Mr. Wadham paused for a moment and decided to cross his legs. He was
  already struggling against that enervating sense of insignificance which his
  client's presence inevitably imposed upon him.</p>

  <p>"We heard yesterday morning from Mr. Merridrew," he commenced. "He made us
  a remittance which was four hundred pounds short of what we expected. His
  explanation was that your lordship had received that sum from him."</p>

  <p>"Quite right, Mr. Wadham," the Marquis assented affably. "Quite right. I
  was in the neighbourhood, and, finding Mr. Merridrew with a considerable sum
  of money in hand, I took from him precisely the amount you have stated."</p>

  <p>"Your lordship has perhaps overlooked the fact," Mr. Wadham continued,
  "that we are that amount short of the interest on the Fakenham
  mortgage&mdash;Number Seven mortgage, we usually call it."</p>

  <p>"Dear me!" the Marquis observed. "Surely such a trifling sum does not
  disturb your calculations? You do not run my affairs on so narrow a margin as
  this, I trust, Mr. Wadham?"</p>

  <p>"It isn't a question of a narrow margin, your lordship," Mr. Wadham
  replied. "There is, as a rule, no margin at all. We usually have to make the
  amount up by overdrawing, or by advancing it ourselves. This time the firm
  wish me to point out that we are unable to do either."</p>

  <p>"Dear me! Dear me!" the Marquis ejaculated, in a tone of some concern. "I
  had no idea, Mr. Wadham, if you will forgive my saying so, that your firm was
  in so impecunious a position."</p>

  <p>"Impecunious?" the lawyer murmured, with his eyes fixed upon his client.
  "I scarcely follow your lordship."</p>

  <p>"Did I not understand you to say," the Marquis continued, "that this
  trifle of four hundred pounds has upset your arrangements to such an extent
  that you are unable to make your customary payments on my behalf?"</p>

  <p>"Will your lordship forgive my pointing out," Mr. Wadham explained, "that
  these payments are on your account, and that it is no part of the business of
  solicitors to finance their clients, without a special arrangement? We have
  our own more lucrative investments continually open to us, and we are at the
  present moment several thousand pounds out of pocket on account of recent law
  expenses."</p>

  <p>"The whole thing," the Marquis pronounced, "seems to me very trifling.
  State in precise terms, if you please, Mr. Wadham, the object of your
  visit."</p>

  <p>"To ask for your lordship's instructions as to the payment of twelve
  hundred pounds interest, due to-morrow," Mr. Wadham replied. "We have eight
  hundred pounds in hand from Mr. Merridrew. So far from having any other funds
  of your lordship's at our disposal, we are, as I have pointed out, your
  creditor for a somewhat considerable amount."</p>

  <p>The Marquis was leaning back in his chair, the tips of his long, elegant
  fingers pressed gently together.</p>

  <p>"It appears to me, Mr. Wadham," he said quietly, "that your visit is, in a
  sense, an admonitory one. Your firm resents&mdash;am I not right?&mdash;the
  fact that I have found it convenient to help myself to a portion of the
  revenue accruing from my estate."</p>

  <p>"We should not presume for a moment to take up such an attitude," the
  lawyer protested. "On the other hand, the four hundred pounds in question
  requires replacement by to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"And you find the raising of that sum inconvenient, eh, Mr. Wadham?"</p>

  <p>The young man was distinctly ill at ease. His instructions were to be firm
  and dignified but by no means to offend; to deliver a formal protest against
  this tampering with funds already dedicate, but to do or say nothing which
  would give the Marquis any excuse for reprisals against the firm. Mr. Wadham
  began to wonder whether perhaps he was a person of small tact, or whether
  these instructions were more than usually difficult to carry out.</p>

  <p>"There is no sacrifice, your lordship," he said slowly, "which my firm
  would hesitate to make in your interests and the interests of the Mandeleys
  estate. At the same time, the unexpected necessity for finding these sums of
  money is, I must confess, at times a strain upon us."</p>

  <p>The Marquis nodded sympathetically. He rose to his feet, crossed the room
  towards his desk, which he unlocked with a key attached to a gold chain, and
  returned with a bundle of scrip in his hand.</p>

  <p>"I have here, Mr. Wadham," he announced, "scrip in a very famous oil
  company, the face value of the shares being, I believe, a trifle over forty
  thousand pounds. I, in fact, paid that price for them at the beginning of the
  week."</p>

  <p>The young lawyer uncrossed his legs and swallowed hard. He was prepared
  for many shocks, but this one seemed outside the region of all human
  probability.</p>

  <p>"Did I understand your lordship to say that you had paid forty thousand
  pounds for them?" he gasped.</p>

  <p>The Marquis assented with an equable little nod.</p>

  <p>"I was somewhat favoured in the matter," he admitted, "as the value of the
  shares has, I believe, already considerably increased. The amount I actually
  paid for them was, in round figures, forty thousand and one hundred
  pounds&mdash;transfer duty, or something of that sort. I have little head for
  figures, as you know, Mr. Wadham. You had better take these&mdash;not for
  sale, mind, but for deposit at one of my banks. You will probably find that,
  under the circumstances, they will permit you to overdraw an additional five
  hundred pounds on my account, without embarrassing your own finances."</p>

  <p>Mr. Wadham, Junior, took the bundle of scrip into his hand, and glanced
  hastily through it.</p>

  <p>"The Pluto Oil Company of Arizona," he murmured reflectively.</p>

  <p>"The name of the company is doubtless unknown to you," the Marquis
  observed indulgently; "they are, in fact, only just commencing
  operations&mdash;but it is the opinion of my friend and financial adviser,
  Mr. David Thain, that the forty thousand pounds' worth of shares you have in
  your hand will be worth at least two hundred thousand before the end of the
  year."</p>

  <p>"Mr. David Thain, the multi-millionaire?" Mr. Wadham faltered.</p>

  <p>"The same!"</p>

  <p>The lawyer gripped the bundle hard in one hand, closed his eyes for a
  moment, opened them again and struck out boldly.</p>

  <p>"As your lordship's adviser," he said, "may I enquire as to the nature of
  the payment which you have made? Forty thousand pounds is not a sum which
  either of the banks with whom your lordship has credit&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The Marquis waved his hand.</p>

  <p>"My dear young friend," he explained, "it was not necessary for me to
  resort to banks. Mr. Thain suggested voluntarily that I should give him my
  note of hand for the amount. He quite understood that a man whose chief
  interest in the country is land does not keep such a sum as forty thousand
  pounds lying at his banker's."</p>

  <p>Mr. Wadham groped for his hat.</p>

  <p>"The shares shall be deposited, and the interest, of course, paid," he
  murmured. "I am sorry to have troubled your lordship in the matter."</p>

  <p>"Not at all, not at all," the Marquis replied genially. "Very pleased to
  see you at any time, Mr. Wadham, on any subject connected with the estates.
  Ah!" he added, glancing at a card which a footman at that moment had brought
  in, "here is my friend, Mr. David Thain. You must meet him, Mr. Wadham. Such
  men are rare in this country. They form most interesting adjuncts to our
  modern civilisation. Show Mr. Thain in, Thomas."</p>

  <p>David Thain duly arrived. He shook hands with the Marquis and was by him
  presented to Mr. Wadham.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Wadham is my legal advisor&mdash;or rather a junior representative of
  the firm who conduct my affairs," the Marquis explained. "I have just handed
  him over my shares in the Pluto Oil Company, for safe keeping."</p>

  <p>"Very glad to know you, Mr. Thain," the young lawyer observed, reverently
  shaking hands. "One reads a great deal of your financial exploits in the
  newspapers just now."</p>

  <p>"I really can't see," David replied, "that your press men are much better
  over here than in the States. In any case, Mr. Wadham, you mustn't believe
  all you read."</p>

  <p>"You will give my regards to your father and the other members of your
  firm," the Marquis concluded, with the faintest possible indication of his
  head towards the door. "I shall probably have some instructions of an
  interesting nature to give you before long, with regard to the cancellation
  of, at any rate, the home estate mortgages. Ah, here is Thomas! Very much
  obliged for your attention, Mr. Wadham."</p>

  <p>The lawyer made his adieux in somewhat confused fashion, and left the room
  with an ignominious sense of dismissal. The Marquis glanced at the clock.</p>

  <p>"I am a creature of habit, Mr. Thain," he said. "At twelve o'clock I walk
  for an hour in the Park. Will you give me the honour of your company?"</p>

  <p>"Anywhere you say," David assented. "There was just a little matter I
  wanted to mention&mdash;nothing important."</p>

  <p>"Precisely," the Marquis murmured, ringing the bell. "You will return to
  lunch, of course? I shall take no denial. My daughter would be distressed to
  miss you. Gossett," he added, as they moved out into the hall, "my coat and
  hat, and tell Lady Letitia that Mr. Thain will lunch with us. Have you any
  idea, Gossett," he added, as he accepted his cane and gloves, "how to make
  cocktails?"</p>

  <p>"I have a book of recipes, your lordship," was the somewhat doubtful
  reply.</p>

  <p>"See that cocktails are served before luncheon," the Marquis instructed.
  "You see, we are not altogether ignorant of the habits of your countrymen,
  Mr. Thain, even if in some cases we may not ourselves have adopted them. A
  cocktail is, I gather, some form of alcoholic nourishment?"</p>

  <p>Thain indulged in what was, for him, a rare luxury&mdash;a hearty laugh.
  He threw his head back, showing all his white, firm teeth, and the little
  lines at the sides of his eyes wrinkled up with enjoyment. Suddenly a voice
  on the stairs interposed.</p>

  <p>"I must know the joke," Letitia declared. "How do you do, Mr. Thain? A
  laugh like yours makes one feel positively delirious with the desire to share
  it. Father, do tell me what it was?"</p>

  <p>"To tell you the truth, my dear," the Marquis replied, quite honestly, "I
  am a little ignorant as to the humorous application of a remark I have just
  made."</p>

  <p>"It was your father's definition of an American institution, Lady
  Letitia," David explained, "and I am afraid that its humour depended solely
  upon a certain environment which I was able to conjure up in my mind&mdash;a
  barroom at the Waldorf, say."</p>

  <p>"Another disappointment," Letitia sighed.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Thain is lunching with us, dear," her father announced.</p>

  <p>"So glad," Letitia remarked, nodding to Thain. "We shall meet again,
  then."</p>

  <p>She passed out of the front door, and David, who was very observant,
  noticing several things, was silent for the first few moments after her
  departure. She appeared, as she could scarcely fail to appear in his eyes,
  charming even to the point of bewilderment. Yet, although the wind was cold,
  she had only a small and very inadequate fur collar around her neck. Her
  tailormade suit showed signs of constant brushings. There was a
  little&mdash;a very modest little patch upon her shoes, and a very distinct
  darn upon her gloves. David frowned in puzzled fashion as he turned into the
  Park. Some of his boyish antipathies, so carefully nursed by his uncle and
  fostered by the atmosphere in which they lived during his early days in
  America, flashed into his memory, only to be instantly discarded. He
  remembered the drawn blinds, the weedy walks of Mandeleys; the hasty glimpse
  which he had had of silent, empty rooms and uncarpeted ways in the higher
  storeys of the mansion in Grosvenor Square.</p>

  <p>"I am not a person," the Marquis observed, as they proceeded upon their
  promenade, "who needs a great deal of exercise, but I am almost a slave to
  habit, and for many years, when in town, it has been my custom to walk here
  for an hour, to exchange greetings, perhaps, with a few acquaintances, to
  call at my club for ten minutes and take a glass of dry sherry before
  luncheon. In the afternoons," he went on, "I occasionally play a round of
  golf at Ranelagh. Are you an expert at the game, Mr. Thain?"</p>

  <p>"I have made blasphemous efforts," David confessed, "but I certainly
  cannot call myself an expert. Perhaps what is known as the American spirit
  has rather interfered with my efforts. You see, we want to get things done
  too quickly. Golf is a game eminently suited to the British temperament."</p>

  <p>"You are doubtless right," the Marquis murmured. "That loitering backward
  swing, eh?&mdash;the lazy indisposition to raise one's head? I follow you,
  Mr. Thain. Your call this morning, by-the-by," he went on. "You have some
  news, perhaps, of these Pluto Oils?"</p>

  <p>David shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I came to see you," he announced, "upon a different matter."</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

  <p>The Marquis was occupied for several minutes in exchanging greetings with
  passing acquaintances. As soon as they were alone again, he reverted to his
  companion's observation.</p>

  <p>"There was a matter, I think you said, Mr. Thain, which you wished to
  discuss with me."</p>

  <p>"I was going to ask you about Broomleys," David replied.</p>

  <p>The Marquis was puzzled.</p>

  <p>"Broomleys? Are you referring, by chance, to my house of that name?"</p>

  <p>"I guess so."</p>

  <p>"But, my dear Mr. Thain, you surprise me," the Marquis declared. "When did
  you hear of Broomleys?"</p>

  <p>"I should have explained," David continued, "that I spent this last
  week-end at Cromer. There I visited an agent and told him that I would like
  to take a furnished house in the neighbourhood. I motored over, at his
  suggestion, to see Broomleys, and the tenant, Colonel Laycey, kindly showed
  me over. He is leaving within a few days, I believe."</p>

  <p>"Dear me, of course he is!" the Marquis observed genially. "I had quite
  forgotten the fact&mdash;quite forgotten it."</p>

  <p>The Marquis saluted more acquaintances. He was glad of an opportunity for
  reflection. The Fates were indeed smiling upon him! A gleam of anticipatory
  delight shone in his eyes as he thought of his next interview with Mr.
  Wadham, Junior! On his desk at the present moment there lay a letter from the
  firm, announcing Colonel Laycey's departure and adding that they saw little
  hope of letting the house at all in its present condition.</p>

  <p>"It would be a great pleasure to us, Mr. Thain," the Marquis continued
  pleasantly, "to have you for a neighbour. Did the agent or Colonel Laycey,
  by-the-by, say anything about the rent?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing whatever," David replied. "The Colonel pointed out to me various
  repairs which certainly seemed necessary, but as I am a single man, the rooms
  affected could very well be closed for a time. It was the garden, I must
  confess, which chiefly attracted me."</p>

  <p>"Broomleys has, I fear, been a little neglected," the Marquis sighed.
  "These stringent days, with their campaign of taxation upon the landed
  proprietor, have left me, I regret to say, a poor man. Colonel Laycey was not
  always considerate. His last letter, I remember, spoke of restorations which
  would have meant a couple of years' rent."</p>

  <p>"If I find any little thing wants doing urgently when I get there," David
  promised carelessly, "I will have it seen to myself. If the rent you ask is
  not prohibitive, it is exactly the place I should like to take for, say, a
  year, at any rate."</p>

  <p>"You are a man of modest tastes, Mr. Thain," the Marquis observed. "The
  fact that you are unmarried, however, of course renders an establishment an
  unnecessary burden. You will bear in mind, so far as regards the rent of
  Broomleys, Mr. Thain, that the house is furnished."</p>

  <p>"Very uncomfortably but very attractively furnished, from what I saw,"
  David assented.</p>

  <p>The Marquis collected himself. Colonel Laycey had been asked three hundred
  a year and was paying two hundred, a sum which, somehow or other, the Marquis
  had always considered his own pocket money, and which had never gone into the
  estate accounts. A little increase would certainly be pleasant.</p>

  <p>"Would five hundred a year seem too much, Mr. Thain?" he asked. "I cannot
  for the moment remember what Colonel Laycey is paying, but I know that it is
  something ridiculously inadequate."</p>

  <p>"Five hundred a year would be quite satisfactory," David agreed.</p>

  <p>"I will have the papers drawn up and sent to you at once," the Marquis
  promised. "You will be able to enter into possession as soon as you like. You
  would like a yearly tenancy, I presume?"</p>

  <p>"That would suit me quite well."</p>

  <p>"You will be able, also, to resume your acquaintance with that singular
  old man whom you met upon the steamer&mdash;Richard Vont," the Marquis
  remarked, with a slight grimace. "I hear that he is in residence there."</p>

  <p>"I have already done so," David announced.</p>

  <p>The Marquis raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"You have probably heard his story, then, from his own lips," he observed
  carelessly. "I am told that he sits out on the lawn of his cottage, reading
  the Bible and cursing Mandeleys. It is a most annoying thing, Mr. Thain, as I
  dare say you can understand, to have your ex-gamekeeper entrenched, as it
  were, in front of your premises, hurling curses across the moat at you. That
  class of person is so tenacious of ideas as well as of life. Here comes my
  daughter Letitia, already well escorted, I see."</p>

  <p>Letitia, with Grantham by her side, waved her hand without pausing, from
  the other side of the broad pathway. David for a moment felt the chill of the
  east wind.</p>

  <p>"Grantham," the Marquis told his companion confidentially, "is one of Lady
  Letitia's most constant admirers. My daughter, as I dare say you have
  discovered, Mr. Thain, is rather an unusual young woman. Her predilections
  are almost anti-matrimonial. Still, I must confess that an alliance with the
  Granthams would give me much pleasure. I should, in that case, be enabled to
  give up my town house and be content with bachelor apartments&mdash;a great
  saving, in these hard times."</p>

  <p>"Naturally," David murmured.</p>

  <p>"Often, in the course of our very agreeable conversations," the Marquis
  went on, "I am inclined to ignore the fact of your most amazing opulence. My
  few friends, I am sorry to say, are in a different position. Money in this
  country is very scarce, Mr. Thain&mdash;very scarce, at least, on this side
  of Temple Bar."</p>

  <p>David answered a little vaguely. His eyes were lifted above the heads of
  the scattered crowd of people through which they were passing.</p>

  <p>"May I ask&mdash;if it is not an impertinence," he said,&mdash;"is Lady
  Letitia engaged to Lord Charles Grantham?"</p>

  <p>The Marquis's manner was perhaps a shade stiffer. Mr. Thain was just given
  to understand that about the family matters of such a personage as the
  Marquis of Mandeleys there must always be a certain reticence.</p>

  <p>"There is no formal engagement, Mr. Thain," he replied. "The fashion
  nowadays seems to preclude anything of the sort. One's daughter just brings a
  young man in, and, in place of the delightful betrothal of our younger days,
  the date for the marriage is fixed upon the spot."</p><a name="P96"
        id="P96"></a>

  <p>Luncheon at 94 Grosvenor Square, notwithstanding the cocktails, was an
  exceedingly simple meal, a fact which the Marquis himself seemed scarcely to
  notice. He kept his eye on his visitor's plate, however, and passed the
  cutlets with an unnoticeable sigh of regret.</p>

  <p>"Charlie wouldn't come in to lunch, father," Letitia announced. "I think
  he was afraid you were going to ask him his intentions."</p>

  <p>The Marquis glanced at the modicum of curry with which he was consoling
  himself.</p>

  <p>"Upon the whole, my dear," he said, "I am glad that he stayed away. He is
  a most agreeable person, but not at his best at luncheon time. By-the-by, do
  you know who our new neighbour is to be at Broomleys?"</p>

  <p>"You haven't let it?" she asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>"This morning, my dear," her father replied, bowing slightly towards their
  guest. "Mr. Thain has been spending the week-end at Cromer, was offered
  Broomleys by the agent there, and he and I fixed up the matter only a few
  minutes ago."</p>

  <p>"How perfectly delightful!" Letitia exclaimed.</p>

  <p>David glanced up quickly. He looked his hostess in the eyes.</p>

  <p>"That is very kind of you, Lady Letitia," he said. She laughed at him.</p>

  <p>"Well, I meant it," she declared, "and I still mean it, but not, perhaps,
  exactly in the way it sounded. Of course, it will be very pleasant to have
  you for a neighbour, but to tell you the truth&mdash;you see, although we're
  poor we are honest&mdash;our own sojourn at Mandeleys rather depends on
  whether we let Broomleys, and Colonel Laycey, although he has the most
  delightful daughter, with whom you are sure to fall in love, was a most
  troublesome tenant. He was always wanting things done, wasn't he,
  father?"</p>

  <p>"It is certainly a relief," the Marquis sighed, watching with satisfaction
  the arrival of half a Stilton cheese, a present from his son-in-law, "a great
  relief to find a tenant like Mr. Thain."</p>

  <p>"I asked your agent," David remarked a little diffidently, "about the
  shooting."</p>

  <p>The Marquis touched his glass.</p>

  <p>"Serve port, Gossett," he directed,&mdash;"the light wood port, if we have
  any," he added a little hastily, to the obvious relief of his domestic. "The
  shooting, eh, Mr. Thain?"</p>

  <p>He sipped his wine and considered. First Broomleys, and then the shooting!
  The gods were very kind to him on this pleasant April morning.</p>

  <p>"You haven't preserved lately, I understand," his guest observed.</p>

  <p>"Not for some years," the Marquis acknowledged.</p>

  <p>"I don't mind about that at all," David went on. "I am just American
  enough, you know, to find no pleasure in shooting tame birds. I shall have no
  parties, and I shall not be ambitious about bags. I like to prowl about
  myself with a gun."</p>

  <p>His host nodded appreciatively.</p>

  <p>"You shall have the refusal of the shooting," he promised. "At the moment
  I am not prepared to quote terms. My people of business can do that."</p>

  <p>"Have you no friends in England, Mr. Thain?" Letitia asked, a little
  abruptly.</p>

  <p>"Very few," David replied. "I do not make friends easily."</p>

  <p>"I always thought Americans were so sociable," she remarked. "A great many
  of your compatriots have settled down here, you know."</p>

  <p>David considered the matter for a moment.</p>

  <p>"You would smile, I suppose," he said, "if I were to tell you that there
  are more so-called 'sets' in American Society than in your own. I am a very
  self-made man indeed, and I possess no womenkind to entertain for me. I am
  therefore dependent upon chance acquaintances."</p>

  <p>"Such friends as may make your sojourn in Norfolk more agreeable, Mr.
  Thain," the Marquis promised genially, "you shall most certainly find.
  Mandeleys will always be open to you."</p>

  <p>David made no immediate response. His teeth had come together with a
  little click. He felt a strange repugnance to lifting the glass, which the
  butler had just filled, to his lips. A queer little vision of Mandeleys and
  the cottage was there, Richard Vont, seated amongst those drooping rose
  bushes, his face turned towards the Abbey, his eyes full of that strange,
  expectant light. A sudden wave of self-disgust almost broke through a
  composure which had so far resisted all assaults upon it. Almost he felt that
  he must rise from his place, tell this strange, polished, yet curiously
  childlike being the truth&mdash;that he was being drawn into the nets of
  ruin&mdash;that he was entertaining an enemy unawares.</p>

  <p>"You must really try that wine, Mr. Thain," he heard his host say gently.
  "I make no excuse for not offering you vintage port. At Mandeleys I have at
  least the remnants of a cellar. You shall dine with us there, Mr. Thain, and
  I will give you what my grandfather used to declare was 1838 vintage."</p>

  <p>David roused himself with an effort. He brushed aside the uncomfortable
  twinge of conscience which had suddenly depressed him, and turning away from
  Letitia, looked his host in the eyes.</p>

  <p>"You are very kind," he said. "I shall come with much pleasure."</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

  <p>The Duchess waved her sugar tongs imperiously, and David, who had
  hesitated upon the threshold of her drawing-room, made his way towards her.
  There were a dozen people sitting around, drinking tea and chatting in little
  groups.</p>

  <p>"Now don't look sulky, please," she begged, as she gave him her left hand.
  "This is not a tea party, and it is quite true that I did ask you to come and
  have a chat with me alone, but I couldn't keep these people away. They'll all
  go directly, and if they don't I shall turn them out. Letitia has promised me
  to take care of you and to see that no one bites. Letitia, here is the shy
  man," she added. "There!"&mdash;thrusting a cup of tea into his hand. "Take
  that, help yourself to a muffin and go and hide behind the piano."</p>

  <p>Letitia rose from her place by the side of an extremely loquacious
  politician, to whose animated conversation she had paid no attention since
  David's entrance.</p>

  <p>"You hear my aunt's orders?" she said, nodding. "Don't try to shake hands,
  with that collection of things to carry. I am to pilot you into a corner and
  keep you quite safe until she is ready to take possession of you
  herself."</p>

  <p>David looked longingly at some French windows which led out on to a wide
  stone terrace.</p>

  <p>"Why not outside?" he suggested. "It's really quite warm to-day."</p>

  <p>"Why not, indeed?" she assented. "Come along."</p>

  <p>They passed out together, found two comfortable wicker chairs and a small
  table, on which, with a sigh of relief, David deposited his burden. Below
  them was a stretch of the Park, from which they themselves were screened by a
  row of tall trees.</p>

  <p>"Don't sit down," she begged him. "Get me another of those small muffins
  first, and a cup of tea. If any one suggests coming out here, bolt the
  windows after you."</p>

  <p>David executed his task as speedily as possible. Letitia watched him a
  little curiously as he returned.</p>

  <p>"You aren't really a bit shy, you know," she told him. "I watched you
  through the window there. How clever you were not to see that tiresome Mrs.
  Raymond!"</p>

  <p>"Why should I see her?" he asked. "She is a perfect stranger to me. She
  came up to me at a party, the other night, and asked me, as a great favour,
  to dine at her house and to tell her how to invest some money so that she
  could double it."</p>

  <p>"I know," Letitia assented, with her mouth full of muffin. "She does that
  to all the financiers and expects them to give her tips just because she has
  dark eyes and asks them to a t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te dinner. I expect
  we are all as bad, though," she went on rather gloomily, "even if we are not
  quite so blatant. What on earth have you been doing to father? He swaggers
  about as though he were already a millionaire."</p>

  <p><a id="pic3"

  </div>

  <p>David smiled a little sadly as he looked out across the tree tops.</p>

  <p>"Your father has rather a sanguine temperament," he said.</p>

  <p>"Well, don't encourage him to speculate, please," Letitia begged. "We
  couldn't afford to lose a single penny. As it is," she went on, "we are only
  able to come to Mandeleys because you've taken that ramshackle old barn close
  by and paid twice as much as it's worth. About the shooting, too! I almost
  laughed aloud when you mentioned it! Do you know, Mr. Thain, that we haven't
  reared a pheasant for years, and that we don't even feed the wild ones?"</p>

  <p>"What about the partridges, though," he reminded her, "and the hares? I
  talked to a farmer when I was down there the other day, and he complained
  bitterly that there was only one vermin-killer on the whole estate and that
  the place was swarming with rabbits. I rather enjoy rabbit shooting."</p>

  <p>"Oh, well, so long as you understand," Letitia replied, with a little
  shrug of the shoulders, "take the shoot, for goodness' sake, and pay dad as
  much as he chooses to ask for it. I've always noticed," she went on
  reflectively, "one extraordinary thing about people who haven't the faintest
  idea of business. They are always much cleverer than a real business man in
  asking ever so much more than a thing is worth. A person with a sense of
  proportion, you see, couldn't do it."</p>

  <p>"One would imagine," he complained, "that you were trying to keep me away
  from Mandeleys."</p>

  <p>"Don't, please, imagine such a thing," she begged earnestly. "If there is
  anything I hate, it's London&mdash;or rather hate the way we have to live
  here. You are entirely our salvation. If you desert us now, I shall be the
  most miserable person alive. Only, you see, I know what father is, and what
  you do you must do with your eyes open."</p>

  <p>He was silent for a moment. The echo of her words lingered in his ears. He
  moved a little uneasily in his place, more uneasily still when he found that
  she was watching him intently.</p>

  <p>"You are really a very mysterious person, Mr. Thain," she declared, with a
  note of curiosity in her tone. "I hear that you decline to be interviewed,
  and you won't even tell the newspapers whether this is your first visit to
  England or not."</p>

  <p>"I don't see what business it is of the newspapers," he rejoined. "I am
  not a person of any possible interest to any one. I have done nothing except
  make a great deal of money. That, too, was purely a matter of good fortune
  and a little foresight. In America," he went on, "one expects to meet with
  that personal curiosity. Over here, I must say that it surprises me."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you are right," she admitted, "but, you see, under the present
  conditions of living, the possession of money does give such enormous power
  to any one. Then you must remember that our press has become Americanised
  lately. However, I am not a journalist, so will you answer me one
  question?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly," he replied.</p>

  <p>"Have you ever been in England before?"</p>

  <p>"Once."</p>

  <p>"Long ago?"</p>

  <p>"A great many years ago."</p>

  <p>"I don't really know why I am curious," she went on thoughtfully, "but
  there was a time, when I saw you first&mdash;doesn't this sound hackneyed,
  but it's quite true&mdash;when I fancied that I'd seen you before. It worried
  me for days. Even now it sometimes perplexes me."</p>

  <p>He hated the lie which had risen so readily to his lips and choked it
  back.</p>

  <p>"A dear lady, a friend of the Duchess, made the same remark to me when we
  were introduced," he said. "She excused herself gracefully by saying that
  people were so much alike, nowadays."</p>

  <p>"I don't think that you are particularly like other people," she observed,
  studying him. "Would you like to hear what Ada Honeywell thinks about
  you?"</p>

  <p>"So long as it leaves me still able to hold up my head," he murmured.
  "Mrs. Honeywell struck me as being rather severe in her strictures."</p>

  <p>"It was only of your appearance she was speaking," Letitia continued. "She
  said that she could see three things in your face&mdash;a Franciscan monk, a
  head <i>ma&iuml;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i> at the most select of French
  restaurants, and the modern decadent criminal, as opposed to the Charles
  Peace type."</p>

  <p>"I am much obliged, I'm sure," he remarked, leaning back and laughing for
  once quite naturally. "My type of criminal, I presume, is one who brings art
  to his aid in working out his nefarious schemes."</p>

  <p>"Precisely," she murmured. "Like Wainwright, the poisoner, or the Borgias.
  But at any rate we agreed upon something. There is purpose in your face."</p>

  <p>"You speak as though that were unusual! I suppose we all have a set course
  in life."</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"And a good deal depends upon the goal, doesn't it?"</p>

  <p>There was a brief&mdash;to David, an enigmatic pause. Letitia's questions
  had puzzled him. She might almost have suspected his identity. They both
  listened idly for a few moments to the music of a violin, which some one was
  playing in the drawing-room.</p>

  <p>"You've asked me a great many questions," he said abruptly. "What about
  you? What is your goal?"</p>

  <p>"My dear Mr. Thain," she replied, "how can you ask! I am an impecunious
  young woman of luxurious tastes. It is my purpose to entrap somebody with a
  comfortable income into marrying me. I have been at it for several seasons,"
  she went on a little dolefully, "but so far Charles Grantham is my only
  certainty, and he wobbles sometimes&mdash;especially when he sees anything of
  Sylvia Laycey."</p>

  <p>"Sylvia Laycey," he repeated. "Is she the daughter of the present tenant
  of Broomleys?"</p>

  <p>Letitia nodded.</p>

  <p>"And a very charming girl, too," she declared. "You'll most certainly fall
  in love with her. Everybody does when she comes up to stay with me."</p>

  <p>"Falling in love isn't one of my ordinary amusements," he observed a
  little drily.</p>

  <p>"Superior person!" she mocked.</p>

  <p>The Duchess suddenly appeared upon the balcony.</p>

  <p>"Look here," she said, "there's been quite enough of this. Mr. Thain came
  especially to see me. Every one else has gone."</p>

  <p>"I wonder if that might be considered a hint," Letitia observed, glancing
  at the watch upon her wrist. "All right, aunt, I'll go. You wouldn't believe,
  Mr. Thain," she added, buttoning her gloves, "that one's relations are
  supposed to be a help to one in life?"</p>

  <p>"You're only wasting your time with Mr. Thain, dear," her aunt replied
  equably. "I've studied his character. We were eight days on that steamer, you
  know, and all the musical comedy young ladies in the world seemed to be on
  board, and I can give you my word that Mr. Thain is a woman-hater."</p>

  <p>"I am really more interested in him now than I have ever been before,"
  Letitia declared, laughing into his eyes. "My great grievance with Charlie
  Grantham is that he cannot keep away from our hated rivals in the other
  world. However, you'll talk to me again, won't you, Mr. Thain?"</p>

  <p>David was conscious of a curious fit of reserve, a sudden closing up of
  that easy intimacy into which they seemed to have drifted.</p>

  <p>"I shall always be pleased," he said stiffly.</p>

  <p>Letitia kissed her aunt and departed. The Duchess sank into her empty
  place.</p>

  <p>"I am going to be a beast," she began. "Have you been lending money to my
  brother?"</p>

  <p>"Not a sixpence," David assured her.</p>

  <p>The Duchess was evidently staggered.</p>

  <p>"You surprise mo," she confessed. "However, so much the better. It won't
  interfere with what I have to say to you. I first took you to Grosvenor
  Square, didn't I?"</p>

  <p>"You were so kind," he admitted.</p>

  <p>"Now I come to think of it," she reflected, "I remember thinking it
  strange at the time that, though I couldn't induce you to go anywhere else,
  or meet any one else, you never hesitated about making Reginald's
  acquaintance."</p>

  <p>"He was your brother, you see," David reminded her.</p>

  <p>"It didn't occur to me," she replied drily, "that that was the reason.
  However, what I want to say to you is this, in bald words&mdash;don't lend
  him money."</p>

  <p>David looked once more across the tops of the trees.</p>

  <p>"I gather that the Marquis, then, is impecunious?" he said.</p>

  <p>"Reginald hasn't a shilling," the Duchess declared earnestly. "Let me just
  tell you how they live. Letitia has two thousand a year, and so has Margaret,
  from their mother. Margaret's husband, who is a decent fellow, won't touch
  her money and makes her an allowance, so that nearly all her two thousand,
  and all of Letitia's, except the few ha'pence she spends on clothes, go to
  keeping an establishment together. Reginald has sold every scrap of land he
  could, years ago. Mandeleys is the only estate he has left, and there isn't a
  square yard of that that isn't mortgaged to the very fullest extent. It's
  always a scramble between his poor devils of lawyers and himself, whether
  there's a little margin to be got out of the rents after paying the interest.
  If there is, it goes, I believe, towards satisfying the claims of a lady down
  at Battersea."</p>

  <p>"A lady down at Battersea," David replied. "Is it&mdash;may I ask&mdash;an
  old attachment?"</p>

  <p>"A very old one indeed," the Duchess replied, "and, to tell you the truth,
  it's one of the most reputable things I know connected with Reginald. He is
  inconstant in everything else he does, and without being in any way wilfully
  dishonest, he is absolutely unreliable. But this lady at Battersea&mdash;she
  belonged to one of his tenants or something&mdash;I forget the
  story&mdash;has kept him within reasonable bounds for more years than I
  should like to say&mdash; What do you see over there, Mr. Thain?" she broke
  off suddenly, following his steadfast gaze.</p>

  <p>David dropped his eyes from the clouds. His fingers relaxed their nervous
  clutch of the sides of his chair.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," he answered. "I am interested. Please go on."</p>

  <p>"Reginald has stuck at nothing to get money," the Duchess continued. "He
  has been on the board of any company willing to pay him a few guineas for his
  name. I believe things have come to such a pitch in that direction that the
  most foolhardy investor throws the prospectus away if his name is on it. He
  has drained his relatives dry. And yet, if you can reconcile all these
  things, he is, in his way, the very soul of honour. Now, having told you
  this, you can do as you please. If you lend him money, you'll probably never
  get it back. If you've any to chuck away, I can show you a hundred deserving
  charities. Reginald without money is really a harmless and extraordinarily
  amusing person. Reginald in search of money is the most dangerous person I
  know. That is what I wanted to tell you, and if you like now you can run
  away. My hairdresser is waiting for me, and he is just a little more
  independent than my chef. Stop, though, there's one thing more."</p>

  <p>The Duchess had rung a bell with her foot, and a servant was waiting at
  the windows to show David out. The latter turned back.</p>

  <p>"You are not making a fool of yourself with Letitia, are you?"</p>

  <p>David was very white and cold for a moment. He looked his hostess in the
  face, and, as she expressed it afterwards, froze her up.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that I do not understand you, Duchess," he said.</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't be silly!" she replied. "Remember that I am your oldest friend
  in this country, and I say what I like to everybody. You avoid most women as
  you would the plague&mdash;most women except Letitia. I've warned you against
  the father. Now I am warning you against the daughter. And then you can go
  and lose your heart to one and lend a million to the other, if you want.
  Letitia, for all her apparent amiability, is the proudest girl I ever knew. I
  hope you understand me?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly!"</p>

  <p>"Letitia will marry for money, all right," her aunt continued. "She
  understands that that is her duty, and she will do it. But it will be some
  one&mdash;you will forgive me, Mr. Thain&mdash;with kindred associations,
  shall I say? Letitia, fortunately, takes after her father. She has no
  temperament, but a sense of family tradition which will give her all the
  backbone she needs."</p>

  <p>"Is there any other member of the family," David began&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Don't be a silly boy," the Duchess interrupted, "because that's what you
  are, really, in this world and amongst our stupid class of people. You are
  just as nice as can be, though. Run along, and don't forget that you are
  coming to dine on Friday. You'll meet the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and
  he's going to try and persuade you to settle down here, for the sake of your
  income tax."</p>

  <p>"Another plunderer!" David groaned. "I am beginning to feel rather like a
  lamb with an exceedingly long fleece."</p>

  <p>"You would look better with your hair cut," the Duchess remarked, as she
  waved her hand. "Try that place at the bottom of Bond Street. The Duke always
  goes there. A Mr. Saunders is his man. Better ask for him. You'll find him at
  the top end of the room."</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

  <p>There was just one drop of alloy in the perfect contentment with which the
  Marquis contemplated his new prospects, and that was contained in a telephone
  message from Mr. Wadham, Junior, which he received upon the afternoon of
  David's call upon the Duchess.</p>

  <p>"I must apologise for troubling your lordship," Mr. Wadham began. "I know
  your objection to the telephone, but in this instance it was quite impossible
  to send a message."</p>

  <p>"I accept your apology and am listening," the Marquis declared graciously.
  "Be so good as to speak quite slowly, and don't mumble."</p>

  <p>Mr. Wadham, Junior, cleared his throat before continuing. He was a little
  proud of his voice, although its rise and fall was perhaps more satisfactory
  from the point of view of a Chancery Court than from one who expected to
  gather the sense of every syllable.</p>

  <p>"I am ringing up your lordship," he continued, "concerning the large batch
  of shares in the Pluto Oil Company of Arizona, which you entrusted to us for
  safe keeping, and for deposit with the bank against the advance required last
  Monday."</p>

  <p>"I can hear you perfectly," the Marquis acknowledged suavely. "Pray
  continue."</p>

  <p>"Your lordship's bankers sent for me this morning," Mr. Wadham went on,
  "in connection with these shares. They thought it their duty to point out,
  either through us or by communication with you direct, that according to the
  advice of a most reliable broker, their commercial value is practically
  nil."</p>

  <p>"Is what?" the Marquis demanded.</p>

  <p>"Nil&mdash;nix&mdash;not worth a cent," Mr. Wadham, Junior, proclaimed
  emphatically.</p>

  <p>The Marquis, in that slang phraseology which he would have been the first
  to decry, never turned a hair. He had not the least intention, moreover, of
  permitting his interlocutor at the other end of the telephone even a
  momentary sensation of triumph.</p>

  <p>"You can present my compliments to the manager," he said, "and tell him
  that the value of the shares in question does not concern either him or his
  brokers. In any case, they could not possibly have any information concerning
  the company, as it is only just registered and has not yet commenced
  operations. You understand me, Mr. Wadham?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly, your lordship," was the smooth reply. "The fact remains,
  however, that the brokers do know something about the company and the persons
  interested in it, and that knowledge, I regret to say, is most unfavourable.
  We felt it our duty, therefore, to pass on these facts."</p>

  <p>"I am exceedingly obliged to you for your anxieties on my behalf," the
  Marquis declared. "My legal interests are, I am quite sure, safe in your
  hands. My financial affairs&mdash;my outside financial affairs, that is to
  say&mdash;I prefer to keep under my own control. I might remind you that
  these shares are supported, and came into my hands, in fact, through the
  agency of Mr. David Thain, the great financier."</p>

  <p>There was a moment's pause.</p>

  <p>"I had not forgotten the fact," Mr. Wadham admitted diffidently, "and it
  certainly seems improbable that Mr. Thain would introduce a risky investment
  to your lordship within a few weeks of his arrival in this country. At the
  same time, we feel compelled, of course, to bring to your notice the broker's
  report."</p>

  <p>"Quite so," the Marquis acquiesced. "Kindly let the people concerned know
  that I am acting in this matter upon special information. Good-day, Mr.
  Wadham. My compliments to your father."</p>

  <p>So the conversation terminated, but the Marquis for the remainder of that
  day felt as though just the shadow of a cloud rested upon his happiness.
  Twice he stared at the address of David's rooms, which occupied a prominent
  place upon his study table, but on both occasions he resisted the impulse to
  seek him out and obtain the reassurance he needed. He buried himself instead
  in a Review.</p>

  <p>Letitia came in to see him on the way back from her aunt's tea party. The
  Marquis carefully made a note of his place and laid down his periodical.</p>

  <p>"You found your aunt well, I trust, dear?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, she was all right," Letitia replied. "She had an irritating lot of
  callers there, though."</p>

  <p>Her father nodded sympathetically.</p>

  <p>"The extraordinary habit which people in our rank of life seem to have
  developed lately for making friends outside their own sphere is making
  Society very difficult," he declared. "Members of our own family are, I am
  afraid, amongst the transgressors. Whom did you meet this afternoon?"</p>

  <p>Letitia mentioned a few names listlessly.</p>

  <p>"And Mr. Thain," she concluded.</p>

  <p>Her father betrayed his interest.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Thain was there, eh? I understood that he was much averse to paying
  calls."</p>

  <p>"He looked as though he had been roped in," Letitia observed, "and aunt
  was all over herself, apologising to him for having other people there. She
  wanted to consult him, it seems, about something or other, and she turned him
  over to me until she was ready."</p>

  <p>"And you," the Marquis enquired, with questioning sympathy, "were perhaps
  bored?"</p>

  <p>"Not bored, exactly&mdash;rather irritated! I think I am like you, in some
  respects, father," Letitia went on, smoothing out her gloves. "I prefer to
  find my intimates within the circle of our own relatives and connections. A
  person like Mr. Thain in some way disturbs me."</p>

  <p>"That," the Marquis regretted, "is unfortunate, as he is likely to be our
  neighbour at Mandeleys."</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it is of no consequence," she replied. "I shall never feel the
  slightest compunction in anything I might do or say to him. If he pays more
  for Broomleys than it is worth, he has the advantage of our countenance,
  which I imagine, to a person in his position, makes the bargain equal. Mr.
  Thain does not seem to me to be one of those men who would part with anything
  unless he got some return."</p>

  <p>"Money, nowadays," the Marquis reflected, pressing the tips of his fingers
  together, "is a marvellously revitalising influence. People whose social
  position is almost, if not quite equal to our own, have even taken it into
  the family through marriage."</p>

  <p>Letitia's very charming mouth twitched. Her lips parted, and she laughed
  softly. Nothing amused her more than this extraordinary blindness of her
  father to actual facts&mdash;such, for instance, as the Lees' woollen
  mills!</p>

  <p>"I do hope," she remarked, "that you are not thinking of offering me up,
  dad, on the altar of the God of Dollars?"</p>

  <p>"My dear child," the Marquis protested, "I can truthfully and proudly say
  that I am acquainted with no young woman of your position in connection with
  whom such a suggestion would be more sacrilegious. I have sometimes hoped,"
  he went on, "that matters were already on the eve of settlement in another
  direction."</p>

  <p>"I don't know, I'm sure," Letitia answered thoughtfully. "I sometimes
  think that I have a great many more feelings, dad, than the sole remaining
  daughter of the Right Honourable Reginald Thursford, Marquis of Mandeleys,
  ought to possess. The fact is, there are times when I can't stand Charlie
  anywhere near me, and as to discussing any subject of reasonable interest,
  well, he can only see anything from his own point of view, and that is always
  wrong."</p>

  <p>"You and he, then," the Marquis observed, "appear to share&mdash;or rather
  to possess every essential for domestic happiness. The constant propinquity
  in which married people of the middle and lower classes are forced to live is
  no doubt responsible, in many cases, for the early termination of their
  domestic happiness."</p>

  <p>"I always thought the middle classes were horribly virtuous," Letitia
  yawned. "However!&mdash;Thursday night, dad. You are dining out, aren't
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Thursday night," the Marquis repeated, telling for the hundredth time,
  with bland ease, the falsehood which had almost ceased to have even the
  intention to deceive. "Yes, I dine at my club to-night, dear."</p>

  <p>She bent over and kissed his forehead.</p>

  <p>"Remember, my dear," he enjoined, "that I do not wish you to develop any
  feelings of positive dislike towards Mr. Thain. Such people have their uses
  in the world. We must not forget that."</p>

  <p>Letitia laughed at him understandingly, but she closed the door in
  silence.</p>

        id="ch14"></a>

  <h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

  <p>Marcia, more especially perhaps during these later days, felt her sense of
  humour gently excited every time she crossed the threshold of Trewly's
  Restaurant. The programme which followed was always the same. The Marquis
  rose from a cushioned seat in the small entrance lounge to greet her, very
  distinguished looking in his plain dinner clothes, his black stock, vainly
  imitated by the younger generation, his horn-rimmed eyeglass, his
  cambric-fronted shirt with the black pearls, which had been the gift of the
  Regent to his great-grandfather. The head waiter, and generally the manager,
  hovered in the background while their greetings were exchanged and Marcia's
  coat delivered to the care of an attendant. Then they were shown with much
  ceremony to the same table which they had occupied on these weekly
  celebrations for many years. It was in a corner of the room, a corner which
  formed a slight recess, and special flowers, the gift of the management, were
  invariably in evidence. The rose-shaded lamp, with its long, silken hangings,
  was arranged at precisely the right angle. The Marquis asked his usual
  question and waved away the menu.</p>

  <p>"What you choose to offer us, Monsieur Herbrand," he would say, in his
  old-world but perfect French. "If Madame has any fancy, we will send you a
  message."</p>

  <p>So the meal commenced. Trewly's was a restaurant with a past. In the days
  of the Marquis's youth, when such things were studied more carefully than
  now, it was the one first-class restaurant in London to which the gilded
  youth of the aristocracy, and perhaps their sires, might indulge in the
  indiscretion of entertaining a young lady from the Italian chorus without
  fear of meeting staider relatives. The world of bohemian fashion had changed
  its laws since those days, and Trewly's had been left, high and dry, save for
  a small clientele who remembered its former glories and esteemed its cellar
  and cuisine. It belonged to the world which the Marquis knew, the world whose
  maxims he still recognised. After all these years, he would still have
  thought himself committing a breach of social etiquette if he had invited
  Marcia to lunch with him at the Ritz or the Carlton.</p>

  <p>They drank claret, decanted with zealous care and served by a
  black-aproned cellarman, who waited anxiously by until the Marquis had
  gravely sipped his first glassful and approved. Their dinner to-day was very
  much what it had been a dozen years ago&mdash;the French-fed chicken, the
  artichokes, and strawberries served with liqueurs remained, whatever the
  season. And their conversations. Marcia leaned back in her chair for a
  moment, and again the corners of her lips twitched as she remembered.
  Faithfully, year after year, she could trace those conversations&mdash;the
  courtly, old-fashioned criticism of the events of the week, criticism from
  the one infallible standard, the standard of the immutable Whiggism upon
  which the constitution itself rested; conversation with passing references to
  any new event in art, and, until lately, the stage. To-night Marcia found
  herself tracing the gradual birth of her stimulating rebellion. She
  remembered how, years ago, she had sat in that same seat and listened as one
  might listen to the words of a god. And then came the faint revolt, the
  development of her intellect, the necessity for giving tongue to those more
  expansive and more subtle views of life which became her heritage. To do him
  justice, the Marquis encouraged her. He was as good a judge of wit and spirit
  as he was of claret. If Marcia had expressed a single sentence awkwardly, if
  her grammar had ever been at fault, her taste to be questioned, he would have
  relapsed into the stiffness of his ordinary manner, and she would have felt
  herself tongue-tied. But, curious though it seemed to her when she looked
  back, she was forced to realise that it was he who had always encouraged the
  birth of her new thoughts, her new ideals, her new outlook upon life, her own
  drastic and sometimes unanswerable criticisms of that state of life in which
  he lived. She represented modernity, seeking for expression in the culture of
  the moment. He, remaining of the ancient world, yet found himself
  rejuvenated, mentally refreshed, week by week, preserved from that condition
  of obstinate ossification into which he would otherwise have fallen, by this
  brilliant and unusual companionship. In all the many years of their intimacy
  he had felt no doubts concerning her. He was possessed of a self-confidence
  wholly removed from conceit, which had spared for him the knowledge of even a
  moment's jealousy. In her company he had felt the coming and, as he now
  realised, the passing of middle age. It was only within these last few hours
  that certain formless apprehensions had presented themselves to him.</p>

  <p>"You drink your wine slowly to-night," she observed. "I was just thinking
  how delicious it was."</p>

  <p>He touched the long forefinger of his left hand, just a little
  swollen.</p>

  <p>"A touch of gout," he said, "come to remind me, I suppose, that however
  much we set our faces against it, change does exist. You are the only person,
  Marcia, who seems to defy it."</p>

  <p>She laughed at him, but not with entire naturalness. He found himself
  studying her, during the next few moments. Just as he was a celebrated
  connoisseur of <i>objets d'arts</i>, a valued visitor to Christie's, although
  his purchases were small, so he was, in his way, an excellent judge of the
  beautiful in living things. He realised, as he studied her, that Marcia had
  only more fully developed the charm which had first attracted him. Her figure
  was a little rounder but it had lost none of its perfections. Her neck and
  throat were just as beautiful, and the success of her work, and her greater
  knowledge of life, had brought with them an assured and dignified bearing.
  There was not a vestige of grey in her soft brown hair, not a line in her
  face, nor any sign of the dentist's handiwork in her strong, white teeth.
  Only&mdash;was it his fancy, he wondered, or was there something missing from
  the way she looked at him?&mdash;a half shy, half baffled appeal for
  affection which had so often shone out upon him during these evenings, a
  wholly personal, wholly human note, the unspoken message of a woman to her
  lover. He asked himself whether that had gone, and, if it had, whether the
  companionship which remained sufficed.</p>

  <p>"So the journey down to Mandeleys has not materialised yet?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"To tell you the truth," she told him, "I rather shrank from it. I could
  not seem to bring it into perspective&mdash;you know what I mean. How am I to
  go to him? I don't suppose he has changed. He is still splendidly faithful to
  the ideas of his earlier days. I do not suppose he has moved a step out of
  his groove. He is looking at the same things in the same way. Am I to go to
  him as a Magdalen, as a penitent? Honestly, Reginald, I couldn't play the
  part."</p>

  <p>Their eyes met, and they both smiled.</p>

  <p>"It is very difficult," he admitted, "to discuss or to hold in common a
  matter of importance with a person of another world. Why do you go?"</p>

  <p>"Because," she replied, "he is, after all, my father; because I know that
  the pain and rage which he felt when he left England are there to-day, and I
  would like so much to make him see that they have all been wasted. I want him
  to realise that my life has been made, not spoilt."</p>

  <p>"I should find out indirectly, if I were you, how he is feeling," the
  Marquis advised. "I rather agree with you that you will find him unchanged.
  His fierce opposition to my reasonable legal movements against him give one
  that impression."</p>

  <p>"I shall probably be sorry I went," she admitted, "but it seems to me that
  it is one of those things which must be done. Let us talk of something else.
  Tell me how you have spent the week?"</p>

  <p>"For one thing, I have improved my acquaintance with the American, David
  Thain, of whom I have already spoken to you," he told her.</p>

  <p>"And your great financial scheme?"</p>

  <p>"It promises well. Of course, if it is entirely successful, it will be
  like starting life all over again."</p>

  <p>"There is a certain amount of risk, I suppose?" she asked, a little
  anxiously.</p>

  <p>The Marquis waved his hand.</p>

  <p>"In this affair quite negligible," he declared.</p>

  <p>"It would make you very happy, of course, to free the estates," she
  ruminated.</p>

  <p>The Marquis for a moment revealed a side of himself which always made
  Marcia feel almost maternal towards him.</p>

  <p>"It would give me very great pleasure, also," he confessed, "to point out
  to my solicitors&mdash;to Mr. Wadham, Junior, especially&mdash;that the task
  which they have left unaccomplished for some twenty-five years I have myself
  undertaken successfully."</p>

  <p>"This Mr. Thain must be rather interesting," Marcia said musingly. "Could
  you describe him?"</p>

  <p>It was at that precise moment that the Marquis raised his head and
  discovered that David Thain was being shown by an obsequious <i>ma&icirc;tre
  d'h&ocirc;tel</i> to the table adjoining their own.</p>

  <p>In the case of almost any other of his acquaintances, the Marquis's course
  of action would have been entirely simple. David, however, complicated
  things. With the na&iuml;ve courtesy of his American bringing up, he no
  sooner recognised the Marquis than he approached the table and offered his
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Good evening, Marquis," he said.</p>

  <p>The Marquis shook hands. Some banalities passed between the two men. Then,
  as though for the first time, David was suddenly and vividly aware of
  Marcia's presence. Some instinct told him who she was, and for a moment he
  forgot himself. He looked at her steadily, curiously, striving to remember,
  and Marcia returned his gaze with a strange absorption which at first she
  failed to understand. This slim, nervous-looking man, with the earnest eyes
  and the slight stoop of the head, was bringing back to her some memory. From
  the first stage of the struggle her common sense was worsted. She was looking
  back down the avenues of her memory. Surely somewhere in that shadowland she
  had known some one with eyes like these!&mdash;there must be something to
  explain this queer sense of excitement. And then the Marquis, who had been
  deliberating, spoke the words which brought her to herself.</p>

  <p>"Marcia, let me present to you Mr. David Thain, of whom we were speaking a
  few minutes ago. Mr. Thain, this is Miss Marcia Hannaway, whose very clever
  novel you may have read."</p>

  <p>David's eyes were still eagerly fixed upon her face, but the introduction
  had brought Marcia back to the earth. There could be no connection between
  those half-formed memories and the American millionaire whose name was almost
  a household word!</p>

  <p>"I am very pleased to meet you, Miss Hannaway," David said. "I was just
  telling the Marquis that I was surprised to find any one here whom I knew. I
  asked a friend to tell me of a restaurant near my rooms where I should meet
  no one, and he sent me here."</p>

  <p>"Why such misanthropy?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"It is my own bad manners," he explained. "I accepted an invitation for
  this evening, and found at the last moment so much work that I was obliged to
  send an excuse."</p>

  <p>"You carry your work about with you, then?"</p>

  <p>"Not always, I hope," he replied, "only I am just now clearing out a great
  many of my interests in America, and that alone is sufficient to keep one
  busy."</p>

  <p>He passed on with a little bow, and took his place at the table which the
  <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i> had indicated. The Marquis, to whom his
  coming had been without any real significance, continued his conversation
  with Marcia until he found to his surprise that she was giving him less than
  her whole attention.</p>

  <p>"What do you think of our hero of finance?" he enquired, a little
  coldly.</p>

  <p>"He seems very much as you described him," Marcia answered. "To tell you
  the truth, his sudden appearance just as we were talking about him rather
  took my breath away."</p>

  <p>"It was a coincidence, without doubt," the Marquis acknowledged.</p>

  <p>Her eyes wandered towards the man who had given his brief order for
  dinner, and whose whole attention now seemed absorbed by the newspaper which
  he was reading.</p>

  <p>"It is Mr. Thain, is it not, who introduced to you this wonderful
  speculation?" she asked, a little abruptly.</p>

  <p>"That is so," the Marquis admitted. "I have always myself, however, been
  favourably disposed towards oil."</p>

  <p>Marcia suddenly withdrew her glance, laughed softly to herself and sipped
  her wine.</p>

  <p>"I was indulging in a ridiculous train of thought," she confessed. "Mr.
  Thain looks very clever, even if he is not exactly one's idea of an American
  financier. I expect the poor man does get hunted about. A millionaire,
  especially from foreign parts, has become a sort of Monte Cristo,
  nowadays."</p>

  <p>The subject of David Thain dropped. The Marquis, as their coffee was
  brought, began to wonder dimly whether it was possible that the thread of
  their conversation was a little more difficult to hold together than in the
  past; whether that bridge between their interests and daily life became a
  little more difficult to traverse as the years passed. He fell into a
  momentary fit of silence. Marcia leaned towards him.</p>

  <p>"Reginald," she said, "do you know, there was something I wanted to ask
  you this evening. Shall I ask it now?"</p>

  <p>"If you will, dear."</p>

  <p>She paused for a moment. The matter had seemed so easy and reasonable when
  she had revolved it in her mind, yet at this moment of broaching it, she
  realised, not for the first time, how different he was from other men; how
  difficult a nameless something about his environment made certain
  discussions. Nevertheless, she commenced her task.</p>

  <p>"Reginald," she began, "do you realise that during the whole of my life I
  have never dined alone with any other man but you?"</p>

  <p>"Nor I, since you came, with any other woman," he rejoined calmly. "You
  have some proposition to make?"</p>

  <p>She was surprised to find that he had penetrated her thoughts.</p>

  <p>"Don't you think, perhaps," she continued, "that we are a little too
  self-enclosing? Thanks to you, as I always remember, dear, the world has
  grown a larger place for me, year by year. At first I really tried to avoid
  friendships. I was perfectly satisfied. I did not need them. But my work,
  somehow, has made things different. It has brought me amongst a class of
  people who look upon freedom of intercourse between the sexes as a part of
  their everyday life. I found a grey hair in my head only the night before
  last, and do you know how it came? Just by refusing invitations from
  perfectly harmless people."</p>

  <p>"I have never placed any restrictions upon your life," her companion
  reminded her.</p>

  <p>"I know it," she admitted, "but, you see, the principal things between us
  have always been unspoken. I knew just how you felt about it. What I want to
  know is, now that the times have changed around you as well as around me,
  whether you would feel just the same if I, to take an example, were to lunch
  or dine with Mr. Borden, now and then, or with Morris Hyde, the explorer. I
  met him at an Authors' Club <i>conversazione</i> and he was immensely
  interesting. It struck me then that perhaps I was interpreting your wishes a
  little too literally."</p>

  <p>The Marquis selected a cigarette from his battered gold case with its tiny
  coronet, tapped it upon the table and lit it. Marcia was already smoking.</p>

  <p>"I fear that I am very old-fashioned in my notions, Marcia," he confessed.
  "I should find it very difficult to adapt myself to the perfectly harmless, I
  am sure, lack of restraint which, as you say, has opened the doors to a much
  closer friendship between men and women. The place which you have held in my
  life has grown rather than lessened with the years. It is only natural,
  however, that the opposite should be the case with you. I should like to
  consider what you have said, Marcia."</p>

  <p>"You have meant so much to me," she continued, "you have been so much. In
  our earlier days, too, especially during that year when we travelled, you
  were such a wonderful mentor. It was your fine taste, Reginald, which enabled
  me to make the best of those months in Florence and Rome. You knew the best,
  and you showed it to me. You never tried to understand why it was the best,
  but you never made a mistake."</p>

  <p>"Those things are matters of inheritance," he replied, "and cultivation.
  It was a great joy to me, Marcia, to give you the keys."</p>

  <p>"Yes," she repeated, "that is what you did, Reginald&mdash;you gave me the
  keys, and I opened the doors."</p>

  <p>"And now," he went on, "you have pushed your way further, much further
  into the world where men and women think, than I could or should care to
  follow you. Is it likely to separate us?"</p>

  <p>She saw him suddenly through a little mist of tears.</p>

  <p>"No!" she exclaimed, "it must not! It shall not!"</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless," he persisted, "the thought is in your mind. I cannot alter
  my life, Marcia. I live to a certain extent by tradition, and by habits which
  have become too strong to break. There is a great difference in our years and
  in our outlook upon life. There is much before you, flowers which you may
  pick and heights which you may climb, which can have no message for me."</p>

  <p>"Nothing," Marcia declared fervently, "shall disturb our&mdash;our
  friendship."</p>

  <p>"That does not rest with you, dear, but rather with Fate," he replied.
  "You might control your actions, and I know that you would, but your will,
  your desires, your temperament, may still lead you in opposite directions. I
  have been your lover too long to slip easily into the place of your guardian.
  Hold out your hand, if you will, now, and bid me farewell. Try the other
  things, and, if they fail you, send for me."</p>

  <p>"I shall do nothing of the sort," she objected. "We are both of us much
  too serious. The only question we are considering is whether you would object
  to my dining with Mr. Borden and lunching with Mr. Hyde?"</p>

  <p>"It would give you an opportunity," he remarked, with a rather grim smile,
  "of seeing the inside of some other restaurant."</p>

  <p>"How understanding you are!" she exclaimed. "Do you know, although I love
  our dinners here, I sometimes feel as though this room were a little cage, a
  little corner of the world across the threshold of which you had drawn a
  chalk line, so that no one of your world or mine might enter. The coming of
  Mr. Thain was almost like an earthquake."</p>

  <p>With every moment it seemed to him that he understood her a little more,
  and with every moment the pain of it all increased.</p>

  <p>"My dear Marcia," he said, "you have spoken the word. More than once
  lately I have fancied that I noticed indications of this desire on your part.
  I am glad, therefore, that you have spoken. Dine with your publisher, by all
  means, and lunch with Mr. Hyde. Take to yourself that greater measure of
  liberty which it is only too natural that you should covet. We will look upon
  it as a brief vacation, which certainly, after all these years, you have
  earned. When you have made up your mind, write to me. I shall await your
  letter with interest."</p>

  <p>"But you mean that you are not coming down to see me before then?" she
  asked, a little tremulously.</p>

  <p>"I think it would be better not," he decided. "I have kept you to myself
  very stringently, Marcia. You see, I recognise this, and I set you free for a
  time."</p>

  <p>He paid the bill, and they left the room together.</p>

  <p>"You are coming home?" she whispered, as they passed down the
  vestibule.</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Not to-night, if you will excuse me, Marcia," he said. "The car is here.
  I will take a cab myself. There is a meeting of the committee at my
  club."</p>

  <p>They were on the pavement. She gripped his hand.</p>

  <p>"Do come," she begged.</p>

  <p>He handed her in with a smile.</p>

  <p>"You will go down to Battersea, James," he told the chauffeur, "and fetch
  me afterwards from the club."</p>

  <p>A queer feeling caught at her heart as the car glided off and left him
  standing there, bareheaded. It was the first time&mdash;she felt something
  like the snap of a chain in her heart&mdash;the first time in all these
  years! Yet she never for a moment deceived herself. The tears which stood in
  her eyes, the pain in her heart, were for him.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

  <p>The Duchess, a few mornings later, leaned back in her car and watched the
  perilous progress of her footman, dodging in and out of the traffic in the
  widest part of Piccadilly. He returned presently in safety, escorting the
  object of his quest. The Duchess pointed to the seat by her side.</p>

  <p>"Can I take you or drop you anywhere?" she asked. "Please don't look as
  though you had been taken into custody. I saw you in the distance, walking
  aimlessly along, and I really wanted to talk to you."</p>

  <p>David for a moment indulged in the remains of what was almost a boyish
  resentment.</p>

  <p>"I have to go to the Savoy," he explained, "and I was rather intending to
  walk across St. James's Park."</p>

  <p>"You can walk after your lunch," she insisted. "If you walk before, it
  gives you too much of an appetite,&mdash;afterwards, it helps your digestion,
  so get in with me, and I will drive you to the Savoy."</p>

  <p>He took his place by her side with a distinct air of resignation. The
  Duchess laughed at him.</p>

  <p>"You are a very silly person to dislike other people so," she admonished.
  "If you begin to give way to misanthropy at your time of life, you will be a
  withered up old stick whom no one will want to be decent to, except to get
  money out of, before you're fifty. Don't you know that the society of human
  beings is good for you?"</p>

  <p>"There isn't a medicine in the world one can't take too much of," David
  ventured, smiling in spite of himself.</p>

  <p>"To the Savoy, John," his mistress directed. "Tell Miles to drive slowly.
  To abandon abstruse discussions," she continued, leaning back, "have you
  regarded my warning?"</p>

  <p>"Which one?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"I mean with reference to my brother. I happen to have come across him
  once or twice, during the last few days. On Wednesday he was in the most
  buoyant spirits&mdash;for him. He had the air of a man who has accomplished
  some great feat. If you only knew how amusing Reginald is at such times! His
  manner isn't in the least different, but you know perfectly well that he is
  thinking himself one of the most brilliant creatures ever born. There is a
  note of the finest and most delicate condescension in the way he speaks. I am
  perfectly certain that if he had happened to come across the Chancellor of
  the Exchequer on Wednesday, he would have discussed finance with him in a
  patronising fashion, and probably offered him a few hints as to how to reduce
  the National Debt."</p>

  <p>"On Wednesday this was," David murmured.</p>

  <p>"And on Friday," the Duchess continued, "he was a different man. He
  carried himself exactly as usual, but his footsteps were falling like lead.
  He looked over the eyes of every one, and there was that queer, grey look in
  his face which helps one to remember that, notwithstanding his figure, he is
  nearly sixty years old. What have you been doing to him, Mr. Thain?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing that would account for his latter state," David assured her.</p>

  <p>"When did you see him last?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"On Thursday."</p>

  <p>"Where?"</p>

  <p>David hesitated.</p>

  <p>"At Trewly's Restaurant."</p>

  <p>"He was lunching or dining with some one?"</p>

  <p>"Dining."</p>

  <p>The Duchess nodded.</p>

  <p>"Of course! With a lady, wasn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Is this a fair cross-examination?" David protested.</p>

  <p>"My dear Mr. Thain, don't be absurd," his companion admonished. "Every one
  in London and out of it has known of my brother's friendship with Marcia
  Hannaway for years. As a matter of fact, we all approve of it immensely. The
  young woman, although she must be getting on now, is a very clever writer,
  and I think that the influence she has exercised upon Reginald, throughout
  his life, has been an excellent one. So that was Thursday night, eh?"</p>

  <p>David assented. He was looking out of the window of the car, as though
  interested in the passing throngs.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you something," the Duchess continued. "You have heard, I
  dare say, of the lawsuits down at Mandeleys, and of that keeper's cottage
  within a hundred yards from the lawn, and of the old man Vont, who has come
  back just as bitter as ever? That girl is his daughter."</p>

  <p>"The Marquis seems to have displayed the most extraordinary fidelity,"
  David remarked.</p>

  <p>"My dear Mr. Thain," was the emphatic reply, "they have been the making of
  one another's lives. It is the sort of thing one reads more of in French
  memoirs than meets with in actual life, but I can assure you that Reginald
  would be absolutely miserable without her, and she&mdash;well, see what she
  has become through his influence and companionship. Yet they tell me that
  that old man has come back to his ridiculous cottage, and sits there in the
  front garden, reading the Bible and blasting the very gooseberry bushes with
  his curses against Reginald. Most uncomfortable it will be, I should think,
  when you all get down there."</p>

  <p>"Nothing that you have said alters the fact," David reminded her, "that
  Vont's daughter has been all her life, and is to-day, in an invidious
  situation with regard to your brother."</p>

  <p>The Duchess's eyebrows were slightly raised.</p>

  <p>"And why not?" she asked, in genuine surprise. "Of course, I don't claim
  to be so absolutely feudal in my ideas as Reginald, but I still cannot find
  the slightest disadvantage which has accrued to the young woman from her
  position."</p>

  <p>"I have been brought up myself in a different school," David said quietly,
  "in the school Richard Vont was brought up in. I see no difference
  fundamentally between a Marquis and a gamekeeper, and to me the womenkind of
  the gamekeeper should be as sacred to the Marquis as the womenkind of the
  Marquis to the gamekeeper."</p>

  <p>The Duchess laughed good-humouredly.</p>

  <p>"I have always insisted," she declared, "that America is the most backward
  country in the world. So many of you come to Europe now, though, that one
  would have thought you would have attained to a more correct perspective of
  life. But you are certainly much more amusing as you are. No, be quiet,
  please," she went on. "I didn't call for you to enter into general
  discussions. I just wanted to know about Reginald. Of course, you have
  discovered already that I am ridiculously fond of him, and I am trying to
  find out what is depressing him so much. Do you know what I am most afraid
  of?"</p>

  <p>"I have no idea," David confessed. "The workings of your mind seem to lead
  you to such unexpected conclusions."</p>

  <p>"Don't be peevish," she replied. "What I am really more afraid of than
  anything is that Marcia Hannaway will leave him."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>The Duchess shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"She is twenty years younger than Reginald, and she has made for herself
  an entirely new place in life. That is the wonderful goal a woman reaches who
  has brains and is enabled to put them to some practical use. She has a circle
  of friends and admirers and sympathisers, already made. Now Reginald is a
  dear, but his outlook upon life is almost whimsical, and I have always
  wondered whether he would be able to hold a woman like this to the end. The
  only thing is," she concluded ruminatively, "that the affair has been going
  on for so long, and is so well known, that it would be positively indecent of
  her to break it off. Don't you think so, Mr. Thain?"</p>

  <p>David looked at the Duchess and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Honestly," he admitted, "I can't give an opinion. I thought I understood
  something of human nature before I came into touch with you and those few
  members of your aristocracy whom I have met through you. But frankly, to use
  a homely metaphor, you take the wind out of my sails. I don't know where I am
  when you lay down the law. There is something wrong between us fundamentally.
  I was brought up the same way Vont was brought up. Things were right or
  wrong, moral or immoral. You people seem to have made laws of your own."</p>

  <p>"It's time some one revised the old ones," his companion laughed.
  "However, I can see that you can be no help to me about Reginald, and here we
  are at the Savoy. By-the-by, I've never seen you except with men. Have you no
  women friends? Are none of those charming little musical comedy ladies I see
  through the windows there expecting you as their host?"</p>

  <p>"They look very attractive," David admitted, smiling back at his
  companion, "but I am, in reality, lunching alone. I came here because I know
  my stockbroker lunches every day in the grillroom, and I want to see
  him."</p>

  <p>"How pathetic!" she sighed. "I really believe that I have a duty in
  connection with you."</p>

  <p>"At any rate," he promised, as he held out his hand, "there is a man here
  who will serve us some American lobster which is very nearly the real
  thing."</p>

  <p>"Don't make me feel too gluttonous," she begged, as she stepped out. "I
  really am not in the habit of inviting myself to luncheon like this, but the
  fact of it is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She hesitated. He passed behind her into the little vestibule.</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I rather like you, Mr. David Thain," she whispered. "You won't be
  vain about it, will you, but all the financiers I have ever met have been so
  extraordinarily full of their money and how they made it. You are different,
  aren't you?"</p>

  <p>"I am content if you find me so," he answered, with rare gallantry.</p>

  <p>David ordered a thoroughly American luncheon, of which his guest heartily
  approved.</p>

  <p>"If you Americans," she observed, "only knew how to live as well as you
  know how to eat, what a nation you would be!"</p>

  <p>"We fancy that we have some ideas that way, also," he told her. "Wherein
  do we fail most, from your English point of view?"</p>

  <p>"In matters of sex," the Duchess replied coolly. "You know so much more
  about lobster Newburg than you do about women. I suppose it is all this
  strenuous money-getting that is responsible for your ignorance. No one over
  here, you see, tries for anything very much."</p>

  <p>"You certainly all live in a more enervating atmosphere," David
  admitted.</p>

  <p>"Tell me about your younger days?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing to tell in the least interesting," he assured her. "My
  people were poor. I was sent to Harvard with great difficulty by a relative
  who kept a boot store. I became a clerk in a railway office, took a fancy to
  the work and planned out some schemes&mdash;which came off."</p>

  <p>"How much money have you, in plain English?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"About four millions," he answered.</p>

  <p>"And what are you going to do with it?"</p>

  <p>"Buy an estate, for one thing," he replied. "Fortunately, I am very fond
  of shooting and riding, so I suppose I shall amuse myself."</p>

  <p>"Are those your only resources?" she enquired, with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>"I may marry."</p>

  <p>"Come, this gets more interesting! Any lady in your mind yet?"</p>

  <p>"None whatever," he assured her, with almost exaggerated firmness.</p>

  <p>"You'd better give yourself a few years first and then let me choose for
  you," she suggested. "I know just the type&mdash;unless you change."</p>

  <p>"And why should I change?"</p>

  <p>"Because," she said, eying him penetratively, "there is at present
  something bottled up in you. I do not know what it is, and if I asked you
  wouldn't tell me, but you're not quite your natural self, whatever that may
  be. Is it, I wonder, the result of that twenty years' struggle of yours?
  Perhaps you have really lost the capacity for generous life, Mr. Thain."</p>

  <p>"You are a very observant person."</p>

  <p>"Trust me, then, and tell me your secret sorrow?" she suggested. "I could
  be a very good friend, Mr. Thain, if friends amuse you."</p>

  <p>"I have lived under a shadow," he confessed. "I am sorry, but I cannot
  tell you much about it. But in a sense you are right. Life for me will begin
  after the accomplishment of a certain purpose."</p>

  <p>"You have a rival to ruin, eh?"</p>

  <p>"No, it isn't that," he assured her. "It happens to be something of which
  I could not give you even the smallest hint."</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't see how you are going to get on with it down at Broomleys,"
  she observed. "What a horrid person you are to go there at all! You might as
  well bury yourself. You have the wealth of a Monte Cristo and you take a
  furnished villa&mdash;for that's all it is! Perhaps you are waiting till the
  mortgages fall in, to buy Mandeleys? Or did my warning come too late and is
  Letitia the attraction?"</p>

  <p>He was conscious of her close observation, but he gave no sign.</p>

  <p>"I have seen nothing of Lady Letitia," he said, "but even if she were
  content to accept my four millions as a compensation for my other
  disadvantages, it would make no difference."</p>

  <p>"Any entanglements on the other side?" she asked airily.</p>

  <p>"None!"</p>

  <p>The Duchess finished her lobster and leaned back in her chair. Through her
  tiny platinum lorgnette she looked around the room for several moments. Then
  a little abruptly she turned again to him.</p>

  <p>"Really," she said, "people are doing such mad things, now-a-days, that I
  am not at all sure that I am right in putting you off Letitia. It would be
  frightfully useful to have four millions in the family. And yet, do you
  know," she went on, "it's queer, isn't it, but I don't want you to marry my
  niece."</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"How crude!" she sighed. "I really shall have to take a lot of trouble
  with you, Mr. David Thain. However, if you persist&mdash;because Letitia is
  my niece."</p>

  <p>"And you don't like me well enough," he asked, "to accept me as a husband
  for your niece?"</p>

  <p>She laughed at him very quietly.</p>

  <p>"Are you very ingenuous," she demanded, "or just a little subtle? Hadn't
  it occurred to you, for instance, that I might prefer to keep you to
  myself?"</p>

  <p>"You must forgive me if I seem stupid," he begged, "or unresponsive. I
  don't wish to be either. I can understand that in America I might be a person
  of some interest. Over here&mdash;well, the whole thing is different, isn't
  it? Apart from my money, I know and realise how ignorant I am of your ways,
  of the things to do here and how to do them. I feel utterly at a disadvantage
  with every one, unless they happen to want my money."</p>

  <p>"You are too modest, Mr. Thain," she declared, leaning a little towards
  him and dropping her voice. "I will tell you one reason why you interest me.
  It is because I am quite certain that there is something in your life, some
  purpose or some secret, which you have not confided to any living person in
  this country. I want to know what it is. It isn't exactly vulgar
  inquisitiveness, believe me. I am perfectly certain that there is something
  more of you than you show to people generally."</p>

  <p>David was conscious of an odd sense of relief. After all, the woman was
  only curious&mdash;and it was most improbable that her curiosity would lead
  her in the right direction.</p>

  <p>"You are very discerning, Duchess," he said. "Unfortunately, I have no
  confidence to offer you. The one secret in my life is some one else's and not
  my own."</p>

  <p>"And you never betray a confidence?" she asked, looking at him
  steadfastly. "You could be trusted?"</p>

  <p>"I hope so," he assured her.</p>

  <p>Their lunch passed on to its final stages. The Duchess smoked a Russian
  cigarette with her coffee, and it seemed to him that imperceptibly she had
  moved a little nearer to him. Her elbows were upon the table and her hands
  clasped. She seemed for a moment to study one or two quaint rings upon her
  fingers.</p>

  <p>"A few more questions, and I shall feel that we know one another," she
  said. "Just why have you left America and this wonderful pursuit of
  wealth?"</p>

  <p>"Because there were no more railways in which I was interested," he
  answered, "nor any particular speculation or enterprise that appealed to me.
  I have more money than I can ever spend, and I know very well that if I
  remained in America I should have no peace. I should be a target for years
  for every man who has land to sell near railways, or shares to sell, or an
  invention to perfect. As soon as I decided to wind up, I decided also that it
  was necessary for me to clear right away. Apart from that, England and
  English life attracts me."</p>

  <p>"And this purpose?" she enquired. "This secret&mdash;which is somebody
  else's secret?"</p>

  <p>"Such as it is," he replied, "it belongs to this country."</p>

  <p>"How old are you?" she asked suddenly.</p>

  <p>"I am thirty-seven," he told her.</p>

  <p>She sighed. Her slightly tired blue eyes seemed to be looking through the
  little cloud of cigarette smoke to the confines of the room.</p>

  <p>"A magnificent age for a man," she murmured, "but a little ghastly for a
  woman. I was thirty-nine last birthday. Never mind, one has the present. So
  here are you, in the prime of life, with an immense fortune and no
  responsibilities. If Disraeli had been alive, he would have written a novel
  about you. There is so much which you could do, so much in which you could
  fail. Will you become just a man about town here, make friends partly in
  Bohemia and partly amongst some of us, endow a theatre and marry the first
  chorus girl who is too clever for you? Or&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am more interested in the 'or,'" he declared rashly.</p>

  <p>She turned her eyes slightly without moving her head, and knocked the ash
  from her cigarette into her plate.</p>

  <p>"Let us go," she said, a little abruptly. "I am tired of talking here. If
  you really wish to know, you can accept the invitation which I shall send you
  presently, and come to Scotland."</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

  <p>Letitia and her escort pulled up their horses at the top of Rotten Row.
  Letitia was a little out of breath, but her colour was delightful, and the
  slight disarrangement of her tightly coiled brown hair most becoming.</p>

  <p>"It was dear of you, Charlie, to think of lending me a hack," she
  declared. "I haven't enjoyed a gallop so much for ages. When we get down to
  Mandeleys I am going to raid Bailey's stables. He always has some young
  horses."</p>

  <p>"Want schooling a bit before they're fit to ride," Grantham observed.</p>

  <p>"If I had been born in another walk of life," Letitia said, "I am sure
  horse-breaking would have been my profession. You haven't been in to see us
  for ages, Charles."</p>

  <p>"You weren't particularly gracious the last time I did come," he reminded
  her gloomily.</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly," she laughed. "You must have come on an irritating
  afternoon. I get into such a terrible tangle sometimes with my housekeeping
  accounts up here. You know how impossible dad is with money matters, and he
  leaves everything to me."</p>

  <p>The young man cleared his throat.</p>

  <p>"I think you've borne the burdens of the family long enough," he remarked.
  "I wish you'd try mine."</p>

  <p>"You do choose the most original forms of proposal," Letitia acknowledged
  frankly. "As a matter of fact, I have had enough of keeping accounts. I have
  almost made up my mind that when I do marry, if I ever do, I will marry some
  one enormously wealthy, who can afford to let me have a secretary-steward as
  well as a housekeeper."</p>

  <p>"You've been thinking of that fellow Thain," he muttered.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, I haven't!" she replied. "Mr. Thain is a very pleasant person,
  but I can assure you that I have never considered him matrimonially. I
  suppose I ought to have done," she went on, "but, you know, I am just a
  little old-fashioned."</p>

  <p>"I can't see what's the matter with me," the young man said
  disconsolately. "I've a bit of my own, a screw from my job, and the governor
  allows me a trifle. We might work it up to ten thousand a year. We ought to
  be able to make a start on that."</p>

  <p>"It is positive wealth," Letitia acknowledged, "but I am sure you don't
  want me really, and I haven't the least inclination to get married, and
  heaven knows what would happen to dad if I let him go back to bachelor
  apartments!"</p>

  <p>"He'd take care of himself all right," Letitia's suitor observed
  confidently.</p>

  <p>"Would he!" she replied. "I am not at all sure. Our menkind always seem to
  have gone on sowing their wild oats most vigorously after middle age. Of
  course, if Ada Honeywell would marry him, I might feel a little easier in my
  mind."</p>

  <p>"Ada won't marry any one," Grantham declared, "and I am perfectly certain,
  if she were willing, your father wouldn't marry her. She's too
  boisterous."</p>

  <p>"Poor woman!" Letitia sighed. "She's immensely rich, but, you see, she has
  no past&mdash;I mean no pedigree. I am afraid it's out of the question."</p>

  <p>"I wish you would chuck rotting and marry me, Letitia," he begged.
  "There's a little house in Pont Street&mdash;suit us down to the ground."</p>

  <p>Letitia found herself gazing over the tops of the more distant trees.</p>

  <p>"We are going down to Mandeleys in a few days," she said presently. "I'll
  take myself seriously to task there. I suppose I must really want to be
  married only I don't know it. Don't be surprised if you get a telegram from
  me any day."</p>

  <p>"I'd come down there myself, if I had an invitation," he suggested.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Charlie," she declared, "it couldn't be done. So far as I can see at
  present, unless some of the tenantry offer their services for
  nothing&mdash;and our tenantry aren't like that&mdash;we shall have to keep
  house with about half a dozen servants, which means of course, only opening a
  few rooms. As a matter of fact, we shan't be able to go at all, unless Mr.
  Thain pays his rent for Broomleys in advance."</p>

  <p>They turned out of the Park and not a word passed between them again until
  Letitia descended from her horse in Grosvenor Square.</p>

  <p>"You were a dear to think of this, Charles," she said, standing on the
  steps and smiling at him. "I haven't enjoyed anything so much for a long
  time."</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't care about a theatre this evening?" he proposed.</p>

  <p>"Come in at tea time and see how I am feeling," she suggested. "I have dad
  rather on my hands. He has been wandering about like a lost sheep, the last
  few afternoons. I can't think what is wrong."</p>

  <p>She strolled across the hall and looked in at the study. The Marquis was
  seated in an easy-chair, reading a volume of Memoirs. She crossed the room
  towards him.</p>

  <p>"Father," she exclaimed, "you ought to have been out a beautiful morning
  like this."</p>

  <p>The Marquis laid down his book. He was certainly looking a little tired.
  Letitia came up to his side and patted his hand.</p>

  <p>"How's the gout?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Better," he replied, examining the offending finger.</p>

  <p>"You're just lazy, I believe," Letitia observed reprovingly. "The sooner
  we get down to Mandeleys the better."</p>

  <p>The Marquis glanced at a silver-framed calendar which stood upon the
  table. He had glanced at it about a hundred times during the last few
  days.</p>

  <p>"A little country air," he confessed, "will be very agreeable. I think
  perhaps, too," he went on, "that I am inclined to be weary of London. It is
  more of a city, after all, isn't it, for the bourgeois rich than for a
  penniless Marquis. Where did you get your mount from, dear?"</p>

  <p>"Charlie lent me a hack," she replied. "I've had a perfectly delightful
  ride."</p>

  <p>"You have not yet arrived, I suppose," her father went on, "at any fixed
  matrimonial intentions with regard to Charlie?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head a little dejectedly.</p>

  <p>"It's so hard," she confessed. "I am dying to say 'yes,' especially,
  somehow, during the last few days, but somehow I can't. I think it must be
  his fault," she added resentfully. "He doesn't ask me properly."</p>

  <p>"You'll find some one will be taking him off your hands before long," her
  father warned her. "Personally, I have no objection to find with the
  alliance."</p>

  <p>"Of course," Letitia complained, "it's very clear what you are thinking
  of! You want your bachelor apartments in the Albany again, and the gay life.
  I really feel that it is my duty to remain a spinster and look after
  you."</p>

  <p>The Marquis smiled. Once more his eyes glanced towards the calendar.</p>

  <p>"Better ask Charlie down to Mandeleys and settle it with him there," he
  suggested.</p>

  <p>"That's just what he wants," she sighed. "If we begin a house party there,
  though, think what a picnic it will be! And besides, Sylvia Laycey is sure to
  be somewhere about, and he'll probably fall in love with her again. I do wish
  I could make up my mind. What are you doing to-night, dad?"</p>

  <p>"I am dining with Montavon," her father replied, "at the club. He has a
  party of four for whist."</p>

  <p>"Dear old things!" Letitia murmured affectionately. "I hope you have
  Sheffield plate candlesticks on the table. Why not go in fancy
  dress&mdash;one of those Georgian Court dresses, you know&mdash;black velvet
  knickerbockers, a sword and peruke! Much better let me give you a lesson at
  auction bridge."</p>

  <p>The Marquis shivered.</p>

  <p>"You play the game?" he asked politely.</p>

  <p>"I tried it as a means of subsistence," Letitia confessed, "but my
  partners always did such amazing things that I found there was nothing in it.
  If you are really dining out, dad, I shall go to the play with Charlie."</p>

  <p>"Alone?"</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly, dear," Letitia protested, flicking her whip. "Remember
  what that wicked old lady wrote in her memoirs&mdash;'Balham requires a
  chaperon, but Grosvenor Square never.' I shall try and get used to him this
  evening. I may even have wonderful news for you in the morning."</p>

  <p>The Marquis took up his book again.</p>

  <p>"I wish, my dear, that I could believe it," he told her fervently.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

  <p>"I feel like the German lady," Marcia observed, as she stood before her
  little sideboard and mixed a whisky and soda, "who went on cutting bread and
  butter. The world falls to pieces before my eyes&mdash;and I press the handle
  of a syphon. There!"</p>

  <p>She carried the tumbler to Borden, who was seated by her fireside, and
  threw herself into an easy-chair opposite to him.</p>

  <p>"I know it's all wrong," she declared. "My instincts are so obstinate even
  about the simplest things. You see, I have even wheeled away his easy-chair
  so that you shan't sit in it."</p>

  <p>"Women always confuse instincts with prejudices," Borden rejoined, calmly
  sipping his whisky and soda. "May I smoke a pipe?"</p>

  <p>Marcia gave a little gesture of despair.</p>

  <p>"I never knew a man," she exclaimed, "who exhibited such a propensity for
  making himself at home! Tell me," she went on, "did you notice a very
  aristocratic looking, almost beautiful girl, with large brown eyes and a pale
  skin, seated in the stalls just below our box?"</p>

  <p>"The girl with Charles Grantham?"</p>

  <p>Marcia nodded.</p>

  <p>"That was Lady Letitia Thursford," she told him.</p>

  <p>"Is she engaged to Grantham?"</p>

  <p>"She wasn't last week," Marcia replied. "I think the Marquis would like
  it, but Lady Letitia is by way of being difficult. I saw her looking at me
  thoughtfully, once or twice. I was dying to send down word to her that I had
  permission."</p>

  <p>Borden moved in his chair a little uneasily.</p>

  <p>"You are bound to no one," he reminded her. "There is no one of whom you
  need to ask permission."</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly," Marcia replied. "I asked permission, and without it I
  wouldn't have dined with you alone to-night or lunched with Morris Hyde on
  Tuesday."</p>

  <p>"I trust that both entertainments," he ventured, "have been a
  success."</p>

  <p>Marcia shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Morris Hyde was very disappointing," she confessed. "I was looking
  forward to being tremendously entertained, but instead of telling me all
  about these unknown tribes in Central America, his only anxiety seemed to be
  to know if I was going to let him kiss me in the taxi afterwards. Explorers,
  I am afraid, are far too promiscuous."</p>

  <p>"Publishers," Borden said firmly, "are renowned throughout the world for
  their fidelity."</p>

  <p>"Fidelity to their cash boxes," Marcia scoffed.</p>

  <p>Borden, who had lit his pipe, blinked at her through a little cloud of
  smoke. They had come straight from the theatre, and he was in the evening
  clothes of a man who cares nothing about his appearance,&mdash;the black
  waistcoat, the none-too-well fitting shirt, the plainest of studs, and the
  indifferently arranged white tie. Nevertheless, Marcia liked the look of him,
  seated at ease in her low chair, and it was very obvious that he, too,
  approved of his hostess. She was curled up now at the end of the sofa, a
  cigarette in her mouth, an expression of curious perplexity upon her face.
  She was dressed very plainly in black, having alternately tried on and
  discarded all her more elaborate evening gowns. She had had a queer, almost
  desperate fancy to make herself look as unattractive as possible, but the
  very simplicity of her dress enhanced the gleaming perfection of her throat
  and arms. Even her posture, which should have been ungraceful, suited her.
  Her disturbed and doubtful frame of mind had softened her firm mouth, and lit
  with a sort of sweet plaintiveness her beautiful eyes.</p>

  <p>"Do you think," he asked, "that I look upon you as a promising
  investment?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I am," Marcia replied. "You admit having made money out of me this
  spring."</p>

  <p>"At any rate, I am willing to divide it," he suggested.</p>

  <p>"Upon conditions!"</p>

  <p>"No one in the world gives something for nothing," he reminded her.</p>

  <p>"We seem to be mixing up business and the other things most shockingly,"
  Marcia declared. "Do you really mean that you are willing to share the
  profits of my next novel with me?"</p>

  <p>"I couldn't do that," he objected, "it would be too unbusinesslike. I am
  quite willing, however, to share my life and all I have with you."</p>

  <p>"Mere rhetoric!" Marcia exclaimed uneasily.</p>

  <p>"Solemn earnest," he insisted. "Will you marry me, Marcia?"</p>

  <p>She looked across at him. Her eyebrows were a little raised, her eyes
  inclined to be misty, her mouth tremulous.</p>

  <p>"James," she replied, "I believe I'd like to. I'm not quite sure&mdash;I
  believe I would. But just tell me&mdash;how can I?"</p>

  <p>"He has kept you to himself for pretty well twenty years," Borden said
  gruffly.</p>

  <p>She sighed.</p>

  <p>"When I was a child of seventeen," she confided, "a young farmer down at
  Mandeleys kissed me. If I had been one year younger," she went on, "I should
  have spat at him. As it was, I never spoke to him again. Then, a few months
  after that, the schoolmaster at the school where I was teaching made an
  awkward attempt at the same thing. He missed me, but his lips just touched my
  cheek. Then Reginald came. Let me see, that was nineteen years ago, and since
  then no one else has kissed me."</p>

  <p>"A record of fidelity," Borden observed, "at which, even in your own
  stories, you would scoff."</p>

  <p>"But then, you see," she reminded him, "I never write about a person with
  queer ideas like mine, because they wouldn't be interesting. People like a
  little more resilience about their heroines."</p>

  <p>"Couldn't we talk brutal common sense for once?" he asked impatiently. "I
  have never abused your Marquis. From your own showing, he has played the
  game, as you have. All I want to say is that the natural time has come for
  your separation. I have waited for you a good many years, and I am a domestic
  man. I want a home&mdash;and children. It's quite time you wanted the
  same."</p>

  <p>Perhaps for a moment the light in her eyes was a shade softer. She moved
  uneasily in her place.</p>

  <p>"Quite primitive, aren't you, James?" she murmured.</p>

  <p>"Life's a primitive thing when we get down to the bone," he answered. "You
  and I have wasted many an hour discussing the ologies, trying to thrust
  ourselves into the peculiar point of view of these neurotic Norwegians or mad
  Russians. When you come down to bedrock, though, for sober, decent people
  there is only one outlet to passion, only one elementary satisfaction for man
  and woman."</p>

  <p>"You make things sound very simple."</p>

  <p>"It isn't that," he persisted. "It's you who make them complex by being
  maudlin about this man. He has had what many would call the best part of your
  life. He has given up nothing for your sake, done nothing for your sake. He
  has kept you in the same seclusion that his grandfather would have done. He
  has treated you, so far as regards the outside world, as a man
  does&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped abruptly. Something in her eyes warned him.</p>

  <p>"There are limits," she told him drily, "to my appreciation of unbridled
  speech. According to his lights, Reginald has been wonderful. To me there has
  been more romance than ignominy in many of his ideas. My trouble is something
  different. I can't quite make up my mind what it would mean for him if I were
  to strike out for myself now."</p>

  <p>"You are like all women," he declared furiously. "You complicate every
  situation in life by thinking of other people. Think for yourself, Marcia.
  What about your own future? I promise you that your Marquis would think for
  himself, if he were up against a similar problem. He is getting all he wants.
  Are you? Of course you aren't!"</p>

  <p>"Does anybody get all they want out of life?"</p>

  <p>"It is generally their own fault if they don't get the main things," he
  insisted. "But, see here, I'll attack you with your own weapons. Here am I,
  forty-one years old, in love with you since I was thirty-two. What about
  those nine years? I am dropping into the ways of untidy, unsatisfactory
  bachelordom. I only order new clothes when some friend chaffs me into it, and
  if I do I forget the ties and shirts and those sorts of things. I've lost all
  interest in myself. I loaf at the club, play auction bridge when I might be
  doing something a great deal better, and drink a whisky and soda when any one
  asks me. I hang on to the business, but when I've finished my work I drift.
  In another five years' time I shall begin to stoop, I shall live with cigar
  ash all over my clothes, and I shall have to be taken home from the club
  every other night. Your doing, Marcia&mdash;your responsibility."</p>

  <p>"I should think," she said severely, "that your self-respect&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't bother about my self-respect!" he interrupted. "I am a human
  being, and I tell you, Marcia, that every man needs something in his life to
  lift him just a little, to live up to, not down to. There is only one person
  in the world can take that place for me. I'm a clear charge upon your hands.
  You know that I love you, that you've driven all thoughts of other women out
  of my head, that you keep me beating against the walls of my impotence every
  time we meet and part. I am perfectly certain, if you don't come down to the
  world of common sense, I shall sink into the world of melodrama and go and
  tackle your Marquis myself. He must let you go."</p>

  <p>"Do you want me as much as all that?" she asked, a little wistfully.</p>

  <p>He was by her side in a moment, inspired by the break in her tone, the
  sweet, soft look in her eyes. He sank on one knee by the side of her couch
  and took her hands in his, kissing them one after the other.</p>

  <p>"Ah, Marcia," he murmured, "I want you more than anything else on earth! I
  want you so much that, when you come, you will make the years that have
  passed seem like nothing but a nightmare, and the minutes, as they come,
  years of happiness. I am awkward, I know, sometimes, and gruff and morose,
  but so is any man who spends his life fretting for the thing he can't get. I
  only ask you, dear, to be fair. I have never said an unkind word about the
  man for whom you have cared so long. I only say now that you belong to me. I
  am not a bit foolish&mdash;I am not even jealous&mdash;only your time has
  come, your time for that little home in the country, a husband always with
  you, and, I hope to Heaven, children."</p>

  <p>She took his face between her hands and kissed him. He understood her so
  perfectly that, as she drew her lips away, he rose and stood on the
  hearthrug, a conqueror yet humble.</p>

  <p>"You won't mind," she begged, "if I choose my own time? It may be very
  soon, it may be a little time. You will leave it to me, and you will trust
  me. From to-night, of course&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She hesitated, but his gesture was sufficient. She knew that she was
  understood.</p>

  <p>"You have made me the happiest man in the world," he said. "I can't stop a
  moment longer&mdash;I should simply say extravagant things. And I know how
  you feel. It isn't quite time for them yet. But you'll send for me?"</p>

  <p>"Of course!"</p>

  <p>"And about your visit to Mandeleys?" he asked. "I shan't begin to be busy
  again for another fortnight."</p>

  <p>She hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Somehow," she confessed, "it seems a little different now.</p>

  <p>"It needn't," he replied. "I am content with what I have."</p>

  <p>She glanced at the calendar.</p>

  <p>"Tuesday?" she suggested.</p>

  <p>"Tuesday would suit me admirably," he assented.</p>

  <p>She let him out herself, and he kissed her fingers. He was never quite
  sure whether he walked down the stairs or whether he rang for the lift. He
  was never quite sure whether he looked for a taxi or decided to walk. He
  passed over the bridge, and the lights reflected in the dark waters below
  seemed suddenly like jewels. He made his way to his club because of the sheer
  impossibility of sleep. He stood on the threshold of the reading room and
  looked in at the little group of semi-somnolent men. In his way he was
  popular, and he received a good many sleepy greetings.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with Borden?" one man drawled. "He looks as though some
  one had left him a fortune."</p>

  <p>"He has probably discovered another literary star," a rival publisher
  suggested.</p>

  <p>"I wish to God some one would send him to a decent tailor!" a third man
  yawned.</p>

  <p>Borden rang the bell for a drink.</p>

  <p>"Dickinson was right," he said. "I've found a new star."</p><br>

  <p>Letitia, on her return from the theatre that same evening, found her
  father seated in a comfortable corner of the library, with a volume of Don
  Quixote in his hand, a whisky and soda and a box of cigarettes by his side.
  He had exchanged his dinner jacket for a plain black velvet coat, and, as he
  laid his book down at her coming, she seemed to notice again that vague look
  of tiredness in his face.</p>

  <p>"Quiet evening, dad?" she asked, flinging herself into a low chair by his
  side.</p>

  <p>"A very pleasant one," he replied. "Montavon's party was postponed, but I
  have reopened an old fund of amusement here. With the exception of Borrow,
  none of our modern humourists appeal to me like Cervantes."</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't call Borrow exactly modern, would you?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not," the Marquis conceded. "I may be wrong to ignore the
  literature of the present day, but such attempts as I have made to appreciate
  it have been unsatisfactory. You enjoyed the play, dear?"</p>

  <p>"Very much," Letitia acquiesced. "The house was crowded."</p>

  <p>"Any one you know?"</p>

  <p>She mentioned a few names, then she hesitated. "And that clever woman who
  wrote 'The Changing Earth' was there in a box&mdash;Marcia Hannaway. She was
  with rather a dour-looking man&mdash;her publisher, I think Charlie said it
  was."</p>

  <p>The Marquis received the information with no signs of particular interest.
  Letitia stretched out for a cigarette, lit it and looked a little appealingly
  at her father.</p>

  <p>"Dad," she said, "I've made an awful idiot of myself."</p>

  <p>"In what direction?" the Marquis enquired sympathetically. "If it is a
  financial matter, I am fortunately&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Worse!" Letitia groaned. "I've promised to marry Charlie Grantham."</p>

  <p>The Marquis stretched out his long, elegant hand and patted his
  daughter's.</p>

  <p>"But, my dear child," he said, "surely that was inevitable, was it not? I
  have looked upon it as almost certain to happen some day."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm rather glad you take it like that," Letitia remarked. "Now I
  come to think of it, I suppose I should have had to say 'yes' sometime or
  another."</p>

  <p>"Where is Charlie?"</p>

  <p>"Gone home in a huff, because I wouldn't let him kiss me in the car or
  bring him in with me."</p>

  <p>"Either course would surely have been usual," the Marquis ventured.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps, but I feel unusual," Letitia declared. "It isn't that I mind
  marrying Charlie, but I know I shall detest being married to him."</p>

  <p>"One must remember, dear," her father went on soothingly, "that with us,
  marriage is scarcely a subject for neurotic ecstasies or most unwholesome
  hysterics. Your position imposes upon you the necessity of an alliance with
  some house of kindred associations. The choice, therefore, is not a large
  one, and you are spared the very undignified competitive considerations which
  attach themselves to people when it does not matter whom on earth they marry.
  The Dukedom of Grantham is unfortunately not an ancient one, nor was it
  conferred upon such illustrious stock as the Marquisate of Mandeleys.
  However, the Granthams have their place amongst us, and I imagine that the
  alliance will generally be considered satisfactory."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I hope so," Letitia replied, without enthusiasm. "I only hope I shall
  find it satisfactory. I didn't mean to say 'yes' for at least another
  year."</p>

  <p>The Marquis smiled tolerantly.</p>

  <p>"Then what, my dear child," he asked, "hastened your decision?"</p>

  <p>Letitia became suddenly more serious. She bit her lip and frowned
  distinctly into the fire. At that moment she was furious with a thought.</p>

  <p>"I can't tell you, dad," she confessed. "I'd hate to tell you. I'd hate to
  put it in plain words, even to myself."</p>

  <p>He patted her hand tolerantly.</p>

  <p>"You must not take yourself too hardly to task, Letitia," he said, "if at
  times you feel the pressure of the outside world. You are young and of
  versatile temperament. Believe me, those voices to which you may have
  listened are only echoes. Nothing exists or is real in life which the brain
  does not govern. I am quite sure that you will never regret the step which
  you have taken this evening."</p>

  <p>Letitia stood up.</p>

  <p>"I hope not, father," she sighed, a little wistfully. "There are times
  when I am very dissatisfied with myself, and to-night, I am afraid, is one of
  them."</p>

  <p>"You analyse your sentiments, my dear, too severely," her father told her.
  "You are too conscientious. Your actions are all that could be desired."</p>

  <p>"You won't be lonely if that idiot takes me away from you soon?" she
  asked.</p>

  <p>The Marquis looked almost shocked.</p>

  <p>"Loneliness is not a complaint from which I ever expect to suffer, dear,"
  he said, as he rose and opened the door for her.</p>

  <p>He returned to his empty chair, his half consumed whisky and soda, his
  vellum-bound volume, carefully marked. Somehow or other, the echoes of his
  last words seemed to be ringing in his ears. The fire had burned a little
  low, the sound of passing vehicles from outside had grown fainter and
  fainter. He took up his book, threw himself into his chair, gazed with vacant
  eyes at the thick black print. There was a sudden chill in his heart, a
  sudden thought, perhaps a fear. There was one way through which loneliness
  could come.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

  <p>Marcia, who had dreamed all night of blue skies flecked with little
  fragments of white cloud, a soft west wind and sun-bathed meadows, descended
  the creaking stairs of the Inn at Fakenham, paused upon the broad landing to
  admire the great oak chests and the cupboards full of china, and then made
  her way to the coffee room. She found Borden standing at the window, looking
  down into the country street and talking with a stranger, whom he left,
  however, at her entrance. They took their places at the breakfast table to
  which a waiter ushered them.</p>

  <p>"Still lucky," her companion remarked, as he watched Marcia pour out the
  coffee. "It's going to be another delightful day."</p>

  <p>She glanced out into the sunlit street. Just opposite was a house almost
  hidden in clematis, and in the background was a tall row of elm trees amongst
  the branches of which the rooks were cawing.</p>

  <p>"I feel like Rip van Winkle," she whispered. "Do you know that twenty-five
  years ago I came to what is called a Farmers' Ordinary in this very room?
  Tell me," she went on, "who was the man with whom you were talking? His face
  is quite familiar to me."</p>

  <p>He glanced around. Thain had taken his place at the further end of the
  room.</p>

  <p>"The man of whom we were speaking the other day," he said,&mdash;"David
  Thain. I think that you have met him, haven't you?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Why, of course! I didn't recognise him in tweeds. Whatever is he doing
  down here? But I know before you can tell me," she continued quickly. "He has
  taken Broomleys, hasn't he?"</p>

  <p>"He told me that he had taken a house in the neighbourhood," Borden
  replied. "He is going over there this morning to meet the present
  occupiers."</p>

  <p>"It is a very small world," Marcia observed. "I wonder whether he
  recognised me."</p>

  <p>"Without undue flattery, I think I might say that I should think it
  probable."</p>

  <p>"And of course he is imagining all sorts of improper
  things,&mdash;chuckling about them, I dare say, in the way men do. He is
  being what I suppose he thinks tactful. He never glances in this direction at
  all. I'll give him a surprise in a minute or two!"</p>

  <p>They finished their breakfast, and Marcia crossed towards David's table.
  As soon as he was conscious of her approach, he rose. He welcomed her,
  however, without a smile.</p>

  <p>"From Trewly's at dinner to the Mandeleys Arms for breakfast," she
  remarked, smiling. "I feel quite flattered that you remembered me, Mr.
  Thain."</p>

  <p>"Did I show any signs of remembering you?" he asked a little grimly.</p>

  <p>"Of course you didn't," she acknowledged. "You ignored even my sweetest
  bow. That is why I felt sure that you recognised me perfectly."</p>

  <p>David remained silent, standing still with an air of complete but
  respectful patience.</p>

  <p>"You have taken a house down here, the Marquis tells me," she
  continued.</p>

  <p>"I have taken Broomleys."</p>

  <p>"I hope that you will like the neighbourhood," she said. "I used to live
  here once myself."</p>

  <p>"So I understood."</p>

  <p>She was for a moment taken aback, conscious now of a certain definitely
  inimical attitude in the man who stood looking coldly into her eyes.</p>

  <p>"You know all about me, then? That is the worst of getting into 'Who's
  Who.'"</p>

  <p>"I know more about you than I do about your companion, certainly," he
  admitted.</p>

  <p>She laughed mockingly. To a downright declaration of war she had no
  objection whatever.</p>

  <p>"That is Mr. Borden, who publishes my stories," she told him. "I don't
  suppose you read them, do you?"</p>

  <p>"I am not sure," he replied. "I read very little modern fiction, and I
  never look at the names of the authors."</p>

  <p>"Then we must take it for granted," she sighed, "that my fame is unknown
  to you. If you should see the Marquis before I do, please tell him that he
  was entirely wrong about the best route here. His advice has cost us nearly
  thirty miles and a punctured tire. You won't forget?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," he promised.</p>

  <p>She turned away with a little nod of farewell, to which David's response
  was still entirely formal. Left alone in the room he resumed his breakfast,
  finished it with diminished appetite, and within a few minutes was speeding
  through the country lanes in his great Rolls-Royce car. The chauffeur sat a
  little uneasily in his place. It was very seldom that his master showed such
  signs of haste. In a quarter of an hour they were in the avenue of Mandeleys.
  Instead of turning to the right, however, to Broomleys, he took the turning
  to the Abbey and pulled up short when within a hundred yards of the
  house.</p>

  <p>"Wait here for me," he directed. "If you see another car coming up, blow
  your horn."</p>

  <p>He walked across the smooth, ancient turf, stepped over the wire fence and
  raised the latch of Richard Vont's cottage gate. His uncle, a little
  disturbed, came hastily down the garden path. His clothes were stained with
  clay, and the perspiration was on his forehead. David looked at him in
  surprise.</p>

  <p>"Working so early?"</p>

  <p>Vont nodded.</p>

  <p>"You forget," he said, "that this is not early for me. All my life I have
  risen with the sun and gone to bed with it. Come inside, David. I'll get this
  muck off my hands. You spoke of the afternoon."</p>

  <p>"I came direct from the village," David replied, as he followed his uncle
  into the house. "I came because I thought you would like to know that there
  is another visitor on the way to see you."</p>

  <p>Richard Vont looked round and faced his nephew. His shirt was open at the
  throat, his trousers were tied up with little pieces of string. In whatever
  labour he had been engaged, it had obviously been of a strenuous character.
  He wiped the perspiration from his forehead.</p>

  <p>"What's that, David?" he demanded. "A visitor?"</p>

  <p>"Marcia is at the Mandeleys Arms," David told him. "I am taking it for
  granted that she is on her way to see you."</p>

  <p>Vont turned deliberately away, and David heard his heavy feet ascending
  the staircase. In a few moments he called downstairs. His voice was as
  usual.</p>

  <p>"Step round this afternoon, lad, if you think it's well."</p>

  <p>David passed out of the little garden, crossed the strip of park, and,
  taking the wheel, drove slowly round by the longer route to Broomleys. He
  passed before the front of the Abbey&mdash;a mansion of the dead, with row
  after row of closed blinds, masses of smokeless chimneys, and patches of
  weeds growing thick in the great sweep before the house. Even with its air of
  pitiless desertion, its severe, semi-ecclesiastical outline, its ruined
  cloisters empty to the sky on one wing, its unbroken and gloomy silence, the
  place had its atmosphere. David slackened the speed of his car, paused for a
  moment and looked back at the little creeper-covered cottage on the other
  side of the moat. So those two had faced one another through the
  years&mdash;the Abbey, silent, magnificent, historical, with all the placid
  majesty of its countless rows of windows; its chapel, where Mandeleys for
  generations had been christened and buried,&mdash;at its gates the little
  cottage, whose garden was filled with spring flowers, and from whose single
  stack of chimneys the smoke curled upwards. Even while he watched, Richard
  Vont stood there upon the threshold with a great book under his arm.</p>

  <p>David shivered a little as he threw in the clutch, passed on round the
  back of the building and through the iron gates of the ancient dower house.
  He felt a little sigh of relief as he pulled up in front of the long, grey
  house, in front of which Sylvia Laycey was waiting to receive him. She waved
  her hand gaily and looked with admiration at the car.</p>

  <p>"They are all here, Mr. Thain," she exclaimed,&mdash;"Mr. Merridrew and
  father and your own builder. Come along and quarrel about the fixtures. I
  thought I had better stay with you because dad loses his temper so."</p>

  <p>David descended almost blithely from his car. He was back again in a human
  atmosphere, and the pressure of the girl's fingers was an instant relief to
  him.</p>

  <p>"I am not going to quarrel with any one," he declared. "I shall do exactly
  what Mr. Muddicombe tells me&mdash;and you."</p>

  <p>She was a very pleasant type of young Englishwoman&mdash;distinctly
  pretty, fair-skinned, healthy and good-humoured. Notwithstanding the fact
  that their acquaintance was of the briefest, David was already conscious of
  her charm.</p>

  <p>"You'll find me, in particular, very grasping," she declared, as they
  entered the long, low hall. "I want to make everything I can out of you, so
  that daddy and I can have a real good two months in London. I don't believe
  you know the value of things a bit, do you&mdash;except of railways and those
  colossal things? Cupboards, for instance? Do you know anything about
  cupboards? And are you going to allow us anything for the extra bathroom we
  put in?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I am rather partial to bathrooms," he confessed, "and I should hate
  you to take it away with you."</p>

  <p>She drew a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>"So long as you look upon the bathroom matter reasonably, I am quite sure
  we shan't quarrel. Tell me about Lady Letitia, please? Is she quite
  well&mdash;and the Marquis and all of them? And when are they coming
  down?"</p>

  <p>"They are quite well," he told her, "and Lady Letitia sent you her love.
  They talk of coming down almost at once."</p>

  <p>"I do hope they will," she replied, "because when we leave here dad and I
  are going to stay for a week or so with some friends quite near. There! Did
  you hear that noise? That's daddy stamping because he is getting
  impatient."</p>

  <p>"Then perhaps&mdash;" David suggested.</p>

  <p>"I suppose we'd better," she interrupted. "Be lenient about the bathroom,
  please. And if you could manage not to notice that the dining room wants
  papering, you'd be an angel. This way."</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

  <p>David proved himself such a very satisfactory incoming tenant that the
  Colonel insisted upon his staying to lunch and hastened off into the cellar
  to find a bottle of old Marsala, of which he proposed that they should
  partake with a dry biscuit before Mr. Merridrew's departure. Sylvia sank into
  a low chair with a little exclamation of despair.</p>

  <p>"Now daddy's done it!" she exclaimed. "Are you hungry, Mr. Thain?"</p>

  <p>"Not very&mdash;yet," David replied, glancing at his watch. "You see, it's
  only half-past eleven."</p>

  <p>"Because," she said impressively, "there are exactly three rather skinny
  cutlets in the house. All the servants left this morning&mdash;'all', I said.
  We only have two!&mdash;and an old woman from the village is coming up at
  half-past twelve to cook them. One was for me and two were for father.
  Perhaps you will tell me what I am to do?"</p>

  <p>David smiled.</p>

  <p>"Well," he observed, "I was distinctly asked to luncheon, and I accepted.
  Haven't you anything&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Anything what?" she asked patiently.</p>

  <p>"Tinned in the house, or that sort of thing?" he suggested, a little
  vaguely.</p>

  <p>"Of course we haven't," she replied. "Don't you know that we are all
  packed up and leaving to-morrow? It's the biggest wonder in the world that we
  have any biscuits to eat with that precious Marsala."</p>

  <p>"Why not," he proposed hopefully, "put on your hat and motor into Fakenham
  with me? I suppose there is a butcher's shop there. We can buy something
  together."</p>

  <p>She sprang to her feet.</p>

  <p>"And you can choose exactly what you like!" she exclaimed. "Mr. Thain, you
  are delightful! That is the best of you Americans. You are full of resource.
  I shan't be a minute getting a hat and a pair of gloves."</p>

  <p>David strolled about the gardens of his new demesne until Sylvia
  reappeared. She had pinned on a blue tam-o'-shanter and was wearing a jersey
  of the same colour.</p>

  <p>"I shall love a spin in your car!" she exclaimed. "And you drive yourself,
  too. How delightful!"</p>

  <p>They swung off through the more thickly wooded part of the park, driving
  in places between dense clumps of rhododendrons, and coming unexpectedly upon
  a walled garden, neglected, but brilliant with spring and early summer
  flowers.</p>

  <p>"Isn't it queer to have a garden so far away from the house," the girl
  remarked, "but I dare say you've heard that the late Marquis of Mandeleys was
  mad about underground passages. There is one existing somewhere or other to
  the summer house in that garden from the Abbey, and lots of others. I am not
  at all sure that there isn't one to Broomleys."</p>

  <p>"Haven't you been afraid sometimes lest the ghosts of the dead monks might
  pay you an unexpected visit?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"They always held the funeral services in the chapel," she explained, "but
  the burying place is at the side of the hill there. You can see the Mandeleys
  vault from here."</p>

  <p>"And the cypress trees," David pointed out. "I wonder how old they
  are."</p>

  <p>"The American of you!" she scoffed. "You ought to love Mandeleys&mdash;and
  Broomleys. Everything about the place is musty and ancient and worn out. You
  know the Marquis, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"Slightly," David assented.</p>

  <p>"Is he really human," she asked, "or is he something splendidly
  picturesque which has just stepped out of one of the frames in his picture
  gallery? I can never make up my mind. He is so beautiful to look at, but he
  doesn't look as though he belonged to this generation, and why on earth they
  ever used to call him 'The Wicked Marquis' I can't imagine. I've tried him
  myself," she went on ingenuously, "in no end of ways, but he treats me always
  as though I were some grandchild, walking on stilts. Of course you're in love
  with Lady Letitia?"</p>

  <p>"Must I be?"</p>

  <p>"But isn't it all absolutely preordained?" she insisted, "in fact, it's
  almost depressingly obvious. Here are the Mandeleys estates, the finest in
  Norfolk, mortgaged up to the hilt, the Abbey shut up, the Marquis and all of
  them living on credit, the family fortunes at their lowest ebb. And here come
  you, an interesting American stranger, with more millions than the world has
  ever heard of before. Of course you marry Lady Letitia and release the
  estates!"</p>

  <p>"Do I!" he murmured. "Well, it seems plausible."</p>

  <p>"It has to be done," she decided, with a sigh. "It's a pity."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"We mustn't flirt. We should be interfering with the decrees of
  Providence.&mdash;What an interesting-looking woman! You know her, too."</p>

  <p>They passed Marcia and her companion, about half-way to Fakenham. Marcia
  bowed cheerfully and looked with interest at Sylvia.</p>

  <p>"I know her very slightly," David admitted.</p>

  <p>"She doesn't belong to these parts," Sylvia said. "We've lived here for
  nearly seven years, you know, and I know every one for miles round, by
  sight."</p>

  <p>"She came originally from somewhere in the neighbourhood, I believe,"
  David observed.</p>

  <p>"Tell me everything about her, please?" his companion demanded. "I am a
  born gossip."</p>

  <p>"You finish with the romance of Mandeleys first," he suggested
  evasively.</p>

  <p>"Well, we've finished that, so far as you are concerned," she said, "but
  as soon as you have rescued the family and the wedding bells have ceased
  ringing, you'll find yourself faced with another problem. Did you notice a
  queer little cottage, right opposite the Abbey?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I did."</p>

  <p>"Well, there's an old man sits in the garden there," she went on, "reading
  the Bible and cursing the Marquis, most of the day. He used to do it years
  ago, and then he went to America. Now he's come back, and he's started it
  again."</p>

  <p>"And what does the Marquis do about it?" David enquired.</p>

  <p>"He can't do anything. The late Marquis made the old man a present of the
  cottage for saving his life, and they can't take it away from him now. I
  suppose he must have been really wicked when he was young&mdash;I mean the
  Marquis," she went on, "because, you see, he ran away with that old man's
  daughter. It's the sort of thing," she went on, "that Marquises are supposed
  to do in stories, but it doesn't make them popular in a small neighbourhood.
  Now tell me about the good-looking woman who bowed to you, please?"</p>

  <p>"She is the daughter of the man of whom you have been speaking," David
  told her. "She is the lady with whom the wicked Marquis eloped nearly twenty
  years ago."</p>

  <p>Sylvia's interest was almost breathless.</p>

  <p>"You mean to say that you knew the story&mdash;you&mdash;an American?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely," he replied. "I came into touch with it in a queer way. The
  old man Vont came back from America on the same steamer that I did. I'll tell
  you another thing. The wicked Marquis, as you call him, and that lady whom we
  have just passed, dine together now at least one night a week, and the woman
  has become quite a famous authoress. She writes under the name, I believe, of
  Marcia Hannaway."</p>

  <p>Sylvia threw herself back in her seat.</p>

  <p>"Why, it's amazing!" she declared. "It turns a sordid little village
  tragedy into a piece of wonderful romance. Perhaps, after all, that is what
  makes the Marquis seem like a piece of wood to every other woman."</p>

  <p>"I have heard it said," David continued, "that he has been entirely
  faithful to her all his life. Where do I stop, please?"</p>

  <p>"Here," she replied, "at this shop. Please come in and choose your own
  meat. I feel in much too romantic a frame of mind to even know beef from
  mutton."</p>

  <p>David followed her a little doubtfully into the shop.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," he ventured to suggest, "as the nucleus of your meal has
  already been decided upon&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of course," she interrupted; "cutlets. We want more cutlets. You needn't
  bother. I'll see about it."</p>

  <p>David slipped into the next shop and reappeared with a huge box of
  chocolates, which he handed over apologetically.</p>

  <p>"I am not sure whether you'll find these up to much."</p>

  <p>"For the first time," she exclaimed, as she accepted them, "I realise what
  it must be to be a millionaire! I have never seen such a box of chocolates in
  my life. Do you mind going over to the grocer's and letting him see me with
  you?" she went on. "It will be so good for our credit, and his is just one of
  the accounts we have to leave for a little time. Were you ever poor, Mr.
  Thain?"</p>

  <p>"Poor, but not, alas! romantically so," he confessed. "To be the real
  thing, I ought to have earned my first few pounds, oughtn't I? You see, I
  didn't. I was educated by relatives, and when a great chance came my way I
  was able to take advantage of it. An uncle advanced me a thousand pounds,
  upon one condition."</p>

  <p>"Had you to make him a partner?" she asked, in the intervals of giving a
  small order at the grocer's.</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No," he answered gravely, "it wasn't a financial condition. In a way it
  was something more difficult."</p>

  <p>She looked at him curiously.</p>

  <p>"Whatever it was," she said, "if you promised, I am quite sure that you
  would keep your word."</p>

  <p>They motored homewards and David was for a few minutes unexpectedly
  thoughtful. He deliberately approached Broomleys from the back, but even then
  it was impossible to avoid a distant view of the cottage. He looked towards
  it grimly.</p>

  <p>"Conditions are stern things," he sighed.</p>

  <p>"Haven't you kept that one yet?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"The time is only just coming," he told her.</p>

  <p>She looked up at him pleadingly.</p>

  <p>"Don't bother about it now, please," she begged. "This is such a
  delightful day. And whatever you do, you mustn't let it interfere with your
  eating three cutlets."</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

  <p>Borden's car came to a standstill in the avenue, and Marcia looked across
  the strip of green turf towards the cottage with a queer little thrill of
  remembrance.</p>

  <p>"You are sure you won't mind waiting?" she asked, as she sprang down. "If
  there is any fatted calf about, I'll call you in."</p>

  <p>Borden showed her his pockets, bulging with newspapers.</p>

  <p>"I shall be perfectly content here," he said, "however long you may be. I
  shall back the car on to the turf and read."</p>

  <p>She nodded, turned away, lifted the latch of the gate and made her way
  towards the cottage,&mdash;curiously silent, and with no visible sign of
  habitation except for the smoke curling up from the chimney. As she drew
  nearer to the rustic entrance, she hesitated. A rush of those very sensations
  at which she had so often gently mocked swept through her consciousness,
  unsteadying and bewildering her. Mandeleys, imposing in its grim stillness,
  seemed to be throwing out shadows towards her, catching her up in a whirlpool
  of memories, half sentimental, half tragical. It was in the little cottage
  garden where she now stood, and in the woods beyond, that she had wandered
  with that strange new feeling in her heart of which she was, even at that
  moment, intensely conscious, gazing through the mists of her inexperience
  towards the new world and new heaven which her love was unfolding before her.
  A hundred forgotten fancies flashed into her brain. She remembered, with a
  singular and most unnerving accuracy, the silent vigils which she had spent,
  half hidden amongst those tall hollyhocks. She had seen the grey twilight of
  morning pass, seen the mists roll away and, turret by turret, the great house
  stand out like some fairy palace fashioned from space in a single night. She
  had seen the thrushes hop from the shrubberies and coverts on to the
  dew-spangled lawn, had heard their song, growing always in volume, had seen
  the faint sunlight flash in the windows, before she had crept back to her
  room. Another day in that strange turmoil which had followed the coming of
  her love! She had watched shooting parties assemble in the drive outside, her
  father in command, she herself hidden yet watchful, her eyes always upon one
  figure, her thoughts with him. And then the nights&mdash;the summer
  nights&mdash;when men and women in evening costume strolled down from the
  house. She could see their white shirt fronts glistening in the twilight.
  Again she heard the firm yet loitering step and the quiet, still voice which
  had changed the world for her. "Is Vont about, Miss Marcia?" she would hear
  him say. "I want to have a talk with him about the partridge drives
  to-morrow." She closed her eyes. The smell of the honeysuckle and the early
  cottage roses seemed suddenly almost stupefying. There were a few
  seconds&mdash;perhaps even a minute&mdash;before Vont had donned his brown
  velveteen coat and issued from the cottage&mdash;just time for a whispered
  word, a glance, a touch of the fingers.&mdash;Marcia felt her knees shake as
  she lingered underneath the porch. She was swept with recalcitrant memories,
  stinging like the lash of a whip. Perhaps this new wisdom of hers was, after
  all, a delusion, the old standards of her Calvinistic childhood unassailable.
  Then, for the first time, she was conscious of a familiar figure. Richard
  Vont was seated in a hard kitchen chair at the end of the garden, with a book
  upon his knee and his face turned to Mandeleys. At the sound of her little
  exclamation he turned his head. At first it was clear that he did not
  recognise his visitor. He laid down the book and rose to his feet. Marcia
  came a few steps towards him and then paused. Several very ingenious openings
  escaped her altogether.</p>

  <p>"Father," she began, a little hesitatingly, "you see, I've come to see
  you. Are you glad?"</p>

  <p>He stood looking at her&mdash;a man of rather more than middle height but
  bowed, with silvery hair and a little patch of white whiskers. The rest of
  his face was clean-shaven, still hard and brown as in his youth, and his eyes
  were like steel.</p>

  <p>"No," he answered, "I am not glad. Since you are here, though, take this
  chair. I will fetch another while I hear what you have to say."</p>

  <p>"Shall we go inside?" she suggested.</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Your mother lived and died there," he reminded her.</p>

  <p>Marcia set her teeth.</p>

  <p>"I suppose she walked in the garden sometimes," she said resentfully.</p>

  <p>"The garden is different," he declared. "The earth changes from generation
  to generation, just as the flowers here throw out fresh blossoms and the
  weeds come and go. But my rooftree stands where it always did. Wait."</p>

  <p>He disappeared into the house and returned in a few moments with a chair
  which he placed a few feet away from Marcia. Then he sat and looked at her
  steadily.</p>

  <p>"So you are Marcia," he said. "You've grown well-looking."</p>

  <p>"Marcia&mdash;your daughter," she reminded him gently. "Are you going to
  forget that altogether?"</p>

  <p>"Not," he replied, "if you are in need of succour or help, but I judge
  from your appearance that you need neither. You are flesh of my flesh, as I
  well know."</p>

  <p>"I want nothing from you, father, except a little kindness," she
  pleaded.</p>

  <p>His hands trembled.</p>

  <p>"Kindness," he repeated. "That's strange hearing. You are without friends,
  perhaps? You made some, maybe, and they heard of your disgrace, and they've
  cast you off?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No, it isn't that at all. I have many friends, and they most of them know
  my history."</p>

  <p>"Friends of your own sort, then!"</p>

  <p>Marcia moved uneasily in her chair.</p>

  <p>"Father," she said gently, "don't you sometimes think that your views of
  life are a little narrow? I am very sorry indeed for what I did, inasmuch as
  it brought unhappiness to you. For the rest, I have nothing to regret."</p>

  <p>He was breathing a little harder now.</p>

  <p>"Nothing to regret?" he muttered.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," she repeated firmly. "For many years the man who took me away
  from you gave me everything I asked of him in life, everything he promised.
  He is still willing to do the same. If any change comes into our relations,
  now or in the future, it will be my doing, not his."</p>

  <p>"Meaning," he demanded, "that you've seen the wickedness of it?"</p>

  <p>"Meaning nothing of the sort," she replied. "I want you to try and
  realise, father, if you can, that I have passed into a larger world than you
  or this little village community here know very much about. I have written
  books and been praised for them by men whose praise is worth having. There
  are plenty of perfectly good and well-living people who know what I have done
  and who are glad to be my friends. There is one who wants to marry me."</p>

  <p>Richard Vont looked at her long and steadily. Marcia was, as usual,
  dressed with extreme simplicity, but her clothes were always good, and
  economy in boots and hats was a vice which she had never practised. When she
  told him that she had passed into a world apart from his, he realised it. The
  only wonder was that she had ever been his daughter!</p>

  <p>"To marry you!" he repeated. "It's one of those of your own loose way of
  thinking, eh? One of those who have forgotten the laws of God and have set up
  for themselves some graven image in which there's nought of the truth?"</p>

  <p>"The man who wishes to marry me, father," she said warmly, "is a man of
  honour and position. Can't you believe me when I assure you that there is
  another way of looking at what you consider so terrible? I have been as
  faithful to my vows as you to your marriage ones. The man whom I am told you
  still hate has never wavered in his loyalty to me, any more than I have in my
  fidelity to him. Can't you believe that to some extent, at least, we have
  sanctified our love?"</p>

  <p>James Vont passed his hand a little wearily over his forehead.</p>

  <p>"It's blasphemous gibberish that you're talking," he declared. "If you had
  come back to me, Marcia, in rags and in want, maybe there is something in my
  heart would have gone, and I'd have taken you and we'd have found a home
  somewhere far away. But to see you sitting there, soft and well-spoken,
  speaking of your success, pleased with your life, turns that very hatred you
  spoke of into fury! You and your learning and your writing of books! Why,
  you're ignorant, woman, more ignorant than the insects about you. You don't
  know right from wrong."</p>

  <p>"Father," she pleaded&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Aye, but listen," he went on. "You've children, eh?"</p>

  <p>"No," she answered softly.</p>

  <p>"No children to bear your shame, eh? And why not?"</p>

  <p>She looked for a moment into his eyes, and then away.</p>

  <p>"That may be the one weak spot," she confessed.</p>

  <p>"The one weak spot!" he repeated bitterly. "Shall I tell you what you are,
  you women who live cheerfully with the men you sell yourselves to, and defy
  the laws of God and the teaching of the Bible? You're just wastrels and
  Jezebels. Ay, and there's the garden gate, Marcia, and my heart's as hard as
  a flint, even though the tears are in your eyes and you look at me as your
  mother used to look. It's no such tears as you're shedding as'll bring you
  back into my heart. Your very prosperity's an offence. You carry the price of
  your shame on your back and in your smooth speech and in this false likeness
  of yours to the world you don't belong to. If it's duty that's brought you
  here, you'd better not have come."</p>

  <p>Marcia rose to her feet.</p>

  <p>"You're very hard, father," she said simply.</p>

  <p><a id="pic4"

  <p>"The ways of the transgressors are hard," he replied, pointing still
  towards the gate. "If you'd come here in shame and humiliation, if you'd come
  here as one as had learnt the truth, you'd have found me all that you sought.
  But you come here a very ignorant woman, Marcia, and you leave me a little
  harder than ever before, and you leave the curses that choke my throat a
  little hotter, a little more murderous."</p>

  <p>His clenched fist was pointing towards Mandeleys, his face was like
  granite. Marcia turned and left him without a word, opened the gate, walked
  across the little strip of turf, and half shrank from, half clung to the hand
  which helped her up into the car.</p>

  <p>"Get away quickly, please," she implored him. "Don't talk to me, James.
  Outside the gates as quickly as you can go!"</p>

  <p>He started his engine, and they drove off, through the lodge gates into
  the country lane, where the hedges were beautiful with fresh green foliage
  and fragrant with early honeysuckle.</p>

  <p>"To London," she begged. "Don't stop&mdash;anywhere yet."</p>

  <p>He nodded and drove a little faster, his eyes always upon the road. It was
  not until they had reached the heath country and the great open spaces around
  Newmarket that a little colour came back into her cheeks.</p>

  <p>"It wasn't a success, James," she said quietly.</p>

  <p>"I was afraid it mightn't be," he admitted.</p>

  <p>"Nothing but a Drury Lane heroine would have moved him," she went on, with
  an uneasy little laugh. "If I could have gone back in rags, in a snowstorm,
  with a child in my arms, he'd have forgiven me. As I am now, I am an offence
  to all that he holds right, and his ideas are like steel cables&mdash;you
  can't twist or bend them."</p>

  <p>Borden nodded. He relaxed his speed a little and glanced towards his
  companion.</p>

  <p>"You know what our friend said in that Russian manuscript I lent you," he
  reminded her: "'The primitive laws are for the primitive world.'"</p>

  <p>"But what do we learn, Jim?" she asked him tremulously. "What is its
  value? Is it sophistry or knowledge? I lived in that little cottage once. I
  have smiled at the memory of those days so often. I did homely tasks and
  dreamed of books and learning. To me it seems, although my fingers are
  bleeding, that I have climbed. And to him&mdash;and he looked just like
  something out of the Bible, Jim&mdash;I am nothing more&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't," he interrupted. "He is of his world and you of yours. You can't
  work out the sum you are trying to solve, there isn't any common
  denominator."</p>

  <p>"I don't know," she answered, a little pitifully. "There was a single
  second, as I saw him sitting there with his Bible on his knee and remembered
  that he was a clean, well-living, honest man, when my heart began to shake. I
  remembered that he was my father. It seems to me that it is all wrong that
  there should be any difference between us. I suddenly felt that a brain
  really didn't count for anything, after all, that all the culture in the
  world wasn't so beautiful as a single right feeling."</p>

  <p>He slackened again the speed of the car. As far as they could see was a
  great open space of moorland, with flaming bushes of yellow gorse, little
  clumps of early heather, and, in the distance, a streak of blue from the
  undergrowth of a long belt of firs. She looked about her for a moment and
  closed her eyes.</p>

  <p>"There," he said, "is one of the simplest phases of beauty, the world has
  ever given us&mdash;flowers and trees, an open space and a west wind. There
  isn't any one who can look at these things and be happy who isn't somewhere
  near the right path, Marcia."</p>

  <p>She leaned back, her eyes fixed dreamily upon the blue distance.</p>

  <p>"Just drive on, please, Jim," she begged.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

  <p>David ate his three cutlets and, both as regards appetite and in other
  ways, was a great success at the little luncheon party. Afterwards, they
  finished the bottle of Marsala under a cedar tree, and whilst the Colonel
  indulged in reminiscences, Sylvia's eyes rested more than once upon the
  automobile drawn up before the door. It was quite an adventure in her rather
  humdrum life, and, after all, there was no reason why a fairy prince
  shouldn't be an American millionaire and come in a Rolls-Royce.</p>

  <p>"I am sure I hope you'll like Broomleys, Mr. Thain," the Colonel said, as
  David rose to make his adieux. "I am delighted to leave the place in the
  hands of such a good tenant. It makes one almost sorry to go away when one
  realises what one is missing in the shape of neighbours, eh, Sylvia?"</p>

  <p>Sylvia was unaccountably shy, but she raised her eyes to David's for a
  moment.</p>

  <p>"It is most disappointing," she agreed. "Mr. Thain is such a sympathetic
  shopper."</p>

  <p>David drove off a little gloomily.</p>

  <p>"Why the devil couldn't I fall in love with a nice girl like that," he
  muttered to himself, "instead of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He pulled up short, set his heel upon that other vision, and braced
  himself for the immediate task before him. He drove around the park, drew up
  outside the cottage, and, descending from the car, approached the low hedge.
  At the further end of the garden he could hear his uncle's sonorous voice. He
  was seated in a high-backed chair, the Bible upon his knee, reading to
  himself slowly and with great distinctness the Ten Commandments. On the
  ground by his side were the remnants of another chair. As David came up the
  little path, his uncle concluded his reading and laid down the Bible.</p>

  <p>"Bring out a chair and sit with me, David," he invited.</p>

  <p>David pointed to the ground.</p>

  <p>"Your furniture seems&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't jest," his uncle interrupted. "That chair I have broken to pieces
  with my own hands because of the woman who sat upon it not many hours
  since."</p>

  <p>David frowned.</p>

  <p>"You mean Marcia?"</p>

  <p>"I mean Marcia&mdash;the woman who was my daughter," was the stern reply,
  "the woman of whose visit you warned me."</p>

  <p>"Come into the house with me," David begged, turning his back upon
  Mandeleys. "You sit and look at that great drear building and brood overmuch.
  I want to talk with you."</p>

  <p>Richard Vont rose obediently to his feet and followed his visitor into the
  little parlour. David looked around him curiously.</p>

  <p>"This place seems to have the flavour of many years ago," he said.
  "Sometimes I can scarcely realise that I have ever eaten my meals off that
  oak table. Sometimes it seems like yesterday."</p>

  <p>"Time passes, but time don't count for much," the old man sighed. "Mary
  Wells will be up from the village soon, and she'll make us a cup of tea. Sit
  opposite me, lad. Is there any more news?"</p>

  <p>"None!"</p>

  <p>"Them shares, for instance?"</p>

  <p>"There will be no change in them," David replied. "In two months' time he
  will know it."</p>

  <p>"And he'll have forty thousand pounds to find, eh?&mdash;forty thousand
  pounds which he will never be able to raise!" Richard Vont muttered, his eyes
  curiously bright. "There isn't an acre of land here that isn't mortgaged over
  and over again."</p>

  <p>"You'll make him a bankrupt, I suppose," David said thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Ay, a bankrupt!" his uncle repeated, lingering over the word with a
  fierce joy. "But there's something more as'll fall to your lot, David," he
  went on,&mdash;"something more&mdash;and the time's none so far off."</p>

  <p>David moved in his chair uneasily.</p>

  <p>"Something more?"</p>

  <p>"Ay, ay!" the old man assented. "You'll find it hard, my boy, but you'll
  keep your word. You've got that much of the Vonts in your blood. Your word's
  a bond with you."</p>

  <p>"Tell me," David begged, "about that something more?"</p>

  <p>"The time's not yet," his uncle replied. "You shall know, lad, in good
  season."</p>

  <p>David was silent for a moment, filled with nameless and displeasing
  apprehensions. He was brave enough, prepared to meet any ordinary emergency,
  but somehow or other the vagueness of the task which lay before him seemed
  appalling. Outside was Mandeleys, a grim and silent remembrance. Inside the
  cottage everything seemed to speak of changeless times. The pendulum of the
  tall clock swung drowsily, as it had swung thirty years ago. The pictures on
  the wall were the same, the china, the furniture, even its arrangement. And
  the man who sat in his easy-chair was the same, only that his whiskers and
  hair were white where once they had been black.</p>

  <p>"Uncle," he begged, "let me know the worst now?"</p>

  <p>"You'll know in good time and not before," was the almost fierce reply.
  "Don't weary me to-night, lad," Vent continued, his voice breaking a little.
  "The day has been full of trials for me. 'Twas no light matter to have a
  strange woman here&mdash;the strange woman, David, that was once my
  daughter."</p>

  <p>David frowned a little.</p>

  <p>"Uncle," he said, "I don't wish to pain you, but I am sorry about
  Marcia."</p>

  <p>"You don't need to be, lad. She isn't sorry for herself. She is puffed up
  with the vanity of her brain. She came here in fine clothes and with gentle
  manners, and a new sort of voice. She has made herself&mdash;a lady! Poor
  lass, her day of suffering is to come! Maybe I was hard on her, but I
  couldn't bear the sight of her, and that's the truth. She talked to me like
  one filled with wisdom. It was me whom she thought the ignorant one. Put
  Marcia out of your mind, David. We will talk of other things."</p>

  <p>David leaned forward in his chair. His eyes were bright, his tone
  eager.</p>

  <p>"Let us have this out, uncle," he begged. "I've been thinking of
  it&mdash;perhaps as much as you lately. They may have been wrong, those two;
  they may be sinners, but, after all, the world isn't a place for holy people
  only. The Bible tells you that. For nearly twenty years he has stood by her
  and cared for her. There has been no meanness, no backing out on his part. He
  is as much to her to-day as ever he was."</p>

  <p>"Ay," his listener interposed scornfully, "she talked that way. Do you
  reckon that a man and woman who sinned a score of years ago are any the
  better because they are going on sinning to-day? Faithfulness to good is part
  of the Word of God. Faithfulness in sin is of the Devil's handing out."</p>

  <p>David shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry, uncle," he said earnestly, "I have come to look on these
  things a little differently. Many years ago, in America, I used to wonder
  what it was that kept you apart from every one else, kept the smile from your
  lips, made you accept good fortune or ill without any sign of feeling. I was
  too young to understand then, but I realise everything now. I know how you
  denied yourself to send me to school and college. I know how you left
  yourself almost a beggar when you gave me the chance of my life and trusted
  me with all your savings. These things I shall never forget."</p>

  <p>"One word, lad," Vont interrupted. "It's the truth you say. I trusted you
  with well-nigh all I had that stood between me and starvation, but I trusted
  you with it on one condition. Do you mind that condition? We sat outside the
  little shanty I'd built with my own hands, up in the Adirondacks there, and
  before us were the mountains and the woods and the silence. We were close to
  God up there, David. You remember?"</p>

  <p>"I remember."</p>

  <p>"You'd come hot-foot from the city, and you told me your story. I sat and
  listened, and then I told you mine. I told you of the shame that had driven
  me from England, and I told you of the thoughts that were simmering in my
  mind. As we sat there your wrath was as mine, and the oath which I had sworn,
  you swore, too. I lent you the money over that oath, boy. Look back, if you
  will. You remember the night? There was a hot wind&mdash;cool before it
  reached us, though&mdash;rushing up from the earth, rushing through the pine
  trees till they shook and bowed around us; and a moon, with the black clouds
  being driven across it, looking down; and the smell of the pines. You
  remember?"</p>

  <p>"I remember," David repeated.</p>

  <p>"We stood there hand in hand, and there was no one to hear us except those
  voices that come from God only knows where, and you swore on your soul that
  you would help me as soon as the time came to punish the man who had blasted
  my life. In my way you promised&mdash;not yours. There should be no will but
  mine. For this one thing I was master and you were slave, and you swore."</p>

  <p>"I swore. I am not denying it," David acknowledged. "Haven't I made a
  start? Haven't I deceived the man at whose table I sat and laid a plot to
  ruin him? And I have ruined him! Do you want more than this?"</p>

  <p>"Yes!" was the unshaken reply.</p>

  <p>"Then what, in heaven's name, is it?" David demanded. "Out with it, for
  God's sake! I carry this whole thing about with me, like a weight upon my
  soul. Granted that you are master and I am slave. Well, I've done much. What
  is there left?"</p>

  <p>"That you will be told in due season."</p>

  <p>"And meantime," David continued passionately, "I am to live in a sort of
  prison!"</p>

  <p>"You've no need to find it such," the old man declared doggedly.</p>

  <p>David sprang to his feet. The time had come for his appeal. The words
  seemed to rush to his lips. He was full of confidence and hope.</p>

  <p>"Uncle," he began, "you must never let a single word that I may say seem
  to you ungrateful, but I beseech you to listen to me. Life is like a great
  city in which there are many thoroughfares. It is an immense, insoluble
  problem which no one can understand. You never open another book except your
  Bible. You have never willingly exchanged speech with any human being since
  you left here. In America you shunned all company, you lived in the gloomiest
  of solitudes. This little corner of the earth is all you know of. Perhaps
  there is more in life even than that Book can teach you."</p>

  <p>"Marcia talked like this," Richard Vont said quietly. "She spoke of
  another world, a world for cleverer folk than I. Are you going to try and
  break my purpose, too?"</p>

  <p>"I would if I could," David declared fervently. "This man is what his
  ancestors and his education have made him. He has led a simple, ignorant, and
  yet in some respects a decent life. He is too narrow to understand any one's
  point of view except his own. When he took Marcia away, she was the village
  girl and he the great nobleman. To-day Marcia holds his future in her hands.
  She is the strong woman, and he is the weak man. She has achieved fame and
  made friends. She has lived a happy life, she is at the present moment
  perfectly content. Every promise he made her he has kept. Well, why not let
  it go at that?"</p>

  <p>"So you are another poor child who knows all about this wonderful world of
  which I am so ignorant," Richard Vont said bitterly. "Yet, my lad, I tell you
  that there's one great truth that none of you can get over, and that is that
  sin lives, and there is nothing in this world, save atonement, can wash it
  out."</p>

  <p>"There's a newer doctrine than that, uncle," David insisted. "You talk
  with the voice of the black-frocked minister who dangles Hell in front of his
  congregation. There is something else can clear away sin, and the Book over
  which you pore, day by day, will teach it you, if you know where to look for
  it. There's love."</p>

  <p>"Was it love, then, that brought him down through the darkness to
  dishonour my daughter?" Vont demanded, with blazing eyes.</p>

  <p>"It didn't seem like it, but love must have been there," David answered.
  "Nothing but love could have kept these two people together all this time,
  each filling a great place in the other's life. I haven't thought of these
  things much, uncle, but I tell you frankly, I've read the Bible as well as
  you, and I don't believe in this black ogre of unforgivable sin. If these two
  started in wrong fashion, they've purified themselves. I hold that it's your
  duty now to leave them alone. I say that this vengeance you still hanker
  after is the eye for an eye and limb for a limb of the Old Testament. There
  has been a greater light in the world since then."</p>

  <p>"Have you done?" Vont asked, without the slightest change in his tone or
  expression.</p>

  <p>"I suppose so," David replied wearily. "I wish you'd think over it all,
  uncle. I know I'm right. I know there is justice in my point of view."</p>

  <p>"I'll not argue with you, lad," his uncle declared. "I'll ask you no'but
  this one question, and before you answer it just go back in your mind to the
  night we stood outside my shack, when the wind was blowing up from the
  valleys. Are you going to stand by your pledged word or are you going to play
  me false?"</p>

  <p>The great clock ticked drearily on. From outside came the clatter of
  teacups. David walked to the latticed window and came back again. Richard
  Vont was seated in his high-backed chair, his hands grasping its sides. His
  mouth was as hard and tightly drawn as one of his own vermin traps, but his
  eyes, steadfastly fixed upon his nephew, were filled with an inscrutable
  pathos. David remembered that passionate outburst of feeling on a far-distant
  night, when the tears had rolled down this man's cheeks and his voice was
  choked with sobs. And he remembered&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I shall keep my word in every way," he promised solemnly.</p>

  <p>Vont rose slowly to his feet. His knees were trembling. He seemed to be
  looking into a mist. His hands shook as he laid them on David's
  shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Thank God!" he muttered. "David, boy, remember. This light talk is like
  an April shower on the warm earth. Goodness and sin are the same now as a
  thousand years ago, and they will be the same in a thousand years to come. We
  may pipe a new tune, but it's only the Devil's children that dance to
  it&mdash;sin must be punished. There's no getting over that! Forgiveness
  later maybe&mdash;but first comes punishment."</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

  <p>A queer atmosphere of depression seemed about this time to have affected
  the two inhabitants of Number 94 Grosvenor Square. The Marquis had suddenly
  become aware of an aimlessness in life which not even his new financial hopes
  enabled him to combat. The night of his weekly dinner at Trewly's he spent in
  the entertainment of three ancient whist companions, and it was not until
  they had gone and he was left alone in the silent house that he realised how
  empty and profitless the evening had been. Day by day, after lunch, he sent
  out the same message to his chauffeur&mdash;five o'clock for the club instead
  of three o'clock for Battersea, and on each occasion the words seemed to
  leave his lips with more reluctance. He walked each morning in the Park, as
  carefully dressed and as upright as ever, but one or two of his acquaintances
  noticed a certain difference. There was an increased pallor, a listlessness
  of gait, which seemed to bespeak an absent or a preoccupied mind. He even
  welcomed the coming, one morning just as he was starting for his promenade,
  of Mr. Wadham, Junior. Here at least was diversion.</p>

  <p>Mr. Wadham, Junior, had been rehearsing his interview and his prospective
  deportment towards the Marquis on the way up, and he started the enterprise
  to his own entire satisfaction. He entered the library with an exceedingly
  serious air, and he took great pains to be sure that the door was closed
  after the retreating butler before he did more than respond to his
  distinguished client's greeting.</p>

  <p>"Anything fresh, Wadham?" the latter enquired.</p>

  <p>"I have ventured to see your lordship once more," Mr. Wadham began, "with
  reference to the scrip which we deposited at the bank to meet certain
  liabilities on your behalf."</p>

  <p>"Well, what about it?" the Marquis asked good-humouredly. "You lawyers
  know nothing of the Stock Exchange."</p>

  <p>Mr. Wadham assumed an expression of great gravity.</p>

  <p>"Would your lordship," he begged, "for the satisfaction of my firm, the
  members of which I think you will admit have always been devoted to your
  lordship's interests, ring up the stockbroking firm
  of&mdash;say&mdash;Messrs. Youngs, Fielden and Company, or any other you
  like, with reference to the value of those shares?"</p>

  <p>"I am, unfortunately," the Marquis replied, "not in a position to do so.
  The shares were sold me by a personal friend. I am content to believe that if
  they had not been of their face value, the transaction would not have been
  suggested to me."</p>

  <p>"That," Mr. Wadham declared seriously, "is not business."</p>

  <p>"It happens to be the only way in which I can look upon the matter," was
  the cool reply.</p>

  <p>"To proceed a little further," the lawyer continued, "I am here to
  enquire, solely in your own interests and as a matter of business, whether
  you have made any definite agreement to pay for these shares? I am under the
  impression that your lordship mentioned a note of hand."</p>

  <p>"I have signed," the Marquis acknowledged, "a bill, I believe the document
  was called, for forty thousand pounds, due in about two months' time."</p>

  <p>"Has your lordship any idea as to how this liability is to be met?"</p>

  <p>"None at all. It is possible that the shares will have advanced in value
  sufficiently to justify my selling them. If not, I take it that the bank will
  advance the sum against the scrip."</p>

  <p>Mr. Wadham, Junior, could scarcely contain himself.</p>

  <p>"Does your lordship know," he exclaimed, "that the bank hesitated about
  advancing a sum of less than a thousand pounds upon the security of those
  shares?"</p>

  <p>The Marquis yawned.</p>

  <p>"They will probably have changed their minds in two months' time," he
  remarked.</p>

  <p>"But if they have not?" Mr. Wadham persisted.</p>

  <p>"It is the unfortunate proclivity of you who are immersed in the narrow
  ways of legal procedure," his client observed, "to look only upon the worst
  side of a matter. Personally, I am an optimist. I rather expect to make a
  fortune on those shares."</p>

  <p>"It is the belief of my firm, on the contrary," Mr. Wadham confessed
  gloomily, "that they will end in a petition in bankruptcy being presented
  against your lordship."</p>

  <p>The Marquis shook out his handkerchief, wiped his lips and lit a
  cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Yours appears to be rather a dismal errand, Mr. Wadham," he said coldly.
  "Is there any reason why I should detain you further?"</p>

  <p>"None whatever, so long as I have made it quite clear that there is no
  prospect of raising a single half-penny in excess of the mortgages already
  completed. The matter of the forty thousand pounds draft is, of course,
  entirely in your lordship's hands. I thought it my duty to inform you as to
  the value of the shares, in case you were able to persuade the gentleman who
  sold them to you to cancel the transaction."</p>

  <p>"You mean well, Wadham, no doubt," the Marquis declared, a little
  patronisingly, "but, as I said before, your turn of mind is too legal. My
  respects to your father. You will forgive my ringing, will you not? Lady
  Letitia is waiting for me to walk with her."</p>

  <p>Mr. Wadham departed, saying blasphemous things all the way into
  Piccadilly, and the Marquis walked with Lady Letitia in the Park. As a rule
  their conversation, although mostly of personal matters, was conducted in
  light-hearted fashion enough by Letitia, and responded to with a certain dry
  though stately humour by her father. This morning, however, a silence which
  amounted almost to constraint reigned between them. The Marquis, realising
  this, finally dragged his thoughts with difficulty away from his own
  affairs.</p>

  <p>"I had intended to speak to you, Letitia," he began, "concerning the
  announcement of your marriage. Some festivities must naturally follow, and a
  meeting between myself and the Duke."</p>

  <p>"Whom you hate like poison, don't you, dad!" Letitia said, with a little
  grimace. "Well, so do I, for the matter of that."</p>

  <p>"One's personal feelings are scarcely of account in such a case," the
  Marquis averred; "that is to say, any personal feelings with the exception of
  yours and Grantham's. The match is suitable in every way, and at a time when
  every young man of account is being chased by a new race of ineligible young
  women, it must be a comfort to his family to contemplate an alliance like
  this."</p>

  <p>Letitia shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"With regard to the actual announcement, dad," she said, "we are going to
  keep it to ourselves for a few weeks longer, or at any rate until we are
  safely settled in the country. It's such a bore to have every one you have
  ever spoken to in your life come rushing round to wish you happiness and that
  sort of thing. Charlie rather agrees with me."</p>

  <p>"The matter, naturally, is in your hands," the Marquis replied, with a
  slight air of relief.</p>

  <p>"Of course, I am seeing rather more of Charlie," Letitia went on, "but
  people won't take any notice of that. There have been rumours of our
  engagement at least half a dozen times already. Aren't you getting just a
  little sick, dad, of this everlasting walk and these everlasting people we
  keep on bowing to and wish we didn't know?"</p>

  <p>"I hadn't thought of it exactly in that way," her father confessed, "and
  yet perhaps London is a little wearisome this season."</p>

  <p>"I think," Letitia sighed, "that I never felt so keen about leaving town
  and getting into the country. I suppose you wouldn't care to go down to
  Mandeleys a week earlier, would you?" she asked tentatively.</p>

  <p>The Marquis looked upwards towards the tops of the trees. He thought of
  that particular spot on the hall table where notes were left for him, of the
  old-fashioned silver salver laid by his side on the breakfast table, upon
  which his letters were placed. He thought of the queer new feeling with
  which, day by day, he glanced them through, opening none, searching always,
  covering his disappointment by means of some ingenious remark; and of the
  days when he returned from such a walk as this, or from the club, his eyes
  glued upon the sideboard even while the butler was relieving him of his coat
  and gloves. This morning all the accumulated sickness, all the little throbs
  of disappointment, seemed to be lumped into one gigantic and intolerable
  depression, so that his knees even trembled a little while he walked, and his
  feet felt as though they were shod with lead. He remembered his sleepless
  nights. He thought of that dull ache which came to him sometimes in the still
  hours, when he lay and fancied that he could hear her voice, her cheerful
  laugh, the tender touch of her fingers. He felt a sudden, overmastering
  desire to be free, at any rate, from that minute by minute agony. At
  Mandeleys there would be only the post. Or perhaps, if he made up his mind to
  leave town earlier than he had expected, he would not be breaking his word to
  himself if he sent just a line to tell her of his changed plans. The country,
  by all means!</p>

  <p>"So far as I am concerned, Letitia," he said, "I think that I have never
  before felt so strongly the desire to leave London. I suppose that, if we
  were content to take things quietly, we could collect a few servants and be
  comfortable there?"</p>

  <p>"I am sure of it, dad!" she exclaimed eagerly. "You don't need to bother.
  I could arrange it all," she went on, passing her arm through his. "Four or
  five women will be all that we need, and Mrs. Harris can collect those in the
  village. Then we need only take Gossett and Smith from here, and of course
  cook. The others can go on to board wages."</p>

  <p>The Marquis smiled indulgently.</p>

  <p>"You must not disperse the establishment too completely, my dear," he
  said. "I have great hopes that a certain business venture which I have made
  will place us in a very different financial position before very long."</p>

  <p>She looked a little dubious.</p>

  <p>"Was that what Mr. Wadham was worrying about this morning?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Wadham, Junior, is a most ignorant young man," her father proclaimed
  stiffly. "The venture, such as it is, is one which I have made entirely on my
  own responsibility."</p>

  <p>A sudden thought struck her. Her arm tightened upon her father's.</p>

  <p>"Has it anything to do with Mr. Thain?"</p>

  <p>"It was Mr. Thain who placed the matter before me," he assented.</p>

  <p>"And Mr. Wadham doesn't approve?"</p>

  <p>"You really are a most intelligent young person," her father declared,
  smiling. "Mr. Wadham's disapproval, however, does not disturb me."</p>

  <p>Letitia was conscious of a curious uneasiness.</p>

  <p>"Are you quite sure that Mr. Thain is an honest man, father?" she
  asked.</p>

  <p>The Marquis's eyebrows were slightly elevated.</p>

  <p>"My dear!" he said reprovingly. "Mr. Thain's position as a financier is, I
  believe, beyond all question. Your aunt, who, you will remember, first
  brought him to us, spoke of his reputation in the States as being entirely
  unexceptionable."</p>

  <p>"After all, aunt only met him on the steamer," Letitia observed.</p>

  <p>"Consider further," the Marquis continued, "that he has taken Broomleys
  and will therefore be a neighbour of ours for some time. Do you think that he
  would have done this with the knowledge in his mind he had involved me in a
  transaction which was destined to have an unfortunate conclusion?"</p>

  <p>Letitia was silent. Her fine forehead was clouded by a little perplexed
  frown. The problem of David Thain was not so easily solved. Then the Duchess
  called to them from her car and beckoned Letitia to her side.</p>

  <p>"I have heard rumours, Letitia," she whispered.</p>

  <p>Letitia nodded.</p>

  <p>"I was coming round to see you, aunt," she replied. "We are not going to
  announce it until a little later on."</p>

  <p>The Duchess smiled her approbation.</p>

  <p>"I am delighted," she declared. "You are so difficult, Letitia, and there
  are so many girls about just now, trying to get hold of our young men. Some
  one was telling me only last night of an American girl&mdash;or was she South
  American; I don't remember&mdash;with millions and millions, who almost
  followed Charlie about. Of course, that sort of thing is being done, but it
  hasn't happened in our family yet. Dear people, both of you! When are you
  going to Mandeleys?"</p>

  <p>"We have just decided," the Marquis told her, "to shorten our stay in
  London. Letitia's engagements are capable of curtailment, and my own are of
  no account. We are thinking of going at once."</p>

  <p>"And your neighbour," the Duchess enquired; "when is he going into
  residence?"</p>

  <p>"I have not heard."</p>

  <p>"I am expecting him to come to Scotland later on," she observed.</p>

  <p>The Marquis was gently surprised.</p>

  <p>"Won't he be just a little&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not at all," the Duchess interrupted. "He shoots and fishes, and does
  everything other men do. I am not quite sure," she went on, "that you
  thoroughly appreciate Mr. Thain."</p>

  <p>"My dear Caroline, you are entirely mistaken," the Marquis assured her.
  "What Letitia's sentiments with regard to him may be, I do not know, but so
  far as I am concerned, I consider him a most desirable acquisition to my
  acquaintances."</p>

  <p>"If only I had your manner!" she said earnestly. "Poor Mr. Thain!"</p>

  <p>With a little nod she drove off. The Marquis and Letitia continued their
  promenade.</p>

  <p>"Why 'Poor Mr. Thain'?" the former mused. "Exactly what did Caroline mean,
  I wonder?"</p>

  <p>"I think," Letitia replied, "that she was emphasising the distinction
  between your acceptance of Mr. Thain and hers."</p>

  <p>Her father remained puzzled.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Thain has been a guest at my house," he said, "and we shall treat him
  as a neighbour when we meet at Mandeleys."</p>

  <p>"Those things are indications of a friendly feeling," Letitia observed,
  "but you yourself know where you have placed the barriers. Now Aunt Caroline
  doesn't mean to have any barriers. If Mr. Thain can be awakened to his great
  opportunities, it is perfectly clear that she means to enter upon a
  flirtation with him."</p>

  <p>The Marquis was a little shocked.</p>

  <p>"You are somewhat blunt, my dear," he said. "So far as your Aunt Caroline
  is concerned, too, I fear that she has in a measure lost that fine
  edge&mdash;perhaps I should say that very delicate perception of the
  differences which undoubtedly do exist. I am pointing this out to you,
  Letitia," he continued, as they left the Park, "but it occurs to me that my
  doing so is unnecessary. I have noticed that since your entrance into
  Society, some four or five years ago, you have identified yourself entirely
  with my views. Nothing could have been more discriminating than your
  treatment of the various excellent people with whom you have been brought
  into contact."</p>

  <p>Letitia did not speak for a moment. Then she turned to her father with a
  little sigh.</p>

  <p>"An inherited weakness, I suppose," she murmured. "I sometimes rather envy
  other people their standpoint."</p>

  <p>The Marquis made no reply. They were nearing Number 94, and he was
  conscious of that slight, nervous expectancy which required always a firm
  hand. The door was opened before they could ring. The young man who served
  under Gossett was already relieving him of his hat and gloves. With a
  perfectly leisurely step, the Marquis advanced towards the hall table. He
  glanced at the superscription of two or three notes, dropped his eyeglass,
  and turned away towards his study&mdash;empty-handed.</p>

  <p>"Several notes for you, Letitia," he said, without looking around.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

  <p>Richard Vont, a few mornings later, leaned upon his spade and gazed over
  towards Mandeleys with set, fixed eyes. His clothes and hands were stained
  with clay, the sweat was pouring down his face, he was breathing heavily like
  a man who has been engaged in strenuous labour. But of his exhausted
  condition he seemed to take no count. There was something new at the Abbey,
  something which spoke to him intimately, which was crowding his somewhat
  turgid brain with the one great imagining of his life. For Mandeleys had
  opened its eyes. A hundred blinds had been raised, long rows of windows stood
  open. Men were at work, weeding the avenue, and driving mowing machines
  across the lawns which stretched down to the ring fence and the moat. Flaming
  borders of yellow crocuses became miraculously visible as the dank grass
  disappeared, and many spiral wreaths of smoke were ascending into the misty
  stillness of the spring morning. Away behind, in the high-walled garden, were
  more gardeners, bending at their toil. Richard Vont was no reader of the
  <i>Morning Post</i>, but an item in its fashionable intelligence of that
  morning lay clearly written before him. The Marquis was coming back!</p>

  <p>Vont turned slowly away, left his spade in the tool shed, entered the
  cottage by the back door, carefully changed his clothes, washed the clay from
  his face and hands, and descended into the sitting room, where his breakfast
  awaited him. Mrs. Wells looked at him curiously. She was a distant connection
  and stood upon no ceremony with him.</p>

  <p>"Richard," she demanded, "where were you when I come this morning?"</p>

  <p>"Sleeping, maybe," he answered, taking his place at the table.</p>

  <p>"And that you weren't," she contradicted, "for I made bold to knock at
  your door to ask if you'd like a rasher of bacon with your eggs."</p>

  <p>He raised his head and looked at her steadily.</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not one to pry into other people's affairs," she continued, "but your
  goings on are more than I can understand. All day long you sit with the Book
  upon your knee, and if a neighbour asks why you never pass the gate, or
  seemingly move a limb, it's the rheumatics you speak of. And yet last night
  your bed was never slept in, my man, and I begin to suspect other nights as
  well. What's it mean, eh?"</p>

  <p>Richard Vont rose to his feet and opened the door.</p>

  <p>"Just that," he answered harshly, pointing to it. "I'll not be spied on.
  Inch for inch and yard for yard, this cottage and garden are mine, I tell
  you&mdash;mine with dishonour, maybe, but mine. I'll have none around me that
  watches and frets because of the things that I choose to do. I'll lie out in
  the garden at nights, if I will, and not account to you, Mary Wells; or sleep
  on the floor, if it pleases me, and it's no concern of any one but mine. So
  back to the village gossips, if you will, and spread your tale. Maybe I'm a
  midnight robber and roam the countryside at night. It's my affair."</p>

  <p>"A robber you're not, Richard Vont," was the somewhat dazed reply, "and
  that the world knows. And there's summut more that the world knows, too, and
  that is that since you came back from Americy, never have you set foot
  outside that gate. There's friends waiting for you at the village, and
  there's them as smokes their pipe at night in the alehouse, whose company 'd
  do you no harm, but for some reason of your own you live like a hermit. And
  yet&mdash;yet&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Go on, Mary," he said sturdily. "Finish it."</p>

  <p>"It's the nights that are baffling," Mrs. Wells declared. "There's some of
  your clothes in the morning wrings with sweat. There's sometimes the look in
  your face at breakfast time as though you'd had a hard day's work and done
  more than was good for your strength."</p>

  <p>"I'm no sleeper," he declared, "no sleeper at all. If I choose to walk in
  the garden, what business is it of yours, Mary, or of any one down in th'
  village? Answer me that, woman?"</p>

  <p>"Every man, I suppose, may please himself," she conceded grudgingly, "but
  I don't hold with mysteries myself."</p>

  <p>"Then you full well know," he replied, "how to escape from them. If
  they're too much for you, Mary, I've fended for myself before, and I can do
  it again."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Wells snorted.</p>

  <p>"Keep your own counsel, then, Richard."</p>

  <p>"And you keep yours," he advised. "You're my nearest of kin, Mary, though
  you're but my cousin's widdy. If you can learn to keep a still tongue in your
  head and do what's asked of you, there may be a trifle coming to you when my
  time comes. But if you get these curious fits on you, and they're more than
  you can stand; if you're going bleating from house to house in the village,
  and spending your time in tittle-tattling, then we'll part. Them's plain
  words, anyhow."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Wells became almost abject.</p>

  <p>"You've said the word, Richard, and I'll bide by it," she declared. "You
  can run races with yourself round the garden all night long, if you've a
  will. I'll close my eyes from now. But," she added, as a parting shot, "that
  clay on your old clothes takes a sight of getting off."</p>

  <p>Richard Vont ate his breakfast slowly and thoughtfully, entirely with the
  air of a man who accomplishes a duty. Afterwards, with the Bible under his
  arm, he took his accustomed seat at the end of the garden facing Mandeleys.
  There were tradesmen's carts and motor-vans passing occasionally on their way
  to and from the house, but he saw none of them. He was in his place, waiting,
  watching, perhaps, but without curiosity. Presently a summons came, however,
  which he could not ignore. He turned his head. David Thain, on a great black
  horse, had come galloping across the park from Broomleys, and had brought his
  restive horse with some difficulty up to the side of the paling. The greeting
  between the two was a silent, yet, so far as Vont was concerned, an eager
  one.</p>

  <p>"You know what that means?" David observed, pointing with his crop towards
  the house.</p>

  <p>"I know well," was the swift answer. "It's what I've prayed for. Move your
  horse out of the way, boy. Can't you see I'm watching?"</p>

  <p>David looked at the old man curiously. Then he dismounted, and with his
  arm through the reins, leaned against the paling.</p>

  <p>"There's nothing to watch yet," he said, "but tradesmen's carts."</p>

  <p>"It's just the beginning," Vont muttered. "Soon there'll be servants, and
  then&mdash;him! If he comes in the night," the old man went on, his voice
  thickening, "I'll&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Words seemed to fail him, but he had clenched his hands on the cover of
  the book he had closed, and his blue veins stood out in ugly fashion. David
  sighed. Yet, notwithstanding his despair, some measure of curiosity prompted
  a question.</p>

  <p>"Just why do you want to see him so much?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Hate," was the quiet reply. "It's twenty years since, and I've a kind of
  craving to see him that much older. There's hate and love, you know, David.
  They're both writ of here. But I tell you it's hate that lasts the longest.
  Love is like my flowers. Look at them&mdash;my tall hollyhocks, my bush
  roses, my snapdragon there. They blossom and they fade, and they lie
  dead&mdash;who knows where? And in the spring they come again, or something
  like them. And hate," he went on, pointing to a spade which lay propped
  against the paling, "is like that lump of metal. It's here winter and summer
  alike. It doesn't change, it doesn't die; there's no heat would melt it. It
  was there last year, it's there to-day, it will be there to-morrow."</p>

  <p>David sighed, and looked for a moment wearily away. The old man watched
  him anxiously. Exercise had brought a slight flush to his pallid cheeks and
  an added brightness to his eyes. He sat his horse well, and his tweed
  riding-clothes were fashionably cut. His uncle's frown became deeper.</p>

  <p>"You're young, David," he said, "and I know well that you and me look out
  on life full differently. But an oath&mdash;an oath's a sacred thing,
  eh?"</p>

  <p>"An oath is a sacred thing," David repeated. "I've never denied it."</p>

  <p>"You'll not flinch, lad?" the old man persisted eagerly.</p>

  <p>"I shall not flinch."</p>

  <p>"Then ride off now. There's no gain to either of us in talking here, for
  your mind is set one way and mine another. You'll have a score of years of
  youth left after you've done my behest."</p>

  <p>David paused with his foot in the stirrup, withdrew it and returned to the
  paling.</p>

  <p>"Let me know the worst," he begged. "I've beggared your enemy for you.
  I've soiled my conscience for the first time in my life. I've lied to and
  ruined the man who trusted in my word. What is this further deed that I must
  do?"</p>

  <p>Richard Vont shook his head.</p>

  <p>"When the time comes," he promised, "you shall know. Meanwhile, let be!
  It's a summer morning, and you are but young; make the most of it. Come when
  I send for you."</p>

  <p>So David rode off, up the broad slopes of the great park, along the
  wonderful beech avenue and out on to the highway. He turned in his saddle for
  a moment and looked towards the road from London.</p>

        id="ch24"></a>

  <h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

  <p>The Marquis, with an after-breakfast cigarette in his mouth, strolled out
  of his front door, a few mornings later, to find himself face to face with
  Richard Vont. He called Letitia, who was behind.</p>

  <p>"The worst has happened," he groaned.</p>

  <p>Letitia stood by her father's side and looked across the stone flags,
  across the avenue, with its central bed of gay-coloured flowers, the ring
  fence, the moat, the few yards of park, to where, just inside his little
  enclosed garden, Richard Vont was seated, directly facing them.</p>

  <p>"Well, you expected it, didn't you, father?" she observed.</p>

  <p>"All the same," the Marquis declared, with a frown, "it's an irritating
  thing to have a man seated there within a hundred yards of your front door,
  with a Bible on his knee, cursing you. I am convinced now, more than ever,
  that my case against this man must have been grossly mismanaged. The law
  could never permit such an indignity."</p>

  <p>Letitia stepped back for a moment to light a cigarette. Then she rejoined
  her father and contemplated that somewhat grim figure critically.</p>

  <p>"If he is going to do that all the time," the Marquis went on, "I shall
  have nerves. I shall have to live in the back part of the house."</p>

  <p>Letitia gravely considered the matter.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you try talking common sense to him?" she suggested. "Perhaps a
  few words from you would make all the difference."</p>

  <p>"He is probably sitting there with a gun," her father sighed. "However,
  it's an idea, Letitia. I'll try it."</p>

  <p>He strolled across the avenue, through a little iron gate in the railings,
  and across the moat by a footbridge. When he had approached within a dozen
  paces of the palings, however, Richard Vont rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"You're nigh enough, Lord Mandeleys," he called out, "nigh enough for your
  own safety."</p>

  <p>The Marquis advanced with his usual leisurely and aristocratic walk to the
  edge of the palings. Richard Vont stood glaring at him like a wild beast, but
  there was no signs of any weapon about.</p>

  <p>"Vont," the former said, "we both have rights. This park is mine so far as
  your paling, just as your garden is yours where you are. I have no fancy for
  shouting, and I have a word to say to you."</p>

  <p>"Say it and begone, then," Vont exclaimed fiercely.</p>

  <p>"Really," the Marquis expostulated, "you are behaving in a most
  unreasonable manner. I am here to discuss the past. For any wrong which you
  may consider I have done you, I express my regret. I suggest to you that your
  daughter's present position in life should reconcile you to what has
  happened."</p>

  <p>"My daughter's brains nor your money don't make an honest woman of
  her."</p>

  <p>The Marquis sighed wearily.</p>

  <p>"Your outlook, Vont," he said, "is full of prejudice and utterly
  illogical. I found qualities in your daughter which endeared her to me, and
  she has lived a perfectly reputable and engrossing life ever since she left
  your home, such a life as she could not possibly have lived under your roof
  or in this part of the world. In every way that counts, she has prospered.
  Therefore, I ask you to reconsider the matter. I claim that any wrong I may
  have done you is expiated, and I suggest that you abandon an attitude
  which&mdash;pardon me&mdash;is just a little theatrical, put aside that very
  excellent Book or else read it as a whole, and give me your hand."</p>

  <p>"I'd cut it off first," Vont declared savagely.</p>

  <p>"This is rank prejudice," the Marquis protested.</p>

  <p>"It seems so to you, belike," was the scornful answer. "You clever folk
  who can crowd your brain with thoughts and ideas from books&mdash;you've no
  room there for the big things. You've so many little weeds growing up around
  that the flower doesn't count. Nought that you can say about Marcia can alter
  matters. I'd sooner have seen her married to the poorest creature on your
  land than to know that she has lived as your dependent for all these
  years."</p>

  <p>The Marquis shook his head sorrowfully.</p>

  <p>"You're an obstinate old man, Vont," he said, "and a very selfish one. You
  are wrapped up in your own narrow ideas, and you won't even allow any one
  else to show you the truth. Marcia has been happy with me. She would have
  been the most miserable creature on earth married to a clod."</p>

  <p>"Ay, she's been here to show herself," Vont muttered, "down in a
  motor-car, in furs and silks, like a creature from some world that I know not
  about. She's talked as you've talked. I've listened to the pair of you. I
  thrust my daughter out of the garden and bade her go away and learn the
  truth. And you&mdash;well, I just take leave to say that as I cursed you nigh
  on a score of years ago, and have cursed you in my heart ever since, so I
  curse you now!"</p>

  <p>"But are you going to sit there every day doing it?" the Marquis enquired,
  a little irritably.</p>

  <p>"This house and garden are mine," Richard Vont replied stolidly, "although
  you've done your best to beggar me by taking them away. When I choose, I
  shall sit here. When I choose, I shall sit and watch you with your guests,
  watch you morning, noon and night. I've one wish in my heart, hour by hour.
  Maybe that wish will reach home, Marquis of Mandeleys. If it does, you'll see
  them all in black along the churchyard path there, and hear the doors of your
  vault roll open."</p>

  <p>"You're a little mixed in your similes, my friend," the Marquis remarked,
  "because, you know, if those things happen&mdash;to me, I shall be the one
  person who doesn't hear them. Still, I gather that you are implacable, and
  that is what I came to find out. What astonishingly fine hollyhocks!" he
  observed, as he turned away. "I must go and look at my own."</p>

  <p>For a moment there was tragedy in Vont's clenched fists and fierce,
  convulsive movement forward. The Marquis, however, without a backward glance,
  lounged carelessly away and, finding Letitia, strolled with her to the walled
  garden.</p>

  <p>"The man is impossible," he proclaimed. "It is obviously his intention to
  sit there and make himself a nuisance. Well, we get used to everything. I may
  get used to Richard Vont."</p>

  <p>Letitia hesitated for a few moments.</p>

  <p>"Father," she said, "there are certain subjects which are not, as a rule,
  mentioned, but if you will permit me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The Marquis stopped her.</p>

  <p>"My dear, please not," he begged, a little stiffly. "Remember, if you
  will, that I have little in common with the somewhat modern school of thought
  indulged in by most of your friends. There are certain subjects which cannot
  be discussed between us. Let us hear what Mr. Hales has to say."</p>

  <p>Hat in hand, the head gardener had hastened down to meet them, and under
  his tutelage they explored his domain. His master murmured little words of
  congratulation.</p>

  <p>"I have done my best, your lordship," the man observed, "but Mr. Merridrew
  has been cruel hard on me for bulbs and seeds and plants, and as to shrubs
  and young trees, he'll not have a word to say."</p>

  <p>The Marquis nodded sympathetically.</p>

  <p>"We may be able to alter that next year, Hales," he promised. "Mr.
  Merridrew, I know, has had great trouble with the tenants for the last few
  quarters. Next year, Mr. Hales, we will see what we can do."</p>

  <p>The gardener once more doffed his cap and received the intelligence with
  gratified interest. Over the top of the hill, a small governess' cart, drawn
  by a fat pony, came into sight, and Letitia waved her hand to the girl who
  was driving.</p>

  <p>"It's Sylvia Laycey," she murmured. "Now how on earth can that child still
  be at Broomleys, if Mr. Thain is really here?"</p>

  <p>Sylvia explained the matter as she drove into the great stableyard,
  Letitia walking on one side of her and the Marquis on the other.</p>

  <p>"Of course we've left Broomleys," she told them, "but we are staying with
  the Medlingcourts for three or four days. They asked us at the last moment.
  And then your letter came, Letitia&mdash;just in time. I'm simply crazy to
  come and stay with you. Letitia, you lucky girl! You are going to be here all
  the time! I am simply foolish about him!"</p>

  <p>"About whom?" Letitia asked indifferently.</p>

  <p>"Why, Mr. David Thain, of course! He's the nicest thing I've ever talked
  to. He lunched with us on Thursday&mdash;but of course you're in love with
  him, too, so there'll be no chance for me."</p>

  <p>Letitia's laugh was half amused, half scornful.</p>

  <p>"If you are in earnest, Sylvia," she said, "which doesn't seem very
  likely, I can assure you that you need fear no rival. Mr. Thain does not
  appeal to me."</p>

  <p>"We have nevertheless found Mr. Thain," the Marquis observed, suddenly
  reminding them both of his presence, "a very agreeable and interesting
  acquaintance."</p>

  <p>Sylvia made a little grimace. She thrust her arm through Letitia's and
  drew her off towards the lawn, where some chairs had been brought out under a
  cedar tree.</p>

  <p>"You are such a wonderful person, Letitia," she said, "and of course your
  father's a Marquis and mine isn't. But I thought, nowadays, Americans were
  good enough for anybody in the world, if only they had enough money."</p>

  <p>"Both my father and I, you see," Letitia observed, "are a little
  old-fashioned. I have never had any idea of marriage, except with some one
  whose family I knew all about."</p>

  <p>"Of course," Sylvia declared, "I am a horrid Radical, and I think I'd
  sooner not know about mine. If Mr. Thain's antecedents were unmentionable, I
  should adore him just the same, but, as I know your father would remind me in
  some very delicate fashion if he were here, the situation is different. You
  don't mind talking about him, do you, Letitia, because that's what I've come
  for?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll listen," Letitia promised, as she settled herself in an
  easy-chair. "I really don't know what I should find to say, except that he's
  moderately good-looking, has quite nice manners, and money enough to buy the
  whole county."</p>

  <p>"You are fearfully severe," Sylvia sighed. "Of course, I've been talking
  rot, as I always do, but we did find him charming, Letitia, both Daddy and I.
  He was so simple and unaffected, and he drove me into Fakenham and bought
  cutlets for our luncheon. When I come to think of it," she went on, with a
  look of horror in her face, "I believe he paid for them, too."</p>

  <p>"He can well afford to," Letitia laughed.</p>

  <p>The Marquis came to them across the lawn. He held in his hand an open
  telegram.</p>

  <p>"From Grantham, my dear," he said to Letitia. "It appears that he is bored
  with town and proposes to come down to-morrow night instead of waiting until
  Saturday. I have replied that he will be very welcome. Mrs. Foulds will
  really have to bestir herself. I have a line from Caroline, too, to ask if
  she may stay for a couple of days on her way to Harrogate."</p>

  <p>Letitia rose to her feet. The cloud which had fallen upon her face was
  doubtless owing to housekeeping cares. The Marquis, shading his eyes with his
  hand, was gazing across the park.</p>

  <p>"Really," he remarked, a little drily, "I shall have to hint to our new
  neighbour that turf which is several hundred years old is not meant to be cut
  up like prairie-land. He sits his horse well, though."</p>

  <p>Sylvia jumped quickly up and Letitia gazed in the direction which her
  father had indicated. David, on his black horse, was riding across the park
  towards Broomleys.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

  <p>The Marquis, as he sat at his study table after lunch, was not inclined to
  regard his first day at Mandeleys as a success. The only post of the day had
  been delivered, and the letter for which he was waiting with an anxiety
  greater than he even realised himself, was still absent. There was a letter,
  however, from Mr. Wadham, which afforded him some food for thought. It was a
  personal letter, written by the head of the firm, and he perused it for the
  second time with a frown upon his forehead.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">My dear Lord Mandeleys:</p>

  <p class="letter">I have ventured, in your interests, to do what my son tells
  me you yourself felt some hesitation in doing&mdash;namely, I have made
  enquiry through a firm of stockbrokers who make a speciality of American oil
  shares, as to the Pluto Oil Company, Limited, of whose shares you have made
  so large a purchase. I find that no development of this property has taken
  place, very little, if any, machinery has been erected, no oil has ever been
  discovered in the locality or upon the estate. May I beg of you that, to
  avoid disastrous consequences, you at once see your friend from whom you
  purchased these shares, and endeavour to make some arrangement with him to
  take them off your hands, as they were doubtless tendered to you by false
  representations.</p>

  <p class="letter">I am quite sure that I need not point out to your lordship
  that I write you this letter entirely without prejudice and in the interests
  of the Mandeleys name and estates.</p>

  <p class="letter">There could be no possibility of the drafts executed by
  your lordship being met, unless the shares themselves provided the funds,
  which, under the existing conditions, appears impossible.</p>

  <p class="letter">Respectfully yours,<br>
  <small>STEPHEN WADHAM.</small></p><br>

  <p>The Marquis looked out upon the lawn. There was in his memory, too, a
  recent and serious conversation with Mr. Merridrew, concerning the
  accumulating charges for dilapidations upon the property. He watched David
  playing croquet with Sylvia Laycey with a deepening frown upon his face,
  glanced from them to where Letitia sat, apparently absorbed in a book which
  she was reading, and from her he looked through a side window towards that
  hated little demesne across the moat, where Richard Vont, in his shabby brown
  velveteen suit, with his white hair and his motionless figure, seemed to
  dominate the otherwise peaceful prospect. Somehow or other, both outlooks
  irritated him almost as much as his own mental condition. The hard pressure
  of circumstances was asserting itself in his mind. He found himself
  struggling against an insidious longing to see Letitia in Sylvia's place. In
  his way he was superstitious. He even began to wonder whether that silent,
  ceaseless hate, that daily litany of curses, could really in any way be
  responsible for the increasing embarrassments by which he was surrounded,
  that great, dumb anxiety which kept him with wide-open eyes at night and sent
  him about in the daytime with a constant, wearing pain at his heart.</p>

  <p>He turned at last wearily away from the window, rose to his feet, opened
  the French doors which led out into the gardens, and strolled across the lawn
  to where Letitia was seated. She laid down her book and welcomed him with a
  smile which had in it just a shade of fatigue.</p>

  <p>"Our friend Thain," he observed, "seems to be a success with Miss
  Sylvia."</p>

  <p>Letitia turned her head and watched them.</p>

  <p>"Sylvia has already confided to me her ardent admiration."</p>

  <p>The Marquis sighed as he sank into a chair. Letitia glanced at him a
  little anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Anything wrong, dad?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing that should depress one on such a wonderful day. It is more a
  state of mind than anything. You and I, I fancy, were both born a few hundred
  years too late."</p>

  <p>"Money again?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"It is one of the most humiliating features of modern existence," he
  declared, "to find the course of one's daily life interfered with by the
  paltry necessities of pounds, shillings and pence. One inherits a great
  name," he went on ruminatively, "great traditions, an estate brimful of
  associations with illustrious ancestors. In one's daily life one's sense of
  dignity, one's whole position, is all the time affected, I may say poisoned,
  by the lack of that one commodity which is neither a proof of greatness or
  even deserving. We are very poor indeed, Letitia."</p>

  <p>She sighed.</p>

  <p>"Is it anything fresh?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Merridrew has been here this morning," her father continued, "and has
  spoken to me very seriously about the condition of the whole estate. No
  repairs or rebuilding have been effected for years. The whole of the rents,
  as they have been received, have been required to pay interests on the
  mortgages. Mr. Merridrew adds that he scarcely dare show himself before any
  one of the tenants, to whose just demands he is continually promising
  attention. He considers that unless the whole of the next quarter's rents are
  spent in making repairs, we shall lose our tenants and the property itself
  will be immensely deteriorated."</p>

  <p>"There are those shares that Mr. Thain sold you," she reminded him
  hopefully.</p>

  <p>"You must take this for what it is worth," he said. "I have a private
  letter from Mr. Wadham himself this morning, in which he tells me frankly
  that he has received reports indicating that those shares are worthless."</p>

  <p>"Worthless?" Letitia exclaimed, bewildered.</p>

  <p>Her father nodded.</p>

  <p>"He begs me earnestly to appeal to Mr. Thain to take them off my hands.
  Even if I could bring myself to contemplate such a step, we should even then
  be faced with the fact that, adopting Mr. Merridrew's views, there are no
  funds to provide the interest on the mortgages next quarter day."</p>

  <p>Letitia glanced once more uneasily towards David Thain.</p>

  <p>"Worthless!" she repeated. "I don't understand it, father. Do you really
  believe that Mr. Thain would do you an ill turn like this?"</p>

  <p>The Marquis shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I can conceive no possible reason for such an action," he declared. "We
  have not injured him in any way. On the contrary, we have, at your Aunt
  Caroline's solicitation, offered him a hospitality somewhat rarely accorded
  by you and me, dear, to persons of his nationality and position."</p>

  <p>Letitia made a little grimace.</p>

  <p>"Aunt Caroline looks at him from a different point of view, doesn't
  she!"</p>

  <p>"Your aunt is intensely modern," the Marquis agreed. "She is modern, too,
  without any real necessity. Her outlook upon life is one which, considering
  her descent, I cannot understand."</p>

  <p>"Don't you think, father," Letitia asked him squarely, "that, however,
  disagreeable it may be, you ought to speak to Mr. Thain about the shares? He
  could probably tell you something which would relieve your mind, or he might
  offer to take them back."</p>

  <p>The Marquis was silent for a moment. Probably no one in the world except
  Letitia knew how much it cost him to say the next few words.</p>

  <p>"I will do so," he promised. "I will find an early opportunity of doing
  so. At the same time, in the absence of any more definite information, I
  prefer to retain my belief in their value."</p>

  <p>Sylvia and David came strolling towards them. The former was looking
  almost distressed.</p>

  <p>"Letitia dear, isn't it horrid!" she said. "I must go now! I promised Mrs.
  Medlingcourt that I'd be back to tea. She has some stupid people coming in.
  We've had such a wonderful game of croquet. I am quite sure I could make an
  expert of Mr. Thain in a very short time. Can I have my pony cart, please,
  Letitia? And what time shall I come on Thursday?"</p>

  <p>"We shall be ready for you any time you like," Letitia replied, "so please
  suit yourself."</p>

  <p>They all strolled round to see her start. She looked a little wistfully at
  the vacant place in the governess' cart, as she took her seat.</p>

  <p>"I can't drop you at Broomleys gate, can I, Mr. Thain?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He shook his head smilingly.</p>

  <p>"I should never dare to face your pony again," he declared. "Bring your
  father over to see me, and we'll mark out a croquet court at Broomleys."</p>

  <p>"We'll come," she promised.</p>

  <p>She drove away. David, too, turned to take his leave.</p>

  <p>"So nice of you to entertain our little visitor," Letitia said, smiling
  graciously upon him. "She is charming, isn't she?"</p>

  <p>"Quite," he replied.</p>

  <p>"I'll show you a way into the park from the flower gardens," she
  continued. "It saves you a little."</p>

  <p>She led the way across the lawn, very erect, very graceful, very
  indifferent. David walked by her side with his hands behind him.</p>

  <p>"You must find these country pursuits a relaxation after your more
  strenuous life," she observed.</p>

  <p>"I find them very pleasant."</p>

  <p>"To-morrow," Letitia told him, "my aunt arrives for a day or two. You are
  almost as popular with her, you know, as you seem to be with Sylvia."</p>

  <p>"The Duchess," he repeated. "I did not know that she was coming here. She
  was kind enough to ask me to go to Scotland later on."</p>

  <p>"You will be very foolish if you don't go, then," Letitia advised. "The
  Rossdale grouse moors are almost the best in Scotland. Aunt Caroline is
  staying here for two days on her way to Harrogate. You must dine with us on
  Thursday night. She will be so disappointed if she does not see you at
  once."</p>

  <p>"You are very kind, Lady Letitia," he said. "I fear that I am inclined to
  encroach upon your hospitality."</p>

  <p>She picked a rose and held it to her lips for a moment.</p>

  <p>"We must amuse Aunt Caroline," she observed languidly. "It is many years
  since she imposed herself as a visitor here. We dine at a quarter past eight.
  This is the gate."</p>

  <p>He passed through it and turned to make his farewells. Her left hand was
  resting upon the iron railing, her right supported her parasol. She nodded to
  him a little curtly.</p>

  <p>"You promised," he reminded her, "that some day you would come over and
  help me about the garden."</p>

  <p>"Did I?" she answered. "Well, remind me sometime, won't you?"</p>

  <p>"Why not now?" he persisted.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I have to go and consult with Mrs. Foulds as to where to put all our
  visitors. Charlie Grantham is coming with aunt, I think, and we have so many
  rooms closed up. Don't fall into the moat. There's a bridge just to the
  left."</p>

  <p>She turned away, and David watched her for several moments before he swung
  round. He was conscious of a sudden and entirely purposeless feeling of
  anger, almost of fury. From the higher slopes of the park he turned and
  looked once more towards Mandeleys. Letitia had evidently forgotten her
  household duties. She had thrown herself back in her chair and was once more
  apparently engrossed in her book.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

  <p>David Thain, a few hours later, lounged in a basket chair in the one
  corner of his lawn from which he could catch, through the hedge of yew trees,
  a furtive glimpse of Mandeleys. By his side stood a small coffee equipage and
  an unopened box of cigars; in the distance was the vanishing figure of the
  quiet-mannered and very excellent butler with whom a famous registry office
  had endowed his household. It was an hour of supreme ease. An unusually warm
  day was succeeded by an evening from which only the warmth of the sun had
  departed, an evening full of scents from flowers and shrubs alike, an evening
  during which the thrushes prolonged their music until, from somewhere in the
  distant groves at the back of the house, a nightingale commenced, like the
  tuning up of an orchestra, to make faint but sweet essays at continued song.
  It was as light as day but there were stars already in the sky, and a pale,
  colourless moon was there, waiting for the slowly moving mantle of twilight.
  David Thain was alone with his thoughts.</p>

  <p>They had started somewhere in the background, in the first throb and
  excitement of life, in the moment when his lips had framed that horrible oath
  which held him now in its meshes. Then had come the real struggle, years of
  brilliant successes, the final coup, the stepping in a single day on to one
  of those pedestals which a great republic keeps for her most worshipped sons.
  Always it seemed to him that there was that old man in the background,
  waiting. At last had come the question. Yes, he was ready. He had come to
  England a little protesting, a little incredulous, always believing that
  those fierce fires which had burned for so long in the grey-haired, patient
  old man would have burned themselves out, or would become softened by
  sentimental associations as soon as he set foot in his native place. David's
  awakening was complete and disconcerting. The fury of Richard Vont showed no
  signs of abatement. He found himself committed already to one loathsome
  enterprise&mdash;and there was the future. He looked down gloomily at the
  magnificent pile below, with its many chimneys, its stretching front and
  far-reaching wings, and some echo of the bitterness which raged in the old
  man who sat and watched at its gates, found an echo in his own heart. He
  remembered the amusement with which that subtle but absolutely natural air of
  superiority, on the part of father and daughter alike, had first imbued him.
  Their very kindness, the frank efforts of the Marquis, as well as of Lady
  Letitia, to lead him into some channel of conversation in which he could
  easily express himself was the kindness of those belonging to another world
  and fearing lest the consciousness of it might depress their visitor. And
  with his resentment was mingled another feeling; not exactly
  acquiescence&mdash;his American education had been too strong for
  that&mdash;but admiration for those inherent gifts which seemed to bring with
  them a certain grace, carried into even the smaller matters of life. Perhaps
  he exaggerated to himself their importance as he sat there in the soft
  gathering twilight, poured out his neglected coffee and still played with his
  unlighted cigar. The rooks had ceased to caw above his head. Some of the
  peace of night was stealing down upon the land. In the windows of Mandeleys
  little pinpricks of light were beginning to show.</p>

  <p>The iron hand-gate which led from the park into his domain was suddenly
  opened and closed. The way led through a grove of trees and through another
  gate into the garden. He turned his head and watched the spot where the
  figure of his visitor must appear. It was curious that from the first,
  although his common sense should have told him how impossible such a thing
  was, he had an intuitive presentiment as to who this visitor might be. He
  laid down the unlighted cigar upon his table and leaned a little forward in
  his chair. First he heard footsteps falling softly upon a carpet of pine
  needles and yielding turf, slowly too, as though the movements of their owner
  were in a sense reluctant. And then a slim, tall figure in white&mdash;a
  familiar figure! He was up in a moment, striding forwards. She had already
  passed through the gate, however, and was moving towards him across the
  lawn.</p>

  <p>"Lady Letitia!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Please don't look as though I'd done anything so terribly unusual," she
  begged. "What a pleasant spot you have chosen for your coffee!"</p>

  <p>David's new treasure proved fully equal to the occasion. From some unseen
  point of vantage he seemed to have foretold the coming of this visitor, and
  prepared to minister to her entertainment. Lady Letitia sank into her chair
  and praised the coffee.</p>

  <p>"So much better than the stuff we have been trying to drink," she told
  David. "I must bring dad round one evening. He loves good coffee. How
  beautiful your trees are!"</p>

  <p>"Your trees," he reminded her.</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"It seems ages since I was here," she remarked. "Sylvia was away when we
  were down last, and dad and Colonel Laycey were annoyed with one another
  about some repairs. You don't want any repairs, do you, Mr. Thain?"</p>

  <p>"I have arranged to do whatever is necessary myself," David told her, "in
  consideration of a somewhat reduced rent."</p>

  <p>"I am glad you consider it reduced!" Letitia observed. "Of course, you
  think I am mad to come and see you like this, don't you?" she added a little
  aggressively.</p>

  <p>"Not in the least," he replied. "I should not have ventured to have
  expected such a visit, but now that you are here it seems quite natural."</p>

  <p>"After all, why isn't it?" she agreed. "I walked round the garden once,
  thinking about a certain matter in which you are concerned, and then I walked
  in the park, and it occurred to me that you would probably be sitting out
  here, only a few hundred yards away, just as you are doing, and that you
  could, if you would, set my mind at rest."</p>

  <p>"If I can do that," he said, "I am very glad that you came."</p>

  <p>"I am going to unburden my mind, then," she continued. "It is about those
  shares you sold father, Mr. Thain."</p>

  <p>His manner seemed, to her quick apprehension, instantly to stiffen.
  Nevertheless, he was expectant. He was willing to go through a good deal if
  only he could hear her voice for once falter, if even her tone would lose its
  half-wearied, half-insolent note, if she would raise her eyes and speak to
  him as woman to man.</p>

  <p>"The Pluto Oil shares," he murmured. "Well?"</p>

  <p>"Of course, father hadn't the least right to buy them," she went on,
  "because we haven't a penny in the world, and he couldn't possibly pay for
  them unless they fetched as much, when the payment fell due, as he gave for
  them. I am rather stupid at these things, Mr. Thain, but you understand?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly!"</p>

  <p>Her long fingers stole into the cigarette box. She accepted a light from
  him and leaned back once more in her chair.</p>

  <p>"Father," she proceeded, "has the most implicit faith in everybody. The
  fact that you are an American millionaire was ample proof to him that
  anything in the way of shares you possessed must be worth a great deal more
  than their face value. I do not know what led to his buying them&mdash;you
  probably do. Did he asked for any assurances as to their intrinsic
  value?"</p>

  <p>"I warned him," David said, "that they were entirely a speculation. He
  asked my advice as to some way of raising a large sum of money, much larger
  than he could hope to gain by any ordinary enterprise. I presumed that he was
  willing to speculate and I suggested these shares. They certainly are as
  speculative as any man could desire."</p>

  <p>"Are they worth any more now than when father bought them?" she
  enquired.</p>

  <p>"To the best of my belief they have not moved," he replied. "As a matter
  of fact, they have not yet had a chance to prove themselves."</p>

  <p>"They are still worth a dollar a share, then?"</p>

  <p>"They are worth a dollar a share as much as they were when your father
  bought them."</p>

  <p>She turned her head and looked at him.</p>

  <p>"My father," she said, "declines to ask you any questions. He would
  consider it in bad taste to suggest for a moment that he felt any uneasiness
  with regard to the necessary payment for them. He is none the less, however,
  worried. He was foolish enough to tell his lawyers about them, and lawyers, I
  am afraid, have very little faith in him as a business man. The result of the
  enquiries they made was most depressing."</p>

  <p>"It probably would be," David assented.</p>

  <p>"Forty thousand pounds' worth of shares," Letitia continued, "which are
  worth as much now as when my father bought them, are, I suppose, nothing to
  you. I wondered whether you would object to have them back again? I think
  that it would relieve my father's mind."</p>

  <p>Thain was silent for a moment. He had lit a cigar now and was smoking
  steadily.</p>

  <p>"You have not much idea of business, Lady Letitia," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"Business?" she repeated, with a note of surprise in her tone. "How should
  I have? There are certain matters of common sense and of honour which I
  suppose are common to every one of reasonable intelligence. There did not
  seem to me to be any principle of business involved in this."</p>

  <p>"Supposing," David said, "the shares had risen and were worth two dollars
  to-day, you would not in that case, I presume, have honoured me with this
  visit?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," she replied.</p>

  <p>"I did not sell those shares to your father as an act of philanthropy," he
  continued. "He asked me to show him a speculation, and I showed him this.
  Those shares, so far as I know, are as likely to be worth five times their
  value next week, or nothing at all. I am a very large holder, and it seemed
  to me that it would be a reasonable act of prudence to sell a few of them at
  a price which showed me a small margin of profit."</p>

  <p>"Profit?" she repeated wonderingly. "Are you in need of profit?"</p>

  <p>"It is the poison of wealth," he observed. "One is always trying to add to
  what one has."</p>

  <p>She turned her head and looked at him intently. For a moment she was
  almost startled. There was something unreal in the sound of his words.
  Something that was almost a foreboding chilled her.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Thain," she said calmly.</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>"Had you any reason&mdash;any special reason, I mean&mdash;for selling
  those shares to my father?"</p>

  <p>His face was inscrutable.</p>

  <p>"What reason should I have, Lady Letitia?"</p>

  <p>"I can't imagine any," she replied, "and yet&mdash;for a moment I thought
  that you were talking artificially. I probably did you an injustice. I am
  sorry."</p>

  <p>David's teeth came together. There was lightning in his eyes as he glanced
  down through the trees towards Vont's little cottage.</p>

  <p>"Don't apologise too soon, Lady Letitia," he warned her.</p>

  <p>She raised her eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"I am not accustomed to think the worst of people," she said. "I can
  scarcely picture to myself any person, already inordinately wealthy, singling
  out my father as a victim for his further cupidity. Let me return to the
  question which I have already asked you. Would you care, without letting my
  father know of this visit and my request, to return his cheque or promissory
  note, or whatever it was, in exchange for these shares?"</p>

  <p>"I am not even sure, Lady Letitia," he reminded her, after a moment's
  pause, "that your father wishes this."</p>

  <p>"You can, I think, take my word that it would be a relief to him," she
  asserted.</p>

  <p>He pondered for a few moments. The light through the trees seemed to be
  burning brighter in Vont's sitting room.</p>

  <p>"I will be frank with you, Lady Letitia," he said. "There has been no
  increase in the value of these shares. The news which I have expected
  concerning them has not arrived. The transaction, therefore, is one which at
  the present moment would probably entail a loss. Do you wish me to make your
  father a present of twenty or thirty thousand pounds?"</p>

  <p>She rose deliberately to her feet and shook the few grains of cigarette
  ash from her dress. The cigarette itself she threw into a laurel bush.</p>

  <p>"I understand," she remarked, "what you implied when you said that women
  did not understand business."</p>

  <p>Her tone was unhurried, her manner expressed no indignation. Yet as she
  strolled towards the gate, David felt the colour drained from his cheeks,
  felt the wicker sides of his chair crash in the grip of his fingers. He rose
  and hurried after her.</p>

  <p>"Lady Letitia," he began impulsively&mdash;</p>

  <p>She turned upon him as though surprised.</p>

  <p>"Pray do not trouble to escort me home," she begged.</p>

  <p>"It isn't that," he went on, falling into step by her side. "You make me
  feel like a thief."</p>

  <p>"Are you not a thief?" she asked. "I have been told that nearly all very
  rich men are thieves. I begin to understand that it may be so."</p>

  <p>"It is possible to juggle with money honestly," he assured her.</p>

  <p>"It is also possible, I suppose," she observed, with faint sarcasm, "to
  lower the standard of honesty. Thank you," she added, as she passed through
  the second gate, "you perhaps did not understand me. I should prefer to
  return alone."</p>

  <p>"I am going your way," he insisted desperately.</p>

  <p>"My way?" she repeated. "But there is nowhere to go to, unless you are
  proposing to honour us with a call at Mandeleys."</p>

  <p>"I am going in to see old Richard Vont," he said.</p>

  <p>She laughed in surprised fashion.</p>

  <p>"What, the old man who sits and curses us! Is he a friend of yours?"</p>

  <p>"He was on the steamer, coming home," David reminded her. "I told you so
  before. I take an interest in him."</p>

  <p>His point now was momentarily gained, and he walked unhindered by her
  side. The soft twilight had fallen around them, little wreaths of mist were
  floating across the meadows, the birds were all silent. The pathway led
  through another narrow grove of trees. As they neared the gate, Letitia
  hesitated.</p>

  <p>"I think it is just as near across the meadow," she said.</p>

  <p>He held open the gate for her.</p>

  <p>"You had better stay on the path," he advised. "The grass is wet and your
  shoes are thin."</p>

  <p>She looked into his face, still hesitating. Then she swiftly dropped her
  eyes. The man must be mad! Nevertheless, she seemed for a moment to lose her
  will. The gate had fastened behind them with a sharp click. They were in the
  grove. The way was very narrow and the fir trees almost black. There was only
  a glimpse of deep blue sky to be seen ahead and in front. The pigeons rustled
  their wings, and a great owl lumbered across the way. Something happened to
  Letitia then which had never happened before. She felt both her hands gripped
  by a man's, felt herself powerless in his grasp.</p>

  <p>"Lady Letitia," he exclaimed feverishly, "don't think I'm a fool! I'll not
  ask for what you haven't got to give&mdash;me. You shall have your father's
  note&mdash;you shall have&mdash;for him&mdash;what will make him free, if
  you'll only treat me like a human being&mdash;if you'll be&mdash;kind&mdash;a
  little kinder."</p>

  <p>Her eyes flashed at him through the darkness, yet he could see that one
  thing at least he had achieved. Her bosom was rising and falling quickly, her
  voice shook as she answered him. For the first time he had penetrated that
  intolerable reserve.</p>

  <p>"Are you mad?" she cried. "Are you trying to buy me?"</p>

  <p>"How else should I win even a kind glance?" he answered bitterly.</p>

  <p>"You mistake me for a railroad system," she mocked.</p>

  <p>"I have never mistaken you for anything but a woman," was the vibrating
  reply. "The only trouble is that to me you always posture as something
  else."</p>

  <p>His hands were burning upon her wrists, but she showed no resentment.</p>

  <p>"Is this the way," she asked, "that Americans woo? Do they imprison the
  lady of their choice in some retired spot and make a cash offer for their
  affections? You are at least original, Mr. Thain!"</p>

  <p>"If I can't bring myself to ask you in plain words what I am craving for,"
  he answered hoarsely, "you can guess why. I know very well that there is only
  one thing about me that counts in your eyes. I know that I should be only an
  appendage to the money that would make your father happy and Mandeleys free.
  And yet I don't care. I want you&mdash;you first, and then yourself."</p>

  <p>"You have some faith, then, in your eligibility&mdash;and your methods of
  persuasion?" she observed.</p>

  <p>"Haven't I reason?" he retorted. "You people here are all filled up with
  rotten, time-exploded notions, bound with silken bonds, worshippers of false
  gods. You don't see the truth&mdash;you don't know it. I am not sure that I
  blame you, for it's a beautiful slavery, and but for the ugly realities of
  life you'd prosper in it and have children just as wonderful and just as
  ignorant. But, you see, the times are changing. I am one of the signs of
  them."</p>

  <p>"If this were an impersonal discussion," Letitia began, struggling to
  compose her voice&mdash;</p>

  <p>"But it isn't," he broke in. "I am speaking of you and of me, and no one
  else. I'm fool enough to love you, to be mad about you! Fool enough to make
  you an offer of which any man with a grain of self-respect should be
  ashamed."</p>

  <p>"I quite agree with you," she said smoothly. "Perhaps it will end this
  very interesting little episode if I tell you that I am engaged to marry Lord
  Charles Grantham, and that he is coming down to-morrow."</p>

  <p>He released her hands&mdash;flung them from him almost.</p>

  <p>"Is this the truth?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>She laughed lightly.</p>

  <p>"Why on earth," she asked, "should I take the trouble to tell you anything
  else?"</p>

  <p>He pointed to the path.</p>

  <p>"Get on," he ordered.</p>

  <p>She found herself obeying him&mdash;without resentment, even. When they
  reached the gate that led into the park, he held it open and remained. She
  hesitated for a moment.</p>

  <p>"You are going to leave me to brave the perils of the rest of the journey
  alone?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He made no answer. She lifted her skirts a little, for the dew was
  becoming heavier, and made her graceful way down the slope and across the
  bridge to the postern gate. Arrived there, she looked round. David Thain had
  vanished back into the grove.</p>

  <p>Letitia made her way into her own room and closed the door. She lit both
  of the candles upon her dressing table, pulled back the lace of her sleeves
  and looked at her wrists. There were two red marks there, red marks which, as
  she stared at them, seemed suddenly again to feel the iron pressure. She
  stared at them, half in surprise, without anger and yet with a curious
  emotion. Suddenly she found that she was trembling, obsessed with a strange
  yet irresistible impulse. She bent down and lightly kissed the flaming marks.
  Then she blew out the candles, threw herself into the easy-chair which,
  earlier in the day, she had drawn up to the window, and looked steadily back
  into the park now fast becoming a phantasy of shadowland.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

  <p>The Marquis, with several account books and Mr. Merridrew, who had ridden
  over from his office on a motor-bicycle, had settled down to a laborious
  evening. The former, for no particular reason, was enjoying a slight relapse
  into his customary optimism.</p>

  <p>"I am not without expectation," the Marquis commenced by explaining to his
  agent, "that at the end of the next two months I may find myself in
  possession of a large sum of money. Under those circumstances, it will not be
  a purposeless proceeding to work out what is really required in the way of
  repairs on the various farms. It will be a great pleasure for me to meet my
  tenants in any way possible. On the whole, I consider that they have been
  very reasonable and loyal."</p>

  <p>Mr. Merridrew agreed with his lordship, agreed with him fervently.</p>

  <p>"Some of them," he confessed, "have been very troublesome. A few of them
  have been driven to make some slight repairs themselves, but on the whole,
  your lordship, it would be a great relief if one were able to assist them so
  far as regards positive dilapidations."</p>

  <p>The Marquis dipped his pen in the ink and settled down to his task. At
  that moment, however, Gossett knocked at the door, opened it and advanced
  towards his master with a card upon a salver.</p>

  <p>"The gentleman is staying at Fakenham, I believe, sir, and has motored
  over."</p>

  <p>The Marquis lifted the card. "Mr. James Borden" at first conveyed nothing
  to him. Then he felt a sudden stab of memory.</p>

  <p>"The gentleman wishes to see me?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>"He begs to be allowed a short interview with your lordship," Gossett
  replied.</p>

  <p>"You can show him into the library," was the brief direction. "Mr.
  Merridrew," he added, turning to the agent, "you can proceed with the
  abstract without me. I shall return in time to go through the totals and
  learn the family records of the various tenants&mdash;I refer, of course, to
  those with which I am not acquainted."</p>

  <p>Mr. Merridrew was quite sure that he could manage alone and settled down
  to his task. The Marquis presently left him and crossed the great hall, one
  of the wonders of Mandeleys, the walls of which were still hung with faded
  reproductions, in ornate tapestry, of mediaeval incidents. From somewhere
  amongst the shadows came Gossett, who gravely took up his stand outside the
  library. As though with some curious prescience of the fact that this was an
  unwelcome visitor, his bow, as he threw open the door, was lower even than
  usual.</p>

  <p>"Shall I light the lamp, your lordship?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The Marquis glanced towards the oriel windows, through which the light
  came scantily, and at the figure of James Borden, advancing now from
  somewhere in the dim recesses of the room&mdash;an apartment which remained
  marvellously little altered since the days when it had contained the
  laboriously collected books of a Franciscan order of Monks.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it would be as well, Gossett," his master assented. "You wish to
  see me?" he added, turning towards his visitor.</p>

  <p>James Borden had come posthaste from London, acting upon an impulse which
  had swept him off his feet. All the way down he had been the prey to
  turbulent thoughts. A hundred different ways of conducting this interview had
  presented themselves before him with such facility that he had come to look
  upon it as one of the easiest things on earth. Yet now the moment had arrived
  he was conscious of an unexpected embarrassment. The strange tranquillity of
  the house and this stately apartment, the personality of the Marquis
  himself&mdash;serene, slightly curious, yet with that indefinable air of
  good-breeding which magnifies the obligations of a host&mdash;had a
  paralysing effect upon him. He was tongue-tied, uncertain of himself. All the
  many openings which had come to him so readily faded away.</p>

  <p>"My name is Borden," he announced. "I have come here, hoping for a short
  conversation with you."</p>

  <p>The Marquis made no immediate reply. He watched the lighting of a huge
  lamp which Gossett silently placed in the middle of an ebony black writing
  table, to the side of which he had already drawn up two high-backed
  chairs.</p>

  <p>"Is there anything else your lordship desires?" the man asked.</p>

  <p>"Not at present, Gossett. I will ring."</p>

  <p>The Marquis pointed towards one of the chairs, and seated himself in the
  other.</p>

  <p>"I shall be very glad to hear of your business with me, Mr. Borden," he
  said courteously.</p>

  <p>His visitor had lost none of his embarrassment. The Marquis, in his
  old-fashioned dinner clothes, his black stock, the fob which hung from his
  waistcoat, his finely chiselled features, and that mysterious air of being
  entirely in touch with his surroundings, had him at a disadvantage from the
  first. Borden was wearing the somewhat shabby blue serge suit in which he had
  travelled all day, and which he had neglected to brush. He had been too much
  in earnest about his mission to do more than make the most hasty toilet at
  the hotel. The high-backed chair, which suited the Marquis so well, was an
  unfamiliar article of furniture to him, and he sat upon it stiffly and
  without ease. Nevertheless, he reminded himself that he was there&mdash;he
  must say what he had come to say.</p>

  <p>"I am venturing to address you, Lord Mandeleys," he began, "upon a
  personal subject."</p>

  <p>The Marquis raised his eyebrows gently. It was perhaps a suggestion of
  surprise that a personal subject should exist, lending itself to discussion
  between him and this visitor.</p>

  <p>"And before I go any further," the latter continued, "I want to make it
  clear that I am here at my own initiative only&mdash;that the other person
  interested is entirely ignorant of my visit."</p>

  <p>Mr. Borden paused, and the Marquis made no sign whatever. He was sitting
  quite upright in his chair, the fingers of his right hand toying lazily with
  an ancient paper knife, fashioned of yellow ivory.</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless," the speaker went on, "I wish to tell you that my visit is
  a sequel to a conversation which I had last night with Miss Marcia Hannaway,
  a conversation during which I asked her, not for the first time, to be my
  wife."</p>

  <p>The Marquis's fingers ceased to trifle with the paper knife. Otherwise,
  not a muscle of his body or a single twitch of the features betrayed any
  emotion. Nevertheless, his visitor realised for the first time that all his
  life he had had a wrong conception of this man. He knew quite well that he
  had altogether underrated the difficulties of his task.</p>

  <p>"I am taking it for granted," he proceeded, "that you are broad-minded
  enough, Lord Mandeleys, to admit that we can discuss this, or any other
  matter, on terms of equality. I am unknown to you. My father was a Dean of
  Peterborough; I was myself at Harrow and Magdalen."</p>

  <p>The Marquis's fingers stretched out once more towards the paper knife.</p>

  <p>"You mentioned, I believe," he said, "the name of a lady with whom I am
  acquainted."</p>

  <p>"I am coming to that," was the eager reply. "I only wanted to have it
  understood that this was a matter which we could discuss as equals, as man to
  man."</p>

  <p>"I am so far from agreeing with you," the Marquis declared calmly, "that I
  prefer to choose my own companions in any discussion, and my own subjects. It
  happens that you are a stranger to me."</p>

  <p>Borden checked a hasty retort, which he realised at once would have placed
  him at a further disadvantage.</p>

  <p>"Lord Mandeleys," he said, "I was at first Miss Hannaway's publisher. I
  have become her friend. I desire to become her husband. Her whole story is
  known to me, even from the day when you brought her away from the Vont
  cottage and chose her for your companion. I have watched the slow development
  of her brain, I know how much she has benefited intellectually by the forced
  seclusion entailed upon her by the conditions of your friendship. I realise,
  however, that the time has come when in justice to her gifts, which have not
  yet reached fruition, it is necessary that she should come into closer
  personal contact with the world of which she knows so little. She can attain
  that position by becoming my wife."</p>

  <p>"Really!" his listener murmured, with a faint note of unruffled surprise
  in his tone.</p>

  <p>Borden set his teeth. The task which had seemed to him so easy was
  presenting now a very different appearance. Nevertheless, he kept an iron
  restraint upon himself.</p>

  <p>"I do not wish to weary you," he went on, "by making a long story of this.
  I am forty-one years old and unmarried. Marcia Hannaway is the first woman
  whom I have wished to make my wife, and I wish it because I&mdash;care for
  her. I have been her suitor for nine years. During all that time she has
  given me no word of encouragement. I have never once, until these last few
  days, been permitted to dine alone with her, nor been allowed even the
  privilege of visiting her at her home. The restrictions upon our intercourse
  have been, I presume, in obedience to your wishes, or to Marcia's
  interpretation of them."</p>

  <p>"If we could come," the Marquis said gently, "to the reason for this
  visit&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The words supplied the sting that Borden needed.</p>

  <p>"I believe," he declared, "that Marcia Hannaway in her heart wishes to
  marry me. I believe that she cares enough to marry me. Only a short time ago
  she admitted it, and within twelve hours I received a note, retracting all
  that she had promised."</p>

  <p>There was a deep silence throughout the great room. The faces of the two
  men&mdash;a little closer now, for Borden had moved his chair&mdash;were both
  under the little circle of lamplight. For a single second something had
  disturbed the imperturbability of the Marquis's countenance&mdash;it seemed,
  indeed, as though some strange finger had humanised it, had softened the eyes
  and drawn apart the lips. Then the moment passed.</p>

  <p>"Are we nearing the end of this discussion, Mr. Borden?"</p>

  <p>"Every word brings us nearer the end," was the ready reply. "I am going to
  tell you the truth as I feel it in my heart. Marcia would be at her best in
  the life to which I should bring her. Mentally, spiritually and humanly, as
  my wife she would be happier. She has refused me out of loyalty to you."</p>

  <p>"Are you suggesting," the Marquis enquired, "that I should intervene in
  favour of your suit?"</p>

  <p>Borden struck the table with the flat of his hand.</p>

  <p>"Damn it," he exclaimed, "can't you talk of this like a man! Don't you
  care enough for Marcia to think a little of her happiness? I want you to let
  her go&mdash;to let her believe, whether it is the truth or not, that she is
  not, as she seems to think, necessary to your life. Come! Life has its
  sacrifices as well as its compensations. You've had the best part of a
  wonderful woman's life. I am not saying a word about the conditions which
  exist between you. I don't presume. If I did, I should have to remember that
  Marcia speaks always of your treatment of her with tears of gratitude in her
  eyes. But your time has come. Marcia has many years to live. There is
  something grown up within her which you have nothing to do with&mdash;a
  little flame of genius which burns there all the time, which at this very
  moment would be a furnace but for the fact of the unnatural life she is
  forced to lead as your&mdash;companion. Now you ask what I've come for, and
  you know. I want you to forget yourself and to think of the woman who has
  been your faithful and sympathetic companion for all these years. She hasn't
  come to her own yet. She can't with you. She can with me. Write and thank her
  for what she has given you, and tell her that for the future she is free. She
  can make her choice then, unfettered by these infernal bonds which you have
  laid around her."</p>

  <p>The Marquis turned the lamp a little lower with steady fingers. The
  necessity for his action was not altogether apparent.</p>

  <p>"You suggest, Mr. Borden, if I understand you rightly," he said, "that I
  am now too old and too unintelligent to afford Marcia the stimulating
  companionship which her gifts deserve?"</p>

  <p>"There can't be a great sympathy between you," the other declared, "and,
  to be brutal, the place in life which she deserves, and to which she aspires,
  is not open to her under present conditions."</p>

  <p>"You allude, I presume," the Marquis said, "to the absence of any legal
  tie between Miss Hannaway and myself?"</p>

  <p>"I do," Borden assented. "The world is a broad-minded place enough, but
  there are differences and backwaters&mdash;I am not here to explain them to
  you. I don't need to. Marcia Hannaway, married to her publisher, going where
  she will, thinking how she will, meeting whom she will, would be a different
  person to Miss Marcia Hannaway, living in isolation in Battersea, with
  nothing warm nor human in her life except&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Precisely," the Marquis interrupted, with a little gesture which might
  have concealed&mdash;anything. "I am beginning to grasp your point of view,
  Mr. Borden."</p>

  <p>"And your answer?"</p>

  <p>"I have no answer to give you, sir. You have made certain suggestions,
  which I may or may not be prepared to accept. In any case, matters of so much
  importance scarcely lend themselves to decisions between strangers. I shall
  probably allude to what you have said when I see or write Miss Hannaway."</p>

  <p>"You've nothing more to say to me about it, then?" Borden persisted, a
  little wistfully.</p>

  <p>"Nothing whatever! You may possibly consider my attitude selfish," the
  Marquis added, "but I find myself wholly indifferent to your interests in
  this matter."</p>

  <p>"I should be able to reconcile myself even to that," was the grim reply,
  "if I have been able to penetrate for a single moment that accursed
  selfishness of yours&mdash;if I have been able to make you think, for however
  short a time, of Marcia's future instead of your own."</p>

  <p>The Marquis rose without haste from his place, and rang the bell.</p>

  <p>"You will permit me, Mr. Borden," he invited, "to offer you some
  refreshments?"</p>

  <p>"Thank you, I desire nothing."</p>

  <p>The Marquis pointed to the door, by which Gossett was standing.</p>

  <p>"That, then, I think, concludes our interview," he said, with icy
  courtesy.</p>

  <p>Mr. Borden walked the full length of the very long apartment, suffered
  himself to be respectfully conducted across the great hall, out on to the
  flags and into the motor-car which he had hired in Fakenham. It was not until
  he was on his way through the park that he opened his lips and found them
  attuned to blasphemy. At the top of the gentle slope, however, where the car
  was brought to a standstill while the driver opened the iron gate, he turned
  back and looked at Mandeleys, looked at its time-worn turrets, its mullioned
  windows, the Norman chapel, the ruined cloisters, the ivy-covered west wing,
  the beautiful Elizabethan chimneys. A strange, heterogeneous mass of
  architecture, yet magnificent, in its way impressive, almost inspiring. He
  looked at the little cottage almost at its gates, from which a thin, spiral
  column of smoke was ascending. Perhaps in those few seconds, and with the
  memory of that interview still rankling, he felt a glimmering of real
  understanding. Something which had always been incomprehensible to him in
  Marcia's story stood more or less revealed.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

  <p>The Marquis, if he had been a keen physiognomist, might perhaps have read
  all that he had come to London to know in Marcia's expression as he made his
  unexpected entrance into her sitting room on the following day. She was
  seated at her desk, with a great pile of red roses on one side of her, and a
  secretary, to whom she was dictating, on the other. She swung round in her
  chair and for a moment was speechless. She looked at her visitor
  incredulously, a little helplessly, with some traces of an emotion which
  puzzled him. Her greeting, however, was hearty enough. She sprang to her feet
  and held out both her hands.</p>

  <p>"My dear man, how unlike you! Really, I think that I like surprises. Give
  me both your hands&mdash;so! Let me look at you."</p>

  <p>"I should have warned you of my coming," he said, raising the ink-stained
  fingers which he was clasping to his lips, "but to tell you the truth it was
  a caprice."</p>

  <p>"I thought you were in the country, at Mandeleys!" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"I was," he replied. "I have motored up from there this morning. I came to
  see you."</p>

  <p>She dismissed her secretary, gazed at herself in the glass and made a
  grimace.</p>

  <p>"And a nice sight I look! Never mind. Fancy motoring up from Mandeleys!
  What time did you start?"</p>

  <p>"At six o'clock," he answered, with a little smile. "It was somewhat
  before my regular hour for rising. If you have no other arrangements, I
  should be glad if you would take luncheon with me."</p>

  <p>"Bless the man, of course I will!" she assented, passing her arm through
  his and leading him to a chair. "You are not looking quite so well as you
  ought to after a breath of country air."</p>

  <p>"I am passing through a time of some anxiety," he acknowledged.</p>

  <p>She remained on the side of his chair, still holding his arm. The Marquis
  sank back with a little air of relief. There seemed to be something
  different, something warmer in the world. He was moved by a rare and
  unaccountable impulse&mdash;he drew her towards him and kissed her lips.</p>

  <p>"I had a birthday last week," he said, with a very slight smile. "I think
  that it affected me. One begins to wonder after one has passed middle age,
  not what there is to look forward to, but how much it is worth while
  enduring."</p>

  <p>"Of course," she declared, with a grimace, "you've been diving into musty
  old volumes at Mandeleys and reading the mutterings of one of those primitive
  philosophers who growled at life from a cave."</p>

  <p>"I have found myself a little lonely at Mandeleys," he confessed.</p>

  <p>"But this visit to London," she persisted. "Is it business? Is there
  anything wrong?"</p>

  <p>"I came to see you."</p>

  <p>"My head is going round," she declared. "This is Wednesday. Besides, I
  thought you were going to stay away until I wrote you&mdash;not that I wanted
  you to."</p>

  <p>"I changed my mind," he told her, "in consequence of a visit which I
  received yesterday from a Mr. James Borden."</p>

  <p>She gave vent to an exclamation of dismay.</p>

  <p>"You mean that Jimmy has been down to see you?"</p>

  <p>"If Jimmy and Mr. James Borden are identical," the Marquis replied, a
  little stiffly, "he undoubtedly has."</p>

  <p>She looked at him helplessly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, dear," she exclaimed, "how could he be so foolish!"</p>

  <p>"He wanted, it seems," the Marquis continued, "to have what he called a
  man-to-man talk. I am not the sort of person, as you know, Marcia, who
  appreciates man-to-man talks with strangers. I listened to all that he had to
  say, and because I gathered that he was your friend, I was polite to him.
  That is all. He gave me to understand that he was your suitor."</p>

  <p>"He'd no right to tell you anything of the sort," she declared, "but in a
  sense I suppose it is true. He wants me to marry him. It's most fearfully
  unsettling. But that he should come to you! I wish he hadn't, Reginald."</p>

  <p>"It appeared to me to be a quixotic action," the Marquis assented.
  "However, indirectly it has been conducive of good&mdash;it has brought me a
  great pleasure. I have missed you very much, Marcia. I am very happy to be
  here again, for however short a time."</p>

  <p>"You are going back, then, to Mandeleys?"</p>

  <p>"When we part, directly after luncheon. I have guests arriving there
  to-night&mdash;my sister and Grantham, and I believe some others. But after
  my talk with Borden, or rather his talk to me, I felt that I must see
  you."</p>

  <p>"Well, I've missed you," she confessed frankly. "I seem to have had lots
  to do, and I have been going to the theatres, and I have quite made up my
  mind to write a play. But I have missed you.&mdash;Shall I go and put on my
  hat?"</p>

  <p>"If you will," he answered. "We can talk in the car and at luncheon."</p>

  <p>The Marquis watched her cross the room and sighed. At thirty-nine, he
  thought, she was wonderfully young. Her figure was a little more mature, but
  in all other respects she seemed only to have found poise and assurance with
  the passing years. He leaned back in his chair almost with a sense of luxury.
  He was back again in the atmosphere which had kept him young, the atmosphere
  which unconsciously had hung around him and kept him warm and
  contented&mdash;kept him, too, from looking over the edge into strange
  places. The room was deliciously feminine, notwithstanding a certain
  fascinating disorder. There were magazines, Reviews and illustrated papers
  everywhere in evidence, an open box of cigarettes upon the chimneypiece, an
  armful of flowers thrown loose upon the table, as well as the roses upon her
  desk. One of her gloves lay upon a chair by the side of a pile of proofs. It
  seemed to him that there were some new photographs on the mantelpiece, but
  his own, in the uniform of his county yeomanry, still occupied the central
  position. There were songs upon the piano; on the sideboard a silver cocktail
  shaker, and, as he noticed with a little pang, two glasses. Nevertheless, he
  sat there waiting in great content until Marcia came in, dressed for the
  street. She was followed by a servant with some ice upon a tray, and
  bottles.</p>

  <p>"Now for my new vice," she exclaimed gaily, taking up the cocktail shaker
  and half filling it with ice. "You are not going to be obstinate, are
  you?"</p>

  <p>"I shall take anything you may give me, with great pleasure," he assured
  her, a little stiffly.</p>

  <p>She saw him looking at the second glass, and laughed.</p>

  <p>"It is Phyllis Grant who is responsible for this," she explained. "She
  lives in the next flat, you know, and she comes in most days, either before
  luncheon or before dinner, for an ap&eacute;ritif and a cigarette."</p>

  <p>The Marquis's face cleared. He drank his cocktail and pronounced it
  delicious. On the threshold he paused and looked back.</p>

  <p>"I like your little room, Marcia," he said. "I find it a strange thing to
  confess, but there is nowhere else in the world where I feel quite as much at
  home, quite as contented, as I do here."</p>

  <p>She seemed almost startled, for a moment unresponsive. Such a speech was
  so unlike him that it seemed impossible that he could be in earnest. She
  walked down the stairs by his side with a new gravity in her face. Perhaps he
  noticed it. At any rate, as soon as they were seated in the car he began to
  talk to her.</p>

  <p>"The object of Mr. Borden's visit to me, I gathered, was to impress upon
  me the fact that by marrying him you would gain many advantages from which
  you are at present debarred. I naturally made no comment, nor did I argue the
  matter with him. I have come to you."</p>

  <p>She sat silent in her corner. Her eyes were fixed upon a nursemaid, with
  two or three young children, passing by. Suddenly she touched her companion
  on the arm and pointed to them.</p>

  <p>"There is that, you know," she faltered.</p>

  <p>The Marquis nodded.</p>

  <p>"My great fear," he continued, "is that sometimes I am too much inclined
  to treat you as a contemporary, and to forget that you have never known those
  things which are a part of every woman's life. I must give Mr. Borden the
  credit for having had the good taste not to mention them."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Jimmy isn't a cad," she answered, "but, without mentioning them, I
  cannot understand what he came to you for. As regards the other things you
  have spoken of, I don't care a rap about them, in fact I love my
  independence. I go where I choose, I have found no one indisposed to make my
  acquaintance, and the more I see of life&mdash;such life as comes to
  me&mdash;the more I love it. When Jim&mdash;Mr. Borden&mdash;uses such
  arguments, he bores me. They are directly against him instead of for him. If
  I were Mrs. James Borden, people would leave cards upon me and I should have
  to eat dinners with fellow-publishers' wives, and exchange calls, and waste
  many hours of my life in all the tomfoolery of middle-class respectable
  living. It doesn't appeal to me, Reginald. He is an idiot not to realise
  it."</p>

  <p>"What does appeal to you, then?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"That," she answered, moving her head backwards.</p>

  <p>They crossed Battersea Bridge in silence.</p>

  <p>"It's such a silly, ordinary problem," she went on presently, "and yet
  it's so difficult. It's either now or never, you know, Reginald. I shall say
  good-by to the thirties before long."</p>

  <p>"It is your problem," he said sadly, "not mine."</p>

  <p>She held his fingers in hers.</p>

  <p>"If only, when we were both so much younger," she sighed, "we had had a
  little more courage. But I was so ignorant, and there was so much else, too,
  to distract. I shall never forget our first few months of travel&mdash;Paris,
  the Riviera, Italy. I was impressionable, too, and I loved it all
  so&mdash;the colour and the beauty, the rich, warm stream of life, after that
  wretched village school. I was so aching to understand, and you were such a
  good tutor. You fed my brain wonderfully. Oh, I suppose I ought to be
  content!"</p>

  <p>"And I," he murmured, "I, too, ought to be ready to creep into my own
  little shelter and be content with&mdash;memories."</p>

  <p>"Ah, no!" she protested, laying her hand upon his. "If you feel like that,
  it is ended.&mdash;Now come, this is a gala day. You have come so far to see
  me. I am seriously flattered. You must be starved, too. Not another word
  until we have lunched."</p>

  <p>At Trewly's their entrance produced a mild sensation. Their usual table
  was fortunately unoccupied. The manager himself welcomed them with many
  compliments. Marcia glanced around her a little listlessly.</p>

  <p>"There is something rather mausoleum-like about this restaurant in the
  daytime," she declared. "Won't you take me somewhere else one day,
  Reginald?"</p>

  <p>"Why not?" he answered. "It is for you to choose."</p>

  <p>"There are some queer, foreign little places," she went on hastily. "The
  things to eat, perhaps, are not so good, but the people seem alive. There is
  an air here, isn't there, of faded splendour about the decorations and the
  people, too."</p>

  <p>"I will make enquiries," the Marquis promised.</p>

  <p>"Don't," she begged. "You must leave it to me. I will find somewhere. And
  now let us be serious, Reginald. Here we are come to rather a late crisis in
  our lives. Tell me, how much do I really mean to you? Am I just a habit, or
  have you really in the background memories and thoughts about me which you
  seldom express?"</p>

  <p>He leaned across the table.</p>

  <p>"I will confess," he said, "that I have been surprised, during the last
  few days, to discover how much you do mean to me, Marcia. Your quicker
  apprehension, perhaps, finds fault with me, rebels against the too great
  passivity of my appreciation. You have been the refuge of my life. Perhaps I
  have accepted too much and given too little. That is what may reasonably
  happen when there is a disparity in years and vitality as great as exists
  between us. What seemed to you to be habit, Marcia, is really peace. I have
  forgotten what I should always have remembered&mdash;that you are still
  young."</p>

  <p>Her eyes glistened as she looked at him. A ray of sunshine which found its
  way through an overhead window was momentarily unkind. The lines under his
  eyes, the wrinkles in his face, the thinning of his hair, were all a little
  more apparent. Marcia was conscious of an unworthy, a hateful feeling, a
  sensation of which she was hideously ashamed. And yet, though her voice
  shook, there was still self-pity in her heart.</p>

  <p>"I am so glad that you came," she said. "I am so glad that you have spoken
  to me like this. You need have no fear. Those other things were born of just
  a temperamental fancy. They will pass. Be to me just what you have been. I
  shall be satisfied."</p>

  <p>A cloud passed over the sun. His face was once more in the shadow, and
  curiously enough her fancy saw him through strangely different eyes. Age
  seemed to pass, although something of the helpless wistfulness remained. It
  was the pleading of a boy, the eager hope of a child, of which she suddenly
  seemed conscious.</p>

  <p>"Do you think that you can be happy&mdash;as things are, Marcia?" he
  asked. "Your friend, Mr. Borden, doesn't think so. He came down&mdash;he was
  just a little melodramatic, I think&mdash;hoping to incite me to a great
  sacrifice. I was to play the part of the self-denying hero. I was to give
  away the thing I loved, for its own sake. I had no fancy for the r&ocirc;le,
  Marcia."</p>

  <p>"And I should hate you in it, dear," she assured him.</p>

  <p>"Mr. James Borden will always be a dear friend, but he must learn what
  every one else in the world has had to learn&mdash;a lesson of self-denial.
  He will find some one else."</p>

  <p>"I am not jealous of the man," the Marquis said. "I am jealous of just one
  thought that his coming may have brought into your brain&mdash;one
  instinct."</p>

  <p>"Don't be," she begged. "It will go just as it came. It is part of a
  woman's nature, I suppose. Every now and then it tortures."</p>

  <p>Luncheon was served excellently but without undue haste. They fell to
  discussing lighter topics.</p>

  <p>"You will be interested to hear," he told her, "that my daughter Letitia
  is engaged to be married to Charles Grantham. I am quite expecting that by
  Christmas I shall be alone. I find Letitia a charming and dutiful companion,"
  he went on, "but I must confess that I look forward to her marriage with some
  satisfaction. It has occurred to me that if it suited your work, we might
  travel for a time, or rather settle down&mdash;in Italy, if you prefer it.
  There is so much there to keep one always occupied. In Florence, for
  instance, one commences a new education every spring."</p>

  <p>"I should love it," she answered, with an enthusiasm which still lacked
  something.</p>

  <p>"A villa somewhere on the slopes of Fiesole," he continued, "with a
  garden, a real Italian garden, with fountains and statuary, and straight
  paths, and little strips of deep lawn, and a few cypress trees. And there
  must be a view of Florence. I think that you would work well there, Marcia.
  If things go as I expect, I thought that we might leave England about
  Christmas-time, and loiter a little on the Riviera till the season for the
  cold winds has passed. Browning wrote of the delights of an English spring,
  but he lived in Florence."</p>

  <p>"There is so much there that I am longing to see again," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"You shall see it all," he promised. "If you wish, you shall live with it.
  I do not know whether there is anything strange about me," he went on, after
  a moment's hesitation, "but I must confess that I find myself a little out of
  touch with modern English life. The atmosphere of my sister's house, for
  instance, invariably repels me. The last generation was amused by the efforts
  of those without just claims to penetrate into the circles of their social
  superiors. To-day the reverse seems to be the case. The men, and the women
  especially, of my order, seem to be perpetually struggling to imitate the
  manners and weaknesses of a very interesting but irresponsible world of
  Bohemia. I find myself with few friends, nowadays. The freedom and yet the
  isolation of foreign life, therefore, perhaps appeals to me all the more.</p>

  <p>"But you would not care to leave Mandeleys, surely?"</p>

  <p>"My dear Marcia," he said, "I am possessed, perhaps, of a peculiar
  temperament, but I can assure you that Mandeleys is spoiled for me so long as
  that&mdash;that ridiculous old man&mdash;you will forgive me&mdash;your
  father, sits at the end of his garden, invoking curses upon my head. To every
  one except myself, the humour of the situation is obvious. To me there is
  something else which I cannot explain. Whether it is a presentiment, a fear,
  an offence to my dignity, I cannot tell. I have spent all the spare money I
  have in the world trying to get that Vont cottage back again into the family
  estates, but I have failed. Really, your father might just as well have
  Mandeleys itself."</p>

  <p>"You know that I went to see him?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I remember your telling me that you were going," he replied.</p>

  <p>"My mission was a dismal failure," she confessed. "I felt as though I were
  talking to a stranger, and he looked as though he were speaking to a Jezebel.
  We stood in different worlds, and called to one another over the gulf in
  different languages."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," the Marquis sighed, "it is as well that he is your father. The
  other morning I passed down the fencing gallery and examined my father's
  collection of rifles. There was one there with a range of six hundred yards,
  which was supposed in those days to be marvellous, and some cartridges which
  fitted it. The window was open. You think, Marcia, that I am too placid for
  impulses, yet I can assure you that I slipped a cartridge into the magazine
  of that rifle, closed it, and knelt down before the open window. I held your
  father covered by the sight until I could have shrieked. Then I turned away
  and fired at a log of wood in the park. I found the bullet afterwards, half a
  foot deep in the centre of it."</p>

  <p>She shivered a little.</p>

  <p>"For heaven's sake, don't go near that fencing gallery again!" she
  begged.&mdash;"You see the time?"</p>

  <p>He rose to his feet, and they passed down the restaurant together.
  Outside, the car was waiting.</p>

  <p>"Will you think me very discourteous," he asked, "if I send you back in a
  taxicab? I shall be hard pushed, as it is, to reach home before my
  guests."</p>

  <p>"Of course," she assented.</p>

  <p>He stood for a moment after she had taken her place in the vehicle, with
  her hand in his.</p>

  <p>"My visit," he whispered, "has made me very happy."</p>

  <p>She looked at him through a mist of unexpected tears.</p>

  <p>"Come to me soon," she begged a little abruptly. "I shall want you."</p>

  <p>"Early next month," he promised, "or, if you send for me, before."</p>

  <p>She seemed restless, indisposed to let him go. "I wish you weren't going
  away at all," she declared with unusual fervour. "I wish&mdash;Come back with
  me now, won't you? Do!"</p>

  <p>For a moment he hesitated. He felt an extraordinary impulse to throw
  everything on one side and accept her invitation. The crisis passed, however,
  before he could yield. Marcia, with a little laugh, became her normal
  self.</p>

  <p>"What an idiot I am!" she exclaimed good-humouredly. "Of course, you must
  get down to Mandeleys as quickly as you can. Good-by!"</p>

  <p>She threw herself back in the corner of the taxicab and waved her
  farewells. The Marquis stood for a moment bareheaded upon the pavement. He
  watched the vehicle until it became lost in the stream of traffic. The
  impulse of a few moments ago was stronger than ever, linked now, too, with an
  intolerable sense of depression. It was with an extraordinary effort of will
  that he took his place in his own car and motioned the chauffeur to
  proceed.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

  <p>The Duchess walked with Letitia in the high-walled garden at Mandeleys, on
  the morning after her arrival. She appeared to be in a remarkably good
  temper.</p>

  <p>"I have not the least intention of boring myself, my dear Letitia," she
  said, in reply to some conventional remark of her niece's. "So long as I get
  plenty of fresh air during the day, good plain food, and my bridge between
  tea and dinner, I am always contented. Let me see," she went on, coming to a
  standstill and pointing with her stick to the little belt of tall elm trees
  and the fir plantation behind, "Broomleys is that way, isn't it? Yes, I can
  see the house."</p>

  <p>Letitia nodded, but only glanced in the direction her aunt indicated.</p>

  <p>"And Mr. Thain? Do you find him a pleasant neighbour?"</p>

  <p>Letitia looked deliberately the other way. It was just as well that her
  aunt should not see the flash in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"We do not see much of him," she replied. "He gallops round the park every
  day like a lunatic, and he spends a great deal of time, I think, in his
  car."</p>

  <p>"My dear," the Duchess said impressively, "David Thain may have his
  peculiarities, but he is really a most simple and sincere person. I was
  attracted to him upon the steamer simply because of his shyness, and a good
  thing for you, dear, that I was. It must make quite a difference to have
  Broomleys properly let to a man who can pay a good rent for it."</p>

  <p>"We have never denied that," Letitia admitted drily. "We are keeping house
  now upon the first quarter's rent."</p>

  <p>"Is it my fancy," her aunt continued, stooping to pick herself a sprig of
  lavender, "or do you really dislike Mr. Thain?"</p>

  <p>"Intensely!" Letitia confessed with emphasis.</p>

  <p>The Duchess was surprised.</p>

  <p>"Well, really!" she exclaimed. "And to me he seems such a harmless,
  inoffensive person, absolutely without self-consciousness and not in the
  least bumptious."</p>

  <p>"What on earth has he to be bumptious about?" Letitia scoffed. "He has
  simply made a lot of money out of other people."</p>

  <p>"That shows brains, at least," her aunt reminded her.</p>

  <p>"Cunning!" Letitia retorted.</p>

  <p>The Duchess twirled the sprig of lavender between her fingers. She could
  not remember ever to have heard her niece so much in earnest.</p>

  <p>"Well, I hope you don't feel too strongly about him," she said. "I must
  have him asked to dinner while I am here."</p>

  <p>"We have anticipated your wishes," Letitia remarked. "He is coming
  to-night."</p>

  <p>"I am very glad to hear it," was the satisfied reply. "I shall do my best
  to persuade him to come up to Scotland later on. There is nothing that Henry
  enjoys more than a little flutter in American railways. Perhaps he will help
  us to make some money."</p>

  <p>"Personally," Letitia said slowly, "I should be very careful how I trusted
  Mr. Thain."</p>

  <p>The Duchess was shocked.</p>

  <p>"You carry your aversions too far, my dear," she remonstrated.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps, I only know that he sold father a lot of shares which it is my
  profound conviction are entirely worthless."</p>

  <p>"Sold your father shares?" the Duchess repeated. "I don't understand. How
  on earth could Reginald pay for any shares!"</p>

  <p>"He gave what is called an acceptance," Letitia explained. "It falls due
  in about six weeks."</p>

  <p>The Duchess smiled. She had a great idea of her own capacity for
  business.</p>

  <p>"My dear," she said, "if between now and then the shares have not improved
  sufficiently for your father to make a profitable sale, Mr. Thain can extend
  the time of payment by renewing the bill."</p>

  <p>"You have more confidence in Mr. Thain than I have," Letitia remarked
  drily.</p>

  <p>Her aunt was a little puzzled. She decided to change the conversation.</p>

  <p>"Where is Charles this morning?" she enquired.</p>

  <p>"In the library with father. They are discussing possible settlements. I
  thought that sort of thing was always left to lawyers."</p>

  <p>"I hope you are happier about your marriage than you seem," her aunt
  observed. "Charles is quite a <i>parti</i>, in a way, you know, although he
  is not rich."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I suppose it may as well be Charles as any one else," Letitia
  assented, a little drearily.</p>

  <p>The Duchess shook her head.</p>

  <p>"You need a change, my dear," she declared. "I hate to hear you talk like
  that, especially as you are by way of being one of those single-minded young
  persons who must find everything in marriage or else be profoundly unhappy. I
  am not at all sure that you ought to have considered the question of marriage
  until you were in love."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," Letitia retorted, "I have a horror of being an old maid."</p>

  <p>Her aunt sighed.</p>

  <p>"Now I come to think of it," she went on reminiscently, "there is a
  curious streak of fidelity, isn't there, in your father's character. You must
  take after him. It ought to make you very careful, Letitia. I don't want to
  say a word against Charles, but he doesn't carry his head quite so high as
  you do, you know. When are you going to announce your engagement?"</p>

  <p>"As soon as he leaves here, I think."</p>

  <p>"Hm! Is Charlie very much in love with you?"</p>

  <p>"If he is, he hasn't mentioned it," Letitia observed. "Nowadays, men seem
  to reserve that sort of protestation for their musical comedy friends, and
  suggest a joint establishment, as a matter of mutual convenience, to us."</p>

  <p>"Bitter, my dear&mdash;very bitter for your years!" her aunt sighed.</p>

  <p>"What would you like to do this morning?" Letitia asked, abruptly changing
  the subject.</p>

  <p>"I shall amuse myself," was the prompt reply. "First of all, I am going to
  undertake a little mission on Reginald's account. I am going over to talk to
  that ridiculous old man Vont. Afterwards, I shall walk across to
  Broomleys."</p>

  <p>"Most improper!" Letitia remarked.</p>

  <p>"My dear," her aunt reminded her, "I am nearly forty years old, although
  no one in the world would guess it if it were not for those wretched Court
  Guides. I look upon Mr. Thain as a sort of prot&eacute;g&eacute; of mine, and
  I have an idea that you are not being so nice to him as you might be."</p>

  <p>"I do my best," Letitia replied, "and I really don't think he has anything
  to complain of."</p>

  <p>The Duchess parted from her niece as they neared the house and proceeded
  to pay her first visit. She crossed the moat by the little handbridge, walked
  briskly across the intervening strip of park, and approached the little
  enclosure in which the cottage was situated. Richard Vont, seated in his
  usual corner of the garden, remained motionless at her approach. He neither
  rose nor offered any sort of greeting.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Vont," she said briskly, as she reached the paling.</p>

  <p>He was looking at her fixedly from underneath his bushy grey eyebrows. He
  sat bolt upright in his chair, and he kept his hat upon his head.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"My good man," she remonstrated, "you might as well be civil. Why don't
  you stand up and take off your hat? You know who I am."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know who you are," he replied, without moving. "You are Caroline,
  Duchess of Winchester. I keep my hat upon my head because I owe you no
  respect and I feel none. As to asking you in, no one of your family will
  ever, of my will, step inside these palings."</p>

  <p>"You are a very obstinate old man, Vont," she said severely.</p>

  <p>"I am what the Lord made me."</p>

  <p>"Well," she continued, leaning slightly against the paling and looking
  down at him, "I came down here to say a few words to you, and I shall say
  them, unless you run away. You are one of those simple, ignorant men, Vont,
  who love to nurse an imaginary injustice until the idea that you have been
  wronged becomes so fixed in your brain that you haven't room for anything
  else there. This behaviour of yours, you know, is perfectly ridiculous."</p>

  <p>Vont made no sign even of having heard her. She continued.</p>

  <p>"You haven't even a grievance. My brother took your daughter away from her
  home. Under some conditions, that would have been a very reprehensible thing.
  As things turned out, it has been the making of the young woman. She has
  received a wonderful education, has been taken abroad, and has been treated
  with respect and consideration by every one. My brother has devoted a
  considerable portion of his lifetime to ensuring her happiness. She is now a
  contented, clever, talented and respected woman. If she had remained here,
  she would probably have become the wife-drudge of a farmer or a local
  tradesman. You are listening, Richard Vont?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am listening!"</p>

  <p>"If the Marquis had betrayed your daughter, taken her away and deserted
  her," she continued, "there might have been some justification for this
  theatrical attitude of yours. Under the present circumstances, there is none
  at all. Why don't you rid yourself of the idea, once for all, that you or
  your daughter have suffered any wrong? You've only a few years to live. Take
  up your work again. There is plenty to be done here. Go and mix with your old
  friends and live like a reasonable man. This brooding attitude of yours is
  all out of date. Put your Bible away, light a pipe, and set to work and kill
  some of the rabbits. The farmers are always complaining."</p>

  <p>"You have a niece up yonder," Vont said, knitting his shaggy grey eyebrows
  and gazing steadfastly at his visitor, "a well-looking young woman, they
  say&mdash;Lady Letitia Thursford. Would you like her to live with a man and
  not be married to him?"</p>

  <p>"Of course," the Duchess replied, "that is simply impertinent. If you are
  going to compare the doings of your very excellent yeomen stock with the
  doings of the Thursfords, you are talking and thinking like a fool. A few
  hundred years ago, it would have been your duty to have offered your
  womenkind to your master when you paid your rent. We have changed all that,
  quite properly, but not all the socialists who ever breathed, or all the
  democratic teachings you may have imbibed in America, can entitle you to talk
  of the Vonts and the Thursfords in the same breath."</p>

  <p>The old man rose slowly to his feet. He leaned a little upon his stick,
  and pointed to Mandeleys.</p>

  <p>"You are an ignorant, shameless woman," he said. "Get you home and read
  your Bible. If you want a last word to carry away with you, here it is. My
  daughter was just as much to me as the young woman who walked yonder with you
  in the garden is to her father. Let him remember that."</p>

  <p>"But, you foolish person," she expostulated, "Lady Letitia enjoys all the
  advantages to which her station entitles her. Your daughter, with a mind and
  intelligence very much superior to her position, was employed in the
  miserable drudgery of teaching village children."</p>

  <p>"Honest work," he replied, "hurts no one, unless they are full of sickly
  fancies. It's idleness that brings sin. They tell me you've new creeds
  amongst those in your walk of life, and a new manner of living. Live as you
  will, then, but let others do the same. I stand by the Book, and maybe, when
  your last days come, you will be sorry you cast it aside."</p>

  <p>"So far as I remember," she reminded him, "the chief teaching of that Book
  is forgiveness."</p>

  <p>"Your memory fails you, then," he answered grimly, "for what the Book
  preaches is justice to poor and rich alike."</p>

  <p>The Duchess sighed. She was a good-hearted woman and full of confidence,
  but she recognised her limitations.</p>

  <p>"My good man," she said, "I shall not argue with you any more. You won't
  believe it, but you are simply narrow and pig-headed and obstinate, and you
  won't believe that there may be a grain of reason in anybody else's point of
  view but your own. Just look at yourself! You can't be more than sixty-five
  or so, and you might be a hundred! You sit there nursing your grievance and
  thinking about it, while your whole life is running to seed. Why don't you
  get up and be a human being? Send for your daughter to come down and look
  after you&mdash;she'd come&mdash;and choke it all down. Put the Book away for
  a time, or read a little more of the New Testament and a little less of the
  Old. Come, will you be sensible, and I'll come in and shake hands with you,
  and we'll write your daughter together."</p>

  <p>Vont was still leaning on his stick. Save that his eyebrows were drawn a
  little closer together, his expression was unchanged. Yet his visitor, though
  the sunshine was all around them, shivered.</p>

  <p>"Did he send you here?"</p>

  <p>"Of course not," she replied. "I came of my own accord. I remembered the
  days when you used to take me rabbiting and let me shoot a pheasant if there
  was no one about. You were a sensible, well-balanced man then. I came, hoping
  to find that there was a little of the old Richard Vont left in you."</p>

  <p>"There is just enough of the old Richard Vont left," he said, "to send you
  back to where you came from, with a message, if you care to carry it. Tell
  him&mdash;your brother, the Lord of Mandeleys&mdash;that I am not sitting
  here of idle purpose, that I don't hear the voices around me for nothing,
  that I don't look day and night at Mandeleys for nothing. Tell him to make
  the most of the sun that shines to-day and the soft bed he lies on to-night
  and the woman he kisses to-morrow, for he is very close to the end. I am an
  old man, but I'm here to see the end. It has been promised."</p>

  <p>The Duchess, brimful of common sense and good humour, brave as a lion and
  ready of tongue as she was, felt a little giddy, and clung to the rail as she
  crossed the little bridge over the moat. She looked back only once. Richard
  Vont remained standing just as she had left him&mdash;grim, motionless,
  menacing.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>

  <p>The Marquis glanced at the note which was handed to him at luncheon time,
  frowned slightly and handed it across to Letitia.</p>

  <p>"What have you people been doing to Thain?" he asked a little irritably.
  "He doesn't want to come to dinner."</p>

  <p>The Duchess and Sylvia, who had just arrived on her projected visit, made
  no attempt to conceal their disappointment. Letitia picked, up the note and
  read it indifferently.</p>

  <p>"I am very sorry, aunt," she said. "I gave him all the notice I
  could."</p>

  <p>"There is perhaps some misunderstanding," the Marquis remarked. "In any
  case, he would not know that you were here for so short a time, Caroline.
  After luncheon I will walk across and see him."</p>

  <p>"I will go with you," the Duchess decided. "I should like to see Broomleys
  again. As a matter of fact, I meant to go there this morning, but I found one
  call enough for me."</p>

  <p>They took their coffee in the garden. Letitia followed her father to a
  rose bush which he had crossed the lawn to examine.</p>

  <p>"Dad," she asked, passing her hand through his arm, "have you had any good
  news?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because you look so much better. I think that motoring must agree with
  you."</p>

  <p>He patted her hand.</p>

  <p>"I rather enjoyed the drive," he admitted. "As a matter of fact, perhaps I
  am better," he went on.</p>

  <p>"You haven't any good news about the shares, I suppose?" she asked
  hesitatingly.</p>

  <p>For a moment he was grave.</p>

  <p>"I have no news at all," he confessed, "or rather what news I have is not
  good. I put an enquiry through an independent firm of stockbrokers with whom
  I have had some transactions; and their reply coincided with the information
  already afforded to me."</p>

  <p>Letitia glanced across the park, and her face darkened.</p>

  <p>"Has it ever struck you," she asked, "that there is something peculiar
  about Mr. Thain in his attitude towards us&mdash;as a family, I mean?"</p>

  <p>The Marquis shook his head.</p>

  <p>"On the contrary," he replied, "I have always considered his deportment
  unimpeachable."</p>

  <p>Letitia hesitated, pulled a rose to pieces and turned back with her father
  towards where the Duchess was reclining in a wicker chair.</p>

  <p>"I dare say it's my fancy. Why don't you all go," she suggested, "and take
  Mr. Thain by storm? He can scarcely resist you, aunt, and Sylvia."</p>

  <p>"Why don't you come yourself?" the Duchess asked.</p>

  <p>"My duty lies here," Letitia observed, with a little smile towards
  Grantham, who had just strolled up with Sylvia.</p>

  <p>The Duchess rose to her feet.</p>

  <p>"Dear me, yes!" she acquiesced. "You two had better go off and have a long
  country walk. If I sit for long after luncheon, I always go to sleep; so come
  along, Reginald, we'll beard the lion in his den."</p>

  <p>The Marquis glanced towards Sylvia, but she shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I must see after my unpacking," she said, "but I should very much like
  Mr. Thain to come. Do try to persuade him."</p>

  <p>The Duchess and her brother strolled up the garden and out of the postern
  gate into the park.</p>

  <p>"That's a terrible old man of yours, Reginald," the former observed,
  glancing over her shoulder. "I never came across such a person off the boards
  at Drury Lane."</p>

  <p>"He is an infernal nuisance," the Marquis grumbled. "It seems absurd, but
  he gets on my nerves. Day by day, there he sits, wet or fine. You can't see
  his lips move, but you can always feel sure that he is hunting up choice bits
  of damnation out of the Old Testament and hurling them across at me."</p>

  <p>"I have come to the conclusion," his sister decided, "that he is out of
  his mind. An ignorant man who lives with one idea all his life is apt to lose
  his reason. He has never attempted any violence, has he?"</p>

  <p>"Never," the Marquis replied, "but since you have mentioned it, Caroline,
  I always have a queer sensation when I am that side of the house. It is just
  about the distance to be picked off nicely with a rifle. I can't think why he
  doesn't do it&mdash;why he contents himself with abuse."</p>

  <p>"I am going to consult Mr. Thain about him," his companion said. "A man of
  his robust common sense is much more likely to influence a lunatic like Vont
  than you or I.&mdash;So this is where our millionaire hermit is hidden," she
  went on, as they reached the gate. "Dear me, the place has changed!"</p>

  <p>"It will soon be in order again," the Marquis observed. "Thain has a dozen
  men at work in the grounds, and he is having the rooms done up, one by one.
  He lives in the library, I think, and the bedroom over it."</p>

  <p>They passed through the plantation and into the gardens. Thain was there,
  talking to one of the workmen. He came to meet them with a somewhat forced
  smile of welcome upon his lips.</p>

  <p>"This is very unexpected," he declared, as he shook hands. "I should have
  called upon you this afternoon, Duchess."</p>

  <p>"I should think so!" she replied severely. "Will you be so good as to tell
  me at once what you mean by refusing my niece's invitation to dine?"</p>

  <p>He hesitated for a moment, then he smiled. There was something very
  attractive about his visitor's frank directness of speech and manner.</p>

  <p>"I refused," he admitted, glancing around to where the Marquis was engaged
  in conversation with a gardener, "because I didn't want to come."</p>

  <p>"But I am there, you stupid person!" she reminded him. "You are invited to
  dine with me! I know you don't get on with Lady Letitia, and I know you don't
  like large parties, but there are only half a dozen of us there, and I
  promise you my whole protection. Show me something at once. I want to talk to
  you. Those Dorothy Perkins roses will do, at the other end of the lawn."</p>

  <p>He walked in silence by her side. She waited until they were well out of
  earshot.</p>

  <p>"David Thain," she said, "have I shown an interest in you or have I
  not?"</p>

  <p>"You have been extraordinarily kind," he confessed.</p>

  <p>"And in return," she continued, "you have decided to avoid me. I won't
  have it. Are you afraid that I might want you to make love to me?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I am sure you wouldn't find that amusing," he declared. "In the society
  of your sex I generally behave pretty well as your brother would do if he
  were dumped down in an office in Wall Street."</p>

  <p>"I honestly believe that you are diffident," she admitted. "I never met a
  millionaire before who was, and at first I thought it was a pose with you.
  Perhaps I was mistaken. You really don't think, then, that you have any
  attraction apart from your millions?"</p>

  <p>"I'm quite sure that I haven't," he answered bitterly.</p>

  <p>"A love affair!" she exclaimed, looking into his face scrutinisingly. "And
  I knew nothing of it!&mdash;I, your sponsor, your lady confessor,
  your&mdash;well, heaven knows what I might not be if you would only behave
  decently! A love affair, indeed! That little yellow-haired chit, I suppose,
  who is down here raving about you all the time&mdash;Sylvia
  What's-her-name?"</p>

  <p>He smiled.</p>

  <p>"I know very little of Miss Sylvia Laycey," he said, "beyond the fact that
  she seems very charming."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you ought to marry," she continued regretfully. "It seems a
  pity, but they'll never leave you alone till you do. What is your type, then?
  Sylvia Laycey is much too young for you. I suppose you know that."</p>

  <p>"I don't think I have one," he answered.</p>

  <p>"That's because I am married, of course," she went on. "If you were a
  sensible man, you would settle down to adore me and not think of anybody else
  at all. But you won't do it. You'll want to buy palaces and yachts and town
  houses and theatres, like all the rest of the superfluously rich, and you'll
  want a musical comedy star to wear your jewels, and a wife to entertain your
  friends."</p>

  <p>"Well, you must admit that I haven't been in a hurry about any of these
  things yet," he observed.</p>

  <p>She looked at him keenly.</p>

  <p>"Look here, my young friend," she said, "you haven't made the one mistake
  I warned you against, have you? You haven't fallen in love with Letitia?"</p>

  <p>He laughed almost brutally.</p>

  <p>"I am not quite such a fool as that," he assured her.</p>

  <p>"Well, I should hope not," she enjoined severely. "Besides, as a matter of
  fact, Letitia is engaged. Her young man is staying at Mandeleys now. Just
  answer me one question, David&mdash;why did you refuse that invitation to
  dinner?"</p>

  <p>"Because I didn't feel like coming," he answered. "I thought it would
  probably be a large party, most of them neighbours, and every one would have
  to make an effort to entertain me because I am a stranger, and don't know
  their ways or anything about them."</p>

  <p>"There you are again!" she exclaimed. "Just as sensitive as you can be,
  for all your millions! You'll come, David&mdash;please?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I will, if you ask me like that," he assented.</p>

  <p>She turned to her brother, who was approaching.</p>

  <p>"Success!" she announced. "Mr. Thain has promised to dine. He refused
  under a misapprehension."</p>

  <p>"We are delighted," the Marquis said. "At a quarter past eight, Mr.
  Thain."</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>

  <p>Gossett in the country was a very different person from Gossett in
  Grosvenor Square. An intimate at Mandeleys was not at all the same thing as a
  caller in town, and David found himself welcomed that evening with a grave
  but confidential smile.</p>

  <p>"The drawing-room here is closed for the present, sir," he observed, after
  he had superintended the bestowal of David's coat and hat upon an underling.
  "We are using the gallery on the left wing. If you will be so kind as to come
  this way."</p>

  <p>David was escorted into a long and very lofty apartment, cut off from the
  hall by some wonderful curtains, obviously of another generation. The walls
  were hung with pictures and old-fashioned weapons. At the far end was a small
  stage, and at the opposite extremity a little box which had apparently at
  some time been used by musicians. Some large beech logs were burning in an
  open fireplace. The room contained nothing in the way of furniture except a
  dozen or so old-fashioned chairs and a great settee.</p>

  <p>"These large rooms," Gossett explained, "get a little damp, sir, so his
  lordship desired a fire here."</p>

  <p>He had scarcely disappeared when a door which led into the gallery was
  opened, and Lady Letitia came slowly down the stairs. The place was lit only
  by hanging lamps, and David's impression of her, as he turned around, were a
  little unsubstantial. All the way down the stairs and across that strip of
  floor, it seemed to him that he could see nothing but her face. She carried
  herself as usual, there was all the pride of generations of Mandeleys in her
  slow, unhurried movements and the carriage of her head. But her
  face.&mdash;David gripped at the back of one of the tall chairs. He made at
  first no movement towards her. This was the face of a woman into which he
  looked. The change there was so complete that the high walls seemed to melt
  away. It was just such a vision as he might have conceived to himself. Her
  words checked the fancies which were pouring into his brain. He became again
  the puzzled but everyday dinner guest.</p>

  <p>"I am very glad that you have come, Mr. Thain," she said, giving him her
  hand, "and I am very glad indeed to see you alone, even if it is only for a
  moment, because I feel&mdash;perhaps it is my thoughts that feel&mdash;that
  they owe you an amende."</p>

  <p>"You are very kind," he replied, a little bewildered. "I am glad to be
  here. What have you ever done which needs apology?"</p>

  <p>"I spoke of my thoughts," she reminded him, with a little smile. "What I
  once thought, or rather feared, I am now ashamed of, and now that I have told
  you so I am more at ease."</p>

  <p>She stood up by his side, little flashes of firelight lighting her soft
  white skin, gleaming upon the soft fabric of her gown. She wore no ornaments.
  The Mandeleys pearls, generally worn by the unmarried women of the family,
  were reposing in the famous vaults of a West End pawnbroker. Her strong,
  capable fingers were innocent of even a single ring, although upon her
  dressing table there was even at that moment reposing a very beautiful pearl
  one, concerning which she had made some insignificant criticism with only one
  object, an object which she refused to admit even to herself. David remained
  silent through sheer wonder. He had a sudden feeling that he had been
  admitted, even if for only these few moments, into the inner circle of her
  toleration&mdash;perhaps even more than that.</p>

  <p>"I hurried down," she explained, "just to say these few words, and I see
  that I was only just in time."</p>

  <p>The curtain had been raised without their noticing it, and the Duchess,
  with Grantham by her side, had entered. There was a slight frown upon the
  latter's forehead; the Duchess was humming softly to herself.</p>

  <p>"Well, Sir Anthony, so you've kept your word," she said to David, when he
  had shaken hands with Grantham. "I can see quite well what the country is
  going to do for you, unless you are looked after. The amiable misanthrope is
  the part you have in your mind. Gracious! Motors outside! Have we got a
  party, Letitia?"</p>

  <p>Letitia, who to David's keen observation seemed already to have lost
  something of that strange new quality which she had shown to him only a few
  moments ago, shook her head.</p>

  <p>"The Vicar and Mrs. Vicar, and the Turnbulls, and Sylvia's father."</p>

  <p>"I am not going to be bored," the Duchess declared firmly. "I insist upon
  sitting next to Mr. Thain. How pretty Sylvia looks! And what a becoming
  colour! Now listen to me, David Thain," she went on, drawing him a little on
  one side, "you are not to flirt with that child. It's like shooting them
  before they begin to fly. You understand?"</p>

  <p>"Not guilty," David protested. "I can assure you that I am a passive
  victim."</p>

  <p>"Silly little goose," the Duchess murmured under her breath, "waiting
  there for you to go and speak to her, with all sorts of sentimental nonsense
  shining out of her great eyes, too. I shall go and talk to old General
  Turnbull till the gong goes. Why we can't have dinner punctually with a small
  party like this, I can't imagine."</p>

  <p>Sylvia was certainly glad to welcome David. Her father came up in a few
  moments and shook hands heartily.</p>

  <p>"Still buy your own cutlets, eh, Mr. Thain?" he asked. "Jolly good cutlets
  they were, too!"</p>

  <p>"I suppose you have a housekeeper and all sorts of things," Sylvia
  laughed, "and live in what they call regal magnificence."</p>

  <p>David's protest was almost eager.</p>

  <p>"I have a man and his wife who came down with me from London," he said,
  "and one or two servants&mdash;very few, I can assure you. Won't you come and
  try my housekeeping, Colonel, before you move on, and bring Miss Sylvia?"</p>

  <p>"With pleasure, my boy," the Colonel declared. "We leave for town next
  Saturday. Any day between now and then that suits Sylvia."</p>

  <p>Dinner was announced, and David found himself placed at a round table
  between the Duchess and Sylvia. The former looked around the banqueting hall
  with a shiver.</p>

  <p>"Reginald," she protested, "why on earth do you plant us in the middle of
  a vault like this? Why on earth not open up some of the smaller rooms?"</p>

  <p>The Marquis smiled deprecatingly. His extreme pallor of the last few days
  had disappeared. He seemed younger, and his tone was more alert.</p>

  <p>"This room is really a weakness of mine," he confessed. "I like a vaulted
  roof, and I rather like the shadows. It isn't damp, if that is what you are
  thinking of, Caroline. We have had fires in it ever since we came
  down&mdash;timber being the only thing for which we don't have to pay," he
  added.</p>

  <p>"It makes one feel so insignificant," the Duchess sighed. "If you were
  dining fifty or sixty people, of course, I should love it, but a dozen of
  us&mdash;why, we seem like spectral mites! Look at old Grand-Uncle Philip
  staring at us," she went on, gazing at one of the huge pictures opposite.
  "Pity you cannot afford to have electric light here, Reginald, and have it
  set in the frames."</p>

  <p>"A most unpleasant idea!" her brother objected. "Confess, now, if you
  could see two rows of ancestors, all illuminated, looking at you while you
  ate, wouldn't it make you feel greedy?"</p>

  <p>The conversation drifted away and became general. The Duchess leaned
  towards her neighbour.</p>

  <p>"I think I am rather sorry I came here," she whispered.</p>

  <p>"Why?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Because I find you disappointing. I thoroughly enjoyed discovering you
  upon the steamer. You were delightfully primitive, an absolute cave-dweller,
  but you quite repaid my efforts to make a human being of you. You were really
  almost as interesting when we first met in London. And now, I don't know what
  it is, but you seem to have gone thousands of miles away again. You don't
  seem properly human. Don't you like women, or have you got some queer scheme
  in your head which keeps you living like a man with his head in the clouds?
  Or are you in love?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't settled down to idleness yet, perhaps," he suggested.</p>

  <p>"Of course," she went on, "you ought to be in love with me, and miserable
  about it, but I am horribly afraid you aren't. I believe you have matrimonial
  schemes in your mind. I believe that your affections are so well-trained that
  they mean to trot all along the broad way to St. George's, Hanover
  Square."</p>

  <p>"And would you advise something different?" he asked bluntly.</p>

  <p>"My dear man, why am I here?" she expostulated. "I have a fancy for having
  you devoted to me. What I mean to do with it when I have captured your heart,
  I am not quite sure."</p>

  <p>Every one was listening to a story which old General Turnbull was telling.
  Even Sylvia had leaned across the table. David turned and looked steadily
  into his companion's face.</p>

  <p>"It seems to me," he said, "that only a very short time ago, Duchess, out
  of solicitude for my extreme ignorance, you warned me against setting my
  affections too high."</p>

  <p>"I was speaking then of marriage," she replied coolly.</p>

  <p>"I see! And yet," he went on, "I am not quite sure that I do see. Is there
  any radical difference between marriage and a really intimate friendship
  between a man and a woman?"</p>

  <p>She smiled. Her slight movement towards him was almost a caress.</p>

  <p>"My dear, unsophisticated cave-dweller!" she murmured. "Marriage is an
  alliance which lasts for all time. It is apt, is it not, to leave its stamp
  upon future generations. Great friendships have existed amongst people
  curiously diverse in tastes and temperament and position. A certain
  disparity, in fact, is rather the vogue."</p>

  <p>"I begin to understand," he admitted. "That accounts for the curious club
  stories which one is always having dinned into one's ears, hatefully
  uninteresting though they are, of Lady So-and-So entertaining a great fiddler
  at her country house, or some other Society lady dancing in a singular lack
  of costume for the pleasure of artists in a borrowed studio."</p>

  <p>"You are not nearly so nice-minded as I thought you were," the Duchess
  snapped.</p>

  <p>"It is just my painful efforts to understand," he protested.</p>

  <p>"Any one but an idiot would have understood long ago," she retorted.</p>

  <p>David turned to his left-hand neighbour.</p>

  <p>"The Duchess is being unkind," he said. "Will you please take some notice
  of me?"</p>

  <p>"I'd love to," she replied. "I was just thinking that you were rather
  neglecting me. I want to know all about America, please, and American
  people."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," he told her, "that I know much more about America than I do
  about American people. All my life, since I left Harvard, I have been busy
  making money. I never went into Society over there. I never accepted an
  invitation if I could help it. When I had any time to spare I went and camped
  out, up in the Adirondacks, or further afield still, when I could. We had
  lots of sport, and we were able to lead a simple life, well away from the end
  of the cable."</p>

  <p>"And you killed bears and things, I suppose?" she said. "How lucky that
  you are fond of sport! It makes living in England so easy."</p>

  <p>He smiled.</p>

  <p>"I am not so sure," he confessed, "that I should consider England quite so
  much of a sporting country as she thinks herself."</p>

  <p>"What heresy!" the Marquis exclaimed, leaning forward.</p>

  <p>"Of course, I didn't know that I was going to be overheard," David said
  good-humouredly, "but I must stick to it. I mean, of course, sport as apart
  from games."</p>

  <p>"Shooting?" the Marquis queried.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I don't consider that shooting at birds, half of them
  hand-reared, is much of a sport," David continued. "Have you ever tried
  pig-sticking, or lying on the edge of a mountain after three hours' tramp,
  watching for the snout of a bear?"</p>

  <p>Letitia had broken off her conversation with Lord Charles and was leaning
  a little forward. The Marquis nodded sympathetically.</p>

  <p>"Hunting, then?"</p>

  <p>David smiled.</p>

  <p>"You gallop over a pastoral country on a highly-trained animal, with a
  pack of assistant hounds to destroy one miserable, verminous creature," he
  said. "Of course, you take risks now and then, and the whole thing looks
  exceedingly nice on a Christmas card, but for thrills, for real, intense
  excitement, I prefer the mountain ledge and the bear, or the rounding up of a
  herd of wild elephants."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Thain preserves the instincts of the savage," the Duchess observed,
  as she sipped her wine. "Perhaps he may be right. Civilisation certainly
  tends to emasculate sport."</p>

  <p>"The sports to which Mr. Thain has alluded," the Marquis pointed out, "are
  the sports of the stay-at-home Englishman. Most of our younger
  generation&mdash;those whose careers permitted of it&mdash;have tried their
  hand at big game shooting. I myself," he continued reminiscently, "have never
  felt quite the same with a shotgun and a stream of pheasants, since a very
  wonderful three weeks I had in my youth, tiger hunting in India.&mdash;I see
  that Letitia is trying to catch your eye, Caroline."</p>

  <p>The women left the room in a little group, their figures merging almost
  into indistinctness as they passed out of the lighted zone. David's eyes
  followed Letitia until she had disappeared. Then he was conscious that a
  servant was standing with a note on a salver by his side.</p>

  <p>"This has been sent down from Broomleys, sir," the man explained.</p>

  <p>David took it and felt a sudden sinking of the heart. The envelope was
  thin, square and of common type, the writing was painstaking but irregular.
  There was a smudge on one corner, a blot on another. David glanced at the
  Marquis, who nodded and immediately commenced a conversation with Grantham.
  He tore open his message and read it:</p><br>

  <p>"The time has arrived. I wait for you here."</p><br>

  <p>He crushed the half-sheet of notepaper in his fingers and then dropped it
  into his pocket.</p>

  <p>"There is no answer," he told the servant.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>

  <p>Grantham, who had been unusually silent throughout the service of dinner,
  slipped away from the room a few minutes before the other men. He found
  Letitia arranging a bridge table, and drew her a little on one side.</p>

  <p>"Letitia," he said, "I am annoyed."</p>

  <p>"My dear Charles," she replied, "was anything ever more obvious!"</p>

  <p>"You perhaps do not realise," he continued, "that you are the cause."</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"In the first place," he complained, "you are not wearing my ring."</p>

  <p>"I thought I told you," she reminded him, "that I would prefer not to
  until we formally announced our engagement."</p>

  <p>"Why on earth shouldn't we do that at once&mdash;this evening?" he
  suggested. "I can see no reason for delay."</p>

  <p>"I, on the other hand, have a fancy to wait," she replied carelessly, "at
  least until your visit here is over.</p>

  <p>"Your hesitation is scarcely flattering," he remarked with some
  irritation.</p>

  <p>"Is there anything else you wish to say?" she enquired. "I really must get
  out those bridge markers."</p>

  <p>He began to show signs of temper. Watching him closely for the first time,
  Letitia decided that he had most unpleasant-looking eyes.</p>

  <p>"I should like to know the subject of your conversation with that Thain
  fellow when I came in this evening," he demanded.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," she said coolly. "We were speaking upon a private
  subject."</p>

  <p>The anger in his eyes became more evident.</p>

  <p>"Private subject? You mean to say that you have secrets with a fellow like
  that?"</p>

  <p>"A fellow like that?" she repeated. "You don't like Mr. Thain, then?"</p>

  <p>"Like him? I don't like him or dislike him. I think he ought to be very
  flattered to be here at all&mdash;and you are the last person in the world,
  Letitia, I should have expected to find talking in whispers with him, with
  your heads only a few inches apart. I feel quite justified in asking what
  that confidence indicated."</p>

  <p>Letitia smiled sweetly but dangerously.</p>

  <p>"And I feel quite justified," she retorted, "in refusing to answer that or
  any similar question. Are you going to play bridge, Charlie?"</p>

  <p>"No!" he replied, turning away. "I am going to talk to Miss Laycey."</p>

  <p>Sylvia was quite willing, and they soon established themselves on a
  settee. The Duchess, rather against her inclinations, was included in the
  bridge quartette. Letitia, having disposed of her guests, strolled over
  towards David, who was standing with his hands behind him, gloomily studying
  one of the paintings.</p>

  <p>"I must show you our Vandykes, Mr. Thain," she said, leading him a little
  further away. "When these wonderful oil shares of yours have made us all
  rich, we shall have little electric globes round our old masters. Until then,
  I find it produces quite a curious effect to try one of these."</p>

  <p>She drew an electric torch from one of the drawers of an oak cabinet and
  flashed a small circle of light upon the picture. Thain gave a little
  exclamation. The face which seemed to spring suddenly into life, looking down
  upon them with a faintly repressed smile upon the Mandeleys mouth, presented
  an almost startling likeness to the Marquis.</p>

  <p>"Fearfully alike, all our menkind, aren't they?" she observed, lowering
  the torch. "Come and I will show you a Lely."</p>

  <p>They passed further down the gallery. She looked at him a little
  curiously.</p>

  <p>"Is it my fancy," she asked, "or have you something on your mind? The note
  which reached you contained no ill news, I hope?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," he answered, with unexpected candour. "I have a great deal
  on my mind."</p>

  <p>"I am so sorry," she murmured.</p>

  <p>They had reached the further end of the gallery now. She sank into the
  window seat and made room for him by her side. For a moment he looked out
  across the park. In the moonless night the trees were like little dark blurs,
  the country rose and fell like a turbulent sea. And very close at hand,
  ominously close at hand as it seemed to him, a bright light from Richard
  Vont's cottage was burning steadily.</p>

  <p>"Let me ask you a question," he begged a little abruptly. "Supposing that
  you had given your word of honour, solemnly, in return for a vital service
  rendered, to commit a dishonourable action; what should you do?"</p>

  <p>"Well, that is rather a dilemma, isn't it?" she acknowledged. "To tell you
  the truth, I can't quite reconcile the circumstances. I can't, for instance,
  conceive your promising to do a dishonourable thing."</p>

  <p>"At the time," he explained, "it did not seem dishonourable. At the time
  it seemed just an act of justice. Then circumstances changed, new
  considerations intervened, and the whole situation was altered."</p>

  <p>"Is it a monetary matter?" she enquired, "one in which money would make
  any difference, I mean?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Money has nothing to do with it," he replied. "It is just a question
  whether one is justified in breaking a solemn oath, one's word of honour,
  because the action which it entails has become, owing to later circumstances,
  hideously repugnant."</p>

  <p>"Why ask my advice?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know. Anyhow, I desire it."</p>

  <p>"I should go," she said thoughtfully, "to the person to whom I had bound
  myself, and I should explain the change in my feelings and in the
  circumstances. I should beg to be released from my word."</p>

  <p>"And if they refused?"</p>

  <p>"I don't see how you could possibly break your word of honour," she
  decided reluctantly. "It is not done, is it?"</p>

  <p>He looked steadily down the gallery, through the darkened portion, to
  where the soft, overhead lights fell upon the two card tables. There was very
  little conversation. They could even hear the soft fall of the cards and
  Sylvia's musical laugh in the background. All the time Letitia watched him.
  The strength of his face seemed only intensified by his angry indecision.</p>

  <p>"You are right," he assented finally. "I must not."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," she suggested, "you can find some way of keeping it, and yet
  keeping it without that secondary dishonour you spoke of. Now I must really
  go and see that my guests are behaving properly."</p>

  <p>She rose to her feet. Sylvia's laugh rang out again from the far corner of
  the gallery, where she and Grantham were seated, their heads very close
  together. Letitia watched them for a moment tolerantly.</p>

  <p>"I will recall my fianc&eacute; to his duty," she declared, "and you can
  go and talk nonsense to Sylvia."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," he answered, "I am afraid that I am not in the humour to talk
  nonsense with anybody."</p>

  <p>She turned her head slightly and looked at him.</p>

  <p>"Sylvia is such an admirer of yours," she said, "and she has such a
  delightful way of being light-hearted herself and affecting others in the
  same fashion. If I were a man&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>"I should marry Sylvia."</p>

  <p>"And if I," he declared, with a sudden flash in his eyes, "possessed that
  ridiculous family tree of Lord Charles Grantham's&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"I should marry you."</p>

  <p>She looked at him through half-closed eyes. There was a little smile on
  her lips which at first he thought insolent, but concerning which afterwards
  he permitted himself to speculate. He stopped short.</p>

  <p>"Lady Letitia," he pleaded, "there is a door there which leads into the
  hall. You don't expect manners of me, anyway, but could you accept my
  farewell and excuse me to the others? I have really a serious reason for
  wishing to leave&mdash;a reason connected with the note I received at dinner
  time."</p>

  <p>"Of course," she answered, "but you are sure that you are well? There is
  nothing that we can do for you?"</p>

  <p>He paused for a moment with his hand upon the fastening of the door.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing anybody can do for me, Lady Letitia," he said.
  "Good-by!"</p>

  <p>She stood for a moment, watching the door through which he had passed with
  a puzzled frown upon her face. Then she continued her progress down the room.
  Arrived at the bridge table, she stooped for a moment to look over her aunt's
  score.</p>

  <p>"Finished your flirtation, my dear?" the latter asked coolly.</p>

  <p>Letitia accepted the challenge.</p>

  <p>"So effectually," she replied, "that the poor man has gone home. I am to
  present his excuses to every one."</p>

  <p>The Duchess paused for a moment in the playing of her hand. Her brother,
  with unfailing tact, threw himself into the breach.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," he said, "that we can scarcely realise the responsibilities
  which these kings of finance carry always upon their shoulders. They tell me
  that Mr. Thain has his telegrams and cables stopped in London by a secretary
  and telephoned here, just to save a few minutes. He receives sometimes as
  many as half a dozen messages during the night."</p>

  <p>The Duchess continued to play her hand.</p>

  <p>"After all," she remarked, "I fear that I shall not be able to ask Mr.
  Thain to Scotland. One would feel the responsibility so much if he were to
  lose anything he valued, by coming."</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>

  <p>Richard Vont, as though he had been sitting there listening for the
  raising of the latch, was on his feet before David could enter the sitting
  room.</p>

  <p>"The Lord's day has come," he muttered, dragging him in. "It's been a
  weary while, but it's come."</p>

  <p>David threw off his overcoat in silence, and the old man looked
  wonderingly at his clothes.</p>

  <p>"You've been taking your dinner up with them&mdash;at the house?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>David nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he assented. "Your note found me there. I came as soon as I
  could."</p>

  <p>"I never doubted ye," the old man muttered. "I knew you'd come."</p>

  <p>David, suddenly stifled, threw open the cottage window. When he came back
  into the little circle of lamp-light, his face was pale and set. He was
  filled with a premonition of evil.</p>

  <p>"I want you to listen to me, uncle," he said earnestly. "I have something
  to say."</p>

  <p>"Something to say?" the old man repeated. "Another time, my
  boy&mdash;-another time. To-night you have work to do," he added, with a
  fierce flash of triumph in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Work?"</p>

  <p>"Aye!&mdash;to keep your oath."</p>

  <p>"But to-night? What can I do to-night?" David exclaimed. "No, don't tell
  me," he went on quickly. "I'll have my say first."</p>

  <p>"Get on with it, then. There's time. I'm listening."</p>

  <p>"I have forgotten nothing," David began, "I am denying nothing. I remember
  even the words of the oath I swore."</p>

  <p>"With your hand upon the Bible," Vont interrupted eagerly,&mdash;"your
  hand upon the Book."</p>

  <p>David shivered.</p>

  <p>"I am not likely to forget that night," he said. "What I swore we both
  know. Well? I have begun to keep my word. You know that."</p>

  <p>"Aye, and to-night you'll finish it!" Vont cried, with uplifted head.
  "After to-night you'll be quit of your oath, and you can go free of me. I've
  made it all easy for you. It's all planned out."</p>

  <p>"I must finish what I have to say," David insisted. "It's been on my mind
  like lead. He's a ruined man, uncle&mdash;beggared to the last penny. I've
  dishonoured myself, but I've done it&mdash;for your sake. Beyond that I
  cannot go."</p>

  <p>"You cannot go?" Vont muttered blankly.</p>

  <p>"I cannot. I don't know what this scheme of yours is, uncle, but leave me
  out of it. I'm in Hell already!"</p>

  <p>"You think&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Vont was breathing heavily. The words suddenly failed him, his fingers
  seemed to grip the air. David had a momentary shock of terror. Then, before
  he could stop him, the old man was down upon his knees, holding him by the
  legs, his upraised face horrible with a new storm of passion.</p>

  <p>"David, you'll not back out! You'll not break that oath you swore when I
  lent you the money&mdash;all my savings! And it might have gone wrong, you
  know. It might have beggared me. But I risked it for this! You don't know
  what I've been through. I tell you there isn't a night, from darkness till
  nigh the dawn, I haven't toiled with these hands, toiled while the sweat's
  run off my forehead and my breath's gone from me. And I've done it! I've made
  all ready for you&mdash;and to- night&mdash;it's to-night, boy! If you go
  back on me, David, as sure as that Book's the truth, you shall know what it
  is to feel like a murderer, for I'll sit and face you, and I'll die! I mean
  it. As God hears me at this moment, I mean it. If you falter to-night, you
  shall find me dead to-morrow, and if it blackens my lips, I'll die cursing
  you as well as him&mdash;you for your softness because they've flattered you
  round, him because he still lives, with the wrong he did me unpunished."</p>

  <p>David dragged him up by sheer force and pushed him back into his
  chair.</p>

  <p>"What is it you want me to do?" he asked in despair.</p>

  <p>"You can't refuse me," Vont went on, his voice strong enough now. "Watch
  me and listen," he added, leaning forward. "There's my hand on the Book.
  Here's my right hand to Heaven, and I swear by the living God that if you
  fail me, you shall find me to-morrow, sitting dead. That's what your broken
  oath will do."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I hear," David answered drearily. "I'll keep my word. Come, what is
  it?"</p>

  <p>Vont rose deliberately to his feet. All trace of passion seemed to have
  disappeared. He took an electric torch from his pocket and led the way to the
  door.</p>

  <p>"Just follow me," he whispered.</p>

  <p>They made their way down the little tiled path to the bottom of the
  garden. In the right-hand corner was what seemed to be the top of a well.</p>

  <p>"You remember that, perhaps?"</p>

  <p>David nodded.</p>

  <p>"I know," he said. "I used to play down there once."</p>

  <p>Vont rolled the top away, and, stooping down, flashed the light. There
  were stone steps leading to a small opening, and at the bottom the mouth of
  what seemed to be a tunnel. David started.</p>

  <p>"It's one of the secret passages to Mandeleys!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"There are seven of them somewhere," his uncle replied, in a hoarse
  undertone&mdash;"one, they say, from Broomleys, but that's too far, and the
  air would be too foul, and maybe it don't lead where I want it to. I've made
  air-holes along this, David. You take the torch, and you make your way.
  There's nothing to stop you. It's dry&mdash;I've sprinkled sand in
  places&mdash;and there's air, too. When you come to the end there's a door.
  Four nights it took me to move that door. It's wide open now. Then you mount
  a little flight of stairs. They go round and round, and at the top there's a
  little stone landing. You'll see before you what seems to be blank wall. You
  press your palms on it&mdash;so&mdash;and soon you find an iron handle. It'll
  turn easy&mdash;I've oiled it well&mdash;and you step right into the
  room."</p>

  <p>"What room?" David demanded, in bewilderment.</p>

  <p>The old man's fingers clutched his arm.</p>

  <p>"Into the bedchamber of the Lady Letitia Mandeleys!" he proclaimed
  triumphantly. "Keep your voice low, boy. Remember we are out of doors."</p>

  <p>"Into the&mdash;! Are you mad, uncle?" David muttered, catching at his
  voice as though it were some loose quality that had escaped from him.</p>

  <p>"There's never a saner man in this county," was the fierce reply. "It's
  what I've worked for. It's the worst blow I can deal his pride. Oh, I know
  she is a haughty lady! You'll step into her chamber, and she'll see you, and
  she'll shriek for her servants, but&mdash;but, David," he added, leaning
  forward, "they'll find you there&mdash;they'll find you there! The
  Marquis&mdash;he'll be told. The nephew of Richard Vont will be found in his
  daughter's chamber! There'll be explanations enough, but those things
  stick."</p>

  <p>David suddenly found himself laughing like a madman.</p>

  <p>"Uncle," he cried, "for God's sake&mdash;for Heaven's sake, listen to me.
  This is the maddest scheme that ever entered into any one's head. I should be
  treated simply like a common burglar. I should have no excuse to offer,
  nothing to say. I should be thrown out of the house, and there isn't a human
  being breathing who'd think the worse of the Lady Letitia. You don't know
  what she's like! She's wonderful! She's&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'll not argue with you, boy," Vont interrupted doggedly. "You think I
  know nothing of the world and its ways, of the tale-bearing and the
  story-telling that goes on, women backbiting each other, men grasping even at
  shadows for a sensation. You'll do your job, David, you'll keep your oath,
  and from to-night you'll stand free of me. There'll be no more. You can lift
  your head again after you've crossed that threshold. Make what excuse you
  like&mdash;come back, if you will, like a frightened hare after they've found
  you there&mdash;but you'll have stood in her bedchamber!"</p>

  <p>David shivered like a man in a fever. He was beginning to realise that
  this was no nightmare&mdash;that the wild-eyed man by his side was in sober
  and ghastly earnest.</p>

  <p>"Uncle," he pleaded, "not this. Lady Letitia has been kind and gracious to
  me always. We can't strike through women. I'd rather you bade me take his
  life."</p>

  <p>"But I don't bid you do anything of the sort," was the sullen reply.
  "Death's no punishment to any man, and the like of him's too brave to feel
  the fear of it. It's through her the blow must come, and you'll do my
  bidding, David, or you'll see me sitting waiting for you to-morrow, with a
  last message to you upon my dead lips."</p>

  <p>David gripped the torch from his hand. After all, Hell might come to any
  man!</p>

  <p>"I'll go," he said.</p>

  <p>It was a nightmare that followed. Stooping only a little, flashing his
  torch always in front, he half ran, half scrambled along a paved way, between
  paved walls which even the damp of centuries seemed scarcely to have entered.
  Soon the path descended steeply and then rose on the other side of the moat.
  Once a rat paused to look at him with eyes gleaming like diamonds, and bolted
  at the flash of the torch. More than once he fancied that he heard footsteps
  echoing behind him. He paused to listen. There was nothing. He lost sense of
  time or distance. He stole on, dreading the end&mdash;and the end came sooner
  even than he had feared. There was the door that yielded easily to his touch,
  the steep steps round and round the interior of the tower, the blank wall
  before him. The iron handle was there. His hands closed upon it. For a moment
  he stood in terrible silence. This was something worse than death! Then he
  set his teeth firmly, pressed the handle and stepped through the wall.</p>

  <p>Afterwards it seemed to him that there must have been something mortally
  terrifying in his own appearance as he stood there with his back to the wall
  and his eyes fixed upon the solitary occupant of the room. Lady Letitia, in a
  blue dressing gown, was lying upon a couch drawn up before a small log fire.
  There seemed to be no detail of the room which in those sickening moments of
  mental absorption was not photographed into his memory. The old four-poster
  bedstead, hung with chintz; the long, black dressing table, once a dresser,
  covered carelessly with tortoise-shell backed toilet articles, with a large
  mirror in the centre from which a chair had just been pushed back. But, above
  all, that look in her face, from which every other expression seemed to have
  permanently fled. Her lips were parted, her eyes were round with horrified
  surprise. The book which she had been reading slipped from her fingers and
  fell noiselessly on to the hearth-rug. She sat up, supporting herself with
  her hands, one on either side, pressed into the sofa. She seemed denied the
  power of speech, almost as he was. And then a sudden wonderful change came to
  him. He spoke quite distinctly, although he kept his voice low.</p>

  <p>"Lady Letitia," he said, "let me explain. I shall never ask for your
  forgiveness. I shall never venture to approach you again. I have come here by
  the secret passage from Vont's cottage. I have come here to keep an oath
  which I swore in America to Richard Vont, and I have come because, if I had
  broken my word, he would have killed himself."</p>

  <p>He spoke with so little emotion, so reasonably, that she found herself
  answering him, notwithstanding her bewilderment, almost in the same key.</p>

  <p>"But who are you?" she demanded. "Who are you to be the slave of that old
  man?"</p>

  <p>"I am his nephew," David answered. "I am the little boy who played about
  the park when you were a girl, who picked you up on the ice once when you
  fell. All that I have I owe to Richard Vont. He sent me to college. He lent
  me the money upon which I built my fortune, but on the day he lent it to me
  he made me swear a terrible oath, and to-night he has forced me to keep it by
  setting foot within your chamber. Now I shall return the way I came, and may
  God grant that some day you will forgive me."</p>

  <p>Almost as he spoke there was a little click behind. He started round and
  felt along the wall. There was a moment's silence. Then he turned once more
  towards Letitia, his cheeks whiter than ever, his sunken eyes filled with a
  new horror. Even the composure which had enabled him to explain his coming
  with some show of reason, had deserted him. He seemed threatened with a sort
  of hysteria.</p>

  <p>"He followed me! Damn him, he followed me!" he muttered. "I heard
  footsteps. He has fastened us in!"</p>

  <p>He tore desperately at the tapestry, shook the concealed door and rattled
  it, in vain. Letitia rose slowly to her feet.</p>

  <p>"You see what has happened," she said. "Richard Vont was more cunning than
  you. He was not content that you should make your little speech and creep
  back amongst the rats. Tell me, what do you propose to do?"</p>

  <p>He looked around him helplessly.</p>

  <p>"There is the window," he muttered.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"We are on the second story," she told him, "and there is nothing to break
  your fall upon the flags below. To be found with a broken neck beneath my
  window would be almost as bad as anything that could happen."</p>

  <p>"I am not afraid to try," he declared.</p>

  <p>He moved towards the window. She crossed the room swiftly and intercepted
  him.</p>

  <p>"Don't be absurd," she admonished. "Come, let us think. There must be a
  way."</p>

  <p>"Let me out of your room on to the landing," he begged eagerly. "If I can
  reach the hall it will be all right. I can find a window open, or hide
  somewhere. Only, for God's sake," he added, his voice breaking, "let me out
  of this room!"</p>

  <p>A flash of her old manner came back to her.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry you find it so unattractive," she said. "I thought it rather
  pretty myself. And blue, after all, is my colour, you know, although I don't
  often wear it."</p>

  <p>"Oh, bless you!" he exclaimed. "Bless you, Lady Letitia, for speaking to
  me as though I were a human being. Now I am going to steal out of that door
  on tiptoe."</p>

  <p>"Wait till I have listened there," she whispered.</p>

  <p>She stole past him and stooped down with her ear to the keyhole. She
  frowned for a moment and held out her hand warningly. It seemed to him that
  he could feel his heart beating. Close to where he was standing, her silk
  stockings were hanging over the back of a chair.&mdash;He suddenly closed his
  eyes, covered them desperately with the palms of his hand. Her warning finger
  was still extended.</p>

  <p>"That was some one passing," she said. "I don't understand why. They all
  came to bed some time ago. Stay where you are and don't move."</p>

  <p>They both listened. David seemed in those few minutes to have lost all the
  composure which had become the habit of years. His heart was beating madly.
  He was shaking as though with intense cold. Lady Letitia, on the other hand,
  seemed almost unruffled. Only he fancied that at the back of her eyes there
  was something to which as yet she had given no expression, something which
  terrified him. Then, as they stood there, neither of them daring to move,
  there came a sudden awful sound. It had seemed to him that the world could
  hold no greater horror than he was already suffering, but the sound to which
  they listened was paralysing, hideous, stupefying. With hoarse, brazen note,
  rusty and wheezy, yet pulled as though with some desperate clutch, the great
  alarm bell which hung over the courtyard was tolling its dreadful
  summons.</p>

  <p>Letitia stood up, her cheeks ghastly pale. She, too, was struggling now
  for composure.</p>

  <p>"Really," she exclaimed, "this is an evening full of
  incidents.&mdash;Don't touch me," she added. "I shall be all right
  directly."</p>

  <p>For a single moment he knew that she had nearly fainted. She caught at the
  side of the wall. Then they heard a cry from outside. A spark flew past the
  window. A hoarse voice from somewhere below shouted "Fire!" And then
  something more alarming still. All down the corridor, doors were thrown open.
  There was the sound of eager voices&mdash;finally a loud knocking at the door
  which they were guarding. Letitia shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"This," she murmured, "is fate."</p>

  <p>She opened the door. There was a little confused group outside. The
  Marquis, fully dressed, stood with his eyes fixed upon Thain at first in
  blank astonishment,&mdash;afterwards as one who looks upon some horrible
  thing. Grantham in a dressing gown, took a quick step forward.</p>

  <p>"My God, it's Thain!" he exclaimed. "What in hell's name&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>Letitia turned towards her father.</p>

  <p>"Father," she began&mdash;</p>

  <p>The Marquis made no movement, yet she was suddenly aware of something in
  his expression, something which shone more dimly in the face of her aunt,
  which throbbed in Grantham's incoherent words. Her brave little speech died
  away. She staggered. The Marquis still made no movement. It was David who
  caught her in his arms and carried her to the couch. He turned and faced
  them. In the background, Sylvia was clinging to Grantham's arm.</p>

  <p>"You gibbering fools!" he cried. "What if an accursed chance has brought
  me here! Isn't she Lady Letitia, your daughter, Marquis? Isn't she your
  betrothed, Grantham? Your niece, Duchess? Do you think that anything but the
  rankest and most accursed accident could ever have brought me within reach
  even of her fingers?"</p>

  <p>No one spoke. The faces into which he looked seemed to David like a
  hideous accusation. Suddenly Gossett's voice was heard from behind.</p>

  <p>"The fire is nothing, your lordship. It is already extinguished. Some one
  seems to have brought some blazing brambles and thrown them into the
  courtyard."</p>

  <p>"Get some water, you fools!" Thain shouted. "Can't you see that she is
  faint?"</p>

  <p>The Duchess began to collect herself. She advanced further into the room
  in search of restoratives. The Marquis came a step nearer to Thain.</p>

  <p>"Tell me how you found your way into this room, sir?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"By the foulest means on God's earth," Thain answered. "I came through the
  secret passage from Vont's cottage."</p>

  <p>"Without Lady Letitia's knowledge, I presume?" Grantham interposed
  hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"No one but a cad would have asked such a question," David thundered. "I
  broke into her room, meaning to deliver one brief message and to go back
  again. Vont followed me and fastened the door.&mdash;Can't you read the
  story?" he added, turning appealingly to the Marquis. "Don't you know who I
  am? I am Vont's nephew, the boy who played about here years ago. I lived with
  him in America. He paid for my education at Harvard; he lent me the money to
  make my first venture. He has been all the relative I ever had. Out there I
  pledged my word blindly to help him in his revenge upon you, Marquis, in
  whatever manner he might direct. To-night he sprung this upon me. I was face
  to face with my word of honour, and the certainty that if I refused to fulfil
  my pledge he would kill himself before morning. So I came. It was he who rang
  the alarm bell, he who planned the pretence of a fire to trap me here. This
  was to be his vengeance.&mdash;Be reasonable. Don't take this miserable
  affair seriously. God knows what I have suffered, these last few
  minutes!"</p>

  <p>Letitia sat up, revived. She was still very pale, and there was something
  terrible in her face.</p>

  <p>"For heaven's sake," she begged, "bring this wretched melodrama to an end.
  Turn that poor man out," she added, pointing to David. "His story is quite
  true."</p>

  <p>Every one had gone except the Marquis and Grantham. Neither of them spoke
  for several moments. Then the Marquis, as though he were awaking from a
  dream, moved to the door, opened it and beckoned to David.</p>

  <p>"Will you follow me," he invited.</p>

  <p>Very slowly they passed along the great corridor, down the broad stairs
  and into the hall. The Marquis led the way to the front door and opened it.
  Neither had spoken. To Thain, every moment was a moment of agony. The Marquis
  held the door open and stood on one side. David realised that he was expected
  to depart without a word.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing more I can say?" he faltered despairingly.</p>

  <p>The Marquis stood upon his own threshold. He spoke slowly and with a
  curious lack of expression.</p>

  <p>"Nothing. It is the times that are to blame. We open our houses and offer
  our hospitality to servants and the sons of servants, and we expect them to
  understand our code. We are very foolish.&mdash;Since you have broken this
  silence, let me spare myself the necessity of further words. If your
  contrition is genuine, you will break the lease of Broomleys and depart from
  this neighbourhood without further delay. My agent will wait upon you."</p>

  <p>Without haste, yet before any reply was possible, the Marquis had closed
  the great door. David was once more in the darkness, staggering as though his
  knees would give way. The avenue stretched unevenly before him. He started
  off towards Broomleys.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>

  <p>At a few minutes after nine, the following morning, the Marquis entered
  the room where breakfast was usually served. The Duchess, in travelling
  clothes and a hat, was lifting the covers from the silver dishes upon the
  sideboard, with a fork in her hand. She welcomed him a little shortly.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Reginald!"</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Caroline," he replied. "Are you the only representative of
  the household?"</p>

  <p>She snorted.</p>

  <p>"Charlie Grantham went off in his little two-seater at eight o'clock this
  morning," she announced. "He is motoring up to town. Left apologies with
  Gossett, I believe&mdash;telegram or something in the night. All
  fiddlesticks, of course!"</p>

  <p>"Naturally," the Marquis assented, helping himself from one of the dishes
  and drawing his chair up to his sister's side. "So exit Charles Grantham,
  eh?"</p>

  <p>"And me," the Duchess declared, returning to her place and pouring out the
  coffee. "I suppose you can send me to Fakenham for the ten o'clock
  train?"</p>

  <p>The Marquis considered for a moment.</p>

  <p>"I am not sure, Caroline," he said, "that your departure is entirely
  kind."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm jolly certain I don't mean it to be," she answered bitterly. "I
  ask no questions, and I hate scenes. A week ago I should have scoffed at the
  idea of David Thain as a prospective suitor for Letitia. Now, my advice to
  you is, the sooner you can get them married, the better."</p>

  <p>"Really!" he murmured. "You've given up the idea, then, of taking the
  young man to Scotland?"</p>

  <p>"Entirely," the Duchess assured him emphatically. "I was an idiot to ever
  consider it. When people of his class find their way amongst us, disaster
  nearly always follows. You see, they don't know the rules of the game, as we
  play it. Whilst we are on this subject, Reginald, what are you going to do
  about it?"</p>

  <p>The Marquis unlocked his letter case and shook out the contents.</p>

  <p>"You mean about last night?" he asked. "Well, as I don't want to be the
  laughing-stock of the county, I shall keep as quiet as I can. I knew that
  something ridiculous would happen, with that poor lunatic sitting in the
  garden, poring over the Bible all day long."</p>

  <p>The Duchess looked distinctly malicious.</p>

  <p>"I am not at all as sure as I should like to be," she said, "that the old
  man is to blame for everything."</p>

  <p>The Marquis looked at his sister intently. She bent over the milk jug.</p>

  <p>"You leave me in some doubt, Caroline," he observed coldly, "as to what
  frame of mind you are in, when you make such utterly incomprehensible remarks
  and curtail your visit to us so suddenly. At the same time, I hope that
  whatever your private feelings may be, you will not forget
  certain&mdash;shall I call them obligations?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't be afraid!" she rejoined. "I am not likely to advertise my
  folly, especially at Letitia's expense. I don't care a jot whether the young
  man came through a hole in the wall or dropped down from the clouds. I only
  know that his presence in Letitia's bedchamber&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We will drop the discussion, if you please," the Marquis interrupted.</p>

  <p>There was just the one note in his tone, an inheritance, perhaps, from
  those more virile ancestors, which reduced even his sister to silence. The
  Marquis adjusted his eyeglass and commenced a leisurely inspection of his
  letters. He did so without any anxiety, without the slightest premonition of
  evil. Even when he recognised her handwriting, he did so with a little thrill
  of pleasurable anticipation. He drew the letter closer to him and with a word
  of excuse turned away towards the window. Perhaps she was wanting him. After
  all, it would be quite easy to run up to London for a day&mdash;and
  wonderfully pleasant. He drew the single sheet from its envelope. The letters
  seemed magnified. The whole significance of those cruel words seemed to reach
  him with a single mental effort.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">Reginald, I was married to James Borden this morning. I
  suppose it is the uncivilised part of me which has been pulling at my
  heartstrings, day by day, week by week, the savage in me clamouring for its
  right before it is too late.</p>

  <p class="letter">So we change positions, only whereas you have atoned and
  justified every one of your actions towards me since our eyes first met, I am
  left without any means of atonement.</p>

  <p class="letter">Will you forgive?</p>

  <p class="letter">Your very humble and penitent<br>
  <small>MARCIA.</small></p><br>

  <p>The Marquis replaced the letter in the envelope. For several moments he
  stood looking across the park, beyond, to the well-cultivated farms rolling
  away to the distant line of hills. His brain was numbed. Marcia had
  gone!&mdash;There was a mist somewhere. He rubbed the windowpane, in vain.
  Then he set his teeth, and his long, nervous fingers gripped at his throat
  for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Your coffee is getting cold," his sister reminded him.</p>

  <p>He came back to his place. She watched him a little curiously.</p>

  <p>"Any message from our pseudo-Lothario?" she asked.</p>

  <p>The Marquis gathered up his other letters.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing here from him," he said, "but I must ask you to excuse
  me, Caroline. There is an urgent matter which needs my attention."</p>

  <p>He crossed the room a little more slowly than usual, and his sister, who
  was still watching him critically, sighed. There was no doubt at all that his
  walk was becoming the walk of an old man. The stoop of the shoulders was also
  a new thing. She counted up his age on her fingers, and, rising from her
  place, looked at herself in the mirror opposite. Her face for a moment was
  hard and set, and her fingers clenched.</p>

  <p>"Years!" she muttered to herself. "How I hate them!"</p><br>

  <p>The Marquis selected a grey Homburg hat of considerable antiquity, and a
  thicker stick than usual, from the rack in the hall. The front doors stood
  wide open, and he walked out into the pleasant sunshine. It was a warm
  morning, but twice he shivered as he passed down the broad sweep of drive
  and, with a curious sensation of unfamiliarity, crossed the little bridge
  over the moat, the few yards of park, and finally approached the palings
  which bordered Richard Vont's domain. The mist still seemed to linger before
  his eyes, but through it he could see the familiar figure seated in his
  ancient chair, with the book upon his knee. The Marquis drew close to the
  side of the palings.</p>

  <p>"Richard Vont," he began, "I have come down from Mandeleys to speak to
  you. Will you listen to what I have to say?"</p>

  <p>There was no reply. The Marquis drew the letter from his pocket.</p>

  <p>"You are a cruel and stubborn man, Vont," he continued. "You have gone far
  out of your way to bring injury and unhappiness upon me. All your efforts are
  as nothing. Will you hear from me what has happened?"</p>

  <p>There was silence, still grim silence. The Marquis stretched out his hand
  and leaned a little upon the paling.</p>

  <p>"I took your daughter, Richard Vont, not as a libertine but as a lover. It
  was perhaps the truest impulse my life has ever felt. If there was sin in it,
  listen. Hear how I am punished. Month followed month and year followed year,
  and Marcia was content with my love and I with hers, so that during all this
  time my lips have touched no other woman's, no other woman has for a moment
  engaged even my fancy. I have been as faithful to your daughter, Richard
  Vont, as you to your vindictive enmity. From a discontented and unhappy girl
  she has become a woman with a position in the world, a brilliant writer,
  filled with the desire and happiness of life to her finger tips. From me she
  received the education, the travel, the experience which have helped her to
  her place in the world, and with them I gave her my heart. And now&mdash;you
  are listening, Richard Vont? You will hear what has happened?"</p>

  <p>Still that stony silence from the figure in the chair. Still that
  increasing mist before the eyes of the man who leaned towards him.</p>

  <p>"Your daughter, Richard Vont," the Marquis concluded, "has taken your
  vengeance into her own hands. Your prayers have come true, though not from
  the quarter you had hoped. You saw only a little way. You tried to strike
  only a foolish blow. It has been given to your daughter to do more than this.
  She has broken my heart, Richard Vont. She grew to become the dearest thing
  in my life, and she has left me.&mdash;Yesterday she was married."</p>

  <p>No exclamation, no movement. The Marquis wiped his eyes and saw with
  unexpected clearness. What had happened seemed so natural that for a moment
  he was not even surprised. He stepped over the palings, leaned for a single
  moment over the body of the man to whom he had been talking, and laid the
  palm of his hand over the lifeless eyes. Then he walked down the tiled path
  and called to the woman whose face he had seen through the latticed
  window.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Wells," he said, "something serious has happened to Vont."</p>

  <p>"Your lordship!"</p>

  <p>"He is dead," the Marquis told her. "You had better go down to the village
  and fetch the doctor. I will send a message to his nephew."</p>

  <p>Back again across the park, very gorgeous now in the fuller sunshine,
  casting quaint shadows underneath the trees, glittering upon the streaks of
  yellow cowslips on the hillside. The birds were singing and the air was as
  soft as midsummer. He crossed the bridge, turned into the drive and stood for
  a moment in his own hall. A servant came hurrying towards him.</p>

  <p>"Run across the park to Broomleys as fast as you can," his master
  directed. "Tell Mr. Thain to go at once to Vont's cottage. You had better let
  him know that Vont is dead."</p>

  <p>The young man hastened off. Gossett appeared from somewhere in the
  background and opened the door of the study towards which the Marquis was
  slowly making his way.</p>

  <p>"The shock has been too much for your lordship," the man murmured. "May I
  bring you some brandy?"</p>

  <p>The Marquis shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It is necessary, Gossett," he said, "that I should be absolutely
  undisturbed for an hour. Kindly see that no one even knocks at my door for
  that period of time."</p>

  <p>Gossett held open the door and closed it softly. He was a very old
  servant, and in great measure he understood.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER XXXV</h2>

  <p>Richard Vont was buried in the little churchyard behind Mandeleys, the
  churchyard in which was the family vault and which was consecrated entirely
  to tenants and dependents of the estate. The little congregation of
  soberly-clad villagers received more than one surprise during the course of
  the short and simple service. The Marquis himself, clad in sombre and
  unfamiliar garments, stood in his pew and followed the little procession to
  the graveside. The new tenant of Broomleys was there, and Marcia, deeply
  veiled but easily recognisable by that brief moment of emotion which followed
  the final ceremony. At its conclusion, the steward, following an immemorial
  custom, invited the little crowd to accompany him to Mandeleys, where
  refreshments were provided in the back hall. The Marquis had stepped back
  into the church. David and Marcia were alone. He came round to her side.</p>

  <p>"You don't remember me?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Remember you?" she repeated. "Aren't you Mr. David Thain?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he admitted, "but many years ago I was called Richard David
  Vont&mdash;when I lived down there with you, Marcia."</p>

  <p>Emotion had become so dulled that even her wonder found scanty
  expression.</p>

  <p>"I remember your eyes," she said. "They puzzled me more than once. Did he
  know?"</p>

  <p>"Of course," David answered. "We lived together in America for many years,
  and we came home together. Directly we arrived, however, he insisted on our
  separating. You know the madness of his life, Marcia."</p>

  <p>"I know," she answered bitterly. "Was I not the cause of it?"</p>

  <p>"It was part of his scheme that I should help towards his revenge," he
  explained. "I did his bidding, and the end was disaster and humiliation."</p>

  <p>They stood under the little wooden porch which led out into the park.</p>

  <p>"You will come up to Broomleys?" he invited.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Just now I would rather go back to the cottage," she said. "We shall meet
  again."</p>

  <p>"I shall be in England only for a few more days," he told her gloomily. "I
  am returning to America."</p>

  <p>She looked at him in some surprise.</p>

  <p>"I thought you had settled down here?"</p>

  <p>"Only to carry out my share in that infernal bargain. I have done it, I
  kept my word, I am miserably ashamed of myself, and I have but one feeling
  now&mdash;to get as far away as I can."</p>

  <p>"But tell me, David," she asked, "what was this scheme? What have you done
  to hurt him&mdash;the Marquis?"</p>

  <p>"I have done my best to ruin him," David replied, "and through some
  accursed scheme in which I bore an evil and humiliating part, I have brought
  some shadow of a scandal upon&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He broke off. Marcia waited for him to continue, but he shook his
  head.</p>

  <p>"The whole thing is too insignificant and yet too damnable," he said.
  "Some day, Marcia, I will tell you of it. If you won't come with me, forgive
  me if I hurry away."</p>

  <p>He was gone before she could remonstrate. She looked around and saw the
  reason. The Marquis was coming down the gravel path from the church in which
  he had taken refuge from the crowd. She felt a sudden shaking of the knees, a
  momentary return of that old ascendency which he had always held over her.
  Then she turned and waited for him. He smiled very gravely as he held her
  hand for a moment.</p>

  <p>"You are going back to the cottage?" he asked. "I will walk with you, if I
  may."</p>

  <p>They had a stretch of park before them, a wonderful, rolling stretch of
  ancient turf. Here and there were little clusters of cowslips, golden as the
  sunshine which was making quaint patterns of shadow beneath the oaks and
  drawing the perfume from the hawthorn trees, drooping beneath their weight of
  blossom. Marcia tried twice to speak, but her voice broke. There was the one
  look in his face which she dreaded.</p>

  <p>"I shall not say any conventional things to you," he began gently. "Your
  father's life for many years must have been most unhappy. In a way, I suppose
  you and I are the people who are responsible for it. And yet, behind it
  all&mdash;I say it in justice to ourselves, and not with disrespect to the
  dead&mdash;it was his primeval and colossal ignorance, the heritage of that
  stubborn race of yeomen, which was responsible for his sorrow."</p>

  <p>"He never understood," she murmured. "No one in this world could make him
  understand."</p>

  <p>"You know that our new neighbour up there," he continued, moving his head
  towards Broomleys, "was his nephew&mdash;a sharer, however unwilling, in his
  folly?"</p>

  <p>"He has just told me," she admitted.</p>

  <p>"I was the first to find your father dead," he went on. "When I received
  your letter, Marcia, I took it to him. I went to offer him the sacrifice of
  my desolation. That, I thought, would end his enmity. And I read your letter
  to dead ears. He was seated there, believing that all the evil he wished me
  had come. I suppose the belief brought him peace. He was a stubborn old
  man."</p>

  <p>Marcia would have spoken, but there was a lump in her throat. She opened
  her lips only to close them again.</p>

  <p>"I wished to see you, Marcia," he continued, "because I wanted you to
  understand that I have only one feeling in my heart towards you, and that is
  a feeling of wonderful gratitude. For many years you have been the most
  sympathetic companion a somewhat dull person could have had. The memory of
  these years is imperishable. And I want to tell you something else. In my
  heart I approve of what you have done."</p>

  <p>"Oh, but that is impossible!" she replied. "I cannot keep the bitter
  thoughts from my own heart. I am ashamed when I think of your kindness, of
  your fidelity, of all that you have given and done for me throughout these
  years. And now I have the feeling that I am leaving you when you need me
  most."</p>

  <p>He smiled at her.</p>

  <p>"Your knowledge of life," he said gently, "should teach you better. The
  years that lay between us when you first gave me all that there was worth
  having of love in the world were nothing. To-day they are an impassable gulf.
  I have reached just those few years which become the aftermath of actual
  living, and you are young still, young in mind and body. We part so
  naturally. There is something still alive in you which is dead in me."</p>

  <p>"But you are so lonely," she faltered.</p>

  <p>"I should be lonelier still," he answered, "or at least more unhappy, if I
  dragged you with me through the cheerless years. Life is a matter of cycles.
  You are commencing a new one, and so am I, only the things that are necessary
  to you are not now necessary to me. So it is natural and best that we should
  part."</p>

  <p>She pointed to the cottage, now only a few yards away. Its doors and
  windows were wide open, there was smoke coming from the chimney, a wealth of
  flowers in the garden.</p>

  <p>"The cottage is mine," she said. "Sometimes I believe that it was left to
  me in the hope that I might come back with my heart, too, full of bitterness,
  and that I might take his place. It is yours whenever you choose to take it.
  I shall send the deeds to Mr. Merridrew."</p>

  <p>He looked at it thoughtfully. For a moment the shadow passed from his
  face. He stood a little more upright, his eyes seemed to grow larger. Perhaps
  he thought of those days when he had stolen down from the house with beating
  heart, drawn nearer and nearer to the cottage, felt all the glow and fervour
  of his great love. There was a breath of perfume from the garden, full of
  torturing memories&mdash;a little wind in the trees.</p>

  <p>"One of the desires of my life gratified," he declared. "Mr. Merridrew
  shall draw up a deed of sale. Look," he added, pointing to the drive, "there
  is some one waiting for you in the car there. Isn't it your husband?"</p>

  <p>She glanced in the direction he indicated.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"I will not stay and see him now," the Marquis continued. "You will
  forgive me, I know. Present to him, if you will," he went on, with some faint
  touch of his old manner, "my heartiest good wishes. And to you, Marcia," he
  added, raising the fingers of her ungloved hand to his lips, "well, may you
  find all that there is left in the world of happiness. And remember, too,
  that every drop of happiness that comes into your life means greater peace
  for me.&mdash;We talk too seriously for such a brilliant morning," he
  concluded, his voice measured, though kindly, his attitude suddenly
  reminiscent of that long, pictured line of gallant ancestors. "Take my advice
  and use some of this beautiful afternoon for your ride to London. There will
  be a moon to-night and you may enter it as the heroine in your last
  story&mdash;a fairy city."</p>

  <p>He left her quite easily, but when she tried to start to meet her husband,
  her knees gave way. She clung to the paling and watched him cross the bridge
  and stroll up the little strip of turf, still erect, contemplating the great
  pile in front of him with the beneficent satisfaction of inherited
  proprietorship. She watched him pass through the front door and disappear.
  Then she turned around and drew her husband into the cottage.</p>

  <p>"James," she cried, sobbing in his arms, "take me away&mdash;please take
  me away!"</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER XXXVI</h2>

  <p>During those few hours of strenuous, almost fierce work into which David
  threw himself after the funeral, he found in a collection of belated
  cablegrams which his secretary handed him an explanation of Letitia's half
  apology, an explanation, he told himself bitterly, of her altered demeanour
  towards him. The old proverb stood justified. Even this, the wildest of his
  speculations, had become miraculously successful. Pluto Oil shares, unsalable
  at a dollar a few weeks ago, now stood at eight. Oil had been discovered in
  extraordinary and unprecedented quantities. Oil was spurting another great
  fortune for him out of the sandy earth. He paused to make a calculation. The
  Marquis's forty thousand pounds' worth were worth, at a rough estimate, three
  hundred thousand.</p>

  <p>"Extraordinary news, this, Jackson," he remarked to the quiet, sad-faced
  young man, who had been his right hand since the time of his first railway
  deal.</p>

  <p>"Most extraordinary," was the quiet reply. "I congratulate you, Mr. Thain.
  You do seem to have the knack of turning everything you touch into gold."</p>

  <p>"Do I?" Thain murmured listlessly.</p>

  <p>"I took the liberty of investing in a small parcel of shares myself, just
  to lock away," the young man continued. "I gave seventy cents for them."</p>

  <p>"Not enough to make you a millionaire, I hope?" Thain asked, with some
  bitterness.</p>

  <p>"Enough, with my savings, to give me a very comfortable feeling of
  independence, sir," Jackson replied. "I have never aspired any further than
  that."</p>

  <p>Thain returned to his desk. He gave letter after letter, and more than
  once his secretary, who had received no previous intimation of his master's
  intended departure, glanced at him in mild surprise.</p>

  <p>"I presume, as you are returning to the States, sir," he suggested, "that
  we must try to cancel the contracts which we have already concluded for the
  restoration of this place?"</p>

  <p>Thain shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Let them go on," he said. "It makes very little difference. I have a
  seven years' lease. I may come back again. The letters which I gave you with
  a cross you had better take into your own study and type. I shall be here to
  sign them when you have finished."</p>

  <p>The young man bowed and departed. David listened to the closing of the
  door and turned his head a little wearily towards the night. The French
  windows stood open. Through the still fir trees, whose perfume reached him
  every now and then in little wafts, he could see one or two of the earlier
  lights shining from the great house. Once more his thoughts travelled back to
  the ever-present subject. Could he have done differently? Was there any way
  in which he could have spared himself the ignominy, the terrible humiliation
  of those few minutes? There was something wrong about it all, something
  almost suicidal&mdash;his blind obedience to the old man's prejudiced hatred,
  his own frenzied tearing to pieces of what might at least have remained a
  wonderful dream. One half of his efforts, too, had fallen pitifully flat. The
  Marquis had only to keep the shares to which he was justly entitled, to free
  for the first time for generations his far-spreading estates, to take his
  place once more as the greatest nobleman and landowner in the county. If only
  it had been the other scheme which had miscarried!</p>

  <p>His avenue of elms was sheltering now an orchestra of singing birds. With
  the slightly moving breeze which had sprung up since sunset, the perfume of
  his roses became alluringly manifest. Through the trees he heard the chiming
  of the great stable clock from Mandeleys, and the sound seemed somehow to
  torture him. His head drooped for a moment upon his arms.</p>

  <p>The room seemed suddenly to become darker. He raised his head and remained
  staring, like a man who looks upon some impossible vision. Lady Letitia,
  bare-headed, a little paler than usual, a little, it seemed to him, more
  human, was standing there, looking in upon him. He managed to rise to his
  feet, but he had no words.</p>

  <p>"I am not a ghost," she said. "Please come out into the garden. I want to
  talk to you."</p>

  <p>He followed her without a word. It was significant that his first impulse
  had been to shrink away from her as one dreading to receive a hurt. She
  seemed to notice it and smiled.</p>

  <p>"Let us try and be reasonable for a short time," she continued. "We seem
  to have been living in some perfectly absurd nightmare for the last few
  hours. I have come to you to try and regain my poise. Yes, we will sit
  down&mdash;here, please."</p>

  <p>They sat in the same chairs which they had occupied on her previous visit.
  David had been through many crises in his life, but this one left him with no
  command of coherent speech&mdash;left him curiously, idiotically
  tongue-tied.</p>

  <p>"I have thought over this ridiculous affair," she went on. "I must talk
  about it to some one, and there is only you left."</p>

  <p>"Your guests," he faltered.</p>

  <p>"Gone!" she told him a little melodramatically. "Didn't you know that we
  had been alone ever since the morning afterwards? First of all, my almost
  fianc&eacute;, Charlie Grantham, drove off at dawn. He left behind him a
  little note. He had every confidence in me, but&mdash;he went. Then my aunt.
  She was the most peevish person I ever knew. She seemed to imagine that I had
  in some way interfered with her plans for your subjugation, and although she
  knew quite well that no woman of the Mandeleys family could ever stoop to any
  unworthy or undignified action, she decided to hurry her departure. She left
  at midday."</p>

  <p>"But Miss Sylvia?"</p>

  <p>"Sylvia was most ingenuous," Letitia continued, her voice regaining a
  little of its natural quality. "Sylvia came to me quite timidly and asked me
  to walk with her in the garden. She wondered&mdash;was it really settled
  between me and Lord Charles? If it was, she was quite willing to go into a
  nunnery or something equivalent,&mdash;Chiswick, I believe it was, with a
  maiden aunt. But if not, she believed&mdash;he had whispered a few things to
  her&mdash;he was hoping to see her that week in town. It was most
  extraordinary&mdash;-she couldn't understand it&mdash;but it seemed that
  their old flirtations&mdash;you knew, of course, that they had met often
  before&mdash;had left a void in his heart which only she could fill. He had
  discovered his mistake in time. She threw herself upon my mercy. She left by
  the three-thirty."</p>

  <p>"My God!" he groaned. "And this was all my doing!"</p>

  <p>"All your doing," she assented equably. "They were all of them perfectly
  content to accept your story. There is not one of them who disputes it for a
  single moment. But you were there, with the secret door closed behind you,
  and, as my aunt said, there is really no accounting for what people will do,
  nowadays. And now," she concluded, "I gather that you are leaving, too."</p>

  <p>"I am motoring up to town to-morrow morning," he said. "I haven't ventured
  to speak of atonement, but your coming here like this, Lady Letitia, is the
  kindest thing you have ever done&mdash;you could ever do. I have tried, in my
  way," he went on, after a moment's pause, "to live what I suppose one calls a
  self-respecting life. I have never before been in a position when I have been
  ashamed of anything I have done. And now, since those few minutes, I have
  lived in a burning furnace of it. I daren't let my mind dwell upon it. Those
  few minutes were the most horrible, psychological tragedy which any man could
  face. If your coming really means," he went on, and his voice shook, and his
  eyes glowed as he leaned towards her, "that I may carry away with me the
  feeling that you have forgiven me, I can't tell you the difference it will
  make."</p>

  <p>"But why go?" she asked him softly.</p>

  <p>His heart began to beat with sudden, feverish throbs. His eyes searched
  her face hungrily. She seemed in earnest. Her lips had lost even their usual,
  faintly contemptuous curl. If anything, she was smiling at him.</p>

  <p>"Why go?" he repeated. "Can't you understand that the one desire I have,
  the one burning desire, is to put myself as far away as possible from the
  sight and memory of what happened that night? We have been telephoning
  through to London. I have taken my passage for America on Saturday. I shall
  go straight out to the Rockies. I just want to get where I can forget your
  look and the words with which your father turned me out of his house. And
  worse than that," he added, with a little shake in his tone, "their
  justice&mdash;their cruel, abominable justice."</p>

  <p>Then what was surely a miracle happened. She leaned forward and took his
  hand. Her eyes were soft with sympathy.</p>

  <p>"You poor thing!" she exclaimed. "You couldn't do anything else. I have
  been thinking it over very seriously. It was a horrible position for you, but
  you really couldn't do anything else, that I can see. You told your story
  simply and like a man. But wait. There is one thing I can't understand. Those
  shares&mdash;were they not to be part of that poor man's vengeance. You
  surely never intended that we should benefit by them in this extraordinary
  way?"</p>

  <p>"I believed them," he told her firmly, "when I sold them to your father,
  to be, until long after he would have had to pay for them, at any rate,
  absolutely worthless. The wholly unexpected has happened, as it does often in
  oil. Your father's shares are worth a fortune. He can realise his idea of
  clearing Mandeleys. He can dispose of them to-day for three hundred thousand
  pounds. Lady Letitia, you have come to me like an angel. This is the sweetest
  thing any woman ever did. Be still kinder. Please make your father keep the
  shares. They are his. They were sold to ruin him. It is just the chance of
  something that happened many thousand miles away, which has turned them in
  his favour. He accepts nothing from me. It is fate only which brings him this
  windfall."</p>

  <p>"I promise," she said. "To tell you the truth, I think father is as much
  changed, during the last few days, as I am. When I saw him, about an hour
  ago, and told him that I was coming to see you, I was almost frightened at
  first. He looks older, and I fancy that something which has happened
  lately&mdash;something quite outside&mdash;has been a great blow to him."</p>

  <p>"Does he know, then, how kind you are being to me?" David asked.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"He rather hoped," she whispered, leaning a little closer still to him and
  smiling into his face, "that you would come back with me and dine."</p>

  <p>David suddenly clutched her hands. He was a man again. He threw away his
  doubts. He accepted Paradise.</p>

  <p>On their way across the park, a short time later, he suddenly pointed down
  towards the little cottage.</p>

  <p>"You haven't forgotten, Letitia," he said, "that I lived there? You
  haven't forgotten that that old man was my uncle!&mdash;that his father and
  grandfather were the servants of your family?"</p>

  <p>"My dear David," she replied, "I have forgotten nothing, only I think that
  I have learned a little. I am still full of family tradition, proud of my
  share of it, if you will, but somehow or other I don't think that it is more
  than a part, and a very small part, of our daily life. So let there be an end
  of that, please. You have done great things and I am proud of you, and I have
  done nothing except suffer myself to be born into a very ancient and
  occasionally disreputable family.... Oh, I must tell you!" she went on, with
  a little laugh. "What do you think father was settling down to do when I came
  out?"</p>

  <p>David shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I have no idea."</p>

  <p>"I left him seated at his desk," she told him. "He is writing a line to
  Mr. Wadham, Junior, asking him to-day's price of the Pluto Oil shares."</p>
