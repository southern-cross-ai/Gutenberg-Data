  <h2>PREFACE</h2>

  <p>The modern conception of history is that of a continuous movement, the
  beginning of which eludes the most patient research and the conclusion of
  which is, of course, beyond any possible surmise; historians are no longer
  content with labels nor satisfied to trace the rise and fall of nations or
  ideas, the bloom and decay of such institutions as the feudal system, the
  Holy Roman Empire, or the scope and influence of movements such as the
  Renaissance, or the Reformation; this wide view, in which no one nation has a
  greater share, or one ideal a larger prominence than another, naturally tends
  to dwarf and even obscure the events and the personalities that, under the
  former school of historians, showed in such startling importance; dramatic
  incident, picturesque legend, fade in the clear light of this wide vista, and
  commanding figures, once of heroic proportions, are reduced to trivial
  measurements; the impersonal progress of humanity is all that remains; nor
  have we much right to use the word "progress." Despite a great deal that
  flatters us in our modernity, a cool historian could scarcely claim that the
  standards of honour, morality and aspiration, which mankind has set up for
  himself from time immemorial, have been more steadily adhered to in one age
  than in another, including our own; that the ignorance, superstition and ills
  of humanity have been more glaring in one age than in another, including our
  own; the assurance that scolds and scorns the past, and talks of modern
  enlightenment and modern standards as if these had nearly reached perfection,
  is assuredly affording matter for amusement to future generations.</p>

  <p>We may claim stupendous discoveries in science, but this is not a virtue;
  nor have these same discoveries been always turned to virtuous ends; we can
  claim a wide religious tolerance (probably our one achievement), but it is
  doubtful if this is not indifference, and that we are not persecutors merely
  because we are apathetic on questions of dogma; it must also be admitted that
  tolerance has always been an attitude of fine minds and is no modern
  discovery, and that the temper of the bigot and the fervour of the fanatic
  are by no means extinct.</p>

  <p>Surveying, then, a history which appears to have taught us nothing, and be
  leading us no further&mdash;for who can now accept the neat, self-satisfied
  definitions with which party historians strove to prove their
  points?&mdash;what do we find of interest?</p>

  <p>Always, one thinks, the character and actions of individual men and women,
  people whose common humanity was tempered and influenced by their positions
  and environments and the peculiar questions of their times; these were more
  similar than at first appears, small exterior differences of customs,
  problems, local atmosphere, are apt to be much exaggerated; the mainsprings
  of human character have remained unchanged; ambition, spirituality, love,
  hate, self-interest, self-sacrifice, lust for fame, for power, for money,
  struggling with piety, asceticism, altruism; all played upon by circumstance,
  by environment, by the actions of others, in brief, the one theme of fact and
  fiction alike when it treats with humanity, man's dealing with his
  destiny&mdash;what interest is there save this?</p>

  <p>The following is an account of the childhood and youth of a man who, by
  reason of his position and his character, has constantly occupied the
  attention of his fellows, been extravagantly lauded, fiercely slandered,
  blamed for much for which he could not, perhaps, have been responsible, and
  praised for much that was, perhaps, not owing to him, but by all admitted to
  have been one who by sheer force of moral and mental qualities had, as one of
  his enemies remarked, "the honour of being for thirty years the first
  personage in Europe."</p>

  <p>A man who could, in any period, have held such a position, could have
  achieved a prominence that excited both the deep admiration and bitter fury
  of his contemporaries, must furnish material for a relation of more than
  ordinary interest; it is, however, a relation that has scarcely hitherto been
  undertaken. Though the story has been told again and again, it has been in a
  broken and desultory fashion&mdash;"the life" overwhelmed by "the times," the
  soldier by the campaigns, the statesman by the politics; too often told,
  also, by uncritical, biased or careless writers who have not been
  sufficiently interested in their subject to sift their materials or probe
  their accuracy.</p>

  <p>The most authoritative books on William III are those least accessible to
  the general English reader; they are the works of Dutch historians: R. Fruin,
  <i>Verspreide Geschriften</i>, iv, v; J. P. Blok, <i>Geschiedenis van het
  Nederlandsche Volk</i>, iv, v; Groen Van Prinsterer, <i>Geschiedenis van het
  Vaderland</i> and F. Kramer's <i>Maria Stuart</i>, ii, are among the most
  important. Among the many German books on this subject may be mentioned the
  classic <i>Der Fall des Hauses Stuart</i>, by O. Klopp; <i>Der Grosse
  Kurfürst</i>, by Philipson; the massive works of Ranke; <i>Waldeck und
  Wilhelm III</i>, by Muller; <i>Wilhelm III von England und das Haus
  Wittelsbach</i>, by G.F. Preuss. In French there are Waddington's <i>Frédéric
  Guillaume de Brandenbourg</i> and <i>Les Provinces-Unies</i>, and <i>Jean de
  Witt</i>, by Lefèvre Pontalis, M. de Ségur's <i>Le Prince d'Orange et le
  Maréchal de Luxembourg</i> and <i>Louis XIV et Innocent XI</i>, by Michaud.
  In English there are innumerable books dealing with the period, but few with
  the man; a concise and accurate official life of William III is that of D. H.
  Traill in the series <i>Twelve English Statesmen</i>. Lord Macaulay's
  <i>History</i> deals, of course, only with William III as King of England,
  and from a narrow point of view, while his exaltation of him as the Whig
  Champion roused a reaction of dissent; Professor G. M. Trevelyan in
  <i>England under the Stewarts</i> gives the English side of affairs, and the
  best English history of the Netherlands is that by the Rev. George
  Edmundson.</p>

  <p>Contemporary sources are, obviously, in such number that a list of them
  would be out of proportion to a book of this pretension; for this reason no
  bibliography is given; it would have to be either exhaustingly long or an
  arbitrary selection; many of these sources, such as Burnet's <i>History</i>,
  Temple's <i>Works</i>, the diaries of Pepys and Evelyn, Clarendon's
  <i>History</i>, etc., are English classics, others are rare and inaccessible
  to the reader without time and patience; nearly all the archives of Europe
  contain material for the life of William III. The seventeenth century has,
  however, left memorials more easily procured by those who have no leisure or
  means for extensive research. Besides the English writers already mentioned,
  there are memoirs which have less literary value, such as those of Lord
  Ailesbury, Reresby, Henry Sidney, Lady Fanshawe, Clarke's <i>James II</i>,
  Narcissus Luttrell and Wood, etc.; from these writers most valuable
  knowledge, not only as to politics, but as to details of daily life, opinion,
  etc., of the seventeenth century may be gathered.</p>

  <p>Among letters may be mentioned the correspondence of Lord Arlington, Sir
  William Temple, Sir George Savile, Algernon Sidney, Lady Russell, D'Éstrades,
  D'Avaux, as the better known and more easily obtained; the letters of William
  III are scattered through many volumes and many collections; a number
  referring to the earlier part of his life are in <i>Wilhelm Van Orangien und
  G. F. Waldeck</i>, by P. Müller, already mentioned; others and much material
  of the first importance are given in Groen Van Prinsterer's <i>Archives de la
  Maison d'Orange Nassau</i> (2nd series, vol. v, 1650-1688); this includes
  much correspondence dealing with William III's childhood and the letters of
  Prince John Maurice of Nassau-Siegen, and William III, 1673. Of some value
  for 1650-1678 are the <i>Memoires</i> of M. Gourville, of the Marquis de
  Saint Maurice, the <i>Journaal</i> of William III's secretary, the younger
  Constantine Huygens, and the correspondence of his father, most loyal servant
  of the House of Orange, and father of Christian Huygens the great
  philosopher, which has been excellently edited; as much cannot be said for
  the <i>Journaal</i> and the <i>Archives</i>, etc.</p>

  <p>It is obvious that even memoirs, diaries and letters must be received with
  caution; too much stress may easily be given to the importance of a
  contemporary's evidence. Gilbert Burnet is a classic instance of this; his
  memoirs, misleadingly called "a history," should be read in the edition
  edited by Osmund Airy (Oxford), 1897-1900, and in conjunction with the
  "Supplement" edited by Miss H. C. Foxcroft (Oxford), 1902; these show how the
  well-meaning writer, if not deserving of the hostile judgment delivered by
  Ranke, must be received with reserve; the same must be said of Wicquefort,
  another contemporary historian. The <i>Mémoires</i> of Gourville, carefully
  edited and annotated in the edition of 1894-1895, cover the ground from
  1643-1702; but they were dictated by a man of seventy-seven in a few weeks,
  and this fact helps to make it doubtful if any reliance can be placed on the
  very important conversation between Gourville and William III on the disputed
  subjects of the death of the De Witts and the battle of Saint Denis.
  Gourville's character was tainted, and Groen Van Prinsterer thought his
  evidence valueless. De Pomponne's <i>Mémoires</i> (Paris, 1860) cover the
  ground between 1671-1679. The letters of the elder Huygens, already noted,
  edited by J. A. Worp (The Hague, 1917), contain valuable details as to the
  early life of William III, the affairs of the town of Orange, etc., in the
  9th and 10th volumes.</p>

  <p>The younger Huygens' <i>Journaal</i> gives an account of the campaigns in
  the Spanish Netherlands from 1673 to 1678, which is, of course, invaluable,
  though the writer was a formal man occupied with his own point of view; the
  <i>Dagboek</i> by the same faithful secretary does not touch the period
  treated here.</p>

  <p>The Marquis de Saint Maurice was the envoy of the Duke of Savoy at
  Versailles and accompanied Louis XIV in the campaigns of 1672-1673, of which
  he has left a lively account.</p>

  <p>The vivid and touching <i>Lettres et Mémoires de Marie, Reine
  d'Angleterre</i> (The Hague, 1880), are of the first importance, and there is
  an interesting collection of Mary II's earlier letters in <i>Letters of Two
  Queens</i>, by B. Bathurst, London, 1924; these do not treat with the period
  dealt with here, but are invaluable as regards the character of William
  III.</p>

  <p><i>Le Grand Électeur et Louis XIV</i>, George Pagès (Paris, 1905), is a
  laborious work with a copious bibliography; this careful writer judges the
  masterpiece of Otto Klopp&mdash;<i>Der Fall der Hauses
  Stuart</i>&mdash;"confuse, partiale, suspecte," and considers that <i>Johan
  de Witt</i>, by M. Peter, is more reliable than the well-known work on this
  subject by Lefèvre Pontalis; Van Praet, in <i>Essais sur l'histoire politique
  des derniers siècles</i> (Bruxelles, 1867), gives a clear and careful account
  of the politics of the seventeenth century and the character of William III;
  interesting as coming from a Belgian.</p>

  <p>The works of Voltaire, Ranke, Mazure, Masson, Michelet, Guizot and
  Wagenaars dealing with this period are too well known to be detailed here, as
  are the volumes by Miss Strickland and Miss Everett Green, brilliant but
  prejudiced compilations. Hallam and Burke are among the famous English
  writers who have written with deep admiration of William III. <i>M. de
  Luxembourg et le Prince d'Orange</i> has value as showing a Frenchman's
  enthusiasm for Louis XIV, but is utterly biased.</p>

  <p>The author has a great affection for, and has learnt much from, such
  pleasing, inconsequent, unreliable, but delightful ancient books as
  <i>History of Flanders</i> (London, 1701), <i>L'histoire du
  Stadthouderat</i>, by Raynal (Paris, 1780); <i>House of Austria</i>, Bancks;
  <i>History of the House of Orange</i>, by Richard Burton (1693); <i>Tableau
  de l'histoire générale des Provinces-Unie</i>, A. M. Cerisier (1782); and
  <i>The Netherlands Historian</i>, 1672, etc.; they are full of atmosphere and
  details which give, as much as fact, the very spirit of the times.</p>

  <p>The account of the medals is taken from Bizot's <i>Medalische historie der
  Republiek Van Holland</i> (1690). Many of these are printed and described in
  the <i>Life of William III</i> (London, 1703). The details of the descent of
  the Nassau Princes are from the very elaborate tables <i>Afstamming van het
  Nederlandsche Koninghuis</i>, by J. de Bas, and <i>Stamboom van het Huis
  Nassau</i>, by E. J. Thomassen à Thuessink Van der Hoop (The Hague,
  1923).</p>

  <p>The present book is the result of years of interest in the subject, and it
  would be impossible to give all sources of the information slowly
  gathered-not always from books or documents.</p>

  <p>William III appeared under many aspects to his contemporaries; he was in
  Holland at once the heroic deliverer of State and Faith, and the ambitious
  Prince riveting chains on a free people; to the majority a popular idol, to
  the minority a cautious tyrant; in England he was first Prince of the Blood,
  husband of the heiress to the Crown, chief of an Opposition composed of
  careful, moderate, reasonable men (with the weight of the strong Protestant
  feeling of the country behind them), later he was to be the Great Deliverer
  or the Usurper, Champion of Whigs and Nonconformists, detested by Roman
  Catholics and Jacobites&mdash;"Dutch William," "Little Hook Nose," "the
  Squeezed Orange"&mdash;a subject of frantic praise and gratitude, and of
  unrestrained slander and abuse; in Ireland, "King Wullie"; in Scotland, "A
  man raised up by God" for the Covenanters, and for the Highlands an alien
  pretender to the ancient honours of the Stewarts; to Louis XIV's bitter pride
  he was "the Little Lord of Breda"; to the rest of Europe the head and heart
  of the largest confederation ever ranged together against one power, a
  personality so dominant that his minister could talk of the Emperor's actions
  as depending on their master's directions, and broadsheets show him at the
  Hague as bear-leader of the German Princes; and with this the Champion of
  Protestantism was approved of by the Papacy, well-wished and secretly
  encouraged by the able and upright Odaleschi, Innocent XI; most of the
  Princes with whom he fought against France, and with whom he lived on terms
  of intimate friendship, were Roman Catholics, and yet he attained his highest
  honours to the mob cry of "No Popperie!", while his accession to the throne
  of James II set back the hopes and disabled the prospects of English Roman
  Catholics for over a hundred years.</p>

  <p>The Revolution of 1688 may or may not have been "glorious"; to most it has
  come to mean the beginning of an era of settled government, of commercial
  prosperity, of religious freedom, of parliamentary rule and popular liberty;
  to others it has come to mean the end of the old glories of Kingship, the
  loss of the legitimate royal family, the intrusion of the ideals of the
  merchant and the wealthy middle class, the tyranny of democracy and the drab
  uniformity of a Calvinized Protestantism, tinging deeply not only the Church
  but the nation at large; all agree in calling the eighteenth century "the age
  of prose," all agree that 1688 marked a change, both wide and deep, in the
  history of England, and that this could not have been accomplished, as it was
  accomplished, with well-organized smoothness, without bloodshed (in England
  at least), without even dislocation of ancient laws, customs or traditions,
  if such a man as William of Orange, a statesman the equal of Richelieu,
  possessed of a rare combination of daring in design and prudence in
  execution, had not been at hand; this revolution and this man definitely
  pitted England against France, set her in a place of importance and power she
  had not occupied since the rule of Cromwell, helped her to break for ever the
  pretensions of the Bourbons (Treaty of Utrecht, 1714) and, in a sense, assume
  these pretensions herself; this may have been either for better or worse. It
  is at least an important historical event in Europe.</p>

  <p>It is not correct to think of the Prince who accomplished this as the Whig
  Champion, nor to picture him as he is represented on the quay at Brixham,
  close-haired, plain-coated, the Bible under his arm, a Dutch Cromwell,
  valiant for the Lord; it was not thus he appeared to the captains and his
  councillors, of that one can be sure, however good the likeness may be in the
  eyes of party historians; what manner of man, then, was this
  warrior-statesman?</p>

  <p>English historians have written of him as king of England, but seldom
  shown him against his Dutch background, and seldom without a reserve even in
  their praise; he was not English, he did not attempt to disguise
  disappointment and an aloof disdain for much that was English; England, as a
  country, he thought "<i>vilain</i>." This attitude was, from first to last,
  unpardoned; his great services could not take the place of good fellowship;
  his wide policies could not excuse his scorn for insular absorption in local
  disputes; he never wholly succeeded, till on his deathbed, in uniting the
  English in one common front against a common foe, and the English never more
  than partially succeeded in drawing him into party factions; the man whom the
  Whigs have so extolled and the Tories so reviled was profoundly contemptuous
  of the party politics of Whigs and Tories alike; his interests, his
  ambitions, his loves and likings were elsewhere&mdash;in brief, a foreigner.
  No doubt, to be a foreigner was an unpardonable offence in a king of England,
  and one that William III made no attempt to efface; yet it seems scarcely
  just to taunt a man because of his nostalgia for his home, nor very
  perceptive not to realize that exile is terrible, even if it be gilded with
  royal honours; neither his contemporaries nor his historians appear to have
  troubled to understand, in their eagerness to resent the coldness of William
  III towards England and the fact of his straining to be away, his part in the
  matter; how hostile this country seemed to him, how untrustworthy were nearly
  all the English who surrounded him, how intensely he, passionate and
  sensitive, was attached to the scenes of his youth; the episode of the Dutch
  Guards in 1697 cannot be read with less than shame by any English person. It
  was a piece of deep irony that the first constitutional King of England, who
  was to reign but not to rule, a position that the English parliament intended
  to be akin to that of the Doge of Venice, should have been a man of temper as
  imperious as that of any absolute monarch, and nothing but self-control and
  wisdom amounting to genius could have reconciled such a character with such a
  position&mdash;"a terrible burden," William wrote to Waldeck, "and one almost
  too heavy for my shoulders."</p>

  <p>The author wishes to make it clear that no religious or political
  controversy is intended to be opened, that she feels no prejudice against any
  of these long-dead people, nor their faiths, nor their actions, but that she
  does believe there is a danger nearly as great in avoiding all bias as in
  yielding to bias; she cannot deny herself the courage of appreciation nor
  conceal the enthusiastic interest in the subject which has been the sole
  reason for writing this book; it is not a challenge to any possible views or
  convictions, nor does it intend to be provocative, though the subject is one
  that has, even to our own day, raised the bitterest controversy and the most
  virulent expression of opinion.</p>

  <p>The portraits given have been selected with much trouble and care; the
  importance of pictures in the realization of history has perhaps been hardly
  sufficiently regarded; a period, a personality, a whole attitude to life can
  often be understood better from a painting than from sheets of exposition;
  the academic histories, valuable as they are, have an atmosphere of
  lifelessness through the absence of illustrations and all pictorial detail;
  as soon as one is interested in characters, one desires to know what they
  were like in their persons, and it is certain that when one has examined
  hundreds of likenesses of one man or woman, a distinct personality emerges,
  built up from the various details of good, bad and indifferent pictures,
  engravings, busts, and medals.</p>

  <p>A false description of a person's appearance will also give a false
  description of their character; a careless touch of this nature will
  considerably mislead the reader. William III has frequently been so wrongly
  described; the author has read of him as "broken-nosed," "hunchbacked," with
  "a mouth indicated by a thin line," as of "a mean exterior," etc. The present
  selection of portraits will enable the reader to visualize the appearance of
  this Prince from his third to his twenty-third year; one only is of later
  date&mdash;possibly 1678; the paintings chosen are by skilful painters, and
  prove their worth as likenesses by their resemblance to each other.</p>

  <p>It should be remembered that this period is the baroque in painting, and
  that portraiture strove to represent the period more than the individual; men
  and women were painted officially; the painter had to embody the current
  conception of masculinity and femininity, of royalty and aristocracy; the
  background and adjuncts were strictly formalized; certain attitudes and
  colours, certain properties and decorations were compulsory for different
  types; hence all princes and nobles were shown in vigorous attitudes, as
  successful warriors or in royal robes, every detail enhancing the ideal of
  strength, grandeur, power; While the women were shown in tender hues, in
  reposeful positions, adorned by jewels (pearls nearly always), and caressing
  pages, pet animals, or playing with flowers. This rigid convention, which
  degenerated into the distorted bombast of allegory and was then violently
  displaced by the realistic school, is far better suited for the
  representation of a period than of a person; a likeness was of a secondary
  consideration; in the case of a strongly-marked personality, however, it is
  still possible to trace, through a host of <i>portraits de parade</i>, a
  consistent individuality; this is the case with William III (as also with
  Louis XIV and Charles II), and in particular with the portraits here given
  which belong to the earlier period of the baroque movement.</p>

  <p>The portraits by J. Van Huysmans(?) and A. Hanneman from Hampton Court are
  reproduced by gracious permission of His Majesty the King; the others by the
  courtesy of Count Godard Bentinck, the directors of the National Portrait
  Gallery, the Print Room of the British Museum, the Mauritshuis, the Hague,
  and the Rijks Museum, Amsterdam.</p>

  <p>None of these pictures have been reproduced in a volume before, and many
  of them not photographed; some are from rare prints in the possession of the
  author, who has to thank the zeal and industry of her husband in collecting
  these series of portraits&mdash;a task not so easy as may appear to those who
  have never undertaken the labour of procuring the likeness of a secondary
  historical character.</p>

  <p>The author is glad to present for the first time to the English reader a
  portrait of William Frederic, Lord of Zuylestein, the first Earl of Rochford;
  this portrait, with another at present at Castle Zuylestein in Utrecht, is,
  with the possible exception of a picture in Wyck-by-Duurstede, Guelders, the
  only painting extant of this notable man; it has never been engraved nor,
  before this, photographed. The portraits of the Duke of Lorraine and the
  Prince de Vaudemont are also, as far as the author knows, reproduced for the
  first time. It may be thought that too much insistence has been made on this
  point, but the author believes that the accurate conception of a character is
  greatly helped by an accurate conception of that character's appearance; a
  portrait will often make a mere name into a personality.</p>

  <p>The form of English spelling most in use has been adhered to throughout as
  the only hope of avoiding confusion; the spelling of seventeenth-century
  Dutch names is more uncertain even than the spelling of French and English,
  and, full of character and atmosphere as these forms are, they have been
  foregone for the sake of uniformity.</p>

  <p>The author's first intention was to bring this volume up to the Peace of
  Nymwegen, 1678, but it was found impossible to compress into one book all the
  material collected; it is hoped to continue in a subsequent volume the life
  of William III to 1678, and to complete the whole in a third.</p>

  <p>The taking of Bonn makes a fitting climax to the youth of William III and
  has been chosen as the limit of the period treated.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

  <p>William Henry, Prince of Orange, was born at the Hague, November 4th/14th
  1650, heir to the complicated and high honours of his dead father and to the
  eclipsed fortunes of two of the greatest houses in Europe, Nassau and
  Stewart.</p>

  <p>It was the depth of a Northern winter; without, the snow was thick, the
  skies grey, the air bleak; within, all the chambers of the Binnenhof were
  hung with mourning, the cold daylight excluded, candles lit, the company
  sombre and depressed; Mary Stewart had nearly sunk beneath the double burden
  of loss and gain; she wept her still unburied husband, who had been her sole
  support in this alien and detested land, and without much hope or affection
  regarded her delicate child, who seemed not likely to survive his premature
  birth.</p>

  <p>She was surrounded by foreigners, by exiled kinsfolk, and watched by the
  hostile mother of her husband; on that day nineteen years old, of a slight
  presence, without beauty or charm, shy, arrogant, melancholy and ignorant,
  this eldest daughter of Charles I had been unhappy ever since, as a child of
  eleven, she had left Whitehall for the flats of Holland; intensely conscious
  of her royal blood, she had from the first despised this Republic of
  merchants and burghers and been quite aware that the money of the House of
  Orange had tempted the Stewarts into a marriage that was, in their opinion,
  slightly beneath their regal dignity. Her affections were given to her own
  family; not only had she kept aloof from the Dutch people, but she had never
  identified herself with the interests of her husband's House, though she had
  come to regard with some tenderness that husband himself who had so loyally
  supported her distressed family and whose passionate ambitions and melancholy
  hauteur were so akin to her own nature; she was named not Princess of Orange,
  but Princess Royal of England; when she had heard he was ill, she had eagerly
  wished to go to him; but his disease was smallpox and she had been prevented;
  in a few days he was dead, calm, lonely, a Calvinist pastor praying by his
  bed, in his château at Dieren, set amid the bare trees of the wide park. His
  House had fallen with him; the fortunes of Nassau and Stewart were each at
  the nadir; Mary Stewart in the few days between her widowhood and her
  confinement had been compelled to receive, in her black-draped rooms,
  deputations from the States General and forced to beg their protection for
  her son, "should it please God to give her one."</p>

  <p>Their High Mightinesses the States General were her masters and those of
  her frail child; now that only an infant represented the House of Orange, it
  appeared impossible that the enemies of this House, excited by the ambition
  of the last Prince, could be either defeated or appeased; the anti-Orange
  party leapt to an ascendency in Holland as great as that enjoyed by the
  anti-Stewart party in England; it was nine months since Charles I had been
  beheaded; the Dutch might take courage from the fashion in which England had
  flourished since; all of them had been shocked by the violence of that
  terrible deed, but some of them admired the results; while the Orangists
  lamented the sudden and early death of William II, Stadtholder of Holland,
  Zeeland and West Friesland, their opponents rejoiced that this bold, able and
  haughty Prince had been removed, and that with him had gone an office which
  they considered he was making dangerous for the liberties of the Dutch; many
  thought that the death of the posthumous child would decide an embarrassment;
  Mary, forlorn, bereaved, oppressed by gloomy symbols of mourning, bowed by
  the disasters of her own family, may well have wished that she could die with
  the feeble child that was certain to be shorn of his father's honours, and
  whose future was so vague and gloomy.</p>

  <p>Desolate in her black-hung bed, in her darkened room, the young Princess
  lay in exhausted apathy, while through the chambers and the corridors of her
  apartments&mdash;the Stadtholder's quarters in the Binnenhof&mdash;tiptoed
  the whisperers and the intriguers, the exiled English loyalists, the friends
  and partisans of the House of Orange; all disturbed, excited, fearful.</p>

  <p>Two ladies were in the position of comforter to the widowed mother, Amalia
  of Solms-Braunfels, Princess Dowager of Orange, and Elizabeth, daughter of
  James I, Electress Palatine, called Queen of Bohemia, who, under the excuse
  of her husband's relationship with the House of Orange, had long lived under
  the protection and on the charity of the States; the connection between these
  two Princesses was intimate, for Amalia had been waiting-woman to Elizabeth
  when she first fled to the Hague, and through her had met her husband, Prince
  Frederic Henry, Stadtholder of Holland during an age of glorious prosperity;
  Elizabeth, so long unfortunate, who had brought up a large family of
  brilliant, wayward children in penury and exile, was charming, gay,
  seductive, sympathetic, and may have softened the bitter, reserved grief of
  her niece; but Amalia of Solms-Braunfels had never loved her son's wife, who
  was higher born than herself, and cold, arrogant, shy; even their common loss
  had not united them; Mary, prostrate in her widowed bed, pale, weeping,
  almost in despair, yet roused herself to return the challenge with which
  Amalia, robust, powerful, clever, violent, regarded her across the cradle
  where the pitifully small baby, who was the heir of both their loves,
  slept.</p>

  <p>Intense pride supported Mary; she was still Princess Royal of England; she
  would not relinquish the boy; her large mournful eyes sparkled from the
  pillow, even in her weakness she defied the redoubtable widow of Frederic
  Henry; the poor, feeble infant was her son; she regarded him with more
  interest when she reflected on his honours; his position was unique in that
  all his father's titles were his, even when he first drew breath; he was born
  Prince of Orange, Count of Nassau, of Leerdam, of Vianden, of Buren and
  Meurs, Marquis of Ter Veere and Vlissingen, Baron of Breda and Lek, born
  master of a Principality in France, lordships and estates in Germany and the
  Netherlands, the possessor of immense revenues, palaces, jewels, horses and
  yachts; he had (more important than any of these) been born master of a title
  that was one of the most glorious in Europe, which provoked enthusiastic
  loyalty in the hearts of the majority of the people of a nation. These
  reflections formed Mary's one support in her misery; she considered, too,
  that there was still enough (despite lavish donations to the Stewart cause)
  of the fortune of Frederick Henry left to assist the ruined brothers who were
  far nearer her heart than her husband had ever been, or her son could ever
  be; she struggled out of her weakness; she was erect again, with her pale,
  weak baby in her arms, herself pallid, thin, her black brows and sombre eyes,
  her high nose and full lips accentuated by her illness; seated in her
  black-hung room from which all light and air were excluded, she regained her
  reserve, her cold hauteur. As soon as she could speak, she defied Amalia of
  Solms-Braunfels and Amalia of Solms-Braunfels defied her; they were both hard
  women; the sharp quality of their feminine hatred was both mean and
  bitter.</p>

  <p>They quarrelled grimly over the name to be given to the tiny Prince.</p>

  <p>Amalia was, heart and soul, for the House of Orange; she had adored, with
  a pure and devoted passion, Prince Frederic Henry, her husband; she had
  always been intensely proud that she, daughter of a small German
  principality, should have been united to the Nassau family which she
  considered every whit as good as the Stewart family, and from which she was
  herself descended through Elizabeth, sister of William I, Prince of Orange,
  who had married Conrad of Solms-Braunfels; and she was determined to uphold
  the House of Orange on every occasion, by every means, even against the iron
  arrogance of the daughter of a beheaded King.</p>

  <p>The Dowager Princess brought no mean gifts to this resolve; she was now in
  the prime of life, mother of lively, graceful daughters (one excellently
  married to the Elector of Brandenburg), experienced in managing a court, a
  household, a husband and children, a fine financier, at once economical and
  splendid, possessing a keen intellect, a cool courage, a clear knowledge of
  politics and of the characters of her fellows, by all respected, by many
  feared; in appearance she was the opposite of the frail, gaunt, black-haired,
  melancholy Mary Stewart; robust, compact in build, with small features, a
  clear blonde complexion, neat, frizzled, blonde hair, full-bosomed,
  richly-dressed, and, when she chose, gracious and dignified&mdash;and, when
  she chose, violent and insolent; her defects were the same as those of the
  daughter-in-law she hated&mdash;coldness, hardness and pride.</p>

  <p>When these two women quarrelled sharply over the name of the weak baby
  nothing could adjust their dispute; the day fixed for the christening,
  January 4th/14th, 1651, arrived, and still they contended; Mary, passionately
  loyal to the memory of her martyred father and to her exiled brothers, wished
  her son to be called "Charles"; Amalia, passionately loyal to the House of
  Orange and the memory of her brilliant husband, wanted the name "William
  Henry"; she insisted on this desire, without pity for the feelings of the
  widowed orphan-girl, without any consideration for Mary's still feeble
  health, nor for the murmurs that the very delicate child might not live; she
  swerved not an iota from William Henry; she was undoubtedly right; the name,
  William of Orange, was a brilliant heritage, the passport to the affections
  of a people; Charles was, in Holland, alien and of ill omen.</p>

  <p>Mary, tightly controlled, reserved, bitter, swerved not an iota
  either.</p>

  <p>Everything had been prepared for a superb ceremony in the <i>Groote</i> or
  <i>Jacobs Kerk</i>; Nassau and Stewart alike thronged the Binnenhof; the
  Queen of Bohemia, and her children, James of York (Mary's brother), Count
  William Frederic of Nassau-Dietz (Stadtholder of Friesland, friend and
  supporter of the late Stadtholder of Holland, William II), Count John Maurice
  of Nassau-Siegen, Luisa, the Electress of Brandenburg, and representatives of
  the great families of the Brederodes, the Heenvliets, and the
  Beverwaerts&mdash;these all connections of the infant Prince. Also the
  Stanhopes, the Hydes, the Killigrews, a Hohenzollern princess and a
  Portuguese prince, Madame de Dhona and the Earl of Norwich&mdash;these last
  two to carry the important infant. All waited while the dispute raged between
  the two princesses; a woman's intimate contention in which none dared to
  interfere.</p>

  <p>In the <i>Groote Kerk</i> and outside the <i>Groote Kerk</i> awaited
  others to the number of thousands, shivering within the whitewashed walls of
  the gaunt church or beneath icy skies, swept by the sea winds and stung by a
  sprinkle of snow. Two hours passed; every one was exhausted, depressed,
  irritated, some of the women near fainting, some of the men near cursing;
  every one gossiping, wondering; when even Dutch patience was exhausted the
  promised spectacle came in sight through the grey atmosphere, beneath the
  cold sky; State coaches, footmen, companies of archers, blue Nassau liveries,
  Orange scarves (pomp that the crowd whispered was ill-timed), all the Princes
  and Princesses, the English nobles; members, legitimate and illegitimate, of
  the House of Nassau, servants and retainers. In the midst came the coach with
  Madame de Dohna (wife of Christopher Burggrave of Dhona, Captain-General and
  Governor of the Principality of Orange, and sister of Amalia of
  Solms-Braunfels), carrying the Prince wrapped most ostentatiously in ermine,
  satin, black velvet, lace; many were offended by this display, many remarked
  on the delicate aspect of the tiny child and the pretension of the flaunting
  cavalcade.</p>

  <p>The Dowager Princess was in the procession, serene, imposing, indifferent
  to all; with her neat, waved, fair hair, her neat, comely features, her
  jewels, her regal air, she seemed to give confidence to the partisans of the
  House of Orange; her manner was triumphant.</p>

  <p>The godparents were the Queen of Bohemia, the States General and the
  States of Holland, who gave gifts of money and annuities; when all the
  cumbrous parade had got into the bare, gloomy church, the Calvinist pastor,
  Hermanus Antonides Van der Linden, received the infant at the plain font and
  asked his name.</p>

  <p>"William Henry."</p>

  <p>The members of the House of Nassau cast grateful looks at the calm,
  majestic, confident Amalia; she had won the preliminary skirmish of what
  promised to be a long battle. Mary, worn out by nervous strain, had collapsed
  before the implacable purpose of the older woman; shut into her darkened,
  black room, the mother surrendered herself to the misery of loneliness and
  defeat, while the delayed pompous ceremony took place. When the guests
  returned to the Binnenhof they were chilled by the sight of her drawn pallor,
  her frowning brows, her thin figure in the weighty widow's robes, relieved,
  however, by costly diamonds. The serene deputies of the States were further
  disgusted by her blank lack of courtesy, her refusal to offer them her hand,
  her departure into her chamber without sharing the hospitality that was set
  before them; child of England, grandchild of France, she could hold no
  intimacy with burghers, enemies of her dead husband; her relations applauded
  her imprudence; the Nassau family detested both her and the burghers; the
  Princess Amalia alone had an air of composure; she believed she could manage
  all these antagonistic interests; strong, confident, she was eager for the
  contest.</p>

  <p>Winter without, black-hung rooms within, an atmosphere of gloom,
  dissension and suspicion, of bitterness and sorrow; this mournful festival
  was a fitting beginning for a life that was to be in every way sombre,
  difficult and tragic.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

  <p>A few days after the ostentatious and mournful christening of the Prince
  of Orange, a Great Assembly of the States General met in the Knights' Hall or
  <i>Ridderzaal</i>, of the Binnenhof, opposite the Stadtholder's quarters, the
  building which housed the Princess Royal and her son. The opponents of the
  Orange party were determined to make an end of the power of that princely
  House in the Netherlands, and to resist all attempts to reserve for William
  II's infant heir any of his father's dignities; this party was called the
  Loevensteyn faction, because twice its adherents&mdash;once in 1618, and
  again in this very year 1650&mdash;had been confined in the sombre fortress
  of that name (the most important State prison of the Netherlands), on the
  authority of, firstly, Maurice of Orange, secondly on the authority of his
  nephew William II, lately dead. The Orangists, though powerful and popular,
  did not present a united front to these vigorous enemies; not only were the
  two widowed princesses quarrelling with each other, but the representative of
  the Nassau-Dietz branch of the family (always a rival of the elder line),
  Count William Frederic, Stadtholder of Friesland, claimed and received the
  stadtholdership of Groningen and Drenthe which had belonged, since the death
  of Henry Casimir II (elder brother of William Frederic), in 1640, to the
  Princes of Orange, Frederic Henry and his son William II. The Frisian
  Stadtholder, a brave, attractive, handsome man in the prime of life, also
  made an attempt to obtain the dignities of Captain- and Admiral-General of
  the Netherlands, which had hitherto always belonged to the Princes of Orange;
  rival candidates for these supreme commands were Count John Maurice of
  Nassau-Siegen, late Governor of Brazil for the Dutch East India Company, an
  older man, capable, experienced, intelligent, who already filled the post of
  Stadtholder of the Rhinish provinces of the Elector of Brandenburg, and Count
  Brederode, one of the greatest of Dutch nobles and related to the House of
  Nassau through his mother, Anna Johanna of Nassau-Siegen. None of these
  pretenders succeeded, their claims and those of the infant Prince were alike
  ignored; the party now predominant in the Assembly of the States General
  considered that, great as the services of the House of Nassau had been to the
  Dutch people, they had been nobly requited and that the moment had arrived to
  sever the close and paradoxical connection between the first free Republic of
  Europe and the aristocratic, wealthy and autocratic Princes of the House of
  Nassau, whose rule savoured too much of a monarchy or a military
  dictatorship. The offices of Stadtholder and Captain- and Admiral-General
  were left in abeyance&mdash;in the minds of most, abolished; the States
  General would rule themselves on the federal principle, and the largest and
  most powerful State, Holland, would be predominant; this amounted to a
  political revolution; it was the triumph, not of democracy, but of an
  oligarchy; the mass of the people, many of the nobles, and all the clergy
  were Orangist; on the other hand, the wealthy merchants and many of the
  aristocrats supported the new system; in no way, save for their common hatred
  of tyranny, could the new parliamentary government of the Netherlands be
  compared to the new parliamentary government of England. Seeing her son
  stripped of his father's honours and his future so doubtful, the Princess
  Royal turned her attention to the even deeper misfortunes of her own family,
  which were not more hopeful, but nearer to her heart. The curious position
  that now arose cannot be understood without a brief consideration of the
  history of the States General of the Netherlands and the history of the House
  of Nassau and their common progress.</p>

  <p>The Republic of the Netherlands, the United Provinces&mdash;<i>Der
  Unie</i>&mdash;consisted of the signatories to the Union of Utrecht, 1579.
  Holland, Friesland, Groningen, Utrecht, Guelders, Zeeland, and Overyssel;
  these seven provinces composed the Northern portion of the heritage of Philip
  II, King of Spain, in the Netherlands which had successfully revolted against
  his authority; Philip II had succeeded to the various dukedoms, countships,
  lordships and free towns (which had formerly been virtually independent under
  the loose rule of the Holy Roman Empire) through various marriages which
  brought these rights into the House of Burgundy, then into the House of
  Hapsburg, of which Philip II was a member; he was successful in retaining the
  Southern portion of the Netherlands, but the others, after a struggle only to
  be compared, for obstinate heroism, to the resistance of Greece to Persia,
  had obtained their freedom, formed themselves into a federal Republic and
  rapidly risen to be one of the foremost nations of Europe; the Treaty of
  Westphalia in 1648 had finally confirmed them in the independence that even
  their sternest enemies had long ceased to deny, and which had been recognized
  in 1609 by the Twelve Years' Truce (1609-1621).</p>

  <p>The States were the ancient local senates that had governed provinces and
  towns under the overlordships of the Dukes of Burgundy and the King of Spain;
  nor had their union changed their constitution; they were merely bound
  together by a common vow not to make war apart, nor to desert each other when
  war had begun; this and the central authority of the Stadtholders, military
  chief, and possessing considerable weight in the councils of the States, was
  sufficient to consolidate them into a nation; their arms showed a lion
  gripping seven arrows, their device was <i>Eendraacht maakt
  myght</i>&mdash;"Union is Strength," and they were fond of showing a figure
  holding the seven shields of the provinces together by ribbons, enclosed in a
  fence of spears defended by lions.</p>

  <p>This loose form of government was cumbrous and complicated; it irritated
  and annoyed foreigners, few of whom really understood the political machinery
  of the Dutch, since each State had a different system, and each State was
  composed of a confederation of towns, each again with their own peculiarities
  of government; no one class had any preponderance; in Guelders alone the
  nobles shared the political power; in all the other provinces they had but
  one vote; it was the ordinary well-to-do citizen, elected in some cases by
  his fellows to "town councils," in others, self-elected, who ruled the
  country; neither the peasants nor the clergy were represented.</p>

  <p>This civic magistracy formed the basis of the constitution of the
  Netherlands; it must be remembered that not only each State, but each town,
  was autonomous; the States General were elected from the Deputies of the
  States and were entrusted with the diplomatic and military interests of the
  country; they sat perpetually in the Hague which had been their meeting-place
  since 158 5. The towns of Holland had each as spokesman a functionary called
  a Pensionary. They shared, with the States of Holland and the Stadtholder,
  the buildings known as the <i>Binnenhof</i> and <i>Buitenhof</i>; though the
  votes were few the deputies were many, and handsome houses accommodated the
  representatives of the various towns and added to the importance of the
  Hague, the seat of government but not itself of civic or municipal rank; it
  had neither walls nor charters, nor any means of defence, yet it was the
  centre of political activity and intrigue and one of the most important and
  cosmopolitan centres of Europe.</p>

  <p>It remains to be noted that Holland was supreme in influence among the
  States and Amsterdam supreme in influence in Holland; this by reason of the
  huge sums they contributed (more than half the entire revenue) and the number
  of votes they controlled; besides this, Amsterdam, the wealthiest city in the
  world, enjoyed special privileges dating from mediaeval times, and was almost
  in the position of one of the Republic cities of Italy, Genoa or Venice; this
  city represented the rich, cultured merchant class and a huge, enormously
  rich Jewish population which lived in security and freedom; their influence
  was entirely towards peace and toleration; they were jealous of the growing
  power of the Stadtholder and of the military, aristocratic prestige of the
  House of Nassau, whose members had held this office since the formation of
  the Republic.</p>

  <p>This connection between these Princes and the loose civic oligarchy of the
  Netherlands was most curious, and still further confused, in the eyes of
  foreigners, any conception of this strange government.</p>

  <p>The famous hero of the early struggle of the Dutch had been a great German
  noble, William of Orange; he was murdered when the fortunes of the young
  Republic were still regarded as desperate, but his son, Count Maurice of
  Nassau, afterwards Prince of Orange, proved one of the finest soldiers of any
  age, and cleared the liberated lands of the last of their enemies; he died
  unmarried and was followed by his brother, Frederic Henry, an able soldier,
  an attractive gentleman, a clever politician, who died in 1647, when his son,
  William II, received his honours; it was his grandson and the great-grandson
  of William I who was deprived of the offices which these four Princes had
  held in succession from 1589. These offices were the Stadtholdership of
  Holland, West Friesland and Zeeland, and the supreme command of the Dutch
  army and navy; no sinecure, for, save for the twelve years' truce, the
  Republic had been at war since it had desperately struggled into existence.
  "Stadtholder" was a clumsy and obsolete term, taken from the epoch when
  emperor or king appointed a regent or governor of distant provinces; it had
  come to mean the chief magistrate of a republic. This office carried no
  powers of life or death, of declaring war, of raising troops, or levying
  taxes; it was not hereditary; the Stadtholder was a member of the Council of
  State, represented the nobility of Zeeland, the chief of the nobility in
  Holland, and was President of the Court of Justice of Holland and Zeeland; he
  could appoint municipal magistrates and shared with the States the right of
  military appointments, a privilege circumstances had given almost entirely
  into his hands; he had also the right to arbitrate among the States on
  questions in dispute. The Stadtholder was the servant of the States, but
  during the long, prosperous life of Frederic Henry, which was afterwards
  affectionately to be referred to as "the Golden Age," this office had tended
  to assume more a fixed and regal character, to command a vast social
  influence, a deep popular enthusiasm, to express itself with all the pomp and
  dignity of a court&mdash;a court so wealthy, solid and powerful that two
  exiled Queens, Elizabeth of Bohemia and Marie dei Medici, had taken refuge
  there; this last, an intriguing, foolish and very desperate woman, ruined by
  the cold displeasure of Cardinal Richelieu, who was ruling France in the name
  of her son, cast her eye over the worldly goods of Frederic Henry and
  suggested to her daughter, Henrietta Maria, Queen of England, also a very
  desperate woman, an alliance with the House of Nassau.</p>

  <p>In 1641 Prince William of Nassau, aged fifteen, and Mary Stewart, aged
  eleven, were married in Whitehall Palace; Frederic Henry loyally fulfilled
  the bargain that demanded material help in return for the honour of this
  marriage; when troubles came on the Stewarts, the Queen of England speedily
  ran to the Hague for help; between direct loans, advances (raised under
  Frederic Henry's guarantee) on the Crown Jewels, she is said to have returned
  to England with two million <i>livres</i> (£100,000 sterling), besides a
  supply of arms; she obtained further support by the suggestion of another
  marriage, that of her son, the Prince of Wales, with one of Frederic Henry's
  daughters, a proposal that still hung in the balance of Amalia of Solms'
  decision.</p>

  <p>When Frederic Henry died in 1647 and his son succeeded to his offices, an
  even more generous assistance was given to the Stewart cause; Nassau estates
  were mortgaged to raise money, and the Hague became the rallying ground for
  all the exiled cavaliers who fled from England after the tragedy of 1649; but
  Prince William trespassed too far on the popularity and power enjoyed by his
  house; bold, ambitious, of brilliant parts and a restless energy that there
  was no war to absorb, he dared, during a dispute with Amsterdam about a
  standing army, to attempt to overawe the mighty city, always hostile to the
  stadtholders, by force; he succeeded in so far that he had his own way, but
  he had roused a vigorous opposition to his person and his policy that
  amounted, in many hearts, to hatred, and had, on his sudden death, reacted on
  the helplessness of his son, who with the blood of Bourbon, Stewart and
  Medici in his veins, was now no more than a Prince with scattered estates and
  no definite position in Europe; this, for the heir of a House which, for
  three generations, had stood almost on an equal with the sovereigns of
  Europe, amounted to a disaster as vast as that which overwhelmed the exiled
  Charles Stewart; the little Prince was heir to two misfortunes&mdash;that of
  the Nassau, that of the Stewarts. His paternal House, which had risen so high
  and fallen so suddenly, must be considered here, for his inherited honours
  and ideals are the most important factors in his life. The House of Nassau
  was admittedly one of the oldest in Europe, even in an age when the fantasy
  of heralds traced every princely family through Charlemagne and Otto to the
  Roman Caesars; it took its name from one of the most beautiful, romantic and
  majestic provinces of Germany, Nassau, where vineyards and orchards slope to
  the banks of the Rhine and richly wooded heights shade the river Lahn flowing
  through an opulent valley, where noble towns, prosperous villages, numerous
  fortified castles and superb monasteries were hidden among the dense forests
  and protected by the wild mountains of the Taunus, from immemorial time the
  haunts of ancient deities, Silenus and Bacchus, Mithras and Venus, and those
  more northern spirits, hobgoblins, elves and witches.</p>

  <p>In the seventh century Counts of Nassau were already dwelling in this
  fair, romantic, haunted land; the earliest was Bero, son of Dagobert, a
  Merovingian king; they had their seats in the town of Nassau, in Weilburg, in
  Luxembourg, in Dietz, and in Welstein; the massive ruins of their huge
  castles, defiantly placed on lordly eminences, still give majesty to a lovely
  landscape that has not greatly changed in the thousand years that have passed
  since these Ottos and Ruperts established themselves by the waters of the
  Rhine and Lahn.</p>

  <p>In 1255 the two sons of Count Henry II of
  Nassau-Dillenburg-Beilstein-Wiesbaden-Idstein (married to Mechtild, the
  daughter of a Count of Nassau-Guelders, the first connection of Nassau and
  the Netherlands) divided the immense property of their father; Wolfram
  received the estates on the left bank of the Lahn, Weilburg, Idstein,
  Wiesbaden, to which he added Katzenelnbogen by marriage; Otto received
  Dillenburg, Herborn, Hadamar, Beilstein-Siegen.</p>

  <p>The son of Wolfram, Adolf, was elected Holy Roman Emperor (1292); from him
  descended the Counts of Nassau-Weilburg, who added, by marriage, to their
  titles that of Saarbrucken; in 1650 this eldest branch of the House of Nassau
  was represented by Ernest Casimir, Count of Nassau-Weilburg, whose mother was
  a Nassau-Dillenburg, and whose wife was a Van Sayn-Wittgenstein.</p>

  <p>The descendants of the younger branch from Otto, third son of Henry II
  (1247-1289), had acquired a far greater importance; Otto II, grandson of Otto
  I, acquired the Countship of Vianden; his grandson, Engelbrecht I, married
  the heiress of the important lordships of Polanen, Breda and Lek; he took up
  his residence in Breda and thus consolidated the connection of his family
  with the Netherlands; he was followed in his honours by his son John IV, then
  by his grandson, Engelbrecht II, Stadtholder of the Netherlands for the Duke
  of Burgundy, and John V, brother of Engelbrecht II, who brought, by marriage,
  Katzenelnbogen to this branch of the family; his son, Henry III, was
  Stadtholder of Guelders, Holland and Zeeland for the Emperor Maximilian I,
  and married Claudia, daughter of John II of Chalons, sister of Philibert of
  Chalons; from this marriage sprang Renè, Count of Nassau, Vianden, etc., who,
  after the death of his childless uncle Philibert in 1580, became Prince of
  Orange; he was Stadtholder of Holland, Zeeland and Guelders for the Emperor
  Charles V, married the daughter of the Duke of Lorraine, and perished
  childless at the siege of Saint Dizier, 1544.</p>

  <p>Two barren marriages united the enormous wealth and honours of these two
  great families, for Renè of Chalons appointed as his heir William, eldest son
  of William, Count of Nassau-Dillenburg (called "the Rich" or "the Old"), who
  was son of John V and had married Juliana of Stolberg. This William I, Count
  of Nassau, Prince of Orange, further added to his wealth and honours by a
  marriage (the first of four) with Anna, heiress of Maximilian of Egmont,
  Count of Buren, Stadtholder of Freisland, also by the purchase of the
  Marquisate of Ter Veere and Vlissingen, which made him premier noble of
  Zeeland; his direct descendant and heir was in 1650 the infant William Henry,
  born Prince of Orange and Count of Nassau; from William I's younger brother
  John descended the House of Nassau-Dietz (the Stadtholders of Friesland),
  represented in 1650 by William Frederic, who had succeeded his brother Henry
  Casimir I. John Maurice of Nassau-Siegen and his brothers were descended from
  a younger son of this John, Count of Nassau-Dietz, while Nassau-Hadamar was
  represented by Maurice Henry, Count of Nassau-Hadamar; there were besides
  several other members of this family, the branches of which had continually
  intermarried and united themselves with the great German families of Waldeck,
  Limburg-Stirum, Hesse-Cassel, Saxe-Lunenburg, and Sulzbach.</p>

  <p>The family of Chalons, which had inherited the Princedom of Orange through
  Marie de Baux (whose family was said to descend from the royal Visigoths),
  was one of the noblest of France; they had numbered among their titles those
  of Kings of Arles and Counts of Provence. Marie de Baux and her husband, Jean
  de Chalon, were the grandparents of Claudia de Chalon, who brought this
  magnificent heritage to the House of Nassau. Thus, on every side the last
  heir of Orange-Nassau could claim to be of the oldest blood in Europe.</p>

  <p>Through his mother the infant Prince descended from Mary, Queen of Scots,
  from the House of Lorraine, from Henry IV, from Admiral Coligny, from the
  Guise and the Medici; an old table of the Royal Houses of France, Valois and
  Bourbon, shows the families of Nassau, of Lorraine, of Visconti, Conde,
  Chatillon and Stewart as all descended from the Anjou, King of Jerusalem,
  Baldwin (<i>d.</i> 1131); even allowing for the exaggeration of heralds, it
  is obvious that all the princes of Europe were in some degree cousins, and by
  perpetual intermarriage had formed a class apart; separate from, and above,
  all nationality; to the higher ranks of this class belonged the newly born
  child, William Henry, Prince of Orange.</p>

  <p>He did not inherit barren honours or hollow titles; the Nassau counts and
  the Princes of Orange had all been men of remarkable ability, high character,
  notable courage and personal attractiveness; many of them had held great
  offices under the Emperors; Henry of Nassau had placed the crown on the head
  of Charles V, William of Nassau had been close in his confidence; several
  times Princes of this House had been chosen as Governor of the Netherlands;
  they had been distinguished by Imperial honours, created Knights of the
  Golden Fleece, Counts of the Holy Roman Empire; loyal Catholics and loyal
  <i>serviteurs</i> of the Emperor till William I of Orange threw off his
  allegiance to Philip II and to the Pope, to become the creator and head of
  the new Dutch Republic and a Calvinistic Protestant; in him, and in his son
  Maurice, the extraordinary gifts of the family reached a climax; they were
  men of genius, eclipsing in character and achievement even Henry III,
  Engelbrecht I, and Engelbrecht II, Philibert de Chalons and Renè de Nassau,
  those brilliant captains and able administrators. The coat of many
  quarterings used by the new-born Prince, showed, besides the lion and billets
  of Nassau, the arms of Orange and the azure horns of Renè de Chalons; the use
  of these was a condition of the splendid bequest.</p>

  <p>When William I was proscribed by the King of Spain in 1580 he haughtily
  defended himself against the charge of baseness and treachery; in his
  <i>Apologia</i> read before an Assembly of the States General are these fiery
  sentences:</p>

  <p class="letter">"Que Philibert de Chalon, Prince d'Orange, avait conquis la
  Lombardie et le Royaume de Naples àu l'Empereur (Charles-Quint); et que par
  la prise de Rome et du Pape Clement VII, son enemi, it l'avait comblé de
  gloire et de grandeur. Que le neveu de ce Philibert, Rene de Nassau et de
  Chalon, son cousin germain, etait mort a Saint-Dizier au pieds de l'Empereur,
  après avoir repris le dommage d'une bataille perdue, et conquis le Duché de
  Gueldre; Qu'enfin, si ceux de Nassau n'avaient jamais été au monde, et que
  les Princes d'Orange n'esseunt pas tant fait d'exploits considérables avant
  que le Roi (Philippe) fut né, qu'il n'aurait pas mis tant de Titres, de Pays
  et de Seigneuries au front de cette infâme proscription que le declare (lui
  Guillaume) traitre et méchant, crimes que ne retomberont jamais sur aucun de
  sa race..."</p>

  <p>The owner of these <i>titres, pays et seigneuries</i> identified himself
  entirely with the fortunes of the Dutch Republic; he lost three of his
  brothers, Adolf, Henry and Louis, in the long, fierce struggles; two members
  of the Nassau-Dietz line, Ernest Casimir before Roermonde, 1632, Henry
  Casimir before Hulst, 1640, also laid down their lives for the Dutch people;
  the manhood of Maurice of Orange and of Frederic Henry had been entirely
  devoted to the interests of the Netherlands, on her behalf they had engaged
  in a long series of campaigns, which were unequalled for obstinacy and
  tenacity; now all this was over; in this month of January, 1650, the long
  attachment, at once official and passionate, between the Republic and the
  House of Nassau, was severed by the decision of a few men who considered that
  the States could govern themselves and that a powerful aristocratic family,
  now united with royalty, was an anachronism in the councils of, and
  commanding the troops of, a Republic. In this they were undoubtedly right;
  the House of Nassau was a remnant of the ancient feudal system in a
  government founded on modern ideas, the members of this House were
  aristocrats of a narrow military caste set among merchants and industrious
  civilians whose ideals were peace and comfortable development of
  prosperity.</p>

  <p>But what the Loevensteyn party ignored was this anomaly; the Republic had
  only come into existence through the genius of one of these men, and only
  survived through the genius of the others.</p>

  <p>The Orange party were depressed by their defeat; they prepared in gloomy
  defiance a magnificent funeral for William II, who had since November lain in
  state in the Binnenhof; in the bleak greyness of March an immense train of
  huge funeral coaches, of mourners on foot in weepers and black cloaks,
  heralds, horses plumed and hung in black trappings, set out from the Hague
  for Delft where William I had been murdered and where an elaborate monument
  in the high-spired church of Saint Ursula marked the sorrow and gratitude of
  the Seven States and his resting-place; a cushion bearing the insignia of the
  Garter was carried behind the dead Prince, and his brother-in-law, James of
  York, an elegant, grave, soldierly young man, accompanied the cortège, as one
  of the chief mourners, well on to the straight road across the flat country
  towards Delft and the vaults of the family of Orange-Nassau; a medal was
  struck showing this procession of almost regal pretension leaving the
  Binnenhof with, above, Phaeton falling from the skies, and the motto, "By his
  great designs he destroyed himself" (<i>Magnis excidit ausis</i>).</p>

  <p>The States marked with respect but no sympathy this last flourish of a
  fallen power; chief in talents and influence among the new rulers was John de
  Witt, Pensionary of Dordrecht and son of Jacob de Witt, one of the late
  prisoners of Loevensteyn.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

  <p>Though the most important offices held by William II were declared to be
  in abeyance, no change was made in the loose, awkward constitution of the
  Netherlands; the power enjoyed by the Princes of Orange fell naturally to the
  most important State, Holland, and the Pensionary, or spokesman, of this
  Province thus became the principal minister of a civic oligarchy, or
  parliamentary Republic. Thus excluded from all share in the government of the
  country, the Orange party turned to their own affairs, the most important of
  which was the guardianship of the infant Prince; there was the question of
  his education, that of his revenues from the vast Nassau property, and of the
  administration of the township of Orange, through which he held sovereign
  rank, and of his lordships of Breda, Ter Veere, Vlissingen, and others which
  carried with them not only wealth but political weight.</p>

    <p class="caption">Mary Stewart, Princess Royal of England, Princess of
    Orange. By J. Mytens.<br>
    <a href="#app-02">Click here for more information</a></p>
  </div>

  <p>The Princess Royal, on the strength of an unsigned and undated will left
  by her husband, at once claimed the guardianship of her son, and began to
  wield the authority she assumed; Amalia of Solms-Braunfels immediately
  resisted this action; she declared that the Stewart Princess was devoted to
  her brothers and would strip her child of his fortune to help her own ruined
  family, that she was herself a minor and incapable of so much responsibility;
  Frederic William, Elector of Brandenburg, had also something to say in the
  matter, for he was married to Luisa Henrietta, eldest daughter of Frederic
  Henry, and his wife was heiress (after the frail baby) to that Prince's huge
  possessions.</p>

  <p>A tedious, bitter and long dispute followed; the Princess Royal had her
  party eager to support her most extravagant claims; chief among them was John
  Van Kirchhoven, Lord of Heenvliet, Grand Forester of Holland, who had married
  her governess, the widowed Lady Stanhope, daughter of Lord Wootton; another
  champion was Count Louis of Nassau-Beverwaert, an illegitimate grandson of
  Maurice, Prince of Orange, a man of wealth, ability and influence. Also a
  warm friend of the Princess Royal and the Frisian Stadtholder was Cornelis
  Aerrsens, Lord of Sommelsdyck, son of the great statesman admired by
  Richelieu. The exiled English lords, who thronged the Hague, naturally gave
  her their assistance and support; her three brothers were not with her;
  Charles had embarked on his Scottish adventure and James was in France where
  Queen Henrietta Maria and the third son, the Duke of Gloucester, were in
  exile; but the Princess Royal kept up an active correspondence with her
  family, and made no disguise of her passionate attachment to the Stewarts,
  her disdain of the Dutch, and her hatred of Holland; with bold hauteur she
  insisted on the Nassau family leaving her in entire charge of her son, and
  sent a letter to the States to this effect; Constantine Huygens (one of the
  most eminent men of his time), the wise, faithful secretary of Frederic
  Henry, laboured in vain to smooth over these difficulties and bring about
  some understanding between the two Princesses that would at least avoid a
  public scandal.</p>

  <p>But Amalia of Solms-Braunfels was not a woman easily restrained; her next
  action was not honourable, but she certainly appears to have been actuated by
  a passion for the interests of the House of Nassau, as well as by a passion
  for having her own way; and in the belief that the Princess Royal cared
  little for this House and not much more for her son, Amalia of
  Solms-Braunfels was undoubtedly correct.</p>

  <p>The friends of the Princess Royal had been implicated in the attempt (so
  nearly successful) of William II and the Frisian Stadtholder to surprise
  Amsterdam in the summer of 1650; the Dowager Princess now turned on them and
  declared to the triumphant States that she was in favour of bringing these
  accomplices of her son to justice for their illegals acts; she even went so
  far as to demand from the Princess Royal compromising letters in her
  possession; Mary cast all such papers into an iron chest which she locked,
  and sealed, and then delivered to the little Prince's treasurer, obstinately
  refusing to give up anything either to the States or to the Dowager Princess;
  the bitterness between the two women was inflamed to fury; for months the
  question was desperately threshed out in the law courts.</p>

  <p>The end was a compromise in which the Princess Royal was largely defeated;
  she had to share all her rights over her son and his property with Amalia of
  Solms-Braunfels and the Elector of Brandenburg; her power was a half, i.e.
  equal to that of both the others; this arrangement, from which there was no
  appeal, did not improve the relationship between the two Princesses, indeed
  it provided matter for continuous disputes, on large and small matters, and
  endless opportunities for mutual annoyance.</p>

  <p>The faithful Constantine Huygens, Lord of Zuylichem, was appointed
  (October, 1651) "Counsellor and Treasurer" to the Prince of Orange; there was
  no disputing the wisdom of this, nor the loyalty of Huygens to his infant
  master's House for which he always displayed the most intense devotion; here
  the Princesses acted together, as on many occasions they were forced to do,
  Mary signing her proud "Marie," the elder lady her "Amalie P. d'Orange," to
  letters and documents relating to the business of the Prince; it was never
  allowed to be forgotten that Mary was Princess Royal of England and styled
  "Her Royal Highness," and Amalia of Solms-Braunfels a Dowager Princess of
  Orange, merely "Her Highness." This embittering quarrel, if not settled then
  was at least silenced, and some attention could be paid to the cause of
  it&mdash;the little Prince who, to the secret amazement of most people, had
  survived, and seemed likely to grow up to claim his elaborate and complicated
  heritage. His infancy had been passed at the Hague in the care of Heenvliet's
  wife, still known as Lady Stanhope, and housed in the Stadtholder's quarters
  of the Binnenhof or in the palace called the <i>Oude Hof</i> (Old Court)
  where Louise de Coligny, Princess of Orange, had formerly resided, and which
  had been beautified and adorned by her son, Frederic Henry, Prince of
  Orange.</p>

  <p>The infant Prince had no lack of residences. Besides these named, he owned
  a handsome mansion at Honsholredyck, one at Ryswyck-Nieuburg, and an elegant
  hunting-box (<i>Jachslot</i>) at Dieren; there was also the splendid castle
  of the Nassau at Breda, overlooking the beautiful church where Engelbrecht I
  and Engelbrecht II were buried in costly and marvellous tombs.</p>

  <p>The baby remained mainly in the Stadtholder's quarters where he was born,
  and which might be taken as the official residence of the Princes of Orange
  while they had enjoyed the Stadtholdership.</p>

  <p>The building of which these apartments were part was as complicated and
  peculiar as the constitution of the States they housed, and of considerable
  importance; it had come to be almost symbolic of the Dutch Republic and had
  long been regarded by many as sacred to high ideals of liberty, purity and
  honesty of government, the very shrine of political freedom; some portion of
  this building is yet standing and is still used for the purposes of
  government.</p>

  <p>The Hague (<i>S'gravenhage</i>, "the Counts' Hedge" or enclosure) was
  originally a wild, marshy wood used by the Counts of Holland for hunting; a
  palace was built on this site that came gradually to form the centre of a
  small colony of courtiers and servants; it was known as the <i>Hof Van
  Hollandt</i> and was designed as a large square of houses with an imposing
  hall in the centre; bounded on one side by gardens, grazing grounds, orchards
  and stables, and on the other by a large piece of artificial water used for
  horses and domestic purposes; in its glory the <i>Hof Van Hollandt</i> was
  one of the finest mediaeval establishments in Europe, and gradually spread to
  form what was in appearance, if not in name, a town.</p>

  <p>In 1650 when William Henry, Prince of Orange, was born there, these
  buildings had considerably changed since those days of the Middle Ages; yet
  much remained, including the Knights Hall (<i>Ridderzaal</i>), a fine, severe
  Gothic edifice, erected by Floris V, Count of Holland (1296), and the Counts'
  Chapel, ancient, elegant, where some of the counts had been baptized, married
  and buried; afterwards it was given to the Reformed faith and called the
  Cloister Church (<i>Klooster Kerk</i>); the piece of water also remained;
  this large lake, in the middle of which was a small island with trees and
  swans, was called the Vyver and was bounded on one side by the buildings of
  the old <i>Hof Van Hollandt</i>, and on the other by tree-shaded walks, the
  Vyverberg, leading to the Lange-Voorhout, which were the most fashionable in
  the fashionable Hague; these led immediately to the wide square that had been
  the old tilting-ground (<i>Tournooiveld</i>).</p>

  <p>This large collection of buildings of the old <i>Hof</i> was divided into
  two parts; the Binnenhof, or inner court, and the Buitenhof, or outer court;
  over one of the entrance-gates was a house of gloomy and sinister aspect, an
  ancient Spanish prison, then (and now) called the Gevangenpoort; and was used
  for its original purpose. Both the Binnenhof and the Buitenhof had been
  continually rebuilt and modernized, and they contained in 1650 handsome
  offices and chambers, fine halls richly furnished and hung with trophies
  taken in the long Spanish wars, where the States of Holland and the States
  General met; and there were the apartments of the Stadtholder
  (<i>Stadhouderlijk Kwartier</i>) which had been erected in 1622 on the old
  foundations; they were commodious and splendid, most of the rooms looked out
  on to the courtyard and the Hall of the Knights; in front of this Hall John
  Van Oldenbarnevelt had been judicially murdered in 1618, and Prince Maurice
  of Orange had been accused of gazing in triumph from the windows of the
  Stadtholder's quarters at the annihilation of his enemy.</p>

  <p>It does not appear likely that he did so; but the soldier was the enemy of
  the statesman, and the anecdote is illuminating as showing the juxtaposition
  of the parties, always face to face in enmity; then the Stadtholder had
  triumphed in the person of Maurice; now, in the person of his nephew, William
  II, the Stadtholder had fallen, and it was the principles, the ideals, the
  convictions of Oldenbarneveldt that were in the ascendant. At the end of the
  Binnenhof and overlooking the waters of the Vyver, Count John Maurice of
  Nassau-Siegen had recently built an elegant mansion, conspicuous for beauty
  even in the Hague, where there were so many elegant mansions: it was
  sumptuously furnished and adorned by rare woods and curiosities brought from
  Brazil; Count John Maurice, gallant, amiable, subtle, and bold, clever and
  attractive, was a favourite with all; he was unmarried and frequently absent
  on his duties in the Rhenish Provinces of the Elector of Brandenburg, where,
  in Cleves, he had a charming residence. Among his exotic treasures was a
  parrot that spoke Dutch and Spanish and "knew his master for a great man."
  Amalia of Solms-Braunfels lived either in the Old Court, on her estates in
  Turnhout, Brabant, in Sevenbergen in Holland, or in the charming little
  palace she had recently built outside the Hague, in the ancient and delicious
  forests that were once the hunting and pleasure grounds of the Counts of
  Holland, called "the House in the Wood" (<i>Huis ten Bosch</i>); she lived
  splendidly, though her revenues were small, and maintained a state as
  pretentious as that of her royal daughter-in-law; she was not often long
  absent from the Hague and her grandson; she kept a jealous, watchful eye on
  his person and his interests.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

  <p>The country that the Princess Royal so detested, and in which her son
  might look to find so peculiar a heritage, was one of the most important in
  Europe; despite her odd constitution and her odd position among neighbouring
  sovereigns, the Dutch nation had risen through the force of native genius to
  a foremost place among the peoples; the small Republic that had defeated the
  vast Empire was in every way wealthy, prosperous, notable, admired and
  envied.</p>

  <p>Her manufactures and her maritime commerce were of the first importance;
  the Dutch were "the common carriers of the world "; through their two Indian
  Companies, with their great fleet of ships, they had the trade of the East in
  their hands; they owned many of the old Portuguese colonies such as Java,
  Ceylon, and the Cape of Good Hope; the coasts of Malabar and Coromandel were
  under their control; they traded as far as China, Japan and Brazil; Amsterdam
  was the exchange market of the world.</p>

  <p>Besides thus almost monopolizing the trade with the New World, the Dutch
  made huge revenues by the herring fisheries, woollen goods, linen and
  embroideries; they traded with the Northern nations and imported from the
  shores of the Baltic quantities of raw material, wheat, iron, wood, copper,
  hemp and furs; Amsterdam was not only the centre of universal commerce, her
  bank, founded in 1609, made her as respected by kings as once had been the
  republics of Venice or Genoa; there were many other cities&mdash;Utrecht,
  Haarlem, Dordtrecht, Delft, Leyden, Leuwarden, Arnhem, Nymwegen,
  Rotterdam&mdash;admirable for wealth and beauty; the whole country was a
  matter for the wonder and applause of foreigners; nowhere else could so much
  prosperity, liberty, culture, tolerance and elegance be found; nowhere else
  was there so little poverty, vice or crime.</p>

  <p>In ease and comfort, in cleanliness and refinement, the Dutch were as far
  ahead of their neighbours as they were in high-mindedness, sincerity, honesty
  and simplicity.</p>

  <p>All travellers bore witness to their austere yet tender family life, to
  their sobriety and chastity, to their probity in politics, their passion for
  liberty and independence, and to that strong attachment to a stalwart, hard
  religion that was the keynote of the national character.</p>

  <p>Loyalty to Protestantism had inspired in them that resistance to Philip II
  from which had sprung their existence, and though they had been divided among
  themselves as to the doctrines of freewill and predestination, though a third
  of the population were Roman Catholics and many were tinged by the new
  philosophy of Des Cartes, still it was true that a firm reliance on the stern
  decrees of an overruling God, that cheerful submission to pain and trouble,
  that manly endurance of sorrow and failure, that steady application to duty
  and labour, which are the basis of Calvinism, were the main foundations of
  the national character, which was resolute, virile, hardy and obstinate.
  Notwithstanding their religious zeal, the number of their churches, the
  length of their services and the rigour of their pastors, their faith might
  almost be said to be more a belief in Providence than in a personal deity, so
  far removed was it from spirituality, so deeply was it interwoven with a
  robust material life, so completely was it formalized; the belief in
  predestination gave the last touch of fatalism to this implacable creed which
  so exactly suited a brave, intelligent people without wit or imagination;
  predestination had been subscribed to by the Princes of Orange; it dignified
  their glories to believe that they were Heaven-sent.</p>

  <p>Religious tolerance was permitted in the Netherlands partly because of the
  honest, placid temper of the people, partly because of their absorption in
  trade and moneymaking; the Jews were unmolested, the Roman Catholics freer
  than in any country that was not Roman Catholic; the English Puritans were
  received, and their teachings influenced the national thought; while Renè Des
  Cartes found this the only country where he could pursue his speculations in
  safety.</p>

  <p>The art, learning and science of the Netherlands had, amid this freedom
  and prosperity, come to a glorious blooming; in every direction resplendent
  names adorned her annals. Vondel, Rembrandt, Hooft, Huygens, Zwammerdam,
  Voetius, Graaff, Vossius and Scaliger were a few of those that had made the
  Dutch famous throughout the world.</p>

  <p>Agriculture had been brought to a pitch of excellence that amazed
  foreigners; the peasants were industrious, happy, comfortable; as much could
  be said of the artisans.</p>

  <p>In the cities the standard of culture and elegance was very high; though
  morals were pure and tastes simple, family life was adorned by considerable
  luxury; music, painting, sculpture, architecture, gardening&mdash;all
  contributed to the pleasures obtainable in this era of wealth and ease; the
  upper and middle classes were well educated, refined, disdainful of vice or
  extravagance, intelligently interested in art and science, in philosophy and
  politics.</p>

  <p>A Dutch peculiarity was the press, the first free press of Europe; papers
  like the <i>Gazette de France</i> were mere government mouthpieces; the Dutch
  news-sheets were privately owned, expressed themselves freely, and rapidly
  became a power in Europe; the Dutch had a passion for reading these sheets,
  they permeated Europe and foreign kings frequently endeavoured in vain to
  suppress them; the Dutch were also expert pamphleteers and medallists, and
  through these means expressed without hesitation their opinion of their
  neighbours' actions; in short, news, opinions, scandals, comments, ideas that
  were rigorously suppressed in the rest of Europe, found a ready publication
  and a large audience in the Netherlands, and from there were spread over the
  world.</p>

  <p>The hospitals, orphanages and almshouses of the Dutch were models of their
  kind; it might be said that in no other country were poverty, age and infancy
  so protected.</p>

  <p>This flourishing, mighty, free, elegant and enlightened nation had risen
  in less than a hundred years from the apanages of the House of Hapsburg; in
  the doctrines of John Calvin and in their own characters they had found, with
  no outside help, sufficient strength to raise themselves into this
  magnificent position. And this in spite of the fact that nearly the entire
  country was beneath the sea level and only saved from the waters by the
  ceaseless efforts of engineers and the people's own labour; the Dutch had
  continually to recreate their own land, to preserve it by their toil as they
  had preserved it with their blood.</p>

  <p>It was not strange that their patriotism was of a fiery, passionate order,
  stronger even than their industrious love of wealth, one with their stern,
  unyielding faith.</p>

        id="ch-05"></a>

  <h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

  <p>While the infant Prince in the Stadtholder's quarters in the Binnenhof was
  learning, under the guidance of Lady Stanhope and other English women, how to
  walk, playing with rattles and being taken for sedate exercise in heavy
  coaches through the noble, shady streets of the Hague, he was already a
  focus, not only of family dissensions, but of political agitation and
  discontent. The Princess Royal did not seem particularly interested in his
  fortunes, at least she made no effort to advance them; the most devoted
  followers of the House of Nassau were disgusted by her dry acceptance of
  their services. These men who knew that through their loyalty to the heir of
  Orange they could expect no promotion in army, navy or State service felt
  that they deserved some recognition for a loyalty which the little Prince
  might never live to reward; but the Princess Royal of England accepted all
  these sacrifices as a matter of course, and could not, either out of shyness
  or pride, bring herself to reward them as much as by a gracious smile or
  kindly praise. Her slight figure, her long, pale face with the large dark
  eyes, sullen, sombre, foreign, her cold demeanour and her almost perpetual
  silence estranged from her son's cause many who would otherwise gladly have
  embraced his party; her rival, the Princess Amalia, on the other hand, was
  too pleasant and amiable to all; she "loved to play a double game," and made
  herself very agreeable to the Republican party, which now enjoyed the
  supremacy in the Government and were represented principally by the powerful
  State of Holland, whose spokesman was their Grand Pensionary, Adrian Van
  Pauw, who was known to be considerably under the influence of the brilliant
  young Pensionary of Dortrecht [Dordrecht], John de Witt. A man who might be
  taken as the obvious head of the House of Nassau, Count William Frederic of
  Nassau-Dietz, Stadtholder of Friesland and Groningen, though brave, able,
  amiable and energetic, was not trusted by either of these ladies, who were
  both jealous of his pretensions to guide the fallen fortunes of the little
  Prince. Count William Frederic still hoped to obtain for himself the office
  of Captain- and Admiral-General of the United Provinces, but this did not
  prevent his feeling a genuine loyalty for his kinsman, and an ardent desire
  to preserve the prestige and glory of the House to which he belonged. Amalia,
  though distrusting him, consented to his betrothal to her daughter Albertina,
  a contract which gave him yet a further interest in the fortunes of the heir
  of Frederic Henry. It soon became apparent that the deep, passionate and
  almost fanatic devotion of the Dutch people to the House of Nassau was by no
  means extinct, and was roused to ardent and lively proportions by the mere
  sight of the infant Prince; he could not be shown at the windows of the
  Binnenhof, or taken abroad with his nurses in the coach, without people
  shouting for him in the streets, or a procession of boys decked with orange
  ribbons following his progress and shouting his beloved name. The very
  smallness and puny aspect of the child seemed to rouse a deeper loyalty and
  warmer affection in the hearts of the people. Rude, popular rhymes were sung,
  one of which was:</p>

  <p class="poem">Though our Prince be very small,<br>
  Yet he'll be Stadtholder after all!</p>

  <p>It must be remembered that the bulk of the people had no more share in the
  government than they had had under the Stadtholdership; the political
  revolution which had taken the dominant power from the Princes of Orange and
  given it to the States of Holland made no difference whatever to the majority
  of the inhabitants of the Netherlands; it was not a popular government which
  had succeeded an unpopular one, nor a democratic which had succeeded an
  aristocratic; the great majority of the Dutch could see no reason why the
  heir of the House of Orange should be excluded from the offices held by his
  ancestors&mdash;offices which had been given to these same ancestors out of a
  deep and passionate instinct of gratitude and hero-worship; as it became more
  and more evident that the claims of the little Prince to any share in the
  honours of his ancestors were to be ignored, instances of widespread and
  fierce resentment broke out. When he was little more than a year old, the
  arms of Holland were substituted for the arms of Orange on the standards
  belonging to the Hague Militia; as soon as this was perceived a fierce riot
  ensued, and the offending ensign was shot to pieces by an enraged Orange mob.
  The Calvinist clergy, whose influence was immense, were to a man warmly on
  the side of the House of Nassau; the Army and, to a lesser extent, the Navy,
  were also secretly enthusiastic for a House which had been so resplendent in
  military prestige. With the clergy, the soldiers, a large proportion of the
  great nobles and a large proportion of the common people thus attached to the
  person of the baby Prince, the States of Holland had no easy task, first to
  consolidate and then direct a Government which was in its essence really so
  unpopular, which offended so much sincere feeling and so intense an emotion
  on the part of the majority of the people, and which was inspired by
  principles that were approved of only by a minority. Foremost among this
  minority of intellectual, well-meaning and high-minded patriots was the
  Pensionary of Dordtrecht who, though one of the youngest members in that
  Assembly, had already shown (though only in his twenty-seventh year) a
  brilliancy of talent and a firmness of character which destined him to play a
  great part in the government of his country. It was inevitable, now that the
  consolidating authority of the Stadtholders had been abolished, that some
  other authority should be found to take its place, for it was absolutely
  necessary that the vague and loose Confederation of the United States should
  be bound together by one central power in a compact form. This power seemed
  likely to be found in the person of John de Witt&mdash;a man who was capable
  of assuming the power once wielded by the Stadtholders and of using it for
  the benefit, if not of all the States, at least for that of his native State
  of Holland.</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>John de Witt was a native of Dordrecht, where he was born on September
  14th/24th, 1625, the youngest of the four children of Jacob de Witt. He had
  an elder brother, Cornelius, and two sisters. The family had always lived in
  the beautiful and famous island city of Dordrecht; they belonged to the
  higher ranks of the middle classes, and among the ancestors of John de Witt
  were town councillors, sheriffs and a burgomaster. His father, Jacob de Witt,
  had been six times Burgomaster of Dordrecht; simple, stern, austere and
  religious, Jacob de Witt was a man of considerable intelligence and force of
  character. His wife was also pious and strict, and the family was conducted
  on the sternest models of Calvinistic severity and intellectual culture. John
  de Witt was excellently educated at the Latin school at Dordrecht and at
  Leyden, where he went with his brother in 1641, and afterwards at Anger,
  where he took the degree of Doctor of Law.</p>

  <p>Afterwards he toured France with his brother Cornelius. He then came to
  England, where he was received by Cromwell&mdash;then calling himself Lord
  General&mdash;and the Parliamentary Commissioners, who were in conference
  with Charles I. John de Witt was in 1650 settled at the Hague, where he
  worked as a lawyer, giving up his leisure to mathematics. His taste was for
  public life; he was ardently interested in questions of government and
  inspired by the changes of the times as well as encouraged by a knowledge of
  his own talent and application, and the applause and admiration of his
  friends who marked with pleasure his growing abilities. He was not, however,
  a pedantic or a dull young man. His appearance was graceful and elegant. He
  had been very delicate in childhood, and was then about the middle height, of
  a prepossessing aspect&mdash;a long, smooth face, large, dark, melancholy
  eyes, a graceful carriage, an impressive air, and a manner sometimes
  seductively vivacious and sometimes impressively reserved. He was skilled in
  tennis, in dancing, in music and in games; he wrote poetry, and his religious
  beliefs were tempered by the Cartesian philosophies then becoming so
  fashionable among the intellectuals of the Hague.</p>

  <p>The imprisonment of his father, Jacob de Witt, in Loevensteyn (August
  1650), definitely coloured John de Witt's political views, and roused in him
  an ardent dislike of arbitrary power and a peculiar antagonism towards the
  House of Nassau. Jacob de Witt bore his imprisonment with the proud serenity
  of a martyr. After three weeks of confinement, during which time his sons had
  dreaded for him the fate of Oldenbarneveldt, he was released. The submission
  of the Town Council, who had been forced to consent to receive the
  resignation of the imprisoned deputy, had satisfied the affronted and haughty
  William II. The sons of Jacob de Witt had firmly refused to make any act of
  submission to obtain their father's release. They declared that they would
  not, by interceding for him, place him in the light of a culprit. The
  inflexible honesty and the hard obstinacy of the De Witts were rewarded a few
  months later, when the death of the Prince of Orange removed all obstacles to
  the restoration of the elder to his honours and to the political advancement
  of the younger.</p>

  <p>John de Witt, writing a letter to his uncle in which he referred to this
  event, made the remark that he prayed God "that so unforeseen an event may
  tend to the public welfare." It certainly tended to his own welfare. A few
  months afterwards he was appointed Pensionary of Dordrecht. Pensionary was a
  curious name arising from the fact that the holder of this office received an
  annual pension which was given to the representatives of the towns of the
  State of Holland; as they were the spokesmen for their fellow-deputies,
  oratory was one of their most necessary qualifications. The office of
  Pensionary of Dordrecht was the next step to the most important office in the
  council of the State, that of the Grand Pensionary of Holland, and the town
  of Dordrecht ranked first in the sittings of the Assembly. It was a most
  honourable, exacting and powerful position for so young a man to hold,
  especially at this juncture when the States of Holland were predominant in
  the councils of the country. Neither he nor his father seem to have very
  easily or generously overlooked the arbitrary action of the Prince of Orange
  in the matter of the Loevensteyn affair.</p>

  <p>It was said that Jacob de Witt seldom saw his sons without repeating to
  them, "Remember Loevensteyn." One of the first acts of John de Witt in his
  new office was to go to the State of Zeeland with three other deputies, and
  to dissuade them from appointing William II's second son as Captain- and
  Admiral-General. Zeeland was the province which gave the most trouble to the
  States of Holland; it was almost entirely in favour of the House of Nassau,
  which had such an influence in that province by the possession of the most
  important marquisate of Ter Veere and Vlissingen; De Witt and his
  fellow-deputies with difficulty restrained the States of Zeeland; a year
  later they broke out again with demands for the re-establishment of the
  infant Prince's authority, if not as Stadtholder, at least as Admiral and
  Lieutenant-General, and they suggested Count William Frederic of
  Nassau-Dietz, who had indeed been secretly using his influence for this end,
  as a lieutenant for the infant Prince. This resolution on the part of the
  State of Zeeland had been considerably animated by a formidable popular
  rising in the towns of Middleburg, Vlissingen and Ter Veere. As the little
  Prince of Orange was now only eighteen months old (August 1652), and his
  party appeared so lively and so dangerous, the State of Holland decided to
  check at once this revolt against their authority and the newly-established
  Government. De Witt again went to Middleburg, traversing a country where his
  progress was disturbed by people clamouring for the restoration of the House
  of Nassau. When he reached Middleburg, he was even warned that he might be
  massacred, either on entering or leaving the ancient Abbey, where the
  deliberations of the States of Zeeland were held.</p>

  <p>An angry crowd surrounded the house in which John de Witt lodged, and, as
  he remarked grimly, "were quite willing to save him the trouble and expense
  of a return journey." He was placed under the protection of an armed force;
  as the deputies from the States General went from their apartments to the
  Abbey the crowd threatened them with angry outcries, and De Witt believed
  that he was in danger of being massacred. Nor were the deputies of Zeeland,
  though more cool and moderate in their behaviour, any the less backward in
  their devotion to the infant Prince. They refused to leave the matter in
  abeyance until the child came of age, and voted for the nomination of William
  as Admiral- and Captain-General of the States, though they conducted
  themselves with courtesy and respect towards the States of Holland. The zeal
  and ability of John de Witt, however, succeeded in nullifying this attempt of
  Zeeland to restore the infant Prince to the honours of his father. Zeeland
  gave way, or at least waived the question, and John de Witt returned to the
  Hague with an increased reputation for wisdom and zeal and, even more
  definitely than he was before, an opponent of the Orangist party, of their
  ambitious hopes for the future fortunes of their chief, and of any possible
  elevation of the little Prince of Orange to the offices of his ancestors.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

  <p>The two guardians of the infant Prince and his nearest male relative were
  all equally baffled by the energetic measures of the State of Holland
  inspired by John de Witt. Princess Amalia played a careful and waiting game.
  She ingratiated herself as much as possible with the ruling party and
  affected to believe that her grandson's interest was safe in their hands. The
  Princess Royal held herself aloof from all, mingling only with a small circle
  of intimates, expressing no hostility to the Loevensteyn party and no
  friendliness to the Orange party, but entirely absorbed in the fortunes of
  the House of Stewart, which still appeared ruined and hopeless. Count William
  Frederic&mdash;then married to Albertina, Amalia's daughter&mdash;found his
  ambitious schemes also set back, and was forced to content himself with
  turning his attention to the more Northern Provinces where his sway was not
  disputed, nor his limited power disturbed. He, however, in common with all
  the Orangists, felt the satisfaction of seeing Holland involved in a maritime
  war with Oliver Cromwell, Lord Protector of England's new Commonwealth. This
  was, of course, particularly gratifying to the Stewart Princess, who hoped
  that her brother might find his count in the conflict; Charles indeed sent
  from France to know if some of the Netherlands' ships might not be put under
  his command; the proposal was considered, but finally not accepted.
  Nevertheless, a war with the party that had beheaded Charles I and exiled
  Charles II could not fail to be extremely pleasing to all the adherents of
  the Prince of Orange and his Stewart mother, though, in fighting Oliver
  Cromwell, the States General had not espoused the cause of the exiled King.
  At the same time, the countenance they had given to the brother of the
  Princess Royal of England, the number of royalist exiles at the Hague, the
  insults which Cromwell's deputies had received when they had gone on a
  mission to the States General, the general feeling in England that the
  sentiment of the Dutch was royalist, and that they were harbouring the
  enemies of the new Commonwealth, had certainly been among the contributory
  causes of the war, the ostensible excuse for which was mercantile jealousy
  and a dispute as to the supremacy of the seas; a war in which the Dutch could
  scarcely hold their own, even under such an admiral as Tromp, with the fleet
  of the English Commonwealth, was not popular in the United Provinces, and the
  feeling that they had been involved in this contest by their connection with
  the Stewarts and the Prince of Orange, went far to confirm the new governors
  of the country in their stern resolve to exclude both Stewart and Nassau from
  any future intermeddling in the affairs of the Netherlands. When a hostile
  fleet was lying off the Dutch coast, when the cherished commerce and the
  carefully built-up trade of the Republic seemed to be alike ruined, when
  excited crowds were parading the streets accusing the deputies of procuring
  the downfall of the country, John de Witt was called to the onerous position
  of Grand Pensionary of Holland. The burden of responsibility was immense, so
  sharp was the division of opinion, so bitter the conflict of ideas in which
  the country was engaged; in brief, so vehement was the temper of the moment
  that several of John de Witt's friends warned him of a fearful destiny if he
  ventured to undertake so difficult and dangerous a post as that of chief
  minister of a country so torn by internal dissension and so threatened by
  dangerous foes; they even said in a tone of prophecy: "If you accept this
  office you must expect to be put in your coffin not whole but in
  fragments."</p>

  <p>John de Witt, nevertheless, accepted the dangerous honour.</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>While the low-down dunes of Holland, bordering the North Sea, were covered
  by anxious spectators fearfully regarding the splendid menace of English
  ships which covered the horizon, the Princess Royal took her little son to
  Breda, to receive homage as Baron of that ancient town. He was now a pale,
  dark-eyed child, wearing a close linen cap with plumes, a dress with a full
  skirt, a tight bodice, and the pale blue ribbon of Order of the Garter which
  had been recently sent him by his uncle, Charles II. He had just been painted
  by the famous painter, Honthorst, who had shown him with his little aunt
  Mary, Princess of Orange, afterwards Duchess of Zimmern, handing her a stiff
  wreath of blossoms, and holding up an apron full of flowers. He was a grave,
  serious child with a face of character and charm which flattered his mother
  by a strong resemblance to the Stewarts. His complexion was clear and pale,
  his hair a deep chestnut colour. He was already possessed of considerable
  dignity.</p>

  <p>In his own duchy of Breda he had received the enthusiastic homage of the
  people, and then, when his mother brought him back to the Hague, there was at
  once a popular demonstration in his favour; as the Princess Royal drove in
  her state coach through the fine tree-shaded streets of the Hague she
  observed bands of boys wearing Orange rosettes and shouting for her son. The
  whole place was in a state of agitation and excitement; the sight of the
  little Prince seemed further to inflame a people already disturbed by a war
  under which the country appeared to be sinking and the mistrust engendered by
  a new and untried form of government. The next day a considerable crowd had
  gathered in the large courtyard of the Binnenhof; men sported Orange favours,
  waved Orange flags and called out for the adored Prince to be shown them. In
  cool defiance of prudent counsellors, the Princess Royal took her little son
  to the window, and held him up in full view of the enthusiastic populace. The
  sight of the grave child who had no common appearance, whose aspect, indeed,
  had the charm of a princely race, further wrought up the people to
  demonstrations of loyalty to the House to which they were attached with a
  devotion unique in the annals of princes and people. While the child remained
  at the window, the mob gathered in strength, surged about the courts of the
  Binnenhof, and finally broke into the streets of the Hague, where they made a
  dangerous demonstration of their sympathies with the young Prince, menacing
  the houses and breaking the windows of his known opponents, among whom was
  Jacob de Witt; so menacing did the situation become that the magistrates
  called out the Militia, but these refused to restore order until their banner
  with the arms of Nassau was again given to them. Resort was then made to the
  guards of the States General, but these had been the bodyguard of the
  Orangists, and proved sullen, reluctant, and unreliable.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the riot was increasing in force and proportion, and it became
  necessary to send for more troops to subdue the Orangists, which could only
  be done by violent methods. Some ringleaders were captured and severely
  punished, others fled from the Hague. Count William Frederic of Nassau-Dietz
  secretly encouraged such disorders in every part of the country. The Princess
  Amalia endeavoured to dissociate herself from the malcontents and yet to
  remain on good terms with them. The Princess Royal disclosed herself to no
  one, neither defying authority nor courting popular favour. Pride then
  provoked in her a deeper interest in her son than she had previously known;
  she could not be altogether indifferent to a child whose popularity was so
  gratifying to her vanity, and the glorious prestige of whose name so adorned
  her arrogance.</p>

  <p>While Holland and England were convulsed by the great maritime war when
  Tromp and De Ruyter fought up and down the North Sea, while the Royalist
  English exiles at the Hague were distracted by the hope of a speedy
  restoration of their King, the Princess Royal and the Princess Amalia, though
  still severe enemies, united in a scheme for the serious education of the
  child. They were at one at least in this, and supported by the Elector of
  Brandenburg and Count William Frederic of Nassau-Dietz, Amalia's sons-in-law.
  The Prince must be prepared for no common destiny; though his immediate
  position and his immediate prospects were only those of a great noble, he
  must be trained as if he was of royal birth and assured of regal fortunes. It
  was now clear that the audacious attempt of William II on Amsterdam, however
  much it might have outraged that independent and wealthy city, which had
  never cherished any great gratitude towards the Princes of Orange, but had
  considered they had been well paid for their services, had not alienated the
  great patriotic tradition of devotion to the House of Nassau which appeared
  to glow as brightly as ever in the hearts of the masses of the people. It
  might well seem to the guardians of the little Prince of Orange that any day
  there might be a sudden turn of fortune, which would set him as high as any
  of his ancestors had been. The new government of the States of Holland was
  likely to arouse the acute jealousy of the other Provinces who would find
  themselves more or less sacrificed to the interests and ideals of their
  powerful neighbour. The odium of the war would, of course, fall on this
  government, and though the steady genius of a man like John de Witt might,
  for a while, resist this, the Orange party believed that he could not
  permanently injure the prospects of the little Prince. William, therefore,
  was to be trained and educated as the grandchild of England and France and
  heir to all the dignities of the House of Nassau.</p>

  <p>A memorandum is still extant which was apparently drawn up about this
  period. It is a plan of education for the little Prince, and was evidently
  submitted for approval to the two Princesses; there is no reason to doubt
  that the scheme here laid down was that which was mainly adopted. The
  document is in French and entitled <i>Discours sur la Nourriture de Son
  Altesse Monseigneur le Prince d'Orange</i>. Here it was boldly stated (it
  must have been in the hearts and frequently on the lips of all who surrounded
  the little Prince) that he should be fitted for the offices filled by his
  ancestors which again, "by the turn of the wheel of time," would be bestowed
  on him. Attention was to be paid to his health, always frail; he was to be
  strengthened by fresh air, and exercise, and a simple diet; most scrupulous
  pains appear to have been taken on this matter, but the little Prince still
  went in tight bodices, with full heavy skirts, with a bare chest and
  arms&mdash;a cumbersome and unhealthy attire. The memorandum also suggests
  that it would be wise to keep the little boy entirely out of the hands of
  doctors, who, the writer thinks, "often ruin their patients by medicines."
  Perhaps to the early inculcation of these principles William III owed his
  lifelong dislike of physicians, and the obstinacy with which to the last he
  defied their advice. According to this scheme, the Prince was to have a
  governor, a tutor and a page; the governor was to be tactful, experienced,
  fond of outdoor games and exercise, and a good conversationalist on matters
  of topical interest, among which the army and the navy must be frequently
  introduced. The rudiments of war were to be learnt with the rudiments of
  speech; the little boy was to trace on paper and in sand the letters of the
  alphabet and the emblems of war at one and the same time. It was particularly
  recommended that his tutor should be lively, careful and worldly, not a mere
  gloomy pedant; and the page was to be gay, gentle and useful. Although his
  mother was a member of the Church of England, the Prince was to be brought up
  in strict Calvinism; not only was he to attend all the usual services of that
  church, he was to read the Scriptures daily, and particularly the Psalms, so
  that they might be a comfort and help to him in some possible adversity. He
  was also to compose a private prayer for himself, to suit the circumstances
  of the moment, and to give alms privately to deserving cases.</p>

  <p>The memorandum touches on politics; the Prince was to cultivate the
  affections of the States General, in particular that of the most powerful,
  Holland. He was to endeavour not to use his ambiguous position in the country
  to stir up any manner of political strife; at the same time it was
  recommended that he should learn tactful and pleasant ways of dealing with
  people of all complexions and parties. He was not to deceive, yet not
  forbidden to dissimulate&mdash;a fine but perhaps rather Machiavellian
  distinction of which a great deal was afterwards made by those persons who
  declared the Prince to have practised this axiom too early and too
  successfully; it is doubtful, however, whether the child was ever taught
  deliberately any artful or crooked behaviour; the meaning seemed more to be
  that he was to exercise the graceful tact for which his grandfather, Frederic
  Henry, had been so famous, and which caused it to be said of him that he only
  made enemies for the pleasure of winning them over. None of the Nassau
  princes, with the exception, perhaps, of Maurice of Orange, had ever been
  deficient in this graceful, subtle, and most necessary tact, without which,
  indeed, it would be almost impossible for anyone to play an important part in
  politics in any circumstances or in any place. William the Silent, himself,
  received this name from the fact that he was able to conceal his astonishment
  and horror when Henry III prematurely confided to him the scheme for the
  massacre of St. Bartholomew; an unsophisticated candour and a frank display
  of all thoughts and emotions is only possible to those who lead the most
  simple and austere of lives, removed from the theatre of great events. There
  was, therefore, nothing extraordinary that the guardians and tutors of the
  little Prince of Orange&mdash;who was placed in so peculiar a position,
  surrounded by so much suspicion and enmity on the one hand, and so much
  unguarded enthusiasm and loyalty on the other&mdash;should endeavour to train
  him to conceal his feelings under a proud reserve and bear himself with an
  indiscriminate and meaningless courtesy towards friend and foe alike. The
  child, remarkably quick and intelligent, soon learnt these earliest lessons.
  He found himself surrounded by deference; the first title that saluted his
  ears was, "Your Highness," among the first words that met his infant eyes
  were those of his own motto: "Ce sera Nassau, moi, je maintaindrai."</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

  <p>The vigorous maritime war between the Netherlands and England lasted for
  two years, from 1652 to 1654, and interrupted the settlement of the new
  Constitution in England as much as it disturbed the settlement of the new
  Constitution in Holland. It did not restore the fortunes of the House of
  Stewart, which seemed to have been finally overthrown at the Battle of
  Worcester (1651), though secret encouragement and even secret funds were
  supplied by the Dutch to the exiled Charles II. In 1653 the Orangist
  influence in Holland was such that Dutch ports were permitted to shelter
  royalist vessels, but, however, neither King Charles himself nor Rupert, the
  son of the Queen of Bohemia who continued to live at the Hague and support
  the Princess Royal and her party, were allowed to land in the Netherlands.
  Prudent, patriotic Dutchmen were afforded matter for much misgiving in all
  these divisions. It was almost impossible to preserve a firm government and
  present a sound front to the enemy with these fierce differences of opinion,
  and this vehement party spirit running through the army, the navy, the civil
  service, the populace&mdash;indeed, through all the national life; the lack
  of strong central authority, which had been supplied by the Stadtholders, was
  keenly felt; nor were the troubles of the Dutch Republic lightened by the
  fact that, though they valiantly held their own on the seas, the Cross of St.
  George&mdash;the emblem adopted by Oliver Cromwell&mdash;was in the main
  victorious, and though they instantly rejected the terms which England
  offered them in 1653, terms which, under the excuse of a union of the two
  Protestant Republics, meant practically the loss of the national independence
  of the Dutch, they did so with dread and misgiving as to the future. Oliver
  Cromwell long cherished the scheme of associating the Dutch Republic with the
  Commonwealth which he had created in England, and so forming a great
  Protestant league to, as Harrington wrote, "relieve oppressed peoples and
  spread liberty and true religion in other lands." But the Dutch refused to
  consider this plan, which was too idealistic for their practical minds and
  too full of menace for their dearly-bought independence; an alliance of this
  nature between the two countries was likely enough, as the Dutch patriots
  could well see, to end in the smaller nation being utterly submerged by the
  larger. Oliver Cromwell did not insist on this point. He had lately come to
  almost unlimited power in England, and was disposed to deal less harshly with
  the Dutch than had been the Long Parliament he had just abruptly dissolved.
  After the usual long, tedious and complicated negotiations, peace was
  concluded between England and the Dutch Republic at Westminster on March
  25th/April 4th, 1654, and known as the Treaty of Westminster. This was sent
  to the Hague for ratification by the States General on April 11th/21st, and
  returned two days later.</p>

  <p>The Peace, however, had not been purchased so easily and cheaply as the
  members of the States Assembly believed. The Treaty of Westminster was
  worthless. It was almost immediately followed by another secret pact which
  had already, by the ceaseless energy and subtle intrigues of John de Witt,
  been promised by the States of Holland. Oliver Cromwell feared and disliked
  the House of Nassau almost as much as he feared and disliked the House of
  Stewart. He first saw that, closely-knit as these families were, one could
  scarcely rise to power without bringing the other with it, and he made as a
  strict condition of the peace this proviso, that the little Prince of Orange
  and all his line should be excluded for ever as Stadtholders or Admirals or
  Generals of the Provinces. It would have been impossible to get such a
  measure passed openly, and only by the use of the greatest arts, skill and
  secrecy, was John de Witt able to get it put through privately; the means to
  which he resorted have been called in question; his exact share of
  responsibility in the matter has never been ascertained. There is no doubt
  that he was active in the business, and that he resorted to all manner of
  political intrigue to get the measure passed in the face of the hostility of
  several of the deputies of the States, especially those from Haarlem and
  Leyden. Whether or not he was justified in what he did, his action seems at
  least to have departed from the austere candour so obstinately displayed by
  his father, Jacob de Witt; how far his motives were purely patriotic, how far
  he considered it absolutely necessary to placate Cromwell, and how far he was
  actuated by a dislike of the House of Nassau and a dread of the power the
  holder of the offices which were to be now abolished must acquire, will
  probably never be known. There seemed to be from the first a certain spite
  colouring the actions of the Loevensteyn party against the Orangists; with a
  curious hard and blind obstinacy they resisted all attempts to conciliate
  this party or please their numerous supporters; be this as it may, John de
  Witt got the secret measure through, but it was not a secret for very long.
  Exaggerated rumours of the price of agreement between Oliver Cromwell and the
  States General began to be discussed in streets, salons, coaches and barges,
  and the members who had sworn to the Treaty were relieved of their oath of
  secrecy; John de Witt faced the storm which immediately arose. It was a storm
  of such violence that a disruption of the Union of Utrecht was threatened,
  and civil war seemed to be about to break the short peace.</p>

  <p>The clergy and the press were virulently on the side of the House of
  Orange. News-letters, gazettes, pamphlets and the pulpit were all vehicles
  for a general indignation against the Loevensteyn party who, to please a
  foreign enemy, had relinquished the rights of the infant Prince; the three
  guardians&mdash;the Princess Royal, the Princess Dowager, and the Elector of
  Brandenburg&mdash;acted in concert in sending a joint protest to the State of
  Holland, and to the States General. The States of several other provinces
  made an effort to get the Act repealed. All this was useless. Holland had to
  stand by the Act of Exclusion or risk another war with England. Not only
  this, but the sympathies and convictions of John de Witt and his supporters
  were absolutely in favour of the measure that Cromwell's policy dictated to
  them; disregarding alike the popular fury, the indignation of press and
  clergy, and the protest of the three guardians of the little Prince, the
  States of Holland made a courteous reply, referring to the grim necessities
  of the moment and hoping that on a future occasion they would have an
  opportunity of showing their regard to the little Prince and the House he
  represented. William Frederic of Nassau-Dietz, the Frisian Stadtholder, now
  made another attempt to place himself at the head of a consolidated Orangist
  party. He agreed to act as proxy for the little Prince in the State of
  Overyssel which had elected him Stadtholder, but this was disputed, and he
  was finally obliged to drop his regency and postpone the matter till the
  Prince came of age.</p>

  <p>The Princess Royal took her son about as much as possible. He was often
  seen at the handsome windows of the Binnenhof or the old Court, travelling in
  a sombre state coach, or proceeding along the canal in a painted barge, and
  his appearance never failed to provoke a popular demonstration in his favour,
  as Huygens the elder noted in exultation, "<i>incredibile gaudio omnis
  populi</i>." All over the country he was publicly prayed for in the churches.
  Excited by all this strong sentiment, so openly expressed in their favour,
  the Orange party struck the first medal on which a bust of the little Prince
  appeared, wearing his tiny cap and plumed hat, surrounded by a wreath of
  orange-blossom, with the title "William Henry, by God's Grace Prince of
  Orange," a wording which indicated that he was a Sovereign Prince answerable
  to no overlord. On the reverse was the significant device of a phoenix rising
  from its ashes.</p>

  <p>John de Witt and his party opposed a severe front to all this dangerous
  agitation. Clergymen were severely rebuked who inflamed the passions of their
  congregations by references to the glories and services of the House of
  Nassau; riots were firmly put down, and though the deputies of the State of
  Holland and John de Witt himself frequently waited on both the Princesses
  with polite protestations of devotion to their interests, they made it clear
  to all but the infatuate that they were implacably resolved to maintain the
  Act of Exclusion. Neither of the Princesses was either deceived or satisfied;
  Mary maintained her cold, bitter demeanour, and Amalia, though discontented,
  "dissembled pretty well," as one of Cromwell's men wrote. However she
  dissembled, and however skilfully she played one party off against another,
  she could not avoid scenes with John de Witt which were of so disagreeable a
  nature that she fell ill with chagrin. On one occasion, the Grand Pensionary,
  irritated by the continual disturbances at the Hague which he believed the
  Dowager Princess approved, if she did not instigate, forgot his usual
  courtesy, and declared haughtily, in a threatening voice, "My lords of
  Holland will take care that what happened last year will not occur again, and
  that the rabble shall not again behave insolently in the streets and break
  the windows of the Dordt and Amsterdam inns (residences of the deputies from
  those towns) and other houses; my lords know well by whom and for whose sake
  all this was done and planned!" His speech contained both a menace and an
  insolence that was scarcely veiled. It seemed to betray a personal
  vindictiveness on John de Witt's part, not altogether compatible with his
  high-minded patriotism. It appears that here, as well as on other occasions,
  his sincere belief in what was best for his country went hand in hand with a
  no less sincere hatred of the military-aristocratic party and their chiefs,
  the members of the House of Nassau and the Prince of Orange, even though he
  might be no more than a child of four years old.</p>

  <p>The Princess Royal was saved from the agonizing humiliation experienced by
  the Dowager Princess through her indifference to the Dutch, friend and foe
  alike. The events which had taken place since her husband's death had not
  served to reconcile her to the country where she considered herself as living
  in exile. "The greatest punishment in this world," she declared, "would be to
  spend my life in Holland." She told Mademoiselle de Montpensier that she had
  "a horrible aversion to Holland," and that as soon as the King, her brother,
  was re-established in England, she would go there to live with him. Nor had
  the Princess Royal softened the unpleasantness of her peculiar position by a
  reconciliation with the Princess Dowager; despite the efforts of Charles II
  and Queen Henrietta Maria, these ladies were perpetually on the worst of
  terms, frequently neither seeing nor speaking to each other for weeks. If
  they met it was only to dispute, both over the tangled and dangerous politics
  of the times and over the smallest trifle, such as whether or not the little
  Prince should wear mourning for a distant relative, or the question of the
  precedence between the Princess Royal and some foreign visitor, or over some
  detail of the boy's education. Heenvliet and his wife, Lady Stanhope,
  continued in charge of the child and in the Princess Royal's confidence; they
  were suspected of double dealing if not of actual treachery, of playing both
  into the hands of the State of Holland and Oliver Cromwell, the Lord
  Protector of England; seeking their own interests, that is, with the
  predominant parties in both countries, instead of behaving with loyalty to
  what Huygens proudly called "<i>La Maison</i>."</p>

  <p>The Princess Royal, however, continued to repose her trust in them,
  despite the warnings of her mother; she was always faithful to her friends.
  Her main support was the volatile Elizabeth of Bohemia, still residing at the
  Hague and under circumstances of the greatest difficulty and poverty. All her
  children were scattered; she had pawned her jewels years before in order to
  help Rupert to equip the fleet with which he had embarked on his career of
  piracy; he had now retired to Germany. Two of the other sons, Maurice and
  Phillip, had perished. Edward had become a Roman Catholic. Her daughters had
  left the Hague, Louisa had fled secretly, also to become a Roman Catholic,
  and afterwards the Abbess of Maubrisson. This light-hearted, frivolous,
  ageing queen&mdash;at once gay and bitter&mdash;involved in debt, even
  suffering from actual poverty (in 1653 she wrote to Lord Craven to say that
  she "had no money, no credit, and was almost starving") was not the wisest of
  companions for the Princess Royal, nor likely to be able to offer her any
  valuable advice as to the upbringing of her son. Nor did the little Prince's
  mother's association with this discredited Stewart Princess do much to make
  her more popular or more respected in Holland. In the year 1654, after the
  agitation following the Act of Exclusion had calmed down, and the people,
  beginning to enjoy the fruits of peace, appeared to have reconciled
  themselves, at least outwardly, to the eclipse of the Orange faction, the
  future looked about as black as it could look both for the Stewarts and for
  the Nassau, and any such prestige as these families contrived to retain was
  purely social; here their influence was considerable. Foreign ambassadors
  still waited on them, not only in formal audiences, but in private intimacy;
  and a growing importance was attached to the young Prince who might prove to
  be of a character that would be capable of uniting into one strong party all
  these scattered devotions and interweaving all these conflicting
  interests.</p>

  <p>When the Stewarts were not permitted in the Netherlands, the Princess
  Royal left the country that she so detested to join her brother Charles in
  his various places of exile; when she was no longer allowed to receive him
  even in her son's own barony of Breda, she met him at Spa and
  Aix-la-Chapelle, at Cologne and Frankfurt, at Paris and Bruges, and in the
  cities of the Spanish Netherlands, Brussels, Antwerp and Ghent. She provided
  him with what funds she could command&mdash;monies that were spent in a round
  of amusements and pleasure, that thinly disguised sorrows, humiliation and
  penury. Both brother and sister were subject to deep fits of melancholy and
  gloom, nor was their devotion one to the other entirely proof against
  discord. Charles, whose own morals were so lax, was sensitive about the good
  name of his sister and had occasion to address to her angry reproaches on the
  subject of her freedom with the Duke of York's equerry, Henry Jermyn, nephew
  to Lord Jermyn, who was supposed to be secretly married to Elizabeth of
  Bohemia. Such slanderous gossip was the more inconvenient and disgraceful as
  it came at a moment when Henrietta Maria was hoping to marry her widowed
  daughter to the young King of France, Louis XIV. This scheme, like so many
  others proposed by the desperate, adventurous Stewarts, came to nothing. Mary
  Stewart and her brother spent their wandering lives in futile gaieties,
  amusements which quickly staled, and continual and souring disappointments
  and humiliations; while the Princess Royal was enjoying a dazzling season in
  Paris, perhaps one of the happiest times of her uneasy life, she heard of the
  illness of her son. When she learnt that it was only measles she did not
  return, but remained with her beloved brother in Bruges; absences from her
  delicate boy became longer and more frequent, and her absorption in the
  Stewart fortunes grew deeper.</p>

  <p>Cardinal Mazarin watched keenly the progress of the destiny of the little
  Prince; in 1657, Jacques Auguste de Thou, son of the celebrated historian,
  was sent as French Ambassador to the Hague with long instructions that showed
  on the part of the Cardinal the most exact knowledge as to the domestic
  politics of the Netherlands, and even as to the intimacies of the little
  Prince's household; it was then the intention of the French Government to
  protect the Orangists, and, despite Oliver Cromwell and the Act of Exclusion,
  to secure to the Prince of Orange at least the Captain-Generalship when he
  should come of age.</p>

  <p>De Thou, shrewd, clever, subtle, found John de Witt "<i>un esprit prompt
  et hardi, et qui à eu des leçons de M. le Protecteur, avec lequel il est en
  bonne intelligence</i>."</p>

  <p>De Thou endeavoured to gain the Princess Dowager "for the service of
  France" and "<i>M. le Prince Guillaume</i>" (the Frisian Stadtholder), who
  was now, "<i>dans une si grand dependance de sa belle mère</i>"&mdash;a
  tribute to the dominating talents of Amalia of Solms-Braunfels.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

  <p>While the little Prince was growing up in proud seclusion with the devoted
  adherents of his House, and yet the centre of foreign intrigue, being taught
  the glories of his ancestors and his own possible hopes, while his mother was
  intriguing for and helping with all the means at her command her exiled
  brothers, and his grandmother, under the mask of submission to the ruling
  authorities, was cherishing the most ambitious designs for the future, John
  de Witt, the enemy of all these hopes and pretensions, became every year more
  dominant in the State of Holland. His office was one of extreme difficulty,
  and he needed all the force of his powerful character, and all the arts and
  accomplishments of which he was capable, to maintain himself and his party in
  the position to which they had attained. Not only had he against him the
  large mass of the people, and the press, still sullenly enthusiastic for the
  House of Nassau, but the Friesland Stadtholder, who had been created, in
  1654, a prince by the Emperor, Ferdinand III, had united under his brilliant,
  but rather undecided, leadership, all the forces of the malcontents, and
  constituted himself, as it were, proxy for his little nephew as chief of the
  House of Nassau; his cousin, John Maurice of Nassau-Siegen, had also been
  created a prince. These two men possessed considerable social and political
  interest, and Prince William Frederic was continually the centre of
  discontent against the Government, now in Overyssel, now in Guelders, now in
  Friesland, or even in Holland itself. He made great efforts to detach Count
  Brederode, his relation, who was in command of the army of the States
  General, from the party of John de Witt. His schemes, if not altogether in
  the interests of his young kinsman, at least disturbed the already difficult
  government of the Grand Pensionary. Nor were the foreign affairs of this
  statesman any more easy to handle than his internal administration. A
  changing of the policies of Europe had caused Cardinal Mazarin, the pupil and
  successor of the great Richelieu, to league with Oliver Cromwell, Protector
  of England, against Spain, so long the rival and enemy of the French, and
  then assisted by the services of one of the most brilliant of French
  generals, Louis de Bourbon, the Prince of Conde, who for seven years fought
  against France. The young Stewart Princes, the Dukes of York and Gloucester,
  served with the Spanish army under this mighty commander, who was not,
  however, able to defeat his fellow-countrymen under the leadership of Henri
  de la Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne, a French Huguenot, son of the
  famous Protestant, the Duc de Bouillon, and Elizabeth of Nassau, daughter of
  William I of Orange, who had studied warfare under his uncles, Maurice and
  Frederick Henry of Orange.</p>

  <p>When Dunkirk was assaulted simultaneously by land and sea in 1658 (the
  Battle of the Dunes), and the French gained a decisive and momentous victory,
  it seemed to the young Stewart Princes as if their pretensions were as
  defeated as their allies. The following year the Treaty of the Pyrenees
  settled, at least for the moment, the rivalries of France and Spain, and
  baffled any hopes that the English royalists may have cherished of seeing a
  Spanish army restore their king to his English throne.</p>

  <p>The Princess Royal did not forsake the cause of her brothers in this,
  which seemed their darkest, hour; not only did she visit them at the seat of
  war, regardless of the near presence of the enemy, but she was not deterred
  by the stern command of the States from receiving them in Holland. The Dukes
  of York and Gloucester were both in the Hague in 1658; they were begged to
  leave the country. In the following year Charles himself was at the Hague.
  Cromwell was dead, and on the waves of fluctuations of hope and fear, of
  disappointment and humiliation, the possibility of a Stewart restoration was
  every day becoming more apparent, especially in the minds of wide and
  far-seeing spectators like John de Witt. He had no desire to offend or
  affront a possible King of England, and Charles was permitted to remain in
  his sister's company without much molestation.</p>

  <p>At Honsholredyck the Princess openly entertained her younger brothers,
  while Charles II lodged in a tavern in the Hague near the Binnenhof. So
  completely absorbed was the Princess Royal in the fortunes of her brothers
  that it was even said of her that she went in disguise to Amsterdam to pawn
  some of her beautiful jewels to supply the necessities of her exiled
  relatives. Her unswerving loyalty and her unceasing devotion to her brothers
  were certainly at once pathetic and noble, but it was accompanied by a cold
  indifference towards the fortunes of her son by no means so admirable. De
  Thou had noted, 1659, "<i>Elle est toujours à Breda</i>." Mary again and
  again passionately assured her brother Charles that it was impossible for her
  to love her child as much as she loved him, and that she was even jealous of
  his attentions to the little Prince of whom Charles seemed to have been from
  the first genuinely fond.</p>

  <p>These assertions seem exactly to have reflected her sentiments. She was
  continually absent for long periods from the boy. When she was with him she
  exposed him to the spectacle of her violent and often petty quarrels with his
  grandmother. She made no effort whatever to consolidate the numerous parties
  who were eager for his restoration to his father's honours, to flatter or
  unite the Orangists in any league with Prince William Frederic of
  Nassau-Dietz or the Elector of Brandenburg to protect the child's interests;
  she took what she could of her son's fortune to assist her brothers, and did
  not hesitate to risk his popularity, his chances, and almost his safety, by
  involving his name with that of the Stewarts.</p>

  <p>The little Prince was then nine years old and had already been strictly
  trained in courtly etiquette and princely accomplishments. His likeness to
  the Stewarts had developed with his growth, and in no way did he resemble his
  father or his grandfather; his face was long, his complexion delicate, he had
  the large, dark, melancholy eyes and the long, heavy chestnut curls of his
  mother. He was still frail, though not sickly, and had grown more rapidly
  than his friends had at first ventured to hope. He had been strengthened as
  much as possible by outdoor exercises&mdash;fencing, tennis, and riding; his
  disposition was grave and studious, he cared little for games; his companions
  spoke to him of wars and politics, of the splendours of his House, and the
  consolation offered by the Calvinistic faith, which was in so peculiar a
  fashion a heritage of that House. When he was only four years old the Queen
  of Bohemia had seen him at supper and noted, "My little nephew was at the
  supper and sat very still all the time; those States who were there were very
  much taken with him." It was His Highness's custom to sit "very still all the
  time." No one offered him affection and he displayed none. The constant
  quarrels of his mother and grandmother in his presence prevented him from
  feeling respect for either. He was early conscious of his superiority to the
  other people who surrounded him&mdash;the Lord of Heenvliet, his wife (Lady
  Stanhope), and his daughter, Mrs. Howard, with other English and Orangist
  nobles. He early learnt to speak French, which had been the aristocratic
  language for the Dutch at the Court of Frederic Henry, and English, which was
  the language of so many of those about his person. He lived in a rich,
  reserved elegance at the Hague and at Breda; sometimes he visited his
  grandmother at Turnhout in the Spanish Netherlands. With this exception, he
  never crossed the Dutch frontiers.</p>

  <p>At Breda he was in his own barony, almost in the position of a sovereign;
  at the Hague he was in the place where his forefathers had most distinguished
  themselves by the importance of their position and the splendour of their
  surroundings. Everywhere he was, as the French Ambassador de Thou remarked,
  "the heir of the affections of the people." When he was nine years old it was
  decided to send him to Leyden, where the famous university had been founded
  by his great-grandfather, William I, in commemoration, it was said, of the
  historic siege. Frederic of Nassau, called, from the estates which he owned
  near Utrecht, Lord of Zuylestein, was appointed his governor; this gentleman
  was an illegitimate son of Frederic Henry and the daughter of a burgomaster
  of Emmerich. He had inherited some of the finest qualities of the family of
  Nassau; he was brave, intelligent, attractive, and absolutely devoted to the
  interests of the Prince; his wife was an Englishwoman&mdash;a Miss
  Killigrew&mdash;who had sufficient influence over her husband to be an object
  of interest to the French, whose ambassador, De Thou, suggested the paying of
  a regular pension to secure her sympathies in favour of France. Two tutors
  instructed the Prince under the governorship of Zuylestein&mdash;one was a
  Frenchman, Chapuzeau, the other was a Calvinist pastor, Cornelius Triglandt,
  who latinized his name into Triglandus. This man was the best type of
  clergyman of the Calvinist Dutch Church&mdash;stern, austere, sincerely
  imbued with a deeply religious sense, simple in manner, pure in life, in
  everything honest, upright and unyielding, and deeply convinced of the
  historic destiny of the little Prince of Orange. Under this man's stern but
  elevating teaching, His Highness learnt not only the splendours of his own
  House and their services to the Dutch nation, but a high sense of patriotic
  duty and a deep devotion to the people with whom his ancestors had identified
  themselves. Three young Dutch gentlemen&mdash;Baron Wootton, a son of
  Heenvliet and Lady Stanhope; a son of John Boreel, Baron Van Vreendijk, Lord
  of Duinveek, who was <i>Hofmester</i> to His Highness and of a loyal Orangist
  House, and a son of the great family of Renswoude&mdash;went with the Prince
  as pages or companions. The Dutch aristocratic families of the country were
  eager to attach their sons to the person of His Highness; he was early and
  continuously surrounded by these young patricians, among whom he took his
  friends, and to several of whom he was passionately devoted; William Henry,
  son of the Lord of Zuylestein; the three sons of the Lord of Beverwaert and
  Elizabeth Van Homes, Maurice Louis, Lord of Leck, Henry, Lord of Ouwerkerk,
  married to a Van Aerssen, William Adrian, Lord of Odyk, were among the
  members of the House of Nassau personally to support the Prince; the sisters
  of the last had married respectively Lord Arlington, Lord Balcarres and Lord
  Ossory.</p>

  <p>Before he went to Leyden the Prince took part in a small public
  ceremonial, where his dignity and self-possession amazed and impressed the
  beholders. The Embassies from the Sultan of Morocco had brought in Eastern
  fashion rich offerings for their High Mightinesses the States General. Among
  these gifts was one not suited to the gravity or habits of the sober
  deputies&mdash;a pair of pure-bred Arab horses. It was decided to present the
  animals to the Prince of Orange. The boy was brought by his governor and
  tutors to the small courtyard of Prince John Maurice's noble house in the
  Binnenhof; in front of the flat, classic brick building, adorned by
  pilasters, swags of fruit and wreaths of flowers in pale plaster, His
  Highness took his stand, quietly listened to the complimentary speeches with
  which the gift was made, and, advancing in a manly fashion, took the two
  horses by the bridles, graciously expressed his thanks to the States for the
  noble gift, and added that he hoped to make use of the fiery steeds in the
  service of Their High Mightinesses. The bearing of the slight boy, his
  princely appearance, his rich attire embellished by the blue ribbon and the
  Star of the Garter, pleased all those present; while the Orange party could
  foresee in him their future champion, the Republicans dreaded more and more
  the influence that his personality might acquire as he increased in age.</p>

  <p>De Thou, always observant, noted that the child began to show "some sparks
  of pride," <i>l'esprit de ce jeune Prince dans lequel se découvre déjâ
  quelque semence de fierté</i>. When he and his household arrived at Leyden,
  the loyal city received him with public honours; a demonstration that would
  not have been permitted in the Hague under the eyes of the States General
  took place in the old streets of the university town. The Prince did not join
  the ordinary lectures, then frequented by about two thousand students, but
  resided in simple yet almost royal state in the <i>Prinsenhof</i>. Besides
  the tutors His Highness had brought with him&mdash;Chapuzeau and
  Triglandt&mdash;professors from the university came daily to teach him their
  different branches of learning. Despite some careless remarks of Burnet,
  often repeated, that his education was neglected, it is quite apparent that
  this was by no means the case, but that the Prince was from his very earliest
  years most carefully instructed by learned and painstaking teachers; what
  this instruction actually was, and the principles of those who directed it,
  appear clearly in a paper drawn up at this time by Constantine Huygens,
  Counsellor and Treasurer of the little Prince and adviser of both the
  Princesses, and addressed to Zuylestein, governor of His Highness. Foremost
  in importance was placed Religion. The paper says that the first and
  principal care of the governor should be to give the Prince incessantly a
  lively impression of the love and fear of God. Several chapters of the Bible
  were to be read to him every day, the more obscure passages being explained
  according to his capacity. There was also to be a constant catechism on these
  subjects, not only for the purpose of thoroughly grounding the Prince in
  religious knowledge, but so that he might be able to enter into religious
  controversy and answer the arguments of Roman Catholics. The boy was to
  recite a prayer before rising, have morning and evening prayer at which his
  entire household was to be present, and to learn every day a Psalm by heart.
  On Sunday he was to go twice to church&mdash;once to the French and once to
  the Dutch church, to help him with his languages.</p>

  <p>Huygens, full of loyalty to the House of Orange and with his eye on the
  present doubtful and troubled state of politics, exhorted Zuylestein to
  remind the boy continually that in the present eclipse of the lustre and
  prosperity of his House he would do well to re-establish himself in the
  hearts of the people by being affable to great and small, "which will oblige
  the malicious to lose their rancour and animate the good to love him more and
  more." On the other hand, the Prince was to conduct himself with
  circumvention and prudence. He was not to be allowed to despise anyone and
  never to speak with disrespect of the States General to any person in their
  employ. Zuylestein, in fact, while relating to him the glories of his
  ancestors, was to impress on his mind that he was engaged in the service of
  the States General. How far and how rigidly Frederic of Nassau carried out
  these instructions can only be guessed, but it may be assumed both from his
  birth and his character and his ideals, that he took more pains to emphasize
  the splendour of the House of Nassau than the duty owed to the States General
  of the Netherlands. The Prince was to be taught Modern History and the then
  state of parties in his own country and in Europe. He was also to be taught
  Ancient History, but this consisted only of the actions of great men of those
  times. The Prince was to read the <i>Gazettes</i>, by which was meant, no
  doubt, the official newspapers of each country and a careful selection of the
  more orthodox productions of the free Press of the Netherlands. He was to
  have maps continually before his eyes, so that he should learn geography, as
  it were unconsciously, and be able to place at once, and accurately, where
  all the events he read of in the <i>Gazettes</i> were taking place.</p>

  <p>Huygens exhorted Zuylestein to see that the strictest decorum was observed
  about the person of the Prince: frivolity, vulgarity, drunkenness and
  gluttony, were alike to be kept removed from his sight and hearing; if any
  such unfortunate occurrence should take place, Zuylestein was to sharply
  reprove the offender, so that, in the lofty words of Huygens, "he may see how
  persons of honour hold such incidents in loathing. The governor will take
  occasion to point out how detestable they are." The same pains were to be
  taken to see that the Prince did not ever get hold of low, vulgar or
  frivolous books. On the social side, so important to one in his peculiar
  position, the Prince was to be trained to be as courteous as possible, but it
  is significantly remarked that great regard must be had to the dignity of his
  rank. For diversion he might sometimes go to see the principal magistrates
  and professors of the Academy in their houses or their gardens. On these
  occasions the boy was to conduct himself with dignity and civility. He should
  not be instructed, said Huygens, beforehand, which would make him awkward and
  unworthy of his station, but should be trained to express himself
  spontaneously. Huygens notes for the instruction of Zuylestein that the
  Prince was very prompt to give way to what he calls some little tempers and
  humours due either "to his natural disposition or the liberty of his first
  infancy." Zuylestein was to correct these faults with promptitude and
  discretion; he was never to lose sight of the Prince, except when he was in
  the hands of his preceptors; even at night he was to sleep in the Prince's
  chamber, it not being reasonable, said Huygens, to leave him in the sole
  charge of his valet. Even in correction and punishment the high birth and the
  proud spirit of the boy of nine were not to be ignored. Huygens urges
  Zuylestein to inflict privately and gently any correction he finds it
  necessary to make, so as not to make the Prince "blush before the world."</p>

  <p>The time given to study was to depend upon the preceptors. Zuylestein had
  to regulate the hours and see that they were kept. Indolence and drudgery
  were alike to be avoided. Above everything else (Huygens put this point
  first), the Prince was to learn to write "a good and beautiful letter," not
  only the handwriting, but to express himself with ease and graciousness
  becoming a prince, and a facility and command of language suitable to all
  occasions. He was considered too young for Latin, in which he could not be
  expected to go much further than a few proverbs or passages from the Bible,
  or moral verses. He was, in the meantime, to practise Dutch, French and
  English, which "he already knows," says Huygens, "fairly well." Great care
  was to be taken with the accent, pronunciation and spelling of all these
  three languages. He was, of course, to learn mathematics, the true science of
  princes, which one could do without neither in peace nor war. If he had a
  liking for music and singing he might be taught to praise God by some song,
  "but," said Huygens, "there is no need to go farther in this art, it is not
  essential for a prince. He should, however, be capable of judging those who
  performed before him. He may use, if he wishes, the pencil; if nothing else,
  it will help his handwriting. This is all the discipline the tender youth of
  the Prince is able to support for the moment." Huygens added that Their
  Highnesses (meaning the two Princesses and the Elector of Brandenburg, still
  the three guardians of the boy) would send further instructions as the Prince
  grew, to bring him to "that degree of knowledge and breeding that he must
  have to render him capable of the great appointment for which one hopes the
  good God has destined him."</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>The final paragraph speaks of the delicacy of the boy's constitution
  "which is not of the most robust" and must "be managed discreetly, the
  greatest care being taken in his exercise and nourishment." The governor was
  to eat with him daily, and to see that the conversation at meal-times was
  lively and pleasant. He was to go to bed between nine and ten, and rise
  between seven and eight. When he was dressed and had finished his devotions,
  he might have some light breakfast, but only if the doctor judged him to be
  in need of it. His studies should fill the morning. After dinner there was
  practise in the dance, very necessary, said Huygens, in earliest youth,
  giving a good carriage and a fine movement of the body. For the more violent
  exercises there was to be fencing, riding and tennis; for indoors, billiards
  "and other little games." In fine weather a promenade, in carriage or on
  foot, or horseback, according to the time and season. Some part of the
  afternoon should be taken up in going over the lessons of the morning.
  Huygens suspected that the little Prince would wish to continually come to
  the Hague, which he regarded as his home; this indulgence, however, was only
  to be given as a recompense for the diligence afforded to studies and
  exercise, and to be withheld if the boy committed any fault or negligence. A
  hint is given that the boy may get out of hand and refuse to obey Zuylestein.
  In this case a report is to be made to Their Highnesses who will decide how
  to deal with the case. The household was austere though on a lordly scale; it
  consisted of the chambers, the stables and the kitchen&mdash;all was to be
  ruled with decorum. Anyone who showed the slightest insolence or disorder in
  the house, "or worse still," says Huygens, "in the streets of the town,"
  should be instantly dismissed. Sobriety and modesty were to be the keynotes
  of the establishment. Huygens' zeal even goes into details of the food placed
  on the table. Zuylestein is to overlook the tradespeople, so that the
  Prince's nourishment is as it ought to be, and his health does not suffer
  from any neglect.</p>

  <p>This document, so high-minded, gracious and intelligent, concludes with an
  expression of confidence in the discretion, fidelity and wisdom of
  Zuylestein, of which a sufficient mark has been given in committing to his
  care "the conduct of a Prince so dear and precious to. Their Highnesses, and
  on whose good education depends the reestablishment of his House, and with
  time, if it pleases God, the good service of the State." This document is so
  like, in tone and scope, that drawn up earlier, "Discours sur la Nourriture,"
  etc., as to suggest the same hand; it shows, at least, that despite the
  continuous dissensions among his guardians the Prince's education was
  undertaken and continued on a careful and consistent plan, and one likely to
  shape his character, form his point of view and colour all his future
  thoughts and actions.</p>

  <p>It was at this period that the Princess Albertine, widow of the Frisian
  Stadtholder, wrote to her little son, Henry Casimir II: "<i>Vous avez le beau
  example de mon neveu. M. Morel</i> (the tutor of Henry Casimir) <i>ne le peut
  assez louer</i>," the context of the letter seems to point to the "<i>beau
  example</i>" being that of studious application to study.</p>

  <p>While His Highness was thus diligently applying himself, in the scholarly
  atmosphere of Leyden, to his dry tasks, De Thou was writing to Mazarin:
  "<i>Enfant de dix ans, le Prince doit néanmoins estre considérs l'héritier du
  nom et des affections des peuples de ce pays icy pour les Princes
  d'Orange...et il est certain que, si cette affection, et cet amour
  d'inclination, que paroist présentement dans l'esprit des peuples et des
  communes pour le jeune Prince, se conserve et se fortifie, l'on peut dire
  que, s'il a quelque la hardiesse, l'ambition et la volonté d'entreprendre à
  se faire souverain de l'Estat, qu'il y pourra réuessir...</i>"</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

  <p>While the Prince of Orange was being thus sternly and austerely educated
  in Leyden, taught the fear of God, the love of his country, the splendours of
  his ancestors, and his own possible prospects, John de Witt was faced with a
  new change of scene in Europe. He had purchased peace from Oliver Cromwell at
  the price of the exclusion of William of Orange from all the honours of his
  ancestors. He had shown himself eager not to permit any intrigue in the
  Netherlands on the part of the sons of Charles I and their supporters. He had
  suppressed alike the activities of the Orangists and the Stewarts, and now
  the moment had come when the last of these would be in a position to which
  every nation of Europe must pay court. John de Witt, in common with all the
  statesmen and politicians of Europe, had played a wary and a waiting game,
  watching England to see if she would recall the legitimate king; it now was
  apparent that this would be the case, and John de Witt, again in common with
  every other director of national politics, hastened to court favour with the
  young exile, who had come from the Spanish Netherlands to stay with his
  sister, the Princess Royal, in her late husband's castle at Breda.</p>

  <p>John de Witt had firmly established the power of the Dutch in the north of
  Europe. Two wars&mdash;one with Portugal and one with Sweden&mdash;had
  secured the maritime trade of the Republic and removed two possible rivals.
  De Ruyter had blockaded Lisbon and obliged the Portuguese to make peace on
  Dutch terms. By the Treaty of Elbing the States General renewed their former
  alliance with Sweden and secured the free navigation of the Baltic Sea. All
  John de Witt's careful skill, however, had not been able to avert further
  trouble in Scandinavia. It was not until the Dutch had gained a great naval
  victory in the Sound, and Charles Gustavus of Sweden and Frederick III of
  Denmark were forced to ratify the Treaty of Elbing, that peace between
  Denmark and Sweden was finally concluded at Copenhagen under the guarantee of
  the mediating power of the States General. The courageous and moderate policy
  of John de Witt had thus prevented Sweden from establishing in the North a
  domination which would have been fatal to Dutch trade. The maritime victories
  of this war, under the Admirals de Ruyter, De With and Obdam, had regained
  for the Dutch the credit and lustre of their martial renown which had been
  somewhat dimmed in their contest with England. Fresh from this triumph, which
  all attributed to his wisdom and courage, John de Witt was called upon to
  meet a greater peril than had ever been offered by the threat of the Northern
  Powers. Charles Stewart was about to be recalled to the throne of England,
  and Their High Mightinesses were in danger of finding in him an enemy who
  would never forgive either the Alliance they had made with Cromwell, the
  humiliation to which they had exposed his person and his followers by
  forbidding him entry into their country, or their hostility towards the
  Prince of Orange, the son of the sister who had sacrificed so much for him.
  John de Witt was faced with the possibility that Charles Stewart would, when
  King of England, at once demand the restoration of his nephew to the honours
  and offices of William II.</p>

  <p>All the Grand Pensionary's personal feelings were antagonistic to the
  Stewart and the Nassau in particular and to royalty in general. However, as
  one of his contemporaries remarked: "If the devil himself were sovereign of
  Great Britain it would be necessary to live on friendly terms with him." De
  Witt therefore at once applied his active mind and political ingenuity to
  make a friend and ally of the new power in England. On the very day on which
  the Parliament called Charles II to England, the States General had sent a
  deputation to the Nassau Castle in Breda, to thank the exiled Prince for
  having remained even for a day in their territory, and to invite him at once
  to the Hague where they were desirous of giving him a public entry.
  Everything possible was done to make the new King forget that he had been
  formally forbidden to enter the place which was now receiving him with so
  much honour. It was, perhaps, the proudest moment in the life of the Princess
  Royal, who had laboured so constantly and so devotedly in a cause which had
  for so long seemed hopeless, but was now so completely triumphant. She
  recalled her little son from Leyden, and he, with the Dukes of York and
  Gloucester, added lustre to the procession which proceeded to Prince John
  Maurice's mansion, where King Charles was lodged. The commissioners who had
  gone to meet him at Breda formed part of his escort. They were accompanied by
  five hundred English gentlemen, loyalist exiles, cavaliers on horseback, a
  troop from the Hague and a regiment of Guards forming a double line along the
  streets. Charles Stewart, now thirty years of age, soured and cynical from
  much misfortune, disappointment and humiliation, and possibly still doubtful
  as to the future, received curtly these somewhat ostentatious honours. He
  could not love the Dutch Republicans and the allies of the man whom he
  regarded as the murderer of his father&mdash;people who had exposed his
  person to humiliation and ignored his pretensions, and who had robbed, as he
  would put it, "the birthright of his loyal sister's son."</p>

  <p>John de Witt spared nothing to soften the mood of Charles Stewart;
  steadfast to his own principles of republican government, yet, as the most
  rigid of statesmen sometimes must, bent to the necessities of the moment, he
  flattered with all the arts of which he was master the newly-restored King,
  admitting that the interests of State had done violence to the natural
  inclinations of the Dutch. "...That His Majesty could judge with what
  affection and zeal they would in future cherish and maintain the union and
  close friendship between your Kingdom and this Republic; since, now that we
  see His Majesty restored, the natural inclinations and interests of the
  States are united," was the argument, more graceful than convincing, used by
  John de Witt.</p>

  <p>Charles, either softened by continuous compliments and access of honours,
  or cynically indifferent as to what he said, at length replied with amiable
  courtesy, being, he declared, determined to enter into a very close alliance
  with the States, and graciously conceding that he took "into consideration
  that the Dutch had been forced to treat with people who, having revolted
  against his father, were equally persistent against him, but now," he added,
  "you will have to do with men of honour."</p>

  <p>Whether the deputies of Their High Mightinesses were impressed by this
  royal assurance or not, they at least kept up an appearance of gratified
  friendship.</p>

  <p>One among many gifts from Their High Mightinesses showed much grace and
  delicacy; they purchased the collection of one Van Regnet, which consisted of
  pictures bought at the sale of Charles I's treasures, and presented them to
  His Majesty; many of the most precious canvases in the Royal collection once
  formed part of this "Dutch Gift."</p>

  <p>Two sumptuous banquets were offered by the States General to Charles II.
  Money was lavished on paying his expenses, on entertaining him with
  ostentatious luxury, on presents for himself, members of his family and his
  suite. Among these gifts was a superb yacht, furnished and adorned with every
  luxurious device, and a magnificent bed enriched with carvings and hung with
  lavish brocade, which the Princess Royal had intended for her confinement,
  but which had never been used in consequence of her mourning. John de Witt
  waited continually on the King and paid him the deference of exaggerated
  flatteries. Before he left the Hague, the King attended a meeting of the
  States General and stood bareheaded under a royal canopy, which had been
  prepared in the midst of this Republican assembly, to thank the States for
  their hospitality, and recommend to them the interest of his sister, the
  Princess Royal, and his nephew the Prince of Orange. John de Witt, though
  loading Charles with flatteries, which almost approached servility, and
  humiliating himself by his expression of devotion to the King, yet did not
  permit himself any promise as regards the future position of the Prince of
  Orange. The adulation of the Grand Pensionary towards the restored Monarch
  went beyond the dignity of his position and the simplicity of his manners.
  Their High Mightinesses of the States General escorted Charles to the harbour
  of Scheveningen, a small fishing village about two miles from the Hague,
  situated on the long, low dunes facing the North Sea. The Princess Royal, in
  the triumph of her restored fortunes, and her serious little boy accompanied
  him as far as the English Admiral's re-named ship, where Lord Montague had
  hoisted the Royal Standard of England in place of the Cross of Saint George
  used by Cromwell. In the evening of that day the reluctant Princess and her
  son returned to Holland, and the fleet set sail for England; contemporary
  canvases survive to commemorate the scene. The Dutch <i>Mercury</i>, on
  reporting this event, remarked, with a candour that approached cynicism, that
  the whole population seemed to have met by appointment to witness the
  departure of a king who had been seen some months before walking in the
  streets of the Hague without attracting the least attention from the
  passers-by.</p>

  <p>On this brief but energetic effort to obtain the friendship of the King of
  England, the United Provinces had spent half a million florins; they had
  received in return many fair words and promises, on which, not being too used
  to the ways of kings, they placed full reliance. John de Witt believed that,
  by a persistent policy of conciliation he could keep England friendly to the
  Dutch Republic and still evade a restoration of the Stadtholdership in favour
  of the little Prince of Orange. Such, however, was not the opinion of all the
  deputies; one of these, who had been a prisoner at Loevensteyn with the
  father of John de Witt, remarked gloomily, "That it would have been better to
  employ the money which had been spent on feasts and banquets in the purchase
  of cannon, cannon balls and munitions of war." When Charles had sailed for
  England, the Princess Royal began to make preparations for her own immediate
  departure. She had always declared that once her brother was restored she
  would join him in Whitehall. The little Prince returned to his studies in
  Leyden, where the almost royal ceremonial of his household gained an added
  lustre by the restoration of his uncle to regal honours. His guardians were
  now disturbed by another question, that of the Principality of Orange, a
  little Protestant stronghold in the south of France, a difficult possession
  for a foreign House to maintain, surrounded as it was on all sides by the
  dominions of the King of France. Frederic, Count Dohna, a nephew of the
  Princess Amalia, and son of the lady who had carried the Prince at his
  christening ceremony, had been appointed Governor of Orange in succession to
  his father; he fell into the disfavour of the Princess Royal, no doubt
  through his connection with the House of Solms-Braunfels; her quarrels with
  him brought about the intervention of the King of France, who took possession
  of the Principality, for the period of his young kinsman's minority, as he
  said, and dismantled the fortress which had been for so long a convenient
  refuge and arsenal for the Huguenots. The protests of the two Princesses and
  the Elector of Brandenburg were alike ignored by the French.</p>

  <p>The industrious and brilliant "Counsellor and Treasurer" of His Highness,
  Constantine Huygens, took up the question with passionate zeal; for months he
  conducted a voluminous correspondence on the subject of <i>l'affaire
  d'Orange</i>, protesting in vain against "two powerful Kings leagued against
  a little Prince."</p>

  <p>From the moment of the English Restoration this energetic servant of <i>la
  Maison</i> concerned himself with endeavouring to obtain at least some of the
  money owing to his master from Charles Stewart; these sums included the
  unpaid dowry of the Princess Royal, the loans advanced by Frederic Henry and
  William II, and interest. A debt of fifty-three thousand sterling was
  admitted by the King of England, but Huygens never obtained more than
  promises and useless Treasury orders that were not honoured; a large sum had
  been owing to the House of Nassau from Spain, ever since the Peace of
  Westphalia and it was equally hopeless to expect this from the imbecile
  government of Carlos II; Constantine Huygens felt himself overwhelmed with
  distress at the state of his waster's revenues, and De Thou predicted that
  the little Prince would be ruined by the time he attained his majority.</p>

  <p>The devotion of Huygens, then an old man, to the child who represented
  <i>la Maison</i> was very noble and touching; his laborious correspondence
  has some tender reference to <i>ce beau Prince</i>, his master, "now as tall
  as I," and the delight he took in the growth, intelligence and spirit of the
  boy was charming. He acted in concert with Princess Amalia, and shared her
  conception of "heroic virtue," which, as she reveals in a letter to her other
  grandchild, Henry Casimir II, she considered an attribute of princes.</p>

  <p>The misfortunes of the House of Orange were, however, balanced by the fact
  of the restoration of Charles II, which immensely improved the position and
  enhanced the dignity of the young Prince; he and other members of his House
  came in for a share of the flatteries with which Charles II had recently been
  received at the Hague. De Witt went so far as to endeavour to conciliate the
  King of England by making his nephew "the Child of Holland," as he termed it,
  and by re-opening the prospect of his ancestral offices which had been closed
  to him by the Act of Exclusion. He could not, however, bring himself
  immediately to restore, under the protection and regency of the States, these
  honours to the child, a course which policy might seem to demand. In no other
  way could he please either the Orange party or the King of England; but he
  preferred a compromise, and endeavoured to satisfy the demands of his
  opponents by promises as lavish, and no doubt as unreliable, as those with
  which Charles II had replied to him when he had offered him his extravagant
  adulation. He told the Princess Royal that he hoped to be able to induce the
  State of Holland to undertake the education of the young Prince, the
  administration of his property, and the payment to him of a considerable
  annual pension, adding, "that if the States adopted His Highness as their
  ward they would give the greatest possible proof of the interest they would
  take in him." De Witt went to Honsholredyke with these proposals which,
  however, only irritated the elated Princess. She declared that her brother's
  command was the immediate nomination of the Prince to the great offices of
  the States, and that it was a command she dare not disobey. Animated by the
  elevation of her brother, giving full rein to her haughty and autocratic
  disposition, she threatened John de Witt with the displeasure of the King of
  England and the revolt of the powerful Orange party in the Netherlands. The
  States of Zeeland and Guelders were already almost openly on her side; in
  both these provinces towns were breaking into enthusiastic clamour in the
  cause of the little Prince. The Princess Royal added harshly that she was
  about to depart for England, and that she hoped to carry to her brother an
  assurance that her son would obtain the civil and military posts which his
  forefathers had honoured since the origin of the Republic, and that the
  States in the meantime would take charge of his education.</p>

  <p>The State of Holland began to stand almost alone in grim resistance to the
  influence of the King of England, the demands of the Princess Royal, and the
  popular agitation in favour of her claims.</p>

  <p>John de Witt, though inwardly remaining firm, went very far in the matter
  of concession. He offered to revoke the Exclusion Act, which had been forced
  upon him, he said, by Cromwell, promised that the State of Holland would
  undertake the guardianship of the Prince, his education and the payment to
  him of an annual pension. The two Princesses quarrelled bitterly as to
  whether or no this proposal should be accepted, but in the end all
  difficulties were more or less adroitly smoothed over, and the reconciliation
  seemed complete. The State of Holland agreed to accept the Commissioners
  appointed by the young Prince's mother to overlook his education; among them
  was her old friend and counsellor, Louis of Nassau, Lord of Beverwaert. A sum
  of forty thousand florins was voted for the education of the Prince, and the
  power of the States Commissioners was strictly limited so as not to clash
  with or give offence to the powers already enjoyed by his three guardians.
  The arrangement was clumsy and complicated, but seemed, at least in part, to
  satisfy all parties. Now that he had some control in the upbringing of the
  child, John de Witt began to nourish the hope of the making of the young
  Prince into an honest, staunch citizen of a Republic. Despite his apparent
  outward submission, his policy of conciliation, and even of a flattery almost
  approaching servility, John de Witt had inwardly not swerved one iota from
  his iron policy of unwavering opposition to the claims of the House of
  Nassau; nor was the party which he represented, and which firmly believed in
  his leadership and highly valued his great gifts, an ineffective or feeble
  one.</p>

  <p>It must be emphasized that he did not represent a democracy. It was a
  minority of the opinion of the country, but a very powerful minority; it
  comprised many members of the old nobility and the greatest part of the civic
  oligarchy. In all the provinces, particularly in the Province of Holland, it
  had powerful supporters among the upper classes. It could count on much of
  the wealth and much of the intellect and culture of the country. However much
  this party and its leader, John de Witt, might concede, flatter and
  conciliate, their private opinion was that if the Stadtholdership was
  re-established and combined once more with the first military command of all
  the forces of the Republic in the person of a Prince united to one of the
  most powerful royal houses in Europe, it would assume the character of a
  sovereignty&mdash;of an absolute sovereignty; the Stadtholder, with an army
  at his command, would be able to establish in the Republic a military
  dictatorship such as that enjoyed by the Kings of Europe; therefore, John de
  Witt steadily, if secretly, opposed the pretensions of the House of Nassau,
  the wishes of the people, and subjected his country to a party government
  forced upon them by a minority; he was willing to concede all save what alone
  would placate his opponents.</p>

  <p>With a high heart and a joyous anticipation of the future, the Princess
  Royal sailed for England. In three months she was dead.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

  <p>Mary had been received in London with much popular acclamation, and much
  affectionate hospitality from her brother. She had arrived in London on
  September 13th/23rd, 1660, and the pleasure of her reception was immediately
  marred by the sudden death of her young brother Henry, Duke of Gloucester,
  from smallpox. In the midst of her mourning the Princess Royal's attention
  was required for despatches from the States General. John de Witt had sent a
  proposal that the young Prince should be removed from Leyden and take up his
  residence in the Binnenhof under the direct supervision of his new guardian,
  the State of Holland. It was also suggested that Zuylestein should be
  dismissed from his post, which should be given to another governor. Mary saw
  at once behind these subtle proposals the policy of John de Witt, which were
  couched in the most flattering terms. The object, of course, was to remove
  the boy from English influence, and take away from his person those people
  most attached to the House of Nassau. The Princess decided to allow her son
  to be taken from Leyden and brought to the Hague, but absolutely refused to
  send away Zuylestein, in whose loyalty she had a profound trust and who was
  educating the Prince on principles at once Royalist and English.</p>

  <p>Another domestic matter affected the young Princess even more strongly;
  this was the sudden announcement of the marriage of her brother, the Duke of
  York, with a former waiting-maid of hers, Anne Hyde, daughter of Lord
  Chancellor Hyde, who had shared the long exile of the Stewart Princes. The
  Queen Mother and the Princess Royal bitterly opposed this marriage, which had
  been secret and the validity of which there was some difficulty in
  establishing. However, the marriage, ill-advised and scandalous as it was,
  and the legitimacy of the infant, the little Duke of Cambridge, born in
  October, 1660, were proved beyond dispute. The Princess Royal, passionately
  offended in her pride, condescended to slander the young Duchess, and to
  declare that Charles Berkeley, a gentleman of her brother's household, was
  the father of this child. In the midst of the vehement agitation and
  dissension caused by this affair the Princess Royal was smitten with the
  disease that had just proved fatal to her younger brother. Towards the end of
  December she was attacked by smallpox. On her deathbed on Christmas Eve she
  confessed to having uttered the miserable falsehood with regard to the young
  Duchess of York, but said nothing as to her own supposed marriage or
  connection with Henry Jermyn, with whom her own name had so often been
  coupled in the loose gossip and vague rumours of the times. She died with
  composure, sending no personal messages either to her son, to Princess
  Amalia, or to any of her friends and adherents in the Netherlands, and
  leaving nothing but a formal official will recommending the care of her child
  to her mother and her brother Charles. In spite of the passionate and costly
  affection she had given to the King of England, he did not greatly regret her
  loss. It was possible, a few weeks later, for Lord Craven to write to the
  Queen of Bohemia that "the Princess Royal is as much forgotten here as if she
  had never been." It was not likely that she was for longer remembered in the
  Netherlands, where she had more enemies than friends, and where she appeared
  to have attached no one to her by the bonds of strong affection or
  loyalty.</p>

  <p>Amalia of Solms-Braunfels no doubt rejoiced when she heard of her
  daughter-in-law's death. The Queen of Bohemia, however, now an old woman to
  whom good fortune had come too late, may have sorrowed for Mary Stewart. She
  had followed her to England, and soon followed her to the Stewart vaults in
  Westminster Abbey, for she died the following year, at the house of her
  faithful friend, Lord Craven, in Drury Lane, to whom she was supposed to be
  privately married. She, too, died neglected, forgotten, loaded with debts,
  and unmourned even by her children.</p>

  <p>The death of the Princess Royal was a severe blow to John de Witt. He
  hoped that in this lady he had, if not a friend, at least a mediator at the
  Court of her unstable brother, and her removal had placed him in the
  difficult position of having to deal with Charles II as joint-guardian of the
  little Prince. If Charles was to inherit his sister's position he would be
  half-guardian of not only the person of His Highness, but of all his property
  and honours. It was impossible for the States to allow a foreign King to be
  invested with these political rights. Charles accepted the terms of his
  sister's will, and long and tedious negotiations ensued between him and the
  other guardians, the Elector of Brandenburg, the Princess Amalia, and the
  State of Holland. The Elector sent Prince John Maurice of Nassau-Siegen to
  Whitehall as his representative. The Dutch Ambassador acted on behalf of the
  Dowager Princess and the States. The matter was both tiresome and delicate.
  John de Witt took a high hand, and obtained the needful powers to seize by
  force the famous chest containing the private papers of the late Princess,
  which she had locked and sealed and delivered to Huygens years before;
  protests from the grandmother and the uncles were unheeded. As the political
  relations between the two countries, the States and England, became more and
  more cool, Charles showed a growing unwillingness to be troubled by his
  nephew's education or claims. The Orangists themselves took alarm at his
  possible intervention; he was a foreigner and might at any moment become an
  enemy. Neither did the State of Holland really wish to be burdened with the
  trouble of the boy's elaborate education and difficult future. They were
  inclined to return the child to his guardians and tell them to do what they
  would with the Prince, who was still being sternly and rigorously educated in
  the dark, rich rooms of his quarters in the Prinsenhof at Leyden.</p>

  <p>Neither the Elector of Brandenburg, whose wife was the heir to the
  Prince's vast properties, nor his grandmother, the Princess Amalia, lost
  sight of his interests, even in this dark hour of his fortunes, when he
  seemed no longer of much importance to anyone; for his party was scattered
  when he lost his mother, and his friends were dispirited.</p>

  <p>The Dowager Princess went to Cleves to stay with the Elector, her
  son-in-law, with whom she was reputed to have considerable influence. Between
  them they concocted a scheme to get William II's rich jewels out of the
  possible clutches of the States. Acting on their orders, Weyman, the
  Brandenburg envoy, committed a burglary; he stole and sent off the cabinet of
  treasure in a barge lying in readiness for the purpose; it was to be kept by
  the Elector till His Highness was of age.</p>

  <p>In Paris old Constantine Huygens was still dauntlessly carrying on
  negotiations for the recovery of the Principality of Orange. This took four
  years of wearisome diplomacy. At length, in the spring of 1665, Huygens had
  the pleasure of going to the disputed town and seeing the French garrison
  evacuate the fort, while in his master's name he received the ardent homage
  of the Protestant population.</p>

  <p>Princess Amalia also endeavoured to recover the possessions due to the
  House of Orange from Spain by virtue of the Treaty of Munster. In this she
  obtained the aid of the States with whom she had the tact and good sense to
  keep on good terms; she even maintained, perhaps sincerely, the appearance of
  a personal friendship with John de Witt, who seems to have had some influence
  over the fiery, arrogant lady.</p>

  <p>In the year 1662 the Prince was removed from Leyden, where he had been
  studying three years, and finally took up his residence in the Stadtholder's
  quarters at the Hague. He was still under the guardianship of Zuylestein,
  whom he loved and trusted. No one knew anything of his character or his
  feelings. He was proud, reserved, and showed in everything a cold courtesy,
  and in much an inflexible obstinacy. He was what might have been expected
  from his upbringing&mdash;religious, austere, averse to amusement and
  frivolity, strict in his manners, decorous in his habits, and cold in his
  bearing; he was passionately addicted to outdoor exercise, and particularly
  to riding; he was already a notable horseman. His health continued delicate,
  he was tormented by headaches and liable to fainting fits. Many people wished
  for, and believed they had good reason to hope for, his early death. It was
  felt that his removal would take a very apple of discord from the troubled
  scene. His grandmother, though she had been in much so devoted to his
  interests, had not secured his confidence or roused his affection; neither
  did he appear greatly to regret the mother who had so failed in her maternal
  duties. Amalia in vain paid court to the young boy, and began to discover a
  certain disdain for most women. Such was the force of character of His
  Highness that the proud and violent Dowager Princess, before whom most gave
  way, was already afraid of him, and was reduced to the expedient of placing
  some spy about his person to report to her his words and actions, looks and
  gestures. Sir George Downing, the English envoy, writing to the Earl of
  Clarendon in 1663, says: "She, the Princess, doth really begin to fear the
  Prince, he seems so apprehensive in everything and considering, and she dares
  scarce herself speak anything to him that she thinks will displease him, and
  so hopes, by this person (that is, the spy), to insinuate her impressions
  without discovering herself."</p>

  <p>Amalia of Solms-Braunfels had long been jealous of Zuylestein, the one
  person to whom the Prince's confidence was given, and endeavoured to replace
  him by a creature of her own, but in this she did not succeed; Zuylestein was
  a man of high gifts and fine character, who no doubt maintained his hold on
  the boy not only through this but through his passionate and unswerving
  devotion to the House of Nassau, by his constant fostering both of the
  Prince's manly ambition and high patriotism. The young Prince, in a sedate
  fashion, now began to take part in the social life of the Hague, envoys and
  ambassadors of foreign powers being directed to pay some court to him, in
  case he might some day become of political importance. He mingled, too, with
  the Orangist aristocracy; he was frequently at the Hague houses of Prince
  John Maurice and Prince William Frederic, the Stadtholder of Friesland.
  Through these means he became tolerably well-informed on all the questions of
  the day.</p>

  <p>The personal aspect of the youth was sufficient to inspire confidence and
  devotion. At fourteen he had grown to his full height, which was something
  below the middle stature; his figure was slight, elegant and upright; his
  hands of a noticeable beauty and delicacy. In his countenance he still
  resembled the Stewarts, particularly, as several had remarked, the Duke of
  Gloucester and his mother. His large dark eyes, now wistful, now fiery, were
  particularly admired, eyebrows wide and heavy, his well-shaped nose a high
  pronounced aquiline, and his lips full, but firmly set&mdash;another notable
  Stewart feature. His face was long, the chin slightly cleft, and he had to a
  marked extent a beauty then much sought after by fashionable young
  men&mdash;a profusion of curls which fell over his shoulders and as far as
  his waist; these were of a dark chestnut brown, almost black, and completed
  his resemblance to his mother's family. He dressed like all well-born
  gentlemen of the moment, richly, and after the French fashion, in fine linen,
  cloth and silk, gold and silver embroideries, with costly laces and ribbons.
  All his senses were acute and all his tastes fastidious. He had begun to
  spend money on pictures, statues, and fine furniture; to plan country houses
  and gardens; to design for himself the purchase of hunting parks in Guelders
  and Utrecht; but he was forced to practise economy in the management of his
  fortune. He was on friendly, but not warm, terms with his grandmother, whom
  he visited in her quiet house in the woods outside the Hague, or in the old
  Court in the Hague itself, both elegant palaces where the Dowager on her
  revenues of twelve thousand gulden a year managed to live sumptuously and to
  eat off nothing but gold plate; even her keys and water-bottles were of
  gold&mdash;in short, "all she touched." She regarded her grandson with the
  most admiring devotion. His Highness, however, had not forgiven her for her
  fluctuating policies of the past nor her outward submission to the State of
  Holland and her flatteries of John de Witt; nor was he susceptible to the
  influence or power of women, either young or old, stupid or intelligent. He
  was not sensual, and he despised alike smallness, intrigue and amusement,
  save the royal sport of hunting. His life, passed since his tenth year solely
  with men, had not been little affected by any feminine grace or charm, malice
  or interest, and amid the voluptuous luxury of Whitehall and the more modest
  seductions of the society of the Hague, the young Prince remained coldly
  indifferent to women; his warm, passionate nature, however, eagerly responded
  to the affection and devotion that were lavished on him by his young
  companions.</p>

  <p>He had a genius for friendship, a keen appreciation of loyalty, a deep
  gratitude for service and fidelity. Between himself and several of the young
  nobles who formed his companions there were already bonds of the tenderest,
  strongest affection. Without making any effort, he was able to evoke not only
  the general enthusiasm of the populace but the private devotion of
  individuals. He could speak French, English and Dutch with equal facility,
  and had a fair understanding of the other European languages; he particularly
  delighted to speak English and to employ English ways and customs. His
  connection with England and his mother's birth were alike gratifying to him.
  He himself considered, and his followers fostered this, that he was not only
  the Prince of Orange but grandson of Charles I, the descendant of Henry IV of
  France, grandchild of England and great-grandchild of France. His religion
  was orthodox; a passionate piety intertwined in a passionate patriotism,
  blended with a belief in a Divine Providence Who had appointed his own
  particular destiny. He did not concern himself with the Cartesian doctrines
  with which John de Witt was supposed to be affected, nor join in any of the
  philosophical discussions which agitated so many of the cultured salons of
  the Hague. He had some appreciation of literature, however, read with relish
  Boileau's <i>Satires</i>, and employed four musicians to play the violin to
  him when he was in a melancholy mood. He was besides, like all the princes of
  his time, keenly interested in architecture and gardening, in sculpture and
  painting. His health was stronger than had been anticipated from the extreme
  delicacy of his childhood. He was capable of severe physical exercise and of
  enduring considerable fatigue. Despite this, he was still subject to
  headaches, occasional fainting fits, and languors lasting several days. In
  the damp, foggy atmosphere of the Dutch winter he frequently developed a
  cough and showed a tendency to asthma; though many considered he would not be
  able to endure for long the strain of public life, yet his manners and
  appearance conveyed a remarkable energy, and this despite the still composure
  to which, through his pride, he had accustomed himself. Without having
  revealed either his character or his intentions, having displayed no quality
  but prudence and ambition, he was, nevertheless, regarded by all who observed
  him as possessing extraordinary qualities, mental and moral; above all, that
  indefinable quality of greatness, the cause of so much dread and admiration
  in the breast of the observer.</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>Two letters, written when His Highness was fourteen, have survived; they
  indicate the severity of his training and how profoundly he had been
  influenced by the moral axioms that had from his infancy been impressed on
  him; these letters were written (holograph) to one John Theodore, Lord of
  Freisham, who had been one of his pages and who was then, 1665, an ensign in
  the company of Captain Lanoy; in the first letter His Highness coldly warns
  his former companion against vice, drink and "<i>les femmes</i>," to which it
  seems Freisham had been addicted "<i>en mon service</i>." If he keeps good
  company and follows "<i>mes conseils</i>" he may be assured of his former
  master's friendship. A second letter, dated September of the same year, is
  full of further severe advice: "<i>Apstinez-vous, autant que vous pouvez, du
  boisson et principalement des femmes et de tout autre débauche</i>."</p>

  <p>The austere counsels of Cornelius Triglandt in his book, dedicated to His
  Highness, <i>Mirror of a Christian Prince</i>, the stern injunctions of his
  tutors, the daily prayers, the Bible reading, the two church services on
  Sunday, had had their effect; the boy was lofty-minded, stately, pious and
  reserved, with as deep a disdain for vulgar follies and common weaknesses as
  any pedant who had instructed him in their difficult codes and grand, harsh
  ideals.</p>

  <p>Among his few feminine companions was, for a brief period, "Liselotte,"
  Louise Charlotte, daughter of Charles Louis, Elector Palatine, and
  granddaughter of the Queen of Bohemia, a lively and amusing and intelligent
  child, who had come to the Hague on a visit to her Aunt Sophia, and whose
  companionship with the proud and lonely boy seemed to indicate a possible
  future marriage; this little girl afterwards became "Madame," second wife of
  the Duke of Orleans, then married to a sister of Charles II. A Hapsburg
  Princess was also suggested as a bride for William. It soon became apparent
  that the Prince of Orange could not hope much from the guardianship of his
  uncle, the King of England, and that since the death of his mother he was to
  be more and more in the hands of the States General, who were now, through a
  commercial rivalry, drifting into another war with England, despite all the
  conciliatory efforts of John de Witt. As Lord Clarendon wrote in his
  "History," Charles was without any great inclination to Holland, "where he
  had been as barbarously used as it was possible for any gentleman to be." To
  the naval war with England in 1665 was added a land war with Bernard
  Christopher von Galen, the Bishop of Munster. Both these contests were the
  signal for the pretensions of the Orange party to break out again&mdash;the
  Church and the army together clamoured for the Prince. Local riots were of
  frequent occurrence, and clergymen were being perpetually censured for their
  daring references to the Prince of Orange made openly from the pulpit. De
  Witt held to his own policy of compromise&mdash;he perpetually offered and
  perpetually withdrew concessions. At the conclusion of the war with the
  Bishop of Münster in 1666 the Prince was declared "Child of State," "<i>Der
  Kind Van Staat</i>," that is to say, a ward of the States of Holland. To this
  suggestion the Princess Dowager had acceded. The boy was sixteen years of
  age, and every one began to consider that he must be reckoned with as a
  personality, though so far he had disclosed himself to none. His bearing and
  his appearance were greatly in his favour, as was the proud reserve with
  which he held himself aloof from all the strife and turmoil, domestic and
  political, which had always encompassed his little court.</p>

  <p>Bernard Monconys, a Frenchman travelling in Holland at this time, has left
  the following description of the young Prince's appearance. He described him
  as "very handsome, his face long but well formed, his eyes gentle, his nose
  aquiline, and his spirit lively; he talks well and boldly." Numerous
  portraits of the Prince painted at this period confirmed the truth of this
  description. The new graceful fashion of masculine attire set off his young
  charm; despite the simplicity of his life, he was always lavishly and
  handsomely dressed, and on every formal occasion wore the blue ribbon of the
  Garter. He could never show himself without evoking outbursts of love and
  sympathy, which were intensified by the common knowledge of his misfortunes,
  his loneliness, the loss of his father and mother, his uncertain health, the
  partial ruin of his estates, and the secret hostility and watchful suspicion
  that shadowed his sombre existence.</p>

  <p>Huygens the elder, with his usual pride and loyalty, wrote to De Lionne
  (November, 1666):</p>

  <p>"<i>Mon Maistre n'est plus enfant, grace à Dieu. Je suy assez estonnement,
  comme en si peu d'années il est profité en corps et en esprit. Comme il est
  très beau Prince, il promet asseusement quelque chose de fort grand et de
  très digne de sa naissance.</i>"</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

  <p>The politics and personalities of Europe presented themselves to the
  ardent and observant gaze of the young Prince through an elegant medium of
  harmony and order. Neither the war with the rapacious and energetic Bishop of
  Münster, the maritime struggles with England, nor the complicated statecraft
  of the State of Holland, as put into practice by John de Witt, disturbed the
  cultured and patrician life at the Hague in which the young Prince mingled.
  He was surrounded by aristocratic youths of the great Orangist families,
  Renswoude, Boreel, Heenvliet, Van Aerssen, Salm, Dohna. Among his most
  constant companions were William Bentinck, his page (son of a noble family of
  Guelders), and William Frederic of Nassau-Zuylestein, son of the Prince's
  governor Zuylestein. These well-bred, high-spirited, gallant and cultured
  young men gave William an ardent and an affectionate homage which he repaid
  with a passionate gratitude. Estranged early both from his mother and his
  grandmother by the constant spectacles of their quarrels, often so petty and
  humiliating, despising women servants and pedants, the young Prince turned to
  these masculine companions with warm confidence and grateful friendship. His
  own nature was passionate, audacious, impulsive, and to the last degree fiery
  and enthusiastic, though his severe training and high mental gifts had
  imposed upon him a strict discipline, and he had his emotions, his desires,
  his hopes and aspirations, completely under control. Neither to the young
  aristocrats who were his constant companions, to his guardians, to the
  States, nor to the people who clamoured for him in the streets did he
  disclose himself, and he mingled in none of the intrigues which were
  perpetually troubling the States in his name. Neither the simplicity of his
  manner nor the reserve of his bearing could, however, deceive the acute
  observer as to the greatness of his qualities. Every one who came in contact
  with him had a high opinion of his potential capacities.</p>

  <p>The King of France ordered court to be paid to him; the gorgeous monarch
  felt an interest, not unmingled with a generous compassion, for his young
  relation so unfortunately placed in a country of proud, repulsive
  republicans; in the eyes of Louis XIV William belonged to that narrow class
  of royal princes who ruled Europe. He wished him well and considered that one
  day he might be able to offer him magnificent employment in his own army.
  Charles II also saw in his nephew an unfortunate pretender to the honours of
  the family of Orange-Nassau, and, as far as his indolent, selfish nature
  would permit, intended to be of what service he could to the boy whose
  guardian he was. But neither of these kings was able to do very much for the
  young Prince of Orange, and as the energies of John de Witt perpetually
  postponed his pretensions, Louis XIV began to lose interest in him, and
  Charles II considered that the matter of his nephew's elevation was too
  difficult a one for him to undertake. What the boy himself thought as to his
  present situation and as to his possible future can only be guessed, but now
  and then an incident illuminated his pride and his inflexibility of purpose.
  On one occasion, when he was fifteen years old, he was driving in his state
  coach along the Voorhout, the fashionable promenade of the Hague, then gay
  with springtide, when his elaborate coach drawn by six handsomely-trapped
  horses met that of the French Ambassador, that exceedingly able and shrewd
  diplomat, the Count d'Éstrades; the two cumbrous vehicles were so placed that
  to proceed, one must give way, and in giving way admit that precedence was
  due to the other; this precedence was claimed by d'Éstrades, representative
  of the Most Christian King, but this precedence William refused to admit; he
  could not proceed, but he would not fall back, and he commanded his coachman
  to retain his place; it was impossible for d'Éstrades not to uphold his
  master's prerogative, and he, too, commanded his coachman to remain where he
  was. This incident had an intense political significance both for the Dutch
  and foreigners&mdash;the young Prince was claiming royal honours; the elegant
  boy calmly sat in his handsome coach, regardless of the gathering crowd, of
  the menaces of the Frenchman's followers and the spreading excitement in all
  the streets of the Hague. For hours the great equipages remained side by side
  under the leafy trees of the Voorhout, encompassed by crowds, the footmen
  with difficulty restraining the restless horses; preparations were being made
  for the <i>Kermesse</i> and the Voorhout was full of people.</p>

  <p>It was an obvious impossibility that the haughty Frenchman would give way,
  nor was it to the interests of the States to insult the King of France. It
  was also obvious to anyone who glanced at him as he sat there impassive, that
  the Prince of Orange would not give way either. His Highness' Governor,
  Zuylestein, alarmed at the turn of events, sent a message to John de Witt,
  that a difficult situation had arisen in the Voorhout. The Grand Pensionary,
  always tactful and fertile in compromises, appealed to the Princess Amalia,
  and begged her to appear as if by accident on foot in the Voorhout, and,
  during what would seem a casual walk, to ask her grandson to join her.
  Amalia, who had no wish to affront the French or come to open dispute with
  the States, instantly obeyed. William could not refuse to obey the summons of
  his grandmother; he stepped out haughtily on to the footway and joined his
  grandmother in her promenade, while his empty coach immediately drove away,
  and the Frenchman proceeded, astonished and outraged by what he termed the
  effrontery of the boy. The Princess Amalia, in a letter of April 28th/May
  8th, 1664, gives an account of this incident in which there is no mention of
  the intervention of the Grand Pensionary.</p>

  <p>At this time John de Witt and the Loevensteyn faction were inclined
  towards the French, and the Orange faction towards the English, influence;
  the compliments, hollow and insincere on both sides, between Charles II and
  John de Witt, which had been so lavishly tendered and accepted in 1660, had
  already been forgotten. There was nothing but a stern enmity between Holland
  and the Netherlands. De Witt feared more the maritime power of England, which
  had inflicted several severe defeats upon his country, and her commercial
  rivalry, than the growing military domination of Louis XIV. Neither could he
  quite deliver himself of the dread of the King of England's possible power in
  the Netherlands through his guardianship of his nephew, the Prince of Orange;
  an uneasy fear was ever present in John de Witt's mind that Charles would
  endeavour to interfere in the government of the Republic by exercising the
  right left him by the Princess Royal. De Witt had long adopted a conciliatory
  attitude towards the Orange party and their pretensions, and appeared to
  regard the person of the young Prince with affectionate interest. His enemies
  believed this to be assumed, and that he was only pretending to be fond of
  his pupil for two reasons&mdash;to placate the King of England, and to get a
  hold on the young man who might one day be greater than himself. So that, as
  Sir William Temple (then the English Resident in Brussels) remarked, "If John
  de Witt cannot be the head of the States, at least he will be the
  shoulders."</p>

  <p>How far this cynical estimate was correct it is impossible to say; both
  John de Witt's high character for justice and generosity, his unswerving
  policy of safeguarding the interests and safety of the public, were alike
  served by a friendly attitude towards the young prince. It was obvious that
  the Grand Pensionary could not risk the Prince's royal kinsman's wrath by
  slighting the boy, and also obvious that, if he was one day to have any share
  in the government of the States, it would be as well to train him for that
  arduous office. William had been practically promised the Captain-Generalship
  when he became of age&mdash;an office which was now held by his kinsman Count
  Brederode, and John de Witt hoped to disconnect this post from all political
  power by severing it from that of the Stadtholdership. The Prince appeared to
  return the friendly regards of the Grand Pensionary; they met on equal terms;
  he was a frequent visitor at the Prince's apartments in the Binnenhof, and
  the Prince, at least on some occasions, was entertained at his house in the
  Kneuterdyck; De Witt took a personal interest in the Prince's studies and
  joined him in his games; they frequently played tennis together. Despite his
  extreme youth and the severity of his continued studies, William found time
  for the diversion of hunting, which was his great amusement, as indeed it was
  the great amusement of all the princes of the time, a royal taste, as
  gardening, building, and war were royal tastes; when Maximilian of Hapsburg
  had heard that his grandson, afterwards the Emperor Charles V, was fond of
  hunting, he had remarked, proudly, "If he had not been I should almost have
  considered him baseborn."</p>

  <p>In November, 1666, Huygens the elder had written from the Hague to
  Beverningh, that "<i>De Prins qui desja se trouve fort robuste et plus haut
  que moy</i>" was learning to ride after the French fashion&mdash;on a horse
  of thirty years which had carried three kings of France&mdash;a slightly
  fantastic statement.</p>

  <p>His Highness frequently went to Dieren, his father's hunting-box where he
  had died, and to Guelders, to hunt, taking with him the young men who formed
  his constant companions&mdash;Bentinck, the younger Zuylestein, Boreel,
  Renswoude and Heenvliet, now called, after his maternal grandfather, Lord
  Wootton. Despite wars on sea or land, the dark uncertainties of the future
  and the entangled problems of the present, this life was very cultured,
  elegant and pleasant. The climax of Dutch glory, the perfection of her
  blooming in art and literature, architecture and gardening, was over.
  Elaboration, luxury, sophistication, over-adornment, all the symptoms of
  decay had set in. It was the beginning of the <i>baroque</i> period&mdash;a
  period that at its commencement was full of grace, of charm, of the richness
  of sumptuous detail and intricate devices for beauty and pleasure. Dutch life
  was losing its pristine simplicity, its republican severity. French fashions
  and customs, if not French vice and frivolity, were being copied in the
  society of the Dutch patricians. The young nobles eagerly affected the
  elaborate and ornate costumes of their neighbours; starched ruffs and precise
  falling collars had given place to lace cravats, knotted and tied with
  ribbons, fastened with tassels and brooches; scarves of knitted silk, and
  gold-fringed adorned habits of satin and velvet, which were tied with silver
  cords, fastened with jewelled rosettes open over fine cambric shirts, and
  ruffles of embroidered lawn. Their ladies no longer covered their shoulders
  with stiff kerchiefs of starched linen, but wore low-cut dresses of gleaming
  satin, and circled their bare necks with pearls and arranged their blonde
  hair in long ringlets tied with braids of jewels. The men had abandoned the
  stern martial fashion of the time of Frederic Henry&mdash;the cropped hair,
  the trimmed beard, and moustache. The modern fashion was long curls falling
  over the shoulders, parted in the middle, and clean-shaven faces. Their
  ideals were grace, elegance, and a proud fineness both of appearance and
  demeanour.</p>

  <p>There was a passion for music, for singing, for ballet, for poetry, for
  Venetian mirrors; glass from Murano, lacquer cabinets from China and Japan,
  carpets from Persia, paintings from Flanders and Italy, were keenly sought
  after by the nobility. Black pages, monkeys, and macaws began to be
  introduced as luxurious details of aristocratic life. Beautiful and costly
  horses drew the handsome painted coaches of the nobility up and down the
  Voorhout or on the long road to Scheveningen to catch the sea air, which
  perpetually blew up from the North Sea and across the dunes to the Hague
  itself. The ambassadors at the Hague lived with the greatest splendour and
  magnificence, each trying to outvie the other in costly ostentation; even
  when the war with England was raging and Amsterdam was in such a state of
  distress that some people described that mighty city as half-ruined, every
  exotic luxury was obtainable at the Hague; the fastidious comfort of the
  nobility was not greatly affected, the great mansions at the Hague which the
  young Prince visited were not disturbed in their harmonious luxury; the arts
  were the delight of the aristocracy; every house had lutes, virginals and
  other instruments, which were constantly performed on; most ladies and
  gentlemen were amateur musicians; the letters of Constantine Huygens the
  elder are full of expressions of his passion for music; Dutch, English and
  French songs were alike popular, and there was continually dancing in the
  evenings, when the grace and charm of the <i>gavotte</i>, the <i>courante</i>
  and the <i>gaillard</i> were displayed, and on particular occasions there
  were masques and balls.</p>

  <p>The Prince's apartments in the Binnenhof, the Old Court, and the "House in
  the Wood," the mansion of Prince John Maurice, those of the great nobles,
  were extremely beautiful, the walls hung with tapestry and gilded leather, or
  panelled in rare woods, furnished with chairs cushioned with purple or
  crimson velvet, and heavy with gold braid and tassels, with antique busts of
  marble, with sideboards displaying gold and silver vessels, with glass,
  crystal and china or Delft or <i>faience</i>, with dishes of fruits grown
  under glass, newly introduced from the East, with pots of conserves and vases
  of sweetmeats. All the patricians were amateurs of painting as well as of
  music. Italian pictures were most in demand; classic landscape or figure
  pieces painted for the cabinets of kings or princes fetched high figures; the
  florid allegorical Flemish school of Rubens was also much admired; the
  Princess Amalia had employed Jordaens to adorn the ballroom in the "House in
  the Wood" with symbolic triumphs and victories of her husband and son; the
  refined, melancholy, decorative portraits of Vandyck were also keenly sought
  after, and princes and captains by Ravesteyn, Mierevelt, the Honthorsts,
  Hanneman, and other native artists, gave dignity to dark galleries and were
  set notably above wide fireplaces. Other Dutch schools were not so
  appreciated, but those superb canvases, where the material joys of life, the
  small, costly luxuries of every day, were given immortality, hung on many
  walls; the possessors of Utrecht velvets, of gleaming satins, of exquisite
  watches, ropes of pearls, watered ribbons, inlaid viols, platters of gold or
  silver and goblets of greenish glass, liked to see these represented by the
  almost miraculous skill of a Van Aelst, Abraham Mignon, or Cornelis Brisé,
  and set off by the downy plumage of dead birds, the bloom of plums and grapes
  in a porcelain dish, anemones, irises, carnations, poppies and hollyhocks,
  placed with careless grace in engraved beakers standing on marble tables half
  covered by a Persian carpet, with, perhaps, a helmet or a cuirass gleaming in
  the background and, fluttering over all, butterflies in bronze and
  purple.</p>

  <p>Such pictures were set in massive frames of tortoiseshell and gilded wood
  and formed a rich decoration for the walls painted a pale pea-green outlined
  with gold ribbings; sometimes their scope was enlarged and they included the
  exotic treasures of menageries&mdash;monkeys, peacocks, parrots, with
  backgrounds showing classic architecture, the basins of fountains, the
  balustrades of balconies, the trailing boughs of uncommon trees. The three
  Hondecoeters excelled in this style of work which formed a school of its own
  and bore tribute to another aristocratic passion, that for building and
  gardening. In the grounds of the Old Court were such fountains, such walks
  and parterres, such statues of nymphs and satyrs, such creeping jasmine and
  bushes of roses, such beds of hyacinths, tulips and carnations.</p>

  <p>In 1666 men could still remember the tulip mania and how fortunes had been
  made and lost over bulbs, and the Dutch horticulturists were the foremost in
  the world; statesmen, soldiers and merchants alike employed a portion of
  their leisure in cultivating peaches, watching melons and cherries ripen, and
  discussing the latest models for glass houses.</p>

  <p>The young Prince shared these tastes to the full; his training had been
  austere and life at the Hague was quiet, almost sombre compared with the life
  of London or Paris, but he mingled with such society as offered&mdash;fenced,
  played tennis, billiards and cards, performed in masques, listened to
  concerts, enjoyed pictures, statues, gardens and even clothes; yet meanwhile
  he read with devotion the serious Latin tome his chaplain wrote for him:</p>

  <p><i>Idea sine imago Prineipis Christiani &amp; Davidus Psalmo Centesimo
  expressa, et adumbrata. A Cornelio Triglandio...'s Gravenhage, 1666.</i></p>

  <p>His portraits show him in short coats of velvet and satin in the French
  style, with ruffles of ribbons at waist and knee, with wide collars or
  knotted cravats of Flemish laces, with square-toed shoes tied with wide silk
  laces, with the Garter beneath his knee, the George round his neck, and an
  embroidered and fringed baldric; he went to the houses of those who were not
  among his friends, to that of Peter de Groot, friend of John de Witt, to that
  of the Vicomte de Montbas, the brother-in-law of De Groot, where he was
  introduced to another Frenchman, Jean Herault, called Gourville, a shrewd
  adventurer not of unblemished fame, who flattered, watched and reported on
  His Highness in the interests of France.</p>

  <p>William of Orange conducted himself with well-bred reserve towards all
  these people; his haughty coldness was considered remarkable in one so young
  and occasioned a slight uneasiness in those who so keenly weighed up the
  possibilities of his character.</p>

  <p>No one believed that the boy who had so early shown pride and strength of
  mind could in reality feel the calm he assumed, and he was credited with a
  dissimulation as profound as that employed by John de Witt in his
  protestations of affection for the Prince; in other words, His Highness
  endured with precocious dignity a position he could not by any means escape
  from; his training had fostered and accentuated his natural qualities, and an
  immense pride had enabled him to control and disguise a commanding intellect,
  a passionate temper and deep emotions, an acute sensitiveness and a noble
  simplicity, so little understood that it often served him in lieu of
  craftiness.</p>

  </div>

  <p>This painfully acquired fortitude which rested largely on the tenets of
  the faith he had been educated in, a Calvinism which, with its doctrine of
  predestination, approached fatalism, was put harshly to the test in a manner
  which forced the boy to disclose his heart and his suffering.</p>

  <p>This occasion was brought about by the conclusion of the war which came to
  an end by the Treaty of Breda in 1667, by which neither side gained much
  advantage; the Dutch lost colonies, the English prestige; matters were
  reduced almost to a <i>status quo</i>. The dangerous and violent Bishop of
  Munster had also been silenced and De Witt might hope to look forward to a
  period of prosperity. He still, however, had to decide the difficult question
  of the position of the Prince of Orange, and the balance between
  England&mdash;till lately his avowed enemy&mdash;and France, who had secretly
  helped him in the late war and, he believed, might be relied upon for further
  assistance in the future. The Grand Pensionary, always looking for
  compromises, had suggested that the Marèchal de Turenne, a French Protestant
  and grandson of William the Silent, should have the command of the armies of
  the States General, and the little Prince the command of the cavalry. Louis
  XIV had, however, negatived this plan, declaring that he did not desire the
  Prince of Orange's advancement, and the scheme had fallen to the ground
  through the peace putting an end to the question of military appointments.
  Old arguments and old animosities with regard to the education of the young
  Prince were again raised between the State of Holland, represented by De
  Witt, and the Prince's other guardians, the Elector of Brandenburg and the
  Princess Amalia; a scheme yet more complicated and clumsy than any proposed
  before, was finally adopted. The Prince was formally declared a Child of
  State, a ward of the State of Holland, in the month of April 1666. Amalia of
  Solms-Braunfels made this arrangement with John de Witt, and agreed to the
  re-organization of the young Prince's household, which would include the
  dismissal of Zuylestein, against whom, as her husband's natural son, she bore
  some malice, and other members of his establishment who were regarded as
  having English Royalist sympathies.</p>

  <p>When he had at last got full power over the person and companions of the
  Prince, John de Witt removed all whom he regarded as possible tools of the
  King of England&mdash;the governor Zuylestein, Heenvliet (Lord Wootton),
  Boreel and Bromley&mdash;all personal friends of the Prince, his own choice,
  the companions of his pleasures and his studies, who enjoyed his utmost
  confidence. His Highness deeply resented being handed over to the
  guardianship of the States, and passionately protested against the changes in
  his household; he even lowered his pride sufficiently to go to the French
  Ambassador, d'Éstrades, and beg him to intercede with De Witt to leave at
  least Zuylestein about his person; so overwhelmed with sorrow was the lonely
  boy that the tears were in his eyes as, lowering his mask of pride, he
  desperately pleaded with the Frenchman. When he found all protests
  unavailing, he fell ill with grief, and was for several days confined to his
  room. De Witt remained unmoved, both by this sharp anger and this grief; his
  harshness was equalled by his obtuseness; he could not realize the wound he
  was inflicting on a passionate nature, the affront offered to a lofty pride.
  Zuylestein and William's friends and servants were all removed, the only one
  left to him was William Bentinck who, as a pure-bred Dutchman who had not
  meddled with politics, was not regarded as dangerous. The governor appointed
  by the States was a certain Baron Van Gent, a deputy for Guelderland, who had
  been ambassador to Paris and was notable for his fine presence and his
  engaging manners.</p>

  <p>As soon as His Highness heard of this appointment, the noble-minded and
  fiery boy sent a message to his new governor, asking him to refuse to accept
  the post and haughtily promising him that neither his fortunes nor those of
  his children should suffer by his refusal. Baron Van Gent, though he had
  nothing to fear from the Prince of Orange had much to lose by offending the
  State; he therefore accepted his post. When the young Prince found that his
  appeals, his promises, his menaces were alike in vain, he retired once more
  into his proud reserve and continued his stately studies and his austere
  pleasures with dry composure, opposing to the hostility and suspicion that
  surrounded him a cold dignity that he knew how to use as a mask for his high,
  commanding, impulsive and ardent nature. His enemies have accused him of
  dissimulation, at this juncture, of affecting a resignation he did not and
  could not feel. But John de Witt had also dissimulated in protesting so much
  his affection for the Prince and so much care for his interests, and then in
  acting towards him with so much antagonism and hardness. That the young man
  could find in pride of birth and strength of character sufficient force to
  disguise his feelings and accept with dignity misfortunes which he could not
  avoid, was no more to his discredit than it was to the discredit of the Grand
  Pensionary to affect to caress and flatter the Orange party openly, and
  secretly to do them every possible injury.</p>

  <p>Probably no one realized how deeply this act, at once a personal grief and
  a continual personal humiliation, had struck at the Prince's affections and
  pride; deprived of the society and advice of those he loved and trusted,
  forced to endure the company of those who neither liked him nor could regard
  him without suspicion, isolated in the midst of people, who, if not openly
  enemies, were definitely hostile to him, the desolate youth, stung to the
  quick by having to stoop to ask favours in vain, had no refuge save in a
  haughty resignation.</p>

  <p>He never forgave Van Gent for accepting Zuylestein's post and treated him
  with open dislike; here was no dissimulation; if His Highness could never
  overlook this bitter affront, he never feigned to do so.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

  <p>The young Prince refused to forgive his grandmother for the part she had
  taken in handing him over to the guardianship of the State of Holland and in
  depriving him of the company of Zuylestein. He had never loved or admired
  her, and now his feelings towards her were those of deep resentment. One of
  his first acts when under the care of his new guardians, was to point out
  with passionate reproach the state of his finances, which were, he declared,
  in hopeless confusion&mdash;his revenues not gathered in, his debts not paid,
  his accounts not kept. John de Witt blandly promised to go into the affair
  and to train His Highness to look after his own finances, with the object, he
  declared, of making him fitted one day to guide affairs of state, for the
  Grand Pensionary continued to dangle before the eyes of the Orange party the
  hope that the boy would one day be appointed to one of the important offices
  of the country. No one now believed these professions to be very sincere, and
  it is probable that William, already so shrewd a judge of character, was
  profoundly unimpressed by them. John de Witt now took on the role of teacher
  to the "Child of State." Almost every day he visited the young Prince in his
  rooms in the Binnenhof, and every Monday he devoted to going over the weekly
  studies of the Prince, who listened with outward respect and submission to
  the great statesman's homilies on politics and the elements of government.
  Whatever mutual distrust or even dislike, whatever immense gulf of character
  and position there might be between pupil and teacher, there can be no doubt
  that John de Witt's teaching deeply affected the Prince, encouraged in his
  noble and magnanimous nature the precepts of patriotism, religious fervour
  and devotion to duty which he had already acquired from Cornelius Triglandt
  and his earlier instructors; nor can there be any doubt that John de Witt,
  however much he might dread the return to power of this representative of the
  House of Orange, did his utmost to inculcate fine and lofty principles in the
  boy, and to instruct him in all the intricacies and delicacies of
  contemporary politics, both at home and abroad. He flattered himself that he
  would be able to turn the young Prince into a zealous and obedient servant of
  the States, the first subject of a Republic. He made an immense and curious
  mistake in never guessing at the intense hereditary pride which his young
  pupil had already disclosed; in not perceiving the inflexible will, the
  indomitable resolution, the supreme fortitude and the audacious daring of the
  pale, fragile boy who listened to him so patiently and attentively.</p>

  <p>At the end of the first year of the tutelage of John de Witt, while the
  English war was still dragging on, the Peace negotiations proving tedious and
  prolonged, an unpleasant and bitter incident occurred at the Hague, which
  went far to strain the artificial relations between pupil and teacher, and
  between the parties of Loevensteyn and Orange.</p>

  <p>While the young Prince was studying Latin, Italian and Spanish, military
  science and mathematics, in the dark rooms of the Binnenhof, listening to the
  lectures of John de Witt, spending a sedate leisure among the patricians of
  the Hague, or hunting with them in Guelders, or Groningen, there were not
  wanting bold young men to intrigue actively in his cause. Among these was
  Fleury de Coulan, Seigneur de Buat, a Frenchman who had served in the army of
  the Republic and been in the personal service of the House of Nassau. Buat
  was a bold, soldierly aristocrat, haughty and agreeable, amiable and popular,
  but immoderately given to dissipation, particularly to drinking. He had some
  acquaintance with the Prince of Orange who, though he could not leave the
  Hague without the permission of the States, did not lead a life so totally
  secluded that it did not permit him to meet many conditions of men. Among the
  foreign diplomats who waited upon him, the strangers who paid their rather
  furtive court to him, the guests that he received at his table, many of them
  French officers of the Hague garrison, was the Lord Buat. It does not appear,
  however, that there was any personal correspondence or intimacy, either
  between the young Prince or his grandmother, and this vinous intriguer in the
  Orange cause. It should be noted that the Orange party was now without a
  head, for Prince William Frederic had been accidentally killed while cleaning
  a pistol, and his wife Albertina was Regent for his seven-year-old son in the
  Stadtholderships of Freisland and Groningen. Prince John Maurice of
  Nassau-Siegen, then an old man, had repeatedly declared his devotion to the
  States General. Buat, therefore, acted for no reputable or recognized head of
  the Orange party, but in the interests of a large body of malcontents, a set
  of careless, gay-living, vicious people, who were in no way fitted for the
  delicate and dangerous part of conspirators. Conspirators, however, they
  were, and their design was no less than to violently overturn the Government
  in favour of a restoration of the young Prince of Orange to all the honours
  of his forefathers. Buat and his party believed that such a revolution would
  bring about an immediate peace with England and restore the country to its
  ancient prosperity. No doubt they also believed that in such an affair they
  would find their own count. Their ally in England was Henry Bennett, Lord
  Arlington, who was for many reasons strongly disposed to favour the Orange
  cause. His wife, Isabel, was a daughter of Louis of Nassau-Beverwaert, the
  friend and adviser of the late Princess Royal; her sisters were also married
  to English noblemen&mdash;Emilia to the Earl of Ossory, and Mauritia to the
  Earl of Balcarres. Besides his wish to see the House of Orange restored, the
  Earl of Arlington desired to detach John de Witt from France, and continually
  endeavoured to sow dissension between these two allies, as Holland and France
  might almost then be regarded. Besides continuous letters to John de Witt on
  this subject, Arlington used, as an intermediary, Buat, who had offered to
  John de Witt to correspond unofficially with Lord Arlington through Sylvius,
  or Gabriel Wood, a former servant of the Princess Royal. The Grand
  Pensionary, therefore, did not disdain underhand means of obtaining some
  political advantage, nor did he disdain to employ an Orange intermediary; he
  was, however, of course, quite unaware that Buat was playing a double game.
  In spite of the frequent correspondence that was going on between Arlington
  and the Grand Pensionary, there was another correspondence going on between
  Arlington and Buat.</p>

  <p>In the autumn of 1666 Buat made a fatal mistake. He handed to John de Witt
  a private letter from Arlington, together with one that was marked "For
  yourself." This, of course, John de Witt read. Buat, on discovering his
  mistake, had demanded the epistle back, but the Grand Pensionary told him
  that it had been sent to the States Committee. The result was the immediate
  arrest of Buat for holding a secret and treasonable correspondence with a
  foreign minister. The trial followed and occupied several weeks, during which
  all the French influence was brought to bear to secure sentence of death, and
  all the Orange influence to secure an acquittal. The Prince of Orange and
  Amalia of Solms-Braunfels were forced to sign a document which censured the
  conduct of Buat. It appears certain that His Highness knew nothing of this
  plot in his favour, and it was an agonizing humiliation to the lonely boy to
  be forced to censure the conduct of one who had been labouring in his
  interests, and to have to abandon to death a devoted servant. His sufferings
  were acute and again reacted on his health; the full force of his degrading
  position was brought home to him with the utmost bitterness. Buat was
  condemned to death. The sentence caused the most lively sensation in the
  Netherlands, in the Hague popular feeling rose to dangerous heights; Buat was
  looked upon as a martyr to the Orange party, while De Witt's refusal of
  clemency was regarded as vindictive. The sentence was no doubt just, but it
  was one of those many cases where mercy would have been more politic than
  severity. De Witt seems to have gained nothing from the death of the
  unfortunate Buat, which inflamed the growing hatred of the masses of the
  people against him, inspired a deeper loyalty to the young Prince, and set a
  much wider gulf between the two parties which John de Witt had always
  declared it was his main business to conciliate; it probably stopped any more
  such plots, but this was surely a negative advantage in the face of the
  violent emotions roused, the hatreds stirred, the loyalties inflamed by the
  death of Buat, whose person was popular, whose cause was beloved, and who had
  suffered the extreme penalty of death for an act that no one could regard as
  a crime.</p>

  <p>De Witt continued his education of the young Prince of Orange as if no
  such tragedy had disturbed the nation. The Treaty of Breda had been a triumph
  for him and his policy and for De Ruyter, his personal friend and one of the
  greatest admirals of his time, to please whom the Orangist Tromp had been
  dismissed the service. In the Prince's rooms in the Binnenhof master and
  pupil frequently met, with bows, with smiles and exchange of courtesies; both
  were playing long and patient games. If De Witt, in view of the Buat
  conspiracy, had ceased to hope that the Prince of Orange would ever do any
  good to his country, at least he wished to deprive him of the power of doing
  any mischief, and for this purpose more earnestly than ever tried to
  inculcate into the boy the sternest principles of republicanism and public
  duty, labouring to instill into the powerful mind of the Prince theories
  which must have been in every way unacceptable to the heir of Nassau; nor
  could His Highness have forgotten for one moment that the teacher to whom he
  was forced to listen with deference and submission was the son of the man
  whom his father had haughtily cast as an impudent burgher into the fortress
  of Loevensteyn.</p>

  <p>At this period the elegant and able English diplomat, Sir William Temple,
  who had long been King Charles's Resident in Brussels, made an incognito
  visit to the Hague, to renew his acquaintance with John de Witt. Through the
  troubles in the Spanish Netherlands he had sent away his wife and children to
  England; his sister, Lady Gifford, was with him; he had taken a strong fancy
  for a journey into Holland and had obtained permission to visit Amsterdam and
  the Hague. He has left an account of his journey at the end of September,
  1667:</p>

  <p>"We went incognito with only my sister's woman, a <i>valet de chambre</i>
  and a page out of livery, who all spoke Dutch. I leave it to her to give you
  an account of what entertainment she met with there that she was much pleased
  with, especially those of the Indian houses. For me who have seen enough of
  it in my younger travels I found nothing new but the Stadthouse at Amsterdam
  which, though a great fabric, yet answered not the expectations I had; for so
  much time and such vast expense had been employed to raise it, which put me
  in mind of what the Cavaliero Bernini said of the Louvre when he was sent for
  to take a view of it, that it was <i>una gran piccola cosa</i>." The
  intelligent Englishman adds, "The chief pleasure I had in my journey was to
  observe the strange freedom all men took in boats and inns and all other
  common things, and talking openly whatever they thought of public affairs,
  both of their own States and their neighbours. I had the advantage of finding
  them free by being incognito, and think it is the greatest piece of liberty
  that country so much values; the government being otherwise as severe and the
  taxes as hard as among any of their neighbours."</p>

  <p>John de Witt received Sir William Temple with the greatest courtesy and
  appearance of candour. A long intimacy then commenced between these two
  remarkable men who had so many fine qualities in common. The Grand Pensionary
  spoke with frankness of the last war, and attributed it to Sir George
  Downing, the late Resident, who had exasperated into a national quarrel, as
  he put it, disputes which might have been privately settled. Sir William
  Temple thought the Grand Pensionary very civil and open. De Witt talked of
  entering into a common league with England for preserving the repose of
  Christendom and securing one common safety in that of Flanders, which, he
  said, the Dutch were as much concerned to preserve as the King of Spain
  himself. After two hours' talk, William Temple had the impression that John
  de Witt was either a plain, steady man, or a very artificial one in seeming
  so.</p>

  <p>The English diplomat was not able to see the young Prince, who was then
  hunting in Groningen. The business in which Sir William Temple was then
  concerned was one of great moment to Europe in general and to Holland in
  particular, and one that was engaging the close attention of John de Witt.
  Louis XIV had laid claim to the Spanish Netherlands as part of his wife's
  dowry. The policy of this prince had begun to reveal itself as one of
  universal aggression. He was already suspected of aiming at a universal
  monarchy. A pupil of Mazarin and Richelieu, this brilliant young monarch
  appeared to be intoxicated by the splendour of the legacy left him by these
  two statesmen. He was no longer content with holding the balance of power in
  Europe and of preventing the hated House of Hapsburg from obtaining that
  supremacy which they had long appeared to have held; he wished to usurp the
  place of the Emperor in Europe. As a youth he had been put forward as a
  candidate for Imperial dignities, but these had gone instead to the last
  representative of the House of Hapsburg, Leopold I. The representative of the
  elder branch of the Hapsburgs sat on the throne of Spain in the person of
  Carlos II, the imbecile brother-in-law of Louis XIV. Taking advantage of the
  character of this prince, the condition of his country, and the general
  weakness of the huge empire of Leopold, fiercely attacked as it was by the
  Turks, Louis XIV had seized portions of Flanders, claiming them to be the
  dowry of his Queen. The Spanish Flanders were of the first importance to the
  Dutch, as they formed barrier-states between them and France; also of
  importance, though not to the same extent, to England; the result of Louis's
  aggressions were long, fluctuating and tedious negotiations. None of this at
  present affected the life led by the Prince of Orange, who remained a
  spectator of European politics, and was largely obliged to see these through
  the advice and teachings of John de Witt; nor was: it apparent how any of
  these would affect his fortunes, nor in what direction his interests would
  lie. The general feeling of Europe began to be against the person and the
  policies of Louis XIV, "a young King of twenty-nine years old at the head of
  eighty thousand men," as Temple wrote, adding, "There is not a shop-boy in
  England or Holland that does not know and say upon occasion that it was
  neither of our interests" (that is, England or Holland) "to let Flanders fall
  into the French hands, nor to let the power of France grow to that extent so
  that those Princes or State who should treat with them on equal terms are
  forced to do so afterwards with their hats in their hands."</p>

  <p>Despite the overwhelming importance of these foreign politics, De Witt
  found leisure to turn his attention to domestic affairs. While he was
  supervising the studies of the Prince, entertaining him at his house, or
  playing tennis with him, he contrived to pass through the States of Holland a
  perpetual Edict which abolished the Stadtholder's office in the province of
  Holland for ever, and in the other States excluded the Stadtholder from the
  highest command of either Army or Navy. It was said that this Edict was more
  the work of two other men, Valcknier of Amsterdam and Fagel of Haarlem; but
  at least John de Witt acquiesced in it, and it appeared to be in line with
  all his ideals and politics. This Edict left the much-disputed office of
  Captain- and Admiral-General open to the Prince, but debarred him for ever
  from that of Stadtholder. Many of the deputies thought that the measure went
  too far, arid was likely by its severity to defeat itself. Vivian, the Dort
  Pensionary, was seen cutting a State document with a penknife; when asked
  what he was doing, he cynically replied that he "was trying the effect of
  steel on parchment."</p>

  <p>John de Witt was at the head of the deputies who waited upon the young
  Prince to tell him the decision of the States General. The humiliation that
  they had to inflict was somewhat softened by their acknowledgment that he
  should be the future commander of the States Army, and that a seat in the
  Council of State was held in readiness for him when he should be of age. The
  abolition of the Stadtholdership was, however, announced in harsh terms and
  coupled with a reference to the late Prince, William II, and his arbitrary
  behaviour, which could not fail to be keenly humiliating to his son. His
  Highness, nevertheless, received the deputation with haughty composure, and
  ironically thanked Their High Mightinesses for their care of his interests.
  John de Witt congratulated himself on the submission of the young man. He
  believed that he had secured his affection and gratitude, and that out of the
  head of the House of Nassau and Orange he had created a modest, unambitious,
  republican servant of Their High Mightinesses. His Highness did not undeceive
  him in this conception. The boy's self-control was watched with interest,
  almost with awe, by Dutch and foreigner alike. Though he made no effort to
  court any manner of popularity, every day he appeared to grow of more
  importance, to be regarded with a more lively love, a more fervent hope, a
  more passionate interest by the majority of his countrymen.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

  <p>The young King of France, Louis XIV, was now the most renowned and the
  most dreaded figure in Europe. Protestantism, which was connected in the
  minds of so many with liberty, considered itself threatened by the power of
  France as formerly it had been threatened by the power of Spain, now falling
  into sullen decay. Louis XIV had already revealed a boundless ambition,
  resplendent qualities, and an unscrupulous disregard for treaties and
  alliances. In brief, he had discovered to an alarmed world the true temper
  and qualities of a tyrant. Surrounded by generals and ministers of vast
  abilities, who encouraged the secret and subtle influence of the Jesuits,
  Louis menaced the whole of Europe. Though by the Treaty of the Pyrenees he
  had renounced his wife's claim to the Spanish Netherlands, he had yet found
  means, no more flimsy perhaps than the pretext used by most kings in wars of
  aggression, to claim these lands as her dowry. These haughty demands being
  feebly and ineffectually disputed by Spain, the King of France soon seized
  the disputed territories, the Spanish Netherlands and Franche Comté, in 1667
  and 1668. Sir William Temple and John de Witt, as a countermove in the name
  of Protestantism and Liberty against this Roman Catholic aggression of an
  absolute monarch, arranged the Triple Alliance between England, Holland and
  Sweden&mdash;a movement that did for a moment at least cry "check" to Bourbon
  pride. To this Alliance the King of England had sacrificed the interests of
  his nephew, the Prince of Orange; abroad and at home the policy of John de
  Witt had triumphed. In the same year the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1668,
  between France and Spain, where Louis XIV was forced to relinquish most of
  his recent conquests, completed the work and proved the triumph of the Triple
  Alliance, by which Louis XIV had been baffled but by no means subdued or
  suppressed. The French monarch had always loathed the Dutch as republicans,
  as traders, and people who had dared to comment upon his actions and even to
  ridicule his glories. He now declared that one day he would have vengeance on
  the boastful shopkeepers who dared to stand in his way. He had contrived to
  detach England, or at least her King, Charles II, and most of her ministers,
  from the Triple Alliance almost before the ink on the Treaty was dry; by the
  secret Treaty of Dover, signed on June 12th/June 22nd of that same year,
  England was detached from the Protestant cause and engaged, if not openly in
  the cause of France, at least to preserve a strict neutrality.</p>

  <p>By the lavish bribes which his immense wealth enabled him to offer, Louis
  XIV secured this vast advantage, which was entirely unknown, not only to John
  de Witt, but to Sir William Temple, who had now been sent to the Hague as
  representative of England with the rank not of Resident but of Ambassador.
  There was one clause in the secret Treaty of Dover that affected the young
  Prince of Orange. By this the Dutch Republic was to be divided between France
  and England when the time came for Louis to fall upon it, after he had
  re-conquered the Spanish Netherlands, and the Prince of Orange was to be
  sovereign over some portion of it, which would be assigned to him by his
  royal relatives the kings of England and France, who intended, no doubt, to
  grant him only nominal power. Charles II probably considered that by the
  insertion of this clause he was wiping out all the obligations he was under
  to the family of his nephew, and repaying the valiant exertions of his
  sister, the Princess Royal, and the huge sums of money which he had received
  from Frederic Henry and William II. The young Prince was ignorant of the good
  fortune in store for him and of the efforts his uncle was making on his
  behalf. He only saw the triumph of the policy of John de Witt, the renewed
  reputation of that statesman, the estimation in which he was held, and the
  general triumph of Protestantism and Republicanism, confirmed by the Triple
  Alliance and the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle.</p>

  <p>For the moment all appeared peace and concord in Europe. John de Witt
  believed that Louis XIV would accept the warning given him by the free
  Protestant States not to venture any more on unprovoked aggression. Sir
  William Temple, a more experienced and possibly shrewder diplomat, at least
  in international affairs, was not so sanguine as to the future designs of His
  Most Christian Majesty, whom he described as "this great comet that has risen
  of late, the French King, who expects not only to be gazed at but admired by
  the whole world." The appointment of Sir William Temple as ambassador to the
  Hague had raised the question of the position of the Prince of Orange as
  nephew of the present King, and grandson of the late King of England. Temple
  warned De Witt that he was required by the express commands of his master to
  pay the young Prince all honours, and on every occasion to give him
  precedence as grandchild of England. John de Witt raised no objection. He
  considered it wise to obey the wishes of the King of England, however absurd
  or even dangerous these may have appeared to him. Sir William Temple had been
  instructed to gain the friendship of the young Prince. He contrived to do
  this and retain that of the Grand Pensionary, being in everything an able,
  honest, and skilful diplomat, who had warmly espoused the cause of the Dutch,
  of Protestantism, and of liberty, and who in the formation of the Triple
  Alliance had shown the greatest integrity and skill. Temple sincerely admired
  the Grand Pensionary, and an intimate friendship of mutual esteem soon
  developed between the two statesmen. On the other hand, Sir William Temple
  was greatly impressed by the person and abilities of the young Prince, for
  whom he had several letters given into his charge on his first arrival. In
  his letter to Lord Arlington, under date "August 28," 1668, Temple has left
  the following account of his first meeting with William:</p>

  <p>"I asked him" [that is, John de Witt] "whether the Prince was in town; he
  said he was and that he had long been with him that morning. I told him the
  King had commanded me to tell him how well he took the expressions of
  kindness he had made to the person of the Prince and that he hoped he would
  express some particular care of the private affairs which His Majesty had
  heard were running to ruin. He said they were in ill condition, but he
  thought not so bad as they were said to be; he had that very morning been
  instructing him in the business of the finances of his estates, and he caused
  him to go over all the matters that concerned this government and the
  knowledge that would be necessary to make him fit for the service of his
  country. He had also put him in mind of his own particular revenues, and he
  hoped he would fall into the care of it. I told him the King had commanded me
  to live with the Prince as his nephew and grandchild of England, and in that
  respect, by Order of Council, I was to give him precedence on all occasions,
  and at least to make up in state whatever was wanted in more material
  offices." To this rather cynical remark Temple added the assurance that he
  was not instructed to urge the Prince to stir up any private factions, but to
  throw himself on the mercy and kindness of the States. Soon after, the
  English ambassador waited personally upon the young Prince.</p>

  <p>"Yesterday morning," he wrote, "I sent my compliments to the Prince and
  desired an hour to wait upon him. He excused me that day on account of his
  being just ready to go a-hunting, and desired that it might be at five this
  afternoon, as he thought about that time he should be alone. At noon the
  master of the ceremonies, or rather, I think, some other title they have for
  it, came to me from the States with a large compliment on my arrival and an
  offer, if desired, to stay any time incognito at the Hague before my
  entry."</p>

  <p>There followed many compliments between the ambassador and the
  representative of the States. Temple was freely allowed to wait upon the
  Prince, whom he found "much improved since last winter," and who, with
  difficulty, accepted the honour the English ambassador was instructed to pay
  him. Temple had been cautioned not to let the Prince's courtesy overrule the
  orders he had received. Charles II had no very great care for his nephew's
  real interests, but was at least determined that this Prince, living in such
  a peculiar position in the midst of a republic, should receive royal honours.
  Another letter to Arlington from the Hague, February 3, 1669, gives Temple's
  further opinion of His Highness.</p>

  <p>"On Tuesday very late the Prince returned to this place so privately that
  I knew nothing of it till the next afternoon, and then sent to welcome him
  and desire a time for waiting on him which was given me the next day. I found
  no man with him but Monsieur de Witt, who immediately went out as I came in,
  saluting me very kindly, and saying he was very glad to leave the Prince in
  so good hands. I performed my ceremonies according to my orders, though with
  much deference on the Prince's side, saying still that he knew what he owed
  to an ambassador of the King's. I was with him long and alone, which, I
  believe, I owed rather to Mons. de Witt than to the governor, who had ever
  been very diligent before in all our encounters, and to say truth had good
  grace on the Pensioner's side; and I hope to live well with them both,
  employing as I have told each of them I will, to increase the Prince's
  confidence in the person of Mons. de Witt and his of the Prince. I shall
  endeavour while I am here to do the Prince all such good service and offices
  with the States of Holland as may stand with the constitution of their
  government, and to show the Prince that his greatest advantage consists in
  the united affection of this commonwealth. In this delicate place I am fallen
  upon, this is all the fineness I can find out to trust to, if I am of opinion
  it is neither the King's business nor the Prince's to embroil things here if
  they could."</p>

  <p>In brief, Sir William Temple's policy was much like that of John de Witt's
  own&mdash;compromise and moderation, and leaving all to time. Temple had the
  highest opinion of William, of whom he wrote: "I find him in earnest, a most
  extreme, hopeful Prince, to speak more plainly, something much better than I
  expected, and a young man of more parts than ordinary, and of the better
  sort; that is, not relying on that kind of wit which is neither of any use to
  oneself or anyone else, but in good plain sense, a show of application if he
  had business which deserved it, and that with extreme good and agreeable
  humour and disposition, and thus far of his way without any vice. Besides
  being sleepy always by ten o'clock at night and loving hunting as much as he
  hates swearing, and preferring cock ale before any sort of wine. His person,
  as I think you know, is very good, and there is much of the Princess in it;
  and never anybody raved so much after England, as well the language as all
  else that belonged to it."</p>

  <p>In this same year that Sir William Temple wrote this favourable account of
  the Prince to Lord Arlington, William had reached his eighteenth year, and he
  showed for the first time his desire to enter public life, and his
  determination to assert his position. He had attained the age by which he was
  entitled, in virtue of a resolution passed by the State of Zeeland in 1660,
  to take his seat in their Assembly as first noble, a dignity which was owing
  to him through the possession of the Marquisate of Ter Veere and Flushing.
  The young Prince was about to justify the prediction made by the Count
  D'Éstrades, "that if he lived to manhood he might be expected to make a great
  stir and quite possibly might be seen revived in him his ancestors, William
  the Silent, Maurice and Frederic Henry." Despite his proud submission, his
  haughty silence, and his refusal either to court popularity or mingle in any
  intrigue, he had already given one or two salient proofs of his intense pride
  of birth, and his determination to insist upon the privileges due to his
  rank. Not only had there been the dispute with the French Ambassador in the
  Voorhout, but when the army had assembled on the Flemish frontier he had
  insisted on going to the camp at Bergen-op-Zoom, when John de Witt had seen
  to it that the officers had been forbidden to receive him with military
  honours, and at the dinner to which he had been invited by the Master-General
  of Ordnance he had been placed below the deputies of the States. Stung by
  this humiliation, the boy had refused to call upon them. He now gave a more
  startling instance of his intention to assert himself, though his hopes of
  domination were foiled by the Perpetual Edict. He had now chosen for a
  confidant in the place of Zuylestein, William Van Odyck, son of his mother's
  most trusted adviser, Louis of Nassau, Lord of Beverwaert, who was in command
  of a troop of cavalry and married to a rich heiress of Zeeland. Odyck was
  skilful, subtle, and accomplished, and now arranged with the young Prince an
  expedition to Zeeland to claim the estate as premier noble of that province.
  The advice and support of Constantine Huygens was also given to his beloved
  master.</p>

  <p>A few days before his birthday His Highness took advantage of the absence
  of his tutor, Van Gent, on his estate in Guelders, to write to him (and to
  send word at the same time to the Grand Pensionary) that he was going to his
  castle in Breda; the excuse was that he wished to try some hawks and hounds
  that had been sent to him by the King of England. Although the Grand
  Pensionary watched his ward with the greatest vigilance and seldom allowed
  him to be absent from the Hague for more than a few hours, he saw no harm in
  this proposed expedition. His Highness, however, did not stop at Breda, but
  made his way from that town to Bergen-op-Zoom, where a boat was waiting to
  take him to Zeeland. Amalia of Solms-Braunfels was privy to this journey. She
  had summoned from Cleves Prince John Maurice of Nassau-Siegen, whose age and
  wisdom she hoped might give a little weight to the expedition, composed
  entirely of impetuous young nobles. The old man, however, considered the
  enterprise too audacious; he joined his bold young kinsman at Breda but went
  no farther on the way than Bergen-op-Zoom, where he remained under the excuse
  of illness. William was not disturbed by this cautious desertion; he
  proceeded coolly on his way. When he arrived at Rammekens he sent his Master
  of the Household to announce his arrival to the State, then assembled in
  Middleburg, and the yacht of the States was instantly sent to bring him. From
  this town he proceeded, and on September 13th/23rd, 1668, he made his entry
  into the harbour, where the Magistrates had come down to meet him, the
  burghers all armed in his honour, and the ships dressed with orange flags.
  The yacht saluted the town and was answered by a triple discharge of cannon.
  A coach drawn by six horses was in waiting for him, and he was conducted in
  pomp to the Abbey, where the meetings of the State of Zeeland were held in an
  old Gothic chamber of the one-time palace and monastery which had been
  inhabited by the old Counts of Zeeland, and resided in by Charles V. With
  complete composure and dignity the boy, not yet eighteen, received the
  deputies of the States who came to congratulate him. His Master of the
  Household wrote an excited letter to the Princess Dowager, in which he said,
  "The crowds are coming in on all sides, the streets are nearly impassable;
  roofs, windows, even trees and masts are black with spectators; the Abbey is
  so full of people on foot and in carriages that it is hardly possible to
  reach the Prince's apartments. The civic militia fired salutes in his honour
  during the two hours that he passed at the window, and there are to be
  fireworks all night."</p>

  <p>The day was one of continued triumph. As premier noble of the Province His
  Highness assumed the presidency of the Assembly, and made to the excited and
  enthusiastic deputies a speech&mdash;the first public speech of his
  life&mdash;which was at once a challenge and a pledge, a defiance to his
  opponents and a promise to his supporters; the precocious gifts, the careful
  training, and the remarkable capacity of His Highness showed in this oration,
  which was delivered with the utmost composure and received with enthusiastic
  approval.</p>

        id="ch-14"></a>

  <h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

  <p>The young Prince's speech was couched in terms of formal courtesy towards
  the States General, yet left no doubt as to either his qualities or his
  intentions. "We will follow," he said, "the same measures as our august
  ancestors who contributed towards laying the foundations of this glorious
  Republic, and who have at all times acted for liberty and religion." He
  thanked the deputies for the loyalty which they had maintained towards him
  since the day of his birth, and added, "By conferring on me to-day the
  dignity of Premier Noble you will not limit the proof of your affection for
  my person within the limits of your Province, for you believe this to be a
  method of arousing in all the other Provinces the sentiments which animate
  yourself. The time fixed by you for my entry into office having arrived, I
  should not have considered myself as making a fit response if I had delayed
  taking possession of it. This is the motive that has brought me to your
  Assembly." He again renewed his promise to walk in the footsteps of his
  ancestors, to whom, he declared, no sacrifice had been too great for the
  preservation of the reformed religion. This speech, which amounted to a
  manifesto, left no doubt as to his ambition and the high hopes he indulged of
  satisfying it. He could now dispose, as premier noble, of the vote of the
  nobility of Zeeland; he possessed, besides, the votes for the two towns,
  Vlissingen and Ter Veere, and thus could dispose of three votes among the
  seven belonging to the Province, and only lacked one to be master of the
  State of Zeeland; in fact, this province which had, as he said, been loyal to
  him since his cradle, was already agitating for a re-establishment of the
  Stadtholdership. Leaving William Van Odyck as his representative in the
  Assembly of Zeeland, the young Prince returned to the Hague. He had concerted
  another measure equally startling and alarming to John de Witt. He had
  induced his grandmother, the Princess Dowager, to bring his minority to an
  end. She had obtained the consent of his two other guardians, the King of
  England and the Elector of Brandenburg, and she then sent a message to the
  States, dispensing with the intervention of the State of Holland, as His
  Highness was now of age and his own master, thus ignoring the authority that
  the deputies of Holland were still supposed to possess over the young Prince,
  and which was to have been in force for another two years, till 1670, when
  the Prince would be twenty years old. As soon as Amalia of Solms-Braunfels
  had sent this notification of the Prince's majority to the States, His
  Highness followed it up by a curt note, sent by means of a valet, to his
  governor, Baron Van Gent, dismissing him from the post which the Prince had
  done all in his power to render odious. Van Gent, who held his appointment
  from the State of Holland, did not accept this dismissal. The Prince
  thereupon made his life detestable to him by his haughty dislike and cold
  hostility; they only met at meal-times, and on these occasions the Prince
  gave the governor every mark of displeasure, which indeed he showed to all
  members of the household who had been forced on him by the State of Holland,
  reserving his confidence and friendship only for the young men of his own
  selection, such as young Zuylestein, William Bentinck, Boreel, Renswoude, and
  Heenvliet&mdash;impetuous, high-spirited and loyal young nobles, who had
  accompanied him on his bold expedition to Zeeland.</p>

  <p>John de Witt was dismayed and baffled by the audacious challenge flung
  down by William of Orange. He saw that he had been outwitted by this quiet
  boy, his own pupil, in whom he believed he had inculcated modest republican
  virtues. He saw that it would be impossible any longer to keep in any
  insignificant position or in the background this lad of eighteen, who had so
  openly asserted his authority. He was alarmed also by the amazing prudence of
  design and the amazing boldness of action displayed by the young Prince, and
  by the trained composure with which he had taken his place in public affairs.
  He was inclined to consider these actions as a definite breach between the
  States and the Orange party, although the Princess Dowager did her best to
  smooth matters over with courtesies and flatteries. The Grand Pensionary,
  anxiously on his guard, resolved, as he said in a letter at this date written
  to the Burgomaster at Amsterdam, "to concert measures for the preservation of
  dearly-purchased freedom." Not only was the vigilant statesman menaced by the
  attitude suddenly assumed by the young Prince of Orange, but he was tormented
  by rivalries and jealousies in the Assembly of the State of Holland itself,
  where his power, which he had held so long and which had been so immense, was
  beginning to wane; it was considered that he had been too many years in
  office, and was wielding too absolute an authority. The long vexations which
  other States had cherished at the predominance of Holland showed signs of
  violent manifestation.</p>

  <p>The French ambassador (then the Marquis de Pomponne) wrote that there was
  some secret agitation at work against the Grand Pensionary, and some talk of
  requiring an account of his administrations, even of the twelve thousand
  florins which he received yearly for secret service.</p>

  <p>Sir William Temple, the English ambassador, took a shrewd and slightly
  cynical view of the situation. "The bottom of all this," he wrote, "is the
  same with that of all popular humours, that is, a desire that the leaders be
  made to see that those who have been long employed must make room for those
  who have been long out."</p>

  <p>Not only did the enemies of John de Witt show an increased hostility
  towards him and his administration, but several of those who had been his
  warm friends began to fall away; among them were three notable men, Jerome
  Van Beverningh, Gaspard Fagel, and Conrad Van Beuningen. Towards the first,
  Jerome Van Beverningh, an able and accomplished diplomat, who had been
  honourably employed in the negotiations which ended in the Treaties of Breda
  and Aix-la-Chapelle, the young Prince had made definite advances. His
  Highness had asked Van Beverningh to enter his service and undertake the
  management of his finances, promising him a salary of six or eight thousand
  crowns, and had done him the honour of riding out to his house near Leyden to
  personally persuade him to enter his service. Beverningh refused to undertake
  the office; he was an upright and a disinterested man, but the Prince's
  offers of friendship had not been without their effect. The charm and power
  of the young Prince, if it did not win him an adherent, at least deprived
  John de Witt of a warm friend. Gaspard Fagel, Pensionary of Haarlem and a
  prime mover of the Perpetual Edict, was also in almost open opposition to the
  Grand Pensionary, partly because he was veering round in principle to the
  popular Orange party, and partly for the petty reason that the Grand
  Pensionary had refused to admit his son-in-law among the nobles who sat in
  the Assembly of State. Beuningen had been, more than either of these, the
  personal friend of John de Witt; he was, however, endeavouring to become his
  rival; this accomplished gentleman, who had been associated with many famous
  embassies, who was magnificent, pleasure-loving, popular and agreeable, fell
  out with De Witt on account of his ambition. His friendship with the Grand
  Pensionary was marred by disputes as to vacant troops of horse for relations
  and as to nomination of friends to embassies.</p>

  <p>In spite of his upright honesty and his strong sense of the public good,
  John de Witt had not hesitated to fill all vacant posts in the army, the navy
  and the government with his own relations; his brother, Cornelius De Witt, an
  admiral not unworthy to be numbered with the heroic company of great Dutch
  sea heroes, had rendered invaluable service to his country; but on other
  occasions the Grand Pensionary had shown himself very ready to listen to the
  claims of relatives and friends who had no other calls on his protection than
  that of their kinship with him. Military posts in particular he had filled
  with men who were of no soldierly taste or ability, but chosen solely because
  they were, as the Grand Pensionary expressed it, "of the right way of
  thinking "&mdash;in other words, of his own opinion. With fresh concessions
  and courtesies, the Grand Pensionary, marking the coldness of these three
  men, endeavoured to conciliate the party of the House of Nassau, daily
  becoming more powerful. He gave the government of Sluys to La Leck, the elder
  brother of Van Odyck, the Prince's representative in Zeeland; and that of
  Bois le Duc to Kirkpatrick, an old infantry colonel, especially recommended
  by the young Prince. The next movement undertaken by the Orangists was that
  of getting the young Prince elected to the Council of State. The raising of
  this question meant also the raising of many tedious disputes. The King of
  England was all for moderation&mdash;and the easiest way. Arlington wrote to
  Temple: "His Majesty inclines much to the Prince contenting himself with a
  little, and such a little if so be it that you have specified rather than run
  the hazard of losing the whole." The Princess Dowager shared these views, and
  the plan which had been first conceived of getting the Prince elected as
  Stadtholder of Zeeland was abandoned. The question of his admission to the
  Council of State was, however, pressed. It would have been as well if John de
  Witt could have given way gracefully on this point and made the concession
  required of him. He put, however, every possible difficulty in the way of the
  accomplishment of the wishes of the Orangists.</p>

  <p>There were long disputes and arguments as to the allowance, the seat and
  the vote to be granted to the Prince. The amount of the first varied between
  a hundred thousand and twenty-five thousand florins. The important question
  of etiquette also arose. Was the Prince to sit in the armchair in which his
  ancestors had taken their place as Stadtholders of the Province, or should he
  content himself with an ordinary chair? The Orangists also demanded for the
  Prince a decisive vote, while the republicans would only permit him the right
  of discussion. A decisive vote had long since been promised to the Prince by
  the Grand Pensionary, but, when the young man now reminded him of his
  engagement, De Witt replied that matters had vastly changed since then, and
  reminded him of his audacious imprudence in having himself proclaimed premier
  noble of Zeeland in a manner of which the State of Holland had not approved.
  William made no further attempt to persuade the Grand Pensionary to keep his
  word. He waited the course of events with quiet patience, but John de Witt's
  obstinate refusal to concede anything, his obvious jealousy of putting any
  power into the hands of the Prince, widened the gulf between them, already
  deep enough. An implacable enmity seemed to be growing up between these two
  until so lately master and pupil, and always meeting and speaking on terms of
  courtesy.</p>

  <p>For nearly twenty years John de Witt had ruled the country with a minority
  government. Fifteen years ago skilled French diplomats had declared the
  people would not long endure this oligarchy or the other States the supremacy
  of Holland. The Grand Pensionary had used unlimited skill, address, energy,
  courage and industry in subduing the Orangist party and in keeping the young
  Prince out of office. Now the struggle had reached a climax. Discontents that
  had been growing, passions that had been smouldering for twenty years, broke
  out with a deep intensity and hostility that John de Witt would have been
  wise to regard. He would not give way; it was not in his nature to submit to
  menace, nor was his understanding, high and enlightened as it was, one which
  could readily admit any point of view save his own. He was now, as he had
  been twenty years ago when he had entered office, passionately republican,
  passionately opposed to the pretensions of the House of Nassau, and by no
  means forgetful of the Loevensteyn episode of which his father had been a
  victim. He dreaded the influence which was given to the Prince by his birth,
  his relationship with the Kings of England and France, the Elector of
  Brandenburg, the immense estates which he owned in the Netherlands, and his
  position as premier noble of Zeeland. The conclusion of the bickerings and
  lengthy disputes was a triumph for the Orange party. William was admitted
  into the Council of State at a salary of sixty thousand florins a year and
  with a vote. The Prince had kept aloof from the long and tedious discussions,
  but he had not been able to control all signs of impatience. "I will take my
  seat now or never," he had declared on one occasion. When he saw that the
  zeal of his partisans was endangering his cause, he had had, however, the
  self-command and the prudence to order them to desist in their efforts on his
  behalf, and moderate their demands; John de Witt should have noticed this
  dangerous skill.</p>

  <p>On Saturday, May 31st/June 10th, 1670, at eleven o'clock in the morning,
  the secretary of the States General brought the Prince, accompanied by the
  three deputies of Holland, Zeeland and Groningen, to introduce him into the
  Council of State. William placed himself before these deputies and entered
  the Chamber first, as by right of precedence, then took his seat in a velvet
  armchair opposite, belonging to the young Stadtholder of Friesland. With his
  habitual cool control, which showed no trace of excitement or triumph, the
  young Prince listened to the reading of his commission, took the oath of
  fidelity, and had the good taste to make no speech, confining himself merely
  to a few civil words of thanks to the States General.</p>

  <p>Not only had John de Witt been defeated, but he had lost the chance of a
  reconciliation and an amicable understanding with the Prince of Orange. He
  had let him see plainly that he deeply resented the impatient ambition that
  had inspired the secret voyage to Zeeland. He had in fact taken up the
  challenge and, instead of offering the hand of friendship to the young man
  who would obviously be of considerable political power, he had shown him that
  he considered him as an enemy and a danger. The stability of the republican
  government was seriously undermined. One of the staunchest supporters of John
  de Witt wrote: "I greatly regret to think that we have laid the first stone
  of an edifice which menaces both our liberty and our persons." The conduct of
  His Highness gave good cause for these anxieties on the part of the
  Republicans; when the Grand Pensionary was absent in Groningen in an attempt
  to settle the differences in that Province, the Prince claimed the right to a
  seat in the States General, declaring that such a privilege was contained in
  the wording of his commission. All the States, save Holland, were in favour
  of granting this request. John de Witt hastened back to the Hague, and
  declared that His Highness had no right to take advantage of the wording of
  the commission that he had received, which had been carelessly copied from
  that of William II, when he had succeeded to the offices of Frederic Henry,
  as Stadtholder and Captain-General. John de Witt used all his influence to
  resist what he called "this infamous attempt" to introduce the Prince of
  Orange by surprise into the Assembly of the States General on the "most
  ill-founded reasons possible." His Highness coldly gave up his pretension,
  and flaming enmity was resumed between the two parties. Now that he had
  entered on public life, it was hardly reasonable to expect the young Prince
  to remain even in nominal subjection to the Commissioner appointed by the
  State of Holland to supervise his education. His governor, Van Gent, was
  impatient to resign a post which the young Prince had contrived to render
  detestable. The deputies of Holland were only making themselves appear
  ridiculous by attempting to exert any authority over the Prince. When Van
  Gent left, the last of the tutors and household appointed by the State were
  dismissed.</p>

  <p>At twenty years of age William had his affairs entirely in his own hands,
  was answerable to no one, and had taken his part in public life and among the
  councillors of his country. His followers increased daily, the lukewarm, the
  half-hearted, and the self-seeking turned eagerly to worship the rising sun,
  and as the party of John de Witt diminished, the party of the Prince of
  Orange grew; nor did foreign kings fail to notice the growing power of the
  young man. Both Louis XIV and Charles II encouraged the internal dissension
  which threatened to split asunder the Republic. The King of France rejected
  the overtures of John de Witt, and the King of England appeared to be seeking
  an excuse for a quarrel with his ally of the Triple Alliance, but both these
  kings made advances to the Prince of Orange, hoping to detach him from his
  country and to use him as an instrument in the destruction of the Republic.
  When William secured admission to the Council of State he had intimated to
  the French ambassador that he would greatly value a message of congratulation
  from Louis XIV. The King of France instantly replied to this overture, and
  sent his warm congratulations to his young kinsman, rejoicing that he had
  "thus gained a step soon to lead to another and higher one, namely, the
  establishment of that same authority that his ancestors exercised in the
  States so justly and so worthily."</p>

  <p>The Marquis de Pomponne paid a visit to the Prince of Orange, who received
  him with pleasure and respect, and handed to the ambassador a letter of
  thanks to his master. Louis XIV replied with amiable courtesy, and the Prince
  renewed his assurances of his zeal for the service of the King of France, and
  declared his intention of maintaining that same attachment and loyalty for
  that kingdom which his ancestors had for the happiness of themselves always
  been eager to display; De Pomponne thought His Highness would be a convenient
  tool in the clever hands of French statesmen, Charles II and his ministers;
  these, by a second false Treaty of Dover which they had signed in January,
  1671, had made themselves party to the proposed conquest of the Dutch
  Republic, though they, i.e. Buckingham, Lauderdale and Ashley, were ignorant
  of the first secret treaty (signed by Clifford and Arlington) with its most
  important clause regarding the return of England to Roman Catholicism, this
  being too perilous a secret to entrust to many Englishmen; on the destruction
  of the Dutch Republic, however, the Cabal were agreed, and had even fixed the
  date of the attack for the spring of 1672.</p>

        id="ch-15"></a>

  <h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

  <p>The Kings of England and France had resolved and undertaken by the Treaty
  of Dover sooner or later to destroy and divide the Dutch Netherlands; they
  each believed that they saw means of accomplishing their purpose in the
  elevation of their young kinsman, the Prince of Orange, and it was decided to
  endeavour to seduce him to their cause by all possible flattery and
  attention. His growing popularity in the Netherlands, the influence of his
  name and birth, the prestige given to him by the deeds of his
  ancestors&mdash;these were to be the means, the wedge by which the United
  Provinces should be split in two; and he was to be rewarded for his
  compliance in the dismemberment of his country by a portion of it over which
  he was to retain the sovereignty. As a first step in the seduction of the
  young man, Charles II invited him to England. William accepted the
  invitation, probably with the sole idea of obtaining some of the vast amount
  of money lent to Charles II by his mother, father and grandfather. William's
  revenues were princely, but hardly sufficient to maintain the state which he
  had now to support. Charles II (according to Huygens' accounts) owed him over
  two million <i>livres</i>. It is also likely that he hoped to obtain the
  assistance of Charles II in his restoration to the Stadtholdership. Charles
  held out the most inviting promises. He wished, he said, to confirm the
  installation of the young Prince as a Knight of the Garter (though he had
  been sent the Garter when he was three years old, he had not yet been
  formally installed), and to settle the payment of his mother's dowry. In
  brief, Charles now showed an eager concern in the fortunes of his nephew
  which he had not displayed before.</p>

  <p>This interest could not fail to rouse the anxious suspicions of John de
  Witt. Through his ambassadors in Paris and London, and through the services
  of secret agents, he had already a strong suspicion of the treacherous
  dealings of Charles II with France; though De Witt never guessed it was now
  the intention of the King to abandon, if not to attack, the Republic in
  consideration of subsidies from Louis XIV. One of these agents warned De Witt
  that the Prince of Orange's journey "merited consideration in such dark times
  and present conjuncture." Alarmed by the force of character and bold ambition
  that William had displayed, dreading his extreme youth and the ties of
  kinship, fearing the allurements and the inducements which would be set
  before him in Whitehall to abandon his own country and join his cause with
  her enemies, John de Witt regarded this journey which he could not prevent as
  a portent of trouble if not disaster.</p>

  <p>Thomas, Earl of Ossory, son-in-law of Louis de Nassau, Lord of Beverwaert,
  the former Dutch ambassador in London, came to the Hague to fetch William,
  and took the occasion to endeavour to persuade De Witt that Charles II would
  become the protector of the Republic if it would submit to be governed by the
  Prince of Orange. John de Witt listened to this proposal with inward scorn
  and aversion. Outwardly he used the usual policy of compromise, and said all
  such discussions must be put off until the Prince had attained his
  twenty-second year. He resisted and defeated a suggestion that the Dutch
  Ambassador in London should receive instructions to communicate all the
  negotiations to the Prince during his visit to Whitehall. John de Witt was,
  however, outwardly smooth and agreeable. The Prince gave a banquet to the
  principal members of the Government, and then embarked at Brill with a
  splendid suite, which included several young nobles representing many of the
  patrician families of the Netherlands. He arrived in England on October 70,
  161670, and was immediately greeted with flattering and overwhelming
  attentions. The situation was exactly as John de Witt had surmised it would
  be. Charles, acting under the advice of, and with the encouragement of, Louis
  XIV, had decided to leave nothing undone which could secure his nephew's
  influence in the United Provinces, with the object of using this same
  influence for the undoing of the Dutch. In every way William's self-interest
  was skilfully appealed to, his pride of birth flattered; he was received with
  royal honours in Oxford and Cambridge and his birthday celebrated in state in
  London. Balls, banquets and fetes were given in constant succession, and all
  the enticements of Whitehall were unfolded to dazzle the young man of twenty,
  who had been brought up in such simple austerity, who had never before beheld
  the voluptuous licence of a court, or the careless magnificence of a great
  capital.</p>

  <p>His Highness remained nearly three months in England; his appearance and
  bearing were greatly admired. Lord Arlington wrote: "The Prince of Orange has
  been now these three weeks amongst us, much to the satisfaction of the King
  and all that have seen him. He is a young man of the most extraordinary
  understanding and parts." John Evelyn noted in his diary on November 4, 1670:
  "Saw the Prince of Orange newly come to see the King, his uncle. He has a
  manly, wise, and courageous countenance, resembling his mother and the Duke
  of Gloucester." On the 4th of the following month, Croissy de Colbert wrote:
  "The King of England is much satisfied with the parts of the Prince of
  Orange, but he finds him so passionate a Dutchman and Protestant that even
  although His Majesty had not disapproved of his trusting him with any part of
  the secret, these two reasons would have hindered him." The secret referred
  to was, of course, the Treaty of Dover, which, had Charles found William of a
  favourable disposition, he had intended to impart to him. It should be
  remembered that by a clause in this Treaty William was to be sovereign over
  such of the United Provinces as remained when they had been divided by the
  Kings of England and France. After observing the behaviour of his nephew for
  a few days, Charles decided not to let him into this perilous affair. Louis
  XIV had, indeed, written to him to beg him not to do so. It would be,
  declared the King of France, dangerous to make any revelation to a prince
  "whose extreme youth gave reason to fear his indiscretion, and whose real
  sentiments appeared so uncertain." Pomponne, the French Ambassador at the
  Hague, thus wrote afterwards of the situation: "The characters of the uncle
  and nephew were ill-suited for agreement; the King free, outspoken and easy,
  was entirely devoted to pleasure; the Prince, on the contrary, was naturally
  serious and reserved, and averse from all appearance of vice; and, profiting
  by the advice of his grandmother, the Princess Dowager of Orange, took only
  such part in the King's diversions as civility required. His sobriety and
  reserve appeared to condemn these, and he thereby greatly pleased the
  English, who praised in him the tendencies opposed to those they blamed in
  the King. But what specially moved them was his punctuality in the
  performance of all his religious obligations, and the exhibition of his great
  zeal for the Protestants; the popular favour which he thus conciliated gave
  the King of England reason to fear that his nephew would one day be a most
  dangerous enemy for his family."</p>

  <p>Uncle and nephew were indeed completely different in character and
  talents. Charles had taken it for granted that this ambitious and
  high-spirited young man, belonging to the caste of princes, would not
  hesitate to use any means against his enemies, nor to undertake any business
  that might restore to him his rights. He was startled by William's pride and
  reserve, by the austerity of his behaviour which baffled all the crude
  attempts of himself and Buckingham to lure him into "frolicsomeness," by his
  sincere Protestantism, and outspoken patriotism&mdash;all of which qualities
  were extremely unfashionable at Whitehall. The young Prince maintained amidst
  these seductions, pleasantries, flatteries, compliments and mockeries, the
  same unmoved demeanour as he had maintained among the hostile forces of his
  upbringing. He was neither softened, irritated, shamed, nor excited by any
  subterfuge or intrigue employed against him; but he did not depart from his
  usual reserve save once when sufficiently moved to flash out into this
  passionate "Protestantism and patriotism" which so impressed and alarmed
  Charles II. Among the English people, the bulk of whom were exasperated by
  the excesses and the Roman Catholic tendencies of the court, William of
  Orange was at once popular. To the English he was Mary Stewart's child, son
  of the woman who had so loyally supported her father's cause. He was received
  both at Oxford and Cambridge with great applause. From a diary of an alderman
  of Cambridge is this account of the Prince's appearance:</p>

  <p class="letter">"Saturday morning, about ten of the clock, came into
  Cambridge His Highness the Prince of Orange, then between nineteen and twenty
  years of age&mdash;a well-countenanced man with a smooth and smeager
  (<i>sic</i>) plump face, and a handsome head of hair of his own. There were
  in all three coaches, and six horses apiece; the Prince was in the middlemost
  and sat at the head end thereof on the right hand, the Lord Ossory being at
  the same end with him."</p>

  <p>At Oxford, where the Prince was received with divers gifts, he was
  presented with a pair of French fringed gloves and a dozen of white kid.
  Honorary degrees were conferred upon him, and on four of the young nobles of
  his suite&mdash;William Albert, Count Dhona; Henry de Nassau, Lord of
  Ouwerkerk; William de Nassau, Lord of Leersum, younger son of the elder
  Zuylestein; and William Bentinck. The Prince was also presented after the
  ceremony with the works of King Charles I, richly bound and gilded. The main
  purpose of William's visit, however, ended in failure. He did not obtain a
  penny, either of his mother's dowry or the money due to him on account of
  loans made by his father and grandfather to Charles II. His partisans in the
  Netherlands made the most of his reception, both in the Court and in the
  country. Conrad Van Beuningen, on his return to the Hague in December, 1670,
  informed the States General that on his arrival in London he had not found
  the Court very well disposed, that the journey of the Prince of Orange to
  England had been most favourable to the interests of the public. He added,
  too, that the English people were in general hostile to France, a power which
  the Netherlands had now come to dread most. John de Witt was completely
  deceived, he had not the least suspicion of the existence of the Treaty of
  Dover, and though he feared the growing power and insolence of Louis XIV, he
  believed what De Groot, the Ambassador at Versailles, told him, that "if the
  King of England does us no good, at least he will not do us much harm, he is
  too fond of <i>louis d'or</i> to do the former, and too much in awe of his
  people to venture on the latter."</p>

  <p>The struggle about the Prince's admission to the Council of State was
  renewed. Warned of the possible measures that Charles II might take for the
  restoration of his nephew, John de Witt resolved to meet all such attempts
  with firmness. He began by warning the Princess Dowager of the injury the
  Prince would do himself, even in the eyes of his own party, if he suffered
  the interference of the King of England, especially considering the
  resolutions of Holland did not permit of recommendations by foreign
  sovereigns to any public office. Amalia of Solms-Braunfels was persuaded and
  alarmed; she made every effort to check the zeal of the Orange party, and De
  Witt triumphed yet again in his policy of compromise and conciliation,
  concealing an inflexible resolve. It was perfectly true, and John de Witt
  could scarcely have known how true, that no concessions to the Prince of
  Orange would have had any effect on the policy of Charles II, irrevocably
  bound with the interests of Louis XIV. When the young Prince returned to the
  Hague early in March, he received a hearty welcome not only from his friends
  but from the people, and found affairs in a state of armed neutrality, his
  party and that of John de Witt opposing each other with outward calm and
  courtesy and inward antagonism and jealousy. Both were prepared to assume at
  any moment a desperate struggle. His Highness, outwardly at least, took no
  part in this; he appeared neither elated by the splendour of his reception in
  England, nor depressed by the fruitlessness of his request for a settlement
  of his pecuniary affairs.</p>

  <p>Not only was the whole situation thus complicated, delicate and dangerous,
  but abroad matters looked most menacing for the Dutch Republic. When the
  young Prince immediately took up his new duties as a member of the Council of
  State, he found the States General engaged in discussing the necessity of
  strengthening the army of defence. On hearing that Zeeland, out of loyalty to
  him, was postponing this decision, because first they wished to appoint a
  Captain-General, he sent, on the very first night of his arrival at the
  Hague, an express to Odyck giving his consent to the proposal, on which
  Zeeland withdrew its opposition. While His Highness had remained utterly
  unimpressed by the frivolous pleasures and voluptuous temptations offered by
  his uncle's Court, he had not failed to take full advantage of his visit to
  England to sum up the political situation. His powerful intellect, his shrewd
  judgment, his patient observation, and his long and careful training had all
  served him well. He had lived in an atmosphere of political and State
  intrigue since he could remember anything; even as a small child he had been
  surrounded by the fluctuations of parties, he had heard State affairs
  discussed, he had been taught in all his lessons&mdash;history, geography,
  mathematics, languages&mdash;the importance of the art of government, and at
  twenty years of age he had a tolerable grasp of the affairs of Europe.
  Although Charles II had concealed from him the Treaty of Dover, the young
  Prince had fairly sized up his uncle's character and his leanings towards
  Roman Catholicism and France. His other uncle, the Duke of York, was
  suspected of being a Roman Catholic, and the King's most powerful mistress
  was also a Roman Catholic and a Frenchwoman, supposed to be under the
  guidance of Jesuits and known to be an emissary of the King of France. The
  Prince could not fail to have noticed these influences at work in the Court
  at Whitehall, nor in his short progress about the country to Oxford,
  Cambridge, Audley End, and Newmarket, to have observed how the feeling of the
  people was staunchly Protestant and in direct contradiction to the policy
  more or less avowed by Charles II. Soon after his return to the Hague,
  William interrupted his careful labours at the Council of State to go on a
  visit to his uncle, the Elector of Brandenburg&mdash;a visit that was more
  political than pleasurable.</p>

  <p>William Frederic, Elector of Brandenburg, son-in-law of Frederic Henry,
  was the most powerful Protestant prince of Germany, both by reason of his
  position as one of the oldest Electors and by the force of his strong
  character and keen intelligence. He had a sincere friendship for the young
  Prince, whom he regarded almost as a son, and in his frank and earnest
  conversation His Highness gathered yet more knowledge as to the expected
  course of events in Europe. The Elector of Brandenburg had great weight in
  the loose confederations of the princes of Germany, who formed those circles
  of the Empire which were only nominally under the rule of the Emperor Leopold
  I. This prince was the hereditary foe of France, and the hereditary ally of
  Spain, whose throne was occupied by a youth, Carlos II, who represented the
  elder branch of the House of Hapsburg, as Leopold himself represented the
  cadet branch. Spain was in a state of decay that could neither be denied nor
  concealed, and only by the intervention of the members of the Triple Alliance
  had France been forced, by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, to return to her
  the Spanish Netherlands. If the most powerful member of this Alliance,
  England, could be detached from it and joined to the force of France, there
  was little question that Spain, when attacked again, would have to relinquish
  all her restored territories. The Elector of Brandenburg and the young Prince
  of Orange were both acutely aware that the present menace of Europe, to
  European balance or stability, was France. Not only the Hapsburgs&mdash;that
  is, the Empire and Spain&mdash;fell naturally into opposition against Louis
  XIV, but all the German provinces and States, the Northern kingdoms, the
  Dutch Republic, the Elector of Brandenburg himself, and England. William's
  recent visit to Whitehall had discovered to his acute observation that the
  most important of these, England, could not be relied on, and was more likely
  to fight side by side with France than against her. This also was the
  conviction of the Elector of Brandenburg, though John de Witt had remained
  completely blinded and thought that Charles II was still a loyal member of
  the Triple Alliance. The young Prince returned to the Hague and waited
  patiently on events; he had every quality which is required for any
  opportunity. From a letter of the elder Huygens to Frederic Magnus of Salm,
  the elder Rhinegrave, we get a glance at His Highness in March, 1671. "M. le
  Prince has been here for two days, handsome and well-made. I complain of him
  because he has England more in his head than this country where he is obliged
  to live and die. We know not if we shall have war or peace."</p>

  <p>So, trained observers like De Witt and Huygens remained, though uneasy,
  yet completely deceived as to the attitude of France and England; Frederic
  William of Brandenburg, certainly, and William of Orange probably, guessed
  the designs of France and the trend of the secret policy of Charles II (the
  restoration of England to the ancient faith by any shameful means), but it
  must be remembered that the first Treaty of Dover (which was the key to the
  situation) did not become public knowledge until a hundred years later; in
  1671 it was a secret hidden from even the shrewdest and keenest of
  Protestants.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

  <p>Menaced thus by enemies at home, whose influence daily increased, and
  threatened by enemies abroad, whose overbearing insolence it was impossible
  to appease, John de Witt maintained his dignity and his fortitude, and
  continued to apply himself, with that application that he had used for twenty
  years, to the business of the State. His wife was dead, and this had been a
  devastating personal grief; his household then consisted of his young
  daughters, and he was often visited by his father and his brother Cornelius
  de Witt, Ruard of Putten; the tall, elegant figure of the Grand Pensionary,
  which then began to stoop at the shoulders from the weight of so many cares
  and anxieties, could daily be seen passing from his house across the Plaats
  under the Gevangenpoort to the Binnenhof. His robust health had valiantly
  withstood the long strain of the years of labour and anxiety, but the thick,
  dark hair which fell on to his plain linen collar was streaked with grey, and
  his face was habitually pallid, and began, though he had only reached his
  forty-fifth year, to show heavy lines. No position could have been more
  difficult and more tragic than that of John de Witt, Grand Pensionary of
  Holland, when the storm began to gather at home and abroad in the year 1670.
  He must then have been aware of the general failure of his republicanism, of
  all his ideals and policies, in which he had so passionately believed and
  which he had so honestly and vigorously served. It must have begun to be
  obvious to him that he could not long delay the restoration of the
  Stadtholdership, and that he would soon see returned to the power of his
  ancestors the proud young man whom he had striven in vain to make into a tame
  subject of the Republic. He could not but have observed that all his
  strenuous endeavours had not changed the character of William of Orange in
  the least. He remained an aristocrat, a born soldier and statesman&mdash;in
  brief, a prince and a Nassau. John de Witt had no influence over him
  whatever. He had not been able to touch the boy's haughty heart, to win his
  gratitude, affection, or obedience. Now that he was free of all authority,
  the Prince showed towards his late governor and tutor, towards John de Witt
  and all his adherents, a harsh and cold hostility. He still lived in the
  Binnenhof, and worked in the same building as John de Witt, on the same
  affairs of State. The two men frequently met, but there was not the least
  confidence or friendliness between them; their demeanour was courteous yet
  scarcely disguised their mutual mistrust and antagonism.</p>

  <p>With a daily-increasing dread, John de Witt saw in the young Prince not
  only the future tyrant of his country, but the ally of England, that
  country's most deadly enemy; or, at least, a power that might easily become
  her most deadly enemy if she allied herself with France, an event of which
  even the waning confidence of John de Witt could not any longer altogether be
  oblivious. Socially, as well as politically, the party of the Prince was
  separated from the party of the Grand Pensionary. His Highness spent his
  leisure&mdash;a leisure as brief as that of the Grand
  Pensionary&mdash;hunting in Guelders. He surrounded himself with members of
  the aristocracy&mdash;the same loyal, bold and devoted young men who had
  accompanied him on his daring expedition to Zeeland and on his late visit to
  England. Nearest in his confidence was William Bentinck, the young Guelders
  nobleman, and Zuylestein, son of his late governor. The illegitimate
  descendants of Frederic Henry and Maurice of Nassau were deeply attached to
  his person. He was a frequent visitor to the beautiful house of Prince John
  Maurice of Nassau-Siegen in the Binnenhof. The young Prince liked elegance,
  good looks, good breeding and aristocracy in his companions, and he was
  seldom seen without one or the other of this troop of gallant young men, who
  all now boldly wore the Orange colours which had been so long forbidden,
  either in silk scarves knotted on their arm with tassels of ribbon on their
  shoulders, or tied round their waist as sashes. William's own feathers,
  ribbons and scarves were also openly displayed in the famous colour of his
  House. On all formal occasions he wore the pale blue ribbon and diamond star
  of the Garter, that supreme emblem of distinguished rank and royal favour. He
  refused to make an appeal for popular sufferance, it was not indeed necessary
  for him to do so, though it had been suggested that he would do well to court
  the women and flatter the men, and show himself less haughty towards the
  people. Without any of these arts, however, he was universally beloved. His
  strict manners, his lack of vice, his reserve and simplicity, appeared to
  appeal to all. He had been strictly educated and trained to present a
  princely appearance and to maintain himself with pride and dignity on the
  most difficult occasions. The superb composure of his manner and the cold
  reserve of his bearing, by no means untouched by arrogance, seemed to please
  the people more than any flattering concession to them could have done. The
  Prince was, and had been since his childhood, a most accomplished horseman,
  able in all the lessons of the <i>haute ecôle</i>; he spared no money in
  procuring himself costly steeds, and the skill and daring with which he
  managed the strong animals were effective assets for him on all his public
  appearances; the Prince did not express his opinion on either men or matters,
  courted no popularity among his equals or the people, mingled in no intrigue,
  and disclosed no ambition. The cosmopolitan society at the Hague was, without
  being either ostentatious, curious or gay, cultured, elegant and pleasant.
  The wide streets, the frequent canals, the fine brick patrician mansions, the
  numerous lofty avenues of limes and wych-elms, the noble and ancient woods
  surrounding the Hague and stretching as far as the dunes of Scheveningen, the
  importance and majesty of the unique group of buildings that formed the
  Buitenhof and the Binnenhof, the fashionable and handsome walks of the
  Voorhout, a population at once sober, modest, thrifty, well-behaved,
  intelligent and cultured, an atmosphere of religious and political freedom
  and of universal toleration, made the Hague one of the most desirable places
  in Europe.</p>

  <p>John de Witt, for all the simplicity of his manner, was magnificently
  housed in his mansion in the Kneuterdyck, close to the Gevangenpoort, or
  gateway, which gave the entrance into the Binnenhof, through which he passed
  every day, followed by the clerk carrying, as some one remarked, "the most
  important papers in Europe" to his work in the chambers of the States in the
  Binnenhof. This house, which looked out on a small walled garden, in which
  were planted lime trees and where pigeons circled, was furnished luxuriously
  and governed with sedate economy by Wendela, the charming and intelligent
  daughter of the Grand Pensionary. Here in the noble rooms, adorned by
  paintings and carvings, furniture of leather and richly-stained wood, John de
  Witt, who was no recluse for all his application to business, entertained
  some of the most cultured company in the Hague; games were indulged in,
  interest was taken in poetry and in music; both the virile and pleasing songs
  of their native land and the more delicate and sentimental melodies of
  England made popular in the Hague by the English exiles, helped to divert the
  brief leisure of John de Witt; the beloved husband of an adored wife, he had
  pleasant and gracious ways with women, and was easily affected by music and
  poetry, in which latter art he had dabbled himself in his youth. In spite of
  his republican ideals and the stern devotion he showed to duty, the
  magnificence of the establishment in the Kneuterdyck was in some sharp
  contrast to the severe home in which John de Witt and his brothers and
  sisters had been brought up in the city of Dordrecht. He now met the
  representatives of kings as equals, and he did not lack handsome chambers and
  lordly audience-rooms in which to receive them. His establishment, if not
  costly or extravagant, was to a certain extent sumptuous. There was no
  difference in the style of his living and in that of Prince John Maurice in
  his house in the Binnenhof, or Count Brederode in his town mansion at the
  Hague. John de Witt was in every way on a level with the greatest nobles of
  the moment.</p>

  <p>It might be said that he was more splendidly housed than was the young
  Prince himself. The Stadtholder's quarters in the Binnenhof had been pulled
  down and rebuilt since the death of the last Prince of Orange. His Highness's
  scanty but ceremonious household was not too magnificently accommodated; he
  had no large reception-rooms at his disposal, and when he wished to give an
  entertainment for his young aunt Mary, Duchess of Zimmern, he had to borrow
  the house of Prince John Maurice, which, with its walls lined with precious
  woods from Brazil and covered with paintings of exotic birds, its wide
  stairway with the elaborate bronze ramp, its pictures by Hondthorst and
  Ravesteyn of the virile Princes of the House of Nassau, with armour and
  orange scarves, its furniture of velvet and silver braid, its chandeliers of
  crystal, and its fine view of the grey waters of the Vyver, and the double
  avenue of trees on the Voorhout, was one of the most tasteful and most noble
  in the Hague. In this mansion Prince John Maurice occasionally gave
  entertainments at which he received the young head of his House. On some of
  these occasions William danced in a ballet, and there, too, he met members of
  all the families of Orangist sympathies who were more and more openly opposed
  to the government of the Grand Pensionary.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

  <p>In this year 1670 the Grand Pensionary of Holland, though often uneasy,
  yet dared still to indulge in dreams of security. He was in a false calm, and
  though troubled on the subject of the Prince of Orange he did not give much
  importance to the menace of storms abroad. He believed that the Triple
  Alliance had secured the safety of the Netherlands in Europe. He relied on
  the assurances of Sir William Temple, a statesman as equally deceived as
  himself on the question of the English politics and equally ignorant of the
  shameful Treaty of Dover. John de Witt, going to and fro his stately house in
  the Kneuterdyck to his stately room in the Binnenhof, where he worked with so
  much application and energy, feared nothing save the revival of the military
  and regal power in the person of the young Prince, who also went to and fro
  to his work in the Binnenhof, disclosing himself and his intentions to none,
  least of all to John de Witt, whom he continued to treat with a distant
  courtesy.</p>

  <p>There was, however, one man in Europe who was destined to affect most
  powerfully the fortunes of these two, John de Witt and William of Orange. He
  was at this time the foremost personage in Europe, Louis de Bourbon, the
  fourteenth Louis of France. Already he had impressed his personality on the
  whole world. There had been no check to his designs nor his ambition. He was
  regarded with admiration and awe by all his contemporaries. In politics he
  was the heir of Cardinal Mazarin, who was the pupil of Armand du Plessis,
  Cardinal Richelieu&mdash;that great statesman who had found France in a
  chaotic condition and had moulded her into an absolute monarchy, and who,
  despite the opposition of the malicious and the frivolous, had broken the
  power of the nobles, suppressed the people, subdued the Protestants at home
  and aided them abroad, for the purpose of humiliating the House of Hapsburg.
  The policy of this unscrupulous and despotic minister had been eminently
  successful, and his achievements had been both continued and consolidated by
  his pupil Cardinal Mazarin, and by the young King whom Mazarin had educated.
  In the prime of his youth Louis XIV had found himself absolute master of a
  mighty kingdom and surrounded by men of genius, the greatest of whom,
  Colbert, organized the finances of France as no finances of any country had
  been organized yet. Trade, commerce and industry flourished; in an atmosphere
  of ease, wealth and luxury, the arts bloomed; Louis XIV was well fitted by
  nature to take advantage of his sumptuous position. His mother had been a
  Spanish Hapsburg and he had inherited something of the lethargic haughtiness
  which distinguished the oldest ruling house in Europe, joined, however, to a
  French vivacity and charm. To a natural ability to shine, to dazzle, to
  command, he joined a pronounced talent for the spectacular, the splendid, the
  impressive, which rendered him very fitted to be a king of a proud and
  glittering court, of a brave and gallant nation. His vanity equalled his
  pride. He had been a king since he was a tiny child, and though he had known
  misfortune and even poverty in his youth, he had always been surrounded by
  flatterers and impressed by the grandeur of his destiny. His tastes were more
  noble than his designs; his conception of royal honour and royal glory
  consisted largely in the conceptions of sumptuous outward display&mdash;great
  palaces, properly equipped armies, troops of artists, poets, architects,
  sculptors, at his command; all the talents working eagerly in his service;
  the most beautiful and voluptuous women, the most witty and accomplished of
  men for his company. These ideals he had achieved in a fashion that amazed
  and fascinated Europe. He had an air of extending everything, of giving a
  bolder and more majestic line, not only to the frontiers of his country but
  to the façades of his palaces. He loved light and air and everything that
  glittered; his windows were wide and opened on to vast terraces and gardens
  which comprised whole landscapes, rivers, mountains, woods, and parterres of
  exotic flowers.</p>

  <p>His apartments were adorned with crystal, with gold, with marble, and when
  these were no longer obtainable, imitations of crystal, of gold and of
  marble. Everything about him was in its several kinds excellent. His music,
  his ballets, balls, women, his courtiers, his superb horses, the chariots in
  which he rode, the parade ground where he reviewed his flashing troops, his
  cabinet where he worked, the chapel where he prayed, the ministers to whom he
  dictated&mdash;all these had qualities of accomplished elegance, of delicate
  splendour, and flamboyant ostentation. The whole nation flattered him in the
  most exaggerated terms of adulation, and he accepted it as no more than his
  due, graciously and courteously, but with no gesture of refusal. His person
  was commanding, his health superb, his face was typical both of his family
  and his position&mdash;a regal countenance with something of the Bourbon and
  something of the Hapsburg. His high cheekbones, his almond-shaped eyes, the
  masses of his frizzled fair hair, his ruddy complexion slightly marked with
  the smallpox, his pose, and pride and arrogant bearing were to be for
  generations the typical figure of the King. He set the fashion for the whole
  of Europe. There was not a gentleman in any country who did not copy the
  clothes, the adornment, the manner and customs of the King of France. He had
  introduced a masculine dress rich, easy and infinitely becoming. He delighted
  in plumes, ribbons, braids, embroidered linen and costly laces. At the time
  of his marriage he had made a triumphant entry into Paris with his Spanish
  Princess, and his appearance is thus described in the <i>Gazette de
  France</i>: "The King was attired in a suit of silver brocade, covered with
  pearls and adorned with a marvellous number of carnation-coloured and silver
  ribbons, with a superb plume of carnation-coloured and silver feathers,
  clasped by a cluster of diamonds. His sword and belt were of the richest
  workmanship, he was mounted on a splendid Spanish horse, a dark bay, with its
  strappings of silver brocade and its harness sewn with precious stones." Such
  a figure, so well calculated to shine in such ostentatious pageantry,
  naturally became the lodestone for the admiration and emulation of a whole
  nation, and an occasion for the awe and jealousy of Europe.</p>

  <p>The young monarch, ardent, ambitious and fiery, was conscious of his
  limitless capacities both for work, enjoyment and the exercise of power. He
  literally beheld the world at his feet. In his <i>Memoires</i> he wrote, "At
  length it seemed to me that I really was a king and born to rule; I
  experienced a sense of well-being difficult to express," and later, he pens
  this line, "The business of a king is great, noble and delightful." So far on
  his way he had been content to listen to the advice of his experienced
  ministers, and the laborious genius of Colbert had directed the prosperity of
  France. But Louis found peace dull, and despised the glories of commerce and
  industry. He desired conquest&mdash;to be a second Alexander. In his youth
  Mazarin had endeavoured to procure his election to the Holy Roman Empire,
  that most superb of pretensions, and Louis had never forgotten the stinging
  humiliation which he had experienced when Leopold Ignatius of Hapsburg was
  preferred in his stead. The House of Hapsburg presented the only possible
  rival to the empire so swiftly and solidly built by Mazarin; no one else
  would dare to challenge France, save Spain or the Empire. Louis XIV dreaded
  Spain, as Richelieu had dreaded her before him. In his youth he had seen a
  war with Spain; his own mother had intrigued with Spain against French
  interests. To subdue, win and silence Spain, Louis had relinquished a high
  and pure romance&mdash;his love for Maria Mancini&mdash;and married the
  daughter of Philip the Fourth, Maria Theresa, a plain and dull woman towards
  whom he felt no affection. On the death of her father and the accession to
  the throne of her half-imbecile brother, Carlos II, Louis had at once seized
  the Spanish Netherlands, claiming them as her apanage. He had as good right
  as most kings in their acts of aggression; the queen's dowry had not been
  paid, and therefore he held that her renunciation was invalid. The Triple
  Alliance had forced Louis XIV to the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle by which he
  relinquished many of his contests, but he had only been checked, not
  defeated; he was merely waiting his time. He might look abroad on Europe in
  this year 1670 and see very little to be feared. The Empire&mdash;a vague and
  disorganized power&mdash;was struggling almost for its existence against the
  Turks. The Emperor was lethargic and had no talent either as statesman or
  soldier; the other Hapsburg, the King of Spain, was a weakling youth
  surrounded by corrupt and quarrelling ministers. The decay of Spain was even
  more rapid than the decay of the Empire. Neither of the Hapsburg monarchs
  seemed greatly to be dreaded; they were impressive only by reason of their
  pretentious titles and the wide sweep of their territories, which they had
  neither men nor money to defend.</p>

  <p>If, therefore, neither the Empire nor Spain&mdash;those ancient enemies of
  France&mdash;was to be feared, there was no one else in Europe whom Louis
  might dread. England he had bought, and held securely, by that secret Treaty
  of Dover and by the pension he was paying to Charles Stewart and his
  ministers. There remained only the Protestant powers to be considered, the
  Dutch Republic and the Scandinavian kingdoms. It was easy for Louis XIV to
  believe that his magnificent army and his superb resources would soon deal
  with these. The Hapsburg was the foe at whom he struck, but the others were
  in the way and must be crushed before he could finally humiliate the Emperor
  and Spain. Louis XIV cherished the most vainglorious dreams, which his
  circumstances seemed indeed to justify. He beheld himself wresting the seat
  of Empire from Vienna to Paris. He saw himself reviving in his own person the
  Empire of a Constantine, an Otto or a Charlemagne. It was reasonable for
  Louis XIV to suppose that there was no one who could contest these claims.
  Gone was the day when it might be said, "If Spain moved, the earth trembled,"
  and the Hapsburgs could describe themselves as "a Monarch, an Empire and a
  Sword." Spain could no longer menace Europe with her old title of "<i>Demon
  du Midi</i>." With every year the power of the Hapsburgs in the Empire
  appeared to grow more shadowy and disturbed. Since Ferdinand of Styria, who
  had so fiercely held his own during the Thirty Years' War and headed so
  valiantly the Catholic reaction, no man of ability had sat on the throne of
  Rudolph of Hapsburg. Louis XIV saw himself without much difficulty dislodging
  these haughty and indolent princes and usurping their power; for while their
  prestige had faded, his had grown. In France royalty was a complete legend
  which had become almost a religion, having its rites, its ceremonies, its
  sacred oil, its flags. It was more than a monarchy, it was a faith. It seemed
  as if France might be said to have created an eighth sacrament&mdash;a
  sacrament that was only administered at Rheims&mdash;the sacrament of
  royalty. French writers spoke of kings "being instituted by God" and "royalty
  being a supreme power given to one only which gives him the right to command
  absolutely."</p>

  <p>In this mood, in these circumstances, inspired by these ambitions, Louis
  XIV cast his eyes on the Dutch Republic. He was tired of the careful, wise
  advice of Colbert, the man of finance who disliked war as a thing stupid and
  wasteful. He listened more to the words of his new minister, the Marquis de
  Louvois, and to the eager acclamations of the brilliant young courtiers and
  princes of the blood who surrounded him. He longed for action, for conquest;
  to see himself the master of lavish territories, to behold cities falling
  before him like cornstalks before a storm. Writers had likened him to Jove,
  to Phoebus Apollo, to Alexander; he felt himself capable of sustaining the
  comparisons. He was in the full prime and bloom of his ardent young manhood.
  His romantic love for Maria Mancini, his idyll with Louise de la Valliére,
  his dutiful regard for his Hapsburg wife, had all been abandoned for his
  passion for the voluptuous Madame de Montespan, a woman in the last degree
  beautiful, sensuous, unprincipled and rapacious, whose licence and luxury
  were alike unlimited. Her dominion over the King's senses was undisputed, but
  she did not mingle with his politics; with haughty insolence she braved the
  scandal of her public connection with Louis whom she regarded as no more than
  her equal; she was of the oldest blood in France. Audacious, wanton and
  unbridled in her passions and desires, in her extravagance and ambition,
  Madame de Montespan stopped at nothing to secure her influence over a man who
  had been the lover of so many women, and faithful to none. Already she had
  begun to give him drugs, evil potions which she obtained from the notorious
  poisoner, whose trial was to be one of the scandals of the century, who
  called herself La Voisin. Madame de Montespan, whose sole object in life was
  to retain her hold over her master, naturally flattered his ambition. She had
  no interest in the wise and grave designs of Colbert, but she was excited and
  pleased by the suggestions of Louvois. War, campaigns, pomp and parade,
  taking of towns, laurel wreaths, triumphant entries, reviews, <i>Te
  Deums</i>, armfuls of captured flags at her feet, poets with their long,
  flattering Latin odes and French verses, artists with their great allegorical
  paintings, arch-heroes, and gods and goddesses&mdash;all these appealed to
  Madame de Montespan if not as deeply as they appealed to Louis, yet as apiece
  with her life and nature. Such influence as she possessed she used to urge
  Louis XIV on to a career of glorious conquests.</p>

  <p>The Spanish Netherlands, ill-protected, and which Louis considered his own
  property, were the obvious first and easy prey; afterwards should come the
  Dutch Republic. Louis XIV had always detested these insolent traders, as he
  termed them; not only had they dared to check him by the Triple Alliance, but
  for years they had criticized him, insulted him, held him up to ridicule, in
  hundreds of pasquinades, pamphlets, news-letters and caricatures. When Louis
  had bitterly and haughtily protested to his ambassadors about the liberties
  taken by these Republicans, his ministers had been forced to answer him that
  it was impossible to hinder public expression in a free country. John de Witt
  would have been willing, no doubt, to repress all comment on the great French
  monarch, but he was powerless to do so. Louis XIV was also, as Oliver
  Cromwell and Charles II had been, jealous of the commercial prosperity of the
  Dutch, who were, in truth, not popular with their neighbours, and here
  Colbert was with him. Their form of government was too peculiar, their wealth
  too enormous, their pretensions too vast, their colonies too tempting; their
  manners, their industry, their virtue too irritating.</p>

  <p>All Europe regarded them with jealousy and hostility. To Louis XIV their
  very manner of constitution was an affront; he believed they had no right
  even to exist. A republic of merchants and shopkeepers was a bad example for
  the peoples of Europe. Their High Mightinesses the States General who held
  their own without a king, without even a governing nobility, whose territory
  was in reality nothing but a delta of the Rhine and the Marne, who out of
  this mud and marsh had built one of the most advanced, prosperous and
  flourishing countries in Europe, who were free and tolerant, who sheltered
  all the malcontents and rebels of Europe, whose printing presses poured out
  the books that every other country refused to license, whose medallists and
  pamphleteers said what they thought of all their neighbours&mdash;such a
  people could not be popular or even tolerated. In England there had been a
  long and persistent campaign of slander against them; they had been called by
  Andrew Marvel "the undigested vomit of the sea," and fiercely attacked by
  Dryden. Their simple manners, their homely virtues, were as disliked as their
  commercial prosperity and their internal order and freedom. Saint Evrèmond,
  the type of Frenchman who flourished at the court of Louis XIV, exclaimed
  with some bitterness, "Must I spend my life contemplating Dutch virtue?" and
  an appointment as Minister or Resident at the Hague was looked upon as a
  disaster. When Louis XIV had been shown a painting by a Dutchman, of flowers
  and insects, one of the exquisite fantasies of still life peculiar to that
  school, he had exclaimed with contempt, "Take away those follies!" and this
  was his attitude to the whole nation, the whole country. Pieter de Groot, son
  of the great jurist Hugo de Groot, was appointed ambassador to Versailles. He
  entered Paris in full panoply of state in a gorgeous coach drawn by six
  horses. He waited upon Louis, and though he was an able and honest man, he
  was able to make no impression on the young monarch, who remarked one day
  while giving an audience to the Dutchman, "Take care, <i>Monsieur
  l'Ambassadeur</i>, the floor is slippery."</p>

  <p>With dismay and dread De Groot saw the portents gathering thickly on the
  horizon of French politics&mdash;portents which foretold an attack on the
  Netherlands, but Boreel, the Dutch ambassador at St. James's, continued to
  assure John de Witt that England would not move, but would remain faithful to
  the Triple Alliance. Despite these assurances and his own trust in the good
  faith of Charles II, events now occurred which caused John de Witt the
  severest alarm. Sir William Temple, his warm admirer and the good friend of
  the Dutch people, was recalled, and replaced by Downing, a man of ill
  character and who was well known to cherish a bitter dislike of the Republic.
  Almost at the same time, the Marquis de Pomponne&mdash;an able and upright
  French diplomat, who in 1669 succeeded the Comte D'Éstrades as ambassador to
  the States&mdash;was abruptly recalled; the post was left vacant, France
  being represented at the Hague only by a <i>chargé d'affaires</i>. Following
  this, all the French officers in the Republic's service threw up their
  commissions and returned to France. Louis XIV was known to be drilling large
  bodies of troops at St. Germains; all the military depots were scenes of
  great activity. In the haughtiest and most peremptory terms, Louis XIV
  renewed his demands for satisfaction for the insults against his person
  contained in Dutch pamphlets and news-letters, and in French newspapers and
  pamphlets printed in the United Provinces. Even John de Witt, with his
  reliance on the Triple Alliance and his confidence in a policy of
  conciliation, could not any longer be deceived in the signs of the times.</p>

  <p>The possibility of war with France and even with England was every day
  drawing closer. The Orange party took advantage of the situation to suggest
  that it would be best to win the friendship of England by elevating the
  Prince of Orange and giving up the old refusal to yield the honour of the
  flag. Bored never ceased to urge De Witt to this course, saying that these
  concessions would at once avert the impending danger that England might side
  with France if a war broke out. Many who had hitherto been supporters of John
  de Witt and his policy were of the same opinion. John de Witt would not,
  however, give way even at this moment. He thought, as he said, if reliance on
  England could only be secured by the elevation of the Prince of Orange to the
  honours of his father, that he "was willing to confess that the remedy was
  worse than the evil." In his heart he still did not believe that the Dutch
  Republic would be attacked by either England or France. He could not conceive
  what excuse Louis XIV could find for such an action, and, not knowing of the
  secret Treaty between the two Kings, he believed that Louis would not, by an
  attack on the Republic, force the Orange party&mdash;which is to say the
  English party&mdash;into power. The young Prince, who was becoming so rapidly
  of such importance not only in the Netherlands but in Europe, still
  maintained his reserve. It was taken for granted, however, by all that his
  interests were identical with those of Charles and Louis&mdash;not with those
  of the Provinces. Whatever their feelings might be towards the Dutch, these
  two Princes were known to be friendly to the young heir of Orange&mdash;their
  kinsman and one of the royal princes of Europe, who was most conveniently at
  hand to assist them in destroying the insolent Republic.</p>

  <p>On every matter save the restoration of the House of Nassau, De Witt was
  conciliatory; he was prepared to bow to the most overbearing of English and
  French demands, even to give the salute of the flag which admitted that
  England was mistress of the seas. These almost servile concessions were
  useless; the complaints of Charles II became louder and Louis XIV placed
  crushing duties on Dutch goods, which forced the States General to tax French
  imports&mdash;a further cause for enmity between the two nations.</p>

        id="ch-18"></a>

  <h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

  <p>On the morning of January 6th/16th, Pieter de Groot, the ambassador of
  Their High Mightinesses at Versailles, had a decisive interview with Louis
  XIV, which proved to the unfortunate diplomat that the King of France was
  determined on an immediate war with his country. Desperate negotiations,
  involved and tedious, had brought no change in the attitude of Louis XIV
  towards the Dutch Republic. Pieter de Groot, an able and a patriotic man who
  had spared neither pains nor money in this desperate mission, and who was now
  crippled with gout, made a bold and almost frantic attempt to win the
  intolerant monarch to a reasonable attitude. "I told the King," he wrote,
  "that my masters asked not to be worse treated than common criminals who at
  least know what crimes are imputed to them; their conscience, I added, is so
  much at ease that they do not doubt that they can clear themselves, and any
  voluntary offence they are ready to make good. The King could obtain every
  reasonable satisfaction which he is about to seek in the chances of war
  instead of having them accorded to the mere power of his name. Having
  obtained an interview, I presented to him the letter from the States. The
  King opened it and said angrily, It is very unnecessary, this has already
  been communicated to the courts of Europe,' and he himself has a copy. The
  King expressed surprise that the States should call into account for his
  armaments, they having been the cause of this. I assured him that the States
  desired nothing more than disarmament and to see His Majesty satisfied. The
  King, to close the interview, replied that having begun his armaments, he
  should now conclude them, and would afterwards come to a determination in
  accordance with the dictates of his glory and his interests."</p>

  <p>Pieter de Groot could only too faithfully interpret the meaning of these
  menacing and arrogant words, which were like a pronouncement of doom to his
  country. Two days afterwards, Louis XIV sent a despatch to the States
  General, couched in terms of the most insulting harshness, and ending with
  the challenge: "We must tell you that we shall increase our armaments both on
  land and at sea, and when they are in that condition in which we propose to
  place them, we shall make such use of them as we consider suitable to our
  dignity, holding ourselves accountable to no man." It was feared from this
  that Louis would not even go through the formality of a declaration of war.
  De Groot, who had exhausted alike his purse, his ability and his patience in
  these fruitless attempts to soften His Christian Majesty, assured the States
  that all further negotiations would be hopeless.</p>

  <p>Conrad Van Beuningen was, however, deceived by the treacherous courtesies
  of the court of Whitehall, and his blindness was delightful to the King of
  France and his ministers, one of whom, Lionne, wrote: "The poor dupe will be
  furious when he sees the last scene of the comedy in which he has so long
  played a pitiful part, which will be nothing less than the complete
  destruction of the United Provinces, who, if they were to be suffered to
  continue their existence at all, would only be allowed to do so as a mere
  appanage to the Kingdom of France." In thus disposing of the future of the
  United Provinces, Louis XIV had not forgotten the interests of his young
  kinsman the Prince of Orange. In agreement with the King of England and in
  accordance with one of the clauses of the Treaty of Dover, it was proposed to
  offer to the young Prince a limited sovereignty over a small portion of the
  conquest. As all reports of him had been favourable, and as he was known to
  be of a princely bearing and training, of ambitious and warlike temperament,
  Louis XIV considered the possibility of offering his young kinsman the baton
  of a Maréchal de France, and even the hand of an illegitimate princess of the
  House of Bourbon. By encouraging and supporting Louis XIV in his generosity,
  Charles II thought he would repay his own immense obligations to the House of
  Nassau and wipe out the huge debt contracted by himself and his father
  towards Frederic Henry and William II. Of all these arrangements William of
  Orange, whether working in the Binnenhof or hunting in Guelders, was
  completely unconscious. He was not represented at any of the courts of
  Europe, and his political power in the States General was limited, his seat
  in the Council a sinecure. Though Louis XIV, as an absolute monarch, had no
  opposition at home to fear from this scheme, this was not the case with
  Charles II. The people of England did not desire a war with the Dutch, both
  for commercial reasons and because the bulk of the English populace had a
  certain sympathy with the Protestant Republic, with whose principles of
  freedom and toleration they were, in the main, in agreement. Nor had Charles
  II any good reason for making a quarrel with his neighbour and his ally. He
  was forced to the same expedient as that adopted by the French monarch, and
  began to send insolent complaints about the freedom of the lampoons,
  caricatures and pamphlets circulated in the Netherlands. He had some
  particular instances to cite&mdash;the great victory of the Dutch when they
  had burnt the shipping at Chatham had provoked in the United Provinces
  demonstrations of patriotic triumph not always expressed with tact or
  delicacy.</p>

  <p>In the town hall at Dordrecht a large picture had been placed which
  represented Cornelius de Witt, brother of the Grand Pensionary, and the
  States Commissioner with the Fleet, crowned by Victory before the English
  ships burnt at Chatham, while the <i>Royal Charles</i>, which had been
  captured, was anchored near the mouth of the Maas for the purpose of, public
  exhibition. The States General had done their best to prevent too much
  licence in the triumph of the people; the pennants and standards which had
  been seized at Chatham had been returned to London, and the more violent of
  the pamphleteers rebuked; John de Witt went as far as possible with all
  manner of concessions, and could not believe, as he wrote to Temple, "that
  the King of England would take notice of trifles, and ignore the real
  intentions of the States." When, however, he found that Charles was
  unappeasable, and continued to complain of these trivial provocations, John
  de Witt expressed himself with some dignity, as well as displeasure. "It
  seems," he wrote to Van Beuningen, "as if the English Government were
  determined upon hostilities towards us to resort to such complaints. We
  cannot understand how a foreign monarch can pretend to lay down the law to a
  free Republic, moreover, the medals have not the offensive character
  attributed to them, and the figures presented on them have no pretension to a
  likeness that could convert them into an effigy of the King of England.
  Neither is it true that the <i>Royal Charles</i> is shown for money, or that
  it has been made into an alehouse, where success is drunk to the future
  war&mdash;a subject on which we should have no reason to congratulate
  ourselves." A secret meeting of the States General, however, decided to make
  yet further concessions, and to give no excuse for Charles II to attack them.
  Copies of the lampoons were seized, the dies of the medals were broken, the
  English arms were taken off the <i>Royal Charles</i> and the name changed.
  These friendly actions flattered and pleased the English people, but could
  have no effect on the already fixed policy of the English King, who now, with
  superb effrontery, accused the States General of coming to a secret
  understanding with France, and therefore being the first to break the Triple
  Alliance. On the States General offering a fresh Alliance, Charles demanded
  subsidies, but even De Witt would not go as far as this: "The best thing for
  us to do," he wrote to Boreel, "is to employ our money in ships and soldiers
  for our defence." Refusal was made with a better conscience, since it was
  already known that Charles required, as well as subsidies, the towns of Brill
  and Flushing.</p>

  <p>A pretext for a rupture with the United Provinces was now sought. Lady
  Temple followed her husband home to England in August 1671. The yacht with
  the royal flag flying was directed to search out the Dutch fleet and demand a
  salute to the flag, a claim which the Dutch captain refused to concede. The
  dispute that followed was made the most of at the English court. Temple wrote
  to his father: "The Dutch ministers at court [Beuningen and Boreel], as ill
  noses as they have, begin to smell the powder after the captain's shooting."
  Charles, however, allowed the affair to drag on&mdash;his armaments were not
  yet complete.</p>

  <p>The autumn and winter passed with alternations of hope and fear, and the
  fluctuations of intrigue, desperate on the part of the Dutch and insincere on
  the part of the English and French, who had fully resolved on the complete
  destruction of their small but prosperous neighbour. Louis XIV had also
  contrived to outbid the Dutch in the purchase of Sweden. It was now known
  that she would remain neutral, at least in any contest that might ensue
  between the Dutch and the French. The Triple Alliance on which John de Witt
  still relied was thus completely dissolved.</p>

  <p>On January 2nd/12th, 1672, a Proclamation of Charles II announced
  suspension of Exchequer interest on loans for a year, which placed the sum of
  a million and a half sterling at the disposal of the Government, caused the
  failure of several banks and the ruin of many bondholders, as well as dealing
  a dangerous blow to the commercial credit of England. It also helped to
  destroy the faith of the English people in the English King, and to create a
  deeper gulf between popular feeling and court policy. Both at home and abroad
  the behaviour of Charles had been faithless, iniquitous and shortsighted.
  Neither his motives, nor the motives of Louis XIV, in thus desiring the
  destruction of the Dutch Republic, were influenced by political
  considerations, but only by private spite, malice and a desire for revenge;
  although the excuse might be that it was desired to destroy the Dutch
  commerce and divert that trade to English and French ports, this was a most
  fallacious argument, and any man worthy of the name of statesman could have
  pointed out that the English and French were more likely to ruin their trade
  by this war than to increase it by any possible victory. This was clearly
  seen by the bulk of the English people who, from first to last, were against
  war. The French people had no opinion in the matter. Those who were not
  blinded by the glory of the dazzling young King were in too insignificant a
  minority to have any weight.</p>

  <p>Louis XIV was quite incapable of foreseeing that this war, by which he
  promised himself so much satisfaction and glory, would be the first step on
  the path which was finally to lead him to disaster. Though his ambitions were
  lofty, his intelligence was mediocre.</p>

  <p>The last concession offered by the States General to England was that of
  the appointment of the Prince of Orange as Captain- and Admiral-General, and
  the employment of a considerable sum intended for the King's privy purse.
  These final offers of submission were useless. The two Dutch ambassadors who
  waited upon Lauderdale and Arlington with them were insolently told that the
  time for negotiation was past. The United Provinces now saw themselves
  opposed by the two most powerful monarchies in Europe, England and France,
  who appeared resolved, against justice, reason and policy, on their immediate
  destruction. They had no ally since the defection of Sweden; their old enemy
  Bernhard Christopher Van Galen, Bishop of Munster, was waiting to fall again
  on their Northern frontiers, and in addition to this they were menaced by an
  internal disruption becoming daily more fierce; while the people, the clergy
  and more and more of the middle classes and nobility rallied round the Prince
  of Orange as the only hope of conciliating their two powerful enemies, the
  Republican party regarded him with more and more dread as an instrument in
  the hands of the two Kings who threatened to destroy them. Not only was the
  country in an isolated position, but her army was not by any means fitted to
  resist an invasion. His dislike for the military power associated with the
  House of Nassau had caused John de Witt to neglect the army, and to make his
  own followers and relations&mdash;men who were not of a military breed or
  tradition&mdash;into officers and commanders of garrisons and forts. The old
  and bitter question of a standing army had been the one on which Prince
  William II had fallen out with the city of Amsterdam; it had always been the
  policy of his House to maintain a large and imposing force with which to
  protect the liberties of the Republic. With this policy John de Witt and his
  party had always been in direct opposition. He had given every attention to
  the navy, among the finest leaders of which was his brother, Cornelius de
  Witt. The native economy of the States had accorded well with the designs of
  the Grand Pensionary of Holland. They had not spent sufficient money on
  fortifications, on troops, or on bribes to foreign courts&mdash;which
  partially accounted for the defection of Sweden, who might have remained
  faithful to the Triple Alliance if paid highly enough. Monsieur Pomponne,
  however, sent to Stockholm and outbid the Dutch in that quarter, and the
  treaty of neutrality between France and Sweden was concluded.</p>

  <p>Continuing his policy of isolating the United Provinces, Louis XIV, by
  bribery and delicate negotiation, had received the promises either of
  neutrality or assistance from the Emperor and some of the German princes, the
  Elector of Cologne and the Bishop of Munster. French diplomacy had triumphed
  at the Court of Vienna, in spite of the hereditary dislike between the
  Emperor and the King of France, and the fact that Leopold had demanded the
  return of the province of Lorraine in favour of the Duke Charles IV, a
  request that had been peremptorily refused by Louis. Matters were, however,
  adjusted, and in consideration of the satisfaction given to the Emperor on
  the subject of the guarantee of the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle promised by
  Leopold to Spain, a secret treaty of neutrality was signed, by which the
  Emperor undertook to give no assistance to the States General, provided the
  King refrained from carrying the war into the Imperial Dominions. This Treaty
  was not sincere on either side. Both monarchs were only searching for a
  pretext to fall upon one another, but, for the moment, it suited them to be
  neutral. Leopold was threatened, not only by an invasion by the Turks, but by
  a revolt in Hungary, which, though he had put it down with a ruthless hand,
  was still seething, and Louis was intent on the destruction of the Dutch.
  Provided the Spanish Netherlands were not annexed to France, the Emperor had
  no particular interest in the safety of the Dutch Republic, which he disliked
  as Protestant and plebeian.</p>

  <p>Louis XIV also took into his pay several of the more important of the
  German princes, thus holding at his disposal most of the Electoral College of
  the Empire; the Archbishop of Mainz, the Archbishop of Cologne, those
  powerful potentates, the Bishop of Treves, the Elector of Saxony, the Elector
  of Bavaria (to whom he had secretly promised that his daughter should marry
  the Dauphin), the Elector Palatine, Charles Louis, whose daughter had lately
  become the second wife of the King's brother, the Duke of Orleans; the Duke
  of Würtemberg, the Duke of Neuburg, the Bishops of Spires and
  Strasbourg&mdash;had all been won by money and promises to the side of the
  King of France. From Cleves, Prince John Maurice of Nassau gave warning of
  the military preparations of the Bishop of Munster. The Republic was thus
  surrounded on all sides by enemies or those who were bribed to stand by and
  see her destroyed. De Groot gave information to John de Witt as to all the
  preliminaries on the grandest possible scale for the invasion of the United
  Provinces. John de Witt felt the only hope lay in rousing the spirit of
  Europe against this wanton aggression against the Republic. France, he
  declared to the agents of the Duke of Brunswick-Luneburg, "cannot increase
  her power without becoming dangerous to all the rest of Europe, and after the
  conquest of the United Provinces there will be nothing to prevent her
  universal domination." He then made vain efforts to secure an alliance with
  Switzerland and Denmark.</p>

  <p>At this moment, which seemed so dark and terrible to the United Provinces,
  two friends appeared to succour her; these were the Elector of Brandenburg
  and the Queen Regent of Spain, both of whom were directly concerned in Louis
  XIV's proposed conquest. The Spanish foresaw the complete loss of all their
  possessions in the Netherlands. Baron Lisola, the Imperial Envoy at the
  Hague, who remained faithful to the Dutch cause, was an active intermediary
  in this affair. He foresaw that the supremacy of the House of Hapsburg could
  not exist in the same cosmos as the supremacy of the House of Bourbon; he
  knew quite well that Austria and France, despite secret treaties, must sooner
  or later come to a conflict. It was therefore necessary to assist Spain and
  to prevent the French from occupying the Spanish Netherlands. An even more
  valuable ally than the decaying Spanish monarchy was Frederic William,
  Elector of Brandenburg, uncle by marriage to the Prince of Orange, and the
  most powerful among German Princes. He had lately waged a successful war
  against John Casimir, King of Poland, which had enabled him to add to his
  hereditary demesne the sovereignty of ducal Prussia which he had formerly
  held as a fief from Poland. This ambitious, industrious, able and wise-minded
  Prince now held possessions which extended from Cleves on the farther side of
  the Rhine to the banks of the Vistula. Mildly hostile, because of his
  connection with the House of Orange, to John de Witt and the Republican party
  in the Netherlands, the Elector, like the Kings of France and England, hoped
  for the elevation of his nephew, but he did not wish to see the independence
  of the United Provinces destroyed. He desired to act the important part of
  mediator in the struggle which he foresaw. One important power remained
  aloof, but watchful, during this preparation for war&mdash;the Pope, the aged
  Clement X (Emilio Altieri), who had in 1669 succeeded the sage and temperate
  Clement IX (Giulio Rospigliosi), and had not the vigour to resist the
  pretensions of Louis XIV, who, in 1663, had shown his intention to deny the
  temporal authority of the Papacy by his acceptance of the decision of the
  <i>Faculté de théologie de Paris</i>, so favourable to himself on this
  question. It was, however, obvious that any pope must favour His Caesarean
  Majesty against His Most Christian Majesty, for Papacy and Empire were in
  strict if undefined alliance; the Hapsburg who supported the supremacy of the
  Church would have the help of the Vatican against the Bourbon who had denied
  this&mdash;and with some insolence.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

  <p>Frederic William, Elector of Brandenburg, was the first prince who showed
  any disposition to withstand the designs of Louis XIV. While his
  fellow-Electors and the other potentates of the Empire had been bought by the
  French King, the Elector of Brandenburg maintained an independent attitude;
  neither his position nor his character enabled him to endure with equanimity
  the idea of a universal monarchy, whether it be that of Bourbon or of
  Hapsburg. He came of a most illustrious family, and ruled a people who had
  long been known as the most warlike of the German races. One of his
  ancestors, Joachim II, had been one of the earliest and most powerful
  protectors of the reformed religion; he had been educated at Leyden and in
  the campaigns of Frederic Henry of Orange, and was now a man of fifty-two
  years who had spent his whole life in industriously extending and solidifying
  his possessions, in establishing finance, alliances, trade and commerce. His
  ambition grew with his prosperity, and he already dreamed of converting his
  electoral barret into a regal crown. In 1647 he had married Luisa Henrietta,
  daughter of Frederic Henry, and through her he might one day hope to add to
  his vast fortune the huge possessions of the Princes of Orange, between whom
  and his wife there only stood the life of the present delicate young Prince.
  In 1666, at the Peace of Oliva, he had concluded an alliance between Austria
  and Brandenburg. He was in possession of a large standing army, for which
  purpose he had induced his estates to grant an annual income. His first wife
  had died recently (1667), and in 1668 he had married Dorothea, the Dowager
  Duchess of Brunswick-Luneburg. Frederic William made a considerable figure
  among the princes of his time, and posterity has given him the title of
  "Great." If his relations with foreign princes were fluctuating and shifty,
  if his intrigues were on no higher level than those of his neighbours, at
  least he had the advancement of his own country always at heart. He was at
  once wise, bold, audacious and prudent, a definite and powerful personality
  both in the field and the cabinet; his personal wish was to avoid war and to
  cultivate in his dominions the arts of peace. He united the Spree and the
  Oder by a canal, founded the university of Duisberg, established a postal
  system, and promoted agriculture. His personal inclinations were against
  France, and he viewed with apprehension the restless ambitions of Louis XIV.
  In person he was robust and heavy, with a massive countenance, scowling
  brows, a fringe of heavy dark hair, and a huge jaw. His personal habits were
  simple. He liked to cut his own peaches and grapes, to catch his own fish,
  and even to make his own purchases in the market-place of Berlin, but he
  never neglected to have his breast blazing with the sumptuous orders of which
  he was in possession. He liked to see his wives adorned with the most costly
  of jewels, and his sympathies were wholly with princes and aristocrats. He
  had a sincere affection for his young ward and nephew, the Prince of Orange,
  but he did not wish him to purchase a shred of power at the cost of the
  liberties of the Dutch. It was rather the wish of the great Elector of
  Brandenburg to see William restored to the honours once enjoyed by Frederic
  Henry under the same terms as had existed between that prince and the
  Republic. His nature, too, was magnanimous and generous. A sturdy sense of
  justice set him on the side of the United Provinces against Louis XIV.</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>After considerable negotiations and hagglings&mdash;for even in the moment
  of their greatest peril the States General could not persuade themselves to
  be lavish with their cash&mdash;an agreement was made with the Elector of
  Brandenburg in May 1672. The States had disputed over this important secret
  treaty as if, as it was tauntingly remarked, it was a question of "buying a
  dish of fish"; but at length, concealed under the appearance of a promise of
  neutrality, the pact was made. The Elector agreed to furnish the States
  General with twenty thousand men and a force of artillery, of which he was
  himself to take command and encamp in Westphalia. The States General
  undertook to provide half the expenses of the levy and pay of this army, and
  a sum of twenty-two thousand dollars was paid to the Elector of Brandenburg
  on May 17th/27th, nor was this the limit of the help afforded by Frederic
  William to the threatened Republic. He instructed his envoys in all the
  courts of Europe to watch and foil the machinations of the French
  diplomats.</p>

  <p>Godard Van Reede, Lord of Amerongen, the Dutch Plenipotentiary at Berlin,
  congratulated himself on procuring such an ally for the Republic at a moment
  when it seemed almost impossible that anyone would come forward to render her
  even the promise of assistance. He wrote to a friend with gratitude, "This is
  the Lord's doing and marvellous in our eyes."</p>

  <p>The Elector of Brandenburg now endeavoured to get other allies for the
  States General among the German princes. As he was extremely influential in
  Germany, both from his character and his possessions, he contrived to draw
  away from Louis XIV the Archbishop of Mainz, who enjoyed great influence with
  the Emperor Leopold, and the Electors of Cleves and Saxony; the Archbishop of
  Mainz had given his patronage to the great philosopher, Leibnitz, whose lofty
  schemes included one for the union of the Churches. Inspired by his patron,
  Leibnitz endeavoured to draw the attention of Louis XIV from the Dutch
  Republic by presenting him with a memorial calculated to inflame him with the
  design for the conquest of Egypt.</p>

  <p>The German philosopher declared that: "the King of France not merely wins
  immortal glory and constant ease, but also a certain victory which he could
  take advantage of to obtain recognition of his pre-eminence in Europe and to
  become the arbiter of all nations." The bait was ineffectual. Louis XIV
  continued to occupy himself in his preparations for the destruction of the
  United Provinces. The Alliance with Spain was not so easily or so happily
  concluded as that with the Elector of Brandenburg, a nearer neighbour and a
  fellow-Protestant. The sombre and involved policies of Madrid, directed by
  the vain and foolish Queen-Mother and her Jesuit advisers, were neither
  lucid, swift, nor reasonable. Jerome Van Beverningh was sent to Madrid where
  the former Resident, Baron Reede Van Renswoude, had recently died. The result
  of Jerome Van Beverningh's negotiations with the parties whom he found in
  power in the Court at Madrid was a treaty, signed on December 17th/27th,
  1671, of mutual assistance, to be ratified within a period of two months, and
  this in spite of the flatteries and menaces of Louis XIV, who was perfectly
  aware of the negotiations and had done his utmost to break them off. Neither
  Brandenburg, however, nor the Spanish Alliance, nor the efforts of the
  Archbishop of Mainz at the Court of Leopold, nor the possible friendly
  feeling of Denmark, could suffice to save the United Provinces from their
  threatening fate, which, it was obvious, was to be an immediate invasion.
  Their wealth, which had been the source of so much envy to their neighbours,
  their commerce&mdash;the finest in the world, their supremacy over the ocean,
  would not suffice to save them from this danger, from which nothing could
  have protected them but that large military force which they had refused to
  maintain since the death of Prince William II&mdash;by an ironic paradox,
  they had indeed rather striven to weaken their own army, thinking that in
  that lay their security; the tragic falsity of this policy was soon to be
  exposed.</p>

  <p>John de Witt had always believed that the blessings of peace could be
  enjoyed without the means of preserving that same peace. It had always seemed
  to him not only a dangerous encouragement of a military policy, which would
  put too much power in the hands of the Princes of Orange, but also far too
  lavish an expense, to maintain a large standing force. After the Treaty of
  Aix-la-Chapelle, the army of the States General, never large since the death
  of William II, had been yet further reduced; thirty-seven thousand foot and
  four thousand six hundred horse had been disbanded.</p>

  <p>This reduction of more than half the army insured also a corresponding
  reduction in the expenses, most of which had been borne by the State of
  Holland; so the Grand Pensionary saved the pockets of his own party. The
  States now possessed twenty-nine regiments of infantry and ten of cavalry, of
  which fourteen regiments of infantry and five of cavalry were kept up by the
  State of Holland.</p>

  <p>This army was badly administered under a system that was open to all
  manner of abuses. The greatest weakness of the Dutch army was the quality of
  the officers; all the fine stalwart old soldiers who had been trained under
  Frederic Henry had been markedly slighted and passed over because of their
  Orangist sympathies, and had resigned in proud disgust, and in their place
  the Republican party had put the sons of citizens who were of their own
  connection or who acted in their favour. These were mostly very young men of
  no military tradition, and who used their posts solely as a means of money
  making; some kept their companies below the proper complement in order to
  increase their profits, others left their duties to substitutes; for, under
  the system used by the Dutch, the army was recruited by means of levies
  carried out at the expense of the colonels and captains who were appointed in
  advance to nominal commands of regiments or companies, and who repaid
  themselves out of the price paid them by the States for each man. Discipline
  was lax. The commissariat was utterly disorganized, and such was the besotted
  blindness of the Government that the Marquis de Louvois, Louis XIV's
  brilliant war minister, had actually been able to buy the States General's
  stock of ammunition; the instinct for money-making so overcoming the instinct
  of patriotism, it had been possible for the chief purveyor to the French
  army, Berthelot, through the intervention of a Jew banker at Amsterdam, to
  obtain the most considerable part of the stores of powder, saltpetre, lead,
  and matches in the possession of the United Provinces. These were forwarded
  to the Elector of Cologne for the service of the King of France. Only when
  the country had been largely depleted of its vital stores were the suspicions
  of the States General aroused; but it was then too late. Very little
  ammunition was left in the country, and John de Witt was reduced to the
  desperate expedient of buying what he could in the Spanish Netherlands. The
  fortifications of the United Provinces were in a piteous condition. Those
  that had not been entirely abandoned&mdash;the bastions turned into gardens,
  the ditches dried up&mdash;were maintained in a state that was merely
  laughable from a military point of view. These fortified towns were very
  numerous and had been of the first importance in the great days of Maurice of
  Orange and Frederic Henry, when, beneath their walls, whole schools of
  warfare had been held by those two magnificent generals. It was then
  considered sufficient training for a young soldier to serve in a campaign
  under either of these princes, and the camps held beneath these great cities
  were models of discipline, organization and military science. Now, houses had
  been built on the ramparts, the bastions had fallen in or been turned into
  promenades for the wealthy citizens, guns had been removed or were covered
  with rust and useless, garrisons had been withdrawn, or were small, idle and
  undisciplined. The country might be considered as undefended and almost un
  defensible.</p>

  <p>The Grand Pensionary was concerned with the state of affairs, but was
  still too deluded to realize the full danger of the position. He made some
  attempt to reorganize the army and to fill up worthily the high posts of
  command; that of commander-in&mdash;chief had been vacant for thirteen years,
  since the death of Major-General Count Brederode. The last General of
  Ordnance, Prince William Frederic of Nassau-Dietz, who had died four years
  before, had had no successor. The States General now made use of two old
  soldiers to fill the chief command; one was Prince John Maurice of
  Nassau-Siegen, the other was Paul Würtz, Baron of Ornholm, a native of the
  Duchy of Schleswig, who had seen good service in Sweden and Denmark. As
  Lieutenant-General of cavalry was appointed another aged soldier, the
  Rhyngrave, Frederic Magnus, Count Salm, Governor of Maastricht, who entirely
  occupied himself with fortifying that neglected and most important city.
  Associated with him in his command was the Prince of Tarentum, great-nephew
  of Frederic Henry, under whom he had served. This Prince, French by birth,
  made no secret of his hostility towards the States General, and continued to
  offer advances to the Prince of Orange whom he hoped to secure as a husband
  for his daughter. After causing endless disputes, jealousies and bad feeling
  with the Rhyngrave, Prince John Maurice and Paul Würtz, the Prince of
  Tarentum resigned his office and returned to France.</p>

  <p>By March 1671, an extraordinary War Budget was at length carried, and De
  Witt made strong efforts to raise money by imposing taxes on corn, on soap,
  on wine; but difficulties in the way of collection rendered these measures
  abortive. He then desperately resorted to the expedient of raising loans on
  annuities; the sum necessary for guaranteeing the repayment of the loans
  being raised by a tax on beers, horses, yachts and private carriages. Whilst
  taking these over-due measures for military defence and the pecuniary
  position of his country, John de Witt used his utmost endeavours to reconcile
  the internal dissensions and to win over to his side again those men who had
  been his friends and who had now become his opponents, notably Gaspard Fagel,
  the Pensionary of Haarlem, who was, by John de Witt's influence, moved from
  that position to that of the post of Secretary to the States General, which
  made him the second personage in the nation. By this measure John de Witt had
  hoped to buy the gratitude and loyalty of one who had once been his friend
  and follower. In this hope he was again deceived. Gaspard Fagel, an
  industrious, shrewd and able man, was not won to the policies of John de
  Witt. He believed that all hope for his country and for his own advancement
  lay with the Prince of Orange, and he aimed to be not the lieutenant of John
  de Witt, but the head of the party which should restore the young Prince to
  power.</p>

  <p>No sooner had John de Witt concerted these plans to conciliate his
  opponents than he was disturbed by fresh disputes as to the appointment of
  the young Prince of Orange as Captain-General, which post he was supposed to
  assume when he was twenty-two years old, i.e. November 1672. His party
  demanded his instant elevation, also the grant of twenty-five thousand
  florins for his salary as Councillor of State. John de Witt opposed both
  these demands. He still wished to forbid the union in one hand of the civil
  and military power, and more than ever did he profoundly mistrust the quiet
  young Prince&mdash;ignorant of military science, only twenty-one years of
  age, kinsman of both the great Kings who were threatening the Republic, and
  who was known to be keeping up an active correspondence with his uncle, the
  King of England. The Grand Pensionary sternly suggested that before His
  Highness presumed to take a high command in the army he should put himself
  under one of the generals now commanding these forces and earn the confidence
  of the nation by accompanying the army as a member of the Council of
  State.</p>

  <p>William of Orange never wasted time and energy in disputes and arguments.
  It was already his confirmed habit, and one that was to last through his
  lifetime, to hold aloof from all agitations until a decisive moment had
  arrived for him to declare his mind. Such a moment he now believed to have
  arrived. When John de Witt paid him one of the formal visits of courtesy,
  which were still exchanged between them, he told him that, having entered
  upon his twenty-second year, he considered himself fitted to be appointed
  Captain-General of the army. It was to be the last time that John de Witt
  would have the opportunity of conciliation with his former pupil; he might
  even then, by giving way, or by at least showing compliance, have secured in
  some measure the gratitude and loyalty of the young man; but he remained
  inflexibly attached to his own ideals, and pointed obstinately to the letter
  of the law, declaring that the Act could not come into force until William
  had completed his twenty-second year. He was even imprudent enough to wound
  the pride of the sensitive youth by showing a scornful surprise at his
  pretensions; two unbendable wills, so long in opposition, had finally
  clashed, and it was clear that one must break.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

  <p>After long-drawn-out, heated and confused debates in the Assembly of the
  States General, where the Orangists and the followers of John de Witt alike
  used all the resources at their command, it was decided to offer the command
  of the army to the Prince for one campaign only, and not to make the
  nomination of Captain-General definite before he should have completed his
  twenty-second year.</p>

  <p>His Highness, who had waited with difficult composure and patience for the
  result of these deliberations, declined the proffered honour, and this
  against the advice of his own friends, who believed his refusal was inspired
  by youthful impetuosity and indiscretion.</p>

  <p>Gaspard Fagel, alert, bold, shrewd, who was fast becoming the Prince's
  closest adviser, was, however, behind him, and had counselled him to refuse
  this clipped and limited office. William was assured, also, that the two
  Major-Generals, Prince John Maurice and Baron Würtz, would decline the chief
  command, if it was not given to him. He therefore sent a stern message to the
  State of Holland (his real enemies), declaring that they might spare
  themselves the trouble of sending any deputies to him as he regretted he
  would have to send them back with a refusal.</p>

  <p>Conrad Van Beuningen, who had just returned from London, endeavoured to
  persuade the Prince to give way, but made no impression on him, finding, as
  he said, "that young gentleman tolerably firm and tolerably positive in his
  disposition." This cold resolution on the part of the Prince of Orange
  stimulated his supporters; they regretted the concessions to which they had
  yielded. Fresh deliberations took place, and four Provinces&mdash;Guelders,
  Zeeland, Friesland and Groningen&mdash;announced that they now made choice of
  the Prince of Orange as Captain- and Admiral-General for life as soon as he
  should have attained the legal age, and that no further vote on the subject
  should be required of them. Two other Provinces, Utrecht and Overyssel, made
  the same declaration, though making their consent dependent on the unanimous
  agreement of the Provinces. The deputies of Holland now found themselves
  almost alone. Even the courage, vigour and inflexible obstinacy of John de
  Witt could not push further. The utmost they could do was to make the
  appointment temporary for the present and to confirm their promise to make it
  permanent in the future.</p>

  <p>The Prince of Orange was given the command of all the troops, including
  the militia, and only excepting the companies of bodyguards and cavalry which
  should be in the capital, Amsterdam. He was not, however, appointed.
  Admiral-General for fear of offending De Ruyter, who now held the chief
  command in the navy.</p>

  <p>With his future thus guaranteed, the Prince of Orange no longer hesitated
  to accept the post offered to him. Gaspard Fagel, Secretary to the States
  General, the second man in the country and rapidly becoming of the first
  importance, waited on the young Prince to give him the news of his own and
  His Highness's diplomatic triumph. Through streets thronged by people
  shouting for him with gratified excitement, William of Orange proceeded to
  the Assembly of the States General, where he was invested in his office and
  where he took an oath of fidelity to Their High Mightinesses. On the
  following day the new Captain-General entertained all the members of the
  States General to a magnificent banquet in the <i>Ridderzaal</i> in the
  Binnenhof. On occasion he could be sumptuous. The feast was on a princely
  scale. Toasts were drunk to the sound of flourishes of trumpets and salvos of
  artillery; the name, the person, the carriage, the air of the new chief of
  the army impressed even his opponents; he seemed born to allure and command.
  The less trouble he took to engage anyone to his cause, the more stately and
  reserved his demeanour, the more insistent and bold his demands for power and
  precedence, the greater were the enthusiasm and devotion that his name and
  person evoked.</p>

  <p>Though John de Witt had not given way until he had been forced to do so,
  though his opinions remained unalterable, his public spirit and patriotism
  caused him to give every support in his power to the young man who was now
  chief of the army. The Orangists, however, could not forgive&mdash;and it
  seemed likely enough that the taciturn young Prince shared their
  feeling&mdash;the long opposition which John de Witt had placed in the way of
  their desires, and the fact that the Prince had for the moment not obtained
  full authority, and that such as he had would be restricted by the deputies
  of the States General who would represent the sovereign powers of the Federal
  Assembly, who must always accompany him.</p>

  <p>Among the other officers who held the higher command in the new and
  hastily re-organized army of the States General the young Prince of Orange
  could count many supporters. The two Major-Generals, particularly Prince John
  Maurice of Nassau-Siegen, were loyally attached to him, and readily placed
  themselves under the command of the young man of twenty-one. The Rhyngrave
  was also a connection of his and was well-disposed towards him, the Count
  Salm, the young Rhyngrave, was his close friend. So also was the Count of
  Nassau-Saarbrücken, a famous soldier, proud and disagreeable with every one
  except the Prince, who was second in command of the cavalry. The command of
  the infantry was given to another of His Highness's relations, and most
  trusted friend, Frederic of Nassau, Lord of Zuylestein. Under Zuylestein was
  Count Köningsmarck, a Swede, and William Aylva&mdash;belonging to one of the
  most famous families of Friesland, both tried soldiers. Count Homes was
  Master-General of Ordnance. Walraad, Count of Nassau-Hadamar, was governor of
  the great fortress of Bergen-op-Zoom; another officer of high rank, Count
  Stirum, was a relation of the Prince. He could therefore count upon loyal
  support and devotion from most of the chief officers of the Army, many of
  whom were princes of his own house. There was, however, among them a man whom
  the Prince had always disliked, the Vicomte John Barton de Montbas,
  brother-in-law of Pieter de Groot, the unfortunate ambassador to Versailles,
  another person who was most displeasing to the Prince of Orange. Both De
  Groot and Montbas were personal friends of John de Witt, and it was to his
  influence that they owed their positions in the army.</p>

  <p>John de Witt had spoken of "the wooden keys in the port of Amsterdam," and
  never neglected the navy as he had the army: Admiral de Ruyter's command of
  the fleet was renewed; he had under him some of those stalwart heroes whose
  names had made Dutch valour on the seas famous throughout the world: Van
  Gent, Van Nes, and the Bankaerts (who commanded between them the squadrons of
  Holland, Zeeland and Friesland); the brave, upright, honest, patriotic and
  devoted Cornelius de Witt, as a deputy of the Council of War, was appointed
  Plenipotentiary to the Fleet. No effort was spared to make the famous fleet
  of the Republic worthy of its reputation. It consisted of more than a hundred
  and thirty ships, of which seventy-five were line of battle and frigate;
  eighteen reserve vessels were being eagerly constructed.</p>

  <p>John de Witt now worked laboriously to undo the effects of his own policy
  of twenty years, and spared no efforts to reinforce the army; he endeavoured
  to get mercenary levies from abroad&mdash;Switzerland, Germany, Denmark and
  Sweden. He tried to encourage good patriots to raise at their own expense
  soldiers and sailors, in return for which services they would receive a
  commission. The militia was recruited and paid for at the expense of the
  towns. All the reserves were called out. The peasants were requisitioned for
  the various entrenchment works; they were obliged to drill and meet once a
  week, and were divided into twenty-eight regiments. In short, John de Witt
  neglected nothing that human effort could accomplish to meet this dreadful
  crisis.</p>

  <p>It was, however, too late for John de Witt, and almost too late for the
  Dutch Republic; the recruiting was too costly and too hasty; the officers
  were inexperienced, the troops undisciplined, and the peasants refused to
  enlist. After four-and-twenty years of peace the entire nation had grown
  averse to the thoughts of war; the lower and the middle classes were absorbed
  in trade, money-making, enjoyment of prosperity and even luxury; they were
  enervated, as a nation becomes after a full generation without war; the
  Orangists, long out of office, were alone in their liking and aptitude for a
  military life, even many of the aristocrats were of the school of John de
  Witt and, elevated by wealth and comfort and all the felicities of peace,
  were quite against making any effort in self-defence; few of them really
  believed that disaster was about to overtake them. For a long while military
  service had fallen into discredit; it seemed indeed ridiculous to talk of war
  or soldiering in face of the lovely country every inch of which was superbly
  cultivated, the great rivers laden with rich ships, the ports and towns, the
  country-houses, fine meadows and fields, all the signs of culture,
  prosperity, safety, ease and stability. While the chief of the government
  feared invasion and conquest, it was impossible to bring this fear home to
  the minds of the people. They believed themselves secure, and they looked
  with half-amused scorn upon all these efforts to arouse them to their
  defence.</p>

  <p>Against this small Republic, as yet but half-aroused as to her danger,
  Louis XIV and Charles II made vast preparations. Not only could the French
  King command large sums of money, but he had at his disposal the most
  efficient troops in Europe. French levies had been made in Italy and
  Switzerland. De Groot had warned the Grand Pensionary at the beginning of the
  year 1671 that commissions were being given for raising one hundred and
  twenty fresh companies of cavalry. At the end of that year he added, in
  another letter: "Forty new commissions have been sent out from the cavalry, a
  hundred from the infantry, and all French officers serving abroad have been
  recalled, shoes are being roughed for ice, and a number of small bridges of
  rushes and reeds have been constructed for crossing rivers." Louis XIV's army
  was increased to one hundred and seventy-six thousand men. These consisted of
  veteran soldiers&mdash;the French Guards, the Swiss Guards, the King's
  Household troops, the Bodyguards, Gendarmes, Light Horse, Musketeers and
  Royal Gendarmerie, representing two thousand nine hundred horse, commanded by
  the flower of the French nobility: the Marquis de Duras, Prince de Soubise,
  the Marquis de Rochefort, and Louvigny, brother of the Comte de Guiche. The
  regiments of the line consisted of forty regiments of French infantry, making
  a complement of fifty-six thousand men, and twelve regiments of foreign
  infantry, amounting to thirty thousand men; seventy-eight regiments of French
  cavalry, of which two were dragoons; and nine regiments of foreign cavalry
  amounting to twenty-five thousand horse. The field of artillery and the
  regiment of fusiliers, the siege train of ninety-seven guns, seventy-two
  thousand cannon balls, six hundred bombs, and fifteen thousand grenades,
  three pontoon trains and two floating redoubts, which could easily transport
  three thousand men each.</p>

  <p>These magnificent and formidable troops were commanded by Louis de
  Bourbon, Prince de Condé; Vicomte Turenne; François Henri de Montmorency, Duc
  de Luxembourg; the great engineer, Sebastien le Prestre de Vauban&mdash;men
  without peers in Europe. Well might Louis XIV announce the opening of the
  campaign by the scornfully arrogant sentence, "I now possess an escort which
  will allow me to take a quiet little journey into Holland."</p>

  <p>On April 6th/16th, 1672, the King of France declared war against the Dutch
  Republic; some of his courtiers thought he did too much honour to a
  Government composed of "shopkeepers and cheese-mongers." Absolutely certain
  of an immediate and brilliant victory, Louis struck a medal in which the sun,
  his emblem, was drying up a morass which represented the unfortunate
  Republic, with the motto&mdash;"I raised them from the ground but I will
  scatter them"&mdash;an allusion, presumably, to the assistance given by his
  grandfather, Henry IV, to William I of Orange in the creation of that country
  which Louis XIV was now preparing to destroy.</p>

  <p>The United Provinces found themselves attacked by three Powers at
  once&mdash;France, England and the Bishop of Münster. "It was," said Sir
  William Temple, "like a clap of thunder on a fine frosty day." It could
  scarcely have appeared as startling as this to anyone who had been watching
  the politics of Europe for the last year, for the storm, though sudden, had
  not been without portents.</p>

  <p>Charles II, as John de Witt declared bitterly to his brother, "threw aside
  the mask," and began the war more like a robber than a king by an attack on
  the Dutch India Fleet, which carried a cargo valued at seven hundred and
  fifty thousand florins&mdash;a luscious bait for the impecunious Stewart
  monarch, dependent on a niggardly and suspicious parliament and French
  pensions never lavish enough for his extravagances. The Dutch convoy and
  escort was attacked near the Isle of Wight, but the Dutch contrived to
  repulse three assaults, during the last of which the valiant Captain Van Nes'
  ship was forced to surrender after the death of her commander. The English
  navy only captured three ships, while the rich prize escaped; the English
  nation felt themselves disgraced by this act on the part of their perfidious
  King. Even Louis XIV declared that though he made war on the States General
  he would not do so "like a pirate." Charles II followed this treacherous blow
  by a declaration of war, March 27th/April 6th, 1672, excusing himself in the
  eyes of his own people and the world at large by a manifesto full of vague
  and frivolous accusations against the States General who, he declared, "had
  sought every opportunity to annoy and injure him."</p>

  <p>The conduct of the States General at this juncture contrasted nobly with
  that of the King of England. Notwithstanding the bad faith of the English
  Government, the State of Holland represented to the States General that by
  the terms of the Treaty of Breda the Republic and England were to have six
  clear months for the purpose of removing their merchandise. All the English
  ships in Dutch ports had liberty to withdraw. The odious behaviour of Charles
  Stewart became more glaring in contrast to the strict honesty of this
  decision. The Bishop of Münster and the Elector of Cologne immediately made
  common cause with the enemies of the Republic, who appeared to be as
  unscrupulous as they were powerful. Thus, hemmed in on every side and with
  little hope of being able to maintain even their existence, much less their
  honour and prosperity, in face of such a combination, the States General
  ordered a day of fasting and prayer, fixed for the first Wednesday in every
  month. They did not yet know where the main blow would be struck. De Groot,
  who had now left Paris, had been unable to gather any particulars of the
  proposed plans of the King of France, which were kept a profound secret. Some
  thought that the army of the French would go to Maastricht, others that it
  would march to the Rhine; some considered that the chief design would be to
  occupy the line of the Yssel, and take possession of Arnhem, and so pass into
  the heart of the country. De Groot believed the King had no intention of
  carrying on a long war, but would merely try to acquire glory and renown by
  summoning the first fortresses to surrender. The States General turned all
  their attention to fortifying Maastricht and the towns on the Rhine. The
  Rhyngrave was prepared to defend Maastricht to the last extremity, and the
  Prince of Orange sent the stern old soldier an encouraging message.</p>

  <p>This general was indeed so aged that the Governor of the Spanish
  Netherlands, Don Juan Domingo Zuniga y Fonseca, Count de Monterey, would have
  preferred a younger commander; the Rhyngrave had under him eight thousand
  four hundred men and one thousand Spanish cavalry, sent from Flanders;
  Maastricht was the key to the United Provinces on the south. Meanwhile the
  young Captain-General, who as yet had had no opportunity for initiative, and
  whose every movement was restricted by the deputies of the States General
  whose opinion was final, was defending the line of the Yssel; one end of this
  line was covered by fortresses which defended Overyssel and was connected
  with those of Friesland and Groningen in the north by a narrow causeway along
  the Zuyder Zee, which could, by inundation, be easily made inaccessible to
  the enemy; the other end stretched along the Rhine into the valley of the
  Waal, which was defended by the town of Nymwegen, occupied by a garrison of
  two thousand five hundred men. The line of the Yssel thus extended from the
  Zuyder Zee to the Rhine and was relied on as a barrier to protect the heart
  of the country. Prince John Maurice of Nassau-Siegen was entrusted with the
  work of fortification, which he was carrying on with the greatest vigour and
  industry. At the junction of the Yssel and the Rhine where this work stopped,
  the Prince of Orange had taken steps for opening the sluices; an inundation
  would, as one of the deputies wrote, "protect the country better than six
  thousand men." The credit for this scheme of defence belongs to John de Witt.
  It was an emergency measure, and one that was warmly seconded by the young
  Commander-in-Chief of the army. In the face of pressing and terrible danger
  these two men were working together for the common good; outwardly, at least,
  all was harmony between them; but William of Orange had no opportunity to
  show either his ability or his character, and was still a mere instrument in
  the hands of John de Witt and the deputies of the States General who
  accompanied the army; they limited his authority, circumscribed his actions,
  and still surrounded him with an atmosphere of suspicion and hostility;
  however they might appear to second him, he was well aware that he was not
  their choice and that they had used every effort to prevent him from
  attaining the position he held, as it were, in their despite.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

  <p>The young Captain-General thus found himself in a position of bewildering
  difficulty and intense anxiety. He had the nominal command of the army, but
  this was only temporary, and he was hampered by the presence of the four
  delegates from the States to whom he had to defer in everything; some of them
  were his political and, possibly, his personal enemies, and violently opposed
  to his pretensions. But what appalled the Prince more than these vexatious,
  hampering restrictions to his authority, was the state of the army which he
  had to command. The neglect of twenty years could not be repaired in a few
  weeks. In order to protect the line of defence along the Yssel, from the
  Zuyder Zee to the Rhine, a space of sixteen or twenty leagues, an army of at
  least sixty thousand men, amply provided with all war material, was
  necessary, and the ceaseless activities of Prince John Maurice of
  Nassau-Siegen in throwing up the works of fortification along this line of
  defence could not make up for the inadequacy of the troops. The army was
  without gunpowder, and almost without gun-carriages; the utmost effort had
  only procured six of these by the end of April; the dismounted artillery was,
  therefore, useless. Thirty thousand of the small army of the States General
  were distributed in the great fortresses&mdash;Maastricht, Bergen-op-Zoom,
  Nymwegen, Groningen. His Highness, therefore, was in command of a force which
  did not exceed twenty-two thousand men, fourteen thousand odd of which were
  infantry. In order to dispose these to the best advantage along his immense
  line of defence, the Prince had to divide them in <i>echelons</i> along the
  river; they were thus too widely separated to be quickly concentrated, and at
  most of the posts too few in number to repulse an attack. The Grand
  Pensionary wrote sympathetic and desperate letters to the young
  Captain-General, lamenting the lack of gunpowder, and of gun-carriages, and
  the sparsity of the troops; he did not intrigue underhand against the young
  man whom he had so long withheld from the post he now occupied, but his
  assistance, sincere though it was, was now useless. Though he kept demanding
  that fresh reinforcements should be sent more quickly to join the army,
  complained of the delays in recruiting, though he showed himself convinced
  that the small army under the command of the Prince of Orange was not strong
  enough to repel a vigorous attempt at invasion, he was powerless to remedy
  the state of affairs which twenty years of his government had brought about.
  Such troops as there were were raw levies of unwilling peasants, or slack
  militia which had been entirely neglected. On April 16th/26th, 1672, a Grand
  Council was held under the Prince at the Hague, where resolute measures were
  discussed, and by a proclamation of that month every man under sixty and
  above eighteen had to serve. Though De Witt arranged that the States of
  Holland should send the Prince of Orange fifteen companies of their
  provincial militia to the number of one thousand eight hundred, they were of
  little use.</p>

  <p>William of Orange was still surrounded by his friends of the Dutch
  nobility, the Boreels, the Zuylesteins, Odyk, La Leck, Bentinck,
  Ouwerkerk&mdash;all young nobles devoted to his person and his cause, mostly
  officers in the cavalry, ardent but without experience. He could rely on the
  wisdom and devotion of the old Prince John Maurice of Nassau-Siegen, but the
  bulk of the army was still under the command of officers chosen by John de
  Witt; men, not only incapable of performing their duties but ill-affected
  towards the new Captain-General. The Vicomte de Montbas, in particular, was
  intensely disliked by the Prince of Orange; he distrusted him and had
  protested against his appointment. His Highness himself was inexperienced. He
  knew nothing, either of war or politics, save what he had read in books and
  learnt from the conversations he had heard at the Hague. No one&mdash;not
  even his intimates&mdash;knew much about him; he had impressed every one with
  his pride and ambition, but it was not known in what direction these
  qualities would carry him. Unrevealed, restricted, untried, as he was, he yet
  inspired confidence in all who came in contact with him, but none was sure
  how much power he would eventually dispose of, nor how he would emerge from
  the terrible test to which he was about to be put. His position was in every
  way difficult; he had no political power, but was merely a servant of the
  States General, commanding their troops at a given salary and subject to
  their orders. He had, of course, no authority to treat with the enemy, nor to
  say how he wished the affairs of his country to go; he was not represented at
  any of the courts of Europe. Yet his connection with the courts of France and
  England was so close and intimate that the Republican party might with good
  cause doubt the sincerity of his loyalty to the States General. He was thus
  surrounded, as he had been surrounded all his life, by doubt, suspicion and
  hostility, and the most irksome of restraints. He wrote to Beverningh: "I am
  in great distress, dreading the approach of the enemy, and having only
  insufficient forces to oppose to him; the only means of safety is to send all
  the available forces to Yssel. You must write to the Hague without an hour's
  delay to beg that as many soldiers as possible may be sent from Maastricht,
  Bois-le-Duc, Breda, Bergen-op-Zoom, and the strong places in Flanders. I
  think also that the few horse and foot which may still be in Holland should
  be sent there. Otherwise, I see no prospect of being able to prevent the
  enemy from crossing the Yssel."</p>

  <p>In answer to this appeal the Grand Pensionary endeavoured to recall the
  five Dutch regiments that had been sent to the frontiers of the Netherlands
  to protect the Spanish provinces at the request of the Governor-General of
  the Spanish Netherlands, the Count de Monterey; this gentleman, far from the
  seat of his own government, acted throughout with decision and loyalty to the
  interests of Spain. But, like every other thing that John de Witt at this
  crisis endeavoured to bring about, this design was too late. Monterey
  despatched some Spanish horse to Maastricht and a body of cavalry to help the
  Dutch. He also consented to the departure of the Dutch regiments, declaring
  himself ready to pawn his jewels in order to provide for their pay, but this
  was useless; with the utmost goodwill on the part of the Spaniard, this
  reinforcement could not reach the Prince of Orange's line of defence in
  time.</p>

  <p>Early in the month of May, Louis XIV had joined his army at Charleroi and
  given the signal for the opening of the campaign. He had with him the Marquis
  de Louvois, his Ministers of State and of War, and the Secretary for Foreign
  Affairs, De Pomponne. His army was without question the finest and best
  equipped that had lately been gathered together in Europe. The news that came
  to the Prince of Orange with his miserable forces on the banks of the Yssel
  was that the foe opposing him amounted to three hundred thousand men. This
  muster-roll was probably exaggerated, and included all the pages, baggage,
  coachmen, carriers, pioneers and camp followers. Louis XIV, however, could
  command at least a hundred and ten thousand men&mdash;all experienced
  soldiers&mdash;and a huge artillery with an incredible quantity of provisions
  and ammunition. It took three days to transport the train and the baggage
  from Paris to Charleroi; the princes of the blood and all the nobility of
  France accompanied Louis XIV on what seemed already a triumphal progress.</p>

  <p>Christopher Bernard Van Galen, Bishop of Munster, the vigorous enemy of
  the States General, had also gathered his forces together and was preparing
  for the field. The Duke of Luxembourg was sent with six thousand men to
  reinforce the army of this ecclesiastic and the Elector of Cologne. Thirty
  thousand men were mustered in Sedan and placed under the orders of the Prince
  of Condé, eighty thousand men concentrated at Charleroi, commanded by Vicomte
  Turenne under the King's brother, the Duke of Orleans. Louis XIV did not wish
  to provoke the Spanish Court; he therefore requested the Count de Monterey's
  permission to pass through a portion of the Spanish Netherlands, which the
  Governor-General did not dare refuse. Accordingly, Louis XIV and his immense
  train advanced along the Sambre, making two halts on Spanish territory, and
  entered the bishopric of Liège, which belonged to his ally the Elector of
  Cologne. He ascended the left bank of the Maas, while the Prince of Condé,
  who had quitted Sedan, was advancing along the right bank. By the first days
  of June these two armies were ready to invest the fortresses on the Rhine,
  Orsoy, Rhynberg, Burick and Wesel. Louis wrote to Colbert that the Dutch,
  "unless they were the most wretched people in the world," should have been
  able to defend these four forts, and that he thought "it more advantageous
  for my plans and less commonplace as regards glory to attack at the same time
  four places on the Rhine and command in person at all the four sieges. I hope
  that no one will complain that I have disappointed public expectation." (The
  main purpose of forts was then to exhaust the enemy by long and costly
  sieges.)</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>These were the vainglorious words, yet words not without a certain
  grandeur, of a man who felt that the eyes of Europe were fixed upon him and
  his exploits. Three fortresses were immediately surrendered, though capable
  of some defence, governors and garrisons showed no spirit whatever but humbly
  submitted at once to the triumphant King of France. The Governor of Burick
  made some resistance, and was complimented by Turenne on the energy of his
  defence. It was, however, useless. The cowardice and even the treachery of
  these officers and troops were somewhat excused by the dilapidations of the
  ramparts, the inadequacy of the soldiery, and the lack of all material of
  war. Rhynberg surrendered without a shot being fired. Louis XIV, without any
  expenditure of blood, money, time or trouble, then found himself in
  possession of both banks of the Rhine. In nine days the States General had
  lost all the advance posts that closed the entrance to their eastern
  frontiers. Condé himself was amazed at these conquests. "It is impossible to
  see without astonishment," he wrote, "such great and happy successes in so
  short a time." The rapidity of the French advance had now revealed with
  deadly clarity the hopeless weakness of the Dutch defences.</p>

  <p>At this moment Louis XIV could have extended his conquests to the heart of
  the country, taken Amsterdam, sacked the Hague and dictated his own terms to
  what survived of the Dutch Republic; all Europe expected him to do so, and no
  one has ever given a satisfactory explanation why he did not; his
  vaingloriousness, his moral cowardice, his dislike of exertion or risk, his
  absorption in the pomps and triumphs of the moment, a fundamental lack of
  stability in his character, were perhaps some of the reasons; his well-known
  jealousy of his generals, his fear that their exploits might outshine his,
  probably made him hold them back from victories he did not care to undertake
  himself; considering the general situation, the strength of France and the
  weakness of the Dutch, the opening campaign of this inglorious attack did not
  show much ability on the part of Louis XIV and his advisers; he lacked the
  brilliant counsels of the talented Lionne, dead that year, and those
  ministers with him, De Pomponne, Louvois, whose creation this victorious army
  was, were, no doubt, like his generals, overruled by the caprice and weakness
  of His Majesty's arrogant and autocratic mind.</p>

  <p>Condé bet a hundred thousand pistoles that he would cross the Rhine
  without the loss of a hundred men. These easy French triumphs not only
  greatly enheartened the invaders, but terribly depressed the invaded. Panic
  began to spread throughout the Netherlands, and affected the raw officers
  commanding the wretched little army on the banks of the Yssel. Beverningh
  wrote to John de Witt that "On learning the approach of the enemy the militia
  officers are seized with such a panic of terror that I myself am alarmed,
  when I think of what may be expected of them...As for the peasants, they
  point out that their month's engagement has expired and demand to be
  dismissed to save the cost of their keep," added the deputy bitterly. "It is
  impossible," he wrote again, "to describe or make anyone understand what
  discouragement and confusion exist in the town among the magistrates and
  inhabitants."</p>

  <p>"If we have lost Wesel," the Grand Pensionary himself had explained, "half
  the Republic is lost."</p>

  <p>He did not seem to take for himself or his party any blame for these sad,
  ruined fortifications, the unserviceable cannon, the decayed ramparts, the
  scanty garrisons and the spiritless officers which were the result of his
  peace policy and his nepotism. At Wesel, as soon as warning had come of the
  enemy's approach, they had begun to repair the fortifications, but the
  burghers and soldiers together could scarce raise the breastwork to the
  sufficient height. Seldom before had a nation been so drugged by prosperity
  and a long peace as so entirely to abandon any prudent means of defence.
  Despair ran like wildfire through the country; every one began to agree that
  further defence was hopeless and the only course was to obtain the best terms
  possible from the victors.</p>

  <p>The Prince of Orange had always strenuously opposed abandoning the line of
  the Yssel. He had written to De Witt: "The greatest disaster which could
  happen to the States is the passage of the Yssel by the enemy," but when he
  heard of the fall of the Rhine fortresses, he began to think that he had
  better give up the defence of the river, and called a council of war.</p>

  <p>Count Hornes was for abandoning the position, which, indeed, it seemed
  grotesque to hope to hold with such inadequate and miserable forces, which
  were not only few in number, but lax in discipline, paralysed with fear, and
  on the verge of mutiny. The military council, however, could resolve nothing
  by itself; the States Deputies decided that no resolution could be taken
  until the matter had been referred to the Military Commission of the States
  General. Thus, unable to act on his own initiative, and faced by disaster,
  the young Prince appeared to be overwhelmed. "I fear, indeed," wrote
  Beverningh, "that if he is not supported he will be reduced to some
  extremity." The States General determined to hold the line of the Yssel. "It
  is decided," as John de Witt said, "to remain on the Yssel to live or die."
  This heroic sentiment on the part of the Grand Pensionary and his constant
  reference to the justice of his cause and the help of Almighty God would have
  sounded better on the lips of a man who had taken more precaution against
  such a terrible situation as now faced his country.</p>

  <p>The Prince of Orange awaited the enemy on the Yssel, therefore, obeying
  the orders of his master, the States General, and following his own
  inclination which was always for the bold and audacious action. He expected
  to be threatened by the Bishop of Münster and the Elector of Cologne as well
  as by the French army. He was deceived. Louis XIV's movements were those
  which no one had suspected. On the right wing of his line of defence the
  Prince sent a detachment under the command of Count Montbas, who had been
  abruptly commanded to return from the Hague to the camp; His Highness
  believed that Montbas remained behind in order to keep up communications with
  the deputies of the States who were hostile to the Prince, and so to cause
  still further restrictions to be put upon his military power. Now he sent him
  to this post to hold the Betuwe on the right wing of his line of defence
  because he believed it was only one of observation and not a chief position.
  Montbas had not sufficient troops to repulse the enemy&mdash;sixteen hundred
  men for guarding six or seven fordable places along a line extending three or
  four leagues; he was hampered by double orders&mdash;the inevitable result of
  a divided authority in the camp.</p>

  <p>The States Deputies told him he was to enter Nymwegen as soon as he saw
  the French approaching by land or water; the orders of the Prince of Orange
  were that he should throw himself into Nymwegen when it was invested and
  actually attacked. Montbas demanded an explanation from the Prince of Orange,
  but received no answer, or so declared; it was maintained, however, that
  orders to hold the passage had been sent. The deputies put the matter on to
  the Prince, who was encumbered, they said, with business of all sorts; they
  added, however, that Montbas should not wait for the attack and be forced to
  retreat, but on perceiving the approach of the enemy he should throw himself
  into Nymwegen. Major-General Würtz, when inspecting the lines of defence,
  informed Montbas that he should receive five regiments of reinforcements.
  Montbas did not receive these at once, and appears to have been either
  treacherous or to have suspected the good faith of the Prince of Orange, and
  to have thought that the Captain-General wished him to be overwhelmed by the
  enemy. He therefore threw himself into Nymwegen, renouncing all idea of
  disputing the passage if any attempt was made to force it; he had sent away
  his cannon and made no entrenchments. Whether confused by contradictory
  orders, whether acting in bad faith towards the Prince of Orange, whom he
  neither liked nor trusted, and of whose towards himself he felt assured, or
  whether stricken by panic and convinced of the futility of all resistance,
  Montbas fled from Nymwegen to Arnhem, and thence to Deiren. His Highness
  expressed the greatest astonishment at seeing him and had him instantly
  arrested, while he sent Count Würtz with two regiments to defend the position
  that Montbas had just abandoned. This was, however, too late. The Prince of
  Conde and Turenne fell, early in the morning, upon that very passage, the
  Tolhuys. Würtz made a stern resistance, but was too weak in men and guns and
  the post was lost. Reinforcements (the regiment of Aylva) sent out by the
  Governor of Nymwegen, weary, over-tired with continual marching, were quickly
  routed. Condé himself was wounded in this melée, as were other French
  officers, while several nobles were killed. Tolhuys, on the Rhine, only
  furnished with three brass guns and occupied by a few soldiers armed with
  muskets, was soon taken.</p>

  <p>On June 12th/22nd the French army, under Condé, forded the Rhine, swept
  away the utmost resistance the gallant Würtz was able to make, entered the
  territory of the United Provinces (the Betuwe), like conquerors, and took
  Arnhem, which they entered before the articles of capitulation were signed.
  The exploit, received with exaggerated adulation and amazement at the time,
  was neither very heroic nor very difficult. The passage had scarcely been
  disputed. Nevertheless, it was a feat that covered the French with
  glory&mdash;something amazing, unexpected, and unique. The passage of the
  Rhine, called by Napoleon I "a fourth-rate military exploit," was skilfully
  represented to appear as a mighty feat of arms; a servile press, paid poets,
  painters, flattering courtiers combined to represent to a deluded people the
  crossing of a deep, raging river, guarded by powerful forts and a numerous
  army; in truth the only ability shown was that which selected the shallowest,
  most sluggish portion of the river where it was undefended and could scarcely
  be protected. When the Prince of Orange heard of the passage of the Rhine and
  the fall of the capital of Guelders, he wished to adopt the audacious and
  perhaps hopeless measure of hurling himself with all his forces on the
  invader, but was overruled by his officers and the deputies of the States,
  who advised an immediate retreat, for Utrecht now lay open to the enemy.
  This, indeed, seemed only prudent, since to remain on the Yssel was to risk
  the annihilation of the entire forces at the disposal of the States General.
  The Captain-General was obliged to divide his army dangerously, and this
  through influences that were not under his own control. Louvois said in one
  of his letters, "The hostile army diminishes daily as much from the state of
  alarm in which the troops are, as because each province reclaims that which
  it has paid for to be employed in its own defence," thus showing the
  essential weakness of a federal government. Because of this, the fortresses
  along the Yssel were entrusted to the regiments of Overyssel, Groningen and
  Friesland, under the command of General Aylva, the neighbouring provinces to
  which they belonged; and the Prince of Orange brought back only the regiments
  of Holland, Guelders and Utrecht; he had sent much of his artillery and
  ammunition into Deventer, Doesberg and Zutphen. It was under the walls of the
  city of Utrecht that the young Captain-General threw himself with his
  diminished, hungry and exhausted forces, not amounting now to more than nine
  thousand men. Here a final disappointment and humiliation awaited him.
  Inspired by the panic of despair, the inhabitants of Utrecht refused to allow
  the Dutch army to enter; the Prince, without food for his troops, was forced
  to camp beneath the walls; the people seized the keys of the gates from the
  magistrates, and declared that they would only open them to the King of
  France. Hearing this, the States General recalled into Holland the artillery
  and militia companies, of which the greater part were in the pay of the towns
  of that province. The Prince of Orange still wished to defend Utrecht and so
  impede the progress of the enemy. Encamped miserably in the fields, he met a
  deputation of the burghers of the town, and demanded that the fortified dykes
  should be cut, and the suburbs destroyed and burnt at once. The State of
  Utrecht immediately refusing this sacrifice, the young Captain-General wasted
  no more time on the cowardly city.</p>

  <p>Weary of the shilly-shallyings of the States General and hampered by the
  restrictions put on him by this body of civilians who had to decide on all
  his movements, the Prince of Orange took the initiative and abandoned Utrecht
  to her fate, thus saving the remnants of the army entrusted to his care,
  which now only consisted of seven imperfect regiments whose numbers did not
  exceed four or five thousand foot and five thousand horse; the whole of the
  troops at the disposal of the States General hardly amounted to twelve
  thousand men, and they had no reserves. The Prince, however, skilfully chose
  the posts which he decided to defend. On the south, Major-General Wirtz held
  Gorcum; on the north, Prince John Maurice of Nassau-Siegen was entrusted with
  the defence of the post of Muyden, which covered Amsterdam; on the centre,
  the Marquis de Louvignies, the commander of the Spanish cavalry, occupied
  Schoonhoven; on the left, Count Homes held Gouda. The central position, which
  connected all these, was held by the Prince of Orange himself at Nieuwerburg,
  between Woerden and Bodegraven. His Highness had with him the largest portion
  of the scanty troops, who were commanded under him by his ancient governor,
  Zuylestein; at these headquarters there were no more than three thousand six
  hundred men, of which one thousand four hundred were infantry; this was a
  desperate but bold and skilful arrangement, which really formed a huge camp
  with five bastions, where a last stand could be made for the independence of
  the United Provinces.</p>

  <p>It seemed, indeed, not only a last stand but a hopeless one; the disaster
  was so swift that the country was breathless with terror; a contemporary
  Dutch writer says: "The amazement, because of the breaking in of the enemy
  into the Betuwe, and of our armies retreating, was greater than I am able to
  relate, and the fleeing from all places to Amsterdam was unspeakable,
  thousands of waggons and boats daily came in, and as fast again from
  Amsterdam elsewhere; all were filled with fear and anguish."</p>

  <p>Roads, rivers and canals were choked with fugitives from the invaded parts
  of the country, with burghers saving their goods from towns about to be
  surrendered, with peasants driving cattle, with all the clamour and confusion
  of a country disorganized by a ghastly and swift disaster; bitter
  recriminations completed the national distress; the passage of the Rhine was
  ascribed to "the hellish plot of Montbas," the cowardly surrender of Utrecht
  was described as "damnable treachery," the party that had been supreme in the
  States for twenty years was fiercely blamed for the miserable downfall of the
  frontier defences; from all over the desperate country a fury of odium was
  directed towards the Loevensteyn faction; many believed that they had been
  deliberately lulled into a false security, lured on by fair words to a
  complete destruction, that John de Witt was the instrument of the King of
  France; in times of ruin no rumour is too wild to be given some credit, and
  this terrible accusation was supported by the incredible neglect of the army
  and the barrier forts, the cowardice of the garrisons composed of De Witt's
  creatures, the flight of Montbas, his known friend, and the employment of De
  Groot, Montbas's relation by marriage, on the last French embassy.</p>

  <p>With passionate anguish the distracted people looked towards the heir of
  Nassau and of the military tradition; they recalled the golden days of
  Maurice, "the great Caesar of Nassau," the "Hercules of Holland," as a
  grateful people had named him; of Frederic Henry, "the most glorious Prince
  in the world," heroes who had taken town after town, impressed the world by
  feats of arms and founded modern military science, so that all the noble
  youth of Europe were eager to serve under them; was not the mighty Turenne,
  one of their present conquerors, partly of Nassau blood and trained under
  Frederic Henry?</p>

  <p>What had become of the superb troops, the valiant officers, the great
  fortified cities, the splendid trains of artillery, the arsenals full of
  powder, the towns strongly garrisoned, the militia well trained, the cavalry
  excellently mounted, the infantry excellently equipped, that had made the
  Dutch Republic one of the foremost nations of Europe?</p>

  <p>Gone, the people told each other bitterly, with the Orange flag, with the
  colours of Nassau, with the heroic line of Princes who had battled and died
  on their behalf, and for whom they had exchanged the oligarchy of one State,
  almost of one family, the relations, the friends, the hangers-on of a burgher
  of Dordrecht!</p>

  <p>The Dutch Republic still possessed a Prince of Orange, but he had not been
  treated in a fashion to make his patriotism unquestioned, nor were his
  qualities or his sincerity known; many who had been lukewarm in his cause now
  considered him with regret and remorse, and his own friends doubted if this
  delicate youth, nurtured in seclusion, deprived of all hope of power, not
  trained to arms, could possibly support the burden thrust on him; it was
  considered extraordinary that his strength had been able to endure the
  strain, the fatigue, the discomforts of the encampment on the Yssel, the
  miseries of the retreat, the disorders of the falling back on Utrecht; he had
  in no way spared himself, he had laboured to restore discipline, to encourage
  the disheartened, raw troops, to inspect his posts, he was hours in the
  saddle riding here and there, endeavouring to undertake everything himself,
  writing, dictating innumerable letters, struggling to obtain stores,
  ammunition, guns, gun-carriages&mdash;in brief, to carry on a war without an
  army, and to put in a state of defence a country overwhelmed and partially
  conquered.</p>

  <p>Despite these utmost efforts, he had been beaten without being able to
  struggle; defeated, he was in full retreat before the enemy, forced to fall
  back on the last line of defence; a Dutch city had shut her gates in his
  face; his pretensions, his endeavours would be only matter of amusement to
  the French, a mere matter of light comment between their <i>Te Deums</i> and
  mutual panegyrics&mdash;"<i>ce petit seigneur de Brèda</i>," smiled Louis
  XIV, not without kindliness; though he had tried to despoil this young
  kinsman of the city of Orange, the French monarch was disposed to be gracious
  enough to a member of his family so ruined as the Prince of Orange; he had
  agreed, good humouredly, to Charles Stewart's design to give some fragment of
  the conquered territory to the Prince who had been so insolently treated by
  the republicans it was his intention to annihilate.</p>

  <p>The Prince of Orange could not fail to be aware of the amiable feelings of
  these two kings towards himself, but was, nevertheless, overcome by distress;
  when the Rhine fortresses fell, when Utrecht refused to make a stand, when he
  was swept back, with his depleted, divided forces, his anguish had been noted
  by his intimates; Beveningh had feared he would be reduced to
  despair&mdash;to "some extremity "; there had been, however, no faltering in
  his outward composure.</p>

  <p>It is from this period, June 1672, which dates the earliest of that long
  series of letters in which the Prince of Orange, during his short life so
  crowded with constant action and high events, concisely and clearly revealed
  his unshakable fortitude, his flaming ardour, his extraordinary ability, the
  generosity, simplicity and honesty of his character; it has been well
  remarked that an exhaustive search into all his varied correspondence reveals
  nothing but honour; most of these letters of 1672 were addressed to Prince
  John Maurice of Nassau-Siegen, then holding Muyden, the key to Amsterdam, and
  were written from the camp at Bodegraven or Dieren, the Prince's hunting
  lodge, which came in the line of defence; this correspondence contains no
  reference to politics, no complaints as to the state of military affairs,
  nothing but a stern exchange of necessary news and orders; the general of
  seventy-two accepted without question or surprise the commands of his kinsman
  of twenty-one, and reveals himself in these letters as the more impetuous and
  lively of the two; complete respect, affection and loyalty existed between
  these two Princes of the House of Nassau, each of them born soldiers.</p>

  <p>The day before Louis XIV's triumphant entry into Utrecht, June 22,
  <i>o.s.</i>, Prince John Maurice wrote him from Muyden: "Monsieur, I find
  myself in the greatest perplexity in the world, having only a regiment of
  five hundred men to defend places three hours apart from each other; Muyden
  itself requires the regiments, and being still without balls or any
  ammunition, though I have several times demanded some from these
  "<i>Messieurs d'Amsterdam</i>," but in vain; when one tries to lead the
  troops against the enemy who may show themselves at any moment, the soldiers
  cry out loud, 'We have no powder or matches!' I was allowed to hope for five
  or six hundred peasants for the works, I have not one; all fled in the night,
  so that I have not been able to make the least entrenchments, if we are
  attacked we shall have to use our swords..." And, the next day, "<i>Messieurs
  d'Amsterdam</i> have at last sent me a thousand pounds of powder, matches and
  '<i>pales</i>,' six pieces of cannon of 4 and 3 lines, very good to fire
  salutes with, without carriages or balls or any of the other necessities
  required. I firmly believe that the design is that I should perish here...At
  Korte-Hoever-seume I have ordered them to cut the dykes, but more than a
  hundred armed peasants have opposed this..."</p>

  <p>On June 25, <i>o.s.</i>, Prince John Maurice wrote that the enemy, then
  occupying Utrecht, were very near his quarters, that he had asked Amsterdam
  for a few "Jaghts" by which to bring provisions across the water, but in
  vain; also that the inundations were closing round the camp, and that the now
  useless cavalry, refusing to serve on foot, had demanded leave to retire into
  North Holland. This subject is continued in the next letter, on the following
  day, in which the old general praises the services of the Spanish cavalry
  under M. de Waldenbourg and M. de Fienne; these good soldiers, however, had
  been prevented from cutting the dykes, etc., by the intimidated or
  treacherous inhabitants&mdash;as resistance, in these circumstances, seems
  useless, what does His Highness command? His Highness's reply is from
  Bodegraven&mdash;"Excuse me if I have not written before, I have had so much
  to do you would not believe it." Count Stirum will send all news, Prince John
  Maurice is to do as he thinks <i>à propos</i>, and the Captain-General is
  "<i>toute ma vie, avec beaucoup de passion, Monsieur, vostre tres-affectionné
  cousin et serviteur. G. Prince d'Orange</i>."</p>

  <p>A quickly-following letter deals with the question of the rebellious
  cavalry:</p>

  <p>"I am very astonished to learn that your cavalry make any difficulty about
  dismounting; the greater part that I have here, I have armed with muskets and
  guns and expect them to serve as infantry; if yours make any objection to the
  same course, they must be forced to obey."</p>

  <p>The next letters from Prince John Maurice reveal affairs going from bad to
  worse; the armed peasants were fighting his men, disgusted with the work
  expected of them, the soldiers were slipping away at night, the forced levees
  were melting, the men escaping to their native villages; Amsterdam was
  behaving disgracefully, never could he have believed that they would have
  sent so little assistance&mdash;"I give Your Highness these details that you
  may not impute these faults to my negligence."</p>

  <p>The conduct of Amsterdam towards the Nassau Prince was indeed
  extraordinary; when it was decided to cut a dyke that would flood the last
  pastures and return the useless Spanish cavalry to the inner lines,
  "<i>Messieurs d'Amsterdam</i>" declared "<i>hautement</i>" that they would
  not allow this cavalry to pass through the city; there was no other way by
  which the horses, that could no longer be fed, could be saved; the
  alternative was to destroy them; these letters, so clear, direct and simple,
  throw a stern light on the almost hopeless state of affairs and the
  resolution with which the Nassau Princes confronted a terrible situation; a
  tension that was becoming unbearable was slightly relieved by news from
  Admiral de Ruyter; for the fleets of the great maritime nations had come to
  grips in Solebay, May 28th/June 7th, 1672.</p>

  <p>While the Prince of Orange was encamped at Bodegraven waiting for the
  advance of the French, he heard the news of the battle of Southwold Bay,
  which had been on the whole successful for the Republic, and in which
  Cornelius de Witt, brother of the Grand Pensionary, had distinguished himself
  by "his great valour, diligent solicitude and manly courage," as Gaspard
  Fagel said. Though the Dutch lost heavily in this engagement, and the English
  claimed a victory, it had at least relieved the Republic from the fear of
  invasion from the sea. Both the two great seafaring nations had behaved
  themselves with equal skill, boldness and vigilance on this occasion. The
  English Admiral, the Duke of York, the Earl of Sandwich, Vice-Admiral
  Montague, distinguished themselves equally with the Dutch heroes, Van Gent,
  De Ruyter, Van Brakel, Sweers and Van de Ryn. Despite this partial success,
  however, the Republic appeared in the eyes of all her subjects to be about to
  be ruined for ever.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

  <p>All the young Captain-General could do he had done&mdash;that was, to
  throw himself with his inadequate and miserable troops into a posture of
  defence in an endeavour to preserve the heart of the country. He could not
  prevent the King of France from advancing to the very frontiers of Holland,
  or the Elector of Cologne and the Bishop of Münster from easily seizing upon
  Overyssel, where the towns, either wild with terror or pierced by treachery,
  fell without the least resistance. Groll, Deventer and Zwolle surrendered at
  once, although capable of making a considerable defence. Overyssel was
  instantly parcelled out between the French and the Bishop of Münster, who
  quarrelled with each other in the process. Arnhem had surrendered to Turenne
  after only one shot fired. Doesburg and Zutphen fell to the French without
  any difficulty. On June 23rd/July 3rd, Louiss XIV took possession of Utrecht,
  garrisoned it with French troops and established his headquarters at the
  Castle of Zeyst, the property of William Adrian of Nassau, Lord of Odyck. It
  seemed to all as if it were now hopeless to offer any resistance whatever to
  this overwhelming conqueror. The country was almost lost; not only cities and
  forts, but whole provinces had given themselves up to the enemy. It was said
  that if five thousand horse had gone to the gates of Amsterdam the city would
  have fallen into the enemy's hands, so great a terror had seized on all; the
  governors were void of counsel, the magistrates disputing whether they should
  quit or endeavour to defend themselves, many pretending that this was
  impossible, they not being provided with necessities, and declaring that the
  only expedient was to advance at once and offer their keys to the King of
  France.</p>

  <p>By the end of June, terror, confusion, astonishment and panic had spread
  through the land from one end to the other; in three weeks Louis had become
  master of twenty-five fortified towns and forts; the Dutch knew not where to
  look for succour; they had no longer any hope of detaching the English from
  their perfidious alliance, for when Louis XIV made his triumphant entry into
  Utrecht he was accompanied by the popular and pampered James, Duke of
  Monmouth, the natural son of Charles II, who had brought an English regiment
  with him, not so much to assist the French as to show that Charles II gave
  them his countenance. Leaving the Duke of Luxembourg as Governor in Utrecht,
  Louis XIV, with his splendid and pretentious court, returned to Zeyst, and
  prepared to dictate the terms on which he was disposed to spare the remaining
  provinces, for these were indeed nothing but remnants. Guelders, Utrecht and
  Overyssel were in his power. Friesland and Groningen were isolated in the far
  north, but could not long escape the same fate. Zeeland was surrounded and
  Holland was defended only by the scanty army of the Prince of Orange and rent
  by internal dissension. Even the wealthy city of Amsterdam, which considered
  herself as a little republic, was so far filled with terror that the Jews
  implored Gourville, then in the employ of the Prince of Condé, to offer his
  master two million <i>livres</i> if he would spare their quarters when the
  city was taken and given over to pillage. Financial affairs sank into a
  turmoil; provincial bonds which had been at a premium of a 100 per cent. were
  now with difficulty sold at 30 per cent.; the shares of the East India
  Company had dropped to less than half their former value; wealthy,
  prosperous, safe people saw themselves ruined in a flash. Paper which had
  been worth 5 per cent. more than coin was now worth 5 per cent. less; all
  wished to sell, none to buy; solid valuables were hastily concealed.
  Academies, schools, theatres, shops and the courts of justice were closed; an
  idle, panic-stricken populace gathered in the streets to curse the
  Government. A contemporary author says, "that the Government had no plan, the
  people no tongue, and the country no hope." The only activity shown by anyone
  was an activity in accusing each other of treachery, weakness and cowardice.
  Discouragement was universal, and could scarcely have been deeper. The
  messengers who came up from the four posts defending Holland under the Prince
  of Orange at Bodegraven brought nothing but ill-tidings. The young
  Captain-General continued to learn from Prince John Maurice that the peasants
  he had sent him to employ on the fortifications had fled during the night,
  that the soldiers refused to work with the spade and shovel, and that he was
  unable to punish lack of discipline. The cold General wrote to the young
  Prince: "If we do not have more powder and shot we shall certainly be
  butchered, and unless we have reinforcements will have no cause for surprise
  if our necks are broken."</p>

  <p>John de Witt was utterly unable to cope with the situation which his
  persistent policy had brought about. "We shall be the cause of our own ruin,"
  he declared in despair, "because we do ourselves more harm than the enemy
  have done us, and if the matter be not looked to we shall be left without
  hope or remedy." He could suggest nothing except a good and speedy
  accommodation with the enemy&mdash;a suggestion that lent colour to the
  sinister reports against his good faith. All defence seemed
  hopeless&mdash;what other course could any statesman suggest? The steady,
  unchecked advance of the enemy was not the only thing which John de Witt had
  to fear, even worse were the internal tumults in what remained of the
  country. People had seen forts and towns fall with a shot into the hands of
  the enemy, their captains surrender, their armies in flight, their land
  devastated, a conqueror installed in their midst. Magistrates, paralysed by
  terror, could find no good answer to the furious demands of the outraged
  people as to why they had not been better defended? The party that had been
  excluded from any share of the government during the last twenty years, and
  the party that never had had any share in the government (that is, the clergy
  and peasantry), began to declare themselves betrayed&mdash;the inevitable
  result of a minority rule when the majority which has been forced against its
  will finds that it has lost everything through the pursuit of a policy in
  which it never believed, and in which it had been forced unwillingly to
  acquiesce. Riots broke out in all the towns as the climax and culmination of
  all those disorders which had been seething and with difficulty kept under
  since 1650. People began to tell each other, with all the passion of despair,
  that this year, 1672, was the justification of that of 1650, and that the
  young Stadtholder who had forfeited his son's heritage by insisting on a
  large standing army had been absolutely right, that a powerful military
  aristocracy and a commanding Prince were the only means of facing the present
  state of affairs in Europe; that no country, even a republic, should be
  governed by burghers, magistrates and lawyers; and that a jealousy of
  military power that went so far to weaken entirely the defences of the
  country was in itself an act of betrayal and treachery. It was pointed out
  that, believing they had nothing to fear but the power of the House of
  Nassau, the De Witt party had disbanded most of their veteran troops and
  experienced officers whom they had looked upon as wholly devoted to the
  Prince of Orange, at the same time giving the greatest posts in their army
  and garrisons to the sons of burgomasters and deputies who had never seen a
  battle, who had delivered whole cities, with garrisons with five hundred foot
  and eight hundred horse, without discharging one gun.</p>

  <p>The States now being reduced to a condition of despair took the only
  course that was open to them in defence of what remained of their country,
  that was&mdash;inundation. By opening the sluices and cutting the dykes the
  country would be inaccessible except by the high causeways, which could be
  easily destroyed or defended. When the country was inundated Holland would be
  in a circle of entrenchments. This resolution seemed to be indeed but
  choosing one form of ruin instead of another&mdash;to flood the country would
  be to undo the labour of generations, destroy meadows, crops, rich country
  houses, exotic gardens, handsome estates, parks, farms; in short, the whole
  wealth of the country. The great city of Amsterdam set the example of heroic
  sacrifice; not, however, without dispute and reluctance. On June 15th/25th
  the inundations commenced. On the 20th/30th they were completed. Prince John
  Maurice's engineers, soldiers and Spanish allies worked hard at opening the
  sluices and cutting the dykes, this, despite the resistance of many of the
  wretched inhabitants who could not endure to see their fields sacrificed to
  the devastation of the waters. John de Witt wrote to his brother that in many
  districts the work was only carried on by force; the letters of Prince John
  Maurice tell the same tale. The country round Holland was, however,
  completely submerged; all the parts below the level of the sea were under
  several feet of water, which added to the misery and discomfort of the army
  of defence. Meanwhile, the Prince of Orange, who could do nothing but hold
  his post at Bodegraven and the <i>water linie</i>, was making the most
  vigorous and diligent efforts for the re-disciplining of the army. He caused
  proceedings to be taken against Montbas and arrested Colonel Daniel Doffory,
  the commandant of Rhynberg, taking also the sternest measures with all
  officers who had shown the least weakness, hesitation or cowardice. For a
  general of twenty-one years, utterly inexperienced, and placed in command in
  a moment of national crisis, to endeavour to reorganize, in the face of the
  enemy, the discontented, undisciplined and panic-stricken troops, seemed
  indeed a huge task, but it was one which William of Orange undertook.
  Contemporary writers bear witness to the appalling conditions of the armies
  of the States. The Marquis de Saint Maurice, the Envoy of the Duke of Savoy
  to Louis XIV, who accompanied him in company with the other diplomats on this
  campaign, noted: "Nor had there been seen worse troops than those of the
  States General; they attribute this to the Pensionary De Witt, who preferred
  his interest to those of the public. He had been forced to permit the Prince
  of Orange being made Captain-General of their troops, but before this Prince
  had any power De Witt had ruined the army; he had given the commands to his
  friends and creatures in each province and in each town&mdash;people without
  any experience and who were frightened immediately they saw the enemy, who
  caused panic among the soldiers and instantly surrendered themselves
  prisoners, as one can see. We have counted nearly twenty thousand prisoners
  in the places taken by the King, by Monsieur le Prince, Monsieur Turenne and
  the Bishop of Münster. This last has taken twenty-two thousand crowns and
  four thousand men that he has found in Deventer." Such was the severe view
  taken by an onlooker and a neutral of the conduct of John de Witt, and though
  it appears harsh when the high-minded character of the Grand Pensionary is
  taken into consideration, it is no doubt just; even at the last moment he had
  wasted valuable time, which might have been used in levying troops, in
  fortifying outposts, by prolonged disputes as to the Captain-Generalship and
  by strenuous efforts to limit the authority of the Prince of Orange. Even the
  picked Scotch regiments, long in the pay of the States General, had fallen
  into decay and neglect, and William had expressed himself as astonished at
  their lack of courage and spirit. This was explained by the fact that their
  old officers had been taken from them, and that they had been put under raw
  and inefficient men, who had destroyed their spirit and discipline.</p>

  <p>In sharp contrast to the panic of the States, the Prince made stern
  efforts to improve this desperate state of affairs. All the officers
  belonging to the regiments who had surrendered the strong places on the Rhine
  were court-martialled. Cavalry regiments were obliged to perform the services
  of foot soldiers, hasty levies filled up gaps in the army; and the population
  was compelled to join the army by a forced levy of one man in every two. The
  garrison of Maastricht was summoned to help, but they could not now make
  their way out of the blockaded fortress. The troops of Guelders and Utrecht
  were taken into the service of the States of Holland; they could no longer
  obtain their pay from their invaded and lost provinces. Marines and gunners
  were brought on shore and sent to serve in the army, sailors and burghers
  were detailed to guard the coasts on the North Sea and Zuyder Zee. A number
  of sloops armed with guns lay across the mouths of the rivers, and protected
  the line of defence resting on the Maas, the Waal, the Leck, the Amstel and
  the Zuyder Zee, thus preventing any possible attempt on the part of the enemy
  to advance over the waters that inundated the country. An armed flotilla
  occupied the gulf of the Y, and Amsterdam was believed to be impregnable. All
  these energetic measures were carried through with rapidity and skill; the
  Prince of Orange inspired the States General, who were heartened by his
  example and alarmed by the hostile attitude of the people.</p>

  <p>Some encouragement was afforded in the general despair by the gallant
  defence of Aardenburg, which the French, under Count Chamilly, attacked as
  the first attempt at conquering Zeeland. The town, however, showed the
  ancient valiant Dutch spirit. Men, women and children helped the little
  garrison to defend the bastions. After two hours of ferocious assault the
  French were forced to retire with heavy losses; while the gallant captain of
  a Zeeland ship landed two hundred of his crew and attacked the enemy in the
  rear. The result was a decided victory. The French retreated on Ath. This
  success raised the courage not only of Zeeland but of the whole country. It
  proved that the French were not always invincible or the Dutch always beaten
  without any difficulty. Louis XIV and his ministers, confident of the most
  brilliant and rapid success, had been surprised and vexed by the inundations
  which had transformed Holland into an island. Louvois had written: "His
  Majesty will be able in eight days to send troops to pillage the Hague." He
  was now considerably disconcerted. The French found it difficult to forgive
  the audacity of the Prince of Orange and the States of Holland for this
  extreme measure. "If they had not made use of an element as uncivil as
  themselves," one of them haughtily declared, "there is every likelihood that
  by this time they would have been under the yoke. The obstinate fury of this
  rabble may be recognized chiefly in the fact that though they perceive that
  God is punishing them, instead of humbling themselves they become more
  exasperating, and prefer to ruin and destroy their country and their subjects
  and to expose themselves to the danger of being drowned rather than submit to
  a glorious and triumphant conqueror." Louis XIV himself, however, whose words
  and actions never lacked a certain grandeur, paid tribute to the courage of
  the Dutch who had resolved on so extreme an expedient. "What would one not
  do," he afterwards wrote, "to save oneself from foreign domination?"</p>

  <p>Meanwhile these startling victories, these sweeping conquests on the part
  of the already arrogant French, began to alarm Europe. Sweden and Denmark
  feared that England, as ally of the conqueror, would thus find herself
  mistress of all their Northern commerce. Even Spain, decayed and imbecile as
  she was, in the hopes of saving what remained to her of the Spanish
  Netherlands, sent immediate assistance to the Dutch; she had already placed
  at the disposal of the States General such troops as she had in the Spanish
  provinces; and these had proved of far more value than the degenerate native
  soldiers; she now promised to send further reinforcements, and had ordered
  thirty-five galleys and forty ships of war; and Baron Lisola, the Emperor
  Leopold's Minister at the Hague, always the open enemy of Louis XIV, now
  proved of the greatest service to the distressed States General. He never
  ceased to point out to his master the vast danger which threatened his power
  through the aggressions of Louis XIV and to urge on him to send, despite his
  treaty of neutrality, powerful aid to the Dutch, who might be considered the
  ramparts and outposts of the Empire, protecting as they did the whole of
  Germany.</p>

  <p>The King of France's alliance with the Bishop of Münster and the Elector
  of Cologne might also be looked upon as highly dangerous to the Emperor.
  There was believed to be no limit to the ambitions of Louis XIV, who was even
  suspected of intending to have himself elected King of the Romans, or future
  Emperor; there was talk of a diamond rose and a sword hilt which he had had
  made for the ceremony of his coronation. Lisola declared in one of his
  memoranda that "the only consideration for Vienna is whether war is preferred
  in the Empire single-handed, or on the Rhine with the alliance of Spain and
  the United Provinces."</p>

  <p>Not only was the Emperor alarmed by all this, but the German princes,
  though enjoying French bribes, were beginning to be anxious for their
  independence. The Elector of Saxony, John George II, though he was in the pay
  of Louis XIV, was secretly negotiating with the States General for the loan
  of a hundred thousand crowns as the price of his assistance, while his sons
  were openly raising troops for the Dutch. Frederic William, the Elector of
  Brandenburg, who had pledged himself by a recently concluded treaty to come
  to the assistance of the Provinces with a force of twenty thousand men, had
  been kept to this by the devoted energy of Godard Van Reed; Lord of
  Amerongen, who still represented the Dutch at the Court of Berlin. This
  earnest and energetic patriot had lost all his estates, and his fortune,
  through the inundations, to which disaster he had submitted with heroic
  resignation. The Elector of Brandenburg was further moved to feel in a
  friendly fashion towards the States by the recent election of his nephew the
  Prince of Orange to the Captain-Generalship; while the occupation of the
  Rhine fortresses by the French placed them far too near his own Duchy of
  Cleves. He therefore used the most zealous efforts to secure the intervention
  of the Emperor, and sent his brother-in-law (the Prince of Anhalt, who had
  married the second daughter of Prince Frederic Henry) to Vienna for this
  purpose. Despite the adroit manceuvres of the French envoy a treaty was
  concluded between Leopold and the Elector of Brandenburg, by which they were
  to assist the United Provinces and each put into the field twelve thousand
  men before the end of July&mdash;all to be under the command of Frederic
  William of Hohenzollern. This Treaty also enabled the Elector of Brandenburg
  to send the twenty thousand men that he had promised to assist the Dutch.</p>

  <p>De Witt, however, did not seem to be greatly heartened either by the
  inundations or by this foreign assistance. He declared the United Provinces
  to be lost, and told the foreign ministers that the Province of Holland would
  be obliged to capitulate, and they must endeavour to obtain from the King of
  France the best possible guarantees for their religion and their freedom
  without any consideration for the neighbouring States and Sovereigns. Whether
  he gave utterance to this opinion of despair in order to hasten foreign help
  and inspire the people with a desire to resist, or whether it was his sincere
  opinion, his attitude was not that which his country required in this
  desperate misfortune, or which could provoke anything but hostility from the
  majority of his frantic and embittered countrymen, who accused him, not only
  of betraying them by his negligence, but of giving way to an unmanly panic.
  It began to be even more hotly murmured that he had sold his country to the
  King of France; and rage against him and his party increased as every day
  brought in another tale of loss, ruin, riot or alarm.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

  <p>Showing, if not feeling, a profound discouragement, the Grand Pensionary
  persuaded Gaspard Fagel, the second person of importance in the States, to
  send an embassy of submission to the victorious King of France, declaring
  that he saw no other means of preserving what remained of the Republic.
  Gaspard Fagel had replied at first with indignant courage, declaring that the
  Republic had already been reduced to greater extremities, and that "if God
  had saved her from Philip II he would from Louis XIV, if only the people
  would help themselves by taking the necessary measures to check the enemy."
  In pursuance of this policy of John de Witt, Everard Van Weede, Lord of
  Dyckveldt, was sent to Whitehall to endeavour to win round Charles II to a
  policy of mediation or neutrality, by putting before him the interests of the
  Protestant religion and those of his nephew the Prince of Orange; but John de
  Witt could not know that this mission had no chance of success.
  Plenipotentiaries were sent to the King of France&mdash;John Van Gent and
  Pieter de Groot were two principal members of the deputation; both were
  obnoxious to the Prince of Orange, one of them was his detested former
  governor, and the other one of the leaders of the Republican party, John de
  Witt's greatest confidant, also a relation to Montbas, then under arrest for
  abandoning the post at Tolhuys. Not only the young Prince of Orange but a
  great many of his followers and the common people suspected all these men,
  not only of lukewarm interest in their country, but even of deliberately
  selling her to the French. Montbas was a Frenchman and at least suspected of
  treachery, whilst De Groot and Van Gent were known to be hostile to the
  Prince of Orange, in whose person all the hopes of the people were centred.
  John de Witt endeavoured to soften the bad effect made by this injudiciously
  chosen embassy by adding to it William Adrian of Nassau, Lord of Odyck, the
  Prince's deputy as premier noble of Zeeland. To the humble solicitations of
  these deputies of the States General Louis XIV proved himself as haughty and
  unreasonable as might have been expected. He offered terms such as no people
  with any spark of courage or vestige of hope left could have accepted.
  Negotiations dragged on for a month, Louis threatening that if the
  inundations prevented him from completing his conquests in the summer he had
  only to wait until the winter and cross the waters when they were frozen; he
  not only demanded towns, portions of territory, huge monetary compensation,
  but the most humiliating conditions, one of which was that the States should
  every year send him a gold medal on which would be an inscription declaring
  that they only existed by reason of his clemency. The deputies and the States
  General were alike reduced to helpless despair. The downfall of the Republic
  seemed as inevitable as incredible. It was only four years ago that she had
  been able to force this same king to listen to her mediations at the time of
  the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. Now she appeared utterly ruined.</p>

  <p>When the truth of the terms offered by the King of France leaked out, the
  riots and tumults in the interior of the country became even more violent;
  the military reinforcements coming up from Vienna and the Elector of
  Brandenburg had not arrived; the Prince of Orange could do no more than just
  hold his post at Bodegraven and the <i>water linie</i>; while these bitter
  and humiliating negotiations were taking place with Louis XIV, popular fury
  had risen to such a height that some unfortunate enthusiastic youths, blown
  with wine and patriotism, had made an attack on John de Witt in the Hague,
  only, however, slightly wounding the Grand Pensionary. One of the assassins,
  a youth named Jacob Van der Graef, the son of honourable people, and
  obviously inspired by a mistaken passion of patriotism, was arrested, tried
  and condemned to be executed. It would have been politic as well as generous
  on the part of the Grand Pensionary if he had pardoned or endeavoured to have
  obtained the pardon of the poor youth, who had only attempted to play the
  part of Brutus, and who appears to have been honestly fanatical in his wish
  to rid the country of a man whom he regarded as a traitor to her liberties
  and her freedom. He died bravely, though his execution was miserably bungled,
  and his youth and sincerity, the respectability of his parents and the fact
  that his accomplices had all escaped, roused popular sympathy on his behalf.
  The execution of Buat in somewhat similar circumstances was recalled, and
  John de Witt, who had been steadily calumniated and abused since the war
  broke out, was accused of hardness and even cruelty, of a vindictive desire
  to repress grimly, under every excuse, the partisans of the House of Nassau.
  He had been appealed to for pity and had coldly replied: "Let justice take
  its course." The rabble at the Hague were, with difficulty, restrained from
  rescuing the young man from the scaffold. The three other accomplices of
  Jacob Van der Graef fled to the camp at Bodegraven, where they remained
  hidden, secretly protected, as the Republicans declared, by the Prince of
  Orange. At the same time attacks were made on Cornelius de Witt, who had
  recently returned from the fleet; on every hand were signs of a rising storm
  which would not be satisfied until it had destroyed both the brothers and all
  their party. The air was full of rumours, of false accusations, of exciting
  statements, of slanders and lies. Reports were spread of attempts on the life
  of the Prince of Orange, and these lashed his party into irresistible
  excesses. At Ter Veere (his marquisate) the citizens rose and demanded his
  restoration to the full honours of his ancestors. All over the country the
  people, irritated to frenzy by the failure of their government to protect
  them, by the almost incredible disaster which had overtaken them, by the
  stinging insolence of the terms put forward by the conqueror, demanded the
  restoration of the Prince of Orange to the Stadtholdership as the only
  possible remedy for their desperate straits. Confident in his blood, his
  name, his character, they looked to him for deliverance. He had all the
  prestige and glory of his ancestors, of the' noblest descent in Europe, all
  the attractions of youth, pride and courage. He was opposed by the party who
  were blamed for the ruin of the Republic; he was known to be against those
  who were now pursuing what the people considered disgraceful negotiations
  with Louis XIV; his advice had always been for resistance and defiance. No
  one could accuse him of any share in the disaster of the moment, he had had
  no real authority, and the people deeply resented the restrictions laid on
  him. He himself afterwards declared haughtily that, "those who held the reins
  of government restricted to such narrow limits the dignities which by special
  favour they were good enough to leave to us that we were incapable of
  rendering any service."</p>

  <p>Hemmed in, restricted and defeated as he was, without any political and
  very little real military power, put into such a hopeless situation and told
  to defend a country with such inadequate and miserable means, His Highness
  had yet impressed all those who came in contact with him, with all those who
  heard accounts of him, with a sense of confidence. Although he had been able
  to do little but prepare to sell as dearly as possible what was left of the
  country, it was obvious that he was a born leader of men. He could make
  himself, young as he was, instantly obeyed and instantly respected. His
  stately reserve, his immovable composure, and the known fact that his
  opinions would never be altered, the cool and authoritative manner in which
  he issued his commands, all gave him an immense weight among both the
  councils, the officers and the ranks of the troops. The active and energetic
  measures that he was taking for the reformation of his wretched forces were
  the admiration of all. He appeared as the lodestar for the fainting hopes of
  the Dutch, the one focus round which they might rally. Both by reason of his
  birth and his personality he seemed ordained for the heroic position of
  saviour of his country. His party now claimed for him the command as
  Captain-General for life, together with the restoration of the
  Stadtholdership. The misfortune of the war was laid to the charge of those
  who had limited the young Captain-General's authority; the insufficient
  powers that he possessed were supposed to be the cause of the situation in
  which the Republic now found herself.</p>

  <p>All the passions of the people swelled into one clamour, demanding the
  restoration of the Prince of Orange to all the dignities held by those
  guardians of their liberties, his ancestors. John de Witt alone held out
  against these fierce demands hot with the implacable hatred, the scorn and
  bitterness of twenty years. In pamphlets daily scattered about the streets of
  all the towns, in the preachings daily heard from the pulpits where the
  people crowded in their anguish to seek spiritual consolation, the most
  severe strictures were laid on John de Witt, the most abominable accusations
  were made against him. It was often said, and commonly believed, that he was
  the accomplice of the King of France and had sold the Republic to Louis XIV,
  preferring to see his country the prey of a foreign conqueror rather than the
  Prince of Orange should be its Governor. With sorrowful philosophy the Grand
  Pensionary surveyed the storm. "Each one attributes to himself the glory of
  success, but public misfortunes are laid to one alone," he said sadly.
  Burdened with work and ignoring his wound he toiled from morning on to night
  to do what he could for his ruined, furious country. All was too late as far
  as John de Witt was concerned; the situation was hopeless; hardly anyone
  trusted him, believed in him, or wished to listen to him; he was regarded as
  an obstacle which must at all costs be swept away. The longer he resisted the
  more furious became the opposition to him. He did what he could, which was
  his simple duty as it lay to his hand, going to and fro his house in the
  Kneuterdyck under the dark arch of the Gevangenpoort to his room in the
  Binnenhof, as had been his wont for twenty years, preserving outwardly the
  most courteous relations with the young Captain-General at Bodegraven.</p>

  <p>By an ironical circumstance the town of Dordtrecht, the birthplace of John
  de Witt, where his father Jacob had been so long burgomaster, was the first
  to give the signal for the revolution. The burghers of this important island
  city believed, rightly or wrongly, that the councillors were negotiating with
  the enemy for the surrender of Dordtrecht. They suspected, too, that the
  powder magazines were empty, and when they demanded an inspection of these
  their suspicions were confirmed by the fact that the keys could not be found.
  A crowd speedily assembled in the narrow streets of the old town, floating
  flags with orange streamers above and white below with the inscription,
  "Orange up and White under." The Burgomaster was seized and, threatened by a
  workman with hatchet in hand, surrounded by a frantic mob, bethought himself
  of a desperate expedient, that was, to send to the young Prince of Orange, at
  Bodegraven, and to desire him to come without delay to Dordtrecht. This was
  acted on because the magistrates dared not refuse the hot request of the
  people for the restoration of the Stadtholdership, nor prove themselves false
  to the Perpetual Edict to which they had conformed.</p>

  <p>A deputation waited on the Prince in his camp at Bodegraven, and told him
  of the tumults taking place in the town. The overworked young general,
  absorbed in a hundred tasks, received the deputation, but was not greatly
  impressed by what they had to say; he was well used to tumults and riots, and
  he was always contemptuous of the passions of the populace. In spite of his
  indifference the deputies declared that they dare not return without him,
  that if they did so they were "likely to be torn in pieces." At this the
  Prince, though protesting that his presence was necessary at the camp,
  consented to accompany them on their return to Dordtrecht, though
  reluctantly, for he disliked to leave the lines of defence even for a day,
  and he was tormented by the burden of many duties, many necessities.</p>

  <p>On June 19th/29th he made his entry into the dark, handsome island city.
  The inhabitants swarmed round him and conducted him to the town hall, His
  Highness walking in the middle of the crowd wearing his hat and the agitated
  magistrates following him with theirs in their hands.</p>

  <p>When he was seated in a chair of state in the town hall, and they stood
  about him in amazed agitation, he asked them sternly "if they had any
  proposal to make to him?" They said, "None." The Prince, surprised, reminded
  them that he had only come at their request to hear what they had to say. The
  magistrates still attempted to evade the issue, and asked him to visit the
  fortifications and magazines, hoping thus to quieten the crowd. His Highness,
  preserving the same reserve as the magistrates maintained, made the
  inspection. On his return the people again crowded round his carriage and
  refused to let him go. The Prince said he was contented with all he had seen,
  that the town was in a proper posture to defend itself; but this did not
  satisfy the excited people, who pushed round his carriage, threatened the
  magistrates who accompanied him, even forcing muskets against the breasts of
  some, and demanded that the Prince should instantly be restored to the
  Stadtholdership. His Highness, always disdainful of the rage of the vulgar,
  and having no wish to owe his elevation to the clamour of a rabble,
  maintained an ironic composure; never, in all his difficult life, did any
  situation arise that was able to deprive him of his self-control. He was both
  too proud and too wise to be talked into anything that was either illegal or
  that might be said to inflame the passions of the people; without showing the
  least excitement either at the embarrassment of the magistrates or the fury
  of the citizens, he entered the Peacock Inn where a repast had been prepared
  for him. The crowd, the greater number of whom were armed with pikes and
  muskets, gathered round the door of the inn, ready to massacre all who
  opposed their wish with regard to his elevation.</p>

  <p>One of the ringleaders, pushing into the room where His Highness was
  eating his dinner, cried: "Let His Highness ask for anything he pleases, we
  will see that he gets it!" The overwhelmed and terrified magistrates ordered
  the secretary of the council to draw up a resolution, "that they declared in
  the name of the town they made choice of the Prince of Orange as
  Stadtholder." When they communicated this resolution to the Prince, His
  Highness ironically reminded them that he, as well as they, was bound by oath
  to obedience to the Perpetual Edict. Two pastors, who had been among the most
  energetic of the Prince's supporters, at once offered to relieve His Highness
  of his vow, and absolved him from the solemn oath he had taken on the day of
  his election as Captain-General not to attempt the Stadtholdership while he
  held that office. Despite the formality of this action the Prince was accused
  of dissimulation by his enemies, but it is difficult to see how he could in
  this moment have acted with more dignity and honour than he did. The
  composure of his manner that showed neither excitement nor evasion, and his
  refusal to take advantage of the roused passions of the people to perform an
  illegal action, evoked to a yet further pitch the admiration already felt for
  him; the day ended in an outburst of enthusiasm and the arms of the House of
  Nassau and Orange flags were at once hoisted on the ramparts and on the town
  hall.</p>

  <p>The inhabitants of Dordtrecht, with tears of joy in their eyes, gathered
  round the Prince as if he had already delivered them from their peril; men,
  women and children shouted for this young man with touching confidence in his
  power to save them from the disasters that had already nearly overwhelmed
  them; his appearance as well as his manner had inspired the wildest hopes;
  his youthful and aristocratic charm, his air of resolution and command, the
  remarkable fire and flash of his dark eyes that belied his stately demeanour,
  his unquestioning acceptance of power, his lack of all self-consciousness and
  vanity, all seemed to fulfill the high promise of his childhood and his
  name.</p>

  <p>He had now assumed the dress that was to be his attire for many years, and
  in which his likeness, in pictures, engravings and medals, was to go all over
  Europe&mdash;the azure uniform of the Blue Guards over the buff waistcoat,
  the light armour on back and breast, the full cravat of Brussels lace, the
  orange scarf and sash, the high boots, the ribbon and jewel of the Garter,
  the fringed, braided gloves and sword belt, the broad-leaved hat with the
  falling feathers, with the other details of a fashionable gentleman's attire
  (so scrupulously kept up even in the disorder of march and encampment), the
  delicate linen, the fine ruffles, the ribbons at neck and wrists, the
  jewelled brooch and buckles, the costly watch and elegant sword.</p>

  <p>His Highness had then an air of energy and pride that allowed no one to
  notice his youth and slenderness; his features were fully developed; dark,
  aquiline, with full lips, melancholy eyes and a clear complexion, he was
  still a Stewart in looks; according to the fashion of the moment he wore his
  nearly-black hair in profuse heavy curls, carefully dressed to fall over his
  shoulders and nearly to his waist, and, like all the young officers of the
  '70's, a slight moustache, <i>à la royale</i>, a fashion set by the King of
  France.</p>

  <p>Nothing in this appearance spoke of a Dutch origin, in no particular was
  he of the national type, but more Southern, Spanish or Italian, in looks; in
  truth his swarthiness, his slenderness, the brilliancy and darkness of his
  eyes, his fastidiousness, the beauty of his hands (remarked on by his driest
  biographers), were not Dutch characteristics, and there was little enough
  Dutch blood in his veins; this did not prevent the excited people of
  Dordtrecht acclaiming him as their national hero and deliverer.</p>

  <p>The Prince showed no emotion at these manifestations, but his high,
  generous and magnanimous heart must have been moved by the display of a faith
  so touching, a hope so confident, nor could he have failed to be stirred by
  seeing, for the first time, the arms of his House publicly displayed, his
  colours openly broken against his native skies; yet this was not time for
  exultation, but, as he afterwards so passionately declared, "the hour of his
  deepest distress "; disengaging himself from the shouting affection of
  Dordtrecht, he drove rapidly back to his thin lines of defence to find a
  letter from the valiant Prince John Maurice, which he must have read with
  much relief; at last Amsterdam had roused to a sense of the importance of
  Muyden and had begged their defender to retain his post, promising all
  assistance.</p>

  <p>Cornelius de Witt, who had been invalided home from the fleet, where he
  had so distinguished himself by his gallant behaviour, was in bed disabled by
  gout when the Prince came to Dordtrecht. When it was seen that his signature
  was lacking from those of the other councillors to the resolution that
  restored the Prince to the Stadtholdership, the rabble gathered round his
  house insisting that he should sign. Cornelius de Witt displayed in this
  desperate moment for his fortunes the same obstinacy which his brother had
  always used, with such fatal effect for his own person and his own policies.
  Inflexible in his downfall, Cornelius de Witt refused to sign. Nothing could
  overcome his hostility to the House of Nassau, his dread of placing the young
  Prince in a position of unlimited power, his bitter memories of the days of
  Loevensteyn, and the tyranny, as he termed it, of William II. The state to
  which his country had been reduced by the policy of his brother, the
  necessity for a united authority in the face of an overwhelming enemy, the
  persistence of the demands of the people for the restoration of the beloved
  House of Nassau&mdash;all these did not move the cold obstinacy of Cornelius
  de Witt. He was only at weary length induced to sign by the tears of his
  wife, who rightly feared that she, he and their children might be massacred
  by the exultant rabble clamouring outside their house. When at last Cornelius
  signed, he added the letters "V.C." (<i>Vi Coactus</i>), "Constrained by
  force"; these letters, however, he was obliged to scratch out for fear of the
  rage of the people.</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>The example of Dordtrecht was speedily followed; riots, disorders, the
  hoisting of the Orange flag, and clamours for the Prince took place in
  Rotterdam, Schiedam, Haarlem, Gouda and Delft. At Rotterdam the intimidated
  magistrates were forced to send a deputation to the young Prince at
  Bodegraven, and inform him that he had been nominated as Stadtholder. His
  Highness regarded this deputation with reserve; he received the deputies
  without getting out of his carriage. He had with him Jerome Van Beverningh
  and one of the deputies of the States General, and briefly replied that he
  "accepted the office solely for the benefit of the States." All these popular
  tumults and riots in the few towns that yet remained to the States General
  amounted to a revolution. The deputies of Holland, who still represented the
  Republican party of John de Witt, found themselves powerless in the face of
  this outburst of popular enthusiasm. With the revolution inside and the
  victorious army at the gates they could do nothing but give way. The two De
  Witts, the head and front of their movement, were disabled by illness;
  Cornelius de Witt, sick with gout and chagrin at Dordtrecht, and the Grand
  Pensionary still severely disabled by the wound he had received in the
  attempt on his life at the Hague. At Amsterdam the magistrates were still
  against the House of Nassau, but the people were in favour of the young
  Prince, this despite the memory of his father's attempt on their city twenty
  years ago. Even in Amsterdam the Republican or peace party, as they were now
  called, or Loevensteyn cabal and De Witt faction, were loathed. Anyone who
  was suspected of being in sympathy with them was in danger of being torn to
  pieces by the rabble. On the other hand, the brightest hopes were entertained
  for the young Prince of Orange who was, as one of the burgomasters of Leyden
  declared, "certainly worth an army of twenty thousand men." The excitement,
  so tense, was of short duration. It was felt that no half-measures would give
  any satisfaction to the outraged people, and that the slightest delay would
  imperil what was left of the country.</p>

  <p>On July 4th/14th, 1672, at four o'clock in the morning, the Assembly of
  the States General voted the Prince of Orange, then twenty-one years old, to
  be proclaimed Stadtholder and Captain- and Admiral-General of Holland under
  the title of William III. The Stadtholdership was also established in Zeeland
  in favour of the Prince. Three other Provinces&mdash;Guelders, Utrecht and
  Overyssel&mdash;could not assemble, being partially conquered. The two
  others, Friesland and Groningen, had kept as Stadtholder Henry Casimir of
  Nassau, the young son of Frederic William of Nassau-Dietz and Albertina,
  daughter of Frederic Henry. On Friday, July 8th/18th, the Prince of Orange
  was proclaimed Captain- and Admiral-General of the Republic for life, leaving
  the army and navy of the United Provinces absolutely at his orders. He was
  also given free control of the troops in garrisons, and of the town, and of
  country militia. The deputies of the State of Holland went to the camp at
  Bodegraven to inform the Prince of the turn of fortune which had restored to
  him, in a moment, all the dignities of his ancestors, of which he had been
  deprived for twenty years. His Highness showed no signs of pleasure or
  emotion. He demanded if he was relieved of his oath. When they said "Yes," he
  asked the deputies to be the bearers of his thanks, and added simply that he
  promised to make use of his authority for the deliverance of his country and
  for the restoration of internal peace. Four days later he went to the Hague
  and took a new oath in his capacity as Captain- and Admiral-General for life,
  and was also received as Stadtholder for the State of Holland. In a velvet
  armchair, above the seats occupied by the nobles, he took his place, and was
  then conducted to the Courts of Holland to be received as Chief Justice. He
  said nothing on this momentous occasion&mdash;a silence which was regarded as
  equally tactful and prudent. The same night he returned to headquarters,
  without having disclosed either his character or his designs to any. A
  contemporary wrote: "Here is the whole country and government changed in a
  fortnight; all now depends upon the Prince's wishes; being master no one will
  dare to contradict him. In him is now concentrated all that remains of power
  to the States&mdash;he is king only without the name." People now looked
  passionately and eagerly, with all the extravagance of despair, towards the
  young Prince to protect them from the invasion which had engulfed them.
  Despite his youth, his inexperience, the inferiority of the forces at his
  disposal, they believed that he could, almost as it were by a miracle, save
  them. Equally without hesitation or diffidence, without expressing either
  pride or gratitude, reluctance or fear, he accepted the position which had
  been offered him; now the head of the Government, and of the land and sea
  forces, he carried with him the enchantment of a great name and great
  national tradition.</p>

  <p>William III thus found himself at twenty-one years of age in possession of
  supreme authority in what remained of the United Provinces, that is to say he
  had to take on the government at a moment of disaster from the hands of a
  party hostile to him, who had been ruling for twenty years in direct
  opposition to all the traditions of his House, and the wishes of his
  followers (the bulk of the nation), who had shown unmitigated hostility
  towards him, and used the most strenuous endeavours to deprive him of all
  power. Of the Seven Provinces, three were in the hands of the enemy and two
  more&mdash;Groningen and Friesland&mdash;likely soon to be so. Internal
  affairs were in the worst possible confusion, and the army in the worst
  possible condition. The moment of his elevation was, as he himself said
  afterwards, the moment of his "greatest despair." Such foreign help as he
  could rely on dallied on the way; negotiations with the King of France, to
  which from the first he had been opposed, proved nothing but a source of
  humiliation; he was burdened with a state of affairs for which neither he nor
  his ancestors were in any way responsible, and which was the direct result of
  opposition to them and their ideals. The attitude of the governments of
  Maurice, of Frederic Henry, of William II, were justified by the results of
  the government of their opponents; their descendant, William III, had to reap
  the bitter harvest caused by their enemy's action. The magnificent Republic
  built up by the efforts of the Princes of Orange and their supporters had now
  fallen into complete ruin through the work of those who had so dreaded the
  military power of the House of Nassau that they had preferred to risk what
  had, in fact, occurred&mdash;the invasion by a foreign enemy.</p>

  <p>William III addressed no reproaches to anyone; he returned to the camp and
  concerned himself with his task. John de Witt, outwardly, supported him.
  Amalia of Solms, and his old tutor, Cornelius Triglandt, then dying, sent him
  enthusiastic letters of congratulation on his elevation, tempered, however,
  by the dreadful uncertainties of the times; his loyal friend, Prince John
  Maurice, wrote simply, from that vexatious post at Muyden:</p>

  <p>"Monsieur; I have just been informed that Messieurs the States of Holland
  and West Friesland have conferred the office of Stadtholder on Your Highness;
  may the Eternal bless and preserve Your Highness for long years, is the wish,
  from the bottom of his soul, Your Highness' Monsieur, devoted cousin and
  servant."</p>

  <p>Following came a long postscript, full of military news&mdash;things go
  better&mdash;some of the enemy have been driven off at Hinderdam..."<i>avec
  l'aide de Dieu</i>."</p>

  <p>On July 10th/20th, in the midst of the heat and excitement of his
  elevation, the new Stadtholder wrote from Bodegraven again; not a word of
  pleasure, of gratification, of satisfied hopes, of surprise&mdash;only,
  "<i>Monsieur mon Cousin</i>,&mdash;As you said the cavalry was no great use
  to you, and we have great need of it here, can you send it as soon as
  possible?"</p>

  <p>Nothing else, in this moment of unexpected triumph.</p>

  <p>On July 4th/14th, John de Witt appeared in the Assembly of the States of
  Holland, reaffirmed his policy of the last twenty years, and tendered his
  resignation. With the obstinacy which had been so fatal to him he still
  refused to admit that he had been mistaken in this same policy.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

  <p>The Orange flag, so long forbidden, and the Orange colours, for twenty
  years worn secretly or at peril of a fine or arrest, were flaunted joyously
  over all that remained of the United Provinces. Again the flag of Nassau and
  the Orange banderole showed over keep and castle, rampart and port. The power
  of a glorious, intangible tradition had been evoked&mdash;that power which is
  strong enough to raise victory out of defeat, success out of catastrophe. To
  the despairing people of the Dutch Republic the young Prince appeared like an
  embodiment of this mighty tradition. They contrasted his undaunted attitude
  with the consternation, dismay and confusion which had fallen upon their late
  rulers. They marked with proud applause how, when the States General had been
  sending humble embassies to the conqueror, the young General had, with the
  small, ill-equipped army at his disposal, done his best to save as much as
  possible of the two remaining provinces. It was his heroic firmness as much
  as the terrible situation of the country that had brought about the
  revolution. The federal and minority government, the peace party and the
  Republican party, were all alike discredited; every one turned eagerly to the
  military and aristocratic rule as a central authority. All the events that
  took place served to heighten the general enthusiasm, to bring discredit on
  De Witt and glory on the young Prince. While the question of the
  Stadtholdership was still being deliberated in the Assembly of the States
  General, Pieter de Groot returned from Utrecht with the insolent demands of
  Louis XIV. The only Orangist among the plenipotentiaries commissioned to the
  conqueror&mdash;William Adrian of Nassau, Van Odyck&mdash;had retired under
  the excuse that Zeeland disavowed the negotiations; but obviously through the
  influence of the Prince of Orange.</p>

  <p>On July 4, 1672, the States General met again to discuss the intolerable
  terms the conqueror had offered. There was still a considerable party for
  "peace at any price," but Gaspard Fagel, the secretary of the States General,
  showed himself active in opposition to this body of opinion. In a letter to
  the Prince of Orange, who had returned to the army, he wrote: "I have brought
  a number of the members for Holland to say that they would prefer to die by
  the sword. The deputies of Amsterdam came to me to-day to tell me they would
  defend themselves to the last extremity, and I do not see how it would be
  possible to patch matters up, as for myself I would suffer death ten times
  over rather than become the miserable slave of France, leaving our posterity
  ruined both body and soul. I say this to all I meet."</p>

  <p>Here was a spirit after the Prince's own heart; the two men became the
  closest of political allies; when Gaspard Fagel died, sixteen years later,
  William III wrote: "I have lost my best friend."</p>

  <p>Some of the other deputies, however, declared that since there was no hope
  of regaining what the enemy had acquired, "any sacrifice ought to be made to
  prevent the King of France from extending his conquest, unless they wished to
  remain without a country." At the extremity of their disagreement, the States
  General referred to the Prince of Orange. On a message being sent to the
  young Stadtholder, he replied laconically that "the conditions of peace do
  not appear acceptable; the frontiers of Holland may easily be defended if we
  are sent reinforcements." On this the States decided to refuse the proposals
  of the King of France, but determined to send De Groot again to Louis XIV
  with a project for a new treaty. The unfortunate De Groot, who had behaved
  throughout with ability and patriotism, made some effort to obtain definite
  instructions for his detestable mission. He was then offered the assistance
  of the famous diplomat, Conrad Van Beuningen, late Ambassador to London. Van
  Beuningen, inspired by the Prince's example and now an Orangist, utterly
  refused, however, to take any part in any such embassy. In a vehement and
  enthusiastic speech he spoke, as a Frenchman wrote afterwards, "only of the
  Romans and the courage with which they defended their liberties."</p>

  <p>After this, and seeing the pacific temper of the Assembly turned to
  warlike enthusiasm, Pieter de Groot resigned his office. He had been
  furiously threatened in the streets, and more than once barely escaped
  assassination; he believed that it was impossible any longer to withstand the
  temper of the times. Van Gent only remained accredited to Louis XIV. His
  instructions were vague enough "to do his best in the interests of the
  Republic." At the same time the two deputies whom the States had sent in
  panic and undignified desperation to London, with an attempt to detach
  Charles II from Louis XIV, had also failed, one was Halewyn Everard Van
  Weede, Lord of Dyckveldt; the ordinary ambassador at Whitehall, Boreel, who
  had been so completely deceived by Charles II, had remained at Whitehall in
  spite of a state of war between the two countries. None of these statesmen
  was able to do anything with Charles II, light, selfish, unscrupulous and
  bound, of course, by the secret Treaty of Dover to the King of France.</p>

  <p>The Prince of Orange now endeavoured to use his personal interest with his
  uncle, through the intervention of Gabriel Wood (Sylvius), a former
  gentleman-in-waiting of his mother, the Princess Royal, and later through
  Frederic Van Reede, Lord of Renswoude, a lieutenant-colonel of infantry, one
  of his personal friends. This latter gentleman was entrusted with a letter
  from His Highness to his uncle couched in terms almost desperate. The
  Stadtholder ventured to promise Charles II all he would require from the
  States, in spite, he said, of "De Witt and his cabal," assuring his uncle of
  his absolute attachment to his interests, but adding, "as far as my honour
  and fidelity to this State will permit."</p>

  <p>Charles II received this letter of mingled reproach and supplication from
  the young Stadtholder at the same moment as he received notice from Louis XIV
  of the offers of peace made by the ruined States. Charles II knew that he
  could not for very long continue the war which was entirely against the
  wishes of his subjects, and that parliament would, sooner or later, force him
  to bring it to an abrupt conclusion. He therefore told his ally that he
  intended to carry on the war, but wished to distract the attention of his
  people with hopes of peace to prevent them forming factions in favour of the
  Dutch. Encouraged by the letter which Renswoude had brought him secretly from
  his nephew, Charles sent George Savile, recently created Lord Halifax, the
  Duke of Buckingham, and the Earl of Arlington to the King of France, at the
  same time giving them secret instructions to sound the Prince of Orange and
  discover how far the two Kings could count on him, in their plans against the
  Dutch Republic. So far his elevation and his appeal to the King of England,
  sent secretly and containing such concessions, appeared to support the scheme
  contained in the Treaty of Dover, and to confirm the two monarchs in the
  belief that the new Stadtholder would sell what remained of the Dutch
  Republic for the best price he could get.</p>

  <p>The three commissioners were well chosen; Henry Bennet, Earl of Arlington,
  was distinguished as a wit, a soldier, a diplomat and a faithful servant of
  the Stewarts during their misfortunes; he was principal Secretary of State,
  he had contributed towards the Triple Alliance, he was neither notably
  corrupt nor notably greedy, and as honest as it was possible for any minister
  of Charles II to be; in this year he was fifty-four; he was married to Isabel
  de Nassau, sister of the three nobles, Ouwerkerk, La Leck and Odyck, who were
  high in the confidence of the Prince of Orange; despite this, however, there
  was something in Lord Arlington's manner, a mingled artificiality,
  affectation and insolence that was very disagreeable to His Highness, who was
  more exasperated by this nobleman than by many more evilly-disposed people.
  Arlington and Clifford were the only English ministers in the secret of the
  real Treaty of Dover. George Villiers, the Duke of Buckingham, was the
  brilliant <i>roué</i>, the man of many talents, the sparkling wit, the
  glittering courtier, supreme in all the fashionable excellencies of the
  moment; he was, however, past his prime, his once famous beauty was coarsened
  by debauchery, his manners were in the extreme cynical and light, he was
  without stability, honour or judgment, though he had great ascendancy at
  Whitehall; both he and Arlington were ministers of the famous "cabal."</p>

  <p>The third commissioner, George Savile, Viscount Halifax, was highly
  superior in character and talents to either of these; elegant, accomplished,
  honourable, gifted, with a mind at once spacious and alert, a temper at once
  firm and flexible, tolerant and full of wit and humour, this illustrious
  Englishman was more likely than either of his companions to be acceptable to
  the young Prince with whom, indeed, he had much in common. Lord Halifax was,
  however, indolent, he lacked force and enthusiasm, his character was weakened
  by his keen sense of the falsity and triviality of all human actions; he
  might admire heroism, but it would be coldly; with a slight wonder he had
  noted the ambition of France and its direction; he was a supporter of the
  principles of the Triple Alliance and the balance of power. This envoy,
  extremely intelligent and observant, was impressed by the vivid excitement
  and enthusiasm in the country where he had arrived, at the very moment when
  popular enthusiasm had restored the Prince of Orange to the Stadtholdership.
  The Englishman noted how the authorities were frantic with terror and
  powerless to enforce any order on the tumult of excited people in the
  streets, who at the Hague escorted the envoys to their lodgings, intoxicated
  with drinking health to the Prince and confusion to the States, "believing
  us," as Halifax wrote, "partial to him and that we came to make peace."
  Buckingham remarked that he "had seen nothing to be compared to the
  excitement since the burning of the Rump." The Englishmen also thought that
  the political revolution was a triumph for the English party which had always
  been identified with the young Prince of Orange. They believed that the Dutch
  Republic was ruined, but they did not intend that their King's nephew should
  go down in this ruin. They were convinced that he would now identify himself
  with England and obtain through his uncle's help the greatest possible
  personal advantage from the downfall of the Dutch. One of the clauses of
  their instructions from Charles II ran: "You shall make the best conditions
  you can for our nephew the Prince of Orange by making him prince, if
  possible, of Holland, and as much of the other countries as you can, or at
  least arrange that he and the heirs male of his body shall ever be
  stadtholders, generals and admirals." Again: "Though you do not conclude a
  peace with the States General, yet you shall make conditions with His Most
  Christian Majesty for our nephew the Prince of Orange as our Treaty with the
  French King does allow. If it be possible you shall procure for him places
  which shall be conquered in Holland or Zeeland (that is not our partage), or
  that shall submit upon owning him their Sovereign, but this must be left to
  you upon the place to get the best conditions you can for him."</p>

  <p>Charles II did not associate his nephew with the causes of offence he had
  against the Dutch nor with the dislike that he had always felt towards the
  Republicans. He remembered, with as much gratitude as was possible to his
  cool, selfish nature, the services rendered him by the parents of the young
  Prince, and the immense sum of money which he still owed him, and he believed
  that this was a favourable opportunity to repay all these obligations without
  doing any damage to himself. Van Beuningen, who had recently spoken so hotly
  against the terms that Louis XIV had proposed, accompanied the English
  Deputies to the camp of the young Stadtholder, where they arrived on the
  evening of June 25th/July 5th, finding him at Bodegraven, Newerbrugge, where
  he had just returned from taking his place as Stadtholder in the Assembly of
  the States General; the English commissioners looked upon this as a farce;
  they had observed the country in an uproar of despair, a tumult of panic, and
  considered the elevation of the Prince as a useless expedient of a ruined
  Government; the Duke of Buckingham and the Earl of Arlington were the first
  to arrive at the camp; it was unfortunate that the Marquis of Halifax was
  delayed, for his tact, his soft and accommodating manners, his known probity
  and his subtle understanding would have done much to render the business of
  the Englishmen less painful.</p>

  <p>The Prince had met both these nobles two years before in London, and had
  no cause to like either; Buckingham, an idle profligate, assured, cynical,
  bloated, showy and corrupt, was the type that His Highness had been trained
  to loathe and despise; Arlington he always found objectionable; both were
  middle-aged, disillusioned, worldly men with no ideals or enthusiasms and
  with that manner, half-mocking, half-amused, so hateful and depressing to the
  ardent aspirations of youth.</p>

  <p>They did not disguise that they thought His Highness a slight youth, and
  they smiled at the inadequate, ill-equipped troops which were all he had to
  oppose the admirably organized, splendidly trained, victorious army of the
  French. The Prince received them in the presence of the commissioners of the
  States General, and told the Englishmen the proposals which he hoped would be
  received both by France and England.</p>

  <p>This was treated by the commissioners as a mere formality; they knew the
  conquerors' terms. They desired to see the Prince in private and prepared to
  spend the night in the camp; William III was surrounded by his friends, the
  young Dutch nobles, who all hoped much from the good will and intervention of
  the King of England; Buckingham responded agreeably; he was flattered by the
  humble overtures of the Dutch and secretly apprehensive that Louis XIV might
  be playing his own game, in which the English would not find their count; nor
  did Arlington believe that it would be useful to England to see France master
  of the Netherlands. On the subject being opened, the Prince candidly
  reproached the Englishmen for their King's part in the attack on the
  Netherlands; he conducted himself with a reserve that concealed considerable
  agitation; the Englishmen thought he was concerned with his own interests,
  and with much good nature and pleasant deference tried to reassure His
  Highness. A despatch dated from the camp near Utrecht, June 28th/July 8th,
  1672, gives an account of this interview with the young Prince.</p>

  <p>"We lost no time in endeavouring to ease his mind from the reproaches he
  made us upon the subject of the war by letting him know in confidence to
  himself that His Majesty would not be brought to begin it till he had
  conditioned the Prince should find his account in it, and in case of success,
  of which we did not doubt." In brief, the Dutch Republic was ruined, but the
  Prince of Orange need not be.</p>

  <p>William III at once refused to dwell on this aspect of the case, but he
  begged them to persuade the King of France to content himself with the great
  fortress of Maastricht and the towns on the Rhine. He denied that the state
  of the Republic was hopeless. The Elector of Brandenburg, he declared, had
  promised assistance which, with the reinforcements assured by Spain, and
  fifteen thousand men expected from the Emperor by the end of the year, would
  suffice to turn the scale. He exclaimed passionately against the insolence of
  the French demands, declaring that he would rather die a thousand deaths than
  submit to them. The Englishmen replied cynically enough: "They would do their
  best to moderate them so they might find their account in the
  adjustment."</p>

  <p>They were first amused, then surprised, by this temper in the young
  Prince, with the indifferent cynicism of the able man of the world; they
  endeavoured to soothe and flatter what they considered the foolish flourishes
  of youth.</p>

  <p>"To make our terms go down the more we called it cautionary terms" (i.e.
  the terms the Prince still resisted as to what he was to deliver to England),
  "for performance of what should be promised us, to which the Prince replied,
  he was confident the States would never give them, and that for his own part
  he could not in conscience advise them to it."</p>

  <p>This was, to Buckingham and Arlington, an odd attitude; they were faced by
  motives they could not understand; vexed by the resistance of the young
  Prince and determined to seduce him, the Englishmen reminded him "that he
  would bethink himself well not only to remove the war out of his country, but
  to assert to himself sovereignty over it, wherein both the kings would secure
  him, abroad and at home, from all danger."</p>

  <p>With ardent emotion William answered instantly, that "he liked better the
  position of Stadtholder which they had given him, that he believed himself
  obliged in honour and confidence not to prefer his interests before his
  obligations."</p>

  <p>The plenipotentiaries still refused to accept this answer which seemed to
  them of an amazing imprudence and only to show the rashness of a young and
  inexperienced man. They asked him to consult his most trusted advisers,
  cautioning him, however, not to mention to these the point of the sovereignty
  promised by Charles and Louis.</p>

  <p>William III discussed the situation with Van Beuningen&mdash;a man who, as
  a witty and agreeable companion (though high-minded and religious), was very
  acceptable to the English envoys; his polished and accommodating manners, his
  elegant and agreeable conversation had made him popular at Whitehall; he was,
  however, as rigid as the Prince on the point of the English proposals; when
  the Commissioners were admitted to another interview with His Highness they
  found his resolve unchanged and his passionate excitement, which he could
  scarcely control, increased.</p>

  <p>Buckingham, easy and pleasant after his wine, and no great lover of the
  French, listened while Conrad Van Beuningen, "after his usual way," pointed
  out the impolicy of an Anglo-French alliance; after he had taken "a great
  deal of time" on this argument, the Prince spoke to the same purpose, clearly
  and vehemently demonstrating the advantages England would gain by detaching
  herself from France; this was the first indication of the policy to which he
  was to dedicate his life; despite himself, the more reckless of the
  Englishmenwere impressed by the personality of William III.</p>

  <p>Van Beuningen and the Prince between them almost persuaded Buckingham of
  the impolicy of the Anglo-French alliance, and the volatile duke declared
  with an oath that the Stadtholder was in the right, and offered to sign on
  the spot a treaty between England and the States.</p>

  <p>William III, who had spent himself in passionate persuasions, instantly
  ordered articles to be engrossed; he believed that, if they were framed at
  once, Buckingham would sign them; but he was in the dark as to the precise
  instructions of the envoys; Buckingham declared himself convinced by the
  Prince's eloquent appeal into which he had thrown so much passion and
  fire.</p>

  <p>Arlington intervened, an action that must have added to the dislike
  William III felt for him, and the conference ended, well into the summer
  night, Buckingham still protesting he was for the Anglo-Dutch Treaty. The
  more cautious Earl was astounded at this rashness, and managed to keep the
  matter in abeyance until the morning, when Buckingham had cooled, and the
  articles were not signed.</p>

  <p>Another interview took place; the Englishmen began to be mortified and
  vexed and to show some impatience in their manner; William III was still
  unmoved by all the tempting offers put before him, though fatigued and
  desperate; Buckingham had veered from his attitude of the night before and
  began to think the young man a fool&mdash;he, to pit himself against Condé,
  Turenne, Luxembourg, this miserable army to affront the French!</p>

  <p>The easy Duke, however, used all his charm and eloquence to persuade the
  inflexible Prince. He pointed out to him the state of the country&mdash;half
  of it in the hands of the enemy, and a large portion under water&mdash;the
  confusion of the government which in a moment of crisis he had been called
  upon to administer, the large party of Republicans and peace advocates who
  were still united against him, and endeavoured to represent to the Prince
  that it was mere rigid obstinacy to refuse his own great personal advantage
  for the sake of those who were his enemies and who had kept him out of his
  hereditary honours for twenty years, and so led the country that when he did
  accede to those same honours they were valueless.</p>

  <p>The excited officers who were William's constant
  companions&mdash;Zuylestein, Bentinck, Boreel, the young Rhyngrave, La Leck,
  Ouwerkerk, and others of the young nobles who bitterly disliked the
  Loevensteyn faction&mdash;were heard to murmur "that they would as lief that
  a dozen of the States were hanged, so the country had peace and the Prince
  were sovereign of it."</p>

  <p>William III, however, remained adamant. He appeared rapt in an enthusiasm,
  or "lifted up, and to consider all that the envoys said very little."</p>

  <p>The Duke of Buckingham continued to press him to put himself entirely in
  his uncle's hands. "The Prince cut him short," declaring again and with deep
  passion, that "the country had trusted him, and that he never would deceive
  or betray them for any base ends of his own." Irritated by the stubborn
  patriotism of His Highness, the Duke of Buckingham cynically observed that
  the Prince was not to think any more of his country as it no longer existed,
  and he repeated several times, "Do you not see that it is lost?"</p>

  <p>William III replied that he did indeed see that it was in great danger,
  but there was one way not to behold it lost, and that was to die in the last
  ditch.</p>

  <p>Seeing that his defiance had alienated the Commissioners, the Stadtholder
  concluded with a passionate appeal to them to do what they could for the
  Dutch at the French quarters; this was coldly received.</p>

  <p>When the mortified English ambassadors had departed for the French camp at
  Utrecht, His Highness, exhausted and overwrought, declared in a tumult of
  emotion to his companions that he would rather spend his life hunting on his
  German estates than submit to the demands of France; even his friends were
  amazed and alarmed by his attitude.</p>

  <p>Sir William Temple, writing not long after these events, gives this
  account of them:</p>

  <p>"The bait which the French thought would not fail of being swallowed by
  the Prince, and about which the utmost artifice was employed, was the
  proposal of making him Sovereign of the Provinces under the protection of
  England and France. And to say truth when so little of the provinces was
  left, and what remained was under water and in imminent danger by the first
  frosts of winter, this seemed a lure to which a-, meaner soul than that of
  this Prince would very well stoop; but he was above it, and his answer always
  firm that he would never betray a trust that was given him and never sell the
  liberties of his country that his ancestors had so long defended.</p>

  <p>"Yet the game he played was then thought so desperate that one of his
  nearest servants told me that he had long expostulated with his master, and
  had asked him at last, how he intended to live after Holland had been lost?
  The Prince replied that he was resolved to live upon the lands he had left in
  Germany, and that he would rather pass his life in hunting there than sell
  his country or his liberty to France at any price."</p>

  <p>The gracious courtesies with which Louis XIV welcomed Buckingham and
  Arlington were very pleasant to them, after the rebuff they had received from
  the Prince of Orange. Louis made many professions of his resolution not to
  give over until the "King our master is entirely satisfied." Two days later,
  Lord Halifax, delayed by adverse winds, reached the Prince's camp, only to
  find that he had been preceded by the other plenipotentiaries. He had noted
  the grief and tumult of the Dutch&mdash;"modest, civil people"&mdash;women
  wringing their hands and weeping, and the Prince's colours everywhere.
  Halifax proceeded to Louis's court at Utrecht, where a conference took place
  in a room adjoining the King's bedchamber. There were present Arlington,
  Buckingham, the young Duke of Monmouth, the ministers Pomponne and Louvois.
  The discussion lasted from nine in the morning till noon. The English
  ambassadors still insisted, "We are to add as a private overture to the
  Prince of Orange, that of making him Sovereign of all the Seven Provinces,
  our partage only excepted, to which he shall covenant to us to give His
  Majesty entire possession when the former point is made good to him, and His
  Most Christian Majesty to be his and our guarantee therein."</p>

  <p>It was therefore still believed possible to seduce the young Stadtholder,
  and Louis XIV, glutted with success and wishing for peace&mdash;though, of
  course, entirely on his own terms&mdash;was quite willing to give his young
  relative some advantage in the matter. His quarrel, like the quarrel of
  Charles, had been with the States General and not with the Prince of Orange;
  a touch of grandeur gilded all the actions of the French king, and his
  attitude to his kinsman was amiable and generous. Finally, the English and
  French statesmen drew up a general sketch of the terms on which they were
  willing to grant peace to the defeated Dutch Republic. These included
  (Article VI)&mdash;"The sovereignty of that portion of the United Provinces
  not demanded by the belligerent monarchs, for the Prince of Orange, either in
  the capacity of reigning prince, or of Hereditary Stadtholder," which shows
  that neither Louis XIV, his ministers, nor the English ambassadors, had taken
  very seriously the attitude adopted by the young Stadtholder; they probably
  believed it a mere flourish of youthful arrogance, and they were encouraged
  in the hope of ultimately securing William by their tempting bribe by the
  fact that Nymwegen and Grave had recently fallen to the French arms. The arms
  of Turenne had been as successful as the policy of Louvois had then, as the
  French believed, proved to be. Secure in his triumph at the moment, and
  certain of his triumph in the future, the magnificent King showered lavish
  gifts on the venial Englishmen: Arlington, the Secretary of State, received
  jewels to the value of forty-eight thousand nine hundred <i>livres</i>;
  Monmouth, the pampered fop, had a diamond ring worth seventeen thousand five
  hundred <i>livres</i>; Buckingham, the Master of the Horse, and Halifax had
  presents of almost equal value. Magnificent reviews in honour of the Earl of
  Arlington took place outside Nymwegen. The easy, impressive victories of the
  French, and the utter defeat of the Dutch seemed more than ever
  emphasized.</p>

  <p>When the Commissioners returned from these admirable splendours to the
  Prince's camp on July 1st/11th, William III had just come from the Hague,
  where he had finally taken the oath as Stadtholder of the United Provinces.
  When the offers of the Kings of England and France were again put before him,
  he refused even to consider them; he merely coldly remarked, "that this
  proposal came twenty-four hours too late, that he had taken an oath of
  fidelity to the States as Stadtholder and meant to abide by it." In a harsh
  note to the plenipotentiaries, he merely desired that a copy of the joint
  demand be forwarded to the Hague for the consideration of the States
  General.</p>

  <p>The vexed Englishmen, finding the Prince immovable, returned to Louis XIV
  at his new camp at Heeswyck, near Boxtel, vowing to make the young
  Stadtholder pay for his rashness and force on him the hard conditions of a
  conqueror; Halifax, however, had become definitely against France.</p>

  <p>Charles II's terms now were: the lowering of the Dutch flag before that of
  England, even by the entire fleet meeting a single vessel in English waters;
  the repayment of the war expenses amounting to a million sterling; an annual
  rent of a hundred and twenty-five thousand florins for the herring fishery on
  the coast of Great Britain, and the recognition of William III as sovereign
  of all that remained of the United Provinces, after what might be detached
  from it by the King of France and his allies. He also demanded Sluys, the
  islands of Walcheren, Cadsand, Goeree and Voorn, thus securing the entrance
  to Holland and Zeeland.</p>

  <p>England and France now being in complete agreement, the final eclipse of
  the Dutch Republic seemed accomplished. The Duke of Buckingham and Lord
  Arlington, too offended to seek another personal interview, sent Sir Gabriel
  Sylvius to the Prince of Orange, to let him know of the new conditions and to
  request an answer within ten days. They were careful to emphasize, in cynical
  and haughty terms, the complete agreement between the two conquering
  monarchs, and the hopelessness of any possible attempt on William III's part
  to detach his uncle from the French interests.</p>

  <p>Sir Gabriel Sylvius (Wood), a personal friend of the Prince and his own
  secret envoy to Charles II, found the young Stadtholder inspecting the
  fortifications of Schoonhoven, and begged him not to open the despatches
  until he had dined. His Highness at once, however, tore open the envelope
  and, having read the letter from the two plenipotentiaries and the treaty of
  the two kings, he, in a passionate fit of anger, made a movement to throw the
  documents into the fire; an instant's reflection, however, showed him how
  compromising the papers were as regards his own position with the States
  General. He flung himself on horseback and galloped at once for the Hague, so
  as to be himself the first to show them the communications he had received
  from the French and English kings, which contained the formal terms of the
  conquerors. At the hasty Assembly of the States General the Prince of Orange
  himself read without comment the proposals for peace which had been received
  from the insolent victors; the disheartened and amazed deputies pressed the
  young Stadtholder for his opinion. It seemed as if they had lost all
  confidence in themselves and relied only upon their new master; the Assembly
  was crowded, every one seemed in a state of suspense and to wait upon great
  events. It was now clear, even to the most ardent advocates of peace and the
  most fervent supporters of the Loevensteyn faction, that England could not be
  drawn into a separate treaty, that Charles II had not been mollified by the
  election of his nephew to the Stadtholdership, and the terms of France would
  not be lowered. The eyes of all these desperate, defeated men, rulers and
  governors of their country for years&mdash;men old, experienced and
  tried&mdash;turned to the youth of one-and-twenty years, who stood facing
  them in a tense, exalted passion, with the French and English proposals in
  his hand, and eagerly besought him, almost weeping, not so much for his
  opinion as for his commands.</p>

  <p>For the first time the Stadtholder was enabled to voice his own personal
  opinion as to the politics of Europe. He did this definitely and with a
  knowledge of current affairs which amazed his hearers. Powerless, thwarted
  and opposed as he had been, this was the first opportunity he had had of
  showing his character, his intellect, and his knowledge. He spoke for more
  than three hours with a fire, an enthusiasm, and an intensity which kept his
  hearers in an absorbed state of rapt attention. He ran through the French
  propositions, and showed the consequences that would follow the accepting of
  them, declaring that the very treating of such terms would distract the
  people and dispirit all; to entertain a thought of them would be, he
  declared, "to give up the country." For upwards of an hour he poured out his
  eager scorn at the mere thought of considering such terms, declaring that it
  would be better to go to the Indies and there found a new country, where they
  might enjoy their liberties, their religion and peace. This startling scheme
  had even been thought out in some detail. William III stated that an account
  of the shipping in the Port of Amsterdam had proved that there was nearly
  enough to transport all the population of what remained in the Netherlands,
  far beyond the reach of the tyranny of the Kings of England and France. The
  young Stadtholder, with brilliant insight and steadfast courage, then tried
  to hearten his hearers by showing the possibilities of making a stand,
  notwithstanding the extreme straits to which they all seemed to be reduced.
  He then demonstrated the force of the Allies, Brandenburg, Spain, the
  Emperor, and declared that England (that is Charles II) could no longer hold
  out without a parliament, and that parliament would force the King to other
  measures. He also declared that, flourishing and victorious as the French
  seemed at the present moment, they could not maintain themselves long, that
  the Imperialists coming down to the Lower Rhine would "make them get out of
  the Netherlands as fast as they had come into it." His speech on this point
  showed a shrewd and close insight into French affairs. For the clauses in the
  agreement that seemed to point to his own advantage, he contemptuously
  dismissed these saying, "that they were the words not of friends but of
  enemies." In conclusion, he submitted schemes for the raising of taxes, for
  the extraordinary expenditure to which the country must be put for its
  defence, and laid out several projects for obtaining money. He added that
  religion and liberty could not be purchased at too dear a rate, and that
  every one, particularly the ministers, should try to infuse a spirit of
  sacrifice into the people, and to persuade them to take heart; and here the
  young Stadtholder reminded them "that their visible dejection and panic had
  been the chief hopes of their enemies; their despair," he added, "had been
  but too visible to all the world."</p>

  <p>The Assembly listened to this heroic discourse with an enthusiasm which
  seemed itself a presage of success. All were astonished to hear so young a
  man, almost a boy, with so great a knowledge, so much judgment and courage.
  The speech, like the breaking of the Orange flag all over the country, was a
  challenge to fate, a refusal to despair.</p>

  <p>The character of William III, and this very occasion&mdash;when, with the
  proposals so disgraceful for his country and so advantageous for himself in
  his hand, he flung himself on horseback, dashed to the Hague, and, with such
  inspired passion, animated the elders of the despairing country; when, beaten
  and almost powerless, he defied the mighty and insulting conquerors, pitting
  his youth, his inexperience, his poor resources, against the wisdom, genius
  and boundless supplies of the victorious enemy&mdash;must, one feels, have
  been in the mind of his great admirer, Sir William Temple, when he wrote the
  essay on <i>Heroic Virtue</i>:</p>

  <p>"Though it be easier to describe heroic virtue by the effects and examples
  than by causes or definitions, yet it may be said to arise from some great
  and native excellency of temper and genius, transcending the common race of
  mankind in wisdom, goodness and fortitude. These ingredients, advantaged by
  birth, improved by education, and assisted by fortune, seem to make that
  noble composition which gives such a lustre to those that have possessed it,
  as make them appear to common eyes something more than mortals, and to have
  been of some mixture between divine and human race; to have been honoured and
  obeyed in their lives, and after their deaths, bewailed and adored."</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

  <p>The result of the Prince of Orange's heroic speech was immediate. The
  French terms were declined by the States General, the Deputies declaring
  "that in accordance with the very prudent counsel of the Prince of Orange,
  they considered the conditions proposed by the Kings of England and France so
  harsh and unreasonable that they could never bring themselves to accept them;
  in spite of their wish for the establishment of peace, they must defend the
  inhabitants faithfully to the last extremity, and await the relief which it
  might please God to give them."</p>

  <p>The aged Huygens wrote to the old Rhyngrave, March 25, 1672:</p>

  <p>"I begin to believe that my presence will be necessary at the Army, and
  that I must grease my old boots to serve at least as spectator in the
  campaign."</p>

  <p>Showing a complete disdain of the adversaries whom he believed had
  insulted him by offering him bribes, the young Stadtholder did not even
  answer the proposals made to him, but amazed the superb French monarch by
  sending to him a copy from the register of the States General in which their
  refusal to consider the proposal was embodied. Colbert de Croissy wrote to
  the King: "The Prince of Orange does not even deign to answer the conditions
  under which Your Majesty and the King of England were willing to grant him
  peace, but he has sent an extract from the register of the deliberations of
  the States General, making it known that they refuse to submit to them."</p>

  <p>Charles II had, however, not given up all hopes of winning his nephew,
  whose character it was impossible for him to understand, and whose ambition
  was one he could not fathom. The English King was still hoping to accomplish
  his own one coherent piece of policy&mdash;the union of England with Rome,
  which was soon to collapse. He continued to send him letters full of
  insincere flatteries and false professions of friendship, declaring that he
  had undertaken the war largely on his behalf, that he might obtain his rights
  from the Loevensteyn faction. Without consulting the States General, William
  III endeavoured to take advantage of this professed friendship on the part of
  his uncle to draw him into a separate and secret treaty, and to prevent him
  ratifying that which he had recently made with Louis XIV at Heeswyck. To
  separate the two conquering kings seemed to William III the only means of
  preserving the Republic, and he offered terms which, in any other conditions,
  would have seemed foolish&mdash;the salute of the flag, possession of the
  island of Surinam, an annual rent of fifty thousand florins for the right of
  fishing, an indemnity of four hundred thousand florins for the cost of the
  war. These were offers which Charles II, in the interests of his country,
  would have done well to accept. But the King of England was careless of
  everything save retaining the friendship of the man who was pensioning him,
  Louis XIV. He at once communicated the letter to the French ambassador. At
  the same time, while he was thus betraying his nephew to his enemy, Charles
  II still endeavoured to bribe William III, promising him once again
  sovereignty over a portion of the United Provinces if he would deliver up to
  the enemy the forts he yet held. His Highness refused even to listen to such
  dishonourable suggestions. He abandoned all attempts to open negotiations
  with Charles II and decided to wait until that monarch was forced to summon a
  parliament, who were certain to bring the war to a close by refusing
  supplies. Charles, however, met this prospect by proroguing Parliament until
  February of the following year, giving the office of Lord Treasurer to Lord
  Clifford, who was in the secret of the Treaty of Dover and the declared enemy
  of the Republic, and making Ashley Lord Chancellor with the title of Earl of
  Shaftesbury; this statesman was said to have applied to the United Provinces
  the words of Cato&mdash;<i>Delenda est Carthago</i>, which he proposed to
  take as the text of his policy.</p>

  <p>This was the final destruction of the Prince's hopes, and the final seal
  set on the policy which he was to follow all his life. Not from the false,
  selfish, obstinate King of England&mdash;a mere pensioner of
  France&mdash;could any support be expected, either for the liberty of Europe
  or for the freedom of the Protestant religion. It was with the people and
  parliament of England, who were always in their hearts in sympathy with
  William III's cause, that the young Stadtholder proposed to deal, and he
  began even now, though tentatively, to open negotiations with that party in
  England which were in opposition to the King.</p>

  <p>But in these last days of July, the United Provinces had failed in the
  cabinet and in the field; while the fruitless negotiations had been dragging
  on with England and France they had lost even more towns and forts, including
  the most important ones of Nymwegen and Grave. The Province of Zeeland was
  the only one wholly free from the French, and by July 19th/29th, Louis had
  taken eighty towns and forts. Even while he was offering his impossible
  terms, Louis XIV had been pursuing his conquests which were still mostly
  bloodless and inexpensive. He had now forty thousand men in North Brabant,
  and would have taken Bois-le-Duc but for a sudden heavy rain which caused the
  marshes round the city to overflow, and rendered it inaccessible in the midst
  of water. Louis XIV, however, had felt himself, to a certain extent,
  checkmated by the Prince of Orange's most unexpected attitude, and by the
  States General, at William's dictation, rejecting the terms which the French
  King had believed himself certain to have obtained, and which he obviously
  would have obtained from the De Witt or Loevensteyn faction if the young
  Prince had not been elected Stadtholder by the will of the people. Finding
  himself faced by this formidable opposition, and by the fact that the
  inundations prevented him from making any decided move until the winter, when
  he hoped to get his forces across the ice, the brilliant Louis XIV wearied of
  the war, which had become dull and monotonous; he gave the command of his
  armies to Viscount Turenne, the Governorship of Utrecht to Luxembourg, that
  of the towns on the Rhine to Comte D'Éstrades, the Governorship of Guelders
  to Count de Lorges, and sent Chamilly's division to watch Maastricht.</p>

  <p>At this time, the end of July, the niece of Amalia of Solms-Braunfels, the
  Countess de Dohna, was writing from the distracted, anxious capital, the
  Hague, to the valiant old Prince John Maurice, still, through all these
  political excitements, grimly holding the post at Muyden. In the name of her
  mistress (she was lady-in-waiting to the Dowager Princess), the Countess
  thanked the Prince John Maurice for his congratulations as to the elevation
  of her grandson, but added the womanly touch, "Her Highness has extremely
  pitied Your Highness' embarrassment and is sure you have passed some evil
  hours."</p>

  <p>A little later, the Stadtholder, from Gorcum, had vexatious news to send
  to the States; in a bitter letter to Fagel he announced the escape of
  Montbas, who had "corrupted two of my guards who were keeping him." William
  III excused himself from negligence and had given orders that the fugitive
  was to be pursued and brought back alive or dead; the Stadtholder had been
  resolved on the execution of the man he regarded as a traitor or a
  coward.</p>

  <p>Enclosed with this was a letter from the King of England that M. Van Weede
  (Dyckfeldt) had just brought, full of flattering insincerities&mdash;"which
  you may communicate (to the States) or not as you think fit."</p>

  <p>Thus, amid the tumult, the anguish, the despair struggling with hope, the
  Prince, calm above his passion, patiently knotted the threads of his policy,
  sparing no detail, neglecting no trifle that might assist his great design;
  no one any longer disputed his authority, and the army, the senate, the
  people were alike falling into ordered ranks of resistance behind him; the
  letters of Prince John Maurice changed tone, their "<i>Messieurs
  d'Amsterdam</i>" were giving him everything necessary "for the defence of
  Muyden, Wesep, Hinderdam and other places."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the victorious young monarch returned to St. Germains by way of
  the Spanish Netherlands to enjoy the full flavour of his triumph in the
  profuse adulation of his courtiers. Nothing was wanting to make him relish to
  the full the sweets of victory&mdash;triumphal arches, medals, paintings,
  poems, perpetuated the memory of the most glorious invasion and conquest of
  the Dutch Republic, the sharp punishment he had inflicted on "this nation of
  cheesemongers and shopkeepers," the rapid fall of undefended fortresses, the
  miraculous crossing of an unprotected ford, the splendid battering down of
  decayed ramparts, and the magnificent capture of raw militia and peasant
  levies. Certainly the triumph had not been quite complete; neither had the
  calculations of Louis XIV nor those of his ministers taken into account the
  inundations nor the Prince of Orange. They had not thought that the Dutch
  would submerge the remaining portion of their country, and they had not
  thought that if the Prince of Orange was created Stadtholder he would be
  anything but their friend and ally. The courage which had opened the sluices
  and cut the dykes, and the contemptuous defiance shown by the young Prince
  had not for a moment been foreseen by Louis XIV; nor had he for a moment
  considered that a country reduced to such a desperate state as was the
  Netherlands would refuse any terms he chose to offer. He was forced to return
  to St. Germains with his army checked, his peace terms rejected. Nor was the
  news that Louis XIV received from the conquered country altogether as
  flattering to his pride as the overwhelming ovation he met in his
  capital.</p>

  <p>The Prince of Orange was vigorously using his new powers to increase the
  inundations which so far had been undertaken in many places unwillingly, and
  in all places with only partial success. Now the waters soon extended to
  Bois-le-Duc; it was said, "there is never a place in Europe better fortified
  than the Province of Holland at this moment." Friesland had saved herself by
  the same measures; there the threatened towns rose like islands out of lakes
  which the French and their allies, the Bishop of Münster and the Elector of
  Cologne, could not pass.</p>

  <p>Groningen continued a steady resistance, though Coevorden had fallen. The
  heroic attitude of this Northern town, skilfully and boldly defended by its
  Governor, Charles Rapenhaupt, Baron Sukha, lieutenant-general to the young
  Prince Henry Casimir of Nassau-Dietz, Stadtholder of Friesland and Groningen,
  was of the greatest assistance in the safety of the United Provinces. On the
  sea, too, the Dutch more than managed to hold their own; the most valuable
  Indian convoy, commanded by Van Oberwecke and under De Ruyter's protection,
  safely reached the shores of the island of Texel without being discovered by
  the English ships.</p>

  <p>"Their India Fleet," wrote Arlington, "passed ours in the night, without
  being seen...This return, by encouraging them," added the Englishman, "will
  very likely prevent them becoming more reasonable."</p>

  <p>The Dutch had reason to rejoice that this prize had not fallen into the
  hands of the English, for the fourteen ships which comprised the convoy had a
  cargo of a hundred and forty tons of gold, representing in value seven or
  eight million florins. This successful manoeuvre, which practically brought
  the naval war for a while to a pause, was equally due to the vigilance of the
  Prince of Orange and the devotion of De Ruyter, who still, despite the
  appointment of the young Stadtholder as Admiral-General, commanded the Fleet,
  which was now safely laid up in the shallow waters in the mouth of the
  Scheldt. This success, however, did not prevent the burden laid on William
  being almost overwhelming nor his difficulties still appearing
  unsurmountable. Not only were three provinces&mdash;Guelders, Overyssel and
  Utrecht&mdash;in the hands of the King of France and their deputies unable to
  meet, not only was William III forced to keep on the water-line the last
  defences of the heart of the country, but he had under these conditions
  entirely to reorganize the army, to restore discipline and method in these
  disheartened and miserable levies, refortify such strong places as remained
  to the Republic in North Brabant, to restore internal order&mdash;the
  government of the States was more than ever in a condition of chaos&mdash;and
  to face financial affairs, for the country was almost in a state of
  bankruptcy and every resource appeared to have been exhausted. No one of the
  States, it seemed, except that of Holland, was in any condition to contribute
  anything to the means of defence. With an heroic courage and an inflexible
  composure that amazed Europe William III took up all these burdens, and
  showed himself nobly equal to his stupendous task. He was able to comprehend
  the complicated subtle arts of government that John de Witt had never learnt.
  He arrogated to himself at once almost absolute power, at least a far greater
  power than any of his ancestors had enjoyed, though one of prestige only,
  since he had no more actual rights and privileges than any of his ancestors
  had possessed. Every one deferred to him, and all looked towards him for
  encouragement and leadership, for the dullest could perceive his mental and
  moral qualities, his unerring grasp of a situation, his vast activity and his
  cool sagacity. The twenty years of Republican government of John de Witt was
  as if it had never been, the whole country seemed only to exist in their
  loyalty to and enthusiasm for the House of Orange, represented by this
  resolute young man who, to save the country which had for so long kept him
  out of his father's offices, refused the most tempting offer made by the two
  greatest Kings in Europe. The position of the young Prince had changed with a
  startling rapidity. He who had been universally ignored was now universally
  courted. He who had been without a shadow of authority now had complete
  authority in his hands. He who had never had a chance to express himself was
  now respectfully exhorted to give his opinion on all occasions and on all
  subjects. He who had been silent, put aside, thwarted, humiliated and
  checked, had not been allowed to have his colours displayed, to keep his
  friends about him, to have any influence, was now supreme; chief of the Army
  and of the States, he who had been a mere cypher, little more than a private
  nobleman in rank, only of importance since he was a grandchild of England, a
  connection of France, was now admired and remarked in the whole of
  Europe.</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>The challenge that Louis XIV had thrown down when he had invaded the
  Netherlands should have been picked up by Leopold of Hapsburg&mdash;it was to
  him that it was directed, as it was Spain, his nearest ally, that was the
  marked-down prey of France. The Emperor, whose position Louis had always
  envied, the ally and friend of the Pope, the head of Catholic Christendom,
  compared with whom the Bourbons were but <i>parvenu</i>, might well have been
  expected by Louis XIV to reply with all his force to the insolent manifesto
  which had been thrust in the face of Europe when he had made his attack upon
  the Dutch Republic and the Spanish Netherlands. Leopold I, to whom the treaty
  of neutrality with France had been a mere temporary convenience, had
  responded, indeed, to the defiance, but it was not he whom Louis XIV had to
  fear; the real opponent had come from a most unexpected quarter. No one could
  have been more surprised than Louis XIV had he realized that the champion of
  the Protestant religion and the liberties of Europe was to be united in the
  person of the young Prince of Orange who, to secure the liberties of his
  country, would espouse the Hapsburg cause, and by evoking a coalition of all
  the powers against France, not only check the progress of Louis XIV but
  finally bring him to ruin. Not only Louis XIV himself, but every other
  politician in Europe would have been amazed if such a prophecy had been made
  at this moment. Such, however, was to be the course of events. Not the
  Emperor of Germany, not the Elector of Brandenburg, not the King of Spain,
  nor the Pope of Rome, nor any of the great and redoubtable potentates whom
  Louis XIV might have dreaded, and for whose opposition he might have been
  prepared, but this young man, reared in misfortune, brought up in obscurity,
  excluded not only from the honours of his father but from all share in public
  life, suddenly thrust on to the scene at a moment of such dreadful confusion
  and terror, was to be the person who was to defy, affront, and finally bring
  down the mounting pride and pretensions of the Bourbons. At this moment of
  supreme trial the young Prince showed that grandeur of soul and width of
  intellect which were to make him "for thirty years," as one of his opponents
  remarked (that is, from this year 1672 till his death), "the foremost
  personage in Europe." Throughout the fluctuating terrors, horrors,
  excitements, flatteries and humiliations of this desperate crisis, he
  preserved with enthusiastic fortitude his passionate adherence to his own
  ideals of honour and duty. His first care had been to complete the
  inundations&mdash;Holland's sole means of defence; his second to reconstruct
  the army that it might be in condition to meet the enemy by the time these
  would be able to cross the ice of winter; he dismissed all the officers
  attached to the former Government&mdash;the creatures of John de Witt; he put
  back into their old places the old régime of aristocratic officers of loyal
  Orangist families; surrounded himself with his own friends and men on whose
  loyalty, integrity and courage he could rely; his party, which had been out
  of power for twenty years, was restored. William III made every effort to
  replace the army on the footing which it had held under Frederic Henry and
  William II. Men like Zuylestein, Odyck, Ouwerkerk, Count Homes, Count
  Waldeck, Prince John Maurice of Nassau-Siegen, his brother Count George
  Frederic of Nassau-Siegen, and Scottish officers like Sir Alexander Colyear
  were placed in high responsible positions; all the officers who had been
  lacking in their duty during the late disasters were cashiered,
  court-martialled and in many cases executed. The severest measures were taken
  to quell insubordination, carelessness and neglect. Such was the enthusiasm
  for the new Stadtholder that the peasants and burghers who had fled under the
  late confused Government now willingly offered themselves to march under the
  Prince's orders. North Holland undertook to furnish thirty thousand men
  alone; this revival of patriotism and courage spread rapidly throughout the
  country and heartened every one.</p>

  <p>With arrogant generosity that was supposed to show the contempt he had for
  a nation he had so easily and quickly vanquished, Louis XIV, before returning
  to France, sent back to Holland nearly twenty thousand prisoners of war which
  he had taken, for the low ransom of two crowns a head for the privates, many
  of them, however, being allowed to return without any ransom at all. Out of
  this large body of men the Prince of Orange quickly recruited a new army,
  which was augmented by many French deserters who came over, tempted by better
  pay. In a few weeks, with every circumstance against him and faced by an
  active enemy, the young Prince showed himself a born leader of men, an
  organizer of genius, by beginning to model his army into an instrument that
  evoked the admiration of all. There was no longer any faint-heartedness, any
  discouragement, any talk of peace or submission. The influence of the Prince
  of Orange was equally fortunate for the Dutch Republic as it was abroad; the
  Netherlands had again a head&mdash;a Prince of Royal blood&mdash;who was
  treated in the courts of Europe with a respect which had not been shown since
  the death of the last Stadtholder. The Elector of Brandenburg, the Queen of
  Spain, and the Emperor were all alike encouraged to assist a nation which was
  now under a definite authority and commanded by a man who had already shown
  such constancy and fortitude, such qualities of penetrating perception, of
  cool, balanced judgment in moments of desperate crisis, who displayed a
  courage so unshakable, a gift of leadership so unquestioned.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

  <p>While William III was thus occupied holding the water-line, re-organizing
  the army, and in negotiations with the Emperor and the Elector of
  Brandenburg, and the Governor of the Spanish Netherlands, Count de Monterey,
  for the speedy sending of reinforcements, spending days and often nights in
  an incessant toil which amazed those who knew the delicacy of his health,
  inspiring every one by his mere presence and his dauntless enthusiasm, he
  also used his utmost power to restore some measure of order to the internal
  distractions of his wretched country, and to arrest the violence of the
  people to which he did not wish to owe his elevation.</p>

  <p>On a medal struck at this time to commemorate his election to the
  Stadtholdership was the proud and challenging motto: "Not by favour nor by
  force "&mdash;inferring that he had inherited his dignities by right. Those
  who had been his opponents made the most abject submission to their new
  master. The register of the Perpetual Edict was torn up and each leaf of it
  returned to the Deputies of the towns who had signed it. The town of
  Amsterdam burnt the Act by which years ago they had engaged to maintain that
  law, and made to William III the humblest protestations of fidelity and
  obedience, even suggesting that he should be elected hereditary Count of
  Holland, while the deputies of Dordtrecht showed themselves anxious that he
  should marry and that a presumptive heir should be chosen to ensure the
  continuation of his dynasty.</p>

  <p>The infuriated people, seeing themselves overwhelmed by all manner of
  ruin, were not satisfied by these concessions, which they looked upon as mere
  cowardly admissions of failure; the repressed passions of twenty years were
  not so easily soothed. The majority had their revenge on the minority, on a
  policy with which they had never agreed and which had nearly proved fatal. At
  Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Gouda and Schiedam, dangerous riots broke out.
  Magistrates were insulted and houses pillaged. The family of the Grand
  Pensionary, John de Witt, who still held that position, as he had left the
  question of his resignation in abeyance for a month, was particularly the
  subject of the hatred and fury of the rabble. The country was almost in a
  state of anarchy; the Dutch had an unforgivable wrong to avenge, and nothing
  but blood could appease their rage. They had been betrayed, they thought, not
  only to disaster but to shame, not only to ruin but to degradation. John de
  Witt and the Republican party had delivered them over to all the humiliation
  of defeat, lost them their place among nations, the respect of their
  neighbours and their national honour. While looking with frantic devotion to
  William of Orange to restore all these, they were resolved not to be cheated
  of their vengeance. The States General could do nothing to redress these
  disorders directed against themselves; they issued a desperate appeal to
  William III, who published a circular in which he exonerated the magistrates
  from the charge of treason hurled at them by the people, and demanded that
  they should be protected, ordered all those who had been arrested by the
  rabble to be set at liberty, and enjoined the inhabitants to avoid, as an
  attempt against his authority, all tumultuous meetings and acts of
  violence.</p>

  <p>This was the utmost the young Stadtholder could do to restore order, but
  it was more or less useless, public passions had gone too far&mdash;he could
  not restrain his own partisans who denounced his manifesto as either
  magnanimous generosity or a forgery. The States then sent three members of
  the Assembly to William III, urging him to carry on in his own name the
  persecution of the leaders of the revolt. William III, with that shrewd
  common sense and that candid simplicity which he never failed to apply to the
  most intricate questions, and which was often mistaken for dissimulation,
  answered that he had no power to repress revolts which were headed by the
  principal citizens themselves, nor to put down as mere mob riots disturbances
  in which half the responsible inhabitants of the country were involved. He
  advised the States to appoint special deputies to whom they would give full
  power to establish order in the centres where the disorders were most
  violent. This the States did not dare to do, knowing that their
  representatives would meet with an ugly death wherever they might show their
  face on such an errand; the expression "torn to pieces by the people" was
  frequently used. The frightened Deputies begged that the Prince would himself
  tour the country and endeavour to restore order. This William III declined to
  do, declaring that his presence was necessary in the army. He must, besides,
  have known that it would be a task as ungraceful and thankless as useless. On
  the further entreaties of the States General he advised kindness and
  moderation, and refused to send any troops for the repression of the rioters,
  saying that all his available resources were necessary for the holding of the
  water-line, which was obviously and painfully true.</p>

  <p>His opponents did not fail to accuse him of evading the issue and of
  rather rejoicing in the helplessness of the States, and secretly, as it were,
  of encouraging the violence of those who were his supporters. But it is
  difficult to see how he could have acted otherwise; not only would it have
  been impossible for him to perhaps betray those to whom he owed his elevation
  by violent measures taken against them, but the state of excitement in the
  country was obviously so strong that the only course was to allow it to
  expend itself; to attempt to restore order by a use of the standing army
  which was still in process of formation and training was an absurd
  suggestion; at the best it could only have meant an undignified and hopeless
  contest between the soldiers and citizens, which would have given the enemy
  every chance of completing the havoc he had begun.</p>

  <p>Charles II was still endeavouring to seduce his nephew by a secret
  correspondence full of goodwill. William III sent the letters to the
  Secretary of the States General, Gaspard Fagel, with the object, probably, of
  avoiding any future accusation that he had been in secret correspondence with
  the enemy of the Republic. The letters from the English monarch, full of
  insincere flatteries, contained expressions that seemed to cast the present
  misfortunes of the Republic on to the Loevensteyn faction. Charles II
  declared "that the constant and insolent machinations of which the Prince of
  Orange was the victim at the hands of those who had formerly so great a share
  in the government of the Republic had obliged him to ally himself with the
  King of France for the sole purpose of lowering their pride." Gaspard Fagel
  made public these letters, and they further served yet more to inflame the
  rage of the people against their late Government. At this crisis, already
  acute, two further incidents helped to bring matters to a deadly pitch; one
  was the escape of Montbas. This man had been court-martialled for abandoning
  his post on the Rhine, he had been degraded, but William III had not been
  satisfied with the verdict, and had refused to sanction it. A fresh sentence
  of fifteen years' imprisonment was pronounced by the court-martial. His
  Highness still demanded greater severity. The unfortunate Montbas, believing
  that his life was in danger, contrived to escape by bribing his guards. He
  fled to the French lines and offered his services to the Duke of Luxembourg
  and the Prince of Condé, promising to give them means to facilitate the
  attack on the Dutch by all the resources in his power, both to harass the
  enemy at their posts and to sow dissension among them. Montbas was a
  Frenchman by birth, and now made common cause with his countrymen, to revenge
  himself, he declared, for the persecution to which he had been subjected by
  the Prince of Orange. His conduct was, however, that of a traitor, and raised
  the suspicion that he had been all along in the confidence of the French and
  justified the intense dislike which William III had always manifested towards
  him. When he was safely in Utrecht he had the impudence to write to the
  Prince of Orange to ask permission to call out the four officers who had
  conducted his court-martial. William III returned his letter by the
  Provost-Marshal.</p>

  <p>Towards cowards and traitors he was always implacable; tolerant and
  magnanimous as was his nature, disdainful of injuries done to himself, he had
  no pity for the weak or the false who hindered the cause to which he had
  devoted his genius. Pieter de Groot he had always regarded as the head of the
  Peace party, and he had openly named him, in the States General, as having
  exceeded his powers during the wretched negotiations with Louis XIV; Gaspard
  Fagel, the Prince's staunch supporter, also disliked, and perhaps was jealous
  of, De Groot, and both he and the Stadtholder profoundly distrusted his
  policies; Louis XIV was known to be friendly towards him, and it was believed
  that he might attempt to re-open negotiations with that monarch. Aware of the
  power and dislike of the Prince and Fagel, Secretary to the States General,
  Pieter de Groot, odious to his country, as the brother-in-law of Montbas, and
  the plenipotentiary who had waited on Louis XIV at Utrecht, and who had
  brought back that monarch's insolent demands to the States General, now fled
  the country and retired to the Spanish Netherlands; William III's influence
  caused him to be sent from this retreat and he retired to Cologne. Though he
  was a patriotic man of untarnished honour, his flight could not, in the
  excited temper of the times, fail to lend colour to the report that he also
  was a French spy; he certainly did not display much courage, though he may
  have been convinced that he had cause to dread assassination. Both his escape
  and the open treachery of Montbas reacted with deadly vehemence on John de
  Witt, the intimate friend of each, who was now, with the utmost malice and
  fury, openly accused of being in the pay of the French. All manner of vile
  accusations were hurled against the unfortunate statesman who had served his
  country so disinterestedly and honestly and to the best of his great
  abilities, and who now, in the fury of a few weeks, saw his entire life-work
  destroyed, and all his ideals brought to nothing. Not only was he accused of
  being in agreement with the invaders, but of taking secret service money and
  sending it to a bank in Venice, that he might take up his residence in Italy
  after the conquest of the United Provinces for which he had arranged.</p>

  <p>Judging from the correspondence between Luxembourg and Louvois, it seems
  there was some ground for these atrocious calumnies, and that when Louis XIV
  found the young Prince of Orange was incorruptible he did endeavour to stir
  up strife in Holland, and possibly to ruin the young Stadtholder by
  reanimating the Loevensteyn party and bribing John de Witt into compliance
  with his wishes, by offering him the restoration of his authority. John de
  Witt, apparently, did not go far with these negotiations, and there is no
  proof that he endeavoured to save himself by tampering with the enemy. At the
  time, however, the foulest reports were not only spread but believed. And
  beneath all lies and all slanders was this fundamental truth&mdash;the
  terrible catastrophe which had overtaken the Dutch Republic was entirely
  owing to the policy of the unfortunate Grand Pensionary, by which he had
  entirely weakened the defences of the country through his anxiety to keep out
  the Prince of Orange from all power and to weaken the army to prevent a
  recurrence of the <i>coup d'état</i> of 1650. Reduced to despair by the
  tumult of passion raging round him, the fallen minister wrote to the only man
  whose voice could be heard amidst the clamour of his enemies, the young
  Stadtholder, and asked him to exonerate him, John de Witt, from the base
  charges made against him. William III asked the advice of old Constantine
  Huygens, the faithful and valued friend and mentor of the House of Nassau, as
  to how he should reply to this letter. Huygens advised that it should go
  unanswered, and added, in a letter to His Highness, without month or address,
  headed "16th, 1672," "that his letter to the towns had caused vexation to the
  well-intentioned, and that it were wise not to annoy them further by
  supporting De Witt to again cause displeasure to the people by declarations
  contrary to their humour to which one has some obligation." In thus appealing
  to his former pupil, who was now the only man in the country with a vestige
  of authority, John de Witt had expected too much. What he appeared to have
  demanded in the letter&mdash;now no longer to be found&mdash;was the complete
  exoneration from all the charges, not only of complicity with the French, and
  the taking of the secret service money, but of neglect in the army and the
  fortifications. For the Stadtholder to have responded to this appeal in the
  manner in which John de Witt wished him to respond, would have been for him
  to have borne false witness, to have declared what was palpably untrue, and
  what hardly anyone would have believed; even when he received the letter from
  John de Witt, William III was involved in the almost hopeless task of
  reconstructing the army and repairing the fortifications. He could not with
  the least sincerity have publicly stated that John de Witt had done his duty
  in either of these directions, nor have absolved him of all responsibility
  for the present disaster. He would not take refuge in silence; William
  replied after ten days' delay in a letter remarkably able, honourable and
  prudent, which seemed more like the composition of a trained diplomat than of
  a boy of twenty-one.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Sir,&mdash;I have received your letter of the 12th instant
  and the pasquinade which accompanied it. I should not have failed to answer
  it sooner had not the multiplicity of my occupations prevented it. I can
  assure you that I have always despised reports which have started in this
  manner, since not only my family, but I myself, have been several times
  attacked with a freedom and avidity beyond all bounds. As to the two points
  of which you make mention in yours, namely, your handling of the secret
  service money and the little care you are reported to have taken in providing
  the army with all requirements, I can only say that as to the first I have no
  knowledge of it. The Deputies of the States, as you very properly observe in
  yours, could best testify to this and anything else. As to the second, I
  cannot, and do not, doubt that you took such care of the army and the navy of
  the States both by land and sea as the condition of affairs and of the times
  would allow and in such a manner as they should have been capable of
  resisting the enemy. But you must be aware yourself that it would be
  Impossible to specify all that may have been wanting, particularly with the
  land forces, and to verify either the trouble taken to supply the
  deficiencies which were afterwards discovered, and that which might or ought
  to have been taken at the time, or determine who was in fault. I am so taken
  up with business in these unhappy and troublesome times that I have involved
  myself as little as possible in looking into the past. You will therefore
  find a much better justification in your past acts and wisdom than in
  anything you can obtain from me. I trust with all my heart that I shall have
  some other opportunity of proving myself.<br>
  <br>
  "Your affectionate friend,<br>
  "WILLIAM HENRY,<br>
  "Prince of Orange."</p>

  <p>This proud epistle, with its absence of either direct reproach or direct
  exoneration, was, of course, charged with dissimulation; it appears, however,
  to have been perfectly frank and sincere.</p>

  <p>William III did not believe that John de Witt had actually betrayed his
  country, either by taking bribes or through neglect; on the other hand, he
  was only too bitterly well aware with what imprudence the defence of the
  frontier had been conducted, and he was, as he himself truly said, too
  absorbed in the enormous responsibilities which had developed upon him to be
  enabled to go into the past.</p>

  <p>At this tense and bitter moment the popular rage and lust for vengeance
  seemed suddenly to have found a victim&mdash;not in John de Witt, but in his
  brother, the gallant Cornelius de Witt, Ruard of Putten. A certain barber, by
  name Michael Tichelaer, appeared at the Prince's camp, sought out Zuylestein,
  and informed him of a supposed plot against the Prince's life, declaring that
  Cornelius de Witt had engaged him to assassinate the Prince, either by dagger
  or poison. The accuser was a man of infamous life, and the accusation wild
  and absurd. Zuylestein sent him to the judges at the Hague. His disposition
  was received, and a warrant was secretly sent to bring Cornelius de Witt
  before the Court. The story that Tichelaer had to tell was grotesque in its
  improbability. He was known to have a malice against the Ruard, who, in his
  capacity as Ruard of Putten, had judged him for several offences. It seemed
  impossible to John de Witt that the flimsy nature of the evidence against his
  brother could have any result except the immediate acquittal of Cornelius.
  This, however, was not so. The judges, puzzled and terrified by the attitude
  of the people who were hostile to John and Cornelius de Witt, perhaps
  honestly believing, such was the excitement of the moment, in the
  preposterous story put forward by the barber, committed both Cornelius de
  Witt and Tichelaer to the gloomy Spanish prison of the Gevangenpoort, or
  Prison Gate, at the entrance to the Binnenhof, while the States pursued the
  policy which they had taken up since William came to power and appealed in
  their difficulty to the Stadtholder. The young Prince, however, refused to
  incur the odium of interference; not only was he absorbed by his overwhelming
  tasks, but he was in no position to adjudge of the truth of the matter; his
  enemies declared that he had coldly echoed the words with which John de Witt
  had left the young Jacob Van der Graaf to his fate, and said "That justice
  must run its course."</p>

  <p>On July 21st/July 31st the young Stadtholder arrived at the Hague and the
  Grand Pensionary hastened to wait on him, in an endeavour, it is supposed,
  although no authentic information of the interview remains, to placate the
  Prince by offering him his final resignation, which was evidently accepted,
  the Prince referring the fallen Grand Pensionary to the State of Holland.
  John de Witt, the day following, entered the Assembly of States to give this
  formal and final resignation, vindicating himself and his policy in an
  eloquent speech, which was reprinted in pamphlet form.</p>

  <p>No fall could have been more complete, no tragedy more bitter, than this
  of John de Witt. In the words of Wicquefort, "He saw his plans undermined,
  the principles of his conduct destroyed, and an extraordinary change of scene
  in which he now only played the ridiculous part of dummy where he had once
  been the principal performer."</p>

  <p>He asked no reward for his long and zealous services, except the office of
  judge in either of the two courts in which he might choose to sit; this was
  granted him and a formal vote of thanks for his services tendered, but by the
  wish of the Prince of Orange the congratulations addressed to the Grand
  Pensionary in 1668 were not renewed. John de Witt did not complain because
  William of Orange thus prevented the States from leaving on record any public
  testimony of esteem. He knew that the Prince as well as the people ascribed
  to him, as he himself said in a letter he wrote to De Ruyter, "all the
  disasters which have befallen the Republic." It was not a moment in which the
  fallen statesmen could expect from anybody expressions of trust and
  gratitude.</p>

  <p>The Stadtholder took little direct interest in the stormy affairs of
  internal politics which had not much bearing on the matter he had in hand.
  Prince John Maurice was expecting an attack from Luxembourg; the castle of
  Croenburg had fallen; news was coming in that the thin lines of defence might
  be smitten by enemies crossing the waters in boats; the troops before Muyden
  had a formula of prayer in which they prayed to Almighty God "for the
  fatherland, fallen into the hands of the enemy."</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

  <p>The voice of the people which had proclaimed so swiftly and so surely and
  so unanimously the triumph of a military government, the ruin of the policy
  of which John de Witt and his party had devoted their lives, proclaimed also
  with continuous and irrepressible menaces their desire, their need for
  vengeance. William III, invested with supreme authority, military and
  political power in his hands, did not hesitate to reveal his intentions to
  use this authority and this power according to his own ideals of government.
  He had undertaken to save his country, but he would save her on his own
  terms; his personal heroic resolution was equalled by the stern severity he
  showed to all cowards, traitors or weaklings; court-martials and executions
  were still frequent in his camp, he always pressed for the extremity of
  punishment on all deserters and traitors; the goods smuggled out of abandoned
  towns were confiscated for the good of the States; magistrates who had fled
  their posts arrested. He believed that only supreme sacrifice and supreme
  fortitude could save the country, and he did not hesitate to give the example
  and to see that others followed it. Stern measures were taken against all
  those supposed traitors, and, at least, cowards, who had so easily delivered
  the northern towns of Overyssel, Deventer, Campen and Zwolle to the enemy,
  and by the Prince's orders the burgomasters and those in authority and
  responsible citizens who had fled before the approach of the enemy taking
  their goods with them, were not only to be arrested themselves, but these
  same goods seized and sold for the benefit of the State. William III offered
  for the service of his country, then nearly bankrupt, the salary that was due
  to him as Stadtholder and Captain- and Admiral-General, and added to this his
  share of any prizes that might be taken by sea or any booty which might be
  taken by land. His attitude was not only one of the sternest defiance of the
  foe, but of the strictest integrity towards his countrymen; he did not spare
  himself nor anyone else; he was in the saddle by day and often by night,
  riding from outpost to outpost, inspecting fortification after fortification,
  reviewing troops, replacing officers, presiding at military courts, sending
  instructions to the disorganized towns, replacing the panic-stricken
  magistrates with men upon whom he could rely; in the course of a few weeks he
  had entirely changed the spirit and temper of the country. The severest of
  his measures was frantically applauded by the majority of the people who
  rejoiced to see themselves represented by this stern, warlike and commanding
  figure. They delighted to behold the traitors and cowards scattered before
  his wrath; they felt that they were regaining their honour and prestige;
  their anticipation of a glorious deliverance was so lively that it was like a
  present victory; the Orange flag, the arms of Nassau, which now bedecked
  every fort and town not in the hands of the enemy, were symbols not only of a
  great House, but of all the virtues. William III had roused the ancient
  spirit of the Dutch and inspired them with that unconquerable courage which
  refuses to see, as he had himself proudly declared, "that all is lost." With
  such a spirit indeed nothing could be lost. But while the people rejoiced to
  see the traitors, the idle, the careless, and the lukewarm brought to
  justice, they did not intend that the two men whom they considered to be the
  two main offenders of all should escape.</p>

  <p>John de Witt had failed; statesmen usually pay a high price for failure;
  no matter his industry, his devotion, his honesty, his capacity, his
  firmness, his long and powerful administration, he had failed; he had
  dedicated his talents, his virtues to a policy that had been mistaken and out
  of joint with the times; and he had maintained this policy with an inflexible
  obstinacy which had roused the worst passions of his opponents. His friends,
  Montbas and De Groot, had fled; the people felt cheated of their prey and did
  not intend that the brothers De Witt should escape so easily. The question of
  the powder was brought up; it seemed a damning circumstance added to many
  other damning circumstances that John de Witt should have been so easily
  fooled as to permit the United Provinces to be despoiled of all the contents
  of her arsenals; it was hotly declared that some one had played the traitor
  in allowing the French to buy up all the powder in the country; many did not
  hesitate to credit that this traitor had been John de Witt. It was also
  firmly believed that the De Witt brothers and what remained of their faction
  were still secretly intriguing against the new Stadtholder. William III had
  inherited confidence and popularity, as John de Witt had inherited fury and
  hate. The phoenix which had been shown constantly on the medals struck in
  honour of His Highness was no idle figure&mdash;the Dutch did, in fact,
  believe that they saw in him a resurrection of his glorious ancestors whose
  genius had been the foundation of their country; William III also possessed
  those qualities which most appeal to the Dutch&mdash;patience, fortitude,
  honesty, simplicity, austerity of manner, and a private life free from all
  reproach. His slight figure in the uniform of the Blue Guards, the Orange
  sash and the Ribbon and Star of the Garter, his virile, ascetic features,
  eyes so brilliant and fiery, shaded by the long aristocratic curls, became
  the very symbol of pride and victory; familiar immediately from a hundred
  engravings. Within a few months his remarkable knowledge of military affairs,
  his stern discipline, his genius for leadership, his fine
  horsemanship&mdash;he had the great advantage of superb accomplishment in all
  the arts of the <i>haute école</i>-his indifference to fatigue and
  discomfort, had made him adored by the soldiery. When he briefly appeared in
  the Hague he was surrounded by enthusiastic admirers who insisted on
  escorting him from the Binnenhof to his apartments. The slightest rumour of
  any plot against his authority or his person was sufficient to send into
  furies not only the rabble but respectable and highly-placed citizens. On one
  occasion when such a tale was current the people insisted that His Highness
  should be accompanied by a body of Guards, and these not being immediately
  available the citizens themselves formed into an escort which took His
  Highness to the House in the Wood, where he was about to visit Amalia of
  Solms-Braunfels, and waited outside until he had dined, and then escorted him
  back to the Hague. Their passion of love and gratitude was further inflamed
  by the indifference with which it was received.</p>

  <p>William III's pride was unmixed with any vanity; he wished for no thanks,
  for no gratitude, and he intensely disliked emotional display. He did what he
  could to restore order and preserve the respect due to the law and
  magistrates; to have repressed violently or even harshly the outbursts of
  popular feeling would have been to discountenance his own words, to deny his
  own ideals. He desired to inspire in the people his spirit of resistance, to
  fill them with scorn for the weakling and the traitor, to unite them all in
  an animated struggle against the oppressor. The state of the country was
  still not only dire but almost desperate, and only by rousing the utmost
  enthusiasm could William III have aspired to defend or sell as dearly as
  possible what remained of the United Provinces before the Allies from
  Brandenburg, Spain and the Empire arrived to reinforce his most inadequate
  army. His only hope in the audacious struggle he had undertaken when he had
  flung down the gage both to Louis XIV and Charles II lay in inspiring his
  countrymen with some of his own indomitable fortitude, his courage at once
  enterprising and audacious, patient and laborious. His own honour, cold and
  haughty, could not tolerate dishonour in others; his own courage, which
  during all his life was never to falter before any test however terrible (for
  of him it might truly be said that he was fearless), would not suffer the
  least shade of cowardice in others. Braving his own physical sufferings, the
  humiliations, the disabilities, of his weak health, sparing himself nothing,
  either in fortune, in fatigue, in sacrifice, he demanded that his followers
  should be of the like temper. His lonely boyhood, the absence of all feminine
  influence, the peculiarly stern yet simple qualities of his mind and
  character had sent his passionate nature into warm friendships with
  men&mdash;friendships to which he was obstinately faithful to the end of his
  life. Apart from the young aristocratic soldiers who were his natural
  companions, statesmen like Amerongen, Dyckfeldt, Beverningh and Gaspard Fagel
  were willing to serve him to the utmost of their capacity, for his qualities
  were such as inspired respect, admiration and almost reverence in upright and
  intelligent men.</p>

  <p>Despite this heroic temper, the misfortunes of the Prince of Orange and
  his country seemed now at their depths. No stranger, viewing the situation,
  would have thought there was the least hope for the United Provinces, nor for
  the young Stadtholder if he chose to link his destiny to that of his country.
  The only possibility of William III retaining his place among the princes of
  Europe seemed to lie in his linking himself with Louis XIV or Charles II, who
  had never ceased to endeavour to seduce him in the most delicate and subtle
  manner, by flattery, by bribes, by subtle reasoning. "What can you
  do&mdash;do you not see it is lost?" the cynical words of Buckingham must
  have often rung in the ears of the young Prince. But there was one thing a
  Prince of Orange could do to see that it was not lost, and that was to die,
  "in the last ditch," as he had said dryly; and his intimates well knew that
  he was prepared to go to these extremities.</p>

  <p>On August 20th/30th, the Captain-General was inspecting the fortifications
  of Woerden, which was outside the lines of defence. On the 12th/22nd he had
  been rapturously received at Amsterdam, five days later he had been at the
  Hague. He returned to his headquarters at Alphen, near Bodegraven, and as he
  was sitting down to supper a messenger arrived from the Hague with news from
  the State of Holland, relating that John de Witt and his brother Cornelius
  had been murdered by the rabble. William III was overcome with emotion on
  hearing of the tragic death of his two enemies, which was as horrible as it
  was unexpected; he lost his usual composure and seemed for the moment
  overwhelmed. He had been with the States General two days before, and the
  last news of the two unfortunate brothers was that they were about to quit
  the Netherlands, for Cornelius, by an infamous sentence of the court, had had
  his goods confiscated and been banished his country. While he was still
  lodging in the Gevangenpoort, suffering from the results of the atrocious
  torture to which he had been subjected, he had sent for his brother John, who
  with his family was still living in the house at the Kneuterdyk. Upon the
  rabble hearing that the two detested statesmen were together in the prison
  they had gathered round the building, and the end of a day of horrible
  rioting, menace, excitement and hellish fury had been that the unfortunate De
  Witts were dragged out from the prison and foully murdered, their bodies,
  after being subject to the most odious ill-treatment, dismembered and in
  every way dishonoured; it was not until late in the night that a lackey was
  able to come and collect the remains for burial in the New Church.</p>

  <p>Such is the outline of this ghastly tragedy which threw a shade of
  dishonour over the entire nation, and for which the Prince of Orange was, as
  he must have known he would be, severely blamed; the wild rumours of the time
  went so far as to accuse him and Zuylestein of having sent servants, or even
  of having been there in disguise, to ferment the fury of the rabble. Such a
  crime was not only foreign to the character of the Prince, but it was not
  even to his interests; the De Witts were powerless to harm him any more.
  Never in any action of his life did he show vindictiveness, nor a desire for
  revenge; magnanimity was one of his leading characteristics. His cold,
  indifferent tolerance to those who worked him evil again and again
  exasperated his friends. Such an accusation, therefore, of complicity in the
  murder of the De Witts was on the face of it absurd, but naturally it did not
  fail to be made and repeated again and again; nor has it, until recent years,
  been utterly disproved in such a fashion as to silence the most malignant
  slanderer.</p>

  <p>William III never allowed any insults to the memory of his fallen
  opponents. He often expressed his opinion that John de Witt was an honourable
  man, and his opposition to himself had arisen from no personal hatred, and
  that he "had always considered John de Witt as one of the greatest men of his
  time, and a faithful servant of the States."</p>

  <p>Such was the popular fury against the brothers De Witt that even their
  massacre did not satisfy the blood lust of the people. They broke into the
  church where their remains were buried and tore into splinters the escutcheon
  hanging up in the church; as if, as a contemporary historian says, "they
  would root out their memory if they could, as well as their lives from the
  earth."</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>This deed, so horrible as to be almost incredible, did not, nevertheless,
  excite universal execration, the kinsfolk of the De Witts did not, owing to
  the intemperance of the times, dare to appear in mourning, and a Dutchman,
  writing three years after the event, could say, "Strangers spoke of the
  transaction as their temperaments led them, some, as an act of chivalry for
  the restoration of our suppressed liberties; others did not commend or would
  not blame it, but looked upon it as a special judgment on them; many
  condemned the whole action, fearing the destruction of the whole land would
  follow thereupon, but those that seemed the most impartial judged that at
  this conjunction of time it was a good service to the land that these men
  were removed, though they were the greatest wits and politicians of the
  world," which shows how general was the detestation of the Grand Pensionary's
  policy, how completely he had lost credit, save among a few, how largely he
  was held responsible for the disasters of his country. The temper of men, not
  inflamed by political passion, gave him due credit for his great gifts, his
  clear honesty, his lucid intelligence; those employed by the States to search
  through his papers in the hopes that there they might find something to his
  discredit had reported that they had discovered nothing "but honour and
  virtue."</p>

  <p>The day after the murder the young Stadtholder hastened to the Hague and
  found the town in a state of panic, the magistrates helpless, the people
  still furious. The authorities, who by their own feeble conduct, cowardice
  and hesitancy, had permitted the tragedy to take place, now tried to shift
  the blame on to the shoulders of the Stadtholder, begging him to repress the
  violence of the crowd and punish the ringleaders of the horrible deed which
  had taken place yesterday. William III formally declined to undertake the
  task, which, indeed, would have been, in the state of affairs, hopeless. He
  suggested that if the magistrates could not keep order they should resign.
  The ringleaders of the crime, the principal of which was Michael Tichelaer,
  the infamous accuser of Cornelius de Witt, were mostly obscure ruffians who
  had used the heated feelings of the moment to vent their own private spite
  and furies. But such were the passions and confusion of the times that it was
  not considered advisable to distinguish these from their fellows, nor in such
  a moment to make examples of anyone who had shown himself in favour of the
  Stadtholder. This policy, however expedient it may have appeared at the
  moment, proved itself to be false; for it helped to attach the stigma of the
  crime to William III. All historians agree in blaming him in not acting with
  greater severity towards the assassins of his opponents. In not doing so he
  showed a carelessness towards his own fame, and in observing towards the men
  who had massacred the brothers De Witt that same cold indifference he had
  shown towards all who had attempted to murder him, he gave an opportunity to
  his enemies to wound his reputation with a lasting reproach. The whole affair
  is obscure. No good reason has yet been discovered why these men were not
  only allowed to escape punishment, but some of them even rewarded; what has 4
  been made abundantly clear is that no one premeditated the crime, which was
  the result of sheer mob violence, and almost, given the condition of affairs,
  inevitable.</p>

  <p>It is impossible in cold blood to envisage the ruined state of the
  country, the fury of the people, their conviction that they had been
  betrayed, the intense excitement pre-vailing, the confusion, the weakness of
  the magistrates that made such a deed possible; the repressed rages of twenty
  years found vent on that terrible day, August 20, 1672, and in a fashion too
  horrid to dwell on; what is even more remarkable than the murder is the
  comparative indifference with which the distracted country received it;
  political assassination surprised no one, and since the invasion the people
  had become used to blood and horror.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

  <p>In the youthful warrior-statesman, who had appeared at such an astonishing
  moment, and in such an astonishing fashion, among what Europe took to be the
  ruins of the Netherlands, Leopold I, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire,
  thought that he had found a champion and, perhaps, a proxy&mdash;a man who
  might be capable of embroiling the whole of Europe in the old question of the
  supremacy of the House of Hapsburg or the supremacy of the House of Bourbon;
  the long duel which dated back to the days of Charles V and Francis I,
  between Austria and France, was about to be renewed (the genius of William of
  Orange saw his own count in such a struggle) and to be diffused over the
  whole of the civilized world. William III had invoked the help of His Most
  Catholic Majesty for his country against His Most Christian Majesty, of the
  Emperor against the King of France. Neither the character nor the habits of
  Leopold I could enable him to take any personal part in the struggle. His
  short reign had been exhausting and almost disastrous; not only had he
  perpetually to fight for an existence against the Turkish invasion (which
  Louis XIV was believed to encourage), but he had had to suppress a long,
  fierce and desperate revolt of the Protestants in Hungary, of which country
  he hoped to secure the hereditary crown. Leopold Ignatius of Hapsburg had
  been bred for the Church and had only been elected Emperor on the decease of
  his elder brother, Ferdinand III. He had his full share of the apathetic
  Hapsburg pride, he was indolent and affable, gloomy and austere, admitting no
  equal in the world save the Pope, living in the midst of war, revolution,
  political tumults; to his friends and servants agreeable and generous, but
  lending his name to the most revolting cruelties; Leopold I, though a sincere
  Roman Catholic, did not refuse to take as his champion the young Calvinistic
  Prince, nor to use the resources of the Dutch Republic against a fellow Roman
  Catholic monarch; he could never forgive Louis XIV for the attempt that
  Mazarin had made to get him elected to the throne that he himself now held;
  to be Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire might be a shadowy pretension, but it
  was one which the Hapsburgs, the oldest reigning dynasty in Europe, so long
  successful, so long fortunate, were resolved to uphold, and the Emperor saw
  clearly enough that the insolent attempt of Louis XIV on the Spanish
  Netherlands was a bid for the Spanish monarchy and a direct challenge to his
  dynasty; Leopold, bigoted and closely allied to the Papal See, had also
  keenly resented the haughty attempts of Louis XIV to deny the supremacy of
  the Pope and his overbearing carriage towards the Vatican; Leopold's
  character, melancholy, lethargic, easy, without either energy or talents, was
  not without grandeur and obstinacy; he was prepared to go any lengths to
  defend his dignities and family, and he both despised and detested the King
  of France, who seemed to him a mere upstart of odious pretensions. In 1672 he
  was thirty-two years old, he had been King of Hungary and Bohemia since he
  was sixteen, and Emperor since he was eighteen; all his reign had been
  occupied by wars in which he had taken little personal part; he had not been
  trained for either war or government, but he was skilled in metaphysics and
  theology and the glorious history of his ancestors; his person was
  impressive, his swarthy, gloomy, underjawed face as notable, as definite as
  his own heraldic device, the Imperial eagle; with that countenance he could
  not have been less than a Hapsburg, less than an Emperor; he appeared on
  occasion in almost Eastern splendour, but was usually simply attired, though
  he affected the scarlet stockings worn by the Emperors and the perpetual
  sparkle of the Golden Fleece; he was not unattractive, and he filled, with
  imposing dignity, his symbolic part of Imperial Caesar; his leisure was
  occupied by music and other arts.</p>

  <p>While his influence and his example were shifting slowly but definitely
  the whole scene of European politics, William III had not been personally
  idle. Not only did he organize his army into an admirable instrument, but as
  Admiral-General he rendered his country services no less valuable; through
  his influence the two famous admirals, De Ruyter and Tromp, who had long
  since been enemies, were reconciled, and, inspired by the example of the
  young Stadtholder, united to work keenly together to preserve the discipline
  of the Fleet that lay watching the flat coasts of Holland.</p>

  <p>William III's personal toil was incessant; on foot, on horseback,
  inspecting fortifications, reviewing troops, hastening from town to town to
  reorganize the magistrates, gathering into his hands those delicate threads
  of international politics that he was to hold so firmly all his life, writing
  letters, dictating despatches, giving interviews, attending the sittings of
  the States General, the Stadtholder had commenced the life of endless labour
  of mind and body, ceaseless vigilance and unrelaxing fortitude, that was
  henceforth to be his continuous portion. The English King continued to cajole
  and threaten the Prince with the object of making a peace; Lord Arlington
  accused him of intriguing among the English malcontents and dared to menace
  him with the fate of the De Witts if he persisted in a struggle which the
  Dutch must come to see was hopeless...with the first hard frost Luxembourg
  would be at the Hague...William III replied to this in a letter dated
  "October 7, 1672," from his camp at Bodegraven, which enclosed one for
  Charles II, near whom the Prince still kept his faithful friend, M. Van
  Weede, Lord of Renswoude.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Concerning the affairs of which you write I have dealt
  with them in the letter enclosed for His Majesty. I have nothing to add
  except to say I am astonished to learn from M. de Weede, that you seem to
  give faith to those falsehoods which declare I work against the interests of
  the King. Believe me, Monsieur, if every one was as affectionate as myself
  towards the interests of His Majesty, his affairs would not go ill. My soul
  is too well adjusted ('<i>J'ai l'ame trop bien placée</i>') not to respond as
  it ought to the favours His Majesty gives me, and the friendship that he
  displays for me; be assured that I would sacrifice my life for his service
  and that nothing will alter these sentiments, but do not also believe that
  your threats that I shall be torn in pieces by the people gives me much
  alarm; I am not naturally very fearful, though very affectionately yours,
  &amp;c.<br>
  <br>
  "G. PRINCE D'ORANGE."</p>

  <p>This haughty and ironic letter was not insincere; the policy which,
  refusing to divide his interests from those of the Dutch people, William III
  was steadily pursuing&mdash;a union of the two maritime powers, a check to
  France, a restoration of the balance of power in Europe&mdash;might, honestly
  adhered to, have gained the confidence and loyalty of the English parliament
  and people for the English throne, and perhaps have saved the English Crown
  for the Stewarts.</p>

  <p>William III had the support of another general besides the Princes of
  Nassau-Siegen&mdash;that of Count George Frederic, afterwards Prince Waldeck,
  a connection by marriage of the House of Nassau; an experienced soldier not
  loved but respected, not fortunate but trusty, he, like all the men who
  worked under William III, soon conceived a staunch loyalty and deep affection
  for his master and served him to the best of his considerable ability to the
  end of his life, not only in the field but in the Cabinet. It was soon
  reputed that he was the only man to whose military advice the Stadtholder
  listened.</p>

  <p>The Prince kept Waldeck with him at Bodegraven and entrusted him, not only
  with military affairs, but politics. Waldeck was deep in the various
  ramifications of the international intrigues by which His Highness was
  seeking to animate Europe against Louis XIV; this General, then Maréchal de
  Camp, who was more cautious than dashing, more solid than brilliant, was
  perhaps responsible for the advice that William III gave to Prince John
  Maurice of Nassau-Siegen, when that spirited old soldier, still at Muyden,
  wished to fall on the enemy's quarters at Naarden; the Stadtholder considered
  this attractive suggestion too dangerous. A few days later, however, His
  Highness himself resolved to attempt Woerden, the other fort in the vicinity
  held by the French; he believed himself strong enough to take the offensive,
  and burned to display personal activity in the field. Luxembourg was known to
  be endeavouring to throw succours into the town, and the Prince's design was
  to take Woerden by assault before these reinforcements arrived; Prince John
  Maurice was left in command of the Bodegraven camp;
  Zuylestein&mdash;William's trusted one-time governor&mdash;was posted at
  Groven Bridge with the regiment of Salm and a battery, to prevent the succour
  arriving from Utrecht; Count Hornes, moving by a night march from his fort at
  Ouwater, occupied the saw mills at Polanen, near Woerden, and commanded the
  enemy from his vantage ground; William III himself, coming up from
  Bodegraven, was to lead the daring attack in person with command of the main
  body of troops.</p>

  <p>The recently organized Dutch forces were heartened by a partial success of
  a few days before; the French had attacked the pallisades erected by John
  Maurice at Ankeveen and been repulsed with the loss of fifty men, the Dutch
  losing only one officer; they were also animated by the spirit of their young
  leader who had dared this audacious offensive action when his enemies had
  supposed him barely able to hold the defensive. With four regiments the
  Prince advanced to surprise Woerden; it was his first military action, and
  the quality of his courage, which was to amaze the world during a lifetime of
  battles, had not yet been put to the test; he had been for some months in
  command of the Army and had not yet had any opportunity of putting into
  practice his passion for action, which all his life tormented him, as if
  nothing would content his ardent spirit but the utter fatigue of his body;
  even his most favoured diversion was a chase through the wildest country,
  after the most savage animals, when he would ride for hours, using up several
  horses, "all the relays," as he noted, taking the most dangerous leaps over
  hedge and ditch, dismounting and plunging on foot through swamp, stream and
  forest, returning home wet, dishevelled, to fall into a sleep of exhaustion
  in a chair without changing his clothes; this pent-up nervous energy found
  eager vent in the excitement of battle and inspired the Prince to that
  sparkling animation, that joyous enthusiasm in the heat of action that always
  so strangely contrasted with his usual stately composure.</p>

  <p>On the morning of October 11th/21st the watchmen in Woerden saw the Dutch
  approaching and alarmed the garrison with muskets and bells; a hasty beacon
  was lit on one of the ramparts as a signal to Utrecht for help; the wind
  being strong blew this fire back into the town; the church and several houses
  were consumed, the conflagration continuing all day; while the Prince
  advanced from Bodegraven, the French made a sortie to fire the suburbs, but
  the Dutch drove them in again.</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>Luxembourg hurriedly advanced from Utrecht and fell with seven thousand
  picked troops on the Groven bridge which Zuylestein was holding; that
  stalwart soldier, though his forces were outnumbered, beat them off, and
  Luxembourg fell back, while the Prince marched to the assault of the town
  early on the morning of the 12th/22nd, throwing bombs, fireballs and grenades
  into the bastions; the French, sallying out, were driven in with heavy loss;
  the Prince and his guards forced over the outworks to the gates; the Dutch
  began to scale the ramparts while their artillery was furiously battering the
  town. Luxembourg returned to the attack on Zuylestein, who was barring his
  way from Woerden, and, by the help of treacherous peasants, marched along at
  the back of the Dutch quarters by Houdyck and Camerdyck, through morasses
  that were believed to be impassable and water that was knee deep, and so fell
  on Zuylestein from behind where he was unprotected, his cannon being turned
  in the other direction; the small Dutch forces turned ferociously at bay and
  endeavoured to defend themselves against the whole power of Luxembourg; Count
  Hornes hastened up from Polanen to Zuylestein's assistance, and the marines
  under his cornmand fought furiously with knives and rapiers, while the
  companies holding Groven Bridge, under cover of this defence, were able to
  make an orderly retreat, abandoning, however, their cannon and ammunition,
  and leaving many valiant men trampled into the bloody swamps; among these was
  the commanding Colonel himself, Frederic of Nassau, Lord of Zuylestein, who,
  surrounded by the enemy, refused to surrender or to accept quarter, and was
  hacked to pieces in the furious melée; this was a keen personal loss to the
  Prince who had been passionately attached to his uncle; the heroic death of
  this loyal gentleman and brave officer added another name to the list of
  members of the House of Nassau who had with their blood consolidated the
  liberties of the Netherlands.</p>

  <p>Those slanderers who directly connected him with the murder of the De
  Witts pointed out maliciously that here was a judgment from Heaven, for
  Zuylestein had met the same fate as the unfortunate statesman and his
  brother, his body being torn to shreds in the ferocious struggle between the
  Dutch and the French; it has long since been proved that the honour of
  Zuylestein was intact and that he had no complicity whatever in the tragedy
  of the De Witts; he left by his marriage with an Englishwoman, Jane
  Killigrew, one son, William Henry of Nassau-Zuylestein, the same age as the
  Prince, and his close personal friend, a dashing cavalry officer and handsome
  man of fashion, who concealed under a debonair exterior considerable talents,
  prudence and shrewdness, and afterwards became the first Earl of Rochford,
  Viscount Tunbridge, Baron Enfield and Master of the Robes. The motto of
  Frederic of Nassau, Lord of Zuylestein, "Spes durat avorum," was proudly
  upheld by his death, which was worthy of the fair traditions of his father,
  Prince Frederic Henry, his uncle Maurice, and his grandfather William I.</p>

  <p>Luxembourg, having fought through to Woerden, threw such reinforcements
  (three thousand men) into the town that it was useless for William III to
  hope to take it, 4 and a further attempt would have meant that the Dutch
  would share the fate of Zuylestein and be cut to pieces; the Prince therefore
  ordered a retreat upon the "leaguer" posts; the Dutch computed their losses
  at only seven hundred, and that of the French at two thousand; the attempt on
  Woerden is notable, not only as being the first occasion on which William III
  led his men into action, but as his first encounter with Luxembourg, that
  great general with whom he was to contest so many obstinate, bitter fields;
  the moral effect of the engagement was wholly to the advantage of the Dutch;
  their Captain-General had been repulsed, but only after a fight so fierce and
  desperate that it was said thereafter that the Dutch "shot like devils," and
  that in Utrecht the French officers drew lots as to who should take posts
  that were likely to be attacked by the Prince in person.</p>

  <p>Louis XIV now had to face not only the defiance of an obscure, beaten and
  penniless Prince hastily elected to the chief post of a defeated Republic,
  but a formidable coalition of the principal Catholic powers of Europe.
  Charles Stewart was also falling away from the French interest. It was
  obvious to French diplomacy that the King of England would not be able long
  to continue the fight; he had had no naval successes with which to placate
  his people who had been reluctant to enter into this war, and it was obvious
  that the first parliament which was called would begin to treat for peace.
  Through the direct result of the challenge thrown down by the Prince of
  Orange, Louis XIV found himself already being gradually closed into that
  isolation which was before long to leave him alone with all Europe to face in
  battle array. It was an amazing defeat for the policy of France that, despite
  the incomparable address, labour, and ability of their ambassador at Vienna,
  De Grémonville, Leopold had, notwithstanding his treaty of neutrality,
  definitely leagued himself against Louis XIV; all the resources of the active
  and intelligent diplomacy, of the able and brilliant men who served the King
  of France, did not avail to prevent the gathering of a great Imperialist
  army. All that the insinuating subtleties of De Grémonville could accomplish
  was a secret agreement with Leopold I for the division between France and the
  Empire of the kingdom of Spain&mdash;this vast and complicated negotiation
  was made in view of the fact that Carlos II of Spain, then seven years old,
  was not considered likely to live more than a few months, and on each side it
  was made with the usual mental reservations.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

  <p>Immediately after this engagement at Woerden the Prince called his
  officers to Gouda; the results of this council, which was held secretly, was
  the withdrawal of the Dutch cavalry, that had been all the summer watching
  the coast in expectation of an English invasion, from their posts, and the
  sending of them to Brabant; His Highness fixing a general rendezvous for all
  the Dutch forces at Rosendaal on the frontiers of the Spanish Netherlands; on
  November 3* he wrote from Rotterdam to his staunch old cousin, Prince John
  Maurice, still at Muyden, informing him that he had left Köningsmarck in
  command of his quarters, and asking him, if possible, in conjunction with the
  faithful Wurtz, to "<i>entreprendre quelque chose sur eus</i> [the French]
  <i>en mon absence</i>." On the 11th William III wrote again from Cassel; by
  the 28th he was at Eysden. Considerable amazement was roused at this
  extraordinary action on the part of the Prince of Orange in thus withdrawing
  the armies defending Holland, and marching into a strange country in the
  depths of winter.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* These dates are as on letters; it is not clear if N.S.
  or O.S. is used. N.S. presumably.]</p>

  <p>A force of 24,000 horse and foot had mustered at Rosendaal; they were in
  good condition and well-disciplined, the result of a few months' strenuous
  labour on the part of William III and his officers. Saint Maurice, who had
  described the Dutch as "the worst troops in the world," wrote now to his
  master "that there were some fine troops" with the Prince of Orange.</p>

  <p>The story went that one of his colonels having pressed the Prince to tell
  him his design on the French, His Highness asked him if he could keep a
  secret. The officer replied that he could; whereupon the Prince announced
  dryly, "Then my tongue also is endowed from Heaven with so much grace!"</p>

  <p>The Prince of Orange endeavoured to make a juncture with the army of the
  Elector of Brandenburg coming from Westphalia; he failed in this, but,
  marching on Liège, joined the Spanish cavalry under the Prince de Vaudemont,
  the gallant, amiable and gifted Lorraine Prince who was so long his close
  companion-in-arms and warm friend.</p>

  <p>While engaged on this audacious expedition William III did not neglect
  home affairs. In November, by his advice, a general amnesty for political
  offences was proclaimed, while a penalty of death was decreed for any
  insurrection against the Government; the new fortifications were augmented
  and strengthened, 320 cannon were mounted on the walls of Amsterdam, and the
  utmost vigilance was used to prepare Rotterdam, Gouda, Delft, the Hague and
  Leyden against a possible crossing of the ice by the French.</p>

  <p>It was believed that the Prince of Orange's design was to fall on the
  great fort of Tongeren; hasty despatches were sent from Paris, bidding the
  governor of Charleroi send all possible aid to Tongeren; William III had
  already begun to invest the town with cavalry, but withdrew to Maastricht in
  view of the action of the French, re-passed the Maas between Sittard and
  Masire and encamped two days at Anisberg in the hope of inducing the French
  commander, the Comte de Duras, who had been retreating before him, to give
  battle. Duras fell back on the Roer; the Count Waldeck, taking the strong
  castle of Volcheren on the way, pursued him, but Duras, retreating so hastily
  that he left many of his sick, wounded and baggage behind him, escaped into
  the Electorate of Cologne, where he joined Turenne. Despite the continuous
  cold and frost of a very severe winter, His Highness now turned round and
  marched on Charleroi, which had been the objective of his audacious design;
  he had enticed the governor of Charleroi to Tongeren by his feint on that
  place, he had chased Duras out of the way and, by the exercise of a skill
  equal to his boldness, he now sat down before a town garrisoned by seven
  hundred with a force of twenty-four thousand men, showing&mdash;as a
  contemporary writer says&mdash;"most unblemished faithfulness, great wisdom
  and indefatigable valour."</p>

  <p>This daring, unexpected and startling action on the part of a youth lately
  utterly disregarded, recently in the command of a few contemptible troops,
  gave Louis XIV "<i>une inquiétude furieuse</i>"; he prepared to return in
  person with all his armies to the Spanish Netherlands, where this young
  General in his first campaign had undertaken an enterprise worthy of a
  Luxembourg or a Turenne. The extreme cold ruined this design, so carefully
  planned, so brilliantly executed; it was impossible to dig trenches, to get
  supplies up on the frozen roads, and men and horses were perishing in the
  rigours of a merciless season; it was hopeless to undertake a long siege in
  the depth of such a winter, with the troops thus in the open William III
  retired, took Binch by assault, fell back through Brabant and dispersed his
  troops into winter quarters.</p>

  <p>The enterprise had failed and was, of course, blamed as reckless and
  foolish; it was neither; save for the accident of weather the Prince would
  certainly have taken Charleroi, and, even as it was, he had spent little of
  either life or treasure, and returned, after an expedition of nine days, with
  the credit of having chased Duras from his post, offered battle to the enemy,
  alarmed Charleroi and Tongeren, put the Elector of Cologne into a panic, and
  returned with abundance of prisoners and booty.</p>

  <p>After this and Woerden his reputation blazed in Europe; his allies were as
  heartened as his enemies were amazed by his superb audacity.</p>

  <p>He had left the frontiers of Holland well protected, but Luxembourg took
  advantage of the prolonged heavy frosts to endeavour to cross on the ice from
  Utrecht to the Hague, the only unfortified place of that importance in
  Holland; by the end of December, his expedition, composed of fourteen
  thousand horse and foot, set out across the frozen floods; Köningsmarck, in
  command at Bodegraven, threw a regiment at Coursluys across their way to save
  Leyden; but Colonel Pain et Vin, who held the post at Niewersluys, abandoned
  this, as Montbas had abandoned Tolhuys in June, thus leaving a free passage
  to the enemy and causing a panic among the populace of Holland.</p>

  <p>Luxembourg seized Swannerdam and Bodegraven, the unprotected villages
  where the cruelties perpetrated by his troops, and no doubt something
  exaggerated by the Dutch, helped to inflame the national feeling against the
  conqueror; Wicquefort's famous "<i>Advis d'un fidéle Hollandais</i>," with
  the ghastly plates by Romeyn de Hooge of French outrages may be regarded as
  justifiable propaganda to animate the Dutch. It is doubtful if the reputation
  of the French should be tarnished too hastily; the ferocious orders of
  Luxembourg and the atrocities of his soldiers have likely been overstated, as
  the vanquished will generally overstate the villainies of the victors. In
  that age all conquered places were given over to pillage, and whether the
  licence of the French went beyond the usual licence of the period is not
  proved; Luxembourg, a most brilliant general and a man of unblemished honour,
  one in whose character there is something of greatness, behaved with courtesy
  and chivalry towards the Dutch on several occasions, as in the little
  incident recorded by Prince John Maurice when he returned, without asking
  ransom, a Dutch officer who had behaved "like an honest man."</p>

  <p>A letter from the elder Constantine Huygens refers to the lamentable state
  of the once lovely and prosperous villages of Bodegraven and Swannerdam, and
  Luxembourg's stern rule was far from popular in Utrecht, but these things
  were in the course of war; the French were admirably organized, well-paid,
  officered by members of the first families in France, and there is no reason
  to believe that their excesses were worse than those of any soldiery let
  loose on a conquered country.</p>

  <p>In the charming letter where Huygens refers to the French excesses (to
  Lady Swann, the Hague, March 10, 1673), he speaks of "An anti-Protestant
  power, already grown and mounted to such a height, as all England has
  occasion to suspect and fear it." And adds this attractive personal
  touch:</p>

  <p>"I fiddle myself out of a bad humour, either upon a viol, or a lute, or a
  pair of virginals, which in my cabinet I doe find ready about me. And as if
  upon all these instruments I had not spoiled and spent good hours enough,
  since a year hence I became a notable guitare-man, having produced above
  thirty pieces of all sorts and tunes upon that miserable instrument, so that
  there wanteth almost nothing but that I should be exalted to be a trumpeter
  at the head of our troops."</p>

  <p>A sudden thaw confounded Luxembourg's design, as a sudden frost had
  confounded that of William of Orange; the discomfort and distress of the
  French were extreme, three hundred were drowned at Naarden; the advance
  guards, horse and men perished in the icy waters. Luxembourg, who led the
  army in person, was flung into the swamp and with difficulty rescued by two
  troopers; a man no longer young, frail, almost deformed in person, the French
  General fell ill from exposure and chill and was taken back to Utrecht in a
  litter. With heavy losses the entire forces retreated to the high grounds,
  and William III, sweeping back to Breda from Charleroi, found honours more
  than even, Binche equalled the two unhappy villages, and Luxembourg had lost
  more men than the Prince and not so enhanced his reputation; save for the
  cowardice or treachery of Colonel Pain et Vin, the French would have met with
  disaster, for had the Niewersluys post been held they must, unable to return
  to dry land, have been made prisoners or drowned by the hundred.</p>

  <p>Pain et Vin had fled to Gouda and his arrest followed instantly upon the
  return of the Prince, who was not likely to be more lenient in his case than
  he had been in that of Montbas.</p>

  <p>While Luxembourg and his men were struggling in the thawed ice round
  Utrecht, the gates of Groningen, still held for Henri Casimir of Nassau-Dietz
  by Colonel Raupenhaupt, were flung open and Colonel Eybergen marched out with
  three companies of dragoons, five companies of horse, and eleven hundred
  foot&mdash;all Friesland and Groningen regiments&mdash;and hurled himself on
  Coeverden, one of the strongest forts in Europe, held by twenty-seven
  companies (nearly ten thousand men) for France. After a hot assault the Dutch
  took the town by storm, displaying brilliant courage, capturing a quantity of
  war stores and thirteen of the enemy's colours which were sent into Groningen
  as an earnest that the lustre of the Dutch name began to burnish again:
  "<i>Belgica sic iterum redit in praecordia virtus</i>!" In sum, the campaign
  of 1672 might fairly be said to have concluded in favour of the Dutch who
  had, a few months before, seemed on the verge of disaster; the nation that
  Europe had believed was about to cease to exist had regained prestige and
  respect through the leadership of William of Orange; even the success of
  Coeverden, though he was not present, was ascribed to his example and
  management of affairs.</p>

  <p>Louis XIV, who had at last begun to doubt if the brilliant young soldier
  could be bought or induced to make the peace on which the Anglo-French had
  set their minds, observed with growing uneasiness the rise of this vivid and
  powerful personality on the field of European politics, who, in a few months,
  had roused Germany, the lethargic Spaniards, and the apathetic Emperor into a
  close-knit league against him, while the love and admiration of the Dutch for
  the Prince who had delivered them rose to fervent heights.</p>

  <p>Sophia of Hanover wrote to her brother: "The people here have an
  unheard-of passion for the Prince of Orange, they kiss the ground where he
  has passed and the horse on which he has mounted; people of all conditions
  say all the good imaginable of him; he has more power in Holland than any
  Prince of Orange has had before."</p>

  <p>It was not what the young Prince had actually accomplished that so roused
  the love and loyalty of his people and the admiration of Europe, but it was
  the fact that he should have dared to endeavour so much, that he, in such a
  situation as he was, with a country so defeated, beaten, as it were, to its
  knees, should have ventured to take up the challenge and defy a monarch so
  resplendent and so dreaded as Louis XIV, who seemed surrounded by all the
  favours of fortune, and who had never known a reverse, whose resources
  appeared inexhaustible, who was assisted by all the influence of the King of
  England, who was the greatest sovereign in the world, supported by statesmen
  and soldiers of genius, who had in his service a Colbert, a Vauban, a Condé,
  a Turenne and a Luxembourg. No one was more amazed and impressed than Louis
  XIV himself at the audacity and fortitude of the youth who dared to oppose
  him; he had a lively appreciation of true grandeur, and he spared no pains to
  win over his young kinsman for his service. His generals were instructed to
  use every opportunity of flattering and praising the young Stadtholder. It
  was as if Louis XIV foresaw, even in the midst of all his rich successes,
  that he had roused and armed the man who was to link up all Europe in a
  coalition against him, and bring all his triumphs to defeat, and all his
  wealth to bankruptcy; confident and assured as he was he could not view with
  complacency the armies of his Caesarian Majesty, which might be sent against
  his forces on the Rhine, the Elector of Brandenburg advancing on Westphalia,
  the Spaniards roused in Flanders, Charles Stewart, pressed by a discontented
  people, tottering in his alliance; he resolved with that grandeur seldom
  lacking to the execution of his designs, though the conception of them was
  often mean enough, to take the field in person at the beginning of the
  spring.</p>

  <p>William III, welcomed, much to his distaste, like a hero and a conqueror,
  returned to the Hague in January, after composing fierce differences in the
  councils of Friesland and Zeeland. Prince John Maurice, old as he was and
  tormented "furiously" with the gravel, remained at Muyden, guarding Amsterdam
  and keeping his eye on Luxembourg who, he noted with relish (January 3,
  1673), "<i>est rentré dans Utrecht, malade, à cause qu'il est tombé dans
  l'eau, comme aussi quelque mille de leur cavalerie et infanterie, selon que
  les ennemys mesmes disent</i>."</p>

  <p>The correspondence still continued between him and the Prince of Orange,
  and reveals the old soldier in a very attractive light, most loyal, vigilant,
  shrewd and bold, with the charm of simplicity and sincerity in all he writes,
  sparing no pains to give careful information as to military affairs, and,
  with a certain dry humour here and there, as when he remarks of the powder
  Luxembourg had prepared to burn the Hague in January&mdash;"<i>Mais l'Eternal
  les a empesché, pour cette foys</i>"; he feared another attempt of the French
  should the waters freeze again, and asked for more reinforcements; there was
  a great deal of illness in the camp and fearful discomforts...</p>

  <p>William III, writing from the Hague (January 23), did not share these
  fears; he thought, on the contrary, an attempt might be made on Naarden,
  "<i>en petites chaloupes</i>"&mdash;as for the sick soldiers, "I beg you to
  let me know if there is any remedy for that"&mdash;a dry comment.</p>

  <p>But Prince John Maurice had to complain of worse things than illness; lack
  of discipline, slackness and negligence, officers going off to warm beds at
  night, instead of enduring the miseries of the wet, freezing camp, even
  sentries sleeping on duty, were noted indignantly; this state of affairs
  throws light on the cold severity shown by the Prince in the case of Colonel
  Pain et Vin, then being brought to trial; the first court-martial on this
  unhappy officer had banished him and confiscated his goods, when the
  Stadtholder was asked to ratify this, he "found it contrary to Article 45 of
  the Military Ordination," and commanded Field Marshal Würtz to order a
  further investigation "to see justice truly and strictly administered
  proportionable to the heinousness of the offence."</p>

  <p>The second trial, held at Alphen, ordered the prisoner to have a sword
  passed over his head by the common hangman; but the Prince was implacable and
  still refused to ratify the findings of the court; a third trial, before the
  Prince and Commissioners from the States, ended in a death sentence.</p>

  <p>Colonel Pain et Vin was beheaded in the camp at Alphen, protesting to the
  last that he had not been a traitor, but a mere coward; this affair made much
  stir and seemed to prove the stern resolve of the Prince to restore
  discipline; his measures may appear harsh, but the letters of Prince John
  Maurice are sufficient proof that they were necessary; the army was still,
  greatly improved as it was, far from being the efficient instrument it became
  later in the hands of William of Orange, and the high command and important
  post held by the unfortunate Pain et Vin made, in the eyes of his commander,
  only one punishment possible.</p>

  <p>Even after the execution of Pain et Vin (January 13) Prince John Maurice
  was writing (January 16): "The negligence of all the captains, lieutenants
  and ensigns, and the contempt they have for their charges are so great that
  it is unbelievable and insupportable; they are so impertinent that they leave
  their posts at night, and go to lodgings to sleep between sheets; I learnt
  this through taking the 'round' myself."</p>

  <p>The indignant old general summoned the defaulters to his quarters; they
  were an hour late, and though he gave "<i>une fort bonne reprimande</i>" with
  a threat of cashiering them, the next night when making his inspection Prince
  John Maurice found in the regiment of Colonel Aylva that the captain, the
  lieutenant, the ensign and the sergeant had quitted their posts and that the
  sentinel was asleep&mdash;"an unheard-of thing seeing the alarm and the enemy
  always so near to us. I have suspended the captain, the other officers are
  with the provost, and I wait what it pleases your Highness to order, the
  discipline of the Militia must be punctually observed, or all will be lost
  and I incapable of doing my duty, if every one does as he pleases, without
  reflecting on his duty and his honour." The Prince's reply to this has not
  been preserved; it may be guessed at by a letter dated January 24 from the
  Hague:</p>

  <p>"I am vexed to learn that the officers and principally with Colonel
  Stochiem, who is engaged in this and had promised me to make his recruits
  from good Germans ('<i>bons Almans</i>'); I beg you to let them know my
  resentment, and that if they do not correct themselves, I shall cashier them
  absolutely."</p>

  <p>Here is sufficient evidence to show how carelessly and maliciously charges
  of harshness and cruelty were made against the Prince in the matters of
  Montbas and Pain et Vin, and how desperate a condition the Dutch army had
  fallen into under De Witt; in these early days of the struggle the Prince had
  to rely on foreign help; the Spanish troops sent by De Monterey, excellent
  soldiers, and mercenary regiments hired from Holstein and Courland, later the
  troops of the Grand Elector and the Emperor; even in the attempt on
  Charleroi, he commanded an army composed of many nationalities, and on no
  occasion, save in the attack on Woerden, soldiers entirely Dutch; native
  courage appears to have shown with far greater advantage on sea than on land;
  in their naval engagements the Dutch always displayed conspicuous valour, but
  it was some time before their ancient spirit could be roused to much effect
  on land. This does not apply, of course, to the aristocratic officers of the
  ancient school, who were all valiant, able and courteous men; a curious
  instance of this last quality was shown by the Count of Hornes who sent from
  Ouwater to Luxembourg at Utrecht, a boat with several rare fish, citrons, and
  other refreshments, also some curious glasses, and later by William III's
  present of wagon-loads of ice for the French camp.</p>

  <p>The Prince had the greatest difficulty in obtaining men, good or bad, when
  Prince John Maurice asked desperately for seven or eight good veteran
  companies. William III was forced to reply that he did not possess any, such
  as he had being ill and overcome with the bad air ("<i>mauvais
  air</i>"&mdash;cold?); that it was necessary for them to refresh themselves
  before undertaking any labour.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>

  <p>Thus, on every hand, inadequate means, breaking tools, tedious
  difficulties, complaints, delays; the Emperor slow, hesitant; the Princes of
  the Empire divided; the Elector of Brandenburg unable to slip past Condé in
  Westphalia, the French preparing for another gigantic enterprise on what
  remained of the Dutch Republic; and the depression of the long, dark, bitter
  winter, clouds, snow and sleet over the flooded country, where sometimes the
  swollen waters lapped over the causeways and neither man nor beast could
  pass; and always the fear of another frost and another advance of Luxembourg
  on Holland; it was March before the vigilant Stadtholder could note, with a
  breath of relief: "I think there will be no more ice this year."</p>

  <p>Throughout this perpetual strain, this endless anxiety, these entangled
  difficulties, this need for ceaseless watchfulness, harassed by personal
  fatigue, discomfort and heavy toil, the Stadtholder remained as constant as a
  lodestar to the nation; he had that most uncommon courage which requires no
  stimulant of applause or success, appreciation or flattery; in defeat, hemmed
  in by perils, threatened by disaster, he could remain as serene, as undaunted
  as Louis XIV, supported by victories, by adulation, by power, by all the
  intoxicating praises of a brilliant court, an enraptured nation.</p>

  <p>In his fragment of a country with his fragment of an army and a government
  lately overturned, William III, exhausted by fatigue, by the languors of
  ill-health, with no certain resource save in his own genius, coolly,
  carefully, and with unerring skill, began to plan the combinations that were
  to check and checkmate the invincible Frenchman; he was never confused, he
  was never shaken; in the most frantic crisis of field or cabinet he never
  lost his keen judgment, his complete self-control, his power of swift
  unalterable decision, his clear, accurate perception of men and motives,
  characters and events; not even for one second during the whole of his life
  did any peril, any excitement, any bait, any disappointment, turn him from
  his own purpose, his own ideals, his own convictions.</p>

  <p>His character was cast in an heroic mould, and true grandeur gilded all
  his actions; though he never used the word "glory," so often applied to Louis
  XIV, it was glory (or disinterested action for the public good, for a lofty
  ideal) that he served; he had no vulgar ambitions, and neither asked nor
  gained personal advantages; from none of his designs did he reap direct
  profit; his soul was too high, his spirit too lucid, for paltry rewards for a
  moment to attract him; at twenty-one called upon to improvise a government,
  an army, save a nation and restore the balance of power in Europe, he devoted
  himself to what in all simplicity he so frequently called "<i>la cause
  commun</i>"; to this all considerations must give way, for this all danger
  must be defied, all labour undertaken; rare indeed is this combination of
  patient fortitude and audacious courage which enabled the Prince, indifferent
  to fear, favour, ease, pleasure or ambition, to maintain through a life of
  difficulty, misfortune and disappointment, that constant attachment to a
  task, in every way mighty and heroic, taken up in extreme youth, and only
  relinquished on a deathbed.</p>

  <p>Those who consider that character makes destiny might find justification
  in the life of this Prince; it appears obvious that one of such qualities in
  such a position must change the face of European politics; but William III
  believed in predestination, that was to him the essence of all
  faith&mdash;one must consider oneself an instrument in the hands of God, or
  disbelieve in God; this Calvinism, that he had been so early and so sternly
  taught, his spacious and flexible mind had widened into a philosophy; he was
  so little of a bigot, so passionately tolerant ("believing that Conscience
  was God's Province"), so early used to work and live with people of many
  creeds (of two of his closest friends, Waldeck was a Lutheran, Vaudemont a
  Roman Catholic), that the austere and grim doctrines of Calvinism became to
  him no more than this trust in an overwhelming power whose ends he served;
  the constant references in his letters to God, his hope in God's mercy, his
  endeavour to submit to God's displeasure, do not seem to refer to a personal
  Deity, but to an entity that might be termed either Fortune or Providence; it
  was his fate to appear as a Protestant champion, and he was careful in his
  religious observances, on occasion devout, but nothing in his life leads one
  to suppose that he was strongly attached to the formulae of any creed, or
  that the Dutch Church was more to him than a beloved memory of childhood,
  claiming his loyalty through patriotism; naturally his mind was coloured by
  the persistent teaching of his childhood, but it was a mind free from the
  least taint of bigotry or fanaticism, and one that could have been easily
  turned to free-thinking; tolerance such as his is usually near to
  indifference for all formula; what he had a strong sense of was this
  protecting, guiding power&mdash;"Descartes' daemon"&mdash;of which he never
  lost sight and in which he calmly trusted; it might be called faith in his
  own genius, but he named it, after the fashion of the time and his own
  training, God, according to John Calvin.</p>

  <p>This sense of predestination was woven with a passion of patriotism most
  uncommon in Princes and hardly to be explained; of mingled, alien blood
  himself, brought up surrounded by French, English and German, slighted and
  thwarted by the Dutch Government and a section of the Dutch people, William
  III had yet for the Netherlands a love and devotion rare in pure-blooded
  patriots with no grievance against their country; he seemed to have given to
  Holland the affection owing to parents and relations, brothers, sisters and
  friends; to cherish these pale flats, these brick towns with trees and
  canals, these dykes and avenues, like a lover; with what ardour did he flash
  to the rescue when all his interests lay the other way&mdash;"I will not sell
  my country for any price that could be offered"&mdash;and when one could do
  nothing else, when all the beloved land was gone, one could die there, "in
  the last ditch!"</p>

  <p>This love was fond, romantic; away from Holland he pined, like, as he
  said, "a fish out of water," longing for that damp Dutch air that foreigners
  found so heavy and dull, the brick roads between avenues of lime and beech,
  the flat houses with the step-gables, the closely cultivated, carefully
  drained fields, the rivers and canals packed with barges, the hunting parks
  and elegant "<i>slots</i>," the wide melancholy horizons with windmills and
  church spires breaking an infinite distance, the great woods stretching from
  the Hague to the sea, the long low dunes, bleak, white, with the coarse scrub
  grass, and the stretch of smooth sands where he could ride in his coach and
  four, breathing in the salt breeze from the wide expanse of the North Sea:
  "It is May now, and Kermesse at the Hague&mdash;oh, for the wings of a bird I
  I would give a thousand pounds, nay, two thousand pounds, to be in Holland
  now!" When he was a king, amid some of England's loveliest scenery, this sick
  lament broke from him; and again, to his secretary&mdash;"Tell me, Zuylichem,
  are you never homesick?"</p>

  <p>In 1672 this passion of patriotism was behind all his actions; not as a
  champion of the Protestants but as champion of the Dutch had he picked up the
  gage thrown down by Louis XIV; though his policy was international, his aim
  was national&mdash;to save, protect, consolidate, embellish Holland; he was,
  as Charles II remarked, "too Dutch."</p>

  <p>This patriotism was inflamed by a sense of responsibility; in panic, in
  ruin, the country had flung itself on his protection; the glory and danger of
  the task alike appealed to the Prince; in undertaking to re-establish his
  country he worked for what he loved and he satisfied his aspirations towards
  a lofty ideal, a mighty labour, a vast scope for his great abilities and his
  resplendent qualities.</p>

  <p>It was an ironic stroke of fate that placed this Prince in the Dutch
  flats, instead of on one of the thrones of the Hapsburgs in Vienna or Madrid,
  and made him play the part that should have belonged to the lethargic Emperor
  or the wretched King of Spain; the quarrel was between the Bourbon and the
  Hapsburg, the prize, Spain; had not William of Orange arisen, alone they
  might have fought the question out; but Louis XIV, taking Holland carelessly
  in his stride, had roused a man who, to defend the adored marshes and swamps,
  intended to embroil all Europe in a war. His scheme was already in 1672
  formulated, a revival of the Triple Alliance&mdash;England, Sweden, Holland,
  joined to Spain, the Emperor, the German Princes, against France. He foresaw
  without deception or dismay the immense difficulties of this vast and daring
  scheme, obstacle after obstacle, the shifty, false policy of the Stewart
  King, the weakness of the Empire, the jealousies of the German Princes, the
  fluctuating policies of Sweden, the decay and poverty of Spain, internal
  divisions in Holland itself, and the power, wealth, prestige of Louis XIV,
  already more successful by bribes, made possible by his huge resources than
  even through feats of arms.</p>

  <p>Throughout that bleak, dreadful winter of 1672 William III was already,
  with infinite patience, preparing the first details of his life's design. By
  February he was back at his headquarters at Alphen; he then made "a strict
  survey," with no less care than toil, of the frontiers and fortifications of
  what was left of the Dutch Republic&mdash;Vlissingen, Sluys, Ysendyke,
  Bergen-op-Zoom, Breda and Bois-le-Duc; the rejoicings that awaited him on
  these visits, the gifts of "outlandish curiosities" and keys of towns in
  silver boxes, presented by young gentlewomen decked with flowers, were
  sincerely distasteful to him, and evaded on all possible occasions; but this
  lack of affability did not affect his popularity; it seemed to be recognized
  that he put all ceremony aside because of his intense absorption in his task;
  this was still what he afterwards named "the hour of his greatest distress,"
  and his difficulties were such as perhaps no one but himself could perceive;
  his correspondence with Prince John Maurice shows the constant anxiety about
  troops; the old General and the Stadtholder asking each other for regiments,
  the Prince "very pressed for men," the Commander at Muyden not able to spare
  any; endless shifts and expedients to contrive with depleted regiments,
  undisciplined militia, cavalry whose horses could not be fed because of the
  flooded country, sickness, fatigue "and these eternal counter-marches one
  must make when one has insufficient troops."</p>

  <p>On May 2nd/12th, Prince John Maurice left his important and vexatious post
  at Muyden in the hands of Köningsmarck and went to Groningen, then threatened
  again by the Bishop of Münster. Even though the fear of the frost was over,
  affairs still looked dark for the Dutch; Louis XIV was setting out from Paris
  with a refreshed, well-trained, victory-flushed army; Luxembourg at Utrecht
  was waiting a chance to plunge his forces like a knife into the heart of the
  moribund country; Turenne was holding up Brandenburg in Westphalia; the
  French and English fleets were making a juncture for a descent on the coasts.
  After a three weeks' siege Maastricht fell to Louis XIV, who had attacked the
  important city with his entire army&mdash;forty thousand horse and
  foot&mdash;and which did not surrender until half of the garrison had been
  slain; great as this blow was to the Dutch the Prince proved that he could
  distinguish between misfortune and fault by making the Governor a
  major-general.</p>

  <p>In this spectacular triumph Louis XIV found his lust for glory satisfied;
  after pompous <i>Te Deums</i> in the conquered town he returned to the
  delights of Paris and the allurements of Madame de Montespan; the conquest of
  Maastricht had cost him nine thousand men, but this was considered a small
  price to pay for so many more rays of glory round the laurel crown of the
  invincible monarch who, if he did not care to risk his dignity in a battle,
  could make such a graceful figure in the pageantry of victory. Three fresh
  brigades were sent to reinforce the French in Holland, others to assist
  Turenne, and others again to punish the Bishop of Liège, by ravaging his
  country, for taking the side of the Spanish.</p>

  <p>All that the Prince of Orange could do was to hold his post; the strain of
  this, into which every ounce of strength, of intelligence, of courage had to
  be put, can only be compared to that of a man who by a supreme effort has
  contrived to hold his own in a raging storm, just stand and just creep
  forward; the Prince could only just maintain himself, and that seemed by a
  miracle; useless Swedish mediators went to and fro the Hague, the magistrates
  of Amsterdam had to be changed, the great fleets drew nearer the coasts;
  money, food, all necessities were lacking. In June Brandenburg, impossible to
  satisfy with meagre Dutch subsidies, fell off and reluctantly made a peace
  with France (Vossem, June, 1672); the Emperor, for all the entreaties of
  Lisola, hesitated about sending his armies down the Danube; in Groningen
  there was trouble; the farmers, rejoicing in fine crops, refused to flood the
  threatened lands, the redoubtable Rapenhaupt disputed the authority of Prince
  John Maurice, the veteran's letters were full of complaints. William III
  dealt with this situation as if he had been as supreme, as victorious, as
  Louis XIV. "I find the letters of the States of Groningen and that of
  Rapenhaupt very stupid (<i>fort sotte</i>); you have absolutely the command
  and must maintain it." Prince John Maurice had to sustain the same vexatious
  oppositions and fatigue here as at Muyden; much as he detested "to make
  difficulties and complaints" he had to fill his letters with sorry
  news&mdash;fortresses ill-prepared, each thinking of himself and not "<i>la
  cause commun</i>," the enemy approaching and nothing to receive him with, but
  the stalwart Nassau Prince who, when he had at Muyden lacked powder, declared
  he would die sword in hand, now stoutly wrote: "I am resolved to dispute with
  the enemy from one ditch to another." Groningen expected Holland to provide
  powder and matches for her defence&mdash;"but that," the Prince wrote, "is
  unjust, as Friesland and Groningen do nothing," and the material would be
  sent when the Northerners paid for it; one gleam of satisfaction solaced
  Prince John Maurice, "I am greatly obliged to His Highness that he has had
  the goodness to send me so good an officer as M. le Géneral Commissaire le
  Marquis de Montpouillan."</p>

  <p>The Bishop of Münster was endeavouring to retake the important fort of
  Coevorden, and the slowness of "<i>Messieurs les députes</i>" was
  "<i>incroyable</i>." The sole assistance came from "Madame la Princesse de
  Nassau," Albertine, daughter of Frederic Henry and mother of the young
  Stadtholder, Henry Casimir. The great trouble was the refusal of
  all&mdash;even the Groningen officers&mdash;to flood the country in view of
  the approach of the enemy; a naval engagement had dispersed the English fleet
  threatening Holland (June 1673), but this selfish obstinacy threatened an
  invasion from the north; the Stadtholder, writing from the Hague, June 25,
  1673, dealt sternly with the matter:</p>

  <p class="letter">"Monsieur, I have received yours of the 10th instant and
  have seen, with much astonishment, the insolent and impertinent resolution of
  these gentlemen of Friesland, which is very out of place. If you find the
  inundations necessary, I beg you to make them, without any regard to the said
  resolution, and, if the Friesland officers make any difficulty to obey you in
  that, or in anything else, have them shot on the spot, without any form of
  trial, my authority being deeply engaged; I therefore beg you not to fail in
  this, and to be assured that I shall be always, Monsieur,<br>
  <br>
  "Your very affectionate cousin and servant,<br>
  "G. PRINCE D'ORANGE."</p>

  <p>While this correspondence, with its breathless air of vigilance alarmed,
  was passing by swift messenger, post on the heels of post, across the watery
  flats, the Stadtholder was organizing his other defences&mdash;Count Waldeck
  on the frontiers of Brabant, Count Hornes at Gorcum, Count Styrum at Muyden,
  labouring at the fortifications, Würtz in a posture of defence in Flanders,
  and the Prince of Orange now here, now there, planning all, overseeing all,
  holding in his hand the guidance of affairs both military and political.</p>

  <p>The harshness and exactions of the French, their levies of money and goods
  on the conquered provinces became more and more galling and inspired the
  people to struggle from under the heavy yoke of Luxembourg and Condé;
  skirmishes occurred continuously, at Heusden, at Susteren, at Eindhoven; the
  young Count of Styrum was slain, George Frederic of Nassau-Siegen wounded,
  Colonel Bampfield, John de Witt's faithful friend, arrested for abandoning
  his post at Armeyden, and tried before the Council of War at Alphen; the
  Stadtholder wrote a letter to the fleet, addressed to his "Honourable,
  valiant, beloved, faithful and singular Friend, the Lord-Lieutenant Admiral
  de Ruyter," full of brave exhortation and encouragement, eighty-four
  men-of-war passed Dover making for the coasts of Holland; on May 28th/June
  7th and June 4th/14th took place the naval engagements on the result of which
  Prince John Maurice had congratulated the Stadtholder. These were fought in
  sight of the Zeeland and Flemish coasts, the first from the early hours of
  the morning till late in the evening, and which De Ruyter described in the
  letter written to the "Illustrious, Highly-descended Prince," and dated June
  8th, "On board the Ship <i>The Seven Provinces</i>, riding at anchor at
  Schonevelt." Both sides claimed the victory of this mighty battle, but the
  losses of the English were too severe to allow them to land in Holland, so
  the Dutch had the fruits of success. In August another engagement had been
  equally fierce and indecisive; but again the valiant De Ruyter had driven the
  English vessels back to their own shores, and it was impossible to send the
  nine thousand English troops which Charles II had collected to invade
  Zeeland.</p>

  <p>Relieved of the first pressing danger and reassured by the success of
  Prince John Maurice in at length flooding Groningen, the indomitable
  Stadtholder, hearing that the French had a design on Breda, gathered every
  available man together and immediately dashed to Ramsdouck, where, with six
  thousand Spanish troops, he held the French in check until a further alarm of
  a descent on the north coast brought him in haste to the Helder to affront
  this fresh peril; at this almost desperate juncture Prince John Maurice had
  failed in a gallant attempt (the third) on Swartsluis.</p>

  <p>When the squadrons of the English fleet could be discerned a few miles out
  in the North Sea, William had already hastened from the camp to meet this
  third attempt at invasion. Mariners and soldiers were gathered along the low
  sand dunes, watching the enemy spread before the Island of Texel, but by the
  time the Prince reached the Helder the English had sailed away, having
  withdrawn before the approach of De Ruyter's squadrons. The Prince boarded a
  fishing-boat and rowed out to the Fleet, which he had never before visited,
  and met De Ruyter, the staunch old hero who had been so long his opponent and
  a personal friend of the De Witts, who had been indeed so firmly set against
  the Stadtholdership that it had been with difficulty that his house at
  Flushing had been rescued from an Orangist mob. Without rancour, however, the
  young man and the old sailor, both worn with fatigue and anxiety, clasped
  hands amid the roar of the guns booming the salute and the shouts of the
  sailors, fresh from the great fights, who, as well as their fellow-countrymen
  on land, looked upon the slender figure of the Prince in the blue uniform as
  the symbol of honour and victory.</p>

  <p>The Prince's visit evoked scenes of exalted enthusiasm and patriotic
  fervour comparable to the ardour of despair and resolution that had thrown
  off the yoke of Spain a hundred years ago; the Dutch were now an enemy to be
  feared, for they were fighting for more than their lives, and had found a man
  to lead them, while the English went into the war sullenly and reluctantly
  with more hatred for their allies than for their opponents. Amid scenes of a
  vast excitement and loyal enthusiasm His Highness visited every ship in the
  Fleet. A few days afterwards the furious naval battle of Texel or Kykduin
  (August 11th/21st, 1673), which dispelled again the danger of a landing by
  the English, and which seemed to the Dutch people to be in the nature of a
  special deliverance, confirmed their choice of a champion and leader; an
  almost frantic outburst of thanksgiving to God mingled with the equally
  frantic outburst of gratitude to De Ruyter and the Prince of Orange. The
  Prince waited for no acclamations, no praises or encouragements, he hurried
  from the Helder to the Hague, from the Hague "<i>in't leger tot Ramsdouc</i>"
  watching Breda&mdash;then (September 6) "dans la Bruyère de 's Gravelant"
  with a design to take Naarden, so wistfully and fiercely regarded&mdash;"send
  me troops, as many as possible...and if the enemy come too near, for God's
  sake flood the country." Thus to Prince John Maurice, struggling still with
  subdued but obstinate and reluctant Northerners.</p>

  <p>The result of these great naval battles, the desperate struggle of Solebay
  and the Texel, had been favourable to the Dutch; the English admiral had
  declared he would never fight with the French again, and it cannot be denied
  that the inaction of d'Estrèes, whether inspired by malice, cowardice, or
  indifference, cost Prince Rupert all possible chance of a victory, and that,
  as a naval historian writes: "De Ruyter had exhibited an example of naval
  defence against a superior enemy that has, perhaps, never been equalled. He
  had fought hard yet wisely. The tactical skill and power of handling which he
  displayed were quite without precedent in sailing warfare, and he enhanced
  his reputation to its zenith." (<i>Corbett</i>.)</p>

  <p>The result of the battle of the Texel was received with fury in England,
  and an outburst of hatred against the French, the King, the Court and the
  Papists that was the direct cause of a clamour for peace.</p>

  <p>And though affairs seemed outwardly so desperate, the Prince in that brief
  visit to the Hague, between the battle of Kykduin and the attempt on Naarden,
  had signed there (Aug. 30th/Sept. 9th) treaties that made a most formidable
  coalition against Louis XIV and Charles II; two separate agreements with
  Spain and the Emperor for the preservation of the Treaties of Aix-la-Chapelle
  and Westphalia and a mutual agreement between all three with the Duke of
  Lorraine for the restoration of his long-lost province.</p>

  <p>The loss of Maastricht, nay, all the successes of Vauban, Condé, Turenne
  and Luxembourg, that blazed so brightly on the surface, were more than
  balanced by the swift and brilliant statesmanship of William III; and, while
  he was holding English and French at bay, with Montecuculi steadily advancing
  to his assistance, Charles II found it difficult to keep his parliament in
  hand; the passions of the Protestant English were further roused by the
  marriage of the Duke of York to a Papist Princess whose dowry was guaranteed
  by Louis XIV, and by whose means that monarch hoped to bring England yet
  nearer the Church of Rome.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>

  <p>On August 30th, <i>n.s.</i>, the Prince was at the Hague; upon hearing
  that the Bishop of Münster's troops had left Friesland, he recalled the seven
  regiments sent to reinforce Prince John Maurice and ordered them to Wesop,
  and himself, with his main troops, marched to Geertruidenburg, thence to
  Werkendam, near Gorkum. Luxembourg proceeded with six thousand men to Tiel,
  to watch him, but on the night of the 31st the Prince passed over the Taemmer
  Bridge under cover of the dark and moved towards Amsterdam. On September 5
  his troops crossed the Vecht in small boats, again at night, after putting to
  flight the two hundred French who held the post; the weather was wildly
  stormy, but the daring passage was successfully accomplished. His Highness
  took possession of Loosdrecht and other posts, and was in front of Naarden,
  with twenty-five thousand men, before Luxembourg at Utrecht had the least
  suspicion of the design. The city was blocked up, the circumvallation and
  batteries made, and the trenches opened by September 8, while the Dutch in
  flat boats made a distraction by violently firing on Bommel from the water.
  In three days William III, who directed the siege in person, had advanced to
  the counterscarp and the ravelyn of the Huyster Gate of Naarden; the young
  Rhyngrave stormed the outworks on the other side; after a vigorous fight of
  three hours both counterscarp and ravelyn were gained, and the Prince gave
  orders for a general storm; but the French asked for a parley, and, after an
  exchange of hostages, articles of capitulation were agreed on, the evacuation
  being effected under the direction of the young Rhyngrave. The French
  garrison of three thousand men marched out with drums beating, colours
  flying, baggage wagons and the cannon. The swiftness of this success, the
  vigour with which the work had been carried on, under the very eyes of
  Luxembourg, the importance of the huge fortress, gave this affair a great
  lustre; the town had been carried in four days with the loss of only a
  hundred men, and the prestige gained by the Prince was worth more to his
  country than the material gain. He had exposed himself in the trenches and on
  the batteries, heartening his men by a display of that reckless bravery that
  went so far beyond the ordinary bravery of a soldier that it always roused an
  amazed admiration among his enemies, an excess of devotion among his friends;
  a medal struck by the States for this success shows the Prince as he appeared
  to his soldiers before the walls of Naarden; the uniform with light armour on
  back and breast, the jack boots and gauntlets, the orange scarf and garter,
  the flowing curls and the fine aquiline face, all energy and resolution.</p>

  <p>The profound respect with which the French Governor of Naarden saluted the
  Prince after the surrender was a proof that the attitude of the French had
  changed; the young Stadtholder had already raised his ruined country to an
  honourable position.</p>

  <p>Luxembourg, furious at the loss of Naarden, degraded the Governor, and he
  was afterwards condemned to perpetual imprisonment.</p>

  <p>Without a moment's delay, William III, who was expected to march on to the
  Veluwe, returned to the Hague, leaving Count Köningsmarck in command at
  Naarden.</p>

  <p>Louis XIV was in Nancy, having secured all of Lorraine, and was replacing
  with French garrisons the Imperial troops in such important places as
  Coblentz; Ehrenbreitzteyn and all the towns and forts of the Bishopric of
  Trèves, and the whole of that country on that side of the Rhine, as far as
  Switzerland, was in the hands of the French; the Prince Elector of the
  Palatine, still faithful to the Emperor, had retreated with his court to the
  mighty fortress of Hermanstein.</p>

  <p>The French had nothing more to fear from the Elector of Brandenburg, but
  the advance of the Imperialists and the addition of the troops of Holstein
  and Courland to William III's forces somewhat balanced this defection.</p>

  <p>Leopold I had recently lost his Empress and had married again, Claudia
  Felicita, Duchess of Innsbruck, his cousin&mdash;extravagantly called the
  most beautiful princess in Europe; James, Duke of York, had been her suitor.
  At the conclusion of the sumptuous marriage ceremony the Emperor, in full
  state, reviewed his troops, to the number of near 40,000, August 4th/14th, on
  the plains of Egra. Despite the Turkish war and the Hungarian revolt, he
  could still command a large and well-equipped army, whose officers were as
  brilliant as those of Louis XIV. Raymond, Count of Montecuculi, accounted the
  equal of the great Condé, had lately finely embellished his already
  illustrious renown by the decisive victory of St. Gothard against the
  heathen.</p>

  <p>With him was the Duke Charles IV of Lorraine, who had been dispossessed of
  his powerful duchy by Richelieu, while fluctuating negotiations with Louis
  XIV had left him deprived of every inch of territory, and reduced him to the
  position of a soldier of fortune. He was forced to take service under the
  Emperor as a means of subsistence, and was now eager to engage in the war
  against his enemy, the King of France, in the hope that he might find his own
  advantage in any ensuing treaties of peace. The Emperor had again and again
  put forward his claim at the Court of Versailles, but in vain; it was not the
  policy of Louis XIV or his ministers to relinquish so important a province as
  Lorraine. Serving with the Spanish army was his son, called the Prince de
  Vaudemont&mdash;a child of an irregular union which deprived him of
  succession to his father's now nominal honours. The heir was the young
  Charles of Lorraine, afterwards Duke Charles V, nephew of Charles IV and son
  of the Duke Nicolas, who already gave promise of being as renowned a soldier
  and as successful a commander as his uncle. A few years later he married the
  sister of Leopold I (with whom he enjoyed considerable influence), Eleanora,
  the widow of Michael, King of Poland. These Lorraine princes, whose blood was
  as ancient and as honoured as that of Nassau or Hapsburg&mdash;they traced
  their descent from Charlemagne and Godfrey de Bouillon, King of
  Jerusalem&mdash;were high in the favour of the Emperor, and the hope to
  secure Lorraine for his general was another inducement to Leopold to
  undertake this war.</p>

  <p>In August, Turenne had made a sudden thrust at the heart of the Empire,
  and crossing the Maine at Affschaffenburg, advanced on Wurtzburg, which the
  Governor had been bribed to deliver; but the plot was discovered, and
  Turenne, encamped on high ground at Ochsenfurt, awaited the coming of
  Montecuculi, who was laboriously advancing with nearly thirty-nine thousand
  men, of which nearly fourteen thousand were horse, under the command of the
  Duke of Lorraine, the Marquis of Baden-Baden, General Sporck, Prince Herman
  of Baden, the Marquis of Grana, and the Duke of Borneviglia; it was the
  purpose of Montecuculi to make a juncture with the Prince of Orange in
  Cologne, and the purpose of Turenne to prevent this. The naval campaign came
  to an end for this year, the English and Dutch laying up their ships for the
  winter; De Ruyter, having cruised up and down the English coast, came into
  haven in October, when the Lord High Admiral made his report to Their High
  Mightinesses, and Admiral Tromp presented to the Admiralty at Amsterdam the
  flag of Sir Edward Spragge as a trophy.</p>

  <p>These two sea heroes had protected their country in three hot battles
  "with much valour and honour, without losing one man-of-war and not a
  thousand men, of the whole fleet "; a grateful nation saluted De Ruyter as
  "that miracle of Zeeland," and Tromp as the "lightning of war "; Cornelius
  Evertsen was left at sea and fell on the Virginia fleet and made rich
  captives. The labours of the valiant admirals were over for the winter, but
  there was no repose for the Prince of Orange; on the last day of September he
  left the Hague with the army and his principal friends and officers&mdash;the
  young Rhyngrave, Count Styrum, Montpouillan (so praised by Prince John
  Maurice), Zuylestein, Bentinck, Ouwerkerk, La Leck and other noble
  officers&mdash;and proceeded by Rotterdam and Dort to the Old Bosche, then to
  Bergen-op-Zoom, where he arrived with seventeen regiments of horse and seven
  regiments of foot, and marched immediately to the general rendezvous at
  Roosendaal; at Clampthout, near Antwerp, he met Monterey, the Governor of the
  Spanish Netherlands; on October 7 he went to Antwerp, where he was conducted
  through double ranks of armed citizens to his lodgings "with much state and
  affection," and saluted by the Spanish with profound deference as Royal
  Highness. There was more than compliments and ceremony in this visit, which
  marked a step forward in William III's design and consolidated the treaties
  signed at the Hague in August. On October 10th/20th war was formally declared
  by Spain against France; the Prince de Vaudemont and other generals were sent
  to secure the frontiers, and trumpeters went to the French governors of the
  adjacent cities to announce that his Most Catholic Majesty was at war with
  his Most Christian Majesty.</p>

  <p>Having accomplished this stroke of policy, the Stadtholder returned to
  Brabant and marched to join some Spanish troops at Herenthals; he had the
  supreme command over these as well as over the armies of the States; the
  Spanish general under him was the Marquis D'Assentar, whose forces consisted
  of 11,000 horse and 14,000 foot.</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>During an alliance with Spain that lasted throughout his life, William III
  complained bitterly of the greed, poverty, slowness and idleness of this
  proud and decayed nation, and their lack of vigour frequently hampered his
  plans and fretted his ardent spirit, but their help was essential to him, and
  in these early campaigns there does not seem to have been much to complain of
  in the conduct of the Spanish; Monterey was an energetic, loyal and steadfast
  friend, a fine type of Spanish grandee; most of the Spanish officers were
  brave and gallant, and the Spanish troops compared favourably with the Dutch
  militia, while the conduct of D'Assentar was praised by Montecuculi.</p>

  <p>Louis XIV chose this moment to return to Versailles (October 14th/24th) to
  enjoy the fruits of those successes which were daily becoming more dubious;
  while he was expanding his grandeur in all the pleasures and excitements of
  the court he had made the most luxurious and voluptuous in the world, the
  Prince of Orange was laboriously marching to join Montecuculi who was
  watching Turenne in Franconia, whose depredations in Wurtzburg (begun on a
  pretence that the Bishop of Wurtzburg, a hesitant neutral, had helped the
  Imperialists by providing a bridge over the Maine) had kindled a war in that
  province, the inhabitants harrying the French to their discomfiture.</p>

  <p>The French were uncertain as to where the Prince of Orange would proceed;
  by brilliant manoeuvres he outwitted the vigilance of Luxembourg, who was
  "roused up for the security of the Netherlands conquest," and, moving his men
  secretly and rapidly, hastened through Eindhoven to Venlo, passed the Maas on
  a bridge of boats on the 23rd, marched into Juliers, camped at Dalen and
  Kaldenkirchen, took the city of Bedburg, and, while the French were still
  uncertain of his aim, drew higher up the Rhine, and on October 27,
  <i>n.s.</i>, made his headquarters at the Abbey of Brauiler, two miles from
  Cologne.</p>

  <p>There is a curiously intimate account available of this campaign; while we
  can read an exact description of Montecuculi's laborious, painful and
  masterly march from Egra in his official memoranda, told in the stately
  Italian that was the court language of Vienna, we can read a description of
  William III's march to meet him as it appeared to the soured view of a
  civilian, the Prince's secretary, who duly noted every day such incidents as
  impressed his mind, for in this campaign there was attached to His Highness
  as his secretary Constantine Huygens, brother of the great mathematician
  Christian Huygens, then resident in France, and son of the old, loyal,
  valiant, Constantine Huygens, Secretary of Prince Frederic Henry, and still
  closely associated with the Dowager, Amalia of Solms-Braunfels, who was
  anxiously watching the war from the Hague. In a letter from the elder
  Huygens, March 17, 1672:</p>

  <p>"His Highness came to me with a laughing face and said, 'I congratulate
  you also about your son, who is from now my secretary as I have promised
  you.'"</p>

  <p>Constantine Huygens, who remained until his death in 1696 in this intimate
  service with William III, kept a day-book or diary in which he noted down his
  impressions of these events so great outwardly, and inwardly, as viewed by a
  man like Huygens, so disconcerting, so uncomfortable, and so detestable.
  Huygens, the well-bred, fastidious civilian, found his task most irksome, and
  the circumstances of war most tedious. He was continually sick, he was
  continually falling from his horse: "<i>J'ai tumbay d'un cheval</i>" is a
  frequent entry; he had a succession of bad meals and poor lodgings; the
  Prince kept him up late at night and roused him early in the morning, either
  to decipher letters or take down despatches from dictation; he lost his
  baggage on the way&mdash;from his point of view the war was more a nuisance
  than a disaster. He left, however, and all unconsciously, for he was a prosy
  man not given to picturesque phrase or lively description, a series of
  pictures of this war, of long exhausting tramps, vile lodgings, scarcity of
  food, the rain, the fogs, the cold, bivouacking in old abbeys, inns, in
  clergymen's houses; the young officers&mdash;Zuylestein, Ouwerkerke, Odyck,
  Count Salm (the young Rhyngrave)&mdash;gossiping and playing cards and
  billiards among themselves, selling each other horses, going into Brussels to
  buy lace and cloth, pictures and statuary; and, dominant above all, the
  figure of the young Prince, by turns cheerful and melancholic, telling and
  listening to the good stories with the rest, interested in the little
  drawings that Huygens made of towns and landscapes through which they passed,
  pleased with a watch, or a new microscope, giving Huygens commissions to buy
  tapestry and busts, to view pictures&mdash;Rubens and Van Dycks&mdash;with
  the idea of purchasing them on his behalf; distressed by the death of Peter
  Post, his architect&mdash;always of an inexhaustible energy, sparing himself
  nothing; now riding with the cavalry, now marching with the infantry;
  perpetually reviewing troops, and cashiering captains whose companies were
  not in a proper condition; dictating and writing innumerable despatches,
  lodging wretchedly, feeding poorly, knowing every kind of discomfort and
  fatigue, ever his eye and his hand on the inmost policies of Europe.</p>

  <p>While the Prince was, by this bold move, evading his enemies who expected
  him in the south, Huygens, who seems to have had no conception of his
  master's designs, was making his brief notes of the march, giving, among so
  much that is dull or inadequate, little sketches that have the air of a
  Callot or a Wouverman; most of these fall after the date of this campaign,
  but from September 29, 1673, to December 6, 1673, Huygens has these faint
  gleams, intimate, poignant and tantalizing, to throw on the life of the
  Prince with the army as he pushed forward to evade Condé and Turenne, to meet
  Montecuculi; they are offered here in literal translation and without
  comment; the Count Dohna mentioned (who died at the Hague of wounds received
  at Maastricht) was one of the nephews of the Princess Amalia; the dates in
  the following are as given by Huygens, and presumably new style.</p>

  <p style="text-align:center"><i>October</i></p>

  <p><i>Sunday, 1st</i>. OUDENBOSCH. Very bad weather with continual rain and
  wind; His Highness at prayers in the afternoon...I wrote to the Hague to have
  a mirror and some scissors mended, etc.</p>

  <p><i>2nd.</i> His Highness at the chase...I was in trouble about my baggage
  and horses of which I had had no news since they embarked last Saturday.</p>

  <p><i>3rd.</i> His Highness at the chase...my baggage has not arrived and I
  have no news of it.</p>

  <p><i>4th.</i> M. le Prince left with some officers to meet the Comte de
  Monterey, I could not go my baggage not having arrived...M. le Prince
  returned at seven in the evening, and asked me laughing, why I had not come?
  I said my horses had not come. I learnt that he had been enclosed with M. de
  Monterey for three hours...the fare at the second table was very
  indifferent...</p>

  <p><i>5th.</i> M. le Prince went to Bergues after dinner and returned at
  seven, and in his chamber he said that Comte de Dona was dead. I changed my
  English horse from Bentinck against one of M. le Rhyngrave.</p>

  <p><i>7th.</i> His Highness went in a coach to Antwerp at eleven o'clock...a
  continual rain pierced us to the skin...I had to dry myself in a very bad
  cabaret called Biekof where we supped very badly and I slept on straw leaving
  the beds to the others.</p>

  <p><i>9th.</i> ROSENDAEL...His Highness wrote to the States with the secret
  news that France and Spain were coming to an open rupture.</p>

  <p><i>14th.</i> His Highness arrived after us, having marched with the
  infantry...His Highness lodged at Santhoven with the cure, called Joncker
  Willem&mdash;who is really noble.</p>

  <p><i>15th.</i> SANTH OVEN...His Highness wrote to "Messieurs des Affaires
  Secrettes" that...he will join the Spanish troops to march to Venlo, with the
  design of passing the Maas, passing through Gulick and Cologne and taking his
  measures according to the movement of the Emperor's troops and those of the
  enemies.</p>

  <p><i>16th</i>...Very cold in the morning, a white frost at night, at midday
  very bad weather, wind and rain. His Highness spoke at table, where I was, of
  the death of the King of England, his grandfather, and said that if the Duke
  of York died before the King it would be a dispute as to whether his
  daughters should be preferred to him (the Prince) in regard to the
  crown...Passing Herentals, a wretched little village in Brabant, the Prince
  dismounted to speak to the Marquis d'Assentar who told him that Spain had
  declared war on France "<i>en toutes ses terres</i>."</p>

  <p><i>17th</i>. We marched from Lichtaert to Mol, a large village, pleasant
  and handsome...His Highness, being at table, sent for me to decipher a letter
  from-the Count Montecuculi...who, writing on the 9th instant, said that his
  army suffered from lack of forage and food, and that notwithstanding, he
  intended to give battle to Turenne...</p>

  <p><i>19th</i>...We slept at Peer, a little village of the county of
  Liege...I dined with M. le Rhyngrave in the heath.</p>

  <p>As we were near this place His Highness called me and said, "Put on your
  hat," and then: "You must give these safeguards that I have signed to the
  officers of the Guards&mdash;each is to have a certain sum, and for you, you
  shall have for your right a half-ducat." I replied that this was as His
  Highness pleased...it was very fine and warm weather.</p>

  <p><i>22nd</i>. BAERLE...I dined with His Highness who recounted at table to
  the Rhyngrave how Dyckvelt had, at Utrecht, governed the whole province by
  the means of three women, to wit, Mesdames de Borneval, Schadé et Hamel.</p>

  <p>Immediately after dinner His Highness went to set the guards and
  reconnoitre the avenues, and I went with Walenbourg to Venlo with the design
  to get myself a cap...rain continuous...Rooseboom told me that Beverning had
  nearly killed Van Bergen in a drinking bout.</p>

  <p><i>23rd</i>...I hastily drew a sketch of Venlo from the top of a hill,
  which His Highness perceiving, would see my little drawing...I had a
  misfortune when crossing the bridge over the Maas, the sabre of a horseman
  becoming entangled in the bridle of my horse.</p>

  <p><i>24th</i>. KALDEKIRCHEN...I was all the afternoon putting into cipher a
  letter from His Highness to Count Waldeck, in which he told him what had been
  resolved yesterday at the Council of war...</p>

  <p><i>25th</i>. I wrote to Madame la Princesse and my wife.</p>

  <p><i>27th</i>. We marched from Koninxhoven to an abbey, four good leagues
  distant and two hours from Cologne...called <i>Brawiler</i>, large and
  rich...the evening at half-past nine when all, including His Highness, were
  at table, there was a cry of fire, and all running to see what it was, I saw
  the large stables of the cloisters were burning. I met in the same moment,
  Wilde, who was crying like a woman, and who told me my horses and theirs were
  burnt, and no one knew what had become of Vlack and Offenberg who were
  sleeping in the stables...I remarked the pigeons, who had their little ones
  in the burning building, flying amid the flames, smoke and sparks. I lost my
  three horses, their equipage and a coverlet of Japan, that was apparently
  stolen from me.</p>

  <p><i>29th</i>. I left at eight in the morning with M. le Rhyngrave for
  Cologne...I returned to Brawiler in the dark with my valet, the road was full
  of drunk soldiers.</p>

  <p><i>31st</i>. In marching to Metternich, as I was with M. le Rhyngrave, we
  met a little lackey, in a green habit, weeping and carrying a child of about
  a year old on his back, who was the daughter of the nurse of Madame de
  Metternich, who he was trying to carry into Cologne, but could hardly do so.
  M. le Rhyngrave gave the child to a soldier to carry and sent back the lackey
  that he might follow in a cart to Cologne.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>So ends the <i>Journaal</i> for October, with its odd glimpses of great
  and small affairs in a medley as they appeared to this middle-aged, sedate
  gentleman, who so intensely disliked campaigning. All the inhabitants of the
  province (the Elector held a hesitant neutrality) fled into the city of
  Cologne before the advancing army; the roads were blocked by fugitives; on
  November 1 the Prince was before the small town of Remmich and summoned it to
  allow his troops to enter; on a refusal the Rhyngrave (who appears to great
  advantage in Huygens' Memoirs) went with Huygens to argue with the obstinate
  burghers, giving them fair promises for their goods, lives and safety;
  encouraged by one obstinate citizen, Remmich most foolishly refused and asked
  for two hours to deliberate, upon which the Rhyngrave turned his horse,
  saying, "Das geben wir euch nicht "; in an hour and a half the town was taken
  by the Dutch Guards and the Courland regiment, and Huygens, for once detailed
  and expressive, gives a lively picture of warfare in the seventeenth century;
  the town was given over to pillage with an order to respect the women:
  "<i>qui fut assez bien observé</i>." Huygens missed the Prince in the
  horrible confusion, could not find his quarters, and wandered in the
  disordered streets until he met the Rhyngrave, who was trying to restrain the
  soldiers, saving the women, rescuing two girls from the <i>mauvaise
  protection de quelque Dragons</i> and leading them to a house where M. de
  Valkenburg had gathered the women; these dragoons were Courlanders, and the
  Rhyngrave could hardly control their savagery, though he exerted his
  authority to do so, hastening to the church where many wretched fugitives
  were gathered and turning out the pillagers, and then to a chateau where
  other citizens were cowering, demanding pity on their knees; the Rhyngrave
  reassured them, and after doing his utmost for these unfortunate civilians
  returned to his lodging with Huygens, who leaves this dreadful
  picture&mdash;like a vignette by Callot.</p>

  <p>"...all was pillaged, all the coffers broken, feathers in the rooms, in a
  word, the last desolation. In a kitchen near the room where we supped we
  found on the floor a dead woman who had had a great blow from a sabre in the
  stomach, and a little child of about a year who lived but seemed to be doing
  badly (<i>se porter mal</i>). We supped and slept in this house. It happened
  in this pillage that a dragoon when he made a peasant prisoner would take
  even his chemise, and upon the peasant resisting another Courlander came up
  behind and cut off his head <i>tout net</i>."</p>

  <p>Montecuculi had outwitted Turenne, and after the sack of Remmich the
  Prince received letters from him that he had crossed the Rhine and was at
  Coblentz; on November 4 the Prince had come up to the Imperialist quarters in
  a little village near Bonn, which was being hastily fortified in the modern
  manner. Conde, Luxembourg, Turenne, had all alike failed to prevent this
  momentous meeting; in the mud, the dark, the cold, before the poor lodgings
  of a wretched village, William of Orange dismounted to clasp hands with
  Montecuculi.</p>

  <p>The officers wandered about seeking food and shelter, the march had been
  so swift that no quartermaster had been able to go ahead; Huygens contrived
  to find a good supper with the Rhyngrave, who seems to have been a man of
  resource...but "His Highness and M. de Montecuculi had hardly anything to
  eat."</p>

  <p>The following day Huygens saw the Imperialist Commander for the first
  time; he and the Prince rode up a high hill and surveyed for "<i>assez long
  temps</i>" the town of Bonn lying beneath them; then the Prince went to his
  quarters in a convent on the banks of the Rhine; they were so near to Bonn
  that they could hear the cannon firing from the alarmed fort. At midnight
  there was an alarm that some French under M. D'Humières were coming to
  succour the town. The Prince sent a cavalier to fetch Huygens (whom he wished
  to write a letter) to the bivouac where he had gone on this news; all the
  cavalry were under arms all night, sitting their horses in readiness in the
  winter dark, and Huygens, ever mindful of his own comfort, states that he was
  not able to return to his own lodgings till eight in the morning.</p>

  <p>He gives this picture, so unconsciously vivid:</p>

  <p>"His Highness was near a fire on the edge of a little wood of poplars; a
  drummer wounded before Rheinbach was dying close under the poplars. It was a
  beautiful night."</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>

  <p>William III had all in posture for taking Bonn, an important and
  stoutly-fortified city which the French believed could not be easily
  overmastered; the magazines and stores were newly replenished, and there was
  a French garrison under Brigadier Revillon of over two thousand men;
  Major-General Lansberg commanded in the city for His Electoral Highness the
  Bishop Elector; and Montecuculi summoned him, as a fief of the Emperor, to
  send out the French and take in the army of "<i>Sua Majesta Cesarea</i>";
  Lansberg replied that it was his master's wish that the French garrison be
  retained, upon which "the Leaguer set down before Bonn."</p>

  <p>By the end of November the batteries were ready; neither Luxembourg nor
  Turenne made any effort to succour the place, and Marèchal D'Humières, French
  Commander in the Spanish Netherlands, who did do so, was beaten off and fell
  back on Nuytz; the Prince and the Spanish Commander, D'Assentar, directed the
  works in person, and by the 10th had stormed the outworks and got within a
  few paces of the city wall, so that the defending cannon fired over their
  heads; furious attacks continued for three days, during which the Prince
  found full scope for his energy and valour; the Dutch and Spaniards had
  severe losses, among them many noble officers; Montecuculi, after the Prince
  had stormed and taken the Cologne Gate, placed in readiness the mines and,
  having called a parley, he invited the French to consider the situation and
  to deliver the city without waiting for the last effort, thereby making
  things worse for themselves and ruining the citizens for nothing, already,
  "<i>assai tormentata dalle bombe e fuochi</i>"; there was no hope of succour,
  D'Humières being already in retreat and Turenne no nearer than
  Creutznach.</p>

  <p>Revillon saw the wisdom of these arguments and Bonn capitulated, November
  11th/21st, 1673, the tenth day of the siege and third of the assault; Count
  Köningsmarck was among the slain.</p>

  <p>The French made the best terms possible in their conditions; Montecuculi,
  whose behaviour showed great judgment and dignity, gave them the honours of
  war, but refused any questions about the Elector-Bishop, as political, not
  military, affairs that must be referred "<i>alla Maesta dell'
  Imperatore</i>."</p>

  <p>The prestige of this success was enormous&mdash;it at once inclined the
  Rhinish princes towards the Allies; the French were emptying their garrison
  in the Netherlands to put men into the field, and the news that reached the
  Prince from Waldeck was that Luxembourg was likely to abandon the Utrecht and
  Guelders conquests; there was good news from England, too, the laborious
  Swedish mediators having at length brought peace with England in sight, and
  on reasonable terms; while Montecuculi and William III were entertained by
  the Marquis of Grana, the new commandant in Bonn, the Margrave of Baden-Baden
  was sweeping down the forts along the Rhine, Brueil, Lechnich, Kerpen and
  Nuytz.</p>

  <p>Both the policy and the arms of the young Stadtholder had been crowned by
  a definite triumph, and his already brilliant reputation had been immensely
  enhanced by the success of the march that had evaded Turenne, his skilful
  juncture with Montecuculi and the audacity of his valour before Bonn;
  Montecuculi, though claiming pride of place for "<i>l'armata Cesarea dell'
  Imperio</i>," gave a graceful tribute to the conduct of the young Stadtholder
  and his ally, D'Assentar. "I esteemed the Prince of Orange and the Marquis
  d'Assentar for the fatigues and perils they had been in to take the town."
  (<i>Stimava il Principe d'Orange e il Marchese d'Assentar, come quelli ch'
  avendo afficate e stati nei pericoli per l'acquisto della piazza</i>.)
  Huygens gives his version of this brilliant and important siege, his worries
  about his delayed baggage, his suppers and card games with Brederode, Ginckel
  and Opdam, his chocolate drinking with cronies; when his master was carrying
  the ravelines before the gates of Bonn, Huygens noted the musket shots from
  the safe harbour of his chamber, and fell into a melancholy when the Prince
  carried away the letters without waiting for his own&mdash;"which I was about
  to sign, and now I do not know when, or how it will go."</p>

  <p>The Prince had suggested to Huygens that he should make a sketch of the
  hill with the cloisters of St. Croix, Montecuculi's headquarters, and during
  the siege Huygens went for this purpose to the Elector's pleasure-house of
  Poplensdorf, where he climbed a tower and saw the city three or four hundred
  feet away; but the intense cold made his hands incapable of holding a pencil
  while a cannon ball fell amid the terraces of the ruined gardens; that
  evening the city surrendered.</p>

  <p>That evening, too, died William Nassau, Lord of Leersham, younger brother
  of Zuylestein, he who had taken an honorary degree with the Prince at Oxford
  in 1670&mdash;he had been ill of a fever for several days, and, as his father
  so recently had done before him, had sacrificed his life for the Netherlands;
  the second Nassau since the war began to perish for the Dutch Republic.</p>

  <p>When William III was entering Bonn, Huygens was chaffering about horses,
  sketching views from windows, and noting with bored reserve, "It rained all
  day."</p>

  <p>He was not impressed by the old Duke of Lorraine, the redoubtable Charles
  IV, the father of the Prince de Vaudemont, who came to dine with His
  Highness, and whom Huygens describes as wearing "a very ugly little peruke of
  blonde red hair," and having "a large nose, eyes a little bleared, no sword
  or spurs." It is as well, sometimes, to see great characters and great events
  through the eyes of little men absorbed in little affairs, and Constantine
  Huygens has the merit of plain dryness; he does not distort either
  sentimentally or emotionally; it could be wished that he had left some
  portrait of his master, the slight active figure, the countenance at once
  stately and generous, serene and ardent, the manner candid and touched with
  irony, the personality that gave an air of nobility and heroism to all it
  approached, the laborious and valiant <i>veldheer</i> toiling without cease
  in the dull, stern tasks of every day, who was also a statesman who had
  within him the power to change the face of affairs in Europe.</p>

  <p>While the Prince was approaching Cologne, Prince John Maurice of
  Nassau-Siegen, isolated in the miseries of the flooded Friesland, was at
  length "<b>attaqué par 70 années</b>" asking leave to retire to the Hague
  (October 5th/15th); disabled by illness, confined to his room, almost to his
  bed, he felt himself no longer equal to the command; the country was under
  water and in no danger from the enemy, and the stalwart old general would be
  willing to return "on the first command of Your Highness."</p>

  <p>The Prince sent him a letter of thanks, written from Blabsheim, Juliers,
  November 25, and it is agreeable to know that Temple, the following year,
  found the resolute and cheerful soldier in his handsome house on the
  Vyverburg, enjoying the famous parrot, and the comforts of the Hague, and
  pleasant to read a letter the veteran wrote from his country house at Cleves
  in 1677, to William Bentinck, wherein he regrets having missed the chance of
  kissing the hands of "our dear master," and extols with gaiety and enthusiasm
  the charms of his rural palace&mdash;"which you might copy at Sorghivliet and
  His Highness at Soestdyck"; he died two years later. A picture of this palace
  is now at Hampton Court Palace; the Hague residence of Prince John Maurice is
  familiar to most as the Mauritshuis; the man himself is largely forgotten,
  but he was not the least worthy of the great princes of the House of Nassau.
  His robust and cheerful personality was depicted by the graceful and rigorous
  brush of Honthorst, and engraved by Soutman; in his own mansion, the
  Mauritshuis, hangs another portrait by his protégé, John de Baen, which shows
  him in the prime of his splendour, with cuirass and mantle, blue ribbon on
  his breast, gauntletted hand on hip, in the background the colonnades, the
  fountains, the chateau, the perspective of a park&mdash;all the elegancies in
  which he delighted, and on the pedestal of a column the inscription in exact
  clear writing&mdash;"<i>Request Aen S. Fürst Gen<sup>de</sup> Johan Maurits
  Prince Van Nassau</i>," the title explains the man..."<i>Orbis qua
  patet</i>."</p>

  <p>His brother, George Frederic of Nassau-Siegen, the haughty, melancholy,
  austere soldier who died at Metz of wounds received at Seneffe, was with the
  Prince on the march to Cologne.</p>

  <p>The taking of Bonn was a turning point in the war; the kings of France and
  England paused to contemplate their amazing antagonist; the genius of William
  III had overturned all their designs; they could no longer hope for a wholly
  advantageous peace by which to humiliate for ever the Dutch Republic,
  establish England as a Papal State and ruin the Hapsburgs; Louis XIV keenly
  desired the cessation of the war with as much glory as he could possibly
  acquire; it was known that this was not the wish of William III, and that he
  was doing his energetic utmost to encourage his Spanish and Austrian allies
  to hold out until they had reduced the Bourbon into accepting their own
  terms. Charles II, overwhelmed by the pressure of his people and his
  parliament, was already beginning to listen to the Swedish negotiations. By
  the end of 1673, while the Prince was at Bonn, nearly thirty forts and towns,
  including the important town of Utrecht, had been returned to the Dutch.
  After over a year of acute agony the Dutch Republic was saved, only by the
  stern resolve of one youth who, by holding out with inflexible obstinacy
  against what seemed crushing blows, by refusing to listen to counsels of
  despair, had gained that respite which had proved fatal to Louis XIV's
  ambitious projects.</p>

  <p>At twenty-three (it was on his birthday that William III had clasped hands
  with Montecuculi) the young Stadtholder was the unconquerable soul of a
  formidable alliance against the pretensions of France. He had already
  dedicated himself with the most loyal and tenacious allegiance to the ideal
  that dominated his career&mdash;the establishment of the balance of power in
  Europe, the return to the principles and conditions of the Treaty of the
  Pyrenees.</p>

  <p>He had also commenced (as the Treaty of Westminster, forced out of Charles
  II the following year, was to prove) an alliance with the most powerful of
  his supporters, the nobles and gentlemen of England, the parliament and the
  people who were one day to offer him their Crown when he had taken up again
  in 1688 his task begun in 1672, and only most reluctantly relinquished in
  1678 (Peace of Nymwegen).</p>

  <p>When he parted from Montecuculi before Bonn and returned to the Hague to
  receive those disliked ovations (he avoided "a triumphant and glorious
  reception" by arriving secretly at night) that would have intoxicated most
  Princes of his age, he was well aware of the darkness and difficulties ahead,
  of the unequal nature of the struggle, of the immensity of the obstacles of
  the humiliations, sacrifices, fatigues and perils that were to be his part;
  but his candid courage and his unconquerable patience were not
  discouraged.</p>

  <p>Later, he himself illustrated this in a simile whose simplicity is heroic,
  when coming from one named by Temple, "the greatest captain and boldest
  soldier."</p>

  <p>When, in November, 1676, Gaspard Fagel, ill and depressed, was for making
  the peace on the terms suggested by France and England (the abandonment of
  Flanders to Louis XIV), adding there was not "one man in Holland against it,"
  the young Stadtholder replied with passion:</p>

  <p>"I know one, and that is myself&mdash;I will hinder it as long as I can,"
  and then he added: "I must go on and take my fortune...I did this morning see
  a poor old man tugging alone in a little boat, with his goods, against the
  eddy of a sluice, upon a canal, when, with the last endeavours, he just got
  up to the place intended, the force of the eddy carried him quite back again;
  but he turned his boat as soon as he could, and fell to his oars again, and
  thus three or four times while I saw him. This old man's business and mine
  are too like one another. I ought, however, to do just as the old man,
  without knowing what will succeed any more than what did succeed in the poor
  man's case. I must go on and take my fortune."</p>

  <p>Of his election to this fortune William III was assured; he was acutely
  aware of the bitter burden his life was to be, but he saw it, from the moment
  he refused the allurements of Buckingham and Arlington before Bodegraven, as
  a perfect design; his long-sighted lucid vision was not deceived by either
  the triumphs or the disappointments of the present; he looked ahead to a
  future which he well surmised might be after his own death, when the soldiers
  and statesmen who were his pupils should accomplish his design of checking
  for ever the power that threatened to cramp, and perhaps annihilate, the
  liberties of Europe.</p>

  <h3>EARLY PORTRAITS AND MEDALS OF WILLIAM HENRY,<br>
  PRINCE OF ORANGE, TO HIS TWENTY-SIXTH YEAR</h3>

  <p class="first">The following is a summary and incomplete list; portraits of
  William III are numerous and mostly inferior, so many being replicas of one
  original, or coarse imaginary likenesses, often crude and even grotesque.</p>

  <p>The list includes the better known pictures, and most of those pretending
  to any artistic or historical interest, and ends with the Wissing and the
  Netscher in the Rijks, the dates of which are uncertain; the next picture of
  any importance is that by Sir Peter Lely, definitely dated 1678, engraved by
  A. Blooteling.</p>

  <p class="note"
     style="text-align:center">William Henry, Prince of Orange, and Marie of
     Nassau, daughter of Frederic Henry, Prince of Orange (1642-1688),
     afterwards married to the Count Palatine Louis Henry Maurice, last Duke of
     Zimmern. Signed and dated, 1633, Gerard Van Honthorst (1590-1656).
     Collection Maritshuis, The Hague, No. 64. From an <i>overmantel</i> in the
     Huis ten Bosh (<i>schoorsteenstuk</i>).</p><br>

  <p>The earliest picture of William III of any importance, he being at this
  date, taking the time to be summer, about two and a half years old; the
  features are, however, very clearly marked and show an unmistakable likeness
  to the later portraits.</p>

  <p>The painting is very charming, in the best Dutch manner, smooth, clear and
  elegant.</p>

  <p>The Princess, who looks older than her age of eleven, is dressed exactly
  like a grown lady in a blue satin gown with a tight bodice, muslin fichu,
  cuffs and apron, pearl necklace, ear-rings and drop at bosom in the fashion
  familiar from portraits of this period; her hair is tied with knots of orange
  ribbon, and in the left hand she holds a stiff wreath of starry flowers, and
  turns slightly to the right to accept some more blooms from her nephew, who
  advances towards the rustic bench on which she is seated.</p>

  <p>He is dressed like a girl in low bodice, full, stiff, long skirt, red
  embroidered with gold, tight waist muslin apron that he holds out full of
  flowers, and a tight muslin cap with bunches of ribbon; the earnest face
  gazes at the spectator; it is obviously a good likeness, and the remarkably
  well-formed features (for so young a child) bear a family resemblance to the
  portraits of his father, mother and aunts.</p>

  <p>One of the most interesting and pleasing of the early portraits.</p>

  <p>The portrait of a child in a hat by Rembrandt, formerly in the Spencer
  Collection, called "William of Orange," represents a pale boy in a plumed hat
  aged four to six years; there is a certain likeness to the authentic
  portraits of William III, but the child is too fair; it seems doubtful, too,
  if Rembrandt ever enjoyed Court patronage; beyond the one commission received
  from William II for a series of Biblical pictures, he appears to have painted
  no other royal personages or aristocrats; he resided mainly at Amsterdam, a
  city hostile to the House of Nassau, and though he lived till William III was
  nineteen years old (1669) he never painted him again.</p>

  <p>If this picture be of William III, it must have been painted when
  Rembrandt was at the height of his powers&mdash;1655 or so, and possibly was
  executed from memory from a glimpse of the little Prince in a coach in the
  Hague.</p>

  <p>Dr. Hofstede de Groot in <i>Catalogue Raissonè of the Most Eminent Dutch
  Painters of the Seventeenth Century</i> (translated, Ed. Hawke, Vol. IV,
  1915. Macmillan, London), describes this picture as "A Boy with Fair Curls,"
  and states definitely it is not William of Orange.</p>

  William of Nassau, Prince of Orange, aged 9 years. By Cornelius Janssen
  Van der Ceulen. In the Collection of Count Godard Bentinck,
  Amerongen.</p><br>

  <p>A beautiful painting, half length, life size, in buff coat and steel
  cuirass; the sleeves are slashed to show a full white shirt beneath, plain
  white linen cravat tied with a narrow ribbon, sash round waist, right hand
  resting on a staff.</p>

  <p>The face looks directly out of the canvas and is cleverly painted, even a
  slight inequality in the eyes being noticed; the hair curls on to the
  shoulders, the likeness to the infant in the Honthorst in the Maritshuis is
  very marked. The expression, serene and compelling, is finely rendered; both
  for simplicity of costume and dignity of pose the portrait is admirable.</p>

  <p>Cornelius Janssen Van der Ceulen (1593-1664) was born in London, of Dutch
  parents, and resided till 1650 in England; most of his portraits are those of
  the English nobility. He is supposed to have been influenced by Vandyck. This
  must have been one of his last portraits, painted 1659.</p>

  <p>Till 1650 he signed his pictures "Johnson"&mdash;i.e. Janssen.</p>

  <p class="note">William Henry, Prince of Orange. Painter unknown, Royal
Collection,
  Hampton Court.</p>

  <p>William, aged ten to twelve, in classic armour and drapery, full length
  scape with a statue in the background; delicately painted, pleasing greenish
  harmony, formerly catalogued as by Sir G. Kneller.</p>

  <p>Kneller studied in Holland, possibly under Rembrandt and Bols; this would
  be a work of that period (1660-1662), but that makes Kneller (1646-1723)
  fourteen to fifteen years of age; even if William is fourteen in the portrait
  (and he does not appear so old), Kneller would be under thirty; this appears
  improbable, either the picture is not by Kneller or it is painted by him from
  the work of an earlier artist; it is a pleasing and decorative painting and
  has never been photographed before.</p>

  <p>The last catalogue to Hampton Court Collection gives the painter of this
  portrait as "unknown."</p>

  <p>Possibly it is by J. Mytens (1614-1670), whose picture of a youth,
  Frederic Louis Van Brederode Bolsmeet(?), No. 113, in Roman armour in the
  Maritshuis is much the same in treatment.</p>

  <p>A full-length in armour, aged fourteen years; pale blue sash tied on

  William II, particularly the Windsor Honthorst, the features appear too short
  and rounded.</p>

  <p>Adrian Hanneman (1601-1670) was a pupil of Ravesteyn and Mytens; he worked
  under Vandyck in London, after 1640 at the Hague.</p>

  <p>Under date November 17th, 1664, Amalia of Solms-Braunfels, Princess
  Dowager of Orange, wrote to Constantine Huygens the elder about this picture
  and another that Hanneman was painting, one for his grandmother, Queen
  Henrietta Maria, and one for the Duchess of York (Anne Hyde); she mentions
  that he was "slow over the work," "<i>een beetje langzaam</i>."</p>

     style="text-align:center">William Henry, Prince of Orange, by J.
     Huysmans(?)<br>
  Royal Collection, Hampton Court. Number in last catalogue, 945.</p><br>

  <p>A beautiful and uncommon treatment of the subject; the Prince in classic
  draperies moves to left, his shoulder is bare, a jewelled band clasps his
  falling shirt, he holds a long baton, and a dog jumps upright, he looks out
  at spectator, head and bust are very finely painted; the likeness is obvious
  and the expression full of melancholy charm; William's age, eleven to
  thirteen; this J. Van Huysmans is not Justus Van Huysmans who was the father
  and teacher of his more famous son, Jan Van Huysmans, whose "Blomenstuk" were
  so fashionable at the end of the seventeenth century, but presumably Jacob
  Van Huysmans, the portrait painter mentioned by Pepys. Jacob Huysmans,
  however (1656-1696), was six years younger than William III; either,
  therefore, he did not paint this picture or it is taken from some sketch by
  another artist and worked up with fanciful accessories possibly as a
  companion to "William, Duke of Gloucester, K.C.," now given to the same
  artist, but formerly called a G. Kneller (No. 947); this little Prince died
  July 30, 1700, aged eleven; when Jacob Huysmans died he would be (1696)
  seven, and that is assuming this is the last picture the artist painted; the
  child looks much older; and the question arises if this is William, Duke of
  Gloucester at all, and if either picture is by J. Huysman; it seems equally
  likely that it is Henry, Duke of Gloucester (1640-1660), and painted in
  Holland about 1655, that of William of Orange being done in the same style by
  the same hand a few years later, say 1662&mdash;or so; in each picture the
  boy's age appears ten to fourteen; the naming of many portraits is largely a
  matter of conjecture; in this case the classical attire prevents any clue
  from costume. The portrait of William III has been badly damaged twice by
  folding of the canvas.</p>

  The Five Stadtholders. By William Van Honthorst. Rijks Museum,
  Amsterdam, No. 1246. Reproduced in <i>The Netherlands Display'd</i>.
  Image added to PGA/RGL edition of book</p>

  <p>This very interesting family piece was originally over a chimney-piece in
  the Maritshuis, the favourite position for such paintings, portraits, or
  family groups.</p>

  <p>Of the five Princes represented, William I, Maurice, Frederic Henry,
  William II, William III, only the last could have been taken from life, but
  the likenesses of the other four may have been sketched from the sitters
  previously by Van Honthorst (1604-1666).</p>

  <p>William Van Honthorst died when William was sixteen, which fixes the limit
  for his age in this picture; he is probably about fourteen, and though the
  picture is sometimes called the "Five Stadtholders," there could have been
  little hope of his fulfilling his ambitious wish to occupy his ancestors'
  positions when this was painted; it is a tribute to family pride, and must
  have been executed when the fortunes of the heir of Orange Nassau were at the
  nadir.</p>

  <p>This Prince is to the extreme right of the picture, rather crowded to the
  edge of the canvas, and the only one in civilian dress, the other four being
  in the usual plate armour.</p>

  <p>His very elaborate attire is in the French style, ribbons, plumes and
  lace, with the Garter, and the figure is interesting for this costume, rare
  in the period of official portraiture which now began, and for the fact that
  there is no other important portrait of William between the ages of fifteen
  and twenty.</p>

  <p>The likeness to the earlier portraits is very strong, the face is
  delicately painted, and the figure is certainly a true representation of the
  Prince "in his habit as he lived" which is a difficult thing to find in this
  epoch; it is most unlikely that he ever wore armour before manhood, which
  fact gives even the Van der Ceulen portrait at Amerongen an air of
  unreality.</p>

  <p>A curious fact about this picture is that William's father, William II, is
  shown as a youth, only a year or so older than his son; William II died aged
  twenty-four, but here he appears no more than sixteen; the composition is
  stiff and the figure of William I unpleasing, but the painting is of great
  value and interest, out of place, of course, in a museum.</p>

  <p class="note">William of Nassau, Prince of Orange. A painting by Baen,
  formerly in the Buitenhof, circa 1673. Engraved by J. Houbraken.</p>
  <br>

  <p>William III, as he appeared in the desperate days of the <i>rampjaar</i>.
  Bust in armour with falling collar, long curls, to left, rocky background.
  Well executed, the face does not appear so long nor so melancholy as in the
  childish pictures.</p>

  <p>Johannes de Baen (1633-1702), a fashionable painter of this period of
  fashionable painters, afterwards entered the service of Charles II. His
  portraits of the De Witts are well known; the author does not know where the
  original of this engraving is now.</p>

  <p>His son was born the year of this painting, 1673, and twenty years later
  accompanied William to England, where he painted William, Duke of Gloucester,
  but died young in 1700, two years before his father.</p>

  <p>Arnold Houbraken (1660&mdash;after 1699), an industrious engraver, was the
  author of the famous <i>Lives of the Dutch Artists</i>, and father of Jacob
  Houbraken, who engraved the above; this picture is also engraved by G.
  Valck.</p>

  William of Nassau, Prince of Orange. By Caspar Netscher (1639-1684).
  Boymans Collection, Rotterdam, No. 325. Image added to PGA/RGL edition
  of book.</p><br>

  <p>Half length in armour, holding a baton. Not very well painted.</p>

  <p>It must have been painted before 1684, and probably represents William
  about twenty-six years old, the same date as the Blonmendael statuette to
  which it bears some resemblance.</p>

  <p>The picture is not very interesting, but is certainly William III. There
  is a full length, very much the same, in the Rijks Museum, with rocky
  foreground and battle in distance, also by Netscher; this is elegant and
  delicate, despite the formula of armour and setting; described No. 10.</p>

  <p>From this date on, the portraits of William are almost invariably in plate
  armour with blue ribbon and lace cravat.</p>

  <p>These two pictures are given as typical of the many portraits of William
  III painted by Caspar Netscher. Dr. Hofstede de Groot catalogues twenty-eight
  of these; three in the collection of the Duke of Portland at Welbeck, one a
  miniature on copper; these portraits, by a careful, fashionable painter, do
  not show much variety in treatment.</p>

    <p class="caption">William of Nassau, Prince of Orange.<br>
    By William Wissing. Rijks Museum, Amsterdam, No. 2691.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Full length, life-size, in armour, as a young man, probably under thirty;
  the figure is out of proportion and appears to represent a very tall man; the
  workmanship is inferior save for the bust and might be the work of a
  pupil.</p>

  <p>The armour is gilded, the cravat is of guipure lace, in the right hand a
  baton, the left resting on a helmet on a rock; in the background a
  combat.</p>

  <p>The attribution to Wissing is doubtful.</p>

  <p>What is practically a replica of this picture is in the Maritshuis
  Collection, but not at present exhibited.</p>

  <p>It is also given to Wissing and was shown in the Orange-Nassau Exhibition,
  the Hague, 1923, No. 196. Details as the Rijks Museum picture; a dog jumps up
  at the side; there are many copies of this official military portrait in the
  Netherlands, one each in the museums at Alkmaar and Hoorn.</p>

  <p>The head of the Rijks Museum picture is well executed and appears a
  likeness; it is obviously the same face as that of the earlier portraits,
  very like the Lely.</p>

  <p>William Wissing, an elegant-mannered painter (1656-1687) who died young,
  must, if he be the painter, have executed this portrait between 1673-1686.
  Probably these military pieces with combats in the background were painted
  during the period 1672-1678; after this the peace of Nymwegen and William's
  marriage would make such a portrait unsuitable. If this is so, William is
  aged twenty-eight at most; probably many copies of this portrait were made as
  presents to cities, nobles, neighbouring princes, etc.</p>

  <p>In the National Portrait Gallery (No. 1902) is a replica (half length
  only) of this picture, a poorish copy catalogued as "After Lely?" (labelled
  "after Van Vollekens"). If this surmise is correct, the Amsterdam picture is
  falsely attributed to Wissing and is by or after Lely, who in this case
  painted two portraits during William's visit in 1678.</p>

  <p class="note">William III, Prince Stadtholder. By Caspar Netscher
  (1639-1684). Rijks
  Museum, No. 1732. Image added to PGA/RGL edition of book.</p>

  <p>Full length in armour, standing in a landscape, holding baton on thigh,
  battle in background, helmet on rock.</p>

  <p>Though conventional in design, full of character, and carefully painted,
  like both the Netscher in the Boymans and the Blonmendael statuette; painted
  before William III was thirty-four, when artist died, probably before Peace
  of Nymwegen (1678), when these warlike pictures would be out of date. William
  III is therefore probably twenty-six or so; long, natural hair and Order of
  the Garter, amiable expression; charming group of flowers in foreground.</p>

  <p>A copy by Johan Van Huchtenburg is No. 1734, same collection.</p>

  <h3>MEDALS</h3>

  <p>The remaining pictorial material* for the life of William III to 1673
  consists of medals; the following list gives the most important.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* There were no images of the medals in the copy of
  <i>William Prince of Orange</i> used to make this e-book.]</p>

  <p>There appear to be no medals of William III before 1654, owing, no doubt,
  to the fall of his House and the eclipse of his fortunes; Bizot
  "<i>Medalische Historie</i>" gives this as the first with any reference to
  William III:</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h4>MEDAL NO. 1</h4>

  <p><i>Obverse:</i> A bust of the young Prince in bonnet with three rosettes,
  over, cap with two plumes, wreath of orange fruit and blossom; inscription:

     Orange (1631-1666).<br>
  By J. Mytens. The Mauritshuis, No. 429.</p><br>

  <p>There are not very many portraits and miniatures of this Princess, the
  eldest daughter of Charles I; among the most important are the famous Vandyck
  marriage picture, the Van der Helst, both in the Rijks Museum; and where she
  appears very plain, handsomely attired in satin and holding an orange; in
  this given here far more pleasing, with its luxury, elegance, melancholy and
  disdain, characteristic both of the woman and the period; there is a strong
  likeness to the early portraits of William III; the picture is almost a
  companion to that by the same painter (Mauritshuis, 114) which is probably
  Albertine of Nassau, wife of William Frederic of Nassau-Dietz, Stadtholder of
  Friesland, Groningen and Drenthe.</p>

  <p>This picture was at the château of Honsholredyck, in the chamber of Mary
  II of Orange; the portrait was described as that of Mary of Orange as an
  "<i>Americaine avec un nègre</i>."</p>

  From an engraving by P. Philippe from a painting by A. Rageneau.<br>
  British Museum.</p><br>

  <p>An official portrait, of some charm, showing William III, aged ten to
  twelve, classic background, baton, armour, heavily plumed helmet, and beneath
  the Arms of Orange-Nassau with the Prince's Coronet and the Garter; the face,
  wistful and candid, is tenderly painted; full titles (these do not always
  agree in the various inscriptions) on engraving and the motto: "Generosa in
  ortis feminia exsurgunt suos," which compliment to his mother makes it appear
  that the painting might have been taken during her lifetime, but the costume,
  etc., seems later; in feeling something like the so-called Kneller in Hampton
  Court, a picture of near the same date.</p>

  <p>This uncommon etching has been selected because of the homely details of

  shown in the habit he appeared in at The Hague and Breda, short coat with
  sleeves open over a very full shirt, deep collar tied with tassles and edged
  with lace, steeple-crowned hat with wide ruffle of ostrich feathers; the

  National Portrait Gallery, No. 1932,<br>
  Oil on canvas, after Johann Boeckhorst, circa 1659.</p><br>

  <p>A very interesting picture, showing the strong likeness to William III
  noted by John Evelyn; this prince, the youngest child of Charles I and
  Henrietta Maria, died immediately on his arrival in England, October 1660, so
  this picture must have been painted in Holland or France; it is possibly by
  Adrian Hanneman, one of the most successful followers of Vandyck, a favourite
  painter of the Duke of Gloucester's sister, the Princess Royal; the clear,
  cool, decided treatment is like that of Hanneman; the resemblance to the
  portrait of the Duke of Gloucester shown in the picture depicting the Banquet
  of the Royal Stewarts at the Hague, 1660, is very obvious; but it is not very
  much like the miniature at South Kensington, catalogued (1925) as after J.
  Van Munichhoven?</p>

  <p>All we know of this youth "of extreme hopeful promise" is as melancholy as
  his dark Italianate face; "he parted at nine years of age from his father,
  the night before that father's execution; he wandered about in poverty and
  exile"; he, as Condé told him, "saw how a battle was lost," and he died when
  fortune began to smile on the Stewarts; the first pageant in which the
  returned exile took part was his funeral procession by water, a black winter
  afternoon, from the palace of Whitehall to the Abbey of Westminster.</p>

  <p>A fine portrait by this vigorous painter showing the "great elector" in
  his early manhood; as Hanneman was high in favour at the Hague Court this may
  have been painted at the time of his marriage to Louisa of Orange, a
  reluctant bride, deep in a love affair with the Prince of Tarentum, but
  afterwards a devoted wife; later portraits of Frederic William show him as
  heavy jowled, low browed, to the point of deformity, and massive in figure;

  <p>There are many portraits of this Emperor whose notable countenance appears

  taken in early youth shows him with almost negroid features (an impression in
  Print Room, British Museum), as does a silver coin showing profile; a fine

  the "levade" and crushing a Turk; both reproduced in "German Baroque Art" by

     Jerusalem (1643-1690).<br>
  An engraving by J. Gole from a picture by William Wissing.</p><br>

  <p>Portraits of this Prince are very rare; this is a pleasing example of
  Wissing's elegant and courtly art, and represents the famous general in
  sumptuous attire with that "<i>air de parure</i>" so much admired in the
  seventeenth century; it has been found impossible to trace this picture; it
  is undoubtedly a Wissing, and the Duke's appearance coincides with the
  description of him extant; Wissing died in 1687, and, judging from the
  costume, the date of this portrait is about 1680, when the Duke would be
  thirty-seven years of age.</p>

     Commercy,<br>
  Governor of Milan, Knight of the Golden Fleece.<br>
  From a contemporary engraving, from a painting by Du Chatel.</p><br>

  <p>It is very difficult to find portraits of the Prince de Vaudemont; this
  was given as Charles V, Duke of Lorraine, and there is some likeness between
  the cousins; it is, however, undoubtedly Vaudemont, and probably was taken
  from a portrait painted about 1678, with a later inscription added; the
  costume is not of the period when Vaudemont was governor of Milan (1697); the
  rich attire is especially interesting as most male portraits of this century
  show the conventional plate armour. Beneath, the Arms of Lorraine and the
  Golden Fleece, and an inscription with the titles of the Prince and his
  services to the Empire, together with a reference to the ships in the
  background and Vaudemont's naval efforts; this Prince was a man of high
  honour and amiable character, an able if not very successful commander (his
  famous retreat before the Maréchal de Villeroi, in 1695, showed consummate
  skill), and a close friend of William III who signed his letters to him with
  the familiar "G." It was to the Prince de Vaudemont that William III wrote
  the first letter he was able to compose after his collapse following the
  death of his wife.</p>

     1st Earl of Rochford,<br>
  Viscount Tunbridge and Baron Enfield (1645-1709).<br>
  By Sir Peter Lely (1618-1680).<br>
  From the Collection of Count Godard Bentinck, Castle Zuylestein,
  Utrecht.</p><br>

  <p>This appears to be the only portrait in existence of the 1st Earl of
  Rochford, excepting one other in the same collection taken when an elderly
  man; it has been named Frederic de Nassau, Lord of Zuylestein, his father;
  but the age of the sitter and the costume make this impossible. The date is
  apparently 1672-1673, when Zuylestein joined the Dutch cavalry. He was, after
  brilliant services to William III, naturalized in England in 1689, Master of
  the Robes, 1689-1695, created Earl of Rochford, 1695, retired to Holland,
  1697, and died 1709.</p>

  <p>He married Jane, daughter of Sir Henry Wroth, after an unpleasant scandal,
  in 1681; Caspar Netscher has left a portrait of this lady; by her he had two
  sons, William, 2nd Earl of Rochford (1681-1710), killed at the battle of
  Almenava, and Frederic, 3rd Earl of Rochford (1682-1738), who married Betty,
  daughter of Richard Savage, 4th Earl Rivers; his son was the celebrated 4th
  Earl of Rochford, admiral and diplomat (1717-1781), and the peerage became
  extinct on the death of the 5th Earl in 1830.</p>

  <p>The costume, pose, etc., are those of a young military commander of
  1672-1678, which corresponds with the age the younger Zuylestein would be on
  these dates: viz. twenty-three to twenty-six years of age.</p>

  <h2>NOTES</h2>

  <p class="cp"><i><b>Scotch and English regiments<br>
  in the service of the States General</b></i></p>

  <p>The Scotch regiments played as honourable a part in the liberation of the
  Netherlands in 1672 as a hundred years previously when, before England had an
  established army, both Scotch and English regiments were employed in the war
  of seventy years waged against Spain; the English regiments that served under
  the first three Princes of Orange were disbanded soon after the peace of
  Munster (1648); the three Scotch regiments, the oldest regular troops in
  Europe, known as the Scotch Brigade, were kept in the service of the States
  General; they were the only standing troops belonging to Scotland; under
  William I of Orange, Maurice of Orange and Frederic Henry, their exploits,
  numerous and brilliant, made them famous all over the world. In 1644, the
  colonels of the three regiments were Erskine, Kirkpatrick and Balfour; under
  the oligarchy of John de Witt the Scotch regiments, though left standing,
  were decayed in spirit and prestige; in 1673 the three colonels were Sir
  Alexander Colyear (or Colyer), ancestor of the Earl of Portmore, Graham and
  Mackay; Colyear became Adjutant-General to William III, and is frequently
  mentioned as being in close attendance on the Prince in the <i>Journaal</i>
  of Huygens.</p>

  <p>In 1674, after the Peace of Westminster, when Charles II disbanded many of
  his troops, a number of them took service with the Prince of Orange; at the
  siege of Grave were ten English companies under command of Hugh Mackay; Sir
  Henry Bellasis and Thomas Monk were among the officers&mdash;both created
  colonels by William III.</p>

  <p>In 1674 these English soldiers had become so numerous that the Prince of
  Orange decided to form them into three regiments; a treaty was in progress on
  this subject with Major-General Sir Walter Vane, who was, however, killed at
  the Battle of Seneffe; the three regiments were formed under the command of
  Lord Clare, Lord Tillington and Colonel Disney; these troops took part in the
  siege of Maastricht (1676); the colonels then were Sir John Fenwick
  (replacing Lord Clare), Colonel Astley (replacing Lord Tillington), and
  Colonel Ralph Widdrington (replacing Colonel Disney). Colonel Widdrington and
  his successor in command were both killed at this siege. After William III's
  marriage the command of the British Brigade (a regiment) was given to Thomas
  Butler, Earl of Ossory, eldest son of the Duke of Ormond, and married to a
  daughter of Louis de Nassau, Lord of Beverwaert; this "gallant and
  accomplished nobleman" was a Knight of the Garter, and a Rear-Admiral; a
  definite agreement was made between him and William III. After the new
  alliance between the Dutch and the English, the Prince of Orange contrived to
  retain the six regiments, of which he thought very highly, and which were, in
  a manner, his own creation, in the pay of the States General; they so
  distinguished themselves at the terrible battle of St. Denis that they
  received the thanks of the King of Spain and the States General.</p>

  <p>On the death of Lord Ossory in 1680, the Prince of Orange failed to
  obtain, after a difficult struggle, the command of these regiments for Henry
  Sidney, afterwards Earl of Romney, and one of the most active agents of the
  revolution of 1688. King James II recalled the regiments in 1685 to help
  quell the Monmouth rebellion, and expressed his pleasure at the excellent
  pitch to which the Prince of Orange had brought them, "there cannot, I am
  sure, be better men than they are, and they do truly look like old regiments,
  and one cannot be better pleased with them than I am."</p>

  <p>No sooner were the regiments returned to Holland, however, than a dispute
  arose between His Majesty and the Prince of Orange as to the command of the
  Brigade; James II, with his usual harsh, indelicate tact, wished to insist on
  the appointment of a Roman Catholic; the result was the recall of the
  regiments, with the intention of sending them into French service, or, at
  least, of having them maintained by Louis XIV; the States refused to send the
  regiments back, but no restraint was put on the British soldiers by William
  III; out of 290 officers in the six regiments, only 60 obeyed the summons of
  King James, who sent a royal yacht to bring them to England; three new
  regiments were raised for these officers, and they were taken into French
  pay. The Scotch Brigade sailed for England with the Prince of Orange in 1688,
  under command of General Mackay; they were employed in Scotland
  (Killiecrankie), 1689, and in Ireland, afterwards in Flanders. Mackay was
  killed at Steinkirk. The English and Scots troops took part in all the
  campaigns of William III; at the Peace of Ryswyck (1697) six regiments were
  returned to the service of the States; the Scots Brigade had come upon the
  establishment of their own country in 1688 till this date, though they had
  been sent back to the Netherlands to assist the Dutch Republic. It was only
  the Scots Brigade that William III sent back, the English troops remained on
  the English establishment; in place of these three regiments three other
  Scottish regiments, those of Ferguson, Hamilton and Strathnaver, were sent to
  the Netherlands.</p>

  <p>The eldest regiment was in existence from 1573, the second regiment was
  brought complete to Holland by Lord Buocleuch, 1603, the third was formed
  1628, though additional regiments were raised from time to time; but these
  first three were permanently in service from 1628, at least; they date from
  1588, if not 1572; these troops were pikemen and musketeers, with, in earlier
  times, cavalry (lancers and cuirassiers), artillery and engineers attached;
  there were (1628) ten companies in a regiment, one hundred and fifty to a
  company; in 1678 William III re-established the Brigade on a new basis and
  they formed the finest part of the army he brought to England in 1688; by
  this date one of the regiments had abandoned the pike to become fusiliers;
  they wore a scarlet uniform, with various different-coloured facings (blue,
  white, yellow), by 1690 they were wearing the "casaque" or grenadier
  caps.</p>

  <p>In 1782 the States General decreed that the six regiments, the Scots and
  English Brigades, handed over by William III in 1697, should renounce their
  allegiance to Great Britain; their colours, uniform, Scotch word of' command,
  etc., were to be taken from them, and they were to take an oath as Dutch
  subjects; this was an end of the old Scotch Brigade; they became thus
  absorbed into a foreign army with the exception of fifty-five officers who
  resigned their commissions and returned to Britain.</p>

  <p>In 1793 King George III revived the "Scotch Brigade," which was named 94th
  regiment of the line. There is hardly a distinguished Scotch name which does
  not appear (many several times) in the lists of officers of these regiments,
  which have as brilliant a history as any in Europe, and bore a larger share
  in the terrible warfare of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries than is
  sometimes noticed by historians; they had a most brilliant tradition; it was
  said that they "never lost a stand of colours," and for two hundred years
  there was scarcely a battle or a siege in which the names of these Scottish
  and English soldiers do not appear as having fallen "in the bed of
  honour."</p>

  <p>"The ancient march" which William III gave back to them (1674-1675) was
  that which the Germans serving under Gustavas Adolphus beat to frighten the
  enemy, "the old Scots March," which is said to have been "The Low Lands of
  Holland"; the colours returned at the same time were a crimson cross with the
  Scotch Crown and Thistle and the motto: "Nemo me impune lacessit"; this
  device and motto is used by the Royal Scots Greys.</p>

  <p>An Irish regiment, Clare's Dragoons, was raised by William III, 1675;
  after the Revolution this became English, the 5th of the Line; several famous
  English regiments, the Buffs, the Connaught Rangers, etc., trace their origin
  to the English troops raised or employed in the Netherlands; but the changes
  in the organization, titles, etc., of the regiments of the British Army make
  difficult a succinct account of their history; the English troops which had
  been raised in Holland, 1676, followed William III to England in 1688, became
  the 5th and 6th regiments of Guards; they were called the "Holland" or "King
  William" regiments.</p>

  <i>History</i> and the exhaustive but confused <i>Papers illustrating the
  Scots Brigade</i>, etc., by James Ferguson, Scottish History Society,

  <p class="cp"><i><b>The House of Lorraine</b></i></p>

  <p>This was one of the most illustrious families in Europe, claiming the
  usual descent from Julius Caesar and, more reasonably, from Godfrey de
  Bouillon, King of Jerusalem; though even this was disallowed by heralds;
  these Princes quartered, however, on their arms the famous three
  <i>alerions</i> of Godfrey de Bouillon, and used the Lorraine cross of almost
  mystical significance; though, in 1672, dispossessed of Lorraine, over which
  they had long ruled as sovereign Princes, they retained their full titles and
  had still great weight in Europe; Charles IV (or III by some named) had been
  long forced to play the part of captain-adventurer, and had taken service
  with the Emperor who made considerable endeavours to regain his duchy from
  France; it was he whom Huygens saw supping with the Prince of Orange in 1673;
  he was then sixty-nine years of age; he died in 1675 and was buried in the
  Capuchine Church at Coblentz; the following account of him is given in the
  book from which most of these particulars are taken: <i>Origin of the House
  of Lorraine</i>, by Charles Louis Hugo, Abbot of Estival, published at
  Berlin, 1711, dedicated to Frederick III, King of Prussia, Marquis of
  Brandenburg, Elector of the Holy Empire, etc., and, allowing for some gloss
  of flattery seems a true enough portrait of a great and unfortunate man; it
  also explains the complication of his matrimonial affairs and the ambiguous
  position of his son, the famous Prince de Vaudemont, friend and companion in
  arms of William III. "He was a warlike prince, a great captain, a general
  experienced and nearly infallible in his measures. Redoubtable to his
  enemies, adored by his soldiers, cherished by his people, worthy by his
  heroic virtues of a better fortune&mdash;if fortune were the price of virtue.
  Insatiable of glory, austere to himself, diligent, economical, religious, the
  enemy of luxury, fertile in ingenious resources, of an edifying piety, of a
  tender and complaisant heart, devoted to glory. He married in 1621 Nicole of
  Lorraine, daughter of Duke Henry of Lorraine, who died at Paris in 1675. In
  1637 the Duke entered a second alliance with Beatrice de Cusance, widow of
  Eugene Leopold d'Oiselet, Prince de Cantecroix; this marriage was not
  approved by the Church of Rome. By it he had Charles Henry, Count de
  Vaudemont, Prince Sovereign of Commercy, Governor of the Spanish Low
  Countries and of Milan, who married in 1667 Anne Elizabeth d'Elboeuf of
  Lorraine, and Anne of Lorraine married to François Jules Marie, Prince of
  Lislebonne. Charles IV married a third time Marie Contesse d'Apremont de
  Nanteuil. He had no children by this third wife. He was succeeded by Charles
  V (often called Charles IV), son of the Duke Nicholas François of Lorraine,
  and of Claude of Lorraine, who were married at Vienna in Austria, April 6,
  1643."</p>

  <p>The only son of Charles IV, Charles Henry, was debarred from the rank of
  Duke of Lorraine and Bar, but considered as legitimate; he took another
  famous title of his father's house, that of Vaudemont, and lived on amiable
  terms with the cousin who had dispossessed him; he was a considerable
  general, a valiant soldier, an honourable gentleman, and an attractive
  personality; he left one son, Thomas de Vaudemont, who died unmarried.</p>

  <p>His cousin Charles eclipsed him in fame; this Prince was one of the most
  renowned generals of his age, a man of genius, humanity, piety and charm,
  high-minded, audacious and upright; his exploits being mostly against the
  Turks were not so renowned as they would have been had he fought in Flanders;
  but he was, as a military commander, probably the equal of Conde or
  Turenne.</p>

  <p>This Prince was destined to the Church by his relations, who procured him
  the Abbey of Jovilliers, of Senone, etc., but the death of Prince Ferdinand,
  his eldest brother, caused him to leave the Church and take up his worldly
  rank. Charles, educated at Paris, had wished to marry the Princess Marie
  Jeanne Baptiste Savoye de Nemours. The price of this alliance demanded by the
  French, however, was that the young Prince should renounce his prospective
  Duchy of Lorraine and Bar. This he refused to do, left Paris and returned to
  Vienna, where the Emperor took him under his protection and gave him a
  regiment of Cuirassiers. In 1664 the Prince marched into Hungary against the
  rebels, under the generalship of the Prince Louis Margrave of Baden-Baden and
  the famous Montecuculi, where he distinguished himself at the Battle of St.
  Godard. He came to the Netherlands in 1672 and was wounded in 1674 at the
  bloody battle of Seneff, where he received a severe gash on the head. The
  same year he was made commander of all the Imperial cavalry. The following
  year Duke Charles IV (or III), his uncle, died, and he was proclaimed, at the
  head of the Imperial armies, Duke of Lorraine and Bar. On the death of Prince
  Montecuculi the command of these armies passed to Charles of Lorraine. He
  took Philipsbourg in view of the army of the Maréchal de Luxembourg,
  delivered Rhinefeldt and Offembourg (the first in 1676 and the second in
  1678). After the Peace of Nymwegen he fought for the Emperor in Hungary and
  against the Turks. In 1684 he gained three famous battles&mdash;Viesgard,
  Vaccia and Pest. The following year he gained a victory at Gran, after having
  (1683) shared with John Sobieski, King of Poland, the honours of the glorious
  relief of Vienna, from which Leopold I had fled before the advance of the
  Turks under Kara Mustapha. Charles of Lorraine married, in 1678, Eleanor
  Maria of Austria, sister of the Emperor Leopold, and widow of Michael King of
  Poland. He had, of this marriage, Leopold I of Lorraine (who succeeded to his
  titles), Charles, Bishop of Osnabruck, and Olmartz, Elector of Treves and
  Grand Prior of Castile, born at Vienna 1680.</p>

  <p>His later career was embittered by disputes with other distinguished
  generals, the Prince Louis Margrave of Baden-Baden, and his brother Prince
  Herman of Baden-Baden, Commander of the Imperial Artillery.</p>

  <p>The Duke of Lorraine died in the forty-seventh year of his age, of a
  quinsy, at Vetz, Austria, on April 18, 1690, "having in the course of his
  life beaten the infidels thirty-one times, taken fifty-three fortresses,
  scattered five hundred thousand Turks, and made all the rebels submit to the
  Empire. He was of middle height, with features well-proportioned; his
  forehead high, his eyes bright and intelligent; his nose aquiline, his mouth
  small and vermilion; his temperament robust; his spirits were elevated, his
  judgment profound; he spoke little, and always with justice; frugal, humane
  in all the commerce of life, disinterested, observant of his word, pardoning
  injuries, modest in his victories; a prince worthy to command all the world,
  as he was able to conquer it by his valour.</p>

  <p>"The people of whom he was sovereign had not the pleasure to possess him
  after his death. Leopold, his son, caused his body to be brought from
  Innsbruck to Nancy in April, 1700, and gave him to the sepulchre of his
  fathers in the Church of the Cordeliers, at Nanoy." (<i>Origin of the House
  of Lorraine</i>.)</p>

  <p>A rare pamphlet entitled "Relation of the Funeral Pomp made at Nancy the
  19th April 1700," and published that year, describes the magnificent funeral
  of this prince, and the cortege which wound from Innsbruck to Nancy at the
  expense of his son, Leopold I, who married the daughter of the Duke of
  Orleans, brother of Louis XIV, by his second wife, called Charlotte the
  Princess Palatine, the granddaughter of Elizabeth of Bohemia, daughter of
  Charles Louis, Elector Palatine, and the "Lise Lotte" who was once suggested
  as bride for William III; the elder son of this union, Leopold, became the
  husband of the daughter of the Emperor, Charles VI, son of Leopold I, Maria
  Teresa, and through her the Emperor Leopold II; through these intermarriages
  the House of Lorraine was finally merged into that of the Hapsburgs.</p>

  <p>The Dukedom of Lorraine had already been exchanged for the Grand Dukedom
  of Tuscany which reverted to the Emperor on the death of the last Medici; at
  this date these Princes received the honour of "Royal Highness."</p>

  <p>All the Princes of the House of Lorraine were loyal Catholics; Charles V
  wrote a book of Military "Maximes" where a spirit of sincere piety mitigates
  the severity of the subject.</p>

  <p class="cp">
  <i><b>Prince Raimondo, Comte de Montecuculi,<br>
  Knight of the Golden Fleece, Grand Master of the Artillery<br>
  and Generalissimo of the Imperial Forces</b></i></p>

  <p>This great General, commonly called Raymond, Count Montecuculi, was one of
  the most distinguished generals of the seventeenth century, but his exploits
  taking place mostly on the remote confines of Western civilization, his fame
  has been overshadowed by those soldiers who won victories in the heart of
  Europe; Prince Monteououli rendered immense services to this Western
  civilization by holding back the tide of Eastern invasion which (it is often
  forgotten) swept to the very gates of Vienna; a due measure of fame should be
  awarded to the generals who were the swords and bucklers of Europe in this
  contest, Prince Montecuculi, Charles V, Duke of Lorraine, John Sobieski, King
  of Poland, Max Emmanuel, Elector of Bavaria, and Prince Louis Margrave of
  Baden-Baden.</p>

  <p>Montecuculi was a subject of the Duke of Modena, and was born of an
  illustrious family in the province of that name in 1608; he served his
  apprenticeship to war under two uncles established in Germany, fought for the
  Emperor in Pomerania against Sweden (1659); in 1661 he turned back the
  Turkish hordes invading high Hungary and Transylvania; in 1663 the Grand
  Vizier appeared on the Danube with more than a hundred thousand men, and
  Montecuculi held his own against them with no more than six thousand men; in
  1664 the Turks had overrun Austria and Germany; Montecuculi met, defeated
  them and obliged them to sue for peace in one of the great battles of modern
  history, that of St. Gothard (1664); in this battle Montecuculi was assisted
  by French troops under Coligny. In 1666 Montecuculi was sent to receive the
  bride of the Emperor, Margaret of Austria, daughter of Philip IV of Spain; in
  1670 he conducted to Warsaw the Emperor's sister, the Archduchess Eleanora
  Marie, who married Miohael Wienowski, King of Poland (afterwards she espoused
  Charles V, Duke of Lorraine). He was chosen as Generalissimo of the Imperial
  Forces in 1673 and marched from Egra to Cologne to meet the Prince of Orange;
  after the taking of Bonn he returned to Vienna, but again marched on the
  Rhine in 1675 when Turenne had driven back the German troops; Turenne was
  killed (Saltzbach, 1676) and Montecuculi made himself master of the Rhine and
  overran Alsace; he survived the Peace of Nymwegen (1678) three years, dying
  in 1681 at Lintz; his body was taken to Vienna and buried in the Church of
  the Jesuits; he had married Margaret, Princess of Dietrichstein, and left a
  son and three daughters.</p>

  <p>Prince Montecuculi's great merit was as a tactician; he was not dashing or
  brilliant in action, for both his friends and enemies accused him of
  slowness; he was not nearly audacious or enterprising enough for William III,
  who wanted him to follow up the taking of Bonn by an offensive against
  Turenne which would probably have been successful, but Montecuculi was then
  old, infirm and cautious; he was an expert in that complicated military
  science that turned warfare into an elaborate game of chess, and in this
  skill had no equal; he left <i>Mémoires</i>, written after the peace with the
  Porte in 1664, consisting of dissertations on military matters and some
  formal account of his late wars; a French edition (translated from the
  Italian) appeared in 1712.</p>

  <p>A collection of Montecuculi's letters and those of his family, together
  with a very interesting account of his march from Egra in 1673, has been
  published in <i>Achivio Storico Italiano</i>, Appendice, Tomo V, Firenze,
  1847, under <i>Appunti per servire alla vita del Principe Raimondo
  Montecuculi</i>.</p>

  <p>The portraits (prints) of this General taken in middle life show him as of
  more a Teutonic than Italian type, florid, robust, with long fair hair; in
  the Kaiser Frederick Museum, Berlin, is a magnifioent bust of Montecuculi in
  his old age, wearing a huge peruke.</p>

  <p>His arms quartered four imperial eagles surrounded by the collar of the
  Golden Fleece and surmounted by a Prince's crown (he was created a Prince of
  the Holy Roman Empire, 1674).</p>

  <p class="cp"><i><b>The Murder of the De Witts</b></i></p>

  <p>It is not proposed here to enter into any of the controversy this terrible
  event aroused, but as there are still some writers careless or malicious
  enough to repeat old slanders it is as well to remind the reader that the
  question of anyone's complicity in what was, undoubtedly, a mob outrage, was
  settled after exhaustive investigations by the Dutch historian, Robert Fruin,
  whose patient work cleared away so many legends from his country's history
  (Fruin, <i>Verspriede Geschriften</i>, Vol. IV, page 373. See also J. P. Blok,
  <i>Geschedenis van het Netherlandsche Volk</i>, Vol. V, page 292); and there
  can be no possible doubt that William III, Zuylestein, and their followers
  and servants were completely innocent of the crime with which they have been
  so frequently charged, which they had no object in perpetrating, which
  brought them no advantage, and which was entirely contrary to the natures of
  either the Prince or his uncle. In this connection the unreliability of Jean
  Herault, called Gourville, the lively passages from whose <i>Mémoires</i> are
  so often quoted, may be emphasized; he admired but did not understand William
  III, and his wonderful conversations with that Prince are so improbable as to
  deserve to be rejected <i>in toto</i>; many memoir-writers cannot resist the
  temptation to embellish their recollections and to inflate their importance
  by overstating their intimacy with great men; William III was again a victim
  of another such writer&mdash;Gilbert Burnet; compare the good Bishop's
  incredible tale of his "reconciliation" of William and his wife, accepted by
  Lord Macaulay, and his assertion of his vast intimacy with William III, with
  Halifax's remark, noted in the Spencer House conversations, "that he never
  heard him [the King] speak a good word of Burnet." See also the considerable
  alterations made in his text revealed by Miss Foxcroft's Supplement to
  Burnet; yet it is on these engaging anecdotes given by self-interested
  "memoir"-writers that so much "history" is built, and so many fine characters
  smirched; the alteration, clumsy and almost senseless, in the passage in
  Burnet, referring to (probably) Elizabeth Villiers, has caused numbers of
  spiteful or careless writers to repeat fantastic slanders against the memory
  of William III.</p>

  <p class="cp"><i><b>Battle of Solebay and the Texel (or Southwold)</b></i></p>

  <p>A complete description of the Battle of Solebay, May 28th/June 7th, 1672,
  and the Battle of the Texel, August 2'14 1673 (sometimes called the Battle of
  Kykduin), has been printed by the Navy Records Society, published 1908; it is
  written by J. S. Corbett, to accompany the drawings of these battles made on
  the spot (by William Van der Velde the elder?), in the possession of the Earl
  of Dartmouth; the two other engagements in May&mdash;June, 1673, were also of
  great naval importance; these battles lie, however, outside the scope of this
  work</p>
