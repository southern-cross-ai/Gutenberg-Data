Madeleine</b>
</h2>

<p>"We&nbsp;have no interests in common, Drew; why should we
pretend we want to go to the same places?"</p>

<p>"I wonder if married people ever have interests in common? I
wonder if any two people have interests in common&mdash;or if it's
marriage that makes their interests diverge?"</p>

<p>"There you go, with your inane wondering! I often wonder what
you'll find to wonder about after you've wondered about
everything!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Andrew Barham shrugged her petulant shoulders and studied
her nose in a tiny mirror as she applied a discretionary amount of
powder.</p>

<p>"Don't overdo that," and Barham smiled.</p>

<p>He meant it rather by way of jest, but Mrs. Selden took it
up.</p>

<p>Now, Mrs. Selden was his mother-in-law, and she was always
taking things up. In fact, it was her taking up tendency that was
partly responsible for the little rift in the Barhams' lute.</p>

<p>And there was a rift. Not a very big one, nor did it seem to
widen much with the years. But this was due to Barham's continual
and systematic endeavors that it shouldn't.</p>

<p>Madeleine was trying, at times, but she was his wife. She broke
loose occasionally into fearful exhibitions of temper, but this was
because she had discovered when a small child that they brought her
advantages which she could not get otherwise. And, she was his
wife.</p>

<p>So, Barham being of a mild and equable disposition himself,
overlooked her fits of temper, put down her tryingness to the fact
that they didn't see things from the same view point, and they got
along.</p>

<p>Had it not been for Mrs. Selden they would have got along much
better, but she had an annoying way of sticking her finger in the
little rift and tearing it bigger. This, Barham had to overlook
also&mdash;for, she was his wife's mother.</p>

<p>Apart from Barham's almost exaggerated chivalry toward women in
general, he had a fine sense of honor and duty toward his own
people, and this, as you can readily see, made his life a bit
difficult here and there.</p>

<p>So, when he lightly advised his wife not to overdo her powdering
performance, Mrs. Selden said sharply:</p>

<p>"How you do rag at the poor child, Andrew. As if a bit of
innocent powder did any harm!"</p>

<p>The trio were just finishing dinner, and Mrs. Selden laid down
her coffee spoon with a faint click, as if to express her utter
despair at the fearful inhumanity of man.</p>

<p>She was an extremely handsome woman, just this side of sixty,
but trying to look, and fairly well succeeding, about fifty. Her
white hair was dressed in large soft waves, and her big dark eyes
were still bright and expressive. Her complexion was good and, save
for an oversharpness of features, she would have been beautiful.
But beauty, in her case, was sacrificed to aristocracy, and the
somewhat hawklike nose, and high cheek bones gave an effect of high
birth and good breeding.</p>

<p>These Marcia Selden had, but she had also traits of domination
and determination and amazing powers of irritation.</p>

<p>Moreover, she always assumed herself in the right, and took on
an injured expression if any one hinted otherwise.</p>

<p>Mother and daughter didn't get on any too well, but they always
found common cause in a grievance against Barham.</p>

<p>A little more harshness of character would have stood the man in
good stead&mdash;but then, he wouldn't have been Andrew Barham.</p>

<p>"Gentle, lovable&mdash;somewhat inconsequent old Drew," as his
friends called him, would do almost anything to avoid an
unpleasantness; and his doing of almost anything made the
opportunities for unpleasantnesses even more frequent.</p>

<p>Quite often he tried the soft answer, guaranteed to turn away
wrath; sometimes he changed the subject; and sometimes he merely
was silent.</p>

<p>This time he tried the last method, and Mrs. Selden took that
up.</p>

<p>"Of course you have nothing to say! There is no answer, no
excuse for a gratuitous rebuff. Come now&mdash;why do you mind
Madeleine's powdering her nose?"</p>

<p>"I daresay I'm a bit old-fashioned, mother, but I have a
distaste for vanity-cases used at table. Oh, I know it's
done&mdash;and all that&mdash;but as Madeleine is doubtless at once
going to her boudoir, it would seem unnecessary&mdash;oh, pshaw, I
only said it in a joke, anyway."</p>

<p>"A very poor joke, in my estimation," and Mrs. Selden pursed her
thin lips in utter and entire disapproval.</p>

<p>So Barham tried changing the subject.</p>

<p>"Whither away to-night, Madeleine? Or staying at home?"</p>

<p>He glanced at her elaborate house gown, thinking what a pretty
woman his wife was. Her dark, bright eyes, her soft dusky hair, and
her charming coloring made her almost a beauty. But, like her
mother, her attractiveness was lessened by an expression of
perversity, a hint of readiness to take offense.</p>

<p>"No; I'm not staying at home&mdash;but what does it matter to
you where I'm going? As I said, we have no interests in
common&mdash;and your inquiries are mere politeness!"</p>

<p>"At least, let us keep politeness, Madeleine."</p>

<p>Barham's voice was a bit wistful, and Madeleine might have
responded to that note in it, but Mrs. Selden took it up.</p>

<p>"Are you implying that Madeleine is lacking in politeness? Have
a care, Andrew! I won't stand everything!"</p>

<p>Now Andrew Barham was not a weak-spirited man, though it might
seem so. But his innate courtesy to women and his dread of a scene
kept him from any show of righteous indignation at this speech.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Madeleine rose from the table, preventing any
further tilting.</p>

<p>"No," she said, suddenly smiling prettily, "I won't tell you
where I'm going&mdash;yes, I will, I'm going to Mrs. Gardner's.
Rest assured it's a place you wouldn't enjoy, so I shan't invite
you to go along. Where are you going? To the Club?"</p>

<p>"Yes; maybe to a theater afterward&mdash;maybe not."</p>

<p>He looked a bit gloomy as he stood in the hall, lighting a
cigarette, and nodding to the man to bring his hat.</p>

<p>"You're extremely good-looking, Drew&mdash;but I get so tired of
looking at you," his wife said, with a bored little smile. "Perhaps
when I see you next, you'll look gayer," and with a mere mockery of
throwing a kiss to him, she ran off upstairs to her own rooms.</p>

<p>Mrs. Selden never spent her evenings with "the children." She
read the papers and then, dawdling over her rather extensive
preparations, she went early to bed.</p>

<p>Leaving the house, Barham walked to his favorite Club, and as he
went he mused on the strange fate that had given him Madeleine for
a wife.</p>

<p>"No interests in common," he quoted to himself. "Why haven't we?
If I had her to myself&mdash;without mother Selden around&mdash;I
might persuade her to take up golf or some outdoor thing that we
could do together. But she'd never give up her Bridge. And I can't
learn the confounded game! Strange, too; I've a good head for lots
of things&mdash;yet there are nincompoops like Travers and Jim Bell
who can put up a wonderful game of Bridge, though they couldn't
cope with the tiniest one of my problems.</p>

<p>"If I had a wife, now, like&mdash;" but his own sense of right
and wrong forbade him to go further.</p>

<p>After all, Madeleine was his wife&mdash;and that was all there
was about that. He must try, he decided, to make himself more
desirable in her eyes. More attractive, more useful&mdash; Well,
she had said, that though he was
good-looking&mdash;that&nbsp;<i>was</i>&nbsp;a nasty fling! As to
being useful&mdash;he paid her bills and was always a gallant
attendant when she wanted him.</p>

<p>But she seldom wanted him. Usually she preferred to go about
with her own cronies, who liked him as little as he liked them.</p>

<p>Not that they were really objectionable. But they were a gay and
frivolous lot, and even with the best intentions he couldn't speak
their lingo.</p>

<p>A man of the world, a clubman, a man about town&mdash;all these
he was. A good fellow, a fine pal&mdash;all his chums would tell
you that&mdash;yet the sort of Smart Set, semi-fast people his wife
enjoyed, were as utter strangers to him.</p>

<p>He had tried&mdash;tried to talk their small talk, laugh at
their small jests, fathom their small souls&mdash;but, though with
no undue sense of his own importance he couldn't make good from
their point of view.</p>

<p>He set it all down to his own shortcomings, but the fact
remained. And so as this was part of the rift, the Barhams had come
to spend their evenings, as a rule, away from each other.</p>

<p>However, he had become pretty well used to it, and as he reached
his Club he was in a more cheerful frame of mind. He went in with a
smile, ran across good old Nick Nelson, and stopped in the smoking
room for a chat with him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Madeleine, in her room, was doing some thinking. It
was too early to dress and she had some other things to think out
first, anyway.</p>

<p>At last she rose and went down the hall to her mother's
rooms.</p>

<p>"Mother," she said, patting the fine white hair, "I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know what that means," and Mrs. Selden drew her head away
from her daughter's caressing hand. "Now, Madeleine, I haven't a
cent for you. It's outrageous, the way you go on. You know, very
well, if Andrew had the least idea how you are managing, he
would&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, what would he do? He hasn't the power to do
anything&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't be too sure. You know Andrew&mdash;but I know the world
better than you do, I know men better than you do&mdash;and you
needn't think that because Andrew never has broken loose, he never
will!"</p>

<p>"Broken loose&mdash;how?"</p>

<p>"Reprimand you&mdash;disgrace you&mdash;punish you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Disgrace! Punish! Mother, what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Oh, hush up, child&mdash;don't think I don't know things!
Andrew and I both spoil you&mdash;we're both too lenient with
you&mdash;but&mdash;we both know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pooh! What do you know? Only that I lose a lot at Bridge! Well,
I can't help it, if I have bad luck. I'm a first-class
player&mdash;any one will tell you that. But I'm having a run of
ill luck. Everybody has 'em, and they have to be followed by a
streak of good luck. Everybody knows that. And when the good luck
comes I'll pay back all I've borrowed from you or anybody
else&mdash;and more, too. Now, come, Mother, be a duck and let me
have at least a few hundreds."</p>

<p>"Madeleine, I can't."</p>

<p>"That means you won't."</p>

<p>"Take it either way you like&mdash;but you won't get any."</p>

<p>"Then I'll tell you what I think of you! I think you're a horrid
old woman who refuses her own child&mdash;her only child, a few
paltry dollars! You care nothing at all for my pleasure! You've
feathered your own nest&mdash;or, rather I feathered it for you, by
my marriage with a rich man! You have everything you
want&mdash;ease, comfort, luxury&mdash;while I, a rich man's wife,
haven't a cent to call my own!"</p>

<p>"Why haven't you? Because you've thrown it away gambling. Your
husband gives you an enormous allowance&mdash;he even gives you
extra money when you ask for it&mdash;and now, that you've reached
the limit of his endurance and generosity, you come to me, to ask
for the tiny sum I've saved&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, have you, Mother? Have you saved a sum&mdash;do lend it to
me, dearie? I'm sure I'll win to-night&mdash;and, besides, I'll
tell you a secret&mdash;maybe&mdash;just maybe, you know, soon I
won't have any trouble to get all the money I want&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Heavens, Madeleine, what do you mean by such talk? What are you
going to do?"</p>

<p>"Nothing to make you look like that! Only&mdash;just
maybe&mdash;Andrew will give me a lot of money."</p>

<p>"You're going to give up gambling? Is that it? Going to be more
the sort of a wife he wants?"</p>

<p>"Maybe&mdash;" the pretty face wore a tantalizing
smile&mdash;"anyway&mdash;I've a plan&mdash;a perfectly good, right
plan. Oh, Mother, it's&mdash;but don't ask me, it's a
secret&mdash;as yet."</p>

<p>"Where are you going to-night?"</p>

<p>"To Emmy Gardner's. But I'm going somewhere else first, and I'm
in a hurry to get dressed. So, come across, old dear&mdash;that's a
love!"</p>

<p>"Haven't got it," and Mrs. Selden returned to her newspaper,
with a cold smile at her daughter.</p>

<p>"Mother! don't throw me like that! I tell you
I&nbsp;<i>must</i>&nbsp;have it. I can't play to-night unless I pay
a debt of last night. I haven't a cent myself&mdash;oh, how can you
be so heartless!"</p>

<p>"Madeleine, behave yourself. I tell you I haven't more than ten
or fifteen dollars in the house."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it"&mdash;and Madeleine began to rummage in her
mother's dresser drawers.</p>

<p>"Stop that!" cried Mrs. Selden. "If you're so sure of winning
to-night, they'll take your I.O.U. for last night's debts."</p>

<p>"That shows how little you know about it," and Madeleine sneered
her scorn. "Mother, if you don't give me some money, you'll be
sorry!"</p>

<p>"I'll be sorrier if I do. Good-night."</p>

<p>"I hate you!" and Madeleine ground her teeth in passion. "I hate
you for a cruel, unnatural parent! I've a notion to turn you out of
this house&mdash;you horrid old thing! You&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, do hush. You act as you used to act when you were a
child."</p>

<p>"And you treat me as cruelly as you did then! If you'd brought
me up differently&mdash;-I might have been a better woman. Oh, you
don't know yet how bad I can be&mdash;and I will, too&mdash;if you
don't help me out this time!"</p>

<p>"Go to your room, and get over your tantrum. You'll get no money
from me to-night."</p>

<p>Mrs. Selden rose, and practically pushed her daughter through
the doorway to the hall.</p>

<p>Madeleine went&mdash;seeing there was no hope of achieving her
desire, but she went off muttering vengeance, and with a face white
with passion.</p>

<p>In her boudoir again, she called her maid.</p>

<p>"Claudine," she said, "you must lend me some money&mdash;just
for this evening. Come now&mdash;there's a dear."</p>

<p>"Willingly, Madame&mdash;but, alas, I have none."</p>

<p>"That's not true&mdash;you were paid only yesterday."</p>

<p>"But I sent it away&mdash;to my poor sister&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Claudine, you're lying. Now&mdash;see here&mdash;if you don't
let me have some money&mdash;I'll tell your friend Carl
about&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, Madame&mdash;no, I beg of you&mdash;"</p>

<p>The French maid turned pale with apprehension, and looked
beseechingly at her determined mistress.</p>

<p>"Yes, I will&mdash;I surely will! Now, you know you have
some&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Only fifty dollars, Madame&mdash;as God is my witness, that's
all I have."</p>

<p>"Pah! that would do me no good at all! Keep your
fifty&mdash;but, Claudine, get me Mrs. Sayre on the telephone. And
after you get her&mdash;leave the room."</p>

<p>"Yes, Madame."</p>

<p>Madeleine stretched out on her&nbsp;<i>chaise longue</i>, smiled
a little as she waited.</p>

<p>She looked like some sleek well fed cat, about to seize on its
unsuspecting prey.</p>

<p>Perhaps students of such things would have said her gambling
instinct was an inheritance from some reckless, swashbuckling
ancestor.</p>

<p>Others would hold, and more likely they were right, it was the
result of the heedless, rushing pace set by the crowd with whom she
lived and moved and danced and had her being.</p>

<p>Yet few of that crowd, if any, played so desperately, so
feverishly or so continuously as Madeleine.</p>

<p>And none lost so much. Although really a fine player, she seemed
one of those who have persistent bad luck, and if she won, she was
quite likely to lose all her winnings on one last high-stake game
before she stopped.</p>

<p>She loved the excitement of it, the hazard of it, the
uncertainty.</p>

<p>And she had the optimism of the true gambler, who always thinks
his luck just about to turn to better and to best, quite undaunted
by the fact that it never does.</p>

<p>She reconnoitered. She was in desperate straits. If she didn't
pay up last night's debts to-night, before beginning to play, her
creditors, two unprincipled women, had threatened to tell her
husband of the situation.</p>

<p>Andrew knew she played Bridge&mdash;frequently&mdash;almost
incessantly&mdash;but he had no idea of the height of her stakes,
or the terrific amounts she lost.</p>

<p>Always before, her mother had helped her out. Always before, she
had won enough to tide over, at least. Always before&mdash;she had
managed by hook or by crook to keep above water.</p>

<p>But to-night she was desperate. Something must be done&mdash;and
done quickly.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Sayre on the wire," Claudine announced, and as Madeleine
took up the receiver, the maid left the room.</p>

<p>"Hello, Rosamond," Madeleine said, "come over a few moments,
can't you?"</p>

<p>"Why, hello, Maddy&mdash;what in the world for?"</p>

<p>"I just want to see you. Seems 's if I can't get along another
minute without seeing you!"</p>

<p>The voice at the other end of the wire gave a short, quick sound
of laughter, but there was an uneasy note in it&mdash;almost a note
of alarm.</p>

<p>"Why, my dear old thing&mdash;I can't come now&mdash;I'm
dressing. Aren't you going to Emmy's to-night?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but not till about eleven."</p>

<p>"I know&mdash;but I've an errand first."</p>

<p>"So've I. Look here, Rosamond, you'd better come over here. Slip
into a little street frock and run over for a minute. You can walk
it in no time&mdash;Harrison won't know you're out of the
house."</p>

<p>"But why? Why must I do that?" The voice was petulant now, and
Madeleine's became more commanding.</p>

<p>"Because I say so. Come along, now!"</p>

<p>She hung up the receiver with a snap, and summoned Claudine
again.</p>

<p>"Dress me quickly," she commanded, "all but my gown. Do my hair
small and plain. Yes&mdash;flesh-colored stockings."</p>

<p>The apt maid understood and with Madeleine's approval did the
dark, soft hair into a compact mass that was becoming but not
elaborate.</p>

<p>By the time the negligée was thrown over the silken
undergarments there came a light tap at the door.</p>

<p>"That will be Mrs. Sayre," Madeleine said; "let her in,
Claudine, and disappear."</p>

<p>"Well, sweetie, what's up?" and Rosamond Sayre dropped into an
easy chair and lighted a cigarette.</p>

<p>"Just had to see you," returned Madeleine, falling back on
the&nbsp;<i>chaise longue</i>. "How's your husband?"</p>

<p>"Harrison? Oh, he's all right."</p>

<p>"Funny little man&mdash;isn't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;why?" Mrs. Sayre seemed in no wise offended.</p>

<p>"But fond of you?"</p>

<p>"As whose husband isn't&mdash;if the wife wants him to be?"</p>

<p>"And proud of you?"</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't he be?"</p>

<p>Rosamond Sayre looked at herself in a mirror.</p>

<p>"He'd be blind if he didn't see reason to be proud of me," she
said, airily, flicking her cigarette ashes on the rug.</p>

<p>She gave an impression of absolute self-satisfaction. Her beryl
eyes flashed with vanity, her great masses of gold-brown hair
clustered over her ears and framed a piquant, bewitching face. Her
dashing little figure and vivacious gestures betokened
self-reliance, as well as self approval.</p>

<p>"Come on, now, Maddy&mdash;out with it," she said; "I must run,
in ten minutes, at most. Going to scold me, kid me&mdash;or borrow
money of me?" She eyed her friend rather sharply.</p>

<p>"Good guesser!" Madeleine cried. "The third time conquers. I'm
going to borrow money of you."</p>

<p>"Broke&mdash;haven't a cent!" and the beryl eyes showed darker
glints in them.</p>

<p>"Pooh, don't come that over me. Harrison will give you a
thousand in a minute&mdash;if you ask him prettily."</p>

<p>"But I wouldn't ask him&mdash;for you." Rosamond smoked calmly
on.</p>

<p>"Oh, do now&mdash;Rosy, listen."</p>

<p>And then Madeleine talked and Rosamond, too, low and earnestly,
and very steadily, for several minutes.</p>

<p>And Rosamond Sayre said, "All right&mdash;I'll bring you a
thousand to-night&mdash;at Emmy Gardner's. Be there by eleven?"</p>

<p>"I think so; or a few moments later."</p>

<h2><b><a name="Chapter_2" id="Chapter_2">Chapter 2</a><br>
The Artists</b>
</h2>

<p>The&nbsp;pretentiousness of a studio, especially a Washington
Square studio, is quite often in inverse proportion to the merit of
the pictures it gives up.</p>

<p>But Tommy Locke's studio defeated this description by being a
golden mean as to both propositions.</p>

<p>Indeed, Henry Post, the artist's cynical friend, said that
Locke's draperies and his canvases showed a wonderfully similar
lack of distinction.</p>

<p>And Kate Vallon had quickly added, "Let's call them his
appointments and disappointments."</p>

<p>But Tommy Locke had only smiled comfortably and had gone on
painting his interminable green and blue landscapes in which, if
anybody cared for a certain vague misty charm&mdash;they did not
find it entirely lacking.</p>

<p>And even if he had no high-backed, gilt-framed Italian
arm-chairs and no armor or ragged priests' robes, he often had
good-looking bowls of even better looking flowers and he served
first-rate tea, and somehow the neighbors loved to drift in and out
of his nondescript rooms.</p>

<p>His ways were ways of pleasantness and all his paths were peace,
yet though his chums were usually tolerant and broad-minded
thinkers, there was little real Bohemianism in evidence, that is,
the Bohemianism of what is known as The Village.</p>

<p>His few worthwhile bits of old furniture stood upon worthwhile
old rugs and his specimens of artistic junk were few and far
between.</p>

<p>Yet, strangely enough, Tommy Locke himself affected the manner
of the comic paper artist&mdash;at least, to a degree.</p>

<p>He wore his black hair a bit longer than other men, he wore his
big round glasses with very heavy tortoise-shell frames, and he
wore his collar soft and loose, with a flowing Windsor tie, usually
black.</p>

<p>He was chaffed a bit now and then as to his inconsistencies, but
it was generally admitted futile to try to get a rise out of old
Tommy.</p>

<p>In fact he calmly stated that his get-up was the only real claim
he had to being one of the noble army of artists, and Henry Post
had glanced at the misty landscapes and murmured, "Some of your
titles show latent talent, I think."</p>

<p>"It's so nice to be understood!" Locke had exclaimed. "Yes, I'll
say my 'Monotony in Sagebrush' is both&nbsp;meanful&nbsp;and
catching."</p>

<p>"If that's all you want you may well have called it 'The
Mumps,'" Kate Vallon had reported.</p>

<p>These three and another, one Pearl Jane Cutler, formed a sort of
chummy quartette, and, though they chummed but seldom, they did
most of it in Tommy's non-committal studio.</p>

<p>"If you'd have a splash of color over that blank looking
window," Kate would suggest, and Tommy would wave away the
suggestion without a word.</p>

<p>Then would Pearl Jane, who was remarkably suggestive of Little
Annie in&nbsp;<i>Enoch Arden</i>, say, plaintively, "I like it
all&mdash;just as it is," and Tommy's beaming smile would be for
her.</p>

<p>They had all finished laughing at her baptismal
absurdity&mdash;she had been named for the two neighbors on either
side of her mother's house&mdash;and without a nickname, they
accepted her as Pearl Jane. It was as yet a question what she would
sign her masterpieces of art, as she hadn't, strictly speaking,
produced them yet.</p>

<p>She hadn't been in the city very long, but Washington Square
claimed her for its own. She loved it&mdash;all four
sides&mdash;and many of its byways. She dabbled away, with a brush
that was, so far, incompetent and irrelevant, but she cheerfully
insisted that she was finding herself, and that some day she would
paint pictures like Tommy's.</p>

<p>"Heaven forfend!" Post would cry out. "If you must copy, choose
the billboard school, or the newspaper cartoon group, but don't
take aim for Tommy's greenery dingles and blue glades."</p>

<p>"Beautiful title!" Tommy mused; "'The Blue Glades of
Glengowrie'&mdash;I'll do that next."</p>

<p>"And that reminds me," Kate said, she was always being
inscrutably reminded, "our infant here, our Pearl Jane, has never
been to a masquerade! A real one, I mean. She doesn't count the Ivy
Club Sociables in her Main Street home. Will you have one for her,
Tommy? We'll all help."</p>

<p>"Better yet, I'll paint one for her," Locke said; "then she can
see how one really looks."</p>

<p>"No, she can't," Post declared. "You see, in your pictures, so
much more is meant than meets the eye&mdash;and Pearl Jane wants
her eyes met."</p>

<p>"All right, then," and Locke thought a minute. "Not a very big
one, you said, didn't you? And, no one asked but our own crowd, you
insisted on, didn't you? And you stipulated it would be small and
early&mdash;am I not right? And if I am not mistaken, you said
there's no hurry about it."</p>

<p>But he was set right on all these points, and the masquerade
party for Pearl Jane was arranged in exactly the fashion Kate
Vallon and Henry Post deemed fitting and proper.</p>

<p>However, their ideas were much in line with Locke's own, and so
they made it only a few hours later and a few people larger than he
consented to.</p>

<p>Pearl Jane was in ecstasies, and when the night came, and she
was togged out in her Dutch Peasant costume, her already bobbed
fair hair flying from under her stiff lace cap, she couldn't wait
for the hour and ran round to Tommy's early.</p>

<p>She found him, garbed in a monk's robe and cowl, standing before
an easel, gazing at one of his own pictures.</p>

<p>"Do you really like it, Pearl Jane?" he said, almost wistfully,
as she came up and stood at his side in silence.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do. They can guy you all they like&mdash;there's
something in your work&mdash;something of Manet&mdash;I mean
Monet&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Eeny, meeny, miney, mo!" he laughed, and turned to look at her.
"Why, bless my soul, madam, you've suddenly grown up!"</p>

<p>"No, that's 'cause this frock is longer than I usually wear. Do
you like it?"</p>

<p>"Do blue and yellow make green? Yes, I like it. You're a
picture!"</p>

<p>"What's the title?" asked another voice, and Kate and Post
appeared.</p>

<p>"I think it might be called 'The Puritan's Carouse,' Locke said,
wresting his glance from the pretty Dutch girl. "Hello, Kate,
you're quite all right as a Contadina&mdash;Henry, not quite so
good as a Spanish Don."</p>

<p>"Ah, I'm not a Spanish Don&mdash;your mistake. I'm a Portuguese
Man o' War."</p>

<p>"You look more like an Oscar Wilde."</p>

<p>"Take that back! Call me anything but like that overrated,
underbred gyastyockus!"</p>

<p>"I thought he was a great poet," Pearl Jane said, wonderingly.
"I never read any of his&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't!" Post said, "I forbid it. There's enough for you, yet
unread. Pearl Jane, dear, without touching that Purple
Jellyfish!"</p>

<p>"Some of his poems are fine," Kate began, but Locke interrupted
her:</p>

<p>"Only one&mdash;'The Ballad of Reading Gaol' is a great poem,
but nothing else of his is worthy of consideration."</p>

<p>Kate Vallon began to quote:</p>

<p class="note">And all men kill the thing they love,<br>
By all let this be heard,<br>
Some do it with a bitter look,<br>
Some with a flattering word.<br>
The coward does it with a kiss,<br>
The brave man with a sword.</p>

<p>"Oh, I hate it!" Pearl Jane shuddered. "If it's like that, I
don't want to read it!"</p>

<p>"No, you don't," Locke agreed; "besides, he's out of date now.
You stick to your John Masefield and Carl Sandburg."</p>

<p>"I don't know them very well," the girl acknowledged, "they're
rather hard, I think."</p>

<p>Now Pearl Jane Cutler was by no means a child or an ignoramus.
But she had been simply brought up in a small town, and though
fairly well grounded in the rudiments of Life and Literature, she
had still quite a bit to learn, and was swallowing it in
chunks&mdash;anaconda like. She was twenty-two, and carried a
little more flesh on her young bones than the average all-city girl
did. Kate Vallon, half a dozen years older, was keeping an eye on
her, and she thought maybe, perhaps, possibly, after a thousand
years of study. Pearl Jane might learn to paint something noisier
than clay pots and onions.</p>

<p>Chinese Charley appeared in the doorway.</p>

<p>"They arrive," he said, a little laconically.</p>

<p>"Show them up," Tommy ordered, as succinctly, and then the
quartette hurried on their masks and the revel began.</p>

<p>Locke was a little surprised at the stream of people that flowed
in. He was not inhospitable, and there was room enough, but he
thought Post might have told him what he was up to. He said as much
to Henry Post, who responded:</p>

<p>"I didn't do it, Tommy, honest, I didn't. But several whom I did
invite, just casually said they might bring friends. I couldn't say
them nay&mdash;now could I?"</p>

<p>"Rather not," said Locke, and turned to greet some
new-comers.</p>

<p>But, in his mask, and his concealing robe and cowl, almost no
one knew him, and so he had no duties as host. This suited him well
enough, and he sauntered about, looking at the hackneyed costumes,
recognizing some figure here and there, or mistakenly thinking he
did.</p>

<p>The studio looked festive to-night, for Kate and Henry had
insisted on a few decorations and had chosen Chinese lanterns and
artificial cherry blossoms. These delighted the soul of Charley,
Locke's house-boy, and he gazed up at them, now and then,
beatifically picturesque.</p>

<p>He was devoted to Locke, though so quiet of manner and scant of
speech that there were no protestations, but he showed his
affection in immaculate housekeeping and meticulous obedience to
orders.</p>

<p>The place was not large; only the second floor entire, and a
room or two on the first floor. Supper would be served downstairs,
so the big studio and one or two smaller rooms could be used for
dancing. This left a small room for a smoking den, and Locke's own
bedroom for a ladies' dressing room.</p>

<p>A small orchestra arrived and soon proved that it could make
jazz music out of all proportion to its size.</p>

<p>Locke asked a Carmen to dance with him, thinking he knew her,
but found he was again mistaken.</p>

<p>"Strange how merely a mask can disguise one so thoroughly," he
said; "I'd think the face only a small part of a personality."</p>

<p>"Then it proves, practically, that the face is the whole
individual," Carmen returned, turning her mask a trifle until he
saw a lovely cheek and curving lips. "But as you've never seen me
before, you couldn't be expected to know me."</p>

<p>"I didn't expect to, I merely thought you were someone
else."</p>

<p>"I know almost no one here," Carmen said; "of course it makes no
difference while we're masked, but at supper time I shall know
nobody."</p>

<p>"That's all right, I'll introduce you about, and you'll have
made dozens of friends among your partners by that
time.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>"Who are you, Sir Monk, tell me that, at any rate."</p>

<p>"My name would mean nothing to you&mdash;it's entirely
uncelebrated."</p>

<p>"Tell me all the same"&mdash;the pretty voice was
peremptory.</p>

<p>"Smith," he replied, "John Smith."</p>

<p>"And you call that name uncelebrated? One of the best known in
the country. Fie, fie, Mr. Smith&mdash;just for that I shall call
you John."</p>

<p>"And I may call you?"</p>

<p>"Mary&mdash;Mary Smith."</p>

<p>"Miss Smith, then. I never begin to call the ladies by their
first names until midnight&mdash;at least."</p>

<p>"Tell me something&mdash;who is that woman in the gorgeous
Oriental costume?"</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Over toward the hall door. See?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I see. I haven't the faintest idea who she is. But as
I say, they're all disguised from me. Besides, with this silly
cowl, I can only see straight ahead! I might as well be a horse in
blinders!"</p>

<p>"Can't you take it off?"</p>

<p>"And spoil my real Cistercian rig! Never! Besides, I haven't my
tonsure on straight."</p>

<p>"Do you know the host?" Carmen asked, suddenly.</p>

<p>"Do you mean, do I know him? or, do I know which one he is?"</p>

<p>"Both."</p>

<p>"Yes, I am acquainted with him," Locke said, truthfully, and
mendaciously added, "but I don't know which one he is. That Spanish
Don, maybe. Don't you know Locke at all?"</p>

<p>"No, but I've heard a lot of him."</p>

<p>"Good, bad or rotten?"</p>

<p>"Not the last&mdash;they all say he's a trump. But queer."</p>

<p>"Queer, how?"</p>

<p>"Sort of a vagabond&mdash;goes off on jaunts by
himself&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Painting?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so. Is his work any good?"</p>

<p>"Middling. Not very little and not very big. But I think he's
happy in it."</p>

<p>"I'm only happy when I'm dancing."</p>

<p>"My heavens, I can't dance all night!"</p>

<p>"There are others! That's what I was hinting!"</p>

<p>"How prettily rude you are! That's the beauty of a
masquerade&mdash;one can say anything."</p>

<p>"Can one? Then listen! I know you! I know who you are!"</p>

<p>"Do you?" said Locke. "Well, I'm not so overwhelmed at that! I
know who you are!"</p>

<p>"Ah, but I'm telling the truth&mdash;and you're fibbing!"</p>

<p>And with a merry trill of laughter, Carmen disengaged herself
from his clasping arm and ran away.</p>

<p>"Foolish chit!" Locke thought, and wandered about, looking for
Pearl Jane.</p>

<p>The Dutch Girl was dancing with a Sailor Boy, and Locke stood to
one side and watched them.</p>

<p>"Funny thing about Pearl Jane," he thought; "she's
womanly&mdash;and all that&mdash;and yet she's little more than a
child. Lucky she has Kate beside her&mdash;Kate's a trump. But
Kate's party here to-night is rubbish! I am bored already. However,
the kiddy wanted her&nbsp;<i>Bal Masque,</i>&nbsp;and now she's got
it. I hope she's enjoying herself. I wonder what she'll grow up to.
It will take a jolt of some sort to waken her. She's a dear
thing&mdash;but&mdash;well, she's Pearl Jane!"</p>

<p>And then, he discovered he could claim her for a dance, and at
once did so.</p>

<p>"How's the party?" he inquired, as they swung off.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's blissful! It's double-distilled Paradise!"</p>

<p>"There, there, save your adjectives! Don't be foolishly
extravagant!"</p>

<p>"But don't you think so? Don't you
just&nbsp;<i>love</i>&nbsp;it? All the lights and the people, and
the jewels&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mock jewels."</p>

<p>"What of it? Don't be cynical to-night, Tommy&mdash;dear."</p>

<p>His heart missed a beat, as he caught something in her tone that
he had never heard there before.</p>

<p>He must have shown his perception of it, for he saw a rosy blush
beneath the edge of her little mask, and he hastened to say, "No,
it doesn't matter that they're mock jewels&mdash;for they're mock
people."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, softly, "all but you and me."</p>

<p>Locke was nonplussed. He didn't know whether Pearl Jane was
trying to make love to him, or whether the gayety of the occasion
had gone to her head a little. He decided on the latter opinion,
and steered the talk into a safer channel.</p>

<p>And yet, he couldn't help thinking, she was very sweet, the soft
little chin that nestled against his shoulder, the curve of the
cheek that still showed pink, and most of all the bright happy eyes
that now and then met his through the eyeholes of their masks.</p>

<p>Clearly, he decided, I'd better get away from her. She'll
enchant me in another minute&mdash;and that won't do. Little Pearl
Jane! Waking up! Oh, Lord!</p>

<p>So, with a graceful bow, he handed her to a waiting and eager
Clown, and sauntered off himself to do a duty dance with Kate.</p>

<p>Not but that he liked Kate Vallon, but after all, Locke was not
overly fond of dancing, and he had a dim idea of retreating to the
smoking room as soon as might be.</p>

<p>"Buck up," said Kate, after a few rounds, "you're a good dancer,
Tommy, but you have no soul in it."</p>

<p>"I'd rather paint," Locke returned. "Wouldn't you, Kate?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I would. I'd rather do lots of things. But we're a few
years older than Pearl Jane, or Henry, either. How old are you,
Tommy?"</p>

<p>"Twenty-eight; why?"</p>

<p>"So'm I. Well, after twenty, nowadays, one gets fed up with
dancing."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, lots of old ones love it. I never was keen about it.
Want to sit out a while?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but not with you! Find Jack Henderson for me, won't you?
He's a Continental Soldier."</p>

<p>Not at all minding Kate's candor, Locke went after the man she
preferred. He looked about in the rooms, and then went downstairs
in his search. The staircase was crowded, and as he passed a
"Winter," he heard her say, "How very warm it is&mdash;I must have
some air!"</p>

<p>He turned to see if he could be of assistance, but others were
nearer her, so he went on.</p>

<p>He found Henderson and sent him to Kate.</p>

<p>"My, but I'm glad to be summoned," the cheery Henderson said, as
he reached her. "I didn't dare intrude till I was sent for."</p>

<p>After a few moments they concluded the room was too crowded for
chat, and they started for a tiny balcony that gave from a rear
window.</p>

<p>"What's that?" cried Henderson, as they passed through the
little smoking room, dimly lighted and now deserted.</p>

<p>"What's what?"</p>

<p>"That on the floor, behind the table!"</p>

<p>"Looks like a pillow from a couch," and Kate glanced toward some
gay colored silk that lay in folds.</p>

<p>"It isn't! Kate&mdash;stay back!"</p>

<p>Henderson took another step, and gave a startled
exclamation.</p>

<p>"Keep back, I tell you, Kate. There's been some awful accident.
Call some one&mdash;some man. Call Locke and Post first. Wait,
don't raise a general alarm. Get that Chinese servant."</p>

<p>"What is it, Jack? I will see! Oh, my God!"</p>

<p>Kate Vallon pulled herself together by strong will power.</p>

<p>"Who is it? Take off her mask!"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;oh, I can't! Get Locke&mdash;do, Kate!"</p>

<p>Kate ran through the rooms, and though she didn't see Locke just
then, she saw Henry Post and bade him go at once to the smoking
room.</p>

<p>He did so, and Kate continued her hunt for Charley, trying to
keep from screaming out.</p>

<p>"What is it?" Post asked, coming into the dimly lighted
room.</p>

<p>"Something terrible," Henderson said, gravely. "See here, Post,
this woman is dead. I've felt her heart&mdash;and I tell you, man,
she's dead."</p>

<p>"Who is she?"</p>

<p>"I've no idea. A stranger. I wouldn't raise her mask when Kate
was here, but I've done so now, and I don't know her."</p>

<p>"My heavens! What shall we do? What ought we to do?"</p>

<p>"First get Locke. Also Chinese Charley. And as you go out, shut
the door. I don't fancy being here alone&mdash;but you must shut
the door to keep the women out. Then&mdash;oh, I don't know what
then! Get Locke first."</p>

<p>Henry Post gone, Henderson again looked at the woman's features.
She was beautiful, save for an awful wound where something had
crashed down on her temple, and had surely killed her.</p>

<p>"What a strange accident!" Henderson thought. "If she had fallen
against a fender now&mdash;but there's no mantelpiece in this room.
I wonder if there's a doctor here. I ought to call one. It can do
no harm to leave the poor thing alone for a minute&mdash;I won't go
past the door."</p>

<p>Half uncertainly he rose and went to the door into the
studio.</p>

<p>Slightly opening it, he asked the first man he saw to see if any
doctor was present and would come to him at once.</p>

<p>"I'll get one," and the youth hurried away.</p>

<p>And in a moment he was back, with Doctor Gannett.</p>

<h2><b><a name="Chapter_3" id="Chapter_3">Chapter 3</a><br>
Who Was She?</b>
</h2>

<p>Henderson&nbsp;admitted Doctor Gannett and stood nervously
waiting as the physician stooped over the prostrate form.</p>

<p>Almost impatiently he pulled off the mask and tore away the
filmy veil which still hid the lower portion of the face, and
Henderson noticed with increased pain what a lovely face it was.
Strangely enough, it was not highly colored artificially, indeed,
it could scarcely be said to be made up at all.</p>

<p>Jack Henderson was impressionable and he turned his glance away
as the doctor remorselessly, though gently, moved the wounded head
and peered into the dead eyes.</p>

<p>Then the medical man looked up wonderingly and gazed around.</p>

<p>"What hit her?" he said, with a puzzled frown. "Unless she fell
against something, she must have been&mdash;attacked&mdash;here, we
have it!"</p>

<p>As he brushed aside the voluminous draperies of the Oriental
costume he found that some folds of silk had covered what was
without doubt the instrument of death.</p>

<p>It was a heavy bronze book-end, shaped like the head of a
Sphinx. A quick glance showed the mate to it on the table near
by.</p>

<p>"She was hit on the temple by this weight," the doctor said,
gravely. "It is highly improbable that the bronze was on the floor
and she fell on it&mdash;it looks far more like&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't say it!" Henderson cried. "Who could do such a thing?
Here in Tommy's place?"</p>

<p>"It is certain that she did not fall on it," the doctor went on.
"Had she done so, her head would be nearer the bronze. As you see,
it was down by her knees&mdash;it was hidden by her tunic. It was
used as a club&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Or as a missile," Henderson added.</p>

<p>The doctor looked up quickly. "You're sharp," he said. "Yes, or
as a missile. And if the latter, it was a strong arm and an angry
man who flung it!"</p>

<p>"Who is she?"</p>

<p>"I've no idea. But I know few people here. I just ran in for a
few minutes at the invitation of a friend."</p>

<p>Doctor Gannett himself had worn a simple black domino, which he
had already thrown aside, appearing in ordinary evening dress.</p>

<p>He turned from the body on the floor, and said, "We must notify
the police. I think the best thing is to call in the officer on the
beat and let him take charge. Where is Mr. Locke?"</p>

<p>"He will be here as soon as they can get hold of him," Henderson
returned, beginning to wonder himself why he, who knew Locke only
slightly, was thrust into this prominent position.</p>

<p>Gannett opened the door, to find many anxious, horrified people
crowding about.</p>

<p>"Where is Mr. Locke?" he spoke, commandingly. "Bring him here,
somebody. And somebody else ask the policeman outside to come in.
If you don't see him promptly, telephone Headquarters. There has
been a very serious accident. No one must leave the house until
some investigation is made. And now, who knows the name of the lady
who appeared in a very handsome Oriental costume, with many veils
and scarves and jewels&mdash;and a turban with waving
feathers?"</p>

<p>"White Paradise feathers?" asked an excited girl. "There was
only one costume like that!"</p>

<p>"Yes," and "I remember it!" and such assents fell from the lips
of many.</p>

<p>The startled, huddled crowd, with ordinary human curiosity,
strove to get nearer the door of the little smoking den, and the
men who hurried to carry out the doctor's orders pushed through as
best they could.</p>

<p>Henry Post and Kate Vallon met these messengers in the hall
downstairs.</p>

<p>"Where is Mr. Locke?" one said, as the other went for the
policeman.</p>

<p>"I haven't found him yet," Post replied. "He must be about
somewhere."</p>

<p>"We must find him&mdash;they've called the police."</p>

<p>"The police!" Kate exclaimed, "oh, what for?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know exactly&mdash;but nobody must leave the
house."</p>

<p>"Indeed we will leave the house!" Kate said. "Henry, I shall
take Pearl Jane away at once. That child shan't be mixed up in any
police affair! You stay here, Henry, and find Tommy, and see the
thing through. I'll find Pearl Jane and take her home."</p>

<p>"Better not," the young man advised. He was a lawyer named
Jarvis, and he seemed to speak with authority,</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Kate.</p>

<p>"It's a pretty grave matter to leave a house where a mysterious
death has occurred&mdash;after you're ordered not to."</p>

<p>"But that's only Doctor Gannett's order. Not the law."</p>

<p>"You'd better stay," Jarvis advised. "You'll be interviewed even
if you run away&mdash;so why not face the music here?"</p>

<p>"I don't mind for myself," Kate said, slowly, "I'm thinking of
Pearl Jane."</p>

<p>"Little Miss Cutler?" Jarvis asked. "Where is she?"</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;I can't seem to find anybody. It's queer
where Tommy can be. And Charley&mdash;where can he have gone
to?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps they've gone up to the smoking room by the back
stairs," Post suggested. "They're doubtless
there&mdash;because&mdash;because they aren't anywhere else," he
concluded a little lamely.</p>

<p>"I didn't know there was a back stairs," Kate exclaimed. "Let us
go that way."</p>

<p>"Do you want to go back to&mdash;to that room?" Post said.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do," Kate returned. "I want to stand by Tommy if there's
going to be trouble. But more, I want to find that child."</p>

<p>"Perhaps she's up there," Jarvis suggested.</p>

<p>"Let's go and see."</p>

<p>But before they could start, an officer came in at the front
door.</p>

<p>"What's up?" he inquired, not greatly disturbed at the fact that
all the people he saw were in fantastic costumes. Washington Square
policemen are not easily surprised.</p>

<p>They told him, and Kate suggested the back stairs.</p>

<p>"No," he said, and strode up the main staircase.</p>

<p>He stormed his way through the shuddering crowd, who willingly
fell back for his passing, and opened the door of the smoking
room.</p>

<p>Crossing to where the still figure lay, he gave a brief but
comprehending glance at it, then after a few low words to Doctor
Gannett, he said, "I'll telephone the Precinct
Station&mdash;they'll send men. Where's the boss&mdash;the man of
the house? Locke, isn't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes, do you know him?" Gannett asked.</p>

<p>"By sight, I see him now and then. Nice quiet chap. Who's the
lady?"</p>

<p>"We don't know. But she was one of Mr. Locke's guests."</p>

<p>"All right. Now, look here, nobody must leave this house. Nobody
must touch the body. Nobody more must come into this room. I don't
say that woman was murdered&mdash;but it looks like that to me. So,
doctor, go out and tell the people what I say&mdash;and hold
them."</p>

<p>But Doctor Gannett found this no easy task.</p>

<p>Heedless of the law's commands, several insisted loudly that
they were going home. Others slipped away stealthily. But many
stayed because they were afraid to disobey orders, and some because
they were held by curiosity.</p>

<p>Of course, all masks were removed, and some of those less
interested in the "accident" as it was still called, began to drift
toward the supper room.</p>

<p>Here they found the waiters had fled in terror, and they helped
themselves to the viands.</p>

<p>"Shall I send the orchestra away?" Post asked the policeman, and
he was permitted to do so.</p>

<p>"It's too dreadful," he said to Kate, "to have that jazz band
sitting there silent."</p>

<p>"Where's Tommy?" was Kate's only reply.</p>

<p>"I'm going to find him," Post said, resolutely, and started on a
systematic search of the premises.</p>

<p>And then the police came.</p>

<p>"I'm Inspector Dickson," one said, apparently speaking to any
one who would listen. "Who's in charge here?"</p>

<p>No one answered, until Doctor Gannett said, "It's Mr. Locke's
house, but we haven't located him yet."</p>

<p>Dickson gave him a sharp look, but asked no more questions.</p>

<p>Accompanied by two of his companions, a special detective and a
deputy from the office of the Chief Medical Examiner, he went
upstairs at once, while two plain clothes men took charge of the
halls and stairway.</p>

<p>"Get busy, Doctor Babcock," Dickson said, and the examiner
proceeded to his duty.</p>

<p>Detective Hutchins joined in the examination, and in only a few
minutes they announced that the victim had been killed by the
bronze book-end, thrown by some one else.</p>

<p>"Here's the other book-end on this table," Hutchins said;
"presumably, the assailant stood here and threw the thing. It may
be, however, that he lifted it from the table and moved nearer to
his victim and merely hit her with it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No; it was thrown," Doctor Babcock declared. "The nature of
this abrasion on the temple proves that. It wasn't such a very hard
blow&mdash;as it must have been, if effected nearer by. Indeed, if
it hadn't struck just where it did, it would have made a bad
bruise, but needn't necessarily have been fatal."</p>

<p>"But it was fatal," pursued the detective, "and it was the work
of another. Therefore, it is homicide, and we must proceed
accordingly. Where's the man of the house?"</p>

<p>Nobody answered, and the police all showed their surprise.</p>

<p>"Has he vamoosed?" asked Hutchins quickly. "Hunt for him,
Briggs. You know him, don't you?"</p>

<p>Briggs, the officer first called in, said that he did, and he
went on his search.</p>

<p>"Now until he's found, somebody must be at the head of things,"
Hutchins went on. He went to the door of the studio and looked at
the group of people remaining there.</p>

<p>Though the detective seemed unimpressed, it was a strange sight.
The motley crowd, in the gay garments of the masquerade, yet all
showing anxious, curious faces, was incongruous, even
grotesque.</p>

<p>Young girls shuddered and drew nearer their escorts or the elder
women. The men were deeply concerned&mdash;they understood better
what must be before them.</p>

<p>"Until Mr. Locke appears," Hutchins said, in a stern voice, "who
is his nearest relative or friend? Who will represent him for the
moment?"</p>

<p>For a minute no one replied, and then Jarvis, the lawyer, said,
"Not in any legal way, but as a friend of Mr. Locke, you may report
to me. I am Rodman Jarvis&mdash;here is my card."</p>

<p>The man had come in the guise of a Troubadour. He had laid
aside, with his mask, his feathered hat and his guitar. But he had
brought his pocketbook and as he proffered the card, he seemed all
conscious of his unusual costume. Nor was it unbecoming. A tall,
well set-up young fellow, he was quite at ease, and deeply
interested in the proceedings.</p>

<p>Hutchins looked at him steadily.</p>

<p>"You're a friend of Mr. Locke?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"An intimate friend?"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't put it that way. But a good pal, and ready to do
anything I can for him."</p>

<p>"Very well. Stay by me. Now, who of all you present can identify
the lady who has been&mdash;injured? Surely some one here knows
her."</p>

<p>No one responded, except those who declared they did not know
her.</p>

<p>"You saw her only when masked," Hutchins said, reflectively.</p>

<p>"Yes," put in a vivacious young woman, "and besides her mask she
had about seven veils round her face and throat! I might know her
if I saw her face."</p>

<p>This was a new idea to the detective.</p>

<p>"True," he said; "I shall have to ask you all to look at her. At
least, until some one can identify her."</p>

<p>It was soon arranged, and by permission of the examiner the body
was laid on the divan in the smoking room. Hutchins took good care
to shut off by chairs the part of the room where it had lain, for
it seemed to his quick eye there was much to be learned from the
conditions there. Already he had noted a cigarette end, and many
spangles.</p>

<p>But he had much to do, and such investigation could wait.</p>

<p>Dickson and the detective directed the line of people that must
pass by the divan and tell all they knew concerning the pathetic
figure that lay there.</p>

<p>The scene was appalling. Girls became hysterical, women sobbed
violently, and even the men were deeply agitated. The masquerade
costumes only accented the horror, and like a strange, weird
pageant the line filed by.</p>

<p>Toward the last came Kate Vallon and Henry Post.</p>

<p>They had not found Tommy, neither had they found Chinese
Charley.</p>

<p>And, worst of all, they had not found Pearl Jane.</p>

<p>Post tried to comfort Kate by saying that he was sure the girl
had run away home, but Kate was not so sure of this.</p>

<p>They could only wonder at the absence of all those they had
searched for.</p>

<p>As these two reached the divan each looked long and earnestly at
the dead woman.</p>

<p>They saw a sweet young face, pretty and natural. The contusion
did not show, as the doctors had turned the head on that side.</p>

<p>The eyes were closed, and the cheeks showed a slight tinge of
rouge. The lips were not made up at all, and were already pale.</p>

<p>The costume was exquisite. The finest type of Oriental
magnificence, with full silk trousers, a voluminous tunic, dainty
bodice and jacket, all of rich, soft silk, in gorgeous coloring and
ornamented with glittering sequins and mock jewels.</p>

<p>On her hands beside a wedding ring, were several gaudy paste
gems, quite evidently part of the costume. All of her head-gear had
been removed and her hair, though disordered somewhat, was soft and
plentiful.</p>

<p>On her feet were jeweled and embroidered Turkish slippers and
fine silk stockings.</p>

<p>"How lovely!" was Kate's involuntary exclamation. "But, who is
she?"</p>

<p>"I've not the faintest idea," Post said; "I've never seen her
before, I'm sure of that. And I don't believe Tommy ever did,
either&mdash;she isn't our sort, Kate. As to Tommy's
skipping&mdash;nonsense&mdash;he's taken Pearl Jane
home&mdash;that's where he's gone."</p>

<p>And no one on the line of spectators knew the unfortunate
woman.</p>

<p>Hutchins was shrewd and he watched eagerly to find some one who
seemed to dissemble, or who seemed ill at ease beyond the natural
horror of the occasion. But he found none such, and after the
ordeal was over, he was convinced, that so far he had neither any
clue to the identity of the criminal nor the victim.</p>

<p>Dickson sighed. He was up against a hard case, and the odds were
against him. His men were searching high and low for the man of the
house, and for his servant. He didn't believe that Locke had merely
gone to escort a guest home. If he were the right sort of a man he
would have sent some one with her and remained himself at his own
home.</p>

<p>Hutchins agreed to this, and leaving the room by the back way he
began a search himself.</p>

<p>As he closed the door behind him, his quick ears caught a
stifled sob.</p>

<p>It seemed to come from a closed closet, and, throwing opened the
door and, striking a match, simultaneously, he discovered some one
huddled among a lot of canvases and artists' odds and ends.</p>

<p>"Come out! Who are you?" he ordered, sharply, but changed his
tone as he clutched at the arm of a trembling girl.</p>

<p>"Oh," she sobbed, "oh, what shall I do?"</p>

<p>"Do, miss? Why, just come out, and tell me who you are. Don't be
afraid of me&mdash;if you've nothing else to be afraid of! What's
your name?"</p>

<p>"I'm Miss Cutler," and, somehow, meeting this crisis seemed to
give her back her nerve. "I was&mdash;I was
frightened&mdash;so&mdash;so I hid."</p>

<p>"I see you did," Hutchins remarked, dryly, his own sympathy for
her waning, as she recovered her poise. "Why did you do it?"</p>

<p>"Do what?"</p>

<p>"Hide&mdash;of course. You didn't do anything else&mdash;did
you? Nothing wrong, now?"</p>

<p>"No, of course I didn't!" she began gravely, but broke down
again and sobbed.</p>

<p>"May I go home? Oh, please let me go home."</p>

<p>"You can go pretty soon. I see you were at the party."</p>

<p>The Dutch Peasant costume, though still effective, was crumpled
and wet with tears, and, though Hutchins' heart almost stood still
as he saw it, there was certainly a small stain on the sleeve that
looked like blood.</p>

<p>Without another word he drew her quickly into the den, and took
her straight to the divan.</p>

<p>"Miss Cutler," he said, as he grasped her arm firmly, "did you
kill that woman?"</p>

<p>"No!" she shrieked, and fainted away.</p>

<p>"No need to be brutal, Hutchins," Doctor Babcock cried, as he
took the unconscious girl into his charge.</p>

<p>"Why, it's Pearl Jane!" cried Miss Vallon. "Henry, here she is!
Where did you find her?"</p>

<p>Kate spoke to the doctor, not having heard Hutchins' question to
the girl.</p>

<p>"She was hiding in a back closet," the detective answered her.
"I must hold her&mdash;till she can explain some matters. Keep her
by you, Doctor. Or let Dickson do it. I'm off to find Locke now."
And again the detective started down those back stairs.</p>

<p>"Well," Dickson looked sadly at his wits' end. "This is sure a
mysterious case. Here's a dead woman and nobody knows who she is,
or who did for her. Next, there's nobody to make a report
to&mdash;except that lawyer chap&mdash;and he seems to me a little
b it too smart. Yes, he is, a little too smart."</p>

<p>Dickson was talking to the Medical Examiner, who had succeeded
in restoring Pearl Jane to her senses, but wouldn't yet allow her
to talk.</p>

<p>They were in the smoking room, which they kept cleared of all
save those they wished to interview. The studio and halls were
guarded and policemen were stationed out side the house, which no
one was as yet allowed to leave or enter.</p>

<p>An officer from outside came to Dickson.</p>

<p>"Here's a go," he said; "there's a swell car out there, and the
chauffeur says he has orders to wait for his missus, and she hasn't
come out and he wants to know if she can be let to go."</p>

<p>"Who is his mistress?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Barham&mdash;Mrs. Andrew Barham."</p>

<p>"Oh, the society people. I've heard the name. Well, get Mrs.
Barham from the studio and let me speak to her."</p>

<p>In the studio a plain clothes man was industriously taking the
names and addresses of the guests, preparatory to dismissing some
of them at least.</p>

<p>As yet he had not the name of Mrs. Barham, and no one responded
to his query for it.</p>

<p>"Maybe she went home," some one said. "A few did go."</p>

<p>"She would have gone in her car, then," the officer argued; "the
chauffeur has been waiting here since before eleven."</p>

<p>"What time is it now?"</p>

<p>"Eleven-thirty. I say," he jerked his head over his shoulder,
"maybe that's her!"</p>

<p>"Get the chauffeur up here," the other said, gravely.</p>

<p>And when he arrived he was asked concerning the costume his
mistress wore when he brought her to the house.</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir," Louis said; "she had on a large dark
cloak."</p>

<p>"Don't waste time," said Dickson, shortly. "Show him the
body."</p>

<p>So Louis, the chauffeur of Madeleine Barham was taken in to look
at the still figure in the Oriental garb.</p>

<p>"It is Madame," he said, startled into a scared trembling.</p>

<p>"Her name?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Andrew Barham."</p>

<h2><b><a name="Chapter_4" id="Chapter_4">Chapter 4</a><br>
An Unknown Guest</b>
</h2>

<p>Sobs&nbsp;were checked and hysterics forgotten in an intense and
burning curiosity.</p>

<p>Mrs. Andrew Barham&mdash;here&mdash;at Tommy Locke's party!</p>

<p>It could scarcely be believed.</p>

<p>They stared at the imperturbable chauffeur. It was plain to be
seen that the man was deeply moved, but his training prevented any
expression of grief or excitement.</p>

<p>"Does any one here know Mr. Barham?" Hutchins inquired.</p>

<p>He stood in the doorway between the studio and the den, or
smoking room. Indeed, the interest had become so intense it was
almost impossible to set a barrier to such as insisted on forcing a
way.</p>

<p>But the detective had guards watching the places and people he
was most interested in.</p>

<p>No one did&mdash;that was clear. And no one knew Mrs. Barham
personally, though nearly all had heard her name.</p>

<p>"But to be here, she must have been somebody's friend," Hutchins
persisted. "I find that there were perhaps fifty invited
guests&mdash;and I'm told there were perhaps about sixty-five or
seventy people here. So many invited guests brought friends or
asked them. It may be that was the way Mrs. Barham came&mdash;so
who brought her?"</p>

<p>It was impossible to get any other than negative replies.</p>

<p>The only conclusion to be drawn was that Mrs. Barham came to the
party as the guest of some one who had already gone home. Which
added a further inexplicable mystery. Why should the person or
persons who brought Mrs. Barham run away in this emergency?</p>

<p>Why should Mrs. Barham have come at all, save as a happy guest
in quest of pleasure? Could she have been trapped there?</p>

<p>No; for she came from her own home in her own car. Moreover, she
wore a handsome and expensive costume, quite evidently in view of
the masquerade festivity.</p>

<p>And, though no one could tell the exact time she arrived,
several agreed that she had been at the house at least an hour
before the tragedy was discovered.</p>

<p>Hutchins instructed his men to get from Miss Vallon a complete
list of all the people invited, whether they had come or not.</p>

<p>Then he said, "Next, I suppose, we must notify Mr. Barham. How
shall we best do it, Dickson?"</p>

<p>"Telephone, of course. Is Mr. Barham at home, Louis?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir. I am only chauffeur of Madame's car."</p>

<p>"Who are in the family?"</p>

<p>"Only Mr. and Mrs. Barham, and Mrs. Selden, the mother of
Madame."</p>

<p>"What's the number?"</p>

<p>Louis told, and then Dickson said, "You do it, Hutchins. Be as
decent as you can. You've more natural tact than I have."</p>

<p>"Is there any other telephone?" Hutchins asked, looking at the
gaping crowd, in their carnival dress.</p>

<p>"Yes," Post told him, "in Mr. Locke's bedroom. I'll show
you."</p>

<p>They went to the bedroom and Post stood by, while Hutchins
called the Barham house.</p>

<p>A servant answered, and the detective asked for Mr. Barham.</p>

<p>"He's in bed and asleep; shall I call his valet?"</p>

<p>"No; waken him. It's an important matter."</p>

<p>And in a few moments a voice said, "Andrew Barham speaking."</p>

<p>"Is&mdash;is your wife at home, Mr. Barham?"</p>

<p>Hutchins hadn't intended to begin that way, but he was a
sensitive sort, and he dreaded making the bare announcement of his
news.</p>

<p>"Who is this? Why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"It is a grave matter. Kindly reply."</p>

<p>"No, then, she is not. It is now quarter of twelve. She is out
with some friends."</p>

<p>"I have bad news for you, Mr. Barham. This is the police
speaking&mdash;Detective Hutchins. Your wife is here&mdash;at the
friend's house&mdash;injured, sir&mdash;fatally injured."</p>

<p>Hutchins heard a slight gasp, and then a hurried, "I will get
there as quickly as I can. At Mrs. Gardner's?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Gardner's! No. At Mr. Locke's!"</p>

<p>"Where?" The question rang out like a shot. "Who is Mr.
Locke?"</p>

<p>"That's where she is, sir. Mr. Thomas Locke, Washington
Square."</p>

<p>"My wife at Mr. Locke's! I cannot understand&mdash;but never
mind, man, I'll be right down there. Give me the exact
address&mdash;and stay&mdash;what is the injury&mdash;tell me a
word or two&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She hit her head&mdash;sir&mdash;really&mdash;I think you'd
better come along at once. It's a party&mdash;a masquerade
party&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Are you crazy? My wife isn't at any masquerade party!"</p>

<p>"Yes, she is&mdash;come on, please."</p>

<p>"I will. Wait a minute&mdash;must I face the whole crowd of
revelers?"</p>

<p>"I understand. No, Mr. Barham. Come&mdash;let me see&mdash;come
to the front door but ask the man in charge to bring you up the
back stairway."</p>

<p>"Oh, it needn't be as secret as that&mdash;but&mdash;I can't
seem to think coherently. Washington Square! I'll be there in
record time."</p>

<p>With his usual efficiency and avoidance of all waste motion,
Andrew Barham had summoned his valet, and his chauffeur, and had
ordered his car while he was getting into his clothes.</p>

<p>Prall, the valet, came in to find him already almost entirely
dressed.</p>

<p>With a few quick, somewhat jerky words, he explained the
situation to his trusted servant, saying, "Come with me, Prall, I
think it's very serious."</p>

<p>Awed by the look on his master's face, Prall bowed a silent
assent, and in the shortest possible time, they were speeding down
the Avenue, careful only to avoid a hold up by the traffic
squad.</p>

<p>"Did you ever know of Mrs. Barham's going to any place on
Washington Square, Prall?"</p>

<p>"Never, sir."</p>

<p>And Andrew Barham wondered.</p>

<p>Madeleine had said he was always wondering, but surely he had
never before had such occasion for wonderment. Madeleine, at a
fancy dress ball&mdash;in Washington Square,
and&mdash;hurt&mdash;didn't that man say fatally hurt?</p>

<p>To be sure, Madeleine went where she chose&mdash;she had her own
friends&mdash;but Barham knew who they were, if he didn't know them
personally; and they were of her own circles, most
certainly&nbsp;<i>not</i>&nbsp;of a Washington Square type.</p>

<p>So he wondered, blindly, and at last they were there.</p>

<p>Barham hurried up the steps, quite forgetting to ask for the
back staircase.</p>

<p>In fact, the sight of several policemen about, so took away his
wits, he thought of little else for the instant.</p>

<p>Before Barham arrived, Hutchins had arranged things to give the
least possible shock. Henry Post had been put on duty downstairs to
see that no one took advantage of the detective's absence to get
away. Pearl Jane had been ensconced in Locke's bedroom with Kate
Vallon to look after her.</p>

<p>In the room with Mrs. Barham's body were only the members of the
Police Force, Doctor Gannett and Rodman Jarvis, who still expressed
his willingness to act for Locke in any way he could.</p>

<p>Chinese Charley was still missing, and the officer who admitted
Barham took him at once to the back stairs.</p>

<p>"It's very bad, sir, and there's a horde of curiosity seekers in
the studio. This way, sir."</p>

<p>Barham had directed Prall to accompany him, as he might need
service of some sort.</p>

<p>The officer stumbled a little on the narrow dark stairs, and
Barham impatiently passed him, exclaiming, "Hurry, man&mdash;I must
see for myself!"</p>

<p>The first time, Prall observed to himself, he had ever seen the
master excited. "And small wonder," he added, as he himself began
to feel a sense of horror.</p>

<p>Knowing better than to try to break such news slowly, Hutchins
merely greeted Andrew Barham with a grave nod, and said, "There she
is, sir."</p>

<p>And Andrew Barham looked down on the body of his wife&mdash;whom
he had seen last at dinner that same night&mdash;now, in gaudy
array, and cold in death.</p>

<p>The man seemed turned to stone. At first his face showed
incredulity, stark unbelief&mdash;then as he realized the truth of
what his eyes told him he seemed to paralyze&mdash;he was utterly
incapable of speech or action.</p>

<p>A fine looking man, the detective saw. Straight, strong, vital.
His hair was light brown&mdash;almost golden&mdash;and had a curly
wave in it that gave charm to an otherwise stern cast of
features.</p>

<p>His eyes were gray-blue, and now they were so blank, so dazed,
as to have almost no expression whatever.</p>

<p>It was the man, Prall, who moved first.</p>

<p>He had stood beside his master, wondering, staring, and then all
at once he broke into deep sobs and turned away to hide his
face.</p>

<p>It seemed to galvanize the other, and Andrew Barham gave a
strong shudder as he tried to pull himself together.</p>

<p>"It is my wife," he said, turning to the detective. "What do you
know about it? How came she here? We do not know this place."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Barham must have known, sir. She came in her own car, with
her own chauffeur."</p>

<p>"Louis! Is he here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Barham."</p>

<p>"It is a mystery. I do not understand at all. But this is my
wife&mdash;and&mdash;she is dead. Was she&mdash;was it an
accident?"</p>

<p>"We do not think so."</p>

<p>And then Doctor Gannett gave his account of the finding of the
body on the floor&mdash;</p>

<p>"On the floor?" Barham interrupted. "Just where?"</p>

<p>He was shown, and he wondered more than ever.</p>

<p>"With this book-end," he mused, "this bronze Sphinx. You say it
is not possible that it was an accident? That she fell on
it&mdash;she was on the floor&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No"; and Doctor Babcock added his own testimony to
Gannett's.</p>

<p>Barham drew a long sigh, and brushed his hand across his
eyes.</p>

<p>"Then," he said, and he looked at the policemen in turn, as if
arraigning them, "then you conclude it was&mdash;murder?"</p>

<p>"We do, sir," Dickson answered.</p>

<p>"Then move heaven and earth to find out who did it! Spare no
time, pains or expense. Who
would&mdash;who&nbsp;<i>could</i>&nbsp;have reason to kill a woman
like that? But, strangest of all is her presence in this place,
that has yet to be explained. Everything has yet to be explained.
Are any of her friends here&mdash;in the other room?"</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Barham, everybody in the other room declares he or she
never saw Mrs. Barham before."</p>

<p>Again the man seemed so blankly bewildered as to be on the verge
of losing his mind.</p>

<p>But he wasn't. Andrew Barham was unutterably amazed,
astounded&mdash;but he wasn't yet dazed. His mind was thinking with
lightning quickness.</p>

<p>"Who did it?" he demanded again. "You must have some
suspicion&mdash;some slight clue!"</p>

<p>"We have no suspicion, Mr. Barham," Hutchins told him, "and as
to clues or evidence, we've not been able to go into those things
yet. Think, it only happened less than two hours ago."</p>

<p>"Less than two hours ago! Then why wasn't I told sooner?"</p>

<p>"Because nobody knew who she was."</p>

<p>"Nobody knew my wife! In a house where she had come as a
guest!"</p>

<p>"No, nobody knew her."</p>

<p>"The host? Didn't he know her?"</p>

<p>"The host&mdash;Mr. Locke, cannot be found."</p>

<p>Andrew Barham dropped into a chair.</p>

<p>"Do you know you are telling a very strange story to me?"</p>

<p>"It is a strange story, Mr. Barham. But it is all true. Mr.
Locke cannot be found&mdash;nor can Charley."</p>

<p>"Who is Charley?"</p>

<p>"A Chinese boy&mdash;Locke's servant."</p>

<p>"Do you think it might be, then, that my wife came to the wrong
house? I have heard of such mistakes."</p>

<p>"That might be. But this is the address she gave her own
chauffeur."</p>

<p>"May I see Louis?"</p>

<p>The chauffeur was brought in and told his tale with the same
immovable calm he always displayed.</p>

<p>He addressed himself to Barham.</p>

<p>"Madame ordered her car for nine-thirty," he said.</p>

<p>"She bade me drive her here. I did so. When she alighted, she
told me to be here for her, a little before eleven, as she was then
going to Madame Gardner's. I was here shortly before eleven and
waited a little distance away. While I was waiting, there seemed to
be some commotion&mdash;several people left this house hurriedly,
and some policemen came."</p>

<p>"You sat still and waited?" put in Hutchins, hastily.</p>

<p>"Why not? It was the order. And I knew not but it was apartments
and the police had naught to do with the home Madame visited. Yes,
I waited, until maybe half after eleven, then the commotion grew
more&mdash;and I began to feel fear. I came to the door and asked
for Madame. The rest is known."</p>

<p>Louis was the perfect French chauffeur. His manner and mien
showed just the right shade of grief, without being unduly or
presumptuously personal.</p>

<p>Hutchins watched him out of the corner of his eye. He didn't
always trust French chauffeurs.</p>

<p>Barham, who seemed to read the detective's mind, said, "You may
depend on Louis's story. He is absolutely reliable."</p>

<p>There was a silence. Andrew Barham was thinking deeply.</p>

<p>At last he said, "What must be the procedure? I am at a loss to
know what I am to do."</p>

<p>For the first time Rodman Jarvis spoke.</p>

<p>"It is a most unusual case&mdash;we all see that. But, speaking
as a lawyer, I want to ask you. Doctor Babcock, as Medical
Examiner, if you can't waive certain technical considerations and
let Mr. Barham remove his wife's body to-night&mdash;if he wishes
to do so."</p>

<p>Barham gave the young man a grateful look.</p>

<p>"That is just what I do want," he said, "but not unless it is a
proper and legal proceeding. I am shocked and horrified enough as
it is, without leaving her here any longer than is absolutely
necessary. If she could be taken to the Funeral Director's&mdash;or
to my home&mdash;yet, stay, Mr. Dickson, nothing&mdash;no
consideration of my feelings or anything else, shall be done that
will put a straw in the way of finding the murderer. That must and
shall be done!"</p>

<p>His voice almost rang out in this decision, and Hutchins
reassured him quickly.</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Barham, that won't matter, that way. It's only that
it's a bit hasty to turn over the body to the relatives before a
step has been taken to solve the mystery. Yet, it can be of no help
to retain the body. The doctor's reports are full and complete, and
there is little or no evidence to be learned from the body itself.
If necessary to see it again that can be done at the
undertaker's&mdash;better there than at your home. And if an
autopsy is held&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hutchins checked himself. He was expert in trying to carry on
his detective work and yet spare the feelings of the bereaved ones,
but he frequently fell into error.</p>

<p>However, Andrew Barham took it rationally.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Hutchins, if an autopsy is indicated, it can be
performed. May I then send for the funeral people? May my man Prall
telephone for them? I have ahead of me the difficult task of
breaking this news to my wife's mother. And, as you can understand,
it has shaken me terribly."</p>

<p>One and all they admired him. As man to man, Barham had a fine,
a sensible attitude. It was plain to be seen how shocked and
grieved he was, it was clearly evident that he was holding on to
his composure by mere will power, and every one present wanted to
favor him in every possible way.</p>

<p>"You know where to find me," he went on. "Here is my business
card&mdash;I am a consulting engineer, and though I have several
business engagements out of the city, for the immediate future, I
shall, of course, cancel them all. Prall, call the funeral company,
and ask them to come here as soon as may be."</p>

<p>"There's no use asking you any more about Mrs. Barham's
movements this evening," Dickson said, "for you know even less than
we do. You frequently spent your evenings in different places?"</p>

<p>"Yes," and Barham showed no embarrassment at this query. "We had
not altogether the same tastes, and Mrs. Barham had her own car and
latchkey, as I have. So we came and went as we chose."</p>

<p>"When did you see her last, Mr. Barham?"</p>

<p>"At dinner this evening. We dined alone&mdash;with only my
mother-in-law. After dinner, Mrs. Barham went to her rooms to dress
for some party, and I went to my Club."</p>

<p>"What Club was that, sir?"</p>

<p>"The Players'. Don't hesitate to ask all the direct questions
you wish. I know how necessary they are."</p>

<p>But this willingness seemed to take away Dickson's desire to
make inquiries, and he only said, "There's plenty of time ahead for
all that."</p>

<p>"There will be an inquest?" Barham asked.</p>

<p>"Yes; but don't feel obliged to attend, Mr. Barham, unless you
like. I can arrange so that you needn't."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes&mdash;I propose to help with this search for the
criminal. And I can do it better if I follow the course of the
inquiries. But I can do it better yet, if I can sometimes follow
them unobserved. I will, therefore, if I see fit, sit in the back
of the room, or some obscure corner. You see&mdash;" he set his
fine white teeth together in a determined way&mdash;"you see,
somebody did this thing&mdash;you are sure&mdash;" he broke off
suddenly to say to Doctor Babcock, "you are positive it could not
have been an accident?"</p>

<p>"Positive."</p>

<p>"I ask again, because I didn't see the body when it was on the
floor. And&mdash;I confess I would rather it had been an accident.
Who could have wanted to put an end to the life of my young and
beautiful Madeleine?"</p>

<p>It was the first time he had spoken thus&mdash;as if he were
alone&mdash;but he quickly resumed his outer manner of
composure.</p>

<p>"Then if you are sure, there was a murderer&mdash;find him!"</p>

<p>His tone was that of an ultimatum, his air one of finality, and
rising, he began to pace the room.</p>

<p>Nor did he speak again until he was informed that the
undertaker's men had arrived.</p>

<p>Then he superintended the removal of the body himself, he went
downstairs without so much as a glance at the few curious ones who
were rude enough to peer out from the studio door at him, and after
the box that held the wife he had loved was put in place, he went
home in Madeleine's car, leaving Prall to go with the undertaker in
Barham's own car.</p>

<p>"Don't arrange for the funeral, of course, Prall," he said, as a
final order. "Just see that everything is done right, and when you
can, go home and go to bed. I'll look after myself."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," said Prall.</p>

<p>The police officers looked at each other.</p>

<p>"There's a man for you!" Dickson said, and Hutchins heartily
agreed.</p>

<p>"He's a real man," Jarvis put in. "He thanked me for what I had
done, with tears in his eyes, and I haven't done anything."</p>

<p>"Yes, you did, Mr. Jarvis," Babcock said; "I should have kept
that woman here all night, if you hadn't turned up. But it's a
relief to the poor man to get that part of it over with, I know.
Now to get rid of the bunch in the next room and to get rid of them
properly. They ought to be interrogated as well as just to get
their home addresses."</p>

<p>"They have been, mostly," Jarvis said. "I slipped in there while
you were talking with Mr. Barham, and the men were working fast.
Mr. Barham was completely bowled over, wasn't he? I can't get his
face out of my mind."</p>

<p>"Yes, and he took it like a man," Doctor Gannett said. "I have
had to tell many a man that his wife was dead, and I never saw a
braver attitude. And he loved her&mdash;you could tell that the way
he looked at her. I could."</p>

<p>Then the police, by rather slow degrees, dismissed the waiting
guests, and the Clowns, the Knights, the Juliets and the Winters
with their cloaks drawn about their gaudy array, went out into the
quiet Square.</p>

<p>"Do you want to stay here all night, Miss Vallon?" Hutchins
asked, kindly. "Would you rather keep the young lady here? I must
tell you that I have to question her to-morrow morning&mdash;sorry,
but it can't be helped."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, indeed!" Kate cried. "I wouldn't stay here for
anything! I never want to enter this house again! But I will take
Miss Cutler home with me, and you may see her at my house whenever
you wish."</p>

<p>Hutchins agreed to this, and Henry Post, looking very weary,
came to escort the two girls home.</p>

<p>"I'm about all in," he admitted; "I never was so done up."</p>

<p>"What do you think&mdash;" Kate began.</p>

<p>"I'm too tired to think at all," he returned, and they went home
in almost complete silence.</p>

<h2><b><a name="Chapter_5" id="Chapter_5">Chapter 5</a><br>
Hutchins Investigates</b>
</h2>

<p>"Now," Hutchins said, "we can get to work on a real
investigation. Of conditions, I mean. Had to do up the possible
witnesses first. But they were all impossible witnesses! I never
saw a lot of people who knew less&mdash;or pretended to."</p>

<p>"First," Inspector Dickson remarked, calmly, "we'll eat. There's
a fine layout in the pantry, and we may as well put some of it to
use. Call in Briggs and any others of our men."</p>

<p>So, instead of funeral baked meats coldly furnishing forth a
marriage table, the pleasant little supper ordered for Tommy
Locke's guests regaled the hearty members of the Police Force.</p>

<p>Afterward the two principals made a tour of the place.</p>

<p>In the main, they found little of interest. The usual furniture
of a bachelor's studio quarters; of a man, apparently neither rich
nor poverty-stricken. The appointments were plain and far from
being over-abundant, yet the place was comfortable.</p>

<p>Small gilded chairs from the caterer's had, of course, been
hired for the occasion, as had a long hatrack in the hall and a
similar one in the ladies' dressing room.</p>

<p>This room interested Hutchins, being, as it was, Locke's
bedroom.</p>

<p>"It ought to give us a line on the man's personality," the
detective said, hopefully.</p>

<p>But it was not very indicative. The clothing in the wardrobe and
the simple toilet articles only gave evidence of a decently tidy
man of moderate tastes in every way.</p>

<p>"Colorless chap," Hutchins said, disgustedly; "hardest kind in
the world to trace. Now, if he had frisky pictures on his walls, or
Bolshevik books hidden in his dresser, we might look for something
decided. But these every-dayish, plain American citizen
fellows&mdash;where are you?"</p>

<p>"If he's an artist, he ought to have some personality," Dickson
suggested.</p>

<p>"Probably has, as to temperament and all that. But I don't
believe he's much of an artist&mdash;I've never heard the
name&mdash;have you?"</p>

<p>"No; but there are hundreds of artists within two blocks of this
place whose names haven't been heard around the world&mdash;as yet.
Let's look in the bathroom&mdash;may surprise his secrets
there."</p>

<p>"Nixy!" and Hutchins looked his discouragement. "I deduce that
he is a man who uses soap and water, who shaves himself with a
safety razor, and uses pumice stone on his teeth."</p>

<p>The last after a peep into a small jar on the glass shelf.</p>

<p>"Well, then to the scene of the crime next."</p>

<p>"You see," Hutchins explained, as he drew away the protecting
chairs, "I fenced this place off because I thought those hoodlums
would trample it, like cattle on a picnic field. But it seems to be
intact. Yet I daresay it will show up just about nothing."</p>

<p>"Mostly spangles," Dickson observed, looking at the glittering
specks on the rug.</p>

<p>"Are they from that rig of Mrs. Barham's?"</p>

<p>"No"; Dickson knew more about these things than Hutchins. "No,
hers were iridescent&mdash;these are silver-colored&mdash;tin,
probably."</p>

<p>He picked up a few.</p>

<p>"Save them, anyway&mdash;put them in an envelope&mdash;gather
all you can. Probably they are off of more than one gown. Now,
here's a long white glove&mdash;but that might belong to
anybody."</p>

<p>"Save it&mdash;it's a possible clue. Well, here are two
cigarette stubs&mdash;women never care where they throw them! and
here are three hair-pins&mdash;all different. Here's a man's glove,
a dagger&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A dagger!"</p>

<p>"Oh, just a tinsel one&mdash;out of some Spanish girl's
hair&mdash;it will bend if you look at it."</p>

<p>"Keep it. It shows the presence of your Spanish girl on the
scene."</p>

<p>"Probably before the crime. You see, Dickson, this place, near
the divan and table, was a favorite lounging spot, and they all
drifted in here between dances. Then it was doubtless during a
dance that the crime occurred, when this room was practically
deserted, and also when that Jazz racket would drown any
sounds."</p>

<p>"That's right so far, Hutchins. But get all the scraps here you
can&mdash;for among them must be the clues left by the
murderer&mdash;if any."</p>

<p>"Yes, if any! Well, here's a fan and a mask&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A mask!"</p>

<p>"Yes, why's that strange?"</p>

<p>"Because no one had as yet unmasked! It isn't Mrs.
Barham's&mdash;she had hers on when they found her."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's an extra then. It's just a tiny black domino, with a
lace frill&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A woman's, then?"</p>

<p>"Not necessarily. The men who wore fancy-fiddly costumes, like
cavaliers or troubadours, wore this sort of mask."</p>

<p>"Maybe it's young Jarvis's. He was a troubadour."</p>

<p>"All right, we'll keep all the flotsam and jetsam&mdash;there's
nothing else, but a few beads and a small, trumpery vanity
case&mdash;not a gold one.</p>

<p>"Mostly women's stuff."</p>

<p>"Yes, but men don't have many loose trifles to shed. Now, what
about this white streak on the rug? About six inches
long&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Looks like face powder&mdash;probably from that vanity
case."</p>

<p>"Maybe. Now, here's one spot of blood&mdash;poor lady. There was
little of that&mdash;it was contusion rather than abrasion, though
the skin was broken."</p>

<p>"Reconstruct, Hutchins. Can you see the murderer standing
here&mdash;or here?"</p>

<p>Dickson seriously moved from spot to spot.</p>

<p>"No," Hutchins declared positively, "he stood about here. The
other side of the table from his victim. I see them
quarreling&mdash;perhaps she was repelling his advances&mdash;and
he, in a sudden, uncontrollable fit of anger at some thing she
said, fired the thing&mdash;almost involuntarily."</p>

<p>"Yes, it must have been something like that. Now, do you suppose
it was Locke?"</p>

<p>"Who else?"</p>

<p>"Why not Charley? Orientals have strong passions."</p>

<p>"But why would a Chinese servant have anything at all to do with
a grand society lady?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, of course, but he might have. Suppose he had been
her butler&mdash;and she had unjustly accused him or discharged
him&mdash;anyway, on the other hand, what could the grand lady have
to do with an uncelebrated young artist?"</p>

<p>"Idle speculation, all of it. Let's take a look at our facts. We
have the wife of Andrew Barham murdered at a party in the studio
apartment of Thomas Locke. Deduction, they were acquainted."</p>

<p>"No; many guests brought uninvited friends."</p>

<p>"Then where is Locke? Unless he knew this woman, whether he
killed her or not, why would he disappear a few moments after the
crime?"</p>

<p>"I think he went away for some innocent reason&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Such as?"</p>

<p>"I can't think of any, I admit."</p>

<p>"No; he didn't run out to get more sugar for the lemonade. Now,
I can't figure it out exactly, but as near as I can gather, the
lady was killed at about ten or a little after. Maybe quarter
after. But, at what must have been nearly half past ten, Briggs,
the policeman on beat, saw a man who he thinks was Locke, come out
of this house, walk down the front steps, calmly but quickly, and
then walk rapidly over toward the Avenue.</p>

<p>"Briggs thought nothing of it at the time&mdash;didn't even
think of its being Locke, for he knew of the party, but he's been
ruminating since and now he's almost sure it was Locke."</p>

<p>"Look here, Dickson, these surenesses, after the incident
becomes important, are to taken with a grain of salt."</p>

<p>"I know it. If Briggs had been sure from the first&mdash;it
would be different. But when he learns that Locke is missing, it is
easy to imagine that the man he saw leave this house looked like
him. Of course, Locke wouldn't leave the house during the party,
unless it&nbsp;<i>was</i>&nbsp;because he is the criminal. But I
can't suspect him on that tale of Briggs', coming late, as it does.
Still, it's a thing to remember. What did Locke wear as a fancy
garb?"</p>

<p>"A Monk's robe, I'm told, with a deep hood or cowl."</p>

<p>"He couldn't go out in the street with that on. If he ran away
he must have left the rig in the house. Let's rake for it."</p>

<p>"Oh, set one of those chaps downstairs at the job. I'm
tired&mdash;physically&mdash;and anyway, we'll get farther by
thrashing this thing out verbally between us. Go on, you were
collecting your facts."</p>

<p>Hutchins called an assistant, and bade him search the house for
Locke's monkish garb, and then he resumed:</p>

<p>"Well, I think that constitutes my entire exhibition. Mrs.
Barham is murdered and Locke is missing. Have you anything further
to add?"</p>

<p>"Chinese Charley is missing also."</p>

<p>"Yes. Now we have nothing that can be rightly called evidence,
and very few, if any clues. I can't care much for these ripped off
spangles, and dropped gloves. The studio is full of such things. At
a masquerade, the costumes fairly rain tinsel and fringes. But I do
think, Hutchins, that this is a big case. I do think there's a lot
behind the present aspect, and it is not going to be easy to ferret
it out."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose for a minute I thought it would be?" the
detective growled. "Well, how shall we set about it?"</p>

<p>"First&mdash;and I don't mean to do it first&mdash;but of first
importance, is to locate Locke. Second, learn the details of Mrs.
Barham's past. On those two commandments hang all the law and the
prophets."</p>

<p>"And after those two trifling errands are attended to, what
next?"</p>

<p>"Don't be pettish, Hutchins. You've never had a bigger chance
for good work. Go to it. Keep your sweepings and doodads, but also
put in a lot of headwork and energetic search. As soon as possible
interview the little Dutch girl&mdash;though I don't think she had
a hand in the crime."</p>

<p>"She had her sleeve in it then&mdash;I saw a smear on it that
looked like blood."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't believe it was. More likely red rouge or
lipstick."</p>

<p>"Maybe. Anyway, I may get something about Locke from her and the
Vallon girl. They are thick with him&mdash;and Henry Post is
too."</p>

<p>"That's the dope. Then as soon as it's late enough for society
people, I suppose you'll go up to the Barhams' house."</p>

<p>"Yes; I suppose so. Yet what can he tell me? That man was
flabbergasted. There was no make-believe about his utter
astonishment at finding his wife in this house."</p>

<p>"I agree to that. Now go home and get some sleep&mdash;unless
you'd rather bunk here?"</p>

<p>"I believe I will. I'll appropriate Mr. Locke's bedroom and bath
and then if his nibs returns stealthily in the small hours, I'll be
here to receive him."</p>

<p>"Very well, I'll go home. Get around to the Vallon place as
early as they'll let you, and then make for the Barhams'."</p>

<p>Snugly ensconced in Tommy Locke's bed, Hutchins found that he
could rest but he couldn't sleep.</p>

<p>So he let his mind play with his problems, building up fantastic
air castles, in hope of striking an idea that might be really
illuminative.</p>

<p>He was strongly tempted to get up and scrape over the house
again, but, he argued, he would probably find nothing, and would
only prevent the resting of his tired nerves.</p>

<p>But he vowed a mighty vow, that he would put all his best
energies and all his most tireless and indefatigable efforts into
this thing, and improve this chance that had come to him to make
good.</p>

<p>Locke's very convenient radium clock showed Hutchins four-thirty
the last time he looked at it, and after that he fell into a deep
and exhausted slumber. The two guards, one in the studio and one in
the lower hall, dozed a little, too, though they didn't really
sleep.</p>

<p>But at six o'clock, Hutchins' eyes flew open wide, and he pulled
his wits together in an effort to decide whether he had heard
something or had dreamed it.</p>

<p>Another instant, and he sensed a movement of some sort that
suggested the near-by presence of a human being.</p>

<p>It was scarcely a sound&mdash;more like a stealthy moving thing
that was perceptible through feeling rather than the ear.</p>

<p>Silently Hutchins sat up in bed. He was wide awake, every sense
alert, and ready to spring when he deemed best.</p>

<p>He hadn't the slightest doubt that it was Locke, returning on
some necessary errand, and hoping to find his room unoccupied.</p>

<p>Then the movement came again, it became almost a sound, and in
the faint glimmer of dawn, Hutchins saw a figure coming slowly,
silently but steadily toward him as he lay in bed.</p>

<p>He waited, eyes almost closed, until the person was within arm's
reach and then jumped up and grabbed him.</p>

<p>A fearful shriek was the result, and in an instant Hutchins had
snapped on the light and discovered that he was holding the
squirming, fighting, struggling form of the Chinese boy,
Charley.</p>

<p>"You!" he exclaimed in a sudden burst of absurd disappointment
that it was not Locke.</p>

<p>At that moment the two guards came running, attracted by the
noise.</p>

<p>"Here's the Chink," Hutchins said; "take care of him, you two,
till I can get dressed. Don't hurt him."</p>

<p>Mindful of a hard day before him, Hutchins indulged in a
refreshing bath and was pleased with the quality of the absent
Locke's soap and towels.</p>

<p>He was half regretful after he had done this, for, he ruminated,
"maybe I spoiled some perfectly good evidence by messing up this
bathroom. Can't help it now, though, and anyway, the Charley thing
is here to clean up after me. Incidentally, perhaps he can rustle
some breakfast for me! It's an ill wind, etc., or do I mean, God
tempers the wind to the shorn lamb?"</p>

<p>He found that the two guards had cannily placated Charley, and
had already set him to work in the kitchen, under threat of instant
arrest if he disobeyed a single order.</p>

<p>But obeying orders was Charley's middle name, and he broke eggs
and brewed coffee skillfully and not uncheerfully.</p>

<p>"Well, youngest scion of the Ming Dynasty, you arrived on time,
didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, always at six."</p>

<p>The Chinaman who talked pidgin or not as he chose looked at him
calmly. He was intelligent and respectful, but Hutchins had planned
his own line of talk.</p>

<p>"What time did you go away last night?" he said, in a
matter-of-fact way, as if a true answer were inevitable.</p>

<p>"When the pollismans come."</p>

<p>His air was as matter of fact as Hutchins' own, and the
detective believed him&mdash;so far.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"No like. Aflaid,"</p>

<p>"So you ran away."</p>

<p>"Yes, I go home. Every night I go home."</p>

<p>"But you usually stay until Mr. Locke is ready to
retire&mdash;or at least until he dismisses you?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;usually."</p>

<p>"What time did Mr. Locke leave last night?"</p>

<p>"Maybe half-past ten&mdash;maybe."</p>

<p>"You saw him go? Ah, you let him out?"</p>

<p>"I saw him go&mdash;I no let him out."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I remember&mdash;he let himself out, of course. Was
that it?"</p>

<p>But the Chinaman had sensed something wrong, and became
secretive.</p>

<p>"I no know&mdash;I no see him."</p>

<p>"Hey there&mdash;none o' that! You said you did see him! You
want to be arrested? Shut up in big prison? Bread and water? Hey?
You tell the truth, now. What time did you see Mr. Locke go out of
this house?"</p>

<p>"Can't tell"&mdash;and Charley looked sullen. "Don't know."</p>

<p>"Well, you find out. Cudgel your memory now. Wasn't it earlier
than half past ten?"</p>

<p>"No"; with an ugly glance.</p>

<p>"All right, was it later?"</p>

<p>"No," angrily now.</p>

<p>"Then, as near as you can fix the time, Mr. Locke left this
house at about ten thirty. Alone?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"You do know! Alone?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Did he wear his&mdash;his big monk dress?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"Then you go to prison. Take him," Hutchins nodded to the
guards.</p>

<p>"Wait&mdash;wait, I tell. No, he wear regla clo'es. Even
coat."</p>

<p>"Ah, his evening clothes. That's better. What did he do with the
monk dress?"</p>

<p>"We found that, Mr. Hutchins," one of the officers said; "it was
in that junk cupboard where the painting things are."</p>

<p>"Did you put it there, Charley? Did you put it there for Mr.
Locke, so he could go away just in his evening clothes? That was
nice of you. He told you to, didn't he?"</p>

<p>But the Chinaman had returned to his overdone cooking, and
Hutchins let up on him for the moment.</p>

<p>"That's it," he said, exultantly. "Locke vamoosed, tossed his
monk's robe to the boy, and went out into the night. Took his hat
from the hat stand as he passed out&mdash;or somebody's hat.
Connivance, you see. Now this boy merely ran away from the police
because the police scared him. I'll bet he knows nothing of what
took place&mdash;and then this morning he returned at six o'clock
from force of habit.</p>

<p>"He crept softly into Locke's room to see if he were there, not
wanting to wake him. It's all fine. But look out that he doesn't
get away. They're a sly race. We'll accumulate his fine-smelling
breakfast, and then we'll see what to do with him."</p>

<p>Hutchins was in fine spirits, and asked to see the monk's
robe.</p>

<p>He gazed carefully at the long plain garment, with its attached
hood, deep and peaked.</p>

<p>"Put it away," he said, to the man, "but, stay, wait a minute,
what's that smear?"</p>

<p>The garment itself was dull brown, but on the front breast was
an almost invisible spot that might or might not be blood.</p>

<p>"Hard to tell," he concluded, after a close examination, "but
put it away very carefully. You fellows will have this place in
your keeping right along, I suppose. Well, don't let any one touch
that robe till it's tested."</p>

<p>Charley appeared at the table suddenly.</p>

<p>"Caterman here."</p>

<p>"Caterman? Oh, the caterer's man. Tell him to come in. And bring
me another cup of coffee. It's the best in the world!"</p>

<p>The Chinaman smiled. Apparently conditions were not troubling
him much.</p>

<p>The man from the caterer's came in diffidently.</p>

<p>"I suppose you want to take away your chairs and dishes," said
Hutchins, casually. "You may do so&mdash; but be careful to take
nothing but what is yours, and if you notice anything unusual or
peculiar, report it. See?"</p>

<p>The man who, was intelligent, seemed to understand.</p>

<p>"By the way," Hutchins said, "did any of your people see Mr.
Locke the master of the house&mdash;er&mdash;late last
evening?"</p>

<p>"One of our men was on the door, sir."</p>

<p>"He was! Did he see Mr. Locke go out, by any chance?"</p>

<p>"He let him out."</p>

<p>"Ah. You interest me strangely! What time was this?"</p>

<p>"About half past ten."</p>

<p>"And why is your doorman so accurate as to the time?"</p>

<p>"Because," the man looked serious, "because it was right after
that that we heard the commotion upstairs."</p>

<p>"Who do you mean by 'we'?"</p>

<p>"The waiters&mdash;and our people from Mascarelli's. We were in
the dining room and pantry, of course."</p>

<p>"Of course. And you have been talking the affair over among
yourselves?"</p>

<p>"Sure&mdash;why not?"</p>

<p>"No reason in the world. I meant, do you know all about the
doorman letting Mr. Locke out? And what do you mean by letting him
out? Couldn't he get out himself?"</p>

<p>"We had a regular man on the door to open it for the guests
entering or leaving. So when Mr. Locke wanted to leave, of course
Joe opened the door for him."</p>

<p>"And did he say anything&mdash;anything special?"</p>

<p>"He only said, 'I'll be back in a few moments.' That's all."</p>

<p>"You're sure of all this? You heard Joe tell it? If you're
sure&mdash;I don't need Joe's story&mdash;but perhaps I'd better
get it anyway."</p>

<p>"No need, sir. We all talked it over and over. Joe told his yarn
a dozen times, and every time he said that Mr. Locke just went
out&mdash;not hurried like, but as if ordinary&mdash;and he
said&mdash;'Back in a few minutes.' That's all."</p>

<p>"And it's a lot. And whatever time it was by the clock, Joe says
it was shortly before the excitement began?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, he says just that."</p>

<h2><b><a name="Chapter_6" id="Chapter_6">Chapter 6</a><br>
Pearl Jane</b>
</h2>

<p>Not&nbsp;quite content with a second-hand yarn, Hutchins walked
around by the caterer's place on his way to Miss Vallon's home.</p>

<p>He found Joe, the doorman, and asked him concerning the
matter.</p>

<p>Joe told the tale just as the other man had repeated it.</p>

<p>"Did Mr. Locke seem at all flustered or flurried, Joe?"</p>

<p>"Not at all, sir. Might have been just going of an
errand&mdash;as I thought he was. Maybe that's what he did do, and
met with some accident or foul play himself."</p>

<p>"Maybe. You noticed nothing more of special interest&mdash;in
the light of later affairs?"</p>

<p>"No, sir&mdash;that is, except this. Right after Mr. Locke went
away&mdash;well&mdash;maybe five minutes after, a lady came running
downstairs. She had on one of those fancy dresses, and a dark cloak
over it.</p>

<p>"'Let me out, please,' she says&mdash;pretty like. 'I'm late to
keep an appointment.'"</p>

<p>"What did she look like?"</p>

<p>"Lord, sir, I couldn't tell you. Those dressy ladies look all
alike to me. Well, I let her out&mdash;I thought as she didn't have
an escort, she'd have a car. But, no, she walked&mdash;not fast,
but brisk like, and went over east. I watched her till I couldn't
see her any more. Probably her appointment was near by."</p>

<p>"Probably. Then she didn't go the way Mr. Locke went?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir, just the opposite way. He went toward the
Avenue."</p>

<p>"I see. Well, very likely the lady is in no way concerned in
last night's work."</p>

<p>"That's what I think, sir. Just a casual guest&mdash;going on to
another party. That's the way they do."</p>

<p>"Who engaged you people, Joe? Mr. Locke?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. Mr. Post. He always does. Mr. Locke don't have parties
very often, leastways, not big ones&mdash;and when he does, Mr.
Post and Miss Vallon, they do all the ordering. Mr. Locke, he likes
it better that way. He's no head for such details."</p>

<p>"Do you know him?"</p>

<p>"Not so well, sir, but I've seen him. A pleasant-speaking man
to-day, and to-morrow&mdash;well, sort of absent-minded."</p>

<p>"He wasn't absent-minded when he left the house last night?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit. Bright as could be. Just, back in a minute, and a
pleasant smile, and he was off."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose, Joe, that he could have&mdash;er&mdash;you
know, committed a crime, and then gone off gay&mdash;like
that?"</p>

<p>"Well, he wasn't to say gay, sir. But&mdash;oh, well there's no
tellin' with these artist folks. They're not like real people. I
know. I've opened doors to both sorts&mdash;to all sorts&mdash;and
the people down here&mdash;they're sort of touch and go, here
to-day and gone to-morrow. I can't seem to think that Mr. Locke
would do such a thing&mdash;and I don't think he did&mdash;but if
he did&mdash;why, yes, I think he'd be quite up to skipping off
like as if nothing was the matter. And isn't the fact that he
hasn't come back, pretty good proof of his guilt?"</p>

<p>"So you suspect him, do you?"</p>

<p>"It isn't for me to suspect, sir. But if he turns out to be the
one, I shan't be overly surprised."</p>

<p>"You've no real reason to think him a criminal?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord, no, sir, not that. But when a man goes off and
doesn't come back, and in a few minutes a lady's found dead, and
nobody else on the premises so much as knows who she is&mdash;what
else is there to think?"</p>

<p>"What, indeed?" said Hutchins. "Now, just one more question, my
good man. That lady that went away soon after Mr. Locke, did more
follow her?"</p>

<p>"Not till after the alarm was given. Not till folks wanted to
get away from a house that had trouble coming to it."</p>

<p>"But you said the alarm was given almost immediately after Mr.
Locke went."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;that's so. Well, I may as well own up I can't
remember exactly. The lady I spoke of went alone; then when the
others went, they went more by twos and threes. And they went
talking excited like in whispers, and seemin' awful shocked, which
wasn't surprisin'. But the first lady, now, she couldn't have known
about it, for she was smiling and sweet."</p>

<p>"Did she have on a mask?"</p>

<p>"No, she'd taken that off."</p>

<p>"And you can't remember her dress at all?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;it was white. What I could see of it. But all the
ladies wore long, full cloaks or capes that covered up their rig.
Specially those who walked."</p>

<p>"A good many did walk?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. You see the Square people are neighborly, and most of
'em live only a few blocks off."</p>

<p>Concluding he could learn no more from this man, Hutchins went
to the task he dreaded, that of interviewing Miss Cutler.</p>

<p>He well knew Miss Vallon intended to shield the girl all she
could from the least or slightest inconvenience.</p>

<p>And sure enough, when he arrived, Miss Vallon met him in the
living room, which was the studio of her tiny apartment, with the
word that Miss Cutler was not yet awake.</p>

<p>"And she is so worn out, I want her to sleep," Kate purred on,
pleasantly, "won't I do? I can tell you all she could."</p>

<p>Hutchins came to the conclusion that directness was best with
this type of woman&mdash;so he said:</p>

<p>"Miss Vallon, you will do up to a certain pitch&mdash;and maybe
past it. But if I find it necessary to question Miss Cutler
personally let me assure you it will be far better for her to
consent to see me than to continue to refuse."</p>

<p>Kate Vallon paled a little, but she only said:</p>

<p>"Very well, question me."</p>

<p>"I come to you, because I understand you and Miss Cutler and Mr.
Post are Mr. Locke's nearest friends, in this district, at least. I
am told by the caterer's people that you ordered the supper, and
such things as that betoken intimacy. Now, Miss Vallon, do you know
where Mr. Locke is?"</p>

<p>"I have not the faintest idea."</p>

<p>Hutchins said nothing to that, but his thought was, "And you
wouldn't tell me if you had!"</p>

<p>"Do you think Miss Cutler or Mr. Post knows?"</p>

<p>"I am sure Miss Cutler does not, and I am sure Mr. Post did not
when I last saw him, which was when he brought us home last
night."</p>

<p>"Does Mr. Post propose to try to find out?"</p>

<p>"That I don't know. You would better ask him."</p>

<p>"I intend to. Now, Miss Vallon, first of all, why are you in
this distinctly antagonistic frame of mind? Don't you know that you
act as if you had something to conceal&mdash;or if there were
something to be concealed, regarding Mr. Locke? Why is that?"</p>

<p>"You're utterly absurd. As a matter of fact, I know very little
about Mr. Locke. We are all good friends, but ours is not an
intimate sort of a crowd. I know no more about his private or
personal affairs than he knows about mine. I have no idea whether
his disappearance is a purely casual one, or whether it is in any
way connected with the distressing affair of last night. Indeed,
Mr. Hutchins, I have no information that would be of the slightest
use to you."</p>

<p>Hutchins bowed slightly.</p>

<p>"Then I must ask for an interview with Miss Cutler. I am sorry
to awaken her, but the law's demands are inexorable. And she can go
to sleep again. The lassitude of the day after a party is not a
real malady. If you refuse further, you will make me think there is
some other reason&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Very well," and Kate Vallon went to fetch Pearl Jane.</p>

<p>The suspiciously quick return of the pair made Hutchins smile
inwardly at the story of the sleeping girl, but he made no allusion
to that.</p>

<p>"I don't want to worry or annoy you, Miss Cutler," Hutchins said
with almost kindness, for he saw at once she had doubtless passed a
sleepless night. "But if you will tell me your own story&mdash;tell
me all that is on your mind&mdash;it will be so much easier for
both of us, than if I have to drag it out piecemeal."</p>

<p>"I haven't any story&mdash;I haven't anything to tell," and the
girl gave him a piteous look.</p>

<p>"Let me help you," and Hutchins was gentleness itself. "When you
hid in the closet what were you afraid of?"</p>

<p>"N-nothing in especial&mdash;but all the horrid things&mdash;the
policeman, the dead woman&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Had you seen the dead woman?" Hutchins shot this out, suddenly,
and Pearl Jane gave a little scream.</p>

<p>"No, oh, no, I hadn't seen her."</p>

<p>"Yes, you had seen her. You had leaned down and looked at
her&mdash;and, in doing so you touched her&mdash;and you made a
stain of blood on the sleeve of your Dutch costume."</p>

<p>To his surprise she suddenly changed her whole attitude. She sat
up straight and seemed possessed of a new spirit of bravado.</p>

<p>"I didn't do any such thing!" she said, and Kate chimed in with,
"Of course she didn't."</p>

<p>"May I see the frock?" Hutchins asked, calmly.</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Kate, and she left the room.</p>

<p>Hutchins took quick advantage.</p>

<p>"Miss Cutler," he said, softly, "trust in me. Truly, it is the
best and wisest course. I will help you all I can&mdash;and I'm
sure you have nothing of any moment to confess."</p>

<p>"Oh, I have! I have!" she moaned, and then Kate returned, and
defiantly handed the pretty little costume to the detective.</p>

<p>Remembering just where he had seen the stain on the sleeve, he
turned to it, but there was none there.</p>

<p>"You see!" cried Kate in triumph.</p>

<p>"Yes, I see," he returned, "and so can you, the place where it
has been washed out. You can see clearly the mark made by the water
or whatever was used to cleanse it."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said Kate, airily, "that's where Miss Cutler chanced
to stain her dress while eating a little supper after we came home.
I persuaded her to try to nibble a bit of toast and drink some
chocolate, and the chocolate spattered as I poured it from the
pot."</p>

<p>Hutchins looked at her in undisguised admiration.</p>

<p>"On the spur of the moment?" he asked, frankly, "or had you
thought it up before?"</p>

<p>"The simple truth," persisted Kate, but he saw her eyelids
quiver, and he knew it was far from the simple truth.</p>

<p>He didn't know exactly what to do. He suddenly remembered that
the monk's robe had been found in that same closet, and that the
girl might have smeared her sleeve from that. For he felt sure the
dark stain on Locke's robe was blood. Did Pearl Jane know that?</p>

<p>But if Detective Hutchins' thoughts were chaotic, and his
conclusions contradictory, they were no more so than the
conflicting theories that filled the troubled brain of Andrew
Barham.</p>

<p>From the moment he stepped in his wife's car to go back to his
own home until he reached it, he was anxious and alarmed as to what
the effect of the terrible news would be on Madeleine's mother.</p>

<p>He had a strange feeling that she would think he was somehow to
blame&mdash;that he had let this terrible thing come to them. Yet
surely he had kept watch and guard over his wife as fully and
carefully as she would let him.</p>

<p>His heart was full of grief, and the very fact that he and
Madeleine had not been so congenial or happy as some married pairs,
served to accentuate rather than mitigate his sorrow. For he had
really loved his wife&mdash;loved her far more than she ever knew
or appreciated. More than she cared, probably. Yet when such a
thought came to him he put it away, it seemed a sort of
disloyalty.</p>

<p>But, he thought, as he neared home, the first thing to do was
tell Mrs. Selden. He was tempted to wait until morning, even strove
to persuade himself that it would be better for her to have her
night's sleep in peace, but he soon realized this idea was born of
his distaste for the ordeal he knew he must face.</p>

<p>So he dismissed the chauffeur, let himself in the house and went
upstairs.</p>

<p>He went to Madeleine's boudoir, and tapped softly, for he knew
Claudine would be there awaiting her mistress.</p>

<p>The maid opened the door, and stared when she saw who was
there.</p>

<p>"I will come in for a moment, Claudine," he said; "I have
something to tell you. But first, what did your mistress wear this
evening?"</p>

<p>"Madame went to a&nbsp;<i>Bal Masque</i>," came the reply. "She
wore a beautiful costume of an Oriental Princess."</p>

<p>"Where was the ball to be?"</p>

<p>"Madame did not say."</p>

<p>"Did she say what time she would return?"</p>

<p>"Only to say that she would be late, but I must sit up for her.
It is not yet late."</p>

<p>"No; but&mdash;Claudine, your mistress will never
return&mdash;she&mdash;she is dead."</p>

<p>"Monsieur! Sir! What can you mean?"</p>

<p>"What I say. Have a care, Claudine, do not break into noisy
weeping. I have all I can bear. Listen. My wife is dead&mdash;more,
we have reason to think she was killed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu!</i>&nbsp;Murder!" and the girl trembled
pitifully.</p>

<p>"Hush!" said Barham, knowing he must be stern, even cruel, if
she was to be of use to him. "Now, listen&mdash;it is not for you
to take the center of the stage. I have to tell Madame
Selden&mdash;think what that will mean. Go at once, Claudine,
awaken her, and ask her to receive me. Do not tell her what I have
told you&mdash;merely say I must see her at once. If she makes real
objection, say it is on a gravely serious matter and is
imperative."</p>

<p>And then Andrew Barham paced Madeleine's boudoir, until Claudine
returned to tell him Mrs. Selden was ready to see him.</p>

<p>He found her sitting up in a chair, robed
in&nbsp;<i>peignoir</i>&nbsp;and cap.</p>

<p>"What is it, Drew?" she asked. "Has anything happened? I'm sure
you wouldn't rout me out of bed otherwise."</p>

<p>"Yes, Mother," and Andrew Barham felt nearer her now than he
ever had before. "Yes, something has happened&mdash;and we must
bear it together, you and I. Something has happened to
Madeleine&mdash;our little Maddy."</p>

<p>"What is it? Tell me!"</p>

<p>She must have sensed it in part from his face, for her own
countenance turned ashen, and she shook like a leaf.</p>

<p>"She was hurt&mdash;" he began&mdash;"badly
hurt&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And she is dead!" the mother said; "you needn't say it, I know.
How was she hurt?"</p>

<p>Relieved at her calmness, Barham began very gently to tell her
the details, when, suddenly gleaning the whole truth, she gave a
scream and flinging out her arms, slipped down in her chair,
unconscious.</p>

<p>Hastily summoning Claudine, Barham lifted her back to her bed,
and by the use of violet salts she soon recovered her wavering
consciousness.</p>

<p>And then she became violently vituperative.</p>

<p>"My child!" she moaned, "my baby&mdash;my little Madeleine!"
Then, with a wild shriek, "Don't you sit there, sobbing. You never
loved her! You never understood her! Leave me, Drew&mdash;I can't
bear to look at you now. No, come back here&mdash;tell me
more&mdash;tell me all about my child&mdash;my baby. Where is she,
where is she, I say! Where is she now?"</p>

<p>And he told her what he had done.</p>

<p>"Sent her off alone&mdash;to a terrible place! I said you never
loved her! I knew you hated her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Listen, mother&mdash;don't misjudge me. It was
necessary&mdash;the authorities wouldn't let me bring her
home&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Selden sat straight up in bed. Still handsome, she looked
like some avenging goddess. Her white hair had become disordered,
her dark eyes shone like coals of fire, and her sharp features
seemed sharper still in her wild frenzy.</p>

<p>"The authorities! What have they to say about my child?"</p>

<p>In vain Barham tried to make her understand. He felt it would be
best to get the whole scene over at once&mdash;and perhaps firmness
was the wisest course.</p>

<p>Claudine stood by, now adjusting a pillow, now offering the
salts bottle, and now breaking down herself.</p>

<p>"Try to understand, Mother," Barham said, gently, but holding
her by both hands and gazing into her eyes. "Madeleine has been
killed&mdash;murdered. We have to do many things in that case, that
we would not in case of an ordinary death. We have&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where was she?" she said. "Where did this happen? At Emmy
Gardner's?"</p>

<p>"No; Mother, have you any idea where Madeleine started out for
to-night?"</p>

<p>"No; but she said she was going somewhere else before she went
to Emmy Gardner's."</p>

<p>"Yes, she did. She went to a house in Washington Square."</p>

<p>"Washington Square! Who in the world lives there?"</p>

<p>"A Mr. Locke. Did she ever speak to you of him?"</p>

<p>In spite of himself the man's voice trembled.</p>

<p>"No, never. Rosamond Sayre was here this evening&mdash;just
after dinner." Mrs. Selden said.</p>

<p>"Madame Sayre said she would meet Madame at Madame Gardner's at
eleven," Claudine volunteered.</p>

<p>"And what time did she leave home?" Barham asked.</p>

<p>"About nine-thirty," the maid answered.</p>

<p>The reports all tallied as to time. There could be no doubt that
Madeleine had gone to Locke's from her own home and of her own
accord. But why?&mdash;<i>why?</i>"</p>

<p>"Who is Mr. Locke?" Mrs. Selden said, quietly enough now.</p>

<p>"He's an artist. I wish, Mother, you'd try to sleep
now&mdash;may Claudine perhaps give you a little chloral? You know
you must be brave to-morrow&mdash;we have hard times before
us&mdash;you and I."</p>

<p>The man felt so drawn to her through their common tragedy that
he showed an affection he had rarely if ever shown before.</p>

<p>But it had small effect on the half-crazed woman.</p>

<p>"You and I!" she cried, with a burst of hysterical laughter.
"You pretend to weep for Madeleine&mdash;my beautiful Madeleine!
You! You ruined her whole life!"</p>

<p>"How?" cried the man, stung by this injustice.</p>

<p>"Because you wouldn't give her money! You, rolling in wealth,
denied that precious baby a few paltry hundreds&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I never did, Mother. Madeleine never asked me for a dollar and
was refused."</p>

<p>"She didn't dare ask! She was afraid of you! You cowed her
spirit&mdash;her beautiful spirit&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What did Maddy want money for&mdash;more than I allowed her?"
he asked, a strange wonder clutching at his heart.</p>

<p>"For her Bridge games&mdash;her only pleasure. She had bad luck,
poor child&mdash;she lost&mdash;oh, she lost thousands&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mother! What are you saying? Madeleine lost thousands at
Bridge!"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;time and again. I gave her all I had&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There, there, dear, don't let's talk about this now. Let us
both try to get some rest."</p>

<p>"No! I don't want to rest! I want to talk! Tell me
more&mdash;tell me all&mdash;everything&mdash;just as if I had been
there. What was this place? Was it a right place?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I'm sure they were all charming people&mdash;"</p>

<p>The man was nearly beside himself, and said what he thought most
likely to soothe her.</p>

<p>"Was it a musicale?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;"</p>

<p>But his very voice failed him, and Claudine took up the burden.
"It was a&nbsp;<i>Bal Masque</i>, Madame Selden. And Madame, she
looked so ravishing in a costume of silks and sequins and
jewels&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Selden again sat bolt upright and pointed her finger at
Barham.</p>

<p>"And you sent her&mdash;my child&mdash;to the&mdash;oh, to the
terrible funeral place, in that gewgaw costume!"</p>

<p>It was the first time Barham had realized this. It was terrible!
Madeleine in her casket, in that gaudy robe! But he had been so
engrossed in other and to him graver matters, he hadn't even
thought of that.</p>

<p>"How horrible!" Mrs. Selden broke out again. "How ghastly! You
care nothing for my sensibilities. Go&mdash;go at once, and take
proper clothing."</p>

<p>"I will, mother," the distressed man said, humbly. "What shall
it be? A little white gown?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;" and then Mrs. Selden broke down and sobbed.</p>

<p>Yet in a moment another outbreak seemed imminent, and Barham
feeling he could stand no more, and thinking he had done his duty,
rose and left the room.</p>

<p>"Do all you can for her, Claudine," he said, "and if she gets
violent, call up the doctor. I can do no more. But I will get a
gown and send down for Mrs. Barham. No, don't come, I'll find it.
Stay with Madame Selden."</p>

<p>And at last Andrew Barham closed the door upon the haven of his
own room, alone.</p>

<h2><b><a name="Chapter_7" id="Chapter_7">Chapter 7</a><br>
A Friend Indeed</b>
</h2>

<p>Andrew Barham&nbsp;sat at his breakfast table.</p>

<p>After several hours of thinking, wondering, planning and
sorrowing, he had been blessed with a short respite of fitful
slumber, and now, though still in a state of mental chaos, he was
outwardly composed.</p>

<p>He was relieved that Mother Selden had not joined him in the
breakfast room, though she had sent him some messages. It was her
custom to breakfast in bed, but he feared she would change her plan
for to-day, and when she did not, he was glad. One of his problems
was what to do about her continued presence under his roof.</p>

<p>He could not summarily dismiss Madeleine's mother, as one would
a servant, yet he couldn't face years of solitude&nbsp;<i>à
deux</i>&nbsp;with the unamiable lady. However, that was a future
consideration&mdash;there were many more pressing.</p>

<p>"Hello, Drew&mdash;here I am&mdash;I just had to come! May
I?"</p>

<p>Nick Nelson came into the room, pushing past the waitress, and
grasping Barham's hand.</p>

<p>Words of sympathy were unnecessary between these two friends,
and Barham accepted the unspoken message he read in Nelson's
eyes.</p>

<p>"All in the papers?" Barham asked. "I haven't seen them."</p>

<p>"Yes; but I suppose garbled versions. Now, Drew, I'm here to
help. Command me in any way you like. My time is all
yours&mdash;and I needn't tell you everything else I own is."</p>

<p>Nelson was a big, hearty, cheery sort, usually smiling, and the
mere sight of his grave, solemn face, gave Barham a curious feeling
as of looking at a stranger.</p>

<p>"I don't know, yet, what you can do, Nick, but I know there's a
lot to be done. Have a cup of coffee, and let's talk things
over."</p>

<p>Nelson, who was sharp-eyed, was pleased at this attitude. He had
feared a more sensitive reserve, a hesitancy on Barham's part to be
receptive or responsive.</p>

<p>"First," said Nelson, "who is this Locke?"</p>

<p>"He seems to be an artist, with a decent studio and a seemingly
proper coterie of friends. That's all I can tell you of him. The
first thing, in my mind, is to find out how Madeleine came to know
him&mdash;why she ever went there."</p>

<p>"Madeleine went her own gait&mdash;" Nelson began.</p>

<p>"I know it. But, Nick, I always knew where she was. I didn't
cotton to her card-playing cronies&mdash;but they were all right.
You know, the Gardners, the Sayres, the Thornleys&mdash;all that
bunch are, at least, of our own people&mdash;not Bohemians."</p>

<p>"Is this Washington Square place a Bohemian joint?"</p>

<p>"No, it isn't; as I saw it. I mean it isn't the Greenwich
Village crowd. Though I met only one or two, beside the police
people. But I gathered from the general atmosphere that it was the
place of a working artist rather than a&nbsp;<i>poseur</i>. Still,
I may be mistaken&mdash;and anyway, it doesn't matter. Any studio
on Washington Square seems to me a strange place to find my
wife."</p>

<p>"Did it occur to you, Drew, that she may have been&mdash;may
have died somewhere else, and been taken there?"</p>

<p>"Don't mince words, Nelson. Madeleine was murdered&mdash;the
fact is terrible enough&mdash;why balk at the word. No, your
suggestion isn't tenable. She was seen there for some time before
she was killed. I've tried and tried to think it was an
accident&mdash;but it wasn't. The doctors agree on that and, too, I
can see that it couldn't have been."</p>

<p>Barham sat back in his chair and pushed away from the table.</p>

<p>His hair gleamed golden in the morning sunlight, his heavy
eyebrows of the same color, seemed to contract into a straight line
as he gazed intently at Nelson.</p>

<p>"Nick, they say that Locke man killed her. I'm not so sure that
he did. But I want to find the murderer&mdash;that's one thing I'm
sure of. Will you help me do that?"</p>

<p>"Rather! But I'm no good as a sleuth. I'm willing
enough&mdash;and I'm shrewd, in a way&mdash;but I've none of that
detective instinct in my make-up. Now, I've heard of a
man&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, don't drag in a private detective. They're no
good&mdash;and too, the police detective on this case seems to be a
clever sort. Give him his chance. But I want to find out some
things&mdash;about&mdash;Madeleine. That's an admission, isn't it,
for a man to make, concerning his own wife! But I did a lot of
thinking last night&mdash;and, well, maybe, I didn't treat the girl
right&mdash;after all."</p>

<p>"Hush that, Drew! Since you've raised the question, let me say
once for all, you've nothing to reproach yourself for. Maddy was
beautiful, she was accomplished, and all that&mdash;but
she&mdash;she wasn't right! You did everything, and more, that
mortal man could do&mdash;but the woman was&mdash;she was
wrong."</p>

<p>"Explain yourself, please," and Andrew Barham's blue-gray eyes
took on that deeper blue that came to them in moments of extreme
anger or other strong passion.</p>

<p>"Drop that attitude, Drew," the other said, quietly. "I'll tell
you if you want me to&mdash;or, I'll not tell you. But there are
things about Madeleine that you have never known."</p>

<p>Barham's attitude changed to one of wonder.</p>

<p>"Tell me, Nick," he said, briefly.</p>

<p>"Not here&mdash;come to some quieter place."</p>

<p>But before the two men could have further talk, Detective
Hutchins was announced.</p>

<p>"Sorry to intrude," he said, politely, "but there are some
questions I have to settle at once, Mr. Barham."</p>

<p>"Very well, come into the library," and Andrew Barham introduced
Nelson, and the three sat down.</p>

<p>"To be through with this interview as quickly as possible, Mr.
Barham," Hutchins said, "I'll tell you where we stand. We, the
police, have practically only two facts to work on&mdash;Mrs.
Barham's death, and the disappearance of Mr. Locke. Anything else
we know is part and parcel of one of these two propositions. Now,
it is self-evident that you cannot tell us anything about the
whereabouts of Mr Locke. But I am obliged to ask you some questions
regarding your wife's life. I am sorry&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Hutchins," Andrew Barham said, quietly, "I will ask you to
eliminate the personal equation entirely. I know it is from
consideration of my feelings that you hesitate or apologize at
introducing these subjects, but I assure you it will make it easier
for me if you will say what is necessary, in a business-like way. I
am quite ready to tell you what I can, but let us be brief and to
the point."</p>

<p>Hutchins' respect and admiration for this man rose another
point, and he said, simply, "I understand, Mr. Barham. Now, shall I
speak before Mr. Nelson?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. I have no secrets regarding these things from
him."</p>

<p>"Then can you tell me who invited Mrs. Barham to Mr. Locke's
studio party?"</p>

<p>"That I cannot. I should be glad to learn, myself. I had no idea
she knew him, or knew any people who would be likely to attend the
affair."</p>

<p>"Yet she was there."</p>

<p>"Not only that, Mr. Hutchins, but she went there voluntarily and
from her own home. Her own maid dressed her in the Oriental
costume, and her own chauffeur drove her there at her directions.
All of this is as much a mystery to me as to you. Clear it up if
you can."</p>

<p>Though Barham's voice was steady and his manner calm, Nelson
noted the occasional clenching of his hands or biting of his lip,
as if he held himself under control with difficulty.</p>

<p>"You've asked Mrs. Selden about it?" asked Nelson.</p>

<p>"That reminds me," Hutchins put in, "I must ask to see Mrs.
Selden. Shall I interview her later, or will you send for her
now?"</p>

<p>Barham considered.</p>

<p>"As you like," he said, "but Mrs. Selden is exceedingly
nervous&mdash;even hysterical. Can you not excuse her?"</p>

<p>"No; it is imperative. And, it will save time," he glanced at
the library clock," if she will come here now."</p>

<p>"Get her, will you, Nick?" Barham said, and Nelson left the
room.</p>

<p>"Be careful with her," Barham warned Hutchins. "She may be cool
and collected, and yet, ready to fly into a passion at some simple
remark."</p>

<p>"I'll manage her," said the detective carelessly and
confidently; yet when, a moment later, Marcia Selden appeared, he
lost a little of his cocksure confidence in himself.</p>

<p>She came into the room, tall, stately, gowned in the deepest
black, and her face was like a thundercloud. She walked slowly
across the room, unheeding the men as they rose, and seated herself
in an armchair.</p>

<p>Hutchins said afterward, all he could think of was a Scripture
verse that was something like, "Terrible as an army with
banners!"</p>

<p>Nelson followed her in, and Claudine remained, uncertainly, on
the threshold.</p>

<p>"Wait outside, Claudine," Mrs. Selden said, "and close the
door."</p>

<p>"Now, sir," she turned to Hutchins, unheeding Barham's word of
introduction, "who killed my daughter?"</p>

<p>But her speech didn't frighten the detective as had the majesty
of her appearance. Indeed, to him, that question placed her at
once, as a mere foolish woman, and as such he answered her.</p>

<p>"We don't know yet, Mrs. Selden, we are endeavoring to find
out."</p>

<p>"When will you know?"</p>

<p>"That I can't say, but I am hoping that you can give us some
help in our efforts to find the criminal."</p>

<p>"You know the criminal! You know it was that artist person."</p>

<p>"Have you any reason to think that, aside from the fact that her
death occurred there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the fact of his disappearance. Why else would he run
away?"</p>

<p>"That is only negative evidence. However, it will be sifted.
Now, Mrs. Selden, can you not tell me of any friend of your
daughter's who might invite her to that party? Mr. Barham is quite
sure that her intimates are not to be found in that section of the
city."</p>

<p>"Indeed they are not! My daughter never went down there of her
own accord&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But she ordered her driver herself&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know all that&mdash;but she was forced into it. Some
one&nbsp;<i>made</i>&nbsp;her do it!"</p>

<p>"Oh, come now, mother," Barham said, looking at her curiously,
"how could that be? Who could so coerce Madeleine?"</p>

<p>"Call in that maid," said Hutchins, who was getting a little
excited.</p>

<p>"Claudine," he said to her, quickly, "when you dressed Mrs.
Barham for the masquerade, did she seem glad to be going or did she
seem to be going unwillingly?"</p>

<p>Claudine hesitated and looked from one to another.</p>

<p>"Tell the truth," said Barham, quietly, but Nelson saw him turn
a shade paler as if he feared a revelation.</p>

<p>"Then," the maid said, hesitatingly, "I can scarcely express
it&mdash;yet it was this way; as if Madame wanted to go&mdash;yet
feared it."</p>

<p>"Feared it!" exclaimed Barham.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not that&mdash;" Claudine was really trying to give
just the meaning she had in mind, "it was more as if Madame were
about to make an experiment."</p>

<p>"To go to such a place for the first time?" suggested
Nelson.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is it. And she wanted to look her very
best&mdash;and, still&mdash;she hesitated. Once or&mdash;yes,
twice&mdash;she pushed me away, and said&mdash;'I won't go! Get me
another gown.' Then in an instant she said, 'I will go! I must go!'
and she went through with it. When all arrayed, she looked so
beautiful she was much pleased, and seemed eager then to go."</p>

<p>"Inexplicable," said Nelson, "but there was surely some
influence at work, whether good or bad."</p>

<p>"Of course there was!" Mrs. Selden cried hysterically. "And I
have an idea that I know who is back of all this."</p>

<p>"You do, Mrs. Selden?" Hutchins was really startled. "Then you
must tell at once."</p>

<p>"I will," and her voice grew louder. "There he sits! Andrew
Barham! He never understood my poor daughter."</p>

<p>"Hush, hush," Nelson began, but Barham said, "Let her alone,
Nick, it's bound to come."</p>

<p>"Yes," the irate woman continued, "I don't know how he worked
it, but he had her decoyed down there and lured away to her
death&mdash;my Madeleine, my baby!"</p>

<p>"You must interpret this outbreak as you see fit, Mr. Hutchins,"
Barham said, with a weary dignity. "I assure you it is merely the
vagary of a brain almost disordered by the shock and grief of the
tragedy. Knowing Mrs. Selden as I do, it doesn't entirely surprise
me, but I will state that it is utterly untrue. I have no idea why
my wife went to Mr. Locke's last night. That is my statement."</p>

<p>Few could look at the distressed but fearless face, few could
note the straightforward, even defiant manner and not be convinced
the man spoke the truth.</p>

<p>But Hutchins was a wary sort, and he was quick to follow up any
new line.</p>

<p>He nodded sidewise to Barham, but addressed himself to Mrs.
Selden, thinking, and rightly, that any moment might bring an
outburst of hysterics and he could learn no more.</p>

<p>"Why would Mr. Barham do this, Mrs. Selden?" Hutchins asked,
making his voice as matter-of-fact as he could.</p>

<p>"Maddy was a gambler," Mrs. Selden said, looking at him out of
eyes that now stared piercingly, and again glared wildly about the
room, "a terrible gambler. Poor baby, it was the only happiness she
had. Her husband neglected her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I protest!" Nelson cried. "That is not true! The reverse is the
truth&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Be still, Nick," Barham was very white and quiet, "let her tell
what she will."</p>

<p>Something in his calm voice quelled Mrs. Selden and she suddenly
became like a whimpering child. "Well, anyway," she said, "they
didn't get on. He was good to her&mdash;yes, I must admit
that&mdash;but&mdash;oh, well, she did waste a lot of money. Poor
little Maddy, what gown did you pick out for her, Drew? That white
China crêpe?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mother," and Barham spoke as gently as if she had not
arraigned him so cruelly.</p>

<p>"And we must have flowers&mdash;lots of valley lilies&mdash;and
white lilac&mdash;Maddy loved white lilac&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mother, that will all be attended to."</p>

<p>"Attended to! How thoughtless you are of my wishes, Andrew. I
want to attend to it myself. No one but me shall pick out Maddy's
flowers&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know," Barham said, patiently, "but don't you remember,
Mother, the florist is coming here to consult you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"When? When, Drew?"</p>

<p>"This afternoon, at three o'clock. You asked me to order him to
do so, you sent me the message by Claudine this morning."</p>

<p>"So I did&mdash;when I first woke up. I dreamed about it. Well,
Drew, dear, you're a good boy. Maybe you didn't kill Maddy&mdash;I
mean, maybe&mdash;"</p>

<p>Gravely listening, and closely watching Mrs. Selden, Hutchins
slowly drew his pencil through some lines he had written.</p>

<p>"I think her conversation cannot be reported, Mr. Barham," he
said; "she is not responsible."</p>

<p>He had not meant this to be heard by the now silent woman.</p>

<p>But it was, and she turned on him in fury.</p>

<p>"Not responsible, young man! I! Marcia Selden! How dare you say
such a thing! I'll have you arrested&mdash;get out of this house
this instant! I am entirely responsible! I have more brains in a
minute than you'll have in a thousand years! I know what I'm
talking about. Indeed I do!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Mother," Barham's patience began to give way, "do stop this
tirade. Please be more quiet."</p>

<p>Again her voice rose to a shriek.</p>

<p>"Brute! Unnatural man! My child is killed, and he says, 'Be
quiet!' I won't be quiet! I will say what I think!"</p>

<p>"Then say it without me," and Barham rose and left the room.</p>

<p>"Follow him, Mr. Nelson," Hutchins said, quickly, "it may not be
a bad plan."</p>

<p>Nelson went, and the detective tried to ingratiate himself with
Marcia Selden.</p>

<p>Claudine sat beside her, trying to soothe her, but with small
success.</p>

<p>"Now, dear lady," he said, "you tell me anything you can to help
me, and then you go away and rest before the florist comes to see
you. You've a lot to attend to, with him, you know. Were you in
your daughter's confidence? Did she ever tell you about her
acquaintance with Mr. Locke?"</p>

<p>For a long moment Marcia Selden looked at him.</p>

<p>Hutchins knew that his fate was in the balance. She might
respond to his advances and give him her confidence and she might
fly into a rage at him.</p>

<p>"No," she said, at last, "she never told me of any such person.
She never mentioned such a place as a studio on Washington Square.
I don't believe she had ever been there before. And perhaps I was
too hard on Mr. Barham. He was never unkind to his wife. They were
probably as fond of each other as most married people."</p>

<p>Hutchins was amazed. Surely, this was the talk of a rational
woman.</p>

<p>"Does Mr. Barham play cards?" he asked, trying to make the
question sound casual, though it was of importance to him.</p>

<p>"Not much. He plays Bridge, but an indifferent game. My daughter
was a brilliant player&mdash;a renowned player. But she had bad
luck&mdash;always. And she lost."</p>

<p>"Large sums?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, enormous."</p>

<p>"And Mr. Barham objected?"</p>

<p>"He didn't know it. At least he didn't know how very large they
were."</p>

<p>"How did she pay them?"</p>

<p>"I gave her money frequently&mdash;then, of course, sometimes
she won&mdash;and sometimes, I think, she borrowed from her
friends."</p>

<p>"And from me," Claudine said, unable to resist the temptation to
speak. "Many times did I lend Madame the money for the gamble."</p>

<p>"Did she repay you?" asked Hutchins.</p>

<p>"Sometimes, not always."</p>

<p>"Some is still due you, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Hush, Claudine, it will be paid, as you well know. How dare you
say a word against that sainted child! My Madeleine! My baby!"</p>

<p>Hutchins had already had enough experience to know that this was
the precursor to another tantrum, and he fled the room, leaving the
now screaming woman to the ministrations of the despairing
maid.</p>

<p>"You see how matters stand, Mr. Hutchins," Barham said, as the
detective found him and Nelson in an adjoining room. "Mrs. Selden
is not demented, but she is irrational at times, mostly because of
this shock&mdash;but also owing to her naturally excitable
disposition and inflammable temper. You may make such use of her
statements as you see fit, but in justice to myself, I must ask
that you verify them by some more competent testator before you
accept them as true."</p>

<p>"I have no intention of reporting anything Mrs. Selden said,"
the detective told him. "I am convinced for myself that she cannot
control her speech when the frenzy comes upon her. Moreover, a few
moments ago, after you left the room, she greatly modified her
expressions of vituperation. Now, I am due at the inquiry to be
held in Mr. Locke's place at eleven o'clock this morning. You need
not come, Mr. Barham, but you should be represented."</p>

<p>"I will represent him," Nelson said, promptly. "I am a lawyer,
and I will do all that is necessary. Also, I will be responsible
for Mr. Barham in any and every way."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Nick&mdash;I'm glad to have you help me out like
that. Mr. Hutchins, what is this Mr. Locke like? Do you know
him?"</p>

<p>"No; nor can I seem to find any picture of him. But I'm told
that he is of what is called the artist type&mdash;long hair, big
glasses, low collar and flowing tie."</p>

<p>Nelson smiled at the graphic description. "I didn't know that
sort grew nowadays," he said, "outside the cartoons."</p>

<p>"They do in Washington Square&mdash;lots of them."</p>

<p>"Do you gather that he is a&mdash;a gentleman?" Barham
continued.</p>

<p>"I do gather that," Hutchins said, "and partly because I spent
last night&mdash;what was left of it&mdash;in his room, and made
use of his bed and bath. One can judge a man by such things, and I
gathered that he was of decent, even refined habits&mdash;yet, of
course, that does not preclude his being a criminal."</p>

<p>Hutchins spoke thoughtfully; and added, "Also, he has a jolly
good sort of servant."</p>

<p>"What sort?" said Barham.</p>

<p>"A Chinese boy; devoted to his master, neat and efficient, and
about as talkative as a steamed clam."</p>

<p>"Still, he ought to be made to tell you of Locke," Nelson
said.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but after all, it isn't so important to be told about
Locke as to find him."</p>

<p>"Telling of him may lead to finding him."</p>

<p>"It may, but I don't think the Chinese can tell anything of
importance. I'm quite sure he doesn't know where Locke is. But
we'll find him yet. That I do feel sure of."</p>

<h2><b><a name="Chapter_8" id="Chapter_8">Chapter 8</a><br>
The Public Inquiry</b>
</h2>

<p>When&nbsp;Hutchins reached the Locke apartment the inquiry was
already in progress. Doctor Babcock was conducting it, and though
an able and shrewd questioner, he was glad of Hutchins's
presence.</p>

<p>For Lieutenant Hutchins was looked upon as one of the most
far-seeing and quick-witted of the Homicide Squad of the Detective
Bureau, and Babcock wanted him to hear every word of the
evidence.</p>

<p>Not that there was much evidence. It was a baffling case.</p>

<p>Thomas Locke seemed to have vanished off the face of the earth,
and yet except for the fact of that vanishing there was no reason
to connect him in any way with the murder of Madeleine Barham.</p>

<p>No proof; indeed, no suggestion of acquaintance between the two
could be discovered.</p>

<p>The medical examiner well knew that it was not an unknown case
for a wife to have friends of whom her husband knew nothing, but
that fact couldn't prove any thing in the present instance.</p>

<p>All the guests of the night before had been allowed to go to
their homes because of the utter absence of any sort of evidence to
warrant their detention or even further questioning, except for
three friends, who were said to be Locke's intimates.</p>

<p>These three, Miss Vallon, Miss Cutler and Mr. Post, had been
summoned to the inquiry, and Rodman Jarvis, of course, was
there.</p>

<p>Nick Nelson, present in the interests of Barham, looked about
curiously.</p>

<p>The pleasant, roomy studio, with its untheatrical furnishings,
attracted him, and he marveled at the absence of the conventional
claptrap. He sat next to Jarvis, and the two struck up a passing
acquaintance.</p>

<p>Chinese Charley was interviewed first.</p>

<p>"He'll tell nothing, whether he can or not," Nelson said to his
neighbor.</p>

<p>"If he knows anything, they'll get it out of him," Jarvis
argued.</p>

<p>And they did. It wasn't very much, but by dint of threats and
hints of punishment they succeeded in getting what seemed like a
straight story from the Chinaman.</p>

<p>It was to the effect that Locke had, about half past ten, come
down the front stairs, found Charley, and given him the monk's
robe, with orders to hang it in the closet. Locke had then taken
his hat and light topcoat and had walked out of the front door, as
the caterer's doorman had told Hutchins.</p>

<p>But after that, Charley knew no more concerning the doings of
his master. He, himself, had run away home at sight of the
policeman, but next morning, from a sense of duty, or from force of
habit, had turned up at his usual hour of six o'clock.</p>

<p>"Isn't that very early?" asked Babcock. "I thought artists were
a late crowd."</p>

<p>"I have much to do," Charley returned, gravely. "I clean
all&mdash;I sweep, dust&mdash;make all pleasant. Then the
breakfast."</p>

<p>"I see. And was Mr. Locke always ready for his breakfast?"</p>

<p>"If here. Not always here."</p>

<p>"Ah, away part of the time?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Away part of the time."</p>

<p>"Where did he go?"</p>

<p>The Chinaman shrugged his shoulders, with a mere "No," but no
words could have expressed a more utter absence of information on
that subject.</p>

<p>A few further questions and he was set aside as a hopeless
source of enlightenment.</p>

<p>Rodman Jarvis was called next, and he also knew but little. His
acquaintance with Locke dated perhaps from six months back. He knew
him in a social and casual way, but not at all intimately or
confidentially. He himself was a lawyer, but he had artistic
leanings and in his leisure hours preferred to consort with
painters or art students rather than learned members of his own
profession.</p>

<p>He said there were perhaps a dozen or so who met occasionally
for a social evening or afternoon, but the occasions were not very
frequent, and they rarely saw each other in the intervals.</p>

<p>His estimate of Locke was all to the good, though avowedly
superficial. He said Locke was something of a dreamer, rather
intellectual, a fair artist, and a good pal. He was more inclined
to listen than to talk, Jarvis said, when the crowd held their
pow-wows, but when he did speak, he usually said something worth
listening to. Oh, not highbrow, or erudite, but original and
interesting.</p>

<p>All of which put the absent Locke in a pleasant light, and gave
no impression of a sinister character.</p>

<p>But Babcock sighed, as he realized that this, after all, meant
very little. He asked Henry Post for further description of the
missing man.</p>

<p>"Locke is a good sort," Post declared. "But I know little about
him. He kept to himself&mdash;as we most of us do, down here. We
are not inquisitive about our neighbors, so it is only as a fellow
artist that I can tell you much about him. He is a chap who enjoys
himself wherever he is. Who is ready to take his part and do his
share always. But I've never known him to talk about himself or to
draw attention to himself&mdash;except as it might follow a
discussion of his work. He is an earnest and a painstaking painter,
though as yet he has not made a name for himself in the Art world.
Perhaps once a week, a few of us congregate here and jabber on art
topics. A party, such as was held last night, is most unusual for
Locke to give though he often has smaller gatherings. He goes away
a great deal&mdash;I don't know where, but I fancy off on sketching
tours&mdash;or perhaps to visit friends. I have often telephoned
him here and received no answer. But that is the way with most of
us down here. We are a lawless lot, so far as the laws of
convention are concerned."</p>

<p>"Then you know nothing, Mr. Post, concerning Mr. Locke's family,
relatives or more intimate friends?"</p>

<p>"Nothing at all."</p>

<p>"And you have no idea where he is at this moment?"</p>

<p>"Not the slightest."</p>

<p>Both Jarvis and Nick Nelson watched Post carefully as he made
this last statement, but neither could detect by so much as the
quiver of an eyelash that the man was telling other than the exact
truth. Indeed, his whole manner and attitude was frank and
straightforward, and Nelson, who was a good reader of character,
felt that Post knew no more of Locke than he had declared.</p>

<p>Miss Vallon was questioned next.</p>

<p>Her story was much the same as Henry Post's.</p>

<p>She gave the impression that she and Miss Cutler, Mr. Post and
Mr. Locke formed a sort of informal quartette. That they dined
together perhaps once a fortnight or so, and afterward spent the
evening in Locke's studio, discussing the subjects in which they
were all interested. Miss Vallon was already an illustrator of
books or magazines. Miss Cutler was still studying&mdash;while the
two men painted pictures without any definite idea of their
ultimate bestowal.</p>

<p>"Did you never hear Mr. Locke mention a relative or a near
friend outside your circle?" Babcock asked.</p>

<p>"No, not that I remember," Miss Vallon replied, thoughtfully. "I
may have heard him speak of his mother once or twice, but only in a
reminiscent way; I don't know whether she is living or not."</p>

<p>So Miss Vallon's knowledge was of no more help than Post's.</p>

<p>The examiner turned hopefully to Pearl Jane Cutler.</p>

<p>That young woman had recovered her normal poise, and faced the
listening group calmly, even coolly.</p>

<p>Hutchins watched her intently, for he had left her rather
abruptly that morning earlier, finding his time was so short.</p>

<p>"Can you tell us, Miss Cutler, any more concerning the family or
friends of Mr. Locke, than the other witnesses have?"</p>

<p>"No," she said, quietly, shaking her bobbed hair and raising her
wistful eyes to the face of the questioner.</p>

<p>Her intent regard disconcerted him a trifle, but he went on:</p>

<p>"You know him, casually, as Miss Vallon does?"</p>

<p>"Precisely in the same way," she replied. "I have never seen Mr.
Locke except in Miss Vallon's company. We live in the same
house."</p>

<p>"Then I will ask you concerning another phase of the matter.
Will you tell me of your finding Mrs. Barham's body on the
smoking-room floor?"</p>

<p>"Finding&mdash;What! I&mdash;I didn't find&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Be careful, Miss Cutler&mdash;you will only make trouble for
yourself by withholding the truth. You were seen&mdash;<i>seen</i>,
bending down over the body of Mrs. Barham! Do you still deny
it?"</p>

<p>Partly to intimidate his witness, and partly to hide his own
disinclination to pursue this subject, Babcock frowned, sternly and
spoke with severity.</p>

<p>But to his surprise, Pearl Jane threw up her head defiantly, and
said: "Who saw me?"</p>

<p>"I see no reason to refuse an answer to that question," Babcock
returned; "it was the Chinaman, Charley."</p>

<p>"Where was he?" said Pearl Jane, speaking almost
conversationally and looking sharply at the Chinese boy.</p>

<p>Hutchins regarded the girl with surprise. What had so changed
her attitude? Also, what revelations were about to be made?</p>

<p>"Where were you, Charley?" and Babcock turned to the
servant.</p>

<p>"Light behind Missee Cutler," he replied, stolidly staring
straight ahead of him.</p>

<p>"And where was Miss Cutler?"</p>

<p>"In smokee loom&mdash;lookee allee time at dead lady."</p>

<p>It was characteristic of the boy to use the broken English in
time of embarrassment or emotion&mdash;and to use almost perfect
English when calm and unperturbed.</p>

<p>"Was Miss Cutler alone in that room?"</p>

<p>"Gentleman at door. Lookee out on studio."</p>

<p>"I will tell," said Pearl Jane, speaking clearly and steadily.
"I was in the small hall back of the smoking room&mdash;where the
back stairs come up."</p>

<p>"What were you doing there?"</p>

<p>"Only fixing my cap which had become disarranged&mdash;and
assuring myself that my costume was all in order. There is a mirror
there and a light."</p>

<p>"Go on."</p>

<p>"And I heard an exclamation or two in the den&mdash;that is, the
smoking room. The door was almost closed. I pushed it open, and
looked in. I saw some one on the floor. Impelled partly by
curiosity, partly by a desire to be of assistance, I went to
look&mdash;yes, I did bend over the body&mdash;I did, I dare say,
get a smear of blood on my sleeve&mdash;" the girl shuddered, "but
that's the whole truth. I ran away at once, when I saw what it
was."</p>

<p>"Why did you run away?"</p>

<p>"Fright, horror, shock. I have never seen anything like that
before and I scarcely knew what I was doing. I ran and hid in a
closet&mdash;for no reason but that I was beside myself with fear
and terror."</p>

<p>"Who was in the den?"</p>

<p>"I saw no one but some man, who was looking out of the door into
the studio."</p>

<p>"You touched nothing in the room? Moved nothing?"</p>

<p>"N-no," but Pearl Jane dropped her eyes, and Hutchins thought he
noted a little gasp of alarm. Yet, who could connect this child
with crime? Moreover, her story tallied with Charley's. He said he
saw her bend over the body. She admitted it. Henderson was in the
room at that time&mdash;at the studio door calling for some one to
find a doctor.</p>

<p>Doubtless the girl did exactly as she recounted, doubt less,
too, the Chinaman's story was true and he did see her as he
described.</p>

<p>There was, so far, not the slightest reason to suspect either of
these two of any connection whatever with the crime itself.</p>

<p>To the question, "Who did it?" there could be no convincing
answer until Thomas Locke could be found and made to speak for
himself.</p>

<p>However, there was one point on which Hutchins felt he must have
light.</p>

<p>"Miss Cutler," he said, easily, "are you and Mr. Locke
especially good friends?"</p>

<p>The girl's cheeks took on a deeper color, but she said coldly,
"Will you state what you mean by that term?"</p>

<p>"Whew!" Hutchins thought to himself. "What has come over her?
She's been coached by somebody&mdash;and a mighty good job, at
that."</p>

<p>Aloud, he said, "I will&mdash;since you ask it. I mean, is there
any romantic attachment between you?"</p>

<p>"No," she replied, and her air was almost judicial; "no, not
that. We are pals&mdash;good chums&mdash;fellow-workers&mdash;that
is all."</p>

<p>Except for the sudden blush the question had called up, the girl
seemed entirely unmoved.</p>

<p>But Hutchins said to himself, "She'll bear watching. She has
turned from a hysterical baby to a self-composed young woman
altogether too quickly! I believe she has had some word from Locke,
somehow. Of course he will telephone to some one, as soon as he can
manage it. Unless he is really the criminal and has vamoosed for
good and all."</p>

<p>"Well," Nick Nelson said to his new friend, Jarvis, after
hearing some more of this futile querying, "I don't see as anybody
can get anywhere. It isn't the Examiner's fault&mdash;nor yet
Hutchins'&mdash;but they have nothing to work on. So far as we can
gather, Locke is a proper, well-behaved citizen&mdash;but he mayn't
be at all. Now, he's got to be found! Hang it all, man, nobody can
drop out of existence like that!"</p>

<p>"Oh, it isn't so difficult to hide," Jarvis reflected. "I know
Tommy, and I like him&mdash;in this casual way we all know
him&mdash;but if he is a deep-dyed villain, and he may be for all I
know, he could easily keep himself hidden&mdash;even if he stayed
right here in New York. Why, if he were to cut his hair short and
raise a mustache, say, and lose his big glasses&mdash;his own
mother wouldn't know him. He is in no way a distinguished looking
man&mdash;I mean, he isn't distinctive looking."</p>

<p>"Even as you and I," Nelson said smiling.</p>

<p>Jarvis looked at him.</p>

<p>"Either you or I would find it harder to disguise ourselves than
Locke," he said; "we're of stronger peculiarities."</p>

<p>"But why do you think Locke is under necessity of such
procedure?" Nelson asked; "do you assume that he is responsible for
the crime?"</p>

<p>"I don't quite say that," Jarvis returned, slowly, "but I don't
see any other way to look."</p>

<p>"What about that girl?" Nelson asked; "the little, pretty
one?"</p>

<p>"Pearl Jane? Oh, she's an innocent baby. I know her. She did get
into the room&mdash;and she doubtless felt curiosity&mdash;or maybe
wanted to be helpful, thinking some one had fainted. She's all
right&mdash;that child, but she&nbsp;<i>is</i>&nbsp;in love with
Tommy."</p>

<p>"And he with her?"</p>

<p>"That I don't know. Maybe. But there's nothing positive about
it. I'm romantic&mdash;and I've thought lately I sensed a dawning
romance there; but maybe not&mdash;maybe not."</p>

<p>And now the authorities were looking over the trinkets found at
or near the scene of the crime.</p>

<p>No one present claimed the glove or the fan or the mask or the
vanity case&mdash;but the examiner was not surprised.</p>

<p>They were all of small value, and to claim them might lay an
innocent guest open to annoying questions that would mean nothing
after all.</p>

<p>The only thing that the detective had any hope of using was the
glove. He felt vaguely that much could be learned from a woman's
glove, but though he had examined it carefully inside and out, he
could read nothing from it. To him it was a glove&mdash;a long,
white kid glove&mdash;that was all.</p>

<p>The beads, the spangles, too, all merely meant the presence of
various guests who had worn them&mdash;they were in no way
indicative.</p>

<p>Hairpins&mdash;what could be read from them?</p>

<p>Had any of the other women a chance to enter and lean over the
body?</p>

<p>Not that Babcock knew of.</p>

<p>Then there was the foolish little tinsel dagger, there was a
man's glove, several cigarette stubs&mdash;oh, pshaw, none of these
things could mean anything. The thing to do was to find Thomas
Locke, and it must be done.</p>

<p>Doctor Babcock voiced this as his ultimate conclusion. He
declared that, in his opinion this consideration and discussion of
hairpins and men's gloves got them nowhere. Now, he would only ask
questions that definitely concerned the personality, the character,
and the possible whereabouts of Locke himself. And he asked that if
anybody knew anything&mdash;anything at all, bearing on those
things, he would immediately disclose such knowledge.</p>

<p>There was a slight stir in the back part of the room, and a
feminine voice said, "I may be able to tell something of
interest."</p>

<p>The speaker was a quiet looking little woman, who gave her name
as Eleanor Goodwin. She stated that she lived in the house next
door, and that being often lonely, she frequently amused herself
looking out of her windows at her neighbors.</p>

<p>"And you did this last evening?" Babcock asked hopefully.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;all during the arrival of the guests and off and on
afterward."</p>

<p>"You saw anything of interest?"</p>

<p>"It all interested me," said Miss Goodwin, who seemed to be a
pathetic creature, "because I have little excitement in my own
life. I watched the guests arrive, because I caught many a glimpse
of the beautiful or funny costumes, and it gave me a glimpse of gay
life."</p>

<p>"And later," Babcock did not wish to hurry her unduly, but he
did want to know if she had seen anything of any importance.</p>

<p>"Well, later, I should say about ten-thirty, I saw Mr. Locke
come out and come down the steps."</p>

<p>"You know him?"</p>

<p>"By sight, oh, yes. I do not know him to speak to. Well, he went
over west, toward Fifth Avenue, and he got on to a Fifth Avenue
bus."</p>

<p>"You're sure of this?"</p>

<p>"Positive."</p>

<p>"Inside, or on top?"</p>

<p>"He went up on top. I saw him ascend the stairway as the bus
moved on."</p>

<p>"Thank you. Miss Goodwin, this may be helpful. Now did you see
anything after that?"</p>

<p>"Yes, very soon after I saw a lady come out and go away all
alone. I thought it strange she had no escort and I watched
her."</p>

<p>"Did she get on a bus?"</p>

<p>"No; she went in the other direction&mdash;over east. I lost
sight of her at once."</p>

<p>"Can you describe her at all?"</p>

<p>"Only that she was not very tall&mdash;a little plump&mdash;no,
not that, but not so overly slender as some&mdash;and she had on a
dark cape. However, it blew apart a little and I could almost
discern her costume."</p>

<p>"What was it?" and more than one person present listened
intently for the answer.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't want to swear to this, but I rather fancy she
represented 'Winter.' Her dress was white and sparkling, and her
slippers were white with spangles like hoarfrost. And on her head
was a sort of glistening headdress that sparkled, too."</p>

<p>"Yes?" and the examiner turned quickly to Kate Vallon. "Do you
know of any one who came dressed as 'Winter'?" he said, hoping to
catch her off her guard.</p>

<p>But Miss Vallon was seemingly quite ready to answer.</p>

<p>"There were three or four 'Winters' here," she said,
thoughtfully. "Two of them I know, but I don't think they went home
early. I can give you their names."</p>

<p>Babcock was a bit regretful at her willingness, for he feared it
meant merely a case of a "Winter" who went early to keep another
engagement. Also, this tallied with the doorman's story of the lady
in white who left, frankly saying she was "going on" to keep
another appointment.</p>

<p>He sighed, thanked Miss Goodwin again, assured her that he would
call on her if he felt she could tell him anything more, and then
returned to his statement that Mr. Locke must be found.</p>

<p>He declared that there was no conclusion possible but that Mrs.
Barham had come to her death by the blow of the bronze book-end, at
the hands of some person or persons unknown. But that evidence
pointed strongly to the supposition that Mr. Locke was implicated
in the matter.</p>

<p>He said further that there &quot;was a stain on the monk's robe
worn by Mr. Locke, which had been practically proved to be a stain
of blood.</p>

<p>He therefore urged every possible effort on the part of any one
desirous of furthering the ends of justice to do anything in his
power to find the missing man, and stated that the insistent
efforts of the police would be made toward that end.</p>

<p>He ordered a continuous guarding of the premises by the police,
for he felt it quite likely that Mr. Locke would try to effect a
clandestine entrance to his home on some errand.</p>

<p>And he warned his hearers that it was possible that Mr. Locke
had already disguised himself, and that when or if found, he might
be a decidedly different looking man.</p>

<p>He said further that he was empowered by Mr. Barham, through his
friend and counsel, Mr. Nelson, then present, to offer a reward for
any information that would lead to the discovery and capture of the
murderer.</p>

<p>He said the details of this reward were not yet ready for the
public, but he mentioned it in hope of bringing out some otherwise
unavailable data. And, he added that though all present were now
dismissed, yet some would be questioned again, and he asked them to
be in readiness at any time for such interviews.</p>

<h2><b><a name="Chapter_9" id="Chapter_9">Chapter 9</a><br>
Mrs. Gardner's Story</b>
</h2>

<p>The&nbsp;few days intervening between the death of Madeleine
Barham and her funeral were as a nightmare of horrors to her
husband. Yet, there was so much to be done that only he could do,
and so many things to be attended to that only he could attend to,
that, after all, the time passed quickly.</p>

<p>Nelson brought him the report of what had been done at the
police inquiry, and Barham listened gravely to his recital.</p>

<p>"I've so many things on my mind, Nick," he said, "that I can't
remember all you're telling me. But that doesn't matter, for I sent
a stenographer down there, and I shall have the full account
whenever I get ready to read it over. But you give me the salient
points. I suppose they've no word from or of Mr. Locke?"</p>

<p>"No, they haven't, and that of course is not surprising. Of
course, Drew, the artist is either responsible for the
deed&mdash;or he knows who is. That much goes without saying."</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose that is true," Barham returned. But his
attention was distracted, as if his mind were elsewhere.</p>

<p>"Don't think I'm not listening," he said quickly, as he saw
Nelson's recognition of his wandering mind, "but, oh, Nick, if you
knew all I have to contend with. I wouldn't mention it to any one
but you, but Mother Selden is driving me crazy."</p>

<p>"She can do it! You'll have to make some other arrangement for
her, Drew."</p>

<p>"I can't, Nick. She goes off in tantrums if I make the merest
hint or suggestion of any change. Oh, well, that's in the future.
Just now, it's the funeral arrangements. Poor Maddy, if I could
only have a simple service and just a few of our nearest
friends&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Selden objects to that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, rather! She insists on enough pomp and ceremony for a Queen
of England, at least. And, I'm glad for her to have her
way&mdash;it's her own daughter, you know, but she changes all the
details every few hours. Now she's all for a vested choir, and when
that is arranged, she decides on a solo by some prima donna
instead."</p>

<p>"Can't you put her and her arrangements in the hands of some one
else?"</p>

<p>"I tried that. I sent for her sister, Mrs. Beresford. And when
she came, they quarreled the first thing, and her sister went off
in a huff. Claudine's a good girl, she helps out all she can. Oh,
Lord, Nick, don't think I'm complaining&mdash;but I have to think
quickly to keep up with Mrs. Selden's vagaries."</p>

<p>"Good old Drew," and Nelson's sympathy was ready. "Suppose I
have a go at her. Maybe I can drive some sense into her head."</p>

<p>"All right, try it. You've done about everything else for me.
Now, as to this investigation. I want it pushed, and all that, but
I can't do anything myself until after the funeral."</p>

<p>"Nor are you expected to. And, too, there's nothing you or I can
do. It's up to the authorities. I think they feel that Locke is or
will be in touch with that Miss Cutler."</p>

<p>"Who's she?" Barham looked up with a show of interest.</p>

<p>"She's a neighbor and a friend of Locke's. Rather an intimate
friend, I judge. Also, and this is strange, she was seen bending
over Maddy's body before it was found by Mr. Post&mdash;no, it was
after that&mdash;but before the police saw it."</p>

<p>"Well, does that mean anything?"</p>

<p>"I think not. The girl was frank enough about it. Yet, there are
some who are ready to think she is implicated&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In the crime? A girl?"</p>

<p>"Well, the Chinese servant saw her stooping there&mdash;but
you'll read it all on your stenographer's notes. That was a good
idea, Drew, to get a complete record, like that."</p>

<p>"Yes, I have to have it&mdash;if I'm to help in the
investigation. I can't be going down there&mdash;I haven't the
time, nor the inclination. But, Nick, I do want to find out who
killed Maddy&mdash;and yet&mdash;do you suppose it will bring about
unpleasant revelations&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," and Nelson looked at him steadily, "yes, Drew, I think it
will."</p>

<p>"Then shall we hush it all up?"</p>

<p>"You can't. It's not in your hands. Now, take my advice, old
man; after the funeral, put Mrs. Selden away some place&mdash;you
can send her off on a visit&mdash;and then let me help you cook up
some plan by which you can cover up Maddy's&mdash;shortcomings.
There's a lot you ought to know, well, never mind it now&mdash;but
when the time comes, we'll work it out together."</p>

<p>"Very well," and Barham looked stern. "I am ready to do anything
to shield my wife's name or reputation. I can't take up the matter
now, I've pressing engagements&mdash;but I will do just as you
advise, Nick, except as to sending Mrs. Selden away. That I can't
do, unless she's willing to go. If you can persuade her&mdash;for
Heaven's sake, do!"</p>

<p>Nelson went off, and Barham fell into one of the brown studies
which were frequent with him of late.</p>

<p>And not the least of his quandaries was the fact that people
were acting queer. His own most intimate friends stood by him
loyally. Men called or wrote or telephoned with sincere offers of
help, sympathy and understanding.</p>

<p>But Madeleine's friends were aloof. Only a few of the women had
called on Mrs. Selden, only a few had sent notes or cards to
him.</p>

<p>He knew, he realized that there was something for him to learn
about Maddy&mdash;something derogatory, perhaps disgraceful, but
from a strange feeling or fear he shrank from knowing it&mdash;at
least, until after her funeral.</p>

<p>He wanted to take his last look at that beautiful face with only
sorrow in his heart, not shame&mdash;if shame must come.</p>

<p>Poor Madeleine. He thought of her only tenderly. He forgot all
the unpleasant things she had said to him, he forgot all her
sarcasms and insults, and there had been many of late. He felt that
perhaps he had been more to blame than he realized.</p>

<p>He had not been blameless, that he knew. But, then&mdash;and
always at that point thoughts came crowding that he could not
stand, and he would rise and go about some other business, in an
effort to distract his mind.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gardner had written him a short, conventional note of
condolence. She had said that she couldn't bear to talk about it,
and hoped he would understand. He did.</p>

<p>Rosamond Sayre telephoned to say that she was too upset and
overcome even to write. Perhaps after a long time she could see
him, but not at present.</p>

<p>"Why do they think I want to see them?" Barham wondered. Just
because they had been his wife's friends was no reason to his mind
that they should meet and discuss the dreadful affair.</p>

<p>One woman gave him an inkling of the situation.</p>

<p>She was a very undesirable type, to his mind, but he remembered
that Maddy had resented his criticism of her. Her name was Gibbs,
and from her he received a short, even curt note, that she extended
her sympathy, and trusted that when the time came for him to settle
up his wife's estate, he would remember that she was among the
creditors.</p>

<p>"I suppose poor Maddy owed her a few dollars at Bridge," he
thought. "I wish I had made more inquiries as to the poor child's
finances. I thought I gave her enough."</p>

<p>And then, with one of those strange perversities of which human
nature is capable, he felt a sudden wave of relief that she was
gone.</p>

<p>He was shocked, horrified, ashamed of&mdash;this&mdash;but there
were times when it came over him that he had achieved
freedom&mdash;by a fearful means, truly&mdash;but freedom.</p>

<p>He hadn't time to analyze this thought, but he had time to be
ashamed of it, and it was with real dismay that he took himself to
task for such an impulse, and hastily set about doing all he could
to make amends by offering honor to her memory.</p>

<p>But if Mrs. Gardner was unwilling to see or talk to Andrew
Barham regarding his dead wife, she was not allowed to hesitate
when the detective from the Police Bureau called upon her.</p>

<p>She promptly refused to see him, which refusal was as promptly
set aside and she was advised to make an appearance.</p>

<p>"What is it you want with me?" she asked in a supercilious way
as she swept into the drawing room and confronted Hutchins with a
reproving stare.</p>

<p>"I must ask you some questions, madam, and it is necessary that
you answer to the best of your knowledge and belief."</p>

<p>As is often the case with those unfamiliar with police
procedure, any phrase of the law carries a certain amount of
awe-inspiring command and impressed also by Hutchins' air of
authority, Mrs. Gardner came down a little from her heights of
inaccessibility.</p>

<p>"The questions regard a certain side of Mrs. Barham's nature,
which, I have reason to believe was more familiar to you than to
her husband," Hutchins began, and it pleased him to be a bit
intimate, a bit confidential in his manner.</p>

<p>His quick intuition had told him this was a better way to get at
this woman than by mere insistence. And the result proved he was
right.</p>

<p>"Yes," and her lips curved into a cruel smile, "we women friends
of Mrs. Barham know a lot about her that her husband does not dream
of."</p>

<p>"Regarding her Bridge games," suggested Hutchins.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;that is, the extent of them. Mr. Barham knew, of
course, that she played&mdash;lots&mdash;but he didn't know, I'm
sure, to what lengths she went to get the money to pay her
debts."</p>

<p>Hutchins hated his task. He had many ungrateful duties to
perform in his detective work, but the one that always most
thoroughly revolted him was when he found it necessary to get
damaging information against a woman from another woman. There was
no escape, however, so he merely said:</p>

<p>"How did she get it?"</p>

<p>And the story that Mrs. Gardner told him was so incredible, so
different from what he had expected, so much worse than the worst
he had feared, that Detective Hutchins listened, heartsick and
overwhelmed with sorrow for the dead woman and sympathy for her
surviving husband.</p>

<p>"You expected her here to play Bridge the night she died, then,
Mrs. Gardner, did you not?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, she was due here at eleven."</p>

<p>"And when she failed to come, did you telephone or make any
inquiry?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no; Madeleine was a law unto herself. If she chose to break
an engagement at the last minute, she did so without a word. And it
didn't matter that way. It isn't a club, or anything like that. We
just have a friendly game now and then, and if any one doesn't
come, there are plenty of others."</p>

<p>"You think Mrs. Barham expected to come on here after she had
made a stay at the Locke party?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, I suppose so. Mrs. Sayre said that Mrs. Barham told
her she would be here at eleven or shortly after. But, as I say, no
one ever depended on Mrs. Barham's word in such matters. She came
and went, when and where she would."</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear her speak of Mr. Locke?"</p>

<p>"Never! It's the queerest thing. I should as soon have thought
of hearing she had gone to the Battery as to Washington Square! I
never knew her to go any place south of Fiftieth Street before! To
a party, I mean. Who is the man?"</p>

<p>"An artist&mdash;apparently a gentleman."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I don't suppose he killed her."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Why would he&mdash;when he doesn't know her?"</p>

<p>"You're not sure he didn't know her."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I am. I knew all Maddy's friends. He wasn't a rich
man?"</p>

<p>"No, I think not."</p>

<p>"Well, that wouldn't matter, Maddy never got money from men. But
I'm positive if she had known an artist in Washington Square we
would have known of it. It could only have been as a joke&mdash;her
going there, I mean. Somebody must have dared
her&mdash;or&mdash;oh, I can't think of any reason! It is utterly
inexplicable to think of Madeleine Barham going there&mdash;alone!
If she had asked some of us to go&mdash;as a lark, I could have
understood. But to go alone&mdash;no, I can't think of any
reason&mdash;not of any reason whatever. Can you?"</p>

<p>Hutchins looked at her. She was a good-looking woman, not
handsome but well groomed and well made up. She was capable and
efficient, he saw, and of the type that has what has been called
generalship. He could well imagine her sponsoring successful Bridge
games, and he could also picture her as having small sympathy with
the unfortunate ones whose luck went against them.</p>

<p>However, he felt that he could learn no more from her concerning
Mrs. Barham, and too, he felt he had learned quite enough. So,
without further ado, he took his leave.</p>

<p>A confab with Inspector Dickson took place soon after, and the
two men agreed that if the mystery was to be cleared up it would be
done through investigations starting at the Barham end and not from
the Locke house.</p>

<p>"She's the one to run down," Dickson said, though Hutchins' more
sensitive nature winced at this way of putting it. "The wrong
begins with her&mdash;wherever it leads to. Maybe Locke is entirely
innocent. Maybe he's shielding somebody&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The Cutler girl," suggested Hutchins.</p>

<p>"I don't know that Locke was interested in that child," the
inspector said, meditatively. "I hope he is, because that might
help us get a line on him. If he's in love with her, he'll
communicate with her, sure as shooting. But, as I see it, she's a
hero worshiper and he's her hero. Which is a very different
matter."</p>

<p>"But she must be kept in view," Hutchins persisted.</p>

<p>"Keep her, then. I incline more to the idea that Locke is
somehow mixed up with Mrs, Barham's affairs. It may be
indirectly&mdash;but she never went to that party without some big
vital reason for going.</p>

<p>"You see, all her relatives, all her friends are dumfounded with
amazement at her being there at all. Now, if it had been some
foolish escapade, they would have known of it&mdash;or, say, have
known of her predilection for that sort of thing. Instead of which,
they're all open-mouthed with surprise at her going. Now, add the
fact that she dressed for it with greatest care and even
expense&mdash;that Oriental rig cost a pretty penny!&mdash;and you
must come to the conclusion that it was a big occasion for her. It
meant a lot to her&mdash;whatever the lot was."</p>

<p>"Looks that way."</p>

<p>"Also, from your own story, she hesitated, even as she was
getting ready. Her maid says she almost gave up the project. But
she didn't give it up&mdash;she carried it through. Common sense
must tell us that she didn't expect to meet her death
there&mdash;but she did expect great things of some sort. There's
no other way to dope it out."</p>

<p>Hutchins agreed to that, and went away to think it over.</p>

<p>Moreover, he wanted to give the rooms another look, with the
purpose of finding something of Mrs. Barham's, of indicative value.
Perhaps she had left some papers&mdash;notes&mdash;no, she wouldn't
do that. Well, any way, he went down to the studio.</p>

<p>He was met by a very much disgusted caretaker and guard whom
Dickson had stationed there for the day.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Glenn?" Hutchins asked, smiling at the
chagrined one.</p>

<p>"Foiled!" the other wailed. "Foiled! and by the Chink!"</p>

<p>"Chinese Charley? What's he done? Vamoosed?"</p>

<p>"No; he's here. Charley, come in here, and tell Mr. Hutchins
that yarn."</p>

<p>Charley entered, silent-footed, calm, meekly respectful. Had it
not been for a gleam in the Chinaman's eye, Hutchins would have
thought Glenn was imagining things.</p>

<p>"It was a while ago," Glenn burst forth, "and I was sitting
around, when I heard Charley answer the telephone. Always
heretofore, he's done that and then turned the thing over to
me.</p>

<p>"This time I heard him say, 'Yes, sir,' and 'No, sir,' and then
he hung up&mdash;and&mdash;guess who had been talking to him?"</p>

<p>"Who, Charley?" said Hutchins.</p>

<p>"Misser Locke," said the Oriental, imperturbably.</p>

<p>"Mr. Locke! What did he say?"</p>

<p>"Said Charley pay bills. Little small bills&mdash;papers, milk,
so so. Says he will pay big bills. Says 'good-by, Charley, maybe
never come back. Good-by, Charley.' So I say, good-by.
Dassall."</p>

<p>"'Dassall,' is it?" cried Hutchins, "well, that's just about
enough! Don't look so done up, Glenn. What difference would it have
made if you had been on the wire?"</p>

<p>"We could have traced the message&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You can do that, anyway, but it won't do a speck of good. Of
course, he telephoned from some big pay station&mdash;Grand Central
or some such place. Or from some corner drug store. And before you
can do anything, he's gone and mingled with the crowd! No, Glenn,
all you could have done would have been to have made a fool of
yourself over the telephone, begging him to tell you where he was!
But, by Jinks, it shows he's a cute one!"</p>

<p>"Oh, he's cute enough. But I don't see such special shrewdness
in telling Charley to pay the bills. Looks like bravado to
me&mdash;unless it's a game to get us to leave the place here."</p>

<p>"No; I don't see it that way. I think he did it entirely to set
Charley's mind at rest. Also, I think he told the truth about not
coming back. I doubt very much if we ever set eyes on Mr. Thomas
Locke again, unless we go out and fetch him in, sorely against his
will."</p>

<p>"Then the game is up," and Glenn looked utterly disgusted.</p>

<p>"Maybe and maybe not. Now, Charley, you slyboots, when Mr. Locke
tells you to pay off the bills and close up accounts generally,
where do you get the money, eh?"</p>

<p>A threatening look from Hutchins' eyes made the Chinaman revise
his quite apparent intention not to tell.</p>

<p>"I have the money already," he said, with his sullen
hauteur.</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"At my home. Misser Locke, he gimme much
money&mdash;ahead&mdash;I use it till all gone&mdash;then more
come."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see. He gives you a sum of cash for petty expenses."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;that's what he say&mdash;pettys."</p>

<p>"And you have enough&mdash;and a bit left over, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes"; was the grave reply. "Enough and the bit. And my wages
for next month."</p>

<p>"Ah, very good. The small expense money, your wages a month
ahead in lieu of notice. All in case our friend disappears suddenly
or unexpectedly. Very good&mdash;ve-ry good! So, Glenn, we may
deduce, I think, that friend Locke was not altogether unaware of
the possibility of his going off&mdash;and did go off. And we must
think that when he said, so pleasantly to the door man, 'Back in a
minute,' that he had no intention of coming back in a thousand
years!"</p>

<p>"Then he is the murderer?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we can't go so fast as that&mdash;but he must be in on the
game somehow. Maybe there's a lot more to this than we thought at
first."</p>

<p>"A gang?"</p>

<p>"No, idiot, not that! At least, I can't see that element in it.
But Locke was&mdash;oh, can't you see Locke
was&mdash;<i>is</i>&nbsp;something more than a mere artist?"</p>

<p>"No, I can't see it. But that doesn't matter. He won't be back
here, whatever he is. Probably he's on the rolling deep by this
time."</p>

<p>"Probably. Now, you continue to hold the fort here&mdash;and
incidentally keep an eye on that slant-eyed innocent, and I've
another errand."</p>

<p>Straight to Kate Vallon's the detective went, and learned that
Miss Cutler had returned to her own roof-tree.</p>

<p>As this was only a pair of rooms, above those of Miss Vallon's
own, Hutchins skipped up there and demanded admittance.</p>

<p>The girl who opened the door to him looked very different from
the scared, forlorn young woman whom he had previously interviewed,
and also from the girl who had testified at the inquiry.</p>

<p>She was, though not exactly smiling, at least in a satisfied,
contented frame of mind, and Hutchins, though scarcely invited,
went in and sat down in her tiny studio.</p>

<p>"Miss Cutler," he said, in that kindly way of his, "give me just
a moment, without making a fuss about it, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Surely," she said, and sat quietly down opposite him</p>

<p>Her fair hair, not curly, but with a wave in it, shook as she
raised her eyes to his, expectantly.</p>

<p>"Go ahead," she said, demurely, and he could have sworn she was
secretly laughing at him.</p>

<p>Like a flash the truth dawned in him.</p>

<p>"Pearl Jane Cutler," he said, and his voice was impressive in
its earnestness, "I know why you've bucked up! I know what has
happened to you!"</p>

<p>"What?" she said, a little taken aback at his speech. "I don't
know what you mean."</p>

<p>"I do. I mean this." He leaned forward a little to whisper:</p>

<p>"You've had a telephone message from Thomas Locke!"</p>

<p>Pearl Jane went white.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what do you mean?" she cried; "how&mdash;how
ridiculous!"</p>

<p>"Ridiculous, if you like, but the truth. Now, then, what did he
say?"</p>

<p>"I don't see how I can answer that, for I don't admit the truth
of your&mdash;your guess."</p>

<p>"But it isn't a guess&mdash;it's a certainty. I know it. Nothing
short of that would have given you this cocksure
attitude&mdash;this little secret Bluebird of Happiness smile in
the midst of all the doubt and uncertainty you are still
experiencing! Come, little one, tell me all about it."</p>

<p>"No, I won't do it. You've no right to ask. Good-by, Mr.
Hutchins," and with a graceful little bow, she rose, flew into the
adjoining bedroom and locked the door. Nor would she respond to any
further summons.</p>

Barham Learns The Truth</b>
</h2>

<p>Perhaps&nbsp;most people will agree that the dreariest
experience they have ever known has been the returning to their
homes after a funeral has been held there.</p>

<p>No matter how much some kind friend stays behind to rearrange
the furniture and restore things to their natural and normal
aspect, the house looks different&mdash;the place seems empty.</p>

<p>After Madeleine's funeral, Andrew Barham came into his house,
accompanied by Mrs. Selden and several friends or relatives from
out of town.</p>

<p>Barham would have willingly given a goodly sum could he have
gone off by himself to his own rooms, but that was not to be
thought of. He knew he was obliged to stay&mdash;to hear his
mother-in-law and her guests mull over the funeral, as if it had
been a social function. To discuss the flowers, the music, the
people present, and every detail, down to the very appearance of
the dead Madeleine.</p>

<p>These things having been worn threadbare by discussion, Marcia
Selden next invited attention to herself and her lonely and forlorn
life as it must be henceforward.</p>

<p>"You still have me, Mother," Barham said, kindly, as she
bewailed her utter isolation. "And I shall always do my best to
make you happy."</p>

<p>"Happy! As if I could ever be happy again, without my dear
Madeleine. But I'm an old woman&mdash;I probably shall not trouble
anybody for long."</p>

<p>A new black-bordered handkerchief was somewhat ostentatiously
flaunted and several feminine voices murmured polite denials of the
last statement.</p>

<p>"Yes," went on Mrs. Selden, who was thoroughly enjoying her
martyr role, "I shall soon follow my darling to the land
beyond."</p>

<p>"Well, meantime, Mother," Barham tried to turn the trend of
conversation to a pleasanter theme, "I shall do all I can to help
you bear your loss&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You don't care that our Maddy is gone forever! You don't
care&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now, Marcia, stop that," her sister remonstrated. "It's unfair
to Andrew. He and Maddy were all right&mdash;a whole lot happier
together than you and your husband ever were!"</p>

<p>"Sarah, you hush! I won't listen to such slander! Andrew, will
you put Sarah out of the house?"</p>

<p>"Oh, come, now, Mother, we don't want Sarah to go until after
dinner, anyway."</p>

<p>"Dinner! I'd like to know who could eat dinner. No one but me
really mourns our darling."</p>

<p>"Yes, we do, Marcia," her sister said, "but these things have to
be borne. I lost my dear daughter, too, you know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, you, Sarah! You have no heart. Now, I'm a sensitive nature,
an affectionate nature&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are, Mother," Andrew said, sincerely. "But let us try to
bear our sorrow bravely and help one another&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Andrew, you make me sick! You and your preaching! Pity your
weren't a minister! Claudine, take me to my room. I must be
alone."</p>

<p>"She'll stay alone about five minutes," Mrs. Beresford said, as
Marcia went away with the long-suffering Claudine. "What are you
going to do, Andrew?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, Sarah. I am more than willing to do my duty by
Madeleine's mother&mdash;but, you see how impossible she is.
Nothing I say or do pleases her, though I honestly try. Of course,
I can't send her away, nor can I persuade her to go away. But I
don't see how I can live with her. It was easier when Maddy was
here, but now&mdash;well, I shall do whatever she wants."</p>

<p>"She wants just to stay here and ballyrag the life out of you,"
said Marcia Selden's sister, with true insight.</p>

<p>"Then she'll have to do that."</p>

<p>"And you'll stand it?"</p>

<p>"It isn't 'standing it,' Sarah. It's simply doing my duty, as I
see it, by my wife's mother. But I shall most certainly reserve the
privilege of going away as frequently as I like, for as long as I
like. The house and servants will be at her disposal, but I
couldn't bear to be here all the time."</p>

<p>"Of course you couldn't, Andrew. You're quite justified in going
off all you choose. You might take a trip to Europe."</p>

<p>"I might go to Kamchatka! But I'm not deciding on anything at
present. You must know, Sarah, there's a lot yet to be done in
connection with&mdash;with Maddy's death."</p>

<p>"Oh, that&mdash;yes. Of course, that artist person killed her.
Can't they get hold of him?"</p>

<p>"Apparently not."</p>

<p>"But you don't have to mix up with it, do you, Andrew? I should
think you'd rather never know who did it, than to dig into what may
be a horrid&mdash;scandal&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What do you know about Maddy's secrets, Sarah?"</p>

<p>"Don't you ask me, Drew. If you want to know anything&mdash;go
to her friends&mdash;they'll be ready enough to tell you."</p>

<p>Andrew Barham went off to his own rooms to think it all out.</p>

<p>He had a small library of his own, quite apart from the great
book-lined place Madeleine called the Library, and here he went and
locked himself in, bidding his servants refuse him to all
comers.</p>

<p>What should he do&mdash;what could he do, regarding several
great and important issues.</p>

<p>Perhaps the first was his mother-in-law.</p>

<p>But that he soon settled. He would let her be the unquestioned
head of the house, so far as management and home rule were
concerned.</p>

<p>Then, if her irritable temper and unpleasant disposition made
him too uncomfortable, he would go away either permanently or for
long temporary journeys. It was a little hard to be pushed out of
his own home, but his loyalty to his dead wife and his sense of
duty to her mother made no other plans possible.</p>

<p>Next&mdash;he must clear up this business of Maddy's wrong
doing. He didn't know exactly what it was that people meant by
their veiled innuendoes, but he proposed to find out.</p>

<p>Then there was that matter of the Thomas Locke studio to be
taken up. What he should do regarding that, he hadn't decided. It
would take a good bit of thinking.</p>

<p>He wondered if the police would ever track down Locke. If the
artist would ever be brought to book and asked concerning his
acquaintance with the wife of Andrew Barham. And if so, he wondered
what Locke would say.</p>

<p>As Madeleine had said, Drew was always wondering.</p>

<p>And he sat now, in deep thought, his mind racing from Marcia
Selden to Thomas Locke: from Madeleine to&mdash;well, to himself,
Andrew Barham&mdash;who, after all, was the biggest factor in his
wonderings.</p>

<p>Finally, he picked up the telephone and called Nick Nelson, who
got around to him in the shortest possible time.</p>

<p>"Well," Barham said, after they had discussed matters of lesser
moment, "now, out with it, Nick, all about Maddy. Tell me the
worst. As you know, very frequently other people know more about a
man's wife than he knows himself."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you, Drew," Nelson said, gravely, "because you ought
to know. To begin with, Maddy played Bridge for far higher stakes
than you ever dreamed she did. She would lose hundreds, sometimes
thousands, in an evening."</p>

<p>"Maddy! Thousands!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps not often thousands, but almost always hundreds. She
was what they call born to bad luck&mdash;always held miserable
hands&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, come now, Nick, hands even up in the long run."</p>

<p>"Not always. Not with some people. But, anyway, Maddy was an
erratic player, and a wild one.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;If she
won a pile, she'd raise the stakes and lose it all on a final hand,
or something like that. She had all the impulses of a born
gambler&mdash;she must have had a gambling ancestor&mdash;and yet,
she always paid."</p>

<p>"How could she?"</p>

<p>"That's just it. She borrowed at first, Drew, from all her
friends. Her funny code of ethics let her owe a loan, but not a
card debt."</p>

<p>"She wasn't unique in that respect."</p>

<p>"No; well, when she could borrow no more, when she had exhausted
her mother's generosity&mdash;and purse, probably&mdash;she
resorted to&mdash;I can't say it, but she knew secrets about her
woman friends that she threatened to tell unless they paid
her."</p>

<p>"Blackmail!" and Andrew Barham gasped in horror.</p>

<p>"You needn't use the word. It seems Maddy was just gay and
laughing about it. She'd run in to see a friend, she'd hint of
something she knew&mdash;and then she'd ask for a loan of a few
hundreds&mdash;or more, according to the importance of the
secret."</p>

<p>"How did she learn these things?"</p>

<p>"Oh, every woman knows her neighbors' secrets&mdash;and they
often hold them over each other's heads, as a rod in pickle. But
they rarely get money on them&mdash;they'd be afraid."</p>

<p>"Maddy knew no such thing as fear."</p>

<p>"No. But she didn't realize that what she was doing was really a
crime. Well, then, maybe instead of paying her, some woman would
tell a bit of scandal about some other woman&mdash;that would give
Maddy a fresh start. Any way&mdash;that's the way things were."</p>

<p>"How did you learn it all?"</p>

<p>"Emmy Gardner told me. She came to me in real distress, fearing
Maddy would get into trouble. Emmy asked me to come to you about
it&mdash;but I didn't think it was my business to do so. I didn't
know whether Emmy was actuated by real concern for Maddy, as she
pretended, or whether in it was but malicious revenge on her own
part."</p>

<p>"Good old Nick, for telling me now. The next thing is to keep it
secret. Can that be done?"</p>

<p>"From whom?"</p>

<p>"From everybody who doesn't already know it. But, primarily,
from Mrs. Selden. I hope she'll never find it out. She idolized the
child, and it would grieve her so deeply."</p>

<p>"We can probably keep it from her&mdash;unless some busybody
tattles."</p>

<p>"Claudine knows?"</p>

<p>"I've been told that Maddy used her schemes on
Claudine&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"So Emmy said; but the details don't matter so much. Drew. You
can fix Claudine more easily than any one else."</p>

<p>"This explains a horrible note I got from a Mrs.
Gibbs&mdash;saying she is a creditor of Maddy's."</p>

<p>"Well, ask her for a statement. Those women will be glad to keep
still for fear something might come out about themselves. What I'm
worried about is this murder trial."</p>

<p>"Trial? How can there be a trial with no one to try?"</p>

<p>"I mean the murder inquiry. The plans of the police include only
two main issues; to find Locke and to learn all about Madeleine's
past."</p>

<p>"Why the latter?"</p>

<p>"They think it will give them a line on the motive for the
murder, and perhaps a hint as to the murderer."</p>

<p>"Wasn't it the artist?"</p>

<p>"Maybe and maybe not. I'm interested in that chap. Drew. Do you
know, after the murder&mdash;I mean, supposing for the moment that
he was the criminal&mdash;after the deed, he calmly walked
downstairs, gave his masquerade costume to his servant, put on his
hat, and walked out of the front door, saying to the doorman he'd
be back in a few moments! Did you ever hear of such colossal
nerve?"</p>

<p>"Never! How could he? Perhaps he didn't do it, after all."</p>

<p>"And then&mdash;he went out to Fifth Avenue, and climbed up to
the top of a bus and went off."</p>

<p>"How do they know all this?"</p>

<p>"It seems somebody saw him&mdash;some woman who lives next door,
I believe, and she was watching the revelers that night."</p>

<p>"And they've never seen or heard from him since?"</p>

<p>"I believe not&mdash;unless since I've seen the people down
there."</p>

<p>"You speak as if you knew them."</p>

<p>"No, but I saw several at the inquiry, and they're not bad at
all."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by not bad? I don't suppose they're
Hottentots."</p>

<p>"No; but they seem really interesting. Seem to have
more&mdash;personality, more brains, than some of our own
crowd."</p>

<p>"They wouldn't have to be overburdened at that."</p>

<p>"I know it. And they say&mdash;that is, Mr. Jarvis told me, that
Locke is a very worth-while chap."</p>

<p>"Not a heavy villain, then?"</p>

<p>"No; sort of a dreamer, and rather intellectual. Says he's a
good pal&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Look here, Nick," Barham interrupted him, "if Locke didn't kill
Maddy, who did? Could it have been any one that is mixed up in this
other matter? This blackmail&mdash;yes, I will use the word. I
never mince phraseology! My wife did blackmail her
friends&mdash;and in so far as I can, I'm going to make good her
debts and hush up the whole matter. I am responsible for everything
Maddy did&mdash;just so far as I can be responsible. Now here's my
point. If it could be that somebody who had been her victim is at
the bottom of this murder business&mdash;then I don't want it found
out. See? I'd rather Maddy's murderer should go unpunished than
that Madeleine's name should be dragged through a trial and all
that, whereby her life secrets must be laid bare."</p>

<p>"I see," and Nelson thought deeply. "But, Drew, it is
impossible, as I see it, with the murder occurring down there, as
it did, there should be any connection between it and the Bridge
business. No, it couldn't be. The more I think it over, the more I
think there was some mistake. I mean Maddy was thought to be some
one else&mdash;the blow was intended for another woman."</p>

<p>"I hadn't thought of that. It might be," and Barham looked
hopeful. "It would be awful enough, but I'd liefer that, Nick, than
to know that somebody really wanted Maddy's life."</p>

<p>"Well, the thing to do is to get Locke. Then, if he's the good
sort that Jarvis thinks him, and if he didn't do it, he can
doubtless help us a whole lot."</p>

<p>"But if he didn't do it, why is he hiding?"</p>

<p>"There you go again&mdash;round the circle! I don't know, I'm
sure&mdash;but there could be reasons. Say he's innocent, but
there's circumstantial evidence against him. Say he's innocent, but
he's shielding somebody else. Say he met with foul play
himself."</p>

<p>Barham nodded. "Ingenious but not very plausible. However, I
doubt if he'll ever be found. And, in that case, they'll drop the
whole matter, won't they?"</p>

<p>"Not so long as they can think of some other way to look. That
Hutchins is an alert sort, and Dickson is a smart man. Also,
they're interested. It's an unusual case&mdash;and a picturesque
case. Forgive me, Drew, but you're so sensible, I'm sure you can
see for yourself, that a mystery culminating in the death of a
society belle, is more intriguing than an ordinary case of murder.
Then there is Pearl Jane."</p>

<p>Barham looked up. "Who's she?"</p>

<p>"She's the Miss Cutler I spoke to you about. Did you ever hear
such a name? Pearl Jane! Well, it seems she was found bending over
the body and there was blood on her sleeve&mdash;also there was
blood on Locke's sleeve&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Locke's sleeve! Why, you haven't told me half! Locke's
sleeve!"</p>

<p>"I mean the sleeve of the costume he wore at the ball. The
monk's robe&mdash;not his own coat. You see, he flung the robe to
the Chinese servant as he left, and they afterward found a smear of
blood on the front of it."</p>

<p>"What do the Square people think about their fellow artist? Do
they suspect him?"</p>

<p>"They seem not to know much about him. They seem not to know
much about one another. As Jarvis says, they keep pretty much to
themselves and when they get together for an occasional hobnob,
they just talk shop."</p>

<p>"I see." Barham didn't appear deeply interested.</p>

<p>"And then, too, it seems this Locke is in the habit of going off
on sketching trips or something and staying for days at a
time."</p>

<p>"I suppose all that's in my stenographer's report&mdash;I've not
had time to read it yet. Now, Nick, as to hushing up this miserable
business of Maddy's. Shall I go to see the women, and beg or bribe
them to keep still about it?"</p>

<p>"Can't I go for you&mdash;I hate to have you subjected
to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't care what I'm subjected to&mdash;and, of course, you
understand, it's for her sake&mdash;hers and her mother's. I could
bear it, if I had to, the nine days' wonder and all that&mdash;but
I can't have my dead wife's name held up to scorn if I can prevent
it by any possible means. Any suggestions, old chap?"</p>

<p>Nelson looked at the man before him. Barham's fine face was set
in that firm way his friends knew so well. Not so much stubbornness
as bulldog determination and perseverance. Nelson knew that Andrew
would move heaven and earth so far as he was able, to save his
wife's reputation.</p>

<p>And it would be a terrible thing to have such a stigma on her
memory. It would have been bad enough had the story been made
public while she was alive, but to be disclosed after her death,
and to fall heavily on the already overburdened soul of Andrew
Barham, would, Nelson felt, be almost too much for the man.</p>

<p>Yet Barham's face seemed to indicate that he yet hoped to cope
with this trouble. It seemed to gleam with a will power that would
find some way to meet the enemy, to brave the impending disaster,
to conquer the danger.</p>

<p>His strong white teeth were set together with a certain
forcefulness of his lower jaw, that betokened to Nelson's keen eye
not only a decision but a desperate will to make good that
decision.</p>

<p>"No positive suggestions, Drew," Nelson said, in answer to his
query; "merely a negative suggestion not to go ahead faster than
need be. It's not at all certain that those women will
tell&mdash;anything. More likely, they won't. Why would they?
Everything they say against Maddy would implicate themselves."</p>

<p>"But others&mdash;those who know about it&mdash;yet are not
deeply involved&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, give them the benefit of the doubt. I don't believe they
would tell just to make trouble&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know them better than you do, Nick. I've heard Maddy and her
mother talk gossip until my hair fairly stood on end, at the
tables, of woman's inhumanity to woman. Yet, your advice is good in
the main. I'll go slowly, but I'll find out and pay such debts as
that the Gibbs woman speaks of; and I'll call on Emmy Gardner and
Rosamond Sayre&mdash;they were Maddy's nearest friends, and see
what they can do to help me."</p>

<p>"And ask them to try to keep the whole matter from Mrs.
Selden."</p>

<p>"Yes; now, the thing is, the police. Do you suppose they've any
inkling of this thing as yet?"</p>

<p>"Can't say. All I know is, they're trying to probe into Maddy's
secrets, and&mdash;it's a house of cards."</p>

<p>"Yes; in more senses than one!" and Barham smiled ruefully at
his melancholy joke. "Well, I can't sit still&mdash;I chafe at
restraint or inaction. Let's call up that Hutchins and ask him. You
do it."</p>

<p>Not anxious for the job, but ready to help his friend, Nick
Nelson called up the detective.</p>

<p>Hutchins didn't know Nelson was at Barham's house, and was asked
to speak freely.</p>

<p>"Well, yes," he said, as Nick intimated his interest. "I did get
a line on that matter. It seems the lady was&mdash;well, she was
pretty rash in the measures she took to&mdash;to replenish her
exchequer! I'd rather not say these things over the
telephone&mdash;I'd rather not say them at all&mdash;but as Mr.
Barham's counsel, you've a right to know&mdash;yes, Mr. Nelson, I
did find out some things, and when you want to see me, I'll come
and talk to you about 'em."</p>

<p>"Tell him to come to-morrow," Andrew directed, as, with his hand
over the transmitter. Nelson reported. "At your place."</p>

<p>So Nelson asked the detective to come to see him next
day&mdash;and, incidentally asked him to keep the matter to
himself, at least until they could confer over it.</p>

<p>"Never fear! I won't say a word, till I have to. It knocked me
fair between the eyes! I never heard of such a thing before. No
wonder what happened, did happen!"</p>

<p>Nelson hung up the receiver, and turned to Barham with a
troubled face. He repeated his whole conversation with Hutchins,
and said:</p>

<p>"I begin to think, Drew, that it&nbsp;<i>was</i>&nbsp;something
to do with all that, that brought about Maddy's fate."</p>

<p>"But how,&nbsp;<i>how</i>, Nick, could any of our crowd be mixed
up with that painter? You don't think he was a gambler, do
you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord, no. Jarvis says he doesn't think Locke knows one card
from another. Those people never play cards."</p>

<p>"Then how, or why, would any of that lot have anything against
Maddy?"</p>

<p>"I can't see that they could&mdash;but some one else might have
planned to meet her there."</p>

<p>"Who knew she was going? Why did she go? How did she know of the
place? Why&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let up on that, Drew. We know she&nbsp;<i>did</i>&nbsp;go
there, willingly, and purposely."</p>

At The Studio</b>
</h2>

<p>After&nbsp;Nelson had gone home, Barham sent for Claudine.</p>

<p>"How is Mrs. Selden?" he asked first.</p>

<p>"She's a little calmer, sir. But now and then she has a
spell&mdash;oh, a spell! Half hysterics, half grief. And&mdash;I'm
sorry, Mr. Barham, but I can't stay on."</p>

<p>"What, Claudine, you would desert at this awful crisis?"</p>

<p>"I should never have left Madame Barham, I loved her. But Madame
Selden&mdash;I do not love."</p>

<p>"But stay for a time, Claudine, for my sake. What could I do
with Madame Selden, without you? She wouldn't take kindly to a new
maid, I'm sure. Stay a month longer, Claudine, at double wages,
will you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Monsieur, I'll do that. Don't think me mercenary, but, I
want to save up the money for&mdash;for&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know, Claudine, you're to be married. Now, tell me, did my
wife owe you money&mdash;aside from your wages?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Monsieur," Claudine said, after a slight hesitation.</p>

<p>"How much?"</p>

<p>"Five hundred dollars."</p>

<p>"Whew! Where did you ever get so much?"</p>

<p>"It was my savings. Madame said if I would lend them for a
little bit, she would return it with a large fee&mdash;bonus."</p>

<p>"You will be paid, don't worry. Claudine, did she say anything
else? Did she ever say that if you didn't lend her what she wanted,
she&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, Monsieur." The maid spoke very simply. "She did. I
understand&mdash;I knew it was a wrong&mdash;but what could I do?
She knew something&mdash;ah, it was the tiniest
peccadillo&mdash;but it was my Carl. He&mdash;he&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind, Claudine, I don't want the details. Now, if I pay
you double what Madame owed you, and double wages, will you stay
with Madame Selden for a time&mdash;say, until your marriage, and
also&mdash;say no word to any one of&mdash;of Madame Barham's
affairs?"</p>

<p>"I will&mdash;yes, Monsieur, I will."</p>

<p>"Very well. Now, one thing more, Claudine. Who knew that Madame
Barham was going to a fancy dress party that night?"</p>

<p>"Nobody&mdash;not even Madame Selden. Ah, yes, Madame Sayre came
over&mdash;but for a moment, while I was dressing Madame, and
perhaps she knew; I don't know as to that. When Madame Sayre came,
my Madame bade me leave the room."</p>

<p>"I see. Very well, Claudine, you may go. Remember all I have
said."</p>

<p>Alone again, Barham gave himself up to thought once more. The
man did little else but think these times. He had canceled his
business engagements, he read not at all, he refused himself to all
but the most insistent callers, and though kind and deferential to
his mother-in-law, he saw as little of her as possible.</p>

<p>Marcia Selden forgave him this, for she was now deeply engrossed
in going over her daughter's possessions. Barham had given her all
of Madeleine's personal belongings, even her jewels, and it was no
inconsiderable gift. He had recommended that some souvenirs be
presented to friends, but this was merely suggestion, all decisions
were to be Mrs. Selden's own.</p>

<p>She was like a child with a new toy, and kept Claudine busy
making frequently revised lists of the beneficiaries.</p>

<p>It was a troublesome process, for no sooner did Marcia Selden
decide on a gift, than immediately the thing took on a new value in
her eyes, and she wanted to keep it for herself.</p>

<p>Barham, discovering all this, thanked his lucky stars that he
had chanced to provide her with such an absorbing occupation, as it
left him more time to himself&mdash;more time to think.</p>

<p>After hearing of Rosamond Sayre's call on Madeleine the night of
the masquerade, he determined to see her, for there might be some
bit of information to be gleaned from her.</p>

<p>The appointment to meet the detective at Nelson's was not until
four o'clock, so he telephoned Rosamond to ask for an interview
before that.</p>

<p>She graciously consented to see him, which surprised him a
little, as her note to him had been really a formal expression of
sympathy.</p>

<p>As he neared her house, however, he found himself dreading the
call he had come to make.</p>

<p>Yet, when they met, Rosamond's manner put him quite at his ease,
and he was glad he had come.</p>

<p>"You dear man," she said, holding out both hands. "I'm glad to
see you&mdash;do sit down. I've wanted to tell you in person how
sorry I feel for you, and how I wish I could do something to
help."</p>

<p>"No, Rosamond&mdash;there's nothing any one can do to help. I'm
grateful for sympathy, of course&mdash;but&mdash;the truth is,
nothing helps. The awfulness of the whole thing is beyond all help.
Now, let's be frank. I've come to ask you a straightforward
question. You played Bridge a lot with Maddy, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"All the time, practically."</p>

<p>"Did she&mdash;did she ever borrow money from you?"</p>

<p>"All the time&mdash;practically."</p>

<p>"Pay it back?"</p>

<p>"Not always&mdash;sometimes."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;Rosamond, you've no idea how hard it is for me to say
this&mdash;but I must&mdash;if you didn't lend it&mdash;did she
ever threaten&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Sayre gave a broken little laugh.</p>

<p>"Of course she did, Andrew. She used to threaten all of us. You
see, Maddy played in horrible luck, and she always wanted to
recoup. But, good gracious, man, don't take it so to heart! That
was nothing, that she should say she'd tell our little secrets if
we didn't lend her a hundred or two. Why so upset over it?"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but, Rosamond, it isn't so trifling a matter as you
say. There's&mdash;there's a pretty bad name goes with that sort of
thing."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, don't use it in connection with Maddy. Forget it,
Drew, nobody is going to hold it up against her. Especially
now&mdash;the poor girl is gone. Have you any&mdash;any
idea&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who killed her? No, not the slightest. And that's another
thing, Rose. Claudine says you were over at the house that night,
and up in Maddy's room while she dressed. Did she tell you where
she was going?"</p>

<p>"I was only there for a minute&mdash;and&mdash;well, I may as
well tell you, she called me over to ask me for some money."</p>

<p>"She did! And you let her have it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, that is, I agreed to take it to Emmy Gardner's for
her. I did so&mdash;but the poor girl never came to get it."</p>

<p>Barham mused. "What did you think that night, when she failed to
come?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;oh, I didn't think much about it. Maddy always did as
she liked. Harrison went with me, and we spoke of Madeleine's
absence, but we didn't think of it seriously at all."</p>

<p>"No, I suppose not. Didn't she tell you, Rose, that she planned
to go to the Locke place before she went to Emmy's?"</p>

<p>The man looked at her earnestly, as if much depended on her
answer.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Sayre said, "No, I don't think she did. No, I remember
now&mdash;she said she was going on an errand first, but she didn't
say where."</p>

<p>"And didn't she have on that fancy dress?"</p>

<p>"No; she only had a kimono&mdash;a mere dressing gown."</p>

<p>"And you came right home, from our house&mdash;and you went
right to the Gardners'? Forgive me if I seem inquisitive&mdash;I've
a notion in my head."</p>

<p>"I came home, and dressed," Mrs. Sayre said, striving to
remember. "Then I went down to my dressmaker's for a few minutes
for an important fitting, and then I came back and picked up
Harrison and we went to Emmy's."</p>

<p>"What time did you get there?"</p>

<p>"A little after eleven&mdash;I remember we were the last to
arrive. Why all the catechism, Drew?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," and his brows came together in perplexity. "I just
want to find somebody to whom Madeleine mentioned that artist chap.
How did she come to go there?"</p>

<p>"Can't you imagine?" and pretty Mrs. Sayre wrinkled her own
brows in similar puzzlement.</p>

<p>"No, I simply cannot. I never supposed she knew such
people."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by such people?"</p>

<p>"People outside her own circle or circumstances."</p>

<p>"Well, apparently she did. What are you going to do, Drew, as to
finding out&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The truth? I'm not obliged to do anything, Rose, the police
have it in charge. And to tell you the truth, I believe I'd rather
never know the murderer than to have Madeleine's past dragged out
to the light and all this miserable Bridge business made
public."</p>

<p>"I don't blame you!" and Mrs. Sayre nodded her head,
emphatically. "I should think you'd very much rather have the whole
affair hushed up and utterly forgotten. Do have it that
way&mdash;Drew, all Maddy's friends would prefer it, I know."</p>

<p>"It isn't up to me to decide," Barham said, with a sigh, and
soon thereafter he took his leave.</p>

<p>"I still can't find out where Madeleine heard of Locke," he
mused, as he went on to Nelson's office. "I can't seem to find out
anything! Well, there's one thing I am sure of!" and by that time
he was at the door.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Barham," Hutchins said, "your reward offer has borne
fruit already."</p>

<p>"What, you've found Locke?" and Barham showed real interest.</p>

<p>"Not quite, but a man has put in an appearance who claims to be
Tommy Locke's brother."</p>

<p>"Has he a brother?"</p>

<p>"According to this chap he has. But between you and me, I ha'e
ma doots. You see, any one can lay claim to the relationship and,
since Locke isn't here to pass on it, who's to prove or disprove
it?"</p>

<p>"Can't you wait a bit, and see if Locke turns up?"</p>

<p>"Just what we're going to do. Now, Mr. Nelson, suppose you tell
Mr. Barham your plan."</p>

<p>"Why, Drew, I've been thinking that I might go down to the Locke
place and rake over everything. I know the detectives have done it,
but I think I might find some clue they overlooked."</p>

<p>Barham gave a slight smile. "I remember hearing a man of your
stamp say, not long ago, that he had no detective instinct."</p>

<p>"That's just it," cried Nelson, triumphantly, "I believe a man
with common sense and a good pair of eyes in his head might find
out more than one of these transcendent sleuths."</p>

<p>"It doesn't sound much to me&mdash;but if you're anxious to go,
go ahead. What, exactly, are you going to look for?
Footprints?"</p>

<p>"No." Nelson refused to smile. "No, but I believe in among
Locke's letters or papers&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He hasn't any," said Hutchins.</p>

<p>"Well, that's suspicious in and of itself. If that man tore up
or destroyed all his papers the day before he disappeared, then
that proves, to my mind, that he meant to disappear. There's
that."</p>

<p>"There's that," Andrew agreed. "But where does that get
you?"</p>

<p>"That's what I want to know, Mr. Barham," Hutchins said.</p>

<p>"Oh, well," Nelson gave in, "if you two are both down on my
plan, I'll give it up. What better can either of you propose?"</p>

<p>"I propose we give it all up," Barham said, speaking
gravely.</p>

<p>"The whole hunt?" exclaimed Hutchins; "withdraw the reward?"</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Hutchins, let us put all our cards on the table. You
have found out, I understand, some very damaging information
against my wife. Please do not try to spare my feelings. I can meet
the blow. I am prepared for it. Just how much did you find
out?"</p>

<p>"Since I know you want me to be frank, I will simply state that
I learned that Mrs. Barham was in the habit of using a form of
society blackmail to extort money from her friends."</p>

<p>"From what I have learned, I believe that to be the truth."</p>

<p>Barham spoke with an infinite sadness in his voice, but with his
head erect, and face impassive, as if he cared for no word of
regret or sympathy from any one.</p>

<p>It was true that the man's sensitive pride revolted at the
thought of any pity or even kindness. He preferred to bear his
burden alone, and except from his very few near and dear friends he
wanted no recognition of the state of the case, beyond the bare
facts that must be faced.</p>

<p>"First, Mr. Hutchins, I shall ask you to keep this matter from
Mrs. Selden, if it be possible. I think I am within my legal rights
as well as ethical in asking this. She is an old lady and devoted
to her daughter's memory. The grief of such a disclosure would
almost kill her."</p>

<p>"Rest assured, Mr. Barham, she shall never learn it from
me&mdash;or from any of our people."</p>

<p>"Next, I should like to hush up the whole affair. If this is not
possible&mdash;with the full consent of the police&mdash;then I am
ready to face the music&mdash;to let the law take its course. But,
I am quite prepared to pay a goodly sum to have the case
forgotten&mdash;and this is in no sense compounding a felony, or
even doing anything dishonorable. It is merely an expression of my
willingness to let the murderer of my wife go free, in order that
the wrong-doing of my wife may not be made public. Is there a
chance of that, Mr. Hutchins?"</p>

<p>"Not a chance!" the detective shook his head. "Of course, the
plan you propose is out of the question, as you yourself would see,
if you thought over it a little more. Also, the machinery already
set in motion cannot now be stopped. The posters are out, offering
a reward of Ten Thousand Dollars for the capture of the murderer,
or any information that leads to that result."</p>

<p>"Not for the finding of Locke?" asked Barham.</p>

<p>"No; I received your message in time to omit that part of
it."</p>

<p>"Yes, I changed that," Barham said, in answer to Nelson's
unspoken question. "You see, it can do no good to get Locke, if he
isn't the murderer. I mean, it isn't worth ten thousand dollars to
get him just to talk to."</p>

<p>"No," Nelson agreed. But he didn't quite understand. Surely,
Barham had been most anxious to capture Locke.</p>

<p>"Now, go ahead with your hunt," Barham said, "and, look here,
Nick, I rather cotton to that plan of yours to go and search the
Locke apartment&mdash;and I believe I'll go with you."</p>

<p>"Good!" Nelson cried. "I'm sure it is a good idea, and I do
believe we might find something of interest if not evidence. Shall
we go now?"</p>

<p>"Would it be better to go at night?"</p>

<p>"No," Hutchins said, "let's go now&mdash;let's all go. I'd like
to see how you people work."</p>

<p>"I don't dignify it by such a high sounding term as that,"
Nelson smiled. "More like playing at detecting. But there's always
a chance."</p>

<p>So the three, in Barham's car, went down to the studio of the
missing Thomas Locke.</p>

<p>The place looked much as it did the day Nelson attended the
inquest there, but not much as Barham had seen it the night of
the&nbsp;<i>Bal Masque</i>. Then it had been gay with lanterns and
flowers. Now it was in its plain, everyday furnishings, and, though
properly in order, and tidily cleared up by the Chinaman, yet he
had not been allowed to sweep or dust, lest he disturb what might
eventually be clues or evidence.</p>

<p>"Uninteresting place," Barham said, glancing round the studio.
"No color&mdash;no atmosphere."</p>

<p>"Now, I like it," Nelson said. "It is restful compared to the
glaring and tawdry effects in many such places."</p>

<p>"Well, go on with your sleuthing, Nick, I'll watch you," and
Barham sat down in one of the fireside chairs.</p>

<p>Nelson looked a little at a loss, but began to make a raid on a
desk that stood in a corner.</p>

<p>"Here's a big bunch of letters, Drew, you look these over, while
I dig up more."</p>

<p>But inside of ten minutes Barham informed him that the sheaf
contained nothing at all but receipted bills for canvases, paints
and brushes.</p>

<p>Nor did further search produce anything of more importance.
Nelson went back to the smoking room&mdash;and, disinclined to go
there again, Barham remained in the studio. Hutchins followed
Nelson, hoping to get a grain or a nugget of information.</p>

<p>Left to himself, Barham opened a few of the cabinet drawers.
Nelson had been through them all and, as he said, they held nothing
but painting things or trifling knickknacks.</p>

<p>"Where's the Chinaman?" Nelson asked, as they returned to
Barham.</p>

<p>"It's his day off," Hutchins explained. "Though he has most days
off now. He doesn't seem to know what to do. You know he heard from
Locke, Mr. Barham?"</p>

<p>"No, did he?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and Locke said he could pay the small bills&mdash;the
Chink has petty cash&mdash;and that he, Locke, would settle the
larger accounts."</p>

<p>"Then, Mr. Hutchins, you must realize that Locke will never
return. To my mind, it is self-evident that though he is near
by&mdash;at least, in the city&mdash;he is clever enough to remain
hidden."</p>

<p>"Not necessarily in the city," said Nelson. "He may have
telephoned on a long distance."</p>

<p>"Right," Barham agreed. "At any rate, he is quite capable, as it
looks to me, of taking care of himself, and keeping in hiding as
long as he chooses. I think, if you please, Mr. Hutchins, I will
take a look in the den. I hesitated, as it is a place of painful
associations, but there is a chance I might see something of
informative value."</p>

<p>But when Andrew Barham stood in the little room, at the very
spot where his wife was, doubtless, felled to her death, he could
see no shred, no bit of evidence.</p>

<p>The tears were in his eyes as he turned away.</p>

<p>One of the heavy bronze book-ends still stood on the table, the
other had been taken away by the police as the weapon of
murder.</p>

<p>And then, still in a spirit of investigation, the three went
into Locke's bedroom and bathroom. Nothing met their eyes that
offered any ground for surmise or conclusion. Slowly they retraced
their way downstairs.</p>

<p>"Come on, Drew," said Nelson, as he followed the detective
down.</p>

<p>"In a minute," Barham replied, pausing for another glance into
the den.</p>

<p>It was by no means a morbid curiosity, but there were many
conflicting feelings in Andrew Barham's mind just then.</p>

<p>He wondered.</p>

<p>On the way home in the car&mdash;Hutchins having remained,
behind&mdash;Barham said, "I can't see, Nick, that the police are
making any headway whatever. I can't see but Locke has them just
where he wants them&mdash;if he wants them anywhere."</p>

<p>"Where does he want them?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I mean, he has things all his own way. Apparently, he means
never to come back. There's not a thing in the place of
value&mdash;that's what I noticed especially&mdash;there's not a
personal thing that he could possibly care for&mdash;oh, of course,
there are his pictures&mdash;but I can't imagine any one caring
greatly for those."</p>

<p>"Mere sketches, they looked to me&mdash;and yet, I rather liked
them. Good, soft coloring, and all that."</p>

<p>"All alike, weren't they?"</p>

<p>"Pretty much. Well, granting Locke is out of it, and his stuff
there, as you say, of no value, then&mdash;don't you see, the
police are going to concentrate all their efforts on finding out
something in Madeleine's past life that will explain the
murder."</p>

<p>Barham sighed deeply. "Of course they are. Of course I see it.
And that's where you come in. What can we do to stop them?"</p>

<p>"I can't think of anything. Your offer of money went
nowhere."</p>

<p>"Nowhere at all. I suppose we can't build up a man of straw for
them to hang their suspicions on."</p>

<p>"And it isn't that now, Drew. Just now, they've enough of that
scandal about Madeleine to whet their appetites for more. They're
like a pack of vultures; they want to get a lot of back
history&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I say, Nick! That might apply to a newspaper, a yellow
one&mdash;but not to the police!"</p>

<p>"Well, to these detectives. They're so eager to get a feather to
stick in their cap, that they'd go any lengths to dig up horrid old
gossip to help along!"</p>

<p>"But, if the horrid old gossip chances to be the truth&mdash;as
it is in this case, who can blame them? Lord knows I want to hush
up the whole affair&mdash;but if it can't be done, it can't."</p>

<p>"Then you think it must all come out?"</p>

<p>"Looks so. I can hush up the women&mdash;not one of that Bridge
pack but would keep her mouth shut for a few hundred dollars. And
they have an affection for Maddy, too. They hadn't so much when she
was alive, but now they're tender toward her memory. It's the
police who will make the trouble&mdash;and the reporters&mdash;and
worst of all, the exaggeration. If they'd tell the truth&mdash;that
would be bad enough. But they'll multiply everything by four and
then double it."</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose they will. Did you notice that picture of the
girl&mdash;on the side table in the den?"</p>

<p>"No; what girl?"</p>

<p>The one I told you about, with the queer name&mdash;Pearl Jane.
She had bobbed hair&mdash;rather curly."</p>

<p>"No, I didn't see any such picture."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I think I set another picture over it, as I was
digging about. That's why. Wild goose chase, going down there at
all. But I really thought we might turn up something."</p>

<p>"There's no chance for clues, Nick, if that's what you mean.
Whoever killed Maddy was too clever to leave a clue. That much is
evident to me."</p>

<p>"Yes, and to me, too," said Nelson.</p>

<h2><b><a name="Chapter_12" id="Chapter_12">Chapter 12</a><br>
Chinese Charley</b>
</h2>

<p>Chinese Charley&nbsp;was proving a puzzle to the police.</p>

<p>As his wages were paid to the end of the month, his notion of
duty kept him at his post until the expiration of that time. Then,
he explained, he would go away and get another place&mdash;unless
he had different orders from Mr. Locke in the meantime.</p>

<p>"You are in touch with him, Charley!" Hutchins accused him.</p>

<p>"Touch?" said the Chinese, blankly.</p>

<p>"You hear from him. He writes you? Telephones you?"</p>

<p>"No," said Charley.</p>

<p>But Hutchins believed he lied.</p>

<p>Since the caretaker was there, however, Glenn continued to stay
in the studio apartment day and night. This would continue until
the end of the month; then, if Locke had not been heard from, the
house agent said he should lock up the place until the paid-up rent
had expired and then rent it to some one else.</p>

<p>So matters seemed to be shaping themselves to a general
permanent arrangement of forgetting Tommy Locke.</p>

<p>Yet there was nothing else to do. Hunt was being made, search
was being kept up, yet there was no sign of the missing man, except
the vague reports of his telephoning his servant and friends. Nor
could these be verified.</p>

<p>Henry Post declared he had not heard from Locke. Kate Vallon
said she had not, while little Miss Cutler refused to answer
questions about it.</p>

<p>Charley was equally taciturn, and Hutchins despaired of ever
finding out anything.</p>

<p>But the very day after Nelson and Andrew Barham had visited the
studio, Charley, who was tidying up, suddenly gave an
exclamation.</p>

<p>"What's doing?" asked Glenn, who sat by, reading a paper.</p>

<p>"Nothing, sir," and the Oriental's face was a blank.</p>

<p>"You Chinese rascal, you've found something. Tell me what, or
I'll have the law on you!"</p>

<p>"Nothing, sir."</p>

<p>And "nothing, sir," was all Glenn could extract from the wily
Charley. He watched him closely all day, but could get no inkling
of the discovery he had made, if any.</p>

<p>The only effect it seemed to have was to make the Chinaman do
some searching on his own account. Several times through the day,
Charley sneaked into the studio or den or the bedroom, choosing
opportunities when Glenn was elsewhere, and swiftly pulled out
drawers, opened cupboards and rummaged in boxes.</p>

<p>When Glenn came upon him, he immediately looked as innocent as a
cherub, and pretended to be emptying an ash tray or picking up
papers.</p>

<p>"You're a caution, Charley," Glenn said. "I wish I could see
into that carved ivory dome of yours."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said the imperturbable one.</p>

<p>That afternoon Charley dressed himself in street clothes and
went forth on errands. Returning, he informed Glenn that he had
been to pay the caterer's bill and also the house agent's rent.</p>

<p>Glenn looked at him, astonished.</p>

<p>"Where'd you get the money?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Found in&mdash;in cubby drawer," and Charley pointed to a
certain pigeonhole in Locke's desk.</p>

<p>"What? How'd it get there?"</p>

<p>"Misser Locke&mdash;he put."</p>

<p>Apparently the Chinese was greatly enjoying the other's
amazement. Though his yellow face was grave, the slant eyes were
flickering with sly interest.</p>

<p>"Mr. Locke put it there! Are you crazy?"</p>

<p>"No clazy; no, sir."</p>

<p>"How do you know he put it there?"</p>

<p>"Note say so. Note to Charley."</p>

<p>"A note to you? Come, now, this is too much. Have you seen Mr.
Locke?"</p>

<p>"No see Misser Locke, but get note. He put."</p>

<p>"He put! You&mdash; You'll be put&mdash;in jail if
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just for 'cause pay bill? Good bill?"</p>

<p>"Let me see your note."</p>

<p>"All burn up."</p>

<p>"Look here, you. Do you mean you found money and a note there,
that weren't there before? That Mr. Locke has been here&mdash;and
left money for you to pay his bills?"</p>

<p>"Thass right. Money for me, for Caterman, for Agent man.
Dassall."</p>

<p>"Well, next time he comes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He no come more. He good-by."</p>

<p>"Oh, he's good-by, is he? Well, I think you're making up this
whole yarn. That's what I think."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>But Glenn didn't think so, he knew better. Though not for a
moment did he believe the money or note had been found in that
pigeonhole. He concluded Locke had gone to Charley's home&mdash;the
Chinaman went home nights&mdash;and Glenn was sure that Locke had
been to see him, and by judicious payment had stopped his mouth
from undesired disclosures. Anyway, Glenn decided, that was all he
could make of it.</p>

<p>He called up Hutchins but failed to get him, and he went to bed
that night with one ear alert, hoping "Misser Locke" would pay
another call.</p>

<p>But his hopes were not fulfilled, and next day he told Hutchins
of Charley's story.</p>

<p>"I know," Hutchins said, staring at Glenn. "There's something
else doing, too. It seems Henry Post and that Miss Vallon have each
had a letter from Locke. They were ready enough to tell of it,
ready, too, to give us the letters. But, confound it, how has that
chap the nerve to stay around here&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A letter doesn't mean he's around here."</p>

<p>"No, nor does a telephone call. But if he put that money where
Charley says he did, he must be in this vicinity."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't believe the Chink. Locke sent him that money by
postal order or something like that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's neither here nor there, anyway. The point is, that
apparently Locke has no intention of returning to this place at
all. Now, if that is so, he's staying away because he is guilty. If
he were an innocent man, why wouldn't he return and help straighten
things out? I can't see it any other way than that Locke did know
Mrs. Barham, and did kill her. His very coolness and nerve in
writing letters and telephoning and all that, proves the
possibility, the probability of his being just the sort who would
commit a murder, and then walk out the front door, saying, 'Back in
a minute.'"</p>

<p>"That's all so," and Glenn tried to look wise. He was an humble
underling, and he was secretly elated at being thus talked to by
the great Hutchins.</p>

<p>"Of course it is," Hutchins went on. He was really only thinking
aloud, and used Glenn merely as a target for his speech. "So I'm
more than ever convinced that Locke is our man, and that his murder
of Mrs. Barham was premeditated and prearranged. Now, here's that
Yellow Streak again! What is it, Charley?"</p>

<p>"I talk you, alone, Misser Hutch."</p>

<p>"No, I don't think you will. You'll talk to me right here before
Mr. Glenn. He's my brother and my father and my grandmother."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Then, Misser Hutch, I ask you help me. I know
things."</p>

<p>"Oho, you do! Well, Charley, if you know things, I'm the man to
help you. And whatever you know, out with it. You may forget
it."</p>

<p>"No, I no forget."</p>

<p>The Chinaman was serious now, and obviously deeply troubled.</p>

<p>Hutchins winked at Glenn but said no word, fearing to disturb
Charley's thoughts&mdash;which, on the whole, promised to be
interesting when divulged.</p>

<p>"I have errand to do for Misser Locke," he said at last. "I no
can do&mdash;alone."</p>

<p>"All right," Hutchins said, cheerfully, "I'll help you. Do we
start now?"</p>

<p>But Charley looked graver still, and shook his head.</p>

<p>"It's to the lady," he divulged. "The pretty little lady."</p>

<p>"Miss Cutler?" Hutchins guessed.</p>

<p>"Yes, Missee Cutler."</p>

<p>"See here, Charley, is she Mr. Locke's girl&mdash;you
know&mdash;sweetheart?"</p>

<p>"I donno. But Misser Locke he want his&mdash;his jewel
thing&mdash;his Luckee&mdash;and Missee Cutler&mdash;she got
it."</p>

<p>The secret came out in a burst of confidence, and his tale told,
Charley wilted. His waving arms fell limp, and his excited face
returned to its normal stolidity.</p>

<p>Hutchins held himself in, and strove to answer casually.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes&mdash;that's easy. Miss Cutler has Mr. Locke's
jewel&mdash;a lucky piece, you say? And Mr. Locke wants it. Of
course he does. He'd have no luck without it. Well, let's go and
get it from Miss Cutler. Or did he give it to her? Is it hers
now?"</p>

<p>"No! Oh, no!" Charley fairly shuddered. "He not give it to her.
She take it&mdash;Missee Cutler take
it&mdash;from&mdash;from&mdash;dead lady!"</p>

<p>Charley's eyes now glowed with horror, even fright. But whatever
the meaning of this strange story he was telling, he was certainly
in earnest. There was no slyness now&mdash;no roguery. The man was
deeply stirred by some emotion&mdash;some sense of duty.</p>

<p>Hutchins' own calm gave way.</p>

<p>"Miss Cutler took it from the dead lady! From Mrs. Barham? What
are you talking about?"</p>

<p>"Go easy," Glenn warned him. "He'll shut up or bolt, if you're
not careful."</p>

<p>"Right, Glenn," and Hutchins put a guard on his impatience.</p>

<p>"When did she take it Charley?" he asked. "When did Miss Cutler
take the lucky piece from Mrs. Barham?"</p>

<p>"After&mdash;after she dead&mdash;oh, oh!" His long, yellow
hands flew up and covered his eyes. Clearly, he was envisioning a
horrible memory.</p>

<p>Hutchins' mind worked like lightning.</p>

<p>"Charley," he said, "who killed the lady? Who killed Mrs.
Barham? Did Mr. Locke do it?"</p>

<p>But no answer came. The slant eyes&nbsp;seeemed&nbsp;to be of
glass, so meaningless, so unalive they became.</p>

<p>"If he knows, he won't tell," Glenn urged. "Get at it in a
roundabout way."</p>

<p>The next day, Hutchins realized that he was taking advice from
an humble inferior, but at this moment the suggestion seemed good
to him, and he acted on it at once.</p>

<p>"Yes, Charley," he said; "yes&mdash;about that lucky piece, now.
Was it a jewel?"</p>

<p>"Donno what you call. But like a flyaway. All same, dead lady
had him in her hand."</p>

<p>"After she was dead?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Then I see Missee Cutler take him out of dead lady's
hand, and put him away, in her blouse. So."</p>

<p>Charley tucked his hand into his house jacket, with quite
evident imitation of a woman concealing a treasure trove in her
bodice.</p>

<p>"Charley," Hutchins looked at him sternly, "why are you telling
this now? Is it true? If it is, why didn't you tell at first?"</p>

<p>Charley looked troubled.</p>

<p>"I like Missee Cutler&mdash;but," he sighed deeply, "I like my
Misser Locke more. You make Missee Cutler give me lucky piece for
my Misser Locke?"</p>

<p>"I will, indeed&mdash;if she has it. You say you saw her take
it&mdash;from&mdash;here, Charley, come into the den and show
me."</p>

<p>Hutchins led the way and Charley obediently followed. Glenn,
after them, wondering if they were on the verge of an important
revelation or if the Chinaman had them "on a string."</p>

<p>"Now," Hutchins said, watching Charley steadily, "Where was Mrs.
Barham&mdash;the dead lady?"</p>

<p>"Here," and he indicated the spot where Madeleine had been
found.</p>

<p>"And where was Miss Cutler? How?"</p>

<p>"So," and the Chinaman crouched over the place as one might who
was intently examining an unconscious body. With his long yellow
fingers, he made motions of extracting a small object from the
hand&mdash;and so graphic was he that Glenn was horrified.</p>

<p>"Missee Barrum here," and Charley explained, as if he feared his
dumb show was not intelligible; "Missee Cutler lean
over&mdash;so&mdash;and pick Luckee from dead lady's fingers."</p>

<p>"Where were you?" Hutchins asked, sternly.</p>

<p>"Here," and Charley rose and hurried to the little back hall.
Then, standing just outside the partly open door, he peeped around
it, as if spying on the scene he had just portrayed.</p>

<p>"I can't seem to think this is all made up," Hutchins said to
Glenn, in a breathless aside, "and yet it is incredible. Do you
suppose Pearl Jane&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Killed Mrs. Barham? I do not!" and Glenn looked positive "But I
believe this dumb show business. Charley never invented all
that.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Moreover, Locke is after that lucky
piece&mdash;or whatever it is&mdash;and Charley, who is all
devotion to him, wants to get it for him."</p>

<p>"When you get it, Charley," Hutchins said, "how will you get it
to Mr. Locke?"</p>

<p>But now the shrewd look returned. "I do," was all the reply
Hutchins could obtain. `</p>

<p>"I was pretty sure that girl was mixed up in the affair
somehow," Hutchins said, reflectively, as he looked at Glenn.</p>

<p>"She could be mixed up in it and yet be entirely innocent of
crime," Glenn persisted, for his heart had been caught in the
tangles of Pearl Jane's bobbed hair.</p>

<p>"She could. And if you feel that way about it, you'd better not
go with me over to her place&mdash;which is where I'm going right
now. You'd better not go, anyway, as I propose to take Charley, and
if we leave this place unguarded, friend Locke may come in and camp
here."</p>

<p>"No such luck," returned Glenn, "I wish he would. But I've no
desire to go and see or hear you bait that young woman."</p>

<p>"I know you haven't. But, listen here, Glenn. That young woman
was found by me, crying, in that closet in that back hall there.
She had a smear on her sleeve that looked to me like blood. When I
went to see her a few hours later, she had washed the stain
away&mdash;I saw the mark of it left. She said&mdash;or, rather
Miss Vallon said, they had washed away a few drops of cocoa.
Somebody else said, it might have been a red smear from a lipstick,
every woman carries those nowadays. But I say, if that smear was
lipstick or rouge or cocoa, why were they in such a hurry to
eradicate it? Why did they notice it at all? Also, in that same
cupboard was the monk's robe, which Locke had tossed to Charley and
which Charley had hung up there. That, too, had a smear of blood on
it. Now, add the fact that Charley saw Miss Cutler bending over the
body, that he saw her take something from the dead woman's hand and
conceal it in her bosom, add the fact&mdash;or, at least, my strong
conviction that Miss Cutler has had one telephone message&mdash;if
not two&mdash;from Locke, since his disappearance, and, perhaps
romancing a little, remember that the girl was in love with Locke
and may easily have been jealous of this strange
woman&mdash;perhaps no stranger to her&mdash;oh, well, there's
enough, to my way of thinking, to get busy on."</p>

<p>Glenn had nothing in particular to reply to all this, and taking
Charley with him, Hutchins started off to see Pearl Jane.</p>

<p>But her little place was closed and locked. Nor was Miss Vallon
at home. The janitor said the two ladies had gone away together,
and had left word they would be back in two days.</p>

<p>"If ever!" exclaimed Hutchins, when he heard this. He was angry,
for he feared that, like Locke, the two women had gone for good and
all.</p>

<p>The janitor reassured him, however, saying the two frequently
went off for a couple of days, and he was positive they would be
back the next day but one.</p>

<p>Hutchins had half a mind to get a warrant and search Pearl
Jane's rooms, but he wasn't quite sure enough of the credibility of
Charley's story.</p>

<p>At any rate, no one else knew of it, and if he could make the
Chinaman keep quiet, and could pledge Glenn to secrecy, the matter
could await the return of the two women.</p>

<p>So he told Charley that if he said no word of it all to any one,
that probably the lucky piece would be recovered. But if he
told&mdash;there was no chance of it.</p>

<p>This made the boy promise, and Hutchins believed he would keep
his word.</p>

<p>Glenn, too, agreed to be silent, and Hutchins turned his
attention to the Barham side of the question for the next
forty-eight hours. It was his plan to work from Locke to Mrs.
Barham and back again, hoping to get some data on one side that
would dovetail with facts on the other.</p>

<p>Glenn slept soundly that night. He was not a heavy sleeper,
usually, but after any mental excitement, he felt exhausted, and
glad of a good rest.</p>

<p>Though on guard in the house, he was not required to stay awake
at night, Dickson deeming it highly improbable that any intruder
would put in an appearance.</p>

<p>Nor had any one done so, to Glenn's knowledge, though Charley's
story of finding money and a note in the desk looked like it. But
Glenn doubted the details of the story and felt sure the Oriental
had made up that part and had really received the messages by mail
or in some such way, at his own place.</p>

<p>And so, when, toward morning, Glenn heard a faint sound, which
awoke him, he didn't, at first, think it might mean anything of
interest.</p>

<p>He listened, however, but he heard nothing more.</p>

<p>A moment later he saw or thought he saw a mere speck of light as
if from a pocket flashlight held by some one in the den.</p>

<p>Glenn was a good watchman, and his getting up out of bed was
absolutely noiseless. So was his progress across the room and into
the little back hall. From here he could see&mdash;even as Charley
had seen&mdash;the spot where the dead body had been found. And
there, bending over, as Pearl Jane might have bent over, was a dark
figure&mdash;a man, searching on the floor.</p>

<p>The tiny flashlight gave but a point of light, but by its single
ray, the intruder was intently, eagerly looking for something.</p>

<p>Awaiting his time, Glenn continued to watch. The man's motions
were so slow, his actions so deliberate, the policeman felt sure he
could spring at him when he got ready, and still catch him
unawares.</p>

<p>The man's back was toward Glenn, but he felt certain it was
Locke. He could see dark hair, rather long, beneath the soft, dark
hat. He caught sight of a flowing tie&mdash;these things, he had
been told, spelled Locke.</p>

<p>Slowly, still, the man turned to the nearby table. This was
getting pretty close to Glenn's hiding place, and he concluded the
time was ripe.</p>

<p>The man reached for something on the table, and at the same
movement Glenn burst in upon him, crying, "Hands up, Mr. Locke!
Come quietly, now."</p>

<p>The man raised an astonished face, and at sight of Glenn,
tousle-haired, wild-eyed, and clad only in pajamas, gave way to an
irrepressible smile, exhibiting two gold eye-teeth and then,
quickly snapping off his little flashlight, he sprang aside, and
made for the studio door.</p>

<p>But Glenn was too quick for him, and though it was pitch dark he
was guided by the sounds, and the policeman slammed the door shut
just before the other reached it.</p>

<p>At bay, the intruder met Glenn in a hand to hand fight&mdash;by
no means a desperate one, but both men were in earnest and the
wrestling was steady and forceful.</p>

<p>Glenn found his opponent was holding his own, and, incidentally
edging nearer and nearer to the hall door, which, if he gained,
would let him down the front stairs.</p>

<p>This Glenn aimed to prevent, but, finally by a sudden push, the
stranger sent the policeman flat against the wall, winded and off
his balance.</p>

<p>He recovered in a moment, but by that time the other had gone
through the hall door, slammed it behind him, and could be heard
running down the front stairs.</p>

<p>As Glenn opened the door at the top of the stairs, he heard the
street door flung open, and when, after the shortest possible
interval he himself was down at the street door, and running down
the steps, no one was in sight.</p>

<p>Baffled, he looked one way and another, and just then Briggs
came along on his beat.</p>

<p>"What's up?" he cried.</p>

<p>"Locke! Chase him!" Glenn cried; "he just got away!"</p>

<p>"Locke!" Briggs echoed. "Which way?"</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;he just ran out this door&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He never did! I should have seen him. Where was he?"</p>

<p>"In the house&mdash;upstairs&mdash;he fought me&mdash;" Glenn
suddenly awoke to the fact that he was too unconventionally clad to
appear on a front stoop, and made for the house door again.</p>

<p>"Chase him, Briggs," he urged.</p>

<p>"Aw, chase yourself," Briggs returned. "'Twas a nightmare you
had. Go back to bed."</p>

<p>"No, it was no nightmare," Glenn returned, "but I know what did
happen. He fooled me! He slammed this door open&mdash;and then ran
back through the hall and out that way. We've lost him!"</p>

<p>"You poor fish!"said Briggs.</p>

<h2><b><a name="Chapter_13" id="Chapter_13">Chapter 13</a><br>
The Lucky Piece</b>
</h2>

<p>When&nbsp;Hutchins heard of the nocturnal visit, he merely
raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"I told you he was a slick one," he said to Glenn. "I don't
blame you, though&mdash;you did your best. But he had the advantage
in knowing the ways of his own house, and being able to run around
in the dark."</p>

<p>"Aw, I know this house well enough," Glenn declared. "I haven't
lived here a week or more without knowing where the doors and halls
run into each other, and all that. But it was his fighting that put
me out of commission."</p>

<p>"Jiu-jitsu?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it. But skillful, clever wrestling&mdash;like a
professional. Why, I hadn't a show. He didn't hurt me a bit, but he
just, well, he just sort of set me on one side. Then, as you say,
he did know, even in the dark, just where he wanted to get
to&mdash;and he got there."</p>

<p>"And fooled you beside."</p>

<p>"Yes, and fooled me beside. Of course, when I heard the front
door slam open, I supposed he went out that way. And there, little
cutie had swished the door open, with a flourish of trumpets, and
then he had whisked himself through the house, and out at the good
little old back door&mdash;so he had! Had the nerve to leave
that&nbsp;flying&nbsp;open behind him, too!"</p>

<p>"Don't worry, Glenn, if you had caught him you couldn't have
held him, and if you'd locked him in&mdash;he'd have got out! I
tell you he's as bright as they come&mdash;if he is an artist."</p>

<p>"Well, what next? He'll not come here again."</p>

<p>"How do you know? Did he get what he was after?"</p>

<p>"What was he after?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. What did he get?"</p>

<p>"I don't know that he got anything. But I haven't looked around
at all. I was so sore&mdash;mentally, not physically&mdash;that I
just went back to bed&mdash;and I'm only just through my breakfast
now."</p>

<p>"Let's give the place the once over. I don't think there was
anything of value for him to take&mdash;but he was after something
and we may get a line on it."</p>

<p>"Why, of course, he was after his lucky piece&mdash;as Charley
calls it."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;if it was Locke."</p>

<p>"If it was Locke? Who else in thunder could it be?"</p>

<p>"Might be lots of people. Hello, what's this?"</p>

<p>The two had wandered through the studio, looking for any bit of
evidence and finding none, and now they were in the Den. On the
floor in a corner lay a strange looking object.</p>

<p>Hutchins picked it up and held it out at arm's length.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm blowed!" he ejaculated, though he rarely gave way to
such elaborate expletive.</p>

<p>But the occasion seemed to justify it, for the thing he held up
to Glenn's view was a wig of rather long, black hair.</p>

<p>Glenn's eyes grew big and round as he gazed.</p>

<p>"That's it!" he cried; "I grabbed him by the hair once, and it
seemed to slide! Gave me the creeps! I'd forgotten that. My
heavens, Hutchins, what does it mean?"</p>

<p>"It means," the detective said, slowly, "well, it might mean
something else, but I'll say it means that your friend of last
night wasn't Locke at all, but somebody rigged up to look like
him."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;that must be it. An ordinary burglar, disguised
as&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, by no means an ordinary burglar! Rather a most
extraordinary one! One who was so bent on getting in here that he
made up to look like a man for whom a reward is offered! That's
going some!"</p>

<p>"But it must have been Locke&mdash;for he came in with his own
night key&mdash;that is, he must have done so, or how did he get
in?"</p>

<p>"Well, a chap smart enough to make up like Locke is smart enough
to get a key somewhere or somehow. But,
why?&nbsp;<i>why?</i>&mdash;that's what I can't understand. It can
only be that there is some incriminating evidence still here
regarding that murder. Nothing else would bring about such
elaborate preparations."</p>

<p>"Mightn't be elaborate. Just slapping a wig on your head isn't
such a great game."</p>

<p>"No; but this is just like Locke's hair&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How do you know&mdash;except by hearsay?"</p>

<p>"That's so, Glenn, I don't. But all the descriptions of Locke
sound like this thing looks."</p>

<p>"It was Locke, Hutchins, I saw his two gold teeth gleam. I've
heard over and over again about those two gold teeth."</p>

<p>"So have I. Well, no burglar could carry disguise so far as
that. It must have been Locke. I have it. He's had his hair cut, to
escape detection, and coming back here, he put on a wig to be
different from what he really is now."</p>

<p>"Pretty good&mdash;but not good enough. I'll tell you! It was
that brother of Locke's. He'd likely have gold teeth, too, such
things run in families&mdash;and he impersonated his brother to get
something here in the house."</p>

<p>"I never thought that brother person was really a brother,"
Hutchins said, gloomily. Things were getting beyond his ken.</p>

<p>"Where's the girl's picture?" Glenn cried, looking around. "Ha!
It&nbsp;<i>was</i>&nbsp;Locke&mdash;he took the picture&mdash;the
painting of the Cutler girl! That's what he was after! Oh, these
young lovers!"</p>

<p>"Bah, I don't believe it. It's too foolish. What was it. A
photograph?"</p>

<p>"No; a little painting&mdash;pretty&mdash;almost like a
miniature. I think Locke painted it himself&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I think he didn't. He paints landscapes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Some artists do both. Well, maybe he didn't paint it&mdash;but
it's gone, and I'll bet he took it. He stopped at that
table&mdash;where it stood&mdash;the last thing before he left the
room."</p>

<p>"Maybe he took it then&mdash;but it's of small importance. The
fact that Locke is in love with the little Cutler girl&mdash;or she
with him&mdash;hasn't much to do with our finding the murderer of
Mrs. Barham. That's what I'm after."</p>

<p>"Well, I think this wig business and this fellow that broke in
last night are important matters. And I'll bet old Dickson'll think
so too. Don't pass it up, Hutchins&mdash;sleuth it out. If it was
Locke why did he come, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And if it wasn't Locke, why didn't he? But I'll tell you what
we'll do. Put it up to Charley. See if he knows anything about it.
Maybe Locke always wore a wig. Maybe he wanted to affect that long
hair business and couldn't do it on his own."</p>

<p>Charley came at their summons and gazed stolidly at the wig when
asked to observe it.</p>

<p>"Whose is it, Charley."</p>

<p>"Donno."</p>

<p>"Is it Mr. Locke's?"</p>

<p>"Donno."</p>

<p>"Did Mr. Locke ever wear a wig? Come, you must know that?"</p>

<p>"Donno."</p>

<p>And even threats of jail, or intimations of worse punishment
could not move the Chinaman to admit any knowledge of the wig or
even the slightest interest in it.</p>

<p>Nor did Dickson seem as much impressed as Glenn thought he would
be.</p>

<p>He opined it might have been some sneak thief, who had donned a
wig merely to disguise his own appearance, or it might have been a
curiosity seeker, of whom there were plenty about. He could see no
explanation of Locke's presence there, for if he wanted to come to
his own house as secretly as all that, he would have disguised
himself&mdash;not attempted to look like himself.</p>

<p>But Glenn persuaded Hutchins to take the wig with him when he
went to see Miss Cutler&mdash;for, he said, she could tell whether
it's really like Locke's hair or not.</p>

<p>"It's a mighty fine wig," Glenn went on, "and it was made in
Paris&mdash;see, here's the maker's mark."</p>

<p>"That's nothing," Hutchins scoffed, "all good wigs are made in
Paris. It's a very expensive affair, too, which proves that it
never was made merely to look like Locke on a midnight marauding
expedition. That wig was made for a special customer, and for a
special purpose. It has since fallen from such high estate, and is,
most likely, the property of an artist's model, who is posing as
Hamlet or a Wandering Minstrel. By the way, like as not, it was
worn here at the masquerade. Then when friend burglar started
upstairs, he saw it, somewhere about, and clapped it on his head by
way of disguise."</p>

<p>"Oh, you can make up fine-sounding gabble, but if you'd seen
that chap, as I did, bending over that spot in the den&mdash;you'd
know he was no burglar&mdash;he was Locke himself, or somebody who
wanted to appear to be Locke."</p>

<p>"You said that before," and Hutchins grinned at Glenn, as he
registered extreme weariness.</p>

<p>All the same, when Hutchins set out for his interview with Pearl
Jane, he did carry the wig with him, and he did hope to learn
something about it from the girl.</p>

<p>She didn't want to see the detective at all, but he had told her
over the telephone that she must, and that she must see him alone.
He gave her no choice in the matter and advised her to be at home
when he called, which would be immediately.</p>

<p>So he found her waiting for him, and, while she was calm, yet he
could note an undercurrent of nervous excitement, and a frequent
tremor of overwrought nerves.</p>

<p>"Now, Miss Cutler," he began, not at all unkindly, but
decidedly, "I can't help feeling you've not been entirely frank
with me when we have talked together. This time, I hope you will
be&mdash;for I may as well tell you that unless you are, you may be
questioned by other people who will not be so patient with you as I
am."</p>

<p>"What do you want to know?" and Pearl Jane struggled hard to
preserve her composure.</p>

<p>"First&mdash;what did you take from the hand of the&mdash;of
Mrs. Barham, that night as she lay on the floor of the smoking
room?"</p>

<p>Pearl Jane grasped her throat to stifle a cry.</p>

<p>"Now, don't do that," and Hutchins spoke a bit sharply.
"Hysterics won't get you anywhere. You've tried them before. Don't
scream, or burst into tears, for if you do I shall only wait till
you're over it."</p>

<p>"Aren't you perfectly horrid!" and the gray eyes flashed angrily
at him.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have to be&mdash;to keep you from being so! Go on, now,
answer that question, so we can go on to the next."</p>

<p>"I didn't take anything&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Look here, my dear young lady, let me say from the start,
falsehoods are barred. If you're just going to tell stories, you
can tell them to some one else. I've no time nor inclination for
anything but the truth. I think I'd better take you over to the
police station for a hearing."</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;I'll tell the truth. But&mdash;but skip that
question&mdash;ask me the next one?"</p>

<p>"This is the next," and Hutchins looked grave. "Did you kill
Mrs. Barham?"</p>

<p>"No, no, no!" and again hysterics were imminent.</p>

<p>But the face she raised to Hutchins was so imploring, and withal
so appealingly sorrowful, that Hutchins was forced to modify his
manner a little.</p>

<p>"I don't believe you did," he said, heartily, after a deep look
into her eyes, "now, have you any idea who did?"</p>

<p>"That I refuse to answer," and now the eyes flashed. "You can
take me to the station or to prison or you can take me to the
electric chair&mdash;but I shall never tell you if I suspect any
one&mdash;any one at all!"</p>

<p>She lay back in her chair rather exhausted at the vehemence of
her own speech.</p>

<p>She looked very young, she seemed very alone&mdash;but
underneath her young helplessness there seemed to be a strong power
of will that Hutchins began to see was unbreakable.</p>

<p>"You care for him as much as that, then," Hutchins said, his
voice sinking to a whisper.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Pearl Jane, and her face glowed with a soft
flush.</p>

<p>Then realizing that she had been trapped, she flew at him like a
young tigress. "How dare you? You think that is
fair&mdash;right&mdash;to trap me into an admission. Mr. Hutchins,
you are more guilty of falsehood than I! You have no right
to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There, there, Miss Cutler, yours is an open secret. You
couldn't keep it if you wanted to. Now, let me tell you, that it
will be better for Mr. Locke in the long run, if you will be frank
about him. Are you engaged to him?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Do you&mdash;or did you expect to be?"</p>

<p>"Those are questions you've no right to ask."</p>

<p>"Very well, perhaps I haven't. Now, Miss Cutler, do you know
whose this is?"</p>

<p>He flung off the paper, and held up the wig suddenly before her
astonished eyes.</p>

<p>She gazed at it as if hypnotized. She wasn't scared&mdash;she
seemed not to be over-curious, but she looked at the thing with a
mild wonder, as a child at a curious novelty.</p>

<p>"Where did it come from?" she asked, and gave a puzzled
smile.</p>

<p>"Of whom does it remind you?"</p>

<p>"Of Mr. Locke. It is exactly like his hair."</p>

<p>"Do you think it is his hair? I mean, do you think he wears a
wig, continually?"</p>

<p>"That's what I'm wondering. I don't know, I'm sure, but I do
know that's Tommy Locke's hair, or just exactly like the hair I've
always seen on his head. Oh, nonsense! No, I don't believe he wears
a wig habitually. Why should he? He's a young man."</p>

<p>"How old?"</p>

<p>"I don't know exactly. We've judged him at twenty-eight or
twenty-nine. That's not old enough for a wig!</p>

<p>"It is in the case of some people. Why do you smile?"</p>

<p>"It's so funny. If it is his&mdash;and if he hasn't another, and
has lost this&mdash;how queer he must look. Do you suppose he is
bald?"</p>

<p>Miss Cutler shook her own short, thick locks, and then she
became serious again. "Where did you get it?" she asked.</p>

<p>Hutchins told her the whole story, and asked her opinion.</p>

<p>"No, it wasn't Tommy," she said; "it was some of the boys
dressed up for a prank. It doesn't seem funny to you, I daresay,
but the boys do ever so many things that they think are funny, but
no one else does."</p>

<p>"But this funny person took your picture&mdash;the little one in
the den."</p>

<p>"That one! Why, that is one of Mr. Locke's chief treasures.
Jamieson painted that&mdash;how dare anybody steal it! Can you get
it back?"</p>

<p>"But perhaps it was Mr. Locke himself who took it. He would have
a right to, you know."</p>

<p>"Yes," and again she blushed that soft, pretty pink.</p>

<p>"Where's his lucky piece?" asked Hutchins, suddenly. It was his
theory that these suddenly sprung queries brought results before
the victim was aware of it.</p>

<p>"What lucky piece?"</p>

<p>"The one you took from Mrs. Barham's hand."</p>

<p>He could see the effort she made&mdash;but this time it was
successful. She conquered her emotion, she controlled her voice and
she said calmly, "Mr. Hutchins, you spoke of that before. What
makes you think I took anything from the dead woman?"</p>

<p>"You were seen to do so."</p>

<p>"By that lying Chinaman! I refuse to answer if he is your
informant."</p>

<p>"But he saw you&mdash;he was directly behind you. You leaned
over and took the thing&mdash;and in so doing you touched your
sleeve to her wounded forehead, thus making the smear which you
afterward washed out."</p>

<p>"No, you are all wrong&mdash;I did none of those things."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;then you won't mind if I look about a bit for it?
You see, if I look through your place and announce that I can't
find it&mdash;they won't send somebody else to look&mdash;somebody
with a warrant."</p>

<p>He hated to frighten the poor child, but it had to be done. He
had learned the most effective way to deal with her.</p>

<p>"Look through my things!" she cried, staring at him.</p>

<p>"Yes; if you haven't it&mdash;as you say you haven't&mdash;you
can have no objection&mdash;and truly, if I don't, some one else
will."</p>

<p>"Go ahead," she said, and sat watching him.</p>

<p>In a perfunctory fashion, Hutchins pulled open a few drawers of
her writing desk and work table. He wasn't really looking, he was
watching her face hoping to learn from its expression what way to
turn.</p>

<p>Nor was he in error. She fell easily into his trap. With no
thought of being studied, Pearl Jane did all he could hope for.
When he was looking in some places, she drew a long breath of
contentment and satisfaction. Again, her breath would come quickly,
her eyes turn dark with apprehension and her tightly clasped hands
tremble.</p>

<p>So, he knew at last, that what he sought was&mdash;must be, in
an upper drawer of an old secretary. He reached up for it, and as
he saw the look of utter despair on her face, he pulled out the
whole drawer, a small one, and lifted it down.</p>

<p>But his find was not a "lucky piece"&mdash;instead it was
something far more gruesome. For, wadded up in a corner of the
drawer was a long white kid glove&mdash;stained on the fingertips
with a brownish tinge&mdash;unmistakably human blood.</p>

<p>It did not need her&nbsp;breat-broken cry of dismay to tell him
he had discovered her secret, and he came slowly toward her.</p>

<p>"Miss Cutler&mdash;is this yours?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;oh, no."</p>

<p>"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Of course I'm sure!" indignantly.</p>

<p>"Then whose is it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"Why is it here?"</p>

<p>She braced up. Whatever the reason&mdash;perhaps sheer
desperation&mdash;she sat up straight, drew herself together, and
answered:</p>

<p>"I found it on the floor near the body of Mrs. Barham."</p>

<p>"When you leaned over her?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I did lean over to see if she were dead or alive. I was
horribly frightened, but I thought it my duty to see that, at
least."</p>

<p>"And she was dead?"</p>

<p>"I think so. I tried to feel her heart, but I
couldn't&mdash;there was such an elaborate fringe and tinsel on the
bodice. So, I&mdash;well, Mr. Hutchins, I think I rather lost my
head. I had never seen a dead person before&mdash;like that, I
mean&mdash;and I don't know what I did. I grabbed the
glove&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>I think I had a half formed fear that it might belong to some
one I knew&mdash;that crime might be suspected&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But it's a woman's glove&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know. But is a woman never guilty of crime?"</p>

<p>"Murder?"</p>

<p>"It has been known, hasn't it? And isn't the weapon that was
used&mdash;a heavy weight, more the thing a woman would use? Can
you imagine a man throwing that at a woman?"</p>

<p>"Yes, more easily than I can imagine a woman doing it. You are
romancing, Miss Cutler&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am not! I am telling you the truth. I was scared, even dazed
at the awful situation, and I took the glove&mdash;brought it home
and hid it&mdash;all because of that vague fear that it might
implicate some one I care for&mdash;a dear friend&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Miss Vallon?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," impatiently. "But I learned that she had her
gloves&mdash;both of them&mdash;and then I thought no more about
it. If that glove is of any importance, take it&mdash;I don't know
whose it is."</p>

<p>"I will take it. But don't think I can't read you! You are
trying to turn the conversation away from the main
theme&mdash;trying to turn suspicion away from the man you love.
Away from Thomas Locke. You suspect him yourself&mdash;but you want
to shield him. That is why you went to the dead woman. That is why
you bent down over her&mdash;You thought you would remove
incriminating evidence, if you could find any. You opened her
hand&mdash;the dead woman's hand, whether you found anything in it
or not. What did you expect to find?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," Pearl Jane was sullen now. She kept her eyes down,
her head turned away.</p>

<p>But, during the conversation, Hutchins's ever busy eyes had
found something else.</p>

<p>"Miss Cutler," he said, this time very suddenly, "was it the
scarab?"</p>

<p>Her frightened stare told him he had guessed right.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what scarab?" she breathed.</p>

<p>"Mr. Locke had a scarab&mdash;a lucky piece. Charley calls it a
Flyaway! That's what made me think of it&mdash;when I saw where you
have hidden the thing. And a wonderfully clever place! You are a
marvel!"</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you do know what I mean. If you don't&mdash;I'll show
you."</p>

<p>Unfastening his cuff-link, and pushing back his sleeve, Hutchins
thrust his arm into a globe of goldfish, and from among the little
stones at the bottom, he brought up a stone scarab.</p>

<p>"A valuable one," he commented, looking at its Egyptian
inscription. "And more valuable, I suppose, for its lucky powers.
And the dead woman had this in her hand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she did," said Pearl Jane, angrily, "make the most of
it!"</p>

<p>"I most certainly shall," said Hutchins, gravely, and with the
scarab and the stained glove both in his possession, he went
away.</p>

<h2><b><a name="Chapter_14" id="Chapter_14">Chapter 14</a><br>
Marcia Selden's Opinions</b>
</h2>

<p>Dickson&nbsp;listened to Hutchins's story with a very sober
expression.</p>

<p>"I may be wrong," the Inspector said, finally, "but I certainly
do believe that girl did it. For, on the face of it, Hutchins, what
else is there to think? She is in love with Locke&mdash;that's
sure. I'm not so sure he is in love with her&mdash;and you know, 'a
woman scorned,' is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is the devil and all. But I can't see that slip of a youngster
killing anybody."</p>

<p>"It was done on a sudden impulse&mdash;that's clear. Nobody
throws a heavy bronze weight premeditatedly. It looks like a
woman's deed to me. Of course, this presupposes an
acquaintance&mdash;probably more than that&mdash;between Mrs.
Barham and the artist. But we have to suppose that&mdash;there's no
other assumption that allows for her coming there at all."</p>

<p>"She could have come out of the usual curiosity of the upper
circles to see what the Bohemians do at their revels. That's not an
unknown proposition."</p>

<p>"I see you're prejudiced in the girl's favor. I can't blame you
for that. But we must look facts in the face. The visiting lady had
in her hand the lucky piece which is evidently greatly prized by
Locke. He even sent a note to Charley to find it for him. Now, we
know that Mrs. Barham had it in her hand when she died. Maybe she
was killed for it."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's too fantastic!"</p>

<p>"Not at all. You don't know what that thing may mean to these
people. Haven't you read stories about&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I know. The Idol's Eye&mdash;a great ruby or emerald
stolen from a Persian god&mdash;but those things were real gems.
This scarab is a curio&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Scarabs&mdash;certain ones&mdash;are more valuable than any
gems. However, that doesn't matter&mdash;if it's the superstitious
value of the thing&mdash;which I am sure it is. Now, say that Mrs.
Barham was mixed up with Locke, say that Miss Cutler was jealous of
her, say that Mrs. Barham did steal the scarab&mdash;isn't it at
least possible that the girl, unable to get it back, and frenzied
by rage and love both, picked up the bronze and threw it almost
involuntarily, of course not meaning to kill her?"</p>

<p>"It is possible, certainly," Hutchins looked anxious, "but I
wish we could find some other theory."</p>

<p>"I wish we could, too. But what else is there? Then you see, if
the girl did it, and if Locke knows it, why, that's the reason he
has lit out. He's afraid he'll be questioned, and he's shielding
that girl."</p>

<p>"That makes Locke in love with the girl."</p>

<p>"Very likely he is. Perhaps the other woman was an old
flame&mdash;well, I can't explain all the turns and twists of an
artist's love affair&mdash;but I still think it was the girl who
threw that book-end."</p>

<p>"People have no business to have such things around," growled
Hutchins.</p>

<p>"Don't be silly. In a moment of blind rage, anything handy
becomes a weapon. Look how often a paper-cutter is used to stab,
merely because it lies ready to hand. Let's see the scarab,
again."</p>

<p>With the air of a wise owl Dickson studied the ancient
stone.</p>

<p>"I don't know much about these things in a scholarly way," he
frankly admitted, "but I do know this. If this thing is a real
tip-topper among scarabs&mdash;and I think it is&mdash;a
connoisseur would know all about it, and probably know this
identical specimen. They're all recorded&mdash;the famous
ones."</p>

<p>Hutchins looked surprised at this erudition on Dickson's
part.</p>

<p>"Then we can trace it," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;if it is a famous one. Take it up to the Metropolitan
Museum, that's the quickest and surest way to find out. Now, as to
the glove&mdash;and there's another sure fire clue. Haven't you an
odd glove in your collection of trinkets found on or near the
spot?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;and it seems to be a mate to this one. But that
doesn't prove anything."</p>

<p>"Not alone, but in connection with the fact that Miss Cutler hid
this glove, and the other was found right where she was seen to
be&mdash;well, it's decidedly cumulative evidence! Now, what we
want is some&mdash;even one connecting link&mdash;between the
artist and Mrs. Barham. Until we get that&mdash;why, any other man
at the party may have been the villain of this tale, instead of
Locke."</p>

<p>"It was his scarab."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;that's so&mdash;and doubtless the whole tragedy
centers around him. But, we must get a thread of connection,
somehow. If you should go to Mr. Barham again&mdash;or to that
Nelson&mdash;wouldn't they tell you if they have run across
anything?"</p>

<p>"I should think so&mdash;but Mr. Barham is getting queer about
it all. At first he was ready to move heaven and earth to learn how
or why his wife came to go to that party. Also he offered the
reward, you know, for Locke. Also, he was keen to find and punish
the murderer. But now, he's&mdash;well, sort of apathetic. Doesn't
seem to care what we do, so long as we don't bother him."</p>

<p>"What does he do&mdash;with his time?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Nothing especial, I guess. But he has taken up
some of the more important matters of his business&mdash;he's a big
consulting engineer, you know. He canceled everything at
first&mdash;but he's picking them up again."</p>

<p>"That's natural and to be expected. Doubtless they're most
important deals, and he really has to give them his attention. And
why shouldn't he?"</p>

<p>"Why, indeed? Well, I'll see him to-day, and Nelson, and I hope
to goodness they'll have something to tell me that will turn you
off the track of that poor girl."</p>

<p>"I hope so, Hutch, but don't let your sympathy for Beauty in
distress blind your eyes to facts and evidence."</p>

<p>With a shrug of his broad shoulders, Hutchins went off, hoping
against hope that he could clear Pearl Jane. It was too absurd to
suspect that pretty little thing&mdash;but, as Dickson had put it,
there was a chance that she had lost her temper, and had thrown the
missile&mdash;women were uncertain at best.</p>

<p>And Hutchins had to admit to himself that Pearl Jane was
exceedingly uncertain. He had seen her gentle, pathetic,
sweet&mdash;and then sullen and obstinate&mdash;all in the same
five minutes. Yes, hers was a peculiar personality.</p>

<p>After due deliberation he concluded to go to see Andrew Barham
before he saw Nelson. He didn't know himself just why he made this
decision, but it was really due to a lurking hope that it would
turn out better for the girl that way.</p>

<p>By telephoning, he learned that Barham was not at his office
that day, but at his home. This was by no means unusual, and
Hutchins started off for the Fifth Avenue house.</p>

<p>He was admitted and ushered into a sort of family living-room,
where, to his surprise he found Mrs. Selden as well as her
son-in-law.</p>

<p>"I asked to have you brought here, Mr. Hutchins," the lady said,
looking at him with a condescending interest, as if he were some
necessary but unattractive piece of furniture. "I desire a few
words with you myself."</p>

<p>She paused, perhaps expecting some burst of delighted surprise
at this honor, but Hutchins merely made a slight bow of
acquiescence.</p>

<p>"What have you done toward the finding of my daughter's
murderer?" she asked, and her commanding air seemed to imply that
she expected a full and satisfactory report of the police
proceedings.</p>

<p>Mrs. Selden sat bolt upright, in a high-backed chair. Her gown
was most fashionably made, though of the deepest mourning that
could be devised. The hem of heavy crape reached nearly to her
waist line, and the crape bodice had such a high neck and such long
sleeves, that none of her throat and only her finger-tips could be
seen. Her white hair showed large ornamental hairpins of black dull
jet, and her handkerchief was as deeply black bordered as it is
possible for a handkerchief to be.</p>

<p>Very aristocratic and very imposing was her appearance and
manner, but Hutchins was by no means overcome with awe at her
grandeur.</p>

<p>"We have done all that we found to do, Madam," the detective
returned, speaking respectfully, but by no means humbly. "Rest
assured, the work is going on&mdash;but so far, the evidence is
slender and the clues are few."</p>

<p>"I am quite sure it is your fault if that is so," Mrs. Selden
spoke raspingly, "I doubt very much if your board or company or
whatever is it, has put on sufficient men or sufficiently skillful
men."</p>

<p>"Mother," Barham remonstrated, "Mr. Hutchins is himself the
principal detective on the case, and his record is a fine
one&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Will you hush, Andrew! I do wish I might be permitted to say
half a dozen words without interruption! I know you want to do the
talking yourself, but let me remind you that Madeleine was my
daughter, as well as your wife. And, I may add that I am far more
deeply concerned and anxious about the discovery of her murderer
than you appear to be. Mr. Hutchins, have you questioned everybody
that was at that infamous revel?"</p>

<p>"If you refer to Mr. Locke's studio party, yes, Madam, they have
all been questioned."</p>

<p>"And you made no arrest?"</p>

<p>"No information was received from the guests that warranted any
arrest."</p>

<p>"Ah, you couldn't have questioned very closely&mdash;or very
intelligently. For it is impossible that my daughter should have
gone there without knowing some one&mdash;somebody who was
present."</p>

<p>"That seemed to be the case. Wherefore, we assumed that your
daughter must have been acquainted with Mr. Locke himself."</p>

<p>"With Mr. Locke! My daughter know a common artist! Never! She
might have gone there to see about having her portrait
painted&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Locke is not a portrait painter."</p>

<p>"Perhaps some other painter was there who does do portraits of
society ladies."</p>

<p>"I can think of none such," and Hutchins hastily sized up this
new idea in his mind. But it seemed to promise nothing.</p>

<p>"She would scarcely attend a party where she knew no one, merely
to make arrangements for a portrait," he said, as if thinking
aloud.</p>

<p>"Do not presume to say what my daughter would or would not do,
sir. That is outside your province. Remain within your own rightful
boundaries of thought and speech."</p>

<p>Hutchins looked at her. He had never been treated quite like
this before. And, apparently, Andrew Barham didn't dare call his
soul his own, even in his own home.</p>

<p>But Barham was by no means afraid of his mother-in-law. His
hesitancy to rouse her temper was partly because he so hated the
scenes she made and partly because he really felt a tenderness for
the mother of his wife.</p>

<p>Still, he couldn't quite allow this. So he said:</p>

<p>"Please, Mother, try to remember that Mr. Hutchins represents
the dignity of the law, and so, even aside from his own merits,
commands our respect and courtesy."</p>

<p>Marcia Selden took him up.</p>

<p>"Andrew!" she exclaimed, "will you never cease scolding me? You
omit no chance to reprimand me, to hold me up to the scorn of
others. Shouldn't you think, Mr. Hutchins, that a man would be a
little kindly inclined to one who is the mother of his wife? But,
no, all Mr. Barham ever says to me is by way of fault finding and
reproach!"</p>

<p>The black handkerchief was pressed against the tearful eyes, and
Hutchins, not feeling privileged to side with either, said
nothing.</p>

<p>Barham repressed an angry impulse, and said, with a kind but
long-suffering air:</p>

<p>"Not quite that, Mother. I never forget our
relationship&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you'd like to forget it! You'd like to sever it! You wish
I'd go away and live by myself."</p>

<p>"I don't admit that&mdash;but let's not discuss it now. Mr.
Hutchins is here on business, I think. Perhaps you will leave us
alone for a little&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That I won't! And have you cook up some scheme by which the
crime will be glossed over and forgotten, and the mystery of
Maddy's death will never be solved."</p>

<p>Hutchins broke in then with a definite determination.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Selden," he said, "if you will let me, I will give you an
idea of what the police have done and are doing."</p>

<p>"Are there any new developments?" Barham asked.</p>

<p>"There are," Hutchins replied. And then, seeing no reason Mrs.
Selden shouldn't know the details as well as Barham himself,
Hutchins told the whole story of the scarab.</p>

<p>He told of the mysterious note Charley had received, asking him
to find the "lucky piece." He told of Charley's futile search, and
subsequent call on the detective for help. He told of Charley's
description of seeing Pearl Jane bending over Mrs. Barham and
taking something from her hand.</p>

<p>Andrew Barham listened with an inscrutable face and immovable
countenance. He sat with folded arms, his eyes intently fixed on
Hutchins's face.</p>

<p>Mrs. Selden, on the contrary, was nervous and excited. She said
little, for, when she interrupted, Hutchins peremptorily bade her
be silent.</p>

<p>Also, she, too, was deeply interested. She twisted her
handkerchief until it was a mere wisp, she picked at her gown, and
she now and then broke into weeping.</p>

<p>But Barham didn't look at her. He sat listening to Hutchins,
saying no word, but seeming like a man in a trance.</p>

<p>Hutchins went on with the tale, and came to the scene at the
home of Miss Cutler. He told of finding the scarab in the goldfish
bowl, where she had so cleverly hidden it.</p>

<p>"Have you the scarab?" Barham asked, speaking for the first time
during the recital. "Is it really valuable?"</p>

<p>"You know scarabs, Drew," Mrs. Selden said, "you brought some
home from Egypt, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes; Mother; but I'm not a real connoisseur. Mine are good
specimens&mdash;but not by any means famous ones. Is Locke's, Mr.
Hutchins?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I'm going to take it to the Museum, and have it
sized up. Want to see it? I doubt if it's what you call
famous."</p>

<p>He took the stone beetle from his pocket and handed it over.</p>

<p>Andrew Barham examined it with interest; first courteously
offering it for Mrs. Selden's inspection. But she merely glanced at
it, saying, "It looks like all the others to me."</p>

<p>"I don't think it is a King's scarab," Barham observed as he
examined the thing; "I'll just take it to my library a minute,
while I look it up in a book I have."</p>

<p>He was gone but a moment, and returned saying, "As I
thought&mdash;it is a good one, but not a royal scarab. Doubtless,
as you intimated, the value to Locke lay in its
associations&mdash;or perhaps a superstition&mdash;rather than in
its money value."</p>

<p>He gave one more glance at the stone he held and then handed it
back to Hutchins, who wrapped it in its bit of paper and returned
it to his pocket.</p>

<p>Then Hutchins told them about the stained glove he had found
hidden in Miss Cutler's room, and at last his hearers began to
realize that the detective was leading up to the announcement that
the police suspected the girl of the murder. He had told the story
slowly, for he wanted to catch, if possible, any facial expression
or any involuntary exclamation that would hint at a knowledge on
the part of husband or mother regarding Madeleine Barham's
acquaintance with Locke.</p>

<p>But he could get nothing of the sort, and, though his quick eyes
and ears were eagerly waiting, there was positively nothing to be
learned from Barham's stony calm, or from Mrs. Selden's nervous
agitation.</p>

<p>And so, at the end of his recital, he merely asked Barham his
opinion as to the possible guilt of Miss Cutler.</p>

<p>"Of course she did it!" cried Mrs. Selden, not giving Barham a
chance to reply. "Could anything be clearer? I don't know why you
haven't arrested her already! It's so palpably true&mdash;she was
jealous&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't go so fast. Mother," Barham said quietly. "How could this
unknown girl be jealous of our Maddy? You're not imagining, are
you, that Maddy had a vulgar intrigue with some artist? I can't
imagine any such case as that&mdash;if you can!"</p>

<p>Marcia Selden was silenced for once. She could easily imagine
the girl's jealousy, but she, too, was at a loss to apply that
jealousy to her Madeleine.</p>

<p>"Nothing can ever make me believe that my wife knew these people
socially," Barham declared. "I cannot understand her presence there
at all, but whatever her errand down there was, it was something
other than social. Don't ask me to explain her elaborate
costume&mdash;quite evidently prepared for the occasion. I don't
know anything about that. Maybe it was mere idle curiosity of a
society woman to see a bit of studio life. But it is impossible
that Mrs. Barham was there as a social guest."</p>

<p>His arms were still folded across his chest, his gaze was still
cold and direct, and Hutchins saw at once that, whatever the truth
of the matter might be, Andrew Barham believed implicitly in the
statements he made.</p>

<p>"That is true," Marcia Selden agreed. "I think, Andrew, you
might exert yourself a little more to learn what took Maddy there.
But I must agree with you"&mdash;she seemed to hate to do
so&mdash;"that my daughter never went there as a guest. I mean as
one of the social circle there. She had a later engagement at the
home of a friend, so, you see, she merely stopped at the studio
place,&nbsp;<i>en route</i>. Either it was to see about a portrait,
or to satisfy a bit of curiosity&mdash;or both."</p>

<p>"Could it have been in any way connected with Mrs.
Barham's&mdash;er&mdash;Bridge habits&mdash;"</p>

<p>Alarmed lest Hutchins tell something disparaging to Maddy, which
he hoped to keep from the knowledge of Mrs. Selden, Barham rose
suddenly, and said:</p>

<p>"That reminds me, Mr. Hutchins, I have an important engagement.
If Mrs. Selden will excuse us, will you walk along with
me&mdash;toward my destination?"</p>

<p>The detective agreed, and once outside the door, Barham told him
of the ruse.</p>

<p>"You know much concerning my wife's Bridge debts," Barham said,
"and, if necessary, it will have to be made public. But unless it
is&mdash;or, until it is, I want to keep it from Mrs. Selden. It
would distress her beyond measure."</p>

<p>Hutchins marveled at the character of a man who would be so
careful of the sensibilities of a woman who so trampled on his own;
but he only said:</p>

<p>"I can't see now, Mr. Barham, the slightest connection between
Mrs. Barham's Bridge cronies and the tragedy of the studio. Unless
such comes to light, her Bridge affairs need never reach the ears
of the public."</p>

<p>Their ways diverged then, Hutchins going to the Museum to
inquire about the value of the scarab.</p>

<p>The authorities there told him practically the same as Barham
had said. It was a genuine antique scarab&mdash;and was worth
perhaps a hundred dollars. But it was by no means a museum piece or
an especially fine specimen of its period.</p>

<p>So, Hutchins concluded, Locke valued it mostly for some
sentiment or association. This, however, had no bearing on its
value as evidence against Pearl Jane Cutler.</p>

<p>That young woman put in a pretty miserable day. She knew not
whether she would be accused of murder&mdash;or being an accessory
after the fact&mdash;whatever that meant! or what would happen to
her. She confabbed with Kate Vallon, and then she went to Henry
Post for advice and counsel.</p>

<p>They could say little, except to express sympathy and
indignation at the suspicion cast on her.</p>

<p>"You didn't do it, P. J., did you?" Post asked.</p>

<p>"No," she said, dully&mdash;"but if I had, I should say I
hadn't."</p>

<p>These artists seemed not to have very deep susceptibilities.
Both Post and Rodman Jarvis, though good pals of Locke's, had
practically no help to offer Pearl Jane. In their circle, every man
was for himself&mdash;and every woman also. They were not
hard-hearted&mdash;they were merely cold-blooded and absorbed in
their own affairs.</p>

<p>"They'll never arrest the kid," Post said to Jarvis. "Why worry?
And, for all I know, there may have been some affair between Locke
and the Barham woman. I keep out of such messes all I can."</p>

<p>And Jarvis, though ready to do all he could for Locke in his
absence, had no wish to take up Pearl Jane's burdens.</p>

<p>Kate Vallon was devoted to the girl, and she wept with her and
gave sound and really good advice, which included, among other
things, a sudden and secret disappearance.</p>

<p>"It's the only thing," Kate said; "that's what Tommy did, and
you must go. I'll help you off, and I know just the place for you
to go."</p>

<p>Rut Pearl Jane doggedly refused to do this. No reason would she
give, and Kate retired in dudgeon.</p>

<p>Left to herself, Pearl Jane moped and worried, and at last,
about ten o'clock, she began to think of going to bed.</p>

<p>And then her telephone bell rang.</p>

<p>"Hello," she said, listlessly, and an answering voice said
"Hello."</p>

<p>Like a wave of revivifying joy, the sound went to her heart, and
softly, as if half afraid, she breathed&mdash;"Tommy!"</p>

<h2><b><a name="Chapter_15" id="Chapter_15">Chapter 15</a><br>

</h2>

<p>"Yes, little girl&mdash;it's Tommy. Are you alone?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;where are you?"</p>

<p>"Never mind&mdash;it's all right. Now, listen, child&mdash;is
that story true, about your taking the scarab from&mdash;from her
hand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Tommy."</p>

<p>"Why did you do it?"</p>

<p>"It was yours and you cared a lot for it. She had no right to
it&mdash;had she?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;no. But I fear it's going to get you into
trouble."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I am in trouble. They say I killed her."</p>

<p>"Did you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Tommy! Don't! How can you say such a thing?"</p>

<p>"Look here, dear, before we go any further&mdash;do you think I
killed her?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;I don't know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you think so?"</p>

<p>"I did think so. I saw you run away&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's enough. Then, at least, that proves you didn't do
it!"</p>

<p>"Why, I just told you I didn't."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, so you did&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How queer you are, Tommy. Aren't you ever coming back?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I think not."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you care? Pearl Jane, would you care if you never saw me
again?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I'd care! But you wouldn't!"</p>

<p>"Oh, wouldn't I! Well&mdash;but, dear, the whole thing is such a
mess. I wish I could see you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, why can't you? Oh, Tommy, tell me something! Are you
bald?"</p>

<p>"Bald! Lord, no! What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Don't you wear a wig?"</p>

<p>"I do not! Oh, you dear little girl, the sound of your voice
makes me long to see you&mdash;I never knew before how much I
cared&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You didn't care&mdash;the night of&mdash;of the
masquerade."</p>

<p>"I did&mdash;oh, Pearl Jane, I did&mdash;but&mdash;I didn't know
it."</p>

<p>"And I don't know it now. I think you're cruel to tantalize me
like this&mdash;and I'm going to hang up."</p>

<p>"No, don't&mdash;oh, wait a minute. What shall I do? Look here,
Pearl Jane, I don't know when I can telephone again. Perhaps I can
manage it all right&mdash;but if these detectives take to watching
your wire&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good-by, Tommy."</p>

<p>"Same little saucy thing&mdash;aren't you. Pearl
Jane&mdash;listen&mdash;dear. If I tell you I love you&mdash;can
you trust me for all else?"</p>

<p>"Yes! yes!" joyfully.</p>

<p>"You won't lose faith in me&mdash;whatever happens?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no I won't."</p>

<p>"Then just trust me&mdash;dear. I can't explain now&mdash;it may
be a long time&mdash;are you sure you can trust me if you don't
hear anything&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Forever&mdash;if need be."</p>

<p>"You darling! Now about the scarab business. Will you do as I
advise you?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;then, dear, tell the exact truth&mdash;to everybody
and in every particular. If you suspect I killed the lady, and if
you are asked, say so. If the gloves are yours, say so. If you know
anything about the scarab, tell it. Tell everything, but always
tell it the same. This will be easy, if you tell the truth every
time."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;Tommy, they will arrest me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, they won't. Don't be afraid of that. Shall I tell you why
they are suspecting&mdash;or pretending to suspect you?"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"They don't really think you are guilty, dear, but they think
that by accusing you&mdash;they can get hold of me. They know I
love you&mdash;I believe they knew it before I knew it myself!"</p>

<p>"Didn't you know it the night of the party?"</p>

<p>"No! Hadn't an idea of such a thing! It's come on
suddenly&mdash;and I've a bad attack!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Tommy&mdash;I want you!"</p>

<p>"Hush, dear&mdash;don't talk like that&mdash;I can't stand it.
Pearl Jane, there's much more to this whole dreadful business than
you can imagine. Or than anyone else imagines. So, keep up a good
heart, and&mdash;what did you promise to do?"</p>

<p>"Trust you, Tommy."</p>

<p>"And do you?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;until I see you&mdash;and after
that&mdash;forever."</p>

<p>"Sweetheart! Good-by."</p>

<p>The voice ceased&mdash;and, in a sort of daze, Pearl Jane hung
up her receiver.</p>

<p>What did it all mean? Where was Tommy? Why couldn't he come to
her? Unless&mdash;no, she knew&mdash;she knew he was not guilty.
Her Tommy guilty?</p>

<p>And then all thought of guilt or trouble was lost and forgotten
in the blissful realization that he
was&nbsp;<i>her</i>&nbsp;Tommy!</p>

<p>Was ever woman in this fashion wooed?</p>

<p>She wondered if any other girl in the world had ever had a
proposal over the telephone. Doubtless such a thing had happened,
but not like hers! She was sure that her experience was
unique&mdash;and, at any rate, it made her very happy. Now, she
must plan her life.</p>

<p>She must not be afraid of the police&mdash;Tommy had said so.
She must stay right there in these same rooms&mdash;Tommy might
telephone again.</p>

<p>But whether he did or didn't, whether she heard from him again
in a week or not for a year&mdash;she would always trust him.</p>

<p>For&mdash;he loved her! He had told her so. Oh&mdash;when she
should see him&mdash;she'd take a sweet revenge for all this
mystery!</p>

<p>And she was to tell the truth. This was a real relief, for Pearl
Jane was not a very successful liar, and she was apt to forget and
get her stories mixed up. But here after&mdash;Tommy said&mdash;she
was to tell the truth&mdash;and she was not to fear.</p>

<p>Must she tell of this conversation with him?</p>

<p>That was a problem. But she fell asleep on the decision that she
would tell the truth if asked&mdash;but if not, she had no
intention of sharing her beautiful heart-secret with anybody just
yet.</p>

<p>It was the next day that a man came to Andrew Barham's house
with a request that he might have an interview, if only a few
moments.</p>

<p>Barham received him in his little library, curious to know if
any news regarding the mystery might be forthcoming.</p>

<p>"My name is Locke," the caller said. "I'm the brother of the
artist who has disappeared."</p>

<p>"That's very interesting," Barham said, non-committally; "what
can I do for you?"</p>

<p>"You can do this, Mr. Barham. You can use your influence to get
the authorities to turn over to me any belongings or estate my
brother had. I'm his only heir&mdash;but Tom lived so much to
himself, and so quiet-like, I've no letters or such, to prove my
claim. Now, if an influential man like yourself, sir, would just
say a word to the police, they'd give me poor Tom's clothes and
furniture and suchlike. I don't want anything they'd be likely to
need for evidence&mdash;but I'm a poor man, sir, and I could do
with a bit more. Especially when it belonged to my own
brother."</p>

<p>"So you're Locke's brother." Barham looked at him appraisingly.
"Are you older than he?"</p>

<p>"Only a year or so older. We were boys together."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, of course. Now, where did you live, as boys?"</p>

<p>"In Kansas City."</p>

<p>"And your father's name was?"</p>

<p>"John&mdash;John Locke. He was a minister, sir."</p>

<p>"Oh, he was? Well, Mr. Locke, one more question. What was your
mother's maiden name?"</p>

<p>"Hester&mdash;Hester Miller."</p>

<p>"A Kansas City woman?"</p>

<p>"Yes sir." The caller began to fidget a little under this direct
catechism, and Andrew Barham smiled.</p>

<p>Then he said, "I think there's some mistake,
Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Locke. Your brother cannot be the artist we are
interested in. You see, the artist, Tommy Locke, was born in
Massachusetts. His mother's maiden name was Jeannette Fessenden,
and his father was a fire-insurance agent. So I will ask you to
excuse me, and bid you a very good-day."</p>

<p>Barham turned back to his desk and took up his pen.</p>

<p>"But, sir&mdash;" the man began, "won't you please&mdash;"</p>

<p>Barham turned back and looked at him. "I said good-day," he
reminded him, and with his penhandle, he pointed toward the
door.</p>

<p>The man departed, and strange to say was never heard of again by
Barham or the police either.</p>

<p>"Good game&mdash;but it didn't work," Andrew Barham advised
himself.</p>

<p>Nick Nelson came in later.</p>

<p>"I've been trying to find that brother of Locke's," he said, "I
thought I might get a line on the artist through him.</p>

<p>Barham laughed, the first time Nick had seen him laugh since the
tragedy.</p>

<p>"You'll probably never see him again," he said, and then he
related the incident as it happened.</p>

<p>"Why were you so sure he was an impostor?" Nelson asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, he had all the earmarks of the professional vulture. They
run around to find people who die or disappear without relatives,
and then they try to claim the property. Sometimes they get away
with it, and sometimes they don't."</p>

<p>"What did you tell him all those other names for? Did you make
them up?"</p>

<p>"Of course. I did it to prove myself right. If he had been
Locke's brother, don't you suppose he would have insisted on his
own genealogy? He made up his ancestors' names, so I had an equal
right to make up another set for the missing man."</p>

<p>"The police cottoned to him, because he had some gold
teeth&mdash;and so has Tommy Locke," said Nick.</p>

<p>"Absurd. We aren't born with gold teeth in our mouths&mdash;I
suppose heredity might make two brothers lose the same
teeth&mdash;but, well if the police need him in their business, I'm
sorry I sent him off."</p>

<p>"No; I fancy they owe you a debt of gratitude. Another queer
thing has turned up. You know that scarab?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I have seen it. Nothing very valuable."</p>

<p>"No; so I'm told. But the little girl says it has been
changed."</p>

<p>"Changed&mdash;what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"She says the scarab Locke owned was a Royal scarab&mdash;from a
King's tomb. And, the one Hutchins has now, the girl says, is quite
another stone."</p>

<p>"Does the girl know about such things?"</p>

<p>"I don't think she is a connoisseur at all, but she probably
knows what Locke told her."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes&mdash;what Locke told her. But, Nick, isn't it
conceivable that Locke described his treasure as being of a higher
value than it really was? Can't you see him, desiring to impress
his artist friends, claiming a royal history for a scarab that was
merely a poor commoner?"</p>

<p>"That's easy, too. But the girl declares she knows that the one
Hutchins has now&mdash;is not the one she gave him."</p>

<p>"That girl seems bound to make trouble. What's she like,
Nick?"</p>

<p>"Lord, Andrew, I've described her to you half a dozen times.
Like an Art Student&mdash;of course. Big eyes, bobbed hair, little
turn-up nose, and a skin like a satin rose-leaf&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold hard, Nick, you sound like an interested observer!"</p>

<p>"No; I'm telling you the truth. You don't see that sort of skin
among our sort of women."</p>

<p>"Could be, if they didn't overdo the rouge pots."</p>

<p>"No, it's different. Healthier. Well, as for the rest, she's a
little thing&mdash;and she dresses in that studio style, but she
gets away with it. And&mdash;she's nobody's fool."</p>

<p>"Just what do you mean by that?"</p>

<p>"I mean she's sensible and straightforward&mdash;though I
believe if you'd know her well, she's full of the
devil&mdash;capers, I mean. She has a jolly little gleam in her
eye&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, considering you saw her only once, at the Inquest, you
took her in rather completely."</p>

<p>"Do quit fumbling in that desk drawer, Drew! What is the matter
with you? Are you hunting for a letter or something?"</p>

<p>"No," and Barham let go the papers, and pushed the drawer shut.
"Go on, Nick. You're here for something special. Out with it."</p>

<p>"All right&mdash;out it is. The truth is, Drew, Hutchins thinks
you exchanged those scarabs. He thinks when you took Locke's into
the other room to look it up in your book, that you substituted a
less valuable stone."</p>

<p>"Oh, he does, does he? Well, old chap, what do you think? Am I
given to petty thievery? Would I be likely to steal a scarab from a
poor artist&mdash;or from the police?"</p>

<p>"Of course not, Drew, don't be silly. But I thought maybe you
could help trace it. I think that somehow Locke has managed to get
it back and he has made the substitution."</p>

<p>"You're sure there was a substitution?"</p>

<p>"It looks that way. The girl described minutely the design on
Locke's scarab&mdash;she says he did consider it his lucky
piece&mdash;and the figures on the one Hutchins has now are quite
dissimilar."</p>

<p>"My dear Nick, no one who hasn't studied scarabs can tell one
from another&mdash;least of all, a little bob-haired girl with a
turn-up nose. Why not suspect the Chinaman. He had the job of
finding the thing, I'm told. Say he found it, and&mdash;those
Orientals are tricky, and they know about curios&mdash;say he made
the substitution. How's that?"</p>

<p>"I don't think he has seen it?"</p>

<p>"But you don't know that he hasn't."</p>

<p>"No. Oh, well, I dare say it's the same old scarab. Also I guess
they'll arrest the little girl soon, and then there'll be a
sensation. Somehow I hate to see her arrested. A mere
child&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How can they arrest her? They've no real evidence."</p>

<p>"They hold that they have. The Chinaman saw her bending over the
body. He saw her take the scarab, which afterward was found hidden
in her room. Also, the pair of stained gloves are her size. Also
the bronze book-end has been photographed for finger
prints&mdash;and it shows the prints of Miss Cutler's fingers."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it!" Andrew Barham sat up straight, and spoke
so strongly that Nelson looked at him curiously.</p>

<p>"Why, Drew, what's the great excitement?"</p>

<p>"Only that I'm a champion of women&mdash;all women, as you know.
And I think it's outrageous to arrest that girl&mdash;almost a
child, you tell me&mdash;for a crime of that sort!"</p>

<p>"Don't say 'of that sort' for it's just the sort of weapon a
woman would use."</p>

<p>"But why,&nbsp;<i>why</i>&nbsp;would that girl kill Maddy?
Why&mdash;answer me that!"</p>

<p>"Good Lord, I can't answer that! If I could, I'd have the whole
problem solved. <i>Will</i> you stop fumbling in that drawer? If
you've lost a paper, hunt for it&mdash;do. But quit poking
aimlessly about among the old documents."</p>

<p>Again Barham slammed the drawer shut.</p>

<p>"There's no reason why that girl could possibly have killed
Madeleine, unless it was jealousy. Now, I hold she couldn't have
been jealous of my wife, for my wife had no knowledge of those
people at all&mdash;she had no acquaintance down there."</p>

<p>"To your knowledge."</p>

<p>"To my knowledge, or outside it. I didn't live with Madeleine
all those years without knowing her whole mind&mdash;and she would
never have chummed with those people&mdash;never!"</p>

<p>"Maybe she went down there with some of our own
crowd&mdash;curiosity, you know. Maybe we can find out who went
with her. Have you tried?"</p>

<p>"I've asked a few of the women&mdash;but they won't
tell&mdash;if they know, which I doubt."</p>

<p>"Claudine would know."</p>

<p>"I've asked her, but she gave me no real information."</p>

<p>"Get her down here&mdash;now. I've a ghost of an idea that she
knows more than she has told."</p>

<p>The maid was sent for, and appeared, looking a little
scared.</p>

<p>"Don't be frightened, Claudine," Barham said, kindly. He
couldn't bear to see any woman troubled.</p>

<p>"Just a few questions, Claudine," Nelson began. "Tell us,
briefly, all you know of Madame's going to the masked ball."</p>

<p>"I know almost nothing. She had her costume made&mdash;perhaps a
week beforehand&mdash;not more."</p>

<p>"It was done hastily, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Madame usually gave more time than that to her
modiste."</p>

<p>"Then you think Mrs. Barham knew she was going fully a week
before the party."</p>

<p>"Yes, Monsieur."</p>

<p>"And during that week she didn't mention the party to you?"</p>

<p>"Not once. Nor to any one. Not to Madame Selden, nor to Madame
Gardner, who was here once in my presence."</p>

<p>"And she said nothing of it to Mr. Barham?"</p>

<p>"Not in my presence."</p>

<p>"Then, now think very carefully, Claudine, you never heard her
speak of it to any one&mdash;not over the telephone, even?"</p>

<p>"No"; but a telltale flush that reddened the maid's cheeks
aroused Nelson's suspicions.</p>

<p>"Tell the truth," he commanded, sternly. "You do know of some
one&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I will tell&mdash;it is perhaps my duty."</p>

<p>"Yes, Claudine, tell what you know," Barham assisted her.</p>

<p>"Well, then, the night of the&nbsp;<i>Bal
Masque</i>&mdash;Madame Sayre came to see Madame, and they sent me
from the room while they talked. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course, Claudine, you listened," Nelson said, in a
matter-of-fact way. "Well, what did you hear?"</p>

<p>"It is not my habit to listen&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, of course not&mdash;we understand all that. Go on, now,
and we'll forgive your listening, if you tell exactly what you
heard."</p>

<p>"But I heard so little. Madame was very secret with her message,
and Madame Sayre was equally careful. I heard almost nothing of
their talk. But I did hear my Madame say to Madame Sayre that she
was going to the&nbsp;<i>Bal Masque</i>&nbsp;and she did tell her
where it was to be."</p>

<p>"And was Madame Sayre surprised?" Nelson asked.</p>

<p>"That I can't say&mdash;I could hear so little. Indeed, I heard
but few actual words, but I did hear Washington Square&mdash;of
that I am sure."</p>

<p>"But Madame Barham did not tell you she was going there?"</p>

<p>"No, Monsieur Nelson, she did not. I have told all."</p>

<p>"You may go, Claudine," and the maid left the room.</p>

<p>"All of no use, Nick," Barham said, wearily. "I knew all that
before, practically, from Rosamond Sayre herself. Maddy sent for
her&mdash;to borrow some money. And Maddy brought influence to
bear&mdash;or, at least, I suppose she did. Rose didn't say
that&mdash;but she did say that she promised to take the money to
Maddy at Emmy Gardner's that evening. They were both going there to
play. Rosamond did go, and Maddy, of course, never showed up. So
Claudine gave us no news. Can't we drop the whole thing, Nick? I
mean, can't we get out of any active part in it? Of course, the
police&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, all right, Drew; but you asked me to help you look into
these things. You asked me to help you find the murderer of your
wife. You asked me to represent you in the matter, and use my
judgment as to what should be done so far as we had any choice of
procedure. I've done these things&mdash;I mean I've tried to do
them. I've used all the means at my disposal to accede to your
demands and now you're&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm what?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, exactly&mdash;but, you're queer&mdash;that's what
you are&mdash;queer."</p>

<p>"I dare say I am, Nick. Forgive me, old chap."</p>

<p>And then Barham dropped his head into his hands and sat for a
moment, looking so dejected and so despairing that Nelson was sorry
for him.</p>

<p>"No, forgive me, Drew. I know what awful burdens you have to
bear."</p>

<p>"Pshaw&mdash;I'm not whining. I have problems&mdash;but they
must be faced. I can face them. What I'd like, would be to run away
for a day or two and think things out by myself. How'd that
be?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;" Nelson hesitated, "don't go until after they've
settled their minds about that scarab business. You don't seem to
realize, Drew, they really think you took a rare one and returned
to Hutchins a much less valuable specimen."</p>

<p>"Aren't they coming to me with this tale? Aren't they going to
accuse me to my face?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think they are. What shall you say?"</p>

<p>"What can I say, but the truth?"</p>

<p>"And that is?"</p>

<p>"What do you think?"</p>

<p>"I think you exchanged the scarabs."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I did."</p>

<h2><b><a name="Chapter_16" id="Chapter_16">Chapter 16</a><br>
Lorimer Lane</b>
</h2>

<p>Nick Nelson&nbsp;was not an astute man&mdash;he was not even
sharp-sighted when it came to puzzling things out, but he had
unbounded faith in his friends and unflinching loyalty.</p>

<p>He accepted at its face value Barham's statement that he had
exchanged the scarabs. He didn't question him concerning the
matter, he only thought it over afterward and decided on his own
line of action.</p>

<p>This was neither more nor less than to put the matter up to an
expert. Nelson couldn't understand Barham&mdash;very well, then
somebody else should explain him.</p>

<p>From Nelson's point of view this was no disloyalty or treachery
to his friend, for, as he had reasoned it out, Barham was queer,
and if people were queer they must be investigated.</p>

<p>His faith in Barham was so absolute that though he knew the man
had exchanged a fine scarab for one of lesser value, he did not for
a single instant believe this meant any dishonesty or real
wrong-doing.</p>

<p>Had he been asked, he couldn't have said what he did believe
regarding the incident, but, he thought, there must be some logical
and satisfactory explanation for old Barham's deed. Maybe the fine
scarab was his and had been stolen from him&mdash;well, that did
seem a bit far-fetched&mdash;but, anyway, Drew Barham was all
right&mdash;and if he was so foolish as to let himself be suspected
of being wrong&mdash;then somebody must look after him.</p>

<p>Nick Nelson had had previous experiences of Barham's queerness,
and invariably it had turned out that he was shielding or assisting
somebody else. Anyway, it must be looked into by some one capable
of looking into it. Drew was getting too queer.</p>

<p>And so, Nick Nelson went to the office of Lorimer Lane and
enlisted the sympathies and then engaged the services of that
clever and well known detective.</p>

<p>"Use your own judgment," Nelson told him, "about letting Mr.
Barham know you are in the game. If you think best, be frank with
him&mdash;but if it seems more advisable, then just let him think
you're on the police side of the case."</p>

<p>"Are there two sides?" Lane asked. "I've only the newspaper
accounts to guide me, you know."</p>

<p>"Not two opposing sides," Nelson told him, "but of course the
police are trying to solve the mystery of Mrs. Barham's death and
of Locke's disappearance, while Mr. Barham&mdash;lately, at any
rate&mdash;is trying to hush up the whole affair. Now, the police
are interested in his scarab business&mdash;that I've just told you
about, and they think Mr. Barham is a thief. I know better&mdash;I
know that he changed these things for some good and sufficient
reason&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Can you suggest or imagine any good and sufficient reason?"</p>

<p>Lorimer Lane was not scoffing at Nelson's assumption, on the
contrary, he was seriously interested.</p>

<p>Middle-aged, reserved and rather taciturn, he was glad to take
hold of this strange case, and this new turn of Barham's regarding
the scarabs was both astonishing and intriguing.</p>

<p>"No, I can't&mdash;" Nelson confessed, "that's why I have come
to you. I know Andrew Barham as well as I know any man on earth,
and I know him to be incapable of dishonesty in any form. Yet, I
know when he told me he exchanged those scarabs, he did exchange
them. Now, I want you to find out why."</p>

<p>"On the face of it," Lane said, "it looks very much as if he
were shielding somebody at his own expense&mdash;that is, if you
are right in banking so securely on his honesty."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm right in that," Nick returned.</p>

<p>"Very well, I'll take up the matter. Now, Mr. Nelson, tell me
everything you know about it. Everything you can possibly think of
that has any connection with it."</p>

<p>And Nick Nelson spent the better part of two hours, detailing
all he knew, both from the police reports and from his personal
knowledge of the Barhams and their friends and acquaintances.</p>

<p>Lane was especially interested in anything concerning Tommy
Locke&mdash;perhaps because it was regarding that elusive gentleman
that Nelson's information was the least definite.</p>

<p>"He seems a harmless sort," Nick said; "not at all the kind of
man you think of as a murderer. A mediocre artist, a good pal, a
quiet sort of person generally. His servant adores him, his friends
all like him, and the little girl, who is supposed to be his
sweetheart, is desperately in love with him."</p>

<p>"She'll be a mine of information, then," Lane observed. "I'm
good at getting at the sweethearts."</p>

<p>"She's not so easy, though. For a young thing, and a demure,
innocent looking person, she has a lot of reserve force of
character that crops out unexpectedly. I don't know her personally,
you understand, though I've seen her, but Detective Hutchins has
told me a lot about her. Sometimes I believe he thinks she's mixed
up in the actual crime, and then again, I feel sure he's only
pretending to do so, by way of urging Locke to put in an appearance
to protect the girl."</p>

<p>"If Locke knows all that is going on, and doesn't come forward
to look after his sweetheart, he's a poor sort of chap."</p>

<p>"I think he's in communication with her, somehow. But she's so
uncommunicative, it's hard to tell."</p>

<p>"I'll find out where she stands," and Lane nodded his head in
assurance. "The hardest proposition to tackle is Andrew Barham
himself. From your description of him I fancy he can hold his own
against a detective's questioning."</p>

<p>"Yes, he can. But if he takes a notion to confide in
you&mdash;and I don't see why he shouldn't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What does he think of Locke?" Lane interrupted.</p>

<p>"He doesn't express any definite opinion. His one question is,
how did his wife happen to go to Locke's studio. And, I must say
we're no nearer finding that out than we were the night of the
murder."</p>

<p>"The whole thing is so bizarre, the whole case so incredible
that it ought to be easy," the detective said.</p>

<p>"Easy?"</p>

<p>"Yes; the more strange and unusual the circumstances, the easier
it is, usually, to ferret out their meaning. Well, I'll go ahead in
my own way, and I'll report to you, Mr. Nelson. As to my attitude
toward Mr. Barham, I shall be guided by circumstances, and by
developments as they appear. There'll be no trouble or rivalry
between me and the police. I'll promise you that. I know
Hutchins&mdash;and he'll be friendly with me."</p>

<p>And so Lorimer Lane took up the Barham case. He laid aside some
other matters, in order to give it his full attention, for to his
mind it promised to be one of the most interesting problems he had
ever tackled.</p>

<p>As a preliminary measure, he visited the studio apartment of
Locke.</p>

<p>Glenn was still there on guard, and though he was interested in
seeing the new detective he had little confidence that his powers
were superior to those of Hutchins and his assistants.</p>

<p>"I'll just go over the place," and Lane nodded affably to Glenn
and went off by himself.</p>

<p>He noted every bit of furniture and decoration in the studio
with critical intentness, now and then making a brief note of
something and again, merely nodding in satisfaction at finding
something indicative.</p>

<p>On entering Locke's bedroom, he closed the door, and spent a
long time in his examinations. The bathroom, too, claimed his
absorbed attention, and when he found on the glass shelf above the
washstand a small bottle of powdered pumice stone, he chuckled with
satisfaction.</p>

<p>"I&nbsp;<i>am</i>&nbsp;on the right track!" he told himself.
"Oh, what a case!"</p>

<p>Next he scanned the smoking-room&mdash;and studied carefully the
spot where the victim had been found.</p>

<p>The police had forbidden any meddling there, and Lane noted
carefully every sign he could find. There was little, however, that
seemed to mean anything, but he viewed with interest the white line
along the rug, which the police had concluded was powder from the
vanity-case also discovered near by.</p>

<p>"But it isn't!" Lane said to himself. "Powder would be sprinkled
grains&mdash;or else a soft, wide smear. This is a sharp, clean
line&mdash;it's, well, I don't know what it is&mdash;but I have a
pretty fair idea!"</p>

<p>On he went, poking into closets and cupboards, opening drawers
and looking behind doors, until he was absolutely familiar with
everything in the place.</p>

<p>"Any light on the dark subject?" Glenn asked, as the detective
reappeared.</p>

<p>"Not much so far&mdash;but a glimmer here and there. And I'm
sure I have the right starting-point. Where's the Chinaman?"</p>

<p>"In the pantry. Want him?"</p>

<p>"I'll go there," and Lane appeared before Charley.</p>

<p>He wasted no time on unimportant questions, but said, abruptly,
"When have you heard from Mr. Locke?"</p>

<p>"No more hear. He gone good-by," said the Chinaman.</p>

<p>"You are all paid up?"</p>

<p>"All and some more."</p>

<p>"All bills paid?"</p>

<p>"All."</p>

<p>"And on the first of the month you leave?"</p>

<p>"I leave."</p>

<p>"And Mr. Locke told you over the telephone that you would never
see or hear from him again?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he tell so."</p>

<p>"All right, Charley, that's all."</p>

<p>Still with that satisfied expression on his face, Lorimer Lane
started off to call on Miss Cutler.</p>

<p>He was by no means sure what course he should pursue with this
somewhat remarkable young woman. From what he had heard of her, he
didn't think she could be easily intimidated&mdash;perhaps it would
be wisest to treat her as a confidante.</p>

<p>But he had great faith in his own intuitions and concluded he
would be guided by them when they should meet.</p>

<p>Pearl Jane met him as one might receive a casual caller, and
Lane concluded at once that he must step carefully if he would make
good with this self-possessed young person.</p>

<p>She asked him to be seated, and then sat down herself, with a
demurely expectant face.</p>

<p>"You want to question me?" she said.</p>

<p>"If you please," Lane returned courteously. "And, Miss Cutler,
do not look on me as a prying inquisitor."</p>

<p>"Not at all&mdash;why should I?" she returned, her big violet
eyes expressing the most innocent surprise.</p>

<p>Lane was disconcerted. He hated to acknowledge it to himself,
but he was bothered by those eyes. Either the girl was absolutely
in the dark concerning the mystery he was trying to solve, or she
knew more than any one else. He was not sure which.</p>

<p>He resolved on a bold stroke.</p>

<p>"Miss Cutler," he said, bending forward and speaking in a low
tone, "do you know Mr. Locke's secret?"</p>

<p>At least he had got under her guard.</p>

<p>"His secret!" she exclaimed. "I didn't know he had one! Oh, you
mean do I know where he is?"</p>

<p>"No; I don't mean that at all. I mean do you know what he
is&mdash;who he is?"</p>

<p>"I know Mr. Locke for a good friend, an artist, and an honorable
gentleman. If you mean do I know his family or his
antecedents&mdash;I do not. There was a man who claimed to be his
brother&mdash;but I believe the police discredited his story."</p>

<p>She was again in command of herself&mdash;but Lane was sure that
his sudden question had disturbed her. He was sure that she did
know that Locke had a secret&mdash;a big one&mdash;and he was
equally sure that she was as ignorant of what it was as he was
himself&mdash;perhaps more so.</p>

<p>He concluded that the way to manage her was by sudden surprising
questions or statements, and he watched her closely as he said:
"You call him an honorable man, and yet you suspect him of the
murder of Mrs. Barham!"</p>

<p>The shot told. Pearl Jane went white, and her hands clenched as
she struggled to preserve her composure.</p>

<p>She thought quickly but steadily. Her brain was clear, though
her nerves were jumping. But she had one fixed principle to follow.
Tommy had told her to tell the truth. He had emphasized that. So
she did.</p>

<p>She parried only a moment. "Is that a statement or a question?"
she said.</p>

<p>Lane stared at her. She certainly was surprising.</p>

<p>"I'll make it a question," he said; "do you think Mr. Locke
killed Mrs. Barham?"</p>

<p>"It's hard to answer," she said, with a thoughtful look. "I
can't think it&mdash;and yet&mdash;yes, I do suspect him."</p>

<p>"And you still deem him an honorable man?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do."</p>

<p>"Do honorable men commit murder?"</p>

<p>"That question I can't answer. I dare say they have done
so."</p>

<p>"Well, Miss Cutler, this talk gets us nowhere. Now, for facts.
What makes you suspect Mr. Locke?"</p>

<p>"Only because I saw him go downstairs and out of his front door.
Then, when I immediately afterward went up the back stairs, I saw
the body of Mrs. Barham there on the floor."</p>

<p>"And so you concluded Mr. Locke had killed her?"</p>

<p>"I don't say I concluded that. I say I suspected it."</p>

<p>"Why should he kill her?"</p>

<p>"I haven't the slightest idea."</p>

<p>"You're sure you didn't kill her yourself?"</p>

<p>Pearl Jane allowed herself the slightest glimmer of a smile, as
she replied: "I'm positive of that."</p>

<p>"Well you ought to know. And you still love and respect Mr.
Locke, even if he is a murderer?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he isn't that."</p>

<p>"You contradict yourself&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't care if I do. I tell the truth. The truth may be
contradictory. You see&mdash;circumstances make me suspect Mr.
Locke with my mind&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But your heart tells you he's innocent!"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;exactly that!" and the girl's smile was like a
heavenly illumination. It transformed her from merely a pretty
child into a woman of exquisite beauty and charm.</p>

<p>Lorimer Lane stared at her.</p>

<p>"I've never seen any one quite like you, Miss Cutler," he said,
slowly. "Permit me to offer you my sincere admiration and
appreciation."</p>

<p>And now Pearl Jane stared at him. Her smile faded, she looked
haughty and resentful.</p>

<p>But as she realized that Lane was really sincere, she smiled at
him and with him, and in that moment their friendship was
sealed.</p>

<p>"Remember," he said, "I told you at the start, that I want to be
friendly. Now, if you will help me, and if you will continue to be
truthful, I've an idea that we can clear your Mr. Locke from the
suspicion of murder, whatever other crime he may be guilty of."</p>

<p>"Of course," she said, assuredly, "and he isn't guilty of any
crime."</p>

<p>"Not crime, perhaps&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lane hesitated, but his scrutiny of the young face gave no
answering appreciation of the thought he had in mind, and he
concluded she did not share his suspicions.</p>

<p>He went away, well satisfied with the interview, and especially
well satisfied with Pearl Jane.</p>

<p>"She's a hummer!" he said to himself, "and I hope to goodness I
can get her Tommy back for her. If he's all I think him, they will
some day be a happy couple!"</p>

<p>And Lorimer Lane might have felt his opinion verified if he
could have heard a conversation that ensued soon after his
departure.</p>

<p>It was over the telephone, and Pearl Jane held the receiver at
one end.</p>

<p>At the other end was a man, who said a joyful "Yes!" in response
to her query, "Is that you, Tommy?"</p>

<p>"Can we have a long talk?" Pearl Jane asked.</p>

<p>"No, dear, I can only say a few words to you. Things are
happening and I don't know what the future holds. Tell me this, my
little girl&mdash;can you keep faith and trust in me whatever
happens?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Tommy, whatever happens."</p>

<p>"But what happens may surprise you beyond all bounds."</p>

<p>"My faith and trust are beyond all bounds."</p>

<p>"Bless you, dear heart. Yet what you learn may cause you to
despise me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;not that. If you love me&mdash;if you want me&mdash;I
am your Pearl Jane forever&mdash;whether we ever meet again or
not."</p>

<p>"All right, sweetheart, then, remember this. When you
hear&mdash;as you may, the most astonishing news&mdash;remember
that I love you, I&mdash;<i>I</i>&nbsp;love you!"</p>

<p>"Why do you emphasize the&nbsp;<i>I?</i>&nbsp;There is no one in
the world for me, but the man you call I. My Tommy&mdash;my own
Tommy Locke."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;Pearl Jane&mdash;your own Tommy Locke. Good-by,
sweetheart, I daren't stay longer. Trust me through all mysteries,
and some day we can be happy together.</p>

<p>"Really, Tommy?"</p>

<p>"Really, dear. Good-by.</p>

<p>Pearl Jane was bewildered, but happy. Tommy was inexplicable,
but she knew&mdash;she&nbsp;<i>knew</i>&nbsp;he was no murderer, or
criminal of any sort. He was her Tommy, and some day they would be
happy together. He had said so, and that was enough for Pearl
Jane.</p>

<p>It was the next day before Lane obtained an interview with
Andrew Barham.</p>

<p>He had waited on that gentleman's convenience, and when he was
finally admitted to his presence the detective looked covertly at
the man whose acquaintance he was about to make.</p>

<p>"You wished to see me?" Barham said, courteously. "On what
errand?"</p>

<p>And suddenly, Lane made up his mind.</p>

<p>"Regarding the mystery of your wife's death," he said, frankly.
"I wish to take up the case, and solve it, if possible. I should be
glad to know your attitude toward me&mdash;or toward my work."</p>

<p>"Mr. Lane," and Barham looked very grave, "I suppose it is right
and just that the mystery of my wife's death should be solved.
But&mdash;I want to say, that I, personally, would greatly prefer
to have the whole matter dropped. I should prefer never to know the
truth of the case, rather than have certain painful revelations
made, that must be made if the whole story comes out."</p>

<p>"You refer, Mr. Barham, to your wife's unfortunate losses at
Bridge?"</p>

<p>"And her consequent wrong-doing in connection therewith," said
Andrew Barham, looking at Lane unflinchingly; "and not only that
phase of the matter, but other equally distressing circumstances.
These things would redound to the grief and pain of my wife's
mother, an elderly lady, and also to the disparagement, even
disgrace of my wife's memory. I hold that the only good done by a
solution of the mystery of her death would be the punishment of the
murderer. While we all feel that such a crime should be avenged, I,
myself, would rather never know the truth, than to expose all."</p>

<p>"I understand and appreciate, Mr. Barham, your attitude, but I
cannot look at it as you do. Moreover, the police are not willing
to look at it in that light, either. Now, I must tell you, that I
propose to go on with my investigations, and I will say right now,
if you have any confession to make, or explanations to give, I
should be glad to hear them. I am not antagonistic: on the
contrary, I want to meet your wishes in so far as I can,
but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Lane&mdash;I may as well say that I know who sent you here.
I know whose doing it is that you have taken up this case. It is at
the request of my dear friend, Mr. Nelson. He is doing it out of
the best of motives&mdash;he thinks I am sacrificing myself for
some one else."</p>

<p>"And aren't you?"</p>

<p>Andrew Barham smiled.</p>

<p>"Not exactly," he said. "And yet," he looked very grave, "if you
delve too deeply into this matter, if you try too hard to discover
the murderer of my wife&mdash;it will make&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped abruptly, and seemed to draw back into himself as
into a shell.</p>

<p>"I would rather say no more, Mr. Lane. If you want to question
me I am quite prepared to answer."</p>

<p>"Then, Mr. Barham, did you or did you not exchange the scarab
that Mr. Hutchins showed you for another and less valuable
one?"</p>

<p>"I did, Mr. Lane."</p>

<p>"Will you tell me why you did that?"</p>

<p>"Because the valuable scarab was my own property, and I desired
to have it again in my possession."</p>

<p>"It was stolen from you, then?"</p>

<p>"No, not stolen&mdash;it was taken by some one who meant
well."</p>

<p>"It was taken," Lane looked at Barham, steadily, "by Miss Cutler
from the hand of your dead wife?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Andrew Barham.</p>

<h2><b><a name="Chapter_17" id="Chapter_17">Chapter 17</a><br>
The Truth About Locke</b>
</h2>

<p>"Well, Mr. Nelson, I've solved part of the mystery, at any
rate," said Lorimer Lane, as he went to make his first formal
report to Nick Nelson. "I'm afraid you'll be sorry rather than
otherwise, but the disclosure was bound to come."</p>

<p>"I may be sorry I called you in at all," Nelson responded,
gloomily. "My friend Mr. Barham is not pleased at my bringing you
into the matter."</p>

<p>"I knew it, and I am not surprised. You see, his secret was
safe, until my advent. Without undue conceit, I may say I feel sure
the police would never have discovered it."</p>

<p>"Well, what is it?"</p>

<p>"It's simply this. The missing artist Thomas Locke can never be
found&mdash;for the simple reason that there is no such
person."</p>

<p>Nelson stared at the detective.</p>

<p>"Explain, please," he said briefly.</p>

<p>"I will. The artist, Locke, and your friend, Mr. Andrew Barham,
are one and the same person."</p>

<p>"Oh, now, Mr. Lane, that's a little too much. I can't take it
in."</p>

<p>"Take it slowly. I shouldn't make the statement unless I knew it
to be true. If you will think it over as I detail my arguments, I
am sure you'll be convinced."</p>

<p>"Go ahead."</p>

<p>"To begin with, it would be practically impossible for a man to
disappear so utterly off the face of the earth, as Locke seems to
have done. With a large reward offered for his apprehension, no man
could hide his personality so long and so cleverly and escape all
discovery or detection. But, aside from that, I have proved my case
to my own satisfaction, as I am sure I can prove it to yours."</p>

<p>"I'm trying to grasp it. But, before anything else, why would
Andrew Barham cut up any such trick as that? Why?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you. I may as well tell you that first. I have
studied Mr. Barham for three days now&mdash;I have inquired among
his friends and acquaintances&mdash;in a roundabout way&mdash;I
have interviewed his servants and I have even talked with his
mother-in-law. A most surprisingly unpleasant old lady."</p>

<p>"And you learned?"</p>

<p>"I learned that for some reason, Andrew Barham chose to lead a
double life. He was part of the time a resident of Fifth Avenue and
a society man. Also, part of the time, he was Thomas Locke, artist,
of Washington Square."</p>

<p>"Have you taxed him with this?"</p>

<p>"I have not. I am employed by you&mdash;so I come to you with my
findings. If you say so, my discovery shall go no further."</p>

<p>"I don't know what to say&mdash;I am too amazed for words. If
any lesser detective than yourself told me this thing I should
scoff at it. But I know your reputation, I know your prowess, and I
feel I must believe you&mdash;at least I must believe that you
believe this thing yourself."</p>

<p>"I know it. As to the more positive bits of evidence, let me
call to your mind the wig, left behind in the mid-night scramble
with the policeman. Mr. Barham, of course, pursued his career as
Locke, in disguise. He couldn't have managed it any other way. His
disguise was not elaborate but it was effective. It consisted only
of the well-made and perfectly fitting wig of long black hair, the
large and heavy-rimmed glasses and two gold caps for his eye teeth.
With these he was sufficiently changed in appearance for his
purpose."</p>

<p>"Those things couldn't really disguise him."</p>

<p>"Not from you or from any one who knew him. But he didn't need
that. All he wanted was a different personality for the artist that
should in no way resemble the real Andrew Barham. He never expected
to meet the same people in his two separate walks of life. And so,
he went his way in his Fifth Avenue surroundings, and occasionally,
when he chose, he went away, down to Washington Square for a day or
two. His frequent absences from the studio, and also, from his
Barham home, are thus explained."</p>

<p>"I can't take it in. Did his wife know of this?"</p>

<p>"Most certainly not. No one knew it. But, to my mind, it was a
suspicion of it that made Mrs. Barham go down there that night to
find out."</p>

<p>"Mr. Lane, I don't believe a word of all this! I can't believe
it! You are carried away with it all as a theory, and you are
trying to make things prove up. But it's too preposterous&mdash;too
incredible&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, Mr. Nelson, how about this? In Mr. Barham's desk
drawer, the one at his right hand, as he usually sits, I found
concealed under some papers, the small picture of Miss Cutler that
disappeared from the studio that night of the reappearance of
Locke."</p>

<p>And then Nick Nelson remembered how Barham had continually
fumbled in that drawer on certain occasions when Nelson had been
there. Was the man in love with Pearl Jane? Was he really Locke?
Nelson's brain seemed to spin around.</p>

<p>"This won't do," he said after a moment. "I can't take the
responsibility of your disclosures. Come with me at once to Andrew
Barham. We will lay all our cards on the table. If he has done this
thing&mdash;he will tell me so. I know Barham."</p>

<p>And so the detective and the man who had employed him went
together to Barham's office.</p>

<p>He received them gravely, seeming to know their errand.</p>

<p>He took them to his private office, and at once opened the
subject himself.</p>

<p>"My secret is a secret no longer," he said, and looked at Nelson
with a strange, almost wistful smile.</p>

<p>"Tell me it isn't so, Drew," Nelson cried; "tell me you never
did such a thing!"</p>

<p>"As what?"</p>

<p>"As to pretend to be Locke&mdash;and all that!"</p>

<p>"Is it so terrible?" Barham looked thoughtful. "Yes, I am Locke,
as I see Mr. Lane has already discovered. Do you want to hear the
story, Nick?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I do."</p>

<p>"It isn't a unique one, I daresay." Barham still had that
far-away look in his eyes and an absorbed expression on his
face.</p>

<p>But he told his story with dignity and with a fine faith in
Nelson's ability and willingness to understand.</p>

<p>"You know, Nick, that Maddy and I were never congenial in our
tastes or in our selection of companions. I couldn't bear that
crowd that she enjoyed so much, and she never liked the quieter
people I preferred.</p>

<p>"I honestly tried to adapt my preferences to hers, and to bring
about a state of affairs whereby we could be more congenial, but
she wouldn't make any concessions. I'm not blaming her, you
understand, but&mdash;well, I suppose the main trouble was that I
couldn't play Bridge&mdash;that is, not as her cronies played it.
Nor did I want to. I have none of the gambling instinct, none of
the craving for that sort of excitement. Maddy had.</p>

<p>"The result was, we drifted more and more apart. I used to take
her to the card parties and go for her when they were
over&mdash;but they kept up so late, and it irked her to have me
waiting for her&mdash;well, never mind all that. I became bored and
restless because almost every night I was left alone to amuse
myself&mdash;or, to enjoy the company of Mrs. Selden. I went to the
clubs a lot, of course, but they didn't give me what I wanted. I
longed for an interest in life, a few congenial spirits, and most
of all I wanted to follow up a taste for painting that I had as a
younger man.</p>

<p>"I tried it at home, but Maddy objected to the smell of paint in
the house, so I concluded to set up a studio. I had no thought, at
first, of what came about afterward&mdash;but one night I went to a
masquerade with Madeleine. I wore that long haired wig, which so
became me and looked so natural on me&mdash;that after a while some
such idea as I finally carried out began to take shape in my brain.
I mulled over it a year before I decided to try it, and
then&mdash;after a desperate attempt to persuade Maddy to give me
at least part of her time, and failing, I set up my studio.</p>

<p>"The disguise and the double life were partly to be free from
intrusion and interruption&mdash;to have a sort of haven and
sanctuary all to myself&mdash;and partly, out of a spirit of
bravado. If Maddy could lead her life&mdash;I could lead mine, I
argued. I wasn't so very keen about keeping it secret&mdash;indeed,
if my wife had discovered it I was in no way ashamed of it.</p>

<p>"But, as time went on, I found I was changing. I was becoming
more and more Tommy Locke and less and less Andrew Barham. I began
to realize that I had gone farther than I intended&mdash;that I had
burned bridges behind me that I never could rebuild. Time and again
I tried to give up that other life&mdash;tried to resolve to close
up the studio and never go back to it. I kept things arranged that
way&mdash;there was always money enough in Charley's possession to
pay all bills and settle up all claims, if I could conclude to give
up the other life I led.</p>

<p>"But I couldn't do it. Always I would drift back there
again."</p>

<p>"But how, Drew, how could you work it? Why were you never
discovered&mdash;or suspected."</p>

<p>"It was easy," Barham said. "I had so many out of town
engagements in connection with my business that no one at home was
surprised at my absence for several days at a time. And, at the
other end, no one ever thought of questioning my goings or comings.
It was really all very innocent and decent. I had good
friends&mdash;no intimates, and no&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are sure you want me to hear all this revelation, Mr.
Barham?" Lane asked, noting the confidences that were evidently
meant for Nelson.</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter, Mr. Lane. Yes&mdash;I think I'd rather you
understood the whole situation. That's about all, anyway. The
disguise became second nature to me. I could achieve it in a moment
or two. Many a time I have left the house in Fifth Avenue,
ostensibly for a trip to Chicago or St. Louis. In my bag I had my
wig, glasses, collar and tie, and a few such things. I would take a
taxi from the station, whither my own chauffeur had driven me, and
in it I would make the change in my appearance. The taxi driver
rarely noticed it&mdash;if he did a five dollar bill closed his
mouth. I would get out a few blocks from the studio and walk to it.
I cannot tell you how I enjoyed the rest and freedom from my
distressing home life&mdash;yes, I may as well admit it was
distressing. Madeleine grew continually harder to live with, and
Mrs. Selden was always a thorn in my flesh. I would not make these
disclosures, Nick, but I must make you understand."</p>

<p>"I do understand, Andrew, and I want you to know it!"</p>

<p>Nelson impulsively reached over and grasped his friend's
hand.</p>

<p>Lorimer Lane, too, showed appreciation and understanding, but he
was eagerly awaiting the rest of the story. His leaping mind had
already jumped to the last chapter.</p>

<p>"But," Barham resumed, "there never was a truer word than Oscar
Wilde wrote in his 'Ballad of Reading Gaol.'</p>

<p class="quote">"For he who lives more lives than one.<br>
More deaths than one must die.</p>

<p>"I have proved that over and over again. I have lived a double
life, it is true, and I have paid for it by dying a thousand deaths
in my conscience. I have suffered remorse untold&mdash;I have so
loathed myself at times that I would willingly have died in earnest
to get out of it all. And then&mdash;the urge would be so strong,
the desire for that little home, those few good friends&mdash;that
I would go back there in spite of myself."</p>

<p>"And I don't blame you!" cried Nelson. "It was no crime, Drew.
Many a man lives a double life of far more ignominy and shame."</p>

<p>"There was no ignominy, no shame," said Barham, gravely, "but it
was deceit&mdash;and I am not naturally a deceitful man. I could
look at it all calmly and dispassionately while I was down at the
studio, but when I was at home, at my own table, with those two
unsuspecting women, I felt the veriest scoundrel on the face of the
earth."</p>

<p>"Well you're not!" and Nelson again grasped the hand of his
friend.</p>

<p>"I agree to that," said Lane, looking earnestly at Barham. "But
now&mdash;will you tell us all you know about the night of the
masquerade?"</p>

<p>Barham looked up quickly..</p>

<p>"You think I killed my wife, Mr. Lane. I don't blame
you&mdash;or, rather, I mean, I can't wonder at it. When the police
know this story and I suppose they must, I shall be
suspected&mdash;probably accused&mdash;possibly convicted. That I
must bear&mdash;for 'he who lives more lives than one, more deaths
than one must die.' But&mdash;I didn't kill my wife."</p>

<p>"Thank God!" and Nelson's fervent expression told how eagerly he
had been waiting for this declaration. He believed Barham
implicitly; as he believed the whole story he had just heard, so he
believed the statement of Barham's innocence regarding the murder
of Madeleine.</p>

<p>"Now the thing is to find the criminal," Nick exclaimed, his
whole face almost radiant with his relief.</p>

<p>But Lane was not so sure of Barham's integrity.</p>

<p>"Tell us about the party," he said, his eyes fixed on Barham's
face.</p>

<p>"I will," and Barham sensed the doubt in the detective's mind.
"I had no wish to have it but some friends urged me to, and though
I never had given a large party before, I consented, on condition
that they should do all the planning and ordering. To this they
consented and even sent out the invitations. I didn't go down until
the night of the ball."</p>

<p>"Will you detail your movements that evening?" Lane asked
him.</p>

<p>"Certainly. I was at home for dinner. Afterward, I went to the
Club&mdash;you remember, Nick, I talked with you a few moments.
After that I merely left the Club, walked a block or two, took a
taxi, made the necessary changes in my appearance while in the
taxi. That is, I did so in part. As I reached the studio before any
guests arrived, I could fix myself up at my leisure."</p>

<p>"One moment, Mr. Barham. Was part of your disguise a change in
your especially white teeth?"</p>

<p>"Yes;" and Barham looked surprised at the question. "I had a
small vial of a brown colored preparation. A swallow of that and my
teeth were stained rather darker than they really are. I confess I
became a bit of an expert at it."</p>

<p>"And you used pumice stone to remove that brown stain. It was
the pumice stone in your studio bathroom that helped me to my
conclusions."</p>

<p>"Right," and Barham smiled a little ruefully. "I was not very
clever, was I? But, as I told you, I really had no very great fear
of discovery. I mean, if, or when I was discovered, I was ready to
admit it all. However, to resume. By the time the guests arrived, I
was completely my other self, and arrayed in my monk's robe. Then
the party began."</p>

<p>Barham paused, as if unable to go on with his recital.</p>

<p>But Lane was waiting, eager and anxious for the rest.</p>

<p>"I didn't enjoy the party much," Barham said; "I care little for
dancing and the whole thing bored me."</p>

<p>"And then your wife came," Lane said, pointedly.</p>

<p>Andrew Barham looked the detective straight in the eye.</p>

<p>"I didn't see my wife arrive," he said. "I didn't know she was
there. I came away before the alarm of her death was
raised&mdash;and I had no idea that she was in that house."</p>

<p>"Why did you leave so suddenly and so unceremoniously?"</p>

<p>"That I shall not tell you&mdash;but it was in no way connected
with my wife's presence on the scene&mdash;of which I state, on my
word of honor, I was entirely unaware."</p>

<p>Lorimer Lane looked disappointed. And he was. Not that he, now,
really suspected Andrew Barham guilty of his wife's death, but so
far he had believed in his veracity, and now he doubted it. There
could be no reason, he argued, that would have made Barham leave as
he did leave, except the knowledge of his wife's presence at the
ball, either alive or dead.</p>

<p>"You say you left before the alarm of Mrs. Barham's death was
raised; but she was already dead when you ran out of the front
door."</p>

<p>"I didn't run out."</p>

<p>"No; on the contrary, you walked out casually, saying you would
be back in a few moments."</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"Why did you go?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you."</p>

<p>"You mean you will not?"</p>

<p>"I mean I will not."</p>

<p>"Oh, Drew, for Heaven's sake, tell us," Nelson cried, in genuine
distress. "You've been so frank and honest till now, do tell me the
truth. Why did you go&mdash;if you didn't know Madeleine was
there?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell you, Nick. Mr. Lane, I refuse to tell. You asked
for my story, you have heard it. Now, it is up to you to make what
use of it you see fit."</p>

<p>Andrew Barham folded his arms and sat back in his chair, as one
who has played his part.</p>

<p>But Lane pursued his inquiries.</p>

<p>"Now, how about the scarab, Mr. Barham?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, the scarab. It is my own&mdash;and is, as Charley
called it, a 'lucky piece.' I have had it for years, and I am a bit
superstitious about it. Foolishly, I took it down to the studio and
left it there. It was, I think, on the table in the den,
and&mdash;I am only surmising now&mdash;but I fancy my wife saw it
and recognized it as mine. She had it in her hand when she
died&mdash;that is certain. Miss Cutler, thinking I cherished it,
took it and saved it for me. My Chinaman saw this. Well, never mind
all that&mdash;when Detective Hutchins showed it to me, I knew at
once that the Museum people would recognize it as mine. It is a
famous specimen. So I substituted another for it&mdash;both being
my own property."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I see," and Lane pondered a few moments. "Now, Mr.
Barham, in view of your frank disclosures, I must ask you if you
want me to continue my investigation of the case.</p>

<p>"I do not."</p>

<p>"Do you, Mr. Nelson?"</p>

<p>"I want whatever Mr. Barham wants. He is my friend, and I agree
to any decision he may make."</p>

<p>"Can you tell me, Mr. Barham," Lane went on, thoughtfully, "why
your wife went down there that evening?"</p>

<p>"No; I cannot. That is what puzzles me. I should think it might
be possible that she had seen or heard something that made her
suspect the truth about me, and that she went down to see for
herself. But I cannot think that; first, because I can see no
possible way in which her suspicions could have been aroused, and
also, because her whole attitude toward me of late had been kinder
and more pleasant than usual."</p>

<p>"Yet it might have been that she suspected your deception," Lane
said.</p>

<p>"Yes, it might be," Barham agreed. "I've thought over that a
great deal, but I can come to no conclusion."</p>

<p>"And that night, Mr. Barham, when you left the studio party you
came directly home?"</p>

<p>"I did. I took a bus on Fifth Avenue which came up to my own
door. I rode a few blocks past, and walked back. I let myself in
with my latchkey, and went at once to my room and to bed."</p>

<p>"You refuse to tell why you left the party?"</p>

<p>"I refuse."</p>

<p>"Very well, go on."</p>

<p>"I had been in bed less than an hour, when my man called me to
the telephone, and I heard the astounding news that my wife was
dead&mdash;or, as they put it, fatally injured&mdash;in my own
studio! I was absolutely stunned with amazement. Understand, I had
no idea she was there when I left the place."</p>

<p>"Mr. Barham, that is the one point of your story that I can't
believe!"</p>

<p>"I believe it!" Nelson cried. "I know it is true if you say so,
Drew. Go on."</p>

<p>"That's all there is to tell. I went down there at the summons
of the police, and I found my wife there&mdash;dead. I cannot tell
you of my surprise and horror&mdash;and bewilderment. Nor do I yet
understand why she was there."</p>

<p>"And after all that&mdash;Mr. Barham, you returned to the studio
in your disguise?"</p>

<p>"I went down first in my rightful name. I went with Mr. Nelson,
in hopes I might find my scarab, which I greatly prized, and which
I knew would be recognized as mine if found. But I couldn't find
it&mdash;so I secretly left a note for Charley asking him to search
for it."</p>

<p>"But you went down again&mdash;in your Locke disguise, and had a
set to with the man Glenn&mdash;and lost your wig!"</p>

<p>Andrew Barham couldn't repress a slight smile at the
recollection and only replied, "Yes, I did."</p>

<p>"What did you go for?"</p>

<p>"I don't care to tell you."</p>

<p>"Then I'll tell you. You went for the picture of Miss Cutler.
You secured it, and brought it home with you, and it is now in your
desk drawer at home."</p>

<p>Andrew Barham looked a little surprised, but he said, "Since you
know that, I will tell you that I did do so. I will tell you, too,
that I do care for Miss Cutler, and I hope some day in the future
to tell her so in person. But I want to say that not only did I
never hint this to her during the life of my wife, but I did not
realize it myself. It is only since my series of troubles began,
that I have learned the state of my own heart, and I will say to
you two men in confidence, that I do love Pearl Jane Cutler, but I
will ask you to respect my secret, for the present, at least."</p>

<p>Andrew Barham was so quietly dignified, so truly frank, that the
two men who listened felt a renewed respect for him, and Lane
hastily revised certain of his decisions.</p>

<p>Nick Nelson merely grasped once again the hand of his friend,
and there was no need of words between them.</p>

<h2><b><a name="Chapter_18" id="Chapter_18">Chapter 18</a><br>
The Whole Truth</b>
</h2>

<p>But&nbsp;while this was all satisfactory to the friends of
Andrew Barham it was not so easily accepted by the police.</p>

<p>Hutchins and Dickson both listened to the whole story as
detailed by Lorimer Lane to them.</p>

<p>"Are you sure about this thing?" Dickson asked. "I had sort of a
notion that Locke was a masquerader, but I couldn't make the facts
fit it. Why, the two men are directly opposite in character&mdash;I
mean Barham and the artist."</p>

<p>"No, they're not," Lane contradicted. "That's what I noticed
first. They have much in common. The appointments of Locke's
bathroom, the fine towels, the expensive soaps and all that, first
struck me as being out of keeping with a poor artist, and hinted at
a cultured gentleman. The furniture of the place is not elaborate,
but all the little personal belongings betoken a luxury-loving
nature. Oh, well, the man himself told me the whole story&mdash;we
can't very well doubt it."</p>

<p>"No, of course not," Dickson agreed, "but it's a pretty big yarn
to swallow. And, moreover, that settles the question of the murder.
Of course it was Barham who killed his wife. She went down there to
spy on him and he killed her and ran away. Too easy. All for the
love of the little Cutler girl, of course."</p>

<p>"I don't think Barham killed his wife," Lane demurred. "He isn't
the sort to do that. And, too, he said himself he didn't realize
that he cared for the little girl until after his wife was
dead."</p>

<p>"And you fell for that! No, Mr. Lane, his affection for the
young lady dates farther back. I can see the whole situation, and I
haven't the least doubt that Mrs. Barham discovered&mdash;or, at
least suspected her husband's double life and went to the
masquerade ball in order to see for herself. That's why she told no
one where she was going. That's why she told her chauffeur to take
her there that night, meaning to go on to the Gardner party
afterward. Then Barham, finding her there&mdash;of course he would
know her in any costume&mdash;had a quarrel with her, and either
with intent to kill her, or merely in a fit of blind rage, he flung
the bronze at her and she fell. Immediately, Barham went down the
front stairs, gave his monk's robe to his servant, told the doorman
he would be back shortly, and disappeared. Could there be a better
way out of it all? He went back at once to his home, and, returning
to his life as Andrew Barham, was free from all suspicion of his
crime. I for one don't want any clearer case against him."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it," Lane mused; "I can't believe it. He was so
convincing as he told his story&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course he was. He's a clever man and a shrewd one. But he
can't convince me. I want some one else to hang this crime on,
before I give up my hope of hanging it on him. He's the logical
criminal, he's the obvious one&mdash;in a word, there's no other
way to look."</p>

<p>"No"; Lane insisted. "You're wrong and I know you're
wrong&mdash;and I'll prove you're wrong. Give me a couple of
days&mdash;give me twenty-four hours before you arrest Andrew
Barham, and I'll give you another suspect&mdash;and the right one,
or I'll eat my own words."</p>

<p>The police agreed to this, saying they should, however, keep a
close watch on Barham's movements.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Andrew Barham was at that moment making up
his mind about a very important matter.</p>

<p>He had divulged his secret to the detective, Lane, who had,
Barham was sure, gone straight to the police with it. Also, he had
told Nick Nelson, his best friend, the whole truth. There was
another still who deserved to hear the truth, and to her Barham was
going to tell it.</p>

<p>He was a little uncertain how Pearl Jane would take the story.
He had deceived her, he couldn't deny that. Would she forgive him
and be friends&mdash;or, would she resent it all too much?"</p>

<p>At any rate, he must find out. Barham was not the sort who fears
to put it to the touch to win or lose it all.</p>

<p>And, he concluded to himself, if she scorns me, and refuses ever
to see me again&mdash;well, that's one more death to die.</p>

<p>So, from his own house, and on his own telephone, he called up
Pearl Jane.</p>

<p>"Tommy!" she exclaimed, delightedly.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear&mdash;Tommy. Now, I am coming to see you&mdash;and
I&mdash;well I don't know just how to say what I have to say. But,
Mr. Barham will come to see you first."</p>

<p>"Mr. Barham!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Andrew Barham. When he comes&mdash;see him&mdash;will
you, Pearl Jane?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course&mdash;but what can he want to see me about?"</p>

<p>"You'll find out when he comes. Just receive him&mdash;and, be
alone, will you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course I'll do whatever you say, Tommy."</p>

<p>And in less than half an hour, Pearl Jane was informed of Mr.
Barham's arrival.</p>

<p>"Send him up," she said&mdash;and sat, wondering.</p>

<p>And then Andrew Barham went up to Pearl Jane's little sitting
room.</p>

<p>She had never seen him before&mdash;to her knowledge.</p>

<p>But as soon as she did see him, she divined the truth at
once.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you are Tommy!" she said, looking at his blond hair,
and gazing straight into his eyes, unhindered now by the large
disfiguring glasses.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear&mdash;sit down and listen to my story."</p>

<p>And then in his own simple, straightforward way, Andrew Barham
told the girl the history of his double life&mdash;the reasons for
it&mdash;and the closing of it by the tragedy that had come into
it.</p>

<p>"Can you ever forgive me?" he asked, looking deep into her
wondering eyes.</p>

<p>"I? I have nothing to forgive! You committed no crime against
me."</p>

<p>"I committed no crime at all, dear. I did not kill my wife."</p>

<p>"But you know who did?"</p>

<p>"I have a suspicion, Pearl Jane, a grave suspicion. I think I do
know who killed her. But I cannot tell of it. I cannot bring myself
to cast suspicion on one who may, after all, be as innocent as I am
myself. First, though, I want to make my peace with you. You don't
resent, then, my deception of you&mdash;of you all? It was such a
comfort to me to live the studio life&mdash;to have the studio
friends&mdash;oh, little girl, you can never know how awful my home
life was!"</p>

<p>"Why, dear? How?"</p>

<p>The gentle sympathy brought it all out in a rush of words.
Barham had never expected to divulge his secret woes, but this
girl's attitude was so confidential, so receptive, he couldn't help
it.</p>

<p>"My wife was utterly uncongenial to me," he said, "this is no
disparagement to her&mdash;she was a fine woman&mdash;but her
tastes were all for society, and especially, Bridge playing
society. I hate card playing, and so we had nothing in common. She
knew and admitted this, and we drifted farther and farther apart.
Too, I wanted to paint&mdash;I know I'm not an artist, but I love
it so. My wife objected to my painting at home, so I set up a
studio down here. I had no intention, at first, of keeping it
secret, but it seemed better to do so, if I would be let alone, so
I carried out the plan.</p>

<p>"And, as is my habit with anything I undertake, I carried it out
thoroughly. I used every precaution that no one should suspect that
Thomas Locke was Andrew Barham. And it was not at all difficult. I
soon had the whole matter so well adjusted and the double life so
perfectly arranged, that no one ever suspected such a thing. Nor do
I feel myself under any obligation to apologize for it, or even
explain it to any one except you."</p>

<p>"Why to me?" and Pearl Jane looked at him with a wistful little
smile.</p>

<p>"Because, dear&mdash;because I love you. It sounds strange for a
man to say that, so soon after his wife's death. But I am truthful,
Pearl, and I tell you honestly, I didn't know that I loved you
until after Madeleine was gone from me. I had never analyzed or
realized my feelings toward you. I think, had my wife lived, I
never should have done so. I felt friendly toward you, but I had
never thought of loving you. But that night at the party you
touched my hand&mdash;and a thrill went all through me&mdash;and I
wondered at it. However, had Madeleine lived, and had I thought I
was growing fond of you, I should have given up the studio, and put
you out of my life. I owed her that. But now she is dead, and while
convention should make me keep silent, for a time at least, I waive
convention and I tell you that I love you. Not as Tommy Locke, but
as Andrew Barham, I love you, and after a time, I want to make you
my wife. What is your answer, Pearl&mdash;little Pearl?"</p>

<p>"There can be but one answer," she returned, tears in her lovely
eyes. "I love you,&nbsp;<i>you</i>, whoever you are, or whatever
your name is. I am so overcome at what you have told me&mdash;I am
so bewildered&mdash;I can't seem to think it all out yet. But one
thing I know&mdash;I love you and I'm
glad&mdash;<i>glad</i>&nbsp;you love me."</p>

<p>And then she was in his arms, sobbing out all her bewilderment
and surprise on his breast.</p>

<p>"Darling," he said, "I do love you with all my heart and soul.
And the time will come&mdash;some day, when I shall proudly claim
you for my wife, and gladly take you into my heart and home openly.
But for the present&mdash;for your sake as well as my own, we must
keep our love a secret."</p>

<p>"Of course&mdash;it is the only thing to do. And&mdash;and maybe
you will change your mind&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't, darling, don't say such things. You are the love of my
life. I never cared for Madeleine as I love you&mdash;you dear,
sweet little thing! She was a lovely woman and a beautiful one. You
are my little companion, my beloved child&mdash;my other self. We
shall be happy together, both after we are married, and also
before. We can be friends at once, and we can be more and more to
each other as time goes on. I am yours now and forever, and though
convention seems to make it wiser for us to stay apart for a time,
yet if you say so&mdash;we will go away at once&mdash;together,
forever."</p>

<p>"No, no, dear, I don't want that. I know how the world will look
at us, and I know it's best and wisest to keep our secret for a
time. I can't get used to it myself! Tommy&mdash;I think I shall
always call you Tommy&mdash;you did wear a wig, didn't you? But, as
you assured me, you are not bald!"</p>

<p>And they laughed together at the idea.</p>

<p>"Also, I miss your gold teeth," Pearl Jane went on. "That was a
clever dodge."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I felt I must make myself into two men, as widely
differentiated as possible. So the gold caps and the big glasses
and the wig seemed enough, and they were enough to allay any and
all suspicion.</p>

<p>"Though there never was any chance for suspicion. Nobody ever
dreamed of the identity of the two men."</p>

<p>"And did your wife suspect it? Was that why she came to the
studio?"</p>

<p>"I think that must be the truth. At first, I couldn't believe
it, but I think now there is no other explanation. Had she made
herself known to me while there, or had she taxed me with the whole
thing at any time, I was quite ready to own up and confess the
whole business. I was ready and willing to tell her the truth; that
I couldn't be happy at home, that I wanted a studio and a studio
life, and that I had as much right to it as she had to her
Bridge-playing career. The only difference was that I led my chosen
life secretly, and she did not. But that was because I wanted to be
left to myself and not bothered by the friends and acquaintances of
our social life. Had my wife known of my studio, she would have
been everlastingly coming down there and bringing her friends. That
was the atmosphere I wanted to get away from. Well, there's the
story, Pearl, dear. And now that you know it, and forgive me, I
don't care for the opinion or criticism of anybody else."</p>

<p>"And about the murder?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;about that. As I told you I have a suspicion&mdash;a
strong one, that I know who did it. But I shall not mention any
name, unless I have to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To clear yourself."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;and for you. I had partly thought I would let myself
be suspected, rather than accuse another. But, now that I have you
to consider, I can't let myself be wrongly accused. I must keep my
name fair against the time when I can give it to you. Pearl
Barham&mdash;I think we'll leave out the Jane. I never liked that
part of it."</p>

<p>"Call me whatever you like&mdash;Tommy," and little Pearl gave
Barham a glance of absolute adoration and love.</p>

<p>"Dear heart," he said, and taking her into his embrace he
covered her sweet face with kisses.</p>

<p>But the future of Andrew Barham was still beset with
difficulties.</p>

<p>Hutchins came to him, and told him the attitude of the police.
The detective admitted that Lorimer Lane did not think Barham
guilty of the murder of his wife, but that unless he could produce
some other suspect, the police must soon arrest him.</p>

<p>"Then, I shall have to tell of my own suspicion," Barham said
gravely. "I hoped not to do so&mdash;I hoped the case could go out
of existence as one of those unsolved mysteries. But, if it must
be&mdash;it must, and, much as I dislike to do so, I will tell of
my suspicions and you can investigate them."</p>

<p>But before Hutchins left. Lane came in and declared that he had
himself discovered another way to look, and he wished Barham's
sanction of his work in that direction.</p>

<p>"It is a woman," Lane said, and at once he saw, from the
expression on Andrew Barham's face, he had hit it right&mdash;so
far.</p>

<p>"I deduced much from that pair of long, white gloves," Lane went
on. "They are of a make superior to those worn by most of the
ladies at that party. They are Paris gloves, and they are small and
dainty. I feel sure none of the other guests had gloves like that.
I mean they betoken the presence there of one of Mrs. Barham's
friends&mdash;one of her own circle of society. I have again
interviewed Claudine, and I find that Mrs. Sayre, the lady who
visited Mrs. Barham that evening was being&mdash;well, the word
must be used&mdash;was being blackmailed by Mrs. Barham at that
time. I have traced Mrs. Sayre's movements that evening, and both
her maid and her husband say that she went on an errand to her
dressmaker's early that evening and afterwards returned home, and
went later with Mr. Sayre to the party at Mrs. Gardner's. I have
checked up this story, and I find she did not go to her
dressmaker's at all that evening. Her story was that she would go
to her dressmaker's wearing a masquerade costume that she wished to
have remodeled. I hold that she wore this costume in order to gain
admittance to the masquerade at the studio of Thomas Locke, and
that Mrs. Barham had already told her of his masquerade, and that
she, Mrs. Barham, expected to be there.</p>

<p>"I don't believe that Mrs. Sayre went to the studio party with
any intention of killing Mrs. Barham, but I believe she went there
expecting an expose of Mr. Barham's double life. I believe Mrs.
Barham had suspicions of this, and had told Mrs. Sayre of them.
Now, Mr. Barham, is she the one you have had in mind in connection
with this matter?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Barham, "she is."</p>

<p>"Will you go with me to interview her?"</p>

<p>But this Andrew Barham couldn't bring himself to do. He begged
to be let off from such an unpleasant undertaking, and the two
detectives went away without him.</p>

<p>Reaching the Sayre house, they succeeded in obtaining an
interview with the lady.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you can have to talk to me about," she said,
a little nervously as she appeared in her living room and greeted
the two men.</p>

<p>"Perhaps nothing of importance, Mrs. Sayre," Lane said, "and
perhaps it is. Will you detail your movements the night of the
studio party in Washington Square&mdash;when Mrs. Barham was
killed."</p>

<p>Whereupon Mrs. Sayre glibly told of her visit to her dressmaker,
and afterward the party at Mrs. Gardner's.</p>

<p>"All very well," Lane said, "but your dressmaker says you were
not there at all."</p>

<p>Rosamond Sayre turned white, but she declared the woman had
forgotten her visit, or for some reason of her own preferred to
tell a falsehood about it.</p>

<p>"No, Mrs. Sayre, she is not telling an untruth, but you are. You
did not go to your dressmaker's that night, you went to the studio
party. You wore the costume of 'Winter', and you left the house
just a few moments after Mr. Locke did. You were seen by a
neighbor. And before you went&mdash;just before, you had a
discussion with Mrs. Barham regarding&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I did! She blackmailed me! She had made my life a burden for
weeks! She knew a secret which I would rather have died than let it
come to the ears of my husband. She knew a secret that would have
ruined me if it had become known. And she had already extorted
hundreds of dollars from me which I paid her to keep silent about
it. She was continuing to demand money&mdash;she told me that night
at the studio&mdash;we were alone in the den&mdash;that unless I
paid her a thousand dollars she would tell it that very night at
Mrs. Gardner's. I didn't mean to kill her&mdash;but I was so angry
at her cruelty and hard-heartedness that in a frenzy of despair I
picked up that thing and threw it at her. When I saw her fall to
the floor, I ran away. I couldn't stay&mdash;I didn't then think
she was dead&mdash;but I knew I had hurt her, and I thought if I
got away she would not dare tell of my presence there. I knew there
were enough people there to take care of her. I knew she suspected
Mr. Locke of being her own husband in disguise, and I wanted to get
away from the whole scene. I came home in a taxicab, and, saying I
had been to my modiste's, I changed into an ordinary evening gown
and went to the Gardners' with my husband."</p>

<p>"You wore to the studio a pair of white shoes that had been
recently cleaned."</p>

<p>"My maid cleaned them that very night, with a chalk preparation.
Why?"</p>

<p>"It was that which put me on your track&mdash;that and the
gloves. There was a strong, clear line of chalk, in the den where
you stood at that time. Also, the gloves pointed to a society lady,
and as Claudine had told me of your visit to Mrs. Barham's that
very evening while she was dressing for the masquerade, I just put
the various bits of evidence together and they pointed to you. I
fear, Mrs. Sayre, we must arrest you."</p>

<p>"Not alive," and Rosamond Sayre raised her fingers to her
lips.</p>

<p>"Stop her, Hutchins, she's poisoning herself!" Lane cried.</p>

<p>But they were too late. A tiny pellet had served to cheat the
emissaries of law and justice, and in a moment or two, Rosamond
Sayre had ended her earthly career.</p>

<p>As Madeleine Barham had died at her hand, so Rosamond Sayre owed
her own death to the cruelty and crime of her friend.</p>

<p>"It all proved up," Lane said, in telling Andrew Barham of the
suicide. "She had been, among many others, a victim of Mrs.
Barham's blackmail. She had reached the very end of her patience
and her resources. She hoped to be present at a mortifying
disclosure at the studio, and thought that possibly she could make
a sort of deal, later, with Mrs. Barham, if there was a secret to
be kept.</p>

<p>"Also, she said that Mrs. Barham discovered the scarab on the
table in the den. That she had taken it, knowing it was her
husband's and planning to use it as corroboration of her suspicion
that he was Locke himself. So, Mrs. Barham had the stone in her
hand when she fell. Miss Cutler, as she has told, took it from the
dead woman, knowing it to be valuable, and a prized possession of
Locke's."</p>

<p>"It's all true," Barham said, "and here is my part of the story.
I did not recognize my wife at all, though I saw the lady in the
Oriental costume. But I did recognize Rosamond Sayre. I knew her
costume, having seen it recently, and under the edge of her mask I
saw enough of her face to recognize her beyond all possibility of
mistake. So, I instantly assumed that she had learned my secret and
was there to confound me with its disclosure. I concluded at once
to go away forever. I had no thought of my wife's being
there&mdash;I didn't think to get the scarab, which was about the
only thing there that could connect me with Andrew Barham. I merely
tossed my monk's robe to Charley and walked off. I had no thought
of ever returning and simply carried out the plan I had from the
beginning when discovery should come&mdash;merely to obliterate
Tommy Locke from the face of the earth. I went back on two
occasions to try to find that scarab. Partly because of its real
value and partly because it meant a revelation of the fact that
Locke and Barham were one and the same. There is my story. I did
suspect Mrs. Sayre from the very first&mdash;but I didn't want to
suggest it. She was&mdash;I thought&mdash;a friend of my wife, and,
too, it seemed too dreadful to turn suspicion toward a woman. I
went to see her&mdash;and she begged me to try to hush up the whole
matter. Now she has paid the extreme penalty herself&mdash;is it
necessary to put the facts before the public?"</p>

<p>"That's as the police see fit, Mr. Barham. It may be necessary
to tell the story, or they may conclude not to."</p>

<p>"I want especially to prevent Mrs. Selden's learning of it,"
Barham said. "It would break her heart to know the extent of her
daughter's wrong-doing. I shall do all I can to make her life calm
and serene for a year or so. At the end of that time, I shall feel
I have done my duty by her, and I shall arrange for her to live
apart from me."</p>

<p>Barham did not say who would live with him, and who would be a
more desirable companion than his present mother-in-law.</p>

<p>But in his heart, he said, with a great wave of loving
affection, "My blessed little Pearl!"</p>
