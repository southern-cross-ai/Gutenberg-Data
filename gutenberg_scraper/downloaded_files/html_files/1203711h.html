<p align="right"><a name="ch-01" id="ch-01"></a>Mount Remarkable,
8th September, 1858.</p>
<p>Sir&mdash;I have the honor to inform you that, on my arrival
at Thompson's Station, from Port Augusta, I learned, with the
greatest surprise, that Mr. Harris had left that place two days
previously, <i>en route</i> for Adelaide, having with him three
of the men, two drays, and twelve horses, belonging to the
expedition.</p>
<p>As I had gone up upon the western shores of the Gulf, and Mr.
Harris had come down by the regular road on the eastern side, we
had not met.</p>
<p>Convinced that the loss of so large a portion of the equipment
and men belonging to the expedition would most seriously cripple
my resources, I left the pack-horse I had with me at Mr.
Thompson's, and immediately started with Warriner on the road to
Mount Remarkable, in which direction I was told Mr. Harris had
gone. I overtook Mr. Harris, at the Mount, about two o'clock
to-day. I enclose a written statement from Mr. Harris, explaining
his share in this transaction. I immediately took the command of
the party, and arranged with Mr. Harris that he and his
brother-in-law, Thompson (who wished to return to Adelaide),
should proceed by the mail, as I intend, myself, starting back
to-morrow with the drays, all the horses, and two of the men, for
the Elizabeth.</p>
<p>I understand that there are, at my camp, despatches from you
to me, which have been opened by Messrs. Harris and Gregory in my
absence, in which you recommend the disencumbering myself of the
drays, and proceeding with pack-horses only; and that this
recommendation has been the result of a long conference between
the two Mr. Gregory's and yourself. I am quite ready to admit Mr.
Gregory, senior's, superior knowledge and skill in exploring; but
he has evidently never been in a country of the nature of the one
in which I have been myself for these last five months, and
cannot, therefore, be so good a judge as myself of the best way
of proceeding; I shall, therefore, take the responsibility of, it
may be, proceeding in a different manner from the way directed by
you, Sir, as I am convinced that, were you acquainted with all
the details of my position, you would agree fully in my
plans.</p>
<p>How Mr. Charles Gregory, who, I understand, has been appointed
as my second in command, can justify his taking so important a
step as over-riding all the directions I had given for the
proceedings of my party during my own absence, seeing that I was
expected back every day, remains yet to be seen. Had that
gentleman had the patience to have waited for a few days longer,
I should myself have been back at my camp, and all this loss of
time and extra wear and tear and fatigue to the horses would have
been avoided. I regret this delay the more, because the uncertain
fate of Messrs. Stuart and Forster makes it desirable for me, at
once, to start with a strong party, northwards, to their relief.
I will only further observe, in connection with this matter, that
I had been left with eight pack horses and four saddle horses in
all; two of the draught horses left at the camp being unfitted
for packs, whilst there are twelve pack-saddles at the
camp&mdash;thus, even the number of horses left at my camp was
most unnecessarily reduced below the means at my disposal for the
transport of stores by pack-horses.</p>
<p>In my last report (No. 13), I stated that I considered my
difficulty of transport at an end for the present. All my stores
are at the Elizabeth &mdash;I have, now no more sandhills and
scrub between my camp and Lake Campbell; and, what is more
important still, between Lake Campbell and the fresh-water lakes.
These lakes or waters have been "described so often by so many
different blacks of different tribes to different parties, that I
think a considerable degree of reliance may be placed upon their
statements. I have now before me a copy of a map frequently
traced upon the sand by "black Jemmy", a black whom I left at my
camp, always giving the same relative bearings to the same
places, and the same account of the waters, which agrees in many
points, both names and description, with information previously
obtained from other blacks. The stages from Lake Campbell,
according to Jemmy, are Arkoona, water coming out of a cave about
which mallee trees grow. This statement of the kind of trees
about Arkoona, makes it probable that there is a limestone rock,
the most likely of all rocks in which to find a cave&mdash;thus
the incidental point, of the kind of trees, renders Jemmy's
account, unknown to himself, the more consistent. Next is
Cottabidnya, a large lake, the country about being inhabited by
lllaree blacks. The direction of these two places from Lake
Campbell (or Pidla-wirra, as the blacks call it), is, according
to Jemmy, about north-west. As a corroboration of the truth of
this statement, is the fact that, when penetrating the scrub in a
north-west direction from Wirra Wirralu, or "Smith's", I got into
the country inhabited by the Illaree blacks. Some blacks, at this
moment at Port Augusta, also pointed to the west and north-west
as being the country of the Illaree blacks, of whom the other
blacks appear all to be afraid. From Cottabidnya, you turn more
to the north, and come to Kommaroo, a water which dries up. A
blackfellow, met with at Thompson's station, gave Mr. Harris a
nearly similar name to a water beyond Cottabidnya,
viz.&mdash;Kommaroo, where he said there were ducks. The next
stage from Kommaroo is Woonamulla, another water which, Jemmy
says, dries up; and then, due north, is Wingelbunna, a large deep
lake, with gum trees and kangaroo, and plenty of blackfellows.
The last water of which we could get any positive account is the
next stage to Wingelbunna, also north, viz.&mdash;Tuna-midi,
another lake with gum trees. Beyond this point he either cannot
or will not give any detailed account of waters; but we have
extracted from him the names of Kundanyimbo, a large lake
north-west of Tunamidi. He also gives the names of waters by an
easterly route to Wingelbunna, but describes them as all,
excepting one, drying up; and vague accounts of other waters to
the north-east. You will observe that there is a peculiarity in
the statement of this black, which, in my opinion, gives an air
of probability to the whole of it, namely, the candid admission
that some of the waters he describes dry up. Had he wished merely
to say what he thought would be favorably received, he would
have, most probably, represented all the waters as being
permanent. Beyond Cottabidnya, he seemed unwilling to proceed
with us, as the blacks in that direction were not to be depended
upon, and the names and description of the other stages were
extracted from him with difficulty; but he always represented
them as having the same position and relative bearings, when once
we attained the clue to their names, and could thus question him
directly as to their position. All my experience of the country
tends to convince me that these waters are situated in what I
have called the stony land, which I have already ascertained to
extend for about ninety miles to the north-west, and which
probably extends much farther still, so that I confidently expect
to reach them with my drays, and thus take up a strong and united
party to them&mdash;which I could not do if my only means of
transport were a small number of pack-horses&mdash;a precaution
which becomes more necessary from the accounts, all agreeing
together, as to the number of blacks. Plenty of blacks, fresh
water lakes, gum trees, and kangaroo, may, I think, be taken as
tolerably certain indications of a good country; whilst the
reasons which I assigned in my last report for believing that
either sienite, felspar, porphyry, or similar rocks, all
affording good soil by their disintegration, extend far up
towards the north-west interior; and the ascertained fact of the
rise of the lakes towards the same point, all strongly
corroborate my anticipations respecting the nature of the
country.</p>
<p align="center">            I have, &amp;c.,</p>
<p align="right">B. HERSCHEL BABBAGE.      </p>
<p>The Hon. the Commissioner of Crown Lands.</p>
<p>P.S.&mdash;I enclose:&mdash;1. A statement from Mr. Harris,
explaining under what circumstances he took charge of the drays
and horses, with a note of my own as to his reasons for not
attempting to report his movements to me at Thompson's, and
remarks on Mr. Gregory's proceedings. 2. A certificate of the
names of the parties at present engaged in the expedition. 3. A
schedule of amounts paid to Mr. Harris on account of the
expedition, out of money I have from time to time advanced to
him. As the vouchers for these amounts are at the Elizabeth, and
I may not have an opportunity of forwarding them for some time, I
should feel obliged by your directing the payment, say, of
&pound;40, to my account, at the Bank of Australasia, the balance
to be paid on the receipt of the vouchers and other documents.
Mr. Harris has seen Mr. Sleep, and can therefore give you a more
correct account than I can of the statement of the black who went
out with, and apparently deserted, Messrs. Stuart and Forster. I
can only express my conviction that, from the extension of Lake
Gairdner to the north or north-west, their retreat to Streaky Bay
is, if not impossible, at least a matter of extreme
difficulty.</p>
<hr>
<p align="right"><small><a name="ch-02" id="ch-02"></a>Mount
Remarkable, September 8th, 1858.      </small></p>
<p><small>Sir&mdash;In reply to interrogatories by you, as to my
reason for bringing a portion of the horses and equipments
belonging to the expedition thus far on my way to town, I have to
state that in my instructions received from the Commissioner of
Crown Lands recalling me to Adelaide, I am directed to bring back
any horses and other equipments you might have to spare in
carrying out the arrangements consequent on Mr. Gregory's
accession to the party; and in pursuance of these directions I
have taken charge of the horses and drays which Mr. Gregory,
acting as chief in command in your absence, declared to be
surplus. He has retained twelve horses, in addition to the three
you have out with you. He also retained one dray, for the removal
of those things which could not be carried on pack-horses. This
amount of transport means he considered sufficient, and at his
request I have taken charge of the remainder.</small></p>
<p align="center"><small>            I have, &amp;c.,</small></p>
<p align="right"><small>W. G. HARRIS.      </small></p>
<p><small>B. H. Babbage, Esq.</small></p>
<p><small>In reply to your further inquiry, "Why I did not report
to you afterwards at Thompson's", I beg to say that owing to
conflicting accounts I received at Port Augusta, I was not
certain as to whether you would be there or not and I did not
feel justified in losing the time to return there.</small></p>
<p align="right"><small>W.G.H.      </small></p>
<p><small>NOTE.&mdash;Mr. Harris arrived at Minchin's Wells on
Sunday afternoon, and went himself to Port Augusta that evening,
when he was informed by Mr. Hood that I had gone on to
Thompson's. Mr. Harris remained at the Wells or the Port all
Monday, whilst some of the horses were being shod, and did not
finally leave the Wells for Mount Remarkable until (as I was
there informed) twelve o'clock on Tuesday. The Wells are an easy
day's journey from Thompson's&mdash;about eighteen miles. Thus
the only delay that would have taken place by Mr. Harris having
either returned himself to Thompson's, or sending a letter to me
reporting his proceedings (which latter at any rate, he ought to
have done upon the mere chance of its reaching me) would have
been half a day. Mr. Gregory waited four days only at my camp
after reaching the Elizabeth, and then took, upon himself to
break up my party; although it was well known, from the time I
had been absent, that, unless some accident had happened to me I
must be back in a very few days at the farthest. Mr. Gregory, in
so doing, exceeded any reasonable authority that he might be
supposed to have as second in command. He ought, in my opinion,
to have waited until I returned before venturing upon so
important a step. Nor do I see the slightest reason why the drays
might not have been left at the Elizabeth, when they would have
been again available bad altered circumstances made it desirable.
Messrs. Burtt and Swinden, about to proceed there with cattle,
would, T have not the slightest doubt, have readily taken charge
of them; whilst their strong iron wheels and axles make the most
important portion of them indestructible by the blacks, in the
event of those parties not arriving so soon as is
anticipated.</small></p>
<p align="right"><small>B. HERSCHEL BABBAGE.      </small></p>
<hr>
<p>No. 15.</p>
<p align="right"><a name="ch-03" id="ch-03"></a>Port Augusta,
11th September, 1858.      </p>
<p>Sir&mdash;I have the honor to forward you a few lines to
inform you of my arrival here this afternoon, <i>en route</i> for
the Elizabeth. I have taken the opportunity of sending up by the
empty drays a large number of spare shoes for the horses, as the
wear and tear of these articles has proved much greater than was
anticipated, and Mr. Gregory brought none up with him.</p>
<p>I was delayed half a day at the Mount, as it was necessary to
get some of the horses shod before taking them back. One of the
horses "Captain", a grey draught horse had received a kick from
one of the other horses, and was so lame by the time that Mr.
Harris arrived at the Mount that it was impossible to take it
back, under which circumstances I left it (as Mr. Harris had
proposed doing, before I arrived) with Corporal Saunders,
requesting him to blister its leg and let it run in the police
paddock until you sent directions as to its disposal. I also left
with the Corporal a kangaroo dog, which Mr. Harris brought down
from the camp, directing him to dispose of it to the best
advantage on account of the Government.</p>
<p>I have, I believe, sufficiently expressed my opinion as to the
very hasty and ill-considered step taken by Mr. Gregory in my
temporary absence, of sending so large a portion of the men,
horses, and drays back to Adelaide; I have, however, received
some further information from Mr. Harris which makes it necessary
again to advert to this matter. Both Mr. Harris himself and the
men who have returned from the camp, are decidedly of opinion
that the draught and saddle-horses sent back by Mr. Gregory are
superior even as pack-horses only, to the nine Mr. Gregory
brought up with him. Mr. Harris informs me that, in moving the
stores from the main camp to the Elizabeth, which was effected by
the joint action of the drays and pack-horses&mdash;he always
loaded one of the old horses, and that by no means one of the
most powerful, with 200lb., a weight far exceeding the average
weight carried by Mr. Gregory's horses. It would appear then a
great waste of time and money, and wear and tear of horseflesh,
to take nine horses all the way from Adelaide to the Elizabeth,
and to send back twelve equally as good from the Elizabeth to
town. In Mr. Gregory's calculations, in which he reduced the
number of available pack-horses to eight, he does not appear to
have left in reserve any horses to replace those unable to be
used in consequence of a kick or other injury. As an accession to
my means of transport by pack-horses, the nine brought up by Mr.
Gregory will be most useful, but as substitutes for those already
in use, there would have been a positive loss by the exchange.
One of the men sent down by Mr. Gregory was to have returned from
Adelaide to the Elizabeth with despatches for the party. Mr.
Gregory can scarcely have been aware that there is postal
communication as far as Port Augusta, or he never would have made
so expensive an arrangement.</p>
<p>Mr. Harris informs me that Mr. Gregory sent down by him a
report to you, stating that in his opinion it would be impossible
for the party to remain out during the summer, as the water would
dry up. I must beg to differ entirely from my second in command
in this point. Mr. Gregory had been only four days arrived at the
Elizabeth when he made this report, and had not seen the largest
waterhole there, only four and a-half miles distant from the
camp, and of course had not seen Smith's Waterholes or any of the
other waters in Swinden's country. Whilst upon this subject, I
may mention that Mr. Swinden himself came out to the Elizabeth in
order to inspect the water there before sending out his cattle,
and that the result of this careful re-examination of the waters
is, that both he and Burtt have decided to send out a quantity of
cattle to the Elizabeth and to Smith's, Thus Mr. Swinden is
prepared to risk a large amount of property upon his judgment of
the permanency of waters, which in the hasty opinion of Mr.
Gregory will not maintain my small party. Mr. Gregory, I
understand, is anxious to return to Sydney in December. The men
who are with him I am informed on all hands Would be a most
valuable permanent addition to my party, and I should feel much
obliged if you could arrange with the Sydney Government for a
further extension of their leave of absence. Mr. Gregory's own
services I can well dispense with.</p>
<p>Upon my return to the Elizabeth, I shall carry out, as well as
the altered circumstances will admit, my previous arrangements;
which I believe, from what I hear from Mr. Harris, will fully
meet the spirit of your last instructions which await me at the
Elizabeth.</p>
<p>I intend, upon my arrival, at once to commence moving my party
by help of the drays to Smith's main waterholes; and shall,
meanwhile, prepare to start northwards with a small party, to
consist of Mr. Gregory and his two men, Jones, Warriner, Herrgott
and myself. From either Tuna-midi or Wingelbunna, supposing I
find either of them adapted for my purpose, I shall dispatch
Warriner and Herrgott back with orders to bring on thither my
main camp; and shall, meanwhile, lead the remainder of the party
onwards to further exploration, possibly sending back directions
to be busied in some previously-arranged plan, for my main camp
to be advanced still further, if I find the country suitable.
Thus, whilst availing myself even more fully than Mr. Gregory had
arranged, of the advantage of pack-horses (as I can then have the
whole twelve packsaddles in use), my main party can be brought on
by means of the drays, so as to have both operations going on at
the same time, and maintain a constantly advancing main camp,
upon which the exploring party can fall back in case of
accident.</p>
<p>I learn from the man, from whose house Messrs. Stuart and
Forster started on their expedition, that Mr. Stuart had obtained
from the black who accompanied him the same names of a water
Wingelbunna described by him too, as a lake with gum-trees, as
had been given to me by "Jemmy" the black I left at my camp. As
the two blacks are of different tribes, this is another
corroboration of the general truth of this statement.</p>
<p align="center">            I have, &amp;c.,</p>
<p align="right">B. HERSCHEL BABBAGE.            <br>
Commanding the Northern Exploring Expedition.      </p>
<p>The Hon. the Commissioner of Crown Lands.</p>
<p>P.S.&mdash;Mr. Harris informs me that he found the wooden
dray, which I mentioned as left by him at this place,
unserviceable, in the sandhills, the iron ones being far
superior. As I have now the extra pack-horses brought up by Mr.
Gregory, I do not think it worth while to take this dray up to
the Elizabeth. Mr. Tassie thinks it will sell better here than in
town; perhaps you would be kind enough to give directions to Mr.
Tassie either to sell it or to forward it to town, as you may
determine. It is the dray which I got at Port Lincoln, and was
the one purchased for Mr. Hack's expedition. It is in very good
order and condition.</p>
<hr>
<p align="right"><a name="ch-04" id="ch-04"></a>Camp at the
Elizabeth, September 23, 1858.     <br></p>
<p>Sir&mdash;I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch,
502-28, dated 9th September, and learn therefrom that the late
despatches, received up to that date, from Mr. Charles Gregory,
Mr. Harris, and myself, having been submitted to the Government,
they entirely disapprove of my proceedings, as shown in those
despatches.</p>
<p>The charges against me appear, from your above-mentioned
despatches, to be&mdash;</p>
<p>1st. That I have misunderstood the printed instructions of 9th
February last.</p>
<p>2nd. That, when I struck Lake Gairdner, I proceeded
<i>southwards</i> into Hack's country, and thence to Port
Augusta, instead of going northwards.</p>
<p>3rd. That I remained a week at Port Augusta, knowing that Mr.
Gregory had gone on to my camp at the Elizabeth; and that the
consequence of this delay, on my part, was that Mr. Gregory had
to give up the important occupation of seeking for permanent
fresh water, in advance of the Elizabeth, and to go out to look
for me.</p>
<p>4th, and lastly. That I failed in the important duty of
ascertaining whether there were fresh water in advance of my
camp.</p>
<p>As regards No. 1, I beg to point out, that the printed
instructions state that the primary objects to be obtained by the
expedition are briefly&mdash;</p>
<p>The thorough exploration, as far as practicable, of the
country lying between the western shore of Lake Torrens, and the
eastern shore of Lake Gairdner, and thence northwards.</p>
<p>The surveying and mapping of the western shore of Lake
Torrens. The surveying and mapping of the eastern and northern
shores of Lake Gairdner, accurately laying down on the map all
remarkable ranges, lakes, fresh water springs, and water-holes.
The instructions then go on to say, "Having performed this
service, as completely as circumstances will admit of, you will
be at liberty to push your explorations northerly."</p>
<p>I certainly understood, from these instructions, that I was to
survey and map the country between the eastern shore of Lake
Gairdner and the western shore of Lake Torrens, including the
shores of the lakes themselves, and that I was then, as I worked
northward, to lay down the northern shore of Lake Gairdner; and
that not until I had fulfilled these directions, was I at liberty
to push my explorations northerly&mdash;and that I was,
consequently, bound to survey the eastern shore of Lake Gairdner,
which I did for a distance of about 45 miles. You will, Sir,
observe, by the enclosed tracing, that the moment I found the
shores turned south, where Messrs. Hack and Harris had
<i>really</i> been, I pushed on to obtain provisions. In order to
carry out these instructions, I had directed Mr. Harris, my then
only officer, to advance the main camp from Thompson's to the
Elizabeth, and to avail himself of his leisure time in surveying
and mapping the western shores of Lake Torrens, in the vicinity
of his line of route, whilst I surveyed and mapped the country,
and, as far as practicable, thoroughly explored it&mdash;first,
along my intended line of route, by Beda and Pernatty to the
Elizabeth, then on to Smith's Waterholes and the mirage lagoon
northwards, and Lake Younghusband to the north-west, after which
I surveyed and mapped the neighborhood of the Island Lake (great
Salt Lake of my earlier despatches), and, lastly, such a portion
of the eastern shores of Lake Gairdner as my means of
subsistence, at the time, enabled me to do; nor do I see any
better way in which I could have carried out my instructions, as
it was not until my last discovery of the great Salt or Island
Lake that it became necessary, whilst the expedition itself was
moving northwards, to run down southwards along the
<i>eastern</i> shore of Lake Gairdner.</p>
<p>Charge No. 2&mdash;That when I struck Lake Gairdner, I
proceeded southward into Hack's country, and thence to Port
Augusta, instead of going northwards.</p>
<p>I have to observe, with reference to this charge, that when I
struck Lake Gairdner, in about latitude 31&deg; 37', I had only a
few days' provisions left, owing to the time which had been
consumed in surveying and mapping the winding shores of the
Island Lake; and that my companion Warriner and myself had been
upon short allowance for some time back; it became then,
absolutely necessary for our safety to make for some point where
provisions could be obtained. We were, at that time, about 90
miles from the Elizabeth, 85 from Beda, and 110 from Coroona.</p>
<p>The safest course would, undoubtedly, have been to have
returned by Oakden's Hills to the Elizabeth; but I should, in
that case, have gone through a line of country which I had
already explored and laid down upon my map. Between our position
and Beda I knew that a thick scrub intervened; and, as the rain
waters were rapidly drying up, I doubted whether we should be
able to get through safely. I had also to calculate upon the
possibility that the whole of my camp had been moved from Beda,
and that no provisions had been left for us there, a contingency
which I thought extremely unlikely (although, as I will presently
show, it was actually the case), and that we must push on,
without provisions, to the Elizabeth, at least 60 miles
distant.</p>
<p>In your despatch of the 9th you state, that my most obvious
course was, from this place, to trace the shores of Lake Gairdner
<i>northwards</i>. A glance at the accompanying tracing of my
late exploration will at once show, that, by so doing, I should
have put the Island, or Great Salt Lake, between me and the
Elizabeth; and either must have again crossed the channel,
between the Island Lake and the Red Lake, which I had
accomplished, not without risk, on a previous occasion, or have
headed the Red Lake itself. I had already been three days without
water for my horses in this very country, and had ascertained, as
far as that portion of the Great Salt Lake, lying north of it was
concerned, what your despatch expressly states was important to
know, namely, that <i>it was not connected</i> with Lake
Gairdner, as I had then completely surveyed that portion of the
Great Salt Lake lying north of me. There remained then only to
clear up the doubt I had, as to the possibility of Lake
MacFarlane, another of the numerous branches of the Great Salt
Lake, situated to the south-east of my position, and which
appeared, from a neighboring hill, to be trending westwards,
being connected with Lake Gairdner. By taking the course I
finally decided upon, and running the eastern shores of Lake
Gairdner southwards, I ascertained that there was no connection
whatsoever between the chain of salt lakes I had discovered, from
Lake Younghusband, in the north-west, down to Lake MacFarlane,
the most southerly of the group, and Lake Gairdner. By examining
the enclosed tracing you will see, that the discrepancy between
the eastern and northern shores of Lake Gairdner, as laid down
upon Hack's map, and the position in which I struck the lake was
such, as to leave it doubtful whether the lake I had reached was
really Lake Gairdner, or whether Lake Gairdner did not terminate
in about latitude 31&deg; 45', to which point Hack's map,
erroneously, shows the shores to be trending, and a new lake
commence, thus leaving a passage between them similar to those
between Spencer's Gulf and Lake Torrens; my proceeding
<i>southward</i> cleared up this doubt. Having, for these
reasons, decided upon going to Coroona, along the eastern shores
of Lake Gairdner, I then, naturally, pushed on to Port Augusta to
get my horses shod and rest them, before returning to the
north.</p>
<p>Charge No. 3&mdash;That I remained a week at Port Augusta,
knowing that Mr. Gregory had gone on to my camp at the Elizabeth,
and that the consequence of this delay, on my part, was that Mr.
Gregory had to give up the important occupation of seeking for
permanent fresh water, in advance of the Elizabeth, and go out to
look for me.</p>
<p>I arrived at Port Augusta on Sunday, when I learned that Mr.
Gregory had passed, on his way to my camp, with two men and nine
horses, as stated in your despatch. I had received no letters,
either official or private, for two months; and was,
consequently, entirely in the dark as to the capacity in which
Mr. Gregory had gone up. I learned, however, from public rumour,
that my request, to have Mr. Harris recalled, had been acceded
to, and that Mr. Gregory had undertaken to bring me up a
reinforcement of horses. Having asked to have Mr. Harris
recalled, on the grounds that I could do without his services,
and thus save the expense to the expedition, of his salary, I did
not imagine that Mr. Gregory had been appointed in his place,
still less had I any reason to suppose that a third officer had
been appointed also, inasmuch as the Government had refused to
allow me a third officer, as an unnecessary expense, previous to
my starting with the expedition. As I had appointed Beda, as the
place to which I intended myself to return, I thought it probable
that I should meet Mr. Gregory there, if the camp were not
entirely removed from that place.</p>
<p>I had, moreover, no reason to suppose, until I subsequently
heard it through Mr. Harris, that our absence caused any anxiety
at the camp, respecting our fate. I knew Mr. Harris was there,
and that he had once himself proposed to take nearly the same
route, which circumstances had forced upon me, namely, to go from
Oakden's Hills to the eastern shores of Lake Gairdner, and thence
southwards by Hack's country, <i>vi&acirc;</i> Coroona, to Port
Augusta.</p>
<p>I did not succeed in getting the horses shod, and the spare
shoes, I wished to take up for them made, before Wednesday, as
the blacksmith at the Port was going to Adelaide by the steamer,
and had to finish other jobs in hand. The steamer, due on Tuesday
with the mail, did not arrive till Friday, and then brought me no
letters. Having waited so long, and the Overland Mail being due
on Saturday, I determined to wait another day for it, as I was
anxious both to get further despatches and to take up the latest
letters for the party, previous to our final move northwards. I
confess that I looked upon this delay, amounting in all to but 3
days, with less regret, both because it gave additional rest to
my horses, and because entire change of diet, although only for a
few days, was likely to prove beneficial to the health of my
companion and myself, now upwards of five months in the bush.</p>
<p>Your above-mentioned despatch states, that my obvious duty
was, the very next day after my arrival at Port Augusta, to have
proceeded, by easy stages, although the horses were tired, to
join Mr. Gregory at the Elizabeth. I only wish it were possible
to get through this road by easy stages. The first stage, from
Port Augusta to Thompson's, is twenty miles, without intermediate
water. From Thompson's to Beda is forty miles, also without
water. Even at Beda it was extremely doubtful whether any water
at all remained. From Beda to Yeltacowie, where it was possible
water might still be found, is, by the tracks, nearly, if not
quite, fifty miles; a great part through a heavy scrub and
sandhills. From Yeltacowie the Elizabeth may be reached in about
twenty-three miles, by taking a short cut through the scrub. It
is true that water had been left in some tanks at Beda, and also
at Pernatty Plains; but I was not aware of this fact. The
difficulty of getting through this road was fatal to poor
Coulthard; and several of the parties who, last year, preceded
me, were obliged to abandon horses upon it. At any rate, I must
have remained to have the horses shod, because this country
cannot be traversed, with impunity, by horses without shoes; as a
proof of which, I may mention, that two of the horses belonging
to the expedition were lamed for a time, by being driven, without
shoes, from the Elizabeth to Beda, by Mr. Harris's orders, during
my absence.</p>
<p>4th, and lastly&mdash;That I failed in the important duty of
ascertaining whether there were fresh water in advance of my
camp.</p>
<p>This charge I must, most respectfully deny altogether. By
looking at my previous despatches you will see that, when my camp
was at the small salt lagoon near the crossing of Lake Torrens, I
pushed on a-head, as early as practicable, on foot to Beda and
Pernatty in search of water. That on the 18th May I visited
Smith's smaller waterhole, Corriberribera of the natives, and on
the 21st May struck the Elizabeth. That, although I questioned
whether these waters would prove permanent, if exposed to the
drain of a large number of stock, they would, I thought, maintain
my small party. Further, on the 20th June, I made Wirrawirralie,
Smith's main waterholes, in my opinion, also, more than
sufficient to maintain my party throughout the summer. I have, in
my previous despatch, No. 15, dated 11th September, stated the
facts, that Mr. Swinden was about to send cattle to the
Elizabeth, as he believed the waters permanent, of which there
are several more that I have not yet seen. That, on passing
Thompson's station, I found Mr. Burtt shoeing his horses and
mustering his cattle, with the intention of moving them, also, to
the Elizabeth. I have now to inform you, that Mr. Macdonald, from
the neighborhood of the Burra, is now here with a flock of 2,000
sheep, which he is going to move on to Smith's main waterholes, a
place he visited on a previous occasion. Thus, experienced
stockowners are moving their cattle up to these waters,
practically confirming the conclusion I came to, namely, that
they would be sufficient, at any rate, for the support of my own
small party through the summer. These waters, Corriberribera and
Wirrawirralie, are both in advance of my present position, the
latter being only 25 miles from Lake Campbell. I have not
considered it necessary to pay an immediate visit to Lake
Campbell, as the feed in the neighborhood of it was described to
me as not being particularly good, and Smith's Wirrawirralie was
recommended to me as a far preferable place for a
dep&ocirc;t.</p>
<p>Your despatch of the 9th states, that the distance traversed
by me, during six months, does not exceed 100 miles from the
settled districts. On examining the map, you will find Lake
Reynolds is almost 140 miles from the crossing of Lake Torrens.
The actual distance travelled by me, with a single companion,
through a country, certainly very deficient in water, exceeds 800
miles. It ought, also, to be remembered, that the expedition
started from Port Augusta on 1st March, and that no rain fell
until the 18th April; thus, the first two months it was
impossible to do more, from want of water, than advance the party
by help of the stills.</p>
<p>I have, in previous despatches, explained the difficulty I was
in, both from the want of men and horses for my northern
exploration, owing to my desire not to throw the slightest
impediment in the way of Mr. Harris making the survey, I had
directed, of the western shores of Lake Torrens, and moving the
main camp onwards. That Mr. Harris's progress, with the removal
of the stores, has been extremely slow, and that I have been very
much disappointed by it, I candidly admit. I had, however, as you
are aware, no other officer to whom to entrust this duty. Mr.
Harris is, by this time, in Adelaide, and I must refer you to him
for further explanations, as to the reason of his slow
progress.</p>
<p>I have, in my letter from Mount Remarkable, related how I had
overtaken Mr. Harris, on his way to town, with a large portion of
the equipments belonging to the expedition; I now beg leave to
forward you a list of the things that were being taken down by
him, with notes of those left by him at the camp, not including
those brought up by Mr. Gregory.</p>
<p>2 of the best saddles and bridles, complete (4 left at the
camp); 6 sets of horse harness (3 left at the camp); 2 tether
ropes; 12 pair of hobbles (6 left at the camp); 2 shoeing
hammers, 1 of these is supposed to have been taken by mistake (1
left at the camp); 4 spare straps to mend hobbles; 2 old
headstall bridles; 2 horse bells and straps (2 left at the camp);
8 neck straps (6 left at the camp); 1 vulcanized horse bucket (2
left at the camp); 1 saucepan; 1 tomahawk (2 left at the camp); 1
axe (3 left at the camp); 2 syphons; 2 shepherd's canteens (2
left at the camp); 2 quart pots and pannicans; 50 lbs. flour; 10
lbs. sugar; 3 lbs. tea; a box made for holding the instruments,
and to be used as a table for drawing plans; 1 telescope; 2
compasses; 1 sextant; 1 artificial horizon; 2 iron-wheeled spring
drays; 12 horses.</p>
<p>I also enclosed a statement, in writing, by Mr. Harris, that
he was taking down these equipments by directions of his
successor, Mr. Gregory. Mr. Harris stated to me, personally, that
he had nothing whatever to do with it. Mr. Phibbs, however, who
is at the camp, assures me, that this was not the case. He says,
that Mr. Gregory declined to interfere, stating, that his command
did not commence until the other had left, and that Mr. Harris,
himself, selected and took the things away. Komole, one of the
most efficient of my party, says, that Mr. Harris endeavored to
persuade him to return with him to town; stating, that as he, Mr.
Harris was recalled, the agreement to serve on the expedition,
signed by the men, was broken, and that they were, therefore,
released from their engagement.</p>
<p>I have further to inform you, that Mr. Harris withdrew the
whole camp from Beda, the place which I had named as being the
point to which I intended, if possible, to make, without leaving
any provisions there whatsoever, in case Warriner and I arrived;
although he knew, from the time we had been absent, that our
supplies must be exhausted. This remissness, which might, under
the circumstances I have detailed, have cost us our lives, did
not arise from forgetfulness, because Komole had suggested to him
the necessity of leaving a supply at that place.</p>
<p>I have also to report, that Mr. Harris heard, when at
Thompson's station, on his way down, that Warriner and I were
about to start back from Port Augusta, along the western side of
the Gulf, whilst his course was on the eastern side, and that he
neglected to take any steps whatsoever to inform me of the most
important fact, that water had been left for our use, and for the
use of any return party, in tanks at two places on the line of
route, namely, at Beda camp and at the Pernatty Plains. Mr.
Harris stated to me, as reported in my despatch from Mount
Remarkable, that the sending away of two drays, twelve horses and
three men from the party was done by directions of Mr. Gregory,
and that he, Mr. Harris, only acted under the directions of the
latter gentleman. I now learn from Mr. Gregory, who has returned
to the camp since the above was written, that this statement is
wholly incorrect, and that this attempt to break up all my plans
was the sole act of Mr. Harris.</p>
<p>I beg leave, therefore, to withdraw the remarks I made, in my
former despatches, under this false impression, as to Mr. Gregory
acting in so important a matter at a time when I was daily
expected at the camp. The whole blame of this proceeding, I find,
ought to rest with Mr. Harris.</p>
<p>I regret to state, that Mr. Gregory and Mr. Phibbs are obliged
to return to Adelaide, as the time during which I propose to be
absent, on my next excursion northwards, will far exceed the time
which they are able to devote to assisting me in this expedition.
I very much regret this circumstance, as by it I shall lose two
most efficient and zealous coadjutors, as well as agreeable
companions.</p>
<p>I propose starting on an extended excursion to the north the
day after Mr. Gregory leaves, and have made arrangements for the
gradual removal of my camp northwards, by aid of the drays and
such pack-horses as I can spare, and I confidently anticipate, by
help of the efficient reinforcement of horses so opportunely
sent, but so nearly snatched away by the unauthorized proceedings
of Mr. Harris, to be able to do this without any further
difficulty.</p>
<p>Mr. Gregory, who kindly takes charge of this despatch, will be
able to give you a lull account of all the late movements.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;I enclose the nine vouchers for the accounts
forwarded in my letter from Mount Remarkable You will observe a

and thus correct the positions of my previous trip.</p>
<hr>
<p align="right"><a name="ch-05" id="ch-05"></a>Port Augusta,
21st November, 1858.      </p>
<p>Sir&mdash;I beg leave to acknowledge the receipt, upon the
14th November of your letter of the 23rd September, in which you
briefly inform me that the Government have directed Major
Warburton to proceed to join my camp and to supersede me in the
command of the expedition. You also, in the same letter, direct
me to make arrangements for my return to Adelaide forthwith The
letter in question assigns no reason whatever for such a
proceeding on the part ol the Government. I have, however, in
obedience to your directions handed over my command to Major
Warburton, and have to report my own arrival at this place
yesterday, having accompanied from the north the party lately
under my charge. I have now the honor to forward you a report of
my proceedings since the date of my last despatch,
viz.&mdash;22nd September.</p>
<p>Messrs. Gregory and Phibbs left my camp at the Elizabeth, on
the 27th September, upon their return to Adelaide; and upon the
following day I started, northward, with Warriner, Herrgott
Jones, and Pegler, together with Oombatta, a Weeleroo black, who
agreed to accompany us. I took six riding horses and seven
pack-horses for the use of the party My original intention had
been, if I found, after four or five days' journey, a good place
to which to move on temporarily the main camp, until my own
return from the north with a sufficient supply of water upon the
road, to have sent Warriner and Herrgott back to bring on the
main party whilst I continued my explorations in the north as
long as the season would permit. As I found the route by which I
went out not adapted for the removal of the main party, I kept
Warriner and Herrgott with me during the whole time I was
out.</p>
<p>My first stage was to Wirrawirralu, Smith's main Waterhole,
which I have before described The water, although, of course,
lower than when I had seen it in the winter, was about five feet
deep, and promised to hold out, I think, all the summer, but
certainly sufficiently long for my purpose&mdash;namely, as a
stage for the removal of my party on their way to the summer
dep&ocirc;t.</p>
<p>From Smith's Waterhole I went to Emu Springs, a small
waterhole, in a creek running into the Shell Lagoon. There does
not appear to be the least sign o any spring in this waterhole,
and the water had become so brackish that many of the horses
would not drink of it The middle of the next day saw us at Lake
Campbell, which was, as I anticipated quite dry, and had
apparently been so for some months. In the neighborhood of Lake
Campbell the usual salt bush plains was strewed with pieces of
very sharp rugged chalcedony and quartz but on approaching
Berulla&mdash;a small dry creek&mdash;where we camped, the ground
became more sandy, and alternated between open plains and belts
of scrub; there was no water at this place but very good feed
From, Berulla we went to Arkoona, a native well, in latitude
30&deg; 40' south, and longitude 136&deg; 12' east. The first
part of the journey was over alternate plains of open country and
belts of scrub; but, on approaching Arkoona, they gave place to
low sandrises covered with mulga scrub amongst which were some
large polygonum flats. The feed was very fair the whole way.
Arkoona is situated in a small hollow in the middle of a large
open plain. On descending into he hollow, a wall of limestone
conglomerate rock presents itself; underneath which, is a small
hole scooped down some feet into the gravel at the foot of the
rock. The surface of the water is ten feet below the level of the
ground, and it drains in at the rate of eight to twelve gallons
an hour, so that is was very tedious work watering our twelve
horses. There can be no doubt that the black account of the
permanency of the present supply of water is correct; and I am
inclined to think that if the hole were enlarged, a good
permanent supply might be obtained, sufficient for the use of a
station, although I doubt very much whether enough could be
obtained for watering any number of cattle. The country about
Arkoona is very well grassed, chiefly with spear-grass. At this
place we met a good many blacks&mdash;both Weeleroos and Illaree;
this water being used in common by both tribes.</p>
<p>The next stage from Arkoona was Ma&euml;rty, about nineteen
miles to the E.N.E., the country consisting still of low
sandrises covered with open scrub, having salt-bush plains
between them. On leaving Arkoona the spear-grass gradually
ceased, a tufty grass taking its place? For about four or five
miles out of the whole distance the sandhills were very high and
close together, and the feed very poor. Ma&euml;rty is a
rain-water channel leading out of a large clay-pan, in an open
valley; and but for the rain which subsequently fell, the water
would not have lasted more than a month from the time of our
seeing it.</p>
<p>From Ma&euml;rty we went about twenty-nine miles N.E. to
Curdlawidry; the firs eighteen miles consisting of scrubby
sandrises, with small open plains between them; in places there
is a thick mulga scrub, and in other places high sandridges with
pines becomes more open and the feed improves. Curdlawidry is a
rain-water channel in a bamboo swamp. The water appears to last
well into the summer, and from the open character of the country
about, and the absence of sand, is readily replenished by the
smallest rains. The next morning, the 5th October, we moved on
about eight miles west, and came to a fine large waterhole called
by the blacks "Wonnomulla". It is about a mile in length, and
varies from forty to seventy yards in width; the greatest depth
of water which we observed was, however, only 5ft. 3in. The usual
depth was 3ft., close to the shores, and 4ft. 6in. to 5ft. in the
middle. It is surrounded by a kind of rugged stunted gum tree. I
halted the main party three days at this waterhole, whilst I went
out with Warriner to examine the country to the north. I found
that there was no regular creek running into this waterhole, but
that it drew its supply from the drainage of extensive plains
containing large bamboo swamps, in which I found a little water.
The country is not so sandy as it is further south, and
consequently the rain-water drains off almost directly into the
waterhole, and thus a small amount of rain keeps up the supply, I
have very little doubt but that the heavy rain of the 26th
October must have raised this water at least two feet, and that
it would be found to last throughout the whole summer. From
Wonnomulla we took a general N.E. direction, and in about
twenty-one miles, made Weelpidderuna, another of the numerous
rain-waterholes we met with, fed by bamboo swamps. The first part
of the journey was through open country and bamboo flats, with
good feed; then low sandridges with salt-bush plains, and a fair
sprinkling of grass, followed by higher sandridges crowned by
pines, with occasionally large open valleys, with good feed, and
clay-pans, succeeded again by similar wearisome sandridges. The
last eight miles is over open plains, with occasional low
sandridges, and abundant feed. Weeringelbunna or Weeringilpa, is
a water situated about eleven miles N.N.E. from the last place,
although, as the black took us a circuitous route, our journey
was considerably longer. Soon after leaving Weelpidderuna, our
route took us into open plains, with very good feed, and
occasional small bamboo flats. At about nine miles, we ascended a
very high sandhill, from which we had an extensive view over open
country. On descending the hill and continuing our journey the
feed was very good; but upon approaching Weeringelbunna the plain
became stony, with many bare patches covered by fine gravel. At
places, wherever there was the least drainage, the feed was very
good indeed.</p>
<p>Weeringelbunna is a waterhole situated at the place where the
plain slopes down to a hollow at the foot of a sandy rise. Two or
three short stunted gum creeks run into the hole, as well as
several channels which wind through bamboo flats, by which the
hole is almost surrounded. The main waterhole is only 250 yards
long by about fifty wide, and was 4ft. 9in. deep in the centre.
As will be seen from this description, it receives the immediate
drainage of a large plain, and would probably be filled up by a
very slight fall of rain. I was there on the 10th October, and,
although no rain had fallen for some time, it was very nearly
full. This place is one of the last of the fresh waters so often
described by the blacks, several of which were erroneously
understood to be fresh water lakes&mdash;and although, as might
have been anticipated, the reality has fallen far short of the
expectations raised, still those I have seen are very useful
waters. Wonnomulla is undoubtedly the finest waterhole I had seen
up to that, time, whether east or west of Lake Torrens; and,
according to the blacks, there are still several similar
waterholes, upon this side of the country, which I have not yet
seen. Collabidnya, the northernmost of Hulke's supposed lakes, is
south-west of Wonnomulla; but I have not made out its exact
nature, as the accounts of it I have received differ from each
other.</p>
<p>When at Weeringelbunna, I could not get any distinct account
of the waters to the north of me, either from Oombatta or any of
his relations who accompanied him. They appeared not to know the
names of these waters, and to be unwilling to go to them,
However, I persuaded them to accompany me one day further;
accordingly, on the 11th, we went about ten miles N.E., over
plains, with rather indifferent feed, excepting about the small
hollows and water-courses, and struck a waterhole, upon a creek,
of about the same size as Wonnomulla, but deeper. I tried it at
one place and found the depth in the middle 7ft. 4in.; and in
several places, where I got into it, I found the water out of my
depth at two or three yards from the shore, the width being fifty
or sixty yards. I found afterwards that this waterhole was at the
head of the large creek visited by Messrs. Stuart and Forster.
Mr. Stuart has, however, not having had with him instruments for
taking the latitude, placed it about twenty-nine miles too far
north upon his plan. Having ascertained this point, I named the
creek Stuart's Creek, after its discoverer. The black would now
go no further north, but took me eastwards to a waterhole on a
creek, marked on the sketch Horseshoe Creek, at the foot of a
detached table-top hill, about sixteen miles west of my last
camp. On our way we passed several good waterholes, amongst which
was probably the one where Stuart and Forster camped, as we found
their tracks (which enabled me to identify the creek) running
west towards the creek. On our way we passed between some cliffs
and a detached table-top hill, showing white marl on the slopes,
and having particularly sharp rugged silicious rocks near the
top. After passing through this gap the feed improved very much,
and the country became more sandy. From the top of another
table-top, about a mile to the east of our camp, I saw a very
rugged range of detached hills running up north of the position
of Eyre's Mount Nor-west, to which I gave the name of the Hermit
Range, on account of their isolated character.</p>
<p>On moving northwards from the Horseshoe Camp, our blackfellow
deserted us, as generally happens when you attempt to take a
black beyond the boundary of his own immediate tribe. I followed
the creek, near the head of which the Horseshoe Camp is situated,
until, after a course of about twelve miles, it joined, Stuart's
Creek at a considerably lower point than where it was struck by
Stuart and Forster. A few miles above the junction, Warriner and
Pegler, whom I sent up Stuart's Creek, on the 15th October,
whilst I went down it, found a fine waterhole formed at its
western end by several small water-courses uniting together into
one channel, which continues for about a mile in length and then
again separates into smaller channels, the waters of which in
time of flood finally spread over a flooded plain, when the creek
appeared to lose itself until they join again into a channel a
short distance below the junction with the Horseshoe Creek. The
waterholes below this place were decidedly salt, although further
down the creek, after a succession of salt waterholes, we again
found some fresh waterholes. I had observed the same thing on a
smaller scale in the Horseshoe Creek. Fresh at its upper end, it
came into a country where the soil evidently contained salt, and
there the water was quite salt; but on going down the creek, the
character of the country somewhat improved, and we again found
fresh water in it. As will have been seen from this account, I
have traced Stuart's Creek, except at short intervals, from its
rise in a large plain down to its final termination in Lake
Gregory. The waterholes upon it cannot, however, be considered to
be strictly permanent, as there is not, so far as I have been
able to ascertain, a single spring in any one of them; but, like
Wonnomulla, they are readily filled by a heavy shower, and would,
I have no doubt, in most seasons retain water throughout the
summer. Some of the waters in Swinden's country, especially on
Smith's Creek and the Elizabeth, were, when first visited, fully
as deep, if not deeper than the waterholes in Stuart's Creek, and
yet most of them were, until the late rains came, quite dry; and
a similar fate would, I feel certain, befall those in Stuart's
Creek, should a season of unusual drought occur. On proceeding
down the Stuart, we found, near the junction of a creek from the
south-east, since named the "Margaret" by Major Warburton, a pool
of fresh water, and here I halted my party, whilst I went out
myself to examine the country before us, having, however,
previously traced down the Stuart into a large salt lake which I
named Lake Gregory. My first trip was made in company with Jones,
to the nearest hill of the Hermit Range, situated about twenty
miles west of my position. At about sixteen miles, we found a gum
creek with salt water, but no fresh water, although it might
probably be met with by going higher up the creek. On ascending
the hill, which stands up out of a plain, excepting on the
western side where high sandridges butted up against it, I could
distinctly trace the shores of Lake Gregory trending northwards,
but to the west and north-west, where I expected to see Lake
Torrens, nothing but an extensive plain met my view&mdash;not a
sign of a lake of any kind being visible. Immediately to the
north-north-west was also an extensive plain, of a somewhat
higher level than the western plain, presenting low bluffs at its
sides. To the south-east were the other isolated hills of the
Hermit Range, and beyond them a distant blue hill of the Flinders
Range, very probably Eyre's Mount Nor-West. To the south were
several small isolated salt lakes, and extensive plains covered
by low sandridges and scrub. According to the map of the "Recent
Explorations", the Hermit Hill should be about thirty miles west
of Eyre's tracks; but I found, subsequently, that a more recent
map, supplied to Major Warburton, gave the distance as only
fifteen miles. The height of the Hermit Hill is about 363 feet
above the ground at its base, and probably considerably more
above the western plain; I feel, therefore, confident, from my
view from this elevation, either that Lake Torrens does not
extend so far northwards as this latitude, viz.&mdash;29&deg;
37', or that, if it does, it must be reduced to a mere
inconsiderable channel, and might be readily crossed. I pointed
out this place to Major Warburton, explaining my reasons for my
belief, and offered to accompany him in an examination of it. As
this proposal did not appear to suit his plans, I requested him
to let one of my late party, Jones, accompany me, that I might
examine the country in this direction; and, if I found it
practicable, return to Adelaide by Eyre's tracks, on the eastern
side of the lake; and that, if not, I might, at any rate, have a
companion in the long ride to Port Augusta, <i>via</i> the
Elizabeth, Pernatty, and Beda. The Major, however, refused my
request, and I had no alternative but to leave to others to reap
the fruits of my own labors; and I have no doubt but that the
Major, with his accustomed energy, will solve this question, now
made easy by the late rains, before his return to town. My own
belief, from what I then and subsequently saw, is that Lake
Torrens turns up to Yarrawurta at its northern end, as at its
southern end it does to the Beda Arm, and that between Yarrawurta
and Lake Gregory there are only a few small isolated salt lakes
similar to Lake Phibbs, sufficient, however, to impress Eyre,
who, I believe, only saw this country from a distance, with the
idea that he saw the loom of a continuous lake.</p>
<p>On returning to my camp at the junction, I started next day,
with Pegler, northwards, and found a good crossing over the
Margaret at a place where a mass of reeds grow in the bed and up
the banks of the creek. There was salt water both above and below
these reeds. I think, however, that, when the drying up of the
salt water affords the opportunity of examining this place, a
fresh water spring will be found, as the reeds are of precisely
the same character as those which grow about St. Mary's Pool,
near Blanche Water, and on the banks of the Murray. After leaving
the Margaret, I examined the country in different directions,
which resulted in my discovering, at about ten miles north of my
camp, and about four and a-half miles west of the shores of Lake
Gregory, a hot spring of fresh water. This spring, marked on the
map as the Emerald Spring, from the verdure about it, is
singularly situated. On crossing a partially salt clay-pan, I saw
before me a round sand hill, about fifteen to twenty feet in
height, covered with reeds. On ascending the hill I found that
the reeds covered the rim of a bason, about six feet in height,
which enclosed an area of about forty yards in diameter, covered
with rushes. Throughout the whole of this area, water was
bubbling up amongst the rushes and running in several small
channels, which finally united in one stream, four feet in
breadth, towards a break in the rim of the bason, into a reedy
swamp below, about 150 yards diameter, out of which it flowed
between rushes and reeds, until, at about half a mile, the fresh
water was lost in a salt creek. The temperature of the water, at
the surface of the spring, was about 90&deg;, but on thrusting
the hand down about eighteen inches deep into the white sand,
through which the water bubbled up, it was so hot as to be
scarcely bearable. Unfortunately, I had no detached thermometer
with me, and therefore could not take the exact temperature. The
water was perfectly fresh to the taste, although it may very
likely be found to contain some small proportion of mineral
ingredients. It made very good tea; and our horses drank it
readily. I carefully measured the flow of water from this spring,
and made it about 175,000 gallons per diem; or enough to supply
every inhabitant of South Australia with a gallon and a-half of
fresh water every day. I gauged this spring again after the rain,
but found no sensible difference. During a second visit to the
Emerald Spring, a steady night's rain came on which flooded the
country and enabled me to bring up my whole party, so as to trace
the shores of Lake Gregory as far as I could before returning to
the Elizabeth. I found a branch of Lake Gregory running up to the
north-east, corresponding exactly with the position where Eyre
visited Lake Torrens at its most northerly point. This branch
opened into a large lake having no opposite shores visible from
the north to the north-east. A long arm, running south from the
western side of this lake, obliged me to double back upon my
course in order to round it, and I followed up its western side
until I got into a country to which the rain did not appear to
have extended, and was compelled, by want of water, to return. On
crossing the Margaret, the feed sensibly improves, and the
farther north I went the better it was, excepting in, the
immediate vicinity of the salt lakes. In the greater part of the
peninsula between the lakes, the feed was very good, the ground
being nearly covered with fresh green grass; and, at my most
northerly camp, the country consisted of level plains, between
low marly rises, running about north by east, both plains and
ridges being almost covered with a green mantle of tufted
grass.</p>
<p>Wallaby were not very abundant in the country traversed during
this trip, and we saw only a few tracks of kangaroo at one place
Of birds, we saw emu as far as we went. At Wonnomulla water-hens
began to be very numerous; we also saw there teal, whistling and
black duck; the same birds were numerous on Stuart's Creek, but
especially on the salt-water reach where Stuart's Creek runs into
Lake Gregory; at the salt water there were, of course, no
water-holes We here saw also the mountain duck and black swans.
The crested pigeon we first saw about Wonnomulla, and we found
them wherever there was fresh water. North of it, the brown and
bronze-winged pigeon were seen throughout the whole country.
North of the Margaret, we saw native-companions, cranes, wild
turkeys, and a small bird with vermilion head and breast,
somewhat resembling the fire-tail of the Murray. The ibis of the
Murray was also seen once near the Margaret. Below the Emerald
Spring I shot a singular bird, the body about the size of a
pigeon, with long legs and semi-webbed feet, the wings and body
white with black patches, the head long, and the beak very long
and narrow, the lower end of it for two to three inches being
curved upwards. This bird was walking about on the wet sand in
flocks of eight or ten together.</p>
<p>At Wonnomulla we found a number of black hawks, or perhaps
kites, which seem to cruize about together in flocks. These kites
we met with afterwards throughout our trip, and were surprized to
find on our return that they had made their appearance both at
the Elizabeth and at Thomson's Station, on the Flinders Range,
where they told me such a bird had never been seen before. We
also saw, near Wonnomulla and northwards, a white hawk with dark
slaty patches on the wings, which cruizes about in company like
the kites.</p>
<p>The headlands of the lower part of Stuart's Creek resemble
some of the cliffs of the Murray. They contain large deposits of
gypsum, and at places fossil shells, amongst them oyster shells
similar, I believe, to those of the Murray. Near the junction of
the Margaret I saw the stems of several fossil trees, in a nearly
horizontal position, standing out of the cliff. One of them was
quite twenty feet in length, nine inches in diameter at one end
and eighteen at the other. It had been bedded in limestone, the
wood itself being silicified.</p>
<p>When near the north-west angle of the southern portion of Lake
Gregory, on the 5th November, I met Major Warburton and his
party, and received the unwelcome intelligence that I had been
not only recalled, but superseded at the very moment when all my
plans appeared likely to be crowned with success. I, of course,
immediately gave up the command to the Major, and returned with
the party whom he sent back, under the command of Warriner, by
Stuart's tracks to the Elizabeth. I had intended to return by an
intermediate line of waters between my own route and Stuart and
Forster's, upon which the blacks had given me the names and
position of about fifteen waters; and from this line to have gone
occasionally to the eastward to look at Stuart's waters, so as to
be able to select the best line by which to move up my main camp
to a place where overhanging rocks near a waterhole, on Stuart's
Creek, offered facilities for constructing a comparatively cool
summer retreat, at only a day's journey from the permanent waters
of the Emerald Spring. At the Elizabeth, Mr. Gregory took charge
of the party, and I accepted his escort to this place. There was
plenty of water both at the Elizabeth and on the road down, so
that, if I had been recalled only, I should have had no
difficulty in bringing back the drays with the more valuable
portion of the stores.</p>
<p>Mr. Gregory will take the party down to Adelaide by land, but
I intend to return myself by the steamer which will sail on
Thursday, as I shall arrive in town, by that means, about the
same time as Mr. Gregory's party, and save myself the extra
fatigue of the overland journey.</p>
<p>I enclose a rough sketch from my map, to show the situation of
the places I have spoken about. The map itself I shall be able to
complete by the time of my return to Adelaide.</p>

have decided on your at once proceeding to supersede Mr. Babbage
in command of the Northern Exploring Expedition. The Hon, the

<p align="center"><a name="ch-07" id="ch-07"></a><i>Extract from
a letter from Major Warburton to Mr. Hamilton, dated Port
Augusta, 30th September, 1858.</i></p>
<p>I am in a hurry just at this moment, and cannot write to Mr.
Dutton, but I will mention what I think might, perhaps, be done
and leave it in your hands. The line of communication between
Port Augusta and Lake Campbell, Stuart's Creek, and all the
country there may be to the north and north-west of Lake Campbell
is very bad for stock, and it seems to me desirable to endeavor
to establish a better line through Parry's country. When I get on
Stuart's Creek, about lat. 29&deg; 30', long. 137&deg;, I shall
have Mount Nor-west nearly due east about 50 miles. Now I am sure
Burtt could find his way to the western side of Mount Nor-west
Range, and I might meet him from the eastward; thus there would,
if we could join, be an easy and unbroken line through good
country. I think it so desirable for the Colony that all the runs
should be connected, having no long piece of bad country to stop
the communication, that I shall certainly try what can be done
between Stuart's Creek and Mount Nor-west. I cannot say when I
shall be in sight of Mount Nor-west, but it may be about the 20th
October. If Burtt is sent out, he must get well on the western
side of the Range, and make a smoke signal on the most prominent
westerly point of the Range, keeping a good look-out westward
himself. There is water at Mount Nor-west, though it may not be
on the western edge of the Range.</p>
<hr>
<p align="right"><a name="ch-08" id="ch-08"></a>Police Station,
Angepina, 18th November, 1858.      </p>
<p>Sir&mdash;I have the honor to report that I arrived here with
my small party, consisting of Mr. A. Baker and Corporal Coward,
on the 17th November. Myself and party are all well, but my
horses are knocked up and leg-weary, as well they may be. I have,
however, neither lost any nor lamed any, which is something
considering the distance and the time it has been done in.</p>
<p>On the 7th inst, I forwarded you a short report; on the
morning of the 8th I sent all Mr. Babbage's men under charge of
Mr. Warriner back to the Elizabeth, and started myself in the
afternoon to look for a passage across Lake Torrens.</p>
<p>Since my last communication I have discovered another batch of
springs, exceeding I think in number and in the quantity of water
any two of the other batches.</p>
<p>I have had no difficulty in passing from Stuart's Creek to the
Northern Settlements, and we must now divest our minds of the
idea, so long impressed upon them by the mistaken and somewhat
mysterious reports of earlier travellers, regarding Lake Torrens.
The northern runs are not hemmed in by the lake, which we now
know to be divided into at least three separate lakes, for two of
which new names must be found. There was no lake visible where I
entered the northern district for fifteen miles, either on the
right hand or on the left.</p>
<p>As I hope to be in Adelaide by the <i>Marion</i> on the 28th
instant, I will now only briefly state in general terms what has
been done. I broke up Mr. Babbage's camp on the Elizabeth,
sending back to Adelaide such men and horses as I could.</p>
<p>I found Mr. Babbage himself, and sent his men to Mr. Gregory
to be conducted to Adelaide.</p>
<p>I have explored roughly up to lat. 28&deg; 20', long. 135&deg;
45', and found a considerable extent of pastoral country watered
(in addition to many excellent waterholes) by several collections
of springs, unequalled, I believe, in any similar extent of
country, and numbering, perhaps, not much short of 1,000 in
all.</p>
<p>I have practically connected the new country above alluded to
with that already occupied in the north, thus greatly
facilitating the spread of our flocks and herds, by saving the
difficulties and the distance presented on the route by Port
Augusta and the Elizabeth. I have travelled over about 1,000
miles in thirty-three days, exclusive of four days' halt, without
accident or injury to the health of any of my party, and without
losing or laming a horse.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I have not been able to save the loss entailed
by the nature of the equipment with which Mr. Babbage provided
himself, but then even Mr. Babbage himself could not have
effected this; and I shall be prepared to show that I have not
sacrificed more than Mr. Babbage would have been compelled to
abandon, whilst I have stopped the expenses incident to a summer
sojourn in the scrub.</p>
<p>Finally, Government did me the honor to leave me quite free as
to my movements. I hope I am not the man to betray the trust
reposed in me by those I serve. I therefore need scarcely say
that in deciding upon returning to Adelaide I am influenced alone
by what I consider the true interests of the Colony. Prolonging
the exploration at this season, whilst there is already as much
country discovered as can be stocked within a twelvemonth, would
be expensive, unnecessary, and hazardous to those engaged in it.
In the performance of a duty personal hazard is not to be
regarded; but as I am convinced that every disaster which happens
to an exploring party tends to quench the public spirit by which
exploration is kept alive, I think that every unnecessary risk
should be avoided; and I take a pleasure in keeping all who may
be with me not only in health and safety, but also interested in
the progress of the work in hand. Such ends are not easily
attained in a summer dep&ocirc;t, so I have not established one,
though I had plenty of places in which it might have been done
had it appeared desirable.</p>
<p>I have on all occasions received most ready and cheerful aid
from my two assistants, Mr. Baker and Corporal Coward; and I
shall do myself the pleasure to bring them under your favorable
notice when I arrive in Adelaide.</p>
<p align="center">            I have, &amp;c.,</p>
<p align="right">P. EGERTON WARBURTON,      <br>
Commissioner of Police.   </p>
<p>To the Hon. the Commissioner of Crown Lands. Commissioner of
Police.</p>
<hr>
<p>195-58.</p>
<p align="right"><a name="ch-09" id="ch-09"></a>Police
Commissioner's Office, Adelaide, December 3, 1858.      </p>
<p>Sir&mdash;Having returned to Adelaide, I now do myself the
honor to forward you a general report of my proceedings from the
date on which I started. Embarking on the 25th September on board
the steamer <i>Marion</i>, I was landed at Port Augusta on the
morning of the 29th, but not finding my horses ready there I
could not leave till the 30th, on which day I met near
Dep&ocirc;t Creek, Mr. Charles Gregory and Mr. Phibbs, returning
from Mr. Babbage's camp. My party now consisted of Messrs.
Gregory, Phibbs, and Arthur J. Baker; Sergeant-Major Hall and
Lance-Corporal Coward, of the Mounted Police; and we all reached
the Elizabeth Creek on the afternoon of the 3rd October. I do not
think that any portion of the country between Port Augusta and
the Elizabeth, westward of Lake Torrens, is fit for permanent
pastoral occupation As a whole it is sterile and stony; its
waters are scanty in number, temporary in their nature and
altogether untrustworthy.</p>
<p>Mr. Babbage had left his camp on the Elizabeth about a week
before I reached it, taking; with him four of his party and
eleven horses, and intending (so it was stated) to be absent
three months. Supposing that Mr. Babbage's object in going away
was to find a suitable place in which he could fix his camp for
the summer, I thought that he would be found either on, or in the
vicinity of, Lake Campbell; because, in the first place, Lake
Campbell had been represented to me as being permanent water; and
in the second place I know that it had occupied Mr. Babbage
ninety days to cart his stores from Beda to the Elizabeth, a
distance of sixty miles; and I consequently concluded that,
acting on the principles which he had publicly put forth as to
his mode of travelling, he would not attempt to form a summer
dep&ocirc;t at a much greater distance than fifty or sixty miles
from the Elizabeth, which would have occupied him up to the
middle of January in moving his stores. Influenced by these
considerations, I dispatched my second in command, Mr. Gregory,
and Corporal Coward, of the Mounted Police, with four or five
days' provisions on their saddles, to endeavor to overtake Mr.
Babbage and deliver the orders of Government to him. Mr. Gregory
started on the 5th October, tracked Mr. Babbage for about sixty
miles&mdash;found that Lake Campbell was dry, and that Mr.
Babbage had pushed on. He therefore returned to me. It would have
been both foolish and useless to have continued the pursuit. He
was not provided with provisions; his horses could not have stood
continuous forced marches over so rough a country; and it would
have been far easier for Mr. Babbage to have travelled thirty
miles a day than for Mr. Gregory to have tracked him twenty miles
a day. Those only who have done it know how difficult, how
tedious, and how trying to the eyes is the work of tracking
horses over rough stony country.</p>
<p>On the same day that Mr. Gregory left, I started three men and
four horses of Mr. Babbage's party back to
Adelaide&mdash;retaining the shepherd only to take care of the
sheep.</p>
<p>As it was supposed that in about a fortnight or three weeks
from the time of departure some one would be sent by Mr. Babbage
back to the Elizabeth to conduct his main camp to the summer
dep&ocirc;t, I determined to wait a fortnight on the Elizabeth in
the hope that his messenger would arrive. During this interval we
were employed in drying mutton, and shifting the camp to the
nearest waterhole, about three-quarters of a mile distant. I also
visited Smith's Waterhole and Wandandarree, neither of them worth
anything&mdash;the first being of a very temporary nature, the
second salt and stinking. You are already aware of the reasons
which prevented my selling the rations to Messrs. Forster and
McDonald, who were both obliged to take their sheep back from the
Elizabeth. On the 10th I put eighty-nine Government sheep into
Mr. Forster's flock, he having kindly undertaken to drive them
down. The shepherd and one horse were also sent back by this
opportunity. On the 14th one of Mr. Babbage's large 300-gallon
tanks was sent to Yeltacowie, about twenty miles on the homeward
road, filled with water, and covered over carefully; the cart
that carried it was also left there. On the 17th October I
started the Sergeant-Major of Mounted Police with such stores as
could be carried on one police-horse and, five expedition-horses
back to Adelaide, directing him to look to the Yeltacowie tank as
he passed.</p>
<p>Having waited, in vain, for some messenger from Mr. Babbage
till the 18th October, I started on that day for Stuart's Creek,
taking with me Mr. A. J. Baker, Corporal Coward, of the Mounted
Police, and three pack-horses. Previous to leaving, I instructed
Mr. Gregory that if any messenger came in from Mr. Babbage, he
was to accompany the said messenger back to Mr Babbage's camp
without delay, deliver the Government order recalling Mr.
Babbage, assume charge of the party, and take them all back, as
quickly as possible, to Adelaide&mdash;leaving at the Elizabeth a
letter, in a place agreed upon, and some water in a tank, for me.
Should no intelligence of Mr. Babbage be received, I directed Mr.
Gregory to hold on at the Elizabeth as long as the water would
allow him, and then (having filled a 300-gallon tank) to make the
best of his way, with his companion Mr. Phibbs, and the four last
horses, back to Adelaide.</p>
<p>Having provided for all probable contingencies as well as I
could, I started on a course a little west of north; the first
fourteen miles was over rough barren stony hills, when we came to
a dry fresh water swamp, with cane grass. Shortly after passing
this, one of the pack-horses was in the act of taking a bite of
grass, when a wallaby jumped out of the tuft and startled the
animal to such an extent, that, making a short sweep round us, he
went off at full gallop, over the roughest hills, to get back to
the Elizabeth; after much difficulty and hard riding, Mr. Baker
recovered the runaway, but both the horses were dead
beat&mdash;and, indeed, the pack-horse never recovered that one
gallop. We, travelled on over a country slightly improving till
five p.m., when we struck a wide and grassy creek (marked in the
map), and cut Mr. Stuart's tracks; water was found in a branch
creek on a shallow rocky basin, with a high cliff on the western
side. Without continuous rain this water would not last long; I
calculated that there might be enough for me, if I got back in
four weeks.</p>
<p>19th. Travelled in the same direction over a country which, if
watered (but it was not), would have been good, consisting of
sand-hills, stony plains, salt-bush flats and grass; at about
twenty-five miles we cut a large mulga and tea-tree creek, which
bore evident marks of heavy floods, and had some large but dry
water holes. I ran this creek down a long way, but could not find
any surface water; at one place I scratched a hole with my
fingers and got a little moisture, but I saw no prospect of
getting enough water for the horses, and we had as much as we
needed for ourselves in our canteens. I did not fall in with Mr.
Stuart's track anywhere this day, and I have no doubt his course
was eastward of mine.</p>
<p>20th. On the same course, for about seven miles, over stony
hills, grassy salt-bush flats, and sand-hills; saw smoke to the
north-west about three miles; went to it, but could not find the
natives; turned again into our right course, and soon saw a
second smoke, about two miles to the north-west; went to it and
caught a couple of gins, who, though much alarmed at first,
became very communicative under the influence of a pocket
looking-glass, and a mane comb, and led us to their husband's
camp, at a shallow clay-pan called Babnee Adnee amongst the
sand-hills; here we halted to rest our horses and lay in a supply
of damper. The Sturt pea was found in flower on these hills.</p>
<p>21st. Under the guidance of the natives, proceeded north-east
by north. At four miles we cut Mr. Stuart's tracks, running north
by west; crossed them, and at six miles further reached
Yarawurta. I traced this creek nearly up to its source&mdash;it
was the first gum creek since leaving the Elizabeth; its course
is first from east to west, then it bends to west and east. At
the bend is the first and best waterhole, about four feet deep;
further down there are others, but only eighteen inches or two
feet deep. This creek runs into Lake Torrens, and its lower
waterholes as salt. Though we had given the two natives who were
with us plenty to eat, and had not the slightest wish to detain
them, yet they preferred watching their opportunity, and then
running off as if for their lives, to walking quietly away with
my consent and some extra presents, as they might have done.</p>
<p>22nd. For the first ten miles north north-west over stony
hills and sand-ridges, then north by west, and at noon cut Mr.
Stuart's tracks, and found one of his camps in the sandhills;
crossing a rotten stony plain, I ascended an isolated hill, stony
for two-thirds of its height and pure sand at the top. From this
hill I first saw the thick line of gum trees on Stuart's Creek,
about ten miles distant; at two miles from this hill I cut, a
small creek, and finding a shallow puddle, camped at it. We had
travelled thirty miles this day.</p>
<p>23rd. I ran the creek down for a few miles, but found no more
water. Crossing an open, stony, rotten plain in a north-westerly
direction, cut Stuart's Creek, at, as I guess, about ten miles
below its source in the Turret Ranges.</p>
<p>The country begins to improve at about twenty to thirty miles
north of the Elizabeth; but the general character of the line
between it and Stuart's Creek, is stony hills and flats,
sprinkled with salt-bush, scrubby sand-hills, and rotten stony
plains&mdash;there are are no trees, excepting the stunted gums
or mulga and tea-tree scrub, in the creeks. I found nothing that
could be mistaken for permanent water. "The Yarawurta Creek was
the best water I saw; and from the manner in which the natives
spoke of it, I should infer that it was better than the other
waters they named&mdash;Milleyoora, Bumbeyadna, Boodnemunna, and
Moolkarra&mdash;which I have not seen.</p>
<p>At the exact spot where I cut Stuart's Creek, there was
neither water nor water-course, beyond a number of small dry
ditches intersecting a scrub gum-tree grassy flat, about half
a-mile wide; this flat appears to divide the upper from the lower
waters of the creek. I camped about, five miles above the flat,
where there were many narrow but good waterholes, not unlike
Blanchewater. The hills about the head of Stuart's Creek are
nearly all flat-topped, but they do not look as if they had been
originally so formed; on the contrary, they seemed as though they
had been once peaked or jagged hills, and had had all their tops
swept off at a given level.</p>
<p>24th. Halted. 25th. North-west by north for ten miles over
open stony country; north-north-west two miles and crossed the
sandy scrubby course of the Margaret Creek; turned due north for
a prominent looking single hill; at about three miles, recrossed
the Margaret at a tolerably good waterhole; continuing our
northerly course for a few miles, we crossed the Margaret again a
third time, and found an exceedingly fine waterhole. On nearing
the hill, we cut a large salt creek, running from the north-west;
ascended the hill, which, like most other isolated ones, has a
more important appearance than its actual height warrants; raised
a stone mound and a staff on the summit, and named it "Mount
Hamilton" (after George Hamilton, Esquire).</p>
<p>Taking a survey of the country around, from the top of Mount
Hamilton, we spied some bright green mounds rising out of a salt
pan at the eastern base of the hill; on examination, these proved
to be a large collection of fine fresh-water springs. I cannot
pretend to give an account of all these springs; I found, during
this expedition, more springs than I could either examine or
count. I shall, therefore, confine myself to the general
character of the whole, and particularize only one or two of the
most remarkable or best-watered ones. With few exceptions, these
springs rise out of salt pans at the foot of detached hills; some
from limestone mounds of various heights, crowned with reeds or
rushes; others from low rush mounds, in which the limestone is
scarcely visible; whilst others again, are collected in great
numbers on comparatively level ground, forming large swampy
masses of springs, which uniting, run out in one or more small
streams at different parts of the swamp. Some of the swamps are
reedy, some rushy, and others are covered with a tangled mass of
thick grass and moss. Some of the springs are running strongly,
some only slightly, and some require to be opened. None of the
water I tasted was undrinkable&mdash;some was as good as could
be, but that at several springs had a slightly brackish taste,
not like that of salt, but of lime and decayed vegetable matter.
It is on y a wonder, considering that none of these springs have
ever been used, and that many are choked up with several feet of
peaty, boggy, decayed vegetation, that most of the water is not
undrinkable.</p>
<p>I imagine that the limestone mounds are all formed by springs,
which, rising through limestone strata, became strongly
impregnated, and capable of petrifying, or at least covering with
a coat of lime, any foreign substance within their immediate
reach&mdash;such as the decayed roots and stems of the reeds;
and, in addition to this, as the overflowing water evaporates,
the lime, which it held in solution, being deposited, cements all
the outside substances to the general mass in process of
formation; the nucleus of a mound might thus be easily formed, to
which evaporation alone would give a gradual but constant
increase. I do not feel competent to convey clearly to the minds
of others the ideas upon these subjects which are clearly enough
impressed upon my own; but I wish to show that the mounds are not
the causes but the effects of springs bursting out.</p>
<p>There is reason to hope that, were all these springs kept open
and flowing, the action of the air alone would ventilate and
purify these waters, which now have a slightly unpleasant taste.
A rough description of the first spring visited in the batch,
under Mount Hamilton, may be of some interest. A limestone
conical mound, measuring 250 yards at the base and sixty at the
top, rises to a height of about forty feet out of a flat salt
pan; the cone is crowned with an evergreen wreath of reeds, eight
or nine feet high, which conceals a circular basin of beautiful
water, about fifty feet in diameter and from ten to twelve feet
deep; the overflowings of the spring run out over the face of the
rock in two strong streams. The day on which I visited these
springs was intensely hot, and it would be difficult to describe
the delightful appearance of the refreshing greenness of the
reeds and the charming coolness of the running water, when
contrasted with the glary mocking sparkle of the desolate salt
pan, out of which they spring.</p>
<p>I have described to you but one spring out of many; there is a
swamp in this batch of springs which must cover nearly three
acres, and the water issues out at its lower end in a strong
stream, more than sufficient for the wants of the largest
station, were it the only water procurable. The country all round
these springs is well-adapted to pastoral purposes; the "Margaret
Creek" (so named at the request of my companion, Mr. Baker)
passes through it. This creek has many good water-holes, and was
running when I saw it; eventually, it joins Stuart's Creek, a few
miles above its junction with the lake.</p>
<p>26th. There having been more springs than I could visit the
previous afternoon on foot, we circled round them this morning,
and then travelled north-north-west, over a very good country for
ten miles, when we were brought up by a salt creek; altering my
course to the west, I made at once for two detached hills, which
I had not intended to visit till I had seen what the country to
the north of them was like. Ten miles on a westerly course
brought me to a chain of ponds (called "Paisley Ponds", after the
Private Secretary to His Excellency the Governor-in-Chief). I
camped here. These ponds, four in number, are formed in a short
creek, which runs into a salt pan; but its mouth is dammed up by
polygonum bushes and the mud it has itself brought down, so that
the ponds must all be full before any water can flow away. One of
these ponds is about half-a-mile long, 100 yards wide, and, at
the time I went into it, about five feet deep; the others are
shorter and narrower, but better sheltered. Besides these ponds,
there are some fair water-holes at the head of the creek. I named
the two hills towards which I had been travelling the "Beresford
Hills" (after G. W. Beresford, Esquire), and taking a walk that
way in the evening, I saw another batch of springs lying between
them. The water is very good, and the supply sufficient for all
the stock on the largest run, without any reference to the
Paisley Ponds, which are only about two miles distant. The
country round about is all good.</p>
<p>27th. It rained all last night, and part of this morning, so I
halted this day to dry our clothes and provisions. We procured a
plentiful supply of ducks at this camp.</p>
<p>28th. I travelled only seventeen miles this day, in various
short tacks, but the general course was north-west, towards a
remarkable-looking jumble of little hills. These I found to be a
third batch of springs, exceeding the two first in number and
extent of country it covered, but, on the whole, not so active,
and differing from the former batches in rising partly out of a
small patch of low scrub. Most of these springs had small
limestone basins. Some of the water was very good, but much of it
appeared strongly impregnated with calcareous matter. I have no
doubt, these, springs would improve greatly with use. I drank the
water in pretty large quantities, and found no ill effects from
it. These are the "Strangways Springs" (after H. B. T.
Strangways, Esq., M.P.), and the country around them is fit for
pastoral purposes.</p>
<p>29th. The general aspect of the country led me a little to the
southward of west this day. The salt creek which I had struck on
the 26th was still close to me; I felt satisfied that there was
no permanent water immediately north of this creek, and I wished
to make myself tolerably certain that I had got to the north-west
end of the line of springs (nothing short of actually seeing the
salt creek fairly cross the line, and bend westward, could
satisfy me upon this point), I therefore crossed the creek two or
three times, to save bends, and ran up the valley of a fresh
water tributary for six or seven miles, passing through fine
feed. Leaving this tributary, I crossed some open stony salt-bush
country, and entered the valley of the salt creek. For six miles,
I ran this valley up through splendid feed, with small waterholes
in the polygonum, then it ended, and, on ascending a hill close
by, I found the country westward showing marked signs of
inferiority, and the salt creek continuing its course in the same
direction, now turned northward again, satisfied that I had run
out that patch of good country&mdash;I do not mean to assert that
there was no good country westward of me, but that I had not time
to go and look for it, nor any reasonable expectation of finding
it near at hand. As a general rule, I never follow a bad country
when, there is a chance of getting on to a better; but, in
turning northward at this place, instead of running a fresh line
back through the good country I had just traversed, I was
influenced by a desire of extending our knowledge of the country
in that direction. I found that the general character of the
country south of the salt creek, to which I have so often
referred, was stony and good, whilst that to the north appeared
to be sandhills and scrub. I wished to know how far north this
sand-belt extended&mdash;whether it was of a similar desolate
character to the sand-belt I had recently crossed near our
western frontier, and what there was beyond it. I dare say I have
not seen all the waters and other advantages possessed by the
good country I discovered, but I do not consider this a matter of
much importance&mdash;I have seen enough to lead to the
occupation of that country, and those who settle upon it will
have more time to find out all its advantages; whereas, by going
north, I hope I have gained information for the public benefit
which would not have been sought for by private persons, or, if
sought, and found valuable, would have been turned to private
advantage. Crossing, therefore, the salt creek once more with
some difficulty, for there are many quicksands in it, I took a
N.N.W. course. The sand ridges run about south-west and
north-east&mdash;they are not close one to another, but are
separated by good-sized valleys, which widen as they run
eastward; the sand ridges also fall in height to the
eastward&mdash;they are exceedingly well grassed, so are the
intervening valleys, in which there are plenty of shallow
clay-pans. I should consider this sand-hill country admirably
suited for winter runs&mdash;warmth, shelter, dryness under foot,
plenty of food, and water, are all there. Where I crossed these
sandhills they were about seventeen miles in depth, but had I
taken a north line, thirty miles eastward of the one I did take,
I should probably have had no sandhills at all. Continuing our
course, we camped at a small water hole, in a valley with good
feed. Total distance this day, about 45 miles.</p>
<p>30th. Started north; four miles over low sand-hills and
well-grassed hollows. Obtained a good view of a distant range,
bearing north-west by north. We had seen the outline of the tops
of these hills the day before; but I now altered my course direct
to the most prominent part of the range. At 5 miles, north-west
by north, I cut a large gum creek named "The Douglas" (after
Bloomfield Douglas, Esq., R.N.) I here separated from my
companions, being most anxious to learn something of the nature
of this creek, and yet not to lose time nor curtail my distance
northwards, I ran down "The Douglas" for several miles, found a
few water holes, but no permanent supply. The gum trees on this
creek are large and useful; there are also many large acacias on
the banks. Having examined the creek eastward, I turned to the
north-west to make for the hills, named "The Davenport Range"
(after the Hon. S. Davenport, M.L.C.) I had directed my
companions to precede me, and to camp under "Mount Margaret", the
highest and most conspicuous point in the range. Unfortunately
they made a mistake, so that when I reached the spot appointed,
after being twelve hours in the saddle, and my horse knocked up,
I was obliged to camp alone without food or water. This prevented
my making any examination of the range; but I consider it to be
one of the most interesting and picturesque places I have seen in
the Colony. This range, at its highest point, is probably 1,000
feet high, and is chiefly composed of quartz. I at first thought
that the huge blocks, which had fallen down from the
perpendicular cliffs, were all white marble; but I have since had
reason to believe I was mistaken. There may, perhaps, be water
amongst the hills, and, though I do not feel myself to be the
most competent judge in such matters, I should imagine that no
more likely place for gold has yet been found in the Colony.
Several gum creeks run eastward from the Davenport Range; but,
near their sources, at least, their beds are shingly and sandy,
and do not retain surface water. It seems probable, not only that
water would be procurable in these creeks at a very moderate
depth, but that, like Stuart's Creek, they may have large water
holes at their mouths.</p>
<p>31st. Proceeded in search of my missing comrades; found them,
without water, in another part of the range, about ten miles
short of our appointed place of meeting; returned, without delay,
to one of the lower water holes in the Douglas, as we all needed
water. Had it not been that an important part of my duty (the
recall of Mr. Babbage,) was still unperformed, I should now have
gone back again to the Davenport Range; but having this duty
before me, and not knowing how long it might take to perform it,
I did not feel at liberty to widen the distance between us too
much. On my return trip, to within 20 miles of Stuart's Creek, I
varied my line, had good feed and plenty of water all the way. I
discovered several new springs; one small lot, about five miles
north-west of Mount Hamilton, which I called "Coward's Springs"
(in token of my approval of the zeal and intelligence with which
Corporal Coward had assisted me), being particularly fine in
respect to the body and purity of the water flowing from them. I
greatly extended my knowledge of the Margaret Creek, and
confirmed my first favorable opinion of the capabilities of this
country for carrying stock.</p>
<p>4th November.&mdash;In the afternoon of this day, when within
twenty miles of Stuart's Creek, I cut Mr. Babbage's track running
north-east towards the Salt Lake. I immediately followed it up,
found his first camp, then left the tracks, crossed Stuart's
Creek in order to save a bend, found the Salt Lake nearer than I
had expected, and that I had overshot my mark. Camped near the
mouth of Stuart's Creek, where there are very fine-looking water
holes in which I saw many pelicans and wild duck. I call these
holes good-looking because I am afraid they are likely to turn
salt, although the greater part of them are now perfectly
drinkable.</p>
<p>5th November,&mdash;Ascended Stuart's Creek a few miles,
crossed and cut Mr. Babbage's tracks again, ran then up over bad
country till they got me embayed between two arms of the Salt
Lake; found that Mr. Babbage had gone all round one arm in order
to get out&mdash;left his tracks and pushed the horses across the
Lake at a place where there were two or three small islands for
resting places. Having crossed the Lake, and thus saved many
miles round, I again struck the tracks, and after running them up
a few hours fell upon Mr. Babbage and his party. Accompanied Mr.
Babbage to his camp.</p>
<p>6th November.&mdash;Took charge of the party and conducted it
to Stuart's Creek.</p>
<p>7th. Sunday.&mdash;Halted.</p>
<p>8th. Started the exploring party, consisting of four men
(exclusive of Mr. Babbage), and twelve horses for the Elizabeth,
under charge of Mr. Warriner, informing him that I expected him
to go straight, and reach the Elizabeth in four days. I have
since learned that the party took six days, and were two days
without water. How this was managed I do not know.</p>
<p>In the afternoon of the 8th, started with Mr. Baker, Corporal
Coward, and two pack horses, to get across Lake Torrens; crossed
Stuart's Creek and travelled eight miles north-east, over a good
country, open plains, slaty hills and thin scrub; crossed several
small Water courses and camped near one.</p>
<p>9th. Two miles of sandy scrub in a north-easterly direction.
East-north-east eight miles, cut a fine running creek; good
water-holes with fish about three inches long; the water slightly
brackish, but quite drinkable; creek running from south to north.
I have named this creek "Gregory's Creek", after my late
companion, Mr. Charles Gregory. Two miles further,
east-north-east, cut another narrow fresh water creek with sandy
bottom. Four miles on came upon a broad salt water course at the
foot of the hills to which I had been steering. Ascended a hill,
and set up a pile of stones. Round this hill I found by far the
finest batch of springs yet discovered. The extent of ground they
covered, and the quantity of water they gave out, were enormous.
I have called these the "Finniss Springs", after the Honorable B.
T. Finniss. I. bathed in one reservoir, which had a stream (from
other springs) running into it, and a stronger stream running out
of it; the water was about 150 feet long, 100 feet wide, and
twenty feet deep, perfectly fresh; many duck upon it; bullrushes
six feet high in the water; which was surrounded by a thick belt
of green reeds. I fathomed this hole, therefore I refer to it
particularly; but it was only one hole out of many. I found small
fish here, and in some places the reeds were twelve to fourteen
feet high; and too thick to be penetrated. Altogether it is a
wonderful collection of water, and would require a very
lengthened description to do it justice. I here saw hundreds of
springs, which I had not time to examine closely.</p>
<p>10th. North-east one and a-half mile, to top of high salt-bush
table land; east-north-east, three miles, crossing table land,
descended into a splendid valley (at the time) well watered. This
valley was about two and a-half miles wide, and I should think
from fifteen to twenty miles long, perhaps more, as I could not
see where it terminated to the south-eastward. Ascending a lower
table land, I travelled on over a fair country, and camped near a
water-hole, where the feed was very good; total distance, about
thirty-one miles; no Lake Torrens visible.</p>
<p>I was now quite satisfied that I had accomplished my object,
that, there was no Lake Torrens; that the communication between
Stuart's Creek and the north country was open over clear high
table land; I, therefore, decided upon turning southward next
day.</p>
<p>11th. Proceeding five miles on a south-easterly course, I came
upon what had apparently been the bed of a lake in former times,
bounded on the western side by broken cliffs, and on the eastern
by a long range of high land. Keeping a little more to the
southward to avoid the low ground, I passed over six miles of
open salt-bush country, stony and rotten, but still all good. Two
miles further on I cut some fresh horse-tracks running
south-west.</p>
<p>As I have now got into a country traversed by Mr. Parry and
others, it is not necessary to enter into further details beyond
saying, that on the 12th I cut some very good water holes which,
as I could not find any tracks, though I searched for them
carefully on foot, I conclude had not before been visited. Two
small isolated hills bear south by west one mile, and a single
low flat-topped hill south-east by south one-and-a-half mile from
this water. On Monday, the 15th November, we reached an
outstation belonging to Mr. Thomas Gill, near Fortress Hill.</p>
<p>I will now conclude with a few general remarks.</p>
<p>Most of the country I have visited seems admirably adapted for
pastoral occupation. It is one that would be greatly improved by
being stocked; the surface would become firmer, and the thin
coating of small stones would be just sufficient to prevent rapid
evaporation, but not to interfere with the growth of grass which
would soon spring up under sheep. There is no scrub; I saw very
few wild dogs, no kangaroos, and no natives. Sheep might be run
in flocks of several thousand, and I believe, that for every
single sheep the country could carry the first year, three might
be put upon it the third season. The ground is high, would be dry
underfoot when made firmer by the treading of sheep, and it is
clean for the wool. A little rain would leave plenty of temporary
surface water. The water holes are generally good, and would last
all the year if that country were blessed with periodical rain;
but it is doubtful whether it is so or not. Then there is an
abundant and sure supply of water from the springs. The country
generally is very deficient in useful timber, but the reeds and
mud would make good huts.</p>
<p>I have made but a hurried trip it is true, yet I believe I
have acted for the best. Mr. Babbage and all his party were
afflicted with scurvy when I met them; had I remained out all the
summer, my party would, without doubt, have suffered in a similar
manner, and most probably we should have been quite unfit for
work when the summer was over.</p>
<p>I have made but a hasty and partial examination of the
country; still, I have discovered so much fresh water as to make
the occupation of that country easy, and that will lead to all
other desirable knowledge without public expense. To point out
the different localities suitable for pastoral occupation seems
as much as was needful for me to do; the experience and
intelligence of the settlers themselves will do the rest.</p>
<p>I beg to recommend to your favorable notice Mr. Arthur J.
Baker and Corporal Coward; their cheerful and active aid enabled
me to carry out with ease everything that my horses and
provisions were able to take me through.</p>
<p>It has been my earnest desire to do this duty on which I was
sent, faithfully&mdash;to the best of my ability&mdash;looking as
carefully as I could to the end you had in view: viz. the real
interests of the Colony. How far I may be considered to have been
successful, time will show; but I feel called upon, in closing my
report, to make my humble and hearty acknowledgment to Almighty
God for giving and guiding me to that without which no man can
live, water. The smallest accident, an apparently trifling error,
or a comparatively short period of privation, may jeopardize
human life in the bush. Truth and thankfulness alike require me
to acknowledge that I have not travelled thus far in safety and
in health by my own forethought, prudence, or skill, but by the
merciful guidance and protection, of Providence.</p>

<hr>
<p align="right"><a name="ch-10" id="ch-10"></a>Elizabeth Camp,
12th September, 1858.      </p>
<p>Sir&mdash;I have the honor to inform you that, on the 6th
instant, Mr. Babbage and Warriner not having returned, I started
in search of them with Mr. Jones and B. Bowman (leaving overseer
Phibbs in charge of the camp), equipped with six horses, and
twenty-four days' provision. I proceeded to Oakden's Hills, and
arrived there on the 7th, and found Mr. Babbage's camp; on the
8th, I tracked him on a south course, about six miles, when we
came to the western shore of a dry salt lagoon, extending about
twelve miles east; the tracks then trended two miles west, when
we struck another salt lagoon, and, passing down the southern
shore about five miles, came on one of his camps where he had
remained for the night, without water, and then continued in a
westerly direction to the end of the lagoon, which is about
twelve miles in length, when we found that he had watered his
horses at a clay-pan, which was now dry. The tracks then trended
N.W.; and, following them about four miles on this course, we
camped for the night in the scrub.</p>
<p>September 8th.&mdash;Our horses having been without water
since leaving the Elizabeth, with the exception of about half a
gallon each at Oakden's Hill, on the 7th; and, as there was no
probability of our obtaining any nearer than the Elizabeth, a
distance of more than forty miles, I determined to proceed back
without delay, as it would be impossible for us to travel as far
as he had done with the advantage of water, where we found it
dried up. I should have been enabled to have proceeded another
day on the tracks, but the water-bottles of Mr. Babbage's proved
to be of such porous leather, that the water we had provided for
the horses all leaked out; consequently, I had only our own two
six-gallon bottles to depend upon, and none to spare for the
horses.</p>
<p>September 9th&mdash;Steering N.E. by N. for seven miles, we
came on Mr. Babbage's track proceeding to Oakden's Hill, which
was then distant about four miles; all these tracks appear to be,
at least, a month old; and, continuing our course, we arrived at
the Elizabeth Camp on the 10th instant&mdash;our horses having
had only half a gallon of water each during the last five
days.</p>
<p>It is now my intention to proceed to the southern extremity of
Pernatty Lagoon, and examine the neck of land between it and the
large lagoon to the S.E. of Oakden's Hill; and, failing to find
traces in that locality, will prove satisfactorily that he must
have gone down the shore of Great Salt Lake; but as, perhaps, he
may have tried to strike across the country from the southern
shore of the Great Salt Lake to Lake Dutton, I shall proceed in
that direction and examine the country as far to the westward as
practicable. Should, however, any rain fall, I shall proceed to
the last tracks seen going N.W. to the shore of the Great Salt
Lake, as far as may lay in my power; at present this is
impossible, as I should have to travel more than forty miles
without water, before I could make further search than already
done.</p>
<p>Mr. Harris may probably be able to give you some information
as to the practicability of sending a party down the Gawler
Range, to Mr. Hack's furthest north, on the eastern shore of Lake
Gairdner, and examine the country for tracks to the north of, as
it may be probable that Mr. Babbage has endeavored to push
through, to that point. I should, however, impress on any one
starting from there, the impossibility of obtaining water near
Oakden's Hills, as the whole of the country is of such a sandy
nature that, even should light showers fall, it will be
immediately dried up.</p>
<p>The water seems to stand well, at present, at the Elizabeth
Creek; but I still fear that it will not last through the
season.</p>
<p>Trusting that these arrangements will meet with your
approval.</p>

<hr>
<p align="right"><a name="ch-11" id="ch-11"></a>Elizabeth Camp,
25th September, 1858.      </p>
<p>Sir&mdash;Since writing you on the 12th September, I have the
honor to acquaint you that, after attempting to find traces of
Mr. Babbage and Warriner, to the south of Pernatty Lagoon, from
which I was obliged to return, there not being any water in that
locality&mdash;On the 18th instant I started with ninety gallons
of water on the dray, and proceeded fifteen miles down Lake
Windabout; and, the next day Mr. Phibbs and Mr. Jones brought on
the saddle and pack-horses; when I turned adrift the cart horses
to let them travel back to the camp during the night, as we could
not spare any water for them. The next day I proceeded about
seventeen miles on towards Great Salt Lake, with overseer Phibbs,
Jones, and Pegler; and camped for the night on a large dry
lagoon, seven miles N.W. of Oakden's Hills. On the 19th, having
sent back Phibbs and Pegler with the spare horses, I watered our
own two, leaving five gallons of water to fall back on, and
proceeded with Mr. Jones to the southern shore of Great Salt
Lake; and, falling in with Mr. Babbage's tracks, followed them on
about twenty miles further (than I had done on a former
occasion), to the western shore of the great lake; but not
finding any water was obliged to return the next day, and arrived
at the Elizabeth Camp on the 23rd, where I found Mr. Babbage had
returned two days before, having been down to Mount Remarkable;
and, I am sorry to add, that there seems to have been some gross
neglect on Mr. Harris's part, as the man I sent down with him,
for the purpose of returning either with answers to my letters or
tidings of Mr. Babbage, was taken on to Mount Remarkable, instead
of returning immediately to inform me of Mr. Babbage's safe
return to the settlement; and, as I understand "from Mr. Babbage,
would have been taken on to Adelaide, had he not overtaken Mr.
Harris, and brought the man back with him; and, at the same time,
Mr. Harris, when at Thompson's station, was fully aware of Mr.
Babbage's return.</p>
<p>These delays have, consequently, precluded my examining the
country to the northward for permanent water to remove the stores
and equipment to, for the dry season; but, as Mr. Babbage has
obtained a sketch of the country from Mr. Stuart, showing that
there are permanent pools of water about ninety miles north of
the Elizabeth, he will be enabled to remove his camp to it,
before the dry season sets in, which will require him to devote
the whole of his energies to. Without making further exploration,
of any consequence, this year, it becomes unnecessary for me to
remain, as I could not so far extend my leave of absence; and Mr.
Babbage is also of opinion that I had better return as, unless I
could remain with him for several months, it would be of no use,
as there is, at least, one hundred miles to travel over of known
country before we could commence operations on the unexplored
territory; and I might then not be able to return, as there
would, by that time, probably be no water for me to fall back
on.</p>
<p>Mr. Phibbs also accompanies me, as his leave of absence from
the New South Wales Government is likewise limited.</p>

Police Station, 15th November, 1858.      </p>
<p>Sir&mdash;I have the honor to inform you that I returned last
night from the westward.</p>
<p>I enclose a copy of my journal, and a rough sketch of my
route.</p>
<p>When at my furthest western point, had I had any hopes of
coming across Major Warburton's party I would have pushed another
day's stage to the west; but as my instructions stated that
Stuart's Creek was fifty miles east of Mount Nor-west, I thought
I might perhaps be too far north and west for it. I therefore
turned southwards (as shown in the plan) and not seeing any
tracks in any direction, I can only suppose that the rain, which
enabled me to get so far west, either raised a barrier in the
shape of a large lagoon or Jake between me and Stuart's Creek, or
else that Major Warburton had taken advantage of it and pushed on
to the interior. I never myself saw any such lake, nor any creek
such as I should imagine Stuart's Creek to be; nor do I believe
that any continuous lake exists to the west of Mount Nor-west, as
is commonly supposed. In any case I should soon have had to
return, as I had used all the spare horse-shoes brought, and the
horses were then getting very footsore; and besides, the
rainwater was drying up fast.</p>
<p>On my return to the station I found Police-trooper Field with
despatches for the Commissioner. As there are no hopes of their
reaching him by this direction (the time given for his being in
the neighborhood of Mount Nor-west, 20th October, being long
since passed), I have directed Police-trooper Field to return
with them to Adelaide by way of Thompson's Station, on the chance
of their reaching the Commissioner by that direction.</p>

<p><small>October 18th.&mdash;Left Angepina 11 a.m., with

travelled, twenty-one miles.</small></p>
<p><small>October 19th.&mdash;From Putaba to Mr. Gilles' station
(Cookoopana), twenty miles.</small></p>
<p><small>October 20th.&mdash;Left Cookoopana at 9 a.m. Went to
Eyre's Dep&ocirc;t. About four miles found it almost dry, and
very brackish. The horses would not touch it. Scraped a hole in
the sand and got some brackish water, with which we filled our
canteens. Arrived at Termination Hill about an hour before
sundown. Found the waterhole, discovered some short time since by
Mr. Parry, dry. Camped on a creek at Termination Hill without
water. Distance about thirty-five miles.</small></p>

<b>MAP 3. Rough Sketch Showing the track taken by CORPORAL
BURTT</b><br></p>
<p><small>October 21st.&mdash;Started soon after sunrise (the
horses wandering a good deal in the night for water). Steered a
little west of north in hopes of finding some water discovered by
Messrs. Bunn and Weatherstone about eighteen months since, and
supposed to be permanent. Travelled about fifteen miles across
the plain; crossed two gum creeks, and followed up another small
one running north over a jumble of hills, some of them of
considerable elevation, but found no water. From here I turned to
the east, in order to make Shamrock Pool, described by Mr. Parry,
as I had not his chart, and could not tell the position of St.
Frances's Ponds, and indeed had very little hopes of finding
water there. Camped at dark in a creek without water. Distance
travelled, about forty-five miles.</small></p>
<p><small>October 22nd.&mdash;We had great difficulty last night
to keep the horses from straying in search of water, and had at
last to tie them up. Started at peep of day this morning, and
after riding about six miles in a south-east direction, came in
sight of Mount Delusion, and arrived at Shamrock Pool about 1
p.m., the horses nearly done up for want of water. The country
between Mount Delusion and Shamrock Pool is miserable enough.
Distance about twenty-five miles.</small></p>
<p><small>October 23rd.&mdash;The horses are in no humour to
leave the waterhole to-day, and I will give them two days' spell
before starting out again. The weather hitherto has been very
hot, and had it not been that the nights were cool, the horses
would scarcely have reached Shamrock Pool. As it is, they must
have gone over a hundred miles without water.</small></p>
<p><small>October 24th.&mdash;I believe Shamrock Pool will soon
be dry. It has none of the indications of permanent water. We
took the dimensions of it to-day&mdash;60 feet long, 20 feet
wide, and 15 inches deep in the middle, it is seven feet from the
top of the bank, on a level with the plain, to the bottom of the
waterhole.</small></p>
<p><small>October 25th.&mdash;Started before daybreak, and
steered west for Mount Nor-west. Searched through the hills and,
creeks between Shamrock Pool and the Mount for water, but found
none. Arrived at the Mount about 5 p.m.; ascended it, and had a
good look-out to westward. There is a range bearing some 10&deg;
north of west, and distant about twenty-five miles. Camped at the
foot of the Mount without water. This day has been fearfully hot,
and I must make back to Shamrock Pool for water. Distance about
fifty miles.</small></p>
<p><small>October 26th.&mdash;Started from Mount Nor west soon
after daybreak, and arrived at Shamrock Pool about 2 p.m.
Distance, about thirty miles. The horses and ourselves very much
distressed for water. Found the water had gone down more than two
inches since we left. Towards sundown and in the night we had a
good deal of rain.</small></p>
<p><small>October 27th.&mdash;We were obliged to shift our camp
this evening on to some sandhills about 300 yards from Shamrock
Pool, on account of the rain.</small></p>
<p><small>October 28th,&mdash;Attempted to cross the lagoon
towards Mount Delusion, but myself and one horse had a narrow
escape from being bogged. Camped for the night on a small creek
in the lagoon.</small></p>
<p><small>October 29th.&mdash;Too boggy to travel.</small></p>
<p><small>October 30th.&mdash;Succeeded in crossing the lagoon,
and went about five miles beyond Mount Delusion, and camped at a
clay-pan. Distance twenty miles.</small></p>
<p><small>October 31st.&mdash;Crossed Mount Nor-west range, and
searched about on the western side for water, but found none.
Camped on the plain without water. Distance thirty-five
miles.</small></p>
<p><small>November 1st.&mdash;Re-crossed the range, found a very
little rain water on the eastern side of it, and got to Decoy
Hill. It being dark we camped there. Distance thirty
miles.</small></p>
<p><small>November 2nd.&mdash;Left Decoy Hill and went to St.
Frances's Ponds, which are much lower than when Mr. Parry was
here, and do not appear to be permanent. Went on to River's
Water. I think there will be some water there all this summer,
and in most ordinary seasons, It is the most likely place for
permanent water I have seen. Followed down River's Crook,
ascended Mount Attraction, and arrived at St. Stephen's Pond a
little before sundown. This water also is much lower than when
Parry was here, and so salt we could not drink it. It will most
likely be all gone in a month. Found some rainwater about a
quarter of a mile south of it, and camped. Distance about
twenty-five miles.</small></p>
<p><small>November 3rd.&mdash;Left Mount Attraction about 10 a.m.
(the horses having strayed some distance), and steered towards a
distant range bearing about south-west. The plain west of the
Mount is very low. About fifteen miles crossed a creek with a
great deal of very salt water in it, running north. Camped for
the night at some rain water in a watercourse on the plain.
Distance about twenty-five miles.</small></p>
<p><small>November 4th.&mdash;Crossed two or three small gum
creeks and watercourses on the plain, some of them with rainwater
in them. Ascended Trooper's Hill and built a small pile of
stones; made a smoke signal, and wrote directions to the nearest
permanent water&mdash;River's Water&mdash;thirty-five miles to
the north of east. The view to the west is very extensive, but
not very encouraging, consisting of a plain with several
flat-topped hills on it. There is one rather higher than the rest
about fifteen miles distant, bearing some 10&deg; north of west,
to which I will go. Camped for the night at a olaypan about two
miles from Trooper's Hill. Distance to-day, about twenty
miles.</small></p>
<p><small>November 5th.&mdash;Started about 7 a.m. At four miles
distance came across a large waterhole about a quarter of a mile
long, and in some places twenty feet wide. About four miles
further came across another about the same size. I think these
holes will contain water most of the summer, but do not consider
them permanent. There are very likely others of the same
description about. Ascended a flat-topped hill about fifteen
miles distant from Trooper's Hill. The view from north-east to
south-west is extensive, but no signs of a lake or of any more
ranges. There are some more table-topped hills on the horizon,
for one of which, bearing about 10&deg; south of west, I will
steer. About five miles further we crossed a creek containing
many channels full of water, and very swampy ground. There were a
few stunted gum trees about, but I do not think the water
permanent. Crossed the creek and camped in same sandhills about a
mile distant. We have seen a great deal of rain water to-day, and
most of the country travelled over is very stony and scanty of
vegetation. Distance about twenty miles.</small></p>
<p><small>November 6th.&mdash;Started about 7 a.m. Crossed a
number of sandhills with plenty of rain water in them, and in one
or two of the small creeks there were some rushes and tea-tree.
Could not tell if the water was permanent, there being so much of
it about&mdash;but don't think it is. Arrived at the table-topped
hill about 2 p.m., which I will call Mole's Hill. I shall not go
any further west, but strike away to the south-east, as I imagine
Major Warburton's party must be more in that direction. The view
from Mole's Hill is very extensive; to the west and north-west it
extends for thirty miles, and consists of plain, with plenty of
stones and very little vegetation. There are a few table-topped
hills in the distance. About fifteen miles north there seems to
be a creek running east and west, with either small gum trees or
bushes in it. There are no signs of a lake in any direction. I
must now be about seventy miles to the west of Mount Nor-west,
and yet have not seen anything of Stuart's Creek (said to be
fifty miles north of the Mount) nor any horse-tracks. Camped on
the plain at some rain water. Distance about twenty-five
miles.</small></p>
<p><small>November 7th.&mdash;Steered to-day south-east and
south, over a succession of sandridges with plenty of rain water.
Camped near rather an elevated sandhill. No signs of a lake in
any direction. Distance about twenty-five miles.</small></p>
<p><small>November 8th.&mdash;Travelled to-day to the east about
twenty miles, over sandhills. Plenty of rain water. Camped on a
low table-land to the south-west of Trooper's Hill.</small></p>
<p><small>November 9th.&mdash;Not seeing any tracks of the
Major's party I will steer more south, and go back by the south
of Mount Nor-west. Crossed a watercourse with plenty of rainwater
in it&mdash;a finer waterhole than Shamrock Pool, damped at the
termination of a creek on the plain, south-west from Mount
Nor-west. Distance about twenty miles.</small></p>
<p><small>November 10th.&mdash;Travelled round the south side of
the Mount. Saw a very little rain water in a gum creek south of
the Mount. Watered the horses and camped about two miles
south-east of the Mount. Distance about twenty miles.</small></p>
<p><small>November 11th.&mdash;Crossed a blackfellow's track this
morning about three miles from Mount Nor-west, about two days
old, the only fresh track seen. Saw very little rain water
to-day. Camped at a large waterhole with gum trees about five
miles west of Shamrock Pool. Distance twenty miles.</small></p>
<p><small>November 12th.&mdash;Made across to Mr. Parry's St.
A'Becket's Pond. Found it almost dry. Plenty of old cattle tracks
and pads. Camped in some sandhills between there and Mount
Coffin. Distance twenty miles.</small></p>
<p><small>November 13th.&mdash;Saw no rain water at all to-day;
it is all dried up. Arrived at Messrs. Bunn and Weatherstone's
station about 3 p.m. Distance about twenty-five
miles.</small></p>
<p><small>November 14th.&mdash;From Bunn &amp; Weatherstone's to
Angepina. Distance, twenty-five miles; having travelled 601 miles
since we left.</small></p>
<p><small>The hill I have taken as Mount Nor-west is not the same
as that mentioned by Mr. Parry, which is in the range to the
north of it.</small></p>
<p><small>The country about Trooper's Hill is the best we have
seen; and the sandhills to the west of it have also plenty of
grass, &amp;c. There is also some good country to the north and
east of Mount Nor-west.</small></p>
