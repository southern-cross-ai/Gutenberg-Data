  <h2><a name="chap01"
     id="chap01">I. &mdash; PROLOGUE: SANDERS, C.M.G.</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Weekly Tale-Teller</i>, 10 Oct 1914</h3>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">YOU will never know from the perusal of the Blue Book the
  true inwardness of the happenings in the Ochori country in the spring of the
  year of Wish. Nor all the facts associated with the disappearance of the Rt.
  Hon. Joseph Blowter, Secretary of State for the Colonies.</p>

  <p>We know (though this is not in the Blue Books) that Bosambo called
  together all his petty chiefs and his headmen, from one end of the country to
  the other, and assembled them squatting expectantly at the foot of the little
  hillock, where sat Bosambo in his robes of office (unauthorized but no less
  magnificent), their upturned faces charged with pride and confidence,
  eloquent of the hold this sometime Liberian convict had upon the wayward and
  fearful folk of the Ochori.</p>

  <p>Now no man may call a palaver of all small chiefs unless he notifies the
  government of his intention, for the government is jealous of self-appointed
  parliaments, for when men meet together in public conference, however
  innocent may be its first cause, talk invariably drifts to war, just as when
  they assemble and talk in private it drifts womanward.</p>

  <p>And since a million and odd square miles of territory may only be governed
  by a handful of ragged soldiers so long as there is no concerted action
  against authority, extemporized and spontaneous palavers are severely
  discouraged.</p>

  <p>But Bosambo was too cheery and optimistic a man to doubt that his action
  would incur the censorship of his lord, and, moreover, he was so filled with
  his own high plans and so warm and generous at heart at the thought of the
  benefits he might be conferring upon his patron that the illegality of the
  meeting did not occur to him, or if it occurred was dismissed as too
  preposterous for consideration.</p>

  <p>And so there had come by the forest paths, by canoe, from fishing
  villages, from far-off agricultural lands near by the great mountains, from
  timber cuttings in the lower forest, higher chiefs and little chiefs, headmen
  and lesser headmen, till they made a respectable crowd, too vast for the
  comfort of the Ochori elders who must needs provide them with food and
  lodgings.</p>

  <p>"Noble chiefs of the Ochori," began Bosambo, and Notiki nudged his
  neighbour with a sharp elbow, for Notiki was an old man of forty-three, and
  thin.</p>

  <p>"Our lord desires us to give him something," he said.</p>

  <p>He was a bitter man this Notiki, a relative of former chiefs of the
  Ochori, and now no more than over-head of four villages.</p>

  <p>"Wa!" said his neighbour, with his shining face turned to Bosambo.</p>

  <p>Notiki grunted but said no more.</p>

  <p>"I have assembled you here," said Bosambo, "because I love to see you, and
  because it is good that I should meet those who are in authority under me to
  administer the laws which the King my master has set for your guidance."</p>

  <p>Word for word it was a paraphrase of an address which Sanders himself had
  delivered three months ago. His audience may have forgotten the fact, but
  Notiki at least recognized the plagiarism and said "Oh, ho!" under his breath
  and made a scornful noise.</p>

  <p>"Now I must go from you," said Bosambo.</p>

  <p>There was a little chorus of dismay, but Notiki's voice did not swell the
  volume.</p>

  <p>"The King has called me to the coast, and for the space of two moons I
  shall be as dead to you, though my fetish will watch you and my spirit will
  walk these streets every night with big ears to listen to evil talk, and
  great big eyes to see the hearts of men. Yea, from this city to the very end
  of my dominions over to Kalala." His accusing eyes fixed Notiki, and the thin
  man wriggled uncomfortably.</p>

  <p>"This man is a devil," he muttered under his breath, "he hears and sees
  all things."</p>

  <p>"And if you ask me why I go," Bosambo went on, "I tell you this: swearing
  you all to secrecy that this word shall not go beyond your huts" (there were
  some two thousand people present to share the mystery), "my lord Sandi has
  great need of me. For who of us is so wise that he can look into the heart
  and understand the sorrow-call which goes from brother to brother and from
  blood to blood. I say no more save my lord desires me, and since I am the
  King of the Ochori, a nation great amongst all nations, must I go down to the
  coast like a dog or like the headman of a fisher-village?"</p>

  <p>He paused dramatically, and there was a faint&mdash;a very faint
  &mdash;murmur which he might interpret as an expression of his people's wish
  that he should travel in a state bordering upon magnificence.</p>

  <p>Faint indeed was that murmur, because there was a hint of taxation in the
  business, a promise of levies to be extracted from an unwilling peasantry; a
  suggestion of lazy men leaving the comfortable shade of their huts to hurry
  perspiring in the forest that gum and rubber and similar offerings should be
  laid at the complacent feet of their overlord.</p>

  <p>Bosambo heard the murmur and marked its horrid lack of heartiness and was
  in no sense put out of countenance.</p>

  <p>"As you say," said he approvingly, "it is proper that I should journey to
  my lord and to the strange people beyond the coast&mdash;to the land where
  even slaves wear trousers&mdash;carrying with me most wonderful presents that
  the name of the Ochori shall be as thunder upon the waters and even great
  kings shall speak in pride of you," he paused again.</p>

  <p>Now it was a dead silence which greeted his peroration. Notably
  unenthusiastic was this gathering, twiddling its toes and blandly avoiding
  his eye. Two moons before he had extracted something more than his tribute
  &mdash;a tribute which was the prerogative of government.</p>

  <p>Yet then, as Notiki said under his breath, or openly, or by innuendo as
  the sentiment of his company demanded, four and twenty canoes laden with the
  fruits of taxation had come to the Ochori city, and five only of those partly
  filled had paddled down to headquarters to carry the Ochori tribute to the
  overlord of the land.</p>

  <p>"I will bring back with me new things," said Bosambo enticingly; "strange
  devil boxes, large magics which will entrance you, things that no common man
  has seen, such as I and Sandi alone know in all this land. Go now, I tell
  thee, to your people in this country, telling them all that I have spoken to
  you, and when the moon is in a certain quarter they will come in joy bearing
  presents in both hands, and these ye shall bring to me."</p>

  <p>"But, lord!" it was the bold Notiki who stood in protest, "what shall
  happen to such of us headmen who come without gifts in our hands for your
  lordship, saying 'Our people are stubborn and will give nothing'?"</p>

  <p>"Who knows?" was all the satisfaction he got from Bosambo, with the
  additional significant hint, "I shall not blame you, knowing that it is not
  because of your fault but because your people do not love you, and because
  they desire another chief over them. The palaver is finished."</p>

  <p>Finished it was, so far as Bosambo was concerned. He called a council of
  his headmen that night in his hut.</p>

  <p>Bosambo made his preparations at leisure. There was much to avoid before
  he took his temporary farewell of the tribe. Not the least to be counted
  amongst those things to be done was the extraction, to its uttermost
  possibility, of the levy which he had quite improperly instituted.</p>

  <p>And of the things to avoid, none was more urgent or called for greater
  thought than the necessity for so timing his movements that he did not come
  upon Sanders or drift within the range of his visible and audible
  influence.</p>

  <p>Here fortune may have been with Bosambo, but it is more likely that he had
  carefully thought out every detail of his scheme. Sanders at the moment was
  collecting hut tax along the Kisai river and there was also, as Bosambo well
  knew, a murder trial of great complexity waiting for his decision at Ikan. A
  headman was suspected of murdering his chief wife, and the only evidence
  against him was that of the under wives to whom she displayed much hauteur
  and arrogance.</p>

  <p>The people of the Ochori might be shocked at the exorbitant demands which
  their lord put upon them, but they were too wise to deny him his wishes.
  There had been a time in the history of the Ochori when demands were far
  heavier, and made with great insolence by a people who bore the reputation of
  being immensely fearful. It had come to be a by-word of the people when they
  discussed their lord with greater freedom than he could have wished, the
  tyranny of Bosambo was better than the tyranny of Akasava.</p>

  <p>Amongst the Ochori chiefs, greater and lesser, only one was conspicuous by
  his failure to carry proper offerings to his lord. When all the gifts were
  laid on sheets of native cloth in the great space before Bosambo's hut,
  Notiki's sheet was missing and with good reason as he sent his son to
  explain.</p>

  <p>"Lord," said this youth, lank and wild, "my father has collected for you
  many beautiful things, such as gum and rubber and the teeth of elephants. Now
  he would have brought these and laid them at your lovely feet, but the roads
  through the forest are very evil, and there have been floods in the northern
  country and he cannot pass the streams. Also the paths through the forest are
  thick and tangled and my father fears for his carriers."</p>

  <p>Bosambo looked at him, thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Go back to your father, N'gobi," he said gently, "and tell him that
  though there come no presents from him to me, I, his master and chief,
  knowing he loves me, understand all things well."</p>

  <p>N'gobi brightened visibly. He had been ready to bolt, understanding
  something of Bosambo's dexterity with a stick and fearing that the chief
  would loose upon him the vengeance his father had called down upon his own
  hoary head.</p>

  <p>"Of the evil roads I know," said Bosambo; "now this you shall say to your
  father: Bosambo the chief goes away from this city and upon a long journey;
  for two moons he will be away doing the business of his cousin and friend
  Sandi. And when my lord Bim-bi has bitten once at the third moon I will come
  back and I will visit your father. But because the roads are bad," he went
  on, "and the floods come even in this dry season," he said significantly,
  "and the forest is so entangled that he cannot bring his presents, sending
  only the son of his wife to me, he shall make against my coming such a road
  as shall be in width, the distance between the King's hut and the hut of the
  King's wife; and he shall clear from this road all there are of trees, and he
  shall bridge the strong stream and dig pits for the floods. And to this end
  he shall take every man of his kingdom and set them to labour, and as they
  work they shall sing a song which goes:</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"We are doing Notiki's work,<br>
  The work Notiki set us to do,<br>
  Rather than send to the lord his King<br>
  The presents which Bosambo demanded.</p><br>

  <p>"The palaver is finished."</p>

  <p>This is the history, or the beginning of the history, of the straight road
  which cuts through the heart of the Ochori country from the edge of the river
  by the cataracts, even to the mountains of the great King, a road famous
  throughout Africa and imperishably associated with Bosambo's name&mdash;this
  by the way.</p>

  <p>On the first day following the tax palaver Bosambo went down the river
  with four canoes, each canoe painted beautifully with camwood and gum, and
  with twenty-four paddlers.</p>

  <p>It was by a fluke that he missed Sanders. As it happened, the Commissioner
  had come back to the big river to collect the evidence of the murdered
  woman's brother who was a petty headman of an Isisi fishing village. The
  <i>Zaire</i> came into the river almost as the last of Bosambo's canoes went
  round the bend out of sight, and since a legend existed on the river, a
  legend for the inception of which Bosambo himself was mainly responsible,
  that he was in some way related to Mr. Commissioner Sanders, no man spoke of
  Bosambo's passing.</p>

  <p>The chief came to headquarters on the third day after his departure from
  his city. His subsequent movements are somewhat obscure, even to Sanders, who
  has been at some pains to trace them.</p>

  <p>It is known that he drew a hundred and fifty pounds in English gold from
  Sanders' storekeeper&mdash;he had piled up a fairly extensive credit during
  the years of his office&mdash;that he embarked with one headman and his wife
  on a coasting boat due for Sierra Leone, and that from that city came a
  long-winded demand in Arabic by a ragged messenger for a further instalment
  of one hundred pounds. Sanders heard the news on his return to headquarters
  and was a little worried.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if the devil is going to desert his people?" he said.</p>

  <p>Hamilton the Houssa laughed.</p>

  <p>"He is more likely to desert his people than to desert a balance of four
  hundred pounds which now stands to his credit here," he said. "Bosambo has
  felt the call of civilization. I suppose he ought to have secured your
  permission to leave his territory?"</p>

  <p>"He has given his people work to keep them busy," Sanders said a little
  gravely. "I have had a passionate protest from Notiki, one of his chiefs in
  the north. Bosambo has set him to build a road through the forest, and Notiki
  objects."</p>

  <p>The two men were walking across the yellow parade ground past the Houssas
  hut in the direction of headquarters' bungalow.</p>

  <p>"What about your murderer?" asked Hamilton, after a while, as they mounted
  the broad wooden steps which led to the bungalow stoep.</p>

  <p>Sanders shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Everybody lied," he said briefly. "I can do no less than send the man to
  the Village. I could have hung him on clear evidence, but the lady seemed to
  have been rather unpopular and the murderer quite a person to be commended in
  the eyes of the public. The devil of it is," he said as he sank into his big
  chair with a sigh, "that had I hanged him it would not have been necessary to
  write three foolscap sheets of report. I dislike these domestic murderers
  intensely&mdash;give me a ravaging brigand with the hands of all people
  against him."</p>

  <p>"You'll have one if you don't touch wood," said Hamilton seriously.</p>

  <p>Hamilton came of Scottish stock&mdash;and the Scots are notorious
  prophets.</p><br>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">NOW the truth may be told of Bosambo, and all his movements
  may be explained by this revelation of his benevolence. In the silence of his
  hut had he planned his schemes. In the dark aisles of the forests, under
  starless skies when his fellow-huntsmen lay deep in the sleep which the
  innocent and the barbarian alone enjoy; in drowsy moments when he sat
  dispensing justice, what time litigants had droned monotonously he had
  perfected his scheme.</p>

  <p>Imagination is the first fruit of civilization and when the reverend
  fathers of the coast taught Bosambo certain magics, they were also implanting
  in him the ability to picture possibilities, and shape from his knowledge of
  human affairs the eventual consequences of his actions. This is imagination
  somewhat elaborately and clumsily defined.</p>

  <p>To one person only had Bosambo unburdened himself of his schemes.</p>

  <p>In the privacy of his great hut he had sat with his wife, a steaming dish
  of fish between them, for however lax Bosambo might be, his wife was an
  earnest follower of the Prophet and would tolerate no such abomination as the
  flesh of the cloven-hoofed goat.</p>

  <p>He had told her many things.</p>

  <p>"Light of my heart," said he, "our lord Sandi is my father and my mother,
  a giver of riches, and a plentiful provider of pence. Now it seems to me,
  that though he is a just man and great, having neither fear of his enemies
  nor soft words for his friends, yet the lords of his land who live so very
  far away do him no honour."</p>

  <p>"Master," said the woman quietly, "is it no honour that he should be
  placed as a king over us?"</p>

  <p>Bosambo beamed approvingly.</p>

  <p>"Thou hast spoken the truth, oh my beloved!" said he, in the extravagance
  of his admiration. "Yet I know much of the white folk, for I have lived along
  this coast from Dacca to Mossomedes. Also I have sailed to a far place called
  Madagascar, which is on the other side of the world, and I know the way of
  white folk. Even in Benguella there is a governor who is not so great as
  Sandi, and about his breast are all manner of shining stars that glitter most
  beautifully in the sun, and he wears ribbons about him and bright coloured
  sashes and swords." He wagged his finger impressively. "Have I not said that
  he is not so great as Sandi. When saw you my lord with stars or cross or sash
  or a sword?</p>

  <p>"Also at Decca, where the Frenchi live. At certain places in the Togo,
  which is Allamandi,[1] I have seen men with this same style of ornaments, for
  thus it is that the white folk do honour to their kind."</p>

  <p>[Footnote 1: Allamandi&mdash;German territory.]</p>

  <p>He was silent a long time and his brown-eyed wife looked at him
  curiously.</p>

  <p>"Yet what can you do, my lord?" she asked. "Although you are very
  powerful, and Sandi loves you, this is certain, that none will listen to
  <i>you</i> and do honour to Sandi at your word&mdash;though I do not know the
  ways of the white people, yet of this I am sure."</p>

  <p>Again Bosambo's large mouth stretched from ear to ear, and his two rows of
  white teeth gleamed pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"You are as the voice of wisdom and the very soul of cleverness," he said,
  "for you speak that which is true. Yet I know ways, for I am very cunning and
  wise, being a holy man and acquainted with blessed apostles such as Paul and
  the blessed Peter, who had his ear cut off because a certain dancing woman
  desired it. Also by magic it was put on again because he could not hear the
  cocks crow. All this and similar things I have here." He touched his
  forehead.</p>

  <p>Wise woman that she was, she had made no attempt to pry into her husband's
  business, but spent the days preparing for the journey, she and the nut-brown
  sprawling child of immense girth, who was the apple of Bosambo's eye.</p>

  <p>So Bosambo had passed down the river as has been described, and four days
  after he left there disappeared from the Ochori village ten brothers in blood
  of his, young hunting men who had faced all forms of death for the very love
  of it, and these vanished from the land and none knew where they went save
  that they did not follow on their master's trail.</p>

  <p>Tukili, the chief of the powerful eastern island Isisi, or, as it is
  contemptuously called, the N'gombi-Isisi by the riverain folk, went hunting
  one day, and ill fortune led him to the border of the Ochori country. Ill
  fortune was it for one Fimili, a straight maid of fourteen, beautiful by
  native standard, who was in the forest searching for roots which were
  notorious as a cure for "boils" which distressed her unamiable father.</p>

  <p>Tukili saw the girl and desired her, and that which Tukili desired he
  took. She offered little opposition to being carried away to the Isisi city
  when she discovered that her life would be spared, and possibly was no worse
  off in the harem of Tukili than she would have been in the hut of the poor
  fisherman for whom her father had designed her. A few years before, such an
  incident would have passed almost unnoticed.</p>

  <p>The Ochori were so used to being robbed of women and of goats, so meek in
  their acceptance of wrongs that would have set the spears of any other nation
  shining, that they would have accepted the degradation and preserved a sense
  of thankfulness that the robber had limited his raiding to one girl, and that
  a maid. But with the coming of Bosambo there had arrived a new spirit in the
  Ochori. They had learnt their strength, incidentally they had learnt their
  rights. The father of the girl went hot-foot to his over-chief, Notiki, and
  covered himself with ashes at the door of the chief's hut.</p>

  <p>"This is a bad palaver," said Notiki, "and since Bosambo has deserted us
  and is making our marrows like water that we should build him a road, and
  there is none in this land whom I may call chief or who may speak with
  authority, it seems by my age and by relationship to the kings of this land,
  I must do that which is desirable."</p>

  <p>So he gathered together two thousand men who were working on the road and
  were very pleased indeed to carry something lighter than rocks and felled
  trees, and with these spears he marched into the Isisi forest, burning and
  slaying whenever he came upon a little village which offered no opposition.
  Thus he took to himself the air and title of conqueror with as little excuse
  as a flamboyant general ever had.</p>

  <p>Had it occurred on the river, this warlike expedition must have attracted
  the attention of Sanders. The natural roadway of the territory is a waterway.
  It is only when operations are begun against the internal tribes who inhabit
  the bush, and whose armies can move under the cloak of the forest (and none
  wiser) that Sanders found himself at a disadvantage.</p>

  <p>Tukili himself heard nothing of the army that was being led against him
  until it was within a day's march of his gates. Then he sallied forth with a
  force skilled in warfare and practised in the hunt. The combat lasted exactly
  ten minutes and all that was left of Notiki's spears made the best of their
  way homeward, avoiding, as far as possible, those villages which they had
  visited en route with such disastrous results to the unfortunate
  inhabitants.</p>

  <p>Now it is impossible that one conqueror shall be sunk to oblivion without
  his victor claiming for himself the style of his victim. Tukili had defeated
  his adversary, and Tukili was no exception to the general rule, and from
  being a fairly well-disposed king, amiable&mdash;too amiable as we have
  shown&mdash;and kindly, and just, he became of a sudden a menace to all that
  part of Sanders' territory which lies between the French land and the
  river.</p>

  <p>It was such a situation as this as only Bosambo might deal with, and
  Sanders heartily cursed his absent chief and might have cursed him with
  greater fervour had he had an inkling of the mission to which Bosambo had
  appointed himself.</p><br>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">HIS Excellency the Administrator of the period had his
  office at a prosperous city of stone which we will call Koombooli, though
  that is not its name.</p>

  <p>He was a stout, florid man, patient and knowledgeable. He had been sent to
  clear up the mess which two incompetent administrators made, who had owed
  their position rather to the constant appearance of their friends and patrons
  in the division lobbies than to their acquaintance with the native mind, and
  it is eloquent of the regard in which His Excellency was held that, although
  he was a Knight Commander of St. Michael and St. George, a Companion of a
  Victorian Order, a Commander of the Bath, and the son of a noble house, he
  was known familiarly along the coast to all administrators, commissioners,
  even to the deputy inspectors, as "Bob."</p>

  <p>Bosambo came to the presence with an inward quaking. In a sense he had
  absconded from his trust, and he did not doubt that Sanders had made all men
  acquainted with the suddenness and the suspicious character of his
  disappearance.</p>

  <p>And the first words of His Excellency the Administrator confirmed all
  Bosambo's worst fears.</p>

  <p>"O! chief," said Sir Robert with a little twinkle in his eye, "are you so
  fearful of your people that you run away from them?"</p>

  <p>"Mighty master," answered Bosambo, humbly, "I do not know fear, for as
  your honour may have heard, I am a very brave man, fearing nothing save my
  lord Sanders' displeasure."</p>

  <p>A ghost of a smile played about the corners of Sir Robert's mouth.</p>

  <p>"That you have earned, my friend," said he. "Now you shall tell me why you
  came away secretly, also why you desired this palaver with me. And do not
  lie, Bosambo," he said, "for I am he who hung three chiefs on Gallows Hill
  above Grand Bassam because they spoke falsely."</p>

  <p>This was one of the fictions which was current on the coast, and was
  implicitly believed in by the native population. The truth will be recounted
  at another time, but it is sufficient to say that Bosambo was one of those
  who did not doubt the authenticity of the legend.</p>

  <p>"Now I will speak to you, O my lord," he said earnestly, "and I speak by
  all oaths, both the oaths of my own people&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Spare me the oaths of the Kroo folk," protested Sir Robert, and raised a
  warning hand.</p>

  <p>"Then by Markie and Lukie will I swear," said Bosambo, fervently; "those
  fine fellows of whom Your Excellency knows. I have sat long in the country of
  the Ochori, and I have ruled wisely according to my abilities. And over me at
  all times was Sandi, who was a father to his people and so beautiful of mind
  and countenance that when he came to us even the dead folk would rise up to
  speak to him. This is a miracle," said Bosambo profoundly but cautiously,
  "which I have heard but which I have not seen. Now this I ask you who see all
  things, and here is the puzzle which I will set to your honour. If Sandi is
  so great and so wise, and is so loved by the greater King, how comes it that
  he stays for ever in one place, having no beautiful stars about his neck nor
  wonderful ribbons around his stomach such as the great Frenchiman&mdash;and
  the great Allamandi men, and even the Portuguesi men wear who are honoured by
  their kings?"</p>

  <p>It was a staggering question, and Sir Robert Sanleigh sat up and stared at
  the solemn face of the man before him.</p>

  <p>Bosambo, an unromantic figure in trousers, jacket, and shirt&mdash;he was
  collarless&mdash;had thrust his hands deeply into unaccustomed pockets,
  ignorant of the disrespect which such an attitude displayed, and was staring
  back at the Administrator.</p>

  <p>"O! chief," asked the puzzled Sir Robert, "this is a strange palaver you
  make&mdash;who gave you these ideas?"</p>

  <p>"Lord, none gave me this idea save my own bright mind," said Bosambo.
  "Yes, many nights have I laid thinking of these things for I am just and I
  have faith."</p>

  <p>His Excellency kept his unwavering eye upon the other. He had heard of
  Bosambo, knew him as an original, and at this moment was satisfied in his own
  mind of the other's sincerity.</p>

  <p>A smaller man than he, his predecessor for example, might have dismissed
  the preposterous question as an impertinence and given the questioner short
  shrift. But Sir Robert understood his native.</p>

  <p>"These are things too high for me, Bosambo," he said. "What dog am I that
  I should question the mind of my lords? In their wisdom they give honour and
  they punish. It is written."</p>

  <p>Bosambo nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yet, lord," he persisted, "my own cousin who sweeps your lordship's
  stables told me this morning that on the days of big palavers you also have
  stars and beautiful things upon your breast, and noble ribbons about your
  lordship's stomach. Now your honour shall tell me by whose favour these
  things come about."</p>

  <p>Sir Robert chuckled.</p>

  <p>"Bosambo," he said solemnly, "they gave these things to me because I am an
  old man. Now when your lord Sandi becomes old these honours also will he
  receive."</p>

  <p>He saw Bosambo's face fall and went on:</p>

  <p>"Also much may happen that will bring Sandi to their lordships' eyes, they
  who sit above us. Some great deed that he may do, some high service he may
  offer to his king. All these happenings bring nobility and honour. Now," he
  went on kindly, "go back to your people, remembering that I shall think of
  you and of Sandi, and that I shall know that you came because of your love
  for him, and that on a day which is written I will send a book to my masters
  speaking well of Sandi, for his sake and for the sake of the people who love
  him. The palaver is finished."</p>

  <p>Bosambo went out of the Presence a dissatisfied man, passed through the
  hall where a dozen commissioners and petty chiefs were waiting audience,
  skirted the great white building and came in time to his own cousin, who
  swept the stables of His Excellency the Administrator. And here, in the
  coolness of the stone-walled mews, he learnt much about the Administrator;
  little tit-bits of information which were unlikely to be published in the
  official gazette. Also he acquired a considerable amount of data concerning
  the giving of honours, and after a long examination and cross-examination of
  his wearied relative he left him as dry as a sucked orange, but happy in the
  possession of a new five-shilling piece which Bosambo had magnificently
  pressed upon him, and which subsequently proved to be bad.</p><br>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p class="first">BY the River of Spirits is a deep forest which stretches
  back and back in a dense and chaotic tangle of strangled sapling and
  parasitic weed to the edge of the Pigmy forest. No man&mdash;white or brown
  or black&mdash;has explored the depth of the Forbidden Forest, for here the
  wild beasts have their lairs and rear their young; and here are mosquito in
  dense clouds. Moreover, and this is important, a certain potent ghost named
  Bim-bi stalks restlessly from one border of the forest to the other. Bim-bi
  is older than the sun and more terrible than any other ghost. For he feeds on
  the moon, and at nights you may see how the edge of the desert world is
  bitten by his great mouth until it becomes, first, the half of a moon, then
  the merest slither, and then no moon at all. And on the very dark nights,
  when the gods are hastily making him a new meal, the ravenous Bim-bi calls to
  his need the stars; and you may watch, as every little boy of the Akasava has
  watched, clutching his father's hand tightly in his fear, the hot rush of
  meteors across the velvet sky to the rapacious and open jaws of Bim-bi.</p>

  <p>He was a ghost respected by all peoples&mdash;Akasava, Ochori, Isisi,
  N'gombi, and Bush folk. By the Bolengi, the Bomongo, and even the distant
  Upper Congo people feared him. Also all the chiefs for generations upon
  generations had sent tribute of corn and salt to the edge of the forest for
  his propitiation, and it is a legend that when the Isisi fought the Akasava
  in the great war, the envoy of the Isisi was admitted without molestation to
  the enemy's lines in order to lay an offering at Bim-bi's feet. Only one man
  in the world, so far as the People of the River know, has ever spoken
  slightingly of Bim-bi, and that man was Bosambo of the Ochori, who had no
  respect for any ghosts save of his own creation.</p>

  <p>It is the custom on the Akasava district to hold a ghost palaver to which
  the learned men of all tribes are invited, and the palaver takes place in the
  village of Ookos by the edge of the forest.</p>

  <p>On a certain day in the year of the floods and when Bosambo was gone a
  month from his land, there came messengers chance-found and walking in terror
  to all the principal cities and villages of the Akasava, of the Isisi, and of
  the N'gombi-Isisi carrying this message:</p>

  <p>"Mimbimi, son of Simbo Sako, son of Ogi, has opened his house to his
  friends on the night when Bim-bi has swallowed the moon."</p>

  <p>A summons to such a palaver in the second name of Bim-bi was not one
  likely to be ignored, but a summons from Mimbimi was at least to be wondered
  at and to be speculated upon, for Mimbimi was an unknown quantity, though
  some gossips professed to know him as the chief of one of the Nomadic tribes
  which ranged the heart of the forest, preying on Akasava and Isisi with equal
  discrimination. But these gossips were of a mind not peculiar to any
  nationality or to any colour. They were those jealous souls who either could
  not or would not confess that they were ignorant on the topic of the
  moment.</p>

  <p>Be he robber chief, or established by law and government, this much was
  certain. Mimbimi had called for his secret palaver and the most noble and
  arrogant of chiefs must obey, even though the obedience spelt disaster for
  the daring man who had summoned them to conference.</p>

  <p>Tuligini, a victorious captain, not lightly to be summoned, might have
  ignored the invitation, but for the seriousness of his eldermen, who, versed
  in the conventions of Bim-bi and those who invoked his name, stood aghast at
  the mere suggestion that this palaver should be ignored. Tuligini demanded,
  and with reason:</p>

  <p>"Who was this who dare call the vanquisher of Bosambo to a palaver? for am
  I not the great buffalo of the forest? and do not all men bow down to me in
  fear?"</p>

  <p>"Lord, you speak the truth," said his trembling councillor, "yet this is a
  ghost palaver and all manner of evils come to those who do not obey."</p>

  <p>Sanders, through his spies, heard of the summons in the name of Bim-bi,
  and was a little troubled. There was nothing too small to be serious in the
  land over which he ruled.</p>

  <p>As for instance: Some doubt existed in the Lesser N'gombi country as to
  whether teeth filed to a point were more becoming than teeth left as Nature
  placed them. Tombini, the chief of N'gombi, held the view that Nature's way
  was best, whilst B'limbini, his cousin, was the chief exponent of the
  sharpened form.</p>

  <p>It took two battalions of King Coast Rifles, half a battery of artillery
  and Sanders to settle the question, which became a national one.</p>

  <p>"I wish Bosambo were to the devil before he left his country," said
  Sanders, irritably. "I should feel safe if that oily villain was sitting in
  the Ochori."</p>

  <p>"What is the trouble?" asked Hamilton, looking up from his task&mdash;he
  was making cigarettes with a new machine which somebody had sent him from
  home.</p>

  <p>"An infernal Bim-bi palaver," said Sanders; "the last time that happened,
  if I remember rightly, I had to burn crops on the right bank of the river for
  twenty miles to bring the Isisi to a sense of their unimportance."</p>

  <p>"You will be able to burn crops on the left side this time," said
  Hamilton, cheerfully, his nimble fingers twiddling the silver rollers of his
  machine.</p>

  <p>"I thought I had the country quiet," said Sanders, a little bitterly, "and
  at this moment I especially wanted it so."</p>

  <p>"Why at this particular moment?" asked the other in surprise.</p>

  <p>Sanders took out of the breast pocket of his uniform jacket a folded
  paper, and passed it across the table.</p>

  <p>Hamilton read:</p>

  <p>"SIR,&mdash;I have the honour to inform you that the Rt. Hon. Mr. James
  Bolzer, his Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonies, is expected to
  arrive at your station on the thirtieth inst. I trust you will give the Right
  Honourable gentleman every facility for studying on the spot the problems
  upon which he is such an authority. I have to request you to instruct all
  Sub-Commissioners, Inspectors, and Officers commanding troops in your
  division to make adequate arrangements for Mr. Bolzer's comfort and
  protection.</p>

  <p>"I have the honour to be, etc."</p>

  <p>Hamilton read the letter twice.</p>

  <p>"To study on the spot those questions upon which he is such an authority,"
  he repeated. He was a sarcastic devil when he liked.</p>

  <p>"The thirtieth is to-morrow," Hamilton went on, "and I suppose I am one of
  the officers commanding troops who must school my ribald soldiery in the art
  of protecting the Rt. Hon. gent."</p>

  <p>"To be exact," said Sanders, "you are the only officer commanding troops
  in the territory; do what you can. You wouldn't believe it," he smiled a
  little shamefacedly, "I had applied for six months' leave when this
  came."</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!" said Hamilton, for somehow he never associated Sanders with
  holidays.</p>

  <p>What Hamilton did was very simple, because Hamilton always did things in
  the manner which gave him the least trouble. A word to his orderly conveyed
  across the parade ground, roused the sleepy bugler of the guard, and the air
  was filled with the "Assembly." Sixty men of the Houssas paraded in
  anticipation of a sudden call northwards.</p>

  <p>"My children," said Hamilton, whiffling his pliant cane, "soon there will
  come here a member of government who knows nothing. Also he may stray into
  the forest and lose himself as the bride-groom's cow strays from the field of
  his father-in-law, not knowing his new surroundings. Now it is to you we look
  for his safety&mdash;I and the government. Also Sandi, our lord. You shall
  not let this stranger out of your sight, nor shall you allow approach him any
  such evil men as the N'gombi iron sellers or the fishing men of N'gar or
  makers of wooden charms, for the government has said this man must not be
  robbed, but must be treated well, and you of the guard shall all salute him,
  also, when the time arrives."</p>

  <p>Hamilton meant no disrespect in his graphic illustration. He was dealing
  with a simple people who required vivid word-pictures to convince them. And
  certainly they found nothing undignified in the right honourable gentleman
  when he arrived next morning.</p>

  <p>He was above the medium height, somewhat stout, very neat and orderly, and
  he twirled a waxed moustache, turning grey. He had heavy and bilious eyes,
  and a certain pompousness of manner distinguished him. Also an effervescent
  geniality which found expression in shaking hands with anybody who happened
  to be handy, in mechanically agreeing with all views that were put before him
  and immediately afterwards contradicting them; in a painful desire to be
  regarded as popular. In fact, in all the things which got immediately upon
  Sanders' nerves, this man was a sealed pattern of a bore.</p>

  <p>He wanted to know things, but the things he wanted to know were of no
  importance, and the information he extracted could not be of any assistance
  to him. His mind was largely occupied in such vital problems as what happened
  to the brooms which the Houssas used to keep their quarters clean when they
  were worn out, and what would be the effect of an increased ration of lime
  juice upon the morals and discipline of the troops under Hamilton's command.
  Had he been less of a trial Sanders would not have allowed him to go into the
  interior without a stronger protest. As it was, Sanders had turned out of his
  own bedroom, and had put all his slender resources at the disposal of the
  Cabinet Minister (taking his holiday, by the way, during the long recess),
  and had wearied himself in order to reach some subject of interest where he
  and his guest could meet on common ground.</p>

  <p>"I shall have to let him go," he said to Hamilton, when the two had met
  one night after Mr. Blowter had retired to bed, "I spent the whole of this
  afternoon discussing the comparative values of mosquito nets, and he is such
  a perfect ass that you cannot snub him. If he had only had the sense to bring
  a secretary or two he would have been easier to handle."</p>

  <p>Hamilton laughed.</p>

  <p>"When a man like that travels," he said, "he ought to bring somebody who
  knows the ways and habits of the animal. I had a bright morning with him
  going into the question of boots."</p>

  <p>"But what of Mimbimi?"</p>

  <p>"Mimbimi is rather a worry to me. I do not know him at all," said Sanders
  with a puzzled frown. "Ahmet, the spy, has seen one of the chiefs who
  attended the palaver, which apparently was very impressive. Up to now nothing
  has happened which would justify a movement against him; the man is possibly
  from the French Congo."</p>

  <p>"Any news of Bosambo?" asked Hamilton.</p>

  <p>Sanders shook his head.</p>

  <p>"So far as I can learn," he said grimly, "he has gone on <i>Cape Coast
  Castle</i> for a real aboriginal jag. There will be trouble for Bosambo when
  he comes back."</p>

  <p>"What a blessing it would be now," sighed Hamilton, "if we could turn old
  man Blowter into his tender keeping." And the men laughed
  simultaneously.</p><br>

  <h3>V</h3>

  <p class="first">THERE was a time, years and years ago, when the Ochori
  people set a great stake on the edge of the forest by the Mountain. This they
  smeared with a paint made by the admixture of camwood and copal gum.</p>

  <p>It was one of the few intelligent acts which may be credited to the Ochori
  in those dull days, for the stake stood for danger. It marked the boundary of
  the N'gombi lands beyond which it was undesirable that any man of the Ochori
  should go.</p>

  <p>It was not erected without consideration. A palaver which lasted from the
  full of one moon to the waning of the next, sacrifices of goats and
  sprinkling of blood, divinations, incantations, readings of devil marks on
  sandy foreshores; all right and proper ceremonies were gone through before
  there came a night of bright moonlight when the whole Ochori nation went
  forth and planted that post.</p>

  <p>Then, I believe, the people of the Ochori, having invested the post with
  qualities which it did not possess, went back to their homes and forgot all
  about it. Yet if they forgot there were nations who regarded the devil sign
  with some awe, and certainly Mimbimi, the newly-arisen ranger of the forest,
  who harried the Akasava and the Isisi, and even the N'gombi-Isisi, must have
  had full faith in its potency, for he never moved beyond that border. Once,
  so legend said, he brought his terrible warriors to the very edge of the land
  and paid homage to the innocent sign-post which Sanders had set up and which
  announced no more, in plain English, than trespassers will be prosecuted.
  Having done his <i>devoir</i> he retired to his forest lair. His operations
  were not to go without an attempted reprisal. Many parties went out against
  him, notably that which Tumbilimi the chief of Isisi led. He took a hundred
  picked men to avenge the outrage which this intruder had put upon him in
  daring to summons him to palaver.</p>

  <p>Now Sugini was an arrogant man, for had he not routed the army of Bosambo?
  That Bosambo was not in command made no difference and did not tarnish the
  prestige in Tumbilimi's eyes, and though the raids upon his territory by
  Mimbimi had been mild, the truculent chief, disdaining the use of his full
  army, marched with his select column to bring in the head and the feet of the
  man who had dared violate his territory.</p>

  <p>Exactly what happened to Tumbilimi's party is not known; all the men who
  escaped from the ambush in which Mimbimi lay give a different account, and
  each account creditable to themselves, though the only thing which stands in
  their favour is that they did certainly save their lives. Certainly
  Tumbilimi, he of the conquering spears, came back no more, and those parts
  which he had threatened to detach from his enemy were in fact detached from
  him and were discovered one morning at the very gates of his city for his
  horrified subjects to marvel at. When warlike discussions arose, as they did
  at infrequent intervals, it was the practice of the people to send complaints
  to Sanders and leave him to deal with the matter. You cannot, however, lead
  an army against a dozen guerrilla chiefs with any profit to the army as we
  once discovered in a country somewhat south of Sanders' domains. Had
  Mimbimi's sphere of operations been confined to the river Sanders would have
  laid him by the heels quickly enough, because the river brigand is easy to
  catch since he would starve in the forest, and if he took to the bush would
  certainly come back to the gleaming water for very life.</p>

  <p>But here was a forest man obviously, who needed no river for himself, but
  was content to wait watchfully in the dim recesses of the woods.</p>

  <p>Sanders sent three spies to locate him, and gave his attention to the more
  immediate problem of his Right Honourable guest. Mr. Joseph Blowter had
  decided to make a trip into the interior and the <i>Zaire</i> had been placed
  at his disposal. A heaven-sent riot in the bushland, sixty miles west of the
  Residency, had relieved both Sanders and Hamilton from the necessity of
  accompanying the visitor, and he departed by steamer with a bodyguard of
  twenty armed Houssas; more than sufficient in these peaceful times.</p>

  <p>"What about Mimbimi?" asked Hamilton under his breath as they stood on a
  little concrete quay, and watched the <i>Zaire</i> beating out to
  midstream.</p>

  <p>"Mimbimi is evidently a bushman," said Sanders briefly. "He will not come
  to the river. Besides, he is giving the Ochori a wide berth, and it is to the
  Ochori that our friend is going. I cannot see how he can possibly dump
  himself into mischief."</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, as a matter of precaution, Sanders telegraphed to the
  Administration not only the departure, but the precautions he had taken for
  the safety of the Minister, and the fact that neither he nor Hamilton were
  accompanying him on his tour of inspection "to study on the spot those
  problems with which he was so well acquainted."</p>

  <p>"O.K." flashed Bob across the wires, and that was sufficient for Sanders.
  Of Mr. Blowter's adventures it is unnecessary to tell in detail. How he
  mistook every village for a city, and every city for a nation, of how he
  landed wherever he could and spoke long and eloquently on the blessing of
  civilization, and the glories of the British flag&mdash;all this through an
  interpreter&mdash;of how he went into the question of basket-making and
  fly-fishing, and of how he demonstrated to the fishermen of the little river
  a method of catching fish by fly, and how he did not catch anything. All
  these matters might be told in great detail with no particular credit to the
  subject of the monograph.</p>

  <p>In course of time he came to the Ochori land and was welcomed by Notiki,
  who had taken upon himself, on the strength of his rout, the position of
  chieftainship. This he did with one eye on the river, ready to bolt the
  moment Bosambo's canoe came sweeping round the bend.</p>

  <p>Now Sanders had particularly warned Mr. Blowter that under no
  circumstances should he sleep ashore. He gave a variety of reasons, such as
  the prevalence of Beri-Beri, the insidious spread of sleeping sickness, the
  irritation of malaria-bearing mosquitoes, and of other insects which it would
  be impolite to mention in the pages of a family journal.</p>

  <p>But Notiki had built a new hut as he said especially for his guest, and
  Mr. Blowter, no doubt, honoured by the attention which was shown to him,
  broke the restricting rule that Sanders had laid down, quitted the
  comfortable cabin which had been his home on the river journey, and slept in
  the novel surroundings of a native hut.</p>

  <p>How long he slept cannot be told; he was awakened by a tight hand grasping
  his throat, and a fierce voice whispering into his ear something which he
  rightly understood to be an admonition, a warning and a threat.</p>

  <p>At any rate, he interpreted it as a request on the part of his captor that
  he should remain silent, and to this Mr. Blowter in a blue funk passively
  agreed. Three men caught him and bound him deftly with native rope, a gag was
  put into his mouth, and he was dragged cautiously through a hole which the
  intruders had cut in the walls of Notiki's dwelling of honour. Outside the
  hut door was a Houssa sentry and it must be confessed that he was not awake
  at the moment of Mr. Blowter's departure.</p>

  <p>His captors spirited him by back ways to the river, dumped him into a
  canoe and paddled with frantic haste to the other shore.</p>

  <p>They grounded their canoe, pulled him&mdash;inwardly quaking&mdash;to
  land, and hurried him to the forest. On their way they met a huntsman who had
  been out overnight after a leopard, and in the dark of the dawn the chief of
  those who had captured Mr. Blowter addressed the startled man.</p>

  <p>"Go you to the city of Ochori," he said, "and say 'Mimbimi, the high chief
  who is lord of the forest of Bim-bi, sends word that he has taken the fat
  white lord to his keeping, and he shall hold him for his pleasure.'"</p><br>

  <h3>VI</h3>

  <p class="first">IT would appear from all the correspondence which was
  subsequently published that Sanders had particularly warned Mr. Blowter
  against visiting the interior, that Sir Robert, that amiable man, had also
  expressed a warning, and that the august Government itself had sent a long
  and expensive telegram from Downing Street suggesting that a trip to the
  Ochori country was inadvisable in the present state of public feeling.</p>

  <p>The hasty disposition on the part of certain Journals to blame Mr.
  Commissioner Sanders and his immediate superior for the kidnapping of so
  important a person as a Cabinet Minister was obviously founded upon an
  ignorance of the circumstances.</p>

  <p>Yet Sanders felt himself at fault, as a conscientious man always will, if
  he has had the power to prevent a certain happening.</p>

  <p>Those loyal little servants of Government, carrier pigeons&mdash;went
  fluttering east, south and north, a missionary steamer was hastily
  requisitioned, and Sanders embarked for the scene of the disappearance.</p>

  <p>Before he left he telegraphed to every likely coast town for Bosambo.</p>

  <p>"If that peregrinating devil had not left his country this would not have
  happened," said Sanders irritably; "he must come back and help me find the
  lost one."</p>

  <p>Before any answer could come to his telegrams he had embarked, and it is
  perhaps as well that he did not wait, since none of the replies were
  particularly satisfactory. Bosambo was evidently un-get-at-able, and the most
  alarming rumour of all was that which came from Sierra Leone and was to the
  effect that Bosambo had embarked for England with the expressed intention of
  seeking an interview with a very high personage indeed.</p>

  <p>Now it is the fact that had Sanders died in the execution of his duty,
  died either from fever or as the result of scientific torturing at the hands
  of Akasava braves, less than a couple of lines in the London Press would have
  paid tribute to the work he had done or the terrible manner of his
  passing.</p>

  <p>But a Cabinet Minister, captured by a cannibal tribe, offers in addition
  to alliterative possibilities in the headline department, a certain novelty
  particularly appealing to the English reader who loves above all things to
  have a shock or two with his breakfast bacon. England was shocked to its
  depths by the unusual accident which had occurred to the Right Honourable
  gentleman, partly because it is unusual for Cabinet Ministers to find
  themselves in a cannibal's hands, and partly because Mr. Blowter himself
  occupied a very large place in the eye of the public at home. For the first
  time in its history the eyes of the world were concentrated on Sanders'
  territory, and the Press of the world devoted important columns to dealing
  not only with the personality of the man who had been stolen, because they
  knew him well, but more or less inaccurately with the man who was charged
  with his recovery.</p>

  <p>They also spoke of Bosambo "now on his way to England," and it is a fact
  that a small fleet of motor-boats containing pressmen awaited the incoming
  coast mail at Plymouth only to discover that their man was not on board.</p>

  <p>Happily, Sanders was in total ignorance of the stir which the
  disappearance created. He knew, of course, that there would be talk about it,
  and had gloomy visions of long reports to be written. He would have felt
  happier in his mind if he could have identified Mimbimi with any of the
  wandering chiefs he had met or had known from time to time. Mimbimi was
  literally a devil he did not know.</p>

  <p>Nor could any of the cities or villages which had received a visitation
  give the Commissioner more definite data than he possessed. Some there were
  who said that Mimbimi was a tall man, very thin, knobbly at the knees, and
  was wounded in the foot, so that he limped. Others that he was short and very
  ugly, with a large head and small eyes, and that when he spoke it was in a
  voice of thunder.</p>

  <p>Sanders wasted no time in useless inquiries. He threw a cloud of spies and
  trackers into the forest of Bim-bi and began a scientific search; snatching a
  few hours sleep whenever the opportunity offered. But though the wings of his
  beaters touched the border line of the Ochori on the right and the Isisi on
  the left, and though he passed through places which hitherto had been
  regarded as impenetrable on account of divers devils, yet he found no trace
  of the cunning kidnapper, who, if the truth be told, had broken through the
  lines in the night, dragging an unwilling and exasperated member of the
  British Government at the end of a rope fastened about his person.</p>

  <p>Then messages began to reach Sanders, long telegrams sent up from
  headquarters by swift canoe or rewritten on paper as fine as cigarette paper
  and sent in sections attached to the legs of pigeons.</p>

  <p>They were irritating, hectoring, worrying, frantic messages. Not only from
  the Government, but from the kidnapped man's friends and relatives; for it
  seemed that this man had accumulated, in addition to a great deal of
  unnecessary information, quite a large and respectable family circle.
  Hamilton came up with a reinforcement of Houssas without achieving any
  notable result.</p>

  <p>"He has disappeared as if the ground had opened and swallowed him," said
  Sanders bitterly. "O! Mimbimi, if I could have you now," he said with
  passionate intensity.</p>

  <p>"I am sure you would be very rude to him," said Hamilton soothingly. "He
  must be somewhere, my dear chap; do you think he has killed the poor old
  bird?"</p>

  <p>Sanders shook his head.</p>

  <p>"The lord knows what he has done or what has happened to him," he
  said.</p>

  <p>It was at that moment that the messenger came. The <i>Zaire</i> was tied
  to the bank of the Upper Isisi on the edge of the forest of Bim-bi, and the
  Houssas were bivouacked on the bank, their red fires gleaming in the
  gathering darkness.</p>

  <p>The messenger came from the forest boldly; he showed no fear of Houssas,
  but walked through their lines, waving his long stick as a bandmaster will
  flourish his staff. And when the sentry on the plank that led to the boat had
  recovered from the shock of seeing the unexpected apparition, the man was
  seized and led before the Commissioner.</p>

  <p>"O, man," said Sanders, "who are you and where do you come from? Tell me
  what news you bring."</p>

  <p>"Lord," said the man glibly, "I am Mimbimi's own headman."</p>

  <p>Sanders jumped up from his chair.</p>

  <p>"Mimbimi!" he said quickly; "tell me what message you bring from that
  thief!"</p>

  <p>"Lord," said the man, "he is no thief, but a high prince."</p>

  <p>Sanders was peering at him searchingly.</p>

  <p>"It seems to me," he said, "that you are of the Ochori."</p>

  <p>"Lord, I was of the Ochori," said the messenger, "but now I am with
  Mimbimi,&mdash;his headman, following him through all manners of danger.
  Therefore I have no people or nation&mdash;wa! Lord, here is my message."</p>

  <p>Sanders nodded.</p>

  <p>"Go on," he said, "messenger of Mimbimi, and let your news be good for
  me."</p>

  <p>"Master," said the man, "I come from the great one of the forest who holds
  all lives in his two hands, and fears not anything that lives or moves,
  neither devil nor Bim-bi nor the ghosts that walk by night nor the high
  dragons in the trees&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Get to your message, my man," said Sanders, unpleasantly; "for I have a
  whip which bites sharper than the dragons in the trees and moves more swiftly
  than m'shamba."</p>

  <p>The man nodded.</p>

  <p>"Thus says Mimbimi," he resumed. "Go you to the place near the Crocodile
  River where Sandi sits, say Mimbimi the chief loves him, and because of his
  love Mimbimi will do a great thing. Also he said," the man went on, "and this
  is the greatest message of all. Before I speak further you must make a book
  of my words."</p>

  <p>Sanders frowned. It was an unusual request from a native, for his offer to
  be set down in writing. "You might take a note of this, Hamilton," he said
  aside, "though why the deuce he wants a note of this made I cannot for the
  life of me imagine. Go on, messenger," he said more mildly; "for as you see
  my lord Hamilton makes a book."</p>

  <p>"Thus says my lord Mimbimi," resumed the man, "that because of his love
  for Sandi he would give you the fat white lord whom he has taken, asking for
  no rods or salt in repayment, but doing this because of his love for Sandi
  and also because he is a just and a noble man; therefore do I deliver the fat
  one into your hands."</p>

  <p>Sanders gasped.</p>

  <p>"Do you speak the truth?" he asked incredulously.</p>

  <p>The man nodded his head.</p>

  <p>"Where is the fat lord?" asked Sanders. This was no time for ceremony or
  for polite euphemistic descriptions even of Cabinet Ministers.</p>

  <p>"Master, he is in the forest, less than the length of the village from
  here, I have tied him to a tree."</p>

  <p>Sanders raced across the plank and through the Houssa lines, dragging the
  messenger by the arm, and Hamilton, with a hastily summoned guard, followed.
  They found Joseph Blowter tied scientifically to a gum-tree, a wedge of wood
  in his mouth to prevent him speaking, and he was a terribly unhappy man.
  Hastily the bonds were loosed, and the gag removed, and the groaning Cabinet
  Minister led, half carried to the <i>Zaire</i>.</p>

  <p>He recovered sufficiently to take dinner that night, was full of his
  adventures, inclined perhaps to exaggerate his peril, pardonably exasperated
  against the man who had led him through so many dangers, real and imaginary.
  But, above all things, he was grateful to Sanders.</p>

  <p>He acknowledged that he had got into his trouble through no fault of the
  Commissioner.</p>

  <p>"I cannot tell you how sorry I am all this has occurred," said
  Sanders.</p>

  <p>It was after dinner, and Mr. Blowter in a spotless white suit
  &mdash;shaved, looking a little more healthy from his enforced exercise, and
  certainly considerably thinner, was in the mood to take an amused view of his
  experience.</p>

  <p>"One thing I have learnt, Mr. Sanders," he said, "and that is the
  extraordinary respect in which you are held in this country. I never spoke of
  you to this infernal rascal but that he bowed low, and all his followers with
  him; why, they almost worship you!"</p>

  <p>If Mr. Blowter had been surprised by this experience no less surprised was
  Sanders to learn of it.</p>

  <p>"This is news to me," he said dryly.</p>

  <p>"That is your modesty, my friend," said the Cabinet Minister with a benign
  smile. "I, at any rate, appreciate the fact that but for your popularity I
  should have had short shrift from this murderous blackguard."</p>

  <p>He went down stream the next morning, the <i>Zaire</i> overcrowded with
  Houssas.</p>

  <p>"I should have liked to have left a party in the forest," said Sanders; "I
  shall not rest until we get this thief Mimbimi by the ear."</p>

  <p>"I should not bother," said Hamilton dryly; "the sobering influence of
  your name seems to be almost as potent as my Houssas."</p>

  <p>"Please do not be sarcastic," said Sanders sharply, he was unduly
  sensitive on the question of such matters as these. Nevertheless, he was
  happy at the end of the adventure, though somewhat embarrassed by the
  telegrams of congratulation which were poured upon him not only from the
  Administrator but from England.</p>

  <p>"If I had done anything to deserve it I would not mind," he said.</p>

  <p>"That is the beauty of reward," smiled Hamilton; "if you deserve things
  you do not get them, if you do not deserve them they come in cartloads, you
  have to take the thick with the thin. Think of the telegrams which ought to
  have come and did not."</p>

  <p>They took farewell of Mr. Blowter on the beach, the surf-boat waiting to
  carry him to a mail steamer decorated for the occasion with strings of
  flags.</p>

  <p>"There is one question which I would like to ask you," said Sanders, "and
  it is one which for some reason I have forgotten to ask before&mdash;can you
  describe Mimbimi to me so that I may locate him? He is quite unknown to
  us."</p>

  <p>Mr. Blowter frowned thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"He is difficult to describe! all natives are alike to me," he said
  slowly. "He is rather tall, well-made, good-looking for a native, and
  talkative."</p>

  <p>"Talkative!" said Sanders quickly.</p>

  <p>"In a way; he can speak a little English," said the Cabinet Minister, "and
  evidently has some sort of religious training, because he spoke of Mark, and
  Luke, and the various Apostles as one who had studied possibly at a
  missionary school."</p>

  <p>"Mark and Luke," almost whispered Sanders, a great light dawning upon him.
  "Thank you very much. I think you said he always bowed when my name was
  mentioned?"</p>

  <p>"Invariably," smiled the Cabinet Minister.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, sir." Sanders shook hands.</p>

  <p>"O! by the way, Mr. Sanders," said Blowter, turning back from the boat, "I
  suppose you know that you have been gazetted C.M.G.?"</p>

  <p>Sanders flushed red and stammered "C.M.G."</p>

  <p>"It is an indifferent honour for one who has rendered such service to the
  country as you," said the complacent Mr. Blowter profoundly; "but the
  Government feel that it is the least they can do for you after your unusual
  effort on my behalf and they have asked me to say to you that they will not
  be unmindful of your future."</p>

  <p>He left Sanders standing as though frozen to the spot.</p>

  <p>Hamilton was the first to congratulate him.</p>

  <p>"My dear chap, if ever a man deserved the C.M.G. it is you," he said.</p>

  <p>It would be absurd to say that Sanders was not pleased. He was certainly
  not pleased at the method by which it came, but he should have known, being
  acquainted with the ways of Governments, that this was the reward of
  cumulative merit. He walked back in silence to the Residency, Hamilton
  keeping pace by his side.</p>

  <p>"By the way, Sanders," he said, "I have just had a pigeon-post from the
  river&mdash;Bosambo is back in the Ochori country. Have you any idea how he
  arrived there?"</p>

  <p>"I think I have," said Sanders, with a grim little smile, "and I think I
  shall be calling on Bosambo very soon."</p>

  <p>But that was a threat he was never destined to put into execution. That
  same evening came a wire from Bob.</p>

  <p>"Your leave is granted: Hamilton is to act as Commissioner in your
  temporary absence. I am sending Lieutenant Francis Augustus Tibbetts to take
  charge of Houssas."</p>

  <p>"And who the devil is Francis Augustus Tibbetts?" said Sanders and
  Hamilton with one voice.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap02"
     id="chap02">II. &mdash; HAMILTON OF THE HOUSSAS</a></h2>

  <h3>First published as "The Advent of Bones" in <i>The Weekly
  Tale-Teller</i>, 17 Oct 1914</h3>

  <p class="first">SANDERS turned to the rail and cast a wistful glance at the
  low-lying shore. He saw one corner of the white Residency, showing through
  the sparse <i>isisi</i> palm at the end of the big garden&mdash;a smudge of
  green on yellow from this distance.</p>

  <p>"I hate going&mdash;even for six months," he said.</p>

  <p>Hamilton of the Houssas, with laughter in his blue eyes, and his fumed-oak
  face&mdash;lean and wholesome it was&mdash;all a-twitch, whistled with
  difficulty.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, I shall come back again," said Sanders, answering the question
  in the tune. "I hope things will go well in my absence."</p>

  <p>"How can they go well?" asked Hamilton, gently. "How can the Isisi live,
  or the Akasava sow his barbarous potatoes, or the sun shine, or the river run
  when Sandi Sitani is no longer in the land?"</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't have worried," Sanders went on, ignoring the insult, "if
  they'd put a good man in charge; but to give a pudden-headed
  soldier&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We thank you!" bowed Hamilton.</p>

  <p>"&mdash;&mdash;with little or no experience&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"An insolent lie&mdash;and scarcely removed from an unqualified lie!"
  murmured Hamilton.</p>

  <p>"To put him in my place!" apostrophized Sanders, tilting back his helmet
  the better to appeal to the heavens.</p>

  <p>"'Orrible! 'Orrible!" said Hamilton; "and now I seem to catch the accusing
  eye of the chief officer, which means that he wants me to hop. God bless you,
  old man!"</p>

  <p>His sinewy paw caught the other's in a grip that left both hands numb at
  the finish.</p>

  <p>"Keep well," said Sanders in a low voice, his hand on Hamilton's back, as
  they walked to the gangway. "Watch the Isisi and sit on Bosambo
  &mdash;especially Bosambo, for he is a mighty slippery devil."</p>

  <p>"Leave me to deal with Bosambo," said Hamilton firmly, as he skipped down
  the companion to the big boat that rolled and tumbled under the coarse skin
  of the ship.</p>

  <p>"I <i>am</i> leaving you," said Sanders, with a chuckle.</p>

  <p>He watched the Houssa pick a finnicking way to the stern of the boat; saw
  the solemn faces of his rowmen as they bent their naked backs, gripping their
  clumsy oars. And to think that they and Hamilton were going back to the
  familiar life, to the dear full days he knew! Sanders coughed and swore at
  himself.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Sandi!" called the headman of the boat, as she went lumbering over
  the clear green swell, "remember us, your servants!"</p>

  <p>"I will remember, man," said Sanders, a-choke, and turned quickly to his
  cabin.</p>

  <p>Hamilton sat in the stern of the surf-boat, humming a song to himself; but
  he felt awfully solemn, though in his pocket reposed a commission sealed
  redly and largely on parchment and addressed to: "Our well-beloved Patrick
  George Hamilton, Lieutenant, of our 133rd 1st Royal Hertford Regiment.
  Seconded for service in our 9th Regiment of Houssas&mdash;Greeting...."</p>

  <p>"Master," said his Kroo servant, who waited his landing, "you lib for dem
  big house?"</p>

  <p>"I lib," said Hamilton.</p>

  <p>"Dem big house," was the Residency, in which a temporarily appointed
  Commissioner must take up his habitation, if he is to preserve the dignity of
  his office.</p>

  <p>"Let us pray!" said Hamilton earnestly, addressing himself to a small
  snapshot photograph of Sanders, which stood on a side table. "Let us pray
  that the barbarian of his kindness will sit quietly till you return, my
  Sanders&mdash;for the Lord knows what trouble I'm going to get into before
  you return!"</p>

  <p>The incoming mail brought Francis Augustus Tibbetts, Lieutenant of the
  Houssas, raw to the land, but as cheerful as the devil&mdash;a straight stick
  of a youth, with hair brushed back from his forehead, a sun-peeled nose, a
  wonderful collection of baggage, and all the gossip of London.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid you'll find I'm rather an ass, sir," he said, saluting
  stiffly. "I've only just arrived on the Coast an' I'm simply bubbling over
  with energy, but I'm rather short in the brain department."</p>

  <p>Hamilton, glaring at his subordinate through his monocle, grinned
  sympathetically.</p>

  <p>"I'm not a whale of erudition myself," he confessed. "What is your name,
  sir?"</p>

  <p>"Francis Augustus Tibbetts, sir."</p>

  <p>"I shall call you Bones," said Hamilton, decisively.</p>

  <p>Lieut. Tibbetts saluted. "They called me Conk at Sandhurst, sir," he
  suggested.</p>

  <p>"Bones!" said Hamilton, definitely.</p>

  <p>"Bones it is, skipper," said Mr. Tibbetts; "an' now all this beastly
  formality is over we'll have a bottle to celebrate things." And a bottle they
  had.</p>

  <p>It was a splendid evening they spent, dining on chicken and palm-oil chop,
  rice pudding and sweet potatoes. Hamilton sang, "Who wouldn't be a soldier in
  the Army?" and&mdash;by request&mdash;in his shaky falsetto baritone, "My
  heart is in the Highlands"; and Lieut. Tibbetts gave a lifelike imitation of
  Frank Tinney, which convulsed, not alone his superior officer, but some
  two-and-forty men of the Houssas who were unauthorized spectators through
  various windows and door cracks and ventilating gauzes.</p>

  <p>Bones was the son of a man who had occupied a position of some importance
  on the Coast, and though the young man's upbringing had been in England, he
  had the inestimable advantage of a very thorough grounding in the native
  dialect, not only from Tibbetts, senior, but from the two native servants
  with whom the boy had grown up.</p>

  <p>"I suppose there is a telegraph line to headquarters?" asked Bones that
  night before they parted.</p>

  <p>"Certainly, my dear lad," replied Hamilton. "We had it laid down when we
  heard you were coming."</p>

  <p>"Don't flither!" pleaded Bones, giggling convulsively; "but the fact is
  I've got a couple of dozen tickets in the Cambridgeshire Sweepstake, an' a
  dear pal of mine&mdash;chap named Goldfinder, a rare and delicate
  bird&mdash;has sworn to wire me if I've drawn a horse. D'ye think I'll draw a
  horse?"</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't think you could draw a cow," said Hamilton. "Go to bed."</p>

  <p>"Look here, Ham&mdash;" began Lieut. Bones.</p>

  <p>"To bed! you insubordinate devil!" said Hamilton, sternly.</p>

  <p>In the meantime there was trouble in the Akasava country.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">SCARCELY had Sanders left the land, when the <i>lokali</i>
  of the Lower Isisi sent the news thundering in waves of sound.</p>

  <p>Up and down the river and from village to village, from town to town,
  across rivers, penetrating dimly to the quiet deeps of the forest the story
  was flung. N'gori, the Chief of the Akasava, having some grievance against
  the Government over a question of fine for failure to collect according to
  the law, waited for no more than this intelligence of Sandi's going. His
  swift loud drums called his people to a dance-of-many-days. A
  dance-of-many-days spells "spears" and spears spell trouble. Bosambo heard
  the message in the still of the early night, gathered five hundred fighting
  men, swept down on the Akasava city in the drunken dawn, and carried away two
  thousand spears of the sodden N'gori.</p>

  <p>A sobered Akasava city woke up and rubbed its eyes to find strange Ochori
  sentinels in the street and Bosambo in a sky-blue table-cloth, edged with
  golden fringe, stalking majestically through the high places of the city.</p>

  <p>"This I do," said Bosambo to a shocked N'gori, "because my lord Sandi
  placed me here to hold the king's peace."</p>

  <p>"Lord Bosambo," said the king sullenly, "what peace do I break when I
  summon my young men and maidens to dance?"</p>

  <p>"Your young men are thieves, and it is written that the maidens of the
  Akasava are married once in ten thousand moons," said Bosambo calmly; "and
  also, N'gori, you speak to a wise man who knows that clockety-clock-clock on
  a drum spells war."</p>

  <p>There was a long and embarrassing silence.</p>

  <p>"Now, Bosambo," said N'gori, after a while, "you have my spears and your
  young men hold the streets and the river. What will you do? Do you sit here
  till Sandi returns and there is law in the land?"</p>

  <p>This was the one question which Bosambo had neither the desire nor the
  ability to answer. He might swoop down upon a warlike people, surprising them
  to their abashment, rendering their armed forces impotent, but exactly what
  would happen afterwards he had not foreseen.</p>

  <p>"I go back to my city," he said.</p>

  <p>"And my spears?"</p>

  <p>"Also they go with me," said Bosambo.</p>

  <p>They eyed each other: Bosambo straight and muscular, a perfect figure of a
  man, N'gori grizzled and skinny, his brow furrowed with age.</p>

  <p>"Lord," said N'gori mildly, "if you take my spears you leave me bound to
  my enemies. How may I protect my villages against oppression by evil men of
  Isisi?"</p>

  <p>Bosambo sniffed&mdash;a sure sign of mental perturbation. All that N'gori
  said was true. Yet if he left the spears there would be trouble for him. Then
  a bright thought flicked:</p>

  <p>"If bad men come you shall send for me and I will bring my fine young
  soldiers. The palaver is finished."</p>

  <p>With this course N'gori must feign agreement. He watched the departing
  army&mdash;paddlers sitting on swathes of filched spears. Once Bosambo was
  out of sight, N'gori collected all the convertible property of his city and
  sent it in ten canoes to the edge of the N'gombi country, for N'gombi folk
  are wonderful makers of spears and have a saleable stock hidden against
  emergency.</p>

  <p>For the space of a month there was enacted a comedy of which Hamilton was
  ignorant. Three days after Bosambo had returned in triumph to his city, there
  came a frantic call for succour&mdash;a rolling, terrified rat-a-plan of
  sound which the <i>lokali</i> man of the Ochori village read.</p>

  <p>"Lord," said he, waking Bosambo in the dead of night, "there has come down
  a signal from the Akasava, who are pressed by their enemies and have no
  spears."</p>

  <p>Bosambo was in the dark street instanter, his booming war-drum calling
  urgently. Twenty canoes filled with fighting men, paddling desperately with
  the stream, raced to the aid of the defenceless Akasava.</p>

  <p>At dawn, on the beach of the city, N'gori met his ally. "I thank all my
  little gods you have come, my lord," said he, humbly; "for in the night one
  of my young men saw an Isisi army coming against us."</p>

  <p>"Where is the army?" demanded a weary Bosambo.</p>

  <p>"Lord, it has not come," said N'gori, glibly; "for hearing of your
  lordship and your swift canoes, I think it had run away."</p>

  <p>Bosambo's force paddled back to the Ochori city the next day. Two nights
  after, the call was repeated&mdash;this time with greater detail. An N'gombi
  force of countless spears had seized the village of Doozani and was
  threatening the capital.</p>

  <p>Again Bosambo carried his spears to a killing, and again was met by an
  apologetic N'gori.</p>

  <p>"Lord, it was a lie which a sick maiden spread," he explained, "and my
  stomach is filled with sorrow that I should have brought the mighty Bosambo
  from his wife's bed on such a night." For the dark hours had been filled with
  rain and tempest, and Bosambo had nearly lost one canoe by wreck.</p>

  <p>"Oh, fool!" said he, justly exasperated, "have I nothing to do&mdash;I,
  who have all Sandi's high and splendid business in hand&mdash;but I must come
  through the rain because a sick maiden sees visions?"</p>

  <p>"Bosambo, I am a fool," agreed N'gori, meekly, and again his rescuer
  returned home.</p>

  <p>"Now," said N'gori, "we will summon a secret palaver, sending messengers
  for all men to assemble at the rise of the first moon. For the N'gombi have
  sent me new spears, and when next the dog Bosambo comes, weary with rowing,
  we will fall upon him and there will be no more Bosambo left; for Sandi is
  gone and there is no law in the land."</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">CURIOUSLY enough, at that precise moment, the question of
  law was a very pressing one with two young Houssa officers who sat on either
  side of Sanders' big table, wet towels about their heads, mastering the
  intricacies of the military code; for Tibbetts was entering for an
  examination and Hamilton, who had only passed his own by a fluke, had rashly
  offered to coach him.</p>

  <p>"I hope you understand this, Bones," said Hamilton, staring up at his
  subordinate and running his finger along the closely printed pages of the
  book before him.</p>

  <p>"'Any person subject to military law,'" read Hamilton impressively, "'who
  strikes or ill-uses his superior officer shall, if an officer, suffer death
  or such less punishment as in this Act mentioned.' Which means," said
  Hamilton, wisely, "that if you and I are in action and you call me a liar,
  and I give you a whack on the jaw&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You get shot," said Bones, admiringly, "an' a rippin' good idea,
  too!"</p>

  <p>"If, on the other hand," Hamilton went on, "I called you a liar
  &mdash;which I should be justified in doing&mdash;and you give me a whack on
  the jaw, I'd make you sorry you were ever born."</p>

  <p>"That's military law, is it?" asked Bones, curiously.</p>

  <p>"It is," said Hamilton.</p>

  <p>"Then let's chuck it," said Bones, and shut up his book with a bang. "I
  don't want any book to teach me what to do with a feller that calls me a
  liar. I'll go you one game of picquet, for nuts."</p>

  <p>"You're on," said Hamilton.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"My nuts I think, sir."</p>

  <p>Bones carefully counted the heap which his superior had pushed over,
  "And&mdash;hullo! what the dooce do you want?"</p>

  <p>Hamilton followed the direction of the other's eyes. A man stood in the
  doorway, naked but for the wisp of skirt at his waist. Hamilton got up
  quickly, for he recognized the chief of Sandi's spies.</p>

  <p>"O Kelili," said Hamilton in his easy Bomongo tongue, "why do you come and
  from whence?"</p>

  <p>"From the island over against the Ochori, Lord," croaked the man,
  dry-throated. "Two pigeons I sent, but these the hawks took&mdash;a fisherman
  saw one taken by the Kasai, and my own brother, who lives in the Village of
  Irons, saw the other go&mdash;though he flew swiftly."</p>

  <p>Hamilton's grave face set rigidly, for he smelt trouble. You do not send
  pleasant news by pigeons.</p>

  <p>"Speak," he said.</p>

  <p>"Lord," said Kelili, "there is to be a killing palaver between the Ochori
  and the Akasava on the first rise of the full moon, for N'gori speaks of
  Bosambo evilly, and says that the Chief has raided him. In what manner these
  things will come about," Kelili went on, with the lofty indifference of one
  who had done his part of the business, so that he had left no room for
  carelessness, "I do not know, but I have warned all eyes of the Government to
  watch."</p>

  <p>Bones followed the conversation without difficulty.</p>

  <p>"What do people say?" asked Hamilton.</p>

  <p>"Lord, they say that Sandi has gone and there is no law."</p>

  <p>Hamilton of the Houssas grinned. "Oh, ain't there?" said he, in English,
  vilely.</p>

  <p>"Ain't there?" repeated an indignant Bones, "we'll jolly well show old
  Thinggumy what's what."</p>

  <p>Bosambo received an envoy from the Chief of the Akasava, and the envoy
  brought with him presents of dubious value and a message to the effect that
  N'gori spent much of his waking moments in wondering how he might best serve
  his brother Bosambo, "The right arm on which I and my people lean and the
  bright eyes through which I see beauty."</p>

  <p>Bosambo returned the messenger, with presents more valueless, and an
  assurance of friendship more sonorous, more complete in rhetoric and aptness
  of hyperbole, and when the messenger had gone Bosambo showed his appreciation
  of N'gori's love by doubling the guard about the Ochori city and sending a
  strong picket under his chief headman to hold the river bend.</p>

  <p>"Because," said this admirable philosopher, "life is like certain roots:
  some that taste sweet and are bitter in the end, and some that are vile to
  the lips and pleasant to the stomach."</p>

  <p>It was a wild night, being in the month of rains. M'shimba M'shamba was
  abroad, walking with his devastating feet through the forest, plucking up
  great trees by their roots and tossing them aside as though they were so many
  canes. There was a roaring of winds and a crashing of thunders, and the
  blue-white lightning snicked in and out of the forest or tore sprawling
  cracks in the sky. In the Ochori city they heard the storm grumbling across
  the river and were awakened by the incessant lightning&mdash;so incessant
  that the weaver birds who lived in palms that fringed the Ochori streets came
  chattering to life.</p>

  <p>It was too loud a noise, that M'shimba M'shamba made for the <i>lokali</i>
  man of the Ochori to hear the message that N'gori sent &mdash;the
  panic-message designed to lure Bosambo to the newly-purchased spears.</p>

  <p>Bones heard it&mdash;Bones, standing on the bridge of the <i>Zaire</i>
  pounding away upstream, steaming past the Akasava city in a sheet of
  rain.</p>

  <p>"Wonder what the jolly old row is?" he muttered to himself, and summoned
  his sergeant. "Ali," said he, in faultless Arabic, "what beating of drums are
  these?"</p>

  <p>"Lord," said the sergeant, uneasily, "I do not know, unless they be to
  warn us not to travel at night. I am your man, Master," said he in a fret,
  "yet never have I travelled with so great a fear: even our Lord Sandi does
  not move by night, though the river is his own child."</p>

  <p>"It is written," said Bones, cheerfully, and as the sergeant saluted and
  turned away, the reckless Houssa made a face at the darkness. "If old man Ham
  would give me a month or two on the river," he mused, "I'd set 'em alight, by
  Jove!"</p>

  <p>By the miraculous interposition of Providence Bones reached the Ochori
  village in the grey clouded dawn, and Bosambo, early astir, met the lank
  figure of the youth, his slick sword dangling, his long revolver holster
  strapped to his side, and his helmet on the back of his head, an eager
  warrior looking for trouble.</p>

  <p>"Lord, of you I have heard," said Bosambo, politely; "here in the Ochori
  country we talk of no other thing than the new, thin Lord whose beautiful
  nose is like the red flowers of the forest."</p>

  <p>"Leave my nose alone," said Bones, unpleasantly, "and tell me, Chief, what
  killing palaver is this I hear? I come from Government to right all
  wrongs&mdash;this is evidently his nibs, Bosambo." The last passage was in
  his own native tongue and Bosambo beamed.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sah!" said he in the English of the Coast. "I be Bosambo, good chap,
  fine chap; you, sah, you look um&mdash;you see um&mdash;Bosambo!"</p>

  <p>He slapped his chest and Bones unbent.</p>

  <p>"Look here, old sport," he said affably: "what the dooce is all this
  shindy about&mdash;hey?"</p>

  <p>"No shindy, sah!" said Bosambo&mdash;being sure that all people of his
  city were standing about at a respectful distance, awe-stricken by the sight
  of their chief on equal terms with this new white lord.</p>

  <p>"Dem feller he lib for Akasava, sah&mdash;he be bad feller: I be good
  feller, sah&mdash;C'istian, sah! Matt'ew, Marki, Luki, Johni&mdash;I savvy
  dem fine."</p>

  <p>Happily, Bones continued the conversation in the tongue of the land. Then
  he learned of the dance which Bosambo had frustrated, of the spears taken,
  and these he saw stacked in three huts.</p>

  <p>Bones, despite the character he gave himself, was no fool, and, moreover,
  he had the advantage of knowing of the new N'gombi spears that were going out
  to the Akasava day by day; and when Bosambo told of the midnight summons that
  had come to him, Bones did the rapid exercise of mental figuring which is
  known as putting two and two together.</p>

  <p>He wagged his head when Bosambo had finished his recital, did this general
  of twenty-one. "You're a jolly old sportsman, Bosambo," he said very
  seriously, "and you're in the dooce of a hole, if you only knew it. But you
  trust old Bones&mdash;he'll see you through. By Gad!"</p>

  <p>Bosambo, bewildered but resourceful, hearing, without understanding,
  replied: "I be fine feller, sah!"</p>

  <p>"You bet your life you are, old funnyface," agreed Bones, and screwed his
  eyeglass in the better to survey his protege.</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p class="first">CHIEF N'GORI organized a surprise party for Bosambo, and
  took so much trouble with the details, that, because of his sheer
  thoroughness, he deserved to have succeeded. <i>Lokali</i> men concealed in
  the bush were waiting to announce the coming of the rescue party, when N'gori
  sent his cry for help crashing across the world. Six hundred spearmen stood
  ready to embark in fifty canoes, and five hundred more waited on either bank
  ready to settle with any survivors of the Ochori who found their way to
  land.</p>

  <p>The best of plans are subject to the banal reservation, "weather
  permitting," and the signal intended to bring Bosambo to his destruction was
  swallowed up in the bellowings of the storm.</p>

  <p>"This night being fine," said N'gori, showing his teeth, "Bosambo will
  surely come."</p>

  <p>His Chief Counsellor, an ancient man of the royal tribe,[2] had unexpected
  warnings to offer. A man had seen a man, who had caught a glimpse of the
  <i>Zaire</i> butting her way upstream in the dead of night. Was it wise, when
  the devil Sandi waited to smite, and so close at hand, to engage in so high
  an adventure?</p>

  <p>[Footnote 2: That which I call the Akasava proper is the very small,
  dominant clan of a tribe which is loosely called "Akasava," but is really
  Bowongo.]</p>

  <p>"Old man, there is a hut in the forest for you," said N'gori, with
  significance, and the Counsellor wilted, because the huts in the forest are
  for the sick, the old, and the mad, and here they are left to starve and die;
  "for," N'gori went on, "all men know that Sandi has gone to his people across
  the black waters, and the M'ilitani rules. Also, in nights of storms there
  are men who see even devils."</p>

  <p>With more than ordinary care he prepared for the final settling with
  Bosambo the Robber, and there is a suggestion that he was encouraged by the
  chiefs of other lands, who had grown jealous of the Ochori and their
  offensive rectitude. Be that as it may, all things were made ready, even to
  the knives of sacrifice and the young saplings which had not been employed by
  the Akasava for their grisly work since the Year of Hangings.</p>

  <p>At an hour before midnight the tireless <i>lokali</i> sent out its
  call:</p>

  <p>"We of the Akasava" (four long rolls and a quick succession of taps)</p>

  <p>"Danger threatens" (a long roll, a short roll, and a triple tap-tap)</p>

  <p>"Isisi fighting" (rolls punctuated by shorter tattoos)</p>

  <p>"Come to me" (a long crescendo roll and patter of taps)</p>

  <p>"Ochori" (nine rolls, curiously like the yelping of a dog)</p>

  <p>So the message went out: every village heard and repeated. The Isisi threw
  the call northward; the N'gombi village, sent it westward, and presently
  first the Isisi, then the N'gombi, heard the faint answer: "Coming&mdash;the
  Breaker of Lives," and returned the message to N'gori.</p>

  <p>"Now I shall also break lives," said N'gori, and sacrificed a goat to his
  success.</p>

  <p>Sixteen hundred fighting men waited for the signal from the hidden
  <i>lokali</i> player, on the far side of the river bend. At the first hollow
  rattle of his sticks, N'gori pushed off in his royal canoe.</p>

  <p>"Kill!" he roared, and went out in the white light of dawn to greet ten
  Ochori canoes, riding in fanshape formation, having as their centre a white
  and speckless <i>Zaire</i> alive with Houssas and overburdened with the slim
  muzzles of Hotchkiss guns.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Ko!" said N'gori dismally, "this is a bad palaver!"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">In the centre of his city, before a reproving squad of
  Houssas, a dumb man, taken in the act of armed aggression, N'gori stood.</p>

  <p>"You're a naughty boy," said Bones, reproachfully, "and if jolly old
  Sanders were here&mdash;my word, you'd catch it!"</p>

  <p>N'gori listened to the unknown tongue, worried by its mystery. "Lord, what
  happens to me?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Bones looked very profound and scratched his head. He looked at the Chief,
  at Bosambo, at the river all aglow in the early morning sunlight, at the
  <i>Zaire</i>, with her sinister guns a-glitter, and then back at the Chief.
  He was not well versed in the dialect of the Akasava, and Bosambo must be his
  interpreter.</p>

  <p>"Very serious offence, old friend," said Bones, solemnly; "awfully
  serious&mdash;muckin' about with spears and all that sort of thing. I'll have
  to make a dooce of an example of you&mdash;yes, by Heaven!"</p>

  <p>Bosambo heard and imperfectly understood. He looked about for a likely
  tree where an unruly chief might sway with advantage to the community.</p>

  <p>"You're a bad, bad boy," said Bones, shaking his head; "tell him."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sah!" said Bosambo.</p>

  <p>"Tell him he's fined ten dollars."</p>

  <p>But Bosambo did not speak: there are moments too full for words and this
  was one of them.</p>

  <h2><a name="chap03"
     id="chap03">III. &mdash; THE DISCIPLINARIANS</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Weekly Tale-Teller</i>, 24 Oct 1914</h3>

  <p class="first">LIEUTENANT AUGUSTUS TIBBETTS of the Houssas stood at
  attention before his chief. He stood as straight as a ramrod, his hands to
  his sides, his eyeglass jammed in his eye, and Hamilton of the Houssas looked
  at him sorrowfully.</p>

  <p>"Bones, you're an ass!" he said at last.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said Bones.</p>

  <p>"I sent you to Ochori to prevent a massacre, you catch a chief in the act
  of ambushing an enemy and instead of chucking him straight into the Village
  of Iron you fine him ten dollars."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said Bones.</p>

  <p>There was a painful pause.</p>

  <p>"Well, you're an ass!" said Hamilton, who could think of nothing better to
  say.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said Bones; "I think you're repeating yourself, sir. I seem to
  have heard a similar observation before."</p>

  <p>"You've made Bosambo and the whole of the Ochori as sick as monkeys, and
  you've made me look a fool."</p>

  <p>"Hardly my responsibility, sir," said Bones, gently.</p>

  <p>"I hardly know what to do with you," said Hamilton, drawing his pipe from
  his pocket and slowly charging it. "Naturally, Bones, I can never let you
  loose again on the country." He lit his pipe and puffed thoughtfully. "And of
  course&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Pardon me, sir," said Bones, still uncomfortably erect, "this is intended
  to be a sort of official inquiry an' all that sort of thing, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"It is," said Hamilton.</p>

  <p>"Well, sir," said Bones, "may I ask you not to smoke? When a chap's honour
  an' reputation an' all that sort of thing is being weighed in the balance,
  sir, believe me, smokin' isn't decent&mdash;it isn't really, sir."</p>

  <p>Hamilton looked round for something to throw at his critic and found a
  tolerably heavy book, but Bones dodged and fielded it dexterously. "And if
  you must chuck things at me, sir," he added, as he examined the title on the
  back of the missile, "will you avoid as far as possible usin' the sacred
  volumes of the Army List? It hurts me to tell you this, sir, but I've been
  well brought up."</p>

  <p>"What's the time?" asked Hamilton, and his second-in-command examined his
  watch.</p>

  <p>"Ten to tiffin," he said. "Good Lord, we've been gassin' an hour. Any news
  from Sanders?"</p>

  <p>"He's in town&mdash;that's all I know&mdash;but don't change the serious
  subject, Bones. Everybody is awfully disgusted with you&mdash;Sanders would
  have at least brought him to trial."</p>

  <p>"I couldn't do it, sir," said Bones, firmly. "Poor old bird! He looked
  such an ass, an' moreover reminded me so powerfully of an aunt of mine that I
  simply couldn't do it."</p>

  <p>No doubt but that Lieut. Francis Augustus Tibbetts of the Houssas, with
  his sun-burnt nose, his large saucer eyes, and his air of solemn innocence,
  had shaken the faith of the impressionable folk. This much Hamilton was to
  learn: for Tibbetts had been sent with a party of Houssas to squash
  effectively an incipient rebellion in the Akasava, and having caught N'gori
  in the very act of most treacherously and most damnably preparing an ambush
  for a virtuous Bosambo, Chief of the Ochori, had done no more than fine him
  ten dollars.</p>

  <p>And this was in a land where even the Spanish dollar had never been seen
  save by Bosambo, who was reported to have more than his share of silver in a
  deep hole beneath the floor of his hut.</p>

  <p>Small wonder that Captain Hamilton held an informal court-martial of one,
  the closing stages of which I have described, and sentenced his wholly
  inefficient subordinate to seven days' field exercise in the forest with half
  a company of Houssas.</p>

  <p>"Oh, dash it, you don't mean that?" asked Bones in dismay when the finding
  of the court was conveyed to him at lunch.</p>

  <p>"I do," said Hamilton firmly. "I'd be failing in my job of work if I
  didn't make you realize what a perfect ass you are."</p>

  <p>"Perfect&mdash;yes," protested Bones, "ass&mdash;no. Fact is, dear old
  fellow, I've a temperament. You aren't going to make me go about in that
  beastly forest diggin' rifle pits an' pitchin' tents an' all that sort of
  dam' nonsense; it's too grisly to think about."</p>

  <p>"None the less," said Hamilton, "you will do it whilst I go north to sit
  on the heads of all who endeavour to profit by your misguided leniency. I
  shall be back in time for the Administration Inspection&mdash;don't for the
  love of heaven forget that His Excellency&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Bless his jolly old heart!" murmured Bones.</p>

  <p>"That His Excellency is paying his annual visit on the twenty-first."</p>

  <p>A ray of hope shot through the gloom of Lieut. Tibbetts' mind.</p>

  <p>"Under the circumstances, dear old friend, don't you think it would be
  best to chuck that silly idea of field training? What about sticking up a
  board and gettin' the chaps to paint, 'Welcome to the United Territories,' or
  'God bless our Home,' or something."</p>

  <p>Hamilton withered him with a glance.</p>

  <p>His last words, shouted from the bridge of the <i>Zaire</i> as her stern
  wheel went threshing ahead, were, "Remember, Bones! No shirking!"</p>

  <p><i>"Honi soit qui mal y pense!"</i> roared Bones.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">HAMILTON had evidence enough of the effect which the
  leniency of his subordinate had produced. News travels fast, and the Akasava
  are great talkers. Hamilton, coming to the Isisi city on his way up the
  river, found a crowd on the beach to watch his mooring, their arms folded
  hugging their sides&mdash;sure gesture of indifferent idleness&mdash;but
  neither the paramount chief, nor his son, nor any of his counsellors awaited
  the steamer to pay their respects.</p>

  <p>Hamilton sent for them and still they did not come, sending a message that
  they were sick. So Hamilton went striding through the street of the city, his
  long sword flapping at his side, four Houssas padding swiftly in his rear at
  their curious jog-trot. B'sano, the young chief of the Isisi, came out lazily
  from his hut and stood with outstretched feet and arms akimbo watching the
  nearing Houssa, and he had no fear, for it was said that now Sandi was away
  from the country no man had the authority to punish.</p>

  <p>And the counsellors behind B'sano had their bunched spears and their
  wicker-work shields, contrary to all custom&mdash;as Sanders had framed the
  custom.</p>

  <p>"O chief," said Hamilton, with that ready smile of his, "I waited for you
  and you did not come."</p>

  <p>"Soldier," said B'sano, insolently, "I am the king of these people and
  answerable to none save my lord Sandi, who, as you know, is gone from
  us."</p>

  <p>"That I know," said the patient Houssa, "and because it is in my heart to
  show all people what manner of law Sandi has left behind, I fine you and your
  city ten thousand <i>matakos</i> that you shall remember that the law lives,
  though Sandi is in the moon, though all rulers change and die."</p>

  <p>A slow gleam of contempt came to the chief's eyes.</p>

  <p>"Soldier," said he, "I do not pay <i>matako-wa</i>!"</p>

  <p>He stumbled back, his mouth agape with fear. The long barrel of Hamilton's
  revolver rested coldly on his bare stomach.</p>

  <p>"We will have a fire," said Hamilton, and spoke to his sergeant in Arabic.
  "Here in the centre of the city we will make a fire of proud shields and
  unlawful spears."</p>

  <p>One by one the counsellors dropped their wicker shields upon the fire
  which the Houssa sergeant had kindled, and as they dropped them, the sergeant
  scientifically handcuffed the advisers of the Isisi chief in couples.</p>

  <p>"You shall find other counsellors, B'sano," said Hamilton, as the men were
  led to the <i>Zaire</i>. "See that I do not come bringing with me a new
  chief."</p>

  <p>"Lord," said the chief humbly, "I am your dog."</p>

  <p>Not alone was B'sano at fault. Up and down the road old grievances awaited
  settlement: there were scores to adjust, misunderstandings to remove. Mostly
  these misunderstandings had to do with important questions of tribal
  superiority and might only be definitely tested by sanguinary combat.</p>

  <p>Also picture a secret order, ruthlessly suppressed by Sanders, and
  practised by trembling men, each afraid of the other despite their oaths; and
  the fillip it received when the news went forth&mdash;"Sandi has
  gone&mdash;there is no law."</p>

  <p>This was a fine time for the dreamers of dreams and for the men who saw
  portends and understood the wisdom of Ju-jus.</p>

  <p>Bemebibi, chief of the Lesser Isisi, was too fat a man for a dreamer, for
  visions run with countable ribs and a cough. Nor was he tall nor commanding
  by any standard. He had broad shoulders and a short neck. His head was round,
  and his eyes were cunning and small. He was an irritable man, had a trick of
  beating his counsellors when they displeased him, and was a ready destroyer
  of men.</p>

  <p>Some say that he practised sacrifice in the forests, he and the members of
  his society, but none spoke with any certainty or authority, for Bemebibi was
  chief, alike of a community and an order. In the Lesser Isisi alone, the
  White Ghosts had flourished in spite of every effort of the Administration to
  stamp them out.</p>

  <p>It was a society into which the hazardous youth of the Isisi were
  initiated joyfully, for there is little difference in the temperament of
  youth, whether it wears a cloth about its loins or lavender spats upon its
  feet.</p>

  <p>Thus it came about that one-half of the adult male population of the
  Lesser Isisi, had sworn by the letting of blood and the rubbing of salt:</p>

  <p>(1) To hop upon one foot for a spear's length every night and morning.</p>

  <p>(2) To love all ghosts and speak gently of devils.</p>

  <p>(3) To be dumb and blind and to throw spears swiftly for the love of the
  White Ghosts.</p>

  <p>One night Bemebibi went into the forest with six highmen of his order.
  They came to a secret place at a pool, and squatted in a circle, each man
  laying his hands on the soles of his feet in the prescribed fashion.</p>

  <p>"Snakes live in holes," said Bemebibi conventionally. "Ghosts dwell by
  water and all devils sit in the bodies of little birds."</p>

  <p>This they repeated after him, moving their heads from side to side
  slowly.</p>

  <p>"This is a good night," said the chief, when the ritual was ended, "for
  now I see the end of our great thoughts. Sandi is gone and M'ilitini is by
  the place where the three rivers meet, and he has come in fear. Also by magic
  I have learnt that he is terrified because he knows me to be an awful man.
  Now, I think, it is time for all ghosts to strike swiftly."</p>

  <p>He spoke with emotion, swaying his body from side to side after the manner
  of orators. His voice grew thick and husky as the immensity of his design
  grew upon him.</p>

  <p>"There is no law in the land," he sang. "Sandi has gone, and only a
  little, thin man punishes in fear. M'ilitini has blood like water&mdash;let
  us sacrifice."</p>

  <p>One of his highmen disappeared into the dark forest and came back soon,
  dragging a half-witted youth, named Ko'so, grinning and mumbling and content
  till the curved N'gombi knife, that his captor wielded, came "snack" to his
  neck and then he spoke no more.</p>

  <p>Too late Hamilton came through the forest with his twenty Houssas.
  Bemebibi saw the end and was content to make a fight for it, as were his
  partners in crime.</p>

  <p>"Use your bayonets," said Hamilton briefly, and flicked out his long,
  white sword. Bemebibi lunged at him with his stabbing spear, and Hamilton
  caught the poisoned spearhead on the steel guard, touched it aside, and drove
  forward straight and swiftly from his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Bury all these men," said Hamilton, and spent a beastly night in the
  forest.</p>

  <p>So passed Bemebibi, and his people gave him up to the ghosts, him and his
  highmen.</p>

  <p>There were other problems less tragic, to be dealt with, a Bosambo rather
  grieved than sulking, a haughty N'gori to be kicked to a sense of his
  unimportance, chiefs, major and minor, to be brought into a condition of
  penitence.</p>

  <p>Hamilton went zigzagging up the river swiftly. He earned for himself in
  those days the name of "Dragon-fly," or its native equivalent, and the
  illustration was apt, for it seemed that the <i>Zaire</i> would poise,
  buzzing angrily, then dart off in unexpected directions, and the spirit of
  complacency which had settled upon the land gave place to one of
  apprehension, which, in the old days, followed the arrival of Sanders in a
  mood of reprisal.</p>

  <p>Hamilton sent a letter by canoe to his second-in-command. It started
  simply:</p>

  <p>"Bones&mdash;I will not call you 'dear Bones,'" it went on with a hint of
  the rancour in the writer's heart, "for you are not dear to me. I am striving
  to clear up the mess you have made so that when His Excellency arrives I
  shall be able to show him a law-abiding country. I have missed you, Bones,
  but had you been near on more occasion than one, I should not have missed
  you. Bones, were you ever kicked as a boy? Did any good fellow ever get you
  by the scruff of your neck and the seat of your trousers and chuck you into
  an evil-smelling pond? Try to think and send me the name of the man who did
  this, that I may send him a letter of thanks.</p>

  <p>"Your absurd weakness has kept me on the move for days. Oh, Bones, Bones!
  I am in a sweat, lest even now you are tampering with the discipline of my
  Houssas&mdash;lest you are handing round tea and cake to the Alis and Ahmets
  and Mustaphas of my soldiers; lest you are brightening their evenings with
  imitations of Frank Tinney and fanning the flies from their sleeping forms,"
  the letter went on.</p>

  <p>"Cad!" muttered Bones, as he read this bit.</p>

  <p>There were six pages couched in this strain, and at the end six more of
  instruction. Bones was in the forest when the letter came to him, unshaven,
  weary, and full of trouble.</p>

  <p>He hated work, he loathed field exercise, he regarded bridge-building over
  imaginary streams, and the whole infernal curriculum of military training, as
  being peculiarly within the province of the boy scouts and wholly beneath the
  dignity of an officer of the Houssas. And he felt horribly guilty as he read
  Hamilton's letter, for the night before it came he had most certainly
  entertained his company with a banjo rendering of the Soldiers' Chorus from
  "Faust."</p>

  <p>He rumpled his beautiful hair, jammed down his helmet, squared his
  shoulders, and, with a fiendish expression on his face&mdash;an expression
  intended by Bones to represent a stern, unbending devotion to duty, he
  stepped forth from his tent determined to undo what mischief he had done, and
  earn, if not the love, at least the respect of his people.</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">THERE is in all services a subtle fear and hope. They have
  to do less with material consequence than with a sense of harmony which
  rejects the discordance of failure. Also Hamilton was a human man, who,
  whilst he respected Sanders and had a profound regard for his qualities,
  nourished a secret faith that he might so carry on the work of the
  heaven-born Commissioner without demanding the charity of his superiors.</p>

  <p>He wished&mdash;not unnaturally&mdash;to spread a triumphant palm to his
  country and say "Behold! There are the talents that Sanders left&mdash;I have
  increased them, by my care, twofold."</p>

  <p>He came down stream in some haste having completed the work of
  pacification and stopped at the Village of Irons long enough to hand to the
  Houssa warder four unhappy counsellors of the Isisi king.</p>

  <p>"Keep these men for service against our lord Sandi's return."</p>

  <p>At Bosinkusu he was delayed by a storm, a mad, whirling brute of a storm
  that lashed the waters of the river and swept the <i>Zaire</i> broadside on
  towards the shore. At M'idibi, the villagers, whose duty it was to cut and
  stack wood for the Government steamers, had gone into a forest to meet a
  celebrated witch doctor, gambling on the fact that there was another wooding
  village ten miles down stream and that Hamilton would choose that for the
  restocking of his boat.</p>

  <p>So that beyond a thin skeleton pile of logs on the river's edge&mdash;set
  up to deceive the casual observer as he passed and approved of their
  industry&mdash;there was no wood and Hamilton had to set his men to
  wood-cutting.</p>

  <p>He had nearly completed the heart-breaking work when the villagers
  returned in a body, singing an unmusical song and decked about with ropes of
  flowers.</p>

  <p>"Now," explained the headman, "we have been to a palaver with a holy man
  and he has promised us that some day there will come to us a great harvest of
  corn which will be reaped by magic and laid at our doors whilst we
  sleep."</p>

  <p>"And I," said the exasperated Houssa, "promise you a great harvest of
  whips that, so far from coming in your sleep, will keep you awake."</p>

  <p>"Master, we did not know that you would come so soon," said the humble
  headman; "also there was a rumour that your lordship had been drowned in the
  storm and your <i>puc-a-puc</i> sunk, and my young men were happy because
  there would be no more wood to cut."</p>

  <p>The <i>Zaire</i>, fuel replenished, slipped down the river, Hamilton
  leaning over the rail promising unpleasant happenings as the boat drifted out
  from the faithless village. He had cut things very fine, and could do no more
  than hope that he would reach headquarters an hour or so before the
  Administrator arrived by the mail-boat. If Bones could be trusted there would
  be no cause for worry. Bones should have the men's quarters whitewashed, the
  parade ground swept and garnished, and stores in excellent order for
  inspection, and all the books on hand for the Accountant-General to glance
  over.</p>

  <p>But Bones!</p>

  <p>Hamilton writhed internally at the thought of Francis Augustus and his
  inefficiency.</p>

  <p>He had sent his second the most elaborate instructions, but if he knew his
  man, the languid Bones would do no more than pass those instructions on to a
  subordinate.</p>

  <p>It was ten o'clock on the morning of the inspection that the <i>Zaire</i>
  came paddling furiously to the tiny concrete quay, and Hamilton gave a sigh
  of relief. For there, awaiting him, stood Lieutenant Tibbetts in the glory of
  his raiment&mdash;helmet sparkling white, steel hilt of sword a-glitter,
  khaki uniform, spotless and well-fitting.</p>

  <p>"Everything is all right, sir," said Bones, saluting, and Hamilton thought
  he detected a gruffer and more robust note in the tone.</p>

  <p>"Mail-boat's just in, sir," Bones went on with unusual fierceness. "You're
  in time to meet His Excellency. Stores all laid out, books in trim, parade
  ground and quarters whitewashed as per your jolly old orders, sir."</p>

  <p>He saluted again, his eyes bulging, his face a veritable mask of ferocity,
  and, turning on his heel, he led the way to the beach.</p>

  <p>"Here, hold hard!" said Hamilton; "what the dickens is the matter with
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Seen the error of my ways, sir," growled Bones, again saluting
  punctiliously. "I've been an ass, sir&mdash;too lenient&mdash;given you a lot
  of trouble&mdash;shan't occur again."</p>

  <p>There was not time to ask any further questions.</p>

  <p>The two men had to run to reach the landing place in time, for the surf
  boats were at that moment rolling to the yellow beach.</p>

  <p>Sir Robert Sanleigh, in spotless white, was carried ashore, and his staff
  followed.</p>

  <p>"Ah, Hamilton," said the great Bob, "everything all right?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, your Excellency," said Hamilton, "there have been one or two serious
  killing palavers on which I will report."</p>

  <p>Sir Robert nodded.</p>

  <p>"You were bound to have a little trouble as soon as Sanders went," he
  said.</p>

  <p>He was a methodical man and had little time for the work at hand, for the
  mail-boat was waiting to carry him to another station. Books, quarters, and
  stores were in apple-pie order, and inwardly Hamilton raised his voice in
  praise of the young man, who strode silently and fiercely by his side, his
  face still distorted with a new-found fierceness.</p>

  <p>"The Houssas are all right, I suppose?" asked Sir Robert. "Discipline
  good&mdash;no crime?"</p>

  <p>"The discipline is excellent, sir," replied Hamilton, heartily, "and we
  haven't had any serious crime for years."</p>

  <p>Sir Robert Sanleigh fixed his <i>pince-nez</i> upon his nose and looked
  round the parade ground. A dozen Houssas in two ranks stood at attention in
  the centre.</p>

  <p>"Where are the rest of your men?" asked the Administrator.</p>

  <p>"In gaol, sir." It was Bones who answered the question.</p>

  <p>Hamilton gasped.</p>

  <p>"In gaol&mdash;I'm sorry&mdash;but I knew nothing for this. I've just
  arrived from the interior, your Excellency."</p>

  <p>They walked across to the little party.</p>

  <p>"Where is Sergeant Abiboo?" asked Hamilton suddenly.</p>

  <p>"In gaol, sir," said Bones, promptly, "sentenced to death&mdash;
  scratchin' his leg on parade after bein' warned repeatedly by me to give up
  the disgusting habit."</p>

  <p>"Where is Corporal Ahmet, Bones?" asked the frantic Hamilton.</p>

  <p>"In gaol, sir," said Bones. "I gave him twenty years for talkin' in the
  ranks an' cheekin' me when I told him to shut up. There's a whole lot of
  them, sir," he went on casually. "I sentenced two chaps to death for fightin'
  in the lines, an' gave another feller ten years for&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I think that will do," said Sir Robert, tactfully. "A most excellent
  inspection, Captain Hamilton&mdash;now, I think, I'll get back to my
  ship."</p>

  <p>He took Hamilton aside on the beach.</p>

  <p>"What did you call that young man?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Bones, your Excellency," said Hamilton miserably.</p>

  <p>"I should call him Blood and Bones," smiled His Excellency, as he shook
  hands.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"What's the good of bullyin' me, dear old chap?" asked Bones
  indignantly. "If I let a chap off, I'm kicked, an' if I punish him I'm
  kicked&mdash;it's enough to make a feller give up bein' judicial&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Bones, you're a goop," said Hamilton, in despair.</p>

  <p>"A goop, sir?&mdash;if you'd be kind enough to explain&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"There's an ass," said Hamilton, ticking off one finger; "and there's a
  silly ass," he ticked off the second; "and there's a silly ass who is such a
  silly ass that he doesn't know what a silly ass he is: we call him a
  goop."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, sir," said Bones, without resentment, "and which is the goop,
  you or&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>Hamilton dropped his hand on his revolver butt, and for a moment there was
  murder in his eyes.</p>

     id="chap04">IV. &mdash; THE LOST N'BOSINI</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Weekly Tale-Teller</i>, 31 Oct 1914</h3>

  <p class="first">"M'ILITANI, there is a bad palaver in the N'bosini country,"
  said the gossip-chief of the Lesser Isisi, and wagged his head
  impressively.</p>

  <p>Hamilton of the Houssas rose up from his camp chair and stretched himself
  to his full six feet. His laughing eyes&mdash;terribly blue they looked in
  the mahogany setting of his lean face&mdash;quizzed the chief, and his
  clean-shaven lips twitched ever so slightly.</p>

  <p>Chief Idigi looked at him curiously. Idigi was squat and fat, but wise.
  None the less he gossiped, for, as they say on the river, "Even the wise
  <i>oochiri</i> is a chatterer."</p>

  <p>"O, laughing Lord," said Idigi, almost humble in his awe&mdash;for blue
  eyes in a brown face are a great sign of devilry, "this is no smiling
  palaver, for they say&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Idigi," interrupted Hamilton, "I smile when you speak of the N'bosini,
  because there is no such land. Even Sandi, who has wisdom greater than
  <i>ju-ju</i>, he says that there is no N'bosini, but that it is the foolish
  talk of men who cannot see whence come their troubles and must find a land
  and a people and a king out of their mad heads. Go back to your village,
  Idigi, telling all men that I sit here for a spell in the place of my lord
  Sandi, and if there be, not one king of N'bosini, but a score, and if he
  lead, not one army, but three and three and three, I will meet him with my
  soldiers and he shall go the way of the bad king."</p>

  <p>Idigi, unconvinced, shaking his head, said a doubtful "<i>Wa!</i>" and
  would continue upon his agreeable subject&mdash;for he was a lover of
  ghosts.</p>

  <p>"Now," said he, impressively, "it is said that on the night before the
  moon came, there was seen, on the edge of the lake-forest, ten warriors of
  the N'bosini, with spears of fire and arrows tipped with stars,
  also&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Go to the devil!" said Hamilton, cheerfully. "The palaver is
  finished."</p>

  <p>Later, he watched Idigi&mdash;so humble a man that he never travelled with
  more than four paddlers&mdash;winding his slow way up stream&mdash;and
  Hamilton was not laughing.</p>

  <p>He went back to his canvas chair before the Residency, and sat for half an
  hour, alternately pinching and rubbing his bare arms&mdash;he was in his
  shirt sleeves&mdash;in a reverie which was not pleasant.</p>

  <p>Here Lieutenant Augustus Tibbetts, returning from an afternoon's fishing,
  with a couple of weird-looking fish as his sole catch, found him and would
  have gone on with a little salute.</p>

  <p>"Bones!" called Hamilton, softly.</p>

  <p>Bones swung round. "Sir!" he said stiffly.</p>

  <p>"Come off your horse, Bones," coaxed Hamilton.</p>

  <p>"Not me," replied Bones; "I've finished with you, dear old fellow; as an
  officer an' a gentleman you've treated me rottenly&mdash;you have, indeed.
  Give me an order&mdash;I'll obey it. Tell me to lead a forlorn hope or go to
  bed at ten&mdash;I'll carry out instructions accordin' to military law, but
  outside of duty you're a jolly old rotter. I'm hurt, Ham, doocidly hurt. I
  think&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh shut up and sit down!" interrupted his chief, irritably. "You jaw and
  jaw till my head aches."</p>

  <p>Reluctantly Lieutenant Tibbetts walked back, depositing his catch with the
  greatest care on the ground.</p>

  <p>"What on earth have you got there?" asked Hamilton, curiously.</p>

  <p>"I don't know whether it's cod or turbot," said the cautious Bones, "but
  I'll have 'em cooked and find out."</p>

  <p>Hamilton grinned. "To be exact, they're catfish, and poisonous," he said,
  and whistled his orderly. "Oh, Ahmet," he said in Arabic, "take these fish
  and throw them away."</p>

  <p>Bones fixed his monocle, and his eyes followed his catch till they were
  out of sight.</p>

  <p>"Of course, sir," he said with resignation, "if you like to commandeer my
  fish it's not for me to question you."</p>

  <p>"I'm a little worried, Bones," began Hamilton.</p>

  <p>"A conscience, sir," said Bones, smugly, "is a pretty rotten thing for a
  feller to have. I remember years ago&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There's a little unrest up there"&mdash;Hamilton waved his hand towards
  the dark green forest, sombre in the shadows of the evening&mdash;"a palaver
  I don't quite get the hang of. If I could only trust you, Bones!"</p>

  <p>Lieutenant Tibbetts rose. He readjusted his monocle and stiffened himself
  to attention&mdash;a heroic pose which invariably accompanied his protests.
  But Hamilton gave him no opportunity.</p>

  <p>"Anyway, I have to trust you, Bones," he said, "whether I like it or not.
  You get ready to clear out. Take twenty men and patrol the river between the
  Isisi and the Akasava."</p>

  <p>In as few words as possible he explained the legend of the N'bosini. "Of
  course, there is no such place," he said; "it is a mythical land like the
  lost Atlantis&mdash;the home of the mysterious and marvellous tribes,
  populated by giants and filled with all the beautiful products of the
  world."</p>

  <p>"I know, sir," said Bones, nodding his head. "It is like one of those
  building estate advertisements you read in the American papers:
  Young-man-go-west-an'-buy-Dudville Corner Blocks&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You have a horrible mind," said Hamilton. "However, get ready. I will
  have steam in the <i>Zaire</i> against your departure."</p>

  <p>"There is one thing I should like to ask you about," said Bones, standing
  hesitatingly first on one leg and then on the other. "I think I have told you
  before that I have tickets in a Continental sweepstake. I should be awfully
  obliged&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Go away!" snarled Hamilton.</p>

  <p>Bones went cheerfully enough.</p>

  <p>He loved the life on the <i>Zaire</i>, the comfort of Sanders' cabin, the
  electric reading lamp and the fine sense of authority. He would stand upon
  the bridge for hours, with folded arms and impassive face, staring ahead as
  the oily waters moved slowly under the bow of the stern-wheeler. Now and
  again he would turn to give a fierce order to the steersman or to the patient
  Yoka, the squat black <i>Krooman</i> who knew every inch of the river, and
  who stood all the time, his hand upon the lever of the telegraph ready to
  "slow" at the first sign of a new sand-bank.</p>

  <p>For, in parts, the river was less than two or three feet deep and the bed
  was constantly changing. The sounding boys, who stood on the bow of the
  steamer, whirling their long canes and singing the depth monotonously, would
  shout a warning cry, but long before their lips had framed a caution, Yoka
  would have pulled the telegraph over to "stop." His eyes would have detected
  the tiny ripple on the waters ahead which denoted a new "bank."</p>

  <p>To Bones, the river was a deep, clear stream. He had no idea as to the
  depth and never troubled to inquire. These short, stern orders of his that he
  barked to left and right from time to time, nobody took the slightest notice
  of, and Bones would have been considerably embarrassed if they had. Observing
  that the steamer was tacking from shore to shore, a proceeding which, to
  Bones' orderly mind, seemed inconsistent with the dignity of the Government
  boat, he asked the reason.</p>

  <p>"Lord," said the steersman, one Ebibi, "there are many banks hereabout,
  large sands, which silt up in a night, therefore we must make a passage for
  the <i>puc-a-puc</i>, by going from shore to shore."</p>

  <p>"You're a silly ass," said Bones, "and let it go at that."</p>

  <p>Yet, for all his irresponsibility, for all his wild and unknowledgeable
  conspectus of the land and its people, there was instilled in the heart of
  Lieutenant Tibbetts something of the spirit of dark romance and
  adventure-loving, which association with the Coast alone can bring.</p>

  <p>In the big house at Dorking where he had spent his childhood, the ten-acre
  estate, where his father had lorded (himself a one-time Commissioner), he had
  watered the seed of desire which heredity had irradicably sown in his bosom;
  a desire not to be shaped by words, or confirmed in phrase, but best
  described as the discovery-lust, which send men into dark, unknown places of
  the world to joyously sacrifice life and health that their names might be
  associated with some scrap of sure fact for the better guidance of unborn
  generations.</p>

  <p>Bones was a dreamer of dreams.</p>

  <p>On the bridge of the <i>Zaire</i> he was a Nelson taking the
  <i>Victory</i> into action, a Stanley, a Columbus, a Sir Garnet Wolseley
  forcing the passages of the Nile.</p>

  <p>Small wonder that he turned from time to time to the steersman with a
  sharp "Put her to starboard," or "Port your helm a little."</p>

  <p>Less wonder that the wholly uncomprehending steersman went on with his
  work as though Bones had no separate or tangible existence.</p>

  <p>On the fourth evening after leaving headquarters, Bones summoned to his
  cabin Mahomet Ali, the sergeant in charge of his soldiers.</p>

  <p>"O, Mahomet," said he, "tell me of this N'bosini of which men speak, and
  in which all native people believe, for my lord M'ilitani has said that there
  is no such place and that it is the dream of mad people."</p>

  <p>"Master, that I also believe," said Mahomet Ali; "these people of the
  river are barbarians, having no God and being foredoomed for all time to
  hell, and it is my belief that his idea of N'bosini is no more than the
  Paradise of the faithful, of which the barbarians have heard and converted in
  their wild way."</p>

  <p>"Tell me, who talks of N'bosini," said Bones, crossing his legs and
  leaning back in his chair, his hands behind his head; "for, remember that I
  am a stranger amongst you, Mahomet Ali, coming from a far land and having
  seen such marvels as&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He paused, seeking the Arabic for "gramaphone" and "motor-'bus," then he
  went on wisely: "Such marvels as you cannot imagine."</p>

  <p>"This I know of N'bosini," said the sergeant, "that all men along this
  river believe in it; all save Bosambo of the Ochori who, as is well known,
  believes in nothing, since he is a follower of the Prophet and the one
  God."</p>

  <p>Mahomet Ali salaamed devoutly.</p>

  <p>"And men say that this land lies at the back of the N'gombi country; and
  others that it lies near the territories of the old King; and some others who
  say that it is a far journey beyond the French's territory, farther than man
  can walk, that its people have wings upon their shoulders and can fly, and
  that their eyes are so fierce that trees burn when they look upon them. This
  only we know, lord, we, of your soldiers, who have followed Sandi through all
  his high adventures, that when men talk of N'bosini, there is trouble, for
  they are seeking something to excuse their own wickedness."</p>

  <p>All night long, as Bones turned from side to side in his hot cabin,
  listening to the ineffectual buzzings of the flies that sought,
  unsuccessfully, to reach the interior of the cabin through a fine meshed
  screen, the problem of N'bosini revolved in his mind.</p>

  <p>Was it likely, thought Bones, cunningly, that men should invent a country,
  even erring men, seeking an excuse? Did not all previous experience go to the
  support of the theory that N'bosini had some existence? In other words that,
  planted in the secret heart of some forest in the territory, barred from
  communication with the world by swift rivers of the high tangle of forests,
  there was, in being, a secret tribe of which only rumours had been
  heard&mdash;a tribe of white men, perhaps!</p>

  <p>Bones had read of such things in books; he knew his "Solomon's Mines" and
  was well acquainted with his "Allan Quatermain." Who knows but that through
  the forest was a secret path held, perchance, by armoured warriors, which led
  to the mountains at the edge of the Old King's territory, where in the folds
  of the inaccessible hills, there might be a city of stone, peopled and
  governed by stern white-bearded men, and streets filled with beautiful
  maidens garbed in the style of ancient Greece!</p>

  <p>"It is all dam' nonsense of course," said Bones to himself, though feebly;
  "but, after all there may be something in this. There's no smoke without
  fire."</p>

  <p>The idea took hold of him and gripped him most powerfully. He took
  Sanders' priceless maps and carefully triangulated them, consulting every
  other written authority on the ship. He stopped at villages and held palavers
  on this question of N'bosini and acquired a whole mass of conflicting
  information.</p>

  <p>If you smile at Bones, you smile at the glorious spirit of enterprise
  which has created Empire. Out of such dreams as ran criss-cross through the
  mind of Lieutenant Tibbetts there have arisen nationalities undreamt of and
  Empires Caesar never knew.</p>

  <p>Now one thing is certain, that Bones, in pursuing his inquiries about
  N'bosini, was really doing a most useful piece of work.</p>

  <p>The palavers he called had a deeper significance to the men who attended
  them than purely geographical inquiries. Thus, the folk of the Isisi planning
  a little raid upon certain Akasava fishermen, who had established themselves
  unlawfully upon the Isisi river-line, put away their spears and folded their
  hands when N'bosini was mentioned, because Bones was unconsciously probing
  their excuse before they advanced it.</p>

  <p>Idigi, himself, who, in his caution, had prepared Hamilton for some slight
  difference of opinion between his own tribe and the N'gombi of the interior,
  read into the earnest inquiries of Lieutenant Tibbetts, something more than a
  patient spirit of research.</p>

  <p>All that Hamilton had set his subordinate to accomplish Bones was doing,
  though none was more in ignorance of the fact than himself, and, since all
  men owed a grudge to the Ochori, palavers, which had as their object an
  investigation into the origin of the N'bosini legend, invariably ended in the
  suggestion rather than the statement that the only authority upon this
  mysterious land, and the still more mysterious tribe who inhabited it, was
  Bosambo of the Ochori. Thus, subtly, was Bosambo saddled with all
  responsibility in the matter.</p>

  <p>Hamilton's parting injunction to Bones had been:</p>

  <p>"Be immensely civil to Bosambo, because he is rather sore with you and he
  is a very useful man."</p>

  <p>Regarding him, as he did, as the final authority upon the N'bosini, Bones
  made elaborate preparations to carry out his chief's commands. He came round
  the river bend to the Ochori city, with flags fluttering at his white mast,
  with his soldiers drawn up on deck, with his buglers tootling, and his siren
  sounding, and Bosambo, ever ready to jump to the conclusion that he was being
  honoured for his own sake, found that this time, at least, he had made no
  mistake and rose to the occasion.</p>

  <p>In an emerald-green robe with twelve sox suspenders strapped about his
  legs and dangling tags a-glitter&mdash;he had bought these on his visit to
  the Coast&mdash;with an umbrella of state and six men carrying a canopy over
  his august person, he came down to the beach to greet the representatives of
  the Government.</p>

  <p>"Lord," said Bosambo humbly, "it gives me great pride that your lordship
  should bring his beautiful presence to my country. All this month I have sat
  in my hut, wondering why you came not to the Ochori, and I have not eaten
  food for many days because of my sorrow and my fear that you would not come
  to us."</p>

  <p>Bones walked under the canopy to the chief's hut. A superior palaver
  occupied the afternoon on the question of taxation. Here Bones was on safe
  ground. Having no power to remit taxes, but having most explicit instructions
  from his chief, which admitted of no compromise, it was an easy matter for
  Bones to shake his head and say in English:</p>

  <p>"Nothin' doing"; a phrase which, afterwards, passed into the vocabulary of
  the Ochori as the equivalent of denial of privilege.</p>

  <p>It was on the second day that Bones broached the question of the N'bosini.
  Bosambo had it on the tip of his tongue to deny all knowledge of this tribe,
  was even preparing to call down destruction upon the heads of the barbarians
  who gave credence to the story. Then he asked curiously:</p>

  <p>"Lord, why do you speak of the land or desire knowledge upon it?"</p>

  <p>"Because," said Bones, firmly, "it is in mind, Bosambo, that somewhere in
  this country, dwell such a people, and since all men agree that you are wise,
  I have come to you to seek it."</p>

  <p>"<i>O ko</i>," said Bosambo, under his breath.</p>

  <p>He fixed his eyes upon Bones, licked his lips a little, twiddled his
  fingers a great deal, and began:</p>

  <p>"Lord, it is written in a certain <i>Suru</i> that wisdom comest from the
  East, and that knowledge from the West, that courage comes from the North,
  and sin from the South."</p>

  <p>"Steady the Buffs, Bosambo!" murmured Bones, reprovingly, "I come from the
  South."</p>

  <p>He spoke in English, and Bosambo, resisting the temptation to retort in an
  alien tongue, and realizing perhaps that he would need all the strength of
  his more extensive vocabulary to convince his hearer, continued in
  Bomongo:</p>

  <p>"Now I tell you," he went on solemnly, "if Sandi had come, Sandi, who
  loves me better than his brother, and who knew my father and lived with him
  for many years, and if Sandi spoke to me, saying 'Tell me, O Bosambo, where
  is N'bosini?' I answer 'Lord, there are things which are written and which I
  know cannot be told, not even to you whom I love so dearly.'" He paused.</p>

  <p>Bones was impressed. He stared, wide-eyed, at the chief, tilted his helmet
  back a little from his damp brow, folded his hands on his knees and opened
  his mouth a little.</p>

  <p>"But it is you, O my lord," said Bosambo, extravagantly, "who asks this
  question. You, who have suddenly come amongst us and who are brighter to us
  than the moon and dearer to us than the land which grows corn; therefore must
  I speak to you that which is in my heart. If I lie, strike me down at your
  feet, for I am ready to die."</p>

  <p>He paused again, throwing out his arms invitingly, but Bones said
  nothing.</p>

  <p>"Now this I tell you," Bosambo shook his finger impressively, "that the
  N'bosini lives."</p>

  <p>"Where?" asked Bones, quickly.</p>

  <p>Already he saw himself lecturing before a crowded audience at the Royal
  Geographical Society, his name in the papers, perhaps a Tibbett River or a
  Francis Augustus Mountain added to the sum of geographical knowledge.</p>

  <p>"It is in a certain place," said Bosambo, solemnly, "which only I know,
  and I have sworn a solemn oath by many sacred things which I dare not break,
  by letting of blood and by rubbing in of salt, that I will not divulge the
  secret."</p>

  <p>"O, tell me, Bosambo," demanded Bones, leaning forward and speaking
  rapidly, "what manner of people are they who live in the city of
  N'bosini?"</p>

  <p>"They are men and women," said Bosambo after a pause.</p>

  <p>"White or black?" asked Bones, eagerly.</p>

  <p>Bosambo thought a little.</p>

  <p>"White," he said soberly, and was immensely pleased at the impression he
  created.</p>

  <p>"I thought so," said Bones, excitedly, and jumped up, his eyes wider than
  ever, his hands trembling as he pulled his note-book from his breast
  pocket.</p>

  <p>"I will make a book[3] of this, Bosambo," he said, almost incoherently.
  "You shall speak slowly, telling me all things, for I must write in
  English."</p>

  <p>[Footnote 3: "Book" means any written thing. A "Note" is a book.]</p>

  <p>He produced his pencil, squatted again, open book upon his knee, and
  looked up at Bosambo to commence.</p>

  <p>"Lord, I cannot do this," said Bosambo, his face heavy with gloom, "for
  have I not told your lordship that I have sworn such oath? Moreover," he said
  carelessly, "we who know the secret, have each hidden a large bag of silver
  in the ground, all in one place, and we have sworn that he who tells the
  secret shall lose his share. Now, by the Prophet, 'Eye-of-the-Moon' (this was
  one of the names which Bones had earned, for which his monocle was
  responsible), I cannot do this thing."</p>

  <p>"How large was this bag, Bosambo?" asked Bones, nibbling the end of his
  pencil.</p>

  <p>"Lord, it was so large," said Bosambo.</p>

  <p>He moved his hands outward slowly, keeping his eyes fixed upon Lieutenant
  Tibbetts till he read in them a hint of pain and dismay. Then he stopped.</p>

  <p>"So large," he said, choosing the dimensions his hands had indicated
  before Bones showed signs of alarm. "Lord, in the bag was silver worth a
  hundred English pounds."</p>

  <p>Bones, continuing his meal of cedar-wood, thought the matter out.</p>

  <p>It was worth it.</p>

  <p>"Is it a large city?" he asked suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Larger than the whole of the Ochori," answered Bosambo impressively.</p>

  <p>"And tell me this, Bosambo, what manner of houses are these which stand in
  the city of the N'bosini?"</p>

  <p>"Larger than kings' huts," said Bosambo.</p>

  <p>"Of stone?"</p>

  <p>"Lord, of rock, so that they are like mountains," replied Bosambo.</p>

  <p>Bones shut his book and got up.</p>

  <p>"This day I go back to M'ilitani, carrying word of the N'bosini," said he,
  and Bosambo's jaw dropped, though Bones did not notice the fact.</p>

  <p>"Presently I will return, bringing with me silver of the value of a
  hundred English pounds, and you shall lead us to this strange city."</p>

  <p>"Lord, it is a far way," faltered Bosambo, "across many swamps and over
  high mountains; also there is much sickness and death, wild beasts in the
  forests and snakes in the trees and terrible storms of rain."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless, I will go," said Bones, in high spirits, "I, and you
  also."</p>

  <p>"Master," said the agitated Bosambo, "say no word of this to M'ilitani; if
  you do, be sure that my enemies will discover it and I shall be killed."</p>

  <p>Bones hesitated and Bosambo pushed his advantage.</p>

  <p>"Rather, lord," said he, "give me all the silver you have and let me go
  alone, carrying a message to the mighty chief of the N'bosini. Presently I
  will return, bringing with me strange news, such as no white lord, not even
  Sandi, has received or heard, and cunning weapons which only N'bosini use and
  strange magics. Also will I bring you stories of their river, but I will go
  alone, though I die, for what am I that I should deny myself from the service
  of your lordship?"</p>

  <p>It happened that Bones had some twenty pounds on the <i>Zaire</i>, and
  Bosambo condescended to come aboard to accept, with outstretched hands, this
  earnest of his master's faith.</p>

  <p>"Lord," said he, solemnly, as he took a farewell of his benefactor,
  "though I lose a great bag of silver because I have betrayed certain men, yet
  I know that, upon a day to come, you will pay me all that I desire. Go in
  peace."</p>

  <p>It was a hilarious, joyous, industrious Bones who went down the river to
  headquarters, occupying his time in writing diligently upon large sheets of
  foolscap in his no less large unformed handwriting, setting forth all that
  Bosambo had told him, and all the conclusions he might infer from the
  confidence of the Ochori king.</p>

  <p>He was bursting with his news. At first, he had to satisfy his chief that
  he had carried out his orders.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Hamilton needed little convincing; his own spies had told him
  of the quietening down of certain truculent sections of his unruly community
  and he was prepared to give his subordinate all the credit that was due to
  him.</p>

  <p>It was after dinner and the inevitable rice pudding had been removed and
  the pipes were puffing bluely in the big room of the Residency, when Bones
  unburdened himself.</p>

  <p>"Sir," he began, "you think I am an ass."</p>

  <p>"I was not thinking so at this particular moment," said Hamilton; "but, as
  a general consensus of my opinion concerning you, I have no fault to find
  with it."</p>

  <p>"You think poor old Bones is a goop," said Lieutenant Tibbetts with a
  pitying smile, "and yet the name of poor old Bones is going down to
  posterity, sir."</p>

  <p>"That is posterity's look-out," said Hamilton, offensively; but Bones
  ignored the rudeness.</p>

  <p>"You also imagine that there is no such land as the N'bosini, I
  think?"</p>

  <p>Bones put the question with a certain insolent assurance which was very
  irritating.</p>

  <p>"I not only think, but I know," replied Hamilton.</p>

  <p>Bones laughed, a sardonic, knowing laugh.</p>

  <p>"We shall see," he said, mysteriously; "I hope, in the course of a few
  weeks, to place a document in your possession that will not only surprise,
  but which, I believe, knowing that beneath a somewhat uncouth manner lies a
  kindly heart, will also please you."</p>

  <p>"Are you chucking up the army?" asked Hamilton with interest.</p>

  <p>"I have no more to say, sir," said Bones.</p>

  <p>He got up, took his helmet from a peg on the wall, saluted and walked
  stiffly from the Residency and was swallowed up in the darkness of the parade
  ground.</p>

  <p>A quarter of an hour later, there came a tap upon his door and Mahomet
  Ali, his sergeant, entered.</p>

  <p>"Ah, Mah'met," said Hamilton, looking up with a smile, "all things were
  quiet on the river my lord Tibbetts tells me."</p>

  <p>"Lord, everything was proper," said the sergeant, "and all people came to
  palaver humbly."</p>

  <p>"What seek you now?" asked Hamilton.</p>

  <p>"Lord," said Mahomet, "Bosambo of the Ochori is, as you know, of my faith,
  and by certain oaths we are as blood brothers. This happened after a battle
  in the year of Drought when Bosambo saved my life."</p>

  <p>"All this I know," said Hamilton.</p>

  <p>"Now, lord," said Mahomet Ali, "I bring you this."</p>

  <p>He took from the inside of his uniform jacket a little canvas bag, opened
  it slowly and emptied its golden contents upon the table. There was a small
  shining heap of sovereigns and a twisted note; this latter he placed in
  Hamilton's hand and the Houssa captain unfolded it. It was a letter in Arabic
  in Bosambo's characteristic and angular handwriting.</p>

  <p>"From Bosambo, the servant of the Prophet, of the upper river in the city
  of the Ochori, to M'ilitani, his master. Peace on your house.</p>

  <p>"In the name of God I send you this news. My lord with the moon-eye,
  making inquiries about the N'bosini, came to the Ochori and I told him much
  that he wrote down in a book. Now, I tell you, M'ilitani, that I am not to
  blame, because my lord with the moon-eye wrote down these things. Also he
  gave me twenty English pounds because I told him certain stories and this I
  send to you, that you shall put it in with my other treasures, making a mark
  in your book that this twenty pounds is the money of Bosambo of the Ochori,
  and that you will send me a book, saying that this money has come to you and
  is safely in your hands. Peace and felicity upon your house.</p>

  <p>"Written in my city of Ochori and given to my brother, Mahomet Ali, who
  shall carry it to M'ilitani at the mouth of the river."</p>

  <p>"Poor old Bones!" said Hamilton, as he slowly counted the money. "Poor old
  Bones!" he repeated.</p>

  <p>He took an account book from his desk and opened it at a page marked
  "Bosambo." His entry was significant.</p>

  <p>To a long list of credits which ran:</p>

  <p>Received 30. (Sale of Rubber.)</p>

  <p>Received 25. (Sale of Gum.)</p>

  <p>Received 130. (Sale of Ivory.)</p>

     id="chap05">V. &mdash; THE FETISH STICK</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Weekly Tale-Teller</i>, 7 Nov 1914</h3>

  <p class="first">N'GORI the Chief had a son who limped and lived. This was a
  marvellous thing in a land where cripples are severely discouraged and
  malformity is a sure passport for heaven.</p>

  <p>The truth is that M'fosa was born in a fishing village at a period of time
  when all the energies of the Akasava were devoted to checking and defeating
  the predatory raidings of the N'gombi, under that warlike chief G'osimalino,
  who also kept other nations on the defensive, and held the river basin, from
  the White River, by the old king's territory, to as far south as the islands
  of the Lesser Isisi.</p>

  <p>When M'fosa was three months old, Sanders had come with a force of
  soldiers, had hanged G'osimalino to a high tree, had burnt his villages and
  destroyed his crops and driven the remnants of his one-time invincible army
  to the little known recesses of the Itusi Forest.</p>

  <p>Those were the days of the Cakitas or government chiefs, and it was under
  the beneficent sway of one of these that M'fosa grew to manhood, though many
  attempts were made to lure him to unfrequented waterways and blind crocodile
  creeks where a lame man might be lost, and no one be any the wiser.</p>

  <p>Chief of the eugenists was Kobolo, the boy's uncle, and N'gori's own
  brother. This dissatisfied man, with several of M'fosa's cousins, once
  partially succeeded in kidnapping the lame boy, and they were on their way to
  certain middle islands in the broads of the river to accomplish their
  scheme&mdash;which was to put out the eyes of M'fosa and leave him to
  die&mdash;when Sanders had happened along.</p>

  <p>He it was who set all the men of M'fosa's village to cut down a high pine
  tree&mdash;at an infernal distance from the village, and had men working for
  a week, trimming and planing that pine; and another week they spent carrying
  the long stem through the forest (Sanders had devilishly chosen his tree in
  the most inaccessible part of the woods), and yet another week digging large
  holes and erecting it.</p>

  <p>For he was a difficult man to please. Broad backs ran sweat to pull and
  push and hoist that great flagstaff (as it appeared with its strong pulley
  and smooth sides) to its place. And no sooner was it up than my lord Sandi
  had changed his mind and must have it in another place. Sanders would come
  back at intervals to see how the work was progressing. At last it was fixed,
  that monstrous pole, and the men of the village sighed thankfully.</p>

  <p>"Lord, tell me," N'gori had asked, "why you put this great stick in the
  ground?"</p>

  <p>"This," said Sanders, "is for him who injures M'fosa your son; upon this
  will I hang him. And if there be more men than one who take to the work of
  slaughter, behold! I will have yet another tree cut and hauled, and put in a
  place and upon that will I hang the other man. All men shall know this sign,
  the high stick as my fetish; and it shall watch the evil hearts and carry me
  all thoughts, good and evil. And then I tell you, that such is its magic,
  that if needs be, it shall draw me from the end of the world to punish
  wrong."</p>

  <p>This is the story of the fetish stick of the Akasava and of how it came to
  be in its place.</p>

  <p>None did hurt to M'fosa, and he grew to be a man, and as he grew and his
  father became first counsellor, then petty chief, and, at last, paramount
  chief of the nation, M'fosa developed in hauteur and bitterness, for this
  high pole rainwashed, and sun-burnt, was a reminder, not of the strong hand
  that had been stretched out to save him, but of his own infirmity.</p>

  <p>And he came to hate it, and by some curious perversion to hate the man who
  had set it up.</p>

  <p>Most curious of all to certain minds, he was the first of those who
  condemned, and secretly slew, the unfortunates, who either came into the
  world hampered by disfigurement, or who, by accident, were unfitted for the
  great battle.</p>

  <p>He it was who drowned Kibusi the woodman, who lost three fingers by the
  slipping of the axe; he was the leader of the young men who fell upon the boy
  Sandilo-M'goma, who was crippled by fire; and though the fetish stood a
  menace to all, reading thoughts and clothed with authority, yet M'fosa defied
  spirits and went about his work reckless of consequence.</p>

  <p>When Sanders had gone home, and it seemed that law had ceased to be,
  N'gori (as I have shown) became of a sudden a bold and fearless man,
  furbished up his ancient grievances and might have brought trouble to the
  land, but for a watchful Bosambo.</p>

  <p>This is certain, however, that N'gori himself was a good-enough man at
  heart, and if there was evil in his actions be sure that behind him
  prompting, whispering, subtly threatening him, was his malignant son, a
  sinister figure with one eye half closed, and a figure that went limping
  through the city with a twisted smile.</p>

  <p>An envoy came to the Ochori country bearing green branches of the Isisi
  palm, which signifies peace, and at the head of the mission&mdash;for mission
  it was&mdash;came M'fosa.</p>

  <p>"Lord Bosambo," said the man who limped, "N'gori the chief, my father, has
  sent me, for he desires your friendship and help; also your loving
  countenance at his great feast."</p>

  <p>"Oh, oh!" said Bosambo, drily, "what king's feast is this?"</p>

  <p>"Lord," rejoined the other, "it is no king's feast, but a great dance of
  rejoicing, for our crops are very plentiful, and our goats have multiplied
  more than a man can count; therefore my father said: Go you to Bosambo of the
  Ochori, he who was once my enemy and now indeed my friend. And say to him
  'Come into my city, that I may honour you.'"</p>

  <p>Bosambo thought.</p>

  <p>"How can your lord and father feast so many as I would bring?" he asked
  thoughtfully, as he sat, chin on palm, pondering the invitation, "for I have
  a thousand spearmen, all young men and fond of food."</p>

  <p>M'fosa's face fell.</p>

  <p>"Yet, Lord Bosambo," said he, "if you come without your spearmen, but with
  your counsellors only&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Bosambo looked at the limper, through half-closed eyes. "I carry spears to
  a Dance of Rejoicing," he said significantly, "else I would not Dance or
  Rejoice."</p>

  <p>M'fosa showed his teeth, and his eyes were filled with hateful fires. He
  left the Ochori with bad grace, and was lucky to leave it at all, for certain
  men of the country, whom he had put to torture (having captured them fishing
  in unauthorized waters), would have rushed him but for Bosambo's
  presence.</p>

  <p>His other invitation was more successful. Hamilton of the Houssas was at
  the Isisi city when the deputation called upon him.</p>

  <p>"Here's a chance for you, Bones," he said.</p>

  <p>Lieutenant Tibbetts had spent a vain day, fishing in the river with a rod
  and line, and was sprawling under a deck-chair under the awning of the
  bridge.</p>

  <p>"Would you like to be the guest of honour at N'gori's little thanksgiving
  service?"</p>

  <p>Bones sat up.</p>

  <p>"Shall I have to make a speech?" he asked cautiously.</p>

  <p>"You may have to respond for the ladies," said Hamilton. "No, my dear
  chap, all you will have to do will be to sit round and look clever."</p>

  <p>Bones thought awhile.</p>

  <p>"I'll bet you're putting me on to a rotten job," he accused, "but I'll
  go."</p>

  <p>"I wish you would," said Hamilton, seriously. "I can't get the hang of
  M'fosa's mind, ever since you treated him with such leniency."</p>

  <p>"If you're goin' to dig up the grisly past, dear old sir," said a
  reproachful Bones, "if you insist recalling events which I hoped, sir, were
  hidden in oblivion, I'm going to bed."</p>

  <p>He got up, this lank youth, fixed his eyeglass firmly and glared at his
  superior.</p>

  <p>"Sit down and shut up," said Hamilton, testily; "I'm not blaming you. And
  I'm not blaming N'gori. It's that son of his&mdash;listen to this."</p>

  <p>He beckoned the three men who had come down from the Akasava as bearers of
  the invitation.</p>

  <p>"Say again what your master desires," he said.</p>

  <p>"Thus speaks N'gori, and I talk with his voice," said the spokesman, "that
  you shall cut down the devil-stick which Sandi planted in our midst, for it
  brings shame to us, and also to M'fosa the son of our master."</p>

  <p>"How may I do this?" asked Hamilton, "I, who am but the servant of Sandi?
  For I remember well that he put the stick there to make a great magic."</p>

  <p>"Now the magic is made," said the sullen headman; "for none of our people
  have died the death since Sandi set it up."</p>

  <p>"And dashed lucky you've been," murmured Bones.</p>

  <p>"Go back to your master and tell him this," said Hamilton. "Thus says
  M'ilitani, my lord Tibbetti will come on your feast day and you shall honour
  him; as for the stick, it stands till Sandi says it shall not stand. The
  palaver is finished."</p>

  <p>He paced up and down the deck when the men had gone, his hands behind him,
  his brows knit in worry.</p>

  <p>"Four times have I been asked to cut down Sanders' pole," he mused aloud.
  "I wonder what the idea is?"</p>

  <p>"The idea?" said Bones, "the idea, my dear old silly old fellow, isn't it
  as plain as your dashed old nose? They don't want it!"</p>

  <p>Hamilton looked down at him.</p>

  <p>"What a brain you must have, Bones!" he said admiringly. "I often wonder
  you don't employ it."</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">BY the Blue Pool in the forest there is a famous tree gifted
  with certain properties. It is known in the vernacular of the land, and I
  translate it literally, "The-tree-that-has-no-echo-and-eats-up-sound." Men
  believe that all that is uttered beneath its twisted branches may be
  remembered, but not repeated, and if one shouts in its deadening shade, even
  they who stand no farther than a stride from its furthermost stretch of
  branch or leaf, will hear nothing.</p>

  <p>Therefore is the Silent Tree much in favour for secret palaver, such as
  N'gori and his limping son attended, and such as the Lesser Isisi came to
  fearfully.</p>

  <p>N'gori, who might be expected to take a very leading part in the
  discussion which followed the meeting, was, in fact, the most timorous of
  those who squatted in the shadow of the huge cedar.</p>

  <p>Full of reservations, cautions, doubts and counsels of discretion was
  N'gori till his son turned on him, grinning as his wont when in his least
  pleasant mood.</p>

  <p>"O, my father," said he softly, "they say on the river that men who die
  swiftly say no more than 'wait' with their last breath; now I tell you that
  all my young men who plot secretly with me, are for chopping you&mdash;but
  because I am like a god to them, they spare you."</p>

  <p>"My son," said N'gori uneasily, "this is a very high palaver, for many
  chiefs have risen and struck at the Government, and always Sandi has come
  with his soldiers, and there have been backs that have been sore for the
  space of a moon, and necks that have been sore for this time," he snapped
  finger, "and then have been sore no more."</p>

  <p>"Sandi has gone," said M'fosa.</p>

  <p>"Yet his fetish stands," insisted the old man; "all day and all night his
  dreadful spirit watches us; for this we have all seen that the very
  lightnings of M'shimba M'shamba run up that stick and do it no harm. Also
  M'ilitani and Moon-in-the-Eye&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"They are fools," a counsellor broke in.</p>

  <p>"Lord M'ilitani is no fool, this I know," interrupted a fourth.</p>

  <p>"Tibbetti comes&mdash;and brings no soldiers. Now I tell you my mind that
  Sandi's fetish is dead&mdash;as Sandi has passed from us, and this is the
  sign I desire&mdash;I and my young men. We shall make a killing palaver in
  the face of the killing stick, and if Sandi lives and has not lied to us, he
  shall come from the end of the world as he said."</p>

  <p>He rose up from the ground. There was no doubt now who ruled the
  Akasava.</p>

  <p>"The palaver is finished," he said, and led the way back to the city, his
  father meekly following in the rear.</p>

  <p>Two days later Bones arrived at the city of the Akasava, bringing with him
  no greater protection than a Houssa orderly afforded.</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">ON a certain night in September Mr. Commissioner Sanders was
  the guest of the Colonial Secretary at his country seat in Berkshire.</p>

  <p>Sanders, who was no society man, either by training or by inclination,
  would have preferred wandering aimlessly about the brilliantly lighted
  streets of London, but the engagement was a long-standing one. In a sense he
  was a lion against his will. His name was known, people had written of his
  character and his sayings; he had even, to his own amazement, delivered a
  lecture before the members of the Ethnological Society on "Native Folk-lore,"
  and had emerged from the ordeal triumphantly. The guests of Lord Castleberry
  found Sanders a shy, silent man who could not be induced to talk of the land
  he loved so dearly. They might have voted him a bore, but for the fact that
  he so completely effaced himself they had little opportunity for forming so
  definite a judgment.</p>

  <p>It was on the second night of his visit to Newbury Grange that they had
  cornered him in the billiard-room. It was the beautiful daughter of Lord
  Castleberry who, with the audacity of youth, forced him, metaphorically
  speaking, into a corner, from whence there was no escape.</p>

  <p>"We've been very patient, Mr. Sanders," she pouted; "we are all dying to
  hear of your wonderful country, and Bosambo, and fetishes and things, and you
  haven't said a word."</p>

  <p>"There is little to say," he smiled; "perhaps if I told you&mdash;
  something about fetishes...?"</p>

  <p>There was a chorus of approval.</p>

  <p>Sanders had gained enough courage from his experience before the
  Ethnological Society, and began to talk.</p>

  <p>"Wait," said Lady Betty; "let's have all these glaring lights out
  &mdash;they limit our imagination."</p>

  <p>There was a click, and, save for one bracket light behind Sanders, the
  room was in darkness. He was grateful to the girl, and well rewarded her and
  the party that sat round on chairs, on benches around the edge of the
  billiard-table, listening. He told them stories... curious, unbelievable; of
  ghost palavers, of strange rites, of mysterious messages carried across the
  great space of forests.</p>

  <p>"Tell us about fetishes," said the girl's voice.</p>

  <p>Sanders smiled. There rose to his eyes the spectacle of a hot and weary
  people bringing in a giant tree through the forest, inch by inch.</p>

  <p>And he told the story of the fetish of the Akasava.</p>

  <p>"And I said," he concluded, "that I would come from the end of the
  world&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped suddenly and stared straight ahead. In the faint light they saw
  him stiffen like a setter.</p>

  <p>"What is wrong?"</p>

  <p>Lord Castleberry was on his feet, and somebody clicked on the lights.</p>

  <p>But Sanders did not notice.</p>

  <p>He was looking towards the end of the room, and his face was set and
  hard.</p>

  <p>"O, M'fosa," he snarled, "O, dog!"</p>

  <p>They heard the strange staccato of the Bomongo tongue and wondered.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Lieutenant Tibbetts, helmetless, his coat torn, his lip
  bleeding, offered no resistance when they strapped him to the smooth high
  pole. Almost at his feet lay the dead Houssa orderly whom M'fosa had struck
  down from behind.</p>

  <p>In a wide circle, their faces half revealed by the crackling fire which
  burnt in the centre, the people of the Akasava city looked on
  impressively.</p>

  <p>N'gori, the chief, his brows all wrinkled in terror, his shaking hands at
  his mouth in a gesture of fear, was no more than a spectator, for his
  masterful son limped from side to side, consulting his counsellors.</p>

  <p>Presently the men who had bound Bones stepped aside, their work completed,
  and M'fosa came limping across to his prisoners.</p>

  <p>"Now," he mocked. "Is it hard for you this fetish stick which Sandi has
  placed?"</p>

  <p>"You're a low cad," said Bones, dropping into English in his wrath.
  "You're a low, beastly bounder, an' I'm simply disgusted with you."</p>

  <p>"What does he say?" they asked M'fosa.</p>

  <p>"He speaks to his gods in his own tongue," answered the limper; "for he is
  greatly afraid."</p>

  <p>Lieutenant Tibbetts went on:</p>

  <p>"Hear," said he in fluent and vitriolic Bomongo&mdash;for he was using
  that fisher dialect which he knew so much better than the more sonorous
  tongue of the Upper River&mdash;"O hear, eater of fish, O lame dog, O
  nameless child of a monkey!"</p>

  <p>M'fosa's lips went up one-sidedly.</p>

  <p>"Lord," said he softly, "presently you shall say no more, for I will cut
  your tongue out that you shall be lame of speech... afterwards I will burn
  you and the fetish stick, so that you all tumble together."</p>

  <p>"Be sure you will tumble into hell," said Bones cheerfully, "and that
  quickly, for you have offended Sandi's Ju-ju, which is powerful and
  terrible."</p>

  <p>If he could gain time&mdash;time for some miraculous news to come to
  Hamilton, who, blissfully unconscious of the treachery to his
  second-in-command, was sleeping twenty miles downstream&mdash;unconscious,
  too, of the Akasava fleet of canoes which was streaming towards his little
  steamer.</p>

  <p>Perhaps M'fosa guessed his thoughts.</p>

  <p>"You die alone, Tibbetti," he said, "though I planned a great death for
  you, with Bosambo at your side; and in the matter of ju-jus, behold! you
  shall call for Sandi&mdash;whilst you have a tongue."</p>

  <p>He took from the raw-hide sheath that was strapped to the calf of his bare
  leg, a short N'gombi knife, and drew it along the palm of his hand.</p>

  <p>"Call now, O Moon-in-the-Eye!" he scoffed.</p>

  <p>Bones saw the horror and braced himself to meet it.</p>

  <p>"O Sandi!" cried M'fosa, "O planter of ju-ju, come quickly!"</p>

  <p>"Dog!"</p>

  <p>M'fosa whipped round, the knife dropping from his hand.</p>

  <p>He knew the voice, was paralysed by the concentrated malignity in the
  voice.</p>

  <p>There stood Sandi&mdash;not half a dozen paces from him.</p>

  <p>A Sandi in strange black clothing with a big white-breasted shirt... but
  Sandi, hard-eyed and threatening.</p>

  <p>"Lord, lord!" he stammered, and put up his hands to his eyes.</p>

  <p>He looked again&mdash;the figure had vanished.</p>

  <p>"Magic!" he mumbled, and lurched forward in terror and hate to finish his
  work.</p>

  <p>Then through the crowd stalked a tall man.</p>

  <p>A rope of monkeys' tails covers one broad shoulder; his left arm and hand
  were hidden by an oblong shield of hide.</p>

  <p>In one hand he held a slim throwing spear and this he balanced
  delicately.</p>

  <p>"I am Bosambo of the Ochori," he said magnificently and unnecessarily;
  "you sent for me and I have come&mdash;bringing a thousand spears."</p>

  <p>M'fosa blinked, but said nothing.</p>

  <p>"On the river," Bosambo went on, "I met many canoes that went to a
  killing&mdash;behold!"</p>

  <p>It was the head of M'fosa's lieutenant, who had charge of the surprise
  party.</p>

  <p>For a moment M'fosa looked, then turned to leap, and Bosambo's spear
  caught him in mid-air.</p>

  <p>"Jolly old Bosambo!" muttered Bones, and fainted.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Four thousand miles away Sanders was offering his apologies
  to a startled company.</p>

  <p>"I could have sworn I saw&mdash;something," he said, and he told no more
  stories that night.</p>

  <p class="first">TO understand this story you must know that at one point of

  <p>If Downing Street were to send that frantic code-wire to "Polonius" to
  Hamilton in these days he could not obey the instructions, for reasons which
  I will give. As a matter of fact the code has now been changed, Lieutenant
  Tibbetts being mainly responsible for the alteration.</p>

  <p>Hamilton, in his severest mood, wrote a letter to Bones, and it is worth
  reproducing.</p>

  <p>That Bones was living a dozen yards from Captain Hamilton, and that they
  shared a common mess-table, adds rather than distracts from the seriousness
  of the correspondence. The letter ran:</p>

  <p>"The Residency, "September 24th.</p>

  <p>"From Officer commanding Houssas detachment Headquarters, to Officer
  commanding "B" company of Houssas.</p>

  <p>"Sir,&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I have the honour to direct your attention to that paragraph of King's
  regulations which directs that an officer's sole attention should be
  concentrated upon executing the lawful commands of his superior.</p>

  <p>"I have had occasion recently to correct a certain tendency on your part
  to employing War Department property and the servants of the Crown for your
  own special use. I need hardly point out to you that such conduct on your
  part is subversive to discipline and directly contrary to the spirit and
  letter of regulations. More especially would I urge the impropriety of
  utilizing government telegraph lines for the purpose of securing information
  regarding your gambling transactions. Matters have now reached a very serious
  crisis, and I feel sure that you will see the necessity for refraining from
  these breaches of discipline.</p>

  <p>"I have the honour to be, sir, "Your obedient servant, "P. G. Hamilton,
  'Captain.'"</p>

  <p>When two white men, the only specimen of their race and class within a
  radius of hundreds of miles, are living together in an isolated post, they
  either hate or tolerate one another. The exception must always be found in
  two men of a similar service having similar objects to gain, and infused with
  a common spirit of endeavour.</p>

  <p>Fortunately neither Lieutenant Tibbetts nor his superior were long enough
  associated to get upon one another's nerves.</p>

  <p>Lieutenant Tibbetts received this letter while he was shaving, and came
  across the parade ground outrageously attired in his pyjamas and his helmet.
  Clambering up the wooden stairs, his slippers flap-flapping across the broad
  verandah, he burst into the chief's bedroom, interrupting a stern and frigid
  Captain Hamilton in the midst of his early morning coffee and roll.</p>

  <p>"Look here, old sport," said Bones, indignantly waving a frothy shaving
  brush at the other, "what the dooce is all this about?"</p>

  <p>He displayed a crumpled letter.</p>

  <p>"Lieutenant Tibbetts," said Hamilton of the Houssas severely, "have you no
  sense of decency?"</p>

  <p>"Sense of decency, my dear old thing!" repeated Bones. "I am simply full
  of it. That is why I have come."</p>

  <p>A terrible sight was Bones at that early hour with the open pyjama jacket
  showing his scraggy neck, with his fish mouth drooping dismally, his round,
  staring eyes and his hair rumpled up, one frantic tuft at the back standing
  up in isolation.</p>

  <p>Hamilton stared at him, and it was the stern stare of a disciplinarian.
  But Bones was not to be put out of countenance by so small a thing as an icy
  glance.</p>

  <p>"There is no sense in getting peevish with me, old Ham," he said,
  squatting down on the nearest chair; "this is what I call a stupid,
  officious, unnecessary letter. Why this haughtiness? Why these crushing
  inferences? Why this unkindness to poor old Bones?"</p>

  <p>"The fact of it is, Bones," said Hamilton, accepting the situation, "you
  are spending too much of your time in the telegraph station."</p>

  <p>Bones got up slowly.</p>

  <p>"Captain Hamilton, sir!" he said reproachfully, "after all I have done for
  you."</p>

  <p>"Beyond selling me one of your beastly sweepstake tickets for five
  shillings," said Hamilton, unpleasantly; "a ticket which I dare say you have
  taken jolly good care will not win a prize, I fail to see in what manner you
  have helped me. Now, Bones, you will have to pay more attention to your work.
  There is no sense in slacking; we will have Sanders back here before we know
  where we are, and when he starts nosing round there will be a lot of trouble.
  Besides, you are shirking."</p>

  <p>"Me!" gasped Bones, outraged. "Me&mdash;shirking? You forget yourself,
  sir!"</p>

  <p>Even Bones could not be dignified with a lather brush in one hand and a
  half-shaven cheek, testifying to the hastiness of his departure from his
  quarters.</p>

  <p>"I only wish to say, sir," said Bones, "that during the period I have had
  the honour to serve under your command I have settled possibly more palavers
  of a distressingly ominous character than the average Commissioner is called
  upon to settle in the course of a year."</p>

  <p>"As you have created most of the palavers yourself," said Hamilton
  unkindly, "I do not deny this. In other words, you have got yourself into
  more tangles, and you've had to crawl out more often."</p>

  <p>"It is useless appealing to your better nature, sir," said Bones.</p>

  <p>He saluted with the hand that held the lather brush, turned about like an
  automaton, tripped over the mat, recovered himself with an effort, and
  preserving what dignity a man can preserve in pink-striped pyjamas and a sun
  helmet, stalked majestically back to his quarters. Half-way across he
  remembered something and came doubling back, clattering into Hamilton's room
  unceremoniously.</p>

  <p>"There is one thing I forgot to say," he said, "about those sweepstake
  tickets. If I happen to be killed on any future expedition that you may send
  me, you will understand that the whole of my moveable property is yours,
  absolutely. And I may add, sir," he said at the doorway with one hand on the
  lintel ready to execute a strategic flank movement out of range, "that with
  this legacy I offer you my forgiveness for the perfectly beastly time you
  have given me. Good morning, sir."</p>

  <p>There was a commanding officer's parade of Houssas at noon. It was not
  until he stalked across the square and clicked his heels together as he
  reported the full strength of his company present that Hamilton saw his
  subordinate again.</p>

  <p>The parade over, Bones went huffily to his quarters.</p>

  <p>He was hurt. To be told he had been shirking his duty touched a very
  tender and sensitive spot of his.</p>

  <p>In preparation for the movement which he had expected to make he had kept
  his company on the move for a fortnight. For fourteen terrible days in all
  kinds of weather, he had worked like a native in the forest; with sham fights
  and blank cartridge attacks upon imaginary positions, with scaling of
  stockades and building of bridges&mdash;all work at which his soul
  revolted&mdash;to be told at the end he had shirked his work!</p>

  <p>Certainly he had come down to headquarters more often perhaps than was
  necessary, but then he was properly interested in the draw of a continental
  sweepstake which might, with any kind of luck, place him in the possession of
  a considerable fortune. Hamilton was amiable at lunch, even communicative at
  dinner, and for him rather serious.</p>

  <p>For if the truth be told he was desperately worried. The cause was, as it
  had often been with Sanders, that French-German-Belgian territory which
  adjoins the Ochori country. All the bad characters, not only the French of
  the Belgian Congo, but of the badly-governed German lands&mdash;all the tax
  resisters, the murderers, and the criminals of every kind, but the lawless
  contingents of every nation, formed a floating nomadic population in the
  tree-covered hills which lay beyond the country governed by Bosambo.</p>

  <p>Of late there had been a larger break-away than usual. A strong force of
  rebellious natives was reported to be within a day's march of the Ochori
  boundary. This much Hamilton knew. But he had known of such occurrences
  before; not once, but a score of times had alarming news come from the French
  border.</p>

  <p>He had indeed made many futile trips into the heart of the Ochori
  country.</p>

  <p>Forced marches through little known territory, and long and tiring waits
  for the invader that never came, had dulled his senses of apprehension. He
  had to take a chance. The Administrator's office would warn him from time to
  time, and ask him conventionally to make his arrangements to meet all
  contingencies and Sanders would as conventionally reply that the condition of
  affairs on the Ochori border was engaging his most earnest attention.</p>

  <p>"What is the use of worrying about it now?" asked Bones at dinner.</p>

  <p>Hamilton shook his head.</p>

  <p>"There was a certain magic in old Sanders' name," he said.</p>

  <p>Bones' lips pursed.</p>

  <p>"My dear old chap," he said, "there is a bit of magic in mine."</p>

  <p>"I have not noticed it," said Hamilton.</p>

  <p>"I am getting awfully popular as a matter of fact," said Bones
  complacently. "The last time I was up the river, Bosambo came ten miles down
  stream to meet me and spend the day."</p>

  <p>"Did you lose anything?" asked Hamilton ungraciously.</p>

  <p>Bones thought.</p>

  <p>"Now you come to mention it," he said slowly, "I did lose quite a lot of
  things, but dear old Bosambo wouldn't play a dirty trick on a pal. I know
  Bosambo."</p>

  <p>"If there is one thing more evident than another," said Hamilton, "it is
  that you do not know Bosambo."</p>

  <p>Hamilton was wakened at three in the next morning by the telegraph
  operator. It was a "clear the line" message, coded from headquarters, and
  half awake he went into Sanders' study and put it into plain English.</p>

  <p>"Hope you are watching the Ochori border," it ran, "representations from
  French Government to the effect that a crossing is imminent."</p>

  <p>He pulled his mosquito boots on over his pyjamas, struggled into a coat
  and crossed to Lieutenant Tibbetts' quarters.</p>

  <p>Bones occupied a big hut at the end of the Houssa lines, and Hamilton woke
  him by the simple expedient of flashing his electric hand lamp in his
  face.</p>

  <p>"I have had a telegram," he said, and Bones leapt out of bed wide awake in
  an instant.</p>

  <p>"I knew jolly well I would draw a horse," he said exultantly. "I had a
  dream&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Be serious, you feather-minded devil."</p>

  <p>With that Hamilton handed him the telegram.</p>

  <p>Bones read it carefully, and interpreted any meanings into its
  construction which it could not possibly bear.</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"There is only one thing to do," said Hamilton. "We shall have to take all
  the men we can possibly muster, and go north at daybreak."</p>

  <p>"Spoken like a jolly old Hannibal," said Bones heartily, and smacked his
  superior on the back. A shrill bugle call aroused the sleeping lines, and
  Hamilton went back to his quarters to make preparations for the journey. In
  the first grey light of dawn he flew three pigeons to Bosambo, and the
  message they carried about their red legs was brief.</p>

  <p>"Take your fighting regiments to the edge of Frenchi land; presently I
  will come with my soldiers and support you. Let no foreigner pass on your
  life and on your head."</p>

  <p>When the rising sun tipped the tops of the palms with gold, and the wild
  world was filled with the sound of the birds, the <i>Zaire</i>, her decks
  alive with soldiers, began her long journey northward.</p>

  <p>Just before the boat left, Hamilton received a further message from the
  Administrator. It was in plain English, some evidence of Sir Robert
  Sanleigh's haste.</p>

  <p>"Confidential: This matter on the Ochori border extremely delicate.
  Complete adequate arrangements to keep in touch with me."</p>

  <p>For one moment Hamilton conceived the idea of leaving Bones behind to deal
  with the telegram and come along. A little thought, however, convinced him of
  the futility of this method. For one thing he would want every bit of
  assistance he could get, and although Bones had his disadvantages he was an
  excellent soldier, and a loyal and gallant comrade.</p>

  <p>It might be necessary for Hamilton to divide up his forces; in which case
  he could hardly dispense with Lieutenant Tibbetts, and he explained
  unnecessarily to Bones:</p>

  <p>"I think you are much better under my eye where I can see what you're
  doing."</p>

  <p>"Sir," said Bones very seriously, "it is not what I do, it is what I
  think. If you could only see my brain at work&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ha, ha!" said Hamilton rudely.</p>

  <p>For at least three days relations were strained between the two officers.
  Bones was a man who admitted at regular intervals that he was unduly
  sensitive. He had explained this disadvantage to Hamilton at various times,
  but the Houssa stolidly refused to remember the fact.</p>

  <p>Most of the way up the river Hamilton attended to his business
  navigation&mdash;he knew the stream very well&mdash;whilst Bones, in a cabin
  which had been rigged up for him in the after part of the ship, played
  Patience, and by a systematic course of cheating himself was able to
  accomplish marvels. They found the Ochori city deserted save for a strong
  guard, for Bosambo had marched the day previous; sending a war call through
  the country.</p>

  <p>He had started with a thousand spears, and his force was growing in
  snowball fashion as he progressed through the land. The great road which
  Notiki, the northern chief, had started by way of punishment was beginning to
  take shape. Bosambo had moved with incredible swiftness.</p>

  <p>Too swift, indeed, for a certain Angolian-Congo robber who had headed a
  villainous pilgrimage to a land which, as he had predicted, flowed with milk
  and honey; was guarded by timorous men and mainly populated by slim and
  beautiful maidens. The Blue Books on this migration gave this man's name as
  Kisini, but he was in fact an Angolian named Bizaro&mdash;a composite name
  which smacks suspiciously of Portuguese influence.</p>

  <p>Many times had the unruly people and the lawless bands which occupied the
  forest beyond the Ochori threatened to cross into British territory. But the
  dangers of the unknown, the awful stories of a certain white lord who was
  swift to avenge and monstrously inquisitive had held them. Year after year
  there had grown up tribes within tribes, tiny armed camps that had only this
  in common, that they were outside the laws from which they had fled, and that
  somewhere to the southward and the eastward were strong forces flying the
  tricolour of France or the yellow star of the Belgian Congo, ready to belch
  fire at them, if they so much as showed their flat noses.</p>

  <p>It would have needed a Napoleon to have combined all the conflicting
  forces, to have lulled all the mutual suspicions, and to have moulded these
  incompatible particles into a whole; but, Bizaro, like many another vain and
  ambitious man, had sought by means of a great palaver to produce a feeling of
  security sufficiently soothing to the nerves and susceptibilities of all
  elements, to create something like a nationality of these scattered remnants
  of the nations.</p>

  <p>And though he failed, he did succeed in bringing together four or five of
  the camps, and it was this news carried to the French Governor by spies,
  transmitted to Downing Street, and flashed back again to the Coast, which set
  Hamilton and his Houssas moving; which brought a regiment of the King's
  African Rifles to the Coast ready to reinforce the earlier expedition, and
  which (more to the point) had put Bosambo's war drums rumbling from one end
  of the Ochori to the other.</p>

  <p>Bizaro, mustering his force, came gaily through the sun-splashed aisles of
  the forest, his face streaked hideously with camwood, his big elephant spear
  twirled between his fingers, and behind him straggled his cosmopolitan
  force.</p>

  <p>There were men from the Congo and the French Congo; men from German lands;
  from Angola; wanderers from far-off Barotseland, who had drifted on to the
  Congo by the swift and yellow Kasai. There were hunters from the forests of
  far-off Bongindanga where the <i>okapi</i> roams. For each man's presence in
  that force there was good and sinister reason, for these were no mere
  tax-evaders, poor, starved wretches fleeing from the rule which <i>Bula
  Matadi</i>[4] imposed. There was a blood price on almost every head, and in a
  dozen prisons at Boma, at Brazaville, and Equatorville, and as far south as
  St. Paul de Loduda, there were leg-irons which had at some time or other
  fitted their scarred ankles.</p>

  <p>[Footnote 4: The stone breaker, the native name for the Congo
  Government.]</p>

  <p>Now there are four distinct physical features which mark the border line
  between the border land and the foreign territory. Mainly the line is a
  purely imaginary one, not traceable save by the most delicate
  instruments&mdash;a line which runs through a tangle of forest.</p>

  <p>But the most noticeable crossing place is N'glili.[5]</p>

  <p>[Footnote 5: Probably a corruption of the word "English."]</p>

  <p>Here a little river, easily fordable, and not more than a dozen spear
  lengths across flows from one wood into another. Between the two woods is a
  clear space of thick grass and shrub. In the spring of the year the banks of
  the stream are white with arum-lilies, and the field beyond, at a later
  period, is red with wild anemone.</p>

  <p>The dour fugitives on the other side of the stream have a legend that
  those who safely cross the "Field of Blood"&mdash;so they call the
  anemone-sprinkled land beyond&mdash;without so much as crushing a flower may
  claim sanctuary under the British flag.</p>

  <p>So that when Bizaro sighted the stream, and the two tall trees that
  flanked the ford, from afar off and said: "To-day we will walk between the
  flowers," he was signifying the definite character of his plans.</p>

  <p>"Master," said one of the more timid of his muster, when they had halted
  for a rest in sight of the promised land, "what shall we do when we come to
  these strange places?"</p>

  <p>"We shall defeat all manner of men," said Bizaro optimistically.
  "Afterwards they shall come and sue for peace, and they shall give us a wide
  land where we may build us huts and sow our corn. And they also will give us
  women, and we shall settle in comfort, and I will be chief over you. And,
  growing with the moons, in time I shall make you a great nation."</p>

  <p>They might have crossed the stream that evening and committed themselves
  irrevocably to their invasion. Bizaro was a criminal, and a lazy man, and he
  decided to sleep where he was&mdash;an act fatal to the smooth performance of
  his enterprise, for when in the early hours of the morning he marched his
  horde to the N'glili river he found two thousand spears lining the opposite
  bank, and they were under a chief who was at once insolent and unmoved by
  argument.</p>

  <p>"O chief," said Bosambo pleasantly, "you do not cross my beautiful flowers
  to-day."</p>

  <p>"Lord," said Bizaro humbly, "we are poor men who desire a new land."</p>

  <p>"That you shall have," said Bosambo grimly, "for I have sent my warriors
  to dig big holes wherein you may take your rest in this land you desire."</p>

  <p>An unhappy Bizaro carried his six hundred spears slowly back to the land
  from whence he had come and found on return to the mixed tribes that he had
  unconsciously achieved a miracle. For the news of armed men by the N'glili
  river carried terror to these evil men&mdash;they found themselves between
  two enemies and chose the force which they feared least.</p>

  <p>On the fourth day following his interview with Bosambo, Bizaro led five
  thousand desperate men to the ford and there was a sanguinary battle which
  lasted for the greater part of the morning and was repeated at sundown.</p>

  <p>Hamilton brought his Houssas up in the nick of time, when one wing of
  Bosambo's force was being thrust back and when Bizaro's desperate adventurers
  had gained the Ochori bank. Hamilton came through the clearing, and formed
  his men rapidly.</p>

  <p>Sword in hand, in advance of the glittering bayonets, Bones raced across
  the red field, and after one brief and glorious melee the invader was driven
  back, and a dropping fire from the left, as the Houssas shot steadily at the
  flying enemy, completed the disaster to Bizaro's force.</p>

  <p>"That settles <i>that</i>!" said Hamilton.</p>

  <p>He had pitched his camp on the scene of his exploit, the bivouac fires of
  the Houssas gleamed redly amongst the anemones.</p>

  <p>"Did you see me in action?" asked Bones, a little self-consciously.</p>

  <p>"No, I didn't notice anything particularly striking about the fight in
  your side of the world," said Hamilton.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you did not see me bowl over a big Congo chap?" asked Bones,
  carelessly, as he opened a tin of preserved tongue. "Two at once I bowled
  over," he repeated.</p>

  <p>"What do you expect me to do?" asked Hamilton unpleasantly. "Get up and
  cheer, or recommend you for the Victoria Cross or something?"</p>

  <p>Bones carefully speared a section of tongue from the open tin before he
  replied.</p>

  <p>"I had not thought about the Victoria Cross, to tell you the truth," he
  admitted; "but if you feel that you ought to recommend me for something or
  other for conspicuous courage in the face of the enemy, do not let your
  friendship stand in the way."</p>

  <p>"I will not," said Hamilton.</p>

  <p>There was a little pause, then without raising his eyes from the task in
  hand which was at that precise moment the covering of a biscuit with a large
  and generous layer of marmalade, Bones went on.</p>

  <p>"I practically saved the life of one of Bosambo's headmen. He was on the
  ground and three fellows were jabbing at him. The moment they saw me they
  dropped their spears and fled."</p>

  <p>"I expect it was your funny nose that did the trick," said Hamilton
  unimpressed.</p>

  <p>"I stood there," Bones went on loftily ignoring the gratuitous insult,
  "waiting for anything that might turn up; exposed, dear old fellow, to every
  death-dealing missile, but calmly directing, if you will allow me to say so,
  the tide of battle. It was," he added modestly, "one of the bravest deeds I
  ever saw."</p>

  <p>He waited, but Hamilton had his mouth full of tongue sandwich.</p>

  <p>"If you mention me in dispatches," Bones went on suggestively.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry&mdash;I shan't," said Hamilton.</p>

  <p>"But if you did," persisted Lieutenant Tibbetts, poising his sticky
  biscuit, "I can only say&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The marmalade is running down your sleeve," said Hamilton; "shut up,
  Bones, like a good chap."</p>

  <p>Bones sighed.</p>

  <p>"The fact of it is, Hamilton," he was frank enough to say, "I have been
  serving so far without hope of reward and scornful of honour, but now I have
  reached the age and the position in life where I feel I am entitled to some
  slight recognition to solace my declining years."</p>

  <p>"How long have you been in the army?" asked Hamilton, curiously.</p>

  <p>"Eighteen months," replied Bones; "nineteen months next week, and it's a
  jolly long time, I can tell you, sir."</p>

  <p>Leaving his dissatisfied subordinate, Hamilton made the round of the camp.
  The red field, as he called it, was in reality a low-lying meadow, which rose
  steeply to the bank of the river on the one side and more steeply&mdash;since
  it first sloped downward in that direction&mdash;to the Ochori forest, two
  miles away. He made this discovery with a little feeling of alarm. He knew
  something of native tactics, and though his scouts had reported that the
  enemy was effectually routed, and that the nearest body was five miles away,
  he put a strong advance picquet on the other side of the river, and threw a
  wide cordon of sentries about the camp. Especially he apportioned Abiboo, his
  own sergeant, the task of watching the little river which flowed swiftly
  between its orderly banks past the sunken camp. For two days Abiboo watched
  and found nothing to report.</p>

  <p>Not so the spies who were keeping watch upon the moving remnants of
  Bizaro's army.</p>

  <p>They came with the news that the main body had mysteriously disappeared.
  To add to Hamilton's anxiety he received a message by way of headquarters and
  the Ochori city from the Administrator.</p>

  <p>"Be prepared at the first urgent message from myself to fall back on the
  Ochori city. German Government claim that whole of country for two miles
  north of river N'glili is their territory. Most delicate situation.
  International complications feared. Rely on your discretion, but move swiftly
  if you receive orders."</p>

  <p>"Leave this to me," said Bones when Hamilton read the message out; "did I
  ever tell you, sir, that I was intended for the diplomatic
  service&mdash;"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The truth about the Ochori border has never been thoroughly
  exposed. If you get into your mind the fact that the Imperialists of four
  nations were dreaming dreams of a trans-African railway which was to tap the
  resources of the interior, and if you remember that each patriotic dreamer
  conceived a different kind of railway according to his nationality and that
  they only agreed upon one point, namely, that the line must point contiguous
  with the Ochori border, you may understand dimly some reason for the frantic
  claim that that little belt of territory, two miles wide, was part of the
  domain of each and every one of the contestants.</p>

  <p>When the news was flashed to Europe that a party of British Houssas were
  holding the banks of the N'glili river, and had inflicted a loss upon a force
  of criminals, the approval which civilization should rightly have bestowed
  upon Captain Hamilton and his heroic lieutenant was tempered largely by the
  question as to whether Captain Hamilton and his Houssas had any right
  whatever to be upon "the red field." And in consequence the telegraph lines
  between Berlin and Paris and Paris and London and London and Brussels were
  kept fairly busy with passionate statements of claims couched in the stilted
  terminology of diplomacy.</p>

  <p>England could not recede from the position she had taken. This she said in
  French and in German, and in her own perfidious tongue. She stated this
  uncompromisingly, but at the same time sent secret orders to withdraw the
  force that was the bone of contention. This order she soon countermanded. A
  certain speech delivered by a too voluble Belgian minister was responsible
  for the stiffening of her back, and His Excellency the Administrator of the
  territory received official instructions in the middle of the night: "Tell
  Hamilton to stay where he is and hold border against all comers."</p>

  <p>This message was re-transmitted.</p>

  <p>Now there is in existence in the British Colonial Service, and in all
  branches which affect the agents and the servants of the Colonial Office, an
  emergency code which is based upon certain characters in Shakespearean
  plays.</p>

  <p>I say "there is"; perhaps it would be better and more to the point if I
  said "there was," since the code has been considerably amended.</p>

  <p>Thus, be he sub-inspector or commissioner, or chief of local native police
  who receives the word "Ophelia," he knows without consulting any book that
  "Ophelia" means "unrest of natives reported in your district, please report";
  or if it be "Polonius" it signifies to him&mdash;and this he knows without
  confirming his knowledge&mdash;that he must move steadily forward. Or if it
  be "Banquo" he reads into it, "Hold your position till further orders." And
  "Banquo" was the word that the Administrator telegraphed.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Sergeant Abiboo had sat by the flowing N'glili river without
  noticing any slackening of its strength or challenging of its depth.</p>

  <p>There was reason for this.</p>

  <p>Bizaro, who was in the forest ten miles to the westward, and working
  moreover upon a piece of native strategy which natives the world over had
  found successful, saw that it was unnecessary to dam the river and divert the
  stream.</p>

  <p>Nature had assisted him to a marvellous degree. He had followed the stream
  through the forest until he reached a place where it was a quarter of a mile
  wide, so wide and so newly spread that the water reached half-way up the
  trunks of the sodden and dying trees.</p>

  <p>Moreover, there was a bank through which a hundred men might cut a breach
  in a day or so, even though they went about their work most leisurely, being
  constitutionally averse to manual labour.</p>

  <p>Bizaro was no engineer, but he had all the forest man's instincts of
  water-levels. There was a clear run down to the meadows beyond that, as he
  said, he "smelt."</p>

  <p>"We will drown these dogs," he said to his headman, "and afterwards we
  will walk into the country and take it for our own."</p>

  <p>Hamilton had been alive to the danger of such an attack. He saw by certain
  indications of the soil that this great shallow valley had been inundated
  more than once, though probably many years had passed since the last overflow
  of water. Yet he could not move from where he had planted himself without
  risking the displeasure of his chief and without also risking very serious
  consequences in other directions.</p>

  <p>Bosambo, frankly bored, was all for retiring his men to the comforts of
  the Ochori city.</p>

  <p>"Lord, why do we sit here?" he asked, "looking at this little stream which
  has no fish and at this great ugly country, when I have my beautiful city for
  your lordship's reception, and dancing folk and great feasts?"</p>

  <p>"A doocid sensible idea," murmured Bones.</p>

  <p>"I wait for a book," answered Hamilton shortly. "If you wish to go, you
  may take your soldiers and leave me."</p>

  <p>"Lord," said Bosambo, "you put shame on me," and he looked his
  reproach.</p>

  <p>"I am really surprised at you, Hamilton," murmured Bones.</p>

  <p>"Keep your infernal comments to yourself," snapped his superior. "I tell
  you I must wait for my instructions."</p>

  <p>He was a silent man for the rest of the evening, and had settled himself
  down in his canvas chair to doze away the night, when a travel-stained
  messenger came from the Ochori and he brought a telegram of one word.</p>

  <p>Hamilton looked at it, he looked too with a frown at the figures that
  preceded it.</p>

  <p>"And what you mean," he muttered, "the Lord knows!"</p>

  <p>The word, however, was sufficiently explicit. A bugle call brought the
  Houssas into line and the tapping of Bosambo's drums assembled his
  warriors.</p>

  <p>Within half an hour of the receipt of the message Hamilton's force was on
  the move.</p>

  <p>They crossed the great stretch of meadow in the darkness and were climbing
  up towards the forest when a noise like thunder broke upon their ears.</p>

  <p>Such a roaring, crashing, hissing of sound came nearer and nearer,
  increasing in volume every second. The sky was clear, and one swift glance
  told Hamilton that it was not a storm he had to fear. And then it came upon
  him, and he realized what this commotion meant.</p>

  <p>"Run!" he cried, and with one accord naked warriors and uniformed Houssas
  fled through the darkness to the higher ground. The water came rushing about
  Hamilton's ankles, one man slipped back again into the flood and was hauled
  out again by Bones, exclaiming loudly his own act lest it should have escaped
  the attention of his superior, and the party reached safety without the loss
  of a man.</p>

  <p>"Just in time," said Hamilton grimly. "I wonder if the Administrator knew
  this was going to happen?"</p>

  <p>They came to the Ochori by easy marches, and Hamilton wrote a long wire to
  headquarters sending it on ahead by a swift messenger.</p>

  <p>It was a dispatch which cleared away many difficulties, for the disputed
  territory was for everlasting under water, and where the "red field" had
  blazed brilliantly was a calm stretch of river two miles wide filled with
  strange silent brown objects that floated and bobbed to the movement of the
  tide. These were the men who in their folly had loosened the waters and died
  of their rashness. Most notable of these was Bizaro.</p>

  <p>There was a shock waiting for Hamilton when he reached the Ochori city.
  The wire from the Administrator was kindly enough and sufficiently approving
  to satisfy even an exigent Bones. "But," it ran, "why did you retire in face
  of stringent orders to remain? I wired you 'Banquo.'"</p>

  <p>Hamilton afterwards learnt that the messenger carrying this important
  dispatch had passed his party in their retirement through the forest.</p>

  <p>"Banquo," quoted Hamilton in amazement. "I received absolute instructions
  to retire."</p>

  <p>"Hard cheese," said Bones, sympathetically. "His dear old Excellency wants
  a good talking to; but are you sure, dear old chap, that you haven't made a
  mistake."</p>

  <p>"Here it is," he said, "but I must confess that I don't understand the
  numbers."</p>

  <p>He handed it to Bones. It read:</p>

  <p>"Mercutio 17178."</p>

  <p>Bones looked at it a moment, then gasped. He reached out his hand solemnly
  and grasped that of the astounded Hamilton.</p>

  <p>"Dear old fellow," he said in a broken voice, "Congratulate me, I have
  drawn a runner!"</p>

  <p>"A runner?"</p>

  <p>"A runner, dear old sport," chortled Bones, "in the Cambridgeshire! You
  see I've got a ticket number seventeen, seventeen eight in my pocket, dear
  old friend! If Mercutio wins," he repeated solemnly, "I will stand you the
  finest dinner that can be secured this side of Romano's."</p>

  <h3>First published as "The Book of Bones" in <i>The Weekly Tale-Teller</i>,
  21 Nov 1914</h3>

  <p class="first">MAIL DAY is ever a day of supreme interest for the young and
  for the matter of that for the middle-aged, too. Sanders hated mail days
  because the bulk of his correspondence had to do with Government, and
  Government never sat down with a pen in its hand to wish Sanders many happy
  returns of the day or to tell him scandalous stories about mutual
  friends.</p>

  <p>Rather the Government (by inference) told him scandalous stories about
  himself&mdash;of work not completed to the satisfaction of Downing
  Street&mdash;a thoroughfare given to expecting miracles.</p>

  <p>Hamilton had a sister who wrote wittily and charmingly every week, and
  there was another girl... Still, two letters and a bright pink paper or two
  made a modest postbag by the side of Lieutenant Tibbetts' mail.</p>

  <p>There came to Bones every mail day a thick wad of letters and parcels
  innumerable, and he could sit at the big table for hours on end, whistling a
  little out of tune, mumbling incoherently. He had a trick of commenting upon
  his letters aloud, which was very disconcerting for Hamilton. Bones wouldn't
  open a letter and get half-way through it before he began his commenting.</p>

  <p>"... poor soul... dear! dear!... what a silly old ass... ah, would you...
  don't do it, Billy...."</p>

  <p>To Hamilton's eyes the bulk of correspondence rather increased than
  diminished.</p>

  <p>"You must owe a lot of money," he said one day.</p>

  <p>"Eh!"</p>

  <p>"All these...!" Hamilton opened his hand to a floor littered with
  discarded envelopes. "I suppose they represent demands...."</p>

  <p>"Dear lad," said Bones brightly, "they represent popularity&mdash;I'm
  immensely popular, sir," he gulped a little as he fished out two dainty
  envelopes from the pile before him; "you may not have experienced the
  sensation, but I assure you, sir, it's pleasing, it's doocidly pleasing!"</p>

  <p>"Complacent ass," said Hamilton, and returned to his own
  correspondence.</p>

  <p>Systematically Bones went through his letters, now and again consulting a
  neat little morocco-covered note-book. (It would appear he kept a very
  careful record of every letter he wrote home, its contents, the date of its
  dispatch, and the reply thereto.) He had reduced letter writing to a passion,
  spent most of his evenings writing long epistles to his friends&mdash;mostly
  ladies of a tender age&mdash;and had incidentally acquired a reputation in
  the Old Country for his brilliant powers of narrative.</p>

  <p>This, Hamilton discovered quite by accident. It would appear that
  Hamilton's sister had been on a visit&mdash;was in fact on the visit when she
  wrote one letter which so opened Hamilton's eyes&mdash;and mentioned that she
  was staying with some great friends of Bones'. She did not, of course, call
  him "Bones," but "Mr. Tibbetts."</p>

  <p>"I should awfully like to meet him," she wrote, "he must be a very
  interesting man. Aggie Vernon had a letter from him yesterday wherein he
  described his awful experience lion-hunting.</p>

  <p>"To be chased by a lion and caught and then carried to the beast's lair
  must have been awful!</p>

  <p>"Mr. Tibbetts is very modest about it in his letter, and beyond telling
  Aggie that he escaped by sticking his finger in the lion's eye he says little
  of his subsequent adventure. By the way, Pat, Aggie tells me that you had a
  bad bout of fever and that Mr. Tibbetts carried you for some miles to the
  nearest doctor. I wish you wouldn't keep these things so secret, it worries
  me dreadfully unless you tell me&mdash;even the worst about yourself. I hope
  your interesting friend returned safely from his dangerous expedition into
  the interior&mdash;he was on the point of leaving when his letter was
  dispatched and was quite gloomy about his prospects...."</p>

  <p>Hamilton read this epistle over and over again, then he sent for
  Bones.</p>

  <p>That gentleman came most cheerfully, full of fine animal spirits,
  and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Just had a letter about you, Bones," said Hamilton carelessly.</p>

  <p>"About me, sir!" said Bones; "from the War Office&mdash;I'm not being
  decorated or anything!" he asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;nothing so tragic; it was a letter from my sister, who is
  staying with the Vernons."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" said Bones going suddenly red.</p>

  <p>"What a modest devil you are," said the admiring Hamilton, "having a lion
  hunt all to yourself and not saying a word about it to anybody."</p>

  <p>Bones made curious apologetic noises.</p>

  <p>"I didn't know there were any lions in the country," pursued Hamilton
  remorselessly. "Liars, yes! But lions, no! I suppose you brought them with
  you&mdash;and I suppose you know also, Bones, that it is considered in
  lion-hunting circles awfully rude to stick your finger into a lion's eye? It
  is bad sportsmanship to say the least, and frightfully painful for the
  lion."</p>

  <p>Bones was making distressful grimaces.</p>

  <p>"How would you like a lion to stick his finger in <i>your</i> eye?" asked
  Hamilton severely; "and, by the way, Bones, I have to thank you."</p>

  <p>He rose solemnly, took the hand of his reluctant and embarrassed second
  and wrung.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said Hamilton, in a broken voice, "for saving my life."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I say, sir," began Bones feebly.</p>

  <p>"To carry a man eighty miles on your back is no mean accomplishment,
  Bones&mdash;especially when I was unconscious&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't say you were unconscious, sir. In fact, sir&mdash;" floundered
  Lieutenant Tibbetts as red as a peony.</p>

  <p>"And yet I was unconscious," insisted Hamilton firmly. "I am still
  unconscious, even to this day. I have no recollection of your heroic effort,
  Bones, I thank you."</p>

  <p>"Well, sir," said Bones, "to make a clean breast of the whole affair
  &mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And this dangerous expedition of yours, Bones, an expedition from which
  you might never return&mdash;that," said Hamilton in a hushed voice, "is the
  best story I have heard for years."</p>

  <p>"Sir," said Bones, speaking under the stress of considerable emotion, "I
  am clean bowled, sir. The light-hearted fairy stories which I wrote to cheer,
  so to speak, the sick-bed of an innocent child, sir, they have recoiled upon
  my own head. <i>Peccavi, mea culpi</i>, an' all those jolly old expressions
  that you'll find in the back pages of the dictionary."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Bones, Bones!" chuckled Hamilton.</p>

  <p>"You mustn't think I'm a perfect liar, sir," began Bones, earnestly.</p>

  <p>"I don't think you're a perfect liar," answered Hamilton, "I think you're
  the most inefficient liar I've ever met."</p>

  <p>"Not even a liar, I'm a romancist, sir," Bones stiffened with dignity and
  saluted, but whether he was saluting Hamilton, or the spirit of Romance, or
  in sheer admiration was saluting himself, Hamilton did not know.</p>

  <p>"The fact is, sir," said Bones confidentially, "I'm writing a book!"</p>

  <p>He stepped back as though to better observe the effect of his words.</p>

  <p>"What about?" asked Hamilton, curiously.</p>

  <p>"About things I've seen and things I know," said Bones, in his most
  impressive manner.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I see!" said Hamilton, "one of those waistcoat pocket books."</p>

  <p>Bones swallowed the insult with a gulp.</p>

  <p>"I've been asked to write a book," he said; "my adventures an' all that
  sort of thing. Of course they needn't have happened, really&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"In that case, Bones, I'm with you," said Hamilton; "if you're going to
  write a book about things that haven't happened to you, there's no limit to
  its size."</p>

  <p>"You're bein' a jolly cruel old officer, sir," said Bones, pained by the
  cold cynicism of his chief. "But I'm very serious, sir. This country is full
  of material. And everybody says I ought to write a book about it&mdash;why,
  dash it, sir, I've been here nearly two months!"</p>

  <p>"It seems years," said Hamilton.</p>

  <p>Bones was perfectly serious, as he had said. He did intend preparing a
  book for publication, had dreams of a great literary career, and an ultimate
  membership of the Athenaeum Club belike. It had come upon him like a
  revelation that such a career called him. The week after he had definitely
  made up his mind to utilize his gifts in this direction, his outgoing mail
  was heavier than ever. For to three and twenty English and American
  publishers, whose names he culled from a handy work of reference, he advanced
  a business-like offer to prepare for the press a volume "of 316 pages printed
  in type about the same size as enclosed," and to be entitled:</p>

  <p>MY WILD LIFE AMONGST CANNIBALS.</p>

  <p>BY</p>

  <p>AUGUSTUS TIBBETTS, Lieutenant of Houssas.</p>

  <p>Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society; Fellow of the Royal Asiatic
  Society; Member of the Ethnological Society and Junior Army Service Club.</p>

  <p>Bones had none of these qualifications, save the latter, but as he told
  himself he'd jolly soon be made a member if his book was a howling
  success.</p>

  <p>No sooner had his letters been posted than he changed his mind, and he
  addressed three and twenty more letters to the publishers, altering the title
  to:</p>

  <p>THE TYRANNY OF THE WILDS.</p>

  <p>Being Some Observations on the Habits and Customs of Savage Peoples.</p>

  <p>BY</p>

  <p>AUGUSTUS TIBBETTS (LT.).</p>

  <p>With a Foreword by Captain Patrick Hamilton.</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't mind writing a foreword, dear old fellow?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Charmed," said Hamilton. "Have you a particular preference for any
  form?"</p>

  <p>"Just please yourself, sir," said a delighted Bones, so Hamilton covered
  two sheets of foolscap with an appreciation which began:</p>

  <p>"The audacity of the author of this singularly uninformed work is to be
  admired without necessarily being imitated. Two months' residence in a land
  which offered many opportunities for acquiring inaccurate data, has resulted
  in a work which must stand for all time as a monument of murderous effort,"
  etc.</p>

  <p>Bones read the appreciation very carefully.</p>

  <p>"Dear old sport," he said, a little troubled, as he reached the end; "this
  is almost uncomplimentary."</p>

  <p>You couldn't depress Bones or turn him from his set purpose. He scribed
  away, occupying his leisure moments with his great work. His normal
  correspondence suffered cruelly, but Bones was relentless. Hamilton sent him
  north to collect the hut tax, and at first Bones resented this order,
  believing that it was specially designed to hamper him.</p>

  <p>"Of course, sir," he said, "I'll obey you, if you order me in accordance
  with regulations an' all that sort of rot, but believe me, sir, you're doin'
  an injury to literature. Unborn generations, sir, will demand an
  explanation&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Get out!" said Hamilton crossly.</p>

  <p>Bones found his trip a blessing that had been well disguised. There were
  many points of interest on which he required first-hand information. He
  carried with him to the <i>Zaire</i> large exercise books on which he had
  pasted such pregnant labels as "Native Customs," "Dances," "Ju-jus," "Ancient
  Legends," "Folk-lore," etc. They were mostly blank, and represented projected
  chapters of his great work.</p>

  <p>All might have been well with Bones. More virgin pages might easily have
  been covered with his sprawling writing and the book itself, converted into
  honest print, have found its way, in the course of time, into the tuppenny
  boxes of the Farringdon book-mart, sharing its soiled magnificence with the
  work of the best of us, but on his way Bones had a brilliant inspiration.
  There was a chapter he had not thought of, a chapter heading which had not
  been born to his mind until that flashing moment of genius.</p>

  <p>Upon yet another exercise book, he pasted the label of a chapter which was
  to eclipse all others in interest. Behold then, this enticing announcement,
  boldly printed and ruled about with double lines:</p>

  <p>"THE SOUL OF THE NATIVE WOMAN."</p>

  <p>It was a fine chapter title. It was sonorous, it had dignity, it was full
  of possibilities. "The Soul of the Native Woman," repeated Bones, in an
  ecstasy of self-admiration, and having chosen his subject he proceeded to
  find out something about it.</p>

  <p>Now, about this time, Bosambo of the Ochori might, had he wished and had
  he the literary quality, have written many books about women, if for no other
  reason than because of a certain girl named D'riti.</p>

  <p>She was a woman of fifteen, grown to a splendid figure, with a proud head
  and a chin that tilted in contempt, for she was the daughter of Bosambo's
  chief counsellor, grand-daughter of an Ochori king, and ambitious to be wife
  of Bosambo himself.</p>

  <p>"This is a mad thing," said Bosambo when her father offered the
  suggestion; "for, as you know, T'meli, I have one wife who is a thousand
  wives to me."</p>

  <p>"Lord, I will be ten thousand," said D'riti, present at the interview and
  bold; "also, Lord, it was predicted at my birth that I should marry a king
  and the greater than a king."</p>

  <p>"That is me," said Bosambo, who was without modesty; "yet, it cannot
  be."</p>

  <p>So they married D'riti to a chief's son who beat her till one day she
  broke his thick head with an iron pot, whereupon he sent her back to her
  father demanding the return of his dowry and the value of his pot.</p>

  <p>She had her following, for she was a dancer of fame and could twist her
  lithe body into enticing shapes. She might have married again, but she was so
  scornful of common men that none dare ask for her. Also the incident of the
  iron pot was not forgotten, and D'riti went swaying through the
  village&mdash;she walked from her hips, gracefully&mdash;a straight, brown,
  girl-woman desired and unasked.</p>

  <p>For she knew men too well to inspire confidence in them. By some weird
  intuition which certain women of all races acquire, she had probed behind
  their minds and saw with their eyes, and when she spoke of men, she spoke
  with a conscious authority, and such men, who were within earshot of her
  vitriolic comments, squirmed uncomfortably, and called her a woman of
  shame.</p>

  <p>So matters stood when the <i>Zaire</i> came flashing to the Ochori city
  and the heart of Bones filled with pleasant anticipation.</p>

  <p>Who was so competent to inform him on the matter of the souls of native
  women as Bosambo of the Ochori, already a crony of Bones, and admirable, if
  for no other reason, because he professed an open reverence for his new
  master? At any rate, after the haggle of tax collection was finished, Bones
  set about his task.</p>

  <p>"Bosambo," said he, "men say you are very wise. Now tell me something
  about the women of the Ochori."</p>

  <p>Bosambo looked at Bones a little startled.</p>

  <p>"Lord," said he, "who knows about women? For is it not written in the
  blessed Sura of the Djin that women and death are beyond understanding?"</p>

  <p>"That may be true," said Bones, "yet, behold, I make a book full of wise
  and wonderful things and it would be neither wise nor wonderful if there was
  no word of women."</p>

  <p>And he explained very seriously indeed that he desired to know of the soul
  of native womanhood, of her thoughts and her dreams and her high desires.</p>

  <p>"Lord," said Bosambo, after a long thought, "go to your ship: presently I
  will send to you a girl who thinks and speaks with great wisdom&mdash;and if
  she talks with you, you shall learn more things than I can tell you."</p>

  <p>To the <i>Zaire</i> at sundown came D'riti, a girl of proper height,
  hollow backed, bare to the waist, with a thin skirting of fine silk cloth
  which her father had brought from the Coast, wound tightly about her, yet not
  so tightly that it hampered her swaying, lazy walk. She stood before a
  disconcerted Bones, one small hand resting on her hip, her chin (as usual)
  tilted down at him from under lashes uncommonly long for a native.</p>

  <p>Also, this Bones saw, she was gifted with more delicate features than the
  native woman can boast as a rule. The nose was straight and narrow, the lips
  full, yet not of the negroid type. She was in fact a pure Ochori woman, and
  the Ochori are related dimly to the Arabi tribes.</p>

  <p>"Lord, Bosambo the King has sent me to speak about women," she said
  simply.</p>

  <p>"Doocidly awkward," said Bones to himself, and blushed.</p>

  <p>"O, D'riti," he stammered, "it is true I wish to speak of women, for I
  make a book that all white lords will read."</p>

  <p>"Therefore have I come," she said. "Now listen, O my lord, whilst I tell
  you of women, and of all they think, of their love for men and of the strange
  way they show it. Also of children&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Look here," said Bones, loudly. "I don't want any&mdash;any
  &mdash;private information, my child&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Then realizing from her frown that she did not understand him, he returned
  to Bomongo.</p>

  <p>"Lord, I will say what is to be said," she remarked, meekly, "for you have
  a gentle face and I see that your heart is very pure."</p>

  <p>Then she began, and Bones listened with open mouth... later he was to feel
  his hair rise and was to utter gurgling protests, for she spoke with
  primitive simplicity about things that are never spoken about at all. He
  tried to check her, but she was not to be checked.</p>

  <p>"Goodness, gracious heavens!" gasped Bones.</p>

  <p>She told him of what women think of men, and of what men <i>think</i>
  women think of them, and there was a remarkable discrepancy if she spoke the
  truth. He asked her if she was married.</p>

  <p>"Lord," she said at last, eyeing him thoughtfully, "it is written that I
  shall marry one who is greater than chiefs."</p>

  <p>"I'll bet you will, too," thought Bones, sweating.</p>

  <p>At parting she took his hand and pressed it to her cheek.</p>

  <p>"Lord," she said, softly, "to-morrow when the sun is nearly down, I will
  come again and tell you more...."</p>

  <p>Bones left before daybreak, having all the material he wanted for his book
  and more.</p>

  <p>He took his time descending the river, calling at sundry places.</p>

  <p>At Ikan he tied up the <i>Zaire</i> for the night, and whilst his men were
  carrying the wood aboard, he settled himself to put down the gist of his
  discoveries. In the midst of his labours came Abiboo.</p>

  <p>"Lord," said he, "there has just come by a fast canoe the woman who spoke
  with you last night."</p>

  <p>"Jumping Moses!" said Bones, turning pale, "say to this woman that I am
  gone&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But the woman came round the corner of the deck-house, shyly, yet with a
  certain confidence.</p>

  <p>"Lord," she said, "behold I am here, your poor slave; there are wonderful
  things about women which I have not told you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"O, D'riti!" said Bones in despair, "I know all things, and it is not
  lawful that you should follow me so far from your home lest evil be said of
  you."</p>

  <p>He sent her to the hut of the chief's wife&mdash;M'lini-fo-bini of
  Ikan&mdash;with instructions that she was to be returned to her home on the
  following morning. Then he went back to his work, but found it strangely
  distasteful. He left nothing to chance the next day.</p>

  <p>With the dawn he slipped down the river at full speed, never so much as
  halting till day began to fail, and he was a short day's journey from
  headquarters.</p>

  <p>"Anyhow, the poor dear won't overtake me to-day," he said&mdash;only to
  find the "poor dear" had stowed herself away on the steamer in the night
  behind a pile of wood.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"It's very awkward," said Hamilton, and coughed.</p>

  <p>Bones looked at his chief pathetically.</p>

  <p>"It's doocid awkward, sir," he agreed dismally.</p>

  <p>"You say she won't go back?"</p>

  <p>Bones shook his head.</p>

  <p>"She said I'm the moon and the sun an' all sorts of rotten things to her,
  sir," he groaned and wiped his forehead.</p>

  <p>"Send her to me," said Hamilton.</p>

  <p>"Be kind to her, sir," pleaded the miserable Bones. "After all, sir, the
  poor girl seems to be fond of me, sir&mdash;the human heart, sir&mdash;I
  don't know why she should take a fancy to me."</p>

  <p>"That's what I want to know," said Hamilton, briefly; "if she <i>is</i>
  mad, I'll send her to the mission hospital along the Coast."</p>

  <p>"You've a hard and bitter heart," said Bones, sadly.</p>

  <p>D'riti came ready to flash her anger and eloquence at Hamilton; on the
  verge of defiance.</p>

  <p>"D'riti," said Hamilton, "to-morrow I send you back to your people."</p>

  <p>"Lord, I stay with Tibbetti who loves women and is happy to talk of them.
  Also some day I shall be his wife, for this is foretold." She shot a tender
  glance at poor Bones.</p>

  <p>"That cannot be," said Hamilton calmly, "for Tibbetti has three wives, and
  they are old and fierce&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, lord!" wailed Bones.</p>

  <p>"And they would beat you and make you carry wood and water," Hamilton
  said; he saw the look of apprehension steal into the girl's face. "And more
  than this, D'riti, the Lord Tibbetti is mad when the moon is in full, he
  foams at the mouth and bites, uttering awful noises."</p>

  <p>"Oh, dirty trick!" almost sobbed Bones.</p>

  <p>"Go, therefore, D'riti," said Hamilton, "and I will give you a piece of
  fine cloth, and beads of many colours."</p>

  <p>It is a matter of history that D'riti went.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you think of me, sir," said Bones, humbly, "of course I
  couldn't get rid of her&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You didn't try," said Hamilton, searching his pockets for his pipe. "You
  could have made her drop you like a shot."</p>

  <p>"How, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Stuck your finger in her eye," said Hamilton, and Bones swallowed
  hard.</p>

  <h2><a name="chap08"
     id="chap08">VIII. &mdash; THE STRANGER WHO WALKED BY NIGHT</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Weekly Tale-Teller</i>, 2 Jan 1915</h3>

  <p class="first">SINCE the day when Lieutenant Francis Augustus Tibbetts
  rescued from the sacrificial trees the small brown baby whom he afterwards
  christened Henry Hamilton Bones, the interests of that young officer were to
  a very large extent extremely concentrated upon that absorbing problem which
  a famous journal once popularized, "What shall we do with our boys?"</p>

  <p>As to the exact nature of the communications which Bones made to England
  upon the subject, what hairbreadth escapes and desperate adventure he
  detailed with that facile pen of his, who shall say?</p>

  <p>It is unfortunate that Hamilton's sister&mdash;that innocent purveyor of
  home news&mdash;had no glimpse of the correspondence, and that other
  recipients of his confidence are not in touch with the writer of these
  chronicles. Whatever he wrote, with what fervour he described his wanderings
  in the forest no one knows, but certainly he wrote to some purpose.</p>

  <p>"What the dickens are all these parcels that have come for you for?"
  demanded his superior officer, eyeing with disfavour a mountain of brown
  paper packages be-sealed, be-stringed, and be-stamped.</p>

  <p>Bones, smoking his pipe, turned them over.</p>

  <p>"I don't know for certain," he said, carefully; "but I shouldn't be
  surprised if they aren't clothes, dear old officer."</p>

  <p>"Clothes?"</p>

  <p>"For Henry," explained Bones, and cutting the string of one and tearing
  away its covering revealed a little mountain of snowy garments. Bones turned
  them over one by one.</p>

  <p>"For Henry," he repeated; "could you tell me, sir, what these things are
  for?"</p>

  <p>He held up a garment white and small and frilly.</p>

  <p>"No, sir, I can't," said Hamilton stiffly, "unless like the ass that you
  are you have forgotten to mention to your friends that Henry is a gentleman
  child."</p>

  <p>Bones looked up at the blue sky and scratched his chin.</p>

  <p>"I may have called him 'her,'" he confessed.</p>

  <p>There were, to be exact, sixteen parcels and each contained at least one
  such garment, and in addition a very warm shawl, "which," said Hamilton,
  "will be immensely useful when it snows."</p>

  <p>With the aid of his orderly, Bones sorted out the wardrobe and the
  playthings (including many volumes of the
  Oh-look-at-the-rat-on-the-mat-where-is-the-cat? variety), and these he
  carried to his hut with such dignity as he could summon.</p>

  <p>That evening, Hamilton paid his subordinate a visit. Henry, pleasingly
  arrayed in a pair of the misdirected garments with a large bonnet on his
  head, and seated on the floor of the quarters contentedly chewing Bones'
  watch, whilst Bones, accompanying himself with his banjo, was singing a song
  which was chiefly remarkable for the fact that he was ignorant of the tune
  and somewhat hazy concerning the words.</p>

  <p>"Did you ever take a tum-ty up the Nile, Did you ever dumpty dupty in a
  camp, Or dumpty dumpty on m&mdash;m&mdash;&mdash;Or play it in a dumpty
  dumpty swamp."</p>

  <p>He rose, and saluted his senior, as Hamilton came in.</p>

  <p>"Exactly what is going to happen when Sanders comes back?" asked Hamilton,
  and the face of Bones fell.</p>

  <p>"Happen, sir? I don't take you, sir&mdash;what <i>could</i> happen
  &mdash;to whom, sir?"</p>

  <p>"To Henry," said Hamilton.</p>

  <p>Henry looked up at that moment with a seraphic smile.</p>

  <p>"Isn't he wonderful, sir?" asked Bones in hushed ecstasy; "you won't
  believe what I'm going to tell you, sir&mdash;you're such a jolly old
  sceptic, sir&mdash;but Henry knows me&mdash;positively recognizes me! And
  when you remember that he's only four months old&mdash;why, it's
  unbelievable."</p>

  <p>"But what will you do when Sanders comes&mdash;really, Bones, I don't know
  whether I ought to allow this as it is."</p>

  <p>"If exception is taken to Henry, sir," said Bones firmly, "I resign my
  commission; if a gentleman is allowed to keep a dog, sir, he is surely
  allowed to keep a baby. Between Henry and me, sir, there is a bond stronger
  than steel. I may be an ass, sir, I may even be a goop, but come between me
  an' my child an' all my motherly instincts&mdash;if you'll pardon the
  paradox&mdash;all my paternal&mdash;that's the word&mdash;instincts are
  aroused, and I will fight like a tiger, sir&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What a devil you are for jaw," said Hamilton; "anyway, I've warned you.
  Sanders is due in a month."</p>

  <p>"Henry will be five," murmured Bones.</p>

  <p>"Oh, blow Henry!" said Hamilton.</p>

  <p>Bones rose and pointed to the door.</p>

  <p>"May I ask you, sir," he said, "not to use that language before the child?
  I hate to speak to you like this, sir, but I have a responsible&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He dodged out of the open door and the loaf of bread which Hamilton had
  thrown struck the lintel and rolled back to Henry's eager hands.</p>

  <p>The two men walked up and down the parade ground whilst Fa'ma, the wife of
  Ahmet, carried the child to her quarters where he slept.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I've got to separate you from your child," said Hamilton;
  "there is some curious business going on in the Lombobo, and a stranger who
  walks by night, of which Ahmet the Spy writes somewhat confusingly."</p>

  <p>Bones glanced round in some apprehension.</p>

  <p>"Oblige me, old friend," he entreated, "by never speakin' of such things
  before Henry&mdash;I wouldn't have him scared for the world."</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">BOSAMBO of the Ochori was a light sleeper, the lighter
  because of certain stories which had reached him of a stranger who walks by
  night, and in the middle of the night he suddenly became wide awake,
  conscious that there was a man in his hut of whose coming the sentry without
  was ignorant.</p>

  <p>Bosambo's hand went out stealthily for his short spear, but before he
  could reach it, his wrist was caught in a grip of steel, strong fingers
  gripped his throat, and the intruder whispered fiercely, using certain words
  which left the chief helpless with wonder.</p>

  <p>"I am M'gani of the Night," said the voice with authoritative hauteur, "of
  me you have heard, for I am known only to chiefs; and am so high that chiefs
  obey and even devils go quickly from my path."</p>

  <p>"O, M'gani, I hear you," whispered Bosambo, "how may I serve you?"</p>

  <p>"Get me food," said the imperious stranger, "after, you shall make a bed
  for me in your inner room, and sit before this house that none may disturb
  me, for it is to my high purpose that no word shall go to M'ilitani that I
  stay in your territory."</p>

  <p>"M'gani, I am your dog," said Bosambo, and stole forth from the hut like a
  thief to obey.</p>

  <p>All that day he sat before his hut and even sent away the wife of his
  heart and the child M'sambo, that the rest of M'gani of the N'gombi should
  not be disturbed.</p>

  <p>That night when darkness had come and the glowing red of hut fires grew
  dimmer, M'gani came from the hut.</p>

  <p>Bosambo had sent away the guard and accompanied his guest to the end of
  the village.</p>

  <p>M'gani, with only a cloak of leopard skin about him, twirling two long
  spears as he walked, was silent till he came to the edge of the city where he
  was to take farewell of his host.</p>

  <p>"Tell me this, Bosambo, where are Sandi's spies that I may avoid
  them?"</p>

  <p>And Bosambo, without hesitation, told him.</p>

  <p>"M'gani," said he, at parting, "where do you go now? tell me that I may
  send cunning men to guard you, for there is a bad spirit in this land,
  especially amongst the people of Lombobo, because I have offended B'limi
  Saka, the chief."</p>

  <p>"No soldiers do I need, O Bosambo," said the other. "Yet I tell you this
  that I go to quiet places to learn that which will be best for my
  people."</p>

  <p>He turned to go.</p>

  <p>"M'gani," said Bosambo, "in the day when you shall see our lord Sandi,
  speak to him for me saying that I am faithful, for it seems to me, so high a
  man are you that he will listen to your word when he will listen to none
  other."</p>

  <p>"I hear," said M'gani gravely, and slipped into the shadows of the
  forest.</p>

  <p>Bosambo stood for a long time staring in the direction which M'gani had
  taken, then walked slowly back to his hut.</p>

  <p>In the morning came the chief of his councillors for a hut palaver.</p>

  <p>"Bosambo," said he, in a tone of mystery, "the Walker-of-the-Night has
  been with us."</p>

  <p>"Who says this?" asked Bosambo.</p>

  <p>"Fibini, the fisherman," said the councillor, "for this he says, that
  having toothache, he sat in the shadow of his hut near the warm fire and saw
  the Walker pass through the village and with him, lord, one who was like a
  devil, being big and very ugly."</p>

  <p>"Go to Fibini," said a justly annoyed Bosambo, "and beat him on the feet
  till he cries&mdash;for he is a liar and a spreader of alarm."</p>

  <p>Yet Fibini had done his worst before the bastinado (an innovation of
  Bosambo's) had performed its silencing mission, and Ochori mothers shepherded
  their little flocks with greater care when the sun went down that night, for
  this new terror which had come to the land, this black ghost with the
  wildfire fame was reputed especially devilish. In a week he had become
  famous&mdash;so swift does news carry in the territories.</p>

  <p>Men had seen him passing through forest paths, or speeding with incredible
  swiftness along the silent river. Some said that he had no boat and walked
  the waters, others that he flew like a bat with millions of bats behind him.
  One had met him face to face and had sunk to the ground before eyes "that
  were very hot and red and thrusting out little lightnings."</p>

  <p>He had been seen in many places in the Ochori, in the N'gombi city, in the
  villages of the Akasava, but mainly his hunting ground was the narrow strip
  of territory which is called Lombobo.</p>

  <p>B'limi Saka, the chief of the land, himself a believer in devils, was
  especially perturbed lest the Silent Walker should be a spy of Government,
  for he had been guilty of practices which were particularly obnoxious to the
  white men who were so swift to punish.</p>

  <p>"Yet," said he to his daughter and (to the disgust of his people, who
  despised women) his chief councillor, "none know my heart save you,
  Lamalana."</p>

  <p>Lamalana, with her man shoulders and her flat face, peered at her grizzled
  father sideways.</p>

  <p>"Devils hear hearts," she said huskily, "and when they talk of killings
  and sacrifices are not all devils pleased? Now I tell you this, my father,
  that I wait for sacrifices which you swore by death you would show me."</p>

  <p>B'limi Saka looked round fearfully. Though the ferocity of this chief was
  afterwards revealed, though secret places in the forest held his horrible
  secret killing-houses, yet he was a timid man with a certain affection of his
  eyes which made him dependent upon the childless widow who had been his
  strength for two years.</p>

  <p>The Lombobo were the cruellest of Sanders' people; their chiefs the most
  treacherous. Neither akin to the N'gombi, the Isisi, the Akasava nor the
  Ochori, they took on the worst attributes of each race.</p>

  <p>Seldom in open warfare did they challenge the Administration, but there
  was a long tale of slain and mutilated enemies who floated face downwards in
  the stream; of disappearance of faithful servants of Government, and of acts
  of cannibalism which went unidentified and unpunished.</p>

  <p>For though all the tribes, save the Ochori, had been cannibals, yet by
  fire and rope, tempered with wisdom, had the Administration brought about a
  newer era to the upper river.</p>

  <p>But reformation came not to the Lombobo. A word from Sanders, a carelessly
  expressed view, and the Lombobo people would have been swept from
  existence&mdash;wiped ruthlessly from the list of nations, but that was not
  the way of Government, which is patient and patient and patient again till in
  the end, by sheer heavy weight of patience, it crushes opposition to its
  wishes.</p>

  <p>They called Lamalana the barren woman, the Drinker of Life, but she had at
  least drunken without ostentation, and if she murdered with her own large
  hands, or staked men and women from a sheer lust of cruelty, there were none
  alive to speak against her.</p>

  <p>Outside the town of Lombobo[6] was a patch of beaten ground where no grass
  grew, and this place was called "wa boma," the killing ground.</p>

  <p>[Footnote 6: The territories are invariably named after the principal
  city, which is sometimes, perhaps, a little misleading.&mdash;E. W.]</p>

  <p>Here, before the white men came, sacrifices were made openly, and it was
  perhaps for this association and because it was, from its very openness, free
  from the danger of the eavesdropper, that Lamalana and her father would sit
  by the hour, whilst he told her the story of ancient horrors&mdash;never too
  horrible for the woman who swayed to and fro as she listened as one who was
  hypnotized.</p>

  <p>"Lord," said she, "the Walker of the Night comes not alone to the Lombobo;
  all people up and down the river have seen him, and to my mind he is a sign
  of great fortune showing that ghosts are with us. Now, if you are very brave,
  we will have a killing greater than any. Is there no hole in the hill[7]
  which Bosambo dug for your shame? And, lord, do not the people of the Ochori
  say that this child M'sambo is the light of his father's life? O ko! Bosambo
  shall be sorry."</p>

  <p>[Footnote 7: <i>See</i> "The Right of Way."]</p>

  <p>Later they walked in the forest speaking, for they had no fear of the
  spirits which the last slanting rays of the dying sun unlocked from the
  trees. And they talked and walked, and Lombobo huntsmen, returning through
  the wood, gave them a wide berth, for Lamalana was possessed of an eye which
  was notoriously evil.</p>

  <p>"Let us go back to the city," said Lamalana, "for now I see that you are
  very brave and not a blind old man."</p>

  <p>"There will be a great palaver and who knows but M'ilitani will come with
  his soldiers?"</p>

  <p>She laughed loudly and hoarsely, making the silent forest ring with harsh
  noise.</p>

  <p>"O ko!" she said, then laughed no more.</p>

  <p>In the centre of the path was a man; in the half light she saw the leopard
  skin and the strange belt of metal about his waist.</p>

  <p>"O Lamalana," he said softly, "laugh gently, for I have quick ears and I
  smell blood."</p>

  <p>He pointed to the darkening forest path down which they had come.</p>

  <p>"Many have been sacrificed and none heard them," he said, "this I know
  now. Let there be an end to killing, for I am M'gani, the Walker of the
  Night, and very terrible."</p>

  <p>"Wa!" screamed Lamalana, and leapt at him with clawing hands and her white
  teeth agrin. Then something soft and damp struck her face&mdash;full in the
  mouth like a spray of water, and she fell over struggling for her breath, and
  rose gasping to her feet to find the Walker had gone.</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">BEFORE Bosambo's hut Bones sat in a long and earnest
  conversation, and the subject of his discourse was children. For, alarmed by
  the ominous suggestion which Bones had put forward, that his superior should
  be responsible for the well-being of Henry in the absence of his
  foster-parent, Hamilton had yielded to the request that Henry should
  accompany Bones on his visit to the north.</p>

  <p>And now, on a large rug before Bosambo and his lord, there sat two small
  children eyeing one another with mutual distrust.</p>

  <p>"Lord," said Bosambo, "it is true that your lordship's child is wonderful,
  but I think that M'sambo is also wonderful. If your lordship will look with
  kind eyes he will see a certain cunning way which is strange in so young a
  one. Also he speaks clearly so that I understand him."</p>

  <p>"Yet," contested Bones, "as it seems to me, Bosambo, mine is very wise,
  for see how he looks to me when I speak, raising his thumb."</p>

  <p>Bones made a clucking noise with his mouth, and Henry turned frowningly,
  regarded his protector with cool indifference, and returned to his scrutiny
  of the other strange brown animal confronting him.</p>

  <p>"Now," said Bones that night, "what of the Walker?"</p>

  <p>"Lord, I know of him," said Bosambo, "yet I cannot speak for we are blood
  brothers by certain magic rites and speeches; this I know, that he is a good
  man as I shall testify to Sandi when he comes back to his own people."</p>

  <p>"You sit here for Government," said Bones, "and if you don't play the game
  you're a jolly old rotter, Bosambo!"</p>

  <p>"I know 'um, I no speak 'um, sah," said Bosambo, "I be good fellah, sah,
  no Yadasi fellah, sah&mdash;I be Peter feller, cut 'em ear some like,
  sah!"</p>

  <p>"You're a naughty old humbug," said Bones, and went to bed on the
  <i>Zaire</i> leaving Henry with the chief's wife....</p>

  <p>In the dark hours before the dawn he led his Houssas across the beach,
  revolver in hand, but came a little too late. The surprise party had been
  well planned. A speared sentry lay twisting before the chief's hut, and
  Bosambo's face was smothered in blood. Bones took in the situation.</p>

  <p>"Fire on the men who fly to the forest," he said, but Bosambo laid a
  shaking hand upon his arm.</p>

  <p>"Lord," he said, "hold your fire, for they have taken the children, and I
  fear the woman my wife is stricken."</p>

  <p>He went into the hut, Bones following.</p>

  <p>The chief's wife had a larger hut than Bosambo's own, communicating with
  her lord's through a passage of wicker and clay, and the raiders had clubbed
  her to silence, but Bones knew enough of surgery to see that she was in no
  danger.</p>

  <p>In ten minutes the fighting regiments of the Ochori were sweeping through
  the forest, trackers going ahead to pick up the trail.</p>

  <p>"Let all gods hear me," sobbed Bosambo, as he ran, "and send M'gani
  swiftly to M'sambo my son."</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p class="first">"NOW this is very wonderful," said Lamalana, "and it seems,
  O my father, no matter for a small killing, but for a sacrifice such as all
  men may see."</p>

  <p>It was the hour following the dawn when the world was at its sweetest,
  when the chattering weaver birds went in and out of their hanging nests
  gossiping loudly, and faint perfumes from little morning flowers gave the air
  an unusual delicacy.</p>

  <p>All the Lombobo people, the warriors and the hunters, the wives and the
  maidens, and even the children of tender years, lined the steep slopes of the
  Cup of Sacrifice. For Lamalana, deaf and blind to reason, knew that her hour
  was short, and that with the sun would come a man terrible in his anger...
  and the soldiers who eat up opposition with fire.</p>

  <p>"O people!" she cried.</p>

  <p>She was stripped to the waist, stood behind the Stone of Death as though
  it were a counter, and the two squirming infants under her hands were so much
  saleable stock: "Here we bring terror to all who hate us, for one of these is
  the heart of Bosambo and the other is more than the heart of
  the-man-who-stands-for-Sandi&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"O woman!"</p>

  <p>The intruder had passed unnoticed, almost it seemed by magic, through the
  throng, and now he stood in the clear space of sacrifice. And there was not
  one in the throng who had not heard of him with his leopard skin and his belt
  of brass.</p>

  <p>He was as black as the strange Ethiopians who came sometimes to the land
  with the Arabi traders, his muscular arms and legs were dull in their
  blackness.</p>

  <p>There was a whisper of terror&mdash;"The Walker of the Night!&mdash;" and
  the people fell back... a woman screamed and fell into a fit.</p>

  <p>"O woman," said M'gani, "deliver to me these little children who have done
  no evil."</p>

  <p>Open-mouthed the half-demented daughter of B'limi Saka stared at him.</p>

  <p>He walked forward, lifted the children in his two arms and went slowly
  through the people, who parted in terror at his coming.</p>

  <p>He turned at the top of the basin to speak.</p>

  <p>"Do no wickedness," said he; then he gently stooped to put the children on
  the ground, for mouthing and bellowing senseless sounds Lamalana came
  furiously after him, her long, crooked knife in her hand. He thrust his hand
  into the leopard skin as for a weapon, but before he could withdraw it, a man
  of Lombobo, half in terror, fell upon and threw his arms about M'gani.</p>

  <p>"Bo'ma!" boomed the woman, and drew back her knife for the stroke....</p>

  <p>Bones, from the edge of the clearing, jerked up the rifle he carried and
  fired.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"What man is this?" asked Bones.</p>

  <p>Bosambo looked at the stranger.</p>

  <p>"This is M'gani," he said, "he who walks in the night."</p>

  <p>"The dooce it is!" said Bones, and fixing his monocle glared at the
  stranger.</p>

  <p>"From whence do you come?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Lord, I come from the Coast," said the man, "by many strange ways,
  desiring to arrive at this land secretly that I might learn the heart of
  these people and understand." Then, in perfect English, "I don't think we've
  ever met before, Mr. Tibbetts&mdash;my name is Sanders."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap09"
     id="chap09">IX. &mdash; A RIGHT OF WAY</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Weekly Tale-Teller</i>, 5 Dec 1914</h3>

  <p class="first">THE borders of territories may be fixed by treaty, by
  certain mathematical calculations, or by arbitrary proclamation. In the
  territories over which Sanders ruled they were governed as between tribe and
  tribe by custom and such natural lines of demarkation as a river or a creek
  supplied.</p>

  <p>In forest land this was not possible, and there had ever been between the
  Ochori and the Lombobo a feud and a grievance, touched-up border fights, for
  hereabouts there is good hunting. Sanders had tried many methods and had hit
  upon the red gum border as a solution to a great difficulty. For some curious
  reason there were no red gum trees in the northern fringe of the forest for
  five miles on the Ochori side of the great wood; it was innocent of this
  beautiful tree and Sanders' fiat had gone forth that there should be no
  Ochori hunting in the red gum lands, and that settled the matter and Sanders
  hoped for good.</p>

  <p>But Bosambo set himself to enlarge his borders by a single expedient.
  Wherever his hunters came upon a red gum tree they cut it down. B'limi Saka,
  the chief of the sullen Lombobo, retaliated by planting red gum saplings on
  the country between the forest and the river&mdash;a fact of which Bosambo
  was not aware until he suddenly discovered a huge wedge of red gum driven
  into his lawful territory. A wedge so definite as to cut off nearly a
  thousand square miles of his territory, for beyond this border lay the lower
  Ochori country.</p>

  <p>"How may I reach my proper villages?" he asked Sanders, who had known
  something of the comedy which was being enacted.</p>

  <p>"You shall have canoes at the place of the young gum trees and shall row
  to a place beyond them," Sanders had said. "I have given my word that the red
  gum lands are the territory of B'limi Saka, and since you have only your
  cunning to thank&mdash;Oh, cutter of trees&mdash;I cannot help you!"</p>

  <p>Bosambo would have made short work of the young saplings, but B'limisaka
  established a guard not to be forced without bloodshed, and Bosambo could do
  no more in that way of reprisal than instruct his people to hurl insulting
  references to B'limisaka's as they passed the forbidden ground.</p>

  <p>For the maddening thing was that the slip of filched territory was less
  than a hundred yards wide and men of the Lombobo, who went out by night to
  widen it, never came out alive&mdash;for Bosambo also had a guard.</p>

  <p>Sometimes the minion spies of Government would come to headquarters with a
  twist of rice paper stuck in a quill, the quill inserted in the lobes of the
  ear in very much the same place as the ladies wore their earrings in the
  barbarous mid-Victorian period, and on the rice paper with the briefest
  introduction would be inserted, in perfect Arabic, scraps of domestic news
  for the information of the Government.</p>

  <p>Sometimes news would carry from mouth to mouth and a weary man would squat
  before Hamilton and recite his lesson.</p>

  <p>"Efobi of the Isisi has stolen goats, and because he is the brother of the
  chief's wife goes unpunished; T'mara of the Akasava has put a curse upon the
  wife of O'femo the headman, and she has burnt his hut; N'kema of the Ochori
  will not pay his tax, saying that he is no Ochori man, but a true N'gombi;
  Bosambo's men have beaten a woodman of B'limi Saka, because he planted trees
  on Ochori land; the well folk are on the edge of the N'gomb forest, building
  huts and singing&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"How long do they stay?" interrupted Hamilton.</p>

  <p>"Lord, who knows?" said the man.</p>

  <p>"Ogibo of the Akasava has spoken evilly of his king and mightily of
  himself&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Make a note of that, Bones."</p>

  <p>"Make a note of which, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Ogibo&mdash;he looked like a case of sleep-sickness the last time I was
  in his village&mdash;go on."</p>

  <p>"Ogibo also says that the father of his father was a great chief and was
  lord of all the Akasava&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's sleeping sickness all right," said Hamilton bitterly. "Why the
  devil doesn't he wait till Sanders is back before he goes mad?"</p>

  <p>"Drop him a line, sir," suggested Bones, "he's a remarkable feller
  &mdash;dash it all, sir, what the dooce is the good of bein' in charge of the
  district if you can't put a stop to that sort of thing?"</p>

  <p>"What talk is there of spears in this?" asked Hamilton of the spy.</p>

  <p>"Lord, much talk&mdash;as I know, for I serve in this district."</p>

  <p>"Go swiftly to Ogibo, and summon him to me for a high <i>lakimbo</i>,[8]"
  said Hamilton; "my soldiers shall carry you in my new little ship that burns
  water[9]&mdash;fly pigeons to me that I may know all that happens."</p>

  <p>[Footnote 8: Palaver.]</p>

  <p>[Footnote 9: The motor-launch.]</p>

  <p>"On my life," said the spy, raised his hand in salute and departed.</p>

  <p>"These well people you were talkin' about, sir," asked Bones, "who are
  they?"</p>

  <p>But Hamilton could give no satisfactory answer to such a question, and,
  indeed, he would have been more than ordinarily clever had he been able
  to.</p>

  <p>The wild territories are filled with stubborn facts, bewildering
  realities, and extraordinary inconsequences. Up by the N'gombi lands lived a
  tribe who, for the purposes of office classification, were known as "N'gombi
  (Interior)," but who were neither N'gombi nor Isisi, nor of any known branch
  of the Bantu race, but known as "the people of the well." They had remarkable
  legends, sayings which they ascribed to a mythical Idoosi; also they have a
  song which runs:</p><br>

  <p class="verse">O well in the forest!<br>
  Which chiefs have digged;<br>
  No common men touched the earth,<br>
  But chiefs' spears and the hands of kings.</p><br>

  <p>Now there is no doubt that both the sayings of Idoosi and the song of the
  well have come down from days of antiquity, and that Idoosi is none other
  than the writer of the lost book of the Bible, of whom it is written:</p>

  <p>"Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not written
  in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the
  Shilonite, and in the vision of Idoo the seer?"[10]....</p>

  <p>[Footnote 10: Chronicles II., ix. 29.]</p>

  <p>And is not the Song of the Well identical with that brief extract from the
  Book of Wars of the Lord&mdash;lost to us for ever&mdash;which runs:</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"Spring up, O well: sing ye unto it:<br>
  The well, which the princes digged, Which the nobles of the people
  delved,<br>
  With the sceptre... with their staves."[11]</p><br>

  <p>[Footnote 11: Numbers xxi. 17.]</p>

  <p>Some men say that the People of the Well are one of the lost tribes, but
  that is an easy solution which suggests itself to the hasty-minded. Others
  say that they are descendants of the Babylonian races, or that they came down
  from Egypt when Rameses II died, and there arose a new dynasty and a Pharaoh
  who did not know the wise Jewish Prime Minister who ruled so wisely, who
  worshipped in the little temple at Karnac, and whose statue you may see in
  Cairo with a strange Egyptian name. We know him better as "Joseph"&mdash;he
  who was sold into captivity.</p>

  <p>Whatever they were, this much is known, to the discomfort of everybody,
  that they were great diggers of wells, and would, on the slightest excuse,
  spend whole months, choosing, for some mad reason, the top of hills for their
  operations, delving in the earth for water, though the river was less than a
  hundred yards away.</p>

  <p>Of all the interesting solutions which have been offered with the object
  of identifying the People of the Well, none are so interesting as that which
  Bones put forward at the end of Hamilton's brief sketch.</p>

  <p>"My idea, dear old officer," he said profoundly, "that all these Johnnies
  are artful old niggers who've run away from their wives in
  Timbuctoo&mdash;and for this reason&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, shut up!" said Hamilton.</p>

  <p>Two nights later the bugles were ringing through the Houssa lines, and
  Bones, sleepy-eyed, with an armful of personal belongings, was racing for the
  <i>Zaire</i>, for Ogibo of the Akasava had secured a following.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">THE chief Ogibo who held the law and kept the peace for his
  master, the King of the Akasava, was bitten many times by the tsetse on a
  hunting trip into the bad lands near the Utur forest. Two years afterwards,
  of a sudden, he was seized with a sense of his own importance, and proclaimed
  himself paramount chief of the Akasava, and all the lands adjoining. And
  since it is against nature that any lunatic should be without his following,
  he had no difficulty in raising all the spears that were requisite for his
  immediate purpose, marched to Igili, the second most important town in the
  Akasava kingdom, overthrew the defensive force, destroyed the town, and
  leaving half his fighting regiment to hold the conquered city he moved
  through the forest toward the Akasava city proper. He camped in the forest,
  and his men spent an uncomfortable night, for a thunderstorm broke over the
  river, and the dark was filled with quick flashes and the heavens crashed
  noisily. There was still a rumbling and a growling above his head when he
  assembled his forces in the grey dawn, and continued his march. He had not
  gone half an hour before one of his headmen came racing up to where he led
  his force in majesty.</p>

  <p>"Lord," said he, "do you hear no sound?"</p>

  <p>"I hear the thunder," said Ogibo.</p>

  <p>"Listen!" said the headman.</p>

  <p>They halted, head bent.</p>

  <p>"It is thunder," said Ogibo, as the rumble and moan of the distant storm
  came to him. Then above the grumble of the thunder came a sharper note, a
  sound to be expressed in the word "blong!"</p>

  <p>"Lord," said the headman, "that is no thunder, rather is it the
  fire-thrower of M'ilitani."</p>

  <p>So Ogibo in his wrath turned back to crush the insolent white men who had
  dared attack the garrison he had left behind to hold Igili.</p>

  <p>Bones with a small force was pursuing him, totally unaware of the strength
  that Ogibo mustered. A spy brought to the chief news of the smallness of the
  following force.</p>

  <p>"Now," said Ogibo, "I will show all the world how great a chief I am, for
  my bravery I will destroy all these soldiers that are sent against me."</p>

  <p>He chose his ambush well&mdash;though he had need to send scampering with
  squeals of terror half a hundred humble aliens who were at the moment of
  interruption digging a foolish well on the top of the hill where Ogibo was
  concealing his shaking force.</p>

  <p>Bones with his Houssas saw how the path led up a tolerably steep
  hill&mdash;one of the few in the country&mdash;and groaned aloud, for he
  hated hills.</p>

  <p>He was half-way up at the head of his men, when Ogibo on the summit gave
  the order, "Boma!" said he, which means kill, and three abreast, shields
  locked and spears gripped stomach high, the rebels charged down the path.
  Bones saw them coming and slipped out his revolver. There was no room to
  manoeuvre his men, the path was fairly narrow, dense undergrowth masked each
  side.</p>

  <p>He heard the yell, saw above the bush, which concealed the winding way,
  the dancing head-dresses of the attackers, and advanced his pistol arm. The
  rustle of bare feet on the path, a louder roar than ever&mdash;then
  silence.</p>

  <p>Bones waited, a Houssa squeezed on either side of him, but the onrushing
  enemy did not appear, and only a faint whimper of sound reached him.</p>

  <p>"Lord! they go back!" gasped his sergeant; and Bones saw to his amazement
  a little knot of men making their frantic way up the hill.</p>

  <p>At first he suspected an ambush within an ambush, but it was unlikely; he
  could never be more at Ogibo's mercy than he had been.</p>

  <p>Cautiously he felt his way up the hill path, a revolver in each hand.</p>

  <p>He rounded a sharp corner of the path and saw....</p>

  <p>A great square chasm yawned in the very centre of the pathway, the bushes
  on either side were buried under the earth which the diggers of wells had
  flung up, and piled one on the other, a writhing, struggling confusion of
  shining bodies, were Ogibo's soldiers to the number of a hundred, with a
  silent Ogibo undermost, wholly indifferent to his embarrassing position, for
  his neck was broken.</p>

  <p>Hamilton came up in the afternoon and brought villagers to assist at the
  work of rescue and afterwards he interviewed the chief of the shy and timid
  Well-folk.</p>

  <p>"O chief," said Hamilton, "it is an order of Sandi that you shall dig no
  wells near towns, and yet you have done this."</p>

  <p>"Bless his old heart!" murmured Bones.</p>

  <p>"Lord, I break the law," said the man, simply, "also I break all custom,
  for to-day, by your favour, I cross the river, I and my people. This we have
  never done since time was."</p>

  <p>"Whither do you go?"</p>

  <p>The chief of the wanderers, an old man remarkably gifted&mdash;for his
  beard was long and white, and reached to his waist&mdash;stuck his spear head
  down in the earth.</p>

  <p>"Lord, we go to a place which is written," he said; "for Idoosi has said,
  'Go forth to the natives at war, they that fight by the river; on the swift
  water shall you go, even against the water'&mdash;many times have we come to
  the river, master, but ever have we turned back; but now it seems that the
  prophecy has been fulfilled, for there are bleeding men in these holes and
  the sound of thunders."</p>

  <p>The People of the Well crossed to the Isisi, using the canoes of the
  Akasava headmen, and made a slow progress through territory which gave them
  no opportunity of exercising their hobby, since water lay less than a spade's
  length beneath the driest ground.</p>

  <p>"Poor old Sanders," said Hamilton ruefully, when he was again on the
  <i>Zaire</i>, "I've so mixed up his people that he'll have to get a new map
  made to find them again."</p>

  <p>"You might tell me off to show him round, sir," suggested Bones, but
  Hamilton did not jump at the offer.</p>

  <p>He was getting more than a little rattled. Sanders was due back in a
  month, and it seemed that scarcely a week passed but some complication arose
  that further entangled a situation which was already too full of loose and
  straying threads for his liking.</p>

  <p>"I suppose the country is settled for a week at any rate," he said with a
  little sigh of relief&mdash;but he reckoned without his People of the
  Well.</p>

  <p>They moved, a straggling body of men and women, with their stiff walk and
  their doleful song, a wild people with strange, pinched faces and long black
  hair, along the river's edge.</p>

  <p>A week's journeyings brought them to the Ochori country and to Bosambo,
  who was holding a most important palaver.</p>

  <p>It was held on Ochori territory, for the forbidden strip was by this time
  so thickly planted with young trees that there was no place for a man to
  sit.</p>

  <p>"Lord," said Bosambo, "if you will return me the land which you have
  stolen, so that I may pass unhindered from one part of my territory to the
  other, I will give you many islands on the river."</p>

  <p>"That is a foolish palaver," said B'limisaka; "for you have no islands to
  give."</p>

  <p>"Now I tell you, B'limisaka," said Bosambo, "my young men are crying out
  against you, for, as you know, you have planted your trees on the high
  ground, and my people, taking to their canoes, must climb down to the water's
  edge a long way, so that it wearies their legs, soon, I fear, I shall not
  hold them, for they are very fierce and full of arrogance."</p>

  <p>"Lord," said B'limisaka, significantly, "my young men are also
  fierce."</p>

  <p>The palaver was dispersing, and the last of the Lombobo councillors were
  disappearing in the forest, when the Diggers of the Well came through the
  forbidden territory to the place where Bosambo sat.</p>

  <p>"We are they of whom you have heard, O my Lord," said the old man, who led
  them, "also we carry a book for you."</p>

  <p>He unwound the cloth about his thin middle, and with many fumblings
  produced a paper which Bosambo read.</p>

  <p>"From M'ilitani, by Ogibo's village in the Akasava.</p>

  <p>"To Bosambo&mdash;may God preserve him!</p>

  <p>"I give this to the chief of Well diggers that you shall know they are
  favoured by me, being simple people and very timid. Give them a passage
  through your territory, for they seek a holy land, and find them high places
  for the digging of holes, for they seek truth. Now peace on your house,
  Bosambo."</p>

  <p>"On my ship, by channel of rocks."</p>

  <p>"Lord, it is true," said the old chief, "we seek a shining thing that will
  stay white when it is white, and black when it is black, and the wise Idoosi
  has said, 'Go down into the earth for truth, seek it in the deeps of the
  earth, for it lies in secret places, in centre of the world it lies.'"</p>

  <p>Bosambo thought long and rapidly, then there came to him the bright light
  of an inspiration.</p>

  <p>"What manner of holes do you dig, old man?"</p>

  <p>"Lord, we dig them deep, for we are cunning workers, and do not fear death
  as common men do; also we dig them straightly&mdash;into the very heart of
  hills we dig them."</p>

  <p>Bosambo looked at the sloping ground covered with hateful gum.</p>

  <p>"Old man," said he softly, "here shall you dig, you and your people, for
  in the heart of this hill is such a truth as you desire&mdash;my young men
  shall bring you food and build huts for you, and I will place one who is
  cunning in the way of hills to show you the way."</p>

  <p>The old man's eyes gleamed joyously, and he clasped the ankles of his
  magnanimous host.</p>

  <p>"Lord," said he humbly, "now is the prophecy fulfilled, for it was said by
  the great Idoosi, 'You shall come to a land where the barbarian rules, and he
  shall be to you as a brother!'"</p>

  <p>"Nigger," said Bosambo in his vile English&mdash;yet with a certain
  hauteur, "you shall dig 'um tunnel&mdash;you no cheek 'um, no chat 'um, you
  lib for dear tunnel one time."</p>

  <p>He watched them as, singing the song of the well, they went to work,
  women, men, and even little children undermining the Chief B'limisaka's
  territory and creating for Bosambo the right of way for which his soul
  craved.</p>

  <h2><a name="chap10"
     id="chap10">X. &mdash; THE GREEN CROCODILE</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Weekly Tale-Teller</i>, 19 Dec 1914</h3>

  <p class="first"><i>CALA CALA</i>, as they say, seven brothers lived near the
  creek of the Green One. It was not called the creek of the Green One in those
  far-off days, for the monstrous thing had no existence.</p>

  <p>And the seven brothers had seven wives who were sisters, and it would
  appear from the legend that these seven wives were unfaithful to their
  husbands, and upon a certain night in the full of the moon, the brothers
  returning from an expedition into the forest, discovered the extent of their
  infamy, and they tied the sisters together, the wrists of one to the ankles
  of the other, and they led them to the stream, and no sooner had they
  disappeared beneath the black waters than there was almighty splashing and
  bubbling of water, and there came crawling from the place where the
  unfaithful wives had sunk so terrible a monster that the seven brothers fled
  in fear.</p>

  <p>This was the Green One, with his long ugly snout, cold, vicious eyes, and
  his great clawed feet. Some say that these women had been changed by magic
  into the Crocodile of the Pool, and many people believe this and speak of the
  Green One in the plural.</p>

  <p>Certain it is, that this terrible crocodile lived through the ages
  &mdash;none hunting her, she was left in indisputable possession of the flat
  sand-bank wherein to lay her eggs, and ranged the sandy shore of the creek
  undisturbed.</p>

  <p>She was regarded with awe; sacrifices, living and dead, were offered to
  her from time to time, and sometimes a cripple or two was knocked on the head
  and left by the water's edge for her pleasure. She was indeed a veritable
  scavenger of crime for the neighbouring villages about, and earned some sort
  of respect, for, as the saying went:</p>

  <p>"Sandi does not speak the language of the Green One."</p>

  <p>Sometimes M'zooba would go afield, leaving the quietude of the creek and
  the pool, which was her own territory, for the more adventurous life of the
  river, and here one day she lay, the whole of her body submerged and only her
  wicked eyes within an eighth of an inch of the water's surface, when a
  timorous young roebuck came picking a cautious way through the forest across
  the open plantations to the water's edge. He stopped from time to time
  apprehensively, trembling in every limb at the slightest sound, looking this
  way and that, then taking a few more steps and again searching the cruel
  world for danger before he reached the water's edge.</p>

  <p>Then, after a final look round, he lowered his soft muzzle to the cool
  waters. Swift as lightning the Green One flashed her long snout out of the
  water, and gripped the tender head of the buck. Ruthlessly she pulled,
  dragging the struggling deer after her till first its neck and then its
  shoulders, then finally the last frantic waving stump of its white tail went
  under the dark waters.</p>

  <p>Out in midstream a white little boat was moving steadily up the river and
  on the awning-shaded bridge an indignant young man witnessed the tragedy. The
  Green One had her larder under a large shelving rock half a dozen feet
  beneath the water. Into this cavity her long hard nose flung her dead victim,
  and her four powerful hands covered the entrance to the water cave with sand
  and rock. More than satisfied with her morning's work, the Green One came to
  the surface of the water to bask in the glowing warmth of the morning
  sunlight.</p>

  <p>She took a survey upon the world, made up of low-lying shores and a hot
  blue sky. She saw a river, broad and oily, and a strange white object which
  she had seen often before smoking towards her.</p>

  <p>And that was the last thing she ever saw; for Bones, on the bridge of the
  <i>Zaire</i>, squinted along the sights of his Express and pressed the
  trigger. Struck in the head by an explosive bullet, the Green One went out in
  a flurry of stormy water.</p>

  <p>"Thus perish all rotten old crocodiles," said Bones, immensely pleased
  with himself, and he placed the rifle on the rack.</p>

  <p>"What the devil are you shooting at, so early in the morning?" asked
  Hamilton.</p>

  <p>He came out in his pyjamas, sun helmet on his head, pliant mosquito boots
  reaching to his knees.</p>

  <p>"A crocodile, sir," said Bones.</p>

  <p>"Why waste good ammunition on crocodiles?" asked Hamilton; "was it
  something exceptional?"</p>

  <p>"A tremendous chap, sir," said the enthusiastic Bones, "some fifty feet
  long, and as green as&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"As green!" repeated Hamilton quickly, "where are we?"</p>

  <p>He looked with a swift glance along the shore for landmarks.</p>

  <p>"I hope to goodness you have not shot old M'zooba," he said.</p>

  <p>"I don't know your friend by name," said Bones, "but why shouldn't I shoot
  him?"</p>

  <p>"Because, you silly ass," said Hamilton, "she is a sort of sacred
  crocodile."</p>

  <p>"She was never so sacred as she is now, sir, for she's flapping her wings
  in the crocodile heaven," said Bones, flippantly; "for I'm one of those dead
  shots&mdash;once I draw a bead on an animal&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Get out a canoe and set the woodmen to dive for the Green One," said
  Hamilton to his orderly, for a shot crocodile invariably sinks to the bottom
  and can only be recovered by diving.</p>

  <p>They brought it to the surface, and Hamilton groaned.</p>

  <p>"It is M'zooba," he said in resigned exasperation. "Oh, Bones, what an ass
  you are!"</p>

  <p>Bones said nothing, but walked to the stern of the ship and lowered the
  blue ensign to half-mast&mdash;a piece of impertinence which Hamilton did not
  discover till a long time afterwards.</p>

  <p>Now whatever might be the desire or wish of Hamilton, and however much he
  might on ordinary occasions depend upon the loyalty of his warders and his
  men, in this matter of the green crocodile he was entirely at their mercy,
  for he could not call them together asking them to speak no death of the
  Green One without magnifying the importance of Lieutenant Tibbetts' rash act.
  The only attitude he could adopt was to treat the Green One and her untimely
  end as something which was in the day's work neither to be lamented nor
  acclaimed, and when, at the first village, a doleful deputation, comprising a
  worried chief and a sulky witch doctor, called upon him to bemoan the
  tragedy, he treated the matter with great joviality.</p>

  <p>"For what is a crocodile more or less in this river?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Lord, this was no crocodile," said the witch doctor, "but a very reverend
  ghost, and it has been our Ju-ju for many years, bringing us good crops and
  fair weather for our goodness, and has eaten up all the devils and sickness
  which came to our villages. Now it is gone nothing but ill fortune can come
  to us."</p>

  <p>"Bugobo," said Hamilton, "you talk like a foolish one, for how may a
  crocodile who does not leave the water, and moreover is evil and old, a
  stealer of women and children and dangerous to your goats, how can this thing
  bring good fortune to any people?"</p>

  <p>"How can the river run, lord?" replied the man, "and yet it does."</p>

  <p>Hamilton thought for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Now I tell you this, and you shall say to all people who ask you, that by
  my magic I will bring another green one to this stream, greater and larger
  than the one who has gone, and she shall be ju-ju for all men."</p>

  <p>"And now," he said to Bones, when the deputation had left, "it is up to
  you to go out and find a nice, respectable crocodile to take the place of the
  lady you have so light-heartedly destroyed."</p>

  <p>Bones gasped.</p>

  <p>"Dear old feller," he said feebly, "the habits and customs of fauna of
  this land are entirely beyond me. I will fetch you a crocodile, sir, with the
  greatest of pleasure, although as far as I know there is nothing laid down in
  the King's regulations of the warrants for pay and promotion defining the
  catching of crocodiles as part of an officer's duty."</p>

  <p>Hamilton made no further move towards replacing the lost Spirit of the
  Pool until he learnt that his offer had been taken very seriously, and that
  the coming of the great new Green One to the pool, was a subject of
  discussion up and down the river.</p>

  <p>Now here is a fact which official records go to substantiate. Although the
  "Reports of the Territories" take no cognizance of ghosts and spirits and
  other occult influence, dealing rather with such mundane facts as the
  condition of crops and the discipline of the races, yet the reports of that
  particular year in this one district made gloomy reading both for Hamilton
  and for the Administrator in his far-off stone house.</p>

  <p>Though the crops throughout the whole of the country were good that
  Hamilton was apprehensive about the consequences&mdash;for men fight better
  with a full larder behind them&mdash;yet in this immediate neighbourhood of
  the pool, within its sphere of influence, so to speak, the crops failed
  miserably, and the fish which haunt the shallow stream beneath the big stream
  near the channel took it into their silly heads to migrate to other distant
  waters. Here, then, was the consequence of Bones' murder demonstrated to a
  most alarming extent. There was a blight in the potatoes; the maize crop, for
  some unaccountable reason, was a meagre one; there were three unexpected
  cases of sleeping sickness followed by madness in an interior village, and,
  crowning disaster of all, one of those sudden storms which sweep across the
  river came upon the village, and lightning struck the huts.</p>

  <p>"My son," said Hamilton, when they brought the news to him, "you have got
  to go out and find a green crocodile, quick."</p>

  <p>So Bones went up the river with the naphtha launch, leaving to Hamilton
  the delicate task of finding a natural explanation for all the horrors which
  had come upon the unfortunate people.</p>

  <p>Green crocodiles are rare even on the great river which had half a million
  other kinds of crocodiles to its credit, for green is both a sign of age, and
  by common report indicative of cannibalistic tendencies.</p>

  <p>In whatever veneration the Green One of the Pool might be held, such
  respect did not extend to other parts of the river, where the green ones were
  sought out and slain in their early youth. Bones spent an exciting seven days
  chasing, lassoing and, at times in self-defence, shooting at great reptiles
  without getting any nearer to the object of his search.</p>

  <p>"Ahmet," said he, in despair, "it seems that there are no green crocodiles
  on this river."</p>

  <p>"Lord, there are very few," admitted the man; "for the people kill green
  crocodiles owing to their evil influence."</p>

  <p>At every village there was news for Bones which lightened his heart. Some
  one had seen such a monster, it lived in a pool or lorded some creek,
  generally only get-at-able in a canoe; and here Bones, with his Houssas,
  would wait smoking furiously, with baited lines cunningly laid from thick
  underbrush or some tethered goat, bleating invitingly on the banks. But never
  once did the hunter catch so much as a glimpse of green. There were yellow
  crocodiles, grey crocodiles, crocodiles the colour of the sand, or the dark
  brown bed of the river, but nothing which by any stretch of imagination could
  be called green.</p>

  <p>And urgent messages came to Bones. The <i>Zaire</i> itself, in charge of
  Abiboo, came steaming up carrying a letter filled with unnecessary abuse, for
  Hamilton was getting rattled by the extraordinary manifestations which he
  received every day of the potency of this slain monster. Bones sent the
  sergeant back in the launch with an insubordinate message, and commandeered
  the <i>Zaire</i> with her superior accommodation for himself.</p>

  <p>"There is only one thing to do," he said, "and that is to consult jolly
  old Bosambo."</p>

  <p>So he put the head of the <i>Zaire</i> to the Ochori country, and on the
  second day arrived at the city.</p>

  <p>"Lord," said Bosambo, loftily, "crocodiles I have by thousands."</p>

  <p>"Green ones?" asked Bones anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Lord, of every colour," said Bosambo, "blue or green or red, even golden
  crocodiles have I in my splendid river. But they will cost great money
  because they are very cunning, and my hunters of crocodiles are independent
  men who do not care to work."</p>

  <p>Bones dried up the flood of eloquence quickly.</p>

  <p>"O Bosambo," said he, "there is no money for this palaver, but a green
  crocodile I must have because the evil people of the Lower Isisi say I have
  put a spell on their land because I slew the Green One, M'zooba, also this
  crocodile must I have before the moon is due. My Lord M'ilitani has sent me
  many powerful messages to this effect."</p>

  <p>This was another matter, and Bosambo looked dubious.</p>

  <p>"Lord," said he, "what manner of green was this crocodile, for I never saw
  it?"</p>

  <p>Bones looked round.</p>

  <p>Neither the green of the trees he saw, nor the green of the grass
  underfoot, nor the green of the elephant grass growing strongly on the
  river's edge, nor the tender green of the high trees above, nor the tender
  green of the young Isisi palms; and yet the exact shade of green it was
  necessary to secure. He ransacked all his books, turned over all his
  possessions and Hamilton's too, in an endeavour to match the crocodile. There
  was a suit of pyjamas of Hamilton's which had a stripe very near, but not
  quite.</p>

  <p>"O Ahmet," said Bones at last in desperation, "go to the storeman, and let
  him bring all the paints he has so that I may show Bosambo a certain
  colour."</p>

  <p>They found the exact shade at last on a ten-pound tin of Aspinall enamels,
  and Bosambo thought long.</p>

  <p>"Lord," said he, "I think I know where I may find just such a crocodile as
  you want."</p>

  <p>Late that night Bones met Bosambo before his hut in a long and earnest
  palaver, and an hour before dawn he went out with Bosambo and his huntsmen,
  and was pulled to a certain creek in the Ochori land which is notorious for
  the size and strength of its crocodiles.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">NO doubt but Hamilton had a serious task before him, for
  although the grievance which he had to allay was limited to the restricted
  area over which the spirit of M'zooba brooded, yet the people of the
  crocodile had many sympathizers who resented as bitterly as the affected
  parties this interference with what Downing Street called "local religious
  customs."</p>

  <p>A wholly unauthorized palaver was held in the forest which was attended by
  delegations from the Akasava and the N'gombi, and spies brought the news to
  Hamilton that the little witch doctors were going through the villages
  carrying stories of desolation which had come as the result of M'zooba's
  death.</p>

  <p>The palaver Hamilton dispensed with some brusqueness. Twenty soldiers and
  a machine gun were uninvited guests to the gathering, and the meeting retired
  in disorder. Two of the witch doctors Hamilton's men caught. One he flogged
  with all the village looking on, and the other he sent to the Village of
  Irons for twelve months.</p>

  <p>And all the time he spoke of the newer green one which was coming, which
  his magic would invoke, and which would surely appear "tied by one leg" to a
  stake near the pool, for all men to see.</p>

  <p>He founded a sect of new-green-one worshippers (quite unwittingly). It
  needed only the corporeal presence of his novel deity to wipe out the
  feelings of distrust which violence had not wholly dispelled.</p>

  <p>Day after day passed, but no word came from Bones, and Captain Hamilton
  cursed his subordinate, his subordinate's relations, and all the cruelty of
  fate which brought Bones into his command. Then, unexpectantly, the truant
  arrived, arrived proud and triumphant in the early morning before Hamilton
  was awake. He sneaked into the village so quietly that even the Houssa sentry
  who dozed across the threshold of Hamilton's hut was not aware of his return;
  and silently, with fiercely whispered injunctions, so that the surprise
  should be all the more complete, Bones landed his unruly cargo, its feet
  chained, his great muzzle lassoed and bound with raw hide, its powerful and
  damaging tail firmly fixed between two planks of wood (a special idea for
  which Bones was responsible). Then Lieutenant Tibbetts went to the hut of his
  chief and woke him.</p>

  <p>"So here you are, are you?" said Hamilton.</p>

  <p>"I am here," said Bones with trembling pride, so that Hamilton knew his
  subordinate had been successful; "according to your instructions, sir, I have
  captured the green crocodile. He is of monstrous size, and vastly superior to
  your partly-worn lady friend. Also," he said, "as per your instructions,
  conveyed to me in your letter dated the twenty-third instant, I have fastened
  same by right leg in the vicinity of the pool; at least," he corrected
  carefully, "he was fastened, but owing to certain technical difficulties he
  slipped cable, so to speak, and is wallowing in his native element."</p>

  <p>"You are not rotting, Bones, are you?" asked Hamilton, busy with his
  toilet.</p>

  <p>"Perfectly true and sound, sir, I never rot," said Bones stiffly; "give me
  a job of work to do, give me a task, put me upon my metal, sir, and with the
  assistance of jolly old Bosambo&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Is Bosambo in this?"</p>

  <p>Bones hesitated.</p>

  <p>"He assisted me very considerably, sir," he said; "but, so to speak, the
  main idea was mine."</p>

  <p>The chief's drum summoned the villages to the palaver house, but the news
  had already filtered through the little township, and a crowd had gathered
  waiting eagerly to hear the message which Hamilton had to give them.</p>

  <p>"O people," he said, addressing them from the hill of palaver, "all I have
  promised you I have performed. Behold now in the pool&mdash;and you shall
  come with me to see this wonder&mdash;is one greater than M'zooba, a vast and
  splendid spirit which shall protect your crops and be as M'zooba was, and
  better than was M'zooba. All this I have done for you."</p>

  <p>"Lord Tibbetti has done for you," prompted Bones, in a hoarse whisper.</p>

  <p>"All this have I done for you," repeated Hamilton firmly, "because I love
  you."</p>

  <p>He led the way through the broad, straggling plantation to the great pool
  which begins in a narrow creek leading from the river and ends in a sprawl of
  water to the east of the village.</p>

  <p>The whole countryside stood about watching the still water, but nothing
  happened.</p>

  <p>"Can't you whistle him and make him come up or something?" asked
  Hamilton.</p>

  <p>"Sir," said an indignant Bones, "I am no crocodile tamer; willing as I am
  to oblige you, and clever as I am with parlour tricks, I have not yet
  succeeded in inducing a crocodile to come to heel after a week's
  acquaintance."</p>

  <p>But native people are very patient.</p>

  <p>They stood or squatted, watching the unmoved surface of the water for half
  an hour, and then suddenly there was a stir and a little gasp of pleasurable
  apprehension ran through the assembly.</p>

  <p>Then slowly the new one came up. He made for a sand-bank, which showed
  above the water in the centre of the pool; first his snout, then his long
  body emerged from the water, and Hamilton gasped.</p>

  <p>"Good heavens, Bones!" he said in a startled whisper, and his astonishment
  was echoed from a thousand throats.</p>

  <p>And well might he be amazed at the spectacle which the complacent Bones
  had secured for him.</p>

  <p>For this great reptile was more than green, he was a green so vivid that
  it put the colours of the forest to shame. A bright, glittering green and
  along the centre of his broad back one zig-zag splash of orange.</p>

  <p>"Phew," whistled Hamilton, "this is something like."</p>

  <p>The roar of approval from the people was unmistakable. The crocodile
  turned his evil head and for a moment, as it seemed to Bones, his eyes
  glinted viciously in the direction of the young and enterprising officer. And
  Bones admitted after to a feeling of panic.</p>

  <p>Then with a malignant "woof!" like the hoarse, growling bark of a dog,
  magnified a hundred times, he slid back into the water, a great living streak
  of vivid green and disappeared to the cool retreat at the bottom of the
  pool.</p>

  <p>"You have done splendidly, Bones, splendidly!" said Hamilton, and clapped
  him on the back; "really you are a most enterprising devil."</p>

  <p>"Not at all, sir," said Bones.</p>

  <p>He ate his dinner on the <i>Zaire</i>, answering with monosyllables the
  questions which Hamilton put to him regarding the quest and the place of the
  origin of this wonderful beast. It was after dinner when they were smoking
  their cigars in the gloom as the <i>Zaire</i> was steaming across its way to
  the shore where a wooding offered an excuse for a night's stay, and Bones
  gave voice to his thoughts.</p>

  <p>And curiously enough his conversation did not deal directly or indirectly
  with his discovery.</p>

  <p>"When was this boat decorated last, sir?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"About six months before Sanders left," replied Hamilton in surprise;
  "just why do you ask?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, sir," said Bones, and whistled light-heartedly. Then he returned
  to the subject.</p>

  <p>"I only asked you because I thought the enamel work in the cabin and all
  that sort of thing has worn very well."</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is good wearing stuff," said Hamilton.</p>

  <p>"That green paint in the bathroom is rather <i>chic</i>, isn't it? Is that
  good wearing stuff?"</p>

  <p>"The enamel?" smiled Hamilton. "Yes, I believe that is very good wearing.
  I am not a whale on domestic matters, Bones, but I should imagine that it
  would last for another year without showing any sign of wear."</p>

  <p>"Is it waterproof at all?" asked Bones, after another pause.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"I mean would it wash off if a lot of water were applied to it?"</p>

  <p>"No, I should not imagine it would," said Hamilton, "what makes you
  ask?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, nothing!" said Bones carelessly and whistled, looking up to the stars
  that were peeping from the sky; and the inside of Lieutenant Tibbetts was one
  large expansive grin.</p>

     id="chap11">XI. &mdash; HENRY HAMILTON BONES</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Weekly Tale-Teller</i>, 12 Dec 1914</h3>

  <p class="first">LIEUTENANT Francis Augustus Tibbetts of the Houssas was at
  some disadvantage with his chief and friend. Lieutenant F. A. Tibbetts might
  take a perfectly correct attitude, might salute on every possible occasion
  that a man could salute, might click his heels together in the German fashion
  (he had spent a year at Heidelberg), might be stiffly formal and so greet his
  superior that he contrived to combine a dutiful recognition with the cut
  direct, but never could he overcome one fatal obstacle to marked
  avoidance&mdash;he had to grub with Hamilton.</p>

  <p>Bones was hurt. Hamilton had behaved to him as no brother officer should
  behave. Hamilton had spoken harshly and cruelly in the matter of a commission
  with which he had entrusted his subordinate, and with which the aforesaid
  subordinate had lamentably failed to cope.</p>

  <p>Up in the Akasava country a certain wise man named M'bisibi had predicted
  the coming of a devil-child who should be born on a night when the moon lay
  so on the river and certain rains had fallen in the forest.</p>

  <p>And this child should be called "Ewa," which is death; and first his
  mother would die and then his father; and he would grow up to be a scourge to
  his people and a pestilence to his nation, and crops would wither when he
  walked past them, and the fish in the river would float belly up in stinking
  death, and until Ewa M'faba himself went out, nothing but ill-fortune should
  come to the N'gombi-Isisi.</p>

  <p>Thus M'bisibi predicted, and the word went up and down the river, for the
  prophet was old and accounted wise even by Bosambo of the Ochori.</p>

  <p>It came to Hamilton quickly enough, and he had sent Bones post-haste to
  await the advent of any unfortunate youngster who was tactless enough to put
  in an appearance at such an inauspicious moment as would fulfil the
  prediction of M'bisibi.</p>

  <p>And Bones had gone to the wrong village, and that in the face of his
  steersman's and his sergeant's protest that he was going wrong. Fortunately,
  by reliable account, no child had been born in the village, and the
  prediction was unfulfilled.</p>

  <p>"Otherwise," said Hamilton, "its young life would have been on your
  head."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said Bones.</p>

  <p>"I didn't tell you there were two villages called Inkau," Hamilton
  confessed, "because I didn't realize you were chump enough to go to the wrong
  one."</p>

  <p>"No, sir," agreed Bones, patiently.</p>

  <p>"Naturally," said Hamilton, "I thought the idea of saving the lives of
  innocent babes would have been sufficient incentive."</p>

  <p>"Naturally, sir," said Bones, with forced geniality.</p>

  <p>"I've come to one conclusion about you, Bones," said Hamilton.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said Bones, "that I'm an ass, sir, I think?"</p>

  <p>Hamilton nodded&mdash;it was too hot to speak.</p>

  <p>"It was an interestin' conclusion," said Bones, thoughtfully, "not without
  originality&mdash;when it first occurred to you, but as a conclusion, if you
  will pardon my criticism, sir, if you will forgive me for suggestin' as
  much&mdash;in callin' me an ass, sir: apart from its bein' contrary to the
  spirit an' letter of the Army Act&mdash;God Save the King!&mdash;it's a bit
  low, sir." And he left his superior officer without another word. For three
  days they sat at breakfast, tiffin and dinner, and neither said more
  than:</p>

  <p>"May I pass you the bread, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Thank you, sir; have you the salt, sir?"</p>

  <p>Hamilton was so busy a man that he might have forgotten the feud, but for
  the insistence of Bones, who never lost an opportunity of reminding his No. 1
  that he was mortally hurt.</p>

  <p>One night, dinner had reached the stage where two young officers of
  Houssas sat primly side by side on the verandah sipping their coffee. Neither
  spoke, and the seance might have ended with the conventional "Good night" and
  that punctilious salute which Bones invariably gave, and which Hamilton as
  punctiliously returned, but for the apparition of a dark figure which crossed
  the broad space of parade ground hesitatingly as though not certain of his
  way, and finally came with dragging feet through Sanders' garden to the edge
  of the verandah.</p>

  <p>It was the figure of a small boy, very thin; Hamilton could see this
  through the half-darkness.</p>

  <p>The boy was as naked as when he was born, and he carried in his hand a
  single paddle.</p>

  <p>"O boy," said Hamilton, "I see you."</p>

  <p>"Wanda!" said the boy in a frightened tone, and hesitated, as though he
  were deciding whether it would be better to bolt, or to conclude his
  desperate enterprise.</p>

  <p>"Come up to me," said Hamilton, kindly.</p>

  <p>He recognized by the dialect that the visitor had come a long way, as
  indeed he had, for his old canoe was pushed up amongst the elephant grass a
  mile away from headquarters, and he had spent three days and nights upon the
  river. He came up, an embarrassed and a frightened lad, and stood twiddling
  his toes on the unaccustomed smoothness of the big stoep.</p>

  <p>"Where do you come from, and why have you come?" asked Hamilton.</p>

  <p>"Lord, I have come from the village of M'bisibi," said the boy; "my mother
  has sent me because she fears for her life, my father being away on a great
  hunt. As for me," he went on, "my name is Tilimi-N'kema."</p>

  <p>"Speak on, Tilimi the Monkey," said Hamilton, "tell me why the woman your
  mother fears for her life."</p>

  <p>The boy was silent for a spell; evidently he was trying to recall the
  exact formula which had been dinned into his unreceptive brain, and to repeat
  word for word the lesson which he had learned parrotwise.</p>

  <p>"Thus says the woman my mother," he said at last, with the blank,
  monotonous delivery peculiar to all small boys who have been rehearsed in
  speech, "on a certain day when the moon was at full and the rain was in the
  forest so that we all heard it in the village, my mother bore a child who is
  my own brother, and, lord, because she feared things which the old man
  M'bisibi had spoken she went into the forest to a certain witch doctor, and
  there the child was born. To my mind," said the lad, with a curious air of
  wisdom which is the property of the youthful native from whom none of the
  mysteries of life or death are hidden, "it is better she did this, for they
  would have made a sacrifice of her child. Now when she came back, and they
  spoke to her, she said that the boy was dead. But this is the truth, lord,
  that she had left this child with the witch doctor, and now&mdash;" he
  hesitated again.</p>

  <p>"And now?" repeated Hamilton.</p>

  <p>"Now, lord," said the boy, "this witch doctor, whose name is Bogolono,
  says she must bring him rich presents at the full of every moon, because her
  son and my brother is the devil-child whom M'bisibi has predicted. And if she
  brings no rich presents he will take the child to the village, and there will
  be an end."</p>

  <p>Hamilton called his orderly.</p>

  <p>"Give this boy some chop," he said; "to-morrow we will have a longer
  palaver."</p>

  <p>He waited till the man and his charge were out of earshot, then he turned
  to Bones.</p>

  <p>"Bones," he said, seriously, "I think you had better leave unobtrusively
  for M'bisibi's village, find the woman, and bring her to safety. You will
  know the village," he added, unnecessarily, "it is the one you didn't find
  last time."</p>

  <p>Bones left insubordinately and made no response.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">BOSAMBO, with his arms folded across his brawny chest,
  looked curiously at the deputation which had come to him.</p>

  <p>"This is a bad palaver," said Bosambo, "for it seems to me that when
  little chiefs do that which is wrong, it is an ill thing; but when great
  kings, such as your master Iberi, stand at the back of such wrongdoings, that
  is the worst thing of all, and though this M'bisibi is a wise man, as we all
  know, and indeed the only wise man of your people, has brought out this
  devil-child, and makes a killing palaver, then M'ilitani will come very
  quickly with his soldiers and there will be an end to little chiefs and big
  chiefs alike."</p>

  <p>"Lord, that will be so," said the messenger, "unless all chiefs in the
  land stand in brotherhood together. And because we know Sandi loves you, and
  M'ilitani also, and that Tibbetti himself is as tender to you as a brother,
  M'bisibi sent this word saying, 'Go to Bosambo, and say M'bisibi, the wise
  man, bids him come to a great and fearful palaver touching the matter of
  several devils. Tell him also that great evil will come to this land, to his
  land and to mine, to his wife and the wives of his counsellors, and to his
  children and theirs, unless we make an end to certain devils.'"</p>

  <p>Bosambo, chin on clenched fist, looked thoughtfully at the other.</p>

  <p>"This cannot be," said he in a troubled voice; "for though I die and all
  that is wonderful to me shall pass out of this world, yet I must do no thing
  which is unlawful in the eyes of Sandi, my master, and of the great ones he
  has left behind to fulfil the law. Say this to M'bisibi from me, that I think
  he is very wise and understands ghosts and such-like palavers. Also say that
  if he puts curses upon my huts I will come with my spearmen to him, and if
  aught follows I will hang him by the ears from a high tree, though he sleeps
  with ghosts and commands whole armies of devils; this palaver is
  finished."</p>

  <p>The messenger carried the word back to M'bisibi and the council of the
  chiefs and the eldermen who sat in the palaver house, and old as he was and
  wise by all standards, M'bisibi shivered, for, as he explained, that which
  Bosambo said would he do. For this is peculiar to no race or colour, that old
  men love life dearer than young.</p>

  <p>"Bogolono, you shall bring the child," he said, turning to one who sat at
  his side, string upon string of human teeth looped about his neck and his
  eyes circled with white ashes, "and it shall be sacrificed according to the
  custom, as it was in the days of my fathers and of their fathers."</p>

  <p>They chose a spot in the forest, where four young trees stood at corners
  of a rough square. With their short bush knives they lopped the tender
  branches away, leaving four pliant poles that bled stickily. With great care
  they drew down the tops of these trees until they nearly met, cutting the
  heads so that there was no overlapping. To these four ends they fastened
  ropes, one for each arm and for each ankle of the devil child, and with other
  ropes they held the saplings to their place.</p>

  <p>"Now this is the magic of it," said M'bisibi, "that when the moon is full
  to-night we shall sacrifice first a goat, and then a fowl, casting certain
  parts into the fire which shall be made of white gum, and I will make certain
  marks upon the child's face and upon his belly, and then I will cut these
  ropes so that to the four ends of the world we shall cast forth this devil,
  who will no longer trouble us."</p>

  <p>That night came many chiefs, Iberi of the Akasava, Tilini of the Lesser
  Isisi, Efele (the Tornado) of the N'gombi, Lisu (the Seer) of the Inner
  Territories, but Lilongo[12] (as they called Bosambo of the Ochori), did not
  come.</p>

  <p>[Footnote 12: "Lilongo" is from the noun "balongo"&mdash;blood, and means
  literally "he-who-breaks-blood-friendships."&mdash;E. W.]</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">BONES reached the village two hours before the time of
  sacrifice and landed a force of twenty Houssas and a small Maxim gun. The
  village was peaceable, and there was no sign of anything untoward. Save this.
  The village was given over to old people and children. M'bisibi was an
  hour&mdash;two hours&mdash;four hours in the forest. He had gone north
  &mdash;east&mdash;south&mdash;none knew whither.</p>

  <p>The very evasiveness of the replies put Bones into a fret. He scouted the
  paths and found indications of people having passed over all three.</p>

  <p>He sent his gun back to the <i>Zaire</i>, divided his party into three,
  and accompanied by half a dozen men, he himself took the middle path.</p>

  <p>For an hour he trudged, losing his way, and finding it again. He came upon
  a further division of paths and split up his little force again.</p>

  <p>In the end he found himself alone, struggling over the rough ground in a
  darkness illuminated only by the electric lamp he carried, and making for a
  faint gleam of red light which showed through the trees ahead.</p>

  <p>M'bisibi held the child on his outstretched hands, a fat little child,
  with large, wondering eyes that stared solemnly at the dancing flames, and
  sucked a small brown thumb contentedly.</p>

  <p>"Behold this child, oh chiefs and people," said M'bisibi, "who was born as
  I predicted, and is filled with devils!"</p>

  <p>The baby turned his head so that his fat little neck was all rolled and
  creased, and said "Ah!" to the pretty fire, and chuckled.</p>

  <p>"Even now the devils speak," said M'bisibi, "but presently you shall hear
  them screaming through the world because I have scattered them," and he made
  his way to the bowed saplings.</p>

  <p>Bones, his face scratched and bleeding, his uniform torn in a dozen
  places, came swiftly after him.</p>

  <p>"My bird, I think," said Bones, and caught the child unscientifically.</p>

  <p>Picture Bones with a baby under his arm&mdash;a baby indignant, outraged,
  infernally uncomfortable, and grimacing a yell into being.</p>

  <p>"Lord," said M'bisibi, breathing quickly, "what do you seek?"</p>

  <p>"That which I have," said Bones, waving him off with the black muzzle of
  his automatic Colt. "Tomorrow you shall answer for many crimes."</p>

  <p>He backed quickly to the cover of the woods, scenting the trouble that was
  coming.</p>

  <p>He heard the old man's roar.</p>

  <p>"O people... this white man will loose devils upon the land!"</p>

  <p>Then a throwing spear snicked the trunk of a tree, and another, for there
  were no soldiers, and this congregation of exorcisers were mad with wrath at
  the thought of the evil which Tibbetti was preparing for them.</p>

  <p>"Snick!"</p>

  <p>A spear struck Bones' boot.</p>

  <p>"Shut your eyes, baby," said Bones, and fired into the brown. Then he ran
  for his life. Over roots and fallen trees he fell and stumbled, his tiny
  passenger yelling desperately.</p>

  <p>"Oh, shut up!" snarled Bones, "what the dickens are you shouting
  about&mdash;hey? Haven't I saved your young life, you ungrateful little
  devil?"</p>

  <p>Now and again he would stop to consult his illuminated compass. That the
  pursuit continued he knew, but he had the dubious satisfaction of knowing,
  too, that he had left the path and was in the forest.</p>

  <p>Then he heard a faint shot, and another, and another, and grinned.</p>

  <p>His pursuers had stumbled upon a party of Houssas.</p>

  <p>From sheer exhaustion the baby had fallen asleep. Babies were confoundedly
  heavy&mdash;Bones had never observed the fact before, but with the strap of
  his sword belt he fashioned a sling that relieved him of some of the
  weight.</p>

  <p>He took it easier now, for he knew M'bisibi's men would be frightened off.
  He rested for half an hour on the ground, and then came a snuffling leopard
  walking silently through the forest, betraying his presence only by the two
  green danger-lamps of his eyes.</p>

  <p>Bones sat up and flourished his lamp upon the startled beast, which
  growled in fright, and went scampering through the forest like the great cat
  that he was.</p>

  <p>The growl woke Bones' charge, and he awoke hungry and disinclined to
  further sleep without that inducement and comfort which his nurse was in no
  position to offer, whereupon Bones snuggled the whimpering child.</p>

  <p>"He's a wicked old leopard!" he said, "to come and wake a child at this
  time of the night."</p>

  <p>The knuckle of Bones' little finger soothed the baby, though it was a poor
  substitute for the nutriment it had every right to expect, and it whimpered
  itself to sleep.</p>

  <p>Lieutenant Tibbetts looked at his compass again. He had located the shots
  to eastward, but he did not care to make a bee-line in that direction for
  fear of falling upon some of the enemy, whom he knew would be, at this time,
  making their way to the river.</p>

  <p>For two hours before dawn he snatched a little sleep, and was awakened by
  a fierce tugging at his nose. He got up, laid the baby on the soft ground,
  and stood with arms akimbo, and his monocle firmly fixed, surveying his noisy
  companion.</p>

  <p>"What the dooce are you making all this row about?" he asked indignantly.
  "Have a little patience, young feller, exercise a little <i>suaviter in
  modo</i>, dear old baby!"</p>

  <p>But still the fat little morsel on the ground continued his noisy
  monologue, protesting in a language which is of an age rather than of a race,
  against the cruelty and the thoughtlessness and the distressing lack of
  consideration which his elder and better was showing him.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you want some grub," said Bones, in dismay; and looked round
  helplessly.</p>

  <p>He searched the pocket of his haversack, and had the good fortune to find
  a biscuit; his vacuum flask had just half a cup of warm tea. He fed the baby
  with soaked biscuit and drank the tea himself.</p>

  <p>"You ought to have a bath or something," said Bones, severely; but it was
  not until an hour later that he found a forest pool in which to perform the
  ablution.</p>

  <p>At three o'clock in the afternoon, as near as he could judge, for his
  watch had stopped, he struck a path, and would have reached the village
  before sundown, but for the fact that he again missed the path, and learnt of
  this fact about the same time he discovered he had lost his compass.</p>

  <p>Bones looked dismally at the wide-awake child.</p>

  <p>"Dear old companion in arms," he said, gloomily, "we are lost."</p>

  <p>The baby's face creased in a smile.</p>

  <p>"It's nothing to laugh about, you silly ass," said Bones.</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p class="first">"MASTER, of our Lord Tibbetti I do not know," said M'bisibi
  sullenly.</p>

  <p>"Yet you shall know before the sun is black," said Hamilton, "and your
  young men shall find him, or there is a tree for you, old man, a quick death
  by <i>Ewa</i>!"</p>

  <p>"I have sought, my lord," said M'bisibi, "all my hunters have searched the
  forest, yet we have not found him. A certain devil-pot is here."</p>

  <p>He fumbled under a native cloth and drew forth Bones' compass.</p>

  <p>"This only could we find on the forest path that leads to Inilaki."</p>

  <p>"And the child is with him?"</p>

  <p>"So men say," said M'bisibi, "though by my magic I know that the child
  will die, for how can a white man who knows nothing of little children give
  him life and comfort? Yet," he amended carefully, since it was necessary to
  preserve the character of the intended victim, "if this child is indeed a
  devil child, as I believe, he will lead my lord Tibbetti to terrible places
  and return himself unharmed."</p>

  <p>"He will lead you to a place more terrible," said M'ilitani,
  significantly, and sent a nimble climber into the trees to fasten a block and
  tackle to a stout branch, and thread a rope through.</p>

  <p>It was so effective that M'bisibi, an old man, became most energetically
  active. <i>Lokali</i> and swift messengers sent his villages to the search.
  Every half-hour the Hotchkiss gun of the <i>Zaire</i> banged noisily; and
  Hamilton, tramping through the woods, felt his heart sink as hour after hour
  passed without news of his comrade.</p>

  <p>"I tell you this, lord," said the headman, who accompanied him, "that I
  think Tibbetti is dead and the child also. For this wood is filled with
  ghosts and savage beasts, also many strong and poisonous snakes. See, lord!"
  He pointed.</p>

  <p>They had reached a clearing where the grass was rich and luxuriant, where
  overshadowing branches formed an idealic bower, where heavy white waxen
  flowers were looped from branch to branch holding the green boughs in their
  parasitical clutch. Hamilton followed the direction of his eyes. In the
  middle of the clearing a long, sinuous shape, dark brown, and violently
  coloured with patches of green and vermillion, that was swaying backward and
  forward, hissing angrily at some object before it.</p>

  <p>"Good God!" said Hamilton, and dropped his hand on his revolver, but
  before it was clear of his holster, there came a sharp crack, and the snake
  leapt up and fell back as a bullet went snip-snapping through the
  undergrowth. Then Hamilton saw Bones. Bones in his shirtsleeves, bareheaded,
  his big pipe in his mouth, who came hurriedly through the trees pistol in
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Naughty boy!" he said, reproachfully, and stooping, picked up a squalling
  brown object from the ground. "Didn't Daddy tell you not to go near those
  horrid snakes? Daddy spank you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Then he caught sight of the amazed Hamilton, clutched the baby in one
  hand, and saluted with the other.</p>

  <p>"Baby present and correct, sir," he said, formally.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"What are you going to do with it?" asked Hamilton, after
  Bones had indulged in the luxury of a bath and had his dinner.</p>

  <p>"Do with what, sir?" asked Bones.</p>

  <p>"With this?"</p>

  <p>Hamilton pointed to a crawling morsel who was at that moment looking up to
  Bones for approval.</p>

  <p>"What do you expect me to do, sir?" asked Bones, stiffly; "the mother is
  dead and he has no father. I feel a certain amount of responsibility about
  Henry."</p>

  <p>"And who the dickens is Henry?" asked Hamilton.</p>

  <p>Bones indicated the child with a fine gesture.</p>

  <p>"Henry Hamilton Bones, sir," he said grandly. "The child of the regiment,"
  he went on; "adopted by me to be a prop for my declining years, sir."</p>

  <p>"Heaven and earth!" said Hamilton, breathlessly.</p>

  <p>He went aft to recover his nerve, and returned to become an unseen
  spectator to a purely domestic scene, for Bones had immersed the squalling
  infant in his own india-rubber bath, and was gingerly cleaning him with a
  mop.</p>

  Bosambo by appointment at the junction of the rivers.</p>

  <p>"O Bosambo," said Hamilton, "I have sent for you to make a <i>likambo</i>
  because of certain things which my other eyes have seen and my other ears
  have heard."</p>

  <p>To some men this hint of report from the spies of Government might bring
  dismay and apprehension, but to Bosambo, whose conscience was clear, they
  awakened only curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Lord, I am your eyes in the Ochori," he said with truth, "and God knows I
  report faithfully."</p>

  <p>Hamilton nodded. He was yellow with fever, and the hand that filled the
  briar pipe shook with ague. All this Bosambo saw.</p>

  <p>"It is not of you I speak, nor of your people, but of the Akasava and the
  N'gombi and the evil little men who live in the forest&mdash;now is it true
  that they speak mockingly of my lord Tibbetti?"</p>

  <p>Bosambo hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Lord," said he, "what dogs are they, that they should speak of the
  mighty? Yet I will not lie to you, M'ilitani: they mock Tibbetti, because he
  is young and his heart is pure."</p>

  <p>Hamilton nodded again, and stuck out his jaw in troubled meditation.</p>

  <p>"I am a sick man," he said, "and I must rest, sending Tibbetti to watch
  the river, because the crops are good and there is fish for all men, and
  because the people are prosperous, for, Bosambo, in such times there is much
  boastfulness, and the tribes are ripe for foolish deeds deserving to appear
  wonderful in the eyes of woman."</p>

  <p>"All this I know, M'ilitani," said Bosambo, "and because you are sick, my
  heart and my stomach are sore. For though I do not love you as I love Sandi,
  who is more clever than you, yet I love you well enough to grieve. And
  Tibbetti also&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He paused.</p>

  <p>"He is young," said Hamilton, "and not yet grown to himself&mdash;now you,
  Bosambo, shall check men who are insolent to his face, and be to him as a
  strong right hand."</p>

  <p>"On my head and my life," said Bosambo, "yet, lord M'ilitani, I think that
  his day will find him, for it is written in the Sura of the Djin that all men
  are born three times, and the day will come when Bonzi will be born
  again."</p>

  <p>He was in his canoe before Hamilton realized what he had said.</p>

  <p>"Tell me, Bosambo," said he, leaning over the side of the <i>Zaire</i>,
  "what name did you call my lord Tibbetti?"</p>

  <p>"Bonzi," said Bosambo, innocently, "for such I have heard you call
  him."</p>

  <p>"Oh, dog of a thief!" stormed Hamilton. "If you speak without respect of
  Tibbetti, I will break your head."</p>

  <p>Bosambo looked up with a glint in his big, black eyes.</p>

  <p>"Lord," he said, softly, "it is said on the river 'speak only the words
  which high ones speak, and you can say no wrong,' and if you, who are wiser
  than any, call my lord 'Bonzi'&mdash;what goat am I that I should not call
  him 'Bonzi' also?"</p>

  <p>Hamilton saw the canoe drift round, saw the flashing paddles dip
  regularly, and the chant of the Ochori boat song came fainter and fainter as
  Bosambo's state canoe began its long journey northward.</p>

  <p>Hamilton reached headquarters with a temperature of 105, and declined
  Bones' well-meant offers to look after him.</p>

  <p>"What you want, dear old officer," said Bones, fussing around, "is careful
  nursin'. Trust old Bones and he'll pull you back to health, sir. Keep up your
  pecker, sir, an' I'll bring you back so to speak from the valley of the
  shadow&mdash;go to bed an' I'll have a mustard plaster on your chest in half
  a jiffy."</p>

  <p>"If you come anywhere near me with a mustard plaster," said Hamilton,
  pardonably annoyed, "I'll brain you!"</p>

  <p>"Don't you think!" asked Bones anxiously, "that you ought to put your feet
  in mustard and water, sir&mdash;awfully good tonic for a feller, sir. Bucks
  you up an' all that sort of thing, sir; uncle of mine who used to take too
  much to drink&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The only chance for me," said Hamilton, "is for you to clear out and
  leave me alone. Bones&mdash;quit fooling: I'm a sick man, and you've any
  amount of responsibility. Go up to the Isisi and watch things&mdash;it's
  pretty hard to say this to you, but I'm in your hands."</p>

  <p>Bones said nothing.</p>

  <p>He looked down at the fever-stricken man and thrust his hands in his
  pockets.</p>

  <p>"You see, old Bones," said Hamilton, and now his friend heard the
  weariness and the weakness in his voice, "Sanders has a hold on these chaps
  that I haven't quite got... and... and... well, you haven't got at all. I
  don't want to hurt your feelings, but you're young, Bones, and these devils
  know how amiable you are."</p>

  <p>"I'm an ass, sir," muttered Bones, shakily, "an' somehow I understand that
  this is the time in my jolly old career when I oughtn't to be an ass.... I'm
  sorry, sir."</p>

  <p>Hamilton smiled up at him.</p>

  <p>"It isn't for Sanders' sake or mine or your own, Bones&mdash;but
  for&mdash;well, for the whole crowd of us&mdash;white folk. You'll have to do
  your best, old man."</p>

  <p>Bones took the other's hand, snivelled a bit despite his fierce effort of
  restraint, and went aboard the <i>Zaire</i>.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"Tell all men," said B'chumbiri, addressing his impassive
  relatives, "that I go to a great day and to many strange lands."</p>

  <p>He was tall and knobby-kneed, spoke with a squeak at the end of his deeper
  sentences, and about his tired eyes he had made a red circle with camwood.
  Round his head he had twisted a wire so tightly that it all but cut the
  flesh: this was necessary, for B'chumbiri had a headache which never left him
  day or night.</p>

  <p>Now he stood, his lank body wrapped in a blanket, and he looked with dull
  eyes from face to face.</p>

  <p>"I see you," he said at last, and repeated his motto which had something
  to do with monkeys.</p>

  <p>They watched him go down the street towards the beach where the easiest
  canoe in the village was moored.</p>

  <p>"It is better if we go after him and put out his eyes," said his elder
  brother; "else who knows what damage he will do for which we must pay?"</p>

  <p>Only B'chumbiri's mother looked after him with a mouth that drooped at the
  side, for he was her only son, all the others being by other wives of
  Mochimo.</p>

  <p>His father and his uncle stood apart and whispered, and presently when,
  with a great waving of arms, B'chumbiri had embarked, they went out of the
  village by the forest path and ran tirelessly till they struck the river at
  its bend.</p>

  <p>"Here we will wait," panted the uncle, "and when B'chumbiri comes we will
  call him to land, for he has the sickness <i>mongo</i>."</p>

  <p>"What of Sandi?" asked the father, who was no gossip.</p>

  <p>"Sandi is gone," replied the other, "and there is no law."</p>

  <p>Presently B'chumbiri came sweeping round the bend, singing in his poor,
  cracked voice about a land and a people and treasures... he turned his canoe
  at his father's bidding, and came obediently to land....</p>

  <p>Overhead the sky was a vivid blue, and the water which moved quickly
  between the rocky channel of the Lower Isisi caught something of the blue,
  though the thick green of elephant grass by the water's edge and the
  overhanging spread of gum trees took away from the clarity of reflection.</p>

  <p>There was, too, a gentle breeze and a pleasing absence of flies, so that a
  man might get under the red and white striped awning of the <i>Zaire</i> and
  think or read or dream dreams, and find life a pleasant experience, and
  something to be thankful for.</p>

  <p>Such a day does not often come upon the river, but if it does, the deep
  channel of the Isisi focuses all the joy of it. Here the river runs as
  straight as a canal for six miles, the current swifter and stronger between
  the guiding banks than elsewhere. There are rocks, charted and known, for the
  bed of the river undergoes no change, the swift waters carry no sands to
  choke the fairway, navigation is largely a matter of engine power and rule of
  thumb. Going slowly up stream a little more than two knots an hour, the
  <i>Zaire</i> was for once a pleasure steamer. Her long-barrelled Hotchkiss
  guns were hidden in their canvas jackets, the Maxims were lashed to the side
  of the bridge out of sight, and Lieutenant Augustus Tibbetts, who sprawled in
  a big wicker-work chair with an illustrated paper on his knees, a nasal-toned
  phonograph at his feet, and a long glass of lemon squash at his elbow, had
  little to do but pass the pleasant hours in the most pleasant occupation he
  could conceive, which was the posting of a diary, which he hoped on some
  future occasion to publish.</p>

  <p>A shout, quick and sharp, brought him to his feet, a stiffly outstretched
  hand pointed to the waters.</p>

  <p>"What the dooce&mdash;" demanded Bones indignantly, and looked over the
  side.... He saw the pitiful thing that rolled slowly in the swift current,
  and the homely face of Bones hardened.</p>

  <p>"Damn," he said, and the wheel of the <i>Zaire</i> spun, and the little
  boat came broadside to the stream before the threshing wheel got purchase on
  the water.</p>

  <p>It was Bones' sinewy hand that gripped the poor arm and brought the body
  to the side of the canoe into which he had jumped as the boat came round.</p>

  <p>"Um," said Bones, seeing what he saw; "who knows this man?"</p>

  <p>"Lord," said a wooding man, "this is B'chumbiri who was mad, and he lived
  in the village near by."</p>

  <p>"There will we go," said Bones, very gravely.</p>

  <p>Now all the people of M'fa knew that the father of B'chumbiri and his
  uncle had put away the tiresome youth with his headache and his silly talk,
  and when there came news that the <i>Zaire</i> was beating her way to the
  village there was a hasty <i>likambo</i> of the eldermen.</p>

  <p>"Since this is neither Sandi nor M'ilitani who comes," said the chief, an
  old man, N'jela ("the Bringer"), "but Moon-in-the-Eye, who is a child, let us
  say that B'chumbiri fell into the water so that the crocodiles had him, and
  if he asks us who slew B'chumbiri&mdash;for it may be that he knows&mdash;let
  none speak, and afterwards we will tell M'ilitani that we did not understand
  him."</p>

  <p>With this arrangement all agreed; for surely here was a palaver not to be
  feared.</p>

  <p>Bones came with his escort of Houssas.</p>

  <p>From the dark interiors of thatched huts men and women watched his thin
  figure going up the street, and laughed.</p>

  <p>Nor did they laugh softly. Bones heard the chuckles of unseen people,
  divined that contempt, and his lips trembled. He felt an immense
  loneliness&mdash;all the weight of government was pressed down upon his head,
  it overwhelmed, it smothered him.</p>

  <p>Yet he kept a tight hold upon himself, and by a supreme effort of will
  showed no sign of his perturbation.</p>

  <p>The palaver was of little value to Bones; the village was blandly innocent
  of murder or knowledge of murder. More than this, all men stoutly swore that
  the thing that lay upon the foreshore for identification, surrounded by a
  crowd of frowning and frightened little boys lured by the very gruesomeness
  of the spectacle, was unknown, and laughed openly at the suggestion that it
  was B'chumbiri, who (said they) had gone a Journey into the forest.</p>

  <p>There was little short of open mockery and defiance when they pointed out
  certain indications that went to prove that this man was not of the Akasava,
  but of the higher Isisi.</p>

  <p>So Bones' visit was fruitless.</p>

  <p>He dismissed the palaver and walked back to his ship, and worked the
  river, village by village, with no more satisfactory result. That night in
  the little town of M'fa there was a dance and a jubilation to celebrate the
  cunning of a people who had outwitted and overawed the lords of the land, but
  the next day came Bosambo, who had established a system of espionage more
  far-reaching, and possibly more effective, than the service which the
  Government had instituted.</p>

  <p>Liberties they might take with Bones; but they sat discomforted in palaver
  before this alien chief, swathed in monkey tails, his shield in one hand, and
  his bunch of spears in the other.</p>

  <p>"All things I know," said Bosambo, when they told him what they had to
  tell, "and it has come to me that you have spoken lightly of Tibbetti, who is
  my friend and my master, and is well beloved of Sandi. Also they tell me that
  you smiled at him. Now I tell you there will come a day when you will not
  smile, and that day is near at hand."</p>

  <p>"Lord," said the chief, "he made with us a foolish palaver, believing that
  we had put away B'chumbiri."</p>

  <p>"And he shall return to that foolish palaver," said Bosambo grimly, "and
  if he goes away unsatisfied, behold I will come, and I will take your old
  men, and I will hang them by hooks into a tree and roast their feet. For if
  there is no Sandi and no law, behold I am Sandi and I law, doing the will of
  a certain bearded king, Togi-tani."</p>

  <p>He left the village of M'fa a little unhappy for the space of a day, when,
  native-like, they forgot all that he had said.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, up and down the river went Bones, palavers which lasted
  from sunrise to sunset being his portion.</p>

  <p>He had in his mind one vital fact, that for the honour of his race and for
  the credit of his administration he must bring to justice the man who slew
  the thing which he had found in the river. Chiefs and elders met him with
  scarcely concealed scorn, and waited expectantly to hear his strong, foreign
  language. But in this they were disappointed, for Bones spoke nothing but the
  language of the river, and little of it.</p>

  <p>He went on board the <i>Zaire</i> on the ninth night after his discovery,
  dispirited and sick at heart.</p>

  <p>"It seems to me, Ahmet," he said to the Houssa sergeant who stood waiting
  silently by the table where his meagre dinner was laid, "that no man speaks
  the truth in this cursed land, and that they do not fear me as they fear
  Sandi."</p>

  <p>"Lord, it is so," said Ahmet; "for, as your lordship knows, Sandi was very
  terrible, and then, O Tibbetti, he is an older man, very wise in the ways of
  these people, and very cunning to see their heart. All great trees grow
  slowly, O my lord! and that which springs up in a night dies in a day."</p>

  <p>Bones pondered this for a while, then:</p>

  <p>"Wake me at dawn," he said. "I go back to M'fa for the last palaver, and
  if this palaver be a bad one, be sure you shall not see my face again upon
  the river."</p>

  <p>Bones spoke truly, his resignation, written in his sprawling hand, lay
  enveloped and sealed in his cabin ready for dispatch. He stopped his steamer
  at a village six miles from M'fa, and sent a party of Houssas to the village
  with a message.</p>

  <p>The chief was to summon all eldermen, and all men responsible to the
  Government, the wearers of medals and the holders of rights, all landmen and
  leaders of hunters, the captains of spears, and the first headmen. Even to
  the witch doctors he called together.</p>

  <p>"O soldier!" said the chief, dubiously, "what happens to me if I do not
  obey his commands? For my men are weary, having hunted in the forest, and my
  chiefs do not like long palavers concerning law."</p>

  <p>"That may be," said Ahmet, calmly. "But when my lord calls you to palaver
  you must obey, otherwise I take you, I and my strong men, to the Village of
  Irons, there to rest for a while to my lord's pleasure."</p>

  <p>So the chief sent messengers and rattled his <i>lokali</i> to some
  purpose, bringing headmen and witch doctors, little and great chiefs, and
  spearmen of quality, to squat about the palaver house on the little hill to
  the east of the village.</p>

  <p>Bones came with an escort of four men. He walked slowly up the cut steps
  in the hillside and sat upon the stool to the chief's right; and no sooner
  had he seated himself than, without preliminary, he began to speak. And he
  spoke of Sanders, of his splendour and his power; of his love for all people
  and his land, and also M'ilitani, who these men respected because of his
  devilish blue eyes.</p>

  <p>At first he spoke slowly, because he found a difficulty in breathing, and
  then as he found himself, grew more and more lucid and took a larger grasp of
  the language.</p>

  <p>"Now," said he, "I come to you, being young in the service of the
  Government, and unworthy to tread in my lord Sandi's way. Yet I hold the laws
  in my two hands even as Sandi held them, for laws do not change with men,
  neither does the sun change whatever be the land upon which it shines. Now, I
  say to you and to all men, deliver to me the slayer of B'chumbiri that I may
  deal with him according to the law."</p>

  <p>There was a dead silence, and Bones waited.</p>

  <p>Then the silence grew into a whisper, from a whisper into a babble of
  suppressed talk, and finally somebody laughed. Bones stood up, for this was
  his supreme moment.</p>

  <p>"Come out to me, O killer!" he said softly, "for who am I that I can
  injure you? Did I not hear some voice say <i>g'la</i>, and is not <i>g'la</i>
  the name of a fool? O, wise and brave men of the Akasava who sit there
  quietly, daring not so much as to lift a finger before one who is a
  fool!"</p>

  <p>Again the silence fell. Bones, his helmet on the back of his head, his
  hands thrust into his pockets, came a little way down the hill towards the
  semi-circle of waiting eldermen.</p>

  <p>"O, brave men!" he went on, "O, wonderful seeker of danger! Behold! I,
  <i>g'la</i>, a fool, stand before you and yet the killer of B'chumbiri sits
  trembling and will not rise before me, fearing my vengeance. Am I so
  terrible?"</p>

  <p>His wide open eyes were fixed upon the uncle of B'chumbiri, and the old
  man returned the gaze defiantly.</p>

  <p>"Am I so terrible?" Bones went on, gently. "Do men fear me when I walk? Or
  run to their huts at the sound of my puc-a-puc? Do women wring their hands
  when I pass?"</p>

  <p>Again there was a little titter, but M'gobo, the uncle of B'chumbiri,
  grimacing now in his rage, was not amongst the laughers.</p>

  <p>"Yet the brave one who slew&mdash;"</p>

  <p>M'gobo sprang to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Lord," he said harshly, "why do you put all men to shame for your
  sport?"</p>

  <p>"This is no sport, M'gobo," answered Bones quickly. "This is a palaver, a
  killing palaver. Was it a woman who slew B'chumbiri? so that she is not
  present at this palaver. Lo, then I go to hold council with women!"</p>

  <p>M'gobo's face was all distorted like a man stricken with paralysis.</p>

  <p>"Tibbetti!" he said, "I slew B'chumbiri&mdash;according to custom
  &mdash;and I will answer to Sandi, who is a man, and understands such
  palavers."</p>

  <p>"Think well," said Bones, deathly white, "think well, O man, before you
  say this."</p>

  <p>"I killed him, O fool," said M'gobo loudly, "though his father turned
  woman at the last&mdash;with these hands I cut him, using two
  knives&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Damn you!" said Bones, and shot him dead.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Hamilton, so far convalescent that he could smoke a
  cigarette, heard the account without interruption.</p>

  <p>"So there you are, sir," said Bones at the side. "An' I felt like a jolly
  old murderer, but, dear old officer, what was I to do?"</p>

  <p>Still Hamilton said nothing, and Bones shifted uncomfortably.</p>

  <p>"For goodness gracious sake don't sit there like a bally old owl," he
  said, fretfully. "Was I wrong?"</p>

  <p>Hamilton smiled.</p>

  <p>"You're a jolly old commissioner, sir," he mimicked, "and for two pins I'd
  mention you in dispatches."</p>

  <p>Bones examined the piping of his khaki jacket and extracted the pins.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap13"
     id="chap13">XIII. &mdash; THE MAN WHO DID NOT SLEEP</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Weekly Tale-Teller</i>, 5 Dec 1914</h3>

  <p class="first">NO doubt whatever but that Lieutenant Tibbetts of the
  Houssas had a pretty taste for romance. It led him to exercise certain latent
  powers of imagination and to garnish his voluminous correspondence with
  details of happenings which had no very solid foundation in fact.</p>

  <p>On one occasion he had called down the heavy sarcasm of his superior
  officer by a reference to lions&mdash;a reference which Hamilton's sister had
  seen and, in the innocence of her heart, had referred to in a letter to her
  brother.</p>

  <p>Whereupon Bones swore to himself that he would carefully avoid
  corresponding with any person who might have the remotest acquaintance with
  the remotest of Hamilton's relatives.</p>

  <p>Every mail night Captain Hamilton underwent a cross-examination which at
  once baffled and annoyed him.</p>

  <p>Picture a great room, the walls of varnished match-boarding, the bare
  floor covered in patches by skins. There are twelve windows covered with fine
  mesh wire and looking out to the broad verandah which runs round the
  bungalow. The furniture is mainly wicker work, a table or two bearing framed
  photographs (one has been cleared for the huge gramophone which Bones has
  introduced to the peaceful life of headquarters). There are no pictures on
  the walls save the inevitable five&mdash;Queen Victoria, King Edward, Queen
  Alexandra, and in a place of honour above the door the King and his
  Consort.</p>

  <p>A great oil lamp hangs from the centre of the boarded ceiling, and under
  this the big solid table at either side of which two officers write silently
  and industriously, for the morrow brings the mail boat.</p>

  <p>Silent until Bones looked up thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Do you know the Gripps, of Beckstead, dear old fellow?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"None of your people know 'em?" hopefully.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;how the dickens do I know?"</p>

  <p>"Don't get chuffy, dear old chap."</p>

  <p>Then would follow another silence, until&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Do you happen to be acquainted with the Lomands of Fife?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"I suppose none of your people know 'em?"</p>

  <p>Hamilton would put down his pen, resignation on his face.</p>

  <p>"I have never heard of the Lomands&mdash;unless you refer to the Loch
  Lomonds; nor to the best of my knowledge and belief are any of my relations
  in blood or in law in any way acquainted with them."</p>

  <p>"Cheer oh!" said Bones, gratefully.</p>

  <p>Another ten minutes, and then:</p>

  <p>"You don't know the Adamses of Oxford, do you, sir?"</p>

  <p>Hamilton, in the midst of his weekly report, chucked down his pen.</p>

  <p>"No; nor the Eves of Cambridge, nor the Serpents of Eton, nor the Angels
  of Harrow."</p>

  <p>"I suppose&mdash;" began Bones.</p>

  <p>"Nor are my relations on speaking terms with them. They don't know the
  Adamses, nor the Cains, nor the Abels, nor the Moseses, nor the Noahs."</p>

  <p>"That's all I wanted to know, sir," said an injured Bones. "There's no
  need to peeve, sir."</p>

  <p>Step by step Bones was compiling a directory of people to whom he might
  write without restraint, providing he avoided mythical lion hunts and
  confined himself to anecdotes which were suggestively complimentary to
  himself.</p>

  <p>Thus he wrote to one pal of his at Biggestow to the effect that he was
  known to the natives as "The-Man-Who-Never-Sleeps," meaning thereby that he
  was a most vigilant and relentless officer, and the recipients of this
  information, fired with a sort of local patriotism, sent the remarkable
  statement to the <i>Biggestow Herald and Observer and Hindhead Guardian</i>,
  thereby upsetting all Bones' artful calculations.</p>

  <p>"What the devil does 'Man-Who-Never-Sleeps' mean?" asked a puzzled
  Hamilton.</p>

  <p>"Dear old fellow," said Bones, incoherently, "don't let's discuss it... I
  can't understand how these things get into the bally papers."</p>

  <p>"If," said Hamilton, turning the cutting over in his hand, "if they called
  you 'The-Man-Who-Jaws-So-Much-That-Nobody-Can-Sleep,' I'd understand it, or
  if they called you
  'The-Man-Sleeps-With-His-Mouth-Open-Emitting-Hideous-Noises,' I could
  understand it."</p>

  <p>"The fact is, sir," said Bones, in a moment of inspiration, "I'm an
  awfully light sleeper&mdash;in fact, sir, I'm one of those chaps who can get
  along with a couple of hours' sleep&mdash;I can sleep anywhere at any
  time&mdash;dear old Wellin'ton was similarly gifted&mdash;in fact, sir, there
  are one or two points of resemblance between Wellington and I, which you
  might have noticed, sir."</p>

  <p>"Speak no ill of the dead," reproved Hamilton; "beyond your eccentric
  noses I see no points of resemblance."</p>

  <p>It was on a morning following the dispatch of the mail that Hamilton took
  a turn along the firm sands to settle in his mind the problem of a certain
  Middle Island.</p>

  <p>Middle Islands, that is to say the innumerable patches of land which
  sprinkle the river in its broad places, were a never-ending problem to
  Sanders and his successor. Upon these Middle Islands the dead were laid to
  rest&mdash;from the river you saw the graves with fluttering ragged flags of
  white cloth planted about them&mdash;and the right of burial was a matter of
  dispute when the mainland at one side of the river was Isisi land, and
  Akasava the other. Also some of the larger Middle Islands were colonized.</p>

  <p>Hamilton had news of a coming palaver in relation to one of these.</p>

  <p>Now, on the river, it is customary for all who desire inter-tribal
  palavers to announce their intention loudly and insistently. And if Sanders
  had no objection he made no move, if he did not think the palaver desirable
  he stopped it. It was a simple arrangement, and it worked.</p>

  <p>Hamilton came back from his four-mile constitutional satisfied in his mind
  that the palaver should be held. Moreover, they had, on this occasion, asked
  permission. He could grant this with an easy mind, being due in the
  neighbourhood of the disputed territory in the course of a week.</p>

  <p>It seemed that an Isisi fisherman had been spearing in Akasava waters, and
  had, moreover, settled, he and his family to the number of forty, on Akasava
  territory. Whereupon an Akasava fishing community, whose rights the intruder
  had violated, rose up in its wrath and beat Issmeri with sticks.</p>

  <p>Then the king of the Isisi sent a messenger to the king of Akasava begging
  him to stay his hand "against my lawful people, for know this, Iberi, that I
  have a thousand spears and young men eager for fire."</p>

  <p>And Iberi replied with marked unpleasantness that there were in the
  Akasava territory two thousand spears no less inclined to slaughter.</p>

  <p>In a moment of admirable moderation, significant of the change which Mr.
  Commissioner Sanders had wrought in these warlike peoples, they accepted
  Hamilton's suggestion&mdash;sent by special envoy&mdash;and held a "small
  palaver," agreeing that the question of the disputed fishing ground should be
  settled by a third person.</p>

  <p>And they chose Bosambo, paramount and magnificent chief of the Ochori, as
  arbitrator. Now, it was singularly unfortunate that the question was ever
  debatable. And yet it was, for the fishing ground in question was off one of
  the many Middle Islands. In this case the island was occupied by Akasava
  fishermen on the one shore and by the intruding Isisi on the other. If you
  can imagine a big "Y" and over it a little "o" and over that again an
  inverted "Y" thus "+" and drawing this you prolong the four prongs of the
  Y's, you have a rough idea of the topography of the place. To the left of the
  lower "Y" mark the word "Isisi," to the right the word "Akasava" until you
  reach a place where the two right hand prongs meet, and here you draw a line
  and call all above it "Ochori." The "o" in the centre is the middle
  island&mdash;set in a shallow lake through which the river (the stalk, of the
  Y's) runs.</p>

  <p>Bosambo came down in state with ten canoes filled with counsellors and
  bodyguard. He camped on the disputed ground, and was met thereon by the
  chiefs affected.</p>

  <p>"O, Iberi and T'lingi!" said he, as he stepped ashore, "I come in peace,
  bringing all my wonderful counsellors, that I may make you as brothers, for
  as you know I have a white man's way of knowing all their magic, and being a
  brother in blood to our Lord Tibbetti, Moon-in-the-Eye."</p>

  <p>"This we know, Bosambo," said Iberi, looking askance at the size of
  Bosambo's retinue, "and my stomach is proud that you bring so vast an army of
  high men to us, for I see that you have brought rich food for them."</p>

  <p>He saw nothing of the sort, but he wanted things made plain at the
  beginning.</p>

  <p>"Lord Iberi," said Bosambo, loftily, "I bring no food, for that would have
  been shameful, and men would have said: 'Iberi is a mean man who starves the
  guests of his house.' But only one half of my wise people shall sit in your
  huts, Iberi, and the other half will rest with T'lingi of the Akasava, and
  feed according to law. And behold, chiefs and headmen, I am a very just man
  not to be turned this way or that by the giving of gifts or by kindness shown
  to my people. Yet my heart is so human and so filled with tenderness for my
  people, that I ask you not to feed them too richly or give them presents of
  beauty, lest my noble mind be influenced."</p>

  <p>Whereupon his forces were divided, and each chief ransacked his land for
  delicacies to feed them.</p>

  <p>It was a long palaver&mdash;too long for the chiefs.</p>

  <p>Was the island Akasava or Isisi? Old men of either nation testified with
  oaths and swearings of death and other high matters that it was both.</p>

  <p>From dawn to sunset Bosambo sat in the thatched palaver house, and on
  either side of him was a brass pot into which he tossed from time to time a
  grain of corn.</p>

  <p>And every grain stood for a successful argument in favour of one or the
  other of the contestants&mdash;the pot to the right being for the Akasava,
  and that to the left for the Isisi.</p>

  <p>And the night was given up to festivity, to the dancing of girls and the
  telling of stories and other noble exercises.</p>

  <p>On the tenth day Iberi met T'lingi secretly.</p>

  <p>"T'lingi," said Iberi, "it seems to me that this island is not worth the
  keeping if we have to feast this thief Bosambo and search our lands for his
  pleasure."</p>

  <p>"Lord Iberi," agreed his rival, "that is also in my mind&mdash;let us go
  to this robber of our food and say the palaver shall finish to-morrow, for I
  do not care whether the island is yours or mine if we can send Bosambo back
  to his land."</p>

  <p>"You speak my mind," said Iberi, and on the morrow they were blunt to the
  point of rudeness.</p>

  <p>Whereupon Bosambo delivered judgment.</p>

  <p>"Many stories have been told," said he, "also many lies, and in my wisdom
  I cannot tell which is lie and which is truth. Moreover, the grains of corn
  are equal in each pot. Now, this I say, in the name of my uncle Sandi, and my
  brother Tibbetti (who is secretly married to my sister's cousin), that
  neither Akasava nor Isisi shall sit in this island for a hundred years."</p>

  <p>"Lord, you are wise," said the Akasava chief, well satisfied, and Iberi
  was no less cheered, but asked: "Who shall keep this island free from Akasava
  or Isisi? For men may come and there will be other palavers and perhaps
  fighting?"</p>

  <p>"That I have thought of," said Bosambo, "and so I will raise a village of
  my own people on this island, and put a guard of a hundred men&mdash;all this
  I will do because I love you both&mdash;the palaver is finished."</p>

  <p>He rose in his stately way, and with his drums beating and the bright
  spearheads of his young men a-glitter in the evening sunlight, embarked in
  his ten canoes, having expanded his territory without loss to himself like
  the Imperialist he was.</p>

  <p>For two days the chiefs of the Akasava and the Isisi were satisfied with
  the justice of an award which robbed them both without giving an advantage to
  either. Then an uneasy realization of their loss dawned upon them. Then
  followed a swift exchange of messages and Bosambo's colonization scheme was
  unpleasantly checked.</p>

  <p>Hamilton was on the little lake which is at the end of the N'gini River
  when he heard of the trouble, and from the high hills at the far end of the
  lake sent a helio message staring and blinking across the waste.</p>

  <p>Bones, fishing in the river below Ikan, picked up the instructions, and
  went flying up the river as fast as the new naphtha launch could carry
  him.</p>

  <p>He arrived in time to cover the shattered remnants of Bosambo's fleet as
  they were being swept northward from whence they came.</p>

  <p>Bones went inshore to the island, the water jacket of a Maxim gun exposed
  over the bow, but there was no opposition.</p>

  <p>"What the dooce is all this about&mdash;hey?" demanded Lieutenant Tibbetts
  fiercely, and Iberi, doubly uneasy at the sound of an unaccustomed language,
  stood on one leg in his embarrassment.</p>

  <p>"Lord, the thief Bosambo&mdash;" he began, and told the story.</p>

  <p>"Lord," he concluded humbly, "I say all this though Bosambo is your
  relation since you have secretly married his sister's cousin."</p>

  <p>Whereupon Bones went very red and stammered and spluttered in such a way
  that the chief knew for sure that Bosambo had spoken the truth.</p>

  <p>Bones, as I have said before, was no fool. He confirmed Bosambo's order
  for the evacuation of the island, but left a Houssa guard to hold it.</p>

  <p>Then he hurried north to the Ochori.</p>

  <p>Bosambo formed his royal procession, but there was no occasion for it, for
  Bones was in no processional mood.</p>

  <p>"What the dooce do you mean, sir?" demanded a glaring and threatening
  Bones, his helmet over his neck, his arms akimbo. "What do you mean, sir, by
  saying I'm married to your infernal aunt?"</p>

  <p>"Sah," said Bosambo, virtuous and innocent, "I no savvy you&mdash;I no
  compreney, sah! You lib for my house&mdash;I give you fine t'ings. I make um
  moosic, sah&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You're a jolly old rotter, Bosambo!" said Bones, shaking his finger in
  the chief's face. "I could punish you awfully for telling wicked stories,
  Bosambo. I'm disgusted with you, I am indeed."</p>

  <p>"Lord who never sleeps," began Bosambo, humbly.</p>

  <p>"Hey?"</p>

  <p>Bones stared at the other in amazement, suspicion, hope, and gratification
  in his face.</p>

  <p>"O, Bosambo," said he mildly, and speaking in the native tongue, "why do
  you call me by that name?"</p>

  <p>Now, Bosambo in his innocence had used a phrase (<i>M'wani-m'wani</i>)
  which signifies "the sleepless one," and also stands in the vernacular for
  "busy-body," or one who is eternally concerned with other people's
  business.</p>

  <p>"Lord," said Bosambo, hastily, "by this name are you known from the
  mountains to the sea. Thus all men speak of you, saying: 'This is he who does
  not sleep but watches all the time.'"</p>

  <p>Bones was impressed, he was flattered, and he ran his finger between the
  collar of his uniform jacket and his scraggy neck as one will do who is
  embarrassed by praise and would appear unconcerned under the ordeal.</p>

  <p>"So men call me, Bosambo," said he carelessly "though my lord M'ilitani
  does not know this&mdash;therefore in the day when M'ilitani comes, speak of
  me as <i>M'wani-m'wani</i> that he may know of whom men speak when they say
  'the sleepless one.'"</p>

  <p>Everybody knows that <i>Cala cala</i> great chiefs had stored against the
  hour of their need certain stocks of ivory.</p>

  <p>Dead ivory it is called because it had been so long cut, but good cow
  ivory, closer in grain than the bull elephant brought to the hunter, more
  turnable, and of greater value.</p>

  <p>There is no middle island on the river about which some legend or buried
  treasure does not float.</p>

  <p>Hamilton, hurrying forward to the support of his second-in-command,
  stopped long enough to interview two sulky chiefs.</p>

  <p>"What palaver is this?" he demanded of Iberi, "that you carry your spears
  to a killing? For is not the river big enough for all, and are there no
  burying-places for your old men that you should fight so fiercely?"</p>

  <p>"Lord," confessed Iberi, "upon that island is a treasure which has been
  hidden from the beginning of time, and that is the truth&mdash;N'Yango!"</p>

  <p>Now, no man swears by his mother unless he is speaking straightly, and
  Hamilton understood.</p>

  <p>"Never have I spoken of this to the Chief of the Isisi," Iberi went on,
  "nor he to me, yet we know because of certain wise sayings that the treasure
  stays and young men of our houses have searched very diligently though
  secretly. Also Bosambo knows, for he is a cunning man, and when we found he
  had put his warriors to the seeking we fought him, lord, for though the
  treasure may be Isisi or Akasava, of this I am sure it is not of the
  Ochori."</p>

  <p>Hamilton came to the Ochori city to find a red-eyed Bones stalking
  majestically up and down the beach.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter with you?" demanded Hamilton. "Fever?"</p>

  <p>"Not at all," replied Bones, huskily; but with a fine carelessness.</p>

  <p>"You look as if you hadn't had a sleep for months," said Hamilton.</p>

  <p>Bones shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Dear old fellow," said he, "it isn't for nothing that I'm called 'the
  sleepless one'&mdash;don't make sceptical noises, dear old officer, but
  pursue your inquiries among the indigenous natives, especially Bosambo
  &mdash;an hour is all I want&mdash;just a bit of a snooze and a bath and I'm
  bright an' vigilant."</p>

  <p>"Take your hour," said Hamilton briefly. "You'll need it."</p>

  <p>His interview with Bosambo was short and, for Bosambo, painful.
  Nevertheless he unbent in the end to give the chief a job after his
  heart.</p>

  <p>Launch and steamer turned their noses down the stream, and at sunset came
  to the island. In the morning, Hamilton conducted a search which extended
  from shore to shore and he came upon the cairn unexpectedly after a two
  hours' search. He uncovered two tons of ivory, wrapped in rotten native
  cloth.</p>

  <p>"There will be trouble over this," he said, thoughtfully, surveying the
  yellow tusks. "I'll go downstream to the Isisi and collect information,
  unless these beggars can establish their claim we will bag this lot for
  government."</p>

  <p>He left Bones and one orderly on the island.</p>

  <p>"I shall be gone two days," he said. "I must send the launch to bring
  Iberi to me; keep your eyes peeled."</p>

  <p>"Sir," said Bones, blinking and suppressing a yawn with difficulty, "you
  can trust the sleepless one."</p>

  <p>He had his tent pitched before the cairn, and in the shade of a great gum
  he seated himself in his canvas chair.... He looked up and struggled to his
  feet. He was half dead with weariness, for the whole of the previous night,
  while Bosambo snored in his hut, Bones, pinching himself, had wandered up and
  down the street of the city qualifying for his title.</p>

  <p>Now, as he rose unsteadily to his feet, it was to confront Bosambo
  &mdash;Bosambo with four canoes grounded on the sandy beach of the
  island.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Bosambo!" yawned Bones.</p>

  <p>"O Sleepless One," said Bosambo humbly, "though I came in silence yet you
  heard me, and your bright eyes saw me in the little-light."</p>

  <p>"Little-light" it was, for the sun had gone down.</p>

  <p>"Go now, Bosambo," said Bones, "for it is not lawful that you should be
  here."</p>

  <p>He looked around for Ahmet, his orderly, but Ahmet was snoring like a
  pig.</p>

  <p>"Lord, that I know," said Bosambo, "yet I came because my heart is sad and
  I have sorrow in my stomach. For did I not say that you had married my
  aunt?"</p>

  <p>"Now listen whilst I tell you the full story of my wickedness, and of my
  aunt who married a white lord&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Bones sat down in his chair and laid back his head, listening with closed
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"My aunt, O Sleepless One," began Bosambo, and Bones heard the story in
  fragments. "... Coast woman... great lord... fine drier of cloth...."</p>

  <p>Bosambo droned on in a monotonous tone, and Bones, open-mouthed, his head
  rolling from side to side, breathed regularly.</p>

  <p>At a gesture from Bosambo, the man who sat in the canoe slipped lightly
  ashore. Bosambo pointed to the cairn, but he himself did not move, nor did he
  check his fluent narrative.</p>

  <p>Working with feverish, fervent energy, the men of Bosambo's party loaded
  the great tusks in the canoes. At last all the work was finished and Bosambo
  rose.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"Wake up, Bones."</p>

  <p>Lieutenant Tibbetts stumbled to his feet glaring and grimacing wildly.</p>

  <p>"Parade all correct, sir," he said, "the mail boat has just come in, an'
  there's a jolly old salmon for supper."</p>

  <p>"Wake up, you dreaming devil," said Hamilton.</p>

  <p>Bones looked around. In the bright moonlight he saw the <i>Zaire</i>
  moored to the shelving beach, saw Hamilton, and turned his head to the empty
  cairn.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!" he gasped.</p>

  <p>"O Sleepless One!" said Hamilton softly, "O bright eyes!"</p>

  <p>Bones went blundering to the cairn, made a closer inspection, and came
  slowly back.</p>

  <p>"There's only one thing for me to do, sir," he said, saluting. "As an
  officer an' a gentleman, I must blow my brains out."</p>

  <p>"Brains!" said Hamilton scornfully.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"As a matter of fact I sent Bosambo to collect the ivory
  which I shall divide amongst the three chiefs&mdash;it's perished ivory,
  anyhow; and he had my written authority to take it, but being a born thief he
  preferred to steal it; you'll find it stacked in your cabin, Bones."</p>

  <p>"In my cabin, sir!" said an indignant Bones; "there isn't room in my
  cabin, sir. How the dickens am I going to sleep?"</p>
