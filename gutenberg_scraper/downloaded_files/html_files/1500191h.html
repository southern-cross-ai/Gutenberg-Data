  <h3>NOTE</h3>

  <p class="note">Mr. Hulbert Footner's well-known character, Madame Storey, is
  perhaps the most celebrated woman detective in fiction. Her detective ability
  is aided to some extent by feminine intuition, but she achieves
  results&mdash;amazingly successful results, for the problems here elucidated
  certainly proved baffling enough to the police. This volume provides
  thrilling fare for all readers of detective stories, and Mr. Hulbert Footner
  writes with his customary verve and ingenuity.</p>

  <h2>I. &mdash; THE ALMOST PERFECT MURDER</h2>

  <h3>Presumably first published in <i>Argosy</i> under a different
  title</h3>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">Fay Brunton was one of those stars who suddenly shine out on
  Broadway in full effulgence, and are almost as quickly darkened. Most people
  will remember her name, but I doubt if many could name the parts in which she
  appeared. But to those of us who knew her, she remains a vivid and lovely
  memory; she was so beautiful! And that was not all of it; beauty is not
  uncommon on Broadway: it was her great sweetness of nature that endeared her
  to us; her girlishness; her simplicity. She was not a great actress; her
  smile was her passport to popular favour.</p>

  <p>My employer, Madame Storey, who knows everybody in the great world, had
  become acquainted with Fay, and through her I had met the girl. By degrees, I
  can hardly say how, Fay and I had become intimate friends. She brought colour
  and incident into my life. To a plain Jane like me, she was marvellous. I was
  the recipient of all her charming confidences&mdash;or nearly all; and as
  well as I could, I steered her with my advice amongst the pitfalls that beset
  a popular favourite. For one in the limelight she was incredibly ignorant of
  evil. And you could not bear to show her the ugly side of life.</p>

  <p>How bitterly I regretted that I had not warned her against Darius Whittall
  in the beginning. But I had thought that her natural goodness would protect
  her. Goodness, however, is apt to be blind. Whittall's name had been
  connected with Fay's for several months, but he was only one of many. I had
  hoped that one of the young men would win out; particularly one who was
  called Frank Esher, a fine fellow. I banked on the fact that Fay had been shy
  about mentioning his name in her confidences. As for Whittall, he was a
  notorious evil-liver. His wife had committed suicide some weeks before. To me
  he was no better than a murderer.</p>

  <p>How well I remember the morning that Fay came to our offices to tell us.
  It must have been November, for the trees in Gramercy Park had shed their
  leaves, though the grass was still green. This was during Fay's second season
  when she was appearing with huge success in <i>Wild Hyacinth</i>. She came in
  beaming, and I marked the gleam of a new pearl necklace under her
  partly-opened sables. What a vision of youthful loveliness she made,
  sparkling with a childlike excitement!</p>

  <p>She had Mrs. Brunton with her. This lady was not her real mother, but an
  ageing actress whom Fay had rescued from a cheap boarding-house, and set up
  as her official chaperone. Such an arrangement is not unusual on the stage.
  Mrs. Brunton was a typical stage mamma; over-dressed, over-talkative; a
  foolish woman, but devoted to Fay, and people put up with her on that
  account.</p>

  <p>When Fay came to call, business was dropped for the time being. I took her
  in to my mistress. What a complement they made to each other! the one so dark
  and tall and wise; the other simple, fair and girlish. Alongside my mistress,
  the girl looked the least bit colourless, but that was inevitable. There is
  only one Madame Storey. Fay was not aware that she suffered by comparison
  with the other, and if she had known, I doubt if she would have minded.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Brunton was in a great flutter. "Oh, I hope we're not interrupting
  anything important! Fay couldn't wait a minute! What I have been through
  since last night you wouldn't believe! I didn't sleep a wink! And then to be
  hauled out of my bed at eight o'clock! <i>Eight o'clock</i>! And dragged here
  half-dressed. Is there a mirror anywhere? I know I'm a sight...!"</p>

  <p>And so on; and so on. The exasperating thing about that woman was that her
  talk never meant anything. She surrounded herself with a cloud of words.
  Nobody ever paid any attention to what she said. Talk with her was a sort of
  nervous habit, like biting the fingernails.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Mme. Storey was gazing into Fay's face with searching kindness.
  Nervously pulling off one of her gloves, the girl mutely exhibited the third
  finger of her left hand. I caught a glimpse of an emerald that took my breath
  away.</p>

  <p>"Who is it?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"Darius Whittall," she murmured.</p>

  <p>It was a horrible shock to me. Fortunately none of them was looking at me
  at the moment. The thought of seeing my friend in all her youth and
  loveliness handed over to that <i>murderer</i>&mdash;for such he was in all
  essentials&mdash;was more than I could bear. The bottom seemed to drop out of
  everything.</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey's face showed no change upon hearing the announcement, though
  she must have known Darius Whittall better than I did. She enfolded the girl
  in her arms, and murmured her good wishes.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Mrs. Brunton in the background was talking away like steam
  puffing out of a boiling kettle. I perceived a certain glint of anxiety in
  the old lady's eye; she knew that Darius Whittall was no paragon for a
  husband. But he was so rich! so rich! who could blame a mother? She was
  relieved when Mme. Storey appeared to make no difficulties about the
  match.</p>

  <p>"Well, I never thought he'd be the one!" said Mme. Storey with an
  appearance of great cheerfulness.</p>

  <p>"Neither did I," said Fay, laughing.</p>

  <p>"Are you dreadfully in love with him?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose so...I don't know...Don't ask me to examine my feelings!"</p>

  <p>"Look at her!" cried Mrs. Brunton. "Isn't that enough? Radiantly
  happy!"</p>

  <p>"But if you're going to marry the man," said Mme. Storey, laughing,
  "surely you must know the state of your feelings!"</p>

  <p>"I want to marry him," said Fay quickly. "Very much. I suppose it's
  because he needs me so."</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey's expression said: Hum! But she did not utter it. She asked
  when it was going to be.</p>

  <p>"Soon," said Fay. "There's no reason for delay. It will be very quiet, of
  course."</p>

  <p>"Of course," said Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>Fay seemed to feel that some further explanation was required. "It's true
  his wife has only been dead two months," she said. "But as Darius pointed
  out, she had not been a real wife to him for years before that."</p>

  <p>"Poor woman!" said Madame Storey.</p>

  <p>We all echoed that. "Poor woman!"</p>

  <p>By this time I was aware that my mistress was not any better pleased with
  Fay's announcement than I had been; but she was too wise to burst out with
  objections as I might have done.</p>

  <p>"Why do you suppose she killed herself?" she said thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't you know?" said Fay. "She was in love with somebody else.
  Darius talks about her so nicely. He offered to let her divorce him, but she
  wouldn't because of her religion. A Catholic, you know. I suppose she could
  see no way but to end it all. Darius honours her for it."</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't talk about it!" cried Mrs. Brunton. "Don't let that cloud
  darken this happy day! How that poor man has suffered! And such a gentleman
  with it all. Such delicacy! I could tell you things about him! But never
  mind!"</p>

  <p>What has he given <i>her</i>? I thought.</p>

  <p>Fay and Mme. Storey ignored her interruption. "But <i>I</i> think," the
  former went on with gentle censure, "that she ought to have considered what a
  dreadful blow it would be to her husband."</p>

  <p>"Still," said Mme. Storey dryly, "if she had not done it, you would not be
  marrying him now."</p>

  <p>"No-o," said Fay innocently. "I suppose not...Of course Darius is going to
  sell the house at Riverdale," she continued with an involuntary shiver. "I
  shouldn't care to live there where it happened."</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey struck out on a new line. "Well! Well!" she said, "what a poor
  guesser I am! Frank Esher was the one I backed."</p>

  <p>I saw a spark of animosity leap out of the old woman's eye. I suppose it
  occurred to her, too, that my seemingly candid mistress was trying to gum her
  game.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Frank Esher!" said Fay pettishly. "Don't speak of him!"</p>

  <p>"He was so good-looking!" said Mme. Storey dreamily.</p>

  <p>"Good-looking, yes," said Fay with some heat. "But impossible. You don't
  know! Oh, impossible!"</p>

  <p>"I liked him," said Mme. Storey, "because there seemed to be a genuine
  fire in him. Most young fellows are so tame! I should have thought he would
  make a wonderful lover."</p>

  <p>Fay, silenced, looked at her with rather a stricken expression in the
  candid blue eyes.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Brunton rushed in to fill the breach. "Fire!" she snorted. "Preserve
  us from that kind of fire. That's all <i>I</i> have to say. I don't speak of
  his rudeness to me. I am nobody. He treated Fay as if she was just an
  ordinary girl. No sense of the difference in their positions. A dreadful
  young man! He spoiled everything. So different from Mr. Whittall. He is such
  a gentleman. You never catch him making a vulgar display of his
  feelings!"</p>

  <p>Fay had recovered her speech. "That incident is closed," she said. "Frank
  was simply a thorn in my side."</p>

  <p>But Mme. Storey would not let Frank drop. "By the way, what has become of
  him?" she asked. "I haven't seen him for ages."</p>

  <p>"We quarrelled," said Fay with an impatient shrug. "He Was always
  quarrelling with me. He said that would be the last time, and he went away
  somewhere. Peru or China or somewhere. Nobody knows where he's gone. Now I
  have a little peace."</p>

  <p>But the look in her eyes belied her words.</p>

  <p>There was a lot more talk. Like every young girl when she first gets
  herself engaged, Fay could hardly speak a sentence without bringing in the
  name of her lover. One would have thought Darius was the Oracle. Considering
  the manner of man he was, it was absurd and it was piteous.</p>

  <p>Darius had no objection to her finishing out the run of <i>Wild
  Hyacinth</i>. But after this season, of course, she would retire. Darius had
  bought a town house. No, not a big place on the Avenue; Darius hated show. A
  dear little house in the East Seventies; Darius had said that was the
  smartest thing now. Very plain outside, and a perfect bower within. Like a
  French maisonette. Darius had such original ideas. And so on.</p>

  <p>When they got up to go, Fay said to me wistfully: "You haven't
  congratulated me, Bella."</p>

  <p>What was I to say? The tears sprang to my eyes. Fortunately she considered
  that the emotion was suitable to the circumstances. "Oh, I want you to be
  happy! I want you to be happy!" I stammered.</p>

  <p>The words did not please her. She withdrew herself from my arms somewhat
  coldly.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">When the door closed behind them I broke down. Mme. Storey
  looked at me sympathetically. "Ah, Bella, you are very fond of her, aren't
  you?" she murmured. "This is damnable!"</p>

  <p>In my eagerness I involuntarily clasped my hands. "Ah, but you won't...you
  won't let it go on!" I implored her.</p>

  <p>"I?" she said in great surprise. "How on earth could I stop it, my
  dear?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, but you could! you could!" I wailed. "You can do anything!"</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "As an outsider I have no business to interfere. And,
  anyhow, my better sense tells me it would be worse than useless. If I said a
  word to her against her Darius, she'd rush off and marry him the same day.
  You saw how she looked at you just now...No! it's a tragedy, but it's beyond
  our mending. If I have learned anything it is that we cannot play Providence
  in the lives of others. We can only look on and pity her..."</p>

  <p>"That's what your head says," I murmured. "What about your heart?"</p>

  <p>She rose, and began to pace the long room. "Ah, don't drag in heart," she
  said, almost crossly one would have thought; "I can't set out to save every
  foolish girl who is determined to make a mess of her life!"</p>

  <p>"I can't bear it!" I said.</p>

  <p>She continued to walk up and down the long room. That room had been
  expressly chosen for its length, so that she could pace it while she was
  thinking. How well it suited her! the bare and beautiful apartment, with its
  rare old Italian furnishings and pictures. She herself was wearing a Fortuny
  gown adapted from the same period; and when you turned your back to the
  windows which looked out on matter-of-fact New York, you were transported
  right back to sixteenth century Florence.</p>

  <p>I felt that anything more I might say would only damage my suit, so I
  remained silent. But I couldn't stop the tears from running down. Mme. Storey
  looked at me uneasily every time she turned.</p>

  <p>"We must get to work," she said crossly. I obediently took up my
  note-book. "Oh, well," she said in a different tone. "For your sake,
  Bella..." She returned to her desk, and took the telephone receiver off its
  hook. "We'll see if we cannot dig up something in the circumstances
  surrounding Mrs. Whittall's death that will give this foolish girl cause to
  stop and think what she is doing."</p>

  <p>She called up Police Headquarters. "Rumsey," she said, "do you remember
  the case of Mrs. Darius Whittall who killed herself about two months
  ago?...Well, I suppose there was an inquest or investigation of some sort,
  and that the findings are on file somewhere. Come and see me this afternoon,
  will you? and bring the papers with you. I want to go over them with
  you...I'll tell you when I see you...Thanks, at four then. Good-bye."<br></p>

  <p>Our worthy friend arrived promptly to his hour. Inspector Rumsey was not a
  distinguished-looking man, but he was true-blue. He owed part of his
  reputation, perhaps, to his friendship for my mistress, who often helps him
  with the more subtle points of his cases. He in return, I need hardly say, is
  able to render us invaluable assistance.</p>

  <p>The papers he laid before my mistress told a simple and straightforward
  tale. On the night of Sunday, September 11th, Mrs. Whittall had dined alone
  at their place in Riverdale. Her husband was dining with friends in the city.
  After dinner, that is to say about nine-thirty, she had complained of the
  heat, and had asked her maid, Mary Thole, for a light wrap, saying that she
  would walk in the grounds for a few minutes. Almost immediately after she
  left the house, the sound of a shot was heard. Everybody in the house heard
  it, since the windows were all open.</p>

  <p>The butler and the second man rushed out to the spot whence it came, a
  little pavilion or summer-house placed on a slight knoll overlooking the
  river, about two hundred yards from the house. They found the body of their
  mistress lying at full length on the gravel outside the entrance to the
  pavilion. She had evidently fallen with considerable force, for her hair was
  partly down, the hairpins lying about. An ornamental comb which she wore was
  found about four feet from her body. One of her slippers was off. So it was
  judged that she had shot herself within the pavilion, and had fallen
  backwards down the steps. There were three steps. There was a bullet hole in
  her right temple, and so far as the servants could judge she was already
  dead. The revolver was still lying in her partly opened hand. Upon a
  microscopic examination of the gun later, the prints upon it were found to be
  those of Mrs. Whittall's fingers.</p>

  <p>The body was immediately carried into the house and laid upon the bed. The
  family physician was telephoned for. The powder marks around the wound could
  be seen by all. In his confusion and excitement, the butler felt that he
  ought to notify his master of what had happened before sending for the
  police. Nobody in the house knew where Mr. Whittall was dining that night,
  and the butler started telephoning around to his clubs, and to the houses of
  his most intimate friends in the endeavour to find him. He could not get any
  word of him. He was still at the telephone when Mr. Whittall returned home.
  This would be about eleven. Mr. Whittall's first act was to telephone to the
  local police station. He upbraided the butler for not having done so at once.
  A few minutes later the police were in the house.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Whittall's own maid had identified the revolver as one belonging to
  her mistress. She had testified that she had seen nothing strange in the
  behaviour of her mistress before she left the house. So far as she could
  tell, there was nothing special on her mind. She was a very quiet lady, and
  saw little company. She had left no letter in explanation of her act. Not
  more than a minute or so could have elapsed between the time she left the
  house and the sound of the shot, so she must have proceeded direct to the
  pavilion and done the deed. Indeed, it happened so quickly it seemed as if
  she must have run there.</p>

  <p>The doctor testified that Mrs. Whittall was dead when he saw her. Death
  must have been instantaneous. The bullet had passed through her brain and was
  lodged against the skull on the other side from the point of entrance.
  Questioned as to her possible reasons for the deed, he said he knew of none.
  The dead woman was in normal health, and though he had known her for many
  years, and was a friend, she did not often have occasion to send for him in a
  professional capacity. She seemed normal in mind. He admitted though, that
  she might have been seriously disturbed without his knowing anything of it,
  since she was a very reticent woman, who spoke little about her own
  affairs.</p>

  <p>Mr. Whittall testified that the revolver found in the dead woman's hand
  was one which he had given her some three months previously. It was a Matson,
  32 calibre, an automatic of the latest pattern. She had not asked for a gun.
  He had given it to her of his own motion, believing that every woman ought to
  have the means of defending herself at hand. He did not know for sure if she
  had ever practised shooting it, but he believed not. Only one shot had been
  fired from it. He understood that she had kept it in the top drawer of the
  chiffonier in her room, but he had never seen it there. He had not noticed
  anything unwonted in her behaviour on that day, or he would never have left
  her alone. It was true, though, that she had suffered from periods of deep
  depression. She brooded on the fact that she had no children, and looked
  forward with dread to a childless old age.</p>

  <p>Such, in effect, were the contents of the papers which Inspector Rumsey
  spread before us. Tea and cigarettes followed. Mme. Storey looked
  disappointed at the outcome.</p>

  <p>"Merely a perfunctory investigation, of course," said Inspector Rumsey.
  "Nobody suspected there might be something peculiar in the case. Nobody
  wished to turn up anything peculiar."</p>

  <p>"I had hoped that there would be enough in these papers to accomplish my
  purpose," said Mme. Storey gravely. "By showing them to a certain person, I
  mean. But there is not. So we must dig further into this business. It is not
  a job that I look forward to!"</p>

  <p>"What can you expect to do now, after two months?" said the Inspector.</p>

  <p>"Oh, there are plenty of leads. Firstly: if Mr. Whittall was dining in New
  York that night, it is strange that he should have arrived home in Riverdale
  as early as eleven."</p>

  <p>"Right!"</p>

  <p>"Secondly: if it was such a hot night, why should Mrs. Whittall have
  called for a wrap? When one steps outside to cool off, one doesn't wrap up.
  It is indicated that she meant to stay out awhile."</p>

  <p>"Right!"</p>

  <p>"Thirdly: Whittall's explanation of his wife's alleged depression is mere
  nonsense. It is a simple matter for a rich woman to adopt a child if she is
  lonely."</p>

  <p>The Inspector nodded.</p>

  <p>"Fourthly: when a person shoots himself dead one of two things happens.
  Occasionally the grip on the gun is spasmodic, and remains fixed in death.
  More often in the act of death all the muscles relax. In that case when she
  fell from the steps the gun would have been knocked from her hand, just as
  the comb was knocked from her head. As a matter of fact, they say the gun was
  found lying in her <i>open hand</i>. I am forced to the conclusion that it
  was placed there afterwards."</p>

  <p>I looked at her, struck with horror.</p>

  <p>"In that case she must have been decoyed to the pavilion," said the
  Inspector.</p>

  <p>"That is for us to find out."</p>

  <p>"The double identification of the gun as hers is an awkward point to get
  over," he suggested.</p>

  <p>"Matson 32's are sold by the hundreds," said Mme. Storey. "There is no
  evidence that this one bore any distinguishing marks. Why not another of the
  same design?"</p>

  <p>"In that case Mrs. Whittall's gun would have been found."</p>

  <p>"Maybe it was."</p>

  <p>The Inspector slowly nodded. "A case begins to shape itself," he said.
  "What do you want me to do?"</p>

  <p>"It is not yet a matter of public interest," said Mme. Storey. "As soon as
  we have sufficient evidence that it is, we will put it in your hands. In the
  meantime I wish you'd trace where and when Whittall bought the gun that he
  gave his wife, and the number of it. You have better facilities for doing
  that than I have."</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">A pleasant-faced young woman, very neatly and plainly
  dressed, came into my office somewhat shyly, and mutely offered me a printed
  slip which had been filled in. I read at a glance that the bearer was Mary
  Thole, who had been sent by Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;'s Employment Agency as an
  applicant for the position of maid. One of our operatives had brought about
  this visit without the girl's suspecting what we wanted of her. I looked at
  her with a strong interest. Through my association with Mme. Storey I have
  learned to read character to some degree, and I said to myself that the lady
  who secured this girl would be lucky. Good servants are rare.</p>

  <p>I took her in to Madame Storey.</p>

  <p>"Do you know who I am?" asked my mistress.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Madame, I read in the papers..."</p>

  <p>"Good! then you know something of my business. I may as well tell you at
  once that I do not need a maid. That was merely a pretext."</p>

  <p>The girl looked at her, greatly startled.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you have nothing to fear," Mme. Storey went on. "I merely wished to
  satisfy myself that you were an honest and a faithful girl. I am satisfied of
  it. I mean to be frank with you. Mr. Whittall has engaged himself to marry a
  friend of mine, a beautiful young girl. I think that is a great shame."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, Madame!" she said earnestly. "He...he is not a good man!"</p>

  <p>"So I think myself," said Mme. Storey dryly. "I want you to tell me all
  the circumstances surrounding Mrs. Whittall's death."</p>

  <p>The girl's eyes widened in horror, and she pressed one hand to her cheek.
  "Oh, Madame, do you think...do you think...that <i>he</i>...!"</p>

  <p>"Hush!" said Mme. Storey. "Answer my questions carefully, and we'll
  see."</p>

  <p>The girl went on in a daze, more to herself than to us: "Of course, I
  always knew it was due to him...in a way...he made it impossible for her to
  live...but I never thought that he might actually..."</p>

  <p>"Don't jump to conclusions," warned Mme. Storey. She reseated herself at
  her desk.</p>

  <p>"May I ask you something?" said Mary humbly.</p>

  <p>"Certainly."</p>

  <p>"Is it...is it the beautiful young actress, Miss Brunton?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. What put that into your head?"</p>

  <p>"Well, it came to my mistress's ears that her name was being connected
  with Mr. Whittall's, and she heard she was a nice girl, so it seemed a great
  shame to her on the girl's account. So she asked Miss Brunton and her mother
  to come to Oakhurst&mdash;that was the name of the house&mdash;to lunch and
  spend the afternoon. She wanted to stop any scandal that was going about,
  that might hurt the girl. That was the sort of woman she was; thinking of
  everybody before herself."</p>

  <p>"Hm!" said my mistress, "and did they come?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Madame, and my mistress told me the girl was a dear&mdash;that was
  her own word, and she hoped she could really make friends with her."</p>

  <p>"Was Mr. Whittall present at this luncheon?"</p>

  <p>"No, Madame. My mistress had fixed a day when she knew he would be out of
  town."</p>

  <p>"When was this?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot say to a day. Late in August some time. Two weeks, maybe three,
  before my mistress died."</p>

  <p>"What can you tell me about that visit?"</p>

  <p>"Not much, Madame. I was busy about my work, of course. When the car drove
  up to carry them away, I peeped out of the window, and I had a glimpse of the
  young lady, as she turned around to say good-bye. Such a beautiful young
  lady! She was happy and smiling, so I supposed everything had gone well."</p>

  <p>"You cannot tell me anything they did?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, except I heard they had tea sent out to the pavilion."</p>

  <p>"Who served it?"</p>

  <p>"The butler would be at the tea-wagon, Madame, and the second man
  serving."</p>

  <p>"What were the relations, generally, between Mr. and Mrs. Whittall?" asked
  Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>Mary looked uncomfortable. She said in a low voice: "They were living
  apart, Madame&mdash;though under the same roof, since before I came. They
  never quarrelled before the servants, of course. They were cold to each
  other. It was the gossip among the servants that Mr. Whittall was always
  trying to persuade her to get a divorce, and she wouldn't because it was
  against the laws of her church."</p>

  <p>"So is self-destruction," remarked Mme. Storey gravely.</p>

  <p>Mary looked up quickly. Evidently this was a new thought to her.</p>

  <p>"You considered that Mrs. Whittall was an unhappy woman?" asked Mme.
  Storey.</p>

  <p>The girl nodded. "But I never heard her complain," she added quickly.</p>

  <p>"Had she ever spoken of adopting a child?"</p>

  <p>"Not seriously, Madame. Once I heard her say that a child was entitled to
  a father as well as a mother."</p>

  <p>"Now let us come to the day of the tragedy," said Mme. Storey. "I want you
  to tell me everything that happened that day, beginning with the
  morning."</p>

  <p>"I can't tell you much," said Mary. "What happened at night seems to have
  driven it all out of my head...It was Sunday. I suppose Madame went to early
  mass as usual. She would not let me get up on Sunday mornings to dress her,
  nor would she have the car. She walked to church. Then came breakfast. I
  tidied up her room then. I don't remember anything about the morning; I
  suppose she was writing letters. After lunch she slept; I dressed her when
  she got up. I scarcely saw her during the day. She wanted us to rest on
  Sundays. Dinner was always earlier; half-past six. I had heard downstairs
  that the master was dining out. Mrs. Whittall didn't dress for dinner on
  Sundays. She came up from the table in less than half an hour. I was in her
  room then..."</p>

  <p>"How did she look?"</p>

  <p>"Quite as usual, Madame. Calm and pale."</p>

  <p>"What happened then?"</p>

  <p>"A few minutes later a special delivery letter was brought to the
  door."</p>

  <p>"Ha!" said Mme. Storey. "Why was this never mentioned before?"</p>

  <p>"Nobody asked me about it, Madame." For the first time an evasive note
  sounded in the girl's honest voice.</p>

  <p>"Was not such a thing very unusual?"</p>

  <p>"No, Madame. Mrs. Whittall's mail was very large, she was interested in so
  many charities and committees. So many people wrote to her asking for one
  thing or another. There were often special delivery letters; telegrams
  too."</p>

  <p>"Did you have this letter in your hands?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Madame. I carried it from the door to my mistress."</p>

  <p>"Describe it."</p>

  <p>"Just an ordinary white envelope with the address written on it. No
  printing."</p>

  <p>"Did you recognise the handwriting?"</p>

  <p>"No, Madame."</p>

  <p>"Was it a man's handwriting?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I just gave it a careless glance."</p>

  <p>Again the evasive note. However, Mme. Storey chose to ignore it.</p>

  <p>"Then what happened?"</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Whittall said she wouldn't want me any more, and I went away."</p>

  <p>"Then?"</p>

  <p>"After a while, an hour maybe, she sent for me back again."</p>

  <p>"You found her changed then?"</p>

  <p>Mary looked at Mme. Storey in a startled way. "Y-yes, Madame," she
  faltered. "Her cheeks were red. She was nervous. She tried to hide it."</p>

  <p>"Where was the letter then?"</p>

  <p>"It wasn't anywhere about. It was never seen again."</p>

  <p>"Was there a fireplace in the room?"</p>

  <p>Mary looked frightened again. "Y-yes, Madame."</p>

  <p>"Did you not look there afterwards&mdash;next day perhaps?"</p>

  <p>The girl hung her head. "Y-yes, Madame."</p>

  <p>"And found some scraps of burned paper?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Madame." This very low. "I swept them up."</p>

  <p>Once more, to my surprise, Mme. Storey dropped this line of questioning
  for the moment. "What did Mrs. Whittall say to you?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"She said her afternoon dress was too hot, Madame, and she wanted to
  change. So I started to get a négligée from the wardrobes, but she said no,
  she had a fancy to put on her blue net evening dress that she had never worn.
  She wanted her hair done in a different way, too. I was a long time dressing
  her. It was the first time I had ever found her hard to suit. At the end she
  asked for her blue velvet evening cloak, as she wanted to walk in the grounds
  for the cool."</p>

  <p>"Had she ever done that before?"</p>

  <p>"Not as far as I know, Madame."</p>

  <p>"Describe the blue dress."</p>

  <p>"A simple little frock, Madame. Just a plain, tight bodice of charmeuse,
  and a full skirt of net in points over underskirts of malines. A scarf of
  blue malines went with it. She had never worn it because she said it was too
  young for her."</p>

  <p>"How old was Mrs. Whittall?"</p>

  <p>"Thirty-seven, Madame...She wasn't old at all!" the girl went on warmly.
  "She was beautiful! She was beautiful all over!"</p>

  <p>"Where did she keep her revolver?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"In the top drawer of the chiffonier in the bedroom. I could feel it lying
  at the bottom of the drawer when I put things away."</p>

  <p>"Were you in the bedroom when you were dressing her that Sunday
  night?"</p>

  <p>"No, Madame; in the dressing-room, which adjoined."</p>

  <p>"Did she leave the room at any time while you were dressing her?"</p>

  <p>"No, Madame."</p>

  <p>"Did you leave the room?"</p>

  <p>"No, Madame. The wardrobes were right there along the wall."</p>

  <p>"When she was dressed, who left the room first?"</p>

  <p>"She did, Madame. I remained to tidy things up. I was still in the
  dressing-room when I heard...when I heard..."</p>

  <p>"I know," said Mme. Storey gently. "Please attend well to what I am going
  to ask you. When Mrs. Whittall left the room where did she go?"</p>

  <p>"Out through the door into the hall, Madame, and down the stairs. I heard
  her heels on the stairs. She was in a hurry."</p>

  <p>"She did not go into the bedroom first?"</p>

  <p>"No, Madame."</p>

  <p>"Did she have anything in her hands when she went out of the
  dressing-room?"</p>

  <p>"No, Madame."</p>

  <p>"Did the blue cloak have a pocket in it?"</p>

  <p>"Only a tiny pocket inside for a handkerchief." Mary held up thumb and
  finger, indicating a space of an inch and a half.</p>

  <p>"Would it have been possible for her to conceal the revolver inside that
  tight bodice?"</p>

  <p>"No, Madame."</p>

  <p>"Then I ask you, was it possible that she could have carried her revolver
  out of the house with her?"</p>

  <p>The girl stared at her with wide eyes of horror. "No, Madame! No! No!...I
  never thought it out before...Oh, my poor mistress!"</p>

  <p>She broke down completely. Mme. Storey lit a cigarette, to give her time
  to recover herself.</p>

  <p>"Well, after that we know pretty well what happened," my mistress said
  soothingly. "Just a few more questions...Did it occur to you at any time
  before your master came home, to look in the chiffonier drawer to see if Mrs.
  Whittall's gun was there?"</p>

  <p>"No, Madame. I never thought. I scarcely knew what I was doing."</p>

  <p>"When did you first see Mr. Whittall?"</p>

  <p>"He came running up the stairs to the bedroom where the...where the body
  was lying. He ordered us all out of the room. 'I must be alone with my dead!'
  he said. Those were his words. Very dramatic."</p>

  <p>"Hm!" said Mme. Storey with a hard smile. "And then?"</p>

  <p>"In just a minute he called me back into the room by myself, and started
  to question me, very excited."</p>

  <p>"What sort of questions?"</p>

  <p>"I can't remember exactly...Like the questions you were asking me. What
  she was doing all day? What made her go out, and so on."</p>

  <p>"Did you tell him about the letter which came?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Madame, because he asked if any message had come."</p>

  <p>"What did he say when you told him about the letter?"</p>

  <p>"He didn't say anything, then. Later, when we were waiting to be
  questioned by the police, he sort of said to me and Mr. Frost, the butler,
  and Mr. Wilkins, the second man&mdash;we were the only ones who knew about
  the letter; he said maybe it would be better if nothing was said about it,
  and we agreed, of course, not wishing to raise any scandal about the
  mistress."</p>

  <p>"What can you tell me about his subsequent actions?"</p>

  <p>"Well, Madame, whenever he got a chance, I saw him looking, looking about
  the sitting-room and the bedroom..."</p>

  <p>"For the letter?"</p>

  <p>"So I supposed."</p>

  <p>"Did you know then that it had been burned?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Madame; I had looked before he came home."</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you tell him it had been burned?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't want to give him that satisfaction."</p>

  <p>"What else?"</p>

  <p>"Well, as long as the police were in the house, Mr. Whittall was right
  there with them. After they had gone he went out. He took a flashlight with
  him, because I could see it flashing down the path to the pavilion. Then I
  lost him. He was out of the house about ten minutes. When he came back he
  wanted me to go to bed. But I asked to stay up...by her. He went to bed."</p>

  <p>"Can you tell me what became of the pistol that was found in Mrs.
  Whittall's hand?"</p>

  <p>"The police captain took it away with him that night. Later I heard that
  Mr. Whittall had given it to him."</p>

  <p>"Now to go back," said Mme. Storey. "When your mistress sent for you to
  dress her, you said you found her excited. Do you mean pleasurably so?"</p>

  <p>"Yes...no...I can hardly say, Madame. When I thought over it afterwards, I
  supposed she had made up her mind then to end it all, and was just sort of
  wrought up."</p>

  <p>"That was reasonable. But you know now that you were wrong."</p>

  <p>Mary nodded. "I don't know what to think now," she said unhappily.</p>

  <p>"That letter," said Mme. Storey&mdash;and Mary instantly began to look
  nervous, "what do you think was in it, Mary?"</p>

  <p>"How should I know?" she said. "A girl like me, just a lady's maid."</p>

  <p>"But you thought it had something to do with the tragedy."</p>

  <p>"Not direct."</p>

  <p>"Well, indirectly, then."</p>

  <p>"Whatever I may have thought is proved wrong now."</p>

  <p>"Tell me what you thought."</p>

  <p>"I don't think I ought," was the stubborn reply. "I told you the truth
  when I said I didn't know the handwriting. It was only a guess."</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey tried another tack. "Mary," she said, "Mr. Whittall has told
  his fiancée that his wife killed herself because she was in love with another
  man."</p>

  <p>"That's a lie!" she said excitedly. "At least, the way he means it. My
  mistress was a good woman!"</p>

  <p>"I am sure of it!" said Mme. Storey gravely. "But I can also understand
  how a woman, married to a man like Whittall, might conceive an honourable
  love for another man, and still remain true to her marriage vows."</p>

  <p>The girl broke into a helpless weeping. Still she stubbornly held her
  tongue.</p>

  <p>At length Mme. Storey said: "Mary, your mistress was foully murdered.
  Don't you want to see justice done?"</p>

  <p>"Yes!...Yes!" she sobbed. "But I don't see how he could have done it. I
  don't know what to think! I don't see any use in raking up a scandal!"</p>

  <p>"The whole story must be opened to the light now," said Mme. Storey
  gravely. "If that is done, no possible blame can attach to your mistress's
  name. Wouldn't you rather tell me here than be forced to tell in open
  court?"</p>

  <p>Mary nodded.</p>

  <p>"Then, Mary, from whom did you think that letter had come?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Barry Govett," she whispered.</p>

  <p>I exclaimed inwardly. Barry Govett!</p>

  <p>"You mustn't lay too much on that!" Mary went on, as well as she could for
  sobbing. "I am ready to swear there was nothing wrong between them. I don't
  believe they ever saw each other alone but once. That was at our house in the
  summer. Mr. Govett called unexpected. He didn't stay but an hour. I happened
  to go into my mistress's sitting-room where they were, and I saw them. I saw
  by the way they looked at each other how...how it was with them both. How it
  would always be. I had never seen anything like that..." She was unable to go
  on.</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p class="first">Barry Govett was the most prominent bachelor in New York
  society. I had been reading about him in the papers for years. His name
  regularly headed the list of men present at every fashionable entertainment,
  and one was continually being informed of his visiting this great person or
  that in Newport, Saratoga, Lenox, Tuxedo and Palm Beach. Prominent as he was
  at this time, he must have been still more prominent a few years ago when the
  cotillon was still a feature of every ball. I have always wondered what a
  cotillon was. Barry Govett was the cotillon leader <i>par excellence</i>.
  They said then that one had to engage him months ahead.</p>

  <p>All this I had gathered from the gossip weeklies, which, like every other
  stenographer whose social life was limited to a boarding-house, I used to
  read with avidity. Barry Govett was their <i>pièce de resistance</i>. Before
  all this happened, he was once pointed out to me in court costume at a great
  fancy dress ball; and I thought then that he had the most beautifully turned
  leg I had ever seen on a man. He must have been over forty then, but still
  conveyed the effect of a young man; very handsome in his style. But too much
  the cotillon leader for me. When I thought over this I wondered what a woman
  like Mrs. Whittall could have seen in him. One never knows!</p>

  <p>The moment he entered the outer office I was aware of a personality. Of
  course, no man could occupy so lofty a position for years, even if it was
  only at the head of a frivolous society, without acquiring great aplomb.
  Close at hand in the daylight, I saw that there was little of the youth
  remaining about him, though his figure was still slim, but I liked him better
  than I had expected. He had a long, oval face, almost ascetic looking, with
  nice blue eyes, though they were always pleasantly watchful, and betrayed
  little. He was wonderfully turned out, of course, but nothing spectacular. It
  was the perfection of art that conceals art. I was immediately sensible of
  his charm too, though I had discounted it in advance. The smile and the bow
  conveyed no intimation that he saw in me merely the humble secretary.</p>

  <p>I took him in to Mme. Storey. She was playing the great lady that
  afternoon, and the black ape Giannino in green cap and jacket with golden
  bells was seated in the crook of her left arm. Mr. Govett hastened forward,
  and gracefully kissed her hand. I wondered if Giannino would snatch at his
  none-too-well-covered poll. We were always amused to see how the ape would
  receive a new person. He is an individual of very strong likes and dislikes.
  However, he only made a face at Mr. Govett, and hissed amicably. Indeed, Mr.
  Govett held out his elbow, and Giannino hopped upon it, and stroked his face.
  This was a great victory.</p>

  <p>"Dear lady!" said Mr. Govett, "this is an undeserved privilege. To be
  invited to tea with you, and" (looking around the room) "alone!"</p>

  <p>"Just me and Giannino and my friend Miss Brickley," said Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>He whirled around and bowed to me again, murmuring: "Charmed!" My hand was
  horribly self-conscious in the expectation that he might offer to kiss it. I
  wondered if it was quite clean. Which way would I look! I could see too that
  Mme. Storey was wickedly hoping that he might. Fortunately he did not.</p>

  <p>"Miss Brickley has been dying to meet you," she said slyly.</p>

  <p>"Ah! you do me too much honour!" he said.</p>

  <p>I was rather fussed, and therefore I was bound not to show It. "Well,
  you're such a famous man," I said.</p>

  <p>"Now you're spoofing me," he said. "It's not much to be a hero of the
  society notes, is it?"</p>

  <p>Tea was waiting, and we attacked it forthwith. Mr. Govett, stroking
  Giannino's pompadour, and feeding him sugar, supplied most of the
  conversation. His gossip was extremely amusing, without being
  malicious&mdash;well not <i>very</i> malicious. No doubt he suited his talk
  to his company.</p>

  <p>Had we heard that Bessie Van Brocklin was going to give a zoological
  dinner? It was in honour of her new cheetah. He didn't know quite what a
  cheetah was; the name sounded ominous. The Princess Yevrienev had promised to
  bring her lion cubs, and the Goldsby-Snows would be on hand with their
  falcons. Somebody else had a wolf, and he had heard a rumour that there was
  an anaconda being kept in the dark. Oh, and of course, there were plenty of
  monkeys in society, zoological and otherwise. It ought to be a brilliant
  affair.</p>

  <p>Had we heard the latest about Freddy Vesey? Freddy had been dining with
  the Stickneys, who were the last householders on Madison Square. Carried away
  by his boyhood recollections of old New York, Freddy had leaped into the
  fountain, causing great excitement among the park-benchers. An Irish
  policeman was convinced that it was an attempted suicide. Freddy had argued
  with him at length from the middle of the fountain. Freddy had refused to
  come out until the policeman promised to let him off. No, Freddy had not
  undressed before jumping in, he was happy to say, and thereby the world was
  saved a shocking disclosure of the means by which he preserved his ever
  youthful figure.</p>

  <p>All the while this was going on, I could see that Mr. Govett was wondering
  why he had been asked to tea with us. He knew, of course, that we had
  something more to do than gossip in that place. But he betrayed no particular
  anxiety.</p>

  <p>Finally they lighted their cigarettes. Giannino, who adores cigarettes,
  though they invariably make him sick, coolly stole Mr. Govett's from between
  his lips, and fled up to the top of a picture frame, where he sat and mocked
  at us. I dislodged him with a stick which I keep for the purpose, and
  depriving him of his booty, carried him to his little house in the middle
  room. When I came back Mme. Storey was saying: "Have you heard that Darius
  Whittall is going to marry Fay Brunton?"</p>

  <p>"That was a foregone conclusion, wasn't it?" said Mr. Govett with a
  shrug.</p>

  <p>"Not to me!"</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes, of course, the adorable Brunton is a friend of yours." I could
  see by his eyes that he was thinking: Is <i>this</i> what I was brought here
  for?</p>

  <p>"Is Whittall a friend of yours?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"No!" he said shortly.</p>

  <p>"Barry, you and I have known each other for a good many years," said Mme.
  Storey, "and I have confidence in your discretion, though you always
  make-believe not to have any..."</p>

  <p>"Thanks, dear lady."</p>

  <p>"What do you think of me?"</p>

  <p>"I think you're an angel!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, not that tosh!"</p>

  <p>"I think you're the greatest woman in New York!"</p>

  <p>"That's not what I want either. In all these affairs that I have been
  engaged in, are you satisfied that I have always taken the side of
  decency?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes!" he said quite simply. "What a question!"</p>

  <p>"Good! Then I ask for your confidence in this affair. I am investigating
  the circumstances surrounding the death of Mrs. Whittall."</p>

  <p>He gave a start, which he instantly controlled. One could not have said
  that he showed more than anybody might have shown upon hearing such an
  announcement. "Good Heavens!" he murmured, "do you think there was anything
  more than..."</p>

  <p>"She was murdered, Barry."</p>

  <p>"Oh, my God!" he whispered. His face turned greyish; his hands shook. I
  thought the man was going to faint; but even while I looked at him, he
  steadied himself. I never saw such an exhibition of self-control. He drew a
  long breath.</p>

  <p>"How can I help?" he asked quietly.</p>

  <p>"By being quite frank with me."</p>

  <p>He looked at me in a meaning way.</p>

  <p>"Miss Brickley is familiar with all the circumstances," said Mme. Storey,
  "and she possesses my entire confidence. Nothing that transpires in this room
  is ever heard outside of it, unless I choose that it shall be."</p>

  <p>"Of course," he murmured. "Still, I don't see how <i>I</i>..."</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Whittall was lured out to the pavilion by a letter which we have
  reason to suppose she thought you had written."</p>

  <p>He jumped up involuntarily, staring at her like one insane; then dropped
  limply into his chair again. It was some moments before he could speak. "But
  I never wrote to her in my life!"</p>

  <p>"Then how could she have known your handwriting?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"Well, I mean nothing but social notes; answers to invitations and so on."
  He saw that he had made a slip, and added hastily: "How do you know that she
  <i>did</i> recognise my handwriting?"</p>

  <p>"We mustn't waste the afternoon fencing with each other," said Mme. Storey
  mildly. "You are aware of something that would help me very much in this
  matter."</p>

  <p>"What makes you think so?" he asked with an innocent air.</p>

  <p>"You betrayed it just now. It leaped out of your eyes."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure I don't know what you mean."</p>

  <p>"Barry, nothing can be altogether hidden. Your secret is known to a few
  people."</p>

  <p>"I have so many secrets!" he said with a silly-sounding laugh.</p>

  <p>"You were in love with her."</p>

  <p>"If you imply by that..." he began excitedly.</p>

  <p>"I imply nothing. From all accounts Mrs. Whittall must have been a
  saint."</p>

  <p>"She was," he said. "And of course I loved her. Everybody who knew her
  loved her. In our world she moved like a creature apart. She was really
  good."</p>

  <p>"Of course," said Mme. Storey. "But that is not what I mean."</p>

  <p>He remained obstinately silent.</p>

  <p>"Why did you call on her unexpectedly one afternoon last summer?" Mme.
  Storey asked bluntly.</p>

  <p>He stared at her in confusion. "Why...why for no special reason," he
  stammered.</p>

  <p>"On that afternoon," pursued my mistress relentlessly, "you told her that
  you loved her, and she confessed that it was returned."</p>

  <p>He suddenly gave up. "Rosika, you are superhuman!" he said simply. "I am
  in your hands...we all are!" He relaxed in his chair, and his chin sank on
  his breast. The guard had fallen from his eyes, and he looked old and
  heart-broken. Mme. Storey gave him his own time to speak.</p>

  <p>"You understand," he said at last, "my only object in trying to put you
  off was to protect her memory&mdash;not that it needed protection, but only
  from misrepresentation."</p>

  <p>"I understood that from the beginning," said my mistress.</p>

  <p>"It is true that I was in love with her," he went on. "Since many years
  ago. Almost from the time that Whittall first brought her home. We called her
  St. Cecilia. I watched her once cutting roses in her garden, when she didn't
  know anybody was near. At first it didn't hurt much. I had no aspirations.
  She was like a beautiful dream in my life, which redeemed it from triviality.
  I fed my dream with what glimpses of her came my way.</p>

  <p>"Later, all that was changed. It hurt then! Because I knew that she must
  be unhappy, and I longed to make her happy. I wanted her so! Up to the
  afternoon that you spoke of we had scarcely ever been alone together, and we
  had never exchanged any intimate speech. But before that, even in a crowd, I
  had been aware that she had a sympathy for me. In short, she loved me. You
  may well wonder at that&mdash;a man like me! But you see...she saw beneath
  the grinning mask I wear. She brought out the best in me, that I have hidden
  for so many years. Even then I had no thought of...I knew her too well!</p>

  <p>"And then on the day you speak of, a note was brought to me by special
  delivery from her. I had stored away scraps of her handwriting; invitations
  and so on, and I never doubted but that it was from her. Just four words:
  'Come to me quickly!' I flew. When I entered her sitting-room, she seemed
  surprised, but I thought that was just a woman's defence. I took her in my
  arms. She surrendered for a moment, just a little moment; then she thrust me
  away.</p>

  <p>"She denied having written to me. For a moment I did not believe
  her&mdash;I had already burned the note, so I could not show it to her;
  however, she made it abundantly clear she had not written it. Then we
  realised somebody must be trying to entrap us, and we were alarmed. But she
  said nobody could hurt us if we kept our heads up and walked straight. She
  sent me away. Yes, it was for good! for good! There was never any doubt about
  that. We were never to attempt to see each other alone; we were not to
  write&mdash;except in case of desperate need. It was I who exacted that. If
  the need was desperate, either of us might write to the other.</p>

  <p>"When I heard of her death&mdash;by her own hand as I thought...I felt
  betrayed; I felt if things had come to <i>that</i> pass she might have sent
  for me first...Oh, well, you are not interested in my state of mind! How
  gladly I would have put a pistol to my own head! I did not do so because I
  could not bear to sully her name by having it connected with mine. And so I
  kept on with the same old round, showing the same old grin! I dared not stop
  for fear of people saying: 'Oh, old Barry Govett is broken-hearted because
  of, well, you know!'...A pretty world, isn't it?" He finished with a harsh
  laugh.</p>

  <p>Nobody said anything for a while.</p>

  <p>Finally he raised his head. "But you have given me a renewed interest in
  life," he said grimly. "The same hand that forged that letter to me
  afterwards forged the letter that lured her out to the pavilion."</p>

  <p>"There can be no doubt of that," said Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"By God!" said Govett quietly. "If the law doesn't get him, <i>I
  will</i>!"</p>

  <p>"Slowly!" said Mme. Storey. "There is no proof yet."</p>

  <h3>V</h3>

  <p class="first">I see upon referring to my notes that this took place upon a
  Friday afternoon. Mr. Govett had not much more than left our place when Fay
  Brunton dropped in. She looked sweet enough to eat. To our relief she had
  left the inevitable mother behind on this occasion. Fay did not take tea, but
  dined at six in order to have a short rest before going to the theatre. She
  had just fifteen minutes before dinner, she said, and had rushed around to
  tell us&mdash;her news, after what we had just heard, was like a bombshell. I
  could scarcely repress a cry of dismay.</p>

  <p>"Darius and I have decided to get married on Sunday morning."</p>

  <p>My mistress never changed a muscle of her smile.</p>

  <p>"What!" she said with mock reproach, "must you abandon us so soon?"</p>

  <p>"I am not abandoning you!" said Fay, giving her a kiss. "It's the most
  wonderful plan!" she went on happily. "You know little Larrimore, my
  understudy, who is dying to have a chance at the part? Well, she is to have
  it. For a whole week! It's all been fixed up. It will be given out that I am
  indisposed. The fact of our marriage will be allowed to leak out later. And
  if Larrimore makes good she can keep the part. It's only that I don't want
  anybody to lose any money through me.</p>

  <p>"We are to be married on Sunday morning in the hotel. Strictly private, of
  course. And immediately afterwards we'll hop on a train for Pinehurst. Think
  of Pinehurst after weather like this! And what do you think? Darius has
  secured the loan of a private car from the president of the railway! I've
  never been in a private car; have you? And then a whole wonderful week in the
  woods!"</p>

  <p>"Wonderful!" cried Mme. Storey, and there was not a tinge of anything but
  sympathy in her voice. "But am I not to see you again? Tomorrow is Saturday,
  and you have two performances."</p>

  <p>"How about tonight after the show?" suggested Fay.</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey shook her head. "I have an engagement." (This was not true.)
  "How about tomorrow night after the show?" she went on. "I must have a chance
  to give you a little party before you step off into the gulf. Come here. My
  flat is too far up-town."</p>

  <p>Fay looked dubious. "I should love it," she said, "but Darius, you know.
  He hates parties."</p>

  <p>The expression in my mistress's eyes said: Damn Darius! But she laughed
  good-humouredly. "Oh, I don't mean a <i>party</i>, my dear. Just you and
  Darius and Mrs. Brunton; Bella and I."</p>

  <p>"I should love it," said Fay. "If Darius doesn't mind."</p>

  <p>"Why should Darius mind?" demanded my mistress. "Doesn't he like me?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes!" said Fay quickly. "He admires you ever so much!"</p>

  <p>"Then why should he mind?"</p>

  <p>The girl could not withstand the point-blank question. "Well, you see,"
  she faltered, "he thinks...that you do not like him very much...that you
  disapprove of him."</p>

  <p>"Fay," challenged my mistress, "have I ever by word or look given you any
  reason to suppose such a thing?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, Rosika! And so I have told him. Over and over...But he still
  thinks so."</p>

  <p>"Now, look here," said Mme. Storey. "I am never the one to interfere
  between a married pair&mdash;or a soon-to-be-married pair, but you must make
  a stand somewhere, my child, or you'll soon find yourself a loving little
  slave. I mean when you are in the right. Now this particular notion of
  Darius's is a silly notion, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Y-yes," said Fay.</p>

  <p>"Then you should not give in to it...But look here, I'll make it easier
  for you. Let's pretend that it's your party. You tell Darius that you have
  asked Bella and me to your hotel for supper after the show on your last
  night, and he could not possibly object, could he?"</p>

  <p>Fay's face lighted up. "Oh, no!" she cried. "That will be splendid!"</p>

  <p>"All right!" said Mme. Storey. "Expect us about quarter to twelve. You'll
  have it in your own rooms, of course, where we may be quite free."</p>

  <p>"Now I must run!" said Fay.</p>

  <p>"Oh, wait a minute!" pleaded Mme. Storey, slipping her arm through the
  girl's. "This is the last moment I shall see you alone! There are so many
  things I want to talk to you about!...And now you have driven them all out of
  my head...Is the little nest ready in the East Seventies?"</p>

  <p>"It will be when we get back from Pinehurst." Fay launched into an
  enthusiastic description.</p>

  <p>"And what happens to Oakhurst?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"Oh, didn't I tell you? Darius has put it into the hands of Merryman. It's
  to be sold, lock, stock and barrel."</p>

  <p>"And quite right, too...By the way, do you know what Darius's movements
  will be tomorrow? I must see him if I can, in order to remove this ridiculous
  wrong impression he has got of me."</p>

  <p>"You're so kind, Rosika! All I know is, he's going to sleep at his rooms
  in the Vandermeer tonight, in order to be on hand early for all the things he
  has to see to tomorrow."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll call him up at the Vandermeer."</p>

  <p>Arm in arm, they had been moving slowly out through my office with me at
  their heels. They had now reached the door. Mme. Storey kissed the girl
  fondly. My mistress was playing an elaborate game, but at least there was
  nothing insincere about <i>that</i> gesture.</p>

  <p>"One last thing," she said. "I want to make you a little gift of some
  sort..."</p>

  <p>Fay made a gesture of dissent.</p>

  <p>"When the news comes out you will be showered with all sorts of useless
  things. I should like to give you something that you <i>want</i>. What shall
  it be?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'd much rather leave it to you, dear."</p>

  <p>"Well, I must think of something original." She feigned to be considering
  deeply. "I have it!" she said. "I will give you a beautifully mounted gun
  with your name chased on the handle. Every woman ought to have a gun."</p>

  <p>"Oh, thank you!" said Fay. "But I have one! Darius says too that every
  woman ought to have a gun. He gave me one months ago."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, I remember," said Mme. Storey. "What sort of gun?"</p>

  <p>"A Matson 32, automatic."</p>

  <p>I shivered inwardly. Did the man buy them wholesale?</p>

  <p>"Do you carry it about with you?" asked Mme. Storey, laughing.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no," said Fay simply. "I keep it in my bottom drawer."</p>

  <p>"Ah, well, I'll have to think of something else then," said Mme.
  Storey.</p>

  <p>They embraced, and Fay went.</p>

  <p>The instant the door closed after her, Mme. Storey said to me: "Quick,
  Bella! Your hat!" She went to the window to wave her hand to Fay when she
  issued below. While standing there, she continued to speak rapidly to me.
  "Pick up a taxi, and go to Merryman's. That's the big real estate office on
  Madison Avenue near Forty-Fourth Street. If it's closed, you'll have to look
  up the address of one of the partners in the telephone book, and go to his
  house. Apologise for disturbing him and say that your employer (who wishes to
  remain unknown for the moment) has just learned that the Whittall property in
  Riverdale has come into the market. Ask for an order to view the place
  tomorrow. Explain that, owing to your employer's leaving for the West,
  tomorrow is the only day he will have for the purpose...Wait a minute! Fay is
  just getting into her car...Now she's off. Run along!"</p>

  <h3>VI</h3>

  <p class="first">Next morning we drove up to Riverdale in Mme. Storey's own
  limousine, but instead of her regular chauffeur, we had Crider at the wheel,
  an admirable fellow, quiet and keen; the chief of all our operatives. I
  pointed out to Mme. Storey that if anybody at the house was curious about us,
  it would be an easy matter to find out who we were by tracing the number of
  our licence.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter," she said. "By tonight it will all be decided one way
  or the other."</p>

  <p>Riverdale, as everybody knows, is not a "dale" at all, but a bold hill on
  the mainland, just to the North of Manhattan Island. On the one side it
  overlooks the Hudson River; on the other the flat expanse of the Bronx with
  Van Cortlandt Park. The original village may have started down by the river,
  but now the whole rocky height is thickly covered with handsome new villas
  standing in their limited plots. It is an exceedingly well-to-do community,
  but not fashionable. Fashion has fled farther from town. "Oakhurst," however,
  is a survival. It was built and laid out by the first Darius Whittall in the
  days when "a mansion on the Hudson" was synonymous with everything that was
  opulent and eminent.</p>

  <p>The grounds were of considerable extent. We drove in through beautiful
  wrought iron gates and past a lodge in the English style. The house was
  invisible from the road. We wound through a wood of evergreens and oaks
  before coming to it in the midst of its lawns. It was a long, irregular
  structure built of native stone. It had no particular architectural
  pretensions, but the years had mellowed it. It looked dignified and
  comfortable. This was the back of the house really; the principal rooms faced
  the glorious prospect over the Hudson with the Palisades beyond.</p>

  <p>We drove up under a <i>porte cochère</i>, and upon alighting, were
  received by an irreproachable butler. This must have been Frost. I showed him
  our order to view the place, and Mme. Storey expressed a wish to be shown the
  grounds first. Whereupon he handed us over to the second man, a sort of
  embryo butler; younger, fresh-faced; not yet able to subdue his curiosity and
  interest at the sight of a woman so beautiful as Madame Storey. He conducted
  us around the side of the house to the head gardener, who was directing the
  operations of several men engaged in setting out shrubs.</p>

  <p>So we began our perambulations. There was only one thing about the grounds
  that really interested us; i.e., the pavilion; but of course we said nothing
  about it, waiting until we should arrive there in proper order. In front of
  the house the ground fell away gradually in beautiful flower-beds and
  terraces, to the edge of a steep declivity which dropped to the river. The
  steep part was wooded in order to mask the railway tracks below. At this
  season it was all rather sere and leafless, except the grass, which was
  clipped and rolled to the semblance of green velvet. Stables, garage and
  other offices were all concealed behind shrubbery to the north of the
  house.</p>

  <p>We could see the pavilion off to the left as we faced the river; that is
  to say the southerly side. On this side the hill ran out in a little point
  ending in a knoll, and on the knoll was the pavilion, in the form of a little
  Greek temple with a flattened dome and a circle of Doric columns. The winding
  path which led to it was bordered with rhododendrons, backed with arbour
  vitæ. As we approached, I pictured the beautiful woman running down that path
  thinking she was going to the man she loved, and I seemed to hear the shot
  that ended everything for her. At the foot of the three steps one
  instinctively looked for bloodstains in the grey gravel; but, of course, all
  such marks had been erased long since.</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey said to the gardener: "I should like to sit down here for five
  minutes to look at the view. Will you come back?"</p>

  <p>The man bowed and hurried away to look after his subordinates.</p>

  <p>As we mounted the three steps Mme. Storey laid her hand against the first
  pillar to the right. "Here," she murmured, "the murderer waited concealed,
  gun in hand."</p>

  <p>I shivered.</p>

  <p>Inside, there was a circle of flat-topped marble benches. The view from
  that spot is world famous. One could see both up and down the glorious river
  for miles. Only within the last few years the foreground had been defaced by
  the cutting of new streets and the building of showy houses.</p>

  <p>"Our first job is to decide how the murderer got here," said Mme. Storey.
  "He must have familiarised himself with the spot beforehand."</p>

  <p>"But, of course, he knew the spot!" I said, in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Mustn't jump to conclusions, my Bella!" she said with a smile. "To go
  upon the assumption that we already know everything would only be to warp the
  judgment. All that we can say so far is, some person unknown to us stood
  behind that pillar and shot Mrs. Whittall."</p>

  <p>I thought she was over-scrupulous.</p>

  <p>As soon as we looked down to the left, the means of access was clear. The
  present boundary of the Whittall property was only about a hundred feet away
  on this side. It was marked by a rough stone wall, not very high; any
  determined person could have scrambled over it. On the other side of the wall
  a new street had been laid off down to the river. There were several new
  houses looking over the wall, and a boating club house down at the end. Once
  over the wall it was an easy climb through the dead leaves and thin
  undergrowth up to the pavilion.</p>

  <p>"If one followed that street back over the hill and down into the valley
  on the other side," said Mme. Storey, "it would bring one out somewhere in
  the vicinity of the subway terminal at Van Cortlandt Park. That is the way he
  came. You cannot trace anybody on the subway."</p>

  <p>She went on: "Now, what did Whittall do with his wife's revolver?"</p>

  <p>"A search?" I asked anxiously, thinking what a little time we had.</p>

  <p>"Oh, sit down," she said, suiting the action to the word. "And appear to
  be enjoying the view like me." She produced a cigarette, and lighted it. "Let
  us search in our heads first. Let us put it through a process of elimination.
  We have something to go on in this instance because we know our man."</p>

  <p>She presently went on: "During that minute when he was left alone with the
  body, he took the revolver out of the drawer and dropped it in his pocket.
  All during the time when the police were in the house it lay there in his
  pocket, burning him! As soon as he could, he left the house with his little
  flashlight as Mary has told us, and came this way. He was looking for the
  letter then. He was afraid that his wife might have carried it out in her
  hand, and dropped it when she fell. Not finding any letter he had to dispose
  of the gun. Well, there he was. He dared not stay out more than a few
  minutes. Put yourself in his place, Bella. What would he do with it?"</p>

  <p>I shook my head helplessly.</p>

  <p>"I think his first impulse would be to toss it from him as far as he
  could," Mme. Storey resumed. "But it was night, you see, and the risk would
  be too great that the morning light would reveal it. There are too many men
  working on this place! For the same reason he wouldn't dare hide it in the
  shrubbery. He would next think of burying it, but I don't suppose Whittall
  had ever dug a hole in his life. Besides, he would have to get a tool, which
  would take time, and anyway, where in this carefully manicured place
  <i>could</i> he have buried it without leaving tell-tale marks? Then there's
  the river, that's the ideal hiding-place. But it's too far away. It would
  take him twenty minutes to go and come, not counting the time he spent
  looking for the letter, and we have Mary's word for it that he was not out of
  the house more than ten...I think he would have risked the trip to the river,
  Bella, had he not known of water nearer to. For a guilty person with a heavy
  object to hide instinctively thinks of water!"</p>

  <p>We saw the gardener returning along the path.</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey smiled on him. "I have a horror of mosquitoes," she said to
  him as he came up, "and I want to ask you if there is any standing water on
  the place, or nearby. Any pond or pool or basin."</p>

  <p>"No, Madame," was the reply. "Nothing of that sort anywhere in the
  neighbourhood."</p>

  <p>"But are you <i>sure</i>?" she persisted sweetly. "They say that even a
  pan of water is enough if it's allowed to stand."</p>

  <p>"Well, there's an old well down at the foot of the front lawn," he said
  good-humouredly. "But I hardly think the insects could breed there, because
  it's twenty feet down to the water."</p>

  <p>"Still I'd like to look at it," said Mme. Storey. "If you wouldn't
  mind."</p>

  <p>"Certainly, Madame."</p>

  <p>He pointed out a path which led down to the right. As he led the way, he
  gave us the history of the old well. "The original house on this property
  stood on the edge of the steep bank, and this was the well belonging to it.
  When Mr. Whittall's grandfather pulled the old house down, he did not fill up
  the well, but built an ornamental well-house over it. But the late Mrs.
  Whittall thought it was incongruous, as it was, and she had it removed. Her
  idea was to bring over an antique well-curb from Italy, but for some reason
  this was never done, and so at present it just has a temporary cover over
  it."</p>

  <p>In a hundred yards or so we came to the spot. It was on the lowest level
  of the gardens and terraces in front of the house, One could picture the
  old-fashioned farmhouse which had once stood there. The magnificent elm which
  had shaded it had been allowed to remain. The brickwork of the well projected
  a few inches above the ground, and over it had been laid a heavy wooden cover
  with a trap in the middle, having a ring.</p>

  <p>"Will that open?" asked Mme. Storey, pointing.</p>

  <p>He got down on his knees to pull it up, looking bored at these vagaries of
  my mistress, but still respectful.</p>

  <p>"I want to look in it," she said.</p>

  <p>He made place for her, and she in turn got down on her knees to peer into
  the black hole.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she clasped her breast. "Oh, my pin!" she cried, "It fell in!"
  And got up with a face of tragedy.</p>

  <p>The old gardener scratched his head. I think he was a Scotsman. He looked
  utterly disgusted. Oh, the folly of these gentlefolk! his expression
  said.</p>

  <p>"It must be recovered!" my mistress said agitatedly. What an admirable
  actress she was! "It must be recovered! I value it above price!"</p>

  <p>"Well, ma'am, I suppose it can be got," the man said slowly. "There's not
  above three feet of water in the bottom. I have a block and tackle in the
  toolhouse. I will send one of the men down."</p>

  <p>"My chauffeur shall go down," said Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"No need of that, ma'am."</p>

  <p>"No, I insist! My chauffeur shall go down. If the others will help him I
  shall see that all are well rewarded for their trouble. And you, too!"</p>

  <p>"As you wish, Madame." He went off to summon help.</p>

  <p>With a slight smile, Mme. Storey pressed an emerald barpin that she had
  unfastened from somewhere or other into my hand, and sent me for Crider. I
  found him still sitting like a wooden image at the wheel of the car. I gave
  him the emerald, which he pinned inside his clothes, and whispered his
  instructions. His eyes gleamed. We returned to the old well.</p>

  <p>The under-gardeners had gathered to help, and the old man was dragging
  block and tackle towards the spot.</p>

  <p>"This will take some time, I suppose," said Mme. Storey when he came up.
  "We had better be looking over the house while we wait."</p>

  <p>So we went back up the slope.</p>

  <p>We had no particular interest in the interior of the house, but we went
  over everything dutifully under the guidance of the butler. It was one of the
  most attractive houses I ever was in. If I had never heard anything else
  about the mistress of it I would have known by the inside of her house that
  she was a superior woman. It had nothing of the awful perfection usual to the
  houses of the very rich; nothing of the museum look. It was full of
  character. There were no "period" rooms.</p>

  <p>In order to give Crider plenty of time we made our tour last as long as
  possible, but we had returned to the main floor before any word came from
  him. There was a central hall which was furnished with comfortable chairs.
  Mme. Storey said to the butler:</p>

  <p>"If we may, we will wait here a little while. It is so cold outside."</p>

  <p>"Certainly, Madame," he said, and withdrew. We had a feeling, though, that
  he was lingering somewhere close by. Well, after all, we were strangers in
  the house.</p>

  <p>In a few minutes we heard a car approach swiftly through the crunching
  gravel, and come to a stop with a grinding of brakes. Mme. Storey and I
  looked at each other significantly. She shrugged. We heard the car door slam
  outside, feet came running up the steps, and the front door was flung open.
  There stood the master of the house. The light was behind him, and I could
  not read his expression.</p>

  <p>The thought instantly flew into my head that the butler, recognising Mme.
  Storey, or perhaps suspecting us on general principles, had telephoned to
  him. He had had just about time enough to drive up from town.</p>

  <h3>VII</h3>

  <p class="first">"What! Mme. Storey!" Whittall cried very affably. "What a
  surprise! I had no idea that you were interested in my property. Why didn't
  you let me know?"</p>

  <p>She ignored the question. "It is beautiful!" she said blandly, "but I am
  afraid it is too expensive for me."</p>

  <p>They shook hands. I could see his face now. He had it under pretty good
  control, but his eyes were narrow and sharp with curiosity. He was a handsome
  man in his way, with dark, bright eyes in which there was something both
  defiant and shifty. It was the look of a schoolboy who knows he has a bad
  name, and is determined to brazen it out. Why had not Fay Brunton's instincts
  taken alarm? I wondered. But perhaps Whittall only had that look when he
  faced my mistress.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's too expensive for anybody to own as a residence now," he said
  with a laugh. "I supposed it would be bought by a real estate operator, and
  subdivided...Have you seen everything?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, thank you," said Mme. Storey. "We were just waiting for a few
  minutes. I had the misfortune to lose a piece of jewellery in the grounds,
  and they are looking for it."</p>

  <p>"Ah, I am so sorry!" While he smiled in polite sympathy, his sharp eyes
  sought to bore into her, but my mistress's face presented a surface as smooth
  as tinted china.</p>

  <p>"We might as well go and see what they are about," she said, moving
  towards the door.</p>

  <p>"Don't hurry away!" he begged. "I don't often have the chance of
  entertaining you."</p>

  <p>However, at this moment the butler appeared, to announce that Madame's pin
  had been found, and we all moved out to the front steps. Crider was there,
  and the head gardener. Crider passed over the emerald, and with a meaning
  look gave his mistress to understand that he had been successful in his other
  quest. A great relief filled me. Whittall had not come home in time to
  frustrate us. Mme. Storey was loud in her protestations of thankfulness. She
  opened her purse to reward the gardener and his men.</p>

  <p>"Where was it found?" asked Whittall.</p>

  <p>The gardener spoke up. "At the bottom of the old well, sir."</p>

  <p>It must have given Whittall a hideous shock. I scarcely had the heart to
  look at him. He uttered no sound; his eyes were divested of all sense. His
  florid face went greyish, leaving a network of tiny, purplish veins outlined
  against the greyness. Several times he essayed to speak before any sound came
  out.</p>

  <p>"Come inside a minute," he gabbled. "Come inside...come inside!"</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey looked at Crider, and he followed us inside. My mistress had
  no notion of trusting herself alone with that madman. Whittall led the way
  across the hall, walking with such quick short steps as to give almost a
  comic effect. He opened the door of the library for us to pass in. He was for
  shutting it in Crider's face, but Mme. Storey stopped him with a steady look.
  So Crider entered and waited with his back against the door. It was a
  beautiful, quiet room upholstered in maroon, with three tall windows reaching
  to the floor.</p>

  <p>Whittall was in a pitiably unnerved state. Consider the height that he had
  fallen from. On the eve of his marriage, too. He drew a bottle from a
  cabinet, and poured himself a drink with shaking hands. Gulped it down at a
  draught. He went to the windows and jerked at the curtain cords senselessly,
  though they were already opened to their widest. Again, one was reminded of
  something comic in his attempt to make out that there was nothing the matter.
  Finally he asked in a thick voice:</p>

  <p>"Am I to have any explanation of this extraordinary visit?"</p>

  <p>"I would not insist on it, Whittall," said my mistress, almost
  regretfully, one would have said.</p>

  <p>"I do insist on it," he said quickly.</p>

  <p>"Very well. It was not an emerald pin, of course, that I was looking for
  at the bottom of the well."</p>

  <p>"What was it then?"</p>

  <p>She turned to the door. "What did you find there, Crider?"</p>

  <p>"A Matson 32 automatic, Madame. The magazine is full."</p>

  <p>"Hand it over!" said Whittall.</p>

  <p>Crider, naturally, made no move to obey.</p>

  <p>"This is mere folly," said my mistress calmly; "it is to be handed over to
  an authority higher than yours."</p>

  <p>"Of what do you accuse me?" he cried wildly.</p>

  <p>"Of nothing yet, except throwing this gun down the well."</p>

  <p>"It's a lie! It's a lie! I never saw it before!"</p>

  <p>"Then why all this excitement?"</p>

  <p>He turned away biting his fingers.</p>

  <p>"This is worse than useless," said Mme. Storey. "Open the door,
  Crider."</p>

  <p>Whittall instantly became abject and cringing. "Wait a minute!" he
  implored. "Give me a chance to explain. Oh, my God! this frightful unexpected
  accusation has driven me out of my senses. Give me a chance to recover
  myself. Don't you see what you are doing? You are ruining me beyond hope. And
  all for nothing! All for nothing! I am as innocent as a child!"</p>

  <p>I am afraid we all smiled grimly at this last cry of his. However, Mme.
  Storey waited.</p>

  <p>"Give me a little time!" he muttered. He took another drink. He then said
  in a stronger voice: "Send those people out of the room, and I'll tell you
  all."</p>

  <p>"These two are my trusted employees," said Mme. Storey. "We three are as
  one. You may explain or not, just as it suits you."</p>

  <p>After a moment's hesitation he said: "I will explain on one condition,
  that, if my explanation is a reasonable one, you promise you will not proceed
  against me immediately. But if you are determined to proceed against me
  anyhow, what's the use of my telling you anything. You can go ahead and be
  damned to you."</p>

  <p>This was too much for Crider. "I'll trouble you to be civil to Madame
  Storey," he said, flushing.</p>

  <p>My mistress silenced him with a gesture. To Whittall she said coolly: "I
  am not prepared to proceed against you yet. As to the future I make no
  promises. Are you willing on your part to give me your word of honour that
  you will not marry until this matter is cleared up?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly!" he said quickly. "Word of honour...But, don't tell Fay yet.
  It would break her heart."</p>

  <p>"I have no intention of doing so, yet," said Mme. Storey dryly.</p>

  <p>There was a considerable silence.</p>

  <p>"We are waiting for the explanation," said Mme. Storey at length.</p>

  <p>Whittall turned around. He had evidently decided on his course. "It is
  true that that is my wife's gun," he said without hesitation, "and that I
  threw it down the well. But I swear as God is in His Heaven that I did not
  shoot her. The reason I acted as I did was to prevent a scandal. I
  immediately suspected that she had been murdered. Well, a dirty scandal would
  not have given her back to me; it would only have besmirched her reputation
  still further."</p>

  <p>"I know all about the 'other man,'" said Mme. Storey coolly. "I have
  talked with him. If you are suggesting that he shot her, I answer that it is
  impossible that he could have done so."</p>

  <p>Whittall's face was a study while she was saying this. Finally he
  shrugged. "In that case," he said sullenly, "I know no more than the next man
  who did it."</p>

  <p>"What gave you reason to suspect that it was murder?" asked Mme.
  Storey.</p>

  <p>"Oh, the general circumstances."</p>

  <p>"Nobody else suspected such a thing."</p>

  <p>He shrugged indifferently.</p>

  <p>Nothing more seemed to be forthcoming, and presently Mme. Storey said:
  "Your explanation so far is no explanation."</p>

  <p>He turned away, visibly in a state of indecision. Then he flung around
  again. "Oh, hell! I suppose it's all got to come out now!" he cried. "I was
  warned of her murder!"</p>

  <p>"Beforehand?" Mme. Storey asked sternly.</p>

  <p>"No. What do you think I am?...Shortly after it was committed. That is why
  I came home so early...I was dining with a friend. I was called to the
  telephone. A voice, unknown to me, said without any preliminary explanation:
  'Your wife has just been shot. If you want to avoid a nasty scandal, you had
  better hurry home and dispose of her revolver, so that it will look like a
  suicide.'"</p>

  <p>I could not help smiling at this tale. It sounded so preposterous. Mme.
  Storey, however, was grave enough.</p>

  <p>"A man's voice or a woman's voice?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"A man's."</p>

  <p>"Can you offer corroboration of this?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly."</p>

  <p>"Where were you dining, and with whom?"</p>

  <p>"What right have <i>you</i> to cross-examine me?" he said, scowling.</p>

  <p>"Oh, if you'd rather tell the district attorney..." said Mme. Storey
  calmly.</p>

  <p>"I was with Max Kreuger, the manager of Miss Brunton's company," he said
  sullenly. "We were at the Norfolk. It is not a hotel that I frequent, but we
  had some private business to discuss, and I didn't want to be
  recognised."</p>

  <p>"Yet the person who called you up knew where to find you?"</p>

  <p>He flung out his hands violently. "You'll have to figure that out as best
  you can! It beats me!"</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey took a thoughtful turn up and down.</p>

  <p>Whittall went on: "It has been established by a dozen witnesses that the
  fatal shot was fired at nine-thirty. Kreuger will testify that at that hour I
  was dining with him in the Norfolk&mdash;ten miles away from here. So your
  case against me collapses. Kreuger will tell you further that about ten
  minutes past ten I was called to the 'phone. Naturally I did not tell him the
  nature of the message I received. But he'll tell you that I left immediately.
  Before eleven I was back here. I suppose the taxicab driver who brought me
  here can be found too, if he is looked for...Kreuger is in his office now.
  Come with me and question him, and let this ridiculous charge be laid once
  and for all."</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey agreed to the proposal. Again she pointed out to Whittall that
  she had not yet made any charge.</p>

  <p>There was a brief discussion as to how we should dispose ourselves for the
  drive to town. Naturally we did not intend to let Whittall out of our sight.
  I thought we all ought to go in Mme. Storey's car, but she ruled otherwise.
  She and I and Whittall would ride in his car, she said, and Crider could
  bring her car along after.</p>

  <p>While Whittall waited for us in his car, biting his fingers with
  impatience, Mme. Storey gave Crider his private instructions: "Do not follow
  us, but drive to your own place as quickly as possible, and change. Telephone
  Younger to come and get the car. You had also better get in touch with
  Stephens. Get back to the Adelphi theatre as soon as you can. Whittall will
  be there in Max Kreuger's office. You and Stephens between you are to keep
  Whittall under observation until further notice, reporting to me at my office
  by 'phone as often as you are able."</p>

  <p>That was hardly a cheerful drive. Mme. Storey and Whittall sat side by
  side on the back seat without exchanging a single word the whole way.
  Whittall crouched in his corner, scowling and biting his fingers. If Fay
  could have watched him then, that in itself ought to have given her pause.
  Whittall had a skilful chauffeur, of course. He had a special instinct to
  warn him of a traffic policeman. When the road was clear he opened his
  throttle to its widest, and we sped like a bullet. Then at certain moments he
  abruptly slowed down, and sure enough, presently the brass buttons would
  appear. We made Times Square in twenty-five minutes.</p>

  <p>The Adelphi was one of the newer theatres in that neighbourhood. Its name
  has been changed now. At this time Whittall was reputed to be the owner, but
  I do not know if this was so. It was perfectly clear though that Max Kreuger
  was Whittall's creature. <i>Wild Hyacinth</i>, I should say, was not showing
  at the Adelphi, but at the Yorktown, farther down Broadway, which had a
  greater seating capacity.</p>

  <p>A deceitful air of activity pervaded the offices. Apart from rehearsals,
  theatrical business seems to consist of lengthy conversations which end
  exactly where they begin. There were a number of depressed-looking actors of
  both sexes sitting around the outer office waiting for an interview with the
  manager. Yet Kreuger as we presently discovered was alone in his office, with
  his heels cocked up on his desk. Whittall marched straight into the private
  office with us at his heels. Snatching the cigar from his lips, Kreuger
  leaped to his feet. He was a rosy, plump little man of the type that I have
  heard described as a fore-and-aft Jew; a blond. He looked astonished, as well
  he might, at the combination which faced him.</p>

  <p>Without the slightest preamble, Whittall cried out with a wave of his
  hand: "There he is. Ask him what you want." And went to the window where he
  turned his back to us.</p>

  <p>Kreuger, greatly flustered, began to pull chairs out, and to mumble
  courtesies.</p>

  <p>"Never mind, thanks," said Mme. Storey. "We won't sit down. Just answer a
  few questions, please. It is by Mr. Whittall's wish that we have come."</p>

  <p>"Anything, Madame Storey, anything within my power!" the little man
  murmured fulsomely.</p>

  <p>"What were you doing on the evening of Sunday, September 11th?"</p>

  <p>Kreuger was horridly taken aback. He stared at us in a witless fashion and
  pulled at his slack lower lip. His distracted eyes sought his master for
  guidance, but received none, Whittall's back being turned.</p>

  <p>"Well, speak up, can't you?" barked Whittall, without turning around.</p>

  <p>"Yes...yes...of course," stammered Kreuger, sparring for time. "Let me
  see...September 11th...I can't seem to remember offhand. I shall have to look
  it up."</p>

  <p>"That was the night of Mrs. Whittall's death," Mme. Storey reminded
  him.</p>

  <p>"Oh, to be sure! that dreadful night!" said Kreuger in suitable tones of
  horror. "That was the night of the private showing of the super-film 'Ashes
  of Roses.' I looked in at that."</p>

  <p>This was certainly not the answer that Whittall looked for. He whirled
  around with a face of terror. I rejoiced that we had caught the villains
  napping, as it seemed. Something had gone wrong with their concerted
  story.</p>

  <p>"Tell the truth!" gasped Whittall.</p>

  <p>"Eh?...What?" stammered Kreuger, blinking.</p>

  <p>"Tell the truth, I said!" cried Whittall in a fury, banging the desk.</p>

  <p>"Oh, to be sure! To be sure!" stuttered the demoralised Kreuger. "Mr.
  Whittall and I had dinner together that night. At the Hotel Norfolk."</p>

  <p>I smiled to myself. This came a little late, I thought. It sounded as if
  it had been got by heart.</p>

  <p>"Why did you not say so at once?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"Well, it was a private meeting, Madame. We had business to discuss. I
  didn't think that Mr. Whittall wanted it known."</p>

  <p>"At what time did you meet?"</p>

  <p>"Half-past seven."</p>

  <p>"Describe what happened."</p>

  <p>"Well, we had our dinner. Afterwards we went out to the smoking lounge.
  Shortly after ten, a boy came through paging Mr. Darius Whittall. Mr.
  Whittall was surprised, because he had not thought that anybody knew where he
  was. Everybody in the room looked up, hearing <i>that</i> name. At first Mr.
  Whittall wasn't going to identify himself. Just some trifler, he said, or a
  newspaper reporter. But he was curious to find out who had got hold of his
  name. So after the boy had gone on, he went out to the office. In a minute or
  two he came back. He looked very agitated. All he said was: 'Something wrong
  at home.' He got his hat and coat, and jumped in a taxicab."</p>

  <p>"Now are you satisfied that I didn't do it?" cried Whittall.</p>

  <p>"Quite!" said Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>I was surprised at this answer. Still I supposed she had her own reasons
  for making it.</p>

  <p>She asked them both a number of further questions, which they answered
  readily. Whittall rapidly quieted down. It had the effect of a genuine
  cross-examination, but knowing my mistress so well, I could see that she was
  only stalling for time. She did not want Whittall to get away from there
  until Crider was waiting outside to pick him up. Nothing of moment to the
  case was brought out by their answers.</p>

  <p>Finally we went. The street outside was crowded, and I could not pick out
  Crider anywhere, but I had no doubt he was safely at his post. Just the same
  I felt that we were doing wrong to go away and leave Whittall like that, free
  to work his own nefarious schemes. And as we drove away in a taxicab I voiced
  something to that effect.</p>

  <p>"But we have no reason to order him detained," said Mme. Storey calmly.
  "He didn't shoot his wife."</p>

  <p>"What!" I cried, astonished. "You still doubt that!"</p>

  <p>"No," said Mme. Storey, smiling at the heat I betrayed. "I'm sure he
  didn't."</p>

  <p>"But obviously that man Kreuger was ready to swear to anything that would
  please him!"</p>

  <p>"Obviously!" she agreed.</p>

  <p>"And the story about the telephone call&mdash;fancy anybody calling him up
  and saying: 'Your wife has been shot.' Just like that. Why, it's
  preposterous!"</p>

  <p>"Quite!" said Mme. Storey. "Whittall is far too clever a man to have
  offered me so preposterous a story if it were not true. There is nothing so
  preposterous as the truth sometimes."</p>

  <p>"Well, if he didn't do it himself he certainly had it done," I said
  excitedly. "And that telephone message was from his hireling telling him that
  the job was accomplished."</p>

  <p>But Mme. Storey still shook her head.</p>

  <p>"What makes you so sure Whittall wasn't responsible?" I asked
  helplessly.</p>

  <p>"It's so simple," she said. "If Whittall had plotted to shoot his wife, he
  would have shot her with her own gun, wouldn't he? And then we never would
  have known."</p>

  <p>I looked at her in silence. Why, of course! My theory went down like a
  house of cards.</p>

  <p>"No," she went on gravely, "here's the best part of the day gone, and
  we're almost where we were yesterday evening...Well, not quite. Because
  Whittall told one little lie, which will appear later."</p>

  <p>"Then are we up against a blank wall?" I asked, discouraged.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no," was her surprising answer. "I know who did it."</p>

  <p>I looked my breathless question.</p>

  <p>But she only shook her head. "No evidence," she said, frowning. "Not a
  shred! It's almost the perfect crime, my Bella!"</p>

  <h3>VIII</h3>

  <p class="first">Mme. Storey and I returned to the office. We found her car
  waiting out in front for orders. The chauffeur, Younger, handed over the gun
  fished from the well at Oakhurst, which Crider had given him for safe
  keeping. Mme. Storey, in my presence, marked the gun for subsequent
  identification. We found a number of matters awaiting our attention, which we
  got out of the way as quickly as possible. Meanwhile, we ordered in a light
  lunch of sandwiches and milk.</p>

  <p>While she munched her sandwiches, Mme. Storey paced slowly up and down the
  long room, considering deeply. With the last bite she evidently finished
  mapping out her course of action. Her first move was to call up Fay Brunton
  in her dressing-room at the theatre. They had an aimless friendly talk, which
  was, however, not so aimless on my mistress's part as might have been
  supposed, for she found out: (a) that Fay had not seen nor heard from Darius
  Whittall since we had left him: (b) that she was still looking forward to the
  supper party in her rooms that night. I also marked this bit:</p>

  <p>"I saw the new film 'Ashes of Roses' last night," said Mme. Storey. (I
  knew this was not true.) "Have you seen it?" Fay's answer ran to some length.
  It was evidently in the negative, for Mme. Storey said: "Well, you ought to.
  It's really quite tremendous." The talk then passed to other matters.</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey then called up Inspector Rumsey at Headquarters. She asked him
  if he had succeeded in tracing Whittall's purchase of the guns. He replied
  that he had full information. She then got him to tell her what his movements
  would be that afternoon and night, so that we could get in touch with him any
  time we might need him.</p>

  <p>Crider called us up to report that Darius Whittall had called upon the
  President of the &mdash;&mdash; Railroad. Crider was not able to say, of
  course, what was the occasion of the visit. Upon hearing this Mme. Storey
  instructed Crider to send Stephens to the &mdash;&mdash; Terminal to find out
  as best he could what order had been received respecting the President's
  private car.</p>

  <p>I must try to set down in order all that we did that afternoon. The
  significance of much of it did not become clear to me until night. First; an
  operative was despatched to the garage run in connection with the Hotel
  Madagascar (where Fay lived) with instructions to learn what he could about
  the movements of Miss Brunton's cars on the night of September 11th. Fay kept
  two cars; a brougham which was driven by a chauffeur and a smart little
  convertible that she drove herself. It appeared that in this very up-to-date
  garage a complete record was kept of the movements of all the cars stored
  there. Every time they went out their mileage was taken, and again when they
  came in. This was to prevent their use for unauthorised purposes.</p>

  <p>Second; an operative (this one a woman) was sent to interview Miss
  Beatrice Dufaye, the well-known cinema star, in the guise of a representative
  of some mythical magazine. Miss Dufaye was the star of "Ashes of Roses," a
  picture which was the sensation of the moment, and at present she was resting
  at her country place at Glen Cove before starting work on her next picture.
  Among other things, this operative was instructed to ask certain questions
  relative to the private showing of "Ashes of Roses" on September 11th. This
  had been made a great social occasion in theatrical circles.</p>

  <p>A third operative was instructed to learn the present whereabouts of Mr.
  Frank Esher. Esher, you will remember, was the young man who was deeply in
  love with Fay Brunton, and for whom we suspected she had a tenderness in
  return. After a quarrel or a series of quarrels, he had flown off to parts
  unknown. This operative was furnished with the address of his last employers,
  his club, and his last home address.</p>

  <p>Finally I received my assignment. "Bella," said my mistress, "I want you
  to go to Tiffany's with me, to help choose Fay's wedding present."</p>

  <p>It struck me as very strange that we should spend our time this way when
  matters were at such a critical juncture; and especially as we were
  determined to prevent this wedding if we could. However, I said nothing. We
  used up a good hour choosing the most beautiful amongst all the tiny platinum
  and jewelled watches they showed us.</p>

  <p>"Take it to the hotel," said Mme. Storey, "and give it to her maid to keep
  until Fay returns from the theatre. You may let the maid have a peep at it as
  a great favour. This ought to put you on an intimate footing at once. You
  will no doubt find her packing her mistress's things for the journey
  tomorrow. It will seem quite natural for you to show curiosity in Fay's
  pretty things. Take plenty of time. Fay cannot get home until nearly six if
  she comes at all. Ordinarily, on matinée days, she has dinner in her
  dressing-room. I want you to find out what Fay was doing on the night of
  September 11th."</p>

  <p>"What Fay was doing?" I echoed, greatly disquieted.</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey looked at me in a way which did not allay my uneasiness. "Have
  patience, Bella. I cannot yet foresee how all this is going to turn out."</p>

  <p>She drove off up to Riverdale again with the object of recovering the gun
  which Whittall had presented to the Captain of the precinct. It was from this
  gun that the fatal shot had been fired.</p>

  <p>I proceeded to the Madagascar, that towering palace of luxury. Fay, like
  most women in her position, had two maids, one of whom waited upon her in the
  hotel, and one at the theatre. I was already slightly acquainted with Katy
  Meadows, her hotel maid, and of course the nature of my errand immediately
  broke the ice between us. Katy was a pretty, vivacious Irish girl with
  naturally rosy cheeks. Fay spoiled her. Katy looked on me as a sort of
  superior servant like herself, and was quite free with me. She went into
  raptures over the watch.</p>

  <p>Just as Mme. Storey had said, I found her packing. Fay's things were
  spread over the whole suite. I did not have to express any curiosity, for
  Katy insisted on showing me everything; hats, wraps, dresses, lingerie, shoes
  in endless profusion. It was immoral that one woman should possess so much,
  but oh! what a fascinating display! Unfortunately, I had something else on my
  mind, and was unable to give myself up to the contemplation of it. The suite
  consisted of three rooms; a corner sitting-room with Fay's bedroom on one
  side and Mrs. Brunton's on the other.</p>

  <p>After we had finished rhapsodising over the watch I lingered on. Katy was
  bustling from room to room bearing armfuls of Fay's things that had to be
  packed. She was in a great state of fluster.</p>

  <p>"Four o'clock!" she cried. "Mercy! I must get a move on me! They're going
  to have a supper party here after the show, and everything must be out of
  here before that, and the place tidied up...But don't you go, Miss Brickley.
  Sit down and talk to me. It keeps me going..."</p>

  <p>In the end it was not at all difficult to get what I wanted. I led up to
  the matter as I had heard Mme. Storey do over the 'phone.</p>

  <p>"I went to see 'Ashes of Roses' last night. It's a dandy picture. Have you
  seen it?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Katy. "I must wait until it shows in the cheaper houses."</p>

  <p>"That was a great party they had the night of the private showing last
  September," I went on. "I suppose your folks went. They say all the famous
  people on Broadway were there."</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Brunton went," said Katy unsuspiciously, "but at the last moment
  Miss Fay wouldn't go. Said she didn't feel good."</p>

  <p>"I thought she was never sick," I ventured.</p>

  <p>"Oh, not sick," said Katy. "Just wanted to stay quiet and read. I left her
  in bed reading. I remember that's the night I saw A. J. Burchell, in
  'Well-Dressed Wives.' Don't you love him?"</p>

  <p>So much for that.</p>

  <p>While I was in the suite, things were still arriving from the shops. I
  remember I was looking at a marvellous négligée when the telephone rang. From
  Katy's responses I understood that it was Fay calling from the theatre. Fay
  was evidently issuing somewhat complicated instructions, to which Katy
  returned breathless affirmatives.</p>

  <p>Katy finally hung up, and turned around with wide eyes. "What do you
  think!" she cried. "They've changed all their plans. They're going away this
  evening instead of tomorrow morning!"</p>

  <p>I thought that was the end of everything. Mme. Storey had gone up to
  Riverdale, and I didn't know when she'd get back. Luckily Katy was too much
  excited herself to notice the effect that her announcement had on me.</p>

  <p>"For the Lord's sake," she cried. "You never know what they're going to do
  next!...I'm to pack the dressing-case and the small wardrobe trunk, and leave
  everything else to Maud. I'm to take the things to the &mdash;&mdash;
  Terminal&mdash;my own things too, and meet them in the Grand Concourse at
  six-thirty!"</p>

  <p>There was only one thing for me to do, and that was to get out as quick as
  I could. Which I did. What was I to do? I felt desperate. If I tried to go
  after Mme. Storey, likely I would only pass her somewhere coming back. I
  didn't dare call up the police station at Riverdale, because I didn't know if
  she would give her right name there, and if I mentioned it, I might upset all
  her plans. There was nothing for it but to return to the office and wait for
  her. At the worst, I was prepared to go myself to the Terminal, and denounce
  Whittall in public, though I died for it.</p>

  <p>To my great relief that was not required of me. At the end of an hour,
  Mme. Storey came into the office bringing a very pretty young lady whom I had
  not seen before. She introduced her as Miss Larrimore. I was too excited at
  the moment to remember that this was the name of Fay's understudy.</p>

  <p>"Miss Larrimore wanted to see our offices," Mme. Storey explained
  amiably.</p>

  <p>Perceiving from my face that something had happened, Mme. Storey allowed
  the girl to pass on into the long room, while she lingered in my office. I
  hurriedly made my communication. Mme. Storey was not in the least disturbed.
  Indeed, she laughed merrily.</p>

  <p>"I fancied that some such move might be made," she said. "So I kidnapped
  Fay's understudy. I expect they're looking for her now."</p>

  <p>"But...but where did you find her?" I asked, amazed.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I knew that after reporting at the theatre for every performance, she
  was free to go home if Fay had turned up in good health. So I went to her
  boarding-house, and asked her to go for a drive. We'll take her back
  directly. It will be fun!"</p>

  <p>From her handbag Mme. Storey took an automatic pistol, and put a mark on
  it in my presence, before dropping it in the drawer of my desk. This weapon
  was identical with the one which had been recovered from the well at Oakhurst
  that morning.</p>

  <p>My mistress did not hurry herself at all. After showing Miss Larrimore her
  artistic treasures she announced that she would drive her up-town. "I'm going
  to drop in on Fay at the theatre," said Mme. Storey. "You come along
  too."</p>

  <p>It was not the first time that Mme. Storey and I had applied at the stage
  door of the Yorktown theatre, and we were admitted without question. The star
  of the company was allotted two rooms on the level of the stage; the outer
  was used to receive her friends in, while the inner was devoted to the
  mysteries of make-up and dress. When the outer door was opened we heard the
  voices of several people within. Mme. Storey slyly bade Miss Larrimore to
  enter first, while she hung back with a smile. Cries of relief greeted the
  understudy.</p>

  <p>"Oh, here you are!"</p>

  <p>Then Mme. Storey entered with me at her heels. They were all there;
  Whittall, Kreuger, Mrs. Brunton and Fay. My mistress's appearance created a
  startling effect. Whittall was arrested in full flight, so to speak. The man
  froze where he stood. His face turned livid. Kreuger was frankly terrified;
  while Mrs. Brunton was herself, for once. She snarled. She could not have
  known what had taken place that day, but she saw clearly enough that her
  darling scheme was endangered. Fay swam towards us, perfectly candid in her
  gladness. Whittall made an involuntary move to stop her&mdash;then he saw it
  was useless.</p>

  <p>"Rosika and Bella!" cried Fay. "What a lucky chance! I was just about to
  write you. Darius said it would sound too casual to telephone. I am afraid
  our little party for tonight must be off, my dears. But Darius says we shall
  have a big one as soon as we get back. Our plans are all changed. It turns
  out that the private car is required in New York on Tuesday, and we have to
  use it tonight or not at all. I suppose I am silly, but my heart was set on
  that private car. So we're off at seven o'clock. Miss Larrimore will play my
  part tonight. We'll be married in Pinehurst tomorrow."</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey looked at Whittall with a cold smile. He visibly writhed under
  it. He had given her his word of honour, you remember. The tension of that
  moment was almost unbearable. Everybody in the room was aware of it except
  the two girls who were laughingly whispering about the night's performance.
  There was something inexpressibly touching in the sight of their happy
  ignorance.</p>

  <p>Finally Mme. Storey spoke. "I'm afraid I've got the thankless job of
  throwing a monkey-wrench into the works," she said.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" asked Fay, laughing.</p>

  <p>"I can't let Mr. Whittall go away tonight."</p>

  <p>One can imagine what a hell of rage and frustration Whittall was
  undergoing during those moments. I don't suppose that the arrogant
  millionaire's will had ever been crossed before.</p>

  <p>"What!" said Fay, opening her eyes wide.</p>

  <p>"Some time ago," said Mme. Storey coolly, "Mr. Whittall promised to back
  me in a scheme I was getting up to open a studio building for poor artists.
  My plans are ripe now, and I have called a meeting for tomorrow. I am
  counting on him."</p>

  <p>"Oh, but surely," said Fay, more and more surprised, "under the
  circumstances, can't somebody appear for him? can't it be put off for a few
  days?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Mme. Storey with cold firmness.</p>

  <p>From astonishment Fay graduated to indignation. Suspecting enmity in my
  mistress, she turned from her. "Darius!" she said.</p>

  <p>What a bitter moment for him! He hesitated. His eyes glittered in the
  direction of my mistress with an expression of reckless rage. But upon
  meeting her cold glance they fell again. He knew that the word "murder" had
  only to be whispered to destroy his chances for ever. "I gave her my word,"
  he mumbled, grinding his teeth. "I've got to stick to it."</p>

  <p>Fay's gentle eyes flashed. She could see now that there was much more in
  this than appeared on the surface. But pride would not allow her to ask any
  more questions. She was much angrier at her renegade lover than she was at
  Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"Oh, well, of course it doesn't make any difference," she said, tossing
  her head. She slipped her hand under Miss Larrimore's arm. "I'm only sorry on
  your account, my dear." She drew the other girl into the inner room.</p>

  <h3>IX</h3>

  <p class="first">The events which succeeded this scene were simply baffling
  to me. Katy was ordered back from the station to the hotel, and told to
  unpack all her mistress's things and put them away. The private car was
  cancelled. At this, Mrs. Brunton could no longer contain her feelings. She
  burst out at Mme. Storey wildly.</p>

  <p>"How dare you come here interfering in our private affairs! What does your
  silly meeting mean to us when Darius and Fay are going to be married! I never
  heard of such a thing..."</p>

  <p>The outburst was quite natural. Mrs. Brunton had had a hard life, and
  Whittall's twenty millions blinded her to all other considerations. There is
  no doubt but she loved Fay as if she had been her own child.</p>

  <p>Now Whittall, when he heard this, executed a rapid <i>volte-face</i>. A
  moment before he had seemed absolutely suffocated with rage against Mme.
  Storey; now he turned against Mrs. Brunton, and roughly silenced her. "Mme.
  Storey is our friend," he said. "You have no reason to speak to her in that
  manner. This is important. She knows what she is doing."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Brunton didn't know what to make of it, and no more did I. To my
  further astonishment, Mme. Storey allowed a reconciliation to be patched up,
  and when I left she and Whittall were chatting together as amicably as you
  please. Since Fay was to go on as usual, her supper had been ordered in. I
  can't tell you what happened after that, because I had been sent to the
  office with private instructions to receive the reports of the various
  operatives who had been detailed on the case, and forward them to Mme. Storey
  at the theatre. I supposed that she and Whittall remained at the theatre
  throughout the performance, exchanging compliments&mdash;and watching each
  other.</p>

  <p>During the evening Mme. Storey called me up to say that the little party
  would take place in Fay's rooms after the performance as at first arranged,
  and that I was to be there. She instructed me to get in touch with Inspector
  Rumsey, and to ask him to be waiting in the lobby of the Madagascar at
  quarter to twelve. I possessed no key to Mme. Storey's plans, and this latter
  message caused a feeling of dread to weigh on my breast.</p>

  <p>In due course I went home to change my dress, and then proceeded to the
  hotel. I saw the Inspector waiting in the lobby, and nodded to him as I
  passed. When I was shown up to Fay's suite I found that I was the first to
  arrive. Katy pounced on me to learn the inner reasons for her mistress's
  second extraordinary change of plans, but I had no heart to gossip with the
  maid.</p>

  <p>There was a table ready set for six persons. It looked lovely with its
  snowy cloth set off with glass and silver and flowers. All around the white
  panelled walls relieved with an old messotint or two there were pink-shaded
  lights bracketed in threes, and casting down a pleasant glow on the
  comfortable furniture covered with crisp cretonnes. Only the most expensive
  places dare to be as simple as that. There were flowers everywhere in the
  room. To me there was a horrible irony in the sight of all this dainty
  preparation for such a scene.</p>

  <p>Fay, Mrs. Brunton, Darius Whittall and Kreuger came in together. Their
  faces gave nothing away.</p>

  <p>"Where is Mme. Storey?" I asked involuntarily.</p>

  <p>"She'll be up directly," said Fay. "She met a friend in the lobby."</p>

  <p>I supposed this was Rumsey.</p>

  <p>Fay and Mrs. Brunton disappeared within their respective bedrooms to
  remove their wraps. When Fay left the room something of the inferno of
  passion that was consuming Whittall broke through the mask he wore. He looked
  at me as much as to say: What the hell are you doing here? I paid no
  attention. Mme. Storey entered, and he smiled at her obsequiously. Mme.
  Storey lit a cigarette, and lingered in the sitting-room exchanging some
  trivial remarks with Whittall until Fay returned. She then said something
  about tidying herself, and entered Fay's room alone.</p>

  <p>When she came back we sat down at the table, and the waiters entered. Mme.
  Storey, alone of the women, was not in evening dress, nevertheless by her
  mere presence she dominated the scene. Everybody else was trying to be funny.
  There was a ghastly hollowness about it. Whittall was the loudest of all. Fay
  seemed pleasant towards him, but I suspected that her pleasant manner
  concealed a certain reserve. Mrs. Brunton seemed to be satisfied that
  everything was going well, as long as there was plenty of noise.</p>

  <p>Fay occupied the place of honour at the head of the table, with Mme.
  Storey on one hand, and me on the other. Kreuger sat next to Mme. Storey, and
  Mrs. Brunton next to me. Whittall faced Fay across the table. Fay, I
  remember, was wearing a pale pink gown embroidered with self-coloured beads
  in a quaint design. It lent her beauty an exquisite fragility. When he
  thought nobody was looking at him, I would catch Whittall gazing at her like
  a lost soul.</p>

  <p>The meal, I suppose, left nothing to be desired. I cannot remember what we
  ate or drank. Some day I hope I may be invited to such a perfect little
  supper when my mind is at peace. This one was wasted on all of us. It was
  soon over, and the cigarettes lighted. Mrs. Brunton chattered on.</p>

  <p>"There was twenty-one hundred dollars in the house to-night. That's a
  hundred and fifty more than capacity."</p>

  <p>"How do you do that sum?" asked Whittall facetiously.</p>

  <p>"Standees," said Mrs. Brunton. "...And what a house! So warm and
  responsive. I could have hugged them to my breast!"</p>

  <p>"Rather an armful," put in Whittall.</p>

  <p>"And when she finished her waltz song, didn't they rise to her! Oh, it was
  wonderful! Never have I heard such applause! And didn't she look sweet when
  she came out to acknowledge it? I declare her pretty eyes were full of real
  tears!"</p>

  <p>"Well, I thought maybe it was the last time," said Fay.</p>

  <p>"I thought they would <i>never</i> let her go!" Mrs. Brunton rhapsodised.
  "She took fourteen calls!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, mamma!" protested Fay, laughing. "Draw it mild!"</p>

  <p>"Fourteen!" said Mrs. Brunton firmly. "I said it, and I stick to it!
  Fourteen!"</p>

  <p>She appealed to Whittall and to Kreuger, and they made haste to agree in
  order to shut her up.</p>

  <p>"One doesn't have to exaggerate the successes of a girl like Fay," she
  went on complacently. "I saw Mildred Mortimer and her mother hidden away at
  the back of the house. I can. imagine what <i>their</i> feelings were!"</p>

  <p>Such was Mrs. Brunton's style. She turned it on like a tap. She had been
  something of a beauty in her day, and she looked quite handsome tonight in
  her black evening gown, with her hair freshened up with henna, and prettily
  dressed.</p>

  <p>Whittall, I remember, made an effort to break up the party. "Fay, you look
  tired," he said. "I think we'd better beat it."</p>

  <p>Fay protested. Kreuger, always eager to take a hint from his master,
  pushed his chair back. No one else moved. I saw Mme. Storey, for whom this
  suggestion was really intended, glance at her wrist watch. Then she helped
  herself to a cigarette, and gave the conversation a fresh start.</p>

  <p>The crisis was precipitated by an innocent question of Fay's. "Why are you
  so quiet, Rosika?"</p>

  <p>"I am thinking of that poor lady who is dead," said Mme. Storey
  gravely.</p>

  <p>It was like an icy hand laid on each heart there. A deathly silence fell
  on us. It seemed to last for ever. I felt paralysed. Mrs. Brunton was the
  first to recover herself. She was afraid of Mme. Storey, and dared not be
  openly rude, but her anger was evident enough in her voice.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I say! What a thing to bring up at such a time and place! I'm
  surprised at you, Mme. Storey!"</p>

  <p>"We are all thinking of her," said Mme. Storey. "It would be better to
  clear our minds of the subject."</p>

  <p>"<i>I</i> wasn't thinking of her, I assure you!"</p>

  <p>Even the gentle Fay was resentful. "It's not fair to Darius," she
  murmured.</p>

  <p>"Darius is a man and must face things!"</p>

  <p>I glanced at Whittall. He had the look of one braced to receive a fatal
  stroke.</p>

  <p>"I am so sorry for her!" murmured Fay distressfully. "I often think about
  her and wonder...But, Rosika, is it <i>my</i> fault that I am happy? that I
  have everything, while she is dead?"</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey made no reply to this.</p>

  <p>"She solved her problems in her own way!" cried Mrs. Brunton excitedly.
  "Who shall blame her? Can't you leave her in peace?"</p>

  <p>"She did not kill herself," said Mme. Storey slowly. "She was
  murdered."</p>

  <p>Again that awful silence. Horror crushed us.</p>

  <p>Whittall lost his grip on himself. "You promised me...you promised me...!"
  he cried shakily, "that you would not tell her..."</p>

  <p>"We had better not talk about promises," said Mme. Storey with a steady
  look at him.</p>

  <p>"Darius!...you already knew this!" gasped Fay.</p>

  <p>He could make no answer.</p>

  <p>Fay turned to Mme. Storey. "Rosika...how do you know?...how do you know?"
  she faltered.</p>

  <p>"She received a letter that evening which drew her out to the pavilion.
  She was unarmed when she left the house."</p>

  <p>"Then it's quite clear," said Fay, laughing hysterically. "The letter must
  have been from her lover. He pleaded with her for the last time, and when she
  was obdurate he shot her in a fit of desperation."</p>

  <p>"She was shot within three minutes of leaving the house," said Mme. Storey
  relentlessly. "Not much time for pleading. No! Somebody was waiting for her
  in the pavilion with the gun ready."</p>

  <p>"But it <i>must</i> have been her lover!" wailed Fay.</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey sat looking straight ahead of her, pale and immovable as
  Nemesis. "It was somebody who is amongst us here," she said.</p>

  <p>You could hear the tight breasts around the table labouring for breath.
  Each of us glanced with furtive dread at our companions. Whittall broke
  again.</p>

  <p>"Well, who?...who?...who?" he cried wildly, "Out with it!"</p>

  <p>"Somebody amongst us here?" quavered Mrs. Brunton in a high falsetto. "I
  never heard of such a thing!"</p>

  <p>The ageing woman with her touched-up cheeks and dyed hair looked like a
  caricature of herself. Everybody around the table looked stricken, clownish,
  scattered in the wits. I'm sure I was no exception. Only my beautiful
  mistress was as composed as Death.</p>

  <p>"Fay," she asked, "what were you doing on the evening of September
  eleventh?"</p>

  <p>I turned absolutely sick at heart. Mrs. Brunton and Whittall loudly and
  angrily protested. The exquisite girl shrank away from Mme. Storey, and went
  as pale as paper. Apart from the noisy voices of the others I heard her
  dismayed whisper.</p>

  <p>"Rosika!...I?...<i>I?</i>...Oh, Rosika, surely you can't think that
  I..."</p>

  <p>"This is too much!" cried Mrs. Brunton, jumping up. "Must we submit to be
  insulted here in our own rooms? Mr. Whittall, are you going to permit this to
  go any further?"</p>

  <p>"No!" cried Whittall, banging the table. "This woman is taking too much on
  herself! She has no right to catechise us!"</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey looked at me. "Bella," she said, "admit the gentleman who is
  waiting outside."</p>

  <p>As well as my legs would serve me I got to the door. Inspector Rumsey was
  in the corridor. He came in.</p>

  <p>With a wave of the hand, Mme. Storey introduced him to the gaping company.
  "Inspector Rumsey and I are acting in concert in this matter," she said. "I
  suppose you will allow that he has a right to ask questions."</p>

  <p>Rumsey quietly sat down in a chair away from the table.</p>

  <p>"Now, Fay," said Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>The girl raised her gentle eyes in an imploring and reproachful glance
  upon her friend. "Oh, Rosika, how can you?" she murmured.</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey's face was like a mask. "I must do my duty as I see it. Answer
  my question, please."</p>

  <p>Fay put a hand over her eyes. "That was the night of the first showing of
  'Ashes of Roses'," she murmured. "I did not go. I was not well. I went to bed
  when Mamma went out."</p>

  <p>"But you got up again," said Mme. Storey remorselessly. "I have a report
  from the garage where you keep your cars, stating that you telephoned for the
  convertible at 8.10 that night, and that it was handed over to you at the
  door of your hotel five minutes later. It was returned to the garage at
  half-past ten."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," murmured Fay feebly. "I forgot."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Brunton and Whittall looked dumfounded. As for me, I simply could not
  believe my ears.</p>

  <p>"Where did you go?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"I...I was just driving around for the air. I don't remember exactly."</p>

  <p>"According to the custom of the garage," Mme. Storey continued, "a reading
  of the speedometer was taken when the car went out, and again when it was
  returned. The elapsed mileage was twenty miles. That is just the distance to
  Riverdale and back."</p>

  <p>Fay sat up suddenly. "I never went to Riverdale!" she cried sharply.</p>

  <p>"Then where did you go?" persisted Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>A deep blush overspread Fay's face and neck. "Well, if you must know," she
  said a little defiantly, "I picked up Frank Esher in front of his house and
  took him for a drive."</p>

  <p>Again Mrs. Brunton and Whittall looked at her open-mouthed.</p>

  <p>The Inspector spoke up cheerfully. Like everybody else, he wished to be on
  Fay's side. "That will be easy to verify," he said, taking out his
  note-book.</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately," said Mme. Storey coldly, "Mr. Esher has disappeared."</p>

  <p>"Well, anyhow," cried Whittall, "you can't convict her of a crime simply
  because she chanced to take a drive that night. It's ridiculous!"</p>

  <p>"Ridiculous!" echoed Mrs. Brunton.</p>

  <p>"I have not yet done," said Mme. Storey. "Inspector, will you please state
  what you learned respecting the purchase of the guns."</p>

  <p>Rumsey consulted the note-book. "On May 24th Mr. Darius Whittall purchased
  two Matson 32 calibre automatics from Lorber and Staley's. He has an account
  there. Those were the only pistols of that design he ever purchased from
  them. One was numbered 13417, the other 13418."</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey turned to Whittall. "Are you willing to concede that you gave
  one of these pistols to your wife, and one to Fay?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I refuse to answer without advice of counsel," he muttered.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter," said Mme. Storey, undisturbed; "for we already know
  from other sources that you gave one to your wife and one to Fay, making the
  same remark to each...Fay, where is yours?"</p>

  <p>"In the bottom drawer of my bureau," came the prompt reply.</p>

  <p>"Will you fetch it, please?"</p>

  <p>Fay called for Katy. The girl immediately appeared in the doorway, looking
  white and scared. Evidently she had overheard at least part of what had
  occurred.</p>

  <p>"Bring me the gun from the bottom drawer of my bureau."</p>

  <p>The strangeness of this request completed the demoralisation of the maid.
  She stood there like one incapable of motion. Fay herself sprang up and ran
  into the next room. From there we heard her cry:</p>

  <p>"It's gone!"</p>

  <p>Then her excited questioning of the maid. Katy swore that she had neither
  touched nor even seen the gun. She had not yet reached that drawer when her
  packing was interrupted, she said. The girl got the idea, somehow, that her
  own honesty was in question. She had no idea that her words were convicting
  her mistress. Fay finally came back to her seat with a wandering and vacant
  air. She kept repeating: "I can't imagine...! I can't imagine...!" The
  Inspector looked very grave.</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey remorselessly resumed: "I recovered Mrs. Whittall's pistol
  this morning. It is in my possession, properly marked for identification. The
  number of it is 13417. The pistol found in Mrs. Whittall's hand, that is to
  say the one from which the fatal shot was fired, was subsequently given by
  Mr. Whittall to the Captain of the precinct. I obtained it from the Captain
  this afternoon. The number is 13418. Here it is."</p>

  <p>She produced the weapon from a little bag that she carried on her arm. She
  handed the sinister black object to Rumsey, who read off the number, 13418,
  and handed it back to her.</p>

  <p>At first I couldn't take it in. Neither could Fay. Her wandering eyes,
  like a child's, searched from one face to another for the explanation. Mrs.
  Brunton and Whittall were sitting there, literally frozen with horror. Rumsey
  had got up. It was from his grave and compassionate gaze at Fay that I
  realised she stood convicted in his eyes. What a dreadful moment!</p>

  <p>Fay burst into tears, and dropped her head between her outstretched arms
  on the table. "Oh, how can you!...How can you!" she sobbed.</p>

  <p>At that something seemed to break inside of me. I forgot everything; my
  duty to my mistress; everything. I was only conscious of the weeping girl
  whom I loved. I got to my feet. "It's a shame! It's a shame!" I heard myself
  crying. "She didn't do it! She <i>couldn't</i> have done it! Look at her!
  What does your evidence amount to beside that!"</p>

  <p>Fay reached for me like a frightened child, and I took her in my arms.</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey never looked at me. No muscle of her face changed. "The rest
  lies with you, Inspector," she said quietly.</p>

  <p>Rumsey's distress comes back to me now. Then I was oblivious to
  everything. "It will be all right...It will be all right," he kept saying.
  "I'm sure that a further investigation will clear everything up. But I'm
  sorry...I would not be justified...I must ask the young lady..."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Brunton jumped up with a shriek. "Is he going to <i>arrest</i>
  her!"</p>

  <p>"Don't call it an arrest, ma'am; a brief detention..."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no! no! no!" Mrs. Brunton flung herself down beside the girl, and
  wrapped her arms around Fay's knees. "It's all lies!" she cried. "All
  lies!...It was <i>I</i> who shot Mrs. Whittall!"</p>

  <p>I have scarcely the heart to describe the painful scene that followed. Fay
  was broken-hearted, of course, but the shock to her proved to be less than
  Mme. Storey had feared. It turned out that for weeks past, Fay had divined
  that her companion was carrying a load of guilt on her breast, though, of
  course, the girl had no idea of its nature. She was already secretly
  estranged from the woman who passed as her mother.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless she loyally wished to accompany her to Police Headquarters,
  but the rest of us dissuaded her from it. Kreuger went with Mrs. Brunton, but
  Darius Whittall remained with us. He had to learn his fate. Before Mme.
  Storey and I, he said with a despairing hangdog air:</p>

  <p>"It was not my fault, Fay."</p>

  <p>She looked at him with gravely accusing eyes. There was nothing childish
  about her then. "No," she said quietly, "but you were not sorry when it
  happened." Unfastening the pearls from about her neck, and drawing off the
  ring, she handed them over.</p>

  <p>He knew it was final. He went away, a broken man. When we three were alone
  together, Fay wept again. Mme. Storey looked as uncomfortable as a boy in the
  presence of emotion. From the little bag she took the gun she had produced at
  the table.</p>

  <p>"Here is your gun, Fay," she said. "I took it out of your drawer when I
  went into your room to change my hat."</p>

  <p>We opened our eyes at that. Nothing so simple had ever occurred to us.</p>

  <p>"I hope you can forgive me for those terrible moments I gave you," Mme.
  Storey went on. "I couldn't help myself. That woman covered her tracks so
  well, there was nothing for it but to force a confession."</p>

  <p>Fay forgave her freely.</p>

  <p>"I owe Bella an apology, too," Mme. Storey said with a rueful glance in my
  direction. "For keeping her in the dark. You see, I needed that outburst from
  Bella to give the scene verisimilitude."</p>

  <p>This made me feel rather foolish, but of course I was not troubling about
  a little thing like that then.</p>

  <p>"I am alone now," sobbed Fay.</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey murmured the name of Frank Esher. "I suggest that that woman
  may have fomented the trouble between you and him because he was poor," she
  said.</p>

  <p>"She was always against him," Fay agreed.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you write to him now?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know where he is!" mourned Fay.</p>

  <p>"In care of the British-American Development Company, Georgetown, British
  Guiana," said Mme. Storey dryly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Rosika!" This with her face hidden on my shoulder.</p>

  <p>"In fact, why not cable?" said Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Rosika. You do it for me."</p>

  <p>"Well, as a matter of fact, I have cabled already," said Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>I cannot do better than conclude by appending Mrs. Brunton's subsequent
  confession to the police&mdash;her real name was Elinor Tinsley. All that was
  so baffling in the case therein becomes clear.</p>

  <p>"I am aware that anything I say may be used against me. I want to tell the
  truth now. I'm glad it's out. It was too great a load to bear. I did it for
  her; for the one whom I called my daughter. I loved her as much as I could my
  own child. In spite of all I said, I knew that she had not sufficient talent
  to maintain her as a star. So many new faces coming to the front each year. I
  wanted to secure her future. I wanted her to have the best.</p>

  <p>"When Mr. Whittall began to pay her attention I saw our chance in him. But
  his wife was in the way. He was anxious for a divorce, but she wouldn't. I
  couldn't forget about it. I brooded and brooded on it. I felt I had to act
  quickly, because Mr. Whittall had a reputation for fickleness. I was afraid
  he'd take a fancy to somebody else. Once he told me the name of a man he
  thought his wife was secretly in love with&mdash;I won't mention it here; and
  that gave me my first idea.</p>

  <p>"I got a sample of Mrs. Whittall's handwriting by writing her a begging
  letter under an assumed name, and I practised and practised until I was able
  to imitate it. Then I sent a letter as coming from her to this man I told you
  about, hoping that it would result in throwing them into each other's arms,
  and that there would have to be a divorce then. But weeks passed and nothing
  happened. I was no further forward than before.</p>

  <p>"Then one day Mrs. Whittall asked my daughter and me to have lunch and tea
  with her at her place. And when we were having tea out in the pavilion, the
  whole thing seemed to unroll itself before me. I thought of the first showing
  of 'Ashes of Roses' that was coming soon, and what a good chance that would
  give me, and I made up my mind I would try again that night. I knew I
  wouldn't have any trouble with Fay, because she doesn't care for pictures,
  and I could easily persuade her not to go.</p>

  <p>"I got a sample of that man's handwriting on another pretext, and I
  practised until I was able to write a letter that looked like his. I bought
  the gun at &mdash;&mdash; (a big department store) for cash, so the sale
  couldn't be traced. I knew the kind of gun Mr. Whittall had bought for his
  wife, and I got the same. I wanted to make it look like suicide. Then I wrote
  a letter to Mrs. Whittall in this man's name, asking her to come to me, for
  God's sake, in the little pavilion at nine-thirty that night. Of course, she
  ought to have known, after the other letter, but I figured if she was in love
  she wouldn't stop to think. If she hadn't come, I'd just have tried something
  else. I sent the letter the same afternoon with a special delivery stamp on
  it. Through a messenger it could have been traced.</p>

  <p>"My daughter and I had special invitations to see the private showing of
  'Ashes of Roses' that night. Without seeming to, I persuaded Fay to stay at
  home. I took a taxicab to the theatre, arriving there about eight-fifteen. I
  had the gun in my reticule. I greeted many friends in the lobby, so I could
  prove an alibi if anything went wrong. I took a seat on the side aisle,
  beside one of the exits, and when the lights were put out, it was easy for me
  to slip out through that exit without anybody seeing.</p>

  <p>"I took the West Side subway to the end of the line, and walked up the
  hill to Riverdale, and on down the other side towards the river. I had fixed
  in my mind the road that ran alongside the wall of the Whittall property. I
  climbed the wall, and went up the hill to the pavilion. I was in plenty of
  time. I took the gun in my hand and waited, hidden behind a pillar. I kept my
  gloves on so I wouldn't leave any fingerprint on the gun. When Mrs. Whittall
  came running in, I pressed the gun to her temple and pulled the trigger. She
  fell back outside. She never made a sound. I closed her hand over the gun as
  well as I could, and went back the way I came.</p>

  <p>"I had found out from Mr. Kreuger that he and Mr. Whittall would be dining
  at the Hotel Norfolk that night. I wanted to warn Mr. Whittall to secure his
  wife's gun. I knew he'd be glad enough to hush up any scandal. But I was
  afraid to stop at Van Cortlandt for fear somebody might remember seeing me in
  a telephone booth. So I rode on the subway down to 145th Street, and
  telephoned from a pay station there. Then I rode on the subway down to Times
  Square, and took a taxi to the hotel. That is all I have to say."</p>

  <br>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">There were eight of us seated around the table, all in
  costume and masked. Of the eight the only one I knew was my employer, Mme.
  Storey. She had come as Queen Anne Boleyn in a superb black velvet costume
  with hoops and stays.</p>

  <p>The dancers in the hall outside had unmasked long ago, but when midnight
  was approaching Mme. Storey had suggested to our little party that we would
  have more fun if we kept our masks on. Where all were unknown to each other
  there could be no inhibitions, she said; and the proposal was
  enthusiastically carried. The champagne and the fun flowed fast and
  furiously, but I couldn't help feeling from a certain tenseness in the
  atmosphere that there was more going on than appeared on the surface.</p>

  <p>In the midst of it all Mme. Storey's partner, a stalwart, attractive young
  man in the gay costume of Harlequin, suddenly leaned back in his chair and
  lifted his mask&mdash;"to get air," he said.</p>

  <p>I had a glimpse of a handsome, reckless, slightly drunken face, and then
  the mask snapped back. But the damage was done. It was immediately apparent
  to me that several people around the table had recognised our
  Harlequin&mdash;particularly the two women who faced us. I knew it by the
  rigid, snake-like poise of their heads. They stopped laughing and I could
  imagine the cold glare of jealous rage behind their masks.</p>

  <p>The woman to the left who was of mature figure was dressed as a harem
  favourite, and somebody had christened her Zuleika. In addition to the mask
  her face was further hidden by a veil covering the lower part of her face.
  The one on the other side was a slender girl whose trim figure was cunningly
  set off by a sailor suit. She had earned the name of Jackie, of course.</p>

  <p>The man between them was all rigged out in the fantastic costume of a
  Turkish Janizary or something, enormously tall hat, voluminous breeches and a
  curved sword called a <i>yataghan</i>. We had christened him Abdullah.</p>

  <p>It soon became evident from Abdullah's sneering remarks that he also knew
  Harlequin, and hated him. Harlequin himself appeared to be too much uplifted
  by wine to realise the damage he had done in lifting his mask. Or else he
  didn't care. It was the annual ball of the Butlers' Association in Webster
  Hall over on the East Side. Mme. Storey had heard of the affair through
  Crider, one of her operatives who was at that time serving as butler to the
  Creighton Woodleys, in an effort to clear up the robbery of Mrs. Woodley's
  jewels. The Woodleys' former butler, a man called George Danforth, had been
  given a clean bill of health by the police. Nevertheless, it was believed to
  have been an inside job, and our man Crider had been put in in Danforth's
  place to see what he could learn. Danforth presumably had got another
  job.</p>

  <p>I knew nothing of the details of this Woodley jewel robbery, being all
  tied up at the time in the tangle of the Lear Caybourn case. In our office we
  were so swamped with criminal investigations that my employer had to delegate
  part of her work to me. Mme. Storey always says she would like to get out of
  the criminal part of our business; pure psychology is her line. However, she
  admits there is money in crime; also publicity. And publicity leads to more
  money.</p>

  <p>I remember when our dresses for the ball were sent home I protested at
  their richness and elegance. "They will make us too conspicuous at a
  servants' ball," I said.</p>

  <p>"We wish to be conspicuous," she answered, and even then I did not catch
  on. "This ball is going to surprise you, Bella," she added with a twinkle in
  her eye.</p>

  <p>It did. But incidentally I may say that it surprised her too.</p>

  <p>I was dressed as an Italian page of the Renaissance period; brown silk
  tights, velvet doublet and a cunning little cap over one ear. I blushed when
  I put on the tights, but I felt all right as soon as I got behind a mask. I
  really have very nice legs. Mme. Storey says I don't know how to ballyhoo my
  own charms. She christened me Lorenzo, and I answered to it all evening.</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey as Queen Anne Boleyn in her gleaming black dress without any
  note of colour was easily the finest woman present. Harlequin told her so
  instantly, and thereafter he never left her side. I did not lack for partners
  myself, but I confess I was a little scared amongst all those strangers, and
  I took care to keep my chief within sight.</p>

  <p>It is curious to see how, even at a masked ball, the different cliques
  will form. Gradually, as the best-dressed and most elegant persons present,
  our little company of eight came together.</p>

  <p>It was Mr. Punch who asked us to supper in a private room upstairs. He was
  the best turned-out of any of the men. A small man with a considerable
  paunch, the part suited him. Everybody knows the costume, doublet and knee
  breeches of alternate stripes of green and red velvet; white silk stockings
  and shoes with big silver buckles; grotesque hump and tall cap with the point
  turned down in front. A tiny gold bell hung from the point of his cap and
  tinkled every time he turned his head.</p>

  <p>I got my second great surprise when I saw the supper room to which we were
  led, the banks of roses on the table, the magnums of champagne cooling in
  buckets of ice. At a butlers' supper! Of course Mr. Punch might have lifted
  the champagne from his master's cellar, but he must have paid for the roses.
  One would think it had taken a whole month's wages.</p>

  <p>The eighth member of the party was a big man dressed in the flaming
  costume of Mephistopheles complete with horns and forked tail. He had a mask
  with headpiece that covered him entirely. All you could see of the man
  himself were his rolling eyes.</p>

  <p>The mask was fixed in a devilish leer, though the voice that came out of
  it was mild enough. Such are the inconsistencies of a masquerade party. This
  man spoke with an English accent, and he was the only one who resembled one's
  idea of a butler.</p>

  <p>"They are not butlers tonight," Mme. Storey whispered to me; "they are
  only men."</p>

  <p>Upon taking our places we discovered that the bank of roses which filled
  the whole centre of the table was interspersed with dozens of tiny coloured
  electric lights. As soon as we had finished eating somebody suggested turning
  out the main lights of the room in order to show up the table decorations.
  This was done, and the effect was weird in the extreme. Imagine those little
  lights, red, green, purple, amongst the roses, throwing up changing shadows
  on the grotesque, masked faces around the table. Mr. Punch at the head and
  Mephisto at the foot looked like figures out of a nightmare. But it was all
  good fun.</p>

  <p>Mephisto made a flowery speech to the effect that he had Henry the Eighth
  safe in hell, where he was making him pay with interest for his cruel
  treatment of the beautiful Anne Boleyn four hundred years ago. He described
  his torments with comic effect. Mr. Punch, not to be outdone, cut the little
  golden bell from his cap and begged the fair Anne to accept it as a
  keepsake.</p>

  <p>"Back up! Back up, Punch!" cried Harlequin. "What do you mean making up to
  the ladies with that hump on your back?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Punch wiggled his hump comically. "You don't know the half of it, my
  boy," he retorted good-naturedly; "that ornament gives me personality."</p>

  <p>A laugh went around the table. It was at this moment that Harlequin, in a
  moment of forgetfulness, raised his mask, and I saw that we were in for
  trouble.</p>

  <p>There was a silence while the two women across the table slowly stiffened.
  There was a great contrast in their appearance&mdash;the big woman in the
  flowing draperies of a Turkish <i>houri</i>, and the slender girl in the trim
  sailor suit; but Zuleika and Jackie were alike in their feelings. They had
  just had wine enough to make them forget concealment. A woman's naked
  jealousy is not pretty. Their masks gave nothing away, but I could fairly
  feel their ugly feelings coming across the table in waves.</p>

  <p>The handsome Harlequin was oblivious of it. He jumped up and raised his
  glass. "Bottoms up! Bottoms up," he cried recklessly. "The party's getting
  slow!"</p>

  <p>Abdullah in his grotesque high-crowned hat leaned across the table with a
  sneer&mdash;he was seated between the two women. "As usual, you're liberal
  with the wine when another man is buying," he said.</p>

  <p>It was evident that all three people across the table knew Harlequin too
  well for their own peace of mind, though they seemed to be unknown to each
  other.</p>

  <p>Harlequin paid no attention, having already launched forth in a speech.
  The men were always making speeches. What this one was about I couldn't tell
  you; a lot of windy, humorous nonsense. Abdullah sat opposite, glowering and
  fingering his glass; muttering to himself. Finally he said aloud:</p>

  <p>"Oh, we've heard that before. Change your line! Change your line!"</p>

  <p>Harlequin, feeling that he had the crowd with him, hooted with laughter.
  "Better a monkey than a crab," he retorted.</p>

  <p>Abdullah sprang up from the table, trembling. "How about a blackguard?" he
  snarled. "A foul, lying blackguard!"</p>

  <p>Harlequin gave a leap and quicker than I could follow the blow, struck him
  on the side of the head. Abdullah rocked drunkenly and the tall hat rolled to
  the floor. He seemed not to know how to defend himself, but just stood there
  taking Harlequin's lightning blows. His one idea was to keep his adversary
  from unmasking him; he pressed a hand over his mask to keep it on.</p>

  <p>The wildest confusion followed. To my astonishment the two women who had
  seemed to be enraged at the gay Harlequin now turned on Abdullah, and the
  unfortunate Janizary was badly knocked about before aid could reach him.
  Following a blind instinct we all rushed to get into it, either to join the
  mêlée or to stop it, I can hardly say which. Only Anne Boleyn stood coldly to
  one side.</p>

  <p>It was an ugly scene; men punching and cursing; women screeching and
  clawing. When the two women were pulled away from Abdullah, they attacked
  each other. I have a vague impression that some of the dancers ran in from
  the hall, and were hustled out again by Mephisto. I know that a couple of
  waiters appeared and helped to stop the fight.</p>

  <p>Suddenly it was over. Harlequin and Abdullah were separated and pressed
  back. Harlequin was laughing. He had lost his mask for good now. The
  handsome, masculine face showed with extraordinary vividness amongst all the
  masked ones. I had never seen the man before that night.</p>

  <p>I heard little Jackie moaning softly: "George! George!"</p>

  <p>Zuleika turned on her, snarling: "Shut up, you fool! What is he to
  you?"</p>

  <p>One of Abdullah's cheeks was badly clawed, but he had succeeded in hanging
  on to his mask.</p>

  <p>And then simultaneously we all became aware of the ugly little automatic
  lying in the middle of the clear space where they had just been struggling.
  We gazed at it in horror. Nobody could tell how it had got there.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">"Whose is it?" asked Mr. Punch hoarsely.</p>

  <p>There was no answer.</p>

  <p>"It must be somebody's," he said, looking from face to face. "Is it yours,
  Harlequin?"</p>

  <p>"No," was the careless answer. "I couldn't hide a gun in this union
  suit."</p>

  <p>It was obvious that he spoke the truth.</p>

  <p>"Is it yours, Abdullah?"</p>

  <p>"No," was the sullen answer. I doubt if anybody believed him.</p>

  <p>"Yours, Mephisto?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"For myself, I say it is not mine," said Mr. Punch.</p>

  <p>One by one the women denied ownership, and the gun continued to lie on the
  floor. The waiters had retired and I don't believe they had noticed its
  presence in all the confusion.</p>

  <p>Nobody would touch it for fear of incriminating himself. Finally Anne
  Boleyn came forward and coolly picked it up. My employer was the only one to
  whom it could not have belonged, because up to that moment she had never been
  on that side of the table. She opened the magazine.</p>

  <p>"Fully loaded," she said.</p>

  <p>Emptying the shells into her hand, she showed them to us all, and dropped
  them in a pocket of her skirt. She then tossed the gun carelessly on the
  table. It fell at the place to Mr. Punch's right; that is to say where Anne
  Boleyn had previously been sitting.</p>

  <p>"The owner can claim it upon presentation of check," she said lightly.</p>

  <p>"You seem to be well accustomed to firearms, Anne," remarked the plump
  Zuleika acidly.</p>

  <p>"Now come, now come, ladies and gentlemen," said the suave Mr. Punch,
  rubbing his hands together. "We were all having a lovely time. Do not let
  this little unpleasantness spoil our evening. Let bygones be bygones. Take
  your seats again, I beg. There are still two magnums to be opened!"</p>

  <p>Harlequin's face lighted up at the mention of more wine. As to the others,
  I cannot say what was passing in their minds, but nobody made any move to
  leave. I was desperately anxious to get away from there. In the general
  movement around the table I managed to whisper in Anne's ear:</p>

  <p>"Oh, please, let's get out of this. There is certain to be more
  trouble."</p>

  <p>"We must see it through, Bella," she murmured. "Crider is outside if we
  need help."</p>

  <p>Harlequin stood behind Anne Boleyn's place holding her chair ready for
  her, but she coolly usurped Jackie's seat on the other side of the table at
  Mephisto's right.</p>

  <p>"Jackie, you run around and take my old place," she said to the girl in
  the sailor suit.</p>

  <p>Jackie obeyed with alacrity, for it placed her next to Harlequin. His face
  turned dark. "What's the matter?" he growled to Anne Boleyn.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I've had enough of you for the present," she answered good-naturedly.
  "I want to commune with the devil awhile."</p>

  <p>A laugh travelled around at Harlequin's expense, and he went as flat as a
  punctured tyre. It was a good stroke of policy on Mme. Storey's part. For a
  while it made things easier all around the table. Unluckily the situation was
  more serious than either of us suspected. Nothing we might have done could
  have averted what happened.</p>

  <p>There was a very curious thing about that gun. When the waiter entered to
  serve more wine, Mr. Punch whispered quickly: "Cover the gun."</p>

  <p>When I looked it was lying in front of Abdullah's place. How it got there
  I couldn't tell you. Nobody saw it moved around the table. Abdullah nervously
  dropped a napkin over it. As the champagne circulated the gun was forgotten
  again. It seemed of no importance because it was not loaded.</p>

  <p>The waiter turned on the main lights of the room in order to see how to
  serve the wine. When he retired he turned them out again, and we sat once
  more in the agreeable van-coloured glow like that of a Christmas tree. The
  door of the room was closed in order to keep out wandering groups of
  masqueraders. Like most masked balls, this was a very bibulous party.</p>

  <p>Mr. Punch and Mephisto at head and foot of the table both worked hard to
  make things go. The latter gave us a rendition of "Casey Jones," which I
  suppose was all the rage when he was young. But Abdullah and Zuleika would
  not join in the chorus. Moreover, Harlequin soon tired of the sailor lassie,
  and started talking to Anne Boleyn across the table, whereupon Jackie became
  enraged again. That party was doomed from the moment when Harlequin had first
  raised his mask.</p>

  <p>However, Mr. Punch was not yet at the end of his resources. He stood up at
  the head of the table, and rapped for order. He was a really impressive
  figure because his make-up was so good. He had some sort of a tin piece in
  his mouth that caused him to squeak and whistle in the manner one associates
  with Mr. Punch, and he sawed his arms just like the little figures operated
  by a hand from beneath. His false chin waggled in the most realistic manner.
  It brought back all the Punch and Judy shows of one's childhood, and most of
  us were immediately reduced to helpless laughter. Laughter puts you off your
  guard, and I foolishly began to think that the trouble was over.</p>

  <p>"Ladies and gentlemen," he squeaked, "if you will be kind enough to give
  me your attention for a few moments I will recite for you the early history
  of the immortal Mr. Punch. Laying aside the tragedy which overtook him, I am
  sure you will be glad to learn how Mr. Punch fell in love. It seems that when
  he was a young man..."</p>

  <p>At this moment the table lights went out, and the room was plunged into
  total darkness. A loud "Oh!" of astonishment escaped from us all. Immediately
  afterward there was a flash and a shot across the table from me, followed by
  a heavy crash immediately on my left where Harlequin sat.</p>

  <p>I instinctively slid under the table, and most of the others did the same.
  I brushed against Anne Boleyn under there, and smelled her perfume. In my
  terror I flung my arms around her, but she roughly thrust me away, and
  scrambled out of my reach. I was paralysed with terror.</p>

  <p>Then I heard the click of a switch and the electrolier went on, flooding
  the room with light. Mr. Punch's terrified voice gasped:</p>

  <p>"For God's sake, come out, all of you."</p>

  <p>The others crept out and I followed. What a frightful moment that was!
  Harlequin was stretched out on the floor beside his overturned chair with a
  bullet-hole in his forehead. One glance at him was enough. He was stone
  dead.</p>

  <p>Abdullah was sitting directly across the table staring, as if frozen, at
  the place where Harlequin had been. He was the only one who had not moved
  from his chair. He could not see the body where it had fallen. Before him lay
  the gun. Mephisto snatched it up out of his reach. Mr. Punch was by the door.
  It was he who had switched on the lights.</p>

  <p>There was a significant silence in the hall outside. Evidently they had
  heard the shot out there, and had stopped dead in their tracks. Presently we
  heard running feet approaching. Mephisto darted to the door and turned the
  key. People rattled the lock and pounded on the panels.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter? What's the matter?" they cried.</p>

  <p>"'S all right," said Mephisto in a carefully schooled voice. "Just a
  little friendly tussle. No harm done!"</p>

  <p>"Open the door!" they commanded.</p>

  <p>"You go to hell," said Mephisto, pretending to be a little drunk. "This is
  a private party. We don't want no intruders. 'S all right, I tell you."</p>

  <p>The running feet retreated from the door again. We were too much concerned
  with the horror inside the room to consider what they might do out there.</p>

  <p>Jackie cast herself down beside the body. "Oh, my darling! My darling!"
  she moaned. "Speak to me!"</p>

  <p>Her mask had fallen off, revealing a pale, pretty face convulsed with
  grief. The girl was a stranger to me, but it was terribly affecting.</p>

  <p>Zuleika ran around the table, and attempted to drag her away. "Who are
  you?" she cried. "Let me get a look at you. Why, I never saw you before! What
  right have you here?"</p>

  <p>"Well, who are you?" retorted Jackie.</p>

  <p>The older woman snatched her mask off and thrust her distorted face close
  into the girl's. "Look at me! Look at me!" she screeched. "I'm his wife,
  that's who I am!"</p>

  <p>Jackie collapsed in helpless weeping.</p>

  <p>The raging Zuleika turned on Abdullah then. "He did it!" she cried. "He
  was right beside me. There's the murderer! Unmask him!"</p>

  <p>Abdullah, with a terrified gesture, clapped a hand over his mask. Mephisto
  held the woman back from attacking him.</p>

  <p>"I didn't do it!" Abdullah kept crying hysterically. "I swear to God I am
  innocent. I never fired a gun in my life!"</p>

  <p>No one paid any attention to that. We had all seen the flash of the pistol
  from the spot where he sat. Moreover, it was soon proved that the table
  lights had not gone out by accident. The connection which was plugged into
  the floor under the centre of the table, between Abdullah and Harlequin, had
  been kicked out. Abdullah's feet had been the nearest to the plug, though any
  one of the four women might have reached it with a foot. Mr. Punch at the
  head of the table and Mephisto at the other end were too far away to have
  reached the plug.</p>

  <p>All this happened in much less time than it takes me to write it. Anne
  Boleyn was standing a little apart from the others, watching and listening. I
  remembered that she had been the last to creep out from under the table.</p>

  <p>"How did the gun get loaded again?" she asked quietly. We looked at one
  another blankly.</p>

  <p>"Well, it was lying under the napkin all that time," suggested Mr. Punch
  slowly. "Abdullah might have slipped it out and reloaded while we were
  singing."</p>

  <p>"It's a lie!" cried Abdullah. "I never touched it! I have no shells on me.
  Search me! Search me!"</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't need any more now," Mr. Punch dryly remarked.</p>

  <p>It is difficult for me to write about these moments calmly. Most of us
  were in a state bordering on hysteria. Every second produced a new sensation.
  As long as Jackie lay on the floor Abdullah could not see her. When she arose
  he had his first glimpse of her unmasked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, my God! Is it you?" he cried. "I might have known it."</p>

  <p>She paid no attention to him. She suddenly began to screech loudly: "Let
  me out of here! Let me out of here!" Running to one of the windows, she
  pulled back the portières and raised the sash. "There's the fire escape," she
  screamed. "We can get out this way!"</p>

  <p>Panic is catching. There was a general rush to follow her, but Mr. Punch
  dragged her back from the window and stood blocking the way. "Wait a minute!
  Wait a minute!" he cried, waving his hands, struggling for calmness. "If we
  beat it we'd only incriminate ourselves. Get back, you fools. You didn't all
  do it. You've got nothing to fear. Get back, I say. I've got a character to
  lose, if you haven't. I'm going to see this thing through. Get the
  police."</p>

  <p>We moved back from the window. His logic was unanswerable.</p>

  <p>He seemed to have an impulse of mercy then. "Give the guilty man a chance
  if you want," he said with a glance at Abdullah. "If you're willing to let
  him go, it's all right with me. Give him a chance for his life. We can shout
  for the police when he starts down the ladder."</p>

  <p>Pandemonium arose at this.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" cried the good-natured Mephisto.</p>

  <p>"No," screamed Zuleika, "let him go to the chair."</p>

  <p>Abdullah himself settled the matter by refusing to go. "I didn't do it,"
  he gabbled over and over. "I'm innocent&mdash;I swear it!"</p>

  <p>"All right," said Mr. Punch with a shrug. He closed the window.</p>

  <p>The next thing I remember (you must keep in mind that this whole scene
  lasted but about three minutes) was seeing Zuleika in a corner of the room
  busy with a powder pad and a tiny mirror. Like most women no longer young, as
  soon as she began to get a grip on herself her first thought was to repair
  the damage to her make-up. It was absolutely a pitiable sight to see her
  dabbing at her cheeks, because the woman's eyes were quite daft.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Abdullah levelled a shaking forefinger at her and yelled: "She's
  left-handed!"</p>

  <p>It was true; Zuleika had started to apply lipstick with her left hand.</p>

  <p>"She's left-handed! She's left-handed!" yelled Abdullah.</p>

  <p>"Well, what of it?" said Zuleika, staring, lipstick poised in air.</p>

  <p>"She sat at my right," cried Abdullah. "The shot was fired beside me.
  She's left-handed! She did it!"</p>

  <p>"You lie!" cried Zuleika, showing her teeth. She had been a dark beauty in
  her day. The rest of us simply gaped at this new turn.</p>

  <p>"If she is his wife she had good cause to do it," shrilled Abdullah. "He
  was always running after other women. He took my girl from me! Zuleika
  snatched up the pistol beside me. She did it! I will swear it on the
  Book!"</p>

  <p>"You lie!" repeated Zuleika. "You accuse me," she cried suddenly; "how
  about <i>her</i>?" She pointed to the tall figure of Anne Boleyn quietly
  watching. "She was supposed to have emptied the magazine, wasn't she? She
  played a sleight-of-hand trick on all of you, that's what! Why did she change
  her seat at the table? So she could slip between me and Abdullah when the
  lights went out and fire the shot! Take her mask off, and let's have a look
  at her!"</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey smiled coldly at this tirade. She did not have to protect her
  mask, because there was nobody present with nerve enough to touch it. "I was
  the first one under the table," she said quietly.</p>

  <p>"Then how did the gun get loaded again?" Zuleika furiously demanded. "You
  were the last one to touch it."</p>

  <p>"No," said Anne Boleyn. "Because somehow it got moved from my old seat
  next to Harlequin around to Abdullah's."</p>

  <p>This forgotten fact was received in a dead silence.</p>

  <p>"Let me have a look at that gun, please," said Anne Boleyn to Mephisto,
  who had been keeping it all this time.</p>

  <p>"Don't give it to her!" cried Zuleika.</p>

  <p>"I've emptied it," muttered Mephisto. "We don't want any more
  shooting."</p>

  <p>"You may keep it in your own hands," said my employer coolly. "I only want
  to look at the top of the barrel."</p>

  <p>She glanced at it as Mephisto held it, and then threw a bombshell among us
  by saying: "This is not the gun I emptied and threw on the table."</p>

  <p>We stared at her. Mephisto instantly became panicky. "I have no other gun
  on me," he stammered.</p>

  <p>"I didn't say you had," she said.</p>

  <p>"How do you know it's not the same gun?" cried Mr. Punch.</p>

  <p>"Because I marked it when I unloaded it," she answered. "I scratched the
  barrel with my ring."</p>

  <p>"Another gun?" said Abdullah huskily. "What has become of the first
  one?"</p>

  <p>"That's what we'd all like to know," she said blandly. "Please stand where
  you are, and I'll try to dope it out."</p>

  <p>She did not have to speak twice, for all were arrested by the new and
  peremptory tone in her voice. Stepping to the left of the head of the
  table&mdash;that is to say, almost on the spot from whence the shot had been
  fired&mdash;she went on thoughtfully: "The murderer had to make a quick
  substitution of the loaded gun for the empty. He or she had to hide the empty
  gun instantly&mdash;too dangerous to keep it on the person. He would have to
  take the handiest place, trusting to retrieve it later. Well, in any room
  there are only a limited number of hiding-places..."</p>

  <p>The bright eyes through the slits in the mask travelled slowly around the
  room and finally came to rest on a wine bucket standing on the floor
  alongside the mantelpiece almost directly behind Abdullah's chair. The empty
  bottle was now sticking upside down in the ice and water. She pushed up her
  sleeve a little way, and thrust her hand into the water alongside the bottle.
  She drew it out, grasping a second gun identical with the other.</p>

  <p>Glancing at the barrel, she said casually: "There's the scratch I made
  behind the sight if any of you are interested in checking it up."</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">The silence in the room was broken by Zuleika, who said with
  a sneer: "Easy enough to find something when you know where you put it."</p>

  <p>The effect of this remark was only to focus suspicion on Zuleika
  herself.</p>

  <p>Abdullah muttered in a dazed way: "Two guns? Two guns? That lets me out,
  don't it?"</p>

  <p>"Why should it?" demanded Zuleika. "You could hide a gross of guns in that
  costume. I knocked against one of them when I sat down at the table!"</p>

  <p>Zuleika, it appeared, was ready to charge anybody with the murder.</p>

  <p>"It's a lie!" whined Abdullah.</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey meanwhile was comparing her gun with the one Mephisto
  held.</p>

  <p>"Same style and make," she remarked. "No doubt they were carried by the
  same person."</p>

  <p>We now heard a sound that threw everybody except Anne Boleyn into another
  wild panic. It was the distant clanging of a gong in the street. Instantly it
  was clear to us all that the people outside had sent for the police. With a
  moan of terror, Jackie ran to the window and threw it up. Mr. Punch made no
  move to stop her now. Out she went, followed by Zuleika and Abdullah. When it
  came to the point, Abdullah was not so anxious to face the police after
  all.</p>

  <p>Myself, I was wild to follow. The dead man on the floor, the clanging of
  that horrible gong, the thought of a fight with the police&mdash;it was too
  much. My nerve failed me completely; but I waited for some sign from my
  employer. Mr. Punch seemed to have lost his head, too. He stood there biting
  his fingers in a horrible state of indecision. Mephisto at the window shouted
  to him:</p>

  <p>"Come on! Come on! You can't face this out alone, you fool!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Punch flung up his arms.</p>

  <p>"All right," he cried. "You are all witness that I didn't want to go. If
  you must go, I've got a car in the street. I'll get you away." He turned to
  us and shouted: "Come on! They're already in the building."</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey gave me a sign, and I hustled after Mephisto. I left her and
  Mr. Punch contending which should go last. She got her way.</p>

  <p>Out on the fire escape my head reeled. The pattering of those descending
  feet on the iron steps below me made me shudder. It is a sound which suggests
  fire and catastrophe.</p>

  <p>The fire escape was on the rear of the building. Late as it was, lights
  went up in the windows of the surrounding tenements, and bodies hung half
  out.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" they cried back and forth to each other. "There they
  go! Look at them!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Punch stood by my side, stamping with impatience, while Anne Boleyn
  was still only two-thirds down. "Come on! Come on!" he whispered
  frantically.</p>

  <p>"Coming!" she answered serenely.</p>

  <p>She reached the ground just as the police started issuing from the window
  above. Scrambling over the fence any way we could, we found ourselves in a
  narrow passage which communicated with the next street. The others were
  hovering in the mouth of the passage, uncertain where to turn.</p>

  <p>"This way!" whispered Mr. Punch, taking the lead.</p>

  <p>We ran around the first corner into an alley. It was evident from the
  sounds that a crowd was gathering in front of Webster Hall, but by the grace
  of Providence the dark streets behind were empty. Mr. Punch flung open the
  doors of a big limousine standing in the alley. He took the wheel, and all
  the rest of us piled in pell-mell behind. When he started the engine the
  sound brought men running from the front of the hall to the other end of the
  alley, and the cry went up:</p>

  <p>"There they go!"</p>

  <p>The gong began to clang again.</p>

  <p>As we crossed the street in the rear of the hall, the police were coming
  out of the passageway by which we had escaped a minute earlier. One of them
  shot at us. I saw the sparks where the bullets ricochetted from the paving
  stones. But we were only in sight for a moment before plunging into the
  second block of the alley, and they were all on foot. There was no car at
  hand for them to seize.</p>

  <p>The awful strain relaxed a little. What a strange crew we were in the back
  of that limousine! All masked and watching each other out of the corners of
  the eye-slits. The two women had resumed their masks, though what they
  expected to gain by it now, it would have been hard to say. And what a load
  we carried beside the seven people! Love, hatred, guilt, suspicion, and fear,
  all squeezed up together as in an affectionate embrace.</p>

  <p>Something, I don't know what, the suggestion of a new sound behind us
  perhaps, prompted me to peep under the curtain over the rear window. To my
  dismay I discovered that a light car filled with policemen had crept up
  almost upon us, and was gaining rapidly. There was no particular reason why I
  should have feared the police, but I was terrified sick at the thought of
  more shooting.</p>

  <p>"Oh, they're coming!" I gasped.</p>

  <p>Scarcely slackening speed at all, Mr. Punch turned the first corner to the
  left. The heavy limousine reeled, teetered, slid, while we held our breath
  and clutched at one another. But the four wheels came down to earth again and
  we rushed through the side street in safety. Not so the policemen. The light
  car skidded half across the street, leaped to the sidewalk and crashed to a
  standstill against the house-fronts. I only hope the poor fellows in it were
  not seriously hurt.</p>

  <p>That was the end of pursuit. Mr. Punch turned a few more corners and then,
  slackening speed, put on his mask and spoke to us through the front window.
  He was less suave now.</p>

  <p>"I can take you folks to a place where you'll be absolutely safe until you
  can get some proper clothes. But, naturally, I don't want you to know where
  it is. Pull down the blind over the front window. If I catch anybody peeping
  I'll put you out in the street just as you are."</p>

  <p>"That's fair enough, Punch," said Mephisto. "I won't let anybody look
  out."</p>

  <p>"I want to go home!" wailed Jackie like a child.</p>

  <p>"Nothing doing, sister," said Mephisto. "We're all in this thing together,
  and we got to stick together."</p>

  <p>So the front curtain was pulled down. It made little difference to me,
  because I had no idea where we were anyhow. But I didn't like Mr. Punch's
  proposition a little bit. It was too smooth to come from an honest man, and
  Mephisto had fallen in with it a little too quickly. I began to feel as if
  they were all crooks together. My anxiety was chiefly on Mme. Storey's
  account. A woman as famous as she is has to be wary. She has many enemies.
  However, as she seemed to accede to it, there was nothing I could do.</p>

  <p>The whole business of trying to escape from the police seemed senseless to
  me, and I could not imagine how Mme. Storey had come to fall for it. You
  can't trifle with murder. But presumably she knew what she was doing. She
  always does.</p>

  <p>The red-clad devil produced a packet of cigarettes and offered them
  around. Only Anne Boleyn helped herself with a cry of thankfulness. "That's
  what I wanted!" She and Mephisto lighted up.</p>

  <p>"Well, the worst appears to be over," said Anne.</p>

  <p>Over? Our troubles are just starting, I thought. But I saw that her object
  was to recommend herself to these people as a good pal, and I kept my mouth
  shut.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Mephisto. "Mr. Punch seems to be a man of resource."</p>

  <p>"Have you any idea who he is?" she asked offhand.</p>

  <p>"Not the slightest. But he must work for very fine people, judging by the
  car."</p>

  <p>Mr. Punch drove for a considerable distance, but from the number of turns
  we made, I judged he was merely trying to confuse our sense of direction.</p>

  <p>Finally we came to a standstill. Opening the front window a crack, Mr.
  Punch said: "Sit still until I give the word."</p>

  <p>I was greatly tempted to peep around one of the blinds, but I noticed that
  Mephisto was watching us narrowly. As it was, Jackie happened to push one
  aside for a moment with a movement of her shoulder, and I got a glimpse
  through the glass of the door. But all I saw was a dark and deserted street
  with lamp-posts at intervals. It was a fashionable quarter of the town, that
  was all I could tell.</p>

  <p>I heard the squeaking of hinges, and afterward the car moved forward for a
  few yards and stopped again. A gate closed behind us, and Mr. Punch opened
  the car door. He had on his mask.</p>

  <p>"Here we are," he said.</p>

  <p>We were in a private garage that had once been a stable. Another handsome
  car lay alongside us, and through an open door we could see the disused
  stalls beyond. Opening a small door, Mr. Punch led us all out into a narrow
  courtyard with the stars overhead and the dark bulk of a great mansion
  looming before us.</p>

  <p>"You will be safe here," he said. "My employers have gone south for the
  winter."</p>

  <p>"How about your licence plates?" asked Abdullah anxiously. "The police in
  the small car certainly got the number."</p>

  <p>"That won't do them any good," answered Mr. Punch with a laugh. "I always
  fasten on false plates when I go out in the evening&mdash;just to be on the
  safe side, you know."</p>

  <p>He unlocked a door into the rear of the house, and switched on lights in
  the passage. I noticed that after we had all passed in, he locked the door
  with a key, and dropped it into his pocket. This did not make me feel any
  easier in my mind. In fact this so-called place of safety scared me more than
  the supper room at the hall, where there had been at least a crowd outside
  within call. The big house was as silent as the grave.</p>

  <p>We crossed a spacious old-fashioned kitchen, and mounted a flight of
  stairs to the main floor. It was a really palatial mansion in the older
  fashion, with an immense central hall running through it, and a suite of
  three superb drawing-rooms on one side.</p>

  <p>Everything had been dismantled in the absence of the family; hangings and
  rugs removed and all furniture and pictures swathed in white dustcloths. I
  noticed that all the windows on the first floor were closely boarded up
  outside, and I suspected that there was no way out except by the basement
  door to which Mr. Punch held the key.</p>

  <p>He led us into the middle drawing-room and turned on a single bulb in a
  wall bracket, which created just a little island of light amid the crowding
  shadows. Queer-shaped objects peeped out of the corners; a shrouded harp, a
  statue on a pedestal with a sheet thrown over it and tied around its
  middle.</p>

  <p>On either side opened a wide archway revealing a yawning pit of blackness
  beyond. To my disordered imagination the ceiling looked a hundred feet high.
  Our motley crew of masqueraders were like a little company of ghosts stealing
  through some long-deserted hall.</p>

  <p>Jackie glanced around her, and fell to shivering. "What did you bring me
  here for?" she whimpered. "I want to go home."</p>

  <p>"I reckon you're all wondering why I brought you here," said Mr. Punch
  suavely, "and you're certainly entitled to know. This is it. It's up to us to
  discover amongst ourselves who shot George Danforth, so that we all won't
  have to suffer for the crime of one."</p>

  <p>George Danforth! The name rang familiarly in my mind. Then suddenly I
  recollected that George Danforth was butler at the Creighton Woodleys' when
  the big jewel robbery took place. So Mme. Storey's caprice in attending the
  butlers' ball was something more than a caprice.</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p class="first">We four women were shown into a dressing-room on the first
  floor of the mansion to tidy up after our strenuous escape from Webster Hall.
  Naturally Mme. Storey and I did not unmask in the presence of the others.
  Those two, masked also, would not approach within a yard of each other.
  Suspicion divided us all. My employer and I lingered in the room until they
  had gone out, so that we could have a word or two together. What a relief it
  was to raise our masks!</p>

  <p>"Are you scared, Bella?" she asked, smiling.</p>

  <p>"You know I am," I answered tartly. "So there's not much use in denying
  it."</p>

  <p>There was a telephone in the room. She took down the receiver and
  listened. "Dead," she told me, hanging up again.</p>

  <p>"Where do you suppose Crider is?" I asked nervously.</p>

  <p>"Heaven knows!" she said. "I couldn't foresee any such outcome as this,
  and he has no instructions to cover it. The poor fellow will be wild with
  anxiety...We may solve our case through this accident," she went on
  thoughtfully, "but it's risky&mdash;it's risky!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, what does a jewel robbery matter beside a murder?" I said,
  shuddering.</p>

  <p>"It's all part of the same thing," she said gravely.</p>

  <p>I stared. "Do you know where we are?" I asked. She shook her head. "I
  thought I knew most of the great houses in New York, but I've never been in
  this one. There can't be many of the type left. It's on Fifth Avenue, I
  should say, and probably it's somewhere in the Sixties. We'll dope it out
  before we leave. Ha!" she cried, suddenly pointing to the telephone
  instrument; "there's our clue! The telephone number is Buckingham
  4-3773."</p>

  <p>"But you can't go through the telephone book looking for that number!" I
  objected.</p>

  <p>"I won't have to," she said, tapping the directory. It had been slipped
  inside an elaborately tooled leather cover which bore a big V on the front.
  "Undoubtedly the family initial," she said.</p>

  <p>The Social Register lay beside the telephone book, and Mme. Storey picked
  up the blue volume as affording a narrower field for her search. Almost
  immediately she said: "I have it! A. A. Vandegrift. I was nearly right. This
  house is on Madison instead of Fifth, and behind St. Patrick's Cathedral. We
  have often passed it!"</p>

  <p>"What does Vandegrift do?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Do?" she said, smiling. "He's a rich man of the third generation. He sits
  in a window of the Union Club during the rare periods when he favours New
  York with his visits and complains that times are not what they were."</p>

  <p>"It's too bad the Social Register doesn't give the butlers' names, too," I
  suggested.</p>

  <p>"I know it now, without that!" she said. "Crider told me that the
  president of the Butlers' Association was the Vandegrifts' butler. His name
  is Alfred Denby. That identifies Mr. Punch. We are making headway, my
  dear."</p>

  <p>"We'd better go out or they'll be getting suspicious," I said,
  nervously.</p>

  <p>"Just one moment! Mr. Punch, I take it, is preparing to hold a sort of
  hearing. I want you to testify against Abdullah."</p>

  <p>"But I don't know anything against him."</p>

  <p>"Then make something up. You'll see why later. And don't mind if I get you
  all tangled up on cross-examination. I don't want them to suspect we're
  working together."</p>

  <p>We adjusted our masks and left the room.</p>

  <p>Mr. Punch had placed a little table for himself under the single light in
  the middle drawing-room. He sat behind it on a sofa with six chairs in linen
  covers ranged in a semi-circle before him. It was certainly the most
  grotesque court ever held&mdash;if you could call it a court: Mr. Punch and
  six mummers. But all the fun had gone out of this mummery. The participants
  were distracted with grief, fear and suspicion.</p>

  <p>He began in his suave and reasonable voice: "Abdullah&mdash;or whatever
  your name may be&mdash;all the evidence seems to point to you as the one who
  shot George Danforth. But we want to give you every chance. Have you got
  anything to say for yourself?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't do it!" cried Abdullah. "I had no gun!"</p>

  <p>"You knew who Danforth was?" Mr. Punch snapped.</p>

  <p>"Sure, I knew," he said sullenly. "Everybody connected with the
  Association knew him."</p>

  <p>"Then you're connected with the Association?"</p>

  <p>No answer.</p>

  <p>"You hated Danforth?"</p>

  <p>"That's no proof," muttered Abdullah. "Plenty of others had it in for him.
  He was a blackguard with women."</p>

  <p>Zuleika snatched off her mask, revealing her passionate gipsy face.
  "That's a lie!" she cried.</p>

  <p>"A lie!" added Jackie with scarcely less violence.</p>

  <p>Now that he was dead, I saw that both these women were getting ready to
  sanctify him. Well, that's the way women are!</p>

  <p>"One minute, ladies," said Mr. Punch smoothly. Turning to Abdullah, he
  said: "If you didn't shoot him, who did?"</p>

  <p>"The gun was fired beside me," said Abdullah. He leaned forward and looked
  at Zuleika. "I believe she did it!"</p>

  <p>"He's lying, and he knows he's lying!" cried Zuleika, jumping up.</p>

  <p>"No doubt," said Mr. Punch suavely, "but can you prove it?"</p>

  <p>She glared around at us as if we were all her enemies. "Yes, I can," she
  said. "I'm a good shot with a pistol, and I don't care who knows it. But if
  it had been me I would have had to shoot on the level with my eyes. It's the
  only way I can shoot. And this gun was fired low down. As if it was resting
  on the edge of the table!" The woman was suddenly overcome by a hard dry
  sobbing. She covered her face with her hands and ran into the dark room
  adjoining.</p>

  <p>"Can anybody confirm that?" demanded Mr. Punch. "You, Jackie, you were
  immediately across the table from the gun."</p>

  <p>"She's right," said Jackie, sniffing. "The shot came from low down."</p>

  <p>"What can you say, Lorenzo?" he said to me. "Did you see the flash?"</p>

  <p>I shook my head. "Only the reflection. The flash was hidden behind the
  bank of flowers. The pistol was fired from the edge of the table, right there
  at Abdullah's place."</p>

  <p>Mr. Punch rubbed his hands in satisfaction. "That seems to be conclusive
  then. That lets Zuleika out. Either Abdullah fired the shot, or it was
  somebody who came between him and Zuleika. That could only have been you,
  Anne Boleyn."</p>

  <p>"Mercy! I didn't shoot Mr. Danforth," she said with pretended nervousness.
  "Why, I scarcely knew him!"</p>

  <p>He pounced on this admission. "Then you did know him?"</p>

  <p>"I only met him once before tonight," she said. "It was at a cabaret in
  Harlem. It was then that he gave me a ticket to the ball tonight, and asked
  me to meet him there."</p>

  <p>"Will you unmask, miss, so we can all see your face?" he asked
  suddenly.</p>

  <p>My heart skipped a beat, for of course Mme. Storey's photograph has been
  published repeatedly. Everybody knows her face. But she was equal to the
  situation.</p>

  <p>"I won't be the only one to show my face," she said, drawing back. "I'll
  take off my mask if you will."</p>

  <p>He dropped the subject. "Can you prove to us," he said, "that you could
  not have fired the shot?"</p>

  <p>"What do you expect me to say?" she answered with an innocent air. "If
  those were my two guns I would not have produced the second one, would I? I
  would not have shown you that they were of the same make."</p>

  <p>"Of course, of course," said Mr. Punch suavely. "It stands to reason you
  didn't do it."</p>

  <p>He next turned his attention to me. "Who brought you to the ball?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>Instantly I had to find a plausible answer. It came without thinking. "Mr.
  Smith," I said.</p>

  <p>"What Mr. Smith? Where does he work?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," I said. "I only met him on his evenings off. He brought me
  to the ball."</p>

  <p>"How was he dressed?"</p>

  <p>"As Pierrot. There were so many of them I lost him. I didn't care."</p>

  <p>"Will you unmask for us?"</p>

  <p>Now my face is unknown to fame, and it occurred to me that I would inspire
  these people with confidence if I obeyed. So I lifted my mask for a moment
  and let it snap back. I saw the corners of my employer's mouth twitch. She
  approved of what I had done. And Mr. Punch was satisfied.</p>

  <p>"What can you tell us about this business?" he asked.</p>

  <p>It was clear to me by this time that he was only interested in getting
  evidence against Abdullah, and I tried to play up to him.</p>

  <p>"Well, I could see that Abdullah was sore against Harlequin," I said. "He
  was watching him all the time."</p>

  <p>"We know that already," said Mr. Punch. "What else?"</p>

  <p>"Well, just before the lights went out I saw him lift the cloth and look
  under the table."</p>

  <p>"Good!" cried Mr. Punch. "He wanted to see how to disconnect the lights.
  Will you tell this to the police?"</p>

  <p>I nodded.</p>

  <p>"Aw, you're all against me!" cried Abdullah despairingly, and my
  conscience reproached me. But I was only following instructions.</p>

  <p>Mr. Punch turned to Mephisto. "Can you add anything?" he asked. He never
  asked Mephisto to unmask, and so I judged he already knew him.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Mephisto with an air of seeming reluctance, "when the two of
  them were fighting I saw Abdullah pull the gun. He dropped it on the floor
  when they were separated."</p>

  <p>"You lie!" cried Abdullah. "You're swearing my life away! If you saw this
  why didn't you say so before?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't want to make trouble," said Mephisto deprecatingly. "I always
  want to avoid trouble. In the heat of passion any man is likely to do
  something he regrets afterward. As long as the gun was unloaded I thought it
  was all right. Never occurred to me you would be carrying two guns."</p>

  <p>"I didn't even have one gun!" cried Abdullah.</p>

  <p>Nobody paid any attention to what he said.</p>

  <p>"Now we're beginning to clear this thing up," said Mr. Punch in great
  satisfaction. "We'd all be better off if you had taken my advice and seen it
  through on the spot. Will you swear to what you have said before the police,
  Mephisto?"</p>

  <p>"If I must, I must," said the big man, spreading out his hands. "Though I
  don't wish the poor fellow any harm."</p>

  <p>By this time Zuleika had returned to the room and seated herself as far as
  possible away from Jackie.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Danforth," said Mr. Punch, "will you swear that you knocked against
  the gun in this man's pocket when you seated yourself at the table?"</p>

  <p>"Sure!" she said with a poisonous glance at Abdullah.</p>

  <p>By this time the concerted plan to railroad the unfortunate fellow,
  whether innocent or guilty, was becoming almost more than I could stand in
  silence. I glanced anxiously at my employer, wondering when she was going to
  take action.</p>

  <p>Mr. Punch was not yet through with him. "Jackie," he said to the girl,
  "you were directly across the table when the shot was fired. You ought to be
  able to tell us more about it."</p>

  <p>Abdullah sprang up and approached the girl. "Kitty, for God's sake, don't
  join in this!" he cried brokenly. "You know me, Kitty. You used to be fond of
  me. Have you forgotten all that?"</p>

  <p>"Don't touch me!" she cried, shrinking from him. "You are not worthy to
  tie his laces!"</p>

  <p>"Sit down!" shouted Mr. Punch, pounding the table. The broken Abdullah
  dropped in his seat. "Then you know who he is," he continued to Jackie.</p>

  <p>"Sure," she said sullenly. "I knew him as soon as he knew me. It's Frank
  Harris!"</p>

  <p>Leaping up again, Abdullah tore off his mask and cast it on the floor.
  "Look your fill at me!" he cried recklessly. "Yes, I'm Frank Harris! What
  have I done to any of you that you're all trying to send me to the
  chair?"</p>

  <p>Again we had that dramatic shock when another of the masked faces was
  suddenly revealed. Under stress of his feelings the man's face was scarcely
  human. But he looked like an ordinary, honest sort of fellow. You couldn't
  help but pity him.</p>

  <p>"A member of the Executive Committee!" exclaimed Mr. Punch in a
  scandalised voice. The air was full of hypocrisy.</p>

  <p>Jackie had no mercy on the poor wretch. These delicate girls can be as
  cruel as Satan when their feelings are aroused. "I'll tell you something more
  about him!" she cried stridently. "When he says he never handled a gun he
  lies! For six months past every hour he could get he's been practising with a
  pistol in a gallery on Fourteenth Street. He's a dead shot!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Punch smiled cruelly between the false nose and chin. "I guess we've
  heard enough," he said. "Let's take him to the police."</p>

  <h3>V</h3>

  <p class="first">At last Mme. Storey spoke up&mdash;but she seemed to have no
  more mercy for the snivelling Abdullah-Harris than the rest of them. "You'd
  better make him come clean first," she suggested. "If he's going to deny
  everything the police will hold us all."</p>

  <p>A general murmur of assent went around.</p>

  <p>"I won't confess!" shouted Harris. "You can all be damned! Take me to the
  police! I'd sooner face them than a set of vultures like you!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Punch tried in vain to browbeat the man into making a confession, but
  Harris only cried and cursed and turned stubborn. Finally Anne Boleyn said
  smoothly:</p>

  <p>"Let me see what I can get out of him."</p>

  <p>With a shrug, Mr. Punch moved over on the little sofa, and she sat on the
  other end, making two judges instead of one. She lit a cigarette and
  deliberated between every question she asked, blowing the smoke in the
  air.</p>

  <p>"Harris, you're taking the wrong line altogether," she began smoothly. "If
  Danforth was a blackguard, as you say, let that be your defence. If you can
  prove it, no jury would convict you."</p>

  <p>Harris calmed down, and scowled at her suspiciously. He didn't know how to
  take this. On the other hand Mrs. Danforth was angered by it.</p>

  <p>However, Anne Boleyn smiled at her as much as to say, "I'm only trying to
  entrap the man," and the other woman subsided.</p>

  <p>"Harris," said Anne Boleyn, "you knew George Danforth tonight even before
  he raised his mask. I was watching you."</p>

  <p>"Well, what of it?" he grumbled.</p>

  <p>"How did you know him?"</p>

  <p>Harris twisted in his chair. "If you must know, Mr. Denby, our president,
  told me Danforth was going to wear a Harlequin outfit. With that lead I
  recognised him from his figure."</p>

  <p>Mr. Punch's make-up hid his face well, but I could imagine that this
  disclosure made him uneasy. His whole poise towards my employer betrayed
  it.</p>

  <p>"Was Mr. Denby aware that you were sore at Danforth?" asked Anne
  Boleyn.</p>

  <p>"Sure," said Harris. "I told him how he had taken my girl, and he said he
  was a blackguard. Mr. Denby's a good friend of mine. He wouldn't let you
  hound me like this if he was here."</p>

  <p>"If Danforth was a blackguard why wasn't he fired from the
  Association?"</p>

  <p>"President Denby didn't want to do it," said Harris. "He thought it would
  make too much talk."</p>

  <p>"And what did Danforth say?"</p>

  <p>"Danforth went around bragging that they couldn't fire him out because he
  had too much on Denby."</p>

  <p>"What did he mean by that?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I didn't pay no attention. Danforth was a crook."</p>

  <p>"Where has Danforth been working since he left the Creighton
  Woodleys?"</p>

  <p>"Hasn't been working anywhere. Just swelling around. He said the
  Association would have to support him as long as he lived."</p>

  <p>"But Mr. Danforth took me home in a high-powered car that time," said Anne
  Boleyn. "He wore diamonds. He gave suppers to the ladies. Was the Association
  paying for all that?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't believe they were," said Harris. "Danforth was a crook."</p>

  <p>"But don't you know?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Harris sullenly. "That's up to the treasurer, Mr. Ebbitt."</p>

  <p>"But you're a member of the Executive Committee."</p>

  <p>"We left everything to Denby and Ebbitt. Those two are the strong men of
  the Association. They have a powerful hold on the members."</p>

  <p>"What gave them such a powerful hold?" asked Anne Boleyn softly.</p>

  <p>"Well, during their term of office they have added a hundred thousand
  dollars to our benefit fund. And fifty thousand to the Women's Auxiliary.
  They are fine men."</p>

  <p>"Where did they get it all?"</p>

  <p>"From investments. Mr. Ebbitt, the treasurer, takes the dues and invests
  the money in Wall Street and cleans up. He then hands the money to me for the
  benefit fund. I run that," Harris said, with a pitiful sort of pride.</p>

  <p>"Has the treasurer ever made a report to the Association?"</p>

  <p>"Nobody wants a report as long as the money's coming in."</p>

  <p>"When did he last pay in something to the fund?"</p>

  <p>"Six weeks ago. Ten thousand. But he took that back again."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Said he saw a chance to double it on the Street."</p>

  <p>"Six weeks ago? Wasn't that just the time when Danforth came out with his
  big car and his diamonds?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;yes," muttered Harris dubiously.</p>

  <p>I could well believe that this line of testimony was making Mr. Punch
  sweat, but he couldn't say anything without showing his hand. However,
  Mephisto interfered.</p>

  <p>"What's all this got to do with Harris's shooting Danforth?" he protested.
  "You ain't getting anywhere, miss."</p>

  <p>"I'm trying to prove that Danforth was an out-and-out scoundrel," she said
  sweetly. "If I can show Harris that he has a first-rate defence, he'll
  confess and we can all go home."</p>

  <p>Mephisto was obliged to make believe he was satisfied, but I doubted
  it.</p>

  <p>"Danforth was a scoundrel all right," muttered Harris.</p>

  <p>"But I'll never confess!"</p>

  <p>Anne Boleyn took a new line. "Where did you get that costume?"</p>

  <p>"What's that got to do with it?" he answered sullenly. "I've nothing to
  conceal. I hired it at Steele Bros., costumiers."</p>

  <p>"Who sent you to them?"</p>

  <p>"President Denby. He told me he seen this Turkish costume there just my
  size, and I went and got it."</p>

  <p>"How was President Denby masked tonight?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. Nobody knew. He said he could have more fun if they didn't
  recognise him for the president."</p>

  <p>"And treasurer Ebbitt?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know that neither. He's a serious-minded man. Maybe he didn't
  come to the ball."</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey then resumed her original line of questioning. "When did
  President Denby and Danforth first quarrel?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Just about that time," said Harris. "Six weeks ago."</p>

  <p>"This would be just after Danforth had been cleared by the police of
  complicity in the Creighton Woodley robbery."</p>

  <p>"Yeah. Mr. Denby wasn't on to him then. He wanted to show his confidence
  in Danforth and he offered to put him in on the Executive Committee. But
  Danforth refused, and there was trouble."</p>

  <p>"Did you overhear their quarrel?"</p>

  <p>"Well, they were in the private office with the door closed and I was
  outside," said Harris. "I just heard a word or two."</p>

  <p>"What was it?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I heard Danforth shout out: 'When I gave you the layout I thought
  it was only talk! You tricked me!' I didn't pay no attention. I knew Danforth
  was crooked."</p>

  <p>"What else?"</p>

  <p>"Later Danforth hollered: 'I was an honest man until this happened! You
  made a crook out of me!' That's a laugh, all right. Mr. Denby making a crook
  out of that rat!"</p>

  <p>"Did you tell Mr. Denby what you overheard?"</p>

  <p>"No, I made out I didn't hear nothing just to save trouble."</p>

  <p>"Did you hear anything else?"</p>

  <p>"The last thing Danforth said was: 'I got hold of the receipt you gave
  Tony Yellow for the money. Never mind how. I got it!' And with that he came
  bursting out of the private office&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mr. Punch could stand no more. He sprang up, trembling with rage.</p>

  <p>"You lie!" he cried.</p>

  <p>"Liar yourself," retorted Harris. "If Mr. Denby was here, he'd bear me
  out! He's a good friend of mine."</p>

  <p>"This is Mr. Denby," said Anne Boleyn. "Let him speak for himself."</p>

  <p>Now, Mr. Punch was a quick-witted man, and he realised if he delayed an
  instant in taking up her challenge he would only come off worse in the end.
  He snatched off his mask.</p>

  <p>"Sure I'm Denby," he cried to Harris. "And I was a good friend of yours,
  Frank. But you can't save yourself from this murder by a tissue of lies!"</p>

  <p>The false nose and chin still grotesquely obscured his real features, but
  they all knew him now. A murmur of amazement went around. Poor Harris gaped
  at him like a clown. The man's instinct warned him he had been tricked, but
  his wits were not sharp enough to work it out.</p>

  <p>Mr. Punch then turned furiously on my employer. "Who is this woman that's
  so keen about our private affairs?" he cried. "Take off your mask, miss, and
  let's have a look at you!"</p>

  <p>She coolly lifted it, and faced him out with a dry smile. Mr. Punch went
  staggering back.</p>

  <p>"Rosika Storey!" he gasped. "Oh, my God! The detective!"</p>

  <p>For a moment there was complete silence in the room. Mme. Storey's beauty
  and her contemptuous assurance laid a spell on them. In her superb black gown
  she looked the queen. They stared at her open-mouthed. Nobody moved.</p>

  <p>Then Mr. Punch began to recover himself. A dark flush spread underneath
  his make-up. He smiled grimly.</p>

  <p>"Do you realise what this means?" he said to the others. "This woman is
  out to smash our organisation. She cares nothing about the murder. She's
  after our benefit funds. Well, you're all members. Going to stand for
  it?"</p>

  <p>"No! No!" they cried. It was strange to see how they instantly drew
  together when their money was threatened. Danforth's wife and his mistress
  forgot their jealousy; even Frank Harris, the poor fool they were trying to
  railroad to the chair, joined in with them. He was one of those morons who
  can conceive of nothing higher than a blind loyalty to the organisation.
  Mephisto obviously was hand in glove with Mr. Punch now as he had been
  throughout.</p>

  <p>They all began to shout together: "She did it! She did it! She shot
  Danforth. I saw her do it, I'll swear to it!"</p>

  <p>Harris put in: "She come between me and Zuleika and fired at him crouching
  down. I felt her there. I smelled her perfume. I'll swear to it!"</p>

  <p>It was like an infernal chorus.</p>

  <p>"We'll all swear to it! She can't get off!"</p>

  <p>Which shows how much dependence you can place on human testimony!</p>

  <p>Mr. Punch, however, had more sense.</p>

  <p>"Quiet, you fools!" he shouted with an angry gesture. "You couldn't touch
  her. She has too much prestige. She's too clever for you. She'd go on the
  stand and make monkeys of you all. Besides, there's this other strange woman.
  They're in together. They would support each other on the stand."</p>

  <p>Mephisto furiously shook his fist at us. "These spies shan't wreck our
  organisation!" he cried.</p>

  <p>"Sure!" agreed Mr. Punch cunningly. "The money is rolling in without the
  slightest risk to us, and we want to enjoy it! If we stick together we five
  can make a little central finance committee."</p>

  <p>This appealed to their cupidity.</p>

  <p>"What will we do with them?" cried Mephisto.</p>

  <p>All faces were unmasked now except for Mephisto's grinning headpiece.</p>

  <p>"Well," began Mr. Punch. He paused, and that hideous smile spread between
  hooked nose and chin. "She's a clever woman, but she and her fellow spy are
  only mortal...And this is a nice quiet house!"</p>

  <p>The two women cried out a little. They were willing to swear our lives
  away, but outright murder scared them. As for me, all the blood in my veins
  turned to water. I moved closer to Mme. Storey. She was smiling scornfully.
  The black pit of the front drawing-room yawned at our backs.</p>

  <p>"Leave this to me," Mr. Punch said to the women. "I'll take the
  responsibility. All you've got to do is to stand by me afterward. There's a
  grand cellar under this house," he went on, smiling. "And the family won't be
  back for three months."</p>

  <p>Mephisto drew the gun he had kept all this time and coolly reloaded
  it.</p>

  <p>"Put it up!" said Mr. Punch sharply. "We'll do this quietly."</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey affected to laugh with quiet amusement.</p>

  <p>"Look in the back room," she said.</p>

  <p>All five heads turned as one. She touched my hand, and we melted
  noiselessly into the darkness behind us.</p>

  <h3>VI</h3>

  <p class="first">We had only one second's respite, of course. They discovered
  they had been tricked, and Mr. Punch yelled: "Watch the basement stairs! It's
  the only way out! Come on, Ebbitt!"</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey seized my hand, and we headed diagonally across the front
  drawing-room for the main hall. As we reached it, our pursuers came tumbling
  out of the middle room. The grand stairway was immediately before us, and we
  sprang up. There was no other place to go. Terror lent wings to my heels. I
  never ran so fast in my life.</p>

  <p>As Mr. Punch came through the lower hall, he paused to press some
  switches, and the whole central well of the house became flooded with light.
  Punch and Mephisto leaped up the stairs after us.</p>

  <p>We opened the first door we came to, ran in, slammed it, and shot a bolt.
  Almost immediately the two men flung themselves against the other side. This
  was one of the principal bedrooms of the house.</p>

  <p>Immediately it was only too apparent to us that the windows were boarded
  up like those below, and we could neither escape that way nor summon help. We
  had only run from one trap into another.</p>

  <p>We heard the men run along the hall outside, and immediately guessed there
  was a way into our room from the front. I was for trying to find the
  communicating door, but she prevented me.</p>

  <p>"Must get out of this," she muttered.</p>

  <p>She softly drew the bolt, and we stole out into the stair hall again.
  Frank Harris and the two women were watching at the foot of the stairs. All
  three of them were infected with the blood lust now.</p>

  <p>The third floor of the house was all cut up into a maze of small rooms and
  passages in which we lost ourselves hopelessly. In the dark it was impossible
  to figure out the plan. We could no longer hear our pursuers&mdash;crouching
  in wait at some strategic corner, we supposed. It was agonising not to
  know.</p>

  <p>"There must be back stairs," whispered Mme. Storey. "Look for them."</p>

  <p>In slowly feeling our way along the wall of a passage, I leave you to
  imagine my feelings when my groping fingers suddenly touched fingers
  exploring from the other direction.</p>

  <p>I screamed like a madwoman. Luckily the man was scarcely less startled
  than I. Mme. Storey and I dashed away down the passage, collided with the
  wall at the end, crossed some sort of open space, and hid ourselves in
  another passage before we dared draw breath.</p>

  <p>"We are in the front of the house now," she whispered. "We must find the
  back stairs."</p>

  <p>Finally the suspense became unsupportable. Having crept back to the
  beginning of the passage, we peeped around the corner. There they crouched
  waiting, Punch and the Devil, the latter still masked.</p>

  <p>They sprang at us and we fled back through the passage. We were quicker
  than they. There was a door around the corner, and we got it closed and
  bolted behind us as they flung themselves against it. I heard Punch roar with
  laughter.</p>

  <p>"We've got them now!" he yelled.</p>

  <p>We were in a small bedroom, evidently a servant's room, with a window
  opening on the air shaft. Through the skylight at the top of the shaft we saw
  that day was breaking. I heard Punch say: "Drive your foot through a panel of
  the door!"</p>

  <p>A tiny room opening on a shaft and those fiends outside! Our position
  seemed absolutely desperate and I'm afraid I began to cry. Mme. Storey's face
  was sternly composed.</p>

  <p>The door held for a brief while against Mephisto's furious blows, and Mme.
  Storey still had a trick up her sleeve. There was the window of another room
  cater-cornered across the air shaft, and while I steadied her she leaned far
  out of our window and got it opened. We then with considerable difficulty
  crossed over from sill to sill. I never could have made it had not the Devil
  been at my heels.</p>

  <p>The room we entered was evidently lived in, and I gasped with relief to
  see that it had two unshuttered windows opening on the blessed outer air! But
  first we had to barricade the way we had come. With immense exertions we
  managed to shove a heavy wardrobe in front of the window on the shaft. This
  offered a formidable obstacle to anybody on the insecure perch of the window
  sill, and we did not believe they could follow that way. There was still the
  door of the room, of course. We discovered that it was locked, and no key in
  it.</p>

  <p>When we had time to look about us we saw a man's personal belongings
  scattered about; clothes, shoes, knick-knacks on the dresser. On the wall was
  a framed photograph of an Association picnic.</p>

  <p>"Ah," said Mme. Storey dryly. "Mr. Punch's own room!"</p>

  <p>There was a ball of string lying on the bureau that she pounced on with
  the light of triumph in her eye. "If we get out alive we'll hang him with
  this!" she cried, and thrust the ball in the pocket of her skirt.</p>

  <p>I could make nothing of this at the moment. A sudden thought had caused my
  heart to sink like a stone.</p>

  <p>"If it's his room he has the key in his pocket!" I gasped.</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey's eyes flashed around the room, searching. She snatched up a
  stick-pin from the bureau, stuck it diagonally in the lock, then hammered it
  with a boot so that it crumpled up inside the lock and the head broke
  off.</p>

  <p>"He won't get a key in there in a hurry," she remarked.</p>

  <p>By this time the two men had broken into the little room on the shaft.
  They must have been astonished when they found it empty. But when they saw
  the wardrobe backed up against the other window on the shaft they knew where
  we had gone.</p>

  <p>"They're in my room!" yelled Mr. Punch. "Come on!"</p>

  <p>A moment later he was trying to insert his key in the lock. Failing in
  that, they kicked the panels. Fortunately those were stout doors. "Wait a
  minute!" said Punch. "Fetch the fire axe from the head of the stairs."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Mme. Storey and I were busy shoving the bureau in front of the
  door, and the bed against the bureau to give them plenty to chop through.
  Then we ran to an outer window.</p>

  <p>It was half day and the city lay in a curious stillness under the cool
  sky. Madison Avenue ran under the window, and across the way we could see the
  apse of St. Patrick's between the priests' residences flanking it on either
  side. The street lights were still burning and the early cats were coming out
  to sniff in the gutters. The only human in sight was an honest policeman
  leaning against a fire box on the corner, idly swinging his club on its
  thong. As I was about to yell, Mme. Storey clapped a hand over my mouth.</p>

  <p>"If we raise an alarm they'll escape us!" she cried.</p>

  <p>She picked up a hairbrush, and leaning out the window tapped it against
  the wall of the house. It made only a little sound, but in the stillness of
  early morning it was sufficient. The policeman looked up and saw us. What a
  strange shock he must have received, seeing Anne Boleyn and Lorenzo hanging
  out of the top window of an apparently shut-up house at dawn! One can imagine
  the eyes fairly starting from his head. Mme. Storey gave him the most
  dramatic pantomime of distress and terror, wringing her hands and alternately
  pointing inside the house and towards the fire box. All the time she was
  murmuring to me:</p>

  <p>"That ought to fetch him! That ought to fetch him!"</p>

  <p>I don't know what he thought, but there was obviously only one thing for
  him to do. He yanked open the door of the fire alarm box, and pulled the hook
  inside. He then ran down the side street to try to get in the building from
  the rear.</p>

  <p>For a moment or two there was silence in the room. I was desperately
  trying to figure how long it took firemen to reach a fire. The beating of my
  heart almost suffocated me. The silence must have alarmed Mr. Punch outside,
  for he vigorously rattled the door and called out:</p>

  <p>"You, in there!"</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey winked at me and answered in a trembling voice: "Oh, spare us!
  Spare us!" I wondered how she could joke at such a moment.</p>

  <p>Mephisto arrived with the axe and they tackled the door. It proved to be a
  tough job, because the passage was too narrow to swing the axe
  effectively.</p>

  <p>Almost immediately I heard the distant clang of the engines, and then I
  saw the wisdom of Mme. Storey's ruse. The men with the axe were making too
  much noise themselves to hear the engines. Even if they did hear they
  wouldn't connect it with us. After all, it's a common enough sound in the
  city. Mr. Punch had fairly to hew the door in pieces before he could get
  sufficient leverage to push the furniture out of the way.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Mme. Storey and I were hanging out of the windows. When the fire
  trucks swept up below we stretched out our arms to the men just like all the
  pictures of distressed females we had seen. They swung the big hook and
  ladder truck around with marvellous skill, and started the machinery going,
  and the great ladder raised up and extended itself until it dropped with a
  light tap against our window sill. They had judged it to a hair. Then the men
  came scrambling up like monkeys.</p>

  <p>Firemen are such handsome, well-built fellows, and so modest! Everybody
  loves the firemen, because they don't interfere with us as the police
  do&mdash;they only save our lives!</p>

  <p>The firemen were in the act of scrambling over the sill at the precise
  moment when our two enemies, having succeeded in shoving the bureau a foot or
  two from the door, appeared from behind it. The surprise was mutual. Seeing
  the grotesque figure of Mr. Punch, axe in hand, and Mephisto, horns and tail,
  the firemen may well have thought they were in a madhouse.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter here?" stammered the leader.</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey, with a twinkle in her eye, said courteously: "I'm sorry,
  chief, there's no fire. But these gentlemen were bent on murdering us."</p>

  <p>Mr. Punch and Mephisto turned to run, but the firemen leaped on their
  backs and quickly secured them. Such grand fellows! I disgraced myself by
  going into hysterics when it was over.</p>

  <h3>VII</h3>

  <p class="first">The next scene took place at Police Headquarters. Of course
  a general alarm had been sent out for our party and the police had been
  combing the town for us all night. So we were rushed direct to Headquarters.
  I doubt if the building had ever witnessed a more bizarre scene than the
  seven of us in fancy dress lined up before the lieutenant at the desk.
  Ebbitt, the fat treasurer of the Butlers' Association, now carried Mephisto's
  grinning headpiece under one arm, while his spiked tail dragged forlornly on
  the ground. Ebbitt had just such a smooth and flabby face as you might expect
  in the butler who deferentially fills your glass.</p>

  <p>At first we were all treated as malefactors alike. When Mme. Storey
  explained who she was the lieutenant received it with an air of incredulity
  that was far from polite. In fact he jeered. Whereupon she insisted on having
  our friend Inspector Rumsey sent for. After he got there all was clear
  sailing.</p>

  <p>I cannot end my story better than by giving you my employer's statement to
  the police.</p>

  <p>"In the course of my investigation of the Creighton Woodley jewel
  robbery," she said, "certain facts turned up which suggested to me that there
  was a very profitable racket being worked by an inner ring of the Butlers'
  Association in connection with expert jewel thieves. But it was difficult to
  secure evidence.</p>

  <p>"The annual masked ball of the Butlers' Association to-night gave me an
  opportunity of mixing with these people in disguise, so I attended the ball
  and took with me my secretary, Miss Brickley. I also had an operative mixing
  with the dancers, but we became separated from him.</p>

  <p>"As it drew on towards midnight my secretary and I were invited to join a
  supper party in a private room given by Mr. Punch here. I accepted because I
  suspected from his air of authority that he was an important man in the
  Association. Later I discovered that he was none other than Alfred Denby, the
  president, and the man I was most anxious to watch. The gentleman in red,
  yonder, is Ebbitt, the treasurer of the Association.</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately I had no knowledge beforehand that there was trouble within
  the Association itself, or I could have taken steps to prevent the murder at
  the supper table. The murdered man, as you may know, is George Danforth, who
  was butler to the Creighton Woodleys at the time of the robbery, and, of
  course, a member of the Association. I am prepared to offer proof of every
  statement I am going to make to you. All this evidence turned up after the
  murder.</p>

  <p>"Danforth was a handsome, pleasure-loving man, very popular among the
  ladies. Technically he was an honest man, and they tricked him into giving
  the layout of his master's house, and the information that enabled a
  successful robbery to be carried out. Danforth, you remember, was called away
  on the night of the robbery, and had therefore a perfect alibi.</p>

  <p>"But he knew then, of course, that he had been tricked. Honesty is all a
  matter of degree. If he had been absolutely honest he would have taken his
  story to the police. But he saw a way of supporting himself in luxurious
  idleness and he fell for it. They offered to admit Danforth to the inner
  ring, but he refused, and he proceeded to blackmail the Butlers' Association
  out of large sums of money.</p>

  <p>"The Creighton Woodley robbery was actually committed by Antonio
  Pagliariello, more commonly known as Tony Yellow. He is no stranger to you.
  Alfred Denby gave Tony a receipt for the money turned over to the Butlers'
  Association as their share of the loot, and in some manner this receipt came
  into Danforth's hands. Probably Tony double-crossed the Association and gave
  the paper to Danforth. It would be like him. This paper constituted
  Danforth's hold over the Association. It will undoubtedly be found among the
  dead man's effects." Mme. Storey paused, with a slight smile at the police
  officials' surprise.</p>

  <p>"The inner ring," she went on, "resolved to put Danforth out of the way.
  They planned to use this man here, Frank Harris by name, as their instrument,
  but when they were unable to fan Harris's hatred of Danforth up to the
  killing point, Denby, the president, made up his mind to kill Danforth
  himself and fasten the murder on Harris. The inner ring had nothing against
  Harris, who was a loyal member of the organisation, though not a party to the
  crookedness of the inner ring. Harris was a stupid sort of fellow, they
  figured, who would never see through the plot.</p>

  <p>"The supper party tonight was staged for the murder. Mr. Punch there, or
  Denby, made sure of his men, Danforth, Harris, and Ebbitt&mdash;he had
  previous knowledge of the costumes they were going to wear; but apparently he
  picked up some of the women at random. So cunningly thought out was his plan
  that he wished to have strangers present to give disinterested testimony
  later. That is how my secretary and I happened to be included in the dinner
  party.</p>

  <p>"A quarrel between Harris and Danforth lent the whole thing realism. At
  the proper moment, when Mr. Punch was on his feet making a speech, the lights
  went out and the shot was fired. When the lights were turned on again the
  smoking revolver lay in front of Harris.</p>

  <p>"But Harris had not fired the shot, gentlemen. Mr. Punch had prepared a
  simple and ingenious scheme for disconnecting the lights under the table. He
  tied a string to the plug in such a manner, leaving two ends, that when he
  pulled one end it disconnected the lights, and when he pulled the other it
  loosened the string and he could gather it all in his hand, thus removing the
  evidence. When the lights went out he knelt on the floor between Mrs.
  Danforth and Harris, and fired. He dropped the gun on the table in front of
  Harris, and a second later he was turning on the switch by the door.</p>

  <p>"In the confusion following upon the murder there was a general desire to
  escape. Mr. Punch, confident in the cleverness of his plot, was dead against
  it. He insisted on facing the thing out. But a few minutes later, when I had
  shown up the trick of substituting the guns, he became suspicious of me and
  encouraged a general flight from the scene. I was afraid he would
  escape&mdash;at that moment I hadn't yet discovered his identity, or that he
  would destroy valuable evidence; I had to act on the instant and so I made
  believe to run with them.</p>

  <p>"He carried us to the house of his employers which has been shut up for
  months, an ideal base of operations for Mr. Punch. When he discovered who I
  was, he determined to put me out of the way. That's the whole story,
  gentlemen.</p>

  <p>"Now, as to my evidence: When the shot was fired, like nearly everybody
  else present, I slid under the table. I took the opportunity of doing a
  little searching under there. By that time Mr. Punch had pulled away the
  string, of course, but I found, driven into the bottom of the table, the
  little staples by which he had led the two ends of the string to his right
  hand and to his left. They are still there, mute evidence of Mr. Punch's
  crime.</p>

  <p>"I knew then what had happened, but it would not have been sufficient
  evidence to take into court, and I was obliged to search farther. When he
  went to the window of the supper room to try to prevent the others from
  leaving, I saw him drop something out, and later when we all left, I found
  the length of string entangled in the fire escape. Here it is, gentlemen.</p>

  <p>"Still, a piece of string is only a piece of string, and I felt that I had
  not enough yet. My third find clinched the whole matter. On the bureau of Mr.
  Punch's own room, I picked up this ball of string. The same kind of string as
  the piece I just handed you. A brand new ball, you see, shows no dust nor
  marks of handling. Only one piece has been cut from it. String of this kind
  is made up into balls of one hundred and fifty yards. You can verify that
  from the makers. If you unwind this ball you will discover that it makes
  exactly one hundred and fifty yards, <i>when joined with the piece I first
  handed you</i>. That's all."</p>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">I disliked the man's voice even before I took in the sense
  of what he was saying; a slow voice that seemed to dwell with pleasure on its
  own malice. He said over the wire:</p>

  <p>"Is Madame Storey there?"</p>

  <p>"Who is this speaking?"</p>

  <p>He laughed sarcastically. "Oh, I haven't the pleasure of her
  acquaintance."</p>

  <p>"What do you want to speak to her about?"</p>

  <p>"That I can only tell her."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm sorry," I said, "but I am instructed not to disturb her unless
  I know it is for a good reason."</p>

  <p>"To whom am I speaking?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Miss Brickley, Madame Storey's secretary."</p>

  <p>"I have heard of the admirable Miss Brickley," he said with his insulting
  laugh. "I feel quite safe in sending her my message by you."</p>

  <p>Then he paused, and I said: "Well?"</p>

  <p>I could hear his breathing over the wire. He must have had his lips almost
  directly against the transmitter. "I have a communication to make in which
  Madame Storey is sure to take a keen professional interest," he drawled.
  "There is going to be a murder committed at number &mdash; East 75th Street
  this morning."</p>

  <p>"What!" I gasped.</p>

  <p>He laughed, well pleased with the effect of his words.</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute," I stammered. "I'll connect you with Madame Storey."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you can tell her," he said, and hung up, still laughing.</p>

  <p>It gave me a nasty shock. My hand was trembling violently when I put up
  the receiver. Common sense suggested that it was only a hoax, but the ugly
  voice out of the unknown acted powerfully on my nerves.</p>

  <p>Going into her office, I found her sitting at the big table writing a
  personal letter. She had a cigarette between her lips and was holding her
  head on one side in the familiar way to keep the smoke out of her eyes. At
  sight of my face she removed the cigarette and smiled provokingly. She is
  always amused by my agitations.</p>

  <p>"Well, what is it now?" she asked.</p>

  <p>I told her.</p>

  <p>"Damn the telephone!" she said pleasantly. "It puts us at the mercy of
  every lunatic in the five boroughs."</p>

  <p>"It's certainly a hoax," I said.</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly. Just the same, we dare not ignore it."</p>

  <p>"After all, it's a matter for the police to attend to."</p>

  <p>"Quite," she said, taking up her pen again. "Call up Rumsey and pass the
  buck to him."</p>

  <p>While I was waiting for my call a sudden exclamation escaped from my
  employer. "What number did you say?"</p>

  <p>"&mdash; East 75th Street."</p>

  <p>"Good Lord! that's Mrs. George P. Julian's new house. I suppose I'll have
  to go there anyway."</p>

  <p>I groaned in sympathy, for I had had ample experience of that lady's
  foolishness in the past.</p>

  <p>When I got Inspector Rumsey on the wire, I handed over the instrument, and
  Mme. Storey told him what had happened. He evidently asked for further
  particulars about Mrs. Julian, for she went on to say:</p>

  <p>"She's a widow with twenty million dollars, and she's almost the perfect
  fool. Need I say more? A sugar-bowl for every new fakir who sets up shop.
  I've already got her out of several scrapes, and that's why, God help me! I
  am elected to be her friend. Her principal is tied up in a trust fund, but
  she has over a million a year income, and that's the honey that attracts the
  bees."</p>

  <p>He asked her about her previous relations with Mrs. Julian.</p>

  <p>"Well, she was one of Jacmer Touchon's patients. She got me some evidence
  against him without knowing that she was doing it, and I'm really in her debt
  on that score. Before that I saved her from handing over half a million to
  the notorious Walter Hanley. My first meeting with her was at the time of the
  Miller Moore case. Moore had been bleeding her for a couple of years. I
  succeeded in sending him to Sing Sing, you may remember."</p>

  <p>When she had hung up, Mme. Storey said: "Rumsey is satisfied it's a hoax.
  He says as long as I feel obliged to go to Mrs. Julian's house he won't
  bother to send anybody...He says I can attend to it better than any man," she
  added, with a side-long smile in my direction.</p>

  <p>"Humph!" I said, "he can afford to be flattering when he's getting your
  services for nothing."</p>

  <p>We 'phoned for a taxi and locked up the office. Though my employer
  affected to treat the matter lightly, I noticed a certain gravity in her
  expression, and on the way up I asked her if she thought it possible that
  Mrs. Julian's life was in danger.</p>

  <p>She shrugged impatiently. "Sooner or later that woman is certain to get
  into trouble. So prominent, so wealthy, so foolish! It's a fatal
  combination."</p>

  <p>"But if her money's all tied up in a trust fund, wouldn't it be like
  killing the goose that laid the golden eggs?"</p>

  <p>"So it would seem. But there is this to consider. She has a habit of
  giving out largesse with a good size string attached to it. She gives these
  crooks great sums of money in the guise of loans. There is no record that any
  of it was ever paid back. But when she sours on her dear friends, she is apt
  to demand her money, and there have been some very ugly scenes. That might
  supply a motive."</p>

  <p>We drew up in front of one of the newer mansions that line the blocks east
  of the Park. It was one of those houses that embody every known luxury and
  extravagance&mdash;except the trifling matter of sunshine. The few rooms
  which faced the narrow street got a certain amount of light, but as the house
  (as well as all its neighbours) covered about ninety per cent, of its lot,
  all the other rooms had to be content with electric light bulbs. Why be rich,
  one might ask, if you can't have sunshine? There is no answer. The rooms were
  filled with art treasures from every quarter of the globe, but you got no
  definite impression except that of mere expensiveness.</p>

  <p>To match everything else, Mrs. Julian had the most expensive of butlers.
  His name was Bunbury, and he had been with her for years. He was a very
  handsome man. He seemed to have raised butlering to heights before undreamed
  of. He was like a celebrated actor playing the part of butler on the
  stage.</p>

  <p>When my employer asked for Mrs. Julian, Bunbury looked deeply distressed.
  He knew that Mme. Storey was no ordinary caller to be turned away. "Mrs.
  Julian was not expecting you," he suggested.</p>

  <p>"No," said Mme. Storey blandly. "But that will be all right." She walked
  in.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," he stammered, following us, "but Mrs. Julian is very much
  engaged. I have positive instructions not to disturb her."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry too," said Mme. Storey, "but I have to see her. It is a matter
  of the greatest importance."</p>

  <p>"Madam, I cannot...I cannot..." he protested.</p>

  <p>"What's she doing?" asked my employer bluntly.</p>

  <p>"She's...er...she's having a séance," he replied, embarrassed.</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey started up the sweeping staircase with me following her, and
  the butler bringing up the rear, all but wringing his hands. "Madam, I beg of
  you...I beg of you..."</p>

  <p>"I will take the responsibility of disturbing her," said Mme. Storey
  serenely. "...If I insist on going in, you can't very well stop me, can you?"
  she added.</p>

  <p>"It's as much as my place is worth," he whimpered.</p>

  <p>"Very well, if you get fired I'll find you another place. You're an
  excellent servant."</p>

  <p>He gave up.</p>

  <p>The plan of the house was simple. On the first floor above the street
  there was a superb central hall with a peristyle of tall marble columns. The
  staircase swept on up behind the columns. In the front was an immense salon;
  in the rear a dining-room. The doors of the salon stood open and there was no
  séance going on in there. It could hardly be in the dining-room, so we kept
  on up.</p>

  <p>The next floor was devoted to Mrs. Julian's personal suite; boudoir,
  bedroom, dressing-rooms and so forth. All the doors giving on the hall were
  closed. From behind a door in the front came the steady drone of a single
  voice&mdash;a disquieting sound. Mme. Storey made unhesitatingly for that
  door, and opened it. The butler had faded away.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">The room was dark except for a patch of uncertain light
  towards the left. I had an impression of several motionless figures sitting
  around, and I saw a ghastly distorted face in the dim light. It seemed to
  have no body. It made my blood run cold. I almost cried out, though I guessed
  there was trickery in it.</p>

  <p>The voice ceased when we opened the door. There was a silence, then Mrs.
  Julian's voice, sharp and angry, demanding:</p>

  <p>"Who is it? How dare you come in here?"</p>

  <p>"Sorry, Aline," said Mme. Storey calmly. "I had to speak to you."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Julian did not instantly recognise the voice. She continued to cry:
  "Get out! Get out!" The strange figure in the middle of the room broke in
  sulkily: "It is useless. Everything is spoiled now. You had better turn on
  the light."</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey pressed the switch which was beside the door, and the lights
  flooded on. The room was Mrs. Julian's boudoir, and it presented a very odd
  scene. When I say the house had no character I should except the boudoir.
  That had plenty of character&mdash;of the wrong sort. A sea of baby-blue
  brocade with a foam of lace upon it. One might have guessed at a glance that
  this room expressed the soul of an elephantine blonde woman of fifty-odd.</p>

  <p>To the left stood an elegant little lacquer table with a carved teak-wood
  stand upon it supporting in turn a crystal globe. This was a beautiful
  object, reflecting as it did all the lights in broken shining particles. One
  can easily understand how a crystal globe has always been an object of
  mystery. A foot or so above the globe hung a lamp concealed within a black
  shade. It was the light from this falling on the crystal which had created
  the eerie glow I had first seen.</p>

  <p>Beside the table stood a theatrical figure, a short, plump man in a
  frock-coat that was too tight for him. He had a chocolate-coloured face and
  shifty black eyes. His lank black hair was plastered over his temples in the
  very manner of an oily schemer. His shallow eyes rolled viciously at us.
  Anybody but Mrs. Julian would have distrusted him at sight.</p>

  <p>Beyond the table in an over-stuffed baby-blue armchair sat Mrs. Julian,
  overstuffed herself, and enveloped in God knows how many yards of lavender
  chiffon. Her face which is naturally red showed a bluish hue under the
  powder. Perhaps that's why she wore lavender. She was a good-natured creature
  in her way, and I knew that my employer had a kind of fondness for her.</p>

  <p>Along the far side of the room sat three other persons, two men and a
  woman, of whom I shall have more to say directly. All three had an
  unwholesome look like things that wanted the sun.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Julian's puffy face presented a study when the lights went up. Dark
  with anger under her make-up, nevertheless she knew she could not afford to
  quarrel with Mme. Storey. She bit her lip and looked at the floor.</p>

  <p>"It is nothing," she muttered; "only...at such a moment of emotional
  tension it's a shock to have it broken."</p>

  <p>My employer instantly took her cue from the scene.</p>

  <p>"I know," she said sympathetically. "But I had a strong premonition that
  you needed me, Aline, and I hurried right here. You can't stop to question
  such feelings. I wouldn't let the servant keep me out."</p>

  <p>This sort of talk was well calculated to impress Mrs. Julian. She looked
  at Mme. Storey, surprised to hear it from her, and began to melt. "Oh,
  Rosika! But I am all right, darling!"</p>

  <p>"I'm so glad!" said Mme. Storey, taking her hand.</p>

  <p>The East Indian, seeing the current turning against him, became sulkier
  than before. He placed the crystal and its stand in the middle of a brilliant
  silk handkerchief and began to tie up the ends in Oriental fashion. "With
  your permission I will retire," he said stiffly to Mrs. Julian.</p>

  <p>"Oh, <i>please</i> don't go," said Mme. Storey in seeming concern. "I am
  <i>so</i> interested in everything pertaining to the psychic...Introduce me,
  Aline."</p>

  <p>"This is Professor Ram Lal," said Mrs. Julian a little unwillingly.
  Perhaps she suspected my employer of irony. "Madame Rosika Storey."</p>

  <p>All the persons in the room glanced at Mme. Storey with fear and dislike.
  I began to feel there must be some foundation for the warning we had
  received, and a nasty chill struck through me. Was it possible that this
  scowling Oriental meditated an attack on Mrs. Julian, and one of his rivals,
  getting wind of it, had telephoned us?</p>

  <p>"Do go on with your demonstration, Professor," said my employer
  cajolingly. "All my life I have been fascinated by the mystery of the
  crystal, and have been longing to meet somebody to elucidate it."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," he said with the pompous air that such people are bound to
  assume, "but the precious filaments that bind us to the infinite are too
  tenuous to be joined immediately when once they are snapped."</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey listened to him with pretended respect. "Then let us sit and
  talk awhile," she said, matching his tone. "Let us try to put ourselves in
  tune with the infinite so that new filaments may be woven." Drawing a chair
  up beside Mrs. Julian, she produced her cigarette case. I sat down behind
  them.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Julian, finding her friend so unexpectedly sympathetic, sighed with
  satisfaction, and took a cigarette. "Sit down, Ram Lal," she said
  carelessly.</p>

  <p>He dared not go then, though I fancy he was still suspicious of Mme.
  Storey. Declining a cigarette, he sat down on the other side of the table
  with an air of forced patience.</p>

  <p>"Do uncover the precious crystal," begged Mme. Storey. "I love to lose
  myself by gazing in its depths."</p>

  <p>He obeyed with an ill grace.</p>

  <p>"How inexpressibly beautiful!" she murmured. "The clear transparent sphere
  which seems to conceal nothing yet hides all! It is symbolic of the whole
  cosmos!"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Julian, now completely persuaded, leaned over and patted her hand.
  "Oh, Rosika, it is so sweet to hear you talk like this! Of course you're the
  cleverest woman in the world, but sometimes I have felt that...that...well,
  you know..."</p>

  <p>"That I lacked soul?" murmured Mme. Storey reproachfully. "Oh, Aline, how
  could you!"</p>

  <p>There was good comedy in this, but I felt no inclination at the time to
  smile. The East Indian's ugly expression kept me on tenterhooks.</p>

  <p>"I see that Madame Storey is one of us," he murmured. "A true
  psychic!"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Julian was quite carried away. The folds of lavender chiffon
  undulated with emotion. "Oh, Rosika, you have no conception of what a
  wonderful man he is!" she whispered. "In Ram Lal I have found a bridge to the
  beyond! He reads both the past and the future. I know that what he foretells
  of the future will come true because he is never wrong about the past. As
  soon as he begins to read the sphere the veils fall one by one!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, my dear, how wonderful! And what does he say is in store for
  you?"</p>

  <p>A shudder of ecstasy passed through Mrs. Julian's vast bulk. "Happiness!"
  she whispered; "a great happiness!"</p>

  <p>Such a rigmarole! I had all I could do to keep from snorting out loud. It
  made me mad that such a fool should have so much money to throw to the dogs
  while intelligent people have to get along with the barest necessities.</p>

  <p>Ram Lal was not supposed to hear Mrs. Julian's praises, but of course he
  could guess what she was saying. He lowered his eyes in mock modesty, but the
  smirk around his lips gave him away.</p>

  <p>"And the wonder of it is," Mrs. Julian went on, "this is only an ordinary
  crystal, though it was the best to be bought in New York." She dropped her
  voice again. "Just wait until the great Julian crystal is finished, my
  dear!"</p>

  <p>"What's that?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"Ram Lal is having the biggest and most flawless crystal made that the
  world has ever seen!" she whispered. "It's a secret as yet between him and
  me. It's going to cost a hundred thousand dollars! Ah! just think what
  <i>that</i> will reveal!"</p>

  <p>I wondered if she had given him the money yet. It seemed to me the whole
  situation depended on that.</p>

  <p>"And I mean to build a perfect temple to house the perfect crystal!" she
  whispered ecstatically. "So that all men may be permitted to share in
  universal knowledge. That shall be my contribution to my age!"</p>

  <p>"But I thought it was against the law," suggested Mme. Storey dryly.
  "Crystal-gazing, I mean."</p>

  <p>"Only if you take money for it," said Mrs. Julian a little sharply.
  Evidently this unpleasant feature had been forced on her attention before. "I
  shall endow the temple, of course, so that knowledge may be free to all!"</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey, while she occupied herself with the East Indian, did not
  overlook the other persons in the room. "Introduce me to the rest of your
  friends, Aline," she said pleasantly.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Julian threw them an inattentive glance. Clearly their noses were out
  of joint for the time being. "Dr. Cushack, Mrs. Bracker, Mr. Liptrott," she
  said carelessly.</p>

  <p>My employer arose and shook hands with each of them affably. The doctor
  was a small man with an inferiority complex; looked very fierce, squared his
  shoulders and talked in a deep bass voice. He had a small waxed moustache and
  used a slight foreign accent. That was to convey the idea that he had been
  educated abroad, you understand. He had the cheek to kiss my employer's hand
  in the Continental manner.</p>

  <p>"I see that Madame Storey has a great sense of humour," he said, with a
  glance of contempt in Ram Lal's direction.</p>

  <p>She made believe not to get it. "Oh, I hope so," she said with a
  silly-sounding laugh, and passed on to the next one.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Bracker was one of these skinny little women who have reduced to
  within an inch of their lives. All the make-up in the world could not hide
  the gaunt lines of under-nourishment and the haggard eyes. She was, God save
  her! a beauty-culturist. She took Mme. Storey's hand in both of hers.</p>

  <p>"It is an honour to meet the great Madame Storey," she simpered, while her
  eyes glittered with dislike. Well, naturally a beauty culturist wouldn't have
  much use for the real thing.</p>

  <p>The third was an old man dressed in a respectable black suit. He talked a
  little like a down-Easter. He was like any other old man, except that his
  eyes had a crazy expression. As Mme. Storey approached him he fumbled with
  the straps of a square leather case, and drew from it a weird-looking box
  with various cords and attachments hanging from it.</p>

  <p>"I am the discoverer of the invisible ray," he said impressively, "with
  which I shall rejuvenate mankind."</p>

  <p>He plugged one of the cords into an outlet and a hissing, crackling sound
  issued from the box. My employer stepped back, a little disconcerted.</p>

  <p>"Oh, for goodness' sake turn that thing off, Liptrott," said Mrs. Julian
  pettishly. "I've had enough of it!"</p>

  <p>He obeyed for the moment, but presently I saw him slyly turn it on again.
  He played with it like a child, perfectly oblivious to the rest of us.</p>

  <p>Professor Ram Lal's good humour having been restored, Mrs. Julian
  suggested that he resume the séance. Immediately there were objections from
  the other three.</p>

  <p>"My dear Aline, the excitement is so bad for you!" said Mrs. Bracker.</p>

  <p>"You promised to let me give a demonstration today," grumbled the old
  man.</p>

  <p>Dr. Cushack produced an elegant Russian leather case from his breast
  pocket. Upon being opened two rows of little vials containing drugs were
  revealed. "At least you should take your medicine first," he said.</p>

  <p>The sight of the drugs made me jumpy. Was this the potential murderer? I
  wondered. Was he going to poison her before our very eyes?</p>

  <p>However, Mrs. Julian waved the dose away. "I don't need it," she said.
  "Ram Lal does me more good than medicine."</p>

  <p>The East Indian stood up, pushed his chair back against the wall, and
  smoothed down his frock-coat. He glanced with insulting complacency at his
  beaten rivals. He made caressing passes with his hands over the crystal
  sphere. He was excessively vain of his hands, which were soft and plump with
  tapering fingers manicured to the limit. They looked vicious to me.</p>

  <p>"Lights, please," he drawled affectedly.</p>

  <p>Nobody moved, and Mrs. Julian said sharply: "Turn off the lights, Dr.
  Cushack."</p>

  <p>Nothing in the room was visible except the lambent crystal, the pale hands
  waving over it, and the smooth inhuman face in the reflected light, staring
  at it with an awful intentness. He began to mutter something in an uncouth
  tongue that was supposed to be Hindoo, but was more likely mere gibberish.
  Pure trickery, but horribly effective. In spite of myself I felt the
  unreasoning terror of a child. Goose-flesh rose slowly all over my body.</p>

  <p>The man was clearly working himself into a hysterical state. As he went on
  his voice became convulsed; a vertical vein stood out on his forehead, and
  his lips turned back over his ugly, misshapen teeth. My own teeth were
  chattering. Trickery...trickery...I kept saying to myself, but I could not
  break the spell.</p>

  <p>Finally he began to speak English in jerky phrases with long pauses
  between. "I perceive...I perceive a hill-top garden...It is winter, and the
  ground is covered with snow...The garden is ringed with evergreen trees
  weighted under snow...But at either end there is an opening amidst the trees
  which looks out over snowy hills and valleys..."</p>

  <p>"It is my place at Newtown to the life!" gasped Mrs. Julian. "Yet he has
  never been there!"</p>

  <p>I would have been willing to bet that he had been there.</p>

  <p>"...An elegant woman comes through a gate from a lower level...She bears
  herself like a queen...Though it is winter she is clad in the rosy veils of
  Springtide..."</p>

  <p>This was evidently intended for a portrait of Mrs. Julian.</p>

  <p>"...As she advances the snow disappears...The garden breaks into leaf and
  flower; the distant hills turn green...Now I perceive a great throng of
  people silently gathered under the trees...Their faces aspire with gladness;
  they raise their arms above their heads...For the queenly woman has brought
  light into their lives...the light of universal knowledge...!"</p>

  <p>The man now appeared to be completely possessed. His head rolled from side
  to side, only the eyes preserving their level stare at the crystal like water
  in a swaying vessel. He seemed to be speaking under an immense compulsion;
  his voice was hoarse and broken; a line of white foam edged his lips. It was
  too horrible, yet I could not drag my eyes away.</p>

  <p>"There is a little pavilion in the centre of the garden...It is completely
  embowered in vines...I cannot perceive what is inside...The woman advances
  towards it with firm proud steps...Ardent...aspiring with an inward
  fire...She goes inside...She finds..." He stopped. His eyes rolled up in his
  head until only the whites showed.</p>

  <p>"Oh, tell me! tell me!" gasped Mrs. Julian.</p>

  <p>"Joy supreme!" he yelled&mdash;and his body crashed to the floor in a
  heap.</p>

  <p>We all cried out. Mme. Storey sprang up, and ran to the light switch.
  Nobody else stirred. The room was flooded with light again, and I covered my
  face with my hands. I heard my employer say in a crisp, resolute voice:</p>

  <p>"What is this?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Julian had put her handkerchief to her eyes. "It always ends this
  way," she whimpered. "He gives so much! The strain is more than mortality can
  bear. He will come to directly."</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey relaxed. "Oh," she said, "probably epilepsy. I have heard that
  a fit can be induced in this manner."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Rosika, how can you!" said Mrs. Julian tearfully. "...Please ring for
  the servants," she added in a more matter-of-fact tone.</p>

  <p>The bell was alongside the mantel behind us. Bunbury and a second man
  entered almost immediately. It seemed as if they must have been expecting a
  summons.</p>

  <p>"Assist Professor Ram Lal to the retiring room," said Mrs. Julian.</p>

  <p>Bunbury took him by the shoulders, the other by the heels. His head lolled
  from side to side in a horrible manner, and his eyes were open. The two
  servants had impassive faces, yet it was clear they didn't like their task.
  They started for the door. Suddenly the butler dropped the body with a horrid
  thud on the floor. Somebody screamed.</p>

  <p>Bunbury turned a livid face towards his mistress. "My God, madam! He's
  stopped breathing! He's dead!" he gasped.</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">How shall I describe the scene of confusion that followed? I
  was dazed. To see death strike in such an unexpected direction; to see a man
  die without any visible reason for it; it was too horrible. I could not
  collect my faculties.</p>

  <p>The second man, when he discovered he was carrying a corpse, crumpled up
  in a dead faint. Bunbury dragged him out into the hall. Mme. Storey started
  to telephone for the police. At the first sound of the word police, Cushack,
  Mrs. Bracker and Liptrott made a dash to get out of the room.</p>

  <p>"Don't let them out of the house!" cried Mme. Storey, 'phone in hand. But
  what could I do?</p>

  <p>We found an unexpected aide in Bunbury. He ran in with outstretched arms
  blocking the way. His eyes flashed compellingly, and he had forgotten the
  smooth ways of the butler. "Stay where you are!" he cried. "Nobody leaves
  this room until the police come!" He kicked the door shut behind him.</p>

  <p>The two men yelled to get out, the woman screamed in insensate terror. "Be
  quiet, you fools!" cried Bunbury. "You are only convicting yourselves!"</p>

  <p>His strong voice quieted them. They returned across the room trembling,
  and turned their backs on the body. Mme. Storey pulled down a portière and
  covered it.</p>

  <p>The police were in the house within a few minutes, bringing their own
  doctor. Inspector Rumsey followed close behind them. Our old friend's face
  was grave.</p>

  <p>"This will look bad for me," he said to Mme. Storey; "after having
  disregarded your warning."</p>

  <p>"My fault," she said. "You put it up to me and I failed you."</p>

  <p>"Who could have foreseen this?" he said gloomily.</p>

  <p>An examination of the body failed to reveal the cause of death. There was
  no wound upon it. The supposed East Indian's skin was really as white as
  yours or mine. He was discovered to be a drug addict. A hypodermic needle was
  found on him together with a half-filled bottle of cocaine. There were marks
  of the needle on his arms and legs, but apparently the needle in his pocket
  had not been used within the last half-hour or so.</p>

  <p>"I should say heart failure at a venture," said the police doctor.</p>

  <p>"I have reason to believe he was murdered," said Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"Then it must be poison. Somebody else may have jabbed a needle in him.
  Could that have happened while the séance was going on?"</p>

  <p>"Quite easily," she answered. "It was dark in the room and our eyes were
  fastened on Ram Lal's face. Somebody might have crept along the floor."</p>

  <p>I was looking at that sweating trio when she said it, and I saw strange
  glances of terror pass between them. If they were all in this together they
  must have foreseen what would follow, and why should they look at each other?
  It was completely baffling.</p>

  <p>The body was removed from the house for an autopsy.</p>

  <p>Inspector Rumsey then set about searching the suspected persons. Dr.
  Cushack came first. When the pocket medicine case came to light, the
  Inspector handed it over to the doctor for examination. The latter whistled
  upon reading the labels on the vials.</p>

  <p>"A choice collection of poisons!" he remarked. "Some of them so rare I am
  not familiar with their properties...Do you use nothing but poisons in your
  practice?" he queried sarcastically.</p>

  <p>"I don't practice," muttered the young man. "I am engaged in research.
  Poisons happen to be my speciality."</p>

  <p>"Which poison were you intending to give Mrs. Julian?" asked Mme. Storey
  dryly.</p>

  <p>Cushack paled. I suppose he had forgotten that incident. "No poison! No
  poison!" he stammered. "This bottle," he pointed to one of the vials, "is
  marked antimony, but it only contains bicarbonate of soda. I...I...These
  labels...are just a bluff."</p>

  <p>Everybody smiled.</p>

  <p>"If you don't believe me, analyse them! analyse them!" he cried.</p>

  <p>One of the little vials was empty, which was suggestive if not exactly
  incriminating. It bore no label. Nothing else of interest was found upon
  him.</p>

  <p>Next came the woman. From the side pocket of her smart jacket the
  Inspector lifted a little leather case which, upon being opened, revealed a
  hypodermic needle. She screamed at the sight of it.</p>

  <p>"That's not mine! I never saw it before! I don't own such a thing! I don't
  know how it got into my pocket! You put it there yourself!"</p>

  <p>"That's what they all say," remarked the Inspector wearily.</p>

  <p>"I swear it! I swear it!" she screamed.</p>

  <p>"Don't swear to me," he said. "You'll have plenty of it to do later."</p>

  <p>She raved and beat her breast, but whether it was innocent or guilty
  terror I declare I could not tell. After all, they look much the same. You
  have to go by the evidence.</p>

  <p>The old man Liptrott was fairly gibbering with fright when the Inspector
  reached him. It was impossible to get a sensible word out of him. Only crazy
  talk about his machine. Nothing incriminating was found on him. But Mme.
  Storey pointed out that the mysterious apparatus was plugged into the wall at
  the moment of Ram Lal's death, therefore the old man could not be freed of
  suspicion until the nature of his machine had been investigated.</p>

  <p>"It couldn't hurt a fly!" cried Liptrott. "It's to save life, not to
  destroy it!"</p>

  <p>"I'll put it in the hands of an expert for examination," said Inspector
  Rumsey.</p>

  <p>The old man looked at him aghast. Then suddenly frantic, he aimed a kick
  at his beloved machine that would certainly have destroyed it, had not Mme.
  Storey coolly moved it out of the way. A policeman flung an arm around the
  old man.</p>

  <p>"It's the work of a lifetime!" he raved. "They'll steal it from me!
  They'll steal it!"</p>

  <p>As they were about to be taken away Mme. Storey said in that dangerously
  pleasant way of hers: "Which one of you sent me, or caused to be sent me, a
  message this morning warning me of what was going to happen?"</p>

  <p>They stared at her blankly.</p>

  <p>"Somebody telephoned me that a murder would be committed here this
  morning."</p>

  <p>I shall never forget the looks of consternation that spread over those
  three faces. For the moment they were incapable of replying. Then each
  stammeringly denied all knowledge of the telephone call. Again they glanced
  at each other in fear and suspicion. One thing was clear, they were speaking
  the truth then. Such perfect surprise could not have been assumed. That, I
  suppose, was what my employer was after.</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p class="first">I need hardly say that the case created a first-class
  sensation in the press. Mrs. Julian's wealth and prominence; the suggestions
  of mystery and chicanery; the weird Oriental flavour; it had everything. The
  public excitement seriously hampered the police and Mme. Storey in their
  work, but of course we could not blame the newspapers for making the most of
  a good story.</p>

  <p>The reporters were already waiting for us in a body when we returned to
  the office. Mme. Storey is popular with these boys because she deals fairly
  with them. She will keep back information when it seems necessary, but she
  does not lie to them. She now gave them the plain facts of what had happened
  in Mrs. Julian's house, and asked them to withhold comment until the result
  of the autopsy became known.</p>

  <p>"But the man is certainly dead," said one.</p>

  <p>"Quite!" said my employer with a dry smile. "But it is possible he died
  from natural causes."</p>

  <p>They glanced at each other peculiarly, and young Winship of the <i>Morning
  Press</i> dropped a bombshell at our feet by asking:</p>

  <p>"Is it true, Madame Storey, that an unknown person called you on the
  telephone this morning, and warned you that a murder would be committed at
  Mrs. Julian's house?"</p>

  <p>She bit her lip in chagrin. "Where did you hear that?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"My city editor told me to ask you."</p>

  <p>"We all heard the story," said the others in chorus.</p>

  <p>Before she answered them Mme. Storey had me call up the city editor of the
  <i>Morning Press</i>. He told me he had been given the story by an anonymous
  person over the telephone, and that, of course, he would not run it unless
  Mme. Storey confirmed it. Presumably the same message had been sent to all
  the papers.</p>

  <p>This put my employer in rather a difficult position. But she settled it
  promptly. "Yes, it is true," she said. "I thought it was a hoax, but I
  immediately called up Inspector Rumsey to tell him, and I went myself to Mrs.
  Julian's house."</p>

  <p>She was immediately bombarded with questions. "If you knew it, why didn't
  you stop it? Why did you allow the séance to go on?" And so forth. And so
  forth.</p>

  <p>"No more now," she said firmly. "I'm going to ask you boys to say nothing
  about the telephone call until we find out where we stand."</p>

  <p>"Why? Why?" they asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, for one thing, I'd like to disappoint the mysterious gentleman who
  is so keen about having it published."</p>

  <p>They were all willing to keep this piece of information back for
  twenty-four hours except a man on one of those irresponsible sheets that
  would sacrifice their mothers if there was a sensation in it. I need not name
  it. This man slipped out of the room, and we knew he had run off to his
  office with the story. That let them all out, of course. They beat it for
  their offices.</p>

  <p>My employer merely shrugged. "We can't reform the press," she said. "We
  have to work with it as we find it."</p>

  <p>An hour or two later the first editions came out with scare heads. Well,
  it was a juicy story. We got a shock when we read it, for, in spite of the
  care Mme. Storey had taken to prevent such a thing, it included a
  preposterous interview with Mrs. Julian.</p>

  <p>We taxied to her house at once, for there was no telling how she might
  react to the story of the telephone warning. Just as we were setting out, we
  received some interesting particulars from the police as to the so-called Ram
  Lal's antecedents.</p>

  <p>Bunbury let us into Mrs. Julian's house. As befitted the perfect butler
  his aspect was calm and grave. You would never have guessed from him that a
  tragedy had been enacted upstairs that day. After all, he was the only person
  in the house who had kept his head, and Mme. Storey smiled at him
  encouragingly.</p>

  <p>"How is your mistress, Bunbury?"</p>

  <p>"Calm, madam."</p>

  <p>"Bunbury, for her own sake you ought not to let her talk to newspaper
  reporters."</p>

  <p>He shrugged deprecatingly. "What can I do, madam? I perceived from the
  first that it would be unwise, but she ignored my suggestions. I cannot
  aspire to influence her actions."</p>

  <p>"What time did Ram Lal arrive here this morning?"</p>

  <p>"Ten o'clock, madam."</p>

  <p>"Did you notice anything unusual about him?"</p>

  <p>"No, madam, I perceived nothing out of the way."</p>

  <p>"Did he talk to anybody before he saw Mrs. Julian?"</p>

  <p>"No, madam, I showed him directly to the boudoir. Dr. Cushack and Mrs.
  Bracker were already there. Mr. Liptrott came later."</p>

  <p>As we moved towards the stairway Mme. Storey saw by Bunbury's face that he
  wished to say more. She paused.</p>

  <p>"If I might add a word," he went on apologetically, "&mdash;I hope it is
  not unbecoming from one in my position&mdash;I have worked for Mrs. Julian
  for eight years and I am sincerely attached to her. I hope you will give her
  a good talking to, madam. She will listen to you. From the first I perceived
  that something like this was bound to happen&mdash;indeed I feared it might
  be worse."</p>

  <p>"I'll do my best, Bunbury," said Mme. Storey gravely.</p>

  <p>We went on up to the boudoir. That woman's folly was simply incredible. We
  found her swathed in black chiffon, her face made up dead white. She was
  seated in front of the lacquer table, on which she had placed a photograph of
  the smug and unpleasant Ram Lal flanked with lighted candles. Turning on my
  employer like a tragedy queen, she shot out an accusing forefinger.</p>

  <p>"You knew what was going to happen! And you didn't prevent it! I could
  almost call you his murderer!"</p>

  <p>"Be yourself, Aline," said Mme. Storey calmly. "I thought it was a hoax.
  We are continually being hoaxed over the telephone."</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you tell me?"</p>

  <p>"Well, you are not a person that one tells things to. You carry on
  so!"</p>

  <p>I doubt if this reached Mrs. Julian's understanding.</p>

  <p>"I thought the threat&mdash;if there was a threat&mdash;was directed
  against you," Mme. Storey went on. "Who could ever have foreseen that it was
  worth anybody's while to murder Ram Lal?"</p>

  <p>It was useless to try to reason with Mrs. Julian. She raved on, calling on
  Heaven to witness what a pure and holy man had been struck down. There was a
  sort of complacency in her that suggested she was thoroughly enjoying her own
  dramatics. Exasperating. However, Mme. Storey merely smoked on and let her
  rave. When she could get a word in edgewise, she said:</p>

  <p>"When you quiet down we will discuss how to set about finding the
  murderer. That's all we can do for Ram Lal now."</p>

  <p>This started Mrs. Julian off at a new tangent. "She did it!" she cried.
  "That woman! She was jealous of my favour. Oh, what black ingratitude! After
  the thousands I have spent on her!"</p>

  <p>"How could she have done it?" asked Mme. Storey mildly.</p>

  <p>"Stole up to him when it was dark, and stuck the poisoned needle in his
  leg!...I saw her! I saw her!" she cried wildly.</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey was not impressed. "Why didn't you say so at once?" she
  asked.</p>

  <p>"I was too much shocked. I didn't realise...But I saw her, I tell
  you!"</p>

  <p>"Now come, Aline," said my employer. "Are you prepared to go on the stand
  and swear that you saw Mrs. Bracker do it?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Julian began to falter. "Well...no...But she did it just the same.
  They found the needle on her, didn't they?"</p>

  <p>"She claimed that it was planted in her pocket."</p>

  <p>"That's a lie, anyhow! She bought that needle a week ago. I know
  that."</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey took more interest. "That's important if true. How do you know
  it?"</p>

  <p>"One day after she had been here I found a little package on the table
  wrapped in druggists' paper. Not knowing whose it was, I opened it, and the
  hypodermic needle was inside. She was quite embarrassed when I asked her
  about it. Said she had bought it for a friend."</p>

  <p>"Was the name of the druggist on the paper?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. It was Almon and Emory."</p>

  <p>"Can you fix the date?"</p>

  <p>"Let me see...I was wearing my new pink dress when I handed it to her.
  That was Saturday. It must have been Friday when she bought it."</p>

  <p>"Friday, February fourth," said my employer. "Make a note of it,
  Bella...How long have you known the woman?"</p>

  <p>"About a year. She brought a letter from Mrs. Applewhite recommending her
  as a reducer."</p>

  <p>"Who's Mrs. Applewhite?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, she was my most intimate friend at that time, but we've quarrelled
  since. She's just a woman that you meet in hotels."</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Bracker was a reducer?" prompted Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"Yes, she had a new idea. No fasting, no drugs. She just demonstrated
  slimness."</p>

  <p>"Eh?" said Mme. Storey, running up her eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Will-power," said Mrs. Julian.</p>

  <p>"Hers or yours?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, hers entirely. That's what I paid her for. I had nothing to do but
  sit and relax."</p>

  <p>"I see."</p>

  <p>"Seemed so modest and sensible," Mrs. Julian went on. "And you gotta admit
  her methods had been successful in her own case. She used to weigh 176
  pounds. That little woman. Showed me photographs of herself step by step. She
  took off 68 pounds without denying herself a thing!"</p>

  <p>"Did you see her eating everything?"</p>

  <p>"No. She never took her meals here."</p>

  <p>"I thought not. Go on."</p>

  <p>"It was lovely to be able to eat as much as I wanted," said Mrs. Julian
  innocently. "I do enjoy my meals so. And I lost weight all the time!" She
  sprang up, gave her skirts a flirt in front of the mirror, and looked at
  herself coyly over her shoulder. "You gotta admit, Rosika, that I'm ever so
  much slenderer than I was last year."</p>

  <p>"Optimist!" murmured Mme. Storey under her breath. "How much money have
  you given her?" she asked aloud.</p>

  <p>"Latterly it's been five hundred a week. She claimed to be giving me her
  entire time. She didn't have to be with me, she said. She could sit in her
  own room and concentrate on my slenderness. She showed me the scales every
  week."</p>

  <p>"Doctored," said Mme. Storey. "You hadn't stopped paying her, had you? Why
  was she jealous of Ram Lal?"</p>

  <p>"Well, she wanted me to settle a lump sum on her."</p>

  <p>"Had you promised to do so?"</p>

  <p>"Not exactly promised. I couldn't seem to get the money together. I gave
  it all to Ram Lal."</p>

  <p>"How much?"</p>

  <p>"A hundred thousand for the crystal. I was trying to get two hundred
  thousand together to purchase a site for the temple. Nobody knew about the
  money I gave him. That was a secret between Ram Lal and me."</p>

  <p>"I wonder if it was!" remarked Mme. Storey. "...How about Liptrott?" she
  went on.</p>

  <p>"Oh, just a harmless lunatic," said Mrs. Julian impatiently. "I've been
  keeping him for years. There's that machine of his. Supposed to restore
  youth. He's always after me to start a company to manufacture it. Once I
  thought there was something in it, but latterly Mrs. Bracker and Dr. Cushack
  seemed to be doing me so much good I hadn't much time for Liptrott."</p>

  <p>"So Dr. Cushack has been doing you good, too," said Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Julian paused and her fat face started to work like a child's about
  to cry. "I thought he was," she wailed. "But my family doctor says he's just
  been feeding me morphine!...Cushack said it was a rare drug called adrianum.
  He imported it from the Great Gobi desert in China, and it cost five hundred
  dollars a gram...Oh, it made me feel so good!" she added, dissolving into
  tears altogether.</p>

  <p>"I don't doubt it," said Mme. Storey. "You need a nurse."</p>

  <p>"I know it!" wailed Mrs. Julian. "I have the heart of a child!"</p>

  <p>"For goodness' sake why don't you make friends with decent people?" asked
  Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"Nobody likes me except the people I give money to," mourned Mrs.
  Julian.</p>

  <p>My employer and I looked at each other. It was only too true!</p>

  <p>"Where did you meet Cushack?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"At one of Mrs. Piper's teas. She always has such clever people. He
  attracted me from the first because he talked so intellectually. I adore
  intellect. Had diplomas from all the best foreign universities. He had a new
  theory. Toxi-therapy, he called it."</p>

  <p>"It's new all right," murmured my employer.</p>

  <p>"You know, it means fighting poison with poison. It certainly sounded
  convincing. I asked him if my nervousness came from a poison, and he said
  certainly, and told me of this wonderful new drug. And after he had been to
  see me a few times I took some."</p>

  <p>"You let him give you a poison!" exclaimed Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"Oh, he took some himself first," said Mrs. Julian with her innocent baby
  stare. "He carried around the most terrible poisons, and took them quite
  freely, because he had made himself immune."</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey could only shake her head. "How about Ram Lal?" she asked.
  "Did you meet him at a tea?"</p>

  <p>"No, he wrote asking me to help the starving millions in India. No thought
  of self. I didn't pay any attention to his first letters; I get so many! But
  later he said something that proved he was psychic."</p>

  <p>"What was that?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, you'll only laugh. He wrote that the feeling kept coming to him that
  I was starving too, in the midst of my riches, and he was holding a thought
  of spiritual sustenance in his mind."</p>

  <p>"So you asked him to call."</p>

  <p>"Yes. Oh, my dear, if you could have seen him you wouldn't scoff. So thin
  and emaciated; his great eyes burning with an other-worldly light! He had
  spent years in abstinence and meditation."</p>

  <p>"Seems to have put on flesh since," murmured Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"Well, yes, a little...But, oh, my dear! a true mystic! There was a little
  crystal on my desk, just an ornament. His gaze fastened on it and he began to
  read the past and the future. Imagine my joy!"</p>

  <p>"How about the starving millions in India?"</p>

  <p>"Well, we found that the reports were much exaggerated."</p>

  <p>"The truth is," said Mme. Storey relentlessly, "Ram Lal's brown skin went
  no farther than his neck and wrists. I am informed by the police that his
  right name was Sam Gumpel. He was the son of an East Side tailor who threw
  him out years ago because he wouldn't work."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Julian buried her face in her hands. "No! No!" she wailed. "I will
  not believe it! Oh, spare me my last illusion!" But in her heart she knew it
  was true.</p>

  <p>"I assume you paid all these people by cheque?" said Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Julian, weeping, nodded her head.</p>

  <p>"Then I want you to make me a list from the stubs of all the sums you have
  given them with the dates."</p>

  <p>She promised to do so.</p>

  <p>"Last year," said Mme. Storey severely. "I found you in the hands of a
  witch-doctor and a woman who called herself a physi-meliorator. What has
  become of them?"</p>

  <p>"I sent them away," whimpered Mrs. Julian. "Bunbury caught them faking and
  told me."</p>

  <p>"With you," my employer went on, divided between pity and exasperation,
  "life seems to be just one damn faker after another. What's to become of you
  if you go on like this? I can't spare the time to get you out of your
  scrapes."</p>

  <p>"What am I to do?" wailed Mrs. Julian in one of her rare bursts of
  honesty; "anybody with a slick tongue can get around me!"</p>

  <p>"Hire a watch dog to stand between you and such people. Get an
  incorruptible woman for a secretary; one who will tell you the truth!"</p>

  <p>"Where could I find such a one?"</p>

  <p>"I'll find her for you...But mind you, if you fire her for telling you the
  truth, I swear I'll have you declared incompetent by the courts!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'll do anything you say, Rosika! Anything!"</p>

  <h3>V</h3>

  <p class="first">Inspector Rumsey was in our office to report on what the
  police had been doing, and to confer with my employer. I should point out
  that Mme. Storey's connection with this case was purely <i>ex officio</i>. It
  was entirely a police matter, and she worked with them merely because her
  reputation was involved owing to that confounded telephone call.</p>

  <p>At the same time we were quietly busy on our own account. Crider and
  Stephens, two of our best men, had been detailed to watch the Julian house
  and to report on all who entered or left it. I had verified the sale of the
  hypodermic needle to Mrs. Bracker. Mme. Storey had sent for a transcript of
  the examination of the three suspects by the police, and was studying it.
  Psychology is her forte.</p>

  <p>Everything still waited on the result of the autopsy. Dr. Chisholm, the
  toxicologist who was conducting it, had promised to meet the Inspector in our
  office at eleven.</p>

  <p>"What progress have you made since I saw you?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"I have been progressing backward," the Inspector bitterly answered.</p>

  <p>She laughed and pushed the cigarettes towards him. "Well, it isn't the
  first time we've been stumped, old friend."</p>

  <p>"It seems as if there was a regular conspiracy to baulk me!" he went on,
  pounding his thigh. "Matson, who runs the homicide bureau in the district
  attorney's office, won't act. Says the case is a mare's nest. In short, he
  leaves me holding the bag. On the other hand, the three suspects have engaged
  Jim Shryock to represent them. The cleverest and most unscrupulous shyster in
  New York! He's been a thorn in my side for years!"</p>

  <p>"Has he made any move?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. He's given me forty-eight hours to have his clients arraigned before
  a magistrate, or he'll swear out writs of habeas corpus, he says. When there
  is a suspicion of murder a magistrate would hold them upon the least bit of
  evidence. But I haven't even that. Shryock knows that he has me!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, well," said Mme. Storey soothingly, "the result of the autopsy may
  force him to change his tune."</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said Rumsey darkly. "He seems damn sure of himself."</p>

  <p>"What have you learned about these people?"</p>

  <p>"Very little. On the woman's cards she gave her address as the Hotel
  Vandermeer. I found for a fact that she had been living there nearly a year.
  An expensive suite. The management denied that she's been carrying on any
  business in the hotel."</p>

  <p>"They would say that anyhow."</p>

  <p>"Sure. She had her own telephone. The servants said she had no visitors. I
  found cocaine in powder form in her room, so I assume she is an addict.
  Nothing to throw any light on her past except half a dozen family
  photographs. I'm trying to trace them through the names of the photographers
  that appear on the cards."</p>

  <p>"Here's a lead," said Mme. Storey. "I find that Mrs. Bracker purchased a
  hypodermic needle from the firm of Almon and Emory on February fourth. She
  presented an order for it signed by Dr. A. Cushack."</p>

  <p>Rumsey sat up with a jerk. "Good!" he cried. "Then it was her needle that
  we found on her. It implicates them both. Now we have the beginning of a
  case!"</p>

  <p>"We may have," said Mme. Storey cautiously.</p>

  <p>"As to the Doctor," the Inspector went on, "I have had the contents of his
  medicine case analysed, and the so-called poisons turn out to be harmless.
  Common salt; coloured water; alcohol and the like. One contained morphine but
  not in sufficient quantity to kill. The fellow was actually speaking the
  truth!"</p>

  <p>"Even a liar has to sometimes," murmured Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"I visited his office; a single room in a commercial building on
  Forty-Second Street. There was chemical paraphernalia lying about; retorts,
  bottles, etc. No drugs. Nothing to show he had been working there
  lately."</p>

  <p>"Probably cleaned up in expectation of a search," suggested Mme.
  Storey.</p>

  <p>"No doubt," said Rumsey gloomily.</p>

  <p>"Did you question the office cleaners?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Not yet."</p>

  <p>"I'll do that when we learn the result of the autopsy."</p>

  <p>"Very well...There were no letters or personal papers," he resumed. "To my
  surprise, his diploma turned out to be genuine. He was graduated from
  Jefferson five years ago, and admitted to practice in this state the same
  year."</p>

  <p>"You have inquired at the college?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Members of the faculty identified him from a photograph. Was
  remembered as a sharp lad but an indifferent student. Not well liked."</p>

  <p>"And Liptrott?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"I have been able to piece together a fairly complete life story for him.
  Has lived at the Sanford House on West Eleventh Street for many years. An
  ancient hotel now much run down. Has several important inventions to his
  credit, but the money he got for them has been spent long ago. He is alone in
  the world now. Is considered slightly cracked by his associates in the
  hotel.</p>

  <p>"There is no doubt that he has gone deeply into the nature of electrical
  phenomena. I had an expert from the G.E. laboratories to study his machine.
  Could make nothing of it. Says it appears to be a senseless conglomeration of
  tubes and wires and magnets. But he will not swear there is nothing in it
  without having some knowledge of what Liptrott was after. The longer you
  study electricity, he says, the greater respect you have for its
  possibilities."</p>

  <p>"Quite," said Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"I found cocaine in liquid form in Liptrott's room," said the Inspector,
  "but no needle. He's evidently an addict too. He's been whining for it all
  day. I don't know what's coming to the world!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, the world is much as it always was," returned Mme. Storey. "These
  people belong to a special class, moral invalids; it's natural they should
  turn to drugs to buoy them up...I suggest you give him a needle to steady
  him," she went on. "Bring him up here with his machine before lunch, and let
  him give you and me a demonstration."</p>

  <p>Rumsey agreed.</p>

  <p>"What have you learned about Ram Lal?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"A month ago he rented a house on West Seventy-Ninth Street near Columbus
  Avenue. No one there when I entered it yesterday. Had been lavishly furnished
  in Oriental style. According to the neighbours he employed several servants,
  but they had vanished. I found nothing that threw any light on the manner of
  his murder."</p>

  <p>Promptly at eleven the buzzer sounded in the outer office announcing the
  coming of Dr. Chisholm. He was the most famous toxicologist in New York and a
  good all-round man. We had had dealings with him before.</p>

  <p>I led him into Mme. Storey's room. His face was giving nothing away. The
  Inspector jumped up eagerly. He could scarcely wait for polite greetings to
  be exchanged.</p>

  <p>"Well, doctor?"</p>

  <p>Dr. Chisholm spread out his hands deprecatingly. "The result of the
  autopsy is nil," he said. "I cannot tell you what killed Ram Lal."</p>

  <p>It was a bitter disappointment. Inspector Rumsey dropped back into his
  chair with a grunt. My employer carefully knocked the ash off her
  cigarette.</p>

  <p>I pushed forward a chair for the doctor. For a moment there was silence in
  the room. Finally Mme. Storey said incredulously:</p>

  <p>"A man dies, and with all the resources of science at your command you
  cannot say why!"</p>

  <p>"He died because his heart stopped beating," he replied. "I don't know why
  it stopped."</p>

  <p>"No trace of poison in his blood?"</p>

  <p>"None whatever."</p>

  <p>"Or in his stomach?"</p>

  <p>"None."</p>

  <p>"How could he have been poisoned through the stomach?" put in Rumsey.</p>

  <p>"To be sure," said Mme. Storey; "but I didn't want to overlook
  anything...But do men die like that?" she went on to the doctor. "Without any
  apparent reason for it?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, Madame."</p>

  <p>"Healthy men?"</p>

  <p>"Few men over forty can be said to be perfectly healthy. His lungs showed
  some infiltration due to old tubercular lesions. His heart was a little
  enlarged, but without any pericarditis. There were also some suspicious spots
  in the pelvis. All common conditions."</p>

  <p>"But none of them sufficient to have caused death?"</p>

  <p>"Not ordinarily."</p>

  <p>"Then if this was just an ordinary case the report would be that the man
  died of...?"</p>

  <p>"Heart failure, Madame."</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey and the Inspector looked at each other. Rumsey was very
  glum.</p>

  <p>"But there are poisons, doctor," my employer insisted, "that may kill
  without leaving any trace of themselves in the body?"</p>

  <p>"There are such poisons," he answered cautiously, "but naturally they are
  not known outside the laboratory. We never meet them in practice."</p>

  <p>"There is a possibility this crime may be the work of a chemist."</p>

  <p>"I am aware of it."</p>

  <p>"Would you be kind enough to prepare me a list of such poisons together
  with their properties and effects so far as known?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Certainly, Madame."</p>

  <p>"What's the use?" said Rumsey. "Even though there are such poisons, how
  can we go beyond the body?"</p>

  <p>"Every precedent has to be created in the first place," she answered
  smiling.</p>

  <p>"I say we're stalled," he said with his harassed air. "Aren't we justified
  now in assuming that it was only a coincidence?"</p>

  <p>"How do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Well, a practical joker calls up and tells you there is going to be a
  murder at Mrs. Julian's. You go there, and a man happens to die from natural
  causes."</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey slowly shook her head. "That would be stretching the arm of
  coincidence too far. I don't believe he died a natural death, and you don't
  believe it. The public would never believe it, and if we tried to put it over
  it would only react to the damage of our own reputations."</p>

  <p>"But what can we do?" he said helplessly. "There is no case!"</p>

  <p>"We must build up a case."</p>

  <p>"Have you a theory?" he asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>"I have a theory," she answered dryly, "but the evidence is
  insufficient."</p>

  <p>They agreed among themselves to withhold the result of the autopsy for a
  few hours, or at least until Dr. Chisholm had time to read up on the rare
  poisons that might have been administered to Ram Lal. However, as he was in
  the act of taking his leave, the telephone rang and a man's voice inquired
  for him.</p>

  <p>I handed the instrument over to him. He presently clapped a hand over the
  transmitter and lifted a dismayed face.</p>

  <p>"It's the city editor of the <i>Morning Press</i>," he said. "He tells me
  somebody has just called him up to say that the autopsy on the body of Ram
  Lal revealed no trace of poison. He wants me to confirm it. At my office they
  told him I was here."</p>

  <p>Inspector Rumsey jumped up, swearing roundly. My employer used no
  expletives, but her face turned grim.</p>

  <p>"This is the fine Italian hand of the murderer again," she said quietly.
  "He is vain of his crime."</p>

  <p>"But the suspects are all locked up!" cried the perplexed Inspector. "How
  could they reach a telephone?"</p>

  <p>She did not answer. "If the truth is out we would only make ourselves
  ridiculous by denying it," she said to Dr. Chisholm. "Tell the city editor
  his information is correct."</p>

  <p>He did so, and hung up. Both men looked to my employer for inspiration.
  She arose and paced the long room, thinking hard. At last she said:</p>

  <p>"When you find yourself up against it, unexpected measures are called for.
  Jim Shryock dares you to produce the suspects for a hearing two days hence.
  Why wait until he is ready? Shryock is famous for his success in making away
  with evidence. I suggest you produce them before a magistrate this
  afternoon."</p>

  <p>"They'll be set free!" cried Rumsey.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter much," she said impatiently; "none of those three is
  the actual murderer...Have them up this afternoon. Summon your witnesses to
  court. But do not let the suspects be arraigned until just before court
  adjourns. If the case goes over until the next day so much the better. I take
  it you can arrange that?"</p>

  <p>"Sure!" said the puzzled Rumsey. "Anything you say. But what's the idea.
  Just give me a hint of what you're up to so I won't make any mistake."</p>

  <p>"It's simply this," she answered. "I want to collect the whole <i>dramatis
  personæ</i> in court this afternoon, and keep them there, so that I can do
  some intensive work on the case without interference."</p>

  <p>"How about Liptrott?"</p>

  <p>"I'll attend to him while I'm eating my lunch."</p>

  <h3>VI</h3>

  <p class="first">In order to save time I had a light lunch sent in for Mme.
  Storey. She was eating it when Liptrott was brought up from Headquarters
  carrying his precious box. His guards were invited to wait in the hall.
  Inspector Rumsey who had been away on some errand returned about the same
  time.</p>

  <p>I have already described the old man with his decent black clothes and
  old-fashioned Yankee manner. There was no look of the potential murderer
  about him. On all subjects but one he seemed perfectly sane and shrewd, but
  when that blessed machine came up, his tongue went wild. Such borderline
  cases, of course, may be extremely dangerous.</p>

  <p>"He's happy again," the Inspector whispered to Mme. Storey. "They gave him
  another needle."</p>

  <p>And indeed the old man seemed as pleased as a child at a party. My
  employer had me order in some good cigars for him. He bit the end off one,
  and lighted it with gusto.</p>

  <p>"The real Havana, mem. Once I smoked none but the best myself."</p>

  <p>We grouped ourselves around the big writing-table.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Liptrott," said Mme. Storey, "I didn't have them bring you up here to
  be worried with questions about that terrible affair yesterday. I am just
  curious about that wonderful machine of yours, and I'm hoping you'll give me
  a demonstration."</p>

  <p>He sprang up with alacrity. "Happy to oblige, 'm."</p>

  <p>I was sitting on Mme. Storey's right with my note-book on the table. The
  Inspector was opposite her with his chair turned half around so he could
  watch Liptrott. The old man carried his apparatus to the nearest outlet in
  the baseboard, and lifted out the smaller box with the cords dangling from
  it, and switches and dials on top. Plugging it in, he turned a switch and I
  heard the familiar buzzing and crackling. The sound brought back the whole
  horrible scene in Mrs. Julian's boudoir.</p>

  <p>Satisfied that it was working all right, he switched it off and gave us a
  little lecture. I shall not try to repeat it all. A crazy mixture of
  electrical and physiological terms, it sounded like utter nonsense to me. For
  instance:</p>

  <p>"...And so, mem, just as a man-made generator gathers the vital principle
  out of the air and sends it to us in a current that we can use for light and
  power, so nature's generator which is the body, absorbs life through its
  organs. But as the body machine wears out it becomes less able to transmute
  raw life to its own uses, and so our vitality fails.</p>

  <p>"My machine replaces the organs and glands of the body. It takes raw
  electricity from the power station and digests it into a form that the body
  can use. I am no quack doctor. I make no claim that it can cure disease. I
  only say that it will furnish you with the vitality necessary to resist
  disease and to keep you young."</p>

  <p>The obvious question was, why didn't he renew his own visibly failing
  vitality? However, nobody put it to him.</p>

  <p>"How wonderful!" said Mme. Storey. "Can you give us all a sample now?"</p>

  <p>"Not all of you at once," he said. "One at a time. I must first find out
  the measure of a person's vitality, and set the machine accordingly. No two
  persons are the same."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Mme. Storey. "We are all like radio receiving sets that only
  pick up the wave lengths for which we are set."</p>

  <p>"Same principle, mem."</p>

  <p>You see there was a crazy plausibility about his spiel. I could understand
  how a woman like Mrs. Julian might be deceived by it for a while.</p>

  <p>Liptrott held out a small zinc cylinder that was connected to the machine
  by a cord. "If you'll grasp this a minute the dial will register."</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey obeyed, and he read off the dial: "Seven four seven, point two
  five. Your vitality is very high, mem. You would not need my machine for many
  a year to come."</p>

  <p>"That's nice. I suppose it won't hurt me."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no. Nobody feels so good but what they couldn't feel better."</p>

  <p>He took the cylinder from her. "What must I do now?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Nothing, mem. You may sit and eat. The best of my machine is, the user
  don't have to devote any time to it. You can go on about your business and it
  will still be doing its work as long as you're in the same room."</p>

  <p>"How convenient!"</p>

  <p>Seating herself, she took another sandwich. Meanwhile Liptrott turned a
  switch, and the crackling recommenced. He had set up a little vertical steel
  disc on top of the box, and turned it towards Mme. Storey. For a while
  nothing was said.</p>

  <p>"Do you feel anything?" he asked at last.</p>

  <p>"A sort of pleasant warmth stealing through my veins."</p>

  <p>"That's it!" he cried exultantly. "Increased vitality...I am only giving
  you a very little," he added. "Too much would be dangerous, very
  dangerous!"</p>

  <p>It was impossible to tell from Mme. Storey's expression whether she was
  really impressed or not. Rumsey was watching her covertly.</p>

  <p>Liptrott presently switched off the current. "That's enough," he said, "or
  you wouldn't get any sleep tonight."</p>

  <p>"I am tingling all over," she said.</p>

  <p>He carefully deposited the box in its case together with the various cords
  and handles, and locked it up. He then stood up with a manner that he
  intended to be very dramatic, but it was pathetic in one so old. His eyes
  were quite daft then.</p>

  <p>"Now that I have convinced you of the worth of my invention," he said, "I
  have a statement to make."</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey was calmly eating. "What is it?"</p>

  <p>He folded his arms like an old-time actor. "It was me who killed Professor
  Ram Lal."</p>

  <p>"Good God! how?" exclaimed Rumsey.</p>

  <p>"With my machine. I gave him the full charge. It killed him. I told Mme.
  Storey over the 'phone I was going to do it."</p>

  <p>"Yours was not the voice I heard over the 'phone," I said.</p>

  <p>"I changed my voice to sound young."</p>

  <p>"What did you do it for?" demanded the Inspector.</p>

  <p>"He was a blackguard and a swindler! I killed him to save Mrs.
  Julian."</p>

  <p>"Is there anything in this?" said the Inspector turning to Mme.
  Storey.</p>

  <p>She glanced at the old man enigmatically. "I find it hard to believe," she
  said, "because I only experienced good from the machine." Clearly, this was
  to draw him out.</p>

  <p>Mildly as the doubt was expressed, it roused Liptrott to a crazy fury. In
  order to justify his invention he was willing, it appeared, to send himself
  to the chair. "It's true! It's true," he cried stamping on the floor. "What
  can build up can also destroy! If I had an animal here, a dog, a cat, a bird,
  I could prove it to you. I would kill it before your eyes."</p>

  <p>My employer pretended to raise objections. "I don't want anything
  killed."</p>

  <p>"Then I won't kill it," said Liptrott. "I'll just drive it crazy for a
  while. That will show you...Send out to an animal store," he begged; "get a
  guinea pig, a young dog, anything that has life!"</p>

  <p>The upshot of this strange scene was that I was presently despatched to
  the basement to borrow the house cat from the engineer.</p>

  <p>He had his machine out of the box again, and was testing it when I
  entered. He had calmed down, but his glance was still perfectly insane. "It
  will be a little difficult to take her register," he said. "You had better
  hold her since she's accustomed to you."</p>

  <p>I held the cat on her back in my lap, putting the zinc cylinder against
  her breast as Liptrott told me, while he steadied her hindquarters. She was a
  gentle cat and made no protest at first, but suddenly with a loud miaow, she
  leaped from my lap and running to the door, scratched at it, and looked at me
  reproachfully over her shoulder.</p>

  <p>"I have her register!" cried Liptrott, glancing at his dial. "It is seven
  six eight. A very strong cat. So much the better!"</p>

  <p>Switching on the current he turned the steel disc in the direction of the
  cat. She, seeing that no further move was made against her, sat down with
  admirable composure, and started licking her paw.</p>

  <p>It all seemed like crazy nonsense to me, nevertheless my heart was beating
  fast. There was something uncanny about it. There was no sound in the room
  but the muffled crackling and buzzing from inside the box.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the cat with an uneasy whine arose and stood as if listening,
  twitching her tail. She crouched and whimpered, twisting her head from side
  to side. Then with a cry she began to run. She ran straight into the wall.
  She seemed to have increased to twice her size and her tail stood up as thick
  as a fox's brush. Faster and faster she ran like a creature possessed, until
  she seemed to be running straight around the walls.</p>

  <p>Liptrott switched off the current. He laughed and slapped his thigh in
  childish delight. "Now will you believe me! Now will you believe me!" he
  babbled.</p>

  <p>I stared at him in horror. Crazy he certainly was, but it seemed to me
  that he possessed the power of life and death in that black box!</p>

  <p>"Good God, then it's true!" muttered the Inspector. "It was he who killed
  Ram Lal!"</p>

  <p>"He had no more to do with Ram Lal's death than I had," said Mme. Storey
  coolly from her chair. "I suspected it from the first. Now I know it. There
  is nothing the matter with the cat but a shot of cocaine. I saw him give her
  the needle while Bella held her."</p>

  <p>Poor Rumsey looked excessively foolish. I know I felt so.</p>

  <p>Liptrott, when his trick was exposed, snarled with rage, and started
  cursing us all. His guards led him away.</p>

  <p>"Nothing in it but a crazy desire to win notoriety for his machine," said
  Mme. Storey. "There's no use bringing him up in court. Better take him home
  to his hotel."</p>

  <h3>VII</h3>

  <p class="first">Since I had inside information that the suspects in the Ram
  Lal case were not to be arraigned until near the close of the session, I did
  not go to court until after four. The place was the West Side Court on
  Fifty-Third Street. I was provided with a witness' card which would admit me
  to a seat on the front benches.</p>

  <p>The gross figure of Jim Shryock was lolling in the corner seat of the
  front row. With a sneer fixed in his face, he was idly trimming his nails. An
  entirely unscrupulous lawyer with mysterious political affiliations, he was
  one of the most sinister figures in New York. Everybody knew he was a crook,
  but it seemed impossible to reach him. In the end I'm glad to say, Mme.
  Storey caught him with the goods. But that's another story.</p>

  <p>I was astonished to see that he had old Liptrott sitting beside him. At
  the moment I was unable to figure out the significance of this move. Liptrott
  was quiet enough then.</p>

  <p>The magistrate was McManigal, one of the newer appointees who take
  themselves very seriously.</p>

  <p>As the moments passed, the frown on Inspector Rumsey's face deepened. He
  knew that he was doomed to cut a ridiculous figure in court unless Mme.
  Storey came to his aid before our suspects were arraigned.</p>

  <p>Finally their names were called, and they were brought in. Cushack was
  trying to look nonchalant, while Mrs. Bracker was tight-lipped and defiant.
  Both wished to have it understood that though they happened to be arraigned
  together, there was no connection between them. Jim Shryock arose lazily, and
  entered the enclosure to whisper with them.</p>

  <p>Rumsey started a speech to the bench relating all the circumstances of Ram
  Lal's death. He was obviously sparring for time, and his Honour soon became
  impatient.</p>

  <p>"Inspector, it's scarcely necessary to go into detail concerning a matter
  that has been so thoroughly written up in the newspapers. Just present your
  evidence against these persons and I'll hold them."</p>

  <p>Rumsey bowed, and called to the stand a clerk from the store of Almon and
  Emory who testified to the sale of a hypodermic needle to Mrs. Bracker, and
  identified the order she had presented for it signed by Dr. Cushack. The
  clerk was followed by a policeman who testified to the finding of a needle on
  Mrs. Bracker after the death of Ram Lal. Inspector Rumsey then called me to
  the stand to testify as to the obvious jealousy and hatred that Cushack and
  Mrs. Bracker had exhibited towards Ram Lal.</p>

  <p>"Is that all?" asked the magistrate, running up his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"That is all, your Honour."</p>

  <p>Shryock spoke up. "If you please, your Honour, Mrs. Bracker would like to
  testify in her own behalf concerning that needle."</p>

  <p>She was put on the stand and sworn. In her neat, close-fitting grey suit
  and shaped hat she was as smart as paint. Just the same she was a
  horrible-looking woman with those ghastly starved cheeks, and mouth like a
  red gash in her powdered face. She sat down, crossed her legs and spread her
  gloves on her knee with a great pretence of self-possession.</p>

  <p>"Do you admit buying the needle at Almon and Emory's?" asked Shryock
  smoothly.</p>

  <p>"Certainly. But that was not the one they found in my pocket."</p>

  <p>"One moment! Just confine yourself to answering my questions, please...For
  what purpose did you buy that needle?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I told Mrs. Julian I bought it for a friend," she said volubly,
  "but that was only a stall. I'm not an addict but I take cocaine occasionally
  for my neuralgia. And Dr. Cushack told me it was nicer to take it in liquid
  form. So I bought the needle. But I didn't like taking it that way, so I
  threw it away."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you threw it away. Where?"</p>

  <p>"One night when I was crossing Brooklyn Bridge in a taxi I threw it out of
  the window."</p>

  <p>"What about the needle that was found in your pocket?"</p>

  <p>"I know nothing about that!" she cried stridently. "It wasn't mine! It was
  planted on me!"</p>

  <p>"All right," said Shryock. "That's all." He turned to Rumsey. "Will you
  question her, Inspector?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Rumsey glumly.</p>

  <p>Shryock's next move was to put Liptrott on the stand. "When Ram Lal fell
  down dead in Mrs. Julian's boudoir," the lawyer sad, "I understand that you
  and these two people were seated behind him and to one side against the
  wall."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir." The old man was perfectly composed. "I was nearest to the
  Hindoo, then Mrs. Bracker, then the Doctor."</p>

  <p>"Did either of those persons move from their places while the séance was
  going on?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir. They never moved."</p>

  <p>"Are you sure?"</p>

  <p>"Sure I'm sure. They couldn't have reached the Hindoo without passing in
  front of me."</p>

  <p>"All right. Now I've got just one more question to ask you." Shryock
  glanced around the court as much as to say there was something good coming.
  "Can you tell me anything about the hypodermic needle that was found in Mrs.
  Bracker's pocket?"</p>

  <p>A foolish grin spread over the old man's face. He scratched his neck with
  a forefinger. "Sure," he said, "that was my needle. I planted it in her
  pocket."</p>

  <p>His words created a mild sensation in the room. All realised that what
  little was left of the Inspector's case had gone glimmering.</p>

  <p>"Why did you do that?" asked Shryock.</p>

  <p>"Well, when I seen Ram Lal was dead I thought maybe they'd try to hang it
  on me," the old man said with his witless grin. "I had the needle in my
  pocket, and I thought they'd make out I'd given him a shot of something since
  I was the nearest to him."</p>

  <p>"That's all," said Shryock in high satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"I protest, your Honour," said Rumsey indignantly. "This man is out of his
  wits. He's not a fit witness. I can prove it if you give me time."</p>

  <p>"Just a minute, Inspector," said the magistrate. "As I understand it, this
  man Liptrott is an addict. You found a bottle of cocaine on him, but no
  needle. Is that right?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Did you ever find his needle?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Then the chances are he's speaking the truth."</p>

  <p>"I insist he's not a proper witness," said Rumsey, snatching at anything
  to gain a moment or two.</p>

  <p>The magistrate shrugged. "Can you offer any evidence that Ram Lal died of
  poison?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No, your Honour."</p>

  <p>"Then it doesn't matter whether this man's testimony is proper or not. You
  have no case, Inspector. And I have no alternative but to..."</p>

  <p>He was interrupted by the entrance of Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>She entered by the side door smiling and beautifully dressed. She was
  carrying a small satchel and a man and a woman followed her; new witnesses, I
  assumed. They were unknown to me. Inspector Rumsey's glum face cleared as if
  by magic. A murmur of gratification travelled around the court&mdash;then
  dead silence. All knew her, of course, from her oft-published photographs. As
  a star attraction Mrs. Julian was nowhere alongside Mme. Storey. The people's
  silence seemed to say: Now we'll get a run for our money.</p>

  <p>And they did.</p>

  <h3>VIII</h3>

  <p class="first">Before I go on with my account of the magistrate's hearing I
  should explain that amongst the list of rare poisons furnished by Dr.
  Chisholm, there was one that could be quite simply prepared by distilling and
  redistilling a substance that is in universal use. This stuff may be
  purchased in any quantity from druggists or department stores, yet the poison
  derived from it is one of the deadliest known; moreover, it kills without
  leaving any trace of itself in the body.</p>

  <p>The process of distilling is now so generally understood, that all the
  doctors in the case agreed it would be against the public interest to
  advertise this formula. Consequently this poison was never named in the case,
  and of course I must not name it here. I will simply call the stuff X and the
  poison distillate DX.</p>

  <p>Magistrate McManigal greeted Mme. Storey gallantly and invited her to a
  place on the bench. As she seated herself she said:</p>

  <p>"I have brought a little additional evidence in this case."</p>

  <p>Ah! with what a sharp anxiety Cushack and Mrs. Bracker glanced at her
  then! The little doctor lost his nonchalance. Jim Shryock chewed the ends of
  his ragged moustache, sneering still.</p>

  <p>"Do you wish these persons to be called to the stand?" asked the
  magistrate.</p>

  <p>"First of all I would like Mrs. Bracker to answer a few questions if she
  is willing," she said politely.</p>

  <p>The woman glanced anxiously at Shryock, and he answered for her.
  "Certainly! She is not obliged to answer the questions unless it suits
  her."</p>

  <p>So Mrs. Bracker took the stand again.</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey began in a voice as mild as milk&mdash;it is at such moments
  that she is most to be feared: "I suppose you were well acquainted with Ram
  Lal through having met him at Mrs. Julian's so often."</p>

  <p>"No, indeed!" said Mrs. Bracker with a toss of her head. "I never aspired
  to be his friend. I had nothing whatever to do with him."</p>

  <p>"What is your explanation of his death?" asked Mme. Storey innocently.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I suppose he had a stroke of some sort. Not surprising with the life
  he led."</p>

  <p>"What about his life?"</p>

  <p>"Don't ask me! One couldn't help hearing stories about what went on at
  that elegant seraglio of his on Seventy-Ninth Street."</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey made no attempt to follow up this lead. "I suppose you have
  witnessed many of Ram Lal's séances at Mrs. Julian's?" she said.</p>

  <p>"Sure," was the indifferent reply.</p>

  <p>"Weren't you impressed by them?"</p>

  <p>"No!"</p>

  <p>"Then you believe they weren't genuine?"</p>

  <p>"He was just a common faker!" said Mrs. Bracker scornfully. "That's known
  now, isn't it? East Indian! Huh!"</p>

  <p>"But he seemed to me to be completely possessed," said Mme. Storey
  blandly; "to be lifted right out of himself as you might say."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Bracker merely laughed disagreeably.</p>

  <p>"Did they always end the same as yesterday in a sort of fit?"</p>

  <p>"Sure! That was part of his game."</p>

  <p>"But how could he fake that?" said Mme. Storey. "The frothing at the mouth
  and all."</p>

  <p>"Used to slip a wafer in his mouth," said Mrs. Bracker laughing. "Sort of
  soapy wafer. That made the froth. It's an old trick."</p>

  <p>"Did you see him do that?" asked Mme. Storey feigning to be greatly
  surprised.</p>

  <p>"Sure. I used to watch for it."</p>

  <p>"Did you see him do it yesterday?"</p>

  <p>"Sure. I saw his hands go up."</p>

  <p>"Thanks, that's all," said Mme. Storey unexpectedly.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Bracker stared at her hatefully. She felt that she had been tricked
  somehow. "What's that got to do with me?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"Nothing whatever," said Mme. Storey sweetly.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Bracker stepped down in somewhat of a fluster.</p>

  <p>"What do you expect to show by this line of questioning?" the magistrate
  asked Mme. Storey. We all pricked up our ears for her answer. She said: "The
  first assumption was that Ram Lal had been poisoned through being jabbed by a
  hypodermic needle. That theory won't hold water. I now aim to show that he
  was poisoned by the wafer which he took into his mouth a few seconds before
  he died."</p>

  <p>"But the poison, Madame?"</p>

  <p>"I'm coming to that," she said pleasantly. "...I should now like to put
  this woman on the stand that I have brought with me. Mrs. Euphemia Larkin.
  She is really Inspector Rumsey's witness, but he hasn't had an opportunity to
  talk to her. So if you will permit me I will question her."</p>

  <p>"Certainly," said the magistrate. "We are not sticklers for formality
  here. All we want is to bring out the truth."</p>

  <p>Shryock arose with his disagreeable smile. Just the same the man was a
  little worried. "Excuse me, your Honour, but it is five o'clock. I'm sorry to
  have to mention it, but I have an important engagement..."</p>

  <p>You could hear the whole room take a breath. They were afraid that the
  curtain was going to be rung down just at the most exciting moment. Well, his
  Honour was only human and he didn't want to miss the dénouement either.</p>

  <p>"Will it take long?" he asked Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"Less than ten minutes, your Honour."</p>

  <p>"We will proceed."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Larkin was a typical New York Irish char woman, a racy specimen.
  Still youngish and not at all bad-looking, she proudly displayed her Sunday
  clothes on the witness stand. A little intimidated by finding all eyes upon
  her, she was nevertheless enjoying her conspicuousness.</p>

  <p>"What is your employment, Mrs. Larkin?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"Cleaning woman in the Stilson Building on Forty-Second Street,
  ma'am."</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey opened the satchel she had brought and took from it two
  square-sided quart bottles such as druggists use, a piece of wrapping paper,
  a length of string and a pink ticket. "Do you recognise these things?"</p>

  <p>"Sure!" said Mrs. Larkin. "Them's the things I give you in my rooms a
  half-hour ago."</p>

  <p>"Where did you get them?"</p>

  <p>"Picked 'em out of the waste basket in room 1014 of my building."</p>

  <p>"You can swear that it was room 1014?"</p>

  <p>"Sure! Them's druggists' bottles, and 1014 is a doctor's office sort of,
  with a laboratory and all."</p>

  <p>"When did you find them there?"</p>

  <p>"Night before last at cleaning time."</p>

  <p>"You are sure of the time?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely. I mind taking them home with me."</p>

  <p>"What did you take them home for?"</p>

  <p>"Well, bottles come in handy," said Mrs. Larkin with a grin that set the
  whole court roaring. "As for the paper I took that to wrap the bottles in.
  They had come in that paper because the creases just fitted. And the
  string."</p>

  <p>"How about this pink ticket?"</p>

  <p>"That's a sales ticket from the cut-price drug-store in the Stilson
  Building. I pick up a lot of them in the waste baskets. If you save them till
  you get a hundred dollars' worth they give you a dollar credit in the
  store."</p>

  <p>"Who is the tenant in room 1014?"</p>

  <p>"Dr. A. Cushack."</p>

  <p>"Do you know him?"</p>

  <p>"No'm. He's always gone home before I do my work."</p>

  <p>"That's all, thank you," said Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Larkin stepped down, a little disappointed that her turn had been so
  brief.</p>

  <p>"If Dr. Cushack is willing to testify as to these bottles..." Mme. Storey
  began politely.</p>

  <p>He was already on his feet. "Sure!" he cried. "I want the court to know
  what was in them!" He took the stand with a truculent air. The word natty
  might have been coined to describe that little man. A day in jail had rubbed
  none of the bloom off him. He pretended to be swelling with indignation like
  a little turkey cock.</p>

  <p>"You admit, then, that these were your bottles," said Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"I can't identify them," he said with a conceited laugh, "but if she says
  she got them out of my waste basket it's all right with me...Tell the judge
  what was in them."</p>

  <p>"Each bottle contained X," said Mme. Storey carelessly.</p>

  <p>"Yeah, X!" he cried, thrusting out his chin at her. "I use it in my lab.
  work. I couldn't do anything without it. Everybody uses X for one thing or
  another. Thousands of bottles are sold every day. Is there any harm in
  X?"</p>

  <p>"Why, no," said Mme. Storey. "...But a little goes a long way. I was just
  surprised that you used so much."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't know how long I've had those bottles on hand."</p>

  <p>That was his first slip. "I know," said Mme. Storey quietly. "You bought
  them the same day."</p>

  <p>He stared at her speechlessly. She merely exhibited the sales slip.</p>

  <p>"You can't prove anything by that!" he cried. "They don't enter the items
  on the sales slips. Only the amounts."</p>

  <p>"Quite," said Mme. Storey. "The bottles are each marked thirty-nine cents.
  The slip is for seventy-eight."</p>

  <p>"That doesn't prove anything. It's only a coincidence. Half the articles
  they sell are priced at thirty-nine cents."</p>

  <p>"Well, what else did you buy that day?" She glanced at the slip. "February
  ninth."</p>

  <p>He was dumb.</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey gave him a brief respite. It was her way with a witness.
  "What's your idea of this case?" she asked confidentially. "Was Ram Lal
  poisoned?"</p>

  <p>He rose to it immediately. "It's an open question," he said importantly.
  "As a toxicologist I aspire to do a little investigating myself when I get
  out. It's an interesting case!"</p>

  <p>She returned to the charge. "What did you do with two quarts of X the day
  before yesterday?"</p>

  <p>"I was conducting an experiment," he answered warily.</p>

  <p>"Of what nature?"</p>

  <p>"I refuse to answer. I make my living out of my experiments."</p>

  <p>"No other drugs were found in your laboratory."</p>

  <p>"Well, I used everything up."</p>

  <p>"What did you do with the result of your experiment that day?"</p>

  <p>"Poured it down the wash-basin. It was unsuccessful."</p>

  <p>"Then why not tell me what other drugs you used; where you got them and so
  on."</p>

  <p>"Why should I?" he parried.</p>

  <p>"Ever hear of distillate of X?" she asked casually.</p>

  <p>Some of the pink faded out of his cheeks. "Yes," he said. "Poisons are my
  speciality."</p>

  <p>"You are familiar with its properties then?"</p>

  <p>He hesitated briefly before answering. "I have read about it. Never
  experimented with it."</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey started on another line. "Where did you go when..."</p>

  <p>He interrupted her excitedly. "No, you don't! I perceive what you're
  after! You can't make an insinuation like that before the court without
  following it up!"</p>

  <p>"All right," she said good-naturedly. "I'll follow it up. Did you make
  distillate of X in your laboratory the day before yesterday?"</p>

  <p>"No!" he shouted. "It's false!" He wiped his face.</p>

  <p>"What time did you leave the office that day?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't remember," he said sullenly.</p>

  <p>"Now come," she said cajolingly; "only the day before yesterday."</p>

  <p>"About six," he muttered.</p>

  <p>"Where did you go?"</p>

  <p>"Home."</p>

  <p>"By the way, where do you live? I don't think I have been told."</p>

  <p>"Hotel Shirley."</p>

  <p>"Oh, the Shirley. Did anyone there see you come in?"</p>

  <p>"I got my key from the desk as usual. It's not likely the clerk could
  remember that night amongst the others."</p>

  <p>"Where did you dine?"</p>

  <p>"At the hotel."</p>

  <p>"Alone?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Do you always occupy the same seat?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"With the same people more or less at the surrounding tables?"</p>

  <p>He saw where these apparently innocent questions were tending, and turned
  scared and stubborn. "I won't answer!" he cried shrilly. "I won't answer any
  more. If you're trying to pin this thing on me I don't have to answer!"</p>

  <p>"Why, of course not!" said Mme. Storey with undisturbed good humour. "You
  may step down."</p>

  <p>She then called the man she had brought with her, a lean young fellow with
  a bright eye. His name was given as John Withy; his occupation, free-lance
  writer.</p>

  <p>"Where do you live?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Number &mdash;&mdash; West Forty-Seventh Street."</p>

  <p>"What sort of building is that?"</p>

  <p>"An old residence which has been rebuilt into stores, offices and small
  apartments. It's a walk-up building."</p>

  <p>"Where are your rooms?"</p>

  <p>"I have a one-room and bath apartment third floor rear."</p>

  <p>"Have you ever before seen the man who last testified here, Dr.
  Cushack?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, ma'am. Saw him in my building day before yesterday. That was
  Wednesday. About six-thirty p.m."</p>

  <p>"Under what circumstances?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I was coming home to wash up for dinner and I found him standing in
  the hall outside my door. Seemed funny, hanging around like that. So I left
  my door open when I went in to sort of keep an eye on him. My friend who
  lives in the front is out of town, and I thought maybe he aimed to get in
  there. But another fellow came upstairs in a minute or two, and it seemed
  this one was just waiting for him. The second fellow was the man who rents
  the hall room next to mine. Alfred Somers is the name in his letter-box
  downstairs."</p>

  <p>"Did you hear what they said to each other?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"Just a word or two. Somers says: 'Have you got it?' and this
  man"&mdash;he nodded in the direction of Dr. Cushack&mdash;"says: 'Yeah.'
  Somers says: 'Come on in,' and they went into his room. This sounded kind of
  mysterious to me, and I wanted to hear more. There is an old door between my
  room and Somers' which is locked now and the cracks stuffed with paper. I put
  my ear to the crack and I hear Somers say: 'How can I fix the wafer with
  this?' And this man said: 'Just pour a few drops on it and let it soak in.'
  That was all I could hear, and I thought nothing of it at the time."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Withy," said Mme. Storey with delicate impressiveness, "I want you to
  look around this courtroom and see if you can pick out the man you know as
  Alfred Somers."</p>

  <p>I jumped, her move was so absolutely unexpected. A breathless silence fell
  on the courtroom as young Withy's eyes passed from face to face. It was
  apparent to all that this Somers must be the actual murderer of Ram Lal.</p>

  <p>Withy's eyes travelled slowly along the front bench, came to Bunbury and
  stopped there. "Why," he said in a surprised voice, "why, that's the
  man!"</p>

  <p>Court and spectators were held in a spell. Bunbury jumped up with a face
  as grey as ashes; then dropped back in his seat laughing. From the end of the
  bench Jim Shryock laughed loudly to create a diversion. As for me, I was
  stony with astonishment.</p>

  <p>Shryock was quickly on his feet. "Your Honour, I must protest!" he cried.
  "This accusation is laughable, but is likely to do serious harm to a faithful
  servant and an honest man! Why, Bunbury has been working for Mrs. Julian for
  eight years. What possible motive..."</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon," interrupted Mme. Storey with a wicked smile, "are you
  representing Bunbury too?"</p>

  <p>She had him there, but he didn't care so long as there was no jury
  present. "No!" he cried theatrically. "My words are dictated by motives of
  humanity."</p>

  <p>She enjoyed a little private laugh at the notion that Jim Shryock had
  taken a case out of humanity.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Bunbury, may I have the privilege of representing you here?" asked
  Shryock with a bow.</p>

  <p>"Please do," mumbled the butler. He was a wretched figure then.</p>

  <p>"Then I ask again," shouted Shryock, "what possible motive could this man
  have had for committing such a crime?"</p>

  <p>"This is only a preliminary hearing," said Mme. Storey, "and it's not
  necessary to try the whole case. However, I am perfectly willing to give you
  the information. It is true that Bunbury has been working for Mrs. Julian for
  eight years. During that time a whole procession of fakers and charlatans has
  succeeded in wheedling great sums of money out of his mistress. Naturally, it
  made him sore to see all that going out of the house. He began to wonder if
  he couldn't divert the golden stream in his own direction. The knowledge of
  Mrs. Julian's character that he had gained, and his familiarity with every
  detail of her life and affairs gave him a special advantage. Naturally, he
  couldn't swindle her in his own person, so he engaged catspaws as they came
  along, Mrs. Bracker, Dr. Cushack, Ram Lal, and taught them how to do it."</p>

  <p>"We have only your word for this, Madame," said Shryock sarcastically.
  "And you still haven't answered my question. If Ram Lal was Bunbury's own
  man, why in heaven's name should he murder him?"</p>

  <p>"Because Ram Lal held out on him," said Mme. Storey sweetly. "It was
  partly out of revenge, and partly as an object lesson to the other faithful
  workers. Mrs. Julian has furnished me with a list of all the sums she has
  given these three people with the dates. On the other hand my operatives have
  secured lists of Bunbury's deposits in his several bank accounts.</p>

  <p>"These lists will be offered in evidence, of course, and we will show that
  for every payment made by Mrs. Julian, Bunbury deposited half the amount next
  day. With one exception. Mrs. Julian gave Ram Lal one hundred thousand
  dollars two weeks ago. Bunbury got none of that."</p>

  <p>Shryock shrugged elaborately. It was all he could do. "Well, when I see
  your evidence," he said with a sneer, "I'll meet it."</p>

  <p>"It is sufficient," said Magistrate McManigal. "I will hold these two
  persons as accessories before the fact. Inspector, I presume you will take
  care of Bunbury."</p>

  <p>"I will, your Honour," said Rumsey grimly.</p>

  <p>Bunbury had already recovered himself by the time they came to lead him
  out. He was a very remarkable man. His vanity was hurt by the recollection of
  that moment of weakness, and he was bound to make a good exit. He walked to
  where Mrs. Julian sat, and made a low bow.</p>

  <p>"My keys, Madam," he said, handing them over: "I trust you will find
  everything in order at home."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Julian was too much overcome to say a word.</p>

  <p>Bunbury then faced the policeman who was ready to attend him. "Keep your
  hands off me," he said with dignity. "I shall make no resistance." He then
  walked out with the air of a martyr going proudly to the stake. If it had
  been in the theatre he would certainly have got a big hand.</p>

  <h3>IX</h3>

  <p class="first">Mme. Storey, Inspector Rumsey and I had dinner in a little
  Italian restaurant on Fifty-Second Street where the spaghetti with anchovies
  is something to dream about. We all felt the blessed sense of relaxation that
  follows on the completion of a tough bit of work. It was fun to hold a sort
  of post-mortem on the case.</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey said: "The first thing that struck me was that Ram Lal was a
  stupid fellow playing a clever part. Particularly after I got his history
  from the police. Before the Ram Lal episode he was nothing but a sneak thief,
  the lowest order of crooks. This suggested that he must have been drilled in
  the art of crystal-gazing. His whole spiel sounded like something learned by
  rote.</p>

  <p>"When I watched Mrs. Bracker and Cushack and read the transcript of their
  examination by the police I saw that they also were much too stupid to have
  thought up the parts they were playing&mdash;both parts, by the way,
  devilishly well calculated to deceive a woman of Mrs. Julian's character.
  There was a certain affinity too, in all these games. This put the idea into
  my head that there was a superior intelligence directing all three of
  them."</p>

  <p>"When did you begin to suspect Bunbury?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Just as soon as I decided there was a master mind behind the three
  puppets, my intuition suggested that it was Bunbury. Many little straws
  pointed in that direction. Bunbury was the only person who possessed the
  requisite knowledge of Mrs. Julian's character. Believe me, nothing can be
  hidden from our servants! Then I learned from Mrs. Julian that Bunbury had
  been instrumental in getting the previous lot of fakers fired. All except
  Liptrott, whom he probably regarded as harmless. And for one brief moment in
  the boudoir I had a glimpse of the power that underlay the butler's smooth
  mask. He quelled Cushack and Mrs. Bracker with a word...But on the whole it
  was chiefly a question of style."</p>

  <p>"Style?" we echoed.</p>

  <p>"Style is a mysterious thing," she went on. "You can't describe it, but
  you can feel it. You have noticed I suppose, that Bunbury talks in a style of
  false elegance. Upper servants are much given to it. 'Elegant,' by the way,
  is one of the words that are frequently on his lips. Few use it nowadays.</p>

  <p>"Well, in Ram Lal, in Mrs. Bracker and in Dr. Cushack I kept hearing
  echoes of Bunbury's style. It is largely in the use to which words are put.
  Besides 'elegant' notice how every one of them says 'perceive,' a book word,
  when he means 'see.' And the word 'aspire,' generally used in an incorrect
  sense, is continually on their lips. Besides others. When pupils are taught
  by rote the master's voice may be clearly heard.</p>

  <p>"It is obvious that master minds do not work for nothing, and when I
  checked up what Mrs. Julian had paid out with what Bunbury had received, the
  motive for the crime became obvious. Ram Lal was too successful. He felt that
  he had become independent of his master. He had defied the master, and so he
  had to be made to feel his power."</p>

  <p>"But," I objected, "if it was Bunbury who warned us, when we got to the
  house he tried to keep us out of the boudoir!"</p>

  <p>"Think back, Bella," she said with a smile. "The objections he raised were
  of a sort to make us determined to enter!...It is one thing to know who
  committed a crime and another to produce sufficient evidence to obtain a
  conviction," she went on. "The men I assigned to watch Mrs. Julian's house
  followed Bunbury to his room on Forty-Seventh Street, and so we discovered
  where he was accustomed to meet and instruct his accomplices. His Academy of
  Faking you might call it. But by the time they could get inside he had made a
  clean sweep of everything in the nature of evidence, of course. Bunbury made
  no such clumsy mistake as Cushack who threw the bottles in his waste
  basket.</p>

  <p>"I questioned a dozen people in the house before I turned up ore in the
  person of Withy. However, the word 'wafer' which Withy overheard had no
  significance until after I had tricked Mrs. Bracker into testifying that Ram
  Lal had taken a wafer. Then it took on a deadly effect. When one of these
  watertight crimes once springs a leak, it is all over."</p>

  <p>"It's lucky for the sake of justice that Bunbury telephoned you that day,"
  remarked Rumsey.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that was his weakness," said Mme. Storey. "Like all criminals of his
  type, Bunbury is devoured by a secret vanity. The result of too many years'
  suppression as a butler perhaps. When his plot was all ready to shoot he was
  so crazy about it, it looked so absolutely detection proof, that he couldn't
  bear to let it work unseen. So he gave me a ring. It was obviously an
  afterthought because his associates were not informed of it. And he might
  have got away with it, too, had it not been for his fatal style!"</p>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">The seats sent to Madame Storey and I were in row S about
  half-way back in the immense auditorium; the opera was <i>Siegfried</i>. The
  Terwilliger box was still unoccupied when the curtain went up, and I had to
  possess my soul in patience during the long first act, which was played to a
  completely darkened house. I was so excited I could give less than half my
  attention to the music. Owing to the prominence of the persons concerned, our
  new case bade fair to be one of the biggest things Mme. Storey had ever
  undertaken. Terwilliger is a name to conjure with all over the world. The
  Terwilligers are our Rothschilds.</p>

  <p>The moment the lights went up I turned my head over my shoulder. The
  Terwilliger box is in the centre of the golden horseshoe; that is to say,
  where the royal box would be if this did not happen to be a republic. The
  party had come. In the right-hand corner I recognised the effulgent Mrs.
  Terwilliger in green velvet and diamonds, but the other two ladies were
  strangers to me. Neither could I identify the three gentlemen in the
  obscurity of the back of the box. I speculated vainly upon which might be Dr.
  Felix Portal, head of the Terwilliger Institute, and an even more famous man,
  if that is possible, than his wealthy patron. It was Dr. Portal who was
  responsible for our presence in the opera house that night.</p>

  <p>We did not immediately leave our seats for the intermission, since we had
  no wish to advertise our presence generally in the foyer. We waited until
  people were beginning to drift back down the aisles before we got up and
  mixed with the gossiping, cigarette-smoking throng outside. When the bell
  rang to give warning of the second act we scurried along like everybody else,
  and so contrived it that the rising of the curtain found us in the secluded
  corridor back of the parterre boxes. It was quickly emptied of all save
  ourselves. When we were satisfied nobody was observing us, we opened the door
  leading into the Terwilliger box.</p>

  <p>The door does not lead directly into the box but into a charming little
  ante-room furnished like the rest of the magnificent old building in red and
  gold. There were dainty little sofas and chairs with curved legs as in a
  boudoir. We were separated from the box proper by heavy velvet curtains which
  are kept closely drawn during the performance. As we entered, the curtains
  parted and a man whom I knew must be Dr. Portal joined us with a polite
  smile.</p>

  <p>As in the case of most great men one's first impression was disappointing.
  He was a small man, and instead of the noble and venerable head I expected, I
  beheld a somewhat sharp physiognomy with a long nose and a retreating
  forehead. But I had not been a moment in his company before the real
  distinction of the man became apparent. I observed that the back part of his
  head was fine and full, and that, they say, holds the really important part
  of the brain. He had a noble eye, too, blue and gleaming with an inward fire.
  It had the curiously remote glance of one who dwells mostly in the realm of
  thought. It expressed an attractive compound of wisdom and innocence. His
  voice too, had the measured quality of one who thinks before he speaks. Oh,
  there was no doubt that he was one of the exceptional men of our time.</p>

  <p>Outside, the auditorium had been darkened again and the violins were
  making the whole house throb with feeling. It provided a strange
  accompaniment to the interview which followed. There was a deprecating
  quality in Dr. Portal's smile that was very winning, considering what a great
  man he was. In other words, he was a little in awe of the beautiful Madame
  Storey.</p>

  <p>"So good of you to respond to my appeal for aid!" he murmured.</p>

  <p>"Not at all," she answered quickly. "I feel flattered in receiving an
  appeal from you." And she meant it. She brought me up. "My secretary, Miss
  Brickley. I want her to take notes of what you tell me, so that I won't have
  to waste your time by asking you to repeat any of it later."</p>

  <p>We sat down, Mme. Storey and Dr. Portal side by side on a little sofa, and
  me facing them with my note-book on my knee. Once the courteous greetings had
  been exchanged, deep harassed lines appeared in the famous scientist's face.
  Whatever this business might be, clearly it was no joke to him. He showed a
  curious petulance also, as if the scientist in him resented being dragged
  down from the calm realms of thought.</p>

  <p>"You will think the manner of this appointment very strange," he said.
  "The truth is, I find myself followed and watched wherever I go, and I wished
  to keep it a secret, at least for the present, that I was consulting
  you."</p>

  <p>"You did right," said Mme. Storey. "Please go on."</p>

  <p>The voice of the young Siegfried was now ringing through the house,
  supported by the murmuring violins. It lent an almost unbearably emotional
  effect to the doctor's tale of murder.</p>

  <p>"It concerns the shocking accident which happened at the Institute a month
  ago," he began. "My principal assistant, Dr. Edgar McComb, was found shot
  dead in his office. I suppose you read of it at the time. It has attracted
  very little notice simply because there were no sensational circumstances to
  whet the public appetite. Now that a month has passed it remains just as much
  of a mystery as it was on the morning the body was discovered. The police
  pretend to be working upon the case still, but they have nothing to go on. No
  clues of any sort. Nobody saw the assailant enter or leave the building; no
  finger-prints were found in the room save those of the doctor himself. And
  what is even more baffling, no possible motive for the crime has been
  unearthed. Dr. McComb had no enemies; no difficulties either financial or
  amatory. He was happily married, and his private life was a model of
  regularity. Some have thought it must have been the chance act of a madman,
  but that theory won't hold water either; because the doctor must have made an
  appointment to meet his assailant in the laboratory that night, and must have
  admitted him to the building. What is more, they were heard talking quietly
  together shortly before the shot must have been fired."</p>

  <p>"Who heard them talking?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"The night watchman, Amadeo Corioli. In making his rounds through the
  bacteriological laboratory at ten o'clock he saw a light in Dr. McComb's
  office, and heard the sound of quiet voices as he passed the closed door. An
  hour later, when he passed, the light was out, and he supposed the doctor had
  gone home. Either Dr. McComb or I or both of us often worked in the
  laboratory until late. The body was discovered by the cleaning women in the
  morning."</p>

  <p>"But a month has passed, doctor," said Mme. Storey reproachfully. "What
  can I hope to do with so cold a trail?...Why didn't you consult me
  sooner?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, I wish I had! I wish I had!" he said with a painful gesture. "But to
  tell you the truth, it never came close to me until a few days ago. I was
  content to leave it to the police."</p>

  <p>"Never came close to you?" said my employer. "What do you mean by
  that?"</p>

  <p>He answered her indirectly. His agitation was visibly increasing. "True,
  the morning after the tragedy," he said, "Mrs. McComb, who was in a highly
  hysterical state, accused me in veiled terms of being responsible for her
  husband's death. I was inexpressibly shocked by the scene, but naturally I
  ascribed it to her condition. I never gave it a moment's thought until two or
  three days ago when I noticed that I was being watched and followed. It was a
  strange experience for me to have!...Then I began to perceive that the
  attitude of those who surround me at the Institute had changed subtly.
  Something ugly had come into their regard." The speaker shuddered. "Ugh! it
  was horrible! Finally I demanded an explanation from one of the young doctors
  in whom I have confidence. He told me..." For the moment Mr. Portal seemed to
  be unable to continue. "He told me," he said brokenly, "that a story was
  going around that I, actuated by a mean jealousy of a brilliant rising man,
  had procured the death of Edgar McComb!"</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey and I gazed at him incredulously. It seemed impossible to
  believe that one whom the whole world looked upon as the high priest of
  science should be mixed up in anything like this!</p>

  <p>In his agitation Dr. Portal sprang up and struck his clenched hands
  against his breast. Fortunately the swelling music drowned the sound of his
  voice. "Me! Me!" he cried; "accused of murder! Me, whose life has been as
  open as the day! Whose every thought has been given to my work! Is it not
  unjust? Is it not incredible that such a story should be circulated and
  believed? My informant said that he didn't believe it, but that there was no
  chance of stopping it now!"</p>

  <p>"They circulate it, but I doubt if they believe it," said Mme. Storey
  gravely. "It is a common human failing."</p>

  <p>"But how terrible...how terrible to be the victim of such a slander!"
  cried Dr. Portal brokenly. "It has completely unnerved me! It comes between
  me and my work. I can do nothing! And my work has reached a fatally critical
  point where every ounce of ability that I possess is required of me. The
  polio serum..."</p>

  <p>"What is polio?" asked Mme. Storey quickly.</p>

  <p>"Ah, pardon!" he said, with a distracted gesture. "A bit of laboratory
  slang. Polio is short for poliomyelitis or infantile paralysis. I have been
  working on it for many years. I have not yet succeeded in isolating the
  bacillus, but I have prepared a serum from the blood of immune monkeys which,
  in the case of monkeys anyhow, arrests the paralysis. I am not quite ready
  for human experiments, but I soon will be&mdash;if I am only left in
  peace!...Meanwhile the number of cases is daily increasing. Everything points
  to a coming epidemic. There is not a day to lose!"</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey, too, had risen. She had instantly made up her mind as to the
  rights of this case. "How proud I will be if I can contribute to your work by
  ever so little!" she said, impulsively taking his hand. "I beg of you to put
  this preposterous slander out of your mind, and return to your work. Leave
  this to me. I promise you if I live I will lay it in its grave for ever!"</p>

  <p>The doctor, as a man will, immediately began to make light of his own
  emotion. "There...there," he said, shaking her hand, "my mind is relieved
  already. I feel safe in your hands. As for the expenses connected with this
  affair..."</p>

  <p>"Not a word as to that," she said, holding up her hand. "That's my
  part...All you have to do is to answer a few questions...Where were you on
  the night Dr. McComb was shot?"</p>

  <p>"Fortunately I can produce an alibi," he answered with a wry smile. "I
  attended a reception at the National History Museum to visiting British
  scientists. Hundreds of people must have seen me there...However," he went on
  bitterly, "I understand that I am not accused of firing the shot myself. They
  believe that I had it done."</p>

  <p>"What exactly did Mrs. McComb say to you on the morning after?"</p>

  <p>"She said: 'This is your work! This is your work! Now I hope you're
  satisfied! For years you have been trying to keep him down, and when you
  found you could no longer do so you turned to <i>this</i>!' And much more to
  the same effect. No precise charge."</p>

  <p>"Hm! jealousy," remarked Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, that had often peeped out," said Dr. Portal. "Such a pity! So
  unnecessary!"</p>

  <p>"What sort of woman is Mrs. McComb?"</p>

  <p>"A good enough sort as women go," answered Dr. Portal carelessly. "Highly
  conventional. Ambitious. On that account I considered her influence over her
  husband unfortunate. A scientist cannot afford to consider ambition; he
  cannot consider anything in the world but science!"</p>

  <p>"You have not much use for women, I take it, doctor," suggested Mme.
  Storey with a dry smile.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I wouldn't say that," he protested. "Have I not put myself in your
  hands?...The only thing I have against women is that they demand too much
  time. For me life is not long enough to include both science and women."</p>

  <p>"It is a pity," murmured Mme. Storey. "Where is Mrs. McComb now?"</p>

  <p>"She has gone abroad. I believe Mrs. Terwilliger sent her."</p>

  <p>"Ah! a mistake in tactics. Perhaps we will have to bring her back...Now
  tell me what you can about the crime, doctor."</p>

  <p>"That is next to nothing," he said, spreading out his hands.</p>

  <p>"You have spoken of the bacteriological laboratory. What sort of a place
  is it?"</p>

  <p>"It is a small separate building connected with a main group by a covered
  passage. Dr. McComb and I have been working there exclusively during the past
  year. The monkeys that we use in our experiments are kept on the top floor.
  Some of them are sick, you see, and there is a male nurse on duty throughout
  the night just as if they were human. Dr. McComb's private office and my
  office were on the floor below."</p>

  <p>"The nurse heard no sound?"</p>

  <p>"No, Madame. The walls are thick."</p>

  <p>"Describe the finding of the body."</p>

  <p>"It was found by a cleaning woman at eight o'clock on the morning of
  November 9th. When she opened the door she saw the doctor slumped down in his
  chair with a bullet-hole in his forehead. His body was already stiff. He had
  evidently been shot from in front as he sat upright in his chair. The bullet
  had gone completely through his head and had lodged in the hard plaster of
  the wall behind him. A curious thing was, that the murderer had gone to the
  trouble to dig it out of the plaster and carry it away with him."</p>

  <p>"Nothing strange in that," remarked Mme. Storey. "He had evidently heard
  of the new science of ballistics which enables us sometimes to trace the
  bullet back to the gun from which it was fired."</p>

  <p>"Another strange feature," Dr. Portal went on, "is that the body was
  stripped of every trifling article of value; a seal ring, a cheap watch and a
  dollar or two in money, which was the most the doctor ever carried. It seems
  incredible that a man should be murdered for that."</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey made no comment.</p>

  <p>"Moreover," said the doctor, "the unfortunate man must have made an
  appointment to meet the murderer in the laboratory, for there was no work to
  call him back that night. We had discussed it in the afternoon. And he must
  have let the man in himself. Why should he have made an appointment with a
  robber?"</p>

  <p>"Obviously robbery was not the murderer's main object," said Mme. Storey.
  "But having killed his man, he saw no reason why he should overlook any
  little objects of value. From that I infer the shot was fired by a
  professional criminal."</p>

  <p>"Now I call that clever!" said Dr. Portal admiringly. "Already we are
  making progress."</p>

  <p>"But we have a long, long way to go," said Mme. Storey, smiling. "How
  about the Italian watchman?"</p>

  <p>"He has been repeatedly questioned by the police. No suspicion attaches to
  him, I understand. He can account for every minute of his time that night by
  the time clocks he is obliged to punch as he makes his rounds through the
  buildings."</p>

  <p>"But it only takes a fraction of a second to shoot a man," Mme. Storey
  pointed out.</p>

  <p>"What object would he have? He knew Dr. McComb carried nothing of value
  upon him?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said Mme. Storey frankly. "Have you any theory as to what
  happened?"</p>

  <p>"None whatever," said Dr. Portal, spreading out his hands. "All I can tell
  you is, that McComb appeared to me to be in a highly nervous state during the
  last days of his life. But I have no idea what was troubling him."</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey and I left the opera house in a curious state of exaltation
  induced by the insinuating violins and the poignant tenor voice. I felt (and
  Mme. Storey confessed the same) that we were like two crusaders sallying
  forth to do battle for the benefactor of mankind against the powers of
  evil.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">We proceeded directly to my employer's little house on East
  Sixty &mdash;&mdash; Street. It was still something short of ten o'clock, and
  Mme. Storey telephoned immediately to Inspector Rumsey. Upon being assured
  that the matter was of first-rate importance, the Inspector said he would
  motor right down to join us.</p>

  <p>Inspector Rumsey glanced at Mme. Storey with pleasure when he came in. He
  is a little man of quite undistinguished appearance whose whole study it is
  to render himself still more inconspicuous. Ordinarily his face is as
  inscrutable as one of the little crooks whom it is his business to track
  down, but in my employer's presence he relaxes and becomes quite human. He is
  a first-class police official and absolutely incorruptible.</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey went directly to the point. "Are you keeping Dr. Felix Portal
  under surveillance?"</p>

  <p>"I am," he answered unhesitatingly.</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Well," he said deprecatingly, "I received an anonymous letter suggesting
  that he was responsible for the death of Edgar McComb."</p>

  <p>"An anonymous letter!" said Mme. Storey disgustedly.</p>

  <p>"Sure," he said calmly; "I despise them as much as you do. But in a case
  of this sort where I was absolutely up against it I could not afford to
  ignore it. The letter was typewritten on a sheet of cheap paper, and it had
  been mailed in the corridor of the general post office. I have been unable to
  trace it."</p>

  <p>"What did it say?"</p>

  <p>"It said: 'The story is going around that Dr. Portal did for Dr. McComb.
  You had better look into it.'...How did you become interested in the case, if
  I may ask?"</p>

  <p>"Between ourselves," said Mme. Storey, "Dr. Portal has consulted me."</p>

  <p>"You mean he has engaged you to solve this mystery?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Well, that was a bold move!"</p>

  <p>"If he is guilty it would be. But surely you do not think that he..."</p>

  <p>"I have no opinion," said Inspector Rumsey, spreading out his hands. "All
  my investigation has shown is that he <i>might</i> have done it."</p>

  <p>"But, good heavens!" cried Mme. Storey, sitting upright, "why should he
  have done it?"</p>

  <p>"Professional jealousy," suggested the Inspector. "Dr. McComb, a much
  younger man, had been making great strides lately. His name was continually
  in the newspapers."</p>

  <p>"But Dr. Portal is not the man to care about that," said Mme. Storey.
  "Look you, for fifteen years he's been at the head of the Terwilliger
  Institute and one of the most conspicuous citizens of New York. Yet one
  almost never meets him at public functions. And in all those years I have
  never seen a published photograph of him. I did not know him to-night until
  he introduced himself. Is that the record of a man who is keen about
  newspaper publicity?"</p>

  <p>Inspector Rumsey did not answer.</p>

  <p>"It is sacrilege to think a man like that in connection with a sordid
  murder!" Mme. Storey went on earnestly. "I should say if there is <i>one</i>
  disinterested man in this world of money-grubbers that man was Felix
  Portal!"</p>

  <p>"Even so," said the Inspector with quiet obstinacy, "everybody knows that
  the higher the flights a man is capable of, the lower he may fall. The whole
  history of crime testifies to it."</p>

  <p>"You have several children, haven't you?" said Mme. Storey, suddenly
  taking a new line. "What are their ages?"</p>

  <p>"The youngest is three and the oldest eleven," said the Inspector with a
  smile.</p>

  <p>"All within the danger limits for infantile paralysis," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"Don't speak of it!" he said with a painful gesture. "It's a
  nightmare!"</p>

  <p>"They say we are headed straight for an epidemic."</p>

  <p>"It's horrible!" cried the Inspector. "A man is so helpless! When I see it
  coming I wish I could send them all up on a mountain top where they could be
  cut off from everybody!"</p>

  <p>"That's what Dr. Portal is working on now," said Mme. Storey quietly;
  "working to save your children, all the children. He had almost attained
  success when this..."</p>

  <p>Inspector Rumsey fairly groaned in his distress. "I've got to do my duty.
  I had hoped that he would never hear this story. Never discover that he was
  being watched."</p>

  <p>"Well, he knows it now," she said gravely, "and his work is at a
  standstill...You say he <i>might</i> have done it," she presently went on,
  "but he says he was at the Natural History Museum all evening where hundreds
  of people saw him."</p>

  <p>"That is true and not true," said the Inspector. "He made a speech of
  welcome at nine o'clock and of course everybody in the building saw and heard
  him. But after he stepped down from the platform at nine-twenty, I am unable
  to find anybody who saw him until supper was served at eleven."</p>

  <p>"That is no proof that he wasn't there."</p>

  <p>"No, but unfortunately I have learned that a taxicab was called to the
  museum at nine-thirty, and that a man was driven from there to the corner of
  Avenue A and Seventy-Fourth Street, which, as you know, is just around the
  corner from the Institute. Well, if he could taxi over there he could taxi
  back, of course, in plenty of time for supper."</p>

  <p>"Did this passenger resemble Dr. Portal?" Mme. Storey asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Ah, there we are up against it again. The driver of that taxi has left
  his job, and I have not been able to find him."</p>

  <p>"Pretty slim evidence," suggested Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"Surely," he agreed. "But in the face of it, how can I give up watching
  Dr. Portal."</p>

  <p>"Well, now the situation is somewhat altered," she said. "Dr. Portal has
  engaged me to solve this mystery. That's pretty strong evidence of his good
  faith in the matter. If I assure you that I mean to devote my whole time to
  the case, are you willing to call off your dogs? You and I will still be
  working together, of course."</p>

  <p>"Sure," cried the Inspector heartily. "And darn glad of the excuse to let
  up on the doctor!"</p>

  <p>They shook hands on it.</p>

  <p>"Now tell me all you know about the case," said Mme. Storey, lighting a
  fresh cigarette.</p>

  <p>It required a full hour for the Inspector to relate all the work he and
  his men had done. I shall not weary you with the recital, for there was
  little of it that proved to be of any service to us. Nothing in Dr. McComb's
  past life, nor in Dr. Portal's either, threw any light on the crime. In an
  association of five years they had never been known to quarrel, or even to
  have a serious difference of any kind. The only thing in the way of complete
  harmony was Dr. McComb's ambition&mdash;and that was mostly Mrs.
  McComb's.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact Mme. Storey had to begin from the beginning. It was a
  single word dropped by Inspector Rumsey which gave her her lead. In one of
  the gossiping stories patiently run down by the police, a young interne of
  the Institute had used the phrase: "As it was told to me, Dr. Portal hired a
  gunman to put McComb out of the way." This yarn was traced back to Mrs.
  McComb; but when the police questioned her she denied having said it. In fact
  she denied ever having charged that Dr. Portal was responsible for her
  husband's death. This was manifestly a falsehood. It was no doubt the
  Terwilligers who, with the best intentions, had shut the woman up. Mrs.
  McComb was the kind of woman who would be very much in awe of
  multi-millionaires.</p>

  <p>"At any rate," said Mme. Storey, "'gunman' is our line."</p>

  <p>"I have not neglected that line," said the Inspector. "The possible hired
  killers are pretty well known to us. Well, every man of that sort has been
  able to account for his actions on the night of November 8th."</p>

  <p>"But there are always new killers coming up," suggested Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"Sure," said the Inspector gloomily, "there are always youngsters who are
  crazy for a chance to qualify in that class. It is looked upon as the head of
  the criminal profession."</p>

  <p>"Then we will assume," she said, "that this was a first killing by a man
  who had already served an apprenticeship in lesser crimes."</p>

  <p>"But it was Dr. Portal who was said to have hired the gunman," said the
  Inspector, frowning.</p>

  <p>"Well, maybe he did," said Mme. Storey airily. "In any case it provides us
  with a starting point."</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">Before we went to bed that night we made an appointment with
  Dr. Portal to come to his laboratory next day. What she had learned made it
  necessary for her to have another talk with him, Mme. Storey told him. After
  that she did not expect to trouble him again until she had arrested her man.
  She insisted that there was no need for secrecy now, and in fact she advised
  him to tell his associates that he had engaged her to clear him from the
  absurd scandal that had clouded his name. "Let the matter be dragged out into
  the open," she said.</p>

  <p>The great Terwilliger Institute, as everybody knows, stands in its own
  fine park on the bank of the East River. I should very much have liked to
  have gone over the whole place, but there was no time for that. We confined
  our attention to the bacteriological laboratory, which was for the time being
  entirely devoted to the researches of Dr. Portal and his assistants. The
  ground floor was given up to an immense general laboratory with apparatus of
  every description; the second floor was divided into special laboratories and
  offices, while the third floor housed the monkeys and other animals used in
  their work. I did not go up there.</p>

  <p>The three of us were in his private room, an office rather than a
  laboratory, bare and speckless as a hospital ward. Mme. Storey said
  lightly:</p>

  <p>"Among the different versions of the story which have been going the
  rounds, there was one to the effect that you hired a gunman to do the
  deed."</p>

  <p>"How absurd!" said the doctor, half-amused, half-angry. "How on earth
  would I set about to hire a gunman?"</p>

  <p>"Have you never known a man of that sort?" asked Mme. Storey
  carelessly.</p>

  <p>Dr. Portal suddenly checked himself. "Why...why, yes I did," he said
  blankly. "How strange! It happened just a little while before the
  tragedy...It never occurred to me there might be a connection between the
  two...Why, there couldn't have been!"</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless, tell me about it," said Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>Dr. Portal looked out of the window. His gaze became still more remote as
  he called up the past scene. "When you have been concentrating on a difficult
  problem for many hours&mdash;or days," he began slowly, "there comes a moment
  when the brain seems to slip its cogs, and you become conscious of a great
  weariness. It is a sort of warning signal, I suppose, and I always heed it at
  once. Generally I take a little walk in the grounds. Sometimes just a few
  minutes' relaxation is enough to restore me."</p>

  <p>"I expect this habit of yours is well known," suggested Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"No doubt. No doubt," he said. "There are certain individuals of the
  neighbourhood with whom I have become quite well acquainted through meeting
  them in the grounds. When I came here years ago the grounds were closed to
  the public, but I persuaded my patrons to open them. It is a crowded
  neighbourhood and there are too few parks. Moreover, I like to walk about and
  watch the people, and talk to them. But I have not always the courage to open
  a conversation. You will think it very silly, I am sure, at my age to be so
  diffident. I am glad when anybody speaks to me."</p>

  <p>"I can understand that," murmured Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>He glanced at her gratefully. "I lead too solitary a life, having no
  family," he went on. "I get up in the morning and go to work. Most days I
  work until it is time to go home and go to bed again. I have myself pretty
  well disciplined&mdash;but not completely disciplined. There is something in
  me that sometimes rebels against this dryness, something that longs for
  colour and drama in life. I tell you this in order to explain what
  happened."</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey nodded.</p>

  <p>"One sunny afternoon," he went on; "it was just a few days before the
  catastrophe here; let me see, the following day was a Saturday; that would be
  two Saturdays before the tragedy, October 30th; I was sitting on a bench in
  the grounds throwing bread crumbs to the sparrows when a young fellow came
  along and sat down on the other end of the bench. I was immediately and
  strongly attracted to him..."</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"Well...I suppose it was the attraction of opposites. He was the exact
  antithesis of what I had been as a young fellow. He existed purely on the
  physical plane, one would say. A superb physical specimen; comely, vigorous
  and alert. He was very well dressed in a somewhat flashy style. I was
  surprised at his interest in me, for such a one naturally has little use for
  an old fogey of a scientist. From his handsome dark eyes and smooth, firm,
  dusky skin I put him down as an Italian, and as a matter of fact he told me
  later that his name was Tito Tolentino..."</p>

  <p>"A mellifluous moniker," put in Mme. Storey with a dry smile; "probably
  assumed for the occasion."</p>

  <p>"No doubt," said Dr. Portal. "Indeed, when we became better acquainted he
  confessed that he went under many names. An amazing tale."</p>

  <p>"Don't skip any of it," warned Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"He was a mere lad," the doctor went on, "not more than nineteen I should
  say, but he had an uncanny air of experience and assurance. I am rather
  alarmed in the presence of hard-boiled youths, but on this occasion I wasn't
  required to make any overtures, for he immediately started talking to me.
  With his uncanny sharpness he perceived that I was diffident, and laid
  himself out to put me at my ease, just as if he had been the elderly man of
  the world and I the gawky stripling."</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey and I smiled at the picture this called up&mdash;the great
  scientist and the gunman! "What did he talk about?" asked my employer.</p>

  <p>"It was about the sparrows at first. How they must have recognised that I
  had a good nature since they came right to my feet. Then he went on to tell
  me about himself; how he was the sole support of his widowed mother and small
  brothers and sisters; how he worked in a printing shop all night, slept in
  the mornings and came out in the afternoons for a breath of air. All this was
  delivered in a snuffling, self-righteous kind of voice. I suppose he thought
  this was the proper way to recommend himself to me; but it only made me
  uncomfortable&mdash;it was so false, so out of character with the flashy
  clothes and the hard, handsome, predatory eyes that searched me through and
  through while he snuffled."</p>

  <p>"He knew who you were?" suggested Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"Yes; it did not occur to me then, but he must have known. From the first,
  I remember, he addressed me as 'Doctor'; he knew I was the head of this
  institution."</p>

  <p>"Go on, please."</p>

  <p>"In the end he perceived, I suppose, that I didn't believe a word of his
  self-righteous story. With that unnatural penetration of his he saw that the
  way to win me was by confessing his sins. At any rate he suddenly changed his
  tone. 'Aah, that's all baloney,' he said with a laugh. 'The truth is, I'm a
  bad egg, doctor. I shook my folks long ago. I play a lone hand. Never did an
  honest day's work in me life!' My heart warmed to him when he said this. It
  cleared the air. We got along famously after that."</p>

  <p>Dr. Portal paused with his attractive smile, so shy and wise. He may have
  been innocent of the ways of the world, but he was nobody's fool. Always
  ready to smile at himself.</p>

  <p>"How can I convey to you the extraordinary effect his story had on me?" he
  presently went on. "It laid a spell on my imagination. It was the first time
  in my life that I had ever come into contact with lawlessness, and all the
  starved lawlessness in my own nature leaped to meet it. Already at nineteen
  this lad had quaffed life to the dregs, whereas at fifty-nine I had not even
  tasted it! I felt a kind of shame for my wasted opportunities."</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey did not miss the irony in this. They laughed together.</p>

  <p>"Of course it was only a mood," he said; "the result of too many
  suppressions. If I had a son I would say to him: 'Don't be too good when
  you're young, or the devil will get you later!'"</p>

  <p>"I suppose women played a considerable part in his story," she
  suggested.</p>

  <p>Dr. Portal held up his hands expressively. "Amazing! Amazing!" he
  murmured. "An incredible point of view! Such a complete absence of
  inhibitions! Such coolness and matter-of-factness! Apparently when Tolentino
  saw anything that pleased him he just reached out and took it, as one might
  help oneself to a peach from a dish! Of course he had been very much favoured
  by nature for this pursuit. Such a handsome little blackguard! The things he
  told me took my breath away. Girls everywhere; all kinds of girls; even girls
  of position, society girls. He used to pick them up at afternoon tea dances.
  'They like a fella to be bad,' he said with his sly grin." The doctor shook
  his head mournfully.</p>

  <p>"What was the upshot of this remarkable conversation?" asked Mme.
  Storey.</p>

  <p>"The upshot was," said Dr. Portal, "that I came to myself with a start to
  find that the sun was going down and that I was thoroughly chilled. When I
  got up to leave, my new friend suggested that we ought to meet again, and I
  eagerly agreed. I was still under his spell. He said as long as I was
  interested in that side of life, he'd like to take me around town and show me
  some places, and we agreed to meet at six the next evening at the Queensboro
  Bridge entrance. I chose a distant point because I was none too anxious to
  have my associates at the Institute see the kind of company I was mixing
  with. He promised to have a car."</p>

  <p>"Good heavens!" cried Mme. Storey, "after all you had been told were you
  not afraid to trust yourself in his hands?"</p>

  <p>Dr. Portal looked at her in surprise. "Why, no," he said. "The idea of
  danger to myself never crossed my mind. Who would want to injure me?"</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey smiled at him somewhat grimly. "And you went?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, I went," he said, "and had one of the most interesting
  evenings I have ever spent...though I got a little tight," he added
  deprecatingly.</p>

  <p>"Well, I expect that was good for you," said Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he agreed innocently. "I tackled my work with fresh energy next
  day."</p>

  <p>"Well, tell us all about it."</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately my sense of direction is poor, and I cannot describe just
  where he took me," said Dr. Portal. "One turned innumerable corners and
  pulled up in front of one door after another. I never knew where we
  were."</p>

  <p>"What kind of car was it?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"A little sedan, quite new, but I didn't notice of what make."</p>

  <p>"Oh, well, it hardly signifies. It was undoubtedly stolen for the occasion
  and abandoned at the end of the evening. Go on, doctor."</p>

  <p>"First we drove far down town into the crowded East side. We went into a
  basement restaurant there. It had no lights nor sign outside, but it was
  quite a large place and well filled. There was a little space for dancing in
  the middle. We ate our dinner there, and Tito pointed out all the celebrities
  of the place. There was a woman&mdash;I forget her name&mdash;who had been
  tried for the murder of her husband so many times, the jury disagreeing on
  each occasion, that finally the District Attorney had become discouraged, and
  she was allowed to go free, though everybody knew she had done it. Then there
  was Monk Eyster, the famous gang leader, and many other notorious criminals
  whose names were strange to me. It was a thrilling experience for me."</p>

  <p>"Did these people appear to know your companion?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"No. Nobody spoke to us."</p>

  <p>"Naturally, he wouldn't have dared take you to any place where he was
  known. Go on."</p>

  <p>"Afterwards we went to a sort of club on the second storey of a building.
  There were only men in this place. It was the headquarters of the stick-up
  fraternity, Tito said, and while we knocked the balls around a pool table, he
  told me who the different men were, and described their hair-raising
  exploits. Everyone was wanted by the police."</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey smiled at him indulgently. "Did anybody speak to your friend
  here?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Humph!" she said, "he probably made up the story out of whole cloth."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," said Dr. Portal a little ruefully, "but it was very exciting at
  the time...Afterwards he said he knew of a roadhouse up in Westchester County
  that was the worst place of all. Everything went there, he said, and nothing
  went any farther. But I would be all right, he said, as long as he was with
  me...So we drove for a long time in the little car. It must have been
  somewhere north of the city, because I remember crossing the Harlem River,
  and passing through the suburb of Williamsbridge. I saw the name on a railway
  station. We came to the roadhouse..."</p>

  <p>"Was it so very wicked?" interrupted Mme. Storey, smiling.</p>

  <p>"Well, I didn't see anything out of the way," returned the doctor
  innocently, "but then I am not accustomed to such places. I wouldn't have
  known what to look for. As a matter of fact I had a drink or two there, and I
  am not quite so clear afterwards as to what happened. All I remember is that
  I became excessively talkative&mdash;it was a great relief!"</p>

  <p>"What did you talk about?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"I can scarcely tell you. I suppose it was about the polio serum which
  fills my mind to the exclusion of everything else. In looking back on it I am
  astonished at the patience of young Tito in letting me run on so. It could
  not have been interesting to him. In spite of all, there must have been
  something genuinely friendly in him, don't you think?"</p>

  <p>"I wonder!" said Mme. Storey grimly. "Go on."</p>

  <p>"The next thing I remember is finding myself in the little car again,
  still driving away from town. For some reason or another we drew up alongside
  the road, and remained there a while, I still talking. It must have been a
  very lonely spot; there were woods on either side of the road; no cars passed
  that way. In my slightly fuddled condition all this seemed perfectly natural.
  I was still talking garrulously about my work, I remember, when I happened to
  notice that Tito was playing with an ugly little automatic gun on his
  knees..."</p>

  <p>"Good God!" murmured Mme. Storey, aghast.</p>

  <p>The doctor, however, was entirely unconcerned. "I remonstrated with him,"
  he said. "I told him to put the thing away before there was an
  accident..."</p>

  <p>"And then what?" asked Mme. Storey tensely.</p>

  <p>"He put it in his pocket," he said calmly; "and we drove home. That's
  all."</p>

  <p>"And that is the strangest part of all!" cried Mme. Storey. "What could
  have persuaded him to spare you?"</p>

  <p>"Hey?" said Dr. Portal, blinking.</p>

  <p>"Don't you realise that you were taken for a ride?" she said.</p>

  <p>"Certainly I was taken for a ride..."</p>

  <p>"No! No! I mean in the special sense of that phrase; the sense in which it
  is used in the underworld. You were taken out to that lonely spot to be shot,
  and your body thrown into the woods. The mystery is, how you contrived to
  escape!"</p>

  <p>"Why should anybody want to shoot me?" gasped the doctor.</p>

  <p>"You escaped," she went on, "but Dr. McComb was not so lucky!"</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to say that Tito shot McComb?" he cried.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. Another tool may have been used in that case. Tito was only
  a hired assassin, of course. There may have been several. What is clear is
  that somebody had it in for the whole Terwilliger Institute!"</p>

  <p>"Why? Why? Why?" asked the dismayed doctor. "We injure nobody. We threaten
  nobody's interest. Our work is for the benefit of the whole community!"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said Mme. Storey sombrely. "It shall be my task to find
  out. Our only clue lies through this Tito."</p>

  <p>"How terrible!" murmured Dr. Portal, thinking of his near escape. "And I
  suspected nothing!"</p>

  <p>"Give me the best description of him that you can," she said.</p>

  <p>The doctor spread out his hands. "I'm afraid I'm not very good at
  it...nineteen or twenty years old; about my height but much more muscularly
  built. Very quick and graceful in his movements. Brown eyes; smooth,
  warm-coloured face that still preserved some of the roundness of boyhood;
  regular white teeth. Ordinarily he wore a mask over his face; his expression
  was perfectly inscrutable..."</p>

  <p>"This tells me next to nothing," said Mme. Storey. "Try to give me
  something characteristic, something peculiar."</p>

  <p>"Well, he had a trick of keeping a perfectly smooth face and speaking out
  of one corner of his mouth," said Dr. Portal.</p>

  <p>"No good!" said my employer ruefully. "They all do that...Did he mention
  any names in his story? Did he ever let fall what they called him?"</p>

  <p>Dr. Portal shook his head. "No, I noticed that he was careful about names.
  It was always 'him' or 'her' or 'this fellow' and 'that fellow.'"</p>

  <p>"Then how about place names?" she asked. "Did he ever mention the names of
  any places that he frequented?"</p>

  <p>After thinking awhile the doctor said: "Yes. He spoke of Bleecker Street.
  More than once I remember him saying: 'I went down to Bleecker' or 'I ran
  into him on Bleecker.'"</p>

  <p>"That helps a little," said Mme. Storey, "but not much. Bleecker is the
  main street, the white-light district for the whole of little Italy...Can you
  give me anything else?"</p>

  <p>After further thought the doctor brightened. "Here's something," he said.
  "On the occasion of our second meeting he appeared wearing a coon-skin coat
  like a college boy."</p>

  <p>"Now we're getting on," said Mme. Storey. "Coon-skin coats cannot be very
  common down on Bleecker Street."</p>

  <p>"But he didn't wear it down there," said the doctor. "I chaffed him about
  it a little, and he said he wouldn't dare be seen in it around home. He said
  he always hired it when he wanted to step out up-town. When I expressed my
  surprise that you could hire anything so valuable as a fur coat, he said he
  had a pull with the old clo' man, that they did business together
  regularly."</p>

  <p>"Then our first task must be to find that old clo' man," said Mme.
  Storey.</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p class="first">My instructions were to find a cheap restaurant or lunchroom
  along the most frequented part of Bleecker Street, and to get into
  conversation with the lady cashier. I chose three-thirty as the hour when
  such places would be least busy. I was disguised as a servant girl on her day
  out. I found my lunchroom and ordered a piece of mince pie and a cup of
  coffee for which I had not the least desire.</p>

  <p>When I paid my check I lingered beside the cashier's desk with a smile of
  foolish good-nature.</p>

  <p>"I allus eats my lunch late," I said. "You kin take your time and eat
  comfortable wit'out bein' pushed by the crowd."</p>

  <p>The cashier's glance said that she didn't give a damn if I never got any
  lunch, but I didn't care. I had her penned behind her little counter where
  she couldn't escape. By degrees I came round to the inevitable "boy-friend."
  She yawned behind her manicured fingers. I told how my boy-friend was going
  to take me to a dance at Webster's Hall on Sat'ay night. I described the
  dress I was going to wear.</p>

  <p>"Pink satin with ribbon dangles ending in little pompoms!" she repeated,
  elevating her plucked eyebrows as much as to say: You would!</p>

  <p>"I do hate to wear me old coat goin' in," I said. "If they was on'y some
  place I could hire a fur coat I wouldn't mind spendin' the money. I don't
  care what I spend to look good. That's me. My boy-friend, he said he'd hire a
  coon-skin coat to match me if he knew where to go for it."</p>

  <p>"Go to Ikey's at &mdash; Sixth Avenue," she said; "they hire fur coats for
  ladies and gents. It's the on'y place I know of."</p>

  <p>"Is zat so?" I said, and talked on for a while. Finally I drifted out
  followed by a crushing glance from the lady cashier.</p>

  <p>I proceeded directly to Ikey's, which is on Sixth Avenue not far from
  Bleecker Street. Ikey, I learned from Mme. Storey, had long been suspected of
  being a fence, but the police had never succeeded in getting the goods on
  him. At any rate he is the friend of every crook in town. He sells more than
  old clo's. He will outfit you with any kind of a disguise that you require,
  and is prepared to sew you up on the spot.</p>

  <p>Unlike other stores, Ikey puts his worst foot foremost. All the shabbiest
  and most disreputable garments are on display, while the fancier articles are
  only brought out upon demand. To the hook-nosed saleslady who approached me
  (they have them of both sexes) I said:</p>

  <p>"Me brutter wants to hire one of them coon-skin coats like college boys
  wear for an evenin'. Have you got any?"</p>

  <p>After consultation with somebody in the rear the saleslady reported:
  "Yeah, we got them coats for hire, but you'll have to put up a hundred
  dollars deposit."</p>

  <p>"A hundred dollars!" I cried. "He might as well buy him a coat."</p>

  <p>"What ja expect?" she asked scornfully. "That ya could walk out with a fur
  coat for fi' dollars? You git your money back when you bring it in."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll take a look at it," I said.</p>

  <p>She presently flung the coat across the counter; quite a luxurious-looking
  garment. But all that interested me about it was a card tied to the collar
  bearing mysterious letters and figures. I supposed that this was the record
  of the times it had been given out and returned, like a library card. All I
  could read were the final entries. There was a C on each line followed by two
  dates. I made believe to look the coat over, and even tried it on, but the
  woman kept the card out of my reach. Finally I said:</p>

  <p>"I don't know if me brutter wants to put up a hundred bones on it. Got any
  utters?"</p>

  <p>"That's the on'y coon-skin coat."</p>

  <p>"Then show me somepin cheaper. Somepin with an elegant fur collar,
  like."</p>

  <p>To my joy she went away leaving the coat lying on the counter with the
  card attached. I made haste to examine it. The first entry on the card read:
  "Chico, &mdash; Bleecker," and then the dates presumably when it was given
  out and returned. All the subsequent entries merely had a C and two dates.
  Apparently it had never been taken out but by the one person. A great
  satisfaction filled me when I read the last date that it had been taken out;
  October 30th. This was the night Tito had taken Dr. Portal for a ride. There
  could be but little doubt this was the right coat.</p>

  <p>Well, I got out of Ikey's with a vague statement that I would "tell me
  brutter," and hastened back to Bleecker Street. The number I was in search of
  proved to be just across the street from my lunch-room. There was a shoe
  store on the street level, and a tenement overhead. In the narrow entry
  alongside the store there was a row of letter-boxes with names in them,
  mostly Italian, which suggested nothing to me. "Chico" was a common nickname,
  and not of very much use in running my man down. As I stood there in
  uncertainty, a loiterer on the pavement outside said:</p>

  <p>"Who ya lookin' fer?"</p>

  <p>"Chico," I said at a venture.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Chico Cardone," he said. "He boards with Mrs. Mora, top floor."</p>

  <p>I climbed the stairs with a heart full of gratitude towards my unwitting
  helper. Luck was with me today.</p>

  <p>The upper floors were still unchanged from Bleecker Street's palmy days
  when the house had been a private dwelling. That is to say, all the rooms
  opened directly on the stair hall. I knocked at the principal door on the top
  floor and it was opened to me a crack by a handsome Italian girl with a
  sullen expression. On the way up I had evolved a new story.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, dearie," I said in the oily voice of the low-grade book agent,
  "have you any young men in your family?"</p>

  <p>"No," she said, and made as if to slam the door, but I shoved my foot
  forward and held it open. "Wait a minute, dearie," I said glibly. "I got a
  publication here no young man can afford to be without..."</p>

  <p>"Take your foot away!" she said angrily, and added a good masculine oath.
  "There's no young men here."</p>

  <p>"Excuse me," I said again, "but the name of a Mr. Cardone was give me as a
  boarder here."</p>

  <p>"He just rents the middle room from me mutter," she said, with a jerk of
  her head towards the next door. "He don't board here. Anyhow he ain't home
  now."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll come back tonight," I said.</p>

  <p>"That won't do you no good," she said with a curious bitterness. "Nights
  you'll find him at Luigi's café."</p>

  <p>With that she aimed a kick at my foot and I hastily withdrew it. The door
  slammed, and I went downstairs with a light heart. I smiled to myself,
  thinking of the girl's bitterness. Had Dr. Portal's handsome little
  blackguard been trifling with her affections, I wondered.</p>

  <p>I returned to the office full of the consciousness of work well done.</p>

  <p>"Good!" said Mme. Storey when she heard my tale. She called up Benny
  Abell, who is our principal liaison officer with the underworld; "Benny," she
  said over the wire, "I want to visit Luigi's café at Number &mdash; Bleecker
  Street tonight. Get busy and find somebody who knows the joint and can take
  me. I'll disguise myself, of course, so I won't look out of place there.
  You'd better come along too."</p>

  <p>When I was for retiring to the back room to scrub the paint off my face
  and resume my own clothes, she said: "Why go to all that trouble? With a
  change of dress you'll do very well for tonight as you are. We can eat here
  before we start."</p>

  <h3>V</h3>

  <p class="first">We met our men at nine o'clock that night in a cheap Italian
  restaurant near Washington Square, so that we could have a couple of hours in
  which to familiarise ourselves with the parts that we were to play later. In
  addition to Benny Abell Mme. Storey had called upon George Stephens, another
  operative, because the plan she had in mind called for two men in addition to
  the Italian who was to conduct us to Luigi's.</p>

  <p>This case followed soon after the Jacmer Touchon affair during which Mme.
  Storey had been obliged for purposes of disguise to cut her hair short. Her
  hair was now about two inches long, and tonight she wore it in a tangle of
  dark curls all over her head like a tousle-headed boy. It lent her an
  impudent prettiness that was irresistible. Wherever we went that night men's
  eyes followed her. She was wearing a smart cheap little red dress and called
  herself Madge Regan. She has the art of making herself look common without
  losing anything of her attractiveness.</p>

  <p>As for me, I modelled myself upon her so far as I was able. Luckily when
  she was present I was not obliged to do much talking.</p>

  <p>At eleven o'clock the Italian joined us. Benny introduced him simply as
  Joe. Benny refused to vouch for him beyond a certain point, consequently he
  was not taken into our confidence. He supposed that we were a party of people
  from uptown who had disguised ourselves in order to see a little low
  life.</p>

  <p>We went on to Luigi's. It was in the basement of one of the ancient
  buildings on Bleecker Street that still retained its old-fashioned high
  stoop. A barber shop occupied the parlour floor, and presumably there was a
  tenement above. My heart sank at sight of the place. True, I knew that Mme.
  Storey had taken Inspector Rumsey into her confidence, and that several
  plain-clothes men were hanging about the neighbourhood ready to aid us if
  necessary; but what good would they be to us, I asked myself, if they arrived
  on the scene after we had been shot?</p>

  <p>Luigi's was a depressing-looking joint and I felt sorry for those who had
  to take their pleasure there. There was a long room beside the entrance
  passage with a row of little tables around it and a narrow space for dancing
  in the middle. It was absolutely empty. Behind it was a smaller room with a
  bar where several men were drinking and talking loudly.</p>

  <p>The real sanctum sanctorum of Luigi's was in the rear. It was a sordid,
  dirty little room, evidently part of an extension to the main building. A
  heavy fog of tobacco smoke filled the air. It was only big enough to hold
  four tables, of which two were occupied when we entered. A large party of
  young men pressed around a table in one of the farther corners playing some
  sort of gambling game with a deal of noisy talk. Beside the door sat three
  girls with a depressed-looking man who was paying very little attention to
  them. The girls were evidently employees of the place, but business was poor,
  and they had fastened to the man merely to keep themselves in
  countenance.</p>

  <p>I could not help looking at them curiously. They started to talk brightly
  among themselves when we entered, but it was a hollow pretence. What a life!
  One of them, I was surprised to see, was as fresh and pretty as a schoolgirl,
  a tiny little thing formed like a fairy, with the pure oval face that
  painters love to depict. I noticed that she was continually glancing in a
  sullen fashion at the group of noisy young men. I supposed that she had a
  sweetheart amongst them, and resented the fact that he preferred to gamble
  rather than talk to her.</p>

  <p>We seated ourselves around the table in the other far corner, that is,
  next to the gamblers. Presumably our man was amongst them, but we were
  careful, of course, not to betray any curiosity concerning them. We ordered
  <i>grappa</i>, the fiery liqueur that is so popular south of Washington
  Square, and busied ourselves in our own talk. Benny was supposed to be my
  boy-friend, while the tall Stephens devoted himself to "Madge," as we called
  her. Joe appeared to be what he in fact was, merely our conductor.</p>

  <p>The waiter came and went noiselessly between us and the bar. He was an
  unnaturally pale and haggard little fellow who looked as if he had never seen
  the sun. Occasionally a fat Italian entered the room, very flashily dressed
  and having a big watch chain with a bunch of charms and a diamond flashing on
  his fat finger. He jingled his charms, exchanged loud witticisms with the
  players while he gave us all the once-over with his hard glittering eye, and
  went out again. This, we learned, was the genial proprietor.</p>

  <p>As opportunity offered I sized up the card players. Some of them had their
  backs to us, but as the game progressed they shifted their places from time
  to time, and in the end I was able to get a look at each one of them. Nearly
  every man at the table answered in a general way to the description furnished
  by Dr. Portal. Nineteen or twenty years old; well-dressed in a somewhat
  flashy style, good-looking in the Italian manner. Handsome, black eyes, and
  well-oiled black hair.</p>

  <p>After eliminating the ill-favoured ones and those who were clearly more
  than twenty years old, my choice finally narrowed down to a warm-coloured
  young man who sat with his back against the end wall, while his hard eyes
  travelled from face to face of the other players. He was certainly the
  best-looking one at the table; his features had a grace and harmony that
  would have earned him a good living as an artists' model; moreover, there was
  that hint of boyish roundness in his cheeks that Dr. Portal had spoken
  of.</p>

  <p>Presently I noticed that it was towards this face that the sullen eyes of
  the little girl at the next table were so often directed. Was she another
  victim to his infernal good looks? He paid no attention whatever to her.
  Finally one of the other players addressed him as "Chico" and he answered.
  Mme. Storey and I exchanged a fleeting glance.</p>

  <p>As soon as we had spotted our man, Mme. Storey began to make play to
  attract his attention. She did not immediately look at him, but addressed
  herself rather to Stephens in a drawling, provocative voice that was bound to
  arouse Chico's notice. Not more than five feet separated their chairs. Chico,
  hearing that siren voice, looked&mdash;and having looked once, looked again.
  The tousled curls netted his fancy. However successful he may have been with
  women it was not often that one so beautiful as Mme. Storey could have come
  his way. He stared. Finally she allowed their glances to cross; she sneered
  at him lazily. At the implied challenge his eyes began to burn. It was a
  fascinating game to watch, but so dangerous it fairly made me sick with
  apprehension.</p>

  <p>It was not long before the little girl at the other table perceived what
  was going on. Her friends addressed her as Tina. She rose quickly, and edging
  herself close to Chico's chair, stood between him and the charmer at our
  table. It was a childish and rather piteous manoeuvre; the little thing's
  face was tormented with jealousy. She put her hand on Chico's shoulder. This
  proprietary gesture caused the other players at the table to grin, and their
  grins enraged the conceited Chico.</p>

  <p>"Get out of here!" he snarled; and added a coarse oath.</p>

  <p>Tina, with a flippant parade of indifference, returned to her former
  place, and began to talk animatedly to the other girls. But her eyes were
  tragic. It wrenched one's heart to see it, but of course a poor little
  may-fly like that could not be allowed to interfere with Mme. Storey's plans.
  If she got hurt that was her lookout.</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey and Chico continued to fence with their insolent glances, each
  making out to scorn the other. The old, old game. Chico was evidently an
  adept at it. Finally, according to pre-arrangement, Stephens began to
  quarrel.</p>

  <p>"Turn around!" he said harshly. "You can look at me, see? I didn't bring
  you here to hand out smiles to another fellow!"</p>

  <p>"Aah, what's the matter wit' ya?" retorted the supposed Madge stridently.
  "You don't own me. My eyes are my own, I guess, and I can do what I want wit'
  'em. You ain't so much to look at as I can see."</p>

  <p>Stephens subsided into a sullen muttering, and Madge (it is easier under
  these circumstances for me to refer to her as Madge) smiled at Chico in open
  defiance. Presently Stephens broke out again, and Benny and I made believe to
  be trying to soothe him. More drinks were ordered at our table. The card
  players grinned at Chico. Apparently they were quite accustomed to seeing him
  as the storm centre when there were women around. Chico went on playing his
  cards with an air of absolute indifference.</p>

  <p>Stephens alternately quarrelled with Madge and ordered up fresh drinks. It
  was a very pretty bit of character acting that he was giving. It was a common
  sort of scene in that place and nobody paid much attention. Once Luigi with
  his hard eyes and his unctuous voice gave us a jocose warning to cut it out.
  Finally Stephens, making believe to be thoroughly drunk, jumped up.</p>

  <p>"Aah, come on home," he snarled. "I'm not gonna stand for this."</p>

  <p>My heart beat like a trip-hammer as the critical moment approached. I
  could scarcely fetch my breath.</p>

  <p>"Go home yourself if you don't like it," retorted Madge. "I'm well enough
  pleased. I'll stay here with Benny and Belle."</p>

  <p>Benny and I got up. "No! No!" we said. (All this had been rehearsed
  beforehand.) "Come on, Madge, let's all go. George is gettin' ugly now. You
  know what he is. We'll quiet him down outside."</p>

  <p>"No!" cried Madge obstinately. "Just because he's turned ugly he's not
  gonna spoil my fun! You can all go home and be damned to you! I'm stayin'!"
  And she sent a sidelong smile in Chico's direction.</p>

  <p>Stephens appeared to be infuriated by this smile. Seizing Madge by the
  wrist, he jerked her roughly to her feet. "You come on!" he cried.</p>

  <p>She tore herself free. "Lea' me alone!" she yelled. "You ain't got any
  rights over me!"</p>

  <p>In the background Benny and I made soothing noises. "Aw, let her alone,
  George, and she'll come...Aw, come on, Madge, you see how he is!" And so
  on.</p>

  <p>But Stephens seized her bodily and started dragging her towards the door.
  Madge fought like a wildcat. Stephens kept her in front of him so that she
  could not reach his face with her nails. Benny and I made futile attempts to
  separate them. Behind us play had stopped, and the twelve players watched the
  struggling couple with cold, mask-like faces. They were not the sort to
  interfere in what did not concern them.</p>

  <p>"Lemme go! Lemme go! or I'll kill ya!" yelled Madge.</p>

  <p>He had shoved her almost to the door when suddenly she reached down,
  snatched a gun out of the top of her stocking, and wrenching herself around,
  pressed the muzzle to his side. Everybody in the room saw the act. They did
  not know that gun was loaded only with blanks. There was a deafening report.
  Stephens released the girl and went staggering back against a table, pressing
  his hand against his side.</p>

  <p>"I'm shot!" he groaned.</p>

  <p>Madge stood there in a daze with the smoking gun in her hand. Benny
  disarmed her without resistance, and dropped the gun in his pocket. He then
  turned to support the wounded man. He ordered Joe, the Italian who had come
  with us, to take his other side. Stephens sagged between them in a most
  realistic way, his hand still pressed over his wound, his head hanging on his
  breast. I felt the same horror as if it had all been real. The absolute
  stillness of everybody else in the room was uncanny. Most of the faces bore
  cynical sneers. It was no business of theirs.</p>

  <p>The door banged open and Luigi and his waiters ran in. The fat man was
  livid and moist with excitement. "Who done it?" he yelled.</p>

  <p>"She did! She did!" cried Benny, pointing a shaking forefinger at Madge.
  "She shot my pal!" And he put his arm lovingly around Stephens' shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Get him out of here! Get him out of here before he drops!" yelled Luigi.
  "My God! I can't have him dyin' on me! This will ruin me if it gets to the
  police!"</p>

  <p>"We'll get him out if you'll call a taxi," growled Benny.</p>

  <p>Luigi scampered away to do his bidding, and Benny and Joe slowly followed
  him out of the room, supporting the fainting man between them. All this
  happened so quickly that the bystanders had no time to wonder why no blood
  appeared around the hand that Stephens was pressing to his side. Madge made a
  move to accompany them, but Benny turned on her violently.</p>

  <p>"Get back!" he snarled. "Ain't you done harm enough?"</p>

  <p>Presumably they got their cab, for they did not return. Madge and I were
  left behind. She dropped in a chair and, spreading her arms on the table in
  front of her, hid her face upon them. I sat down beside her, and put an arm
  around her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Oh, why did you do it? Why did you do it?" I moaned.</p>

  <p>Play started again at the next table as if nothing had happened. At the
  other table the three girls, with painful sneers in Madge's direction,
  resumed their low-voiced talk.</p>

  <p>In a few moments Luigi came bustling back into the room. "Now, then,
  girl," he said harshly, "out with ya! Ye're lucky to git off so easy. Never
  let me catch you in my place again. I don't care who brings ya."</p>

  <p>Madge raised a dry-eyed, terror-stricken face. "I dassent...I dassent go
  out in the street," she said hoarsely. "Benny'll be layin' for me. He took me
  gun off me. He'll git me for this."</p>

  <p>"That's nothin' to me," said Luigi. "Out wit' ya!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I dassent! I dassent!" whispered Madge, glancing around desperately
  for help.</p>

  <p>Chico gave over his hand to the man who was standing next him, and arose
  with a swagger. "That's all right, Luigi," he said with a lordly
  indifference, "these ladies are wit' me, see? I'm buyin' for them. What'll
  you have, girls?"</p>

  <p>"You're a fool, Chico," said Luigi, shrugging, "you had oughta leave the
  women alone. You're like to get plugged yourself for this." However, his
  scorn was tempered by a grin. Chico was evidently a favourite.</p>

  <p>"Thanks for the tip," said Chico insolently. "I know my business."</p>

  <p>Little Tina suddenly sprang up, livid and trembling with passion. "You
  would, would you?" she cried. "With the likes of <i>that</i>! She's a
  murderess! Put her out! Put her out!"</p>

  <p>Everybody turned on Tina. "Yah! are you tryin' to make trouble now?"
  snarled Luigi. "I don't have to take it from you! Git your things and git,
  see!" He pointed a stubby forefinger towards the door.</p>

  <p>Tina's voice rose shriller and higher, but Luigi bellowed her down.
  "Git!...Git!...Git!"</p>

  <p>The girl suddenly collapsed and stumbled out of the room, weeping
  tempestuously. There is no justice in such matters. Luigi followed her
  out.</p>

  <h3>VI</h3>

  <p class="first">In obedience to a glance from Madge I moved around to the
  other side of the table, leaving the place next to her for Chico. We sat
  down. More <i>grappa</i> was brought to our table, and everything went on
  just as if there had been no shooting five minutes before. I may say that
  Madge and I made no pretence of drinking all this stuff. Luigi didn't care,
  of course, so it was ordered often enough. The full glasses were whisked away
  from in front of us, and I have no doubt brought back again directly
  afterwards.</p>

  <p>It was very thrilling to find oneself so close to the redoubtable Chico.
  He was so frankly the preening, strutting male I was almost ashamed to look
  at him. "Aah! buck up, girl!" he said to Madge with his scornful grin;
  "you're too good-lookin' a girl to mind a little thing like that! Nobody's
  gonna do anything to a girl like you!"</p>

  <p>However scornful his words might be, there was a dangerous purring quality
  in his voice whenever he addressed a woman that was&mdash;well, weakening!
  The little wretch was too good-looking, too sure of himself. It wasn't fair.
  Madge permitted herself to smile wanly in his direction.</p>

  <p>"What's yer name?" he demanded. "Me, I'm Chico Cardone."</p>

  <p>"Madge Regan," she said.</p>

  <p>"And who's she?" he asked, with a contemptuous jerk of the head in my
  direction.</p>

  <p>"Me sister Bella."</p>

  <p>"Well, say, they ain't nobody layin' fer Bella outside," he said coolly.
  "Why can't she beat it home?"</p>

  <p>"Nix," said Madge. "Me and Bella allus sticks together."</p>

  <p>"Aah," he drawled, at once contemptuous and cajoling, "send her home, go
  on."</p>

  <p>"No," said Madge.</p>

  <p>Their hard glances contended for the mastery. In the end it was Madge who
  faced him out. Chico was inveigled by the touselled head. "Well, drink
  hearty," he said, lifting his tiny glass. No more was said about sending me
  home.</p>

  <p>Chico, with his insolent narrowed eyes fixed on her face, picked up her
  hand and fondled it. "Pretty damn quick on the draw aw right," he said
  grinning. "Me, I like 'em dangerous, meself. They's some kick about a girl
  that totes a gun. What makes me tired is the kind that blubs all over the
  place...Just the same when you go out wit' me I'll make sure first-off you
  ain't got no gun in your stockin' before I git it meself."</p>

  <p>Madge pulled her hand away. "I ain't gonna get messed up with you," she
  said, giving him scorn for scorn.</p>

  <p>"Why ain't ya?"</p>

  <p>"Too many women runnin' after ya. I don' hafta enter no free-for-all to
  git a fella."</p>

  <p>"Is zat so?" drawled Chico.</p>

  <p>"You heard me."</p>

  <p>"Nobody ever caught me by runnin' after me. I pick me own."</p>

  <p>"Yeah?"</p>

  <p>"Yeah!"</p>

  <p>It is impossible to convey in words the spirited exchange of glances that
  passed back and forth. I wondered where Mme. Storey could have learned the
  technique of Bleecker Street love-making. She was as good as Chico. "You
  don't exactly hate yerself, do ya?" she asked with arch scorn.</p>

  <p>"Why should I?" retorted Chico grinning. "I never lie to a woman."</p>

  <p>"No, you don't!"&mdash;very sarcastically.</p>

  <p>"Sure, I don't. That's what makes 'em sore. They expect a man to lie."</p>

  <p>"Yeah?"</p>

  <p>"Yeah! But I allus give it to 'em straight." He drew her arm through his,
  and leaned warmly towards her. "Listen, kid," he murmured thrillingly, "I'm
  for you, see?...There it is, you can take it or leave it, and I ain't sayin'
  you're the on'y girl in the world neither."</p>

  <p>"Nor are you the on'y fella," she retorted.</p>

  <p>Luigi had returned to the room and was watching the couple with a cynical
  grin. The scene between them was interrupted by the clanging of a gong in the
  street. Everybody looked at the door uneasily. The haggard little waiter ran
  in.</p>

  <p>"The police," he gasped; "the police..."</p>

  <p>A window was thrown up and Chico went over the sill, pulling Madge after
  him by the hand. Chico never thought of me, but you may be sure I stuck close
  to them. We dropped on damp flagstones outside, with a high wooden fence
  looming before us. There was a ladder lying in the yard, which Chico placed
  against the extension. We scrambled up, and he pulled it after us. We crossed
  a flat tin roof that crackled underfoot, and went over another window sill
  into the main house. We found ourselves in a bedroom. There were actually two
  people lying in the bed. One rose up as we crossed the room, but Chico said:
  "'S'all right, Mike;" and he lay down again. It was like a crazy dream.</p>

  <p>Gaining the main hall of the house, we went up three more flights of
  stairs, and up another ladder. Chico pushed open a scuttle, and once more we
  found ourselves under the sky. Chico carefully closed the scuttle. I had a
  momentary impression of peaceful still beauty high above the confusion of the
  town. The sky threatened rain, and the low-hanging clouds reflected the
  street lights with a delicate pinkish radiance.</p>

  <p>Chico ran over the roofs pulling Madge after him, and I close at their
  heels. We climbed over the low parapets that separated the houses. The noises
  of the street came up to us slightly muffled. I counted the houses we
  crossed. On the fourth house Chico dropped to his knees beside a little
  skylight in the roof, and lifted it.</p>

  <p>"This is me own room," he said. "We'll be as safe here as in church."</p>

  <p>He dropped out of sight into the black hole, and presently his voice came
  back: "Wait till I shove a table under, and then let yourself down easy." And
  a moment later: "Now!"</p>

  <p>I had a moment of horrible panic when Mme. Storey dropped into the
  blackness, thinking she might be spirited away from me. But when I let myself
  down, I found the table under my feet, and Chico's hand to guide me. He
  steered me to a bed.</p>

  <p>"Sit there," he said. "I gotta close the shutter before I light up."</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey was beside me. I was trembling like an aspen leaf, and she
  pressed my hand to reassure me. By a little catch of laughter in her breath I
  knew she was enjoying every moment. Well, that is her way. It made me a
  little sore at the time, because my nerves were in strings.</p>

  <p>The light flashed on, and I beheld a sordid little inside room with only
  the skylight overhead to admit light and air. It was closely shuttered now.
  The place was clean enough, but utterly cheerless; the sagging iron bed on
  which we sat, the rickety pine table; a cheap bureau marked all around the
  edge with the burns of innumerable cigarette butts; and two broken chairs.
  The only humane touch in the room was a photograph stuck in the glass on the
  bureau. Curiously enough it was not of a woman, but a handsome Italian boy,
  thirteen or fourteen years old.</p>

  <p>Chico stood before us grinning. "Well, here we are!" he said. "On'y I wish
  to God Bella was home and in bed."</p>

  <p>Madge now assumed a sullen and rather scared look. "If she wasn't here I
  wouldn't stay," she muttered.</p>

  <p>"Would you sooner run out into the arms of the cops?" asked Chico
  teasingly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I would," she muttered. "When can I get out of here?"</p>

  <p>"I don't care if you never go," said Chico ardently.</p>

  <p>Now that we had separated him from the gang, Chico showed us a new aspect
  of his character. He was not on parade now. There was no necessity for him to
  play the part of the swaggering little bravo, who felt nothing and cared for
  nothing. Now that he had us practically at his mercy, something perilously
  like decency and kindness appeared in his hard face. I gradually lost my fear
  of him.</p>

  <p>"Aw, I ain't a gorilla," he said cajolingly to Madge. "I ain't a gonna
  bite ya. What ya scared of, kid? You was game enough when the utter fella got
  ugly."</p>

  <p>Gradually Madge allowed herself to be won back to a smile. In his room,
  however, her manner was entirely different from what it had been in the café.
  There were no more scornful challenges from her dark eyes. She was friendly
  and gentle as if she trusted him&mdash;and Chico responded to it. Nobody is
  completely bad, of course. He talked to her like any simple fellow to his
  girl.</p>

  <p>Chico poured out the story of his life and adventures as if it was relief
  to unburden himself. It was a lurid tale. He was mum as to the particular
  incident in which we were interested. He still boasted, of course, but there
  was a simplicity about his recital that disarmed one. The poor lad's moral
  values were hopelessly confused: he boasted of his crimes, and apologised for
  his better impulses.</p>

  <p>Madge took advantage of a lull in his talk to ask: "Who's that a pitcher
  of in your bureau?"</p>

  <p>Chico sprang up and fetched it to the bed. "That's me kid brutter, Tony,"
  he said eagerly. "Ain't he a swell-lookin' kid?" The question unlocked the
  last stronghold of Chico's guarded breast. There was something almost piteous
  in his eager fondness. "Say, I cert'ny am foolish about that kid," he went
  on. "Have to keep it dark around the fellas or they sure would razz
  me...There's on'y the two of us, him and me. Our folks is all dead, and I'm
  raisin' the kid, see? I mean, I'm payin' for his raisin'. I got him in the
  Paulist Fathers' school up-town. Damn good school, too. The sons of judges
  and doctors and politicians and all kinds of high-ups go there, and my Tony's
  as good as the best of them!"</p>

  <p>"The sons of doctors and lawyers and all!" exclaimed Madge as if
  amazed.</p>

  <p>"Sure, I know you'll t'ink I'm a fool," said Chico shamefacedly, "but that
  kid's gotta have the best education money kin buy. None of the rough stuff
  for him; none of what I went troo. Me, I got my education in the prisons. He
  don't know where the money comes from that pays his bills. He thinks I'm a
  travellin' man. Gee! it would raise a stink up in that school if they ever
  found out, eh? But I'll take care of that. The on'y thing that bothers me is,
  suppose I was to get mine sudden. Suppose I stopped a bullet or got sent up
  for a long stretch. I tell ya that shakes me nerve. What would happen to the
  kid if I kicked out?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe the fathers would keep him just the same," suggested Madge.</p>

  <p>"Maybe," said Chico frowning, "but I wouldn't want him to be a charity
  pupil. He has his pocket-money with the rest of them, and belongs to the
  swell clubs. He's on the basket-ball team&mdash;the junior team&mdash;and he
  plays football too. He's gonna be a regular husky when he gits his growt'.
  Bigger'n me. Sometimes I go up to watch their games, but he don't know I'm
  there."</p>

  <p>"Don't you ever see him?" asked Madge in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Sure, I go up there sometimes," said Chico uncomfortably, "but it's a
  kind of a strain to hafta talk to the priests and all. I'm afraid of givin'
  the snap away. So mostly I make out I'm travellin'. I took him to the movies
  once or twict on a Sat'day aft-noon, but hell! you never know what yer gonna
  see in them movies. They puts ideas in a young kid's head."</p>

  <p>"Ain't it the troot!" murmured Madge, entering fully into sympathy with
  his story.</p>

  <p>"I feel just like a fat'er to that kid," said Chico with an attractive,
  shamefaced laugh. "Ain't it hell to be a fat'er! Allus worryin' about him,
  how to keep him from learnin' bad and all; allus thinkin' he's gonna get one
  of these diseases that kids get."</p>

  <p>"Like infantile paralysis," suggested Madge softly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, God! that's the worst," said Chico. "Fair puts me in a sweat just to
  think of it. And they say there's an epidemic comin' on."</p>

  <p>"I read in the papiss how there was a doctor guy gonna wipe out infantile
  paralysis," said Madge. "At the Terwilliger Institoot."</p>

  <p>Chico made no answer.</p>

  <p>"Did you read that?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"No. I didn't read it," he said slowly. "But I know that doctor guy; Dr.
  Felix Portal."</p>

  <p>"Sure, that was the name," said Madge; "you know him?"</p>

  <p>There was another pause, then Chico said impulsively: "Say, if you'n me's
  gonna be pals I'll tell you this." Apparently he looked around at me here.
  "Do you t'ink Bella's asleep?" he asked apprehensively.</p>

  <p>"Sure, she'll sleep wherever you put her down," said Madge.</p>

  <p>"Listen," said Chico lowering his voice&mdash;and you can imagine how I
  stretched my ears for what was coming; "there was a fella hired me to take
  Dr. Portal for a ride."</p>

  <p>"What!" cried Madge.</p>

  <p>"Yeah, and I took him, too. Way to hell and gone up in Westchester County.
  And I had me gun in me hand ready to smoke him, and I couldn't do it."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because he was talkin' about this now, infantile paralysis, and how he
  was gonna save all the kids from it, and I happened to t'ink about my Tony,
  and I couldn't do it. I put the rod in me pocket and I drove the old man
  home. And I ain't never regretted it neither, though it cost me a grand."</p>

  <p>"But what fellow would want to bump him off?" asked Madge.</p>

  <p>Chico turned wary again. "I'm not tellin' that," he said shortly.</p>

  <p>"But there was some trouble up there," said Madge. "Anot'er doctor guy was
  shot. I read it in the papiss. Don't re'clect his name. Was you in that
  too?"</p>

  <p>"Aah, you wanta know too much fer yer own good," said Chico, wary, but
  perfectly good-tempered.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to pry into yer secrets," said Madge with an offended air,
  "on'y it seems funny why anybody would want to go after two doctor guys who
  was on'y workin' to save the kids."</p>

  <p>"Yeah, and it <i>is</i> funny too, if the troot was known."</p>

  <p>That was as far as she could get him. Mme. Storey let the talk drift away
  to other matters. Before she could bring it back we were startled by hearing
  a slight, peculiar tap on the door. Madge and I sprang up in alarm.</p>

  <p>"'S'all right," said Chico soothingly. "That's the knock of a friend."
  Going to the door, he opened it an inch or two. Madge and I were out of the
  range of vision of whoever stood outside. "What's the matter?" asked Chico.
  "Must be near four o'clock."</p>

  <p>"Well, you ain't in bed yet," responded the voice of an angry woman. "Who
  you got in here? I'm gonna see!"</p>

  <p>She pushed past Chico and I saw the handsome, buxom Italian girl who had
  opened the door to me that afternoon. My heart sank like a stone. The worst
  of it was, I was sitting up on the bed, staring directly at her. It was too
  late then to lie down and make believe to be sleeping. My only hope of
  escaping recognition lay in the fact that it had been pretty dark in the
  stair hall that afternoon.</p>

  <p>"Two of 'em!" she cried furiously. "Two of 'em! Here's a nice thing!
  Bringin' 'em in here right next to me mutter's room! You got no shame at
  all!"</p>

  <p>Chico was much more respectful towards this girl. I suppose she had some
  sort of hold over him. "Now Ria, now Ria," he said placatingly, "you get this
  wrong! I never seen these ladies before tonight."</p>

  <p>"The more shame to you!" she cried, "bringin' 'em here! Huh! Ladies! Don't
  make me laugh!"</p>

  <p>"You can see for yerself there's nothin' wrong," protested Chico. "We was
  just sittin' talkin', like."</p>

  <p>"Yeah, and you was tellin' 'em all you knew, eh? I could hear you talkin'
  through the wall!"</p>

  <p>"I just brought 'em in here to get 'em out of the way of the police," said
  Chico.</p>

  <p>"That's a likely story! Maybe they're police spies theirselves!"</p>

  <p>It was only the random shot of a jealous woman, but it made my blood run
  cold. She came closer to the bed, peering into our faces. "I thought so!" she
  cried in shrill triumph. "They <i>are</i> spies! Anyhow, the red-headed one
  is," pointing to me.</p>

  <p>Our backs were against the wall then. "It's a lie!" cried Mme. Storey.
  "It's a lie!" I echoed. "You're crazy!" muttered Chico.</p>

  <p>"Crazy, am I?" sneered the Italian. "She come to the door this afternoon
  lookin' for ya. Made out to be a book agent. 'Mr. Cardone's name was give
  me,' says she so nice. Yah! Well, I didn't suspect nothin', and I told her
  she'd find you at Luigi's speakeasy tonight. She did find you there, didn't
  she? And now you've told her everythin' you know!"</p>

  <p>Who could ever have foreseen this? It was just a rotten piece of luck.
  Chico backed away from the bed, his face turning pale and hard. His hand went
  slowly to his hip, and reappeared grasping an ugly little automatic. I closed
  my eyes, thinking our last moment had come.</p>

  <p>"Oh, spare her! spare her!" I moaned.</p>

  <p>"Be quiet, Bella," commanded my employer.</p>

  <p>The Italian girl cried out too. "Chico, no! no!"</p>

  <p>He had become the hard and self-controlled little gunman again. "Shut your
  noise," he growled out of the corner of his mouth. "I'm not gonna croak
  them...Call your dad."</p>

  <p>The girl stuck her head out of the door and called tremulously: "Padre!
  Padre!"</p>

  <p>Chico and Mme. Storey measured their steely glances against each other. "I
  thought you was on the square wit' me," sneered Chico. "You fooled me nice,
  didn't ya? I gotta hand it to ya."</p>

  <p>"I shall be on the square with you," she answered. "You'll see it
  yet."</p>

  <p>"Yeah? You're no Bleecker Street girl. I can see it in your eye. You've
  got the look of one of the high-ups."</p>

  <p>A burly Italian shuffled into the room clad in slippers, pants and shirt,
  with his suspenders hanging. He too had a gun in his hand. I was sick with
  terror. "What's the matter, kid?" he growled.</p>

  <p>"Ria says them two women are police spies," said Chico. "Maybe they are
  and maybe they ain't. I ain't takin' no chances. Keep them here while I make
  a getaway, that's all. Give me ten minutes and then let 'em go, see? Let 'em
  go and be damned to 'em!"</p>

  <p>Chico thrust the photograph in his breast pocket and snatched up his cap.
  He had had this cap during our flight over the roofs.</p>

  <p>"Where's your overcoat?" asked Ria.</p>

  <p>"Left it at Luigi's. Get it tomorrow, will ya?" Without another glance in
  our direction, he made for the door.</p>

  <p>The tears were rolling down Ria's round cheeks. "Oh, Chico mio," she
  mourned.</p>

  <p>He paused only long enough to jerk up her chin with his forefinger and
  print a kiss on her lips. There was something infinitely savage and graceful
  in the gesture. He sped downstairs. Ria wept unrestrainedly. Mme. Storey's
  face was like a mask. I was surprised to see her take his escape so calmly,
  but I was not familiar with all the details of the arrangements she had made
  in advance.</p>

  <p>Chico's footsteps died away as he descended through the house. Then
  suddenly far below we heard the sounds of a scuffle followed by a heavy fall.
  After a moment a voice, not Chico's, cried exultantly: "I have him!" A breath
  of relief escaped Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>The other Italian's face turned black with rage. "By God! they've got
  him!" he cried. "But I've got you!" And he raised the gun.</p>

  <p>Once more Mme. Storey and I looked straight into the face of death. She
  never flinched. Ria flung herself on her father. "No! No!" she cried. "The
  police are downstairs. They'll send you to the chair for it! These women are
  nothing to us!"</p>

  <p>While they were still struggling there was a crash overhead. The shutter
  under the skylight swung down, and a man dropped into the room, landing on
  his feet like a cat. Another followed. Both were armed. The first was George
  Stephens, the second, one of Inspector Rumsey's plain-clothes men. In a trice
  they had the Italian covered, and forced him to drop his gun.</p>

  <p>And so we were saved. In the powerful reaction that overcame me, all my
  strength seemed to desert me for a moment. I dropped on the edge of the bed.
  Mme. Storey said:</p>

  <p>"Give me a cigarette, George."</p>

  <p>"Where's Chico?" asked Stephens.</p>

  <p>"They have him safe downstairs."</p>

  <p>He jerked his head towards the scowling Italian and his daughter. "Shall
  we take these two along?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Mme. Storey, "they are guilty of nothing except standing by a
  friend."</p>

  <p>"But he pulled a gun," objected the plain-clothes man. "I've got to take
  him up for that."</p>

  <p>"It was my gun," said Mme. Storey quickly. "He took it from me."</p>

  <p>The gun was returned to her. "Come on," said Stephens; and we filed out of
  the room. Mme. Storey was the last to go. She slipped the gun to the Italian,
  whispering: "Take out a permit for it, and you'll have nothing to fear." He
  stared at her in dumb amazement. Such magnanimity, I suppose, was absolutely
  unheard of in his world.</p>

  <h3>VII</h3>

  <p class="first">Chico was lodged in the Tombs. After a couple of hours'
  sleep Mme. Storey and I were again hard at work on the case. Events followed
  fast that morning. Acting upon a suggestion of Mme. Storey's, the police were
  searching the sewer catch basins in the immediate vicinity of the Institute
  and in one of them was found an automatic pistol of the latest Rives and
  Jackson model, 38 calibre, from which one shot had been fired, and also a
  slightly flattened bullet. The bullet exactly fitted the hole in the plaster
  of Dr. McComb's office.</p>

  <p>Steps were immediately taken to trace the sale of the pistol by means of
  the manufacturer's number, and in the meantime I was sent up-town to secure
  some photographs of Dr. McComb if that were possible, and also to run down
  Amadeo Corioli, the night watchman at the Institute, and invite him to visit
  Mme. Storey's office. A policeman accompanied me upon the latter errand, but
  as it happened, Corioli came quite willingly. His air of innocence was almost
  too childlike. In taking these measures Mme. Storey, you will perceive, was
  following a theory that she had formulated in advance.</p>

  <p>By the time I got back to the office it had already been established that
  the gun in question had been sold on October 28th, to a well-dressed,
  heavy-built man about forty years old; red-faced and wearing glasses; had the
  look of a professional man. When photographs of Dr. McComb were shown the
  clerk, he positively identified him as the purchaser. McComb had been shot
  with his own gun.</p>

  <p>The final links were forged by the testimony of little Tina, the girl who
  had been so rudely ejected from Luigi's. The police rounded her up and
  brought her to our office shortly before noon. Corioli, meanwhile, was being
  detained in our back room. Still wearing her bedraggled party dress, her
  make-up ruined by tears, and almost paralysed with terror, Tina was indeed a
  pitiable little object. Mme. Storey applied herself to soothing her fears. It
  was a long time before she could persuade Tina that she was not accused of
  anything herself, but was merely wanted as a witness.</p>

  <p>"We know," said Mme. Storey, "that Chico Cardone shot a man called Dr.
  McComb on the night of November 9th."</p>

  <p>This was news to me, and I strongly doubted if my employer was sure of it
  yet either. It is frequently necessary, of course, to take this attitude in
  dealing with a witness.</p>

  <p>"I don't know nottin' about it!" cried Tina. "I swear before God I don't
  know nottin'!"</p>

  <p>"You are not suspected of knowing anything about it," Mme. Storey
  patiently explained. "I just want you to answer a few questions referring to
  circumstances that led up to it."</p>

  <p>"I don't know nottin' about it," wailed Tina.</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't want to see Chico go to the chair, would you?"</p>

  <p>This was answered by a mute shake of the head amidst a fresh flood of
  tears.</p>

  <p>"Then if you help me to prove that someone was behind him in this killing,
  that somebody put him up to it, he will get off easier."</p>

  <p>At this point Corioli was introduced into the room.</p>

  <p>"Have you ever seen this man before?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>Corioli scowled a mute threat at the girl, but she answered truthfully.
  "Yes, I see him. He come to Luigi's sometime. Ev'body at Luigi's know
  him."</p>

  <p>"Did he ever bring a stranger to Luigi's?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. One time he bring a man from up-town."</p>

  <p>"What sort of looking man?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"Big man," said Tina; "red face; wear glasses. Look lika politician."</p>

  <p>"Look at these," said Mme. Storey, calling the girl's attention to the
  photographs of Dr. McComb spread upon her desk. "Did you ever see this
  man?"</p>

  <p>"Sure," said Tina with rising excitement; "that is the up-town guy Amadeo
  bring to Luigi's. You know t'at? How you know t'at?"</p>

  <p>"When was this?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>Tina shrugged. "How can I tell? It was before election, because I t'ink he
  was politician."</p>

  <p>"Long before election?"</p>

  <p>The girl shook her head. "Jus' two, t'ree days."</p>

  <p>"See if you can't fix the exact night in your mind," said Mme. Storey
  persuasively.</p>

  <p>Tina shook her head helplessly. However, after thinking it over for a
  moment or two, she suddenly said: "It was Wednesday night. I know that
  because the next night there was an orchester. Luigi hires an orchester
  Thursday nights."</p>

  <p>"The Wednesday before election," said Mme. Storey turning back the pages
  of her desk calendar; "that was October 27th. Good! Now we are making
  progress...What happened on this Wednesday night?"</p>

  <p>"Amadeo Corioli, he call Chico over," said Tina. "Introduce him to the
  up-town guy. They talk quiet. By and by Amadeo go away an' the up-town fella
  and Chico they talk long time so quiet. I know they fixin' up some job
  toget'er. Afterwards I ask Chico what he want but Chico on'y laugh...The nex'
  night he come again..."</p>

  <p>"So he came again the next night?" repeated Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"Yes. That was the orchester night. I wouldn't dance because I scare for
  Chico. I watch them two. They not talk so long this night. I see the up-town
  guy slip Chico little box under the table and Chico put it in his pocket.
  When the uptown feller go home, Chico go in wash-room. After he come out I
  find the little box empty on the wash-room floor, and the paper and
  string..."</p>

  <p>"Was there anything written on the box? any label?" asked Mme. Storey
  eagerly.</p>

  <p>"There was a label say: 'One Rives and Jackson automatic pistol, 38
  calibre.'"</p>

  <p>"This was on the night of October 28th," said Mme. Storey in high
  satisfaction, "and we already know that Dr. McComb had bought the gun that
  afternoon. On the following day Chico scraped acquaintance with Dr. Portal.
  Our case is complete!"</p>

  <p>I was far from seeing it myself at that moment. When the witnesses had
  been taken away and my employer and I were alone, I said helplessly: "I can't
  understand it! It seems that Dr. McComb himself handed the gun to Chico with
  which Chico shot him ten days later!"</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey was in a deep study. "Think it over," she said with a
  provoking smile. "...The problem that confronts me is, what to do with
  Chico?"</p>

  <p>As a result of her deliberations she finally called up the District
  Attorney, also Inspector Rumsey and Dr. Portal, and arranged for us all to
  meet at the Institute after lunch, and for the Inspector to bring Chico. The
  District Attorney at this time was Frank Everard, a first-class man, and one
  with whom we maintained excellent relations.</p>

  <p>And so the last scene of all took place in the bare little laboratory
  office with Dr. Portal, all in white, presiding over it like a disembodied
  face. From time to time I saw him glancing wistfully at Chico, and I suppose
  he still felt a sneaking fondness for the lad. And I confess I did myself. At
  this moment my heart was heavy for the little gunman. Chico, of course, had
  resumed his hard, professional air. His face was like a mask.</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey said: "Dr. Portal, I promised I would not trouble you again
  until I had found the man who shot Edgar McComb...Well, there he is."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry...I'm sorry," murmured Dr. Portal commiseratingly. "Why did he
  do it?"</p>

  <p>"Why did you do it, Chico?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"I ain't sayin' I done it," replied Chico with a hardy swagger. "I ain't
  sayin' nottin' a tall."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll tell you why he did it," said Mme. Storey gravely. "McComb had
  hired him to shoot Dr. Portal."</p>

  <p>We all exclaimed in astonishment. "Oh, good God!...no!" gasped the
  horrified Dr. Portal.</p>

  <p>"When he saw that the poliomyelitis serum was going to be a success McComb
  wished to reap the full glory," she went on relentlessly. "He foresaw that it
  would be one of the great accomplishments of science that would make its
  discoverer forever famous."</p>

  <p>"What saved Dr. Portal?" asked the District Attorney.</p>

  <p>"At the moment that Chico had his gun in his hand Dr. Portal saved himself
  by speaking of what he was about to do for the children. As it happens, Chico
  has a young brother who is the dearest thing on earth to him."</p>

  <p>Chico suddenly lowered his head. The poor lad could not bear to have us
  see the softness that overcame him at the mention of Tony.</p>

  <p>"I suppose Chico brooded upon it afterwards," Mme. Storey went on. "It
  occurred to him that McComb could easily find another instrument to carry out
  his will. He shot McComb to save Portal...I'm not saying that his reasoning
  was very good, but anyhow, that is what happened."</p>

  <p>"Strange are the workings of the human heart!" murmured Dr. Portal. The
  rest of us were silent in amazement.</p>

  <p>"I called you gentlemen together to put it up to you what is to be done
  with Chico?" Mme. Storey went on. "He killed the man, and ordinarily it would
  be our duty to let justice take its course with him. But it seems to me that
  this is a case where justice would not be justice. How can we punish him for
  acting upon what was a generous impulse, however misguided? And how can we
  let him bear the brunt when the real instigator of this crime&mdash;I refer
  to Mrs. McComb&mdash;cannot be reached by the law? What do you say, Mr.
  District Attorney?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Everard did not answer immediately. He looked very uncomfortable. Dr.
  Portal broke the silence by saying in his quiet, deliberate way:</p>

  <p>"I have a solution to propose."</p>

  <p>Everybody looked at him. Chico forgot his unnatural self-control, and
  gazed at him with the wild hope of any lad in the shadow of the electric
  chair.</p>

  <p>"I need a human subject in my experiments," said Dr. Portal. "If Chico is
  willing..."</p>

  <p>"What does the District Attorney say?" asked Mme. Storey quickly.</p>

  <p>Everard's face cleared. "I say that if Chico volunteers this," he replied
  unhesitatingly, "I will not undertake a prosecution."</p>

  <p>"Then, Chico, it is up to you," she said with a curious gentleness.</p>

  <p>"I...I don't get it," he said hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"Listen, Chico," said Dr. Portal rising. There was something magnificent
  about the little man at that moment; the disembodied face was pure
  intelligence. "I propose to make you sick with this disease that you know
  about, poliomyelitis or infantile paralysis, and then I propose to cure you
  with my new remedy. I believe that I can cure you, or I would not propose the
  experiment, but there is a certain risk, of course, because it has not been
  tried before on a human being."</p>

  <p>Chico's lips were parted. He was breathing hoarsely. "And...and if it
  works," he stammered, "then you can give it to all the kids that gets
  sick?"</p>

  <p>"That is the idea."</p>

  <p>"But...but <i>my</i> kid!" cried the poor lad; "suppose it don't work?
  Suppose I kick out, or ain't able to do nottin' no more? What will happen to
  Tony?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, let me take that on myself," said Dr. Portal, deeply moved; "let me
  bring him up as if he were my own son."</p>

  <p>"I'd like to share in that," said Mme. Storey quickly.</p>

  <p>"And I," murmured the District Attorney.</p>

  <p>Chico stiffened his back, and endeavoured to call back the old swagger.
  "All right, Doc, I'm on!" he said flippantly. "But make it snappy, Doc. Don't
  let me be t'inkin' about it too long."</p>

  <p>"Now's as good a time as any," said Dr. Portal. "Come on upstairs."</p>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">Commodore Varick died very suddenly about half-past five in
  the afternoon. The cause of death was given as heart failure induced by a
  violent attack of gastritis. The news caused a great shock because the
  Commodore was looked upon as a man in the very prime of life. As a matter of
  fact, he was fifty-five, but so brisk, well-preserved and straight-backed a
  little man as to seem years younger. He used to drive on the Avenue in his
  open automobile, sitting up on the back seat with a haughty stare just like
  royalty, with his bodyguard sitting in front.</p>

  <p>I received my first news of the affair from Mme. Storey when she came into
  the office the following morning. The Varicks were friends of hers. Tossing a
  newspaper on my desk, she said:</p>

  <p>"Poor Bill Varick is gone. Shockingly sudden. I dined there two nights
  ago."</p>

  <p>She went on into her room and I read the paper. It had spread itself on
  the event, of course, for Commodore Varick was more than a mere individual,
  he was an institution. There was a three column head on the first page, and a
  half page obituary inside, reciting the Commodore's life story, and the
  history of his family. He was the fourth William Henry Varick of his line,
  and his name was woven into the very texture of the annals of New York if not
  of all America. In fact, all over the world, Varick has become a synonym for
  the American millionaire.</p>

  <p>The third William Henry left a number of sons and daughters, consequently
  the fourth William Henry, he whose obituary I was reading, did not inherit
  his entire fortune. But he was the head of the clan, and still an enormously
  rich man. This one's accomplishments had been mostly in the social line. He
  married an ambitious woman, and New York soon became too small for them.</p>

  <p>The title of Commodore had been bestowed on him by our most important
  yacht club. His yacht <i>Manahatta</i>, a dream of luxury, was a familiar
  sight in the harbours of the old world. Before the war he had entertained the
  King of England on board; besides King Leopold of Belgium and a host of
  lesser potentates. And, of course, he was always in the forefront when
  royalty visited our shores. The Princess Cristina von Habsburg was staying at
  his house at the moment of his death. The mere recital of his clubs filled a
  long paragraph, and all in all the newspaper did not exaggerate in terming
  him "our first private citizen."</p>

  <p>And now he was dead after half an hour's illness, and his mantle had
  fallen on the muscular shoulders of that delightful scapegrace, William Henry
  Varick fifth, better known as Hank Varick. In the newspapers of late, the
  fame of the Commodore himself had been overshadowed by the escapades of his
  son. I did not suppose that he was any worse than other young men, nor did I
  believe more than half I read about him. He was a sort of crown prince, and
  his slightest actions were, therefore, front page stuff.</p>

  <p>Apparently the reporters followed him all around the country on the chance
  of picking up copy. The stories were of the usual sort where youth,
  irresponsibility and wealth are in conjunction. He was handicapped by being
  an only child. At this time I had never seen him, but his oft published
  photographs depicted a handsome, stalwart, laughing young fellow. All the
  gifts of the gods were his.</p>

  <p>I was still reading the newspaper when Inspector Rumsey entered my office.
  Rumsey had an admirable command of his features, but at this moment he was
  plainly disconcerted. It startled me. "What's the matter?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"A bad business," he said curtly. He nodded towards the next room. "Is she
  down yet?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," I said. "Go right in."</p>

  <p>"You'd better come in, too," he said. "She'll want you to hear this."</p>

  <p>I locked the outer door to guard against interruptions, and followed him
  full of trepidation. I had never seen the matter-of-fact Inspector so upset,
  and it had the effect of a convulsion of nature.</p>

  <p>In the long room Mme. Storey, clad in one of the clinging Fortuny robes
  that become her so well, was lounging with her elbows on the big Italian
  table, a negligent cigarette in one hand, and in the other a lump of sugar
  that she was holding up for Giannino the ape to nibble at. At sight of our
  good friend's face, she straightened up and let Giannino have the lump of
  sugar. "What is wrong?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I'm in the deuce of a hole!" he said in a voice of extreme bitterness.
  "I'm a poor man, but I would give a thousand dollars to be away on my
  vacation this minute!"</p>

  <p>"Can I help?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"If you won't, nobody can," he said laconically.</p>

  <p>From his inside breast pocket he took an envelope and handed it to her. I
  was looking over her shoulder. It was a cheap commercial envelope of the sort
  that is sold by the million. It had come through the mail. It was addressed
  in block letters very painstakingly formed:</p><br>

  <p class="telegram">INSPECTOR RUMSEY<br>
  POLICE HEADQUARTERS<br>
  CITY</p>

  <p>Inside there was a little slip of white paper on which was lettered in the
  same manner:</p>

  <p class="telegram">COMMODORE VARICK WAS POISONED</p>

  <p>None of us spoke. For the space of thirty seconds or so the room was so
  still you could hear Giannino's little teeth nibbling at the sugar. The
  possibilities that loomed ahead of us were truly dreadful.</p>

  <p>Then the Inspector broke out: "There may be nothing in it. Very likely
  it's the work of the sort of crank that such an occasion always brings to
  light."</p>

  <p>"Yet, you've got to take notice of it," Mme. Storey put in quietly.</p>

  <p>"Sure," he cried, "that's the damnable part of it! There may be something
  in it. And if it should come out later that I had been warned, and had taken
  no action, I'd be ruined."</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"What am I going to do?" he echoed. "Push in amongst the cardinals and
  bishops and governors and senators who are leaving their cards at the house
  this morning, and demand that an autopsy be performed?"</p>

  <p>"It is a bad business," murmured Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"The reporters are there," he went on, "and even my appearance at the
  house at such time would be enough to start an ugly scandal. Or anybody
  connected with the department that I might send. And suppose I get my
  autopsy, and everything proves to be all right, the scandal will go on just
  the same. The public will never believe but that Commodore Varick was
  poisoned, and that we were all engaged in a conspiracy to hush it up. A nice
  figure I would cut!"</p>

  <p>"I see what you're getting at, Inspector," said my employer with a very
  dry smile.</p>

  <p>"You're a friend of Mrs. Varick's," he said cajolingly. "You could go to
  the house to leave your condolences without exciting any remark. I suppose
  you would be going there anyway this morning."</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Show her this communication privately," he went on, "and tell her from me
  that I am very reluctantly forced to insist on an autopsy. I'll send doctors
  not known to be connected with the department to the house at any hour she
  sets. It can be performed in perfect secrecy, and if everything proves to be
  all right, as I am sure it will, no whisper of it need ever reach the
  press."</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey arose and took a turn down the room. Her brows were knitted.
  "Really, Inspector, this is a bit thick!" she said. "You find yourself in a
  hole, and you're attempting to climb out on <i>my</i> shoulders! I think a
  lot of you, my friend, but..."</p>

  <p>"Oh, leave me out of it," he said earnestly. "I'm not thinking of myself
  so much as of the Varick family. I hate the idea of starting an unnecessary
  scandal at their expense. And with death in the house at that. Why, the
  reputation of a grand old family like that is like a work of art that cannot
  be replaced. I don't want to have a hand in defacing it. It's the property of
  the public, so to speak, and you and I are servants of the public, aren't
  we?"</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey smiled at his ingenious sophistry. While he was speaking she
  had made up her mind for quite different reasons. "Since you put it that way
  I can't very well refuse," she said ironically. "I will go. It is necessary
  to act quickly. I will change my dress. You will come with me, Bella."</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">The Varick house was a great palace of Vermont marble
  occupying a frontage of half a block on the Avenue, facing the Park. It was
  one of the older houses of that neighbourhood, and was already at this time
  becoming hemmed in by hotels and apartment houses; but it had been rebuilt
  and modernised on several occasions, and was still among the two or three
  most imposing dwellings in town. There was a grand effect in its severity and
  plainness that the French châteaux and Italian palazzi strive for in
  vain.</p>

  <p>We drove up in a taxicab which looked rather undignified amidst the long
  line of elegant private cars crawling up to the front door through the side
  street. But Mme. Storey cared nothing about that. The arrangements at the
  house were perfect, of course. There was a footman on the sidewalk to open
  the door of our car, another to open the great steel grille lined with plate
  glass, a third to receive our cards and to separate the sheep from the goats,
  and still others to usher us the way we should go. Back of them all stood the
  majestic figure of Jarboe, the Varick butler, overseeing all. All the men
  servants were dressed in black morning coats.</p>

  <p>This ceremony was taking place in a superb marble hall that ran right
  through the centre of the building flanked by a double row of antique marble
  pillars, and ending in a great bay filled with gigantic tropical ferns. In
  the centre of the hall was a little fountain of porphyry, and a great shallow
  stairway with a wrought steel balustrade swept up at the right. Among the
  visitors the merely great left their cards and went out again, but the very
  great were ushered into the state drawing-room at the left to be received by
  Mr. Varick's brother, while members of the family connection were ushered
  into a more intimate room on the right.</p>

  <p>We hardly belonged to any of these categories but Mme. Storey caught the
  eye of Mr. Jarboe who came directly to us, a signal honour. To him she
  whispered her request to be allowed to see Mrs. Varick.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Varick is seeing <i>nobody</i>," he answered with a slightly shocked
  air.</p>

  <p>"May I send her a message?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, Madame."</p>

  <p>She scribbled a few words on her card, and handed it to him. She asked if
  we might wait in a place where we would see nobody, and we were therefore
  shown into a soberly furnished office behind a masked door.</p>

  <p>Presently a footman came to say that Mrs. Varick would see Madame Storey,
  and led us, not up the great stairway, but into a little elevator hidden in
  the wall, where no one saw us enter. We alighted in another noble hall
  panelled in oak, and lighted by a great dome of Tiffany glass. There were a
  dozen doors all around, and I wondered mightily what was behind them all. Our
  conductor opened one of them, and we found ourselves in a foyer with more
  doors. The interior of that house was like a maze, and I wondered if the
  occupants ever got lost in it.</p>

  <p>The footman opened another door, and we found ourselves in Mrs. Varick's
  boudoir. I had merely the impression of an amber effect, luxurious and
  flattering to the complexion. The mistress of it all was seated in a
  <i>chaise longue</i> holding a cigarette between fingers that trembled
  slightly. She was most beautifully dressed, not all in black; black and
  white. I remember it struck me as strange that she should be wearing a hat.
  Later I learned that she never appeared in the daytime without one. It was a
  lovely French hat partly shadowing her face, and the whole effect was of some
  rare and exquisite orchid&mdash;a little withered. Servants were continually
  coming and going, and she was issuing instructions with a forced air of
  calmness very painful to see.</p>

  <p>While Mme. Storey approached her, I remained standing near the door. Thus
  I was out of earshot, but I could follow all that occurred with my eyes. Mrs.
  Varick was surprised to see my employer at such a time, and more than a
  little inclined to resent my presence. Mme. Storey hated what she had to
  do&mdash;I could tell it from her stony expression, but went about it
  directly and simply. Finally she drew the fateful slip of paper from its
  envelope, and showed it to Mrs. Varick.</p>

  <p>When the widow read the words upon it, she forgot that she was a great
  lady. A little strangled cry escaped her, and she clapped the back of her
  hand to her mouth, that piteous gesture common to all women. Several of the
  women in the room ran to her side, but she waved them back.</p>

  <p>"Leave me! Leave me!" she said sharply. "...All except you!" She clung to
  a slender blonde girl in black. This, I presently learned was her personal
  secretary, Estelle Gilsey. "Look! Estelle, look!" she whispered, showing the
  slip.</p>

  <p>The girl cried out strangely, seemed about to faint. This, I remember,
  struck me as rather excessive in one who was merely a paid employee.</p>

  <p>I drew a little closer to the group. To Mme. Storey, I heard Mrs. Varick
  say in a strained voice: "But this is probably the work of some
  mischief-maker, some insane person!"</p>

  <p>"That is what we think," said my employer.</p>

  <p>"Then why torment me with such a suggestion?"</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey patiently explained the situation.</p>

  <p>"Oh, why isn't Henry here!" mourned Mrs. Varick. She referred to her son.
  It appeared that nobody knew where he was. They were telegraphing all over
  the country for him.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Varick angrily repudiated the suggestion of an autopsy, and my
  employer with the greatest gentleness and patience undertook to show her that
  she had no choice in the matter, that even the great Mrs. Varick was amenable
  to the commands of the law, and that we were all working to save her
  feelings, and the feelings of the family so far as it might be done. Finally,
  with a flood of tears she gave in. The tears relieved her, I think. The
  secretary did not cry; throughout all that followed, white-faced and stunned,
  she was a more tragic figure than the widow.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Varick clung to my employer's hand now. "Rosika, you manage
  everything," she said imploringly. "You are so wonderfully capable! There is
  nobody else I can trust. Oh, keep it out of the newspapers! And above all,
  don't let my husband's family know!"</p>

  <p>"I will do my best," said Mme. Storey gravely.</p>

  <p>In two minutes she had Inspector Rumsey on the wire, and within a quarter
  of an hour, the three doctors appointed by the police department had been
  admitted to the house by a rear door. They were all men of discretion, and in
  order to guard against possible leakages, they had volunteered to conduct the
  autopsy entirely by themselves without the usual assistants. The body of Mr.
  Varick was still lying in his bedroom, and there they operated. No one else
  was permitted in the room. The servants, I think, must have suspected what
  was going on, but they were wonderfully loyal. No whisper of it was ever
  revealed.</p>

  <p>During the dreadful period of suspense that followed, Mme. Storey and I
  remained in the boudoir with Mrs. Varick and Miss Gilsey. My employer having
  explained who I was, Mrs. Varick no longer resented my presence. She lit one
  cigarette after another in her trembling hands, and tossed them away after a
  puff or two. I do not remember that a single word was exchanged. I spent the
  time looking at Miss Gilsey who was very beautiful, and who seemed to be of a
  gentle and open nature; but she was like one who had received a blow on the
  head, not quite all there. I wondered at it.</p>

  <p>At length Dr. Pulford the senior of the three physicians, came in. His
  face was like a mask, revealing nothing. He said in measured tones:</p>

  <p>"I regret to have to inform you that Commodore Varick met his death as a
  result of having taken poison through the mouth. It was one of the alkaloids,
  probably aconite, which is the most powerful of the alkaloids, but it will
  require an analysis to determine that for certain."</p>

  <p>With a sigh like an infant, Mrs. Varick fell over sideways into the arms
  of her secretary. The girl's face was like death.</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">Dr. Pulford brought Mrs. Varick around by simple measures.
  The poor woman then went off into a helpless, shaken weeping, very affecting
  to see. But notwithstanding her high position, her air of authority, she was
  a shallow woman. Her husband's untimely end did not distress her so much as
  the threatened family disgrace. The girl, Estelle Gilsey, who never made a
  sound, took it much harder, really; but I couldn't tell what was the nature
  of her feeling, whether grief, horror, fear or guilt.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Varick's whole cry was to keep it out of the newspapers. "Rosika, I
  depend on you for that," she wept, fondling my employer's hand.</p>

  <p>"My own idea would be to keep it secret as long as possible," said Mme.
  Storey dryly, "simply in order that the guilty person might not escape.
  However, the police must decide."</p>

  <p>"The police!" cried Mrs. Varick. "Oh, keep them out of the house! That
  would kill me! Rosika, you take charge of everything. I engage you for that
  purpose. Money, you know, is no object."</p>

  <p>"But I could not accept an engagement on such terms," said Mme. Storey.
  "My object would be the same as that of the police, to discover the
  truth."</p>

  <p>"Of course! Of course!" cried the weeping woman. "But you do it. They
  ought to let you do it. You are far cleverer. Keep the police out of the
  house!"</p>

  <p>"Inspector Rumsey must decide that," said my employer. "...There is one
  thing that I would recommend," she added. "Under the circumstances a public
  funeral would scarcely be permitted. Let all the arrangements be cancelled,
  and let it be given out that Commodore Varick is to be buried privately at
  the convenience of the family."</p>

  <p>"Even that would create a scandal!" cried Mrs. Varick.</p>

  <p>"But not so great a scandal as the other," remarked Mme. Storey dryly.</p>

  <p>"Have the orders given!" cried the distraught widow.</p>

  <p>When Dr. Pulford took his leave, Mme. Storey signed to me to detain him
  outside the room. There she presently joined us.</p>

  <p>"Can you add anything to what you have told us?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He shook his head. "Not much at this time. Commodore Varick died as the
  result of having taken a powerful dose of a poison, probably aconite."</p>

  <p>"A very large dose?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Madam, it must have killed him almost instantly. Well, in half an
  hour perhaps; in an hour at the outside."</p>

  <p>"Putting aside the possibility of suicide for the moment, how could he
  have been induced to take it?"</p>

  <p>Dr. Pulford shrugged and spread out his hands. "How can one say? It is
  true that aconite, like all the alkaloids, has an intensely bitter taste, but
  on the other hand, an infinitesimal quantity would be sufficient. As small a
  quantity as one three-hundredth of a grain is enough to set up symptoms. How
  much Commodore Varick got I cannot say; half a grain, maybe."</p>

  <p>"Could it have been administered in tea or coffee?"</p>

  <p>"It is possible."</p>

  <p>"Could the symptoms have been mistaken for those of gastritis?"</p>

  <p>"Evidently they were," returned Dr. Pulford dryly. "Was there only one
  physician present when he died?"</p>

  <p>"Only Dr. Slingluff, the family physician."</p>

  <p>"A very distinguished man," said Dr. Pulford prudently. "It seems a little
  strange, but I should not like to commit myself."</p>

  <p>"Is there any antidote for aconite poisoning?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"Atropine," he answered promptly.</p>

  <p>"Could aconite in so highly concentrated a form be readily procured?" was
  her next question.</p>

  <p>"It is in the pharmacopoeia," he said. "Aconitina is the terra applied to
  the alkaloid. Therapeutically it is little used nowadays; it would be
  difficult to obtain, but possible."</p>

  <p>"One last question, doctor. In poisoning cases of this sort, does the
  victim retain consciousness until the end, or near the end?"</p>

  <p>"It is usual," he said gravely.</p>

  <p>"Thank you very much."</p>

  <p>He went away. We had no sooner returned to the boudoir than a footman
  entered to announce that Dr. Slingluff was in the house and wished to know if
  Mrs. Varick desired to see him. Mme. Storey and I exchanged a glance. Coming
  at this moment, it seemed almost as if the family doctor had received some
  intimation through the air of what was going on. At Mme. Storey's suggestion
  Mrs. Varick retired to her bedroom, and we waited in the boudoir for Dr.
  Slingluff. It was curious to see how completely my employer had assumed
  command in the great house. From Mrs. Varick down, all yielded her implicit
  obedience. At such moments Mme. Storey is very impressive. Her beautiful face
  becomes as cold and grave as a sybil's. Only the glowing dark eyes reveal the
  forces within.</p>

  <p>Dr. Slingluff was in the forefront of his profession. Having started many
  years before as a general practitioner, he had gradually won to a commanding
  position as a heart specialist. It was only for the Varicks and a few other
  old family friends that he still acted as a general consultant. He was a
  handsome, dignified man about sixty, with an open face, a man you would like
  ordinarily; but I noticed that he changed colour at the mention of my
  employer's name; in fact, I saw a fine sweat spring out on his forehead, and
  that hardened my heart against him.</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey went to the point as directly as an arrow.</p>

  <p>"I am Rosika Storey," she said. "Mrs. Varick has asked me to see you. It
  has been discovered that Commodore Varick met his death by poison. For the
  moment, I am acting for the police."</p>

  <p>At the word "poison" the doctor went staggering back, and his face became
  ghastly. <i>But he was not surprised</i>. "Oh, my God!" he gasped. "Who told
  them?"</p>

  <p>This answer clearly revealed guilty knowledge, but for the moment Mme.
  Storey affected not to notice it.</p>

  <p>"I am not at liberty to divulge that," she said.</p>

  <p>He made a desperate effort to recover himself. "Poison!" he said,
  straightening up; "this is preposterous!"</p>

  <p>"It was revealed by an autopsy."</p>

  <p>He was freshly shaken. "An autopsy!" he stammered. "Without my
  knowledge."</p>

  <p>"By order of the police," said Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>Some moments passed before he could give a coherent account of the
  death-bed scene. "At a few minutes before five yesterday," he finally began,
  "I was called to the telephone by William Gabbitt, the Commodore's valet.
  Gabbitt told me that his master was very sick; that he had found him lying
  helpless on the floor of his bedroom; that it seemed to be a gastric attack
  such as he had had before, only worse. So I hastily gathered a few things
  together, digitalis..."</p>

  <p>"Digitalis?" she interrupted, "what was that for?"</p>

  <p>"Heart," he said, "that was the danger. I instructed my secretary to
  telephone for Orrin, the stomach specialist, and I ran here&mdash;I live just
  around the corner. I was here within five minutes of receiving the call, but
  I instantly saw that my old friend was done for; he was already at the point
  of collapse."</p>

  <p>"Who was with him?"</p>

  <p>"Gabbitt, and Jarboe, the butler. I sent for Mrs. Varick, but she was out
  of the house. I wouldn't allow anybody else in the room. I did all the things
  that one does, but it was too late. I sent Gabbitt running to my office for
  atropine, and Jarboe to the pantry for an ice-pack. Before either of them got
  back the Commodore was dead."</p>

  <p>"Atropine?" said Mme. Storey, softly, "is that a gastric remedy?"</p>

  <p>"I wanted it to accelerate the beating of his heart."</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you bring it with you?"</p>

  <p>"One can't foresee everything."</p>

  <p>"Then you were alone with him when he died?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Why did you send Jarboe out of the room? There were plenty of
  footmen."</p>

  <p>"To tell you the truth, I couldn't bear to have a servant see my friend in
  such an extremity."</p>

  <p>"Was he conscious?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot say for certain. He was incapable of speaking."</p>

  <p>"Then he said nothing to you before he died?"</p>

  <p>"Not a word, Madame."</p>

  <p>"H'm!" said Mme. Storey. I knew the same thought was in her mind as in my
  own; that it was very painful to see a naturally decent and upright man
  struggling to tell a convincing lie. I wondered what <i>had</i> taken place
  in that death chamber.</p>

  <p>"Was it not rather unwise to have no other witness to his death?" asked
  Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>Dr. Slingluff drew himself up. "Well, I did not expect anybody to accuse
  me of having poisoned my friend," he said with dignity.</p>

  <p>"Nobody has," said Mme. Storey mildly. "Had you no doubts as to the cause
  of death when you signed the certificate?"</p>

  <p>"I would not have signed it if I had had. Doctor Orrin joined with me in
  signing it when he came."</p>

  <p>"Did he suggest an autopsy?"</p>

  <p>"No, he was quite satisfied with my explanation. Every one of us makes
  mistakes."</p>

  <p>"This one is likely to have important results for you, doctor," said my
  employer mildly.</p>

  <p>"Ruinous!" he cried in despair.</p>

  <p>While she was still questioning him, we heard the sounds of a commotion
  out in the middle of the house, a new voice, young and ringing. At the sound
  of it, Dr. Slingluff turned paler still.</p>

  <p>"Henry!" he gasped. "Oh, God! I can't face him now!"</p>

  <p>With that he turned and fled through a door. It gave on some sort of
  service passage. Presumably he knew his way about the house. Mme Storey and I
  looked at each other.</p>

  <p>"Shouldn't he be stopped?" I said.</p>

  <p>"He is not the sort of man who can escape," she said. "We can always find
  him."</p>

  <p>"Was it <i>he</i>?" I stammered.</p>

  <p>She slowly shook her head. "He wouldn't have sent for the antidote," she
  said.</p>

  <p>"But he knows who did it!"</p>

  <p>"So it would seem," she said with her most cryptic air.<br></p>

  <p>A young man burst into the room, followed by several persons. I don't know
  who they were, servants of some sort, I assume. All these people moved
  surrounded by a mob of dependants of one sort and another. The young man
  turned around and waving his arms, cried: "Get out! Get out!" They melted
  silently through the door, and closed it.</p>

  <p>I recognised the heir to the Varick millions, a handsome young giant with
  a mop of tawny hair, and eyes as blue as the sea. At the first sight of him
  something went out of me to him that I could not get back again. I soon
  learned that it was the same with everybody, man, woman or child, but
  especially women, of course. I could even see by the softened expression in
  Mme. Storey's eyes that she felt it, too. I cannot explain it; he was
  handsome and vigorous, but so is many another young man who leaves you cold.
  I do not care for young men, as a rule. This one had the combined attraction
  of a boy and a man, but that was not the whole of it. There was something you
  could not resist. If he had been a longshoreman's son it would have been the
  same.</p>

  <p>At the moment the tears were coursing down his cheeks. He was quite
  unashamed of his emotion. In fact, he was so distraught by emotion that he
  accepted the finding of two strangers in his mother's boudoir as a matter of
  course. He started speaking as if he had always known us.</p>

  <p>"My father!" he cried, searching our faces for some hope. "Is it true? Is
  it true? Is he dead?"</p>

  <p>"He is dead," said Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"Oh, nobody will ever know what this means to me!" he cried, clapping his
  hands to his head. "Fathers always die, of course, but this is different!" He
  turned to us again with streaming eyes. "Because I was a bad son to him! a
  bad son! And now I can never make it up to him!"</p>

  <p>His mother heard his voice and came running in from her bedroom, followed
  by her secretary. She precipitated herself into her son's arms. From his
  protective attitude one might have supposed him to be the parent.</p>

  <p>"Poor little mother!" he crooned. "Poor little mother! This is hard on
  you!"</p>

  <p>But a strange thing happened. Over his mother's head he exchanged a look
  of the most poignant meaning with the girl behind her. Their very souls were
  in that glance, then both quickly lowered their eyes. Mme. Storey did not
  miss that swift look, of course. I knew it by her great carelessness of
  manner.</p>

  <p>I could not bear to be present at so intimate a family scene, and I turned
  my back on it. But I could not avoid hearing what went on; the widow's
  self-pitying complaints, and her son's clumsy attempts to comfort her. There
  was something shocking in seeing the great Mrs. Varick go all to pieces. The
  exquisite and flower-like woman was sadly wilted now. So incoherent and
  disconnected was her speech that it gave no hint of the real situation beyond
  the fact that her husband had died with frightful suddenness. In the end the
  girl spoke, electrifying us all by saying, in a curiously breathless voice:
  "Henry, your father was poisoned. There has been an autopsy."</p>

  <p>He dropped his mother, and stepped back. "Poisoned!" he said hoarsely.
  "Poisoned!...Then God help us all!"</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey caught my arm and led me from the room. The others never
  noticed whether we were there or not. In the little foyer I resisted,
  thinking of my employer's duty in the case.</p>

  <p>"It is terrible!" I said, "but should you not stay? Will not the truth
  come out?"</p>

  <p>"Enough has come out for my present purpose," she said dryly.</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p class="first">We made a tour of Commodore Varick's private suite under
  guidance of Gabbitt, the English valet. This Gabbitt was a quaint-looking
  person, like the figure of a barber out of an old-fashioned print; a neat,
  brisk, spare little man with a great bush of hair that looked as if it had
  been artificially curled. One expected to see a comb sticking in it ready for
  use. It would have been impossible to guess the man's age. It transpired that
  he had served the Commodore for over twenty years. He was devoted to his
  master, but took the present situation very philosophically. He had the air
  of a man who has seen so much that nothing can astonish him any more. He
  answered Mme. Storey's questions promptly and with seeming candour. It did
  not appear to occur to him that, as one of the last persons who had seen
  Commodore Varick alive, he might be under suspicion too.</p>

  <p>First we entered a plainly-furnished room at the north end of the second
  floor, that Gabbitt called the office. There was a young woman operating a
  typewriter here, who neither paused in her work nor so much as looked around
  when we passed through. This struck me as strange. I wondered what on earth
  she could be writing at such a time. Adjoining the office was the Commodore's
  study, a handsome corner room corresponding to Mrs. Varick's boudoir at the
  other end of the house. It was luxuriously furnished in masculine style with
  immense leather-covered easy-chairs grouped round the fireplace, and many
  rare sporting prints hanging from the panelled walls.</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey's first examination of this room was hasty, but she did not
  miss much. A sheet of paper lying with others on an open escritoire attracted
  her attention. There was a drawer below with a key in it. She put the paper
  in the drawer, locked it and took the key. "Something I will study later,"
  she said.</p>

  <p>Outside the study there was a little foyer, and from that a short passage
  leading to the other rooms of the suite. Opening off the passage were, in
  order, a serving pantry, a little bedroom for Gabbitt, and the Commodore's
  bathroom. Here Mme. Storey opened a wall cabinet. Her eyes skated rapidly
  over the miscellaneous articles on the shelves, and fastened on two kinds of
  medicine; a liquid, and some capsules in a little pasteboard box. She asked
  what they were.</p>

  <p>"Digitalis in the bottle, 'm," said Gabbitt. "For the heart. Fifteen drops
  in water three times a day. The capsules were for the digestion; one after
  every meal."</p>

  <p>"The Commodore was taking these at present?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, ma'am. The prescriptions were refilled regular."</p>

  <p>We took these medicines, and afterwards sent them to a chemist to be
  analysed.</p>

  <p>Next came the dressing-room, another comfortable lounging place, with a
  dressing-table, chiffoniers, and with clothes presses built into the walls.
  Beyond it was the Commodore's bedroom, where his body still lay. A man was on
  guard there. I averted my eyes from the bed. Mme. Storey did not examine the
  body at this time, but merely inquired what lay beyond the farther door. It
  was Mrs. Varick's bedroom, Gabbitt said, and beyond that were the other rooms
  of her suite. Both suites extended along the Fifth Avenue front of the house.
  Between the two of them, these little people, neither of whom exceeded five
  feet six in height, spread themselves over eight or more immense private
  chambers. Such is earthly glory!</p>

  <p>We returned to the study, where Mme. Storey questioned Gabbitt at some
  length. The valet told how he had been having tea in the servants' hall when
  a call over the house 'phone summoned him to his master. He found the
  Commodore lying in agony upon the floor of the dressing-room. I omit the
  harrowing details. Assisting his master to his bed, Gabbitt telephoned for
  the doctor and for Jarboe. He tried to get Mrs. Varick, but she was out of
  the house. During the brief interval that elapsed before the arrival of the
  doctor, the valet applied what restoratives his experience suggested.</p>

  <p>"Gabbitt, did you suspect poison?" Mme. Storey asked. (I ought to state
  that the valet knew by this time what had happened.)</p>

  <p>"Well, ma'am," he answered, "I think the thought was somewhere in the back
  of my head, but I did not acknowledge it. Being but a servant, I left it to
  my betters."</p>

  <p>In one respect Gabbitt's story differed sharply from Dr. Slingluff's. Up
  to the moment that he was sent out for atropine, the Commodore's mind, he
  insisted, was perfectly clear. The sick man would allow no one to be sent for
  but his wife and the doctor. He evinced an agonising anxiety lest the doctor
  might not come in time, but it was not with any idea that he could be saved.
  He knew he was dying.</p>

  <p>"Did he suggest that he had been poisoned?"</p>

  <p>"No, ma'am, no! He kept sayin' it was gastritis."</p>

  <p>"H'm!" said Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"He said one thing that was strange," Gabbitt went on, biting his
  lip&mdash;it was the first evidence of emotion the little man had shown; "He
  says, 'Gabbitt, if I should go out of my head, I beg of you never to repeat
  what I say! Bury it in your breast!'" The little valet turned away and made
  believe to arrange some objects on the table. "That hurt me, ma'am," he
  murmured. "But I didn't let on anything. I just pressed his hand, and he
  seemed satisfied...As if I would have given him away! After twenty
  years!..."</p>

  <p>He straightened up and went on in his ordinary voice: "There was no need
  for me to go for the atropine, but I got the idea the Commodore had something
  private to tell the doctor, so I left the room. I have seen men die before,
  and I knew that neither atropine nor nothing else could save my master then.
  I wasn't gone but ten minutes. When I got back he was dead."</p>

  <p>"Gabbitt," said Mme. Storey, "who was the last person he saw before he was
  taken sick?"</p>

  <p>"Why, ma'am, so far as I know it was Miss Priestley," was the answer. "Him
  and her had their tea together every afternoon at four when he was home."</p>

  <p>"Miss Priestley?"</p>

  <p>"His secretary, 'm. That is to say, his literary secretary. That is the
  young lady who is working the typewriter in the next room."</p>

  <p>"Why do you call her literary secretary?"</p>

  <p>"To distinguish her from his private secretary and his financial
  secretary. Those two are gentlemen. The Commodore was writing his memoirs,
  and Miss Priestley was engaged to help him with that. Every afternoon from
  two until four, when his engagements permitted, they worked together, and
  after tea the young lady went home."</p>

  <p>"And tea was served yesterday as usual?"</p>

  <p>"Yes'm. I took it in myself from Hannaford, one of the maids, and set it
  out on this very table. Then I called my master, and went down to my own tea
  in the servants' hall."</p>

  <p>"What did the tea consist of?"</p>

  <p>"Just thin bread and butter, 'm, and a plain cake. The Commodore ate very
  plain, along of his gastritis, but he does love his tea&mdash;did love it, I
  mean. He would drink two or three cups of an afternoon."</p>

  <p>"Gabbitt, tell me the exact arrangement of the tea tray," said my
  employer. While she listened to him, she lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Yes'm. All they sent up from downstairs was the bread and butter and the
  cake; also cream if required; the Commodore did not use it himself. The
  Commodore's own special brand of tea I keep up here in a silver tea-caddy,
  also the silver kettle which plugs into an electric outlet. The Commodore had
  his own notions about how tea should be made; he wanted every cup made
  separate. So the tea was put into silver tea balls which were dipped into the
  cups after the boiling water was drawn."</p>

  <p>"Did the Commodore do this himself?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, 'm. If there was a lady at the table she did the honours."</p>

  <p>"Did the Commodore take his tea weak or strong?"</p>

  <p>"Very strong, 'm. He liked to taste it bitter."</p>

  <p>"Did the Commodore and Miss Priestley always have tea alone together?"</p>

  <p>"No, 'm. There might be other guests from time to time. Or if the
  Commodore had special guests, Miss Priestley might take her tea in the
  housekeeper's room."</p>

  <p>"When you were called back upstairs had the tea things been removed?"</p>

  <p>"I can't say, ma'am. I was too excited to take notice. After my master was
  dead I tidied up, not knowin' what else to do. They was gone then."</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey pressed out the lighted end of her cigarette in an ash tray.
  "All right, Gabbitt; thank you very much," she said. "We had better talk to
  Miss Priestley, since she is close at hand."</p>

  <h3>V</h3>

  <p class="first">When we entered the office for the second time, the girl
  arose from her machine and turned around as if she had guessed what we came
  for. I was astonished when I saw her. Certainly the Varicks, both husband and
  wife, had a flair for beauty in choosing those who served them. Miss
  Priestley was a very Juno, a maiden Juno, tall and dark with Juno's short
  upper lip, straight nose and haughty glance. Superb! However, I withheld my
  judgment for a while because I have learned that these goddess-like shells
  sometimes house very small souls. I wondered if the solution to the mystery
  lay in her. She was visibly all keyed up, but that was natural. She had
  herself under good control.</p>

  <p>She knew as much as Gabbitt did of the situation, consequently it was not
  necessary to enter into explanations. My employer introduced herself, and, in
  order to persuade the girl to relax, murmured the obvious things about what a
  sad occasion it was, etc., etc. The secretary rose to it like any
  woman&mdash;in words, but with a curiously monotonous voice like a child
  repeating a lesson. Her remote glance did not share in what she was saying.
  She was like a beautiful statue with a phonograph inside it.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I have lost more than my job here," she said, "I have lost a friend.
  All I can do for him now is to finish his work." She waved her hand towards
  the machine.</p>

  <p>"Sit down," said Mme. Storey soothingly. "I am told that you were perhaps
  the last person to see the Commodore before he was taken sick, and I look to
  you to help me."</p>

  <p>"Certainly," said Miss Priestley&mdash;but she did not sit. "Anything I
  can do. However, I am not the one you are looking for."</p>

  <p>Her odd manner intrigued my employer. "No?" she said with half a smile.
  She was studying the girl through her lashes.</p>

  <p>The secretary went on in her toneless voice: "You have been told that I
  had tea with the Commodore yesterday, but I did not."</p>

  <p>"Who did?"</p>

  <p>She made a slight gesture with her hand. "Secrecy was enjoined upon me,
  but I suppose everything has got to come out now. It was the Princess
  Cristina von Habsburg."</p>

  <p>The amused look faded out of Mme. Storey's eyes. "So?" she said quietly.
  "What were the circumstances?"</p>

  <p>"Commodore Varick wished to have a private talk with the Princess without
  anybody in the house knowing about it. Everything is gossiped about so. The
  Princess is staying in the house. As soon as the tea had been brought, and
  Gabbitt had gone down to his tea, I was sent to fetch her. Her suite is on
  the south side of the house. I brought her to the door of the Commodore's
  study, and then I went down and had tea with Mrs. Colford in her room."</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Colford being the housekeeper?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"What did Commodore Varick want to talk to the Princess about?"</p>

  <p>Miss Priestley answered with a perfectly expressionless face: "I don't
  know. That is outside my province."</p>

  <p>It was pretty clear that she was lying here, but it would have done no
  good to tax her with it. Mme. Storey went on: "How long did she remain in his
  study?"</p>

  <p>"I can't tell you. I did not see her again. After I had finished my tea, I
  went home. That was before the news of the Commodore's illness had got about.
  I knew nothing of it until I read it in the newspaper this morning."</p>

  <p>"What a shock it must have given you!" murmured Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the girl. Not a muscle of her face changed when she said it.
  An extraordinary person.</p>

  <p>"Where is the Princess now?" asked my employer.</p>

  <p>"I understand that she has left the house, but I cannot tell you where she
  has gone."</p>

  <p>"Let us ask Jarboe." My employer looked about the room. "May I ring?"</p>

  <p>"The telephone is quicker," said Miss Priestley. She took down the
  receiver, and said in the same cold toneless voice: "Please ask Mr. Jarboe to
  come to the Commodore's office for a moment."</p>

  <p>While we waited for Jarboe, Mme. Storey lit a cigarette. Miss Priestley
  declined one. My employer sauntered about the room making polite
  conversation. But I knew of old that her mind was not necessarily idle when
  she was making idle talk. I could see that her eyes were busy; I could see
  too, that the secretary was covertly watching her with a strained air; and
  for the dozenth time that day I asked myself: What dreadful secret does this
  grand house conceal!</p>

  <p>Jarboe was quickly at the door. He knew that Mme. Storey was a person to
  be deferred to. She asked him at once what had become of the Princess.</p>

  <p>Jarboe, of course, had had to be taken into the family confidence as far
  as anybody, but he was the butler of butlers, and though murder stalked
  through the house, there was not the slightest alteration in his usual
  demeanour. His superb aplomb might have concealed anything&mdash;or nothing.
  He said:</p>

  <p>"Her Highness left the house shortly after four yesterday afternoon,
  Madame."</p>

  <p>"Did you see her go?"</p>

  <p>"No, Madame, nobody saw her leave except Wilcox the footman, who was
  attending upon the front door."</p>

  <p>"What did he tell you?"</p>

  <p>"He told me that the Princess came running downstairs alone, in a high
  state of agitation. In fact, she was weeping. Wilcox was very much upset. He
  thought it most unseemly that her Highness should appear upon the street in
  such state, and he hesitated about opening the door. She stamped her foot,
  and commanded him to open it, and of course, he had no recourse but to obey.
  He came immediately to tell me, and I went to the Princess's suite. I found
  that her lady-in-waiting, Madame von Hofstetter, did not know that the
  Princess had left the house. She was greatly upset. However..."</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute," interrupted Mme. Storey; "did she have no hat on when she
  ran out of the house?"</p>

  <p>Miss Priestley answered. "She already had her hat on when I fetched
  her."</p>

  <p>"I see. Go on, please, Jarboe."</p>

  <p>"While I was still talking to Madame von Hofstetter," he continued, "the
  telephone rang, and it was the Princess. She ordered Madame von Hofstetter
  and her maids to follow her immediately to the Hotel Madagascar. They packed
  very hastily, and left within half an hour."</p>

  <p>"Then they were all out of the house before the alarm of the Commodore's
  illness was raised?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Madame. I sent the trunks to the hotel later."</p>

  <p>"Have you any idea of the reason for the Princess's abrupt departure?"</p>

  <p>"None whatever, Madame."</p>

  <p>Who could say if he was telling the truth?</p>

  <p>My employer turned to me. "Well, let us go ask her, Bella."</p>

  <p>It turned out that there was quite a crowd hanging about the front door,
  which included both reporters and photographers. It was of the highest
  importance that our comings and goings should not be remarked, so Jarboe put
  us into a car in the rear courtyard of the house. We pulled down the curtains
  and got out unseen.</p>

  <p>"Big game, Bella!" said my employer to me with a curious dry smile. "The
  Princess is a member of one of the greatest houses of the old world. Her
  ancestors have ruled for centuries. The ex-King of Saxony is her
  brother-in-law, I believe, and she calls the King of England cousin. It is
  the first time we have stalked Royalty!"</p>

  <p>"How strange that Priestley girl's manner was," I said.</p>

  <p>"That in itself signifies nothing," she answered. "Everybody in the house
  was acting strangely. Except Gabbitt. Perhaps Gabbitt did it. He was the only
  one who had his wits about him."</p>

  <p>But I did not think she was speaking seriously.</p>

  <p>In three minutes we were at the Madagascar. Mme. Storey asked for the
  manager. We did not suppose, of course, that the Princess had registered
  under her own name. "A young foreign lady of high position," said my
  employer. "She came yesterday alone, and was followed later by her companion,
  and several maids."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you mean the Countess von Hilgenreiner," said the manager. "She left
  an hour ago to go on board the <i>Baratoria</i>."</p>

  <p>An exclamation was forced from my employer. "Good heavens! And the
  <i>Baratoria</i> sails at three!"</p>

  <p>Our eyes flew to the clock on the wall. The hands pointed to ten minutes
  to three. And the pier was three miles away, the streets crowded with
  traffic! We ran out of the office leaving the manager staring.</p>

  <p>"Quick, Bella," cried Mme. Storey. "Jump in that car at the door and drive
  as fast as you can to the ship. Go down Tenth Avenue."</p>

  <p>"I can't possibly make it!" I stammered.</p>

  <p>"Go!" she cried. "The ship is connected by telephone. I will get the
  Commander on the wire and ask him to wait for you. Tell him that there are
  police reasons for detaining the Countess von Hilgenreiner, or whatever she
  calls herself. I will follow you as soon as I can pick up Inspector Rumsey.
  We will need official support in this."</p>

  <h3>VI</h3>

  <p class="first">The <i>Baratoria</i> was queen of the Brevard line fleet,
  and her commander was a knight, Sir Everard Bertram, R.N.R., K.C.M.G., and
  goodness knows what else beside. I was greatly relieved to see the liner's
  huge bulk and her four mighty red funnels towering over the pier when I
  arrived. Evidently the telephone message had got through. On the pier
  everything was at a standstill; the passengers lining the ship's rails and a
  great crowd of friends filling the pier openings, everybody wondering no
  doubt why she did not sail. The gangplanks were still in place and I hastened
  aboard. At the head of the gangplank a cabin boy was waiting to conduct me to
  the Captain.</p>

  <p>I found him pacing his cabin, watch in hand, a magnificent personage,
  resplendent in gold braid. Mme. Storey has crossed with him many times, and
  he knew me by sight. His face cleared when I entered.</p>

  <p>"Here you are!" he said. "I thought I recognised Mme. Storey's voice over
  the telephone, but I feared it might be a hoax. What is the trouble?"</p>

  <p>"There is a lady aboard who is wanted by the police," I said.</p>

  <p>"What is her name?" he asked, picking up a passenger list.</p>

  <p>"When we last met her she was calling herself the Countess von
  Hilgenreiner. She won't be on your list because her decision to sail was a
  sudden one."</p>

  <p>"What's her right name?"</p>

  <p>"Please wait until Mme. Storey comes," I begged him. "She has stopped only
  to pick up a police official."</p>

  <p>In a minute or two my employer came sauntering in, perfectly cool and
  smiling. She and the Captain greeted each other as old friends. She said
  immediately:</p>

  <p>"I won't waste your time, Sir Everard. I can rely on your discretion. The
  person we want is the Princess Cristina von Habsburg."</p>

  <p>"Good God!" he cried in dismay. "A royal princess! What a frightful
  scandal this will let loose!"</p>

  <p>"I have it in mind," said my employer dryly. "Is she aboard?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I have spoken to her. I had them put her into the Tudor suite on B
  deck. What is she wanted for?"</p>

  <p>"At the moment, as a material witness only. No charge has been laid."</p>

  <p>"Have you the police back of you?" he asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey opened her handbag. "Here is a warrant for her arrest.
  Furthermore, if you will look over the side you will see Inspector Rumsey
  there in a police launch. I didn't want him to show himself to the reporters
  on the pier. They hailed me, but I told them I was just coming aboard to bid
  good-bye to a friend."</p>

  <p>"But when you take her ashore the jig will be up. The reporters have
  interviewed her."</p>

  <p>"I don't want to take her ashore," said Mme. Storey coolly. "I want the
  reporters to think that she has sailed for Europe. It is of the utmost
  importance that the frightful scandal you speak of should not be released
  prematurely."</p>

  <p>"Then what do you propose to do?"</p>

  <p>"I have sailed on vessels when belated passengers were put on board
  through a door in the hull," said Mme. Storey. "When you get straightened out
  in midstream can't you open a door on the side hidden from the pier, and put
  her aboard one of the tugs? The tug can steam off up the river, and by-and-by
  the police launch will overhaul her, and receive the Princess."</p>

  <p>By this time Sir Everard had read the warrant. "Very well," he said. "It
  shall be done."</p>

  <p>"Then come on, Bella," said my employer briskly. "We mustn't hold up the
  <i>Baratoria</i> a moment longer than necessary."</p>

  <p>The bravest of men is subject to terror in some form or another. The
  magnificent Sir Everard turned pale. "Good God, Madame Storey," he cried,
  "don't leave me to face that woman alone! Picture me putting a royal princess
  aboard the tug kicking!"</p>

  <p>My employer laughed. It was the first time I had heard that silvery sound
  all day.</p>

  <p>The Captain saw nothing funny in the situation. "Come with me and prepare
  her for what is to follow," he urged. "The <i>Baratoria</i> can wait for
  that."</p>

  <p>"All right," she said. "Lead the way."</p>

  <p>A moment later we were knocking at a door opening from a corridor on B
  deck. It was opened to us by a worried little lady, very elegant in a German
  fashion, evidently Madame von Hofstetter. Over her shoulder I glimpsed a
  delightful little sitting-room with doors opening to the right and left.</p>

  <p>"Compliments," said the Captain with stiff courtesy; "I should like to
  speak to the Princess for a moment."</p>

  <p>"I am very sorry," said the lady-in-waiting in excellent English, "but her
  Highness is seeing nobody."</p>

  <p>"I am more than sorry," said Sir Everard dryly, "but I am the Commander of
  this vessel, and it shall not sail until I have spoken with the
  Princess."</p>

  <p>She had no recourse then but to give way. We entered the room. She tried
  to make a stand against Mme. Storey and me,</p>

  <p>"Who are these persons?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"Representatives of the police," said Sir Everard dryly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, <i>Mein Gott</i>!" cried the little lady, and made haste to shut the
  door behind us. "I will prepare the Princess," she said tremulously, and
  started to move towards one of the doors.</p>

  <p>But Sir Everard was before her at the door. "Pardon me," he said; "there
  is no time for that. The ship waits. These ladies must be admitted to the
  Princess immediately. I will wait here."</p>

  <p>So Mme. Storey and I entered the adjoining room, a bedroom. It was the
  first time I had ever been so close to a royal Princess, and I was all eyes.
  In a word she was an exquisite little person, a blonde with dark eyes. It was
  not at all one's idea of a German princess, but I recollected that she was of
  Vienna, the most elegant of European capitals. She was little more than a
  girl, but so perfect was her finish, her air of distinction, she might have
  been almost any age. A Dresden china princess, but with nothing insipid about
  her. She was seated in an arm-chair with her handkerchief pressed to her
  eyes, but the instant she perceived that we were strangers she sprang up,
  electrified with indignation.</p>

  <p>"What is the meaning of this intrusion?" she cried with a stamp of her
  foot. "Leave the room!...Madame von Hofstetter, who are these persons?"</p>

  <p>But the lady-in-waiting had dissolved in tears, and was unable to
  explain.</p>

  <p>I will pass quickly over the scene that followed. It was a lively one! The
  little Princess endeavoured to crush us with her royal anger, but she met her
  match in Mme. Storey, who smiled down at her in an amused and tolerant
  fashion, and patiently explained that she must prepare to leave the ship.</p>

  <p>"This is outrageous!" cried the Princess. "I am the Princess Cristina von
  Habsburg! Do you not know what that means? I am not subject to your laws! I
  will communicate with our ambassador!"</p>

  <p>"I believe that Austria is now a republic," said my employer mildly.</p>

  <p>She never got it. "The City of New York shall suffer for this insult!" she
  cried. "Why should the police seek to detain me?"</p>

  <p>"Commodore Varick died yesterday afternoon," said Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"Did he?" she said coolly.</p>

  <p>"Didn't you know it?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey's face turned grimly humorous. "The newspapers..." she
  began.</p>

  <p>The Princess tossed her head. "I don't read your horrible newspapers."</p>

  <p>Alas! for royal truthfulness. There was a newspaper lying on the sofa at
  that very moment, with the name Varick uppermost in the headlines. Mme.
  Storey pointed to it mutely.</p>

  <p>The Princess was not in the least abashed. "I haven't looked at it," she
  said. "And anyway, what of it? I was merely their guest. I am sorry for them,
  but it has got nothing to do with me."</p>

  <p>"Commodore Varick was poisoned," said Mme. Storey in a low tone, "and you
  were the last person to see him before he was taken ill."</p>

  <p>The Princess stared at her in what appeared to be the purest amazement.
  One could not be sure, of course. "That was not in the newspaper," she said
  naïvely.</p>

  <p>"No," said my employer dryly.</p>

  <p>The little lady was breathing hard with emotion. She seemed to be scarcely
  capable of speaking. "And do you mean," she gasped, "do you dare to charge
  that <i>I</i> poisoned him? In heaven's name why should <i>I</i> poison an
  American millionaire."</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said Mme. Storey. She patiently explained the measures she
  had taken to protect the Princess from newspaper publicity.</p>

  <p>"I will not leave the ship!" said the Princess with another stamp of the
  royal foot.</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey shrugged. There was no use waiting for more. The rest was up
  to Sir Everard. He shook his head lugubriously as we passed him on the way
  out.</p>

  <h3>VII</h3>

  <p class="first">The scene now shifts to Mme. Storey's maisonnette in East
  Sixty &mdash;&mdash; Street. The address of this recherché establishment is
  not in the telephone book, and I shall not give it here. My employer had made
  an arrangement with Inspector Rumsey to bring the Princess there, and while
  we waited for them we had a much needed bite of lunch. Mme. Storey ate with
  an abstracted air, and was disinclined to talk of the case.</p>

  <p>In about an hour Inspector Rumsey brought the Princess and Madame
  Hofstetter along in a taxi-cab, while the two maids followed with two
  plain-clothes men in another. Maids and plain-clothes men were put into the
  dining-room to wait, while the rest of us gathered in the 1850 parlour
  overhead. There was a great change in the little Princess. The royal air was
  subdued, and she was much like any other frightened girl. But there was a
  hardness about her that was not girlish. In fact, she was an exotic specimen,
  quite outside my experience, and I could not make her out. I will say for her
  that the daughter of a hundred Habsburgs was not craven. She kept her head
  up.</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey's manner towards her was kindly. "Sit down," she said, "and
  let us talk this matter over quietly. You are not charged with anything."</p>

  <p>"<i>Merci, Madame</i>," said the Princess ironically. "May I have a
  cigarette?"</p>

  <p>"Surely!" said my employer, offering the box. "If you'd rather talk to us
  women alone, Inspector Rumsey will wait downstairs."</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter," she said indifferently. She puffed gratefully at the
  cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Please tell us exactly what took place between you and Commodore Varick
  yesterday afternoon," said Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"I cannot do that," said the girl impatiently. "It was a private matter,
  and has nothing to do with the public or the police."</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey drew a long breath for patience. "Pardon me," she said, "but
  in view of what happened immediately afterwards, it is of the greatest
  concern to the police, and you must tell."</p>

  <p>An agonised look came into the girl's face. "<i>Mon Dieu</i>! it would
  kill me if these things were printed in the newspapers!" she murmured. "You
  cannot understand my feelings! You are republicans!"</p>

  <p>We Americans smiled a little at this, though goodness knows, it was
  piteous, too. Mme. Storey said gravely:</p>

  <p>"I promise you it shall not appear in the newspapers unless it has some
  connection with the death of Commodore Varick."</p>

  <p>The Princess would not sit down. Standing by the mantelpiece, she began
  abruptly to tell her story. She did not appear to be of any particular
  nationality, but was merely of the great world. Only her continuous, slight,
  graceful gesticulation betrayed her foreignness.</p>

  <p>"I met the Varicks last winter at Cannes. They have a big place near
  there. Pushing people, but not ill-bred for Americans. They courted me, and
  I, well, my family is ruined, and I cannot afford to be too particular; I
  allowed myself to be courted. Presently the son was brought forward; a
  personable young man, but somewhat crude in manner. I took that to be
  American. He bestowed his attentions upon me. We were seen everywhere
  together. A few years ago he would never have presumed, but, as I say, my
  house is fallen, my father is dead, and I must do the best I can for myself.
  My mother, the Archduchess, was invited to stay with the Varicks. Mrs. Varick
  sounded her out in respect to the match, and my mother expressed herself as
  being agreeable to it. No definite proposal was made, but I was given to
  understand in many ways that all had been arranged. The behaviour of Mr.
  Henry Varick...possibly I do not understand American customs..."</p>

  <p>A spasm of pain passed across the girl's face. She paused before
  continuing. "When the Varicks departed for New York, I was invited to
  accompany them, but my mother thought that it would be unseemly for me to do
  so. It was arranged that I should follow them later, and visit them in New
  York. My mother having a dread of the ocean, my friend Madame von Hofstetter
  accompanied me. We arrived a week ago. It was immediately apparent that some
  hitch had arisen. The manner of both Mr. and Mrs. Varick towards me was
  strained. Day after day I waited, and the young man did not appear. Finally I
  learned that he had been in the house and had departed again without seeing
  me.</p>

  <p>"Yesterday afternoon," she continued, "Commodore Varick sent his
  secretary, and I was conducted with much secrecy to his study. He was in a
  state of painful embarrassment. From his stammering and beating about the
  bush I gathered that there was an impediment to the match. Me, I am
  accustomed to speaking plainly. When I taxed him with it, he said yes, to his
  great regret, everything was definitely off..." The girl's cheeks flushed red
  at the recollection. "<i>Mon Dieu</i>! to <i>me</i>, a Habsburg! After I had
  condescended to these <i>canaille</i>! After I had allowed myself to be
  brought across the ocean! <i>Dieu</i>! I thought I should die with rage. What
  could I do? I ran out of the house that moment, and sent back for my servants
  to follow me."</p>

  <p>A silence followed the completion of her story. The little Princess stood
  there breathing fast. We all felt, I think, that she had been pretty badly
  used. Finally Mme. Storey said, in a casual manner:</p>

  <p>"Before you left the room, had you and Commodore Varick drunk tea?"</p>

  <p>The girl struck her forehead. "Let me think! Yes, I remember that tea was
  made. I made it with little silver balls."</p>

  <p>She said this in a seemingly open manner, but she was far from being a
  simple maiden, and how could one tell?</p>

  <p>"Was it drunk?"</p>

  <p>"I did not drink any," she said quickly.</p>

  <p>"And the Commodore?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know...Yes! I have a recollection of seeing him swallow it, of
  the emptied cup."</p>

  <p>"Was this before or after he made his announcement to you?" asked Mme.
  Storey softly.</p>

  <p>"I can't remember," she said listlessly. Then she started. "Before!
  Before! Before!" she cried excitedly.</p>

  <p>"H'm!" said Mme. Storey. She took a turn up and down. "Did Commodore
  Varick give any reason for breaking off the match?" she asked, off-hand.</p>

  <p>The Princess's back was stiff and her chin up as she answered. "Yes, he
  said the young man was disinclined to it." She got it out all right, then
  came a disastrous breakdown. She extended her arm along the mantel, and
  dropping her head upon it, broke into an uncontrollable sobbing. "I wish I
  was dead!" she gasped. It was piteous.</p>

  <p>Madame von Hofstetter flew to her and took her in her arms. The elder
  woman turned an imploring face over her shoulder towards Mme. Storey. "Where
  can I take her?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Into my bedroom across the hall," said the latter, opening the door.</p>

  <p>They disappeared. When my employer returned, Inspector Rumsey said
  anxiously: "What do you make of it?"</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey's face looked pale and drawn. "The proud little Princess has a
  heart just the same as any common girl," she said. "She has had the
  misfortune to give it to Hank Varick, who has more hearts than he can
  use."</p>

  <p>"A nasty case!" said the Inspector. "It will be difficult to bring it home
  to her. No witnesses."</p>

  <p>"I'm not satisfied that she did it," said Mme. Storey, pacing the
  room.</p>

  <p>"But her rage!" he said. "And she comes of bad stock. Those royalties have
  been accustomed for centuries to remove their enemies in just such a
  manner."</p>

  <p>"Quite!" said Mme. Storey, smiling a little at his honest Americanism.
  "But I never before heard of a girl who killed the father because the son had
  jilted her. The motive does not seem adequate. Moreover, it is hardly
  credible that a royal Princess should be carrying around a dose of aconite
  ready to administer to anybody who might displease her. Aconite is not a
  habit-forming drug. Nobody takes aconite for the kick in it."</p>

  <p>"Then who did it?" he asked blankly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm not saying she <i>didn't</i> do it," said my employer. "Frankly,
  I don't know. What I do see is, that we have scarcely scratched the surface
  of this case as yet. There is a deal of hard spade work before us. Is it your
  wish that I should continue to represent you?"</p>

  <p>"Sure!" he cried, "you must not desert me now."</p>

  <p>"Very well," she said, "I will return to the Varick house and stay there
  until I see light. I will communicate with you by telephone when necessary,
  according to the method we have used before. You and your men must trace that
  anonymous letter to its source if it is humanly possible to do so. The
  Princess and her entourage will stay here in my place, under guard. Bella
  goes with me."</p>

  <p>While Mme. Storey was still issuing instructions, her maid Grace entered,
  bearing a letter on a salver. She said: "This has just come, Madame. It is
  marked urgent, so I brought it right up."</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey put out an inattentive hand for the envelope. But when her
  eyes fell upon it she started. "Look at this!" she cried, holding it up. The
  address was printed in the same sort of carefully-formed characters that had
  appeared on the anonymous letter addressed to the Inspector. She tore it
  open. It contained a slip similar to that other slip, with a single line of
  printed characters:</p><br>

  <p class="telegram">LOOK INTO HANK VARICK'S MOVEMENTS YESTERDAY.</p><br>

  <h3>VIII</h3>

  <p class="first">In my employer's quaint and charming parlour, Mme. Storey
  and Inspector Rumsey laid out a joint plan of campaign. It was of prime
  importance to trace the two anonymous letters to their source. The Inspector
  had already set the police machinery in motion to trace them through the
  mails, while Mme. Storey was to work to the same end inside the Varick house.
  It was fairly obvious now that they had originated in the house, since no one
  knew that Mme. Storey was at work upon the case except certain persons in the
  Varick household. Inspector Rumsey further agreed to have the recent
  movements of young Henry Varick investigated as far as possible, and a report
  prepared for Mme. Storey covering the young man's whole career, so far as the
  details might be learned from old newspapers, and from inquiries amongst his
  associates. By this time the Inspector's doctors had definitely reported to
  him that Commodore Varick had come to his death as the result of a powerful
  dose of the alkaloid of aconite. Tannin was also found, and the inference was
  that he had taken the drug in strong tea. But this was not positively
  established. The police were already at work endeavouring to trace any sales
  of the drug aconitina that might have been made lately. Sales of this
  powerful drug were rare.</p>

  <p>In order to provide us with additional assistance inside the house, Mme.
  Storey arranged to have Crider, our cleverest and most dependable operator,
  apply to Jarboe, the Varick butler, for a job as footman. She arranged with
  Jarboe later to take him on. The Princess Cristina von Habsburg, her
  lady-in-waiting and their maids, were to be accommodated in Mme. Storey's
  maisonnette for the present. Mme. Storey's servants were to feed them and
  make them as comfortable as possible, and a plain-clothes man would be on
  guard in the entrance corridor at all hours of the day and night. The
  Princess was given the privilege of consulting counsel, but she made no move
  to do so. I need hardly say that she very willingly joined with us in our
  little conspiracy to keep this case out of the newspapers for the moment. We
  expected it to break sooner or later.</p>

  <p>All these arrangements having been effected, Mme. Storey telephoned to the
  Varick house for the same car that had carried us away from there three hours
  earlier. It was a closed car, having shades that pulled down inside the
  windows, and by this means we returned to the house, through the courtyard,
  without having been recognised by any of the loungers or watchers in the
  street. We made our headquarters in Commodore Varick's office on the second
  floor. It was now nearly six, and Miss Priestley, the "literary secretary,"
  had gone home. We had learned that Mr. Henry Varick was still with his
  mother, but Mme. Storey made no effort to see him as yet. She wished to avoid
  giving him any reason to suspect that he was being investigated. We
  interviewed several members of the household whom I need not mention, since
  they contributed nothing of moment to the case. My job was to take notes of
  all interviews.</p>

  <p>It was not until Mme. Storey had her second talk with Gabbitt, the
  Commodore's valet, that we began to strike pay ore. The quaint little
  fuzzy-headed man made an excellent witness, but how far he was telling the
  truth, I could never have undertaken to say. He was a philosopher in his way.
  There was a curious reasonableness about him&mdash;I mean, that while he was
  devoted to his master, he nevertheless felt free to criticise him. At this
  time we were making a more intensive examination of the Commodore's
  suite.</p>

  <p>"Gabbitt," said my mistress, "what were the relations between Mr. Henry
  and his father?"</p>

  <p>"Bad, ma'am," said Gabbitt. "All the world knows that."</p>

  <p>"But how do you mean bad?"</p>

  <p>"Well, ma'am, it was the usual thing between a rich father and his son.
  Particularly when it's an only child. When he was little, Mr. Henry was
  spoiled, and when he grew up his father blamed him because he turned out
  wilful."</p>

  <p>"When did the trouble between them start?"</p>

  <p>"Four, five years ago when Mr. Henry was in college. He was very wild. It
  was one scrape after another."</p>

  <p>"With women?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, ma'am, gen'ally speakin'. Mr. Henry complained to me once that it
  wasn't his fault, that they fair flung themselves at his head. Quite apart
  from being William Henry Varick, and all that, Mr. Henry is a very attractive
  young man, so gay and full of life."</p>

  <p>"So we have perceived," said Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"He wasn't to blame for all the trouble, though it is only fair to state
  that he wasn't no Sir Galahad neither."</p>

  <p>"It is scarcely to be expected," said my employer dryly.</p>

  <p>"His name made him a fair mark for scoundrels, and there was always
  somebody, either man or woman, trying to blackmail him. It cost the Commodore
  a pretty penny to settle with such people. The Commodore was very sensitive
  about any scandal attaching to the family name. Mrs. Varick would take her
  son's part, naturally, and there were bitter family scenes. My memory is hazy
  about the details of these scrapes..."</p>

  <p>"Never mind that," said Mme. Storey. "Proceed."</p>

  <p>"The Commodore was always reproaching his son for doing nothing but spend
  money," Gabbitt continued, "and some time after he had left college&mdash;he
  did not graduate&mdash;Mr. Henry undertook to go into business on his own
  account. In college the only thing he had been any good at was
  chemistry..."</p>

  <p>"Oh, chemistry," said Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"Yes, 'm, and so his thoughts naturally turned towards the chemical
  business. His idea was to form a combination of all the drug manufacturers in
  the country, and to found a great research laboratory that would advance the
  whole business. It looked like a good scheme, and his father backed him
  heavily, stipulating only that the family name be kept out of it. The
  Commodore didn't want to be connected with trade in any way."</p>

  <p>"Quite!" said my employer.</p>

  <p>"It started off all right, but something happened. I don't understand the
  details. Mr. Henry always claimed that he had been rooked. Very likely he
  lacked the skill and experience to conduct so vast an enterprise. At any
  rate, there was a tremendous crash, and whereas it had cost the Commodore a
  few thousands to get his son out of his college scrapes, his liabilities in
  the chemical affair ran into the millions. The family finances were seriously
  affected. It led to a bitter quarrel between father and son, and since that
  time, Mr. Henry has not been seen much about the house. It is said that he
  visited his mother secretly. Last summer Mrs. Varick patched up a truce
  between father and son, and in the fall Mr. Henry accompanied us to
  Europe."</p>

  <p>"Gabbitt," said Mme. Storey, "from your observation, would you say that
  the affair between Mr. Henry and the Princess Cristina was a serious
  one?"</p>

  <p>"She thought it was," said the little man promptly, "and Mr. Henry was
  undeniably smitten. But we who had watched him grow up were not taken in by
  it. He was easily smitten. As soon as we sailed home she passed out of his
  mind. Why, there was a girl on board ship..."</p>

  <p>"Never mind her," said my employer good-naturedly, "but tell me what was
  the last occasion that Mr. Henry saw his father."</p>

  <p>"Day before yesterday, 'm. This is Wednesday, yes, it was Monday
  afternoon."</p>

  <p>"What were the circumstances of his visit?"</p>

  <p>"The Commodore had been telegraphing and telephoning all over the country
  to find him, the Princess Cristina being here. The general feeling amongst us
  servants was that Mr. Henry was purposely keeping out of the way. Be that as
  it may, when he was sent for he had to come. He came on Monday afternoon, and
  there was a terrible quarrel between him and his father in the study. I
  supposed that it was over the Princess, being as the Commodore's heart was
  set on that match. I was in and out of the dressing-room and the pantry, and
  just at the end, Mr. Henry opened the door into the foyer, and I heard his
  father call after him: 'I never want to see you again!' And Mr. Henry's
  answer, hard and bitter: 'You shan't!' Then the slam of the door, and Mr.
  Henry was gone!" Gabbitt made a dramatic pause.</p>

  <p>"Go on," said Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"It had happened before," he resumed, "and I didn't take it so serious.
  Not until yesterday morning, that is, when the Commodore's lawyer turned up
  and a new will was made."</p>

  <p>"Oh, a new will."</p>

  <p>"Yes, ma'am. That had happened before, too. But on former occasions the
  lawyer had been called in and instructions given him, and after a few days he
  would come back with the will to be signed. This time the will was made on
  the spot, so I knew the Commodore was bitter angry. The lawyer wrote it out
  himself on Miss Priestley's typewriter, and afterwards Miss Priestley and me
  was called into the study to witness it. It was a short will; scarcely filled
  one sheet of paper. The top part of the sheet was turned under when we
  signed, and I don't know what was in it."</p>

  <p>We were in the pantry at this moment, and while Mme. Storey listened her
  eyes were passing along the rows of cups and glasses on the little buffet.
  "One moment," she said. "Have you got a magnifying glass of any sort? A
  reading glass will do."</p>

  <p>It was fetched her from the study. She examined the shelves. "Gabbitt, how
  many of these cups did you set out on the tea-table yesterday?" she
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Two, ma'am. No guests were expected."</p>

  <p>"Any of these glasses?" pointing to a row of tall, iridescent
  tumblers.</p>

  <p>"No, ma'am. Those are for whisky and soda. The Commodore don't indulge at
  tea-time."</p>

  <p>My employer passed on into the study without offering any comment. "Well,
  go on," she said, and then, very unexpectedly: "Mr. Henry came back yesterday
  afternoon?"</p>

  <p>"Why no, ma'am," said Gabbitt in great surprise. "Not after such a
  quarrel!" It seemed to me that he was a little <i>too</i> open-eyed, too
  innocent then.</p>

  <p>"No?" said Mme. Storey carelessly. "Well, that's all now. Thank you very
  much, Gabbitt."</p>

  <p>He lingered in the doorway, eyeing her anxiously. He was longing to ask
  <i>her</i> a question, but did not dare. Mme. Storey affected to ignore him.
  He went out.</p>

  <h3>IX</h3>

  <p class="first">Mme. Storey questioned several of the servants with a view
  to learning if young Henry Varick had been in the house on the day before.
  All blandly denied it, nor could she entrap them into any admission.</p>

  <p>"Lying," she said coolly, when the last had gone. "Notice that they did
  not say, 'I did not see him,' but all said, 'He was not here.'"</p>

  <p>"Why not ask Mrs. Varick's pretty secretary, Miss Gilsey?" I suggested.
  "She could tell you."</p>

  <p>"Quite," said Mme. Storey, "and would immediately tell Henry that I had
  asked. I don't want to put him on his guard. I want to meet him as if by
  accident, and fall into casual talk. If I am able to bring that about, don't
  you dare to let a notebook appear. Remember all that passes as well as you
  can, and put it down afterwards."</p>

  <p>With Jarboe, my employer pursued a slightly different method. She told the
  butler it was necessary for her to have a complete lay-out of the house in
  her mind, especially the second floor, and the three of us strolled around,
  while he pointed out the different rooms. Mme. Storey said: "The Commodore's
  suite, and Mrs. Varick's, which adjoins it, occupy the whole of the Avenue
  frontage on this floor. I've got that straight. What else is there?"</p>

  <p>"On the south side is the guest suite lately occupied by the Princess
  Cristina," said Jarboe, indicating. "And there's an extra bedroom at the back
  that was given to her lady-in-waiting. Would you like to see the rooms?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no," said Mme. Storey. "I don't suppose they left anything
  behind."</p>

  <p>"Next to the back bedroom comes the grand stairway," Jarboe continued,
  "and this passage on the left of the stairway leads to the elevator, and on
  back to the main service corridor and service stairs."</p>

  <p>We looked into the service corridor.</p>

  <p>"Next to the passage comes another guest-room," Jarboe said, proceeding;
  "not occupied at present; and on the north side of the house is Mr. Henry's
  suite, which consists of study and bedroom. The rooms have been his since his
  schooldays, and are still kept for him with all his things, though he has had
  a private apartment outside for the past two years."</p>

  <p>It was strange to hear how the perfect butler's carefully modulated voice
  coloured with emotion when he mentioned the darling of the house.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Henry is in the house at present," he went on, "and would, I am sure,
  be glad to have you see the rooms if I mentioned it to him."</p>

  <p>"Never mind, thanks," she said.</p>

  <p>"On the third floor," said Jarboe, like the guide on a sightseers' 'bus,
  "there are twenty-five rooms, including several suites for guests, the
  housekeeper's suite, rooms for the maids, and so on. The footmen sleep in the
  building across the court, which was once the stables. Would you wish to go
  upstairs, Madame?"</p>

  <p>"No, thanks," said my employer dryly. "Jarboe," she said, in a voice that
  arrested his spiel, "there's a door there in the back corner, adjoining Mr.
  Henry's suite, that you have passed over every time we have been around?
  Where does that go?"</p>

  <p>"Another stairway," he said, with an air of great carelessness.</p>

  <p>"And where do the stairs go?"</p>

  <p>"Just to a passage below."</p>

  <p>"And where does that passage go?"</p>

  <p>"Nowhere in particular, Madame, just around the court."</p>

  <p>"Who uses that stair?"</p>

  <p>"Nobody uses it now, Madame. What it may have been designated for
  originally, I cannot say."</p>

  <p>"Well, let us explore it," said Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>The butler followed very unwillingly. The straight, narrow stairway led us
  into a bare passage with windows looking out on the court. At the right, this
  passage ended with a door opening on the main service hall and stairway; at
  the left, it turned a corner and continued around the north side of the
  court. On this side there was a small door opening from the passage. My
  employer, trying it, found it locked. The dignified butler had a very unhappy
  air. He said: "That door leads into the ballroom, Madame. It is used only
  when there is an entertainment, to facilitate the service. Shall I send for
  the key?"</p>

  <p>"No matter," said Mme. Storey, continuing.</p>

  <p>The passage ended on this side at a heavy door locked by a spring lock on
  our side. That is to say we could open the door, but could not come back that
  way without putting it on the latch. The wall we passed through here was over
  a foot thick; evidently a party wall. On the other side of the door the
  passage turned sharp to the left again. This part ran on endlessly, and was
  perfectly dark except for a glimmer of light through a glass door over a
  hundred feet away. There were no doors in it. It was a weird feature to find
  in a modern house. The door at the end, we found, gave on the street, but it
  was ingeniously masked by a stoop built over it. There was a heavy iron
  grille outside, such as they use to protect basement doors. The street we
  looked on was one strange to us. However, it was not difficult to deduce that
  it was the next cross street to the north of that on which the public
  entrances of the Varick house opened. My employer looked at the disconcerted
  Jarboe with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Jarboe," she said, "you are the chief servant of this household. How
  ridiculous to pretend that you did not know of the existence of this passage.
  Why, who sweeps it?"</p>

  <p>He spread out his hands in gesture of surrender. "Madame, you must pardon
  me. A good servant never betrays the private affairs of his master. The habit
  of years was too strong to be broken."</p>

  <p>I thought it rather a neat apology.</p>

  <p>"You're forgiven," said Mme. Storey, cheerfully. "Now tell me the history
  of this passage."</p>

  <p>"It was constructed during the last rebuilding of the house," said Jarboe.
  "The Commodore owns the houses at the back of his property, and had this
  passage made under one of them so that he could enter and leave his house
  privately. So many people hang about the front door, newspaper reporters,
  photographers..."</p>

  <p>"Process servers," put in Mme. Storey slyly.</p>

  <p>"My master was a man of blameless life," said Jarboe with dignity.</p>

  <p>"Oh, quite! I don't blame him. What's the use of being a millionaire, if
  you can't have a little privacy?"</p>

  <p>Jarboe looked relieved. We strolled back.</p>

  <p>"Jarboe," said Mme. Storey, "think before you answer my next question. The
  truth is bound to come out and you can best help the family by assisting me
  to get at it as quickly as possible...Did young Mr. Henry also use this
  passage?"</p>

  <p>Jarboe stumbled in his speech, gulped hard, and finally blurted out. "Yes,
  Madame. Mr. Henry was also provided with the two keys necessary to come in
  this way."</p>

  <p>"Did his father know about it?"</p>

  <p>"I fancy not, Madame. I fancy Mrs. Varick must have procured the keys for
  Mr. Henry."</p>

  <p>"Ah! Now, Jarboe, the truth! Did not Mr. Henry come in this way yesterday
  for the purpose of seeing his father?"</p>

  <p>"No, Madame, no!" he replied agitatedly.</p>

  <p>"But couldn't he have come this way, and gone out again without ever your
  seeing him?"</p>

  <p>"If he had been in the house I should certainly have heard of it, Madame.
  There are servants everywhere, and everything is talked about among
  them."</p>

  <p>"That is not quite an answer to my question. Is it not possible that Mr.
  Henry came this way yesterday and went out again without your seeing
  him?"</p>

  <p>"Of course, it is <i>possible</i>, Madame," said Jarboe, with an unhappy
  air.</p>

  <h3>X</h3>

  <p class="first">By-and-by Jarboe came to the office to say: "Mr. Henry
  Varick's compliments to Madame Storey. He is dining downstairs at half-past
  seven, and wishes to know if Madame Storey will do him the honour of joining
  him."</p>

  <p>It amused my employer to treat the magnificent Jarboe in an off-hand and
  facetious manner. "But, Jarboe, I have nothing to wear!" she said.</p>

  <p>He never smiled. "Under the circumstances, Madame, I am sure Mr. Henry
  will understand."</p>

  <p>"Very well. Tell him that Madame Storey and Miss Brickley will be happy to
  join him."</p>

  <p>Jarboe looked a little dubious at the inclusion of my name. However, he
  marched off.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Henry has decided to take the bull by the horns," remarked Mme.
  Storey to me.</p>

  <p>When the hour arrived, my mistress and I went slowly down the sweeping
  stairway arm in arm. How I wish I could convey in a phrase the stateliness of
  that great house. I think proportion had a lot to do with it. The height and
  width of those noble halls upstairs and down were in exactly the right
  relation to their length. There were several footmen in the lower hall in
  plain evening dress. The astute face of our man Crider was amongst them.
  Certainly no time had been lost in installing and outfitting him. One of the
  footmen (not Crider) approached us, saying: "Mr. Henry is in the gold room,"
  and led the way across the hall into the middle one of the three great
  drawing-rooms that filled the Fifth Avenue side of the house. Our young host
  came forward to greet us.</p>

  <p>"I have already seen you today," he said to Mme. Storey, "but I did not
  know you. My mother has told me about you now, and what you are doing for us.
  It is wonderful of you!"</p>

  <p>My employer brought me forward: "My secretary, Miss Brickley."</p>

  <p>I turned hot and cold when he looked at me. He had the bluest eyes I have
  ever beheld, blue as the tropical sea. It was perfectly ridiculous, but the
  same feeling of helplessness came over me every time he looked at me. After a
  courteous greeting, he paid no further attention to me. Giving an arm to Mme.
  Storey, he led her through the state suite.</p>

  <p>"It was very good of you to have us downstairs," she said.</p>

  <p>"Oh," he said, with a painful gesture, "nothing is to be gained by crying
  and carrying on about our loss. I'm done with crying now. Things have got to
  go on. I ordered dinner downstairs hoping that I could persuade you to join
  me. We must become acquainted; we must work together."</p>

  <p>"Surely," said Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>I resented her coolness. I was enraged by the thought that she was, as I
  thought, trying to bring the murder home to him. God forgive me! I was
  jealous of my mistress. Issuing out of the farther drawing-room, we crossed
  the great central hall again. The dining-room was opposite. It was another
  long and lofty room with a row of windows at the end that must have looked
  out on the court. It was dark except for a cluster of shaded candles on the
  small table, and another cluster on the sideboard. The density of the shadows
  made the lofty ceiling recede even farther. I felt like an insect under it.
  Yet, as I presently learned, this was only the family dining-room. There was
  a state dining-room somewhere else.</p>

  <p>Mr. Varick put Mme. Storey at his right and me at his left. "I ordered a
  small table," he said, "because the family mahogany is depressing for so
  intimate a party. Would you like more light?"</p>

  <p>"This is perfect," said Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>The meal commenced; <i>hors d'oeuvres</i>, soup, fish, and so on. In the
  beginning the conversation was merely polite; it seemed to be tacitly agreed
  that all painful subjects must be deferred until we had at least got our food
  down. Nobody cared about eating, and many things were sent away untasted. It
  threatened to go on for ever, until Mme. Storey said in her brusque and
  humorous way: "Look here, <i>must</i> we eat any more?"</p>

  <p>"No, no!" he said, rousing himself. He spoke to the footman behind his
  chair. "Never mind the game, or dessert. Just fruit, coffee, cognac, and
  cigarettes."</p>

  <p>When this was put on the table the servants left the room for good. Mr.
  Varick leaned towards my mistress. "Well...what's the real situation?" he
  asked in a strained voice.</p>

  <p>She spread out her hands. "I have collected a lot of information, but I
  seem to be no nearer a solution. All I have done is to detain the Princess
  Cristina."</p>

  <p>"She could hardly have done it!" he said with a half smile. In spite of
  grief and fatigue that incorrigible smile was always near the surface. "She
  had nothing against the old man. If it had been me, now."</p>

  <p>"My idea, too," said Mme. Storey. "But I had to prevent her sailing."</p>

  <p>Quite simply, and with a glint of mirth in his weary eyes, he told us of
  his affair with the Princess. To his father his casual frankness must have
  seemed scandalous, but it is only the way of the younger generation. "It was
  never put up to me in so many words, but of course I knew they wanted me to
  marry her. And I was willing; she was easy to look at. Besides, I wanted to
  please the old boy; I've been a thorn in his side ever since I grew up. I had
  made such a mess of my own affairs always, I thought they might as well have
  a try at settling them.</p>

  <p>"And so it started. But I soon forgot it was a made-up affair. I had never
  known anybody like Cristina. In fact, I got perfectly crazy about her, though
  I suppose it didn't go very deep. But I never let on to her she had me going;
  I didn't dare. For she was a terrible girl, you know, imperious. Wanted to
  get her little foot firmly planted on your neck, and keep you down. Well, not
  for Joseph! So I just joshed her. What a delicious little spitfire! We spent
  the time quarrelling like devils&mdash;and making up. It was a heap of fun.
  Be cause, you see, in public she was always very much the Princess, and as
  soon as we got alone together, whew! the lid blew off!</p>

  <p>"It wasn't Cristina that I baulked at; I could have tamed the little
  termagant, and enjoyed doing it. It was her life, her gang, it was everything
  she stood for that stuck in my crop. I don't know if I can explain what I
  mean. That crowd of decayed aristocrats and cast-off royalties that fluffs
  around Europe from one expensive resort to another sponging on millionaires.
  In a going concern like England, the King is a real person, but the others
  are just play-actors. The whole business of Highnessing them, and going down
  on your marrow bones, and slipping them loans on the sly, is a comic sham.
  Yet my Dad couldn't see it. If he could buy lunch for a hereditary Prince he
  was happy...Do you know Europe, Madame Storey?"</p>

  <p>"I know it," she said dryly.</p>

  <p>"Then I need say no more. By God! that atmosphere would have suffocated
  me! I'm an American. I must have air. I must be free to say my say, and walk
  out on the show if I don't like it."</p>

  <p>"Oh, quite!"</p>

  <p>"So I saw almost from the first that marriage was out of the question, and
  after that I was just out for the fun there was in it. I swear I never
  thought Cristina was taking it seriously. A hundred times a day she called me
  a boor, a peasant, a barbarian&mdash;with trimmings. She said she'd sooner
  marry her footman than me. However, since she came to America, I suppose she
  <i>did</i> take it seriously. Those girls over there don't savvy like ours
  do. Maybe it's because they don't want to. At any rate, they're not such good
  sports. Oh, well, anything I ever started was bound to turn out badly."</p>

  <p>He swallowed a pony of brandy, and continued: "Where I made my mistake was
  in not having it out with the old man in plain words. But it was impossible
  to have a thing out with him, unless you both got in a rip-roaring passion.
  When I tried to talk to him about it, he turned it aside. So I just drifted.
  When we left Europe I thought the scheme had been dropped. Wrong again! I was
  soon made to understand by little things that the match was <i>settled</i>.
  In short, that I had to marry the girl. That turned me stubborn and I..." He
  suddenly broke off and took another drink.</p>

  <p>"You what?" prompted Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I made up my mind I'd be damned if I would!"</p>

  <p>This was obviously not what he had started to say. However, my employer
  let it pass. "Her coming brought things to a head," she suggested.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said ruefully. "I lit out. But the old man ran me to earth, and
  I had to come back. Got here Monday, day before yesterday. We had it out then
  with a vengeance. I tried to reason with him, but he wouldn't listen.
  Insisted that I had compromised myself. That made me laugh. 'Good God!' I
  said, 'if a fellow had to marry every girl he had petted, Brigham Young would
  be nowhere!' He said, in his stiff way: 'It is somewhat different when a
  Princess is involved!' 'Princess, my eye!' I said; 'her family was kicked out
  of that job nearly twenty years ago!' We were soon shouting at each other in
  the old way. He said I had allowed him to commit himself so far that he
  couldn't draw back, and I said that I didn't give a damn for his commitments,
  that I was the one who had to marry the girl. He mounted his highest horse.
  He said that I <i>had</i> to marry the girl, and there was no argument about
  it, so then I played..." He suddenly bit his lip, and seized his glass
  again.</p>

  <p>"Played your trump card?" suggested Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"No," he said with an embarrassed smile, "I didn't have any trumps. Played
  my last card, I was going to say. I said I wouldn't marry her, and stood
  pat."</p>

  <p>There was clearly an important omission here, but as Mme. Storey was not
  supposed to be examining him, she couldn't very well take notice of it. He
  went on to describe the final scenes of his quarrel with his father. In doing
  so he completely forgot himself; his cheeks became flushed, and his eyes
  sparkled with remembered anger as he acted the scene out. "He said he'd cut
  me off without a cent! And I said go to it!"</p>

  <p>In the middle of this the blue eyes suddenly went blank, and he caught
  himself up gasping. "Oh, God! what am I saying! And he lying upstairs cold!"
  He sprang up from his chair, and walked away into the shadows. He leaned his
  arms against the wall, and dropped his head upon them. It was terribly
  affecting.</p>

  <p>"However, that has got nothing to do with the tragedy of yesterday," said
  Mme. Storey soothingly.</p>

  <p>"No," he said heavily. He returned and dropped into his chair. All the
  light had gone out of his face. He stared before him, fingering a wine-glass
  without noticing what he was doing. "That is a complete mystery," he
  murmured. "Surely the doctors must be mistaken. Who would want to kill my
  Dad?"</p>

  <p>"Did he cut you off?" asked Mme. Storey&mdash;though she knew very
  well.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said indifferently. "Made a new will yesterday morning."</p>

  <p>"When did you learn that?"</p>

  <p>"Just a little while ago, from my mother. The lawyer has talked to
  her."</p>

  <p>"How did your father receive you yesterday afternoon?" asked Mme. Storey
  in a conversational tone.</p>

  <p>I could have shrieked a warning to him, but anyhow it would have come too
  late. He fell directly into her trap. "Well, he had quieted down some," he
  said gloomily. "But he wouldn't let me talk."</p>

  <p>A second later he realised that he had betrayed himself. He lifted a
  ghastly face towards my employer.</p>

  <p>"How...how did you know I was here yesterday?" he stammered.</p>

  <p>"I didn't know," she answered. "You have just told me."</p>

  <p>A horrible silence fell upon us three. I was enraged with my mistress. It
  didn't seem like the square thing to do, to accept his invitation to dine
  merely for the purpose of entrapping him. On the other hand I felt a kind of
  fierce joy in the young man's desperate situation. It seemed to bring me a
  little closer to him. If the whole world abandons him I will still be his
  friend! I told myself.</p>

  <h3>XI</h3>

  <p class="first">After a while Henry Varick raised his head, and said with a
  kind of weary defiance: "Well, suppose I did see my father yesterday
  afternoon? What of it?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," said Mme. Storey mildly. "I am only wondering why you tried to
  conceal the fact?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I was tempted because it seemed easy to conceal it. I came through
  a secret entrance, and I met nobody. Nobody knew I was in the house
  except...my mother."</p>

  <p>"And Miss Gilsey," put in Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>He stared at her again. "You are a terrible woman!" he murmured. "...Yes,
  Miss Gilsey saw me come, because she is always with my mother. But she would
  not have betrayed me."</p>

  <p>"Nor your mother's maids?"</p>

  <p>"Nor my mother's maids either. I didn't notice whether they saw me or
  not...As for my reason for concealing my visit, surely that must be clear to
  you. It appears that my father was taken sick a few minutes after I had left
  him. Anybody could foresee what a nasty story that would start. The
  scapegrace son, and all that. My whole past life raked up. My object was
  simply to keep a dirty mess out of the papers. I had no fear of the outcome.
  Why, no sensible person would believe that I had done it. A son does not
  poison his father! It is incredible! Am I a monster?"</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey expressed no comment.</p>

  <p>"And, anyhow," he went on, "what a fool I would be to make an attempt on
  my father's life when he had just made a will cutting me off!"</p>

  <p>"But you did not know that," she coldly pointed out. "You told me you had
  just found it out. Yesterday all you knew was that your father
  <i>intended</i> to change his will. On former occasions it had not been
  accomplished so quickly."</p>

  <p>The young man pressed his head between his hands. "Oh, God! what a
  frightful position I am in!" he groaned.</p>

  <p>"Why did you come back yesterday?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"For the most natural reason in the world. I had cooled off. I was sorry
  for some of the things I had said. I hoped he might be sorry too."</p>

  <p>"Were you prepared then to accept the Princess?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no! There was no question about that," he answered quickly. "I just
  wanted to say I was sorry. I suppose it won't be believed, but I loved my
  father. Besides, why not confess it? I am only human. I was worried about the
  will. I care for money as little as any man, but the threat that had been
  held over me was that Theodore Varick, my father's nephew, was to get it all,
  in order to carry on the family traditions&mdash;Oh, my God! The thought that
  that...excuse me! that <i>he</i> might be able to crow over me! that snooper!
  that worm!&mdash;he's not a man, he's a water-cooler! Why, for the last five
  years he's been sucking up to my dad, sympathising with him for having such a
  graceless son! Gad! once I had the pleasure of smashing his pasty face and I
  hope to do it again! Anything to keep Theodore out! I came back prepared to
  eat humble pie, to agree to anything short of marrying myself to that foreign
  woman."</p>

  <p>"You went direct to your mother's room?" prompted Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Did you send word to your father that you were in the house?"</p>

  <p>"No, indeed, he would only have refused to see me. I went to his study. I
  went through all the rooms of the two suites so I wouldn't show myself
  outside."</p>

  <p>"Was the Princess still with him?"</p>

  <p>"No, he was alone when we..."</p>

  <p>"Who was with you?" interrupted Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"Nobody," he said. "A slip of the tongue. I was thinking of my mother. We
  had been discussing whether she ought to come with me, but she didn't."</p>

  <p>"Now, come," said my employer with dry good-humour. "Isn't it a fact that
  Mrs. Varick was out of the house altogether at that hour?"</p>

  <p>"Well...yes," he said sullenly. "If you know everything already why ask
  me? She was out. Is that important?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Mme. Storey. "Go on."</p>

  <p>"Cristina must have just gone, I could smell her perfume, and my father
  was still fussed."</p>

  <p>"That made it more difficult for you then."</p>

  <p>"No, on the contrary, I think he was relieved that the thing was done
  with. He treated me pretty decent&mdash;for him. Of course, he was pretty
  stiff with me, he was never the one to admit he had been wrong. But I think
  he showed it a little. At any rate, he didn't refuse my hand. He had his tea,
  and I drank a whisky and soda...Gabbitt must have found the glass! Was it he
  who gave me away?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Mme. Storey. "Every servant in the house knew you had been
  here, and all of them lied."</p>

  <p>"Well, bless their hearts!" he said with a twisted smile. "I seem to get
  everybody in wrong. It would have been better if I'd never been born!"</p>

  <p>"What did your father say to you?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"He scolded me for having sneaked into the house secretly. Said it was
  very <i>infra dig</i>. He was afraid somebody might find me in his study. He
  sent me away, and told me if I would come back after things had cleared
  up&mdash;by that he meant after Cristina had left the country; she was not
  named between us&mdash;and would come in by the <i>front door</i>, he would
  be glad to see me."</p>

  <p>"He did not refer to the new will he had made?"</p>

  <p>"Not a word! He wouldn't, you see, if he was feeling more kindly towards
  me. He would just tear it up afterwards. At any rate, I thought he had
  climbed down a good deal, and I went away happy...At Buffalo in the middle of
  the night the telegram was put on the train that brought me back. And now
  everything is ruined! My father is dead, and Theodore has his shoes, I
  suppose!" His head went down between his hands again.</p>

  <p>"Where were you going on the train?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"Nowhere in particular. Just keeping out of the way until Cristina
  sailed."</p>

  <p>"How unlucky that there was no witness to the final interview with your
  father," remarked Mme. Storey. It had the sound of a question.</p>

  <p>He hesitated for the fraction of a second; his eyes bolted painfully; then
  he blurted out: "No, there was no witness."</p>

  <h3>XII</h3>

  <p class="first">Soon afterwards we left the dining-room, and sauntered down
  the great hall. Following upon the little outburst of emotion that I have
  described, we had assumed the ordinary appearances of good form. It is
  instinctive. Nothing in my employer's manner suggested that Henry Varick had
  rendered himself an object of suspicion by his disclosures. She talked of
  ordinary matters in an ordinary manner. He answered in kind, of course, but I
  could see from his uneasy glances that he did not know what to make of her.
  He was wondering whether he had to deal with an agent of the police who was
  trying to entrap him, or with a woman of the world who took everything as it
  came. As a matter of fact, my employer was both.</p>

  <p>"The library is at the other end," he said; "it's a pleasant room. Let's
  go in there."</p>

  <p>It was a most inviting room, but "library" I judged to be a polite
  fiction; there were no books visible. Though the spring was well advanced
  there was a wood fire burning on the hearth which gave off a most agreeable
  warmth. We ranged ourselves before it in luxurious easy-chairs, and talked
  like congenial acquaintances, who had nothing in particular on their minds.
  This sort of rambling casual conversation is one of Mme. Storey's most
  insidious lines of attack, and I could see that Henry Varick was growing more
  and more visibly uneasy. He must have been under a terrible strain. The only
  other light besides the fire was given by a shaded reading-lamp in a
  corner.</p>

  <p>I say we talked, but the truth is they talked, while I sat perfectly
  silent, feeding my infatuation with the sight of that handsome young face in
  the firelight, haggard with passionate emotion. It was most of all tragic
  when he smiled in a reckless boy fashion, trying to carry things off lightly.
  I was in a rapt state, scarcely mistress of myself. It only needed a spark to
  set me off. While we sat there a footman came in with a note for Mme. Storey.
  This I judged must come from Inspector Rumsey via the underground channel
  they had provided. She read it with a bland face, tore it into small pieces,
  and tossed them on the fire.</p>

  <p>"From Inspector Rumsey," she said. "He says he can trace no sales of
  aconitina recently."</p>

  <p>I guessed that there was more in it than this, and so, apparently did
  Henry Varick. He watched the little pieces catch fire one by one with an
  expression of baulked curiosity.</p>

  <p>More conversation followed. Mme. Storey discussed her work on the case
  with apparent frankness. Some time afterwards, long enough anyhow for us not
  to connect what she said with the arrival of the note, she brought the talk
  around to the plan of the second floor. "In order to be able to figure out
  what happened, I must have that clear in my mind," she said. "I visited most
  of the rooms today, but I didn't like to go into your suite without having
  you along."</p>

  <p>There was but one thing that he could reply to this. "Shall we go up
  now?"</p>

  <p>"If you don't mind."</p>

  <p>It was rather touching to find in that grand house a simple boy's room. I
  judged that it had been changed very little since Henry Varick was fifteen or
  sixteen years old. The school pennants were still tacked on the walls, and
  that type of picture that adolescent boys like, depicting flamboyant misses
  in sports clothes. There were fencing foils and masks hung up; a set of
  boxing gloves; a shotgun, a rifle, and various sporting trophies. There was
  an armoire full of baseball bats, hockey sticks, tennis rackets and like
  impedimenta. Evidently young Henry had been no effete son of luxury.</p>

  <p>This was the "study," which like "library" downstairs was a misnomer. Two
  shelves, and those not full, contained all the books. Many of them I noticed
  dealt with chemistry and drugs. Mme. Storey pulled out a fat green volume
  that was entitled: <i>Pharmacology and Therapeutics</i> and skimmed through
  it. "Have you consulted this lately?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Not in years," he said carelessly.</p>

  <p>She then did something that I had seen her do before; a simple trick that
  has an uncanny effectiveness. Holding the book loosely between her two hands,
  she let it fall open of itself. She repeated this two or three times. "Yet I
  should say that it <i>has</i> been consulted recently," she said quietly,
  "and more than once. See! It opens of itself on page 425."</p>

  <p>We looked over her shoulder, he on one side, I on the other, and there we
  saw staring at us from the page a chapter heading: XXI&mdash;ACONITINE.</p>

  <p>It gave me a horrid shock; Henry Varick, too. He stepped back, his face
  working spasmodically.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said harshly, "does that prove anything?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Mme. Storey, closing the book and putting it back.</p>

  <p>"Anyhow," he went on, in a loud, strained voice, "I am perfectly familiar
  with the action of aconite. I wouldn't have to consult that book." This was
  an answer that cut both ways. The next object of interest in the room was a
  glass fronted curio cabinet that contained the schoolboy's collections. One
  saw the usual things neatly set out on the shelves; the minerals, the
  fossils, the arrowheads and pipe bowls. And on the lower shelves;
  butterflies, beetles, birds' eggs and miscellaneous souvenirs. It was more
  comprehensive than the usual youngsters' gatherings, because this boy had
  been well supplied with money. I could picture the handsome, intent stripling
  arranging his treasures.</p>

  <p>"Where is your collection of drugs?" asked Mme. Storey quietly.</p>

  <p>It came like a blow. He caught his breath, and started to answer, but she
  checked him with a sudden, involuntary gesture. "Ah, don't lie to me!" she
  said with real feeling. "It shames you and me both. I am to blame. I will
  deceive you no longer. The letter that I got from Inspector Rumsey said: 'I
  have learned that Henry Varick while he was engaged in the drug business
  caused a collection to be made of samples of every drug. The samples were
  contained in a walnut case which was sent to his home. Presumably the drug
  aconitina was included amongst the rest, but I cannot verify this at the
  moment. See if you can trace the case.'"</p>

  <p>"I wasn't going to lie to you," Henry Varick said in his rapid, strained
  voice. "I had such a collection, but I destroyed it two years ago. When the
  trust busted I was sick of the business. Besides, such a thing was too
  dangerous to have lying around."</p>

  <p>It was only too clear that he was lying then. It made me feel sick at
  heart.</p>

  <p>"How did you destroy it?" asked Madame Storey.</p>

  <p>"Burned it up entire in the furnace downstairs."</p>

  <p>She said no more, but led the way into the bedroom adjoining, a bare and
  sparsely furnished chamber almost like a hospital room. Amidst the almost
  oppressive luxury of that house it was like a breath of fresh air. In one
  corner stood a narrow white bed.</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey stood in the doorway looking around her without speaking. Out
  of the corner of my eye I could see that the face of the young man beside me
  was livid and sweating. I suffered with him. Finally, my employer said in a
  deadly quiet voice: "Turn down the mattress, Bella."</p>

  <p>A groan was forced from the young man that seemed to come from his very
  entrails. "Oh, God! I'm lost!"</p>

  <p>With trembling arms I obeyed my mistress. Between mattress and springs
  there was revealed a flat square walnut box of the sort that artists use to
  carry their paints in. Evidently, it had been hastily thrust there while a
  better hiding place was sought, or a chance to destroy it.</p>

  <p>"Have you anything to say?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>He broke into a bitter fleering laughter. "Say? What do you want me to
  say? You've got a case against me, haven't you? Better proceed with it. I
  guess I've reached the point where I'd better keep my mouth shut without
  advice of counsel." This was merely the bravado of one who was
  half-crazed.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, I had laid the box on the bed, and let the mattress fall back
  into place. The box was locked.</p>

  <p>"Have you the key?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"What the use?" he cried. "I admit the stuff was there, and it's gone
  now." Nevertheless, he produced his keys, and sought for the right one.</p>

  <p>"Have those keys ever been out of your possession?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Was there ever another key?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>I could no longer keep still. I was in a state approaching collapse
  myself. "You are convicting yourself!" I cried to him.</p>

  <p>"Oh, what does it matter?" he said.</p>

  <p>My mistress gave me a curious glance of pity. I didn't want pity from her.
  In the condition of mind that I was in, she represented the enemy. "When did
  you put it under the mattress?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"This afternoon. I intended to burn it tonight when the house was
  quiet."</p>

  <p>"Oh, keep still! keep still!" I cried, clasping my hands. Neither paid any
  attention to me.</p>

  <p>"Where was it before that?"</p>

  <p>"In the curio cabinet."</p>

  <p>"Has anybody a key to that cabinet but yourself?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>By this time the box was open. It was lined with red velvet, and was
  divided into scores of little grooves holding glass phials full of drugs,
  stopped with wax or some such substance. Each phial had its label neatly
  pasted around it; and as a further precaution, there was a number under each
  groove, and an index pasted into the top of the box. <i>One groove was
  empty</i>! Under it was the number 63, and our eyes flew to the index above.
  We read opposite 63&mdash;Aconitina.</p>

  <h3>XIII</h3>

  <p class="first">Mme. Storey sent for Jarboe, and Mr. Henry was locked in his
  bedroom. The windows looked out upon a stone paved well or court about thirty
  feet below, and there was no way he could have escaped short of wings.
  However, the house was full of the young man's friends, and my mistress
  telephoned to Inspector Rumsey for a guard to be sent. This man, Manby, was
  posted in the outer room of the suite. Jarboe was heartbroken by this turn of
  affairs. We took nobody else into our confidence. When Mrs. Varick learned
  her son was a prisoner we expected the devil to pay.</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey and I slept in the house. Early next morning the body of
  Commodore Varick was privately removed to the family vault in Woodlawn
  cemetery, there to await further orders from the police. There had been no
  official reading of the will, but everybody in the house now seemed to know
  what it contained. The Commodore had created a great trust fund of which his
  wife was to be sole beneficiary during her lifetime. Upon her death the
  fortune was to be divided into three equal parts, of which one was to go to
  the New York Hospital, one to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and one to Yale
  University. Mr. Henry's worst fear was not realized inasmuch as Mr. Theodore
  Varick's name did not appear.</p>

  <p>In describing the dramatic scenes that took place inside the house, I must
  not omit mention of the efficient, but quite unspectacular spade work that
  was going on outside. There was a small army of operatives engaged on the
  case. To ensure secrecy, Inspector Rumsey had agreed that, at any rate for
  the first twenty-four hours, our men should be principally used on this work.
  Every move of Dr. Slingluff's and Miss Priestley's was shadowed. On Miss
  Gilsey we could get no line because she lived in the house, and had never
  left it since the murder. The valet, Gabbitt, and indeed, all the servants in
  the house were picked up whenever they went out. Frequent reports from these
  operatives reached Mme. Storey under cover to Mrs. Varick.</p>

  <p>In addition to these outside men, our best operative, Crider, was
  installed as a footman inside the house. Crider's work however, resulted in
  nothing. He complained that from the very first, every servant in the house
  was aware of who he was, and became mum in his presence. This looked as if
  Jarboe had played us false, since none but he knew where Crider had come
  from. By a clever piece of detective work the police had established that the
  first anonymous letter (the one addressed to Inspector Rumsey) had been
  mailed in a pillar box on Lexington Avenue somewhere between 36th and 42nd
  Streets shortly before eleven on Tuesday night; whereas the second letter
  (addressed to Mme. Storey) had been dropped in a chute at the branch post
  office in the Grand Central Station at 3.30 on Wednesday afternoon. The
  peculiarly formed characters had aided in the tracing of these letters.</p>

  <p>A report had been received from the chemists to whom Commodore Varick's
  medicines had been sent the day before. It was to the effect that they
  contained nothing but what was represented on the labels; the first, a
  tincture of digitalis of the usual strength; the second, capsules containing
  a simple compound of pepsin and bismuth.</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey and I established ourselves in Commodore Varick's office. My
  mistress dictated to me some notes she had taken of an examination of one of
  the maids while I was busy elsewhere. This maid, Nellie Hannaford by name,
  had removed the tea things from the Commodore's study. Hannaford said she met
  nobody in the Commodore's suite. She said that Gabbitt had already been sent
  for to come to his master, but there were three doors between her and the
  Commodore's bedroom, and she saw nothing, or heard nothing that led her to
  suppose the master had been taken sick. In fact, she hadn't heard anything
  about his sickness until after he was dead.</p>

  <p>She said she found on the study table two empty cups that had contained
  tea, and another cup in the service pantry full of tea that had been made and
  not drunk. Four of the tea balls had been used, indicating that four cups of
  tea had been made. The cups belonged to a tea service that was kept in the
  Commodore's suite, and it was her duty to wash them in the pantry, and return
  them to the shelves. She denied having found a glass that had contained
  whisky and soda. (In making this statement we supposed she was lying.)</p>

  <p>"Who could the third cup of tea have been for?" I asked involuntarily.</p>

  <p>"Think, Bella," said my employer with a smile. "Surely it was obvious when
  we questioned Henry Varick last night, that he did not go to his father's
  study alone. Mrs. Varick was out of the house, remember."</p>

  <p>The picture of a lovely blue-eyed face rose before my mind's eye, a face
  stony with distress. Estelle Gilsey! I thought in amazement. Another one!
  Good Heavens! this young man was entangled amongst women like a horseman in a
  thicket! While we were still engaged in routine work Miss Priestley entered
  the room. The tall dark girl still had faintly the look of one suffering from
  shock. Her curious parrot-like utterance carried out the idea. What she said
  seemed to have no relation to the remote, sombre glance of her dark eyes. It
  was her room that we were working in, and Mme. Storey apologised
  politely.</p>

  <p>"Oh," said Miss Priestley with a gesture, "I scarcely know what right
  <i>I</i> have here now that the Commodore is gone. The bottom has fallen out
  of everything. It is just a blind instinct that brings me back to finish his
  work as far as I can...I will carry it into the study if I am in your
  way."</p>

  <p>"No, indeed!" said Mme. Storey. "If anybody moves, it shan't be you. At
  present we are only engaged in routine work."</p>

  <p>Lighting a cigarette, my employer leaned back in her chair, and started
  chatting with the girl in offhand, friendly fashion. She told Miss Priestley
  many of the details of the case that had come to light overnight, but not the
  more important developments. And then, characteristically, she graduated by
  insensible degrees from the act of <i>giving</i> information into that of
  <i>seeking</i> it.</p>

  <p>"I expect that will be a very interesting book," she remarked, with a nod
  towards the pile of typescript that the secretary had taken from a
  drawer.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes!" said Miss Priestley; "the Commodore was acquainted with all of
  the most eminent persons of his time."</p>

  <p>"And, of course, his end will give the book a tragic interest now."</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't!" said the girl with one of her curious wooden gestures. "It is
  too dreadful to reflect that what you say is true!"</p>

  <p>"Is it nearly finished?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"Yes. I shall be able to bring it up to the end of 1918. That will include
  all the most interesting parts of the Commodore's life."</p>

  <p>"How long had he been working on it?"</p>

  <p>"Since last May. It is just a year since he engaged me to help him with
  it."</p>

  <p>"A year!" said Mme. Storey. "Bless me! Isn't that a long time to take in
  writing a book? I understood that books were written overnight nowadays."</p>

  <p>"Not this one," said the girl patting the sheets. "The Commodore took the
  greatest pains in polishing his style...Besides, you must remember that he
  was a man of many engagements. He could not spare very much time to it."</p>

  <p>"Did he work on it when he was in Europe last winter?"</p>

  <p>"No. He had no intention of doing so. The script was left at home."</p>

  <p>"What did you do during that time?"</p>

  <p>"I stayed at home. The Commodore was good enough to pay me my salary while
  he was away. I was so familiar with the work that he wished to be sure of
  getting me to go on with it when he returned."</p>

  <p>"Was Mr. Henry interested in this work of his father's?"</p>

  <p>"I can hardly say that he was interested in it. Mr. Henry is not very
  literary."</p>

  <p>"But he knew that it existed?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes. He was in and out of the house all last summer at Easthampton
  while we were working on it. A reconciliation took place between Mr. Henry
  and his father in June, and he stayed a month with us."</p>

  <p>The conversation was rudely broken off at this point. If my description of
  the plan of the house was clear, it will be remembered that the room beyond
  the Commodore's office was Mr. Henry's study. There was a door between, but
  it was not used. I suppose it had been locked when the rooms were first
  divided into suites. From the next room we heard a suppressed shriek. Mme.
  Storey and I both jumped to our feet, but Miss Priestley was before us. That
  strange girl, as if electrified by the sound, was out of the door like a
  flash and in through the next door, Mme. Storey and I making a bad second and
  third. In Mr. Henry's study the situation could be read at a glance. The
  detective stood barring the way to the bedroom door. Facing him stood Estelle
  Gilsey frozen with horror, one hand clapped over her mouth as if to still an
  incontrollable need to shriek. A black dress emphasized the fragility of her
  fair beauty. She turned to my mistress.</p>

  <p>"He won't let me in!" she gasped. "...He is a policeman!...Henry is
  arrested...!"</p>

  <p>Before my mistress could answer her Miss Priestley spoke. The dark girl
  held herself like a very Juno then, her handsome face icy with scorn. Her
  self-control was in very odd contrast to her mad dash out of the room just
  now. Verily, as I knew to my cost, a woman's infatuation leads her to cut
  strange capers! I perceived in Julia Priestley still another victim. She said
  with a superb air of scorn: "What are you doing here?"</p>

  <p>The blonde girl beyond half a glance paid no attention to her. She
  repeated her agonised question of my mistress: "Is he arrested?"</p>

  <p>"What are you doing in his room?" reiterated Miss Priestley. "In his
  bedroom? Have you no shame?"</p>

  <p>Miss Gilsey turned on her then. It appeared that the blue eyes could flash
  sparks, too. "What business is it of yours?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"You would not have dared while the Commodore was alive!" cried the other
  girl. "His body has scarcely been carried out of the house. You are
  shameless!"</p>

  <p>"Be quiet!" cried the blonde girl, stamping her foot. "Everybody knows
  what's the matter with <i>you</i>!"</p>

  <p>What a scene! It appeared that the delicate little thing could show her
  claws, too. We are indeed all alike under our skins. My mistress was taking
  it all in with a sphinx-like regard. To add to the confusion Mr. Henry began
  to pound on the other side of the bedroom door. "Let me out! Let me out!"</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey nodded to the detective, who thereupon opened the door. Henry
  Varick seemed to catapult out of the inner room. He had eyes for none of us
  except Miss Gilsey. He seized her in his arms. "Oh, my darling!" he
  murmured.</p>

  <p>She, too, forgot the world. Her arms wreathed themselves around his neck.
  "Henry!...Henry...!" she murmured. I thought she was about to faint.</p>

  <p>So it was revealed at last which one among the many girls young Henry
  favoured. I experienced no feeling of jealousy against Estelle Gilsey. In the
  first place, I had seen from the beginning that there was some sort of an
  understanding between them, and anyhow, in my crazy infatuation there was no
  thought of self. I cannot say as much for Julia Priestley. She surveyed this
  scene with cold and amused scorn, but the rising and falling of her breast
  betrayed the inner tempest. She uttered two words: "Good comedy!"</p>

  <p>That drew Henry's attention to her. When he perceived who it was he
  dropped his girl as if she had been red hot. He flushed and then paled, and a
  craven look came into his face that was very painful to see if you were fond
  of him. The tall girl seemed taller still, regarding him like an empress with
  flashing eyes. He could not face the situation. He turned and fled back into
  his bedroom.</p>

  <p>Estelle made as if to follow him. "Henry!" she gasped. But at that moment
  there was a knock on the outer door, and she stopped. Strange it was to see
  how we all drew masks over our faces. There was one thing all were agreed
  upon in that house; to hush things up. Estelle allowed the detective to lock
  the bedroom door. Meanwhile, Mme. Storey opened the other. It was Jarboe,
  showing an anxious face. Evidently he had heard something, but had succeeded
  in keeping the other servants off. Mme. Storey reassured him with a word, and
  he went away again.</p>

  <p>But the interruption had put a permanent quietus on the scene. Both girls
  had had time to reflect on the danger of giving too much away. Each was now
  elaborately ignoring the other. As soon as Jarboe was out of the way, the
  tall beauty marched out of the room with her head up, and, as you might say,
  all colours flying. When she disappeared the little blonde's head went down,
  and she began to shake. She struggled hard to get a grip on herself, but
  couldn't make it. Apparently she thought it was useless to ask to see Henry
  again. With her face working incontrollably, she suddenly darted for the
  outer door.</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey detained her for a moment. "Keep the secret from Mrs. Varick
  as long as possible," she said. "Don't return to her until you can show a
  smooth face."</p>

  <p>The girl nodded her head mutely, and flew. When we returned to the next
  room the other one, extraordinary creature! was tapping away at her
  typewriter as if she had never left it.</p>

  <h3>XIV</h3>

  <p class="first">The next thing that happened was the arrival of Inspector
  Rumsey at the Varick house. It transpired that Mme. Storey had sent for him
  before I was up. He arrived in a closed car by way of the courtyard. We three
  retired into the Commodore's study to consult.</p>

  <p>"I must yield up my responsibility in this case," said Mme. Storey at
  once.</p>

  <p>"Hey?" said the Inspector, very much startled. "What's the matter?"</p>

  <p>"The situation here grows worse and worse," said my employer, "and I
  cannot any longer be responsible to the police. It ties my hands. It forces
  me to act in a manner counter to my best judgment."</p>

  <p>"But you have full liberty of action," he protested.</p>

  <p>"No, I have not. Sit down, and let me tell you the whole situation," which
  she proceeded to do. I helped out by reading portions of the notes I had
  taken.</p>

  <p>When she had come to an end the Inspector shook his head heavily. "Bad!
  Bad!" he said. "I quite understand your feelings. But my duty is clear, of
  course. I must arrest Henry Varick."</p>

  <p>"That is what I expected you to say," said Mme. Storey with a faint smile;
  "and that is why I must wash my hands of you. Because <i>I am not satisfied
  that Henry Varick poisoned his father</i>."</p>

  <p>My heart jumped for joy hearing her say this. I felt that I had found my
  dear mistress again. I blamed myself for having doubted even a moment that
  her heart was in the right place.</p>

  <p>"But," protested the Inspector, "Commodore Varick died of a dose of
  aconite; his son was the last person to be with him before he was taken sick;
  by his own admission he had eaten and drunk with his father; and Henry Varick
  <i>had the aconite</i>. Why, it's a <i>prima facie</i> case!"</p>

  <p>"Not quite," said my employer. "And anyhow, I don't care if it is or not.
  I may say that there is even more damaging evidence against Henry Varick. I
  know it is there, though I have not yet brought it out. It wouldn't make any
  difference. All the evidence in the world would not satisfy me."</p>

  <p>"You are illogical," complained the Inspector.</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey arose and tossed her hands up. "Ah, there's the rub!" she
  cried. "There's the old point of division between you and me. You work by
  logic, my friend, and I by intuition. Oh, everybody is on your
  side&mdash;everybody except Bella here, who is just another silly woman and
  doesn't count&mdash;lawyers, judges, juries and the great public, all on your
  side, all they think of is evidence. It's absurd the importance they attach
  to evidence, which is the most unreliable thing in the world."</p>

  <p>"You can't take intuition into a court of law," said the Inspector.</p>

  <p>"So much the worse for the court," she retorted. "That's why so many
  trials are solemn farces. And look at the work it makes for me! Three
  quarters of my time, I suppose, is spent in digging up 'evidence' to prove
  what anybody can see is so at a glance!"</p>

  <p>It was impossible to tell whether she was speaking quite seriously or not.
  This was an old subject of dispute between her and the Inspector.</p>

  <p>He said: "Well, to return to Henry Varick; what makes you suspect he may
  not have done it?"</p>

  <p>"The whole character of the man, and all the former acts of his life so
  far as they have come to light."</p>

  <p>"I can't go with you there!" said the Inspector. "My whole experience
  teaches me that murder crops out in the most unexpected places."</p>

  <p>I saw a retort spring to my mistress's lips, but she withheld it, for
  fear, I suppose, of hurting our old friend's feelings. She said: "Granted. I
  base my opinion of Henry Varick's innocence on what I have observed of him
  during the past twenty-four hours. On what he said; on the way he looked when
  he said it; and on the tones of his voice. There are men, of course, who can
  simulate anything, but he is not one of them. He is just an ordinary,
  scatterbrained, impulsive young fellow, who has been a little spoiled by too
  much kindness&mdash;especially from our sex; and who has never taken serious
  thought of anything in his life."</p>

  <p>"I have not had the advantage of seeing him," said the Inspector dryly. He
  thought that Mme. Storey had fallen a victim to the young man's charm like
  all the other women.</p>

  <p>It did not escape her. "It is true, what you are thinking of," she said
  with a laugh. "I am crazy about him. But, letting that go for the moment,
  consider his actions. A murder by poison, of course, is not committed in the
  heat of passion; it requires planning. If he planned this out, is it
  reasonable to suppose that he would go off to Buffalo, and leave that
  tell-tale cabinet of drugs here in the house?"</p>

  <p>"They always forget something."</p>

  <p>"Surely! But not <i>the</i> thing."</p>

  <p>"Does your intuition suggest who <i>did</i> commit this murder?" he asked
  dryly.</p>

  <p>"I may have my notions," she said, "but I do not intend to speak of them
  until I have dug up the necessary evidence."</p>

  <p>"How long will that take you?"</p>

  <p>"How can I tell?" she said, spreading out her hands. "I may never get it.
  Lots of things which are as plain as the nose before your face cannot be
  <i>proven</i>."</p>

  <p>"What is the additional evidence against Henry Varick that you spoke of?"
  he asked. "I suppose I have the right to ask for that."</p>

  <p>"Oh, assuredly!" she said, turning away with a gesture. "But it's so
  painful! so very painful! However, all must come out, of course." She turned
  back. "Will you promise me not to allow this last disclosure to reach Henry
  Varick's ears for a week?"</p>

  <p>"But why?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Simply because it would break his heart."</p>

  <p>"Oh, very well," he said, a little nettled. He thought we had both lost
  our heads over the young man.</p>

  <p>"Let us find out if Dr. Slingluff is in the house," said Mme. Storey. "He
  has been making frequent visits to Mrs. Varick."</p>

  <p>My heart began to beat as soon as this name was mentioned. From the first
  I had suspected that the secret was in the possession of the family doctor.
  Gabbitt was despatched to find him. Within five minutes he returned, having
  the handsome, dignified practitioner in tow. Mme. Storey introduced the two
  men to each other. As soon as he learned that he was facing a police officer,
  Dr. Slingluff began to sweat. He was such a nice looking man that it was
  painful to see. My employer wasted no time in beating around the bush. She
  said: "Doctor, we had a painful interview yesterday, and a still more painful
  one is before us. It was perfectly evident to me yesterday that you
  were&mdash;if you will excuse me, lying! It may have been from the highest
  motives, but it was nevertheless&mdash;lying!"</p>

  <p>He puffed out his cheeks. "Madam!" he cried, "Your sex protects you. No
  man would dare..."</p>

  <p>"Why become angry?" she interrupted with a smile. "If I am wrong you can
  afford to laugh at me."</p>

  <p>He subsided.</p>

  <p>"What the Inspector and I want to know is," she went on, "why you signed
  that certificate as you did, when you knew that Commodore Varick had been
  poisoned."</p>

  <p>"I did not know it!" he cried. "I have already told you..."</p>

  <p>"Now, doctor," she said cajolingly, "with your skill, your vast
  experience, you cannot expect us to believe that."</p>

  <p>"I don't care whether you believe it or not!" he cried. "It's true!"</p>

  <p>"You're a naturally truthful man," said Mme. Storey, "and lying like
  everything else to be successful requires practice." She pointed to a little
  diamond-shaped mirror that was let into the top of the escritoire. "Look at
  yourself in the glass, doctor. If you saw that face upon another would you
  not say that the man behind it was lying?"</p>

  <p>He would not look, of course, but strode away, cursing under his
  breath.</p>

  <p>"Consider a moment," she went on. "I am your friend because I believe that
  you are actuated by the highest motives. Won't you fare better with me than
  you would with a bawling lawyer in open court? You can't get away with this.
  If you persist in trying to do so, an inevitable public humiliation awaits
  you."</p>

  <p>He dropped in a chair and flung up his hands. "Very well," he said, "I was
  lying!...Oh, God! what a relief!" He wiped his face and forehead with his
  handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"Why did you lie?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"Because the Commodore asked me to. He was my oldest friend."</p>

  <p>"Asked you to!" interpolated the Inspector in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"The moment I clapped eyes on the Commodore I saw that he had been
  poisoned," said Dr. Slingluff. "I suspected aconite owing to the intolerable
  prickling of the skin of which he complained. No other poison gives rise to
  that symptom. I sent Gabbitt on the run to my office for atropine, but I saw
  that it was too late for atropine or anything else. My real reason was to get
  the man out of the room because I saw my friend had something of a private
  nature to say to me. He took one of my hands between his; he was perfectly
  conscious, but I had to stoop low to hear him. He said: 'Fred, I have been
  poisoned!' I nodded. He said with an agonised look of entreaty in his eyes:
  'Keep it a secret, Fred. It rests with you. Oh, God! don't let me die with
  the fear of disgrace and horror on me!' And so I promised, and a look of
  relief came into his dying eyes. Could I have acted differently?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," said Mme. Storey. "But was that all?"</p>

  <p>"That was all."</p>

  <p>"You're an enlightened man," she said, "you're the sort of man, I take it,
  who reserves the right to think and to act for himself on all occasions."</p>

  <p>"I hope so," said Doctor Slingluff.</p>

  <p>"Well, wouldn't it be consistent with your idea of what is right to give
  such a promise to a dying man to ease his death, and then break it afterwards
  if the public interest demanded?"</p>

  <p>He saw that he was in a trap, and refused to answer.</p>

  <p>"You see," said Mme. Storey mildly, "you have not yet told me why you
  lied."</p>

  <p>Silence from the doctor.</p>

  <p>"Commodore Varick also, was a man of the world," she went on, "he must
  have known that in asking such a thing of you, he was asking you to betray
  your professional reputation, your duty to the State. Didn't he appear to be
  aware of this?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Dr. Slingluff.</p>

  <p>"Didn't he give any reason for making such a request?"</p>

  <p>"No!"</p>

  <p>"Didn't he," Mme. Storey asked very softly, "didn't he tell you who
  poisoned him?"</p>

  <p>The same symptoms of extreme agitation appeared in the doctor's candid
  face but he said, as before: "No!"</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey sighed. She said: "It may help to clarify the situation if I
  tell you that Henry Varick has been under arrest since last night. We have
  built up a strong case against him."</p>

  <p>Doctor Slingluff started up out of his chair, and dropped back again in a
  heap. His eyes seemed to start out of his head in horror. Then he covered his
  face. "Henry arrested!" he groaned. "Then everything is over!"</p>

  <p>"You see there is no further occasion for lying," said my mistress
  gently.</p>

  <p>"No!" he murmured wretchedly. "No! God help us!"</p>

  <p>"What were Commodore Varick's last words to you before he died?" asked
  Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"He said," came the husky reply, "he said...'Henry poisoned me.'"<br></p>

  <p>I pass over my private feelings at that moment. The others shared them at
  least to some degree, I fancy. As Mme. Storey had said, the situation was too
  painful. After the stricken doctor had left the room, Inspector Rumsey turned
  to my employer in a kind of amazement. "And you knew it all the time?" he
  said. "You knew what was coming?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I knew it," she said soberly, "in a way."</p>

  <p>"How <i>could</i> you have known it?"</p>

  <p>"By intuition. There was no other way of accounting for the doctor's agony
  of mind yesterday when I questioned him."</p>

  <p>"Can you still tell me that you are not satisfied as to this young man's
  guilt?" demanded the Inspector.</p>

  <p>"I am not satisfied," said Mme. Storey stoutly. "In this latest disclosure
  there is merely an emotional effect, there is no proof. You are crushed by
  the horror of that father's death, believing that his son had poisoned him.
  Suppose he was mistaken?"</p>

  <p>"Impossible!"</p>

  <p>"Suppose the Commodore had taken several substances into his mouth about
  that time, how could he know which might have contained the poison?"</p>

  <p>"By the remembered taste afterwards."</p>

  <p>"It may have been disguised."</p>

  <p>"You are simply hoping against hope," said Inspector Rumsey. "My duty is
  clear. I must take Henry Varick down to headquarters."</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey spread out her hands in surrender.</p>

  <h3>XV</h3>

  <p class="first">However, Henry Varick was not taken away just then. Mme.
  Storey said; "Before we part company in this case, Inspector..."</p>

  <p>He interrupted her in great concern: "Part company?"</p>

  <p>"Well, hereafter, I suppose you will be for the prosecution and I for the
  defence. But let us try one last expedient together with a view to
  discovering the truth."</p>

  <p>"What do you propose?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"You are familiar with the criminal procedure in France and Italy," she
  answered; "how they bring accused and accusers face to face in the court
  room, and let them shout at each other, the idea being that the truth will
  somehow reveal itself in spite of them. It's not a perfect method, but it has
  its points; if there must be shouting in court it seems more reasonable to
  let the principals do it than their hired lawyers, as we arrange it over
  here. I propose that we have Henry Varick and his accuser in here
  together."</p>

  <p>"But his father was his accuser," objected the Inspector, "and he is
  dead."</p>

  <p>"He has another accuser," said Mme. Storey. "Telephone to Manby to fetch
  him in here, and I'll produce her."</p>

  <p>He did so. Meanwhile Mme. Storey went to the door into the office. When
  she opened it one could hear the uninterrupted tapping of the typewriter
  within. She said: "Miss Priestley, will you be good enough to come in here
  for a moment."</p>

  <p>The secretary entered with a look of polite surprise. Inspector Rumsey's
  eyes opened at the sight of her, and that indefinable change took place in
  him that one always sees in a man upon the entrance of beauty. My heart began
  to beat again, foreseeing another painful scene. I wished myself away from
  there, for I felt that I had had about all I could bear.</p>

  <p>A moment later Henry Varick was brought in. The detective was sent back to
  wait until he was called for again. Henry knew by instinct, I suppose, that
  the stranger in the room was a police official, and a desperate look came
  into his eyes. When he saw Julia Priestley also, he changed colour, and
  looked around him wildly like a trapped creature. All this created a very
  unfavourable impression on the Inspector. Guilty! his look said just as
  clearly as if he had enunciated the word. But good heavens! the unfortunate
  young man was half mad with grief and terror. How could he have looked any
  differently? If I had been in his place, I should have looked just the same.
  So far as I could see, Miss Priestley never looked at him.</p>

  <p>"Sit down," said Mme. Storey to Miss Priestley. My employer had assumed a
  bland and smiling air that might have concealed anything.</p>

  <p>Henry was not invited to take a chair, but he did so anyway, not having
  become accustomed as yet to being treated as an inferior. So there we were,
  the five of us. We were grouped around a table at the end of the room
  farthest from the fireplace. It was the same table upon which tea had been
  served two days before&mdash;the Commodore's last meal. The Inspector was
  seated directly at the table, and myself a little behind him. My mistress had
  told me not to produce a note-book, so I had nothing to do but sit with my
  hands in my lap and look on. Mr. Henry had his back to the windows, and Miss
  Priestley was across the room. Mme. Storey was between them, but she did not
  remain in one position, frequently rising to pace back and forth.</p>

  <p>She said to Miss Priestley with her blandest air: "I asked you in, knowing
  your great interest in this matter. Our labours are completed for the moment.
  It would not be proper for me to say that Mr. Henry Varick is guilty, but our
  case against him is complete. He is about to be arrested."</p>

  <p>A haunted look came into the young man's face as he listened to this. It
  seemed like gratuitous cruelty on the part of my mistress, but it was all
  part of her plan.</p>

  <p>"Inspector Rumsey and I want to thank you for the great assistance you
  have rendered us," she said.</p>

  <p>The girl started. "I don't understand you," she said.</p>

  <p>"I am referring to the two letters you wrote," said Mme. Storey. "One to
  Inspector Rumsey and one to me. The first started this investigation, and the
  second directed it into the right channel."</p>

  <p>This was a surprising piece of news to me, and, likewise, to the
  Inspector. But both of us looked as if we had known it all along.</p>

  <p>"I wrote no such letters," said Miss Priestley with an air of great
  astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I quite understand your reasons for wishing to keep in the
  background," said Mme. Storey with a friendly smile. "They do you credit. But
  unfortunately we need you for a witness."</p>

  <p>The girl shook her head with a mystified air. "What reason have you to
  suppose that I wrote the letters you speak of?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey went to the escritoire, and unlocked the drawer that I had
  seen her lock on the day before. From it she took the sheet of paper she had
  then put away. There was a slip clipped to it that she detached. "This
  appears to be a sketch for a title page to Commodore Varick's book," she
  said. "As soon as I saw the lettering I recognised the same hand that had
  written the two anonymous notes. There is just as much character in block
  letters, of course, as in written ones. You have a taste for lettering, I
  see. The characters are formed with care."</p>

  <p>Miss Priestley did not turn a hair. Glancing at the paper, she said with a
  smile: "I am sorry for the truth of your deductions, but that sketch was made
  by Commodore Varick, not by me."</p>

  <p>"That can hardly be," said my employer, still most polite, "because this
  slip was pinned to it. I read upon it: 'Here is a sketch I have made. I hope
  you like it.' And signed with your initials: J. P."</p>

  <p>"Oh, then I have made a mistake," said the girl with the utmost coolness.
  "So many sketches were made at different times; some by the Commodore and
  some by me...However, I know nothing about any anonymous letters."</p>

  <p>"Ah, you can't be allowed to keep modesty in the background," said Mme.
  Storey smiling. "In the net of espionage we have spread you had to be
  included, of course, and we know all about your movements during the past
  thirty-six hours. You live in an apartment on Lexington Avenue at
  Thirty-Seventh Street. From a hall boy there we have learned that you went
  out about nine-thirty on Tuesday night, returning in a moment or two with a
  newspaper. The incident was fixed in the boy's mind, because he wondered why
  you hadn't sent him for it. The late editions that night carried the first
  news of Commodore Varick's death. When you read that his death had been
  ascribed to natural causes, you feared that the ends of justice would be
  defeated, and you wrote the first letter. You came out with it a half-hour or
  so later, and again the hall boy wondered why you didn't let him post it. But
  you had a very good reason, of course. It was addressed to Inspector Rumsey
  at Police Headquarters. Through the post office we have established that that
  letter was posted on Lexington Avenue somewhere between Thirty-Sixth Street
  and Forty-Second, and was taken up in the eleven o'clock collection."</p>

  <p>Miss Priestley listened to this with an enigmatic smile. It was all a
  mystery to Henry Varick, of course. He sat forward in his chair listening
  with strained anxiety.</p>

  <p>"The second letter we can bring even closer to you," Mme. Storey went on.
  "You will remember you and I were talking in the next room about half-past
  two yesterday, when the name of the Princess Cristina was suddenly injected
  into the case, and I went tearing off to find her. Again you thought the real
  criminal was likely to escape, and you sat down and wrote the second note.
  You left this house at 3.10, somewhat earlier than your custom. You were
  picked up by a detective and followed. You entered the branch post office in
  the Grand Central Station, and dropped a letter in a chute. My operative
  could not see the address; however the post office has reported to us that
  the second anonymous letter was received through a chute in that post office
  and cancelled at 3.30."</p>

  <p>"Well, I give in," said the girl with a calm gesture. "I didn't want to
  appear in this horrible case, but I see it is inevitable."</p>

  <p>"Inspector Rumsey and I have only one question to ask you," said Mme.
  Storey. "How did you know that Commodore Varick had been poisoned?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't know it," she said quickly, "I only suspected it."</p>

  <p>"Your first note stated it as a fact."</p>

  <p>"I know. I thought an investigation ought to be made. I thought that would
  be the best way of bringing it about."</p>

  <p>"Oh, quite. What made you suspect that he had been poisoned?"</p>

  <p>Miss Priestley hesitated. She glanced fleetingly at Henry through her
  lashes. "Ought he to be present when I am telling these things?" she
  asked.</p>

  <p>Mme. Storey looked at the Inspector in seeming concern. A glance of
  intelligence passed between them which the girl could not have seen. "How
  about it, Inspector?" my employer asked. "Is it proper for him to hear
  this?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," said the Inspector with a judicial air. "A man is always
  entitled to hear what he is charged with."</p>

  <p>I doubted very much if this was the usual practice; however, the girl
  could have known no better. She resumed with the air of one conscientiously
  performing a disagreeable duty: "Mr. Henry knew all about poisons. I knew
  that he had a collection of dangerous poisons. In the past I had heard him
  talk about poisoning people..."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no!" cried Henry in a shocked voice.</p>

  <p>The girl looked at Mme. Storey. "I knew this was going to be painful," she
  murmured.</p>

  <p>"Let me explain!" cried Henry desperately. "It is true that I have talked
  to her about poisons. I have described to her how men would die after having
  taken different poisons; aconite, strychnine, arsenic and so on; but I never
  proposed to poison anybody!"</p>

  <p>"It is not important," said Mme. Storey smoothly. "The fact that you had
  talked about poisons is not sufficient in itself to have aroused her
  suspicions." She turned to the girl. "How did you know that Mr. Henry had
  been in the house on Tuesday afternoon?"</p>

  <p>"I saw him," was the calm reply. She went on: "In my anxiety to keep out
  of all this, I suppressed part of the truth yesterday. I did not, as I then
  told you, go downstairs as soon as I had admitted the Princess to the
  Commodore's study. I went into the office where I had some work to finish. A
  few minutes later I heard the rumble of a man's voice in this room. I was
  greatly astonished, because I had not heard the Princess leave, and I knew
  that the Commodore had no other appointment. In fact, I was alarmed. We all
  considered it a part of our duty to protect the Commodore from possible
  intruders. I went to the door between the two rooms and opened it a crack. I
  saw Mr. Henry in here."</p>

  <p>"Was he alone with his father?"</p>

  <p>A pinched look came into the girl's face. "No," she said stiffly, "Miss
  Gilsey was here too&mdash;if that is her name."</p>

  <p>"Ha!" cried the Inspector.</p>

  <p>"I told you that," said Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"But you only surmised it. This is direct evidence."</p>

  <p>My mistress smiled. To the girl she said: "Please describe what you saw in
  this room."</p>

  <p>"Oh, as soon as I saw it was a family matter I closed the door," she said.
  "I had only the briefest glimpse."</p>

  <p>"What did that glimpse show you?"</p>

  <p>"As I opened the door I heard the Commodore saying: 'Not a cent! Not a
  cent! Let the marriage be annulled and I'll settle!'"</p>

  <p>Mr. Henry started up. "My father never said that!" he cried.</p>

  <p>"Please be silent!" commanded the Inspector.</p>

  <p>"What marriage did he refer to?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"The marriage between Mr. Henry and Miss Gilsey."</p>

  <p>The young man dropped his head between his hands. "I wanted to keep her
  out of this!" he groaned.</p>

  <p>"Oh, they're married, are they?" said my mistress coolly.</p>

  <p>The girl's nostrils became pinched again. "He said they were. But that was
  on the day before. On Monday afternoon Mr. Henry saw his father alone, and
  they had a violent quarrel. They talked so loud I could hear a good deal in
  my room. Mr. Henry told his father then that he was married to Miss Gilsey. I
  don't know if it's true, or if he just said so to get out of the match with
  the Princess. At any rate the Commodore was infuriated because he looked upon
  Miss Gilsey as an adventuress. He told his son not to expect a cent from him,
  and ordered him out of the house."</p>

  <p>"That was on Monday," said Mme. Storey; "now, returning to Tuesday, what
  did you see when you looked in this room?"</p>

  <p>"They were grouped around the tea-table&mdash;this table. As it happened
  it was just in line with the crack of the door. The Commodore had that moment
  risen, and was walking away towards the window there. His back was therefore
  turned to me. Mr. Henry was standing between me and the table, and his back
  was towards me. Miss Gilsey was seated at the table with the tea-tray before
  her, and I could see her face..." The girl hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Well?" prompted Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>Miss Priestley was breathing quickly. "Nothing happened," she said with a
  jerky gesture. "Nothing that I could swear to on the witness-stand. It was
  just a glimpse...I saw her give him an extraordinary look. His hands were
  hidden from me...but he bent over the table a little...it seemed to me that
  the movements of his arms were suspicious...that's all."</p>

  <p>It was a horribly vivid picture that she called up. I think we all
  shuddered. Mr. Henry's face was hidden.</p>

  <p>"And from that you thought...?" Mme. Storey prompted further.</p>

  <p>"Well, taken in connection with what had happened the day before," said
  Miss Priestley. "I knew that Mr. Henry feared the will was going to be
  changed. As a matter of fact it had already been changed, but he could not
  have known of that. I supposed that he had brought the girl along in a final
  effort to soften the Commodore's heart, and when that failed he was rendered
  desperate."</p>

  <p>"Quite!" said Mme. Storey.</p>

  <h3>XVI</h3>

  <p class="first">It seemed as if Mme. Storey's plan to confront them would
  come to nothing, owing to Henry Varick's having been utterly crushed by the
  girl's statement. He sat with his elbows on his knees, and his head pressed
  between his hands. In order to stir him up, the Inspector said in a rasping
  voice: "Have you nothing to say, sir?"</p>

  <p>The young man started to his feet with a wild, despairing face. "What she
  says is nearly true," he cried; "but just that little difference makes all
  the difference between life and death to me!"</p>

  <p>"You may question her if you wish," said Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>He quieted down. "I don't want to question her," he said, "but I want to
  tell her something." He approached the girl, looking at her steadily.
  Something new had come into his face, something firm and fine; it was the
  look of a man brought to the last extremity of grief and danger, who is
  suddenly lifted out of himself.</p>

  <p>"Julia, is it worth it?" he said.</p>

  <p>She was shrinking away from him with a look of repulsion. "Do I have to
  submit to this?" she murmured, appealing to Mme. Storey.</p>

  <p>"It is his right to break down your story, if he can," said my
  mistress.</p>

  <p>The girl drew a long breath, and stiffened herself. "He can't do that,"
  she said confidently, "because I have said nothing but the simple truth. But
  let him try." She sat down in the same chair that she had before occupied,
  and met Henry's glance with a cold smile.</p>

  <p>This time his eyes did not quail from hers. "Julia," he went on, in a low,
  moved voice, "I'm sorry for the way I treated you. I am a coward where women
  are concerned. I can't bear to hurt them. Ever since I grew up it seems I
  have been running away from women. And that only made matters worse, of
  course. I wouldn't face things out. But now I must face things out. If only
  for once I could find the right words to express the truth! Julia, I treated
  you badly. Must I die for that?"</p>

  <p>He paused, searching her face to see if his words had had any effect. How
  she was able to withstand the appeal in those deep blue eyes, I could not
  comprehend. The only sign of emotion she gave was to rise suddenly, and press
  herself against the wall, as if to get as far as possible from him. Her face
  was like marble.</p>

  <p>"You know that this story you have told will send me to the chair," he
  resumed. "It's so nearly true that you can tell it with an easy conscience.
  But is it worth it? In your heart you know that I am incapable of killing my
  father. <i>You know me</i>! Why, the whole trouble between us arose from the
  fact that I was too tender-hearted and easy-going, and you were ambitious.
  You scorned me, remember, because I hadn't the heart to whip a puppy at
  Easthampton that had nipped me."</p>

  <p>I cannot hope to convey in print the moving quality of that grave, young
  voice, low and shaken in tone. I know the tears were rolling unchecked down
  my cheeks, and I could see that both the Inspector and my mistress were
  affected. But the girl listened with a twisted smile in her white face; the
  smile of one who would die sooner than give in.</p>

  <p>"You are mistaken if you think I lied when I told you I loved you," he
  continued. "Your beauty laid a spell on me. I worshipped your beauty. You
  possessed me entirely...But I couldn't marry you. Our natures were too
  different. We would have driven each other mad. I should have told you this,
  or written it, plainly, but I couldn't bring myself to write the words that
  would hurt you. I hoped you would just forget me when I went away...But we
  were happy while it lasted, weren't we? I was in Paradise. If you send me to
  my death you will forget your anger against me, you will only remember the
  times that we were happy. How will you feel then? Is it worth it, Julia? I
  cannot believe that anybody so beautiful can have a bad heart...Do you
  remember..." He took a step closer to her, and murmured something none of us
  could hear. "After that," he asked gravely, "after that, can you bring
  yourself to swear my life away?"</p>

  <p>She strained her face away from him. "I'm sorry," she said in an
  unnatural, twanging voice, "but the truth is the truth! I have nothing to
  change in what I said."</p>

  <p>Henry Varick slowly raised his shoulders, and spread out his palms; then
  his whole body sagged. "Well, that's that," he said in a flat voice. "I'm
  done for, I guess." A painful recklessness appeared on his face. "Come on,
  Inspector!" he cried out. "Come on, old cock, let's go! I don't know where
  I'm going, but I'm on my way!" He stopped short, and an awful goneness
  sounded in his voice. "Oh God! I wish it was to the death chamber that you
  were taking me! That is over in a minute, but the weeks before that...!"</p>

  <p>The Inspector seemed disposed to linger, to talk things over with Mme.
  Storey, and the young man cried out sharply: "Come on! Come on! I can't stand
  any more of this!"</p>

  <p>At a glance from my mistress the Inspector bestirred himself. As the two
  men reached the door, the girl shrieked. The sound seemed to be torn from her
  breast. "Stop! Stop! I cannot bear it! I lied!"</p>

  <p>The two men turned back. When the girl's unnatural self-control broke,
  everything went. Her convulsed face seemed scarcely human. It was dreadful to
  see so complete an abasement.</p>

  <p>"I lied!" she moaned. "I lied from beginning to end. He didn't do it! It
  was I who poisoned Commodore Varick. Oh, what a wretch I am!" She struck her
  head with her clenched hands.</p>

  <p>Henry Varick stared at her like one transfixed with horror. "You killed my
  father!" he murmured from time to time: "You killed my father!"</p>

  <p>I was dazed with the suddenness of it. My mistress motioned to me, and I
  automatically drew a sheet of paper towards me, and with trembling hands
  started to take down what the girl said, scarce knowing what I wrote.</p>

  <p>Her body swayed forward and back. The words came gabbling from her lips,
  as if some terror urged her to get it all out before she could think. "I will
  tell all! It has been in my mind for a long time. But it was Henry that I
  meant to kill. Because he was false to me. First with that foreign woman, and
  afterwards with the contemptible Gilsey girl. It was the poisons that put it
  into my head. Always they were in the next room, tempting, tempting me. I
  found a key that would open the door, and I could go into Henry's study at
  any time without anybody knowing. He was never there. There was a book in
  there, too, that described all the different poisons and how they
  acted...</p>

  <p>"I collected old keys. I bought them in junk-shops and other places, many,
  many keys, until I had got one that would open the curio cabinet, and a
  little one that opened the box of drugs. I took out the bottle of aconite,
  and locked all up again, and threw away the keys. Then I bided my time, and
  studied how to give Henry the poison. But I could think of no way. I never
  saw him any more. I wrote asking him to come to see me, but he paid no
  attention to the letter..."</p>

  <p>"She did...she did!" murmured Henry, like one in a trance.</p>

  <p>"Then I heard Henry tell his father that he was married to that
  white-faced blonde, and I went mad...mad! I changed my plan. I couldn't get
  at Henry, but I had plenty of opportunities with his father. I wanted to
  strike at them, I didn't care which one. I made up my mind to wait until the
  Commodore had changed his will, and then kill him. That was to be my revenge.
  I didn't think until later of putting it off on Henry. That made it
  sweeter!</p>

  <p>"I knew the Commodore took a capsule after every meal. There was a white
  powder in it that looked just the same as the aconite. I got some empty
  capsules and filled them with the aconite. There was only enough to fill
  three. When Henry and the girl were with the Commodore in his study, I
  sneaked around outside, through the foyer of the suite and into the bathroom.
  I took the capsules out of the box, put the poisoned ones in, and went back
  to my room. I watched and listened. I saw Henry and the girl go. The
  Commodore was half-reconciled to them, and it made me smile to think how I
  was going to dish them all!</p>

  <p>"When the Commodore left his study, I followed and listened at the crack
  of the door. I heard him go into the bathroom and come out again. Then I knew
  the thing was done. I knew that I would have just as much time as it would
  take for the capsule to melt in his stomach. Plenty of time to get away. He
  returned to his study, but he never saw me. I was back in the office then. I
  went around through the foyer into the bathroom. There were only two capsules
  in the box, so I knew there had been no slip-up. I replaced them with two of
  the harmless capsules, and went downstairs."</p>

  <p>So much for the facts of her story. I shall not speak of the unfortunate
  girl's ravings. It is too painful. Too great an effort of self-control is
  followed by the collapse of all resistance. It left her exhausted and
  shaking, finally apathetic. Detective Manby was called in, and she was handed
  over to his care. Unable to speak above a whisper then, she begged for
  permission to rest for ten minutes in the office. This was granted.</p>

  <p>The other four of us were left looking at each other, scarcely able to
  comprehend what had happened. I for one was conscious of an immense
  weariness. I felt as if I should drop in my tracks. But it was a delicious
  kind of weariness, the feeling that comes after a shattering storm, when you
  find quiet in your ears once more. Blessed, blessed quiet and peace. At first
  you can hardly believe it. But I looked at Henry Varick, and there he was,
  safe, and my heart was content.</p>

  <p>He, I think, was the first to speak. "And are you through with me, now?"
  he asked wonderingly. "Am I free?"</p>

  <p>"Free as air," said Mme. Storey, laying a hand on his shoulder. "Go to
  your wife and tell her. And to your mother. You appear to have lost your
  fortune, but you have them!"</p>

  <p>Gladness shone out in his face like the sun breaking through. He had
  already forgotten the poor, hysterical wretch in the next room. Well, such is
  youth! "What do I care for the money!" he cried. "If I am free." He ran out
  of the room.</p>

  <p>"Well, I expect your mother won't let you starve," remarked Mme. Storey
  dryly. "And wills have been broken before this!"</p>

  <p>"And so you were right after all!" said Inspector Rumsey generously.</p>

  <p>"As it happens," said my mistress, smiling. "But I was not nearly so sure
  as I made out to be."<br></p>

  <p>Our excitements were not yet over, for presently Detective Manby burst
  into the room with a dismayed face. "She has given me the slip!" he
  cried.</p>

  <p>To make a long story short, at a moment when Manby was not looking
  directly at her, the prisoner had slipped from the office into Henry's study
  adjoining. Manby was not even aware that she had unlocked the door. She
  slammed it in his face, and got out into the main hall. By the time Manby got
  through the two doors, she was nowhere to be seen. None of the servants had
  seen her. To us, of course, it was apparent that she had gone down the
  enclosed stair, of which Manby knew nothing, and out through the secret
  passage. The Inspector was in a rage, but Mme. Storey took it with more than
  usual calmness.</p>

  <p>"It is all for the best," she said enigmatically.</p>

  <p>"For the best!" he exclaimed indignantly.</p>

  <p>"I take it she has gone home," said my mistress, gravely. "But wherever
  she has gone she will soon be found, my friend. The resolve to kill herself
  was in her eye."</p>

  <p>"Justice will be defeated!" cried the Inspector.</p>

  <p>"Man's justice," murmured Mme. Storey with an imperceptible shrug.</p>

  <p>"We must follow her!" cried the Inspector.</p>

  <p>"No! Let us not be seen there," said my mistress, laying a hand on his
  arm. "Send Manby."</p>

  <p>And so it was done.<br></p>

  <p>In my note-book I find the following clipping:<br></p>

  <p>"At 11.15 yesterday morning the body of Miss Julia Priestley, 26, was
  found dead at No. &mdash;&mdash; Lexington Avenue, with a bullet through the
  heart. A new .38 automatic was clutched in her hand, and her clothing
  revealed powder burns. From the position of the body it was apparent that she
  had stood in front of a mirror to aim the gun. She was found in the bedroom
  of a small three-room apartment that she occupied alone at the above
  address.</p>

  <p>"The body was discovered by Detective-Sergeant James Manby. Sergeant Manby
  had been sent to Miss Priestley's apartment as the result of a mysterious
  message received by Inspector Rumsey at headquarters a few minutes earlier.
  Inspector Rumsey was advised by a woman's voice over the telephone, that he
  had better send a detective to the address given. When he asked for
  particulars, his informant hung up. It is supposed that this was Miss
  Priestley herself. When Sergeant Manby reached the apartment, he found the
  door open as if for his convenience. The woman's body was still warm.</p>

  <p>"For the past year Miss Priestley was employed by the late Commodore
  Varick as an amanuensis in the preparation of a book that he was writing. It
  is supposed that the death of her employer, which came with such shocking
  suddenness on Tuesday evening, and the consequent loss of her employment,
  temporarily deranged the young woman's mind. Her nearest relative is a
  brother living in Cleveland, Ohio, who is on his way to New York to take
  charge of the body."</p>

  <p>And that is all that ever got into the papers.</p>
