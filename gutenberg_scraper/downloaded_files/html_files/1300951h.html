  <h2><a id="intro"
     name="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>

  <p class="first">APART from numerous novels, most of which are accessible
  on-line at Project Gutenberg Australia and Roy Glashan's Library, Fred M.
  White published some 300 short stories. Many of these were written in the
  form of series about the same character or group of characters. PGA/RGL has
  already published e-book editions of those series currently available in
  digital form.</p>

  <p>The present 17-volume edition of e-books is the first attempt to offer the
  reader a more-or-less comprehensive collection of Fred M. White's other short
  stories. These were harvested from a wide range of Internet resources and
  have already been published individually at Project Gutenberg Australia, in
  many cases with digitally-enhanced illustrations from the original medium of
  publication.</p>

  <p>From the bibliographic information preceding each story, the reader will
  notice that many of them were extracted from newspapers published in
  Australia and New Zealand. Credit for preparing e-texts of these and numerous
  other stories included in this collection goes to Lyn and Maurie Mulcahy, who
  contributed them to PGA in the course of a long and on-going
  collaboration.</p>

  <p>The stories included in the present collection are presented
  chronologically according to the publication date of the medium from which
  they were extracted. Since the stories from Australia and New Zealand
  presumably made their first appearance in British or American periodicals,
  the order in which they are given here does not correspond to the actual
  order of first publication.</p>

  <p>This collection contains some 170 stories, but a lot more of Fred M.
  White's short fiction was still unobtainable at the time of compilation
  (March 2013). Information about the "missing stories" is given in a
  bibliographic note at the end of this volume. Perhaps they can be included in
  supplemental volumes at a later date.</p>

  <p>Good reading!</p>

  <h2><a id="story1"
     name="story1">1.&mdash;UNBIDDEN GUESTS</a></h2>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Australian Town and Country Journal</i>, 15 Feb
  1905</h3><br>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">Heaven and earth seemed blended together in a great whirling
  wheel. Nurse Clare was conscious of a faint smell of burning wood; in a
  dreamy kind of way she sat up, and asked what was the matter. Then it came
  back to her that there had been an accident, and that she was not in the
  least hurt. The carriage had run off the rails, had pitched sideways down a
  sloping bank, the feeble oil lamp was out, one frosty star indicated the
  angled window and the serene silence beyond.</p>

  <p>Nurse Clare's first thought was for her patient. A dim black bundle loomed
  opposite her. The resolute-looking, clear-eyed nurse was herself again. She
  fumbled for the silver match-box at the end of her chatelaine, and struck a
  vesta. The carriage had fallen over at an angle of forty-five, the dark
  bundle opposite with a smaller bundle in its arms was fast asleep.</p>

  <p>"There has been an accident," Nurse Clare said. "Our slip coach has run
  off the line. I haven't the remotest idea where we are, but I fancy that we
  have the coach to ourselves."</p>

  <p>"And I slept through it," the other woman said. "I was utterly worn out. I
  was up all the night with my boy."</p>

  <p>She hugged the bundle in her arms closer.</p>

  <p>A few hours before these women had been strangers. They had drifted
  together half-way through a long railway journey, and gradually the story had
  been told. It was a tale of struggle and misfortune, a runaway match, and a
  stern, unforgiving father. Then, when things had been getting better, the
  young husband had been stricken down with smallpox, and the young wife's last
  desperate resource was a distant relative in the West of England.</p>

  <p>The slip coach had fallen clear of the line. Clearly there was nobody else
  in it. And there was comfort behind that distant red gleam. Nurse Clare sped
  rapidly along the sleepers till she could see the great crimson star directly
  overhead, and the outline of a signal box beneath it.</p>

  <p>"There has been an accident," she said. "The slip coach to Longford has
  gone off the rails. Nobody has been hurt, only I thought&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A big bearded man came rattling down the stairway.</p>

  <p>"I was getting anxious, Miss," he said. "My mate, who has just gone off
  duty, is telegraphing for assistance. Can I do anything?"</p>

  <p>"We must make use of your box for the present," the nurse said. "Anything
  is better than the railway carriage. Is not Grinstead Priory close by?"</p>

  <p>"It's no use you going over to Grinstead Priory," the big man said. "If
  you crawled up the drive at the last gasp it 'ud just please Squire to set
  his dogs on you and drive you away."</p>

  <p>"That poor little body isn't going to have a case of pneumonia on her
  hands if I can help it," said Nurse Clare. "And as to his dogs, why I just
  love them."</p>

  <p>Nurse Clare pushed her way along until she came at length to a deserted
  lodge, a pair of moss-clad gates leading into the throat of an avenue. By the
  light of a crescent moon Nurse Clare could make out a big sign, "Beware of
  the Dogs." There was a deep-mouthed baying not far off.</p>

  <p>But Clare had little time to picture what might have been. She was
  suddenly transformed into a female Daniel in a den of lions. The frosty air
  boomed with the deep baying of hounds. Clare caught herself thinking of Topsy
  and Eva and Uncle Tom.</p>

  <p>The great brutes raced towards her, howling as they came. Clare's heart
  gave one great bound, and then seemed to stop still. She was honestly and
  sincerely afraid now; she had fully expected to hear the huge hall door fly
  open at the first note of danger. But though lights blazed in every window,
  the house was ominously still and silent.</p>

  <p>The little nurse stood rigidly there as the great hounds bounded towards
  here.</p>

  <p>"Come here," Clare commanded. "Come here, sir."</p>

  <p>The dog came with a shamed gliding movement. The others followed. Clare
  could see the lights gleaming on rows of polished tooth. She moved very
  slowly towards the hall door, she laid her fingers resolutely on the handle.
  Then she staggered into the hall and closed the door swiftly behind her.</p>

  <p>Clare marched resolutely into one of the rooms&mdash;a noble dining-room
  with the table laid for dinner. There were covers for at least a score of
  guests. There were wines of the finest quality, an elegant repast, but
  everything, to the dishes on the sideboard, cold.</p>

  <p>A fire of ripe acacia logs roared up the wide chimney. Before it there sat
  a man in a deep beehive chair, one foot resting on a stool. He was a grey
  man, grey as to his hair and eyes, and hard, clean cut features.</p>

  <p>"Good evening!" he said in a deep sarcastic note. "I heard you outside. My
  hearing is good. You don't lack courage."</p>

  <p>"If I had," Clare said; "those dogs of yours would have torn me to pieces.
  You heard me; and yet you took no steps&mdash;oh! shameless!"</p>

  <p>"I cannot take steps of any kind at present," the man said grimly. "I have
  sprained my ankle badly. As to servants, there are none in the house.
  To-morrow a fresh set will arrive. What do you want here?"</p>

  <p>Clare explained briefly. She would bring her charge there, whether
  Grinstead liked it or not.</p>

  <p>"Mind you it is contraband of war," he said. "If I were not helpless, I
  tell you frankly I would have none of this. It is my mood at this time of the
  year to deck my table out as if I had a house full of people. The last happy
  time I had before I lost all faith in humanity was a Christmas. You see I
  have been decorating the walls with holly and the like. That is how I slipped
  and hurt my ankle. In doing so I displaced those pictures that lie on the
  floor. I shall be greatly obliged if you will replace them on their hooks.
  No, no, not that way&mdash;the face of the portraits to the wall."</p>

  <p>Clare propped the portraits against the table. As her eyes fell upon them
  she gave a gasp of astonishment. They were beautifully painted, and must have
  been excellent portraits. Evidently, too, they were mother and daughter.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">Clare hurried her companion up the avenue, and into the
  house, lest some misfortune should baulk her plans. Grinstead looked up
  grimly; then the black cloud shut down upon his face again. He would have
  risen only the pain in his foot brought him down again with a groan. Clare's
  companion stood there, as if dazed by the light.</p>

  <p>"My daughter," Grinstead cried. "If you think to fool me like
  this&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Marmion knows me," Mrs. Lestrange said unsteadily. "See how he fawns upon
  me, and lick's my hand. Father don't send me away to-night. Let me stay here
  till the morning. Then I will go, and you shall see my face no more. My
  child&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Your child is safe," Nurse Clare said. "We shall stay here to-night. Give
  the boy to me."</p>

  <p>Clare took a pillow from a chair, and laid the boy on it before the fire.
  His cheeks were rosy and flushed, the streaming firelight glistened upon the
  shining curls. With a sudden curiosity, Grinstead bent down to look. The big
  hound growled ominously.</p>

  <p>"When I was in South Africa, I met a nurse. Head of a special mission, and
  called Ursula," said Clare, apropos of nothing apparently. "She was the head
  of a band of nurses equipped and sent out at her own expense. We all knew
  there was a sad story somewhere, and we all felt that she was not to blame.
  But we had to work too hard in those dark days to think of anything but our
  duty. Still, if ever there was an angel, Sister Ursula was one. Then enteric
  broke out, and she was one of the first to fall.</p>

  <p>"I nursed her for a week, but it was obvious what the end would be, and
  just before she died she told me something of her history. She had married a
  man that she respected rather than loved, but he proved a good husband so far
  that she grew very fond of him in time. Then, some time after her little girl
  came, she made a discovery. By means of a deliberate lie her husband had
  separated her from the first love of her heart&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ah," Grinstead said, hoarsely, "so she found that out?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, she found it out. And that was why she left her husband and child
  without a word to go into a kind of convent. It was a dreadful shock to a
  proud nature like hers, and for years she nursed her sorrow alive. She might
  have forgiven that man had he sought her out, but he did not do so. And just
  before she died, before she had time to tell me who she was, she gave me this
  to give to her husband as a token of forgiveness. I am glad that I can hand
  it over to him at Christmas time."</p>

  <p>From her purse Clare drew a simple wedding ring. "Now what do you think of
  this man?" Clare went on. "Because his wife leaves him he loses all faith in
  human nature. He looks upon himself as betrayed. And yet all those years he
  never thinks of the cruel lie by which he parted a woman from the man of her
  heart. He had only one point of view, for his own sin he can feel nothing.
  Why when his daughter gives him a lesson that love is better than all the
  world besides, he sees nothing in it but another personal grievance."</p>

  <p>Grinstead had nothing to say: his sharp tongue was silenced, for all that
  Clare had said was positively true. He had forgotten that dishonourable lie,
  he had deliberately ignored everything but his own wrongs. Even after the
  lapse of years his face flushed as he thought of his wife's feelings when the
  truth came home to her. It was amazing now to realise that he had never for a
  moment dreamt that the fault might have been his.</p>

  <p>"I should have looked till I found you," Clare said. "As it is I have
  found you quite by accident. Sir, the play is played out. It is for you to
  say what situation the curtain shall rise upon."</p>

  <p>It was some time before Grinstead spoke. He was cast down and humiliated,
  a prey to bitter feelings, and yet his heart was lighter than it had been for
  years. He pointed to the blank pictures on the walls.</p>

  <p>"Will you do me a little favour?" he asked. "You were so good as to hang
  up those portraits for me just now. I shall be very glad if you will please
  put them in&mdash;in a more favourable position."</p>

  <p>The words cost Grinstead an effort as Clare could see. Without a word she
  turned the pictures round and dusted them.</p>

  <p>"And now," she said. "We had better see what bedroom accommodation there
  is for us. I presume there are fires laid upstairs. And when that is all over
  I will look to your injured ankle. Come along."</p>

  <p>She swept Eleanor Lestrange out of the room, leaving Grinstead to his own
  troubled thoughts. At his feet the boy lay looking up with dreamy eyes. They
  looked up at him from the floor; they seemed to smile down at him from the
  walls.</p>

  <p>"Ain't you afraid of me?" he said clumsily. The boy rose and climbed on to
  Grinstead's knees.</p>

  <p>"I'm not afraid of anybody," he said, "because everybody loves me."</p>

  <p>Clare laid a hand upon Eleanor Lestrange's shoulder and drew her into the
  shadow. The firelight danced and flickered, and in the centre of it was
  Grinstead with the boy on his knees and his slim hands in the little fellow's
  curls.</p>

  <p>"Your troubles are over," Clare whispered, "and I fancy I shall be here
  long enough to see your husband and your father shake hands yet."</p>

  <p>And she did.</p><br>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">THE members of the Royal Crossboro' Golf Club were suffering
  from a periodical lack of incidents. For instance, nobody had done any holes
  "in one" lately, the merits and demerits of the "Haskell"* <i>et hoc</i> had
  been thoroughly thrashed out, so that the select smoking-room company were
  actually forced back upon quite mundane matters. The afternoon was too wet
  and windy even for golf, and the half-dozen members round the fire had
  finished the usual after-lunch abuse of the Green Committee.</p>

  <p>"Nor'-west gale for the last week," growled one. "I suppose that's why we
  are kept on the back tee at the eighteenth hole. Old Seddon to blame, of
  course."</p>

  <p>"Of course," said another of the smokers. "It means that every ball that's
  fairly well played falls in the Mole brook, and consequently is carried past
  Seddon's house and into his private grounds, where he collects them all. He
  hasn't bought a new ball for years."</p>

  <p>One of the fathers of the club, smoking gravely in his favourite armchair,
  smiled meaningly. There was a deadly feud between Mr. Chorsley aforesaid and
  the wily Seddon, whose residence was quite close to the home green.</p>

  <p>"I've stopped that," Chorsley said. "I had a wire grating fixed across the
  brook just as it passed through the hedge into Seddon's grounds. No more
  annexed Haskell's now. Did I ever tell you how Seddon served me the last time
  we played together in the Spring?"</p>

  <p>The assembled company shuffled uneasily. They had all heard the story
  times out of number, how Seddon had played with his opponent's ball, and
  declared it to be his own. But then Mr. Chorsley was a real good fellow, and
  widely hospitable to boot, and the old old story was endured in silence. And
  Seddon was no favourite in the club.</p>

  <p>"It's a strange thing," another member said, thoughtfully. "For the last
  month Frank Bruce has never made one decent drive over the Mole brook at the
  last hole. He is playing a better game than he has ever played in his life,
  and yet every time he comes to the last tee he slices his drive over the
  boundary into the brook, as it passes into Seddon's property."</p>

  <p>"And never misses when he drops another ball down for a second drive,"
  added another member.</p>

  <p>"One way of getting round old Seddon," a further member remarked. "It's
  love for Mary Seddon, the old boy's niece, that upsets Bruce's nerve at the
  last hole. When he is in sight of the house he is thinking of the
  unattainable and other things."</p>

  <p>"Is that really a fact?" Chorsley asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely," the last speaker replied. "And whatever may be the faults of
  old Seddon, his niece Mary is really a nice girl. She'll have a fair amount
  of money, too, not that Bruce calculates on that. But Seddon's got a sorry
  nephew who comes down from the City now and again, and he's trying to force
  the little girl to marry him."</p>

  <p>"Why doesn't Bruce take matters in his own hands?" Chorsley growled.</p>

  <p>"Well, he can't quite do that. His prospects are good, and he is a really
  smart fellow, but as yet his income is small. Seddon has put his foot down.
  There is to be no more intercourse, nothing till Frank can show a clear
  income of £500 a year. When that comes Seddon magnanimously offers to
  withdraw all opposition. So it's long odds on the nephew."</p>

  <p>Chorsley nodded thoughtfully. He was an easy going kind-hearted old
  gentleman, but he had a pretty temper of his own, and he hated Seddon
  heartily. He would have gone a long way to thwart the miserly man who laid
  traps for golf balls. His eyes twinkled as he looked into the fire. He began
  to see his way. He was not yet retired from the stockbroking firm from whence
  he derived a large portion of his big income.</p>

  <p>"You'll see Bruce when he comes down to-night, Partridge," he said. "I
  wish you'd make up a match with him for me on Saturday, if he has nothing
  else on. Then you can both come afterwards and have dinner with me."</p>

  <p>Partridge promised to arrange the matter if possible, and evidently meant
  it. Chorsley's little dinners were by no means to be despised. And though
  Frank Bruce was an infinitely better player than his elderly opponent, and
  though he was consumed by what looked like a hopeless passion for Mary
  Seddon, he fixed up the match without the slightest hesitation.</p>

  <p>They came along well enough till the last teeing ground was reached. It
  was an interesting match, for at this point the rivals were all square.
  Everything depended upon the last hole. Below the tee was a broken sloping
  ground ending into the tiny but swiftly running Mole brook. Beyond was the
  fair green course and the red flag fluttering in the distance.</p>

  <p>"My honour," said Bruce, as he seemed to be selecting a ball with unusual
  care. "My drive first. I must try and not miss this one. Latterly I can't
  manage this hole at all,"</p>

  <p>He made his tee carefully, and placed a perfectly white new ball upon it.
  Mr. Chorsley made as if to get out of the way, and in doing so kicked the
  ball off the tee, so that it rolled into some heather. With a muttered
  apology, he replaced the dismantled ball.</p>

  <p>"Now go on," he said. "Give me a good lead."</p>

  <p>Bruce swung very slowly up, then his driver came down with a smashing
  force. Away went the ball, not straight across the course, but sliced away to
  the right well over the boundary fence and down till it hopped into the Mole
  brook in Seddon's grounds.</p>

  <p>"Funny thing, isn't it?" Bruce said without the slightest emotion.</p>

  <p>"Very," Chorsley said gravely. "But you'll do better next drive. Of
  course, you can tee up another ball and play three strokes. Go ahead."</p>

  <p>Chorsley got a good drive, and Bruce a beautifully long raking shot. But
  the handicap was too strong, and he lost the hole by a stroke. He bore his
  defeat with singular philosophy.</p>

  <p>"No use getting out of temper," he said.</p>

  <p>"Not a bit," Chorsley chuckled. "See you later on at dinner time.
  Partridge has to leave early, but don't you hurry. I have a word or two for
  your private ear afterwards."</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">A LONG bubbling glass stood at Frank Bruce's elbow, and a
  long cigar between his teeth. The smoking-room was comfortably and not too
  brilliantly lighted; the glowing fire invited confidence.</p>

  <p>Partridge had departed, and Bruce and his host were alone together. For a
  long time the former stared thoughtfully into the fire.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you make up your mind to marry her in spite of him?" Chorsley
  asked.</p>

  <p>"It wouldn't be fair," Bryce said, in the most natural manner, and as if
  there had been a long conversation on the subject nearest his heart. "I
  couldn't afford it yet, and, confound it, Mr. Chorsley, how could you
  possibly guess what I was thinking about?"</p>

  <p>"So what the fellows at the club house say is perfectly true," Chorsley
  went on coolly. "Old Seddon plays the magnanimous, and what he'll do when you
  can show a clear £500 a year. Meanwhile, there is a rival in the path."</p>

  <p>"Yes, confound him!" Bruce growled.</p>

  <p>"Who has the ears of the wicked uncle. This wicked uncle watches the niece
  so carefully that she can't get a line out of the house, and you can't get a
  line into it. And yet you can put her on her guard when the rival is coming
  down, and if you want an interview when you come down here on Saturdays you
  know how to arrange it, don't you?"</p>

  <p>Bruce looked up anxiously, and Chorsley smiled.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm not going to give you away," he said. "It's one of the smartest
  tricks I've ever come across, and that is saying a good deal. A young fellow
  who can invent a dodge like that is certain to get on in the world, and I can
  give him a good start. Here is a golf ball. It is the one that you first put
  upon the last tee this morning. When I kicked it off the tee I replaced it
  with another. I know your secret, young man, and I congratulate you. Go up to
  the last tee in the morning, and drive that ball off in the way it should be
  driven, and when you see Miss Seddon at night ask for an interview with her
  uncle. Tell him you have your £500 a year all right, and, if he is
  incredulous, give him this letter. Now finish up your cigar, and be
  off."</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p class="first">At a quarter past nine the following night Frank Bruce was
  sitting in a secluded part of Mr. Seddon's grounds, and he was not alone. A
  pretty girl with dark eyes was by his side, and his arm was about her
  waist.</p>

  <p>"I expected your message last night," Mary said.</p>

  <p>"Well, I thought I had sent it," Bruce replied. "Mary, our little scheme
  has been found out. Mr. Chorsley took the marked ball, and substituted
  another for it."</p>

  <p>"And I saw you drive off, and when I picked the ball up it was quite
  clean," Mary said, "But surely Mr. Chorsley would never have been so
  ill-natured--"</p>

  <p>"Old Chorsley is a brick. And between ourselves, he would give a great
  deal to put a spoke in your uncle's wheel. On the whole we shall have no
  occasion to regret--"</p>

  <p>An acid voice breaking in on the lovers' sweet converse thought otherwise.
  The tall, thin man demanded to know why he had been deceived like this, to
  which Bruce coolly responded that there had been no deception whatever. There
  was a stipulation as to an income of £500 a year--</p>

  <p>"Which remains to be fulfilled," Seddon said, coldly.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps when you read this letter you will think otherwise," Bruce said.
  "It is intended for you."</p>

  <p>Seddon tore open the envelope contemptuously. His face changed as he read,
  and he bit his lip.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you are aware of the contents of this letter," he said with an
  effort. "But, of course you are. In it Mr. Chorsley informs me that he is
  going out of the firm of Chorsley and Martin, and that the present manager
  comes in. Therefore you are offered the managership, with good prospects at a
  salary of £600 a year."</p>

  <p>Bruce nodded coolly. But he was absolutely taken by surprise. All the same
  his enemy was utterly routed. He dropped the letter on the grass, and walked
  away with his hands behind him. Mary bent over her lover, and kissed him with
  delighted tears in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Do explain, Frank," she said, rapturously. "Do tell me how it
  happened."</p>

  <p>"When I've seen Chorsley," Bruce muttered, "but not before, because I'm
  hanged if I know."</p>

  <p>"Easiest thing in the world," Chorsley said, as he waved his cigar in
  front of him. "Why did you always slice it in the same direction? Why did you
  always get your ball off so clean? Because you were doing it on purpose.
  Again why? Because the object of your affection was near at hand. You wanted
  to signal to her. Then it occurred to me that if you wrote a message in blue
  pencil on a new golf ball, it wouldn't come out for some time. You do so, and
  you drive that ball into the brook, and Miss Seddon finds it. I got hold of a
  ball of yours, and I read the message making an appointment. By Jove, a
  splendid dodge--never heard of better. And so that's the way you managed your
  love affairs, eh. Well, If you can do so well with one thing you may do well
  with another, and that's why I gave you the chance of filling the new opening
  in our office. No, you need not thank me, I shall have a good servant, and I
  get even with Seddon at the same time. But there will be two things that I
  prophesy."</p>

  <p>"And what are those?" Bruce asked.</p>

  <p>"That you will miss no more drives on the last tee," Chorsley chuckled,
  "and that you will not be so prodigal with your 'rubbers' in the
  future."</p><br>

  <h3>ILLUSTRATED BY P.B. HICKLING</h3>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Strand Magazine</i>, May 1906</h3>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">THE little woman clung impulsively to Jim Stacey's hands as
  if they were buoys in a tempestuous sea and she drowning in the social gulf
  for want of a friend. And, indeed, Mrs. Arthur Lattimer was in a sorry case,
  as her pleading eyes would have told a less astute observer than her
  companion.</p>

  <p>As to the scene itself, it was set for comedy rather than tragedy. Down
  below a new Russian contralto was delighting the ears of Lady Trevor's
  guests; the rooms were filled with all the best people; the little alcove
  where Stacey was sitting was a mass of fragrant Parma violets and cool,
  feathery ferns; the electric lights were demurely shaded; indeed, Lady Trevor
  always made a point of this discretion in her illuminations. There was no
  chance for the present of interruption, so that Stacey was in a position to
  listen to his companion's story without much fear of the inquisitive
  outsider. Gradually the look of terror began to fade from the grey eyes of
  Mrs. Arthur Lattimer.</p>

  <p>"My dear lady," Stacey said, in his most soothing tones, "I shall have to
  get you to tell it me all over again. You see, I have been out of town for
  the last two or three days, and only received your hurried note an hour ago.
  You will admit that stating a case is not your strong point."</p>

  <p>"What did I say?" Mrs. Lattimer asked. "I am half beside myself with
  trouble. Did I make it quite clear to you that I had lost the great Asturian
  emerald?"</p>

  <p>"I gathered that," Stacey said. "I am also under the impression that the
  emerald was stolen."</p>

  <p>"It was stolen, "Mrs. Lattimer affirmed. "I was wearing it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Wearing it?" Stacey echoed. "Surely that was a little indiscreet. But how
  came the Empress of Asturia's jewel in your possession at all?"</p>

  <p>"I had better explain, "Mrs. Lattimer went on. "As you know perfectly
  well, my husband is a dealer in precious stones. He is probably the greatest
  man in this line in Europe. You are also aware that the Empress of Asturia is
  in London at the present moment. She has a fancy to try to match that
  priceless stone; in fact, if possible, she wants two more like it. She came
  very quietly to our house in Mount Street and saw my husband on the subject.
  Of course, he held out little hope of being able to execute the commission,
  but he said that he had heard of a couple of likely stones in Venice, and
  that, if Her Majesty would leave the emerald with him, he would see what he
  could do. To make a long story short the stone was left with him, and up to
  three or four days ago was locked away in his safe&mdash;a small safe that he
  keeps in his study."</p>

  <p>"Lattimer showed you the stone, of course?"</p>

  <p>"I have my husband pretty well in hand," Mrs. Lattimer laughed. "He showed
  me the emerald the next day, and a sudden fancy to wear it came over me with
  irresistible force. It was no great matter for me to get possession of the
  key of the safe. My husband was away, too, for a night, and on Monday evening
  I went to a bridge party at Rutland House, wearing the emerald as a pin. I
  was just a little frightened to find my borrowed gem so greatly admired. We
  were having supper about twelve o'clock&mdash;a sort of informal affair at a
  sideboard in the drawing-room&mdash;and I was induced to hand the stone
  round. Without thinking, I unscrewed it from the pin and stood there laughing
  and chatting keeping my eyes open all the same."</p>

  <p>"Knowing something of the kind of woman who is a professional
  bridge-player?" Stacey laughed.</p>

  <p>"Precisely," Mrs. Lattimer said. "There were one or two present whom I
  would not trust very far. Well, in some extraordinary way the stone was lost.
  Nobody seemed to know where it was; nobody would confess to having taken it.
  I am afraid I lost my head for the moment. I know I said a few hard things;
  but there it is&mdash;that stone is gone, and unless I can recover it by
  midday to-morrow I am ruined, absolutely ruined."</p>

  <p>"Your husband?" Stacey hinted.</p>

  <p>"Knows nothing. I have not dared to tell him. I have waited till the last
  possible moment on chance of the stone being recovered. You see, I stole the
  key of the safe and made my husband believe that he had lost it. It is a
  wonderful safe of American make, and no one in London can unpick it. My
  husband telegraphed to New York to the makers to send a man over, and he
  arrives by the <i>Celtic</i> to-night. Unless the stone can be found
  first&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Stacey nodded sympathetically. He quite appreciated the desperate
  condition of affairs.</p>

  <p>"I see," he said, thoughtfully. "If the stone turns up, you will contrive
  to find the lost key and restore the gem to its hiding-place. And now I must
  ask you if you suspect anybody."</p>

  <p>The pretty little woman flushed slightly. She glanced about her as if
  afraid that the Parma violets might become the avenue that leads up to a
  libel action.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she whispered. "It is Mrs. Aubrey Beard."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" Stacey muttered. "So the wind sets in that quarter. My dear lady,
  this is a serious thing. Mrs. Aubrey Beard has a high reputation. She is the
  wife of a Cabinet Minister, and, so far as I know, has none of the society
  vices&mdash;"</p>

  <p><a id="pic2"
     name="pic2"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1300951h-images/TheTwoBonbons1.jpg"
         title="My dear lady, this is a serious thing.">
  </div>

  <p>"Oh, hasn't she?" Mrs. Lattimer sneered. "Why, that woman is one of the
  most inveterate gamblers in London. It is an open secret that her bridge
  debts amount to over five thousand pounds&mdash;at least, they did last
  night, and I haven't heard that they were paid to&mdash;day. But this seems
  to be news to you?"</p>

  <p>"Well, yes," Stacey admitted. "If Beard knew this there would be a
  separation. Now tell me, what grounds have you for making this
  accusation?"</p>

  <p>"My dear Mr. Stacey, I am making no accusation whatever. I am merely
  telling you whom I suspect. To begin with, Mrs. Beard hardly touched the
  stone at all, though I could see her eyes flash strangely when she saw me
  wearing it. I have very little doubt that she guessed my little deception.
  You will remember that Mr. Aubrey Beard was in the Diplomatic Service at the
  Asturian capital, and that his wife would have every opportunity of becoming
  acquainted with the Royal jewels. At any rate, she hardly touched the gem,
  and seemed a great deal more interested in a dish of chocolate bon-bons in
  front of her. She is passionately fond of sweets."</p>

  <p>"I suppose, practically, your supper consisted of that kind of thing?"
  Stacey asked. "Being no men present, you would naturally think very
  little&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, of course," Mrs. Lattimer said, airily. "We had very little else
  besides a few grapes and a sandwich or two. Mrs. Beard was nibbling at her
  chocolates up to the very time we left. It was then that she dropped a remark
  which aroused all my suspicions. She said she hoped that I should find my
  emerald again, and that if the Empress of Asturia was seen wearing one very
  like mine I should not accuse her of theft."</p>

  <p>"Really, now," Stacey said. "This is most interesting to a society
  novelist like myself. In other words, Mrs. Beard practically accused you of
  stealing the very thing that you charge her with appropriating. She let you
  know quite clearly that she guessed exactly what had happened. It was a hint
  to you that if you saw anything you would not dare to make it public. You
  have honoured me with a difficult problem to solve, and I have solved many.
  Mrs. Beard is a cleverer woman than I imagined; but suppose she has already
  disposed of the emerald?"</p>

  <p>"But she hasn't," Mrs Lattimer whispered, eagerly. "If she had done so,
  she would have paid her bridge debts. You know how necessary it is to
  discharge obligations of that kind. I feel quite sure that the emerald still
  remains in Mrs. Beard's possession."</p>

  <p>"Meaning that she has found no way of disposing of it?"</p>

  <p>"Not yet. I have had her carefully watched, and I have come to the
  conclusion that her cousin, Ralph Adamson, is in the conspiracy. Of course,
  you know he is a great admirer of Mrs. Beard's; there is nothing wrong, but I
  am certain that he would do anything for her. I know he was at her house for
  a long time the day before yesterday, and that he subsequently paid a hurried
  visit to Amsterdam, where, I understand, it is a fairly easy matter to
  dispose of stolen jewels. If he had been successful with his errand, Mrs.
  Beard's bridge debts would have been paid by now. But what is the use of our
  talking like this? You know the whole story; you can see the dreadful
  position I am in. Is there any possible way of getting me out of the
  difficulty before to-morrow afternoon?"</p>

  <p>"I have worked out some sort of a theme," Stacey said, thoughtfully. "Your
  letter was very incoherent, but now that I know all the facts I begin to feel
  sanguine. Tell me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I will tell you anything. Your very presence gives me courage. I see
  that you are going to ask me a question of the utmost importance. What is
  it?"</p>

  <p>"It is important," Stacey said, gravely. "I want you to try and remember
  exactly what sort of bon-bons Mrs. Beard was eating on the night that the
  robbery took place."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Lattimer laughed in a vexed kind of way.</p>

  <p>"What a frivolous creature you are!" she said. "As if a trivial thing like
  that could possibly matter."</p>

  <p>"My dear lady," Stacey said, in a deeply impressive manner, "the point is
  distinctly and emphatically precious. I pray of you not to speak at random.
  Was it not somewhere in the Far East that the accidental swallowing of a
  grape&mdash;stone changed the destinies of a nation? Think it out
  carefully."</p>

  <p>"You are a most extraordinary man," Mrs. Lattimer said, almost tearfully.
  "So far as I can recollect, the sweets in question were chocolate fondants
  filled with almond paste. Yes, I am quite sure that that is a fact, for I
  remember Mrs. Beard saying that almond paste was her favourite sweet."</p>

  <p>"We are getting on," Stacey said. "My education on the head of feminine
  gastronomy is somewhat limited, but I have a hazy kind of idea that these
  particular dainties are fairly large in size. They would be nearly as big as
  my thumb, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Quite that," Mrs. Lattimer said, gravely.</p>

  <p>"Ah! then your humble maker of romances is not to be baffled. My way lies
  clear before me. Now, one more question. Did I not understand from Lady
  Trevor that Mrs. Beard is going to put in an appearance here to-night?"</p>

  <p>"So I believe," Mrs. Lattimer replied.</p>

  <p>"She is giving a dinner to semi&mdash;Royalty and will not be here till
  comparatively late. I feel certain she will come, because I saw Ralph Adamson
  just now listening to the new contralto."</p>

  <p>Stacey rose gaily from his seat and fell to admiring the banks of violets
  with which the room was lined. He caught Mrs. Lattimer's reproachful eye and
  smiled.</p>

  <p>"<i>À la bonne heure</i>," he said. "Give yourself no further anxiety. The
  curtain is about to go up, the play will commence. If that emerald is still
  in the possession of Mrs. Aubrey Beard, I pledge you my word it shall be
  restored to you before you sleep to-night. Smile as you were wont to smile,
  and come with me."</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">THE great contralto had finished her song amidst the tepid
  applause which passes for enthusiasm in society, and for a moment the
  proceedings seemed to languish. In the great salon some two hundred of the
  chosen ones had gathered, waiting like children for someone to amuse them. A
  social entertainer followed, only to be received and dismissed in chilling
  silence, which it is to be hoped was somewhat compensated by the size of his
  cheque. Stacey came cheerfully forward and shook hands with his
  hostess.</p><br>

  <p><a id="pic3"
     name="pic3"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1300951h-images/TheTwoBonBons2.jpg"
         title="Stacey... shook hands with his hostess.">
  </div>

  <p>"I began to think you were going to throw me over," she said. "So awfully
  good of you to offer to come here and amuse these people. Upon my word,
  society nowadays is worse than a set of school-children. What should we do
  without our society entertainers? You have such clever ideas! Is it possible
  that you have a new sensation for us to-night?"</p>

  <p>Stacey intimated modestly that it was just on the cards. He noticed the
  reproachful way with which Mrs. Lattimer was regarding him. He sidled up to
  her presently.</p>

  <p>"It is all part of the system," he said.</p>

  <p>"Like Mr. Weller's reduced counsels. It is not when I smile that I am at
  my joyous zenith. I am here to-night exclusively on your business, and if I
  do play the clown there will be a good deal of the tragedian behind it. I
  promise you that there is a large percentage of method in my madness."</p>

  <p>There was a murmur among the languid audience, a kind of electric thrill
  which was in itself a compliment to Stacey. Apart from his literary fame, as
  an originator of novel and frivolous amusements he had a reputation all his
  own. There was a good score of men and women present who could have told
  stories of his marvels, and who could have risen up and called him blessed
  had it been discreet to do so. There were others present who looked upon Jim
  Stacey as a mere society scribbler and charlatan, but these only added
  piquancy to the situation.</p>

  <p>At the earnest request of Lady Trevor, Stacey proceeded to do a few simple
  experiments in the way of thought-reading. An immaculate youth, utterly bored
  and <i>blasé</i>, lounged up to him and remarked with casual insolence that
  he had seen this kind of thing just as well done, if not better, at a country
  fair. Stacey smiled indulgently.</p>

  <p>"I dare say," he said. "But, you see, I have apparently mistaken the
  intellectual level of a portion of my audience. If you like I will endeavour
  to read your thoughts, provided always that you can concentrate your mind
  long enough upon any given topic."</p>

  <p>"Tell me what is in my pocket, perhaps," the other said. "There is a
  challenge for you, Stacey."</p>

  <p>"Which I accept," Stacey said, promptly.</p>

  <p>"If anyone will blindfold me, I am prepared to give a strict account of
  the contents of Mr. Falconer's pockets, only he must promise me that he will
  think of nothing else during the whole of the experiment"</p>

  <p>There was a ripple and stir amongst the audience, a kaleidoscope whirled
  and flashed on many-coloured vestments, and a sea of white faces turned in
  Stacey's direction. One of the ladies present emerged from the foam of
  fashion and whipped a cambric handkerchief across Stacey's eyes. His victim
  stood a little way off, so that the performer could just touch the tips of
  his fingers. There was a long, tense silence before Stacey commenced to
  speak.</p>

  <p>"I begin to see," he said, in a thrilling voice, which began to carry
  conviction to a section of his audience. Whatever the man might have been, he
  certainly was a consummate actor.</p>

  <p>"I begin to see into some of the secrets of the typical gilded youth of
  our exclusive society. <i>Imprimis</i>, in the vest-pocket, a gold
  cigarette-case; the cigarette-case is set with diamonds and bears in one
  corner two initials which are certainly not the initials of the fortunate
  owner. Inside the case are three cigarettes and half-a-dozen visiting-cards,
  which also do not bear the impress of the carrier's autograph. If Mr.
  Falconer likes I will read out the names printed on those cards, beginning at
  the bottom and working backwards to the top. The first card is that of a
  lady&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Here, I have had enough of this," Falconer burst out in some confusion.
  "I don't know who has been playing this trick upon me, but I consider it
  anything but good form, don't you know."</p>

  <p>A ripple of laughter ran over the sea of eager faces as Falconer backed
  away from the table, his face a healthier and rosier red than it had been for
  some time past. Stacey's challenge to his victim to complete the experiment
  was met with a direct negative.</p>

  <p>"Then you won't go on?" Stacey said, in his most insinuating manner. "Pity
  to break it off just at the interesting stage, don't you think? I was just
  about to tell your friends the story of that cheque in your
  waistcoat-pocket&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Something like a cry of dismay broke from the unhappy Falconer, and the
  brilliant red of his face turned to a ghastly white. As he slipped away,
  Stacey turned to the audience and inquired if anybody else there would like
  to try the same experiment. Quite a little knot of men came forward.</p>

  <p>"Cannot I induce some of the ladies to give me a chance?" Stacey pleaded.
  "It seems to me manifestly unfair&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Fortunately for us we have no pockets," Lady Trevor cried. "We keep all
  those things in our conscience. Positively, we shall have to send Mr. Stacey
  to Coventry if he does not hold his wonderful powers a little more in hand. I
  dare say there are men present who are so marvellously honourable and
  pure-minded that they have nothing to disclose. If there are any such here,
  let them come forward for Mr. Stacey to experiment upon."</p>

  <p>"My dear Ada, what would be the use of that?" a frisky dowager shrieked at
  the top of her voice. "We don't want to sit here and listen to the simple
  annals of the good young man who died, so to speak. Won't someone kindly come
  forward&mdash;somebody with a terrible past&mdash;&mdash;and let Mr. Stacey
  reveal the scandal for us?"</p>

  <p>A frivolous laugh followed this suggestion, and somebody maliciously
  suggested that the speaker herself might afford information for many piquant
  revelations. A tall, military-looking man came forward and suggested a new
  variation of the interesting <i>séance</i>.</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't it be much better," he said, "if we changed possessions with one
  another and gave Mr. Stacey a chance of guessing who the different articles
  belong to?"</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't it be better," another man remarked, "to drop all this nonsense
  and proceed to something more rational? After all said and done, if Mr.
  Stacey can do this, he can forecast where things are hidden at a
  distance."</p>

  <p>"Of course I can," Stacey said, with cheerful assurance. "Would you like
  to try me? Will somebody be good enough to give me a sheet of paper and
  envelope? I should prefer to have Lady Trevor's own letter-paper, so that
  there could be no suggestion of confederacy in the business. Will anybody
  come forward and write a note for me&mdash;&mdash;only just a few words?"</p>

  <p>As Stacey spoke he glanced significantly at Mrs. Lattimer, and indicated
  the man who was standing by her side. She seemed to understand by instinct
  exactly what he meant, for as the paper and envelope came along she snatched
  eagerly for it and placed it in the hands of the man by her side.</p>

  <p>"You do it, Mr. Adamson," she said. "We can always trust you, because you
  are so cool and clear-headed, and if there is anything wrong you can easily
  detect it."</p>

  <p>The tall young man with the dark eyes and waxed moustache shrugged his
  shoulders and smiled. Someone pushed forward a small table, on which stood an
  inkstand and a pen. The would-be writer gave Stacey a supercilious glance,
  and intimated that he was ready to begin.</p>

  <p>"That is very good of you," Stacey said.</p>

  <p>"Just a few words. Write&mdash;'It is not safe where it is. Bring it with
  you to-night.' No; there is nothing more. Lady Trevor, will you be good
  enough to hand me that little silver basket of sweetmeats which I see on the
  china cabinet behind you? All I want now is a small box&mdash;a cardboard
  box, about four inches square."</p>

  <p>The whole audience was following the experiment breathlessly by now. It
  was almost pathetic to see the childlike way with which they gaped at Stacey.
  They watched him with breathless interest as he folded the note and placed it
  in the cardboard box. Then he very carefully picked out a chocolate fondant
  from the silver basket of sweetmeats and gravely placed it inside the
  box.</p>

  <p>"This particular confection is not exactly what I wanted," he said, with
  the greatest possible solemnity. "I should have preferred a fondant tilled
  with almond paste. This I imagine to be Russian cream, but no matter. I will
  now proceed to tie up the box and place a name upon it. I will ask Lady
  Trevor not to look at the name, but to get one of the footmen to take it to
  the house for which it is intended. That is all, for the present."</p>

  <p>Lady Trevor signalled to a passing servant and intimated that Stacey had
  best give the box into his custody direct.</p>

  <p>"You are to go at once," she said, "and deliver this package at the
  address written on the outside; but perhaps Mr. Stacey would prefer that you
  placed it direct into the hands of the person for whom it is intended?"</p>

  <p>"That was the idea, "Stacey said. "I shall have to crave your patience for
  half an hour or so, and, meanwhile, I shall be only too pleased to show you
  another form of entertainment. Before doing that I should like to have
  something in the way of supper and a cigarette. Surely Mr. Adamson is not
  going! Oh, come, seeing that you are part and parcel of my experiment I
  really cannot permit you to go in this way. Come along with me as far as the
  supper-room and join me in a glass of champagne and a cigarette."</p>

  <p>Adamson turned and Stacey took him in a friendly way by the arm. Once in
  the hall the latter's manner changed and his face had grown stern. His eyes
  were hard and brilliant.</p>

  <p>"Not yet, my friend," he said. "There are many things I can do, and many
  things I know which would astonish you if I were disposed to betray the
  secrets of the prison-house. If you are discreet and silent all will be well,
  but if you elect to defy me&mdash;well, there are certain episodes connected
  with a period of your life which would be just as well&mdash;"</p><br>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">THE supper had been over for some little time, and most of
  the guests who were not playing bridge or otherwise frivolously engaged had
  gathered in the salon intent upon seeing the sequel to Stacey's experiment.
  Mrs. Lattimer sat there with flushed cheeks and glittering eyes. The
  suggestion of the military-looking guest that an interchange of pockets
  should be made had been carried out. If this had been intended, as doubtless
  it was, to give Stacey a fall, it had been a long way from being
  successful.</p>

  <p>He had snatched the handkerchief from his eyes and was just getting
  accustomed to the glare of the room when his glance met that of Mrs.
  Lattimer. She turned her head swiftly in the direction of the doorway, where
  stood a handsome woman, whose cold, beautiful face was watching somewhat
  critically the scene in front of her. It did not need a second look on
  Stacey's part to recognise Mrs. Aubrey Beard. He could see, too, that under
  that cold surface something in the nature of a volcano was raging. He could
  see that cold, icy bosom heave tempestuously, for the diamonds on her breast
  flashed and trembled like streams of living fire. Stacey quickly turned and
  whispered something in the ear of Ralph Adamson. The latter seemed to
  hesitate a moment; then, with bent head and lips that trembled, disappeared
  slowly through a doorway leading towards the conservatories. In the same
  cold, stately way Mrs. Aubrey Beard came forward and languidly asked the
  source of all this amusement.</p>

  <p>Her glance at Stacey was icy enough&mdash;indeed, there was no love lost
  between them. It seemed hard to believe that this placid, emotionless
  creature could have been the reckless gambler that Mrs. Lattimer had
  proclaimed her.</p>

  <p>"Ridiculous," she said, in her stately way. "It is preposterous to believe
  that Mr. Stacey could do these things without the aid of a confederate."</p>

  <p>"Oh, they have their uses," Stacey said, airily. "For instance, I don't
  mind admitting now that some of this business to-night has been what I may be
  allowed to term a game of spoof. I have half-a-dozen friends here
  to&mdash;night who gave me all the information I wanted and acted as my
  lieutenants, and very well they did it, too, as you all must admit. But it is
  not all nonsense, as I am prepared to prove, if Mrs. Beard but challenged
  me."</p>

  <p>"Is it worth while?" the fair beauty sneered. "I don't think anybody would
  accuse me of being Mr. Stacey's confederate. If he can guess&mdash;for it
  could be no more than guesswork &mdash;what is in my pocket he is welcome to
  his triumph."</p>

  <p>Stacey's keen eyes blazed for a moment, then he resumed his normal
  expression. He asked for someone to blindfold him; he stood with the tips of
  his fingers touching the shoulders of his victim. The flesh, cold as it
  looked, seemed to burn under his touch.</p><br>

  <p><a id="pic5"
     name="pic5"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1300951h-images/TheTwoBonBons4.jpg"
         title="The tips of his fingers touching the shoulders of his victim">
  </div><br>

  <p>He could hear the quick indrawing of the woman's breath. Every nerve in
  her body was quivering.</p>

  <p>"I do not see much, "he said, in a dreamy kind of voice. "Nothing but a
  handkerchief in Mrs. Beard's corsage. But stop! There is a small object
  wrapped up in that handkerchief&mdash;a small cardboard box. I can see
  through that cardboard box now. Inside is an oblong object, brown and sweet
  to the taste; it is nothing more or less than a chocolate, an ordinary common
  chocolate filled with Russian cream; at least, I suppose it is filled
  with&mdash;Russian cream. Good heavens, some of you will remember&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Stacey paused abruptly and tore the handkerchief from his face. He seemed
  to be greatly moved by some overpowering emotion; he glanced almost with
  horror into the eyes of the cold, stately woman opposite. She had not moved,
  she had not changed, save for a burning spot on either cheek and a peculiar
  convulsive twitching of her lower lip.</p>

  <p>"This is more or less part of my experiment with the chocolate creams,"
  Stacey said. "You will remember that a chocolate cream was the simple object
  that I placed in the cardboard box which was to be dispatched to an address
  known only to mysel£ I was challenged to discover a certain object hidden
  somewhere at a distance, and in my own mind I decided where that object was
  and what it was. Presently I will show you. Meanwhile, I ask Mrs. Beard to
  admit that I have been absolutely successful, and to produce the small box
  which she has wrapped in her handkerchief.</p>

  <p>The speaker turned just for a moment and his eyes flashed a stern
  challenge into those of the woman opposite. Very slowly and reluctantly she
  placed her hand inside the bosom of her dress and produced a lace
  handkerchief in which lay the small cardboard box which Stacey had dispatched
  by hand of the footman. The breathless audience watched Stacey as he opened
  the box and took therefrom apparently the same bon-bon which he had placed in
  the receptacle some half-hour before.</p>

  <p>"I see you are all utterly mystified," he said. "Indeed, I am quite sure
  that Mrs. Beard is as mystified as the rest. Before successfully concluding
  my little comedy I should like to have a few words with Mrs. Beard alone. I
  flatter myself that Mrs. Beard is just as anxious for a few words with
  me."</p>

  <p>The woman bowed coldly. Not for an instant had she betrayed herself She
  led the way in the direction of the library, and once there Stacey closed the
  door. He wasted no time in words; he raised the chocolate fondant to the
  light and snapped it in two. From the inside there fell a wondrous green
  shining stone&mdash;none other than the famous emerald belonging to the
  Empress of Asturia. Stacey spoke no word: he stood there waiting for the
  inevitable explanation. Then Mrs. Beard began to speak.</p>

  <p>"You are a wonderful man," she said, hoarsely. Her breath came fast, as if
  she had been running far. "I stole that emerald the night of the bridge party
  at Rutland House. I managed to conceal it, without being seen, in that
  chocolate fondant. I had my bridge debts to pay; I dared not tell my husband.
  I pass before the world as a cold, unfeeling woman, but my love for my
  husband has hitherto been the one passion of my life. I will not ask you how
  you have discovered all these things, for you would not tell me if I did. You
  seem to have guessed that my cousin, Ralph Adamson, was in the conspiracy,
  and you are correct. By what means you tricked him into writing those lines
  to-night, and getting me to place myself red-handed in the lion's jaws, I
  cannot pretend to understand, but there is the emerald and here is my
  confession. I have said a great deal for a proud woman like myself; all I ask
  you to do is to make it as easy for me as you can. If there is any
  exposure&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My dear madam, it is entirely in your hands to say whether there will be
  exposure or not," Stacey explained. "If you leave it to me,I will show you
  the way out. Mrs. Lattimer came to me with the facts, and I carefully
  engineered this little comedy with a view to saving my fair friend's
  reputation and sparing you a humiliating scandal. Still, it was not fair of
  you to try and close Mrs. Lattimer's mouth by letting her know that you were
  aware to whom this magnificent stone really belongs. By doing so you thought
  to frighten her and place her in such a position that she dare not accuse you
  of the theft. What we have to do now is to go back to the salon and make the
  dramatic announcement that I have been entirely successful in the matter of
  my experiment. If you could smile a little I should be greatly obliged. Yes,
  that is better. Now let us pretend to be talking upon quite indifferent
  topics. Anything will do."</p>

  <p>There was a sudden hush in the conversation and a rustling of skirts as
  Stacey and Mrs Beard entered the salon. Mrs. Beard was smiling now; she
  beamed quite graciously upon her companion, though the brilliant red spots
  still burnt upon her cheeks like a stain.</p>

  <p>"You will all be glad to know that my experiment has been a perfect
  success," Stacey said. "I was challenged to-night to say where some object
  was which was hidden at a distance. It is an open secret to you all that a
  few nights ago Mrs. Lattimer lost a valuable emerald; it occurred to me that
  the finding of this stone would be a fine trial for me, and incidentally an
  exceedingly good advertisement. I cannot betray the secrets of the
  prison-house and tell you the inner significance of the bon-bons, for that
  would be revealing my occult science. Sufficient to say I divined the
  hiding-place of the missing stone. It was carried away quite by accident that
  night in a fold of Mrs. Aubrey Beard's dress. Perhaps she was coming here to
  bring it back; at least, I will not insult the lady by any other supposition.
  At any rate, here is the missing emerald. It may have been a case of mental
  telepathy; it was very strange that it should occur to Mrs. Beard to search
  the folds of that dress at the very moment when I turned my will-power in the
  direction of the hiding-place of the stone."</p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1300951h-images/TheTwoBonBons5.jpg"
         title="Here is the missing emerald.">
  </div><br>

  <p>Not a soul there but believed every word that Stacey uttered. His manner
  was complete and convincing. He turned towards Mrs. Lattimer and pressed the
  shining jewel into her hand.</p>

  <p>"Not a word," he whispered. "Take it all for granted. If there were not so
  many fools in the world I could not have carried this thing off as I have
  to-night. I will call upon you to-morrow and explain everything. Meanwhile,
  go up to Mrs. Beard and thank her. Gush at her&mdash;kiss her, if you are not
  afraid of being frozen. Above all, be discreet and silent."</p>

  <p>Stacey turned away and walked in the direction of the refreshment-room. He
  found Adamson there, moodily smoking.</p>

  <p>"The play is over," he said. "The comedy is accomplished, and you will
  understand that this is emphatically a case where the least that is said is
  the soonest that is mended."</p><br>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">THE men stood facing each other, the one quick and eager,
  sanguine as to his eyes behind gold-rimmed glasses, the other bent and
  twisted with the reflection of some great tragedy on his face. A clock
  somewhere lazily chimed the half past eleven.</p>

  <p>"What do I look like, Brownsden?" the twisted man asked hoarsely. "I know
  what a marvel you are in the indexing of the emotions. What do I look
  like?"</p>

  <p>"Like a man who has done something years ago and just been found out,
  Ramsay," the other said. "It is almost a new expression to me, though I did
  see it once before in South Africa. He was a well-to-do, prosperous man, long
  married, respected, his crime twenty years old. And he was expecting hourly
  arrest Strange how those old things come to light. Make no
  mistake&mdash;yours is the face of an honest man. And yet!"</p>

  <p>"Wonderful!" Ramsay muttered under his breath. "As a criminal
  psychologist, you have no equal in the world. It was your marvellous book on
  the ramifications of the criminal mind that first attracted you to me. And it
  was my privilege to do you some trifling service "</p>

  <p>"To save my life and my reputation. If only I had your scientific
  knowledge!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," Ramsay said impatiently. "If ever I found myself in trouble,
  you promised to come and help me. Hence my telegram this morning. Brownsden,
  I am in the deepest distress&mdash;nobody but you can save me. Look round
  you."</p>

  <p>The criminal specialist Brownsden looked around accordingly. Ramsay's
  dining-room in Upper Quadrant, Brighton, was an artistic one. It had
  evidently been furnished by a scholar and a man of taste. There was a
  marvellously carved oak sideboard, then a Queen Anne bookcase; a fireplace
  carved by Grindley Gibbons himself; the electric lights Were demurely shaded,
  only the flowers looked faded. The artistic reticence of it all struck the
  proper, soothing, refining chord.</p>

  <p>"All mine," Ramsay said almost fiercely. "Gathered together bit by bit,
  pieced like some perfect old mosaic. It has been the one delight in a hard
  and gloomy life. All the house is the same. And the name of Dr. Alfred Ramsay
  is becoming known. Then it is all kicked away by a sudden and unexpected
  tragedy. Sit down."</p>

  <p>Brownsden sat down obediently in a Cromwellian chair upholstered in
  speaking tapestry. It was his cue to get the other to talk. The deformed
  figure bobbed up and down over the soft red of the Persian carpet&mdash;words
  began to stream from him.</p>

  <p>"I have been here now for four years," he began. "It was a hard struggle
  at first, but I had only myself to keep, and I managed to pull through. Then
  my books began to sell, but I did not get many patients&mdash;not that they
  mattered much. I kept to myself, with the result that I know nobody, and
  nobody here knows me except by name and sight. Yet I was not unhappy. I was
  making money until a month ago, when a sudden attack of nervous sleeplessness
  warned me that I was going too far. I decided on a month's cycling in the
  country&mdash;it has been very pleasant this Easter&mdash;and I went.</p>

  <p>"A week before my departure it struck me as a good idea to let the house
  furnished, so I put an advertisement in the <i>Morning Post</i>. In reply I
  received a letter from a gentleman in London. I saw him by appointment,
  and&mdash;to make a long story short&mdash;he took the house for a month and
  paid the rent. Like me, my tenant was a man of the closet, an American, and
  he wanted a change. I was to leave the house just as it was, and my tenant
  would find his own servants. I gave my old housekeeper a holiday and started
  on my vacation.</p>

  <p>"At the end of three weeks I was quite myself again, and longing to be in
  harness once more. Two days ago I was rather pleased to get a telegram from
  my tenant, saying that he had been called back to the States again by urgent
  business, and that he was leaving at once. He had sent the key to my agents.
  I telegraphed to my agents to send for my old housekeeper and explain to her
  what had happened, and to give her instructions to go home, saying that I
  would follow to-day. All this seems very bald, but I have not finished
  yet.</p>

  <p>"I came back to-day, expecting no evil. I opened the door with my
  latch-key and came in here. To my surprise, I found the place dirty, the fire
  out, the flowers left by my tenant still in the rooms as you see them. Now,
  this is all so unlike my housekeeper that I was vaguely alarmed. I looked all
  over the house, finding nobody, until I entered my study and laboratory,
  which is at the back here. That was half an hour before I sent you my wire.
  As you are a man with no nerves, I will show you what I found. Come this
  way."</p>

  <p>Brownsden rose and followed without a word. The laboratory and library had
  evidently been an artist's studio at one time &mdash;a large room with a
  dome-glazed roof. There was no carpet on the floor, the electric lights had
  not been turned on yet, so that Brownsden almost stumbled over some soft
  object that lay at his feet. He started back as the room suddenly flooded
  from the great arc light overhead and his eyes met the object on the floor.
  It was the body of an old woman in a neat black dress. Her silver hair was
  dabbled with blood; the scalp had been laid half open by a blow from some
  sharp instrument; the gnarled, knotted, hard-working hands were vigorously
  clenched. With an appearance of callousness, Brownsden bent over the
  body.</p>

  <p>"This is your unfortunate housekeeper?" he asked. "How long has she been
  dead?"</p>

  <p>Ramsay controlled himself with an effort; perhaps his companion's manner
  restrained him.</p>

  <p>"I have not dared to. make a close examination," he said. "But there is
  little doubt that that brutal murder was committed between eighteen and
  twenty-four hours ago. Every symptom points to that being about the period of
  the crime."</p>

  <p>"You have not discovered anything in the way of a clue, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>Ramsay replied that he had not done so; in fact, he had not looked for
  anything of the kind. He had been too stunned at his discovery to be able to
  do anything logical. As soon as he had pulled himself together, he had
  stepped out and despatched his telegram to Brownsden.</p>

  <p>"One more question," the latter said, "and that is an important one, as
  you will admit. Don't you think that it is a serious omission not to call in
  the police?"</p>

  <p>"Well, yes," Ramsay said slowly, as if the words were being dragged from
  him. "Of course, I thought of that. A man like myself, who knows nobody, and
  who could not give anything very satisfactory in the way of a personal
  reference... But seeing that the crime is a day old "</p>

  <p>"What does that matter?" Brownsden asked somewhat impatiently. "Of course,
  your hands are clean enough; one has only to look at the radiation of your
  eye-pupils to see that. But what with fools of officials and irresponsible
  cheap journalism--"</p>

  <p>"I know, I know. But I wanted to have your views first. I could easily say
  that I got home at a later hour than was actually the truth; that you came
  with me--"</p>

  <p>The old, strange terror was stealing over the man again, and Brownsden's
  manner changed. He was in the presence of no common fear; no ordinary case
  was here, he thought.</p>

  <p>"All of which would be very unwise," he said. "Suppose somebody saw you
  come in? I dare say you rode from the station on your cycle? You did? Of
  course, you can get out of it by saying that you had no occasion to enter
  your study till a little time later. Also you would account for not seeing
  your housekeeper by the suggestion that she had mistaken your instructions.
  When did your tenant leave?"</p>

  <p>"My tenant left at the time stated, or Mrs. Gannett would not be back at
  all. You need not speculate on my tenant, Brownsden. He was a man of
  standing; indeed, I met him to discuss terms, so he made the appointment at
  the American Legation in London. You may be sure that he does not count as a
  card in the game."</p>

  <p>"Then we can rule that out," Brownsden muttered as he bent down to examine
  the body. "But one thing is quite certain&mdash;we must lose no time in
  sending for the police now. Hallo!"</p>

  <p>The speech was broken off by the sharp intaking of the breath. As Ramsay
  drew near, he saw that Brownsden was gently opening the left hand of the
  murdered woman. A sharp edge of metal had caught his eye. Very gently he drew
  three coins from the knotted fingers, three half-crowns that seemed to be
  fresh from the Mint. On the face of it there was nothing unusual in their
  discovery, save that the suggestion that the murderer might have been
  fighting for some such small gain as that, for human life before now has been
  held more cheap. But there was a further discovery under the keen eye of
  Brownsden that gave the thing a deeper significance.</p>

  <p>"This is very strange," he said, as he moved towards a shaded lamp on the
  table close by. "Here we have three brand new coins taken from the poor
  creature's hand, the bloom of the mould is still on them. Three perfect
  half-crowns with the head of Queen Victoria upon them. New coins fresh from
  the Mint, with the late Queen's head on them, and dated 1899!"</p><br>

  <p><a id="pic7"
     name="pic7"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1300951h-images/TheMidnightCall1.jpg"
         title="'This is very strange.'">
  </div><br>

  <p>"Ring them," Ramsay burst out in a hoarse cry; "ring them!"</p>

  <p>Brownsden proceeded to do so. But the coins rang true and clear&mdash;even
  the test by weight failed to prove them anything but perfect. Ramsay wiped
  his damp forehead and sighed in a kind of a subdued way. Brownsden's face was
  still corrugated in a frown.</p>

  <p>"I don't understand it at all," he said. "These are genuine silver
  half-crowns, with never so much as a scratch on them, and yet dated nearly
  four years ago. Unless-- Ramsay, what kind of woman was your housekeeper? I
  mean as regards temperament."</p>

  <p>"Hot-tempered and obstinate," Ramsay explained. "Inclined to have her own
  way. Very literal, too. You see, she had a lot of Scotch blood in her."</p>

  <p>"I see. If anybody had come to her after your tenant had gone, to fetch
  some forgotten thing, she would not have given it without proof of the
  messenger's veracity, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Indeed she wouldn't, not if it had been an empty sardine-tin."</p>

  <p>"Um, that is quite what I expected. There is a pretty problem here, and I
  am already beginning to see my way clear. Your tenant departed in a breakneck
  hurry. Let us assume for the sake of argument that there was some pressing
  need for this. He either forgets something in his hurry, and somebody else
  who comes along is after the same thing. He tries to persuade your old
  housekeeper Gannett to part with that something, and she refuses. Hence the
  crime."</p>

  <p>Ramsay nodded in a vague, unconcerned kind of way. Already Brownsden was
  on the way to the telephone that hung in a distant corner.</p>

  <p>"The police," he explained tentatively. "There must be no hesitation any
  longer. You see--"</p>

  <p>At the same moment the purring ripple of the telephone-bell rang out.
  Ramsay pulled himself together with an effort and took down the receiver.
  When he replaced the instrument, there was a particularly sickly green smile
  on his face.</p>

  <p>"You ring up the police and explain for me," he said. "I have to go out at
  once. It appears that the East Sussex Hospital people are at their wits' ends
  for a surgeon for a case that came in half an hour ago. I must step round. Do
  you mind? I begin to wish I had never written that book on brain
  troubles."</p>

  <p>Brownsden averred that he did not mind in the least. It was good to Ramsay
  to feel the fresh air on his face again. The house-surgeon apologised
  profoundly&mdash;he knew that Dr. Ramsay did not take cases like this as a
  rule; but operation-surgeons that were up to the particular case like this
  were few in Brighton, and unfortunately it had been impossible to get anyone
  of them on the telephone. It was a case of a motor accident. The gentleman
  had been driving his own car and in some way had come to grief. There was no
  wound to be seen, nothing to account for the deathlike trance in which the
  patient lay. Ramsay had forgotten his own troubles for the moment. He would
  be very pleased to see the patient at once.</p>

  <p>The patient lay like a corpse on the bed&mdash; to all appearance he was
  dead. Ramsay's examination was thorough. He turned with a half -smile to the
  house-surgeon.</p>

  <p>"No operation is necessary at all," he said. "There is nothing at all the
  matter with the brain. What the poor fellow is suffering from is paralysis of
  the spinal cord, due to the shock; I am prepared to stake my reputation upon
  it. An application of the battery will be all that is necessary. In three
  days your patient will be out again. Look here!"</p>

  <p>Ramsay raised the lid of the sufferer's right eye. As he did so, he
  checked an exclamation. In an eager way he raised the lid of the other eye,
  and a half-puzzled, half-relieved expression crossed his face.</p>

  <p>"You have run up against a stone wall?" the house-surgeon suggested.</p>

  <p>"Indeed I have not," Ramsay said quickly. "I fancied that I had recognised
  the patient, but I appear to be mistaken. Try the battery, and let me know
  the result. Not that I have the least doubt what it will be, The spinal
  column is not injured; it is merely in a state of suspense. You will not mind
  if I run away now? I have a very unpleasant task before me."</p>

  <p>Something like an hour had elapsed between the time that Ramsay had left
  Upper Quadrant and his return there. There were lights all over the house,
  and seated in the hall were two policemen, who sat stolidly nursing their
  helmets on their knees.</p>

  <p>Inspector Swann was in the study, and he had many questions to ask. So far
  as Ramsay could see, very few of them were to the point. But to the relief of
  the doctor, no questions were put as to the time when the body was found in
  the house when the police were sent for. The inspector was puzzled over the
  matter of the half-crowns, which were apparently genuine. Brownsden stood
  alone, smiling grimly as Ramsay answered the flood of questions poured over
  him.</p>

  <p>"And now as to this tenant of yours, sir," Swann said. "When did he go
  away?"</p>

  <p>"Probably the day before yesterday," Ramsay replied. "He sent the key to
  my agents, as you will find on inquiry at their offices; otherwise Mrs.
  Gannett could not have made ber way into the house&mdash;I am quite sure that
  you will find that she called at my agents' offices and got the key. If you
  expect to discover anything in that direction, you will be disappointed. But
  perhaps I had better give you the letter which opened negotiations&mdash;I
  mean the first letter my tenant wrote to me."</p>

  <p>Swann nodded approval. All the time a couple of detectives in private
  clothes were making a thorough search of the house. There was a long French
  window at the back of the study, leading into a square yard, and here a man
  was looking with the aid of a lantern. He tapped on the ground, and a hollow
  sound rang out. Swann's sharp ears caught the clang.</p>

  <p>"What's that?" he asked. "Have you any well or anything of that kind?"</p>

  <p>"Only the inspection-chamber," Ramsay said carelessly. "You could hardly
  expect--"</p>

  <p>Something between a snarl and a cough came from the detective outside. He
  pulled up the cover of the chamber and dragged out a square box. It seemed to
  be heavy, for he staggered with the weight of it as he carried it into the
  study. Swann looked inquiringly at Ramsay, who shook his head&mdash;
  assuredly the box was no property of his.</p>

  <p>"This grows interesting," he said. "I have never seen that box before.
  What have you there, officer?"</p>

  <p>A box full of broken scraps of white metal, a box full of plaster moulds
  and files, and chemicals of various kinds, some iron discs, and a press were
  handed out, until the whole contents stood confessed upon the table. The
  detective grinned and wiped his heated forehead. "The finest coining-plant
  I've seen, sir," he said; " and I've had some experience, too. Never saw
  anything so perfect in my life. What shall we do with it, sir?"</p>

  <p>Swann was of opinion that a cab had better be called, and the stuff
  carried away. He took his own departure a little later, with the suggestion
  that nothing further could be done to-night. He carefully locked up the study
  and sealed it. He hinted that there was a deeper mystery here than met the
  eye; he would come again in the morning. Ramsay closed the door behind him
  and then staggered like a drunken man into the dining-room. With a shaking
  hand he poured himself out some brandy.</p>

  <p>"There is more here than meets the eye," Brownsden quoted from Swann
  significantly. "You asked me to come down and help you. If you will confide
  in me--"</p>

  <p>"I am going to," Ramsay broke out hoarsely. "I am going to do so. But it
  is far worse than I anticipated. You spoke a while ago of a man in Africa who
  lived cleanly for years, and yet whose past rose up against him at a time
  when&mdash;my God! it is my own case all over."</p>

  <p>"If you will confide in me," Brownsden repeated, " I dare say that "</p>

  <p>"I am going to confide in you," Ramsay whispered. "Great Heavens! the
  ghastliness of it! For I have served my time&mdash;three years for
  counterfeit coining!"</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">"THERE you have it," Ramsay said, as Brownsden merely
  nodded. The half-defiant snarl in his voice was almost pathetic. "Here is my
  story in a nutshell. I am a gentleman by birth, by education, by instinct.
  Never mind what the temptation was&mdash;under the same circumstances I would
  do it again. After that I met with this accident, that has crippled me for
  life; but even that had its compensations, for it indirectly gave me a fresh
  start in life&mdash;under my proper name this time."</p>

  <p>"I fancy I see what you are afraid of," Brownsden said.</p>

  <p>"Of course you do. I am a solitary man; nobody knows anything about me. In
  any case, after the death of poor Gannett, my past would be dragged up. That
  is why I asked you to come here. But the thing is even more hideous than I
  imagined. The discovery of that coining-plant was a catastrophe that I did
  not anticipate. Questions will be asked. I shall be invited to clear myself.
  It is fortunate that owing to my accident that cursed Bertillon prison system
  cannot be applied to me. None of my old associates would recognise me. And
  yet the peril to my social and literary name is very great. Can you help me
  without&mdash;without--"</p>

  <p>"Letting your name be mentioned?" Brownsden said. "I fancy so. To-morrow
  you must do nothing and leave everything to me. I am going to London, and you
  must give me the name of the man who took your house. Be guided entirely by
  me and think of nothing but your hospital patient. Is it a bad case?"</p>

  <p>Ramsay replied that the case was not nearly so bad as it looked. His
  further services would hardly be required. He was more interested in the fact
  that the patient's one eye was a blue and the other brown than anything else.
  Brownsden smiled behind his cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Different-coloured eyes, with largish red veins in the whites?" he
  suggested. "Ah! you need not be surprised. I have made eyes my study as much
  as anything else, and I have noticed that that peculiarity is common when the
  eyes are of different colour. Now you had better go to bed. And mind, you are
  entirely in my hands."</p>

  <p>Ramsay gave the desired assurance. He was utterly tired and worn out, and
  he slept far into the next day. Brownsden seemed equal to the occasion, for
  he managed to get breakfast of sorts; and he volunteered the statement that
  he had been out since daylight. Pulling a blind back, Ramsay could see a
  couple of policemen outside, moving along the idle crowd of curious loafers
  that collected there from time to time.</p>

  <p>"I suppose it is useless to ask if you have done anything?" Ramsay said
  moodily.</p>

  <p>"Well, I have," Brownsden said. "For instance, I am every minute expecting
  the cabman who drove your tenant, Mr. Walters, to the station from here. Of
  the two servants who were in the house, I can hear nothing, not even from the
  domestics next door. It appears they kept themselves to themselves very much
  indeed."</p>

  <p>The cabman came a little later with a little surprise in store. He had
  been called to Upper Quadrant two days before. He had been called by a grocer
  close by, who had been requested to send a cab from the rank near him by
  telephone from Upper Quadrant.</p>

  <p>"I presume you went to the station?" Brownsden asked.</p>

  <p>"No, I didn't, sir; I didn't go nowhere. I put two bags and a case that
  looked like one of them typewriters a-top of the cab, and I waited for the
  gentleman to come out. I hadn't any notion then what I was wanted for. Just
  as the gentleman got on the step, with his rug over his arm, a motor comes
  up&mdash;regular swagger affair--"</p>

  <p>"Stop a minute," Brownsden asked. "Did she look like a racer? Tell me how
  many men were inside and how they were dressed?"</p>

  <p>"She did look like a racer, sir," the cabman went on. "The gents inside
  had furs and goggles same as they most have on good cars... Recognise 'em
  again, sir? No, can't say as I could."</p>

  <p>"Excellent idea for disguise," Brownsden said half aloud. "Quick way for a
  man who wanted to get about the country. What happened after that?"</p>

  <p>"Well, a few words passed, sir, that I could not hear. Then the bags were
  transferred to the motor from my cab, and I was told that I wasn't wanted. I
  got a couple o' bob for my trouble, and there was an end of the matter as far
  as I was concerned."</p>

  <p>Brownsden seemed to be satisfied with this explanation, but he vouchsafed
  no further information. He hurriedly turned over the pages of a
  time-table.</p>

  <p>"So far, so good," he said. "Now I am going to London. If you take my
  advice, you will not stir out of the house all day, because I may have to
  telephone or telegraph you. And don't forget that you are entirely in my
  hands."</p>

  <p>"I could not wish for a more capable man," Ramsay said gratefully.</p>

  <p>It was nearly five before the telephone rang out in the startled house,
  and by instinct Ramsay seemed to know that Brownsden was calling him from
  London. Brownsden's voice was low and clear, but there was a certain pleased
  ring about it that the listener liked.</p>

  <p>"That you, Ramsay?" the voice asked. "Very good. I'm calling you from an
  office in Hatton Garden where they deal in raw metals. Before you do anything
  else, call up the East Sussex Hospital and ask how your patient is. Don't go
  and see him in any case; even if they ask you to do so, make some excuse.
  Ring up the hospital now I'll wait."</p>

  <p>There was some little difficulty with the Exchange, owing to the main-line
  trunk connection, but the voice of the house-surgeon was heard at last. His
  information was a startling confirmation of Ramsay's diagnosis on the night
  before. The electrical treatment had acted like magic. The patient had so far
  recovered that he had insisted on leaving the hospital an hour before,
  though, of course, he was still very white and shaky. The main point was that
  he had gone off in a cab, presumedly to the Hotel Metropole.</p>

  <p>Brownsden heard all this subsequently with somethinglike a chuckle. He
  would like to know if the Hotel Metropole people had seen a guest arriving
  answering to the same description. An inquiry elicited the fact that the
  caravansary people had not.</p>

  <p>"All this is excellent," Brownsden called down the long wire. "I was quite
  right to turn my attention in the direction of your late tenant, Ramsay. The
  address that your letters went to was merely a place where communications may
  be addressed at a penny each, and where they are called for. The American
  Legation has known nobody by the name of Walters. The apparent puzzle that
  you met him there is quite easy. Any American subject can see the Ambassador
  by waiting long enough in the anteroom; and your man probably knew that,
  hence he fixed a certain time to meet you there. After he had seen you, he
  had only to slip away, telling the porter that he would call again. There is
  no doubt that you have been the victim of a gang of swindlers."</p>

  <p>Ramsay was of the same opinion. On the whole, it struck him that the
  counterfeiters had hit upon a most ingenious and original way of carrying out
  their work undisturbed. All they had to do was to secure some well-furnished
  house in a good locality and then go to work. Brighton was a large place, and
  the neighbours would not be too inquisitive; it was possible to live in
  Brighton for years and never know the name of your next-door tenants. There
  was only one thing that really troubled Ramsay&mdash;had those people by any
  chance got an inkling of his past? Or was it merely coincidence?</p>

  <p>Brownsden came down by the last train, apparently satisfied with his day's
  work.</p>

  <p>"It's all right," he said. "I am delighted. If the police have only kept
  their discovery as to the coining-plant to themselves, everything will work
  out splendidly. But I fear that I shall put you to a little inconvenience
  to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"Anything so long as you solve the mystery," Kamsay cried. "What do you
  propose to do?"</p>

  <p>"Well," Brownsden said slowly, as he flicked the ashes from his cigarette,
  "I am going to have you arrested for the wilful murder of Martha
  Gannett!"</p><br>

         title="'I am going to have you arrested.'">
  </div><br>

  <p>Ramsay stared open-mouthed at the speaker. His face had grown a shade
  paler. He walked up and down the room as if he were the sport of uncontrolled
  emotions.</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">THE arrest of Alfred Ramsay the following morning on a
  charge of wilful murder of Martha Grannett caused a profound sensation. Not
  that the crowd overflowing out of the police-court at ten o'clock that day
  had much for their money. The police evidence was very brief and bald, not to
  say convincing, and after a hearing of a few minutes a remand was granted. A
  young advocate applied tentatively for bail for his client&mdash; the police
  had not even made out a <i>prima facie</i> case. After some discussion the
  magistrates agreed to allow bail in two sureties of £2,000 each, which was
  tantamount to a refusal.</p>

  <p>"I have not a single friend in the world," said Ramsay. "I will go to
  prison."</p>

  <p>"The bail will be forthcoming to-morrow," the lawyer said.</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p>It was quite dark the same evening when two figures approached Upper
  Quadrant from the road behind that leads to the Downs. They climbed carefully
  over the wall, and one of them admitted his companion to the house by way of
  the French window of the studio laboratory, which had been left open on
  purpose. The figures proceeded to pull up the cover of the inspection-chamber
  in the yard and deposit a black box within. After that they wrapped
  themselves up in long overcoats and lay on the floor of the study. It was
  evident that they expected a long vigil, for one slept whilst the other kept
  an eye open.</p>

  <p>It was past one before a slight noise in the yard attracted the watcher's
  attention. He reached out a hand and touched his companion, who immediately
  sat up.</p>

  <p>"They're moving," he whispered. "Get as near to the door as you can, and
  switch on the light when I give the signal. I knew they would come
  to-night."</p>

  <p>There was a sound of metal in the yard presently, and then the two
  watchers smiled. Then the gleam of a lantern flashed out, and a heavy
  footstep came into the room. Somebody was panting with the force of expended
  energy. Then the light showed the black box removed from the
  inspection-chamber by the police the night before, and just replaced by the
  two watchers in the greatcoats. The man pulling the box chuckled, but his
  chuckle changed to a snarl and an oath as another figure bounded out of the
  throat of the darkness and fell upon him.</p>

  <p>"You dog!" a voice said. "So I have got you, after all. You escaped me two
  days ago by means of that infernal motorcar of yours; but it's my turn now. I
  knew you'd come back for this."</p>

  <p>"I'll have a knife into you presently," the man underneath hissed.</p>

  <p>One of the watchers gave the signal, and the room was flooded with light.
  Just for an instant the two men fighting like mad dogs did not heed; then
  strong hands were laid upon them and they were wrenched apart. They stood up
  sullenly at length, with the cool, blue rim of a revolver-barrel pressed to
  the temples of each.</p>

  <p>"This is a pretty good haul, Mr. Brownsden, eh?" the second watcher said
  cheerfully. "No need to ask if you know me&mdash;Inspector Wallis, of
  Scotland Yard, at your service. I wondered what had become of you, Joe. And
  you, too, Pattison. So Joe had the best of you, and you had made up your mind
  to murder him. Afraid of him, ain't you, Joe?"</p>

  <p>The man addressed as Joe said something to the effect that his
  <i>soi-disant</i> colleague was a most murderous ruffian. The other burst out
  into imprecations.</p>

  <p><a id="pic10"
     name="pic10"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1300951h-images/TheMidnightCall4.jpg"
         title="The other burst out into imprecations.">
  </div><br>

  <p>"I'd have done it, too!" he cried. "Who found all the money? Who got that
  plant made? Nothing like it has ever been seen before. And because I had to
  keep out of the way for a bit, Joe leaves me in the lurch and comes down
  here. But somebody got me on his track again, and he'd ha' died here instead
  of that poor old woman if he hadn't got away in time."</p>

  <p>"It was you who killed the housekeeper, of course?" Wallis asked quite
  coolly.</p>

  <p>"It was an accident," the man addressed as Pattison said sullenly. "I knew
  that Joe hadn't got time to get the plant away, so I called for it as if I
  came from him. And there was that old girl playing with a mould that had been
  forgotten by my dear friend Joe in his hurry, to say nothing of leaving some
  of the new-milled half-crowns about. So one thing led to another, and I hit
  the old girl harder than I intended. But I've said quite enough."</p>

  <p>"Quite enough," Wallis replied grimly. "Go and fetch Dr. Ramsay in, Mr.
  Brownsden."</p>

  <p>A cab stood outside at the corner of the road, and in it was Ramsay. By
  the time that he reached the house, the handcuffs were on both prisoners.</p>

  <p>"I'll explain everything presently," Brownsden said hurriedly. "Will you
  look at this man, who seems to be known professionally as 'Joe'? Have you
  seen him before?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I have!" Ramsay cried. "I saw him under the name of Walters at
  the American Legation. It was he who took my house. I saw him also last night
  and the night before, at the East Sussex Hospital, where he had been taken
  after a motor accident. I should have recognised him before by the different
  colour of his eyes, but the pallor of illness makes a difference."</p>

  <p>"Do you remember the gentleman?" Brownsden asked of the man Joe. "Is his
  face familiar to you?"</p>

  <p>"Only once," the other man said with a shifty grill&mdash;" when I took
  his house. But what is the use of all these fool questions? It's a fair
  knock-out, and there's an end of it."</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p>It was a little later, and Ramsay and Brownsden were alone. For the first
  time for two days the former found zest in the food that Brownsden had
  prepared for him. When he had finished, he looked up eagerly and asked for an
  explanation. He was utterly puzzled, he said.</p>

  <p>"And yet it's pretty easy when it comes to be told," Brownsden said
  thoughtfully. "From the very first it seemed to me to be inevitable that your
  tenant had something to do with it. When we found that coining-plant, I was
  certain of it. You were the victim of an ingenious and up-to-date scheme. The
  idea of getting into a house like yours was admirable. I surmised from the
  first that Mr. 'Walters' was the coiner. When he went off in such a hurry, I
  felt quite sure that it was a case of diamond cut diamond. There is no such
  thing as honour amongst thieves. But you, personally, gave me a pretty clue
  when you spoke of the man in the hospital with the different-coloured eyes
  who had had a spill from a motor. Your tenant had eyes of two colours he had
  gone off hot-foot in a motor. Therefore it was only fair to assume that here
  was the man we wanted. Wallis compared my suspicions, and told me that he was
  looking for a man with different eyes, and he proceeded to tell me the
  history of the fellow he called Joe.</p>

  <p>"When I heard by the telephone that Mr. 'Joe' had left the hospital, I
  felt pretty certain that he would try and get that plant back. But you were
  in the way. That is why you were arrested, and bail for a preposterous amount
  fixed. I arranged to bail you out very late at night, so that not a soul
  outside the police-station should know. Therefore to Mr. 'Joe' the coast was
  quite clear, and he would rush to your house with impunity. You see, there
  was just the chance that you would get bail on the morrow, as your lawyer
  hinted, so there was no time to be lost. The task was rendered all the more
  easy by the fact that 'Joe' knew your house as well as you know it yourself.
  So he came for the spoil&mdash;which we replaced&mdash;and we caught him. The
  other man coming along was not quite the piece of luck that it looks, because
  there is no little doubt that he had been watching 'Joe' all day. The other
  man was rather bounced into confessing to the murder of the poor old woman;
  but it quite exonerates you."</p>

  <p>"Only I shall have to give evidence," Ramsay said. "And it is just
  possible--"</p>

  <p>"No, you will not be required. 'Joe' did not know you, because I asked him
  on purpose to see. Your fears are quite groundless, Ramsay, and I
  congratulate you on your escape. It would have been precious hard lines on
  you, after all these years, if--"</p>

  <p>"I cannot sufficiently thank you," Ramsay said in a broken voice. "Some
  day I may be in a position to show my gratitude for your wonderful skill and
  kindness. But there is one thing that puzzes me. When we tried the so-called
  counterfeit coins, they rang true. What does that mean?"</p>

  <p>Brownsden smiled as he took another cigarette.</p>

  <p>"They are true," he said. "They are made from genuine silver. It is
  possible to melt silver and yet get, cent for cent, profit on it over the
  counter. Gold can be treated the same way. The coins we found were not quite
  finished&mdash;they had not been sweated to give them the appearance of
  having been in circulation. See how simple it all is."</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes," Ramsay said. "And yet how simple it would have been to have
  fixed this on me if my past had come to light. Good night. And if any thanks
  of mine can--"</p><br>

  <h3>ILLUSTRATED BY T. WALTER WILSON</h3>

  <i>The Windsor Magazine</i>, London, Vol. XXIII, May 1906, pp 809-818<br>

  <p class="first">THE case was going dead against the prisoner; sanguine as he
  was, he could see that for himself. He was conscious of an odd feeling of
  unreality. For instance, it seemed almost absurd that those half-dozen
  portly, respectable, well-groomed gentlemen on the Bench should be trying
  him, when only a few days ago half of them had dined with him at The Towers.
  There was the chairman of the Bench, for example, General Owen Sexton. The
  General had regarded the dinner invitation as a favor. He had dined well, and
  had secured some valuable information as to a prospective investment into the
  bargain.</p>

  <p>The Bench seemed to feel it, too; for when they looked at the prisoner, it
  was with a half-apologetic glance, as who should say: "Really, it is no fault
  of ours, but rather the outcome of a wretched system." On the whole, the
  embarrassment was on the side of the Bench.</p>

  <p>Not so with the general public. It was not every day that the little
  Assize-town had such a treat as this. A millionaire, the great man of the
  district, charged with wilful murder! It seemed almost incredible that any
  body of men should dare to bring such an accusation against Wilfred Scanlaw.
  Why, the man could have bought up all Illchester and never felt it.</p>

  <p>And yet there it was, and the case was going badly for the prisoner. The
  stately butler from The Towers was telling the story. The deceased, who had
  been identified as one John Chagg, had called at The Towers on the night of
  March 15 and had asked to see Mr. Scanlaw. The butler had informed the late
  caller that his master never saw anybody on business after dinner, and that
  it was as much as his place was worth to disturb Mr. Scanlaw. When alone, Mr.
  Scanlaw invariably slept for an hour after dinner. It was an early house
  usually, and the servants were in bed by half-past ten. The stranger,
  however, had been very persistent. He had induced the butler to take his card
  into the library and place it where Mr. Scanlaw could see it when he woke. He
  would stay in the hall&mdash;he was in no hurry. It sounded just a little
  odd, but the servants went to bed leaving John Chagg still waiting to see the
  master of the house. Nobody thought any more of the matter; it had passed out
  of the mind of the butler until the body of John Chagg was found in the
  shrubbery at the back of the house late on the following day. The police had
  been called in, and they had made certain investigations. Questioned, Mr.
  Scanlaw denied that he had seen the deceased at all on the night in question;
  he denied that the man's features were known to him. If the butler's evidence
  had been correct, then Chagg must have grown tired of waiting and gone away.
  Was the front door open? the police desired to know. Yes, the front door had
  not been fastened, as Mr. Scanlaw noticed as he was going to bed; and on
  coming down in the morning he had blamed the servants for their
  inattention.</p>

  <p>This was all very well, but the awkward thing was the fact that the dead
  man had a letter in his pocket from Scanlaw &mdash; a curt letter in which
  Chagg was told that he could do as he liked, but not one penny of blackmail
  would be got from the writer. The body of the letter, the address on the
  envelope, were all in Scanlaw's handwriting.</p>

  <p>All this was pretty bad, but there was worse to follow. A big stick in the
  hallstand was found to be slightly stained with blood, so also was a shirt
  that had been found pushed at the back of the wardrobe in Mr. Scanlaw's
  bedroom. It was all very well for the jaunty, well-groomed London solicitor
  who had the case in hand to say that a perfect answer to the charge would be
  forthcoming. The lawyer in question, the well-known Edward Coxley, had
  shrugged his shoulders and promised to outline the career of the dead man
  later on, and prove that he was a particularly pestiferous type of
  blackmailer. There were even two sides to the denial of Chagg's identity by
  Mr. Scanlaw.</p>

  <p>And even this was not all. On the face of the dead man was a peculiar
  mark, an indentation, deep in the skull, that had evidently been the result
  of a severe blow. According to the theory of the prosecution, the mark had
  been caused by a ring that Scanlaw was in the habit of wearing, a cameo
  signet-ring with a very large, irregular-edged stone. If this ring had been
  produced, said the police, the stone would have fitted the mark. A heavy blow
  would have been required to make so deep and perfect an indentation; but the
  prisoner was a strong man, and the prosecution was prepared to prove now that
  Scanlaw in his early days in America had been closely connected with the
  prize-ring.</p>

  <p>Strangely enough, the ring was missing. The police had asked for it
  directly they had got an inkling of the manner in which the mark had been
  made, but they were met by an assertion on the part of the prisoner to the
  effect that the ring had been lost two days before, in the woods, where he
  had been rabbiting. All these things gradually piled up a case against the
  prisoner; already he was condemned by those in court.</p>

  <p>The case dragged on wearily till the light in the court began to fade, and
  people were beginning to leave, feeling that the sensations of the day were
  exhausted. The tense attention of the afternoon had relaxed; people chatted
  listlessly; only one man seemed to be deeply interested. He was a little man,
  with a clean-shaven face and the mobile mouth of the actor. His eyes gleamed
  and flickered; he constantly dried his moist palms on a pocket-handkerchief.
  Once his eyes met those of the prisoner, and Scanlaw felt that he would know
  that face again anywhere.</p>

  <p>The court adjourned at length, and Scanlaw stepped out of the box. Since
  he was before magistrates, and the case not yet proved, he had managed to
  procure bail. For the last two days he had walked out of the dock with his
  head erect and his mouth as hard as a steel trap; for the last two nights he
  had not gone home to The Towers, close by; rather, he had preferred to stay
  at the Crozier Hotel, and dine in the coffee-room before the eyes of all men.
  The little man with the clean-shaven mouth followed, dabbing his moist palms
  all the time.</p>

  <p>"I'll try it," he muttered. "It's a desperate chance, but I'll try it.
  Pity he had not gone home, and then I should have been in a position to see
  him as I am and save the cost of a dinner that I can ill afford. Lucky there
  is the wardrobe to fall back upon."</p>

  <p>At eight o'clock, Mr. Scanlaw sat down to dine in the coffee-room of the
  Crozier Hotel. Five minutes later, a clergyman with white hair came into the
  room and, as if quite casually, took his seat at the same table. Scanlaw
  frowned, but the man opposite did not heed. He ordered fish in a calm, bland,
  incisive manner that impresses even a waiter. He was half way through his
  fish before he addressed Scanlaw. He spoke in a low tone, and did not look at
  all at the man on the other side of the table. His speech was peculiar.</p>

  <p>"Would you give a thousand pounds to be out of your present difficulty?"
  he asked. "Don't stare at me like that. Go on with your dinner as if I had
  made a remark about the weather."</p>

         title="Don't stare at me like that.">
  </div><br>

  <p>The words were spoken calmly enough, and yet there was a suggestion of
  nervous, eager haste about them. In a strange, uneasy way, a spark of hope
  shot up in Scanlaw's breast.</p>

  <p>"You are either a lunatic or a very clever man," he said, "Mr.&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Call me Jones &mdash; the Reverend John Jones. What's in a name? The
  thing we call a rose &mdash; but I must drop shop for the present. You say I
  am either a lunatic or a very clever man. Please pay me the compliment of
  believing me to be the latter. I have been watching you all day."</p>

  <p>"Oh, then you are disguised, Mr. Jones." Scanlaw muttered. "I recognize
  you now. You are the little man who was rubbing his palms all the time.
  Seemed to be in trouble, too."</p>

  <p>"So I am," said the other, still bending over his fish. "Not as bad as
  yours, but bitter trouble, and possible disgrace, for want of a thousand
  pounds. That rascal Edward Coxley, your lawyer, is at the bottom of it all.
  He looks very smart and gentlemanly, but for all that he is one of the most
  poisonous scoundrels that ever disgraced a dishonorable profession. Because
  he is utterly unscrupulous, I suppose you decided to employ him."</p>

  <p>"Being innocent of the charge against me," Scanlaw began with dignity, "I
  must say&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Innocent be hanged!" the other man snapped. "You are as guilty as hell!
  You killed that blackmailing rascal as you would do again; and you will hang
  for it. If I am going to save your neck, there must be no foolish allusions
  between you and me."</p>

  <p>"For the sake of argument, we will admit that I killed John Chagg," said
  Scanlaw hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"That's better. Nobody can hear us, so I can talk freely. Before I leave
  here tonight, I am going to give you a written lot of questions and answers
  that you are to commit to memory before you sleep. Early to-morrow you had
  better show those questions to your lawyer, and suggest that he should put
  the questions and that you should answer them &mdash; in the witness-box. All
  this does not tally with the most honorable procedure of the court; but
  Coxley will not hesitate, the blackguard!"</p>

  <p>"But what are you doing this for?" Scanlaw asked.</p>

  <p>"A thousand pounds," was the prompt reply. "If I succeed, as I anticipate,
  you pay me that sum of money. As I am an actor &mdash; and I should have been
  a great actor but for the drink &mdash; you need not fear that my side of the
  thing will fail. I want that missing ring."</p>

  <p>Scanlaw looked doubtfully at the speaker. Visions of a police trap rose to
  his mind. If this man was an enemy in disguise, he was giving away a piece of
  evidence that would hang him to a certainty. The other seemed to read
  Scanlaw's mind, for he smiled.</p>

  <p>"I can quite see what is passing in your brain," he said. "But if you
  don't trust me, I can do nothing for you. If my plot fails through lack of
  confidence on my part, you will hang. Besides, you have tacitly admitted to
  me that you are the culprit. If you had been an innocent man, you would not
  have suffered my impertinence, but have got up and flung me through the
  window."</p>

  <p>The voice of the speaker was nervous and shaky, but the words were cool
  enough. The clear logic was not lost on a well-endowed mind like
  Scanlaw's.</p>

  <p>"The ring is in my waistcoat pocket at the present moment," he said.</p>

  <p>"I am glad to hear it," the other answered. "I began to be afraid that it
  had been lost. It is so like your mingled prudence and audacity to carry that
  damning piece of evidence within arm's length of the police. Hand it over to
  me, please."</p>

  <p>Wondering at his own confidence in a complete stranger, Scanlaw did as
  requested. His sanguine temperament and bull-dog courage had kept him up for
  the time, but there were minutes, like flashes of lightning before sightless
  eyes, when he realized the terrible gravity of his position.</p>

  <p>"You are going to take a terrible risk," he said.</p>

  <p>"Of course I am. Did I not tell you that I was in dire need of a thousand
  pounds? I would sell my soul for that money. I would take any hazard under
  the sun for it. You trust me, and I am going to trust you. No papers shall
  pass between us; and when you walk out of the dock a free man &mdash; as you
  will to-morrow &mdash; you shall pay me that sum in gold and notes. No; I am
  a bit of a rascal, but I have not fallen as low as blackmailing yet; and
  after that you will never hear from me again. But there is one little
  point."</p>

  <p>"Let me hear it," Scanlaw said eagerly. He was becoming absurdly dependent
  upon this stranger. He began to feel quite an affection for him. "What do you
  want to know?"</p>

  <p>"I want to know if you keep a motor-car. I have built up everything on
  that?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I keep a motor-car; keep two, in fact. No modern millionaire is
  held to be complete and genuine without keeping a motor-car."</p>

  <p>The pseudo-parson rubbed his hands together in the old, nervous manner;
  yet his eyes gleamed.</p>

  <p>"Good!" he said. "As agent in advance for a popular company that shall be
  nameless, I have had a deal of experience with automobiles. Now, you must
  send a message to your chauffeur and get him out of the way for a couple of
  hours. Better still, change your mind and sleep at home to-night. Contrive to
  have the key left in your garage about nine o'clock to-night, and leave the
  rest to me. But, above all things, keep your chauffeur out of the way till
  after midnight. Have you got a full and proper grasp of that?"</p>

  <p>Scaniaw nodded. Usually he had a fine contempt for the intellect of other
  men, but he felt that he had met more than his match now. His pulses were
  beating a little faster, and a fine bead of perspiration stood on his
  forehead. Was he going to stand whitewashed in the eyes of his fellows once
  more? The sense of crime was not on his conscience at all &mdash; he had rid
  the world of a pestiferous reptile, and there was an end of the matter.</p>

  <p>"I will do exactly what you require," he said. "I'll get a cab here and go
  home. But before I do so, I should like to have some inkling of the method by
  which&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not one word," the pseudo-clergyman said fiercely. "My good man, that
  would be fatal. It would only make you nervous and restless. You would be
  continually looking for your cue, and then you would spoil everything. The
  great thing in this matter is spontaneosity. Take this sheet of paper, with
  the questions and answers on it, and commit it to memory. Only do as you are
  told, and I promise that you shall be a thousand pounds poorer to-morrow
  night."</p>

  <p>Scanlaw rose from the table and lighted a cigar. The coffee-room was empty
  by this time.</p>

  <p>"I am going home now," he said. "I have trusted everything to your hands.
  If there is some further deep conspiracy against me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He hesitated, and there was a threatening flash in his eyes. The man at
  the table, drinking his claret calmly and smoking a cigarette, smiled.</p>

  <p>"I am a well-connected man," he said. "There remain to me yet a few
  gentlemanly instincts. In the eyes of the law I am doing wrong. All the same,
  I can see no great crime in ridding the world of a blackmailer. Besides, I am
  in desperate need of money. I, too, am the victim of a conspiracy; and your
  rascally lawyer is going to share the plunder. I can see my way to save you,
  to put money in my purse, and spite Coxley at the same time. To get a man
  like that under one's thumb is a pleasant thing. Now go and muzzle your
  chauffeur, as arranged."</p>

  <p>Scanlaw walked quietly out and called a cab. A little time later he was at
  home, the old butler waiting his good pleasure. The butler was a well-paid
  servant, who deplored the grave condition of his master. He was too well paid
  to believe that Mr. Scanlaw would do anything of the kind.</p>

  <p>"I have changed my mind and come home for the night, Stephens," the
  millionaire said. "It was a little too public in the hotel; and, besides, I
  have recollected some important papers that I have to go into. When this
  ridiculous charge fails, to-morrow&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am glad to hear that, sir," Stephens said. "It always seemed to
  me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, Stephens, I understand. Get me some brandy and soda-water and
  my cigars. You had better go to bed at the usual time, as if nothing had
  happened. By the way, is Gailand in the house? If so, I want him to go to
  Ford by the last train and see Maylor for me about those bearings. If
  everything goes well to-morrow, I shall go for a tour up North. I think that
  is all I shall want to-night."</p>

  <p>The chauffeur came in obediently. The bearings had not come, he explained,
  a fact that Scanlaw was aware of before he asked the question. He seemed to
  be annoyed about something.</p>

  <p>"Then you must go and fetch them to-night," he said.</p>

  <p>"And come back here by an early train in the morning. Where are the keys
  of the motor-house?"</p>

  <p>Gailand had left them in his bedroom over the stables. He would fetch them
  if his master required them. But Scanlaw waved the suggestion aside &mdash;
  he did not explain to Gailand that he had a master-key of all the locks about
  the house and estate.</p>

  <p>"Never mind," he said. "It will do in the morning. Good night,
  Gailand."</p>

  <p>It was a good hour before Scanlaw had a grip of the questions and answers
  that the pseudo-clergyman had written out for him. Even then he had only a
  hazy idea of what was the drift of the whole thing. It was like listening to
  a brilliant conversation on the telephone, when one side of the talk only
  could be heard &mdash; like an acrostic with an important link missing.
  Scanlaw abandoned the idea of solving the jumble at length.</p>

  <p>He locked the paper carefully away and went outside in the silence of the
  night. His nerves were getting more frayed and ragged than he cared to admit;
  the dark silence was soothing. He passed onward to the back of the great
  house and alongside the new building where his two motor-cars were stored.
  One was all in pieces, as he knew, but the other was ready for use day and
  night &mdash; it was a whim of Scanlaw's.</p>

  <p>He looked inside with a feeling partly of relief, partly of bewilderment.
  The door of the house was wide open, and the big car was gone!</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>The chairman and his brother magistrates came into court with an
  expression that plainly told that they wished the thing well over. The strong
  case for the prosecution was complete; it only remained for Scanlaw to
  reserve his defence and be committed for trial. Once that was done, there
  would be an end to Scanlaw's bail; he would have to go to jail, which was a
  most unpleasant course to adopt toward a man who gave such excellent dinners.
  The prim little barrister who appeared for the Crown looked at Mr. Coxley,
  the smart Bow Street attorney, as if conscious of the great social gulf
  between them, and intimated that he had no more to say. Mr. Coxley would
  pursue the usual course?</p>

  <p>"Not on this occasion," Coxley said. "I propose to exercise the discretion
  vested in me and put my client in the box. I am adopting a most unusual
  course, I know; but I desire to save my client some weeks of anxiety and
  degradation. I shall try and prove the innocence of my client from his own
  story, and save the county the expense of an Assize trial."</p>

  <p>The audience thrilled; they felt that they were going to get something for
  their money, after all. Scanlaw stepped from the dock into the witness-box;
  his hard, square face was absolutely devoid of emotion. He looked almost
  defiantly at his own lawyer.</p>

  <p>"Let us go back to the night of the murder," Coxley said.</p>

  <p>"Did you see the deceased man on that occasion, sir? Did you give Chagg an
  interview?"</p>

  <p>"I did not," Scanlaw replied. "I did not, for the simple reason that I was
  not in the house between dinner and midnight."</p>

  <p><a id="pic14"
     name="pic14"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1300951h-images/TheOnusOfTheCharge4.jpg"
         title="'I did not,' Scanlaw replied">
  </div><br>

  <p>"We will get to that presently," Coxley went on. "The prosecution has made
  a great deal of the fact that you denied all knowledge of Chagg, when at the
  same time you had written a letter to him telling him to do his worst. Can
  you reconcile those statements?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing is easier," Scanlaw said slowly and distinctly. "I repeat that I
  never saw Chagg in my life. He wrote to me more than once, saying that he was
  in possession of certain papers, etc., relating to my past, and proposing
  that I should buy them for ten thousand pounds. He tried to see me, and I
  gave orders to have him kicked off the premises if he came again. Of course,
  I am speaking of my offices. Finally, I wrote the man the letter which was
  found in his pocket."</p>

  <p>"What he suggested as to your past was false?" said Coxley.</p>

  <p>"No, it was absolutely true," Scanlaw admitted with the greatest coolness.
  "My past is not altogether a blameless one &mdash; not that that has anything
  to do with the case. There are lots of people in America who could tell you a
  deal of my earlier life. Before Chagg came along, there was another man. I
  might have tried to buy his silence; only I felt that if I did so, others of
  the same gang would come along and try the same game."</p>

  <p>"You feel quite sure that Chagg was only one of a set of fellows
  who&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am certain of it, because I had had letters of the same kind
  before."</p>

  <p>"Quite so," Coxley said with a smile. "A conspiracy, in fact. It is just
  possible that Chagg, after leaving your house, met a confederate, they
  quarrelled, and-"</p>

  <p>"This is not a speech for the defence," the Crown representative said
  pithily. "If my learned friend will confine himself to the
  examination-in-chief "</p>

  <p>"My learned friend" bowed and apologized. But he had made his point, which
  was the chief object in view.</p>

  <p>"Let us get on," he said. "You say you were out all the evening. Please
  explain."</p>

  <p>"The explanation is quite easy," said Scanlaw. "As my butler told the
  Bench, it is my custom when alone to go to sleep after dinner. I am never
  disturbed; the servants go to bed at the proper time and leave me severely
  alone. If Chagg was in the house, I did not know it. Soon after dinner I took
  a coat with a big collar &mdash; for the night was cold &mdash; and went out.
  My chauffeur was away, unfortunately, so I had to take my motor out myself.
  Without saying a word to anybody, I drove my car to Illchester and went to
  the Mitre Hotel there."</p>

  <p>"Can you produce anybody to testify to that?" Coxley asked.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid not," Scanlaw went on. "You see, it was Illchester Fair
  &mdash; pleasure fair; the hotels were full, and the streets crowded with
  people who came to see the show. I was muffled up, and my hat over my eyes. I
  went there to see a stranger who, curiously enough, had written me a letter
  relating to Chagg. The writer of the letter was a stranger to me, and he
  seemed to have a grudge against Chagg. He said if I would see him, he would
  tell me enough to get Chagg ten years. The address was 'The Mitre,
  Illchester,' a house of no repute, which was why I did not desire to be seen
  there. Hence I kept my collar up."</p>

  <p>"This is getting very interesting," said Coxley. "You have kept that
  letter, of course."</p>

  <p>"No," Scanlaw said sharply. "I handed it to you yesterday."</p>

  <p>Coxley apologized and produced a letter from his papers. It was handed up
  to the Bench and passed from one magistrate to another. The letter was signed
  "ONE WHO KNOWS," the envelope, the date, the stamp, all appeared to be in
  perfect order.</p>

  <p>"No signature, as your Worships will notice," Coxley said smoothly. "You
  thought it better to go and see the man than make an appointment
  which&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I acted, as usual, on the spur of the moment," Scanlaw proceeded. "I
  rather suspected another form of the conspiracy. It seemed to me if I took
  the writer of the letter by surprise&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And did you take the writer of the letter by surprise?"</p>

  <p>"It was more or less mutual," said Scanlaw. "When I was going into the
  bar, a man accosted me and whispered my name. He did not give his, but
  suggested that he had written me a letter. The man in question looked like an
  actor in reduced circumstances."</p>

  <p>"One moment," Coxley interrupted. "If you went over on your motor, and the
  streets were crowded&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I left my motor on the outskirts of the town, close to Illchester Priory,
  in the ditch on the left-hand side; it seemed best to walk. I sat in the bar
  talking to my man for some time. He gave me a great deal of information about
  Chagg &mdash; what, I will tell the Bench if they like &mdash; not that it
  would be of any assistance to their Worships. I was there from ten till ten
  minutes to twelve."</p>

  <p>"After the house was closed?" a magistrate asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, sir," Scanlaw proceeded to explain. "Your Worships will recollect
  that during the three days of the Illchester Fair it is usual to extend the
  closing time till midnight."</p>

  <p>The magistrate nodded; he had quite forgotten that. Coxley wanted to know
  if anything unusual had happened. Scanlaw's voice grew a trifle more
  husky.</p>

  <p>"A very strange thing," he said. "The man I sat with knew a lot about me,
  because he, too, had passed a great deal of his time in America. A great deal
  has been made by the gentleman who appears for the Crown as to the mark on
  the forehead of the dead man Chagg, which mark, it is alleged, was made by my
  ring. My ring attracted the attention of the man in the bar at the 'Mitre,'
  and he told me that at one time it had belonged to his mother. He gave me the
  name of his mother, who had a second time married a man in America, who gave
  the ring to me."</p>

  <p>"Did your friend in the 'Mitre' bar examine the ring?" Coxley asked.</p>

  <p>"He did, he looked at it carefully. When we were talking, a man came in
  and had a hurried drink and passed out again. As he was going, my friend said
  it was Chagg. I got up on the spur of the moment and hurried after him. I was
  going to finish him off then and there. Unfortunately for me, a fight was
  going on outside, and the police intervened. Whilst I was in the press, the
  doors of the' Mitre' were closed, and I could not get back again."</p>

  <p>"All this is a matter of common knowledge in Illchester," Coxley said
  suavely.</p>

  <p>"Then I made up my mind to go home," Scanlaw resumed. "I went back home,
  and that is all I know of the matter. I did not worry about the ring, because
  I expected that my friend of the 'Mitre' bar would send it back to me."</p>

  <p>"You produce the gentleman of the 'Mitre' bar?" the Crown counsel
  said.</p>

  <p>"Not at present," Coxley was fain to admit. "But we are looking for him
  everywhere. He is agent in advance for a theatrical company, and therefore
  his work takes him into out-of-the-way places. He may not have heard of the
  case yet. If we can produce the gentleman in question, and his evidence is as
  my client states, then the prosecution falls to the ground."</p>

  <p>The legal representative of the Crown stated that it did. According to the
  medical evidence, the crime had been committed between the hours of ten and
  twelve; indeed, the murdered man's watch, which had been broken in the
  struggle, had stopped at 11.25, to be precise. At that time Scanlaw was
  attempting to prove that he was fifteen miles away.</p>

  <p>"Do you apply for an adjournment, Mr. Coxley?" the chairman asked.</p>

  <p>"I am not quite in a position to say, sir," Coxley replied. "But I am
  going to place a policeman in the box who will swear that he tracked the
  wheels of Mr. Scanlaw's motor-car from the stable to the ditch by the side of
  Illchester Priory, and back again. That test was made and proved this
  morning, though Mr. Scanlaw's chauffeur was strongly of opinion that the big
  Panhard had not been out of the stables for three days prior to and following
  the murder. To go further, the state of the motor and the lowness of the
  petrol prove that. Beyond doubt Mr. Scanlaw was along the road and in the
  motor at Illchester on the night of the murder."</p>

  <p>"But the murdered man was at Mr. Scanlaw's house?" the chairman
  suggested.</p>

  <p>"We are not going to deny it," Coxley exclaimed. "He probably got tired
  and went away. Incidentally he took with him from a case in the hall a fine
  collection of old gold coins. I suggest that these coins aroused the cupidity
  of some confederate waiting outside, which led to the murder. Of course, it
  seems to me that if we could track those coins&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A policeman stood up in court and held a handful of gold coins aloft. He
  had found them that very morning in a piece of tobacco paper, near to where
  the murder was committed. The packed spectators thrilled and rocked at the
  discovery. People there looked at Scanlaw's impassive face. The thin, hard
  features never changed a muscle.</p>

  <p>The stir and fret was at its height when a little man, with the suggestion
  of an actor about him, bustled in. He had an air of agitation and fussy
  impatience. He apologized to the Bench for his want of ceremony.</p>

  <p>"I have only just heard of this case, your Worships," he said. "My name is
  John Oliver. I am agent in advance for the Vestris Comedy Company. I am told
  that they are looking for me. I only heard of this case just now. But, seeing
  that Mr. Scanlaw was in my company on the night of the murder till nearly
  twelve o'clock, why&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hadn't the man better be sworn?" the Crown counsel said tartly.</p>

  <p>Mr. John Oliver wanted nothing better. He gave his evidence glibly, but to
  the point; in every respect he confirmed exactly what Scanlaw had said. The
  latter bent his head and covered his face with a handkerchief for a moment.
  He desired to hide the fierce delight in his eyes; he suppressed a strong
  desire to laugh and sing. As Coxley finished his questions, the little Crown
  lawyer shot up.</p>

  <p>"About that ring," he said. "I am prepared to believe all that you have
  said, though, on your own confession, you are not a man of the highest
  integrity; but I am curious about that ring. Why were you so prejudiced
  against Chagg?"</p>

  <p>"He was at one time a member of our company," Oliver said. "And a more
  thorough&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That will do. What did you do with the ring? That's the point."</p>

  <p>"Upon my word, I forget," the witness cried. "When I pointed out to Mr.
  Scanlaw the man I deemed to be Chagg, I had the ring in my hand. To be
  perfectly candid, I had been drinking a good deal that night and I was a
  little muddled. I distinctly remember laying down the ring somewhere. If
  &mdash; if I could only recollect!... I've got it! We were sitting by the
  fireplace in the 'Mitre.' It is an old oak fireplace, with a fine overmantel
  carved with figures in niches. I put the ring in one of the little niches on
  the left-hand side of the fireplace in a vague kind of way. I suppose I must
  have had another drink and forgotten all about it. It is not a showy ring,
  and the overmantel is very dirty, I recollect. Unless the housemaids have
  been extra busy&mdash;which is not very likely, seeing that there would be a
  deal of pressure of work at the Fair time&mdash;the ring is very likely to be
  exactly where I placed it."</p>

  <p>"We shall have to have an adjournment, after all," the chairman said.</p>

  <p>"Not the least occasion for anything of the kind, your Worships," said
  Coxley cheerfully. "I would suggest that Sergeant Braithwaite go over to the
  post-office and telephone to the police-station at Illchester, telling them
  exactly what has happened. In less than ten minutes we shall know whether the
  story is confirmed or not."</p>

  <p>The Bench nodded their approval of the suggestion. Excitement stood high;
  people were wiping their faces as if personally interested in the issue. Only
  the prisoner stood quite still and impassive all the time; he seemed to be
  the only one who took no interest in the proceedings. He gave the suggestion
  of regarding it all as a kind of farce, from which he was to be rescued by
  common sense and reason. The chairman on the Bench bent over and made some
  remark to him; possibly he was discounting the future and thinking of those
  little dinners. There was a general surging of bodies, a gasping of breath,
  as the sergeant of police came back into court, swelling with puffy
  importance.</p>

  <p>"It seems, your Worship," he said, "as the witness is correct in that
  statement of hisn. The ring has been found by one of the ladies in the bar of
  the 'Mitre,' and has been handed over to the police at Illchester. If
  necessary, a special messenger "</p>

  <p>"There is no necessity," the chairman said. "A full description of the
  ring has been in the hands of the Illchester police for some days, and they
  are perfectly well aware whether they have the proper ring or not. It seems
  quite natural that the pris&mdash; that Mr. Scanlaw should have forgotten his
  curious gem in that way, and that the witness should have left it on the
  mantelpiece. Do you propose to call any more witnesses, Mr. Coxley?"</p>

  <p>Coxley smiling indicated that he was perfectly satisfied to leave matters
  in the hands of a bench of magistrates so singularly luminous-minded and
  clear-headed. Perhaps his friend who appeared on behalf of the prosecutor had
  a few words to say.</p>

  <p>"I follow the same lead," the little barrister said politely. "I have no
  animus in the matter. I have simply to do my duty, and there is an end of it.
  The case has taken a totally unexpected turn in favor of the prisoner; and,
  so far as I can see, there is nothing more to be done besides look for the
  murderer of Chagg elsewhere." A loud murmur of applause followed the generous
  statement. The Bench put their heads together and whispered for a moment. Ten
  minutes later, and Scanlaw stepped out into the street a free man. An hour
  later, and he was lunching quietly at home with John Oliver opposite him. The
  door was closed, and the two men talked in whispers. From time to time Oliver
  fingered a thick pad of paper in his breast-pocket that crackled with a
  musical sound.</p>

  <p>"A little imagination of the playwright, my dear sir," he said, "and a
  little good luck. You see, I did happen to be in the bar of the'Mitre' that
  night with a mysterious stranger whose collar was turned up. He was a friend
  of mine who had done something wrong, and I was smuggling him away. The
  inspiration came to me like a flash when I heard your case tried the first
  day. Then I worked out all those questions and answers between your lawyer
  and yourself. If I had not known Coxley to be a perfectly unscrupulous
  rascal, I dared not have tried that on. My next game was to get your
  chauffeur out of the way and make that very pretty confirmatory evidence as
  to the visit to Illchester and the motor left in the ditch by the Priory.
  That touch about the missing case of coins from the hall was also a pretty
  one, I flatter myself. As to smuggling the ring to the mantelpiece, that was
  quite easy. I placed it there myself before a full bar of drunken farmers and
  the like who were in from the Fair. Then I brought your motor back and lay
  low to wait for developments. I fancy I timed my dramatic entrance very
  prettily indeed. But all the same, luck was dead on your
  side&mdash;everything played into my hands. What a magnificent situation for
  a play it would make!"</p>

  <p>"I trust the play will never be written," Scanlaw said hastily. "The mere
  hint of such a thing might mean ruin to me. You see the moral would
  be&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Oliver chuckled as he helped himself to more champagne and took a fresh
  cigarette. He had a very pleasant and full-flavored turn of humor.</p>

  <p>"The moral, my dear sir, is this," he said slyly. "That the average
  millionaire is always a lucky man, otherwise he would never be a millionaire.
  But there never was a luckier one than you."</p><br>

  <h3>ILLUSTRATED BY MAURICE GREIFFENHAGEN</h3>

  231-240</h3><br>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">THE extraordinary affair at 19 Grosvenor Gate, the town
  residence of the Duchess of Dumblane, occupied the public mind for at least
  three days&mdash;a remarkable testimony to the dramatic features of the case.
  The Duchess, as everybody knows, is a recognised leader of Society, very
  young and very pretty; also, according to her friends, who are capable of
  expressing an opinion, very foolish into the bargain. On the other hand, the
  Duke is a pillar of the Upper House, given to politics and striving to effect
  that economy which is necessary now with a nobleman who depends largely on
  his estates for his income.</p>

  <p>The affair is briefly told as follows. The Duchess had been dining at a
  certain house where Royalty was expected&mdash;a dull, decorous, very
  full-dress affair&mdash;and for the purpose she had procured the family
  diamonds from the bank where they were usually kept. After the State
  dinner-party was over, her Grace had returned home and given the gems into
  the custody of her maid, afterwards going to a "bridge"-party in Stratton
  Street. The maid was told that she could go to bed if she liked, as her
  mistress would be very late.</p>

  <p>At three o'clock the following morning, the Duchess returned home. The
  Duke was away in South Africa on some semi-political mission, so that the
  Duchess had the house to herself. According to her story, she had let herself
  into the house with a latch-key and had proceeded at once to her
  dressing-room.</p>

  <p>A dreadful spectacle awaited her there. Helena, the maid, lay on the
  floor, absolutely unconscious, and bleeding from a wound on the face and
  another on the neck. The place was in great disorder&mdash;evidently a severe
  struggle had taken place. Greatly alarmed, the Duchess summoned the servants
  to her assistance, and the police were called in.</p>

  <p>Helena was by no means so badly hurt as first appeared. Restored to
  consciousness, she had a queer, confused story to tell. She had put away her
  mistress's diamonds and had taken a book up which interested her.</p>

  <p>That was about one o'clock in the morning. She had fallen asleep in the
  dressing-room, but was suddenly aware of the fact that somebody was in the
  room. Before she could jump up, she was grasped from behind; she struggled
  and called out; she was conscious of two blows, and then she recollected no
  more.</p>

  <p>The natural inference was that the daring thief had come for the jewels.
  The thing had been carefully worked out by an expert gang, whom the police
  professed to know all about. Would the Duchess give them a minute list of the
  missing gems? And then came the most extraordinary part of the story. The
  jewels were not missing at all. The Duchess had gone through the cases, and
  they were all intact.</p>

  <p>Harold Resbie had read all about it in the <i>Daily Flash</i>. The
  exceedingly popular novelist and social favourite smiled to himself as he
  read the story. Time was when it had been just on the cards that the Duchess
  of Dumblane might become Mrs. Harold Resbie. But the Duke had come along, and
  Harold had accepted the inevitable. It was not to be expected that Miss
  Florence Vane would resist a chance like that.</p>

  <p>But that was two years ago, and Resbie had got over it by this time. He
  had so far got over it that he felt a little ashamed to think that he had
  ever given a serious thought to the pretty, silly, frivolous, and slightly
  selfish Duchess of Dumblane. They were still very good friends, as they had
  been for years; and when the little lady needed a tonic in the shape of a
  good scolding, she never sought it in vain at the hands of Harold Resbie.</p>

  <p>He was just back from Monte Carlo now, where he had been dallying with the
  plot of a new novel. For the third day in succession the <i>Daily Flash</i>
  squeezed a column out of the Dumblane mystery, as they called it. The Duchess
  would be certain to be very piquant and very dramatic on the situation, and
  Resbie had made up his mind to call on her. A little note from the lady in
  question, imploring him to come round, as she was in great trouble, decided
  Resbie's mind for him. He would drop into Grosvenor Gate about tea-time.</p>

  <p>The drawing-rooms were deserted as Resbie arrived. The Duchess, charmingly
  arrayed in a pink, silky wrap, awaited him. She could do no more than press
  the hand of the novelist and sink into a chair with a sigh of deep
  resignation. Four footmen contrived with great exertion to set out the tea,
  after which they retired, with strict injunctions to the effect that the
  Duchess was not at home to anybody.</p>

  <p>"What is the trouble about?" Resbie asked.</p>

  <p>"My dear Harold, don't you read the papers?" the Dnchess asked
  reproachfully. "Surely you know all about that most agitating affair
  which&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, you have forgotten that by this time, surely? Your nervous
  system&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't talk about nerves. I am a perfect wreck. When I think of that awful
  night&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But you haven't lost anything," Resbie said. "And as for nerves, that is
  all nonsense, thanks to the outdoor life you lived at the old Vicarage. If
  you had lost your jewels, for instance&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My dear Harold, that is exactly what has taken place."</p>

  <p>Resbie's manner changed&mdash;he became interested instead of cynical.</p>

         title=
         "Resbie's manner changed - he became interested instead of cynical.">
  </div><br>

  <p>"I don't understand. Of course, I read all about that mysterious outrage
  here. But you told the police that not so much as a finger-ring was
  missing."</p>

  <p>"So I did, Harold; but it was not true, all the same. A heap of stuff was
  left, but all the fine family diamonds were gone. I dared not say a word
  about it, because I knew that Dumblane would be furious. He gave me the keys
  of his safe, and he made me promise that whenever I wore the diamonds, I
  would see that they were locked up personally. But it seemed to be all right,
  and I was dreadfully late for my bridge-party the other night. So I just
  handed the diamonds to Helena and went off."</p>

  <p>"How long has Helena been in your service?" asked Resbie.</p>

  <p>"My dear Harold, how suspicious you are! Helena is an absolute treasure.
  Besides, she came to me with a splendid recommendation from the Marquise de
  Boishardy."</p>

  <p>"The Marquise being suspected of cheating at cards," said Resbie
  tentatively. "Lots of West End tradesmen are wondering where the Marquise has
  gone. This Helena&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Harold, I would stake my reputation on the probity of Helena."</p>

  <p>"Very well; we will not pursue the investigation in that direction. What
  do you want me to do?"</p>

  <p>"Really, I don't know," the Duchess said falteringly. "I confided in you
  because you are a novelist and have a strange gift for solving the workings
  of the human mind. Look how you prophesied that I should marry the Duke, even
  when you and I were practically engaged! I want you to take this case in hand
  and see if you can make anything of it. Of course, it's a dead secret "</p>

  <p>"Really! Now, how many of your bosom friends know the truth?"</p>

  <p>The Duchess was forced to admit that she had confided her story to a
  select few, but not more than twelve altogether. Those bosom friends were
  deeply interested. Resbie wanted to know if that was as far as things had
  gone at present.</p>

  <p>"Almost," the Duchess said, speaking with a certain hesitation. "I almost
  wish now that I had told the police everything. But that is not the strangest
  part of the affair. When I mentioned the matter to Irene Charteris, she
  advised me to go to one of those marvellous creatures who look into crystals
  and keep black page-boys."</p>

  <p>"So they did in the days of Queen Anne," Resbie said sarcastically. "You
  were to go and see this woman with a view to getting your diamonds back. If
  we read of these things in books, we laugh. Sane men and women consulting a
  vulgar charlatan who&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But she isn't," the Duchess exclaimed. "She really is marvellous. Why,
  she sent me her card the very day of my loss. When I saw her the day before
  yesterday&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"She told you that there had been telepathic sympathy between you,
  eh?"</p>

  <p>"My dear Harold, how did you know that?" the Duchess cried.</p>

  <p>Resbie felt inclined to abandon the case as hopeless. And yet cleverer
  people than her Grace had believed thoroughly in that senseless
  tomfoolery.</p>

  <p>"In the course of my profession I have met some of these people," he said.
  "This woman saw a possible chance of making money out of you. She gazed into
  the crystal and told you that you would get your gems back if you followed a
  certain course. Did she arrange for a <i>séance</i> at the house of that very
  foolish Mrs. Charteris, for instance?"</p>

  <p>"Harold, it was absolutely wonderful!" the Duche§s cried. "When I got that
  card, I had vague hopes that something would come of it. I told Irene
  Charteris everything. She said that there was nobody like Madame Lesterre. A
  <i>séance</i> was arranged for the same evening&mdash;there were about a
  dozen of us present, all my dearest friends. It was a long time before the
  spiritual influence came, but it did come at last. Madame Lesterre is a
  lovely woman."</p>

  <p>"They always are," Harold said cynically. "Otherwise they would never make
  salt."</p>

  <p>"I declare she was beautiful; her face was inspired. She said that she saw
  a certain box, fitted with jasper and gold, with initials in the enamel on
  the lid. At once I recognised that she was describing the Louis Seize
  writing-table in my boudoir. She said she could see a drawer in this thing
  filled with cotton wool, and on the cotton wool was a case of shabby leather.
  Inside this case there were things glittering like fire."</p>

  <p>"Well?" Resbie asked, interested in spite of himself, "and what happened
  then?"</p>

  <p>"Why, I came home. It was vague, but soothing. I opened that particular
  drawer in my writing-table, and there was the very case that Lesterre had
  seen in her vision. When I came to look inside it, I found the diamond collar
  with the clasp that Charles I. gave to the family."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to say it was the grand collar that everybody knows of?"
  Resbie cried.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely the same, Harold. Imagine my delight, imagine how cheerfully I
  paid Madame Lesterre's fee of a hundred guineas. In some marvellous way she
  had identified the thief in the crystal, and her will power had compelled the
  return of that collar."</p>

  <p>"Wasn't her will power equal to getting all the swag back?" Resbie asked
  with a touch of the usual cynicism.</p>

  <p>"No; I put that to Madame Lesterre. We have had two more of the
  <i>séances</i> since, and each time there has been a substantial result. Of
  course, those hundred-guinea fees are very trying, especially as I am so hard
  up just now. Of course, too, the story is sure to leak out when I have got
  all the gems back, and it will be the making of Lesterre. The thing will be
  in all the Society papers, and then she'll be able to charge what she
  likes."</p>

  <p>"The most amazing thing I ever heard of," Resbie murmured.</p>

  <p>"Yes, isn't it? Only I wish that it didn't cost such a lot of money. We're
  going to have a <i>séance</i> here to-morrow night, and quite lot of people
  are coming. They are all pledged to secrecy, of course. I hope they will find
  the tiara then&mdash;I'm very anxious about the tiara."</p>

  <p>Resbie opened his mouth as if to say something; then he seemed to think
  better of it. He switched off the conversation slightly.</p>

  <p>"I hope you will let me be one of the party," he suggested. "It's just
  possible that I may find a way of solving this wonderful mystery. But my
  selfishness causes me to forget the human side of the story. How is your
  maid?"</p>

  <p>"Helena? Oh, she is getting on very well indeed. The wounds are more or
  less superficial, and the girl has a wonderful fund of nervous energy. She
  laughs at her adventure already."</p>

  <p>"It's just possible that she is laughing at something else besides that,"
  Resbie said darkly. "Don't keep her tied up to the house too much."</p>

  <p>"My dear Harold, she was out the very next day. I wanted her to have
  assistance for the time, but she positively declined. Helena is a very
  remarkable girl."</p>

  <p>"So I should imagine. Now, I've got an idea about this thing. It is the
  kind of idea that would only occur to a novelist, and in itself it would make
  a pretty plot for a smart story. Whether my theory will be supported by facts
  remains to be seen. You say you have a <i>séance</i> here to-morrow night. I
  shall come, as you have asked me; but I am to have a free hand in the matter
  and ask what questions I like. Also I am to dine with you here beforehand at
  7.30. I flatter myself that I shall have a startling surprise in store for
  you."</p>

  <p>"Are you not going to tell me any more than that?" the Duchess asked.</p>

  <p>"Not a word," Resbie said firmly. "I don't want to have the whole thing
  spoilt at the start. Give me another cup of tea and let us talk about
  something else."</p>

  <p>It was an hour later that Resbie left Grosvenor Gate and made his way
  eastward. His first stopping-place was at the offices of a well-known firm of
  private detectives, and for a little time he was closeted with the head of
  the firm. He did not want much, he said&mdash;only two persons watched
  carefully for the next four-and-twenty hours. He must have a full report from
  the agent delivered in person at his chambers by seven o'clock the following
  evening.</p>

  <p>"There will be no difficulty about that," the inquiry agent said.
  "Anything more, sir?"</p>

  <p>"No, Yes, by Jove! there is I was nearly forgetting the most important
  thing. I want one of your ladies to call upon me about five to-morrow. She
  must have plenty of pluck and be ready for a dashing adventure which,
  however, will only last a few moments. She had better be in some kind of
  disguise. Can you manage that?"</p>

  <p>The head of the firm was understood to say that he could manage anything
  of the kind, and that it was merely a matter of money. Resbie went away %ell
  satisfied with his plans, so far as they had gone. There was only one other
  thing to do.</p>

  <p>"It's a pretty scheme," he told himself, "and worthy of the brain of any
  novelist. It's all theory on my part up to now, but I'm ready to bet any
  money that my theory is the correct one. A pretty plot, and the credulity of
  fools! But when you find level-headed business men and prominent journalists
  dabbling in this sort of thing, what can one expect from a mob of Society
  women whose brains are represented by the letter X. Hansom!"</p>

  <p>Resbie drove away to Bond Street, where he stopped at length and asked for
  Madame Lesterre. Madame was in, and she was at present disengaged. Resbie
  passed into the sacred chamber, furnished as such rooms always are. He saw a
  tall, graceful woman, with a sweet, sad face and dark, pathetic eyes. The
  face was right enough, he thought, but the mouth was thin, and the lines of
  it both greedy and ambitious.</p>

  <p>"You came here out of idle curiosity, Mr. Resbie," the woman said.</p>

  <p><a id="pic16"
     name="pic16"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1300951h-images/TheCharlatan2.jpg"
         title="'You came here out of idle curiosity.'">
  </div><br>

  <p>"That's perfectly true," Resbie said candidly, though be was a little
  moved by the swiftness of the woman's intuition. "And yet my curiosity is not
  idle. Fact is, I'm casting about for a plot for a new story; and as I was
  passing here, something came into my mind that may do. So I paid my two
  guineas at the door so that I could renew my acquaintance with this kind of
  atmosphere. I always find atmosphere is wonderfully stimulating to the
  imagination."</p>

  <p>"Then yau do not believe in this kind of thing?" Lesterre asked. "The
  psychological&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm not quite certain that I believe in anything," Resbie laughed. "Let
  me smoke a cigarette here and have a chat for a few minutes whilst I get my
  atmosphere. Really, I feel as if I were going to get very good value for my
  two guineas."</p>

  <p>Half an hour later, Resbie was back in his chambers again. He took a sheet
  of thick paper, and an envelope to match, and dictated a letter as follows to
  his secretary. There was no address to it, and no signature besides the
  initials&mdash;</p>

  <p class="letter">Dear Madame Lesterre,&mdash;</p>

  <p class="letter">I dare not sign my name, I dare not come and see you. I am
  in great distress. Will you help me? At nine o'clock to-morrow I shall be at
  the corner of Hilton Street, by the entrance to the Green Park. I hear you
  have a <i>séance</i> in Grosvenor Gate a little after that time. Will you ask
  your coachman to pull up at the spot I speak of, and I will tell you all I
  want to say through the window of your brougham. Don't fail; it is a matter
  of ten times your usual fee. Don't fail me. I.C.F.</p>

  <p>"Post that. Miss Maynard, please," Resbie chuckled, "and say nothing about
  it. If you are a good girl, I'll tell you the original plot and its sequence,
  if all goes well."</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p>What with police and pressmen and disinterested friends, the life of the
  Duchess was a burden to her. Also the excitement of the <i>séances</i> was
  getting on her nerves. She had a vague feeling that, piecemeal, she was going
  to recover the whole of her property; but, even then, the price she was
  paying for it was a high one. Also she was beginning to regret that she had
  taken certain friends into her confidence. She began to notice that people
  watched her suspiciously. A certain lady journalist had inserted a daring
  paragraph in a Society paper. To crown all, a leading official from Scotland
  Yard had inquired whether there were any truth in the persistent rumours that
  the stones had been stolen, after all.</p>

  <p>Therefore it was that her Grace welcomed Harold Resbie to dinner with
  effusion. She declared herself to be utterly bored to death; she was nervous
  and uneasy. Resbie said something soothing. He looked very calm and confident
  as he came into the drawing-room.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure some of those women have been talking," the Duchess said. "They
  all promised me most faithfully that they would not say anything to anybody.
  And yet people are actually hinting to me that for diplomatic reasons I am
  concealing the truth. A man who came from Scotland Yard to-day&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, so they are getting hold of the truth also?" Resbie asked.</p>

  <p>"It looks like it. Really, the number of falsehoods I have had to tell
  lately is enormous. And the daughter of a clergyman, too! If those people at
  Scotland Yard force me any further, I shall be really ill."</p>

  <p>There was no exaggeration here, as the novelist conld see. The Duchess of
  Dumblane looked anxious and worried; there were dark rings under her blue
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"You ought never to have kept the truth from Scotland Yard," Resbie said.
  "I have no doubt, had you wished it, they would have allowed the public to
  think that nothing was lost. As it is, you call them in to help you, and then
  you deliberately put them off the scent."</p>

  <p>"I don't see what difference that could make," said the innocent
  Duchess.</p>

  <p>"Why, it makes every difference, of course. It removes motive, for one
  thing; and it prevents the Yard people from looking for a confederate in the
  house. You may say what you like about your servants and their blameless
  integrity, but there was a confederate in the house.</p>

  <p>"Now, I have taken this thing in my hands, and I am going to work it my
  own way. Unless I am greatly mistaken, I shall have the pleasure of handing
  all your jewels back to you in the course of the evening; but I must do it my
  own way, or not at all. In the first instance, it is imperative that I should
  have a few words with your maid. Send her into your boudoir presently for
  something or another, and I will follow. I came half an hour before my time
  for this purpose. There is no time to lose."</p>

  <p>Resbie spoke sharply and sternly and in the voice of one who expects to be
  obeyed. A little later he strolled into the boudoir, where a pretty, dark
  girl with a vivacious face appeared to be looking for something. Resbie
  quietly closed the door behind him. There was not very much conversation, but
  it was mainly on the side of the novelist. All the same, the second gong for
  dinner rang before Resbie returned to the drawing-room.</p>

  <p>"I was beginning to get quite alarmed," the Duchess said. "I do hope you
  have not upset Helena. She is by far the best maid that I ever had. If she
  gives me notice&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, but she won't," Resbie said cheerfully. "One thing I can promise you
  with every confidence&mdash;if there is any notice given, it will come from
  you. Cheer up, your troubles are nearly over; you will sleep with an easy
  mind to-night. And now let us go into dinner. I shall not refer to the
  subject again."</p>

  <p>It was an exquisite little dinner, and Resbie enjoyed it thoroughly in his
  critical way. He looked upon a good dinner as a distinct addition to the joys
  of life. The wines were poems in their way, and the subsequent cigarette had
  a flavour of its own. Resbie looked at his watch presently.</p>

  <p>"We have been exactly an hour and a half over dinner," he said.</p>

  <p>"Have you found it too long?" the Duchess laughed. "Personally, I look
  upon the time seated over dinner as so much hideous waste. All this fussy
  cooking is lost on me. I should like to go back to the soup and locally
  killed chicken of the dear old Vicarage days."</p>

  <p>"No woman <i>can</i> dine," Resbie said thoughtfully. "It is an art that
  she never acquires. A bun and a glass of claret is what I saw a Princess dine
  off in Paris. What time do your people come?"</p>

  <p>The Duchess remarked that the <i>séance</i> was fixed for a quarter to
  ten. She had asked some dozen of her bosom friends to see the manifestations.
  She was getting very restless and nervous again, as Resbie noticed from
  behind the pungent blue haze of his cigarette-smoke. She wished that the
  whole thing were over.</p>

  <p>"Have half a glass of champagne," he said soothingly. "As you are never
  used to it, the wine will do you all the good in the world. I am glad to see
  that you keep your simple tastes. Drink that up and trust in me. I am not
  going to disappoint you."</p>

  <p>The Duchess and her visitor had barely reached the drawing-room before
  some of the guests began to arrive. They were a smart, level-looking lot, as
  Resbie was bound to confess, so that their credulity over the powers of
  Madame Lesterre was all the more amazing. There are many remarkable things in
  the <i>olla podrida</i> called Society, but nothing more amazing than the
  belief in the charlatan who looks into crystals and foretells the future.</p>

  <p>Resbie sternly repressed a desire to laugh at the whole thing, but he was
  not slow to see that the policy would be a mistaken one. The conversation
  turned on the occult. Madame Lesterre was a great favourite; but, on the
  other hand, there was a new star, in the shape of a mulatto, who was doing
  remarkable things. The atmosphere was false and meretricious, and Resbie
  began to long for a little fresh air.</p>

  <p>Yet, on the face of it, Madame Lesterre had performed a wonderful thing.
  When the story became public, as it was bound to do, her fortune would be
  made; in future, she could always charge pretty well anything for a
  consultation.</p>

  <p>Madame Lesterre was announced, and the audience fluttered respectfully to
  greet her. The dark face was a little pale, her eyes expressed both fear and
  indignation. She suffered herself to be led to a chair and surrounded by her
  admiring disciples.</p>

  <p>"Your work has been too much for you to-day, Madame?" the Duchess
  said.</p>

  <p>"My dear child, it is not that," Lesterre said, with a languid, insolent
  familiarity that roused Resbie to anger. If the woman had her deserts, she
  had been behind stone walls. "My friends, I have to-night been submitted to a
  most insufferable outrage. I received a note purporting to come from a client
  of mine who was in great trouble. I was to stop my brougham on my way
  here&mdash;give her a secret audience. I did so, and a woman in a veil looked
  into the window. Instantly she passed some pungent stuff on a handkerchief to
  my face, and I fainted. I could not call out, though I never quite lost my
  senses. I have a vague recollection of being searched, but fortunately for me
  I had left even my purse at home. Ornaments I never wear, as you good friends
  of mine are aware. Then the thief made off and was out of sight before I
  could recover my voice again. There is an experience for you!"</p>

  <p>"You will place the matter in the hands of the police?" somebody
  suggested.</p>

  <p>"No, I shall let it pass. The police say my methods are not legitimate,
  just as if I were a mere fortune-teller! We shall have the manifestations in
  here."</p>

  <p>"Why not in the library?" said Resbie. "It is more spacious and more
  sympathetic."</p>

  <p>Resbie's voice was low and level, so that nobody noticed the curious
  intonation of it except Madame Lesterre, who turned and looked at him
  sharply. Then she smiled, as one who recollects the face of a pleasant
  acquaintance. Resbie repeated his suggestion again.</p>

  <p>"The library is certainly a more comfortable room," the Duchess said. "The
  dark doors have&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, no!" Madame Lesterre cried. "In here, if you please! When I entered
  the house, I had no prejudices. But my temperament is a singular one and open
  to all kinds of passing influence. When I entered this room, I was in a state
  of nervous indignation. I was going to suggest that the manifestation be
  postponed to a future occasion. Then the charm of the room came over me, and
  my spirit was at rest. I feel that I am going to do great things
  to-night."</p>

  <p>Resbie said no more. He had gained his point, though the others did not
  know it. He stood in the background, as if he took no further interest in the
  proceedings. Madame produced her crystal from her pocket and placed it on a
  little table. After that, in a deep, impressive voice she asked to have the
  door locked. Not only did Resbie lock the door, but he took the key from the
  lock and placed it in his pocket.</p>

  <p>The lights were turned low, the manifestations had begun. For a long time
  the gazer looked into the glassy ball with a rapt attention. Her lips began
  to move, but no sound came from them; she grew rigid and stiff, she did not
  seem to breathe.</p>

  <p>"I see something misty," the words came at length. "I see a soldier, a
  great General, dressed in the fashion of a bygone day. I see Eastern palaces
  and the hurry of fight. I see men fall; then I see the soldier with a
  magnificent diamond cross in his hand. It is set in gold snakes."</p>

  <p>"Isn't it marvellous?" the Duchess whispered half-hysterically. "That is
  the Grand Cross that Lord George found at Delhi. Madame has never seen it,
  yet she describes it perfectly. She speaks again."</p>

  <p>The march was going on. She told what she could see. She saw the cross
  suspended in mid-air; she saw it fall to the ground, and there it was picked
  up by invisible hands and conveyed to a black vase with gold figures upon it.
  Behind the vase was a picture of a child asleep.</p>

  <p><a id="pic17"

         title="She told what she could see.">
  </div><br>

  <p>"The Ming Cup," the Duchess cried. "The Ming Cup, in the far corner
  yonder, with the picture by Rubens behind it. Mr. Resbie, will you see what
  is in the cup? I am too nervous to look. It is possible that the missing
  Cross&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The Duchess paused, unable to proceed any further. In a solemn, tense
  silence, Resbie crossed the room and lifted the cover from the priceless Ming
  Cup. He plunged his hand down until it touched some hard, brilliant surface.
  As he raised his hand again, and the electrics flashed up, a stream of fire,
  cross-shaped, struck the eyes of everybody.</p>

  <p>"It is the Cross surely enough," Resbie said quietly. He was the only one
  there who seemed to have kept his head. "Madame has been wonderfully
  successful. I suppose this is the marvellous gem that I have heard so much
  about. Pray do another one."</p>

  <p>But Madame Lesterre, half-fainting in a chair now, declined gently. The
  mental strain was too great; her poor frame could not stand two of these
  activities in one evening. Perhaps later on in the week, when she had
  recovered from the strain&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Resbie turned away and looked into the crystal. His gaze grew grim and
  intent. He began to mutter. Madame Lesterre turned to him with an indulgent
  smile.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Resbie is feeling the influence," she said. "The highly strung brain
  of the novelist will ever be a good one for the telepathic attraction. Do you
  see anything?"</p>

  <p>"I see many things," Resbie said. "For instance, I see a plant, a very
  pretty plant indeed&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Eh, what?" Madame said sharply. "Do you mean to suggest that? But go on,
  go on."</p>

  <p>"A plant," Resbie proceeded. "It grows rapidly and gives off seeds. One of
  these seeds bursts and turns into a bowl. It is like the great bowl with the
  Rose du Barri cover over there, on the top of the Chippendale cabinet. I dare
  not break the spell by going to look myself. But will somebody take off the
  cover and see what is inside? Unless I am greatly mistaken, it will be found
  to contain the Duchess's diamond tiara."</p>

  <p>Madame Lesterre had grown strangely still and white. One of the elect
  crossed the room and took something from the bowl. It gleamed and glittered
  as it found the light. There was no question what it was, as the Duchess's
  delighted scream testified.</p>

  <p>"I am getting on," Resbie said. "For a mere amateur, I am doing very well
  indeed. We need not go into details over the rest of the seeds, but keep
  strictly to business. Over there on the chimney-piece is an antique enamelled
  tea-caddy. If you will look inside there, somebody will find the necklace of
  pearls... Is that really so? Now please try that ginger-jar on the little
  pedestal... So that contains a breastplate of diamonds. As I am in form, and
  the strain not too much for me, I had better finish my innings. Try that
  Sheraton cabinet, under the big palm. Thank you... There, I fancy that is the
  lot. Really, I did not know that my powers were so wonderfully great."</p>

  <p>Nobody spoke for a long time; they were all too surprised. But on a table
  before the Duchess stood the whole of the missing property. Madame Lesterre
  had risen to her feet and was looking defiantly towards the door. One or two
  of the sharper guests were beginning to get a grip of the truth. Then Madame
  turned and held the handle of the door. She was not well&mdash;she must get
  home. Without saying farewell to anybody, she waited till the door was opened
  and Resbie was escorting her down the stairs.</p>

  <p>"I will see you off the premises," he said. "A wonderful manifestation,
  yours. It is a pity that you have made up your mind to leave England. I don't
  think I was misinformed when I heard that you were leaving for Paris
  to-morrow, with no intention of coming back to&mdash;er&mdash;practise
  here?"</p>

  <p>Madame accepted her defeat gracefully enough, and Resbie returned to the
  drawing-room. He sat down under a perfect stream of cross-questions. He
  proceeded to explain when the babel ceased.</p>

  <p>"It was quite an easy matter," he said. "When the Duchess told me, I
  regarded this as a put-up job between the maid Helena and somebody outside.
  When I saw the maid and recognised the fact that she was not in the least
  hurt, I felt certain of it. All that blood, etc., belonged to somebody else.
  I found the motive when I heard of that first manifestation. The whole thing
  had been schemed by Madame Lesterre, to give herself a unique advertisement.
  I worked the thing out like a story. The first thing I did was to set a watch
  on the maid Helena. I was not in the least surprised to find that she was in
  the habit of visiting Madame, nor was I surprised to find that Madame is her
  sister.</p>

  <p>"Then I was certain of my put-up job. Robbery was not the motive; a
  marvellous new advertisement was. Helena had only to arrange where to hide
  the different gems, and there you are. That is what the novelist found out.
  Gradually the gems would be discovered, and Madame would stand on a higher
  pinnacle than she had ever done before. To make sure, I had her searched
  to-night. I did not care to take any risks. When I came here to-night, I took
  the liberty of seeing Helena and asking her a few questions. She confirmed it
  all; she told me how the thing was planned for to-night. So I decided to have
  my little surprise too. I got all the jewels from Helena and gave her
  instructions where to hide them in this room. No, I was not afraid of her
  going back upon me, for I took care to tell her, which is a fact, that I had
  a detective waiting outside the house in case there was any treachery. I
  worked my little surprise, and you thought it was Madame Lesterre. Like the
  shrewd woman she is, she gave in at once. I am afraid that none of you ladies
  will ever see her again, as she departs for Paris to-morrow, with no
  intention of returning to England."</p><br>

     name="story7">7.&mdash;THE STRANGER WITHIN THE GATE</a></h2>

  <h3>Published in <i>The West Australian</i>, Perth, 24 Dec 1906</h3><br>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">The wind howled in the chimney so that the sparks from the
  wood fire raced upwards like millions of stars to meet the fury of the night.
  Then the gale was lulled for a moment, a strange white silence followed, and
  once again the rush of snowflakes on the windows.</p>

  <p>Hetty Dane drew closer to the fire and shivered slightly. She could find
  it in her heart to wish that all the girls were back at school now, though
  term time was by no means a primrose path for her. Yet it was so lonely in
  the great gaunt house that she would even have welcomed Miss Adela and Julia
  Grimshaw back to their own fireside again. But those austere ladies were not
  likely to return just yet. Indeed, so far as Hetty could see, their
  homecoming was likely to be postponed for some days, seeing that the snow had
  been falling steadily for twenty-four hours now; and there was a prospect
  before Hetty of passing an exceedingly solitary Christmas. The Misses
  Grimshaw had departed leaving many rigid instructions behind them. They had
  intimated to Hetty that, if the weather did not become more propitious, they
  would probably stay in Castleford and pass Christmas with a brother who lived
  there.</p>

  <p>Well, they would not return. Hetty had made up her mind on that point. As
  to the solitary Christmas, she cared little or nothing. There had been no
  festive season so far as she was concerned for some years past. Still, it was
  just a little unfortunate that the one servant remaining in the house should
  have sprained her ankle, and thus necessitated a stay in bed. Hetty would
  have to do all the work, but that she would not mind. She stood there before
  the fire, dreaming and wondering how many Christmases the old house had seen.
  It was a grand old place in its way, and at one time had been in the
  possession of an old county family, whose name was still remembered in the
  North. Doubtless, in times gone by, many a Yule log had blazed itself away
  upon that massive hearth, many a time had King Christmas held high revel
  there. Now it was all prim and bare, as befitted a ladies' school, cold and
  polished as the hearts of the two women who governed that select
  establishment.</p>

  <p>For some time Hetty stood there, until at length she became conscious of
  the fact that someone was knocking at the front door. It was a somewhat
  feeble knock, only half heard above the fury of the gale: and, just for a
  moment, it occurred to Hetty that she was mistaken. Then the knock came
  again, followed by a groan. Scared and startled, Hetty hastily crossed the
  hall, and threw the door open. Had not she done this, had she given herself
  time to hesitate, she would probably have been afraid to do anything of the
  kind. She forgot all her fears now, as she saw the figure of a man on his
  hands and knees in the deep snow which had collected on the doorstep. A
  furious blast of wind set the old house humming, and a fine powder of snow
  drifted across the polished boards. With sudden strength that quite
  astonished herself, Hetty dragged the man inside, and pushed the door to
  again. She had to fight against the strength of the gale before she
  succeeded. When she turned her attention towards the newcomer, she did not
  fail to notice how dreadfully pale and drawn his features were. There was an
  ugly cut on the forehead from which the blood was flowing freely.</p>

  <p>"You are badly hurt," Hetty said. "Sit down here, will you?"</p>

  <p>She pushed an armchair up to the fire, and the stranger literally fell
  into it, without uttering a word. He appeared to be absolutely dazed and
  overcome; for some moments it was evident that he had not the slightest idea
  where he was. Then, gradually, as the grateful heat of the fire restored him
  of something like life again, he turned to Hetty and smiled. It was a
  pleasant, frank smile, which gave an attractive expression to a countenance
  which was not exactly handsome, yet pleasing.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I am giving you a lot of trouble," he said. "The fact is, I
  was going on to Castleford for tomorrow, and our train got snowed up in a
  cutting. There was a bit of an accident, and that was how I came to be hurt.
  I believe nobody was damaged but myself, so that when the guard came and told
  us we could get no further, everybody turned out of the train and went off to
  find accommodation in the village. I suppose I was a bit too much knocked
  about to keep up with the rest. Any way, I lost touch with them, and when the
  last breath of the blizzard came on I might have been miles away from help
  for all I knew to the contrary. I saw your light here, and, more by good luck
  than anything else, I managed to reach the house. I am sorry to trouble
  you."</p>

  <p>"It is no trouble at all," Hetty said. "If you will sit here by the fire I
  will get some warm water to bathe your head. I daresay we can manage to make
  you comfortable for the night, but haven't you a bag or a portmanteau or
  something of that kind?"</p>

  <p>The stranger replied that he fancied he must have left it on the doorstep.
  And, sure enough, there it was when Hetty opened the door again. Before
  half-an-hour had passed her visitor was quite himself again. He seemed to
  have a wonderful faculty for obtaining information without asking questions,
  and before Hetty realised that she had told him anything, he knew all about
  the Misses Grimshaw, to say nothing of the unfortunate servant, and her
  sprained ankle. In a calm, assured sort of way, he took the situation in his
  own hands. He might have been master of the house.</p>

  <p>"This is a terrible dilemma," he said, with a smile. "It is my plain duty
  to take myself off at once, but I am not in the least inclined to do anything
  of the sort. I daresay I shall be able to find some sort of conveyance
  to-morrow. If you will be good enough to let me have two or three rugs I can
  make myself quite comfortable before the fire."</p>

  <p>Hetty rather demurred to this, but George Barton was quite firm. He would
  keep up the fire, he said, so that Hetty would not have to light it on the
  following morning. When she did come down next day, something in the way of a
  surprise greeted her. There was a roaring fire in the hall, another had been
  made up in the dining-room, and the kettle was boiling gaily, in the kitchen.
  Moreover, the breakfast things were laid, and on the old-fashioned hob by the
  dining-room fire stood a dish of fresh eggs and bacon, flanked by a pile of
  steaming buttered toast. With a gay smile Barton pointed to his
  handiwork.</p>

  <p>"I hope you don't mind," he said. "Of course, I know it is rather a
  liberty, but when I woke up this morning the fire was out and I was literally
  frozen. Then I thought of you and your damaged servant, and well, really,
  there was nothing else for it."</p>

  <p>Hetty laughed aloud, such a laugh as the old house had not heard for
  years. It never occurred to her that her companion was looking at her with
  frank admiration in his blue eyes. George Barton was enjoying the
  situation.</p>

  <p>"I daresay you wonder how I managed it," he said. "But, you see, I am used
  to this kind of thing. I have been a solitary man all my life, and for the
  last four or five years it has been a whim of mine to live in a tiny cottage,
  not far out of London, where I do everything myself. I do all my own
  housework and all my own cooking, though I daresay you would not approve of
  some of my methods. At any rate, this is done now, and I sincerely hope you
  will not think I have been taking a liberty."</p>

  <p>"Indeed, no," Hetty cried, warmly. "I think it is exceedingly kind and
  thoughtful. But don't you think&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It is a pity to let the breakfast get cold," Barton laughed. "Afterwards
  I can go and prospect round and see if I can find some avenue to the
  village."</p>

  <p>Barton came back presently with a sufficiently grave face and information
  to the effect that the snow round the house had drifted to a height of ten or
  fifteen feet, and that any attempt to get away was absolutely impossible.</p>

  <p>"I am really afraid you will have to put up with me for a day or two,"
  Barton said. "Of course it is very unpleasant for you."</p>

  <p>Hetty replied suitably enough, and so the day wore on. It was cold and
  clear outside, a severe frost having followed the snow. Strange, as the
  situation was, it was still stranger how quickly Hetty fell in with the new
  order of things. Before evening fell she seemed to have known Barton all her
  life. She could hardly bring herself to believe that he was the cold,
  reserved man he professed to be. And then, gradually, she told him the story
  of her life, how both her parents had died when she was young, and how she
  had drifted into her present surroundings.</p>

  <p>To all of this Barton listened with a quiet interest and sympathy, which
  Hetty felt to be very soothing. She was surprised at her own candour; she had
  no idea that she could talk so well and freely. And, on the other hand, she
  learnt a great deal about Barton, too. He chatted quite openly as they sat by
  the blazing fireside.</p>

  <p>"There really is a great affinity between us," he said. "'Is it not
  strange that two solitary people like ourselves should drift together in this
  way? To think that we should be sitting opposite each other like this,
  chattering just as if we had known one another for years. Don't you think
  this would make a very excellent short story?"</p>

  <p>"Do you know I have been thinking of that?" Hetty confessed. "I don't mind
  telling you that I am very fond of writing stories in my spare time. How
  glorious it would be to get a living that way and be independent of the
  Grimshaws for ever."</p>

  <p>Hetty's face was grave and thoughtful as she gazed into the fire. Barton
  watched the pretty profile admiringly. Hetty was all unconscious of his
  glance; her thoughts were very far away just then.</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately, many people have the same ambition," Barton said. "It is
  such a pleasant way of getting a living, and it looks so easy. I suppose your
  experience has been much the same as other people's?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose so," Hetty laughed. "Every story but one I have ever written
  has been rejected, and then the other day I read somewhere that the best
  thing to do is to write from one's own experience. And I did write a story
  from my own experience, and sent it to the editor of the 'Imperial Magazine.'
  I am sure it is the best thing I ever did, and I have great hopes of it;
  though, as yet, I have heard nothing from the editor I sent it to."</p>

  <p>"You wrote from your heart?" Barton asked.</p>

  <p>Hetty's face flushed slightly, but the eyes which she turned on her
  companion were quite calm and steadfast.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said. "I put it all on paper. At first I was ashamed to say too
  much, but then, gradually, it became so easy and spontaneous that I knew I
  had done something good. Oh, if the story were only a success! Oh, if I could
  only get away from here, and the hard and narrow life! Those women mean well,
  but they are so cold and unsympathetic. You cannot conceive what a difficult
  matter it would be for me to explain&mdash;Oh! I don't mean that."</p>

  <p>"I know exactly what you mean," Barton said. "You mean that my being in
  the house would place you in a cruel position. Believe me. I have thought of
  that, and I will set you straight. I would have gone away if I could, but you
  must see for yourself that such a thing is utterly impossible."</p>

  <p>Hetty's face flushed crimson. She was too loyal and kindhearted to have
  uttered her own thoughts. She was vexed to find that Barton could so easily
  put them into words.</p>

  <p>"I think I understand you better than you understand yourself," he said.
  "Do you suppose I don't know what an effort all this has cost you? Oh, dear,
  yes. And I shall never forget all your kindness to me. As yet I cannot
  realise it. I never expected to be talking freely and openly like this with
  anybody, least of all a woman. But I am allowing my sentiment to get the
  better of my common-sense. To-morrow I really must make another effort to get
  away from here. It will be a strange sort of Christmas Day, but, then, during
  the past ten or fifteen years, the festival has conveyed nothing to me. I
  only felt a little more remote and lonely than usual. And now let us be
  practical. Have you enough food in the house to carry us over another
  day?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, you need not be afraid about that," Hetty, laughed. "I think we shall
  be able to manage. I won't vouch for the turkey or the mince pies but apart
  from those dainties I think we shall get on very well, only you must be
  careful with the butter."</p>

  <p>"I will bear your warning in mind," said Barton gravely. "I am too
  extravagant with the toast. But, then, what can you expect from a mere
  average man like myself?"</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">Barton stood in the open air drinking in the beauty of the
  morning and the brilliancy of the sunshine. The world still lay under its
  white covering, but the hard frost had rendered the snow crisp and firm now,
  so that it was an easy matter to walk upon it without danger of going through
  the icy covering. Here was the avenue of escape for which Barton had been
  wishing. But now it had come he felt strangely reluctant to make the most of
  his opportunity. He ought to go away&mdash;that he knew perfectly well. It
  was his plain duty to do so. Instead of that, he made his way down to the
  village, where he found his fellow-travellers ensconced in a comfortable inn
  of more than average pretensions. When he returned to the schoolhouse again
  he was so laden with good things that Hetty opened her eyes in
  astonishment.</p>

  <p>"I am going to be perfectly frank with you," Barton said. "The frost has
  rendered it quite an easy matter for me to get into the village. I believe
  that before the morning is over the line will be clear as far as Castleford.
  I ought to thank you heartily for all your kindness to me, and to say
  goodbye. As a matter of fact, I can't do anything of the sort. I feel longing
  to have one congenial Christmas again, and I was going to ask you to let me
  pass the day here. See, I have brought all these good things so that we may
  enjoy ourselves. Don't you think, Miss Dane, that as we have gone so far, we
  might just as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb?"</p>

  <p>"It is all very, very wrong," Hetty murmured. "But, after all, it is good
  to find that one is still human. We will have a merry Christmas, and you
  shall stay with me, and help me to cook the dinner. What the Misses Grimshaw
  will say when they know, I tremble to think. The thought of them makes the
  situation piquant."</p>

  <p>The day crept slowly on, and teatime was past and the lamps lighted.
  Barton had quite made up his mind what to do. He would stay till the evening
  was well advanced then he would take his bag and go down to the village inn,
  where he would stay till the morning. The one romance of his life was drawing
  to a close now, and the nearer he came to the last page the less he was
  inclined to close the volume. A quiet, blissful silence had fallen on the two
  as they sat over the fireside in the dining-room tracing pictures in the
  glowing coals. Barton stood up at length, and faced his companion. He
  regarded her flushed face and fair hair admiringly. She seemed to be so
  different from the quiet, demure little creature who had admitted him into
  the house not so very long ago. There was a dainty beauty about the girl now,
  born perhaps, of her unexpected happiness and the companionship of a
  congenial soul.</p>

  <p>"Our little story is nearly at an end now," Barton said. "Another hour,
  and I must be gone. You have told me a good deal about yourself, but I have
  said little as regards my own life. Now let me make a confession to you. It
  was an accident that brought me here the other night, but the accident in
  question only anticipated events. I fully intended to call here this
  Christmas, and I should have done so in any case."</p>

  <p>"But why?" Hetty cried. "Do you know anybody here?"</p>

  <p>"I was born here," Barton said, quietly. "Time was when my family were
  people of position about here, but those days have gone for ever. My father
  was a hard-living, soured man, married to a woman who cared little or nothing
  for him. In fact, she had expected to wed money, and that was the source of
  all the trouble. There were three of us, two brothers and myself. My brothers
  were reckless sportsmen like my father; on the contrary, I cared for none of
  these things. I was too fond of dreaming and reading, so that gradually I
  became neglected and deserted, and at times was most cruelly used. I grew up
  to be solitary and secretive, and yet heaven knows there was never a man who
  had a more tender heart for the troubles of others. When the time came for me
  to leave home, I went away without one good-bye, and they were only too glad
  to get rid of me. Then the end came suddenly. My two brothers were drowned at
  sea, and my father broke his neck in the hunting-field. I came down here to
  see my mother, but she refused to have anything to do with me. Shortly before
  she died she sent me a letter, which I have kept ever since. It was no letter
  of forgiveness; it was a cold, hard, communication, telling me where I should
  find all that remained of the family property. Curiously enough, that letter
  never came into my possession until the other day. I will show it you in a
  minute or two."</p>

  <p>"Yours is a sad story," Hetty murmured.</p>

  <p>"A tragedy," Barton replied. "But, thank Heaven, it is not yet too late to
  avert it. I managed to live some way or another. I worked very hard at my
  writing until I obtained recognition, and finally I got the offer of an
  editorship, which meant a good, steady income for me, so that now I am
  practically beyond the reach of poverty. I never had any friends and no
  inclination to spend money, so that I am in a position&mdash;But we will come
  to that presently."</p>

  <p>"But that is not exactly what I am here for. I have been bound to dwell,
  to a certain extent, upon my solitude and loneliness, so that you should the
  more fully understand what is coming. A short time ago, out of the dreary
  rubbish that reaches me in shoals, I picked out a little story, which was a
  gem in its way. My experience told me at once that the writer was a woman,
  and that she was writing from her own heart. I pictured her sweet and
  sympathetic, daintily pretty and loving, and yet surrounded by jealous and
  sordid natures, which were gradually squeezing from her the light and colour
  that makes life worth living. I read that story again and again. I took it
  down to my solitary house and read it once more. Of course, there were faults
  in the story, but it was the sheer humanness of it that touched me. I did not
  write to the author: I made up my mind that when this Christmas came, and
  things were slack, I would go down and see her. It was rather an effort for a
  shy man like myself, but I am glad now that I made it, glad now that
  circumstance gave me an opportunity of appearing as my natural self and not
  as the artificial creature which Fate has made me."</p>

  <p>Hetty sat listening, her face half-shaded by her hand, but this did not
  altogether hide the brilliant tint on her features or the misty look in her
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"I think, I understand," she murmured. "There is no occasion for me to ask
  if you are the editor of the 'Imperial.'"</p>

  <p>"You have guessed correctly," Barton went on. "I am the editor of the
  magazine in question, and you are the author of the short story that touched
  me so deeply. As I said before; I was coming down to see you, and I blundered
  upon you quite by accident. Very likely I should never have looked at that
  story at all, if I had not discovered from your notepaper that it came from
  the house where I was born. Otherwise, I might have handed it over to my
  assistant, whose sympathies do not at all lie with the sentimental type of
  narrative. What small things turn the current of our lives, and cause the
  stream to flow in another direction! But I am glad I came; how glad I am I
  cannot tell you."</p>

  <p>Hetty looked up steadily: the delicate pink flush was still on her cheeks.
  But her eyes were true and steadfast.</p>

  <p>"And I am, glad you came too," she said. "'Mr. Barton, I&mdash;I really
  hope you are not disappointed."</p>

  <p>"Disappointed?" Barton cried. "It has been the pleasantest time of my
  life. Thoughtless people call these things coincidences, but there is a
  deeper significance in our meeting than that. I am going to publish your
  story, and I am going to pay you for it, though no money could buy the
  pleasure you have given me. No doubt you will write many other stories in my
  magazine and elsewhere."</p>

  <p>"Do you think that I have the gift?" Hetty asked.</p>

  <p>"That is one of your gifts," Barton said. "But you have others infinitely
  more precious; and now let me read my mother's letter, in which she tells me
  where to find all that remains of the family property..... You see, it is a
  cold, unfeeling letter, but that may pass for the present. And now to open
  the treasure-house."</p>

  <p>Barton crossed the room and placed his hand upon the centre of one of the
  oak panels, and a moment later a little cavity stood revealed. In a matter of
  fact kind of way, he produced three or four shabby looking cases, which he
  opened and laid upon the table. Hetty gave a little cry of delight, for here
  were diamonds and sapphires and a beautiful pearl collar the like of which
  she had never seen before. Her slender fingers played with the gems, whilst
  Barton watched her as if the picture were pleasing to his eye.</p>

  <p>"Put them on," he commanded. "I want to see how they look on you. Please
  don't hesitate."</p>

  <p>Hetty smiled as a she clasped the collar about her neck and placed the
  stars in her fair hair. It was, indeed, a sweet and tempting vision that
  turned demurely to Barton.</p>

  <p>"They are lovely," she said. "Once you have made me put them on I shall be
  sorry to part with them again."</p>

  <p>Barton took the two hands in his and held them firmly. There was something
  about the action that the girl could not resent.</p>

  <p>"Then why not keep them?" he said. "They are of no use to me; they never
  will be. You may say that you cannot accept a gift like that; but does it not
  strike you that there may be a way whereby your scruples can be overcome?
  Hetty, do you suppose that we came together by mere accident? Do you believe
  that it was nothing but sheer chance that sent your story to me? We are both
  lonely, we are both without friends in the world. You hate your life here the
  same as I loathe my own solitary existence. In the last few hours I have seen
  more of you than in ordinary circumstances I should have done in a month. I
  will not ask you to say yet that you care for me, but there will never be
  another girl in the world but yourself so far as I am concerned. Let us try
  the future together, and let your Christmas guest be more than a passing
  acquaintance. But you are silent: I have frightened you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Indeed, no," Hetty murmured. "I am a little dazed, a little confused in
  my mind, and yet my heart tells me that you are pointing the way to
  happiness, to the new life which up to now I have only dreamt of. I have no
  doubt in time&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That is enough," Barton cried. "At least, it is enough for the present.
  Let me kiss you now and leave you, for it is time that I was gone. But in a
  few days&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped abruptly, then he bent down and kissed the girl upon the lips.
  When she turned again he was gone, and the door had closed softly behind him.
  But Hetty's heart was glad as she thought of the future and the many glorious
  morrows that lay before her.</p><br>

  <h3>ILLUSTRATED BY J. DA COSTA</h3>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Windsor Magazine</i>, Vol. XXVI, Jun 1907, pp
  81-89</h3><br>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">IT was a bitter pill to swallow; still, there was grim
  satisfaction in the fact that the garrison had been a thorn in the side of
  Cromwell for three years past. But Basing House had fallen at last, and the
  great general had engineered the attack in person. The noise and roar of the
  fight had not yet died away, the chill October air rang to the clash of steel
  and the bursting of petronels, here and there the conflict spurted up again
  like a fire that is unquenched.</p>

  <p>The rooms of the big house reeked with the smell of powder, on the walls
  the tread of heavy feet thundered, beyond in the darkness of the courtyard
  lay a huddled heap of the garrison. Cromwell had been in the thick of the
  fight a while ago, and now he was no more to be seen. Not that it mattered
  much, seeing that the house was won and the long siege ended. There was a
  high wind outside, and the hangings of the walls bellied fiercely to the
  draught. A woman came scudding across the great hall and ran into the
  refectory to the right. Colonel Barker's brows knitted as he noticed her
  beauty and the richness of her dress.</p>

  <p><a id="pic18"

         title="A woman came scudding across the great hall.">
  </div>

  <p>"This is no place for you," he said sourly. "You should have gotten away
  with the rest. Unless it may happen that you are a spy." "I am no spy," the
  woman said. "I am looking for my husband. If he is here--"</p>

  <p>The girl&mdash;for she was little more&mdash;came to an abrupt pause, as
  if fearful that she was saying too much. She seemed to be timid and in great
  distress, though there was a suggestion of firmness in the little mouth, and
  the big, blue eyes did not lack courage.</p>

  <p>"Who are you that comes here in a case like this?" Harker demanded.</p>

  <p>"I am Sybil Harcombe, at your service, sir," the girl replied&mdash;"wife
  of Sir Walter Harcombe, who lies either dead or seriously wounded here. I
  came--"</p>

  <p>"You came over here from Harcombe in the thick of the fight!" Harker
  exclaimed with uplifted eyebrows. "True 'tis that these children of evil do
  not lack courage. I must tell my Lord General of this. It may be no secret to
  you, madam, that Cromwell is anxious to meet your husband&mdash;a traitor
  like that."</p>

  <p>"My husband is no traitor," Lady Harcombe replied hotly. "He came amongst
  you with his life in his hands to learn your plans. That he tricked and
  fooled your master I hold to be greatly to his credit. Do you call your
  creature Claypole a traitor? And yet he came into the garrison with the foul
  intent of betraying the house, as he has done."</p>

  <p>"Claypole's service was rendered to the Lord," Harker said with a certain
  sour enthusiasm. "Your man serves the Host of Darkness. If he is here--"</p>

  <p>Harker tapped the hilt of his sword significantly. Sybil Harcombe did not
  need to be told what would be the fate of her husband if he fell alive into
  the hands of the Roundheads. It was sufficient that he had weaned himself
  into the confidence of the Protector and gained more than one valuable
  secret. It was the kind of thing that Cromwell did not forget nor
  forgive.</p>

  <p>And there was a new savour in the successful siege in the fact that Walter
  Harcombe was behind the walls of Basing House. A fresh blast of wind shook
  the arras again, a sound of strife burst forth, a man cut and bleeding
  staggered into the room. There was a sally of the garrison, a last despairing
  effort in the courtyard, he said. With something on his lips that would have
  passed for an oath from a Cavalier, Harker hurried away. The heavy door
  banged sullenly behind him, but still the arras stirred. Then a slim hand
  with rings upon it pushed the heavy stuff aside, and a voice whispered the
  name of Sybil. She crossed the floor as quickly as a fawn.</p>

  <p>"Walter!" she whispered. "Walter! Surely God is very good to me
  to-night."</p>

  <p>"My faith! but that is open to doubt, dearest," the man huddled on the
  floor behind the arras groaned. "Here am I with my sword-arm broken and a
  hole in my leg as big as a Roundhead's hypocrisy. I managed to crawl here
  with all the fight gone out of me, and old Noll standing there not ten yards
  away, looking as if he's lost his self-respect and found his true value. If
  he had only known!"</p>

  <p>Sybil Harcombe shivered as she bent down and kissed the speaker. The
  spirit and flush of conflict had not yet quite died away, the clash of steel
  could be heard, and the sounds of musketry-firing. The sounds moved as the
  fugitives were chased from one part of the house to another. When order was
  restored, doubtless a careful search would be made, and the fate of Walter
  Harcombe was as good as sealed.</p>

  <p>And yet there was a smile on his face, and naught of fear in those dark,
  insolent eyes of his.</p>

  <p>"Cromwell will be back again," Sybil whispered. "'Tis said that he had
  raised the siege two days ago and pressed north, where he and his Ironsides
  are badly wanted, but for it that you were within the walls. Though why he
  has so fierce a hatred of you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Because I know too much, sweetheart," Harcombe smiled. "There were
  private papers I became possessed of&mdash;the story of an early youth, none
  too well spent. Ecod, mistress, that man is at heart still one of us! Is he
  not the grandson of old Sir Harry Cromwell, of Hinchinbrook, who was the very
  pink of what a good Cavalier should be? Did not my father hide Noll himself
  at Harcombe Place what time--"</p>

  <p>"Hush!" Sybil whispered. "We are burning the golden moments. They know not
  how I came here, they know nothing of the passage from here to Harcombe
  Place. Lie there till I see that the coast is clear. There is no time to be
  lost."</p>

  <p>Sybil sped away, as if eagerly and piteously looking for some dead friend.
  The last embers of the fight had been stamped out under the heels of the
  Ironsides, the guard had been set in the big courtyard. Colonel Harker and
  the rest were making a hasty meal in the hall. Sybil came back presently with
  her finger to his lips.</p>

  <p>"Come on," she said. "With the blessing of Providence, we shall reach the
  staircase. Lean on me, dear husband. Courage! You are worse hit than I
  thought for. But once at Harcombe Place, and you shall have all the attention
  possible&mdash;"</p>

  <p><a id="pic19"

    <img src="1300951h-images/TheBuffGauntlet2.jpg"
         title="'Courage! You are worse hit than I thought for.'">
  </div><br>

  <p>They crawled painfully across the hall and up the flagged staircase. Sybil
  had snatched off her husband's wig and wrapped him in a cloak that she had
  taken from a Parliamentary soldier, who had no need of such things in future.
  These were stern, hard times, and the girl's fingers did not so much as
  tremble. A big Puritan stood at the top of the stairs, with his petronel in
  the hollow of his arm. He would have challenged the couple as they came near,
  only Sybil signed for him to let them pass. Before the fellow could make
  parley. Sir Walter had tripped him neatly, so that he came clattering
  headlong down the stairs, and lay yelling and moaning there as if the Father
  of Lies were after him.</p>

  <p>"Now quick!" Sybil cried. "You must make an effort, dear heart. Lean on
  me; let me bear the whole weight of your body. God be praised, we are here at
  last!"</p>

  <p>With a desperate strength Sybil dragged Sir Walter into a little closet
  and closed the door behind. She was trembling and wet with her exertions. She
  fumbled along the wall till her hand touched an iron knob, and on this she
  pressed, with the result that the stone wall swung round, and a long, dark
  tunnel stood like the throat of a wolf. As the wall fell back again, there
  came yells and cries from the staircase. But the danger was past, and Sybil
  stood trembling in the velvet folds of the darkness, crying now like a very
  woman. Harcombe's uninjured arm was about her, and she was weeping on his
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Come, mistress," he said, "do not give way yet. You are as brave as you
  are beautiful, and no man can say more than that. The danger is done."</p>

  <p>"I am not so sure of that," Sybil said as she pressed forward. "Cromwell
  used to come here in the brave days&mdash;aye, and to Harcombe Place in your
  grandfather's time, too. Maybe he, too, had heard of the secret passage."</p>

  <p>"Maybe," Harcombe said grimly. "But there is another secret at Harcombe
  Place that is known only to you and I and one other. If Noll comes there, you
  will know how to act."</p>

  <p>"Aye, I shall know how to act," Sybil said with a certain fierce indrawing
  of her breath. "Whatever happens to me, you shall be saved, because the King
  has need of you. The knowledge that you possess may crown the King's troops
  with victory yet. It was a cruel, hard fate that shut you up in Basing House
  so long. If you had thought of the--"</p>

  <p>"Dear heart of mine, I did think of it. But there were traitors in the
  house. I was watched night and day. And if those traitors had known, they had
  killed me treacherously and filled the house with Ironsides from Harcombe
  Place by means of the passage. I tried it once, but the danger was too
  great."</p>

  <p>In the darkness the passage seemed to be interminably long, but the end
  came at length. Sybil had studied the place till she was as much at home in
  the pitchy darkness as she had been in broad daylight. Her slim fingers found
  the spring, a panel slid away, and a dazzling shaft of light came pouring
  into the tunnel from the hall at Harcombe Place. The old house, with its deep
  moat&mdash;the old house, part of which was below the bottom of the
  moat&mdash;seemed strangely, painfully silent after the turmoil of Basing.
  Harcombe could still hear the hum of conflict, like a revolving wheel in his
  brain.</p>

  <p>"Get me a cordial, sweetheart," he said&mdash; "strong waters of some
  kind; and then old Andrew shall carry me to bed, for my arm hurts me
  grievously. It is good to get away from there&mdash;in the name of our Lord
  the King! what is that?"</p>

  <p>Harcombe pointed with his long, buff gauntlet to a conical object lying on
  the oak, gate-legged table in the centre of the hall. It was nothing more nor
  less than a soft felt hat with a buckle at the side, a strange object to be
  seen in Harcombe Place, where everything that had the slightest savour of
  Puritanism was rigorously excluded.</p>

  <p>"I am not suffering from any noisome vapours," Harcombe went on. "My mind
  is quite clear. So, therefore, that is the hat of an Ironside soldier, who is
  evidently making himself quite at home here in the house of my
  forefathers&mdash;some low scullion who should find a proper place in the
  kitchen. What has become of Andrew, that he--"</p>

  <p>Sybil suddenly laid a finger on her husband's lips. For from the dimness
  of thestairway an aged servant was signalling violently. The house was
  strangely quiet. Harcombe caught the suggestion that there was danger of some
  kind in the air. Sybil crept up the stairs to the old servant, whose face was
  white and agitated. He looked like a dim vision of fear in the light of the
  torches in the corridor.</p>

  <p>"Whatm is it, old friend?" Sybil asked. "Where does the danger lie?"</p>

  <p>"There in the dining-parlour," the old man muttered. "Fierce men searching
  the house: a party there outside, so that retreat is cut off; and the devil
  himself in the parlour."</p>

  <p>"The devil himself! Andrew, do you mean to say "</p>

  <p>"Aye, indeed, my dear mistress. He came just in and took possession, for
  all the world as if he had been born to it. Nobody else but Oliver
  Cromwell."</p>

  <p>Sybil could scarcely refrain a cry. Cromwell there in the house! How could
  he have guessed&mdash;how could he possibly have found out? Sybil was too
  astonished to do anything for the moment. Then the vividness of the danger
  came back to her with startling force. Cromwell was there; he had his
  bodyguard with him; and only the thickness of an oak door stood between him
  and the man he needed.</p>

  <p>"Where are the servants?" Sybil asked. "Where are--"</p>

  <p>"All taken away but me," Andrew said sadly. "I was too old and feeble,
  mayhap. But the others were swept off as if they had been chaff. Dear
  mistress, what is there for us to do? If my lord and master tries to escape
  by way of the open moor--"</p>

  <p>"Your master is sorely wounded," Sybil interrupted. "It is only that great
  heart of his that keeps him going in the face of danger. Did he go far, he
  would die. And Cromwell may come out of that room at any moment. Get your
  master away, Andrew get him safe to the hiding-place, whilst I go and parley
  to gain time."</p>

  <p>Sir Walter came very slowly up the stairs. His face was set and stern as
  he listened, yet his eyes were full of passionate affection as he talked to
  his wife. He would have said something, but she waved the speech aside.</p>

  <p>"It is to be one or the other of you," she said. "I will go and reason
  with him. If he refuses to listen, which I expect, there must be no
  hesitation. There is the bare chance that you may get away yet. And if so,
  send me your gauntlet; let it be the message on the floor. If that comes
  down, I shall know that you are free. Praise be to God that there are none of
  our people in the house! It may be 'Good-bye'"</p>

  <p>The door of the parlour creaked, and Andrew drew his master back. He
  snatched the hand of his wife and kissed it passionately. The next moment he
  had vanished in the darkness of the corridor. With a firm step, and a heart
  beating none the faster, Sybil slowly descended the stairs. She had her part
  to play now, and she was not going to flinch. There was desperate danger
  here, but at any cost the precious life of Sir Walter Harcombe must be saved.
  It mattered little how Cromwell had come to know that Harcombe had found his
  way back home, seeing that his danger was going to be as great, if not
  greater, than that of the master of Harcombe Place. If Walter succeeded in
  getting away, well and good; if not, the price would be a heavy one.</p>

  <p>Quite ready for all that was going to happen, Sybil pushed her way into
  the parlour. The Protector stood there, moodily poking the wood fire with the
  toe of his riding-boot. The expression of his strong, heavy face did not
  change in the least.</p>

  <p>"I sent for you," he said. "Why did you not come before?"</p>

  <p>There was a harsh command in the question that brought the blood flaming
  to Sybil's face. Had this rude boor once been the close companion of
  gentlemen? she wondered. She had heard tales of Cromwell's early youth that
  did not tally with his middle age.</p>

  <p>"I was abroad," she said. "I did not know of the honour before me, or I
  had been back sooner. Your courtesy and your kindness, sir, touch me to the
  heart. It is a sweet and blessed privilege that Harcombe Place boasts
  to-night."</p>

  <p>The expression on Cromwell's face seemed unchanged. Sybil caught herself
  wondering whether or not there was a heart somewhere under that rugged
  breast.</p>

  <p>"Shut the door," he said, unmoved. "Shut the door and let us talk."</p>

  <p>"Talk by all means, because we must; but as to the door, shut it yourself,
  if such is your good pleasure. Have you consorted with kitchen-wenches so
  long that you have caught the manner of their lives? But I am wasting my
  time. What do you do here?"</p>

  <p>"I came here on an errand that you can guess," Cromwell said. "I came here
  to seek your husband. How he escaped my men to-night passes my understanding.
  He was not with the dead nor with the wounded; he was nowhere to be found.
  That he had been sorely mauled, I had from one who was part of the undoing;
  and yet he has escaped me. The wounded fox creeps back to his earth. That is
  why I am here to-night."</p>

  <p>"You expected to find my husband waiting for you with open arms?"</p>

  <p>"Well, perhaps not that, mistress," Cromwell said, with a near approach to
  a smile. "If he is not here, then he is not far away. If he comes not here,
  then he goes to his friend Lord Mornington, at Carew Grange, where there are
  those who are ready to say 'Nay' to that."</p>

  <p>"And if my husband does fall into your hands?"</p>

  <p>"Then he will be shot," Cromwell said hoarsely. "An example to traitors,
  be it understood. We have been too easy with them in the past."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, kindness of heart is ever your stumbling-block," Sybil said
  bitterly. "Man, have you no mercy, no feeling, no bowels of compassion? Here
  in this very house your own grandfather, then old Sir Harry Cromwell, of
  Hinchinbrook--"</p>

  <p>"My ancestors are no part of me," Cromwell interrupted. "It was men like
  my grandfather, pandering to a profligate and wasteful What was that?"</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">IT was only a grating sound, like the turning of a key in a
  lock, but it brought the gleam of suspicion in the eyes of Cromwell. Sybil
  smiled as she saw his hand go to his side. It was good to know that this hard
  man had nerves and feelings.</p>

  <p>"There is no cause for alarm," she said. "I am merely a woman, whose
  servants have been sent away, and your menials are close at hand. Do not be
  afraid."</p>

  <p>"It sounded like something down below," Cromwell said. "My men are
  searching there in the vaults and passages in the basement of this old place.
  Mayhap they are on the right scent; but certain places here have been
  cunningly contrived. There is the iron cell, for instance."</p>

  <p>"So you know of the iron cell!" Sybil cried. "But I had forgotten that you
  once enjoyed the full hospitality of this house. In return for all that
  kindness--"</p>

  <p>"It is no time to speak of kindness," Cromwell burst out harshly. "When a
  kingdom as fair as ours is at stake, why-- But how should a woman know
  anything of such matters? I heard a sound like the turning of a key in a
  lock&mdash;it seemed to come from below. I have a curiosity to see that iron
  cellar of yours."</p>

  <p>Sybil smiled to herself. Her face was deadly white now, her eyes gleamed
  with some strong tenacity of purpose. There was a suggestion of the martyr
  about her.</p>

  <p>"And also the contents of the chamber," she said sneeringly. "You hope to
  find my husband in hiding there. Well, I have nothing to conceal. Follow me,
  and you shall know all there is to know about the iron cell. This way,
  sir."</p>

    <img src="1300951h-images/TheBuffGauntlet3.jpg"
         title="'Follow me!'">
  </div><br>

  <p>Cromwell followed, his iron heels clanging on the pavement. Presently
  Sybil led the way down a long flight of stone steps which gave upon a slimy
  passage, the walls of which were green with some kind of growth; great drops
  fell from the arched roof. They were below the level of the moat now, in the
  oldest part of the house. In times gone by, prisoners had been kept in those
  damp vaults, unseen and unrecorded crimes had taken place there; for there
  had been Harcombes in those days whose names were as a white terror to the
  whole countryside. There were tales and legends still half-believed; but they
  were being forgotten now, seeing that the head of the family was a popular
  hero with his people.</p>

  <p>Most of the cell doors stood open, but one was tightly closed. The door
  was of iron, with great brass studs on it, the handle was stiff, and taxed
  Sybil's strength to the uttermost. Cromwell stood by, impotent to help, for
  the secret of the door lay in the turning of the handle. The big, iron sheet
  rolled sullenly back at last, disclosing a black interior. A clanking
  footstep came down the corridor, and a sour-looking trooper, with a lantern
  in his hand, strode along.</p>

  <p>"Give me your light, fellow," Cromwell said. "There are plenty of lanterns
  among you, and we need one. Have you found anything yet?"</p>

  <p>"It has not yet been vouchsafed to us, my lord," the man said with a
  snivelling drawl; "but our feet are on the right path, peradventure."</p>

  <p>Sybil smiled with some contempt. She took the lantern from the hand of the
  trooper and, passing up the steps that led to the door, held it high over her
  head. There was no moisture in the iron cell save for the beads on the walls,
  and the place was empty.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing here," Sybil said. "Had I told you my husband was not
  concealed here, you would not have believed me. So your memory is a good one,
  and you have not forgotten some of the secrets of the house. Do you know
  <i>all</i> about this iron cell?"</p>

  <p>The question was put with such significance that Cromwell stared at the
  speaker. He replied sullenly that he supposed that nothing had been concealed
  from him.</p>

  <p>"Then you are quite wrong," the girl replied. "This cell is sheathed with
  iron. Do you know why it is so sheathed, whilst the other cells are of plain
  granite? Do you know why you have to come up a flight of stairs to reach it
  from the corridor?"</p>

  <p>Sybil pointed to the short flight of steps that she and her companion had
  ascended to reach the iron room. Cromwell nodded, with the air of a man who
  takes little interest in the proceedings. All he knew or cared to know was
  that an enemy was concealed here, and that enemy must be driven from his
  hiding-place and destroyed. The man was doubtless down here in this curious
  underground world, and the troopers would move him presently.</p>

  <p>"I see you don't know everything," Sybil said, "so I will proceed to
  explain. First, I will shut the door, so that we need not be disturbed...
  There! Now you are a prisoner; and unless I chose to show you the way, you
  could never open that iron sheet. I could keep you a prisoner here as long as
  I liked. Do you understand that?"</p>

  <p>"I understand that I have company; and that so long as one is a prisoner,
  he is not without a companion. Come, mistress, you are concealing something
  from me."</p>

  <p>"Not for long," Sybil said in a hard, even voice; " am going to explain
  everything. Did you ever hear how the old house was raided by the Hoptons,
  and their terrible fate?"</p>

  <p>Cromwell waved his hand impatiently. He had heard some century-old story
  of the feud between the Hoptons and Harcombes, and how the castle of the
  former had been destroyed.</p>

  <p>"Ah! it is by no means a dull story," Sybil said in the same hard, even
  tones. "They came here treacherously in the dead of the night&mdash;one
  hundred and nine of them&mdash;and our people fled to the vaults, where they
  were followed. The foe fell into the trap. And what happened? Next day, one
  hundred and nine corpses, fair and dark, rich and poor, lay out in the
  courtyard, and our people buried them. The Hoptons were wiped clean out, and
  we pulled their castle down stone by stone. Have you heard of that?"</p>

  <p>"In my youth," Cromwell said impatiently. "The silly lie of some
  kitchen-wench."</p>

  <p>"It was not a lie; it is absolutely true. And the only loss our people
  sustained was a young girl who had a hopeless passion for the then ruling
  head of the family. Somebody had to perish to save the house, and that girl
  chose to do so. The fact that she was dying at the time made the story the
  more touching&mdash;to people possessed of feeling at all."</p>

  <p>"Meaning that I have none," Cromwell said sourly. "What really happened,
  mistress?"</p>

  <p>"Oh. I see that I interest you at last!</p>

  <p>The moat was tapped. The moat can be tapped from here, and these vaults
  and passages flooded with a great rush of water. In time the water would rise
  until this iron room were filled to the roof; there would be no end to it,
  because the moat is fed from the lake on the high ground over against Basing
  village. It was the rush of</p>

  <p>those cruel waters that wiped the Hoptons out of existence."</p>

  <p>"But the girl need not have died," Cromwell protested. "If she had cut off
  the flow of water--"</p>

  <p>"She could not," Sybil went on. "The pressure from without is too great.
  Our machinery is too imperfect for that. The raised gates have to be forced
  down from without. They refused to work on that fatal night because the lake
  was in flood&mdash;a fact that had been overlooked. And so the heroine died,
  and the Hoptons raided the land no longer. It was a brave thing to do."</p>

  <p>"It was a brave thing to do," Cromwell echoed. "For a woman it was a noble
  act."</p>

  <p>"It was. We all think so. She did it to save the house she loved, as I
  might do it to save the man I loved. What one woman can do, another need not
  shrink from."</p>

  <p>Cromwell started. Moody and preoccupied as he was, the full significance
  of the speech was not lost on him. The sombre eyes sought Sybil's face
  keenly. He saw a deadly white face, with a pair of eyes gleaming dangerously;
  he saw resolution&mdash; almost inspiration&mdash;and the fact was borne in
  upon him that his life was in peril.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to threaten me?" he</p>

  <p>"No," Sybil said gently. "I mean nothing of the kind. My husband's life is
  in danger; he is, as you say, sorely wanted. And he is not very far off. Your
  ferret instinct has not played you false. If my man is taken now, the King's
  cause would suffer. The King has need of him. His life or death may change
  the whole fortunes of the day."</p>

  <p>"We will not argue that," Cromwell muttered. "Those despatches--"</p>

  <p>"And your private papers. It is your pleasure to call Walter Harcombe a
  spy and a traitor, and proclaim the fact that you are going to shoot him.
  Now, if you will write a message to your men outside calling them off, and
  send these roundheaded, prowling rats of yours from the house, I may--"</p>

  <p>"These be brave words," Cromwell cried. "Woman, are you talking to
  <i>me</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Aye, I am," Sybil said between her teeth. "And I am going to play the
  woman to-night. My husband must escape, or I pay the penalty with my life. I
  did not bring you here to threaten or to abuse. If my husband does not go
  free under an order from your own hand, you and I die. I will play Jeanne
  d'Arc to you; I will rid England of a cold-hearted tyrant, who plays the tune
  of his ambition to the melody of religion. Aye, I am not boasting."</p>

  <p>There was danger here, and the great Parliamentarian gripped it. They were
  locked there together, and the secret of the way out of it was known only to
  a woman who had lost her senses for love of her husband. Cromwell crossed the
  cell and gripped Sybil by the wrist.</p>

  <p>"There is not likely to be any danger now," he said.</p>

  <p>"You think not?" The girl made an effort to free herself. "You may go if
  you can find the way out. Presently, when the moat is at flood, a great log
  of wood will glide down past the spies as if the stream had carried it down,
  and on that log will be my husband. He will get away right under the eyes of
  your vigilants. If they shoot him down, should he attempt to lower the
  flood-gates, then your fate and mine is sealed. And I shall be a saint in the
  memory of my husband. I shall go down to posterity as the woman who rid free
  England of a tyrant. Let me go!"</p>

  <p>Sybil wrenched herself away suddenly and jumped heavily on a square plate
  let in the floor. She laughed as a hollow clang rang out, and almost
  instantly the silence of the place was broken with a shock and a roar, as if
  the whole house were in the throes of an earthquake. Every stone and every
  stick of timber creaked and groaned; the roaring came nearer and nearer, till
  the rush of it drowned every other sound. Sybil had been as good as her word;
  she had tapped the lake, and the flood was streaming through the house
  already.</p>

  <p>Then she crossed over and pulled back the iron door. Already the passage
  outside, at the foot of the flight of stairs, was a white, foaming torrent.
  As Cromwell looked, he could see that the seething stream was rising higher
  and higher.</p>

  <p>"Can you swim?" Sybil asked, pointing to the shimmering force below. "You
  cannot? Well, it would make no difference. Nobody could live in that dreadful
  whirlpool&mdash;the fall is too great. It joins;the river in the
  water-meadows below the house. See how it is creeping up&mdash;up, still
  higher, till it reaches the floor where we are standing. Oliver Cromwell, if
  there is any sincerity in your prayers, you will need them now. Look!"</p>

  <p>The girl pointed with a steady hand to an object that came turning and
  twisting with the flood. It was the dead body of a man in full
  uniform&mdash;the trooper who had provided Cromwell with the lantern.</p>

  <p>"Aye, well, you have reason to be proud of your work," Cromwell said
  bitterly.</p>

  <p>"I am not proud of the thing which is no better than murder. Yet there is
  no shame to me when I think of the murder that you have planned. Come, if I
  can yet save vour life, will you take terms from me?"</p>

  <p>It was a long time before Cromwell replied. He did not do so until the
  shining flood had risen above his ankles.</p>

  <p>"You are the stuff that heroes are born from," he said with a certain
  grudging admiration. "It is because England has need of me, because God has
  called me to right a great wrong, that I yield. I dare not go and stand in
  the presence of my Maker feeling that I have betrayed His trust to save my
  stiff-necked pride. Your husband is free of me if you can stay the crime that
  you have done."</p>

  <p>"I may fail," she said; "but presently the flood will bring me a message.
  If my husband's buff gauntlet comes down, I shall know that he has got beyond
  the confines of the house. That was the signal that he promised me. If he has
  been taken, then you and I die together. Have you ink and powder and a pen in
  your doublet?"</p>

  <p>Cromwell signified that he had writing materials about him. He watched the
  waters rising almost up to his knees, the fear of death danced before his
  eyes. Presently along the shining bosom of the floor came the signal in the
  form of a buff gauntlet. Sybil snatched it np and took a tiny scrap of paper
  from the bosom of her dress.</p>

  <p>"Now write a message on that, and write quickly," she said. "There is no
  time to be lost. The glove will float down the stream and out on the margin
  of the water-meadows. Old Andrew will be waiting for it; for Andrew and
  myself have tried the scheme more than once before, little dreaming how soon
  we should make use of it... Is that writing done?.... There!"</p>

  <p>Sybil flung the glove afar out into the stream, and it slid away beyond
  the circle of light made by the lantern. Still the water crept up, until it
  reached the deep chest of the soldier, and nearly to the shoulders of the
  woman. The flood was very cold; but Sybil made no sign, for within she glowed
  with the consciousness of a great victory.</p>

  <p>The water was not moving now, it came no higher. Had the signal reached
  its destination? Cromwell asked himself. It was characteristic of the man
  that be displayed no kind of feeling, and yet his face lightened invisibly as
  he saw the horn buttons of his coat emerging one by one as the stream began
  to subside. There was a steady, sucking noise in the corridor, the steps
  crept in sight one by one, until the floor appeared once more.</p>

  <p>"Now, sir," Sybil said. She spoke bravely enough, though a deadly fear was
  gripping her. "Now we can get to the level of the house again, where no
  damage will have been done, and you and I can exchange pretty courtesies by
  the side of a roaring fire. I take it that you feel a certain inconvenience
  from your adventure?"</p>

  <p>"Some dry clothing?" Cromwell said.</p>

  <p>"It shall be forthcoming. I pray of you to go upstairs and take the first
  room to the right. I go to change my own attire. Then perhaps you will permit
  me to extend my hospitality, seeing that the house is not strange to you. As
  a mark of my distinguished favour, I have shown you a secret of the house
  which is not revealed to every stranger. Ah! I hear Andrew."</p>

  <p>Old Andrew had come back to the house, his withered face broken with many
  emotions. When the great Parliamentarian came down to the parlour, clad in
  dry clothing, he found Sybil awaiting him. Her face was flushed now and her
  eyes unduly bright. In a deep chair on the other side of the fire sat Sir
  Walter Harcombe. One of Sybil's hands was on his shoulder, the other he held
  proudly and lovingly.</p>

  <p>"'Sdeath, sir!" he said; "but these be brave times. And so you have
  measured your wit against that of a woman, and gotten a fall, as many a
  better man has done before you. Presently, when you are gone, I shall try and
  tell this dear wife of mine what I think of her. Come, sir, you will drink a
  cup of the best to the sweetest heroine who ever risked her life for the sake
  of the unworthy fellow who was privileged to call himself a husband. As a
  courtesy, as a medicine, as a toast&mdash;call it what you will. And shake
  hands upon it."</p>

  <p>"As a toast, then," Cromwell said in a deep voice, as he raised the needed
  cordial to his lips. "Madam, my profoundest respects to you. But the draught
  is a bitter one, and my stomach likes it not at all. So if you will suffer me
  to depart--"</p>

  <p>He raised his fingers to his cap and saluted gravely. Then he turned on
  his heels and quitted the room, clanging the door sullenly behind.</p><br>

  <h3>ILLUSTRATED BY GILBERT HOLIDAY</h3>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Windsor Magazine</i>, Vol. XXVI, Sep 1907, pp
  427-435</h3><br>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">IT seemed to Jack Clifford as if a lid had been shut down
  somewhere and the noise and roar of London stifled out of existence.
  Everything was so quiet there, so different to what he had imagined the
  interior of a newspaper office to be. There was no bustle, no struggling or
  noise, merely a suite of silent, green rooms where men worked feverishly
  under the light of shaded lamps. Wickham, the editor of the <i>Daily
  Herald</i>, welcomed Clifford into his own sanctum and indicated a chair.</p>

  <p>"I hope you don't mind," he said. "As a matter of fact, I have sent for
  you professionally. To put the case in a nutshell, we have been receiving
  from time to time exceedingly valuable pieces of news from a mysterious old
  man who calls himself Levetsky. I don't mind telling you that I regard this
  as a <i>nom de plume.</i> The man has been to see me more than once, and he
  always comes with something very startling in the way of news, especially
  news relating to the Eastern Europe problem."</p>

  <p>"Your paper appears to be very well served in that respect," Chfford said.
  "On more than one occasion you have fairly startled London. That letter from
  the Kaiser, for instance."</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow, that was no thanks to our enterprise. A verbatim copy of
  the letter was supplied by this Levetsky. He would accept no payment, he
  refused to give any account of himself, and left us to publish it as we
  liked. You see, we have always taken the side of the Progressive Party in
  Russia, and I understood Levetsky to say that be was merely showing his
  gratitude. I hesitated for a long time before publishing that letter, but, as
  all the world knows now, I was perfectly justified in doing so. On no less
  than six occasions we have brought off the most remarkable coups, and all
  owing to that extraordinary old man who comes and goes in the most mysterious
  fashion and who is never wrong. Which brings me to the point. About nine
  o'clock to-night, Levetsky called to see me, but I was busily engaged then
  and could not give him an interview. I sent a message down to ask him to come
  back about half-past ten, to which he replied that he might not be able to do
  so; at the same time he sent me a few lines in an envelope&mdash;I presume,
  as a guarantee of his <i>bona fides</i>. I tell you I fairly jumped when I
  read the contents of that note."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, Wickham bent forward and whispered into Clifford's ear. His
  voice was low and impressive.</p>

  <p>"I don't want a soul to know this," he said. "According to this morning's
  papers, the Czar was more or less a prisoner in the Kremlin Palace,
  practically owing his life to the courage of a regiment of Cossacks. That is
  what all Europe believes, but Levetsky tells me that the Czar is at present
  in England and is hiding at Buckingham Palace at this very moment. I tell
  you, Clifford, this is the kind of "scoop" that makes an editor's blood
  tingle. Common sense inspires me to trust Levetsky implicitly and make a
  blazing feature of his information in to-morrow morning's <i>Herald</i>. The
  man has never played me false yet, and I don't see why he should now, but I
  have got a fit of editorial stage fright upon me and I dare not risk it."</p>

  <p>"I'm not surprised," Clifford said. "I can see your dilemma exactly. Here
  is a chance of a lifetime, and yet if the information proves to be false, you
  do your paper incalculable damage. But tell me, where do I come in?"</p>

  <p>"Well," Wickham said, "you are the one man in London I can trust in a
  crisis like this. An old Secret Service man like you is better than
  half-a-dozen detectives. I quite expect that Levetsky will come back here
  about half-past ten, and I shall see him and get full particulars. I want you
  to wait outside in the corridor and follow Levetsky. Find out all about him,
  and according to your report, so I shall act in the matter of this exclusive
  information. It does not matter if you fail to make your report to me before
  half-past one this morning, as we don't go to press till after two,"</p>

  <p>Clifford looked up eagerly with the light of battle gleaming in his eyes.
  Here was an adventure after his own heart&mdash;something dark and
  mysterious, and with a strong suggestion of danger about it. He nodded
  briskly.</p>

  <p>"You can count me in," he said. "I only wish I was dressed better for the
  part. One does not generally go off on this sort of excursion in an opera-hat
  and a dress-suit. Still, I dare say I can manage to borrow an old overcoat
  from one of the staff."</p>

  <p>The matter was arranged to Clifford's satisfaction. He waw still talking
  to Wickham when an assistant came up and whispered something to his editor.
  The latter turned immediately to Mr. Clifford.</p>

  <p>"Here's our man," he said. "If you wait outside, you will get a glimpse of
  him as he comes up the stairs."</p>

  <p>It was too dark in the corridor for Clifford to get more than a hazy
  impression of the visitor. He was of medium height, and would have looked
  taller but for a painful stoop in the shoulders. He dragged his left leg
  after him as if it had been maimed in some accident; altogether he suggested
  an old man who had suffered much by contact with the world. The slightly
  aquiline features were almost smothered with a mass of black moustache and
  beard, the eyes were hidden beneath the shadow of a large-brimmed hat;
  altogether the purveyor of exclusive information bore a strong resemblance to
  the typical Nihilist of the stage.</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p>It was half an hour later before Chfford had an opportunity of shadowing
  his quarry. The old man passed down Tudor Street on to the Embankment and
  turned presently into one of the walks beyond Temple Gardens. The electric
  lights cast clean shadows of the trees on the gravel, beyond the shrubs where
  was an inky mass of darkness. The old man limped along for some time, with
  Clifford strolling some twenty yards in the rear, then he turned round
  suddenly and waited till the amateur detective was alongside. It was quite
  clear to Clifford's mind that Levetsky meant to speak to him.</p><br>

  <p><a id="pic21"

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1300951h-images/TheLuckOfTheGame1.jpg"
         title="He turned round suddenly and waited...">
  </div><br>

  <p>"You will pardon me," he said, "but I am going to ask you to do me a
  favour. It is only a small matter."</p>

  <p>Somewhat to Clifford's surprise, the speaker's English was not only
  correct and bespoke a man of education, but there was a ring in it which
  proclaimed the fact that Levetsky was accustomed to giving orders and in the
  habit of being obeyed.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," Clifford said pohtely. The adventure was shaping after his
  own heart. "I shall be only too delighted. My knowledge of London, like that
  of a certain historic personage in fiction, is extensive and peculiar. My
  purse, alas! is not so extensive, though it may be equally peculiar.
  Still&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Clifford will have his joke," the Russian said, with a quiet smile.
  "I think you will admit, sir, that one good turn deserves another. I am not
  in the least annoyed that Mr. Wickham had me followed to-night; he has the
  interests of his paper to safeguard, and he was prudent to act as he did. My
  good fortune lies in the knowledge that Mr. Wickham selected Mr. Jack
  Clifford to play the part of his detective."</p>

  <p>"This is gratifying," Clifford said. "This, if I may so put it, is fame.
  But I fail to see why I should go out of my way&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Precisely," Levetsky smiled. "A little time ago, you were interested on
  behalf of a certain Cabinet Minister who had become entangled with a lady
  whom we will simply speak of as the Countess. He wanted to prove what you
  suspected&mdash;that the Countess was no more than a police spy and an
  adventuress. In this case, luck stood you in good stead, for an anonymous
  letter which you received enabled you to persuade the Countess that the air
  of London was dangerous to a constitution like hers. Not to make too long a
  story of it, Mr. Clifford, <i>I</i> sent you that letter."</p>

  <p>"Did you really?" Chfford exclaimed. "Now, that was devilish&mdash;I mean,
  exceedingly thoughtful of you. You may command my services in any way you
  wish."</p>

  <p>Levetsky's manner changed; he became suddenly curt and stern. With a
  swift, flashing glance around him, he drew Clifford behind a clump of bushes
  and commanded him to take off his overcoat. Once this was done, Levetsky took
  a pair of scissors from his pocket, and, coolly untying Clifford's cravat and
  unfastening his collar, he proceeded to cut away the whole of the shirt-front
  and neckband, to which extraordinary proceeding Clifford acquiesced without a
  murmur. It was one of the strange, bizarre kind of things that he was
  accustomed to himself.</p>

  <p>"This is all very well," he said, "but what am I going to do?"</p>

  <p>"You are going to be <i>me</i>," Levetsky said. "See, I discard my coat
  and the scarf which is about my neck, then I place this apology for a
  dress-shirt about my breast, and tie the collar, so. Also, I take your
  opera-hat like this, then I slip on the overcoat, so, and button the two
  bottom buttons. In the darkness of the night I pass for a gentleman going
  home after dinner. Then I dress you up like this: I place over your face my
  ragged moustache and beard, then my wig and the slouch hat. When the man who
  is watching for me by Cleopatra's Needle sees me emerge from the Gardens, he
  says to himself: 'That is not my man'; then, when he sees you coming out of
  the Gardens, he says: 'Ah I here is the old fox! Let me follow him.' But I do
  not want to be followed, because I am going to your Buckingham Palace; on the
  other hand, I want you to be followed. You will walk straight from here down
  the Embankment and over Westminster Bridge. Your adventure will not be
  entirely free from danger, so that if you are afraid&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am not in the least afraid," Clifford said. "On the contrary, I am
  looking forward to the adventure with great eagerness. If I am
  kidnapped&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Which is more than probable," Levetsky said coolly. "In that event, you
  must ask your captors to send for Colonel Azoff. Unless I am greatly
  mistaken, the gallant colonel is an old official acquaintance of yours, and
  it would be a great misfortune to him if anything happened to you at this
  moment."</p>

  <p>"That is right," Clifford said drily. "A little matter of forgery which
  would be exceedingly awkward for a member of the Russian Ambassador's staff
  if the thing became public."</p>

  <p>Levetsky smiled with the air of a man who knows all the circumstances of
  the case. He stood in the darkness; then, as he bent forward and a ray of
  light flickered for a moment on his face, Clifford could see that his aspect
  had entirely changed. He was no longer bent and old; he stood there alert and
  vigorous, his powerful face as if cut in marble. There was a long scar on the
  left cheek. All this Clifford noted in the winking of an eye. It was not for
  him to ask questions. He was ready to obey.</p>

  <p>"What am I to do now?" he desired.</p>

  <p>"Merely to carry out instructions," Levetsky said. "Now that you are
  figuring in my disguise, I see a resemblance to me which is remarkable.
  Unfortunately, my enemies have penetrated my disguise, and this is why you
  are appearing, so to speak, as a wolf in sheep's clothing. I dare say so
  clever a mimic as yourself could copy my slouch and my limp. All you have to
  do now is to walk along the Embankment and stroll across Westminster Bridge.
  As your bishop said in the story, we can leave the rest to Providence."</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">SOMEWHERE or another a clock with a remarkably sweet chime
  was striking the hour of eleven. Clifford sat up and began slowly to collect
  his thoughts and review the events of the past hour or so. He could
  distinctly remember limping across Westminster Bridge; he recollected that he
  had paused there to look down into the water; the bridge had been singularly
  quiet for that time of night. There were practically no passengers on foot,
  so that Clifford seemed to have London to himself. He was enjoying the
  adventure keenly enough; he half expected at any moment to be pounced upon by
  something weird in the way of a malefactor, so that he took no notice of two
  men who came along arm in arm, as if they had just left the Houses of
  Parliament. In a casual sort of way Clifford could see that they were in
  evening dress; just before reaching him, one of them paused to light a
  cigarette. The match went out, and Clifford understood the smoker to say that
  it was his last.</p>

  <p>"You got a match?" he said, addressing Clifford as a man of that class
  would speak to the derelict.</p>

  <p>Chfford fumbled in his pocket; he did not notice that the second man had
  dropped behind him, and an instant later a grip of steel was about his
  throat. Something sweet and pungent was crammed into his mouth and nostrils;
  the whole world fainted away into a kind of easy dream. Clifford's last
  recollection was the sound of a cab-whistle and the jog-trot of a horse on
  the roadway.</p>

  <p><a id="pic22"
     name="pic22"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1300951h-images/TheLuckOfTheGame2.jpg"
         title="An instant later a grip of steel was about his throat.">
  </div><br>

  <p>It had all come back to him now. He was feeling a little dizzy and sick
  from the effects of the drug, but his head was rapidly clearing, and his
  courage came leaping to his finger-tips. At any rate, he had not been decoyed
  into any loathsome den, for the apartment in which he found himself was a
  singularly well-furnished one, and could only have belonged to a house in the
  best part of the West End. From the absence of noise, Clifford guessed that
  he was at the back of the house. He saw that the three windows were shuttered
  and fastened with iron bars. A closer examination revealed the fact that the
  bars had been screwed into the shutters. Also the heavy door was locked on
  the outside. All this Clifford found out for himself with the aid of a box of
  vestas, then his eyes fell upon the artistic arrangements of electric light,
  there was the snap of a switch or two, and the fine room was bathed in a
  flood of subdued illumination.</p>

  <p>Clifford surveyed himself critically in a fine old Florentine mirror
  suspended over the fireplace. Evidently his captors had handled him more or
  less carefully, for, beyond a slight disarrangement of his wig, his disguise
  remained intact. He had probably been brought here and placed on the couch to
  recover from the effects of the drug. The more he looked around him, the more
  convinced he was that he had been forcibly conveyed to the house of someone
  who did not lack means and whose resources were ample. A box of cigarettes,
  flanked by a pint bottle of champagne and glasses, stood on a side table
  which in itself was an admirable specimen of Chippendale's earlier methods.
  "This is thoughtful," Clifford murmured to himself. "It would be ungenerous
  not to accept such a delicate hospitality."</p>

  <p>Clifford drank the wine and smoked a cigarette in ruminative silence. It
  was borne in upon him presently that he was not alone in the house, as he had
  at first imagined. It had occurred to him that those who were in search of
  Levetsky had probably hired a house for the purpose of spiriting their
  prisoner away. But presently Clifford could hear the ripple of an electric
  bell, the opening and shutting of distant doors, and then a man's voice
  laughing heartily. The man was not alone, evidently, for his mirth appeared
  to be shared by a woman, whose delicate treble mingled musically with the
  bass of her companion. So far as Clifford could judge, the sound came from an
  adjoining room. Then, as his upturned glance detected a large ventilator,
  Clifford understood. The ventilator was open, and by means of a trinity of
  chairs it was possible to look into the next apartment.</p>

  <p>This room was furnished, if possible, more luxuriously than the
  prison-house. A couple of servants in livery were engaged in removing the
  remains of an elaborate supper, round a card-table by the fireplace two men
  and two women were seated. Clifford's features expanded into something like a
  grin as he noticed the face of one of the men there, but the grin became a
  chuckle as he took in the woman with the diamonds in her hair. Clifford had
  made up his mind what to do. He removed the chairs and, crossing over to the
  fireplace, coolly rang the bell.</p>

  <p>There was a sound presently as if the card-party had been disturbed; there
  was a click in the lock, and the door opened to admit a figure, tall and well
  proportioned. The newcomer was in evening dress; Clifford recognised him for
  one of the card-players.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" he asked haughtily. "There is everything here that you
  can possibly require; if you are disposed to be quiet, you will come to no
  harm for the present."</p>

  <p>"It is not the present that troubles me," Clifford said. "I am thinking of
  the future. What are you going to do with me? I cannot remain here."</p>

  <p>"You are not likely to remain here," the other said with a grin. "The air
  of this country does not agree with you; besides, you are too busy with
  affairs which should not concern you. Once you are back in Russia, we shall
  know how to deal with you."</p>

  <p>"Oh, indeed," Clifford said drily. "You are perhaps aware of the fact that
  there is no extradition for political offences in England. "If I choose to
  object&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You will not be in a condition to object," the other man said. "Pouf! The
  thing is as easy as kissing you hand. You are our brother&mdash;our poor
  brother who is sick unto death. A little more or less of that drug with which
  you became acquainted to-night, and you are in a condition of practical
  insensibility all the way from London to Paris. We travel with a doctor from
  the Embassy who is certifying as to your condition. A little more of that
  drug, and you wake to find yourself in St. Petersburg. You understand?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, precisely," Clifford said. "From your point of view the programme
  does not contain a single flaw. But in the first place I will ask you whom
  you take me for?"</p>

  <p>The other man bowed and smiled. There was a strange, meaning look in his
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"In diplomacy it is always well to be discreet," he said. "If I ask for
  you at your rooms, I inquire for Levetsky. I know you by no other name. St.
  Petersburg will know you by no other name. To go still further, Siberia will
  know you by no other name; and when you tell the governor of Tobolsk gaol
  that you are not Levetsky, but &mdash;er&mdash;a much more important
  personage, he will laugh at you and place your petition to the Czar in the
  stove."</p>

  <p>"I need not go so far to petition the Czar," Clifford said. "A hansom cab
  would take me to His Majesty in ten minutes. Pshaw! Do you think I don't know
  that the Little Father is in Buckingham Palace at the present moment?"</p>

  <p>Clifford was enjoying his part in the comedy immensely. He had thrown
  himself into the part of Levetsky heart and soul. It was a pure pleasure to
  him now to see the look of amazement and alarm which had spread itself out
  over the face of his companion.</p>

  <p>"What I say is evidently news to you," he went on. "It is probably news to
  the Embassy also&mdash;but send Colonel Azoff to me."</p>

  <p>"Azoff?" the big man stammered. "I&mdash;I don't understand what you mean.
  Besides, he is not&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, he is," CHfford cried. "He is in the next room playing cards
  with Countess Czerny. Tell him that if he doesn't come to me at once, nothing
  can save him from standing in Bow Street dock to-morrow morning on a charge
  of forging the signature of&mdash;well, we need not mention the name of the
  nobleman."</p>

  <p>The listener passed his hand across his forehead as if to gather together
  his scattered thoughts. He muttered something under his breath and cast a
  malignant glance in Clifford's direction. Then he turned on his heel and left
  the room, carefully locking the door behind him. No sooner had he gone than
  Clifford buttoned the borrowed coat around him and removed every trace of his
  disguise, which he carefully stuffed away under the couch. He could hear the
  whispers and muttered conversation in the next room, but there was no more
  laughter and no further sounds of gay enjoyment. The key clicked in the lock
  again, and Colonel Azoff entered the room. Clifford was standing looking into
  the fireplace, so that it was impossible for the new-comer to see his
  face.</p>

  <p>"What is the meaning of this?" Azoff demanded, "and who are you to send me
  so insulting a message, by&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Softly, my dear Colonel," Clifford said as he wheeled round. "You are
  always so headlong, so impetuous. You do not seem to realise that I have run
  a considerable risk, and incurred a considerable danger also, to see you
  to-night. But won't you sit down? It is so much better than standing."</p>

  <p>No reply came from Colonel Boris Azoff, of the Czar's Household. He stood
  there gnawing at the end of his waxed moustache, his dark eyes fairly bulging
  from his head. He seemed utterly incapable for the moment of comprehending
  the fact of Clifford's presence. The latter lay back in an armchair in sheer
  joy of the situation.</p>

  <p>"You are not well," he said. "Something seems to have upset you. You do
  not seem to understand why I am here&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But how did you get here?" the Colonel burst out at length. "We
  thought&mdash;we thought&mdash;that we had laid hold, but I must not mention
  that name. My dear fellow, you are in great danger here. You must get away at
  once. At any risks, I must clear you out of the house. This is no place for
  you."</p>

  <p>"But where am I?" Clifford asked. "In what part of London?"</p>

  <p>Azoff' made no reply. He seemed to be utterly lost in contemplation of a
  problem beyond his mental grasp.</p>

  <p>"I must not tell you," he said presently. "I could not betray a confidence
  like that. There has been some terrible mistake here. In the exercise of our
  duty we have been endeavouring to lay hands upon&mdash;upon a man called
  Levetsky. I could have sworn to-night that I saw Levetsky carried into this
  room&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Impossible!" Clifton cried. "The man you call Levetsky is at the present
  moment at Buckingham Palace, where he is having an interview with your
  Emperor."</p>

  <p>It was the crowning stroke in Clifford's little comedy. He saw Azoff
  stagger back as if he had been struck with a whip-lash. He saw the great
  drops standing out on the Russian's forehead. Then, with a wonderful effort,
  Azoff pulled himself together and threw the door wide open. Silently he
  beckoned Clifford to follow him into the great wide hall. A moment later and
  Clifford was pushed violently down the steps into the roadway, and the door
  was banged behind him. He could hear the shooting of bolts and the rattling
  of chains, followed by a long ripple of electric bells. Clifford could make
  out the outline of trees opposite, and a long row of fine houses stretching
  on either hand. It was just a moment before he could make up his mind to the
  exact locality in which he stood.</p>

  <p>"Belgrave Square," he muttered. "795, Belgrave Square. I must not forget
  the number. I must find out who lives here. Hi, cabby! I want you to drive me
  as far as the office of the <i>Morning Herald</i>; an extra shilling if you
  get me there in twenty minutes."</p>

  <p>The cabman grinned as Clifford jumped into the hansom, the horse's head
  was turned towards the East as they flew along.</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">WICKHAM was pacing restlessly up and down his office as
  Clifford came in and cast aside his slouch hat and cloak and demanded that
  someone should take a note to his rooms and procure him a shirt and
  collar.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Heavens, yes!" Wickham said irritably. "You can have a whole hosier's
  shop if you like. But you look as if you have been having a good time of it.
  Only do get to the point."</p>

  <p>"I have had an excellent time of it," Clifford said cheerfully. "But I
  know what you want. Our friend Levetsky has not come back, and you are
  worrying yourself into fiddlestrings as to whether or not you shall publish
  that important news about the Czar. Well, you can do it; it is absolutely
  correct."</p>

  <p>"Is that really so?" Wickham exclaimed. "You are quite sure of it? But,
  seeing that there is plenty of time, you might just as well relate your
  adventures."</p>

  <p>Clifford proceeded to tell his story at considerable length. He saw the
  face of his companion gradually clearing as he went on with his convincing
  narrative.</p>

  <p>"Then I'll risk it," Wickham said. "There is only one thing wanted to
  round off the account perfectly. Of course, it is out of the question to
  believe that the man who calls himself Levetsky is no more than an obscure
  refugee who has suffered at the hands of the Russian Government. It is
  equally absurd to say that the Czar would come on a secret mission to England
  merely to meet this clever old man. If we could only get at his
  name&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I have," Clifford said coolly. "I am prepared to bet anything you like in
  reason that I can give you the proper name of the man who calls himself
  Levetsky. Mind you, it would be a distinct breach of faith on my part to do
  so without our mysterious friend's permission. But the first thing we have to
  do, it seems to me, is to find out who lives at 795 Belgrave Square. Just
  hand me over the London Directory, will you?"</p>

  <p>The volume in question stood on Wickham's desk, and Clifford rapidly
  fluttered over the leaves. He was not a man usually given to the display of
  emotion, but his face was a study in astonishment as he bent down once again
  to read the figures.</p>

  <p>"Well, if this doesn't beat me I " he cried. "Number 795, Belgrave Square,
  owner and occupier. Prince Boris Gassells. Good Heavens, Wickham, if you only
  knew what I know, what an eye-opener it would be for you! Of course, the name
  of Prince Boris Gassells is quite familiar to you?"</p>

  <p>"Rather," Wickham said drily. "Why, he was the man who last year very
  nearly succeeded in bringing about a proper Russian constitution. If he had
  had his own way, Russia would have a parliament like England by this time. As
  it was, the old official party deliberately conspired to ruin the Prince, and
  he escaped with his life by getting away to England. I understand that when
  he arrived here he was practically penniless, for his estates were
  confiscated. Mark me, if that man had had a better chance, he would have
  saved Russia, and the official gang knew it. It is any odds, Clifford, that
  the Czar is here now with the sole intention of settling matters with the
  Prince."</p>

  <p>"You've got it," Clifford said drily. "Wonderful what a grasp a
  journalistic mind has! At any rate, there is one thing you may be sure
  of&mdash;Levetsky will not return to-night, and you may set about preparing
  your big 'scoop' with an easy mind. I'll drop in and see you to-morrow
  evening, and I shall be greatly astonished if I am not in a position to
  afford you matter enough for one of the most sensational articles that ever
  bucked up the circulation of a newspaper. Good night."</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p>London seethed with excitement next morning, once the true inwardness of
  page five of the <i>Morning Herald</i> was grasped. The air was full of
  rumours which were more or less dissipated as the day went on by an official
  acknowledgment of the fact that His Imperial Majesty the Czar had paid a
  flying visit to London for the purpose of consulting King Edward on matters
  of a private family nature. It was also intimated that the Emperor was
  already on his way back home, and that he was accompanied by Prince Boris
  Gassells, and that important constitutional changes were in contemplation. It
  mattered very little to Wickham what the evening papers had to say. They were
  welcome enough to their crumbs of late information, for the cake had been
  his. He was therefore prepared to receive Clifford in a genial frame of mind
  when the latter put in an appearance at the <i>Herald</i> office after
  dinner.</p>

  <p>"I can tell you the story in a few words," Clifford said. "I gave you an
  elaborate description last night of what happened to me at that house in
  Belgrave Square. My main cause for astonishment was the audacious trick
  played by my friend Colonel Azoff and his companions on the man called
  Levetsky. Now, you told me that Prince Boris Gassells came to England a poor
  man. You had utterly forgotten that he used to spend six months of the year
  in London, and that he had a house of his own in Belgrave Square. After his
  disgrace he let the house furnished and thus found means to live. On this
  occasion the house was not let, and the Prince lived there in strict
  retirement with one old servant, occupying between them a small room in the
  basement. Colonel Azoff and the other man, whose name I cannot ascertain,
  wanted to get hold of Levetsky and take him back to St. Petersburg. I know
  how anxious they were to do that, or I should not have had so striking an
  adventure last night. But just mark the audacity of these people. They
  actually obtained possession of the Prince's house and conveyed Levetsky
  &mdash;that is, myself&mdash;there where no one would dream of looking for
  him. They were perfectly safe, as you will see quite plainly. But, mind you,
  they knew what I only discovered last night, and what you have suspected for
  some time&mdash;namely, that this so-called Levetsky was a man in a much
  higher position than he pretended to be. My dear fellow, you are very sharp
  as a rule, cannot you guess who our friend Levetsky really is?"</p>

  <p>Wickham shook his head as if the puzzle was too much for him. He turned
  eagerly to Clifford for an explanation. The latter rose and walked excitedly
  up and down the room. "Why, the Prince himself, of course," he cried. "Azoff
  and his companions knew that all the time. They also knew that the Czar was
  in England, and they were perfectly well aware what he came for. As those
  people belong to the corrupt Court party, it was absolutely essential to move
  the Prince out of the way. Therefore they managed to get into his house and
  plant their own servants there. Then they, fearful perhaps that he should
  tumble to their scheme, set out to kidnap him and keep him a prisoner in his
  own residence. The thing was audacious and yet so absurdly simple. As soon as
  ever I looked at the Directory last night, I guessed exactly what had
  happened. I had my suspicions before, mind you, for I had a swift glimpse of
  Gassells when he was changing dresses with me. No wonder, my dear fellow,
  that this shabby old 'Levetsky' was in a position to come down to your office
  and give you these wonderful pieces of exclusive information. You will also
  see why he was so anxious for it to be known that the Czar was in London.
  Depend upon it, before many days are over, both of us will hear from St.
  Petersburg, from the Prince direct. And now, my dear chap, if you cannot make
  a really interesting column out of what I have just told you, why, you are
  not the brilliant and versatile journalist that I take you for."</p>

  <p>Wickham grinned as he reached for a pad of copy-paper and a quill pen. The
  light of inspiration that gleamed from behind his golden spectacles was
  striking. He held out a warm hand to Clifford.</p>

  <p>"I can't thank you now," he said. "I am going to be exceedingly busy for
  the next hour or two. Good night, my pearl of Secret Service agents, and
  pleasant dreams to you!"</p><br>

     name="story10">10.&mdash;THE BALANCE OF NATURE</a></h2>

  <h3>ILLUSTRATED BY GILBERT HOLIDAY</h3>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Windsor Magazine</i>, Vol. XXVI, Oct 1907, pp
  557-567</h3><br>

  <p class="first">THE tragic circumstances in which Professor Egerton Street
  disappeared from London and the world of science, of which he was such a
  distinguished ornament, are not generally known to the public. Most people
  are under the impression that the eclipse followed as a natural consequence
  on the sudden death of Mrs. Street, but a few people knew that the tragedy
  was precipitated by the professor himself. He was supposed to have injected a
  certain serum&mdash;previously tried upon his own person&mdash;and the death
  of the lady was due to septic poisoning.</p>

  <p>Be that as it may, the circumstances never became public property. Most
  people looked upon the whole thing as an accident. Anyway, Street disappeared
  from University College Hospital, and his place knew him no more. He was
  supposed to be pursuing a series of studies in West Africa with the view to
  the stamping out of malarial fever, but that, after all, was only a rumour.
  Street had been a rather dour kind of enthusiast, very secretive, and
  possessing practically no friends. Basil Warburton, the entomologist, had
  seen him once at Liverpool Street Station with a variety of cases that gave
  him the air of a travelling naturalist. The two savants had exchanged a few
  words, but Street had not been communicative. He looked lean and brown and
  hollow-eyed; he gave just a hint of certain new discoveries. He wanted to
  know if Warburton had heard anything of a certain new red
  spider&mdash;locally called the "Red Speck "&mdash;an account of which had
  filtered home from Madagascar. As it happened, Warburton had not only heard
  of the spider, but he actually possessed a few live specimens. He says that
  Street's face lighted up in the most extraordinary manner on hearing
  this.</p>

  <p>"You will be doing me&mdash;you will be doing the world in general an
  inestimable service if you will come down to my place at Crawley and bring a
  'Red Speck ' or two with you. Warburton, I am on the eve of realising a most
  stupendous discovery. If my deductions are correct, malarial fever is at an
  end. Those fellows are quite correct&mdash;the mosquito and kindred insects
  are at the bottom of the mischief. I've been digging at the remedy for two
  years, and I've touched bottom. It would be an insult to your intelligence to
  ask you if you have heard of insect grafting."</p>

  <p>Warburton replied that he had experimented in that direction himself.
  Articles on the subject had appeared in several of the leading domestic
  magazines. The thing was a little flashy and meretricious, and no good was
  likely to result from it. Warburton proceeded to speak of a hybrid dragon-fly
  he had grafted, but the larvae had perished, probably had not fructified.
  Street's eyes gleamed.</p>

  <p>"I've conquered that," he whispered. "I've reached the breeding stage of
  the hybrid. The thing is not ripe for the public gaze yet, but I'll show it
  to you. Come down on Friday and spend a week-end at Crawley with me, and
  bring your red spiders along."</p>

  <p>The offer was too tempting to be refused. Besides, Street was no pauper
  genius, but a well-to-do man in a position to carry out his experiments
  regardless of outlay. Warburton found the house pleasantly situated, the long
  ranges of glass had been stripped of vine and fern and flower, and given over
  entirely to the breeding of insects. It was rather a chilly March day, with
  fitful bursts of warm sunshine, so that Warburton found the glass-houses
  unpleasantly warm ever and again.</p>

  <p>Street had certainly mastered his subject. He seemed to have every kind of
  insect in his greenhouses. In one warm corner, behind a series of thin muslin
  cloths, a cloud of gauzy little creatures seemed to sing and buzz in the
  still air.</p>

  <p>"Mosquitoes?" Warburton suggested. "Well, they could do very little harm
  at this time of the year if they escaped. But where did they come from? I
  could localise every mosquito known to science, but I never saw any that size
  before."</p>

  <p>"I bred them myself," Street proceeded to explain. "The original stock was
  grafted. Watch, and you will see that the wings are different. There is a
  dash of the tsetse fly in those fellows. I've had an arm as thick as your
  thigh from a hite of theirs. What do you think of them?"</p>

  <p>Street led the way into another compartment of the greenhouse. The heat
  was unpleasant; the floor was of sand with fragments of volcanic rock
  scattered here and there. With the aid of a stick, Street stirred up the
  stones, and immediately a colony of tarantulas straddled over the sandy
  floor.</p>

  <p>"Nothing wonderful about them," the professor remarked. "But you will see
  presently why I need them. Roughly speaking, my idea is to kill malaria by a
  war of extermination. Devise or breed some insect that will prey on the
  mosquito <i>et hoc</i>. Of course, you will argue that the remedy is as bad
  as the disease. That we shall see. What I want to get hold of by grafting is
  a slow-breeding insect that will be easy to grapple with when he has done his
  work. But he is to be a ferocious, poisonous fellow, and to a certain extent
  a clean feeder. I mean he need not be wholly carnivorous. Now suppose we take
  the Mexican hornet, which is one of the most dangerous of his tribe. Then we
  want a little of the tenacious ferocity of the spider, and here the tarantula
  comes in. My ideal warrior must be strong of flight and quick on the wing,
  and here enters the dragon-fly. This element gives the slow breed&mdash;for
  dragon-flies only come to maturity at the end of three years. Does this sound
  very weird to you?"</p>

  <p>"No," Warburton said thoughtfully. "Nothing sounds extravagant to the
  scientiflc mind. Yours is going to be by way of a water insect as well.
  Still, even if you have succeded in producing fruitful hybrids, the ideal
  insect is the work of a lifetime."</p>

  <p>"It is the work of exactly three years," Street said quietly. "The problem
  is solved, and the warm bursts of sunshine the last few days have done it. I
  have never mentioned the matter to a soul before, but I am going to let you
  into my confidence. The third generation, the perfected thing, has hatched
  out in a glory that was beyond all my dreams. Come and see."</p>

  <p>Street led the way to the far end of the greenhouse, where a part of the
  dome roof had been removed. The heat was tempered by the outer air, yet it
  stood well up to 80 degrees. In one corner was a large gauze wire cage, not
  unlike a huge meat-safe, and hanging from the far wall were a series of
  soft-looking balls that closely resembled the nest of the mason wasp, though
  they were on a much larger scale. The sides of the blotting-paper structures
  were honeycombed like a sandbank where a colony of martins had built their
  nests. There was no sound of life until the little terrier hanging on
  Street's heels snapped at a fly and struck the wire gauze with his paws. Then
  the unseen colony set up a short, pinging hum, something like the screams of
  a flight of rifle bullets. From a shelf behind him Street took a little brown
  mouse from its cage. Swiftly he lifted the door of the exaggerated meat-safe
  and deposited the mouse inside.</p>

  <p>A moment later and an insect darted from one of the honeycombs. The
  darting beat of its red wings hummed in the silence of the greenhouse like a
  hawk. Warburton was loud in his admiration&mdash;he had never seen anything
  like it before.</p>

  <p>The creature was some nine inches from tip to tip of those wonderful
  translucent amber and purple wings. They trembled and flashed like jewels in
  the light. The body of the insect was some five inches, marked like a hornet
  for half the distance, the tail being covered with fine, down-like feathers,
  and tinted from bright red to brilliant peacock blue. The eyes were of deep
  green, the long legs were curved as the talons of a hawk. Warburton's
  admiration was absolutely justified and sincere. He had never seen anything
  like it before. It was so beautiful and yet so repulsive, so soft and
  noiseless, yet so tigerishly suggestive.</p>

  <p>"You have not boasted in vain," he said. "Your hybrid is perfect, if, as
  you say, this is the third generation. Born here from the parent stock? Then
  there is no limit to the monsters of scientific creation. Is&mdash;is he
  dangerous?"</p>

  <p>By way of reply. Street pointed to the mouse huddled up on the bottom of
  the cage. The little animal seemed to be half dead with fear. The big hawk
  poised over him, swooped delicately, and his curved beak seemed to meet for
  an instant in the fur of the tiny rodent's shoulder. It was all in the
  twinkling of an eye, the brilliant fly was poising again, but the mouse was
  dead... Hardened scientist as he was, Warburton could not repress a
  shudder.</p>

  <p>"They're hungry," Street said in his level voice. "What do they eat?
  Insects mostly. They are particularly fond of mosquitoes. Those fellows are
  going to exterminate them. They are only a means to an end. But they will eat
  honey and small grain and fruit. Mind you, there is a crumpled rose-leaf in
  every couch, and the poisonous quality of those fellows is a little beyond my
  expectation. I suppose it is the mixture of the acid poisons of the tarantula
  and Mexican hornet in their blood. Would their bite be fatal to man? Yes, it
  would. There are over ten thousand of those fellows in that collection of
  nests, though you would not think it. When I have succeeded in reducing their
  poisonous qualities, I shall export them to the mosquito swamps, and I'm much
  mistaken if they don't root out the mosquito and their tribe pretty quickly.
  Fancy that little beast getting loose in England at this time of year! Fancy
  a full nest of them in any hedgerow in the autumn!"</p>

  <p>Warburton did not fancy it, and shuddered again. But the scientist was
  uppermost at the time.</p>

  <p>"I should like to have a look at that mouse," he said. "I should like to
  know precisely the qualities and quantities of the poison that killed him.
  I'll take the body to Longstaff, and let him make an analysis, if you like. I
  fancy it would be worth while."</p>

  <p>The idea struck Street as a good one. Very carefully he lifted the door of
  the cage and reached for the body of the mouse. But the little terrier was
  before him. The dog rushed in, banging furiously against the side of the
  cage. Street rose, unthinkingly, in his desire to recover the dog, so that
  the cage rocked and reeled, and with a scream as of a thousand flying
  bullets, the great quivering insects came pelting from the nests. How it all
  happened nobody knew. Warburton could never tell, but an instant later the
  cage was overturned, and the dome of the glasshouse was alive with a swarm of
  some thousands of the great insects. They rose higher and higher, darting and
  weaving in and out like a lovely pattern of perfect colouring. The humming
  scream of their anger was almost majestic. Faint and sick, Street was bending
  to and fro, holding his arm as if in some deadly pain.</p>

  <p>"Quick!" he gasped. "I'm done for! One of them got me through the wrist. I
  had more or less been prepared for something of this kind. Look at the last
  few pages of Volume VI. of&mdash;"</p>

  <p><a id="pic24"
     name="pic24"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1300951h-images/TheBalanceOfNature1.jpg"
         title="'Quick!' he gasped. 'I'm done for!'">
  </div><br>

  <p>Street collapsed on the floor, his sentence unfinished. Whether he was
  dead or alive Warburton did not know&mdash;he did not even seem to care. He
  was too fascinated to be frightened&mdash;he could not keep his eyes off that
  tangled, angry mass of lovely colour up in the dome. Death and destruction
  and hideous nightmare of terror lurked there. Then one of the amazing
  creatures darted through the dome light and poised in the air, the great
  purple and gold and amber cloud followed, and shone in the open air like some
  glorious rainbow of hues. And Street lay there dead and stark at the feet of
  his colleague.</p>

  <p>Warburton crept outside, feeling sick and faint and shaky from the play of
  his imagination. Here was a deadly peril, such a peril as was sure to follow
  sooner or later upon the attempt to destroy the balance of nature. If a
  thousand or so of man-eating tigers had been let loose in Sussex, the effect,
  would have been less deadly and more paralysing than the escape of those
  beautiful insects. They were darting and playing now like a nimbus about the
  crown of a group of elm trees. Warburton could hear the pinging scream of
  their wings. They looked unutterably beautiful in the brilliant burst of
  sunshine, a thing of beauty terribly fascinating. But if they began to attack
  human life!</p>

  <p>It would be impossible to fight the winged queens of the air. They could
  go like the wind whither they listed, bringing death and destruction
  everywhere. They were built for rapid flight&mdash;they might hold London
  captive one night and strike terror into Birmingham the next.</p>

  <p>But Warburton had to pull himself together, he had to think of Street. The
  professor was dead enough, there were four or five livid red and white spots
  on his neck, as if the flesh had been cruelly gripped by a pair of pincers.
  The victim lay there quite peacefully, with a shadowy smile on his face.
  Death must have come very swiftly.</p>

  <p>With the aid of a gardener, Warburton conveyed the body to the house. It
  was necessary to go through the formula of sending for a doctor, and that was
  a matter of time. Warburton would fetch his own man from town. This was
  outside the ken of the general practitioner. If only the trains had fitted in
  a little less awkwardly! Was there such a thing as a cycle about the house?
  The professor's motor-cycle was in its accustomed shed. Warburton grasped at
  the idea of action. He could ride to town on that. Anything to be doing
  something. Probably he would be back again before the local man arrived.
  Warburton sped along by way of Redhill and Reigate in the direction of
  London. It was borne in upon him presently that the roads were strangely
  deserted for the time of day. Nothing could be seen or heard for a long time,
  till the crest of a rise in the road disclosed a motor standing outside a
  blacksmith's shop. Warburton could hear the car humming as he raced
  along.</p>

  <p>Two men coated in leather and hideously masked, racing men evidently,
  stood just inside the door. There was an air of excitement about them that
  Warburton did not fail to notice. One of the grotesque figures hailed him.
  From the Rembrandt shadows of the smithy a pair of hobnailed boots protruded,
  as if the rest of the owner had fallen there, overcome with beer.</p>

  <p>"He's dead," one of the motor men jerked out. "Pulled up here just now for
  spanner, and found him lying like that. Have you seen anything of them?"</p>

  <p>Warburton guessed what was meant. On the hood of the car he could discern
  a squashed yellow and red body or two, then caught in the sunshine the
  flutter of gauzy amber wings.</p>

  <p>"<i>Delirium tremens</i>, gone mad," the other man said shakily. "What do
  you say to the car being attacked by a million of insects as big as a
  partridge and coloured like a poet's dream? Loveliest sight I have ever
  seen&mdash; at first. I made a grab at one, and he bit through my glove as if
  it had been a rose-leaf. Then the whole blooming lot made for us&mdash;quite
  a million of 'em. Frightened? Well, I should say so. But we were in armour,
  so to speak, and managed to beat them off. Got a couple of beautiful
  specimens, too, as dead as Queen Anne. And then we find the blacksmith dead,
  too. Perhaps they went for <i>him</i>.</p>

  <p>Warburton fought down the physical sickness that seemed to hold him in a
  grip. As he dragged the dead smith to the light, he did not fail to notice
  the pincer-like mark on the flesh of the swarthy neck. One of the squashed
  hybrids was tightly grasped in his hand. Warburton asked feebly which way the
  swarm had gone. The motor driver pathetically requested to be given an easier
  one. Despite his forced hilarity, he was shaking like a leaf. He affirmed
  that he wanted London badly.</p>

  </div>

  <p>"And so do I," Warburton said between his teeth. "As it happens, I can
  tell you all about the business. Find the spanner and make your repairs. It
  sounds inhuman, but we must let that poor fellow lie there for the present.
  Get a move on you. I'll come along."</p>

  <p>But the news had reached London first, the whole grotesque, maddening
  tragedy was being yelled by the newsboys along the Embankment. There was a
  telegram at his rooms waiting for Warburton from Crawley, saying that the
  inquest on Street would not be for a day or two, contrary to precedent.
  Before eight o'clock, the family of the unhappy smith had been interviewed;
  there was a column from an eye-witness, who had watched the attack on Mr.
  Cyrus A. Blyder's motor. A taxidermist in Holborn had a specimen of the
  deadly hybrid in his window, and the police were busy at the spot. Warburton
  himself was given over to the interviewers, who literally tore him to pieces.
  He had not meant to say anything, but he did not know the manners of the
  class. As a matter of fact, he told everything&mdash;and a great deal
  more.</p>

  <p>The odd millions who had gone to bed overnight in ignorance of the new
  terror had it served up piping hot for breakfast next morning. A few more odd
  tragedies had dribbled in during the small hours. A rabbit-poacher at Esher
  had blundered into the clutch of a swarm sleeping on an elder bush, and his
  body, terribly distorted, had been found by a half-imbecile colleague in
  crime. Such is the effect produced on the nation by a cheap, pessimistic
  Press that thousands of people absented themselves from work during the day.
  But as the hours crept on, courage returned till midday, when the news spread
  like wildfire that a number of insects had been seen in a confectioner's shop
  in Regent Street. Curiosity overcame fear for the moment, and a rush was made
  westward. Surely enough, the news was true. Half-a-dozen pretty
  shop-assistants stood pale and frightened on the pavement, inside the shop
  something was humming and pinging and darting like a beautiful humming-bird
  poised over a vase of flowers. Presently something boomed overhead like the
  zipping song of many telegraph-wires in a gale of wind, and, as if by magic,
  the smart confectioner's shop was a veritable aviary of the beautiful
  hybrids. A thoughtless 'bus-driver made a slash at a darting insect with his
  whip, and instantly the gorgeous thing hummed at him and struck him in the
  throat.</p>

  <p>With a scream of fear and pain, the man dropped from his box and lay
  writhing in the road. It was a crisp, clear day, but the unhappy driver was
  bathed in perspiration. He seemed to be frantic, half mad with the pain that
  he was suffering. He tore wildly at his collar, his lips were dripping with
  foam. But he did not die, as the professor and the smith had done, though the
  maddening pain was likely to produce complete physical exhaustion.</p>

  <p>"He can't endure agony like that much longer," someone said, pushing his
  way through the crowd. "I'm a doctor. Bring him along to the nearest
  chemist's shop. This is a case for the hypodermic syringe and ether. It may
  be the means of saving the poor fellow's life."</p>

  <p>There was no occasion to ask the crowd to stand aside. Fear had overcome
  curiosity, and the mob had melted into the air. The loot of the
  confectioner's shop was pretty well done by this time, the darkening air was
  humming again with the darting hybrids. Like wasps and bees, and others of
  their tribe, they might have been expected to seek some dark corner for
  shelter and rest, but possibly the glare of the electric lights had excited
  them. Never, perhaps, had the streets of the West End been so deserted as
  they were now. London had scuttled home like a colony of frightened rabbits
  directly darkness had set in; a creeping policeman or two along the
  Embankment discovered here and there a solitary hybrid banging his beautiful
  head against the arc lights, the buzzing of its wings making a weird
  sound.</p>

  <p>All the same, the legislators of the country could not stand still merely
  because a brilliant and eccentric scientist had invented a new hybrid by the
  process of insect grafting. Most patriotic members of Parliament walked to
  their duties, for coachmen generally had flatly refused to turn out in the
  dark. The theatres might have closed their doors, for all the business they
  were doing; the music-halls were deserted. Some genius had suggested the
  arming of the police in Parliament Street with rackets, and this had been
  done. There had been up to ten o'clock a total bag of sixty hybrids. And
  there were still some ten thousand of them at large in London.</p>

  <p>About ten o'clock the serenity of the House of Commons was marred by
  sounds of distress proceeding from the direction of the kitchen. A flying
  squadron of the hybrids had attacked the provisions there, and had been
  driven off by the pungent smoke of burnt brown paper. They came darting and
  hawking along the Corridor into the Chamber itself, poising high overhead
  like a flight of beautiful birds. The hum of their wings spoke of anger. An
  honourable member paused in his speech, and hastily made a truncheon of the
  newspaper from which he was quoting. Two of the gleaming terrors came in
  angry conflict, and dropped flopping and struggling on the table in front of
  the Speaker.</p>

  <p>Dignity could stand it no longer. There was a mad rush from the Chamber.
  Outside, a big, sweating policeman was vigorously fighting off one of the foe
  with his racket. Professor Clements, member for St. Peter's, turned the
  collar of his coat up and called for a hansom. But no hansom was to be seen,
  so the savant had to make his way to Warburton's lodgings on foot. Warburton,
  tired and fagged, had just returned from Crawley. He had been down to the
  inquest on Street, he explained. Of course, the inquiry was adjourned, as it
  was likely to be many times yet.</p>

  <p>"That's what I came to see you about," Clements said. "It is pretty
  fortunate that there is one man who can tell me the source of this diabolical
  invasion. What beautiful, Satanic things they are! And yet the whole idea is
  so disgustingly horrible. Fancy one of those things dropping on your face
  when you are asleep! The mere idea fills me with terror. Surely, Street must
  have been mad when he was inspired by this thing."</p>

  <p>"I don't think so," Warburton said thoughtfully. "The root idea was
  logical enough&mdash;a way of exterminating the malarial insect with a
  slow-growing hybrid that man would successfully combat afterwards. I have no
  doubt that Street foresaw some such danger, and had schemed a way of meeting
  it. But, unfortunately, he had not time nor opportunity of telling me."</p>

  <p>"Then you think that there is some way out of the mess?" Clements said.
  "If they were wild beasts, or anything of that kind , if they were merely
  malarial germs that we could fight with recognised weapons! But with those
  wonderfully flighted insects we are quite powerless. In eight-and-forty hours
  they will spread all over the kingdom. Having some of the habits of the wasp,
  they will break up into colonies and build nests. And what human agency have
  we to fight those nests? The loathsome, lovely creatures may take it into
  their heads to make an enemy of man. Good Heavens! the mere suggestion throws
  me into a cold perspiration."</p>

  <p>"I dare say we shall find some way," Warburton began feebly. "And no
  doubt&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but the horror of it! You think that Street&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow. Street was no blind enthusiast, who let his heart get the
  better of his head."</p>

  <p>"Have you thought of looking amongst his papers and notes for anything
  likely to?"</p>

  <p>Warburton jumped to his feet with a cry. A sudden light had broken in upon
  him.</p>

  <p>"What a dolt I am!" he exclaimed. "I never thought of that. Why, as soon
  as the accident happened, Street turned to me and said something. What did he
  say? Ah, yes. 'Look at the last few pages of Volume VI. of&mdash;' alluding
  to his diary, no doubt. Come along, Clements."</p>

  <p>"Where are you going at this time of the night?" Clements asked.</p>

  <p>"Crawley," Warburton cried. "To inspect Volume VI. of poor Street's diary
  right away. We must get there at once, if we have to take a special
  train."</p>

  <p>As it turned out, the special train to Crawley was necessary. It was no
  time for nice ceremonies, and Warburton ordered it without delay. An anxious
  superintendent stated that the enterprise would cost the voyagers
  nothing.</p>

  <p>"Our directors ought to be glad to place half of our stock at the disposal
  of you gentlemen," he said. "Anything so long as you are trying to put an end
  to the state of terror. Why, since early this afternoon our main line of
  trains have been positively empty. Nobody is coming to London at present. A
  few insects holding up a big city like this! Seems almost incredible, doesn't
  it?"</p>

  <p>It did, but there it was. Still, there was consolation in the idea that
  these two scientists were doing something as the special flew on into the
  darkness. There was a momentary stoppage at Three Bridges owing to a mineral
  train on the track; there was an unusual bustle going on in the small
  station, considering the time of night. Warburton leant eagerly out of the
  carriage windows. A couple of porters were busily engaged in pouring a stream
  of water from a hydrant into one of the waiting-rooms.</p>

  <p>"We've got three of those beastly flies in there," the stationmaster
  explained. "We're trying to drown them out. There's a nice crisp touch in the
  air to-night."</p>

  <p><a id="pic26"

         title="'We've got three of those beastly flies in there,'">
  </div><br>

  <p>Warburton started as a sudden idea came to him, but he said nothing to his
  companion. They were very silent until Street's house was reached. The place
  was absolutely deserted, for the servants had vanished. Nobody could be
  persuaded to face the hidden dangers of the house. Who could tell what
  dreadful monster would rise next? Street's body had been conveyed to an
  adjacent hotel, his own place was dark and desolate. Warburton settled the
  matter by breaking a window and entering the house that way. He fumbled about
  until he touched the electric switch, and presently the whole place way
  flooded with light, Street had had a full installation even into the
  greenhouses.</p>

  <p>There were cases and cages all over the house. Even in what was the
  drawing-room Warburton and his companion could see those great safe-kind of
  arrangements from which the deadly hybrids had escaped. Clements idly rattled
  one with a stick, and instantly the whole structure hummed like a hive of
  angry bees. Quaint things like little flying lizards darted against the
  bars.</p>

  <p>"This is as bad as <i>delirium tremens</i>," Clements murmured. "Now, what
  are those abortions, for instance? Are they intended to be for some good
  purpose, or are they as deadly dangerous as the hybrids? We dare not pry too
  far, because we don't know. And the only man who does know is dead. To clear
  the place and render it safe&mdash;why, good gracious! there may be thousands
  of eggs and larvse hatching at this house, not necessarily dangerous in their
  present condition, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I've found a way to deal with them," Warburton said hoarsely. "It's a
  desperate, not to say a drastic, remedy, but we shall have the approval of
  the State. Let us get this creepy business over as soon as possible,
  Clements. Come to the library and find the diaries. I am hoping that we may
  discover the balm of Gilead there."</p>

  <p>The amateur housebreakers were only concerned with the sixth volume of
  Street's diaries. There was a mass of figures and calculations there that
  conveyed nothing to anybody but the writer, but towards the end of the
  paper-covered volume came something like a concise account of the apotheosis
  of the hybrids. At some length the origin of their being was set out, and
  then the measures by which they were to be successfully combated when their
  work was done.</p>

  <p>"By Jove! the thing is fairly simple," Warburton cried. "I can see nothing
  here that speaks of an antidote to the bite of the creature. But they can be
  rendered harmless by the application of ammonia and eucalyptus to the
  skin&mdash;in fact, Street says that they will fly in terror before it, I
  should like to see the experiment tried. Come to the laboratory."</p>

  <p>The necessary ingredients were found and mixed in the proportions set out,
  and then were rubbed by each man on his hands and face and neck. It was just
  possible that a close search of the greenhouses would discover another case
  of the beautiful hybrids. There were many cages picked out by the flare of
  the electric light, and many strange colonies of insects disturbed, before
  Warburton's eyes lighted on one of the zinc safes with a couple of the
  peculiar blotting-paper nests inside. A vigorous shaking filled the cage with
  a tangled, angry knot of dazzling colour. The screams of vibrating wings
  hummed in the air. Beating down the terror that possessed him, Warburton
  thrust his hand into the small door at the top of the cage. The insects
  darted back from him, one hit the top of the cage and fell back upon his
  sweating, pungent palm. It was all he could do to keep from screaming. It was
  hard to have full faith in the dead man's remedy.</p><br>

  <p><a id="pic27"
     name="pic27"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1300951h-images/TheBalanceOfNature4.jpg"
         title="Warburton thrust his hand into the small door.">
  </div><br>

  <p>But nothing happened. The great insect lay on the sticky palm, its wings
  palpitating gently. The long, beautifully marked body was bent backwards,
  then the wings were absolutely stilled. Warburton pulled his hand from the
  cage and dropped the hybrid on the floor.</p>

  <p>"Dead," he said calmly. He was outwardly cool enough, though his lip was
  torn where the teeth had met it. "Dead as a door-nail. Paralysed by the odour
  given off from the compound, I expect. Clements, we've got to see this thing
  through now. You keep those diabolical flies stirred up to a pretty passion
  whilst I get a spray. We'll try it on the whole lot."</p>

  <p>Clements nodded his approval of the suggestion. With a stick he kept the
  hive in a state of commotion. The wings of the creatures screamed angrily,
  the whole space was a dazzling flash of kaleidoscopic colour. It was very
  repulsive, and yet strangely, weirdly beautiful. Warburton came back
  presently with a fully charged bottle of spray in his hand. At a distance of
  a yard he proceeded to discharge the fine spray into the cage. The effect was
  like magic, the scream of those opalescent wings ceased, on the instant a
  cloud of insects sank to the bottom of the cage and lay there, a tangled heap
  of dead creatures. Warburton broke out into extravagant joy.</p>

  <p>"Settled the whole business," he said. "In the cause of science, mind you,
  it is a pity. In the interests of humanity we should have preserved some of
  those creatures. But the country wouldn't stand it&mdash;the terror is too
  great. Still, if we can show the people quickly there is a sure and certain
  way out of the danger, why&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Better not," Clements said thoughtfully. "No good ever came yet, and no
  good ever will come, by interfering with the balance of Nature. The demon
  that scotches the demon is always the worst demon of the lot. The winged
  terror has been bad enough, especially now that the master hand controlling
  it is no more. Street was thorough in his methods, he was a fanatic in the
  cause of science. And Heaven only knows what new horrors are concealed in
  those breeding-cages, and the larvae we found in those novel incubators in
  the boiler-house. Street knows, and he is dead. If we destroy
  everythinig&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We are going to," Warburton said grimly. "Let's go and find a bed
  somewhere&mdash; my nerves are pretty steady, but I would not sleep in this
  house for a V.C. Come along."</p>

  <p>Warburton got through to London on the telephone early the next day, and
  the result of his interview with the Board of Agriculture and Spring Gardens
  was quite satisfactory. He would be back in town as earlv as possible, he
  said. But, meanwhile, there was much to be done. He was going to take the law
  into his own hands. A load or two of straw and a few gallons of paraffin were
  all that Warburton needed. Half an hour later, and Street's late residence,
  including his long stretch of glass, was a mass of calcined ruins. What
  secrets those grey ashes held would never be known...</p>

  <p>It was late in the afternoon before Warburton and Clements reached London.
  There were more people in the streets than there had been yesterday, for the
  secret of the cure had been proclaimed, and some of the bolder spirits were
  venturing out again. The air reeked with the smell of mingled eucalyptus and
  ammonia. One of the evening papers had an account of the manner in which a
  County Council labourer covered with the mixture had tackled a score of the
  hybrids in a Mayfair house, and had overcome them with the greatest ease.</p>

  <p>But there were nearly ten thousand of the insects to be accounted for, and
  people generally had not forgotten the horrors of the past few hours. A large
  concourse of interested spectators had gathered in the operating-theatre of
  the Metropohtan Hospital to see Warburton deal with a few of the hybrids
  taken in the butterfly nets for the special occasion. Half an hour later, an
  eager throng of men were scouring London, prepared to deal with the evil,
  when met. The run on ammonia and eucalyptus severely taxed the resources of
  the chemists' shops. Warburton looked thoughtfully contented as he walked to
  his rooms. He saw that the sky was clear, and that the sun was going down
  like a red ball in the west.</p>

  <p>"The elements are coming to our assistance," he said. "If this weather
  goes on for eight-and-forty hours longer, the situation is absolutely saved.
  I'm sending a letter to the Central Press and Press Association to-night,
  asking them to see that it appears in every morning and evening paper in
  England to-morrow. See you later."</p>

  <p>It was exactly how Warburton had hoped and asked for. His letter called
  attention to the fact that a severe frost seemed imminent, and that it looked
  likely to last for a day or two. If the frost maintained itself, it would be
  the duty of every householder to search his premises, and see that they
  entertained no specimen of the deadly hybrid. If they were driven out of
  doors, the first sharp frost would be fatal to them. They were bred
  practically from tropical insects, and therefore they could not stand cold.
  At the same time, it would be only prudent to see that the insects were quite
  dead, and not merely torpid. It was necessary, also, for everybody who found
  even one of the hybrids to report the fact to the Board of Agriculture. Not
  one of them must be left alive. An open window and the faintest touch of</p>

  <p>ammonia and eucalyptus would be sufficient to drive the insects into the
  open air.</p>

  <p>At the end of twenty-four hours the figures began to come in. Between
  London and Bedhill over eight thousand five hundred of the insects had been
  found, either dead or torpid, a great number of them being discovered
  clinging to the arches of the bridges over the river. The wave of terror
  rolled back, and London became itself again. To the satisfaction of
  everybody, the frost continued, so that on the morning of the second day over
  nine thousand seven hundred and fifty of the lovely hybrids had been
  accounted for. An odd specimen or two drifted here and there for the next
  week, and then eight days passed without further result. Beyond the few
  specimens kept and preserved at South Kensington, none remained.</p>

  <p>"I fancy the danger is over," Warburton said to Clements, as they lunched
  together a few days later at the Athenaeum Club. "And yet it seems a pity,
  too."</p>

  <p>"Great pity," Clements agreed, "It's a thousand pities, too, that Street
  died in so tragic a manner, for, unless I am greatly mistaken, a great secret
  perished with him. I would have given much to see the fight between the
  hybrids and the mosquitoes on the Gold Coast. And yet the situation would not
  have been without its terrors."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Warburton asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, those hybrids would have increased in size in that congenial
  atmosphere. They would have developed habits of their own. And Street, after
  all, was working on a theory. Fancy a dozen of those hybrids as big as an
  eagle&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't!" Warburton shuddered. "The horror was quite bad enough as Street
  evolved it."</p><br>
