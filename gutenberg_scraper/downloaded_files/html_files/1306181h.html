  <p class="first">INTO what a troubled world was I born in the year of grace
  1800! Ireland in revolt and defeated at Vinegar Hill, their French allies in
  the hands of Lord Cornwallis and an Act of Union forced upon her; the echoes
  of Napoleon's defeat in Palestine and the glorious thunders of Nelson's guns
  at Alexandria still reverberating; Italy crushed by Bonaparte at Marengo and
  overrun; Austria shattered by the same masterly hand, and Britain alone, but
  triumphant.</p>

  <p>My father has often told me of the stirring events which had come before
  my birth, of the terrible revolution in France which had inflamed the world
  against the murderers of King Louis, and of how this Napoleon Bonaparte, a
  young officer of artillery, had first given the quietus to the dying revolt
  by "a whiff of grape shot" that finally destroyed the resistance to the
  central government. In a word, Bonaparte had shown the attributes of a great
  general and had produced from the wreckage and chaos of the revolution an
  authority which had the support of military strength and the approval of the
  majority of French people.</p>

  <p>So that whilst all the nations of Europe had at first been stricken with
  horror at the excesses of the revolutionaries, and had drawn their swords to
  avenge the unhappy Louis and his beautiful consort, they were now compelled
  to sharpen those swords to defend themselves against the menace of order
  which, most surprisingly, came out of the confusion. Some there were that
  elected to fight, some to intrigue, some to fight first and parley
  afterwards, well content that their allies should be embarrassed thereby, and
  one alone that offered no arbitration but the dread adjustments of battle.
  And this country, to our honour and glory, was Great Britain (as it had been
  called since the days of Anne).</p>

  <p>A troubled world indeed, and even as I lay newly born in my nurse's arms,
  the coach drew up before the Mitre Inn at Norwich and the guard threw out the
  broad-sheets which told of Nelson's glorious battle of Copenhagen, wherein
  assailed by the fire of a thousand guns and with only twelve ships of the
  line, three of which grounded before the battle, he silenced the Danish
  batteries and brought about the submission of the city. In this battle it is
  said that, ordered by his superior officer, Sir Hyde Parker, to retire, he
  put his telescope to his blind eye and said:</p>

  <p>"I do not see the signal. Keep mine for 'closer battle' flying&mdash;nail
  it to the mast!"</p>

  <p>Such was this time of stress and doubt.</p>

  <p>About my own family affairs it may be proper here to speak. There were
  three families of Avons: my own, which was called the Old Avons, living in
  Norfolk at that very manor which has been described by my ancestor, Henry
  Avon, of Elizabeth's days; there were the Bedford Avons, the head of which
  was the grandson of that William who was the writer of the narrative of the
  Stuarts; and the third branch, which we call the Black branch, because it has
  produced so many swarthy members of our race; this had its home in
  Hampshire.</p>

  <p>Between my father, Henry Anthony Avon, and the head of the Black House,
  who was Sir John Avon, Baronet, there was, in the year before I was born, a
  great coolness, which was to develop almost to a bitter quarrel. And it arose
  in this way: Sir John had served in Ireland and had seen the pitiable
  condition of the people, and had realized how horrid a thing was the law
  which had been made in the days of William and Mary, whereby no Irish
  Catholic was allowed either to sit in Parliament, to vote for a Member, to
  occupy any position under government, or even to own a horse worth more than
  £5. The situation of these unfortunate peasants was cruel in the extreme, and
  the tyranny exercised by the Protestants was such as no honest man could
  tolerate. So that the Irish people were virtually outlaws and beggars; and it
  was Sir John who, coming back from Ireland, had pleaded with Mr. Pitt, the
  chief minister of His Majesty King George III., that their lot should be
  ameliorated&mdash;not that Mr. Pitt needed any persuasion, for he had the
  genius of government and had long realized how terrible were the conditions
  under which the Catholics lived.</p>

  <p>Then came the rising, and Sir John openly sided with the rebels, to the
  indignation of my father. Hot words passed between them at White's, the club
  of which they were both members. My father accused him of being a Papist,
  which Sir John took amiss, for he was as good a Protestant as ever went to
  communion. A tall, red-haired, red-faced man, with the strength of an ox and
  the courage of a lion, he feared neither popular opinion nor the vengeance of
  the fanatic. Mr. Pitt was so much of his opinion that after the inevitable
  defeat of these wretched Irish Catholics, and the Act of Union between
  Ireland and England which was secured by the liberal bribery of my lord
  Castlereagh, the Prime Minister brought before the King an Act of Catholic
  Emancipation which George, who had already lost America by his obstinacy and
  stupidity, refused to endorse. Good a king as he was in the days of his
  active mentality, he was without vision or foresight. The King would have
  none of the Catholic emancipation, and Mr. Pitt resigned his office to
  Addington, his friend.</p>

  <p>It seems strange to me, looking back through all these years, that two
  good Protestants, as my father was and as undoubtedly was Sir John, should be
  at daggers drawn over the matter of the treatment of Catholics in Ireland.
  But so it was, and when I was born, there came no letter by post from Sir
  John, nor was there any letter from my father a week after, when Sir John's
  son, Harry, was born.</p>

  <p>Addington made a peace with France in 1802, the treaty being signed at
  Amiens, and our country rejoiced after all these years of war. At last we
  were freed from the spectre of ruination which wars bring in their wake. Yet
  that was not the view of the wiser folk and amongst those who did not
  rejoice, as I learned after, was Sir John. Whilst bonfires were burning and
  lights were in all the windows, the manor house in Hampshire was dark.</p>

  <p>"There will be little to please us," said Sir John grimly. "This man
  Bonaparte is not the kind who will grow great on treaties."</p>

  <p>He was a close friend of Mr. William Pitt, who stayed with him in
  Hampshire during the time of his retirement, and he was my uncle's guest when
  the new cause of war arose. You must understand that in these days the
  newspapers had grown in number, and one of these was publishing certain
  violent articles against Bonaparte, at the instigation of the Royalists of
  France, who had fled during the Revolution and were at the time waiting in
  England until they could return.</p>

  <p>Mr. Pitt told my father that Bonaparte was very angry with the newspaper
  articles, and also with the fact that England was harbouring Royalists; and
  within a year after the signing of the Treaty of Amiens, war was declared
  again by Napoleon who marched his armies to Boulogne, ready to invade our
  country, and to this end had innumerable flat-bottomed boats built to carry
  his soldiers to our shores. In consequence there was much building of towers
  (which were called, after the inventor, Martello) along the coasts, and I am
  told that even in Hampshire, people in the villages and towns were ready to
  leave at a minute's notice to fly from the French invader, and had wagons on
  the roads and horses already harnessed to move their goods.</p>

  <p>At this moment Mr. Pitt was recalled to office, and began to stir up
  Europe to take sides against Bonaparte, who had proclaimed himself Emperor of
  the French. Russia and Austria joined, but in 1804 Bonaparte crushed the
  forces of both countries at Austerlitz, and Britain stood alone.</p>

  <p>The shock of Austerlitz killed Pitt.</p>

  <p>"In what straits do I leave my country!" were almost his last
  words.</p><img src="1306181h-images/TBA3-image-1.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p class="first">And now the threat of invasion was very real. Napoleon,
  while he was marching on the Austrians, had ordered the allied French and
  Spanish fleets to move to the West Indies in order to deceive Admiral Nelson
  into following them. Napoleon's plan was for his fleet to double back and
  make for the English Channel to cover the crossing of the army of invasion.
  We were ready enough for this, for the threat of it had brought into
  existence the famous Volunteers. But Nelson saved us from the peril: he
  discovered in time that the French and Spanish fleets had turned, and came
  back after them. Admiral Calder with a small fleet intercepted the returning
  enemy, sank two ships and drove the rest into Cadiz Harbour; and here they
  might have remained, for Villeneuve, the French admiral, realized the peril
  of fighting Nelson's ships, which were now almost in sight. Napoleon,
  however, sent a furious message ordering his admiral to fight, and issuing
  from the harbour the French and Spanish ships came up with the English fleet
  in Trafalgar Bay. Ours were arranged in two lines, at the head of the first
  being Nelson's flagship the "Victory," and at the head of the other Lord
  Collingwood's "Royal Sovereign." When everything was ready for the attack
  Lord Nelson asked Captain Blackwood, his flag captain, if a signal should not
  be made to the whole fleet.</p>

  <p>"My lord," said Captain Blackwood, "I think the Fleet knows well enough
  what it is about."</p>

  <p>Nelson was not satisfied with this, and sent up the signal which, a month
  after, was in everybody's mouth: "England expects that every man will do his
  duty," a signal which was answered with ringing cheers.</p>

  <p>At midday the battle began, and soon after the French "Redoubtable" was
  engaged with the "Victory." In the midst of the action Nelson was stricken
  down, being shot from the cross-trees of the "Redoubtable."</p>

  <p>"They have done for me at last, Hardy," he said to his friend. And, that
  the news of his wound should not discourage his men, he took out his
  handkerchief and covered his face and the decorations he wore on his breast,
  and so was carried below. He lived long enough to know that the British were
  everywhere victorious, and his last words were: "Thank God I have done my
  duty!" Twenty of the French ships struck, and their admiral, Villeneuve, was
  taken prisoner.</p>

  <p>Grenville's ministry had followed Mr. Pitt's, and in this was Mr. Fox, who
  did so much with Mr. Wilberforce to abolish slavery. He fell, for the same
  reason that Mr. Pitt had fallen, that he would not be a party to the
  intolerant attitude towards the Catholics. He was, my father told me, a great
  gambler and a fop, but was well liked by the majority of people. After him
  came Lord Portland and then Mr. Percival.</p>

  <p>I remember dimly, as a child may remember, the death of Mr. Pitt and the
  grief my uncle, who was an admirer of this sublime statesman, felt at this
  tragedy which had come upon England. Possibly the friendship which Sir John
  had enjoyed with him had something to do with the gradual reconciliation
  which came about between the two branches of the family. I remember well, as
  a small boy, sitting open-mouthed whilst my father and my Uncle John
  discussed politics, referring very often to Berlin. I learned many years
  after, when I gave the matter serious thought (for a child does not think
  naturally of political or national affairs, but is more interested in his
  tops and his shuttlecocks) that the subject of discussion was the Berlin
  Decree. Napoleon had beaten the German Army and had quartered himself in
  Berlin, whence he sent out a decree, in which he declared that the British
  Isles were blockaded, and expressly forbade all countries in Europe that had
  been occupied or conquered by France to have any commercial dealings with our
  country. This was the famous continental system, which nearly ruined the
  French as well as the allies of France. In reply, England issued Orders in
  Council, forbidding British vessels to trade between ports in the possession
  of France, and all ports that were forbidden to our trade were declared to be
  in a state of blockade. We also forbade the French to sell their ships to
  neutral powers.</p>

  <p>At this time, Denmark, which had been a neutral state, allowed the French
  to operate against the Prussians from their territory, and it was well
  bruited about that Napoleon had the idea of seizing the Danish Navy and using
  it against us. And so we sent a squadron of ships and an army of twenty
  thousand men to demand an alliance and the surrender of the fleet. When this
  was refused, we opened fire on the town and the fleet was surrendered.</p>

  <p>My uncle's visits now became more frequent and, as he was distantly
  related, through my aunt, to Lord Liverpool, who had succeeded Mr. Percival,
  he heard much that was not generally known to the people. I was still a boy,
  and I remember that so continuous were the wars that I cherished the illusion
  for many years that war was a normal condition.</p>

  <p>One good result of the reconciliation between my father and my Uncle John
  was the opportunity I had of meeting the boy who was born a very short time
  after me. He was taller than I, and slimmer, ours being a stocky breed. We
  liked each other from the very first, and this was fortunate, for we were
  packed off together to the Grammar School at King's Lynn, or, as some call it
  still, Lynn Regis. Here we had lodgings in the house where one of the ushers
  of the school had once lived, a very gentle man called Eugene Aram, about
  whose terrible crime and remorse I had often read, since it formed the
  subject of many ballads.</p>

  <p>In this beautiful old town my cousin and I grew up together, went to our
  lessons, took our drubbings, stole time to fish in the "fleets," as they call
  the little streams, and between our play sought eagerly from the latest
  newsprints. Many a sevenpence have I spent upon a newspaper to find what was
  happening to Sir Arthur Wellesley in the Peninsula (where we were fighting
  Bonaparte, who had seized the Spanish throne); for Sir Arthur was the
  greatest general of our time. By these newsprints, which I still have by me,
  I can trace the wondrous doings of our gallant Army even to this day, and
  have no need for history books to guide me. I see Sir Arthur falling back to
  his prepared line at Torres Vedras before Junot, I see the gallant Sir John
  Moore retreating on Corunna, and the glorious victory of Vittoria, which
  opened the way for the British Army to cross the Pyrenees into France, and
  brought us triumphantly to the siege of Toulouse. My cousin and I were both
  fourteen years of age and advanced well in our studies, when the news of
  Napoleon's abdication reached King's Lynn. It came not by news-sheet, but by
  my Uncle John, who came post from London to my father and called at King's
  Lynn on his way, sending for us to his rooms in the old inn, and giving us a
  glass of wine to drink King George's health.</p>

  <p>"They have packed Bonaparte off to Elba," he said, shaking his head
  gloomily, "but the Lord knows how long he'll stay there. Better for the
  Allies, I think, if they put him against the wall before a firing party!"</p>

  <p>Those who live nowadays cannot realize the horror and abhorrence in which
  Bonaparte's name was held; and though, later, we came to forget his tyrannies
  and his wicked ambitions and thought only of his great prowess and abilities
  as a general, yet such sentiments were heard on every side. Sir Arthur
  Wellesley, who was now the Duke of Wellington, had gone off to Vienna to sit
  on the council which was to settle Europe.</p>

  <p>"But he'll never do it," said my Uncle John, shaking his huge red head
  again. "Not our Duke or any other body's Duke, with all these greedy Italians
  and Dutchmen looking for what they can grab."</p>

  <p>Still it seemed, from the newspapers, that the settlement was a good one,
  and was satisfactory to most, though the conference had not concluded when
  the white-flecked post-horses came galloping into King's Lynn with the news
  that Bonaparte had escaped from Elba and landed in France, and that the
  soldiers of the new French King, Louis, whom the Allies had put on the
  throne, were throwing away their white cockades and joining for the
  Emperor.</p>

  <p>My father being now enfeebled in health, Uncle John spent much of his time
  in Norwich and came frequently to see us, and he took a view of the situation
  which was alarming.</p>

  <p>"Bonaparte," said he, "has beaten every nation in Europe. He has beaten
  the Russians, though they learned a trick from Wellington and retreated
  before him to Moscow, causing him the loss of over three hundred thousand
  men. Yet this is the point, boys: he has beaten them once, and he may do it
  again. He had trounced the Germans and the Italians and the Spaniards, and
  though they cry out now against him, and will send their soldiers to oppose
  his march, in the end it will be old England that will be left to fight him
  alone, and we need every man&mdash;aye, and every boy&mdash;to crush this
  monster."</p>

  <p>"But, Uncle," I made bold to say, "have we not the old soldiers who were
  in the Peninsular War under the great Wellesley?"</p>

  <p>Uncle John shook his head, and told me something which amazed me.</p>

  <p>"We are at war with America, as you know," he said. And of course I knew
  about the second American war, which had come about because the Americans
  resented our searching neutral shipping. I knew, too, that a victorious
  British Army had occupied Washington (a fact which very few people nowadays
  seem to remember).</p>

  <p>"We have sent all our best soldiers to the American War," my uncle went
  on, "and now the Lieutenants of the Counties are hard put to it to find men
  to resist Napoleon; and within a month we shall be sending out raw
  plough-boys in red coats to meet the finest trained soldiers in the
  world!"</p>

  <p>When my uncle had gone, Harry and I had a long and serious talk. Though we
  were but fifteen, we were as tall as most men, and I, for my part, could hold
  my own ground with any townsman.</p>

  <p>"There is only one thing for us to do," said Harry, with great
  determination, "and that is to 'list."</p>

  <p>"Enlist?" I said, aghast at the idea.</p>

  <p>Harry nodded.</p>

  <p>"What else can we do? If we ask our fathers to get us commissions, they
  will laugh at us because we're so young."</p>

  <p>And that was true. Day and night we talked this matter in and out, and at
  last we had a plan. In Brussels was a cousin of ours, a Bedford Avon, who was
  on the staff of the British Ambassador; and as Sir John had told us before
  leaving that the great war would probably be fought out in the Low Countries,
  ours seemed as likely a scheme as any. Our plan was to run away from school,
  taking the day coach to Yarmouth, and there obtaining a passage to Ostend or
  to Flushing. From thence onward we could reach Brussels by coach, and,
  seeking out our kinsman, ask his help to secure us commissions.</p>

  <p>All this discussion took some time. Before it was ended, the way the war
  would go was made apparent. Our soldiers were being sent across to Flanders
  by the thousand, and we had news that the brave Marshal Blucher, the German
  commander, was gathering an army on the Rhine, and that this would join with
  the Duke of Wellington's force, and that both armies would make a march upon
  Paris.</p>

  <p>At last, in the month of May, 1815, our plans were completed; and, after
  writing letters to our fathers, we slipped out of the house, taking just as
  much hand baggage as was necessary, and picked up the Yarmouth coach early
  next morning, having waited on the Norwich road for some hours before it
  appeared. At Yarmouth we had no difficulty in obtaining a passage on a small
  sloop that was carrying, as we discovered, fish for the new army, these being
  dried and packed in bales; and though the smell of them did not comfort us
  when the little sloop began to roll in the heavy seas, yet we maintained our
  dignity till the sloop was brought alongside at Ostend, a small village on
  the coast of Flanders. Happily, the day we arrived, three great ships came
  into the roads, filled with soldiers, and we were not questioned when we went
  ashore, and set out straight away to find means for getting to Brussels.</p>

  <p>We slept that night in Ostend, and the next morning, having hired a
  chaise, we set forth through Bruges and reached Ghent late that night. The
  following morning we were up at daybreak and, hiring relays of horses, came
  into Brussels after all the inns were closed, and had perforce to sleep in a
  stable where we baited our horses. We did, however, succeed in finding rooms
  in an hotel early the next morning, and for this we were grateful, for our
  stock of money was running low, the prices of hotels being extraordinary
  high.</p>

  <p>In Sir Giles Avon, our illustrious kinsman, we found a very dear friend,
  and no sooner were we announced at the Embassy than he had us in to breakfast
  with him.</p>

  <p>"Your fathers will never forgive me," he said, with a chuckle, after Harry
  had told him what we desired. "And as for getting commissions in the King's
  Army, why, that is impossible. But the Duke of Wellington is expected soon,
  and I will make it my business to see what can be done for you."</p>

  <p>He gave us money to comfort ourselves, and after warning us of the dangers
  of a continental city, he sent us back to our hotel rejoicing. For the
  greater part of a month we kicked our heels in Belgium, our anxieties only
  relieved by the letters we received from our fathers, approving our spirit
  but chiding us for our manner of leaving.</p>

  <p>At last the great day came: we were summoned to the Embassy and told we
  had received commissions in the commissariat department; and though this was
  a come-down from what we had expected (I had already decided upon the Guards)
  it gave us the opportunity we desired.</p><img src="1306181h-images/TBA3-image-2.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p class="first">I saw the great Duke in Brussels&mdash;only a fleeting
  glimpse of him, for he was greatly occupied. Napoleon was moving north, and
  on the day that Ney's soldiers tried to force the cross road we held at
  Quatre Bras, Harry and I were attached to a supply column, and were glad to
  forego the invitation we had had to the Duchess of Richmond's ball, this
  great ball being held on the very eve of Waterloo. The Duke attended, as did
  other leading military officers, for they did not wish to alarm the people of
  Brussels by their refusal. But in the dark of the night the Duke slipped
  away, and I saw him on the muddy road leading out to Brussels at six o'clock
  in the morning, a bent man with a great hooked nose and a remorseless eye.
  His spare figure wrapped in a black cloak, he went galloping past me with his
  staff trailing after.</p>

  <p>Already, the night before, Harry and I had heard the low mutter of the
  guns in the distance; and now, on this morning of June 18th, I was to see the
  greatest battle of the century.</p>

  <p>Our supply column was parked to the right of the British line, which
  occupied a ridge across the Brussels road. General Picton was on the left:
  that I well remember, because we could see Picton's soldiers from our
  position, which was half way between the forest of Soignes and the
  battlefield.</p>

  <p>You must remember that our soldiers were only concentrated a day or two
  before the actual battle, and had not Napoleon wasted time after
  out-manoeuvring our army on the morning of the 16th, a different story might
  have been told. As it was, he beat the Prussians to the east of Quatre Bras,
  and they went back to Wavre. But his attempt to crumple up our line at Quatre
  Bras was frustrated. The soldiers say that the Duke of Wellington was
  "everywhere" that day. He was at Quatre Bras, and with the Germans, who had
  taken a very dangerous position, as was proved.</p>

  <p>I have heard from officers that Napoleon expected Blucher would retire
  eastward to Namur, which was his base, and had calculated upon that
  development. But Blucher went north, and Wellington also withdrew his forces
  to the line he occupied on the morning of the 18th.</p>

  <p>I shall not readily forget that morning. Sitting on my horse, Harry by my
  side, I looked across the fields of waving corn, the green of the clover
  harmonizing so perfectly, as nature alone does harmonize, with the ruddy gold
  of the growing crops, and wondered if it was possible that we were on the eve
  of a terrible battle. It had been raining heavily; the ground was wet; great
  pools stood in the road; yet the sodden British soldiers were just as
  cheerful and as happy as though they were at a village feast.</p>

  <p>Our soldiers were placed on the slope of the ridge farthest from the
  enemy, so that they were out of sight of the advancing French. On the right
  front was a farm called Hougoumont, where the Guards were, as I discovered,
  for one of my first duties was to convey supplies to this point.</p>

  <p>Before eleven the first guns thundered the arrival of Napoleon. From where
  I stood I saw the French infantry sweeping across the ground towards
  Hougoumont, and watched, with a curious, detached interest, but with my heart
  in my mouth, men falling here and there, until the line of the attack wavered
  and the force was streaming back to cover. But if I had thought the guns were
  terrible, I did not realize what gunfire meant until the afternoon. Harry and
  I were snatching a hasty lunch when the first roar of cannonade was heard. We
  were eating bread and cheese at the time, and we leapt on to a wall which
  partly sheltered us from observation, and saw the massed French columns
  coming to the attack, and the wonderful spectacle of British cavalry charging
  the retreating enemy.</p><img src="1306181h-images/TBA3-image-3.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>At four o'clock came another attack, to our left, where Picton was, and
  here we saw the British form square and watched the attacking French army
  melt like ice. And then Harry suddenly turned.</p>

  <p>"What is that?" he shouted, and pointed.</p>

  <p>Far away to the left he had seen the flicker of bayonets. It was Blucher's
  German troops coming to reinforce Wellington's line; and they came none too
  soon, for, had Napoleon received the reinforcements he needed, the British
  line must have been pierced.</p>

  <p>At six o'clock that night Harry and I had brought our wagons right up to
  the British line. Bullets were humming and flying in all directions, and the
  sights I saw sickened me of war for all time. The dead and dying lay
  unattended in the mire, and there were sights to be seen that one shudders to
  think about. I arrived at a propitious moment, for hardly had the stores been
  unloaded when I found myself enclosed in a scarlet ring of soldiers. Again
  the British had formed square to meet what Napoleon thought would be the
  irresistible charge of the Old Guard. Alas! many of his bravest warriors, who
  had followed his fortunes from the first day, through Italy to the Peninsula,
  men who had even survived the horrors of that retreat from Moscow, fell that
  day to rise no more. The charge of the Old Guard was scattered under the
  withering volleys which the untrained British infantry poured into them, and
  the day was won.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-2"
     id="ch-2"></a>II. &mdash; DISTRESSFUL ENGLAND.</h2>

  <p class="first">WE have always had in our family at least one Member of
  Parliament. In the days of Charles there were two, as has been reported by my
  ancestor. It was my good fortune that my father, desiring that the tradition
  of the family should be maintained, secured me a seat in Hampshire with very
  little trouble, for he was a rich man, having an important business in India
  (then under the East India Company) which made a very handsome return. In
  those days Members of Parliament were not always freely elected by the
  people, but could buy their seats if they were rich enough or if their
  families' interests were sufficiently strong. In some such cases half a dozen
  seats in the House of Commons belonged to some great lord, who looked upon
  the income he derived from selling these seats as part of his proper
  revenue.</p>

  <p>Mr. Pitt, sensible of this disgraceful condition of affairs, had desired
  to change it, but the monied interests were too strong, and what were called
  the "rotten boroughs" continued to send their members to Parliament. There
  were some constituencies consisting only of two houses that returned a
  member. Yorkshire, with its million of people, had two representatives,
  whilst little Rutland had as many!</p>

  <p>Though I went into Parliament in the Tory interest, my heart was bent upon
  reform. None the less, I was not so enthusiastic as my cousin Harry, who,
  having, after the Battle of Waterloo, obtained a commission in the Army, had
  resigned in disgust when he saw a private soldier receive seven hundred
  lashes for using insulting language to an officer. He was what we came to
  call a Radical, being more Whiggy than a Whig, and in this interest he
  contested two seats, being defeated each time, preferring such a defeat to,
  as he said, the disgrace of buying himself into Parliament.</p>

  <p>But here I anticipate, and passing over much in my own domestic history
  and bridging the gap of years, too lightly perhaps, though it seems that
  hardly had the Battle of Waterloo been fought and Napoleon sent off to St.
  Helena, there to die, than I was a grown man with a family. How that came
  about is too humdrum a matter to weary you with.</p>

  <p>Harry married a lady of Hampshire, after returning from one of his long
  voyages, in which he visited Australia, the great continent which had been
  discovered by Captain Cook, and which was very useful to us (so I thought and
  said) as a place of residence for criminals we never desired to see again.
  Harry grew quite angry at this view, when I gave it.</p>

  <p>"It is a most wonderful country," he said. "I wish that I could take these
  starving people of England and put them there to farm in freedom and
  happiness. To my mind it is a great stain on the Government that they can
  find no other use for this wonderful land than to plant their horrible
  convict settlements upon it."</p>

  <p>There was indeed much distress after the war, for while fighting was in
  progress money was plentiful, the profits of the farmers were high, and the
  people in England had a very comfortable time. But with the war over, our
  markets gone, the restriction of spending, and all that follows a war,
  whether it be successful or unsuccessful, distress was everywhere appalling.
  Farmers were ruined, respectable journeymen found no work for their hands,
  and the nation seemed in a fair way to being reduced to beggary. It is
  strange, reading back over the numerous records of our family, how largely
  the King bulked in all these narratives, yet we scarcely noticed the death of
  mad George III., save to observe that his dissolute son had taken his
  place.</p>

  <p>Kings have been hated and kings have been loved, and there have been kings
  and queens of England who have been ignored. But never, until George IV. came
  to the throne, was there a king who carried so great a weight of contempt as
  he, I went into Parliament in the year 1822, and my cousin might have had as
  safe a seat, as I have said before, but he was so full of indignation at the
  lot of our poor people that he refused to sit for a rotten borough, though,
  on the death of my uncle John, which occurred in 1820, Harry became a very
  rich man. For one thing, he hated Lord Liverpool and his Government, though I
  always found his lordship a very clever and discerning man and most obliging;
  he was undoubtedly narrow-minded, and he and his Cabinet were always smelling
  Robespierres in any demagogue who rose to protest against the conditions of
  the times.</p>

  <p>Remember that the labourers of England were beggars, and that even the
  industrialists in the iron centres were hit; so that it was no wonder that
  there were little riots here and there, which the Government suppressed with
  unnecessary severity; as, for instance, when in August, 1819, they sent
  dragoons to charge an orderly demonstration, six persons being trodden to
  death. To make matters worse, there arose a stupid man called Arthur
  Thistlewood, who, with a small following in London, organized what was called
  the Cato Street Conspiracy, which was to kill Lord Castlereagh and all the
  Ministry. Thistlewood was hanged, as well as a few of his companions, and
  none wished to save him&mdash;for he was a vain fool as well as a villain,
  and such a combination alienates sympathy.</p>

  <p>The only riot I remember witnessing was that which followed the return to
  England of Queen Caroline, the wife of George IV. She was rather silly than
  dissolute, more indiscreet than guilty; but when she announced her intention
  of returning to be crowned Queen alongside of King George, she having been
  separated from him for many years, the King induced Lord Liverpool's
  ministers to bring in a bill of divorce, and this turned the people in favour
  of the stupid Queen. For the life of George himself was so dissolute that it
  ill became him to cast stones at his consort, and there were great factions
  favouring the Queen in consequence. The Whigs took up the Queen's cause, and
  in one riot I saw a few heads cracked, though nothing serious occurred to
  justify the elaborate precautions which the Ministry took.</p><img src=
  "1306181h-images/TBA3-image-5.gif"
        style="float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>Such was the feeling of the mob that the bill of divorce was dropped, but
  the Queen continued to rail against her husband, and railed on until she died
  in the following year. Canning and Sir Robert Peel were in the ministry when
  I was first introduced, Lord Castlereagh, the Foreign Minister, having
  recently committed suicide, Mr. Canning taking his place.</p>

  <p>Soon after I came to Parliament there was much ado about the condition of
  the Greeks, who were under threat of the Turks, and I remember meeting Lord
  Byron at a dinner given by one of the ministers, and learned that this famous
  poet was going to Greece to fight on the side of the people, as indeed he
  did, though whether he fought or not I have no knowledge. At any rate, he
  went out and died there, to the great grief of many who liked his works,
  though for myself I have never been greatly addicted to the study of
  poetry.</p>

  <p>In the shortest time we saw Lord Liverpool stricken down by paralysis, and
  George Canning at the head of affairs, only to die a few months later. And
  then there happened one of the most unfortunate&mdash;indeed, I count it the
  most disastrous&mdash;happenings in modern history. The Tories, who still
  ruled the roast, invited the Duke of Wellington to form a Cabinet. The day
  the great Duke kissed hands on his appointment, I dined with Harry, who had
  come to town. I know not what it is about the Black Avons, but there is
  something impish and sardonic in them, so that they make a jest of the most
  sacred things, though I would not account the Duke such.</p>

  <p>"So your Duke is to be Prime Minister," said Harry Avon, with a grim
  smile. "Sic transit gloria...! So passes the bright shield of a great
  warrior, to be fouled and smirched by base politics!"</p>

  <p>"But he is a great man," I protested.</p>

  <p>"A mighty soldier," said Harry, "and there never was a soldier except
  Bonaparte" (I cannot understand Harry's admiration for the Corsican) "who had
  the brains to govern and the wit to battle. Remember this much, my
  parliamentary friend, that a soldier knows only one kind of strategy, which
  is, first to hoodwink his enemy and then to destroy him. There are no blessed
  compromises in a soldier's equipment, or he is a bad soldier. To the Duke of
  Wellington the House of Commons will be a battleground, wherein he will
  dispose his impregnable defences, not to be scaled by force or betrayed by
  gentle words. Remember also that discipline and its need will play a great
  part in all the decisions he takes."</p>

  <p>I pooh-poohed the idea, believing that the Duke was a much gentler soul
  than he had been described. But Harry's words, how true they were! Wellington
  knew too much of Europe, for one thing. He hated Whigs, whether they were in
  England or France, and began his term of office by violating one of Canning's
  pledges to Greece. And then, not understanding compromise and having it
  forced upon him, he yielded where he should have given a little ground and
  taken a great advantage, and was firm as rock on points where common sense
  would have told the average man he must give way or perish.</p>

  <p>Nor did he merit the entire confidence of his friends, for, having opposed
  that belated measure of justice, the Catholic Emancipation Act, with the
  greatest vigour and to the applause of his friends, he suddenly turned about,
  admitted its desirability, and had the Act passed, thereby forfeiting a large
  measure of confidence which the Tories had in him. But for his wonderful
  reputation as a soldier, his ministry would net have lasted a session; and
  when, on the death of the King, unregretted and unmourned, there followed a
  general election, fifty of the Tory seats were lost, Wellington's ministry
  fell, and there came in the last of the Whigs, Earl Grey.</p>

  <p>Of what he would do, none of us was as sure as my cousin.</p>

  <p>"Here go your rotten boroughs, my friend," he said, rubbing his hands
  gleefully&mdash;we were in his library, for I was spending a short holiday
  with him, with my wife and two young daughters. "There they go into the
  bonfire which has consumed so many foul things."</p>

  <p>"Grey will never dare introduce a Reform Bill&mdash;the Tories are too
  strong in the House of Lords," I said, this being commonly canvassed at
  Westminster. "Besides," I said, "the Whigs have always been talking about
  reforming Parliament. So long as I have been in the House&mdash;so long as we
  have read newspapers, Harry, we have heard of these reforming Whigs!"</p>

  <p>"You'll see it now," said Harry firmly, and then, with a loud laugh, as he
  clapped me on the shoulder: "And I'll be at Westminster, and we'll be sitting
  on opposite sides of the House&mdash;it's a thousand pities you're a Tory,
  William, if indeed you have any convictions at all, which I very much
  doubt!"</p>

  <p>It was very true that Parliament needed reform. As I have said, one of the
  constituencies which returned a member had scarcely half a dozen houses,
  whilst Birmingham and Leeds had no representatives at all. The little town of
  Appleby could send its member to Westminster, but Liverpool could have none.
  It was in '31 that Lord John Russell introduced the bill, but the members
  from the rotten boroughs were too strong and it was defeated by a majority of
  one vote. On this, King William IV., that bluff old sailor and hearty man,
  dissolved Parliament; Grey came back with a majority of 136, one of whom was
  Harry Avon, who got himself elected, as I learned, by bribery of the most
  villainous kind&mdash;but on the right side.</p>

  <p>"It is true I bribed," he said when I dined with him the night the House
  came back&mdash;and a night of great excitement it was, with crowds filling
  the approaches to Parliament. "I have become Jesuitical in my middle age, and
  believe that a man should do evil that good may come. And I am here
  "&mdash;he slapped my knee, and he had the heaviest hand of any man I
  know&mdash;"to make it illegal that any member shall bribe constituents!"</p>

  <p>The great Reform Bill was introduced again and passed&mdash;as far as the
  Lords. They, thinking their very lives as a legislative body depended upon
  their act, threw out the Bill, and the months that followed were full of the
  most furious agitation. There came into power a new party, an extreme wing of
  the Whigs (calling themselves "Radicals"), which had hitherto only appeared
  as isolated individuals but were now a party, vehement in their demand that
  the House of Lords should be abolished, and that all hereditary titles should
  go into the limbo of discredited things.</p>

  <p>The agitation was such that the Lords passed the second reading, then set
  themselves, by altering this clause and that to render the bill valueless;
  whereupon Lord Grey resigned, and the King had to send for the Duke of
  Wellington.</p>

  <p>I think at that crisis the old Duke realized how much more difficult it
  was to win an election and the confidence of Parliament and people, than to
  win a battle. He took some days to think it over, and then declined the
  task&mdash;very wisely, as we all think; leaving Grey to return, which his
  lordship did, on the promise of the King that, if the Lords did not pass the
  bill, he should be allowed to create sufficient peers amongst the Whigs to
  give him a majority in the Upper House. The mere threat of this was
  sufficient; the Reform Bill passed, amidst the jubilations of the people, who
  believed the Millennium had dawned.</p>

  <p>The Bill disenfranchised fifty-six boroughs which had less than two
  thousand inhabitants in each; it gave a hundred and forty-three seats amongst
  huge centres of population, including Marylebone, Greenwich, Lambeth,
  Finsbury, and Tower Hamlets. It took away one member from thirty towns which
  before had two; whilst it gave two members to Manchester, Liverpool,
  Birmingham and Newcastle. There were some agitators who thought that the Bill
  was not liberal enough, and would have had a universal suffrage; whilst more
  moderate men thought that the artisans and the agricultural labourers should
  have a vote, which of course they did not have.</p>

  <p>Amongst my friends in the House of Commons was Sir Francis Burnett, who
  was greater still a friend of Harry's. We looked upon Sir Francis in those
  days as a dangerous agitator, and indeed some of his demands were
  fantastical, though Harry saw nothing remarkable about them except their
  honesty and their justice! So dangerous a man was Sir Francis regarded, that
  six Acts were passed against brawling and industrial riots, also against the
  Chartist movement (as we afterwards called it) for which he was responsible,
  and for which Harry himself used to speak with much vigour and eloquence.</p>

  <p>"What do we ask?" said Harry. "Nothing but the rights of man&mdash;and
  don't turn up your silly old eyes at that, or tell me that I am mouthing the
  platitudes of the French Revolution. We ask for an annual Parliament, for
  voting by ballot, for manhood suffrage, and the abolition of the property
  qualification for Members of Parliament, and we ask too that Members shall be
  paid, so that the poorest will be able to afford to sit in the House of
  Parliament."*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[*Every one of these reforms have since been granted.
  &mdash;E.W.]</p>

  <p>"But what you ask is madness," said I indignantly. "Manhood
  suffrage&mdash;you will ask for womanhood suffrage next!"</p>

  <p>"That will come," said Harry, and I could only stare at him, believing
  that he had taken leave of his senses.</p>

  <p>It was not till six years later that this extraordinary idea took more
  definite shape, when there was prepared what was called a People's Charter,
  demanding these reforms which I have already enumerated. All over the country
  there were huge meetings, attended and approved by thousands who had been
  disappointed by the operation of the Reform Bill; and so great was the fear
  of the people that a new French Revolution was coming, that special
  constables to the number of one hundred and thirty thousand were sworn in all
  over the country, and the troops were called out under the Duke of Wellington
  to prevent the Chartists from approaching the House of Commons with their
  petition.</p>

  <p>In these days I greatly feared for Harry, who had flung himself into this
  mad fight with all the enthusiasm of his kind, who addressed meetings and
  wrote articles in the "Northern Star," and even went down into Newport and
  took part in a rising, though I believe he tried to pacify the rioters, one
  of whom, John Frost, being subsequently found guilty of high treason and
  condemned to death.</p>

  <p>I must say that the years have somewhat softened my views about the
  justice of this demand, but certainly it was put in the most unseemly
  fashion, and I severely reproached my cousin to his face that he had lent his
  indubitable talents to misleading these ignorant people. He laughed.</p>

  <p>But before the Chartist Riots, whilst, so to speak, they were but
  simmering, there occurred an event which must be a landmark in our history:
  William IV. died, and there succeeded him the young daughter of the Duke of
  Kent, William's niece and the grandchild of George III., Queen Victoria, that
  most gracious lady.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-3"
     id="ch-3"></a>III. &mdash; THE POOR LAWS.</h2>

  <p class="first">I WILL say this of Harry Avon, that for all his thirty-nine
  years, he had the spirit and heart of a boy, though his own son was fast
  approaching the age at which his father and I saw the shambles of Waterloo.
  Little angered him, except perhaps if anyone cast doubt upon his having been
  present on that historic field. Then indeed he grew red and wrathful.</p>

  <p>I had not seen much of him for the greater part of three years, when I had
  a letter from him by the post, which made me think at first that he had gone
  mad.</p>

  <p class="letter">"This is a great country, O august Member of
  Parliament&mdash;how great you do not guess! Come down to my house here and
  see how a beneficent state leads children upward by the hands, so that there
  is no need to work and every labourer's cottage is like unto an Arcadia!"</p>

  <p>What the mad fellow meant I could not guess, but I had a holiday on my
  hands and I went down into Hampshire, going part of the journey by the new
  steam railroad which was just then beginning to appear on every countryside.
  As usual, I was hospitably entertained. When I made a reference to his letter
  he put a finger to his lips.</p><img src="1306181h-images/TBA3-image-7.gif"
        style="float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>"Wait, and you shall see," he said, mysteriously, and the next morning the
  mystery was explained, for we went down into the village and stopped at a
  labourer's cottage, where a man stood idling at the gate. He looked well-fed
  and prosperous, as did his wife.</p>

  <p>"Well, John, have you done any work this week?"</p>

  <p>The man knuckled his forehead.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Sir Harry," he said, "I've done two days' work for Farmer Wilkins."
  Then he turned aside, as though he knew what my relative was aiming at, and
  regretted it.</p>

  <p>"That is the Poor Law in operation," said Harry wrathfully. "Do you
  realize what you are doing with your cursed doles to the poor?"</p>

  <p>I had not studied the Poor Law, but I knew that, by the Gilbert Act, any
  person out of employment was allowed to take from the parish funds as much
  money as would be necessary to maintain him. It seems that a scale had been
  fixed, so that when the price of bread rose, the allowance rose, and for
  every member of a family an additional dole was given.</p>

  <p>"The main result is," said Harry, "that the farmers hereabouts, employers
  in towns too, have cut down their wages to these men, knowing that they are
  receiving sufficient poor law allowance to enable them to work for a little
  less than they would otherwise receive. The more children they have, the more
  money they get&mdash;poor rates are seven millions a year, my good
  friend!"</p>

  <p>I confess this was a shock to me. And when, later, Lord Grey introduced a
  Bill to give only the destitute and the old parish relief, and to force the
  able-bodied to go into a workhouse, I gave him my support. It was in this
  year that slavery in our colonies was abolished, the planters being
  compensated with a sum of over £20 for each man and woman freed.</p>

  <p>I have spoken of the steam railway&mdash;a great novelty in these days. An
  engineer, Stephenson, was the inventor, but there was great difficulty in
  getting the necessary Bills through Parliament to make what was called "a
  railway system" possible. The first railway bill was thrown out of Parliament
  because the projected line threatened to pass too near to the coverts of a
  duke!</p>

  <p>A man with whom we came into contact during the early period of our
  Parliamentary comradeship remains with me (and Harry confessed the same) as a
  most important memory. We had become acquainted in one of those literary
  salons which held sway at the time, with a young author whose name was on
  every lip, and whose eccentricity of attire excited the risibility of the
  curious.</p>

  <p>How strangely wrong can be one's first impressions! An even more erratic
  genius, Mr. Theodore Hook, introduced him to us with these words: "You will
  hate this young man because you do not know him. If you know him you cannot
  hate him."</p>

  <p>The person to whom he brought us an acquaintance was a very overdressed
  young man, obviously of the Jewish persuasion, Benjamin D'Israeli, who had
  written a book called "Vivian Grey." I shall never forget my first impression
  of that extravagant dandy. He wore green velvet trousers, a canary coloured
  waistcoat, low shoes with silver buckles, and had lace at his wrists. He was
  in the habit of wearing his rings over his gloves, and a more unpromising
  individual I have never met. He was a brilliant talker, and I believe it was
  then his intention to stand for Parliament.</p>

  <p>His views were unusual, and I quite expected, when the party was over, to
  hear Harry break into a tirade against this dandified young man. But, to my
  surprise, whilst he was amused at the extravagance of D'Israeli's dress, he
  was deeply impressed by the young man's genius.</p>

  <p>"I think he will go far," said Harry. "He has courage and a very wide
  knowledge of humanity."</p>

  <p>"He is a hopeless fop," said I, nettled.</p>

  <p>"I doubt whether his appearance makes very much difference," said Harry
  drily. "He certainly does affect odd clothing, but the man is a genius and I
  shall look forward to his appearance in Parliament."</p>

  <p>We met D'Israeli after he had failed to carry a seat at Taunton, and we
  were both present in the Marylebone Police Court when D'Israeli appeared
  there on a charge of contemplating a breach of the peace. He had, it seemed,
  challenged O'Connell to a duel and had been arrested in his bed by police
  officers in consequence.</p>

  <p>It was in 1837 that D'Israeli appeared in Parliament, and made a speech so
  full of wild and flurried phrases that the House laughed him down. D'Israeli
  was white with anger, and, shaking his fist at the House said:</p>

  <p>"There will be a time when you will hear me!"</p>

  <p>For a while his vehemence was directed towards a clever young Oxford man,
  William Ewart Gladstone, who had already been marked out for an important
  position in the Government.</p>

  <p>"Gladstone." he said one day, when he was walking with me in the lobby of
  the House. "He is brilliant, I agree, but a sophist of the worst kind! Mark
  how in his maiden speech he rose and, with a gesture, took up the challenge
  which had been flung down by Lord Howitt!"</p>

  <p>D'Israeli was not in the House at this time, but I remember the
  circumstances well. Howitt, who was afterwards Lord Grey, had opposed a
  resolution making for the abolition of slavery, on the grounds that it went
  too slowly towards its object, and he had instanced certain happenings on the
  plantation of Sir John Gladstone in Demerara. Gladstone's father was a
  slave-owner on a large scale, and William had felt it necessary to defend his
  father, and whilst he professed his belief that slavery should be abolished,
  he desired that the slave-owners should be properly and amply
  compensated.</p>

  <p>"Property," he said, "is an abstract thing; it is the creature of society.
  By the legislature it is granted, and by the legislature it is
  destroyed."</p>

  <p>Whether D'Israeli had any very strong views on the subject&mdash;or would
  I not better say 'very sincere views'?&mdash;it is difficult, indeed
  impossible, for me to state with any certainty; but I think he was sincere
  enough in his suspicion of Gladstone, whose maiden speech was undoubtedly
  designed to protect his family's interests and to afford an apologia for the
  practice of slavery.</p>

  <p>We watched with interest the progress of these two men, consciously or
  unconsciously rivals for the highest position in the land, both destined to
  occupy the most important offices of state. Of the two, it seemed that
  William Gladstone was the more likely to succeed, for he was a member of an
  old English family and was closely associated by tastes and instinct with the
  class which has governed England for centuries. D'Israeli was not only
  suspected by those unthinking people who look with suspicion on a Jew, but
  also by politicians who mistrusted so volatile a genius. He was known to be
  in desperate financial straits, was in the hands of the moneylenders, and his
  extravagance, at one period of his career, brought him to the verge of
  ruin.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you this about D'Israeli," said Harry when I spoke to him of
  the rumours I had heard. "He may be in the hands of moneylenders, but he has
  never borrowed from a friend, nor has he involved his friends in any of his
  financial transactions. Half his trouble comes from his good nature and
  generosity&mdash;D'Israeli has probably backed more bills than any other
  member of the House of Commons!"</p>

  <p>Harry and I sat through many parliaments, happily on the same side of the
  house. We saw Peel succeed Melbourne, and Melbourne succeed Peel, who came
  back again to pass the Repeal of the Corn Laws. Under Lord Derby, Harry might
  have had a post, but his erratic political views made this impossible.</p>

  <p>In this year his wife and his only son died of malignant fever, and with a
  courage which was worthy of his greatest ancestor, he met the crushing blow
  without faltering. Resigning his seat in Parliament, he went abroad, and the
  first I knew of his plans was when I had a letter telling me that at the age
  of fifty-one he had accepted a position on the staff of the Indian Army, and
  that he hoped that "you will one day visit the country from which you draw so
  many profits "&mdash;a sly reference to the source of my income, which was
  the Indian business founded by my father, and which had lately increased to
  such an extent that I had already considered the possibility of a visit.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-4"
     id="ch-4"></a>IV. &mdash; STORM CLOUDS IN INDIA.</h2>

  <p class="first">IN the year 1853 the demands of my Indian business became so
  pressing that it was necessary that I should journey to this wondrous land,
  with the object of appointing new representatives and of opening new
  factories at Meerut and Delhi, both of which were prosperous centres of trade
  and had the advantage, from my point of view, of being garrison towns where I
  should meet men of my own nationality. Moreover (and I am sure that this was
  the greater inducement), there would be a chance of seeing
  Harry.</p><img src="1306181h-images/TBA3-image-8.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>I confess that I was very concerned a few mornings before my departure,
  when my dear wife passed me a copy of "The Times" across the breakfast table
  and showed me a letter which was printed there. It was from General Jacob, a
  well-known and highly respected officer, and stated that the Bengal Army was
  practically in a state of mutiny.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"There is more danger to our Indian Empire in this
  condition of the Bengal Army and the feeling which there exists between the
  natives and the Europeans, and thence spread throughout the length and
  breadth of the land, than in all other causes combined. Let Government look
  to this; it is a serious and most important truth."</p>

  <p>At this my wife was greatly perturbed.</p>

  <p>"I can't allow you to go to India with the country in that state," she
  said, but I laughed at her fears, though I was by no means happy in my
  mind.</p>

  <p>To make the story of a long voyage short, after many weeks of travel,
  during which we suffered storms about the Cape of Good Hope, we arrived at
  last in the wonderland of India. How can I describe my confused impressions
  of that strange, beautiful, and yet to me&mdash;oppressed by a sense of the
  power which lay behind the teeming millions of natives&mdash;terrible
  country? Even though it is a recent experience, my first impression of India
  is one of vivid confusion, if those terms, which at first seem contradictory,
  may be employed. The white buildings, the blue, cloudless sky, the long,
  straight roads that led through jungle and across the face of the cultivated
  land, the spicy scents of the Orient, the strange people of all castes and
  races...it is difficult for me to convey even a modicum of my amazement and
  delight.</p>

  <p>I reached Meerut on a blazing hot day, and set out in search of Harry,
  whose headquarters this was, but who, I learned, had been away on a shooting
  trip and was not expected back for three or four days. I was made comfortable
  by the manager of my factory, and had quite enough to engage myself during
  the period of waiting. And then one morning a sturdy form came striding
  across the floor of my office, a white kepi on his head, with along cloth at
  the back to protect his neck from the rays of the sun, and in a second I was
  shaking hands with Harry, brown and thin of face, whiter of hair, but as
  cheerful as ever.</p>

  <p>We had tiffin (as they call luncheon) together, and then it was that I
  discovered that, despite his boisterous good humour, he took a grave view of
  the situation. I did not learn this till I mentioned Colonel Jacob's letter,
  and then his face instantly grew serious.</p>

  <p>"It is perfectly true," he said quietly. "I have been talking to some of
  the British officers commanding the native regiments here, and there isn't
  one of them who believes that his men are trustworthy. I have written in the
  same strain to old friends of mine in Parliament, but they laugh at what they
  call my fears!"</p>

  <p>"But this is astounding, Harry," I said, in dismay. "What is the cause of
  the unrest?"</p>

  <p>Harry shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"There are a dozen causes," he said, "and at present, thank heaven! there
  is no one cause which affects them all. The Sowars" (he explained that a
  Sowar was a native cavalryman) "are ripe for anything because they are in
  debt."</p>

  <p>I was mystified at the idea of a private soldier being in debt, and that
  that fact menaced the security of the East India Company. But then he told me
  that the soldiers were recruited on what they call the "Sillidar" system, by
  which they had to provide their own horses and provisions. In return they
  received a monthly wage, which very often was not enough to pay their debts.
  I then began, dimly, to understand.</p>

  <p>"Yes, they're all in debt," said Harry, very calmly. "They have to go to
  the moneylender to get the wherewithal to buy their horses in the first
  place&mdash;there isn't a Sowar, whatever his feelings may be against the
  British, who would not howl with delight at the prospect of a revolution
  which would enable him to cut the throat of the moneylender and wipe out his
  obligation!"</p>

  <p>I thought at first he was jesting, but I learned later that this was no
  more than true. Harry went on:</p>

  <p>"The Hindus are disaffected because of the Persian War, for fear that they
  will have to cross the water and lose caste. And the Indian princes are
  sulky, because of Lord Dalhousie's scheme of annexation."</p>

  <p>I had heard something of this before I had left England. Lord Dalhousie,
  the great Governor-General, had enacted a law by which, if a native prince
  had no direct heir his estate went to the Company. As it had been the
  practice from immemorial time for natives to adopt children and leave their
  property to their adopted sons, the new regime was regarded as an imposition,
  especially by those young "princes" who had been adopted into rajahs'
  families for the very purpose of possession.</p>

  <p>"And now," said my cousin, in despair, "Dalhousie's scheme has annexed
  Oudh; and as most of the infantry in Bengal come from that State, you can
  imagine what they are feeling."</p>

  <p>"But surely there are some loyal natives?" I asked.</p>

  <p>Harry shook his head.</p>

  <p>"There are&mdash;a few," he said significantly. "But we, in our curious
  British way, have managed to antagonize not only the Hindus but the
  Mohammedans. The Brahmans are up in arms over the prohibition of
  suttee&mdash;they like to feel that when they die their widows will burn
  themselves to death&mdash;oh, they've all got their pet grievances. I'll tell
  you this, cousin," he said soberly: "if Britain was in a European war just
  now, and she got badly worsted, or didn't succeed as well as she might, I
  think the loss of prestige would precipitate a general uprising."</p>

  <p>I must say that Harry's views were not those held by other officers I met
  in the course of my stay both in Meerut and in Delhi. One or two old
  officers, men who had been colonels for years and were holding lucrative
  positions, pooh-poohed the idea. When I told Harry, he laughed
  sarcastically.</p>

  <p>"Those old fossils simply dare not believe there is likely to be a rising.
  I assure you that there are more incompetent senior officers in India than
  there are in any other part of the world."</p>

  <p>It was, I thought, one of Harry's typical and hasty generalizations, but
  alas! history was to prove that he was not far wrong.</p>

  <p>I returned to England six months later, with a very uneasy feeling and a
  fervent hope that the trouble, if it was to come, would develop before I was
  due to return. From now on it was obvious that my presence in India was
  imperative at least every other year.</p>

  <p>By the time I had reached England, however, there were other matters to
  occupy my attention. The mutterings of the war guns had been heard in the
  Near East; Russia and Turkey were already fighting; Great Britain and France
  had made the Turks' quarrel their own. The year I returned, Britain and
  France declared war on the Czar, and we might have had a first-class conflict
  in the Balkan Peninsula if Austria had not gathered a strong army and,
  without declaring itself hostile to the Czar, placed that army in
  Transylvania, right across the Russian line of communication. This ended the
  war, such as it was; and now Europe was scared of what was called the Russian
  menace. For the Czar had destroyed the Turkish fleet, and was fortifying the
  Crimean coast, with the object, as it was believed, and, indeed, openly
  stated, of seizing Constantinople and securing for himself an ice-free exit
  to the high seas. This had been Russia's ambition since the days of Peter the
  Great&mdash;a port that was free of ice all the year round. For this Peter
  and his successors had made war, but as the fear of Russia in the
  Mediterranean had invariably drawn the other European powers together, the
  plan was invariably defeated.</p>

  <p>In point of fact I knew just what turn events were taking, for I had the
  satisfaction of meeting Lord Palmerston one evening at a dinner given in
  honour of the young Prince of Wales, Albert Edward. His lordship told me then
  with the greatest frankness, that Britain and France could not tolerate the
  creation of great forts on the Black Sea.</p>

  <p>"The Russians have retired to their own country," he said, "but it is only
  to gather strength to launch themselves again at Turkey. We must close that
  fort at Sebastopol and the Russian Navy must be destroyed, or we shall have
  war in Europe continuously for the next twenty years."</p>

  <p>At this time the third Napoleon was on the throne of France, having
  secured himself that position by very much the same method as his illustrious
  ancestor, Napoleon Bonaparte, had followed&mdash;namely, by a <i>coup
  d'état</i>. Napoleon was one with the Queen's Government, and he sent an
  important army to assist the Turks and the British, and before we realized
  what was happening, the troops were marching through England on their way to
  the ports and the ships that would carry them to the cruel, bleak desert of
  the Crimea.</p>

  <p>News came by the electric telegraph of early successes, and we learned how
  the British had landed at Old Fort and had forced the River Alma, and of how,
  having outflanked the Russian field defences, they had reached the south of
  Sebastopol and were firmly established, covering the harbour of Balaclava.
  The British and French guns were thundering against the great fortress of the
  Malakoff, battering that defence to pieces by day, only to discover, with the
  coming of morning, that the Russians had repaired the breaches, making it as
  strong as ever.</p>

  <p>Throughout these operations I was thanking heaven that Harry was safe in
  India, and you may imagine my surprise and fear when one morning the postman
  placed in my hand a stained letter bearing a field postmark which told me
  that it had come from the Crimea, and I recognized Harry's handwriting. As it
  happened, it was an historical document...</p>

        style="float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p class="letter">"Protecting our siege batteries which are hammering away at
  the Malakoff, we have a long line of defence&mdash;too long for
  safety&mdash;which is called the Vorontsov Bridge. Three days ago Liprandis
  carried our centre, but happily our heavy cavalry were on the site and
  charged, sending the Russians flying. About this time a very strong force of
  Russian cavalry rode down on the 93rd, expecting to annihilate them. But
  these gallant Highlanders stood in a single line, and by the steadiness of
  their fire brought the Russians into confusion. Here we call the 93rd the
  'thin red line.' Thin indeed it was, but it was like a granite wall which
  could not be overcome...The day, however, was marred by one great tragedy.
  The Light Brigade, as we call the lighter regiments of cavalry grouped under
  Lord Lucan, were being held ready to be thrown in, as some say, though others
  who knew Lord Raglan's intention, deny this. At any rate, an aide-de-camp
  took a message to Lord Lucan with orders that he was to prevent the
  withdrawal of guns which the Russians had captured in their assault on the
  ridge. Without hesitation the Light Brigade went straight for the Russian
  guns over a mile and a half of shell-swept ground, and though they were cut
  down by hundreds, reached and spiked the guns, some of them going beyond into
  the enemy's cavalry&mdash;an amazing achievement, though, alas! fraught with
  the gravest loss to our forces, for only a third of their number came
  back..."</p>

  <p>Though he did not tell me, I learned afterwards that Harry took a
  wonderful part in the battle of Inkerman which followed, on November 5th,
  eleven days after that disastrous charge of the Light Brigade. The battle of
  Inkerman was initiated by the Russians, who had been very heavily reinforced,
  and they now struck at the junction between the British and the French
  divisions. It was a melee pure and simple, every man fighting his own battle
  without orders, whole regiments and divisions inextricably mixed up, so that
  Highlanders were fighting side by side with dismounted cavalrymen, and
  generals, sword in hand, fought shoulder to shoulder with privates.</p>

  <p>Throughout the terrible winter that followed, when the British soldiers
  were starving as the result of their supply ships being wrecked in a storm,
  when they went almost barefooted through the snow to their post, and endured
  the most terrible hardships that the mind of man can conceive, I heard
  nothing from Harry, and my anxiety increased, until one morning it was
  relieved by a letter written from Portsmouth, where he had arrived.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"...I cannot tell you the horror of that siege: the mud,
  the snow, the abject misery of our poor British soldiers, who, despite all
  their sufferings, stood up cheerfully to their duty. Cholera has decimated
  the French Army, and our own poor fellows are suffering terribly from
  sickness. Happily there arrived at Scutari a brave English lady named Miss
  Florence Nightingale, who has brought nurses with her and is doing wonderful
  work to succour the sick and wounded."</p><br>

  <p>I journeyed down to Portsmouth to see Harry, and found him the wreck of
  the man I had known. But such was the buoyancy of his breed and the amazing
  recuperative power of his years, that within four months he was not only well
  but anxious to go back to that dreadful shambles, in which the British alone
  lost forty-five thousand men, and the Russians two hundred and fifty-six
  thousand. Happily, the fall of Malakoff and the signing of an armistice
  prevented any further anxiety on my part. Harry came up to London to dine
  with me and my wife, and he told us he was leaving by the next available ship
  to take over his old post at Meerut.</p>

  <p>"You remember what I told you about; how in the event of a serious setback
  to British arms, there would be a danger of rising in India?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"But surely, Harry," I said in surprise, "you do not call our glorious
  victory in the Crimea a setback?"</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I suppose it is a victory, but we have been too long getting it, and we
  have had the assistance of the French. A man I met who has just come back
  from India told me that the news of our many failures and the state of our
  army is common talk in the bazaars."</p>

  <p>"Does bazaar-talk matter?" I smiled.</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," he hesitated, "only&mdash;I'm glad I'm not serving with a
  native regiment."</p>

  <p>I cavilled at this.</p>

  <p>"You're trying to scare me from coming to India," said I.</p>

  <p>"Indeed I'm not," he replied earnestly. "Though I'd be mighty glad if you
  came out soon&mdash;and went away sooner! And if you will follow my advice,
  you will make no heavy commitments in regard to your factories, and you will
  postpone the buildings you contemplate until&mdash;well, until things settle
  down."</p>

  <p>This was not a very cheerful point of view, and I would have gladly gone
  to India right away, only I saw the cowardice of such a step and realized
  that, even if I went immediately, I must make another trip two years after,
  for I was by no means sure of my manager, an Eurasian.</p>

  <p>"I understand the natives," said Harry. And then, with a laugh: "Perhaps
  it is because I myself am a Black Avon! I know what they will do on certain
  occasions and I pretty well guess how they feel in normal times. Once you
  meet the native in his abnormal mood, however, it is beyond the mind of man
  to appreciate either his thoughts or his intentions."</p>

  <p>He gave me a curious illustration.</p>

  <p>"Have you ever seen a charpati?" he asked, and, when I said no, he told me
  it was an unleavened cake, which was never eaten but passed from hand to
  hand. "That charpati is a message. What the message is, no native can reduce
  to words. But we know from sad experience that the arrival of a charpati in a
  village means trouble. At the sight of that unleavened cake, whole
  communities grow agitated and dangerous, but knowing this, we know no more,
  and it remains to this day as mysterious a message as it was in the days of
  Clive."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-5"
     id="ch-5"></a>V. &mdash; THE OUTBREAK.</h2>

  <p class="first">HARRY went back to India a few days after this little talk,
  the purport of which I concealed very carefully from my wife.</p>

  <p>It was not until the winter of the following year that I set sail on my
  second visit to the East. My health was none of the best, and I was glad to
  escape the rigour of an English winter, as also was my wife, who accompanied
  me as far as Cape Town, in the Cape of Good Hope, a British settlement that
  had once been Dutch, and was a port of call for travellers to the East. At
  this period a M. de Lesseps was soliciting subscriptions to a scheme for
  cutting what was called the Suez Canal between the Mediterranean and the Red
  Sea, to shorten the journey to India&mdash;a project which, Lord Palmerston
  told me, was a physical impossibility.</p>

  <p>The ship stayed long enough at the Cape for me to see my dear wife settled
  in a delightful part of the Cape Peninsula called Wynberg. At the last minute
  she begged me to take her on to India, but I thanked heaven with all fervency
  that I did not accede to her request.</p>

  <p>It was on a very pleasant January morning in the year 1857, with a blue
  sky overhead and a gentle breeze tempering the warmth of the day, that I
  arrived in Meerut. Glad I was, after my long and tiring journey, to get to
  the cool, big room that had been put aside for me in my manager's house. The
  green sunblinds were drawn; the <i>punkah</i> overhead moved rhythmically,
  controlled by an old man who squatted outside the door and pulled ceaselessly
  at a string which communicated with this great fan. Here I was, stretched in
  a deep chair, a cool drink on a table at my side when the same old Harry that
  I had known, looking none the worse for his terrible experience in the
  Crimea, came in to greet me, having missed me on my arrival.</p>

  <p>"Well," I said, after the first greetings were over, "have you had your
  great mutiny?"</p>

  <p>"N&mdash;no," he said slowly, "and I hope we shan't, till we get back some
  of the troops we sent to the Crimea."</p>

  <p>I had not realized that India had been largely depleted of its soldiery to
  reinforce the shattered British battalions in the Crimea.</p>

  <p>"We've less than forty thousand white soldiers, and there are a little
  more than a quarter of a million Indian soldiers," said Harry tersely, and,
  clapping his hands to summon my bearer, as we called the Indian personal
  servant who attended to me, he ordered a long, cool drink.</p>

  <p>"What do you do with mutinous troops?" I asked curiously.</p><img src=
  "1306181h-images/TBA3-image-10.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>"We haven't had a mutiny since '42, which was long before my time," he
  said. "But if you have sufficient white troops, it is possible to put the
  rebellion down without much difficulty. Look at this," he said.</p>

  <p>He put his hand in his pocket, took out an object as long as a man's
  finger, which was wrapped in tissue paper. This he carefully unfolded,
  revealing a cartridge.</p>

  <p>"What is that?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"That's a very ordinary cartridge such as the Sepoys use. Put your finger
  on it."</p>

  <p>I did so and found it smooth and greasy.</p>

  <p>"Cow's fat or pig's fat," said Harry laconically. "The incredible folly of
  it! Do you understand that the soldier has to put that in his mouth to bite
  off the end?"</p>

  <p>"But are you sure it's cow fat?" I asked, instantly alive to the awful
  folly of the authorities.</p>

  <p>"Whether it is or isn't, doesn't matter," said Harry, replacing the
  cartridge in his pocket. "The doctor of the regiment stationed here says
  there is no doubt that both pig's fat and cow's fat are used to grease these
  cartridges. Of course it is necessary that they should be greased, to fit
  into the new Minie rifles. The cow, as you know, my dear fellow, is the
  sacred animal of the Hindu; the pig is abhorrent to every Mahommedan; so the
  brainless gentlemen in charge of our ordnance department have succeeded in
  mortally offending both Mohammedans and Hindus and bringing them for once
  into line."</p>

  <p>"But surely it can't be fat from&mdash;" I began.</p>

  <p>"It is," said Harry emphatically. "We have unmistakable proof that the
  tallow used to grease the particular cartridges I have shown you is made from
  the pig! The cow is probably a figment of the Hindu's imagination, but we can
  swear to the porker. And, what is more, the Mahommedans know it."</p>

  <p>He told me there had been a little rising at Barrackpur, near Calcutta,
  the year before, and that the regiment involved had been publicly
  disbanded.</p>

  <p>"And punished?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"No," said Harry thoughtfully. "Lord Canning, the present
  Governor-General, is a great man, but he doesn't believe in punishment. And
  in many ways he's right, for undoubtedly the trouble in Barrackpur arose over
  these cartridges. And there will be trouble here."</p>

  <p>He spoke so emphatically that I felt a little chill run down my spine.</p>

  <p>"But you've troops here?" I said.</p>

  <p>"We've a lot of native troops," said Harry, "but our great weakness is our
  dear old General, who has as much initiative as a cabbage."</p>

  <p>He told me that there were two regiments of native infantry, one of
  cavalry, and a strong mixed force of British.</p>

  <p>I had plenty of opportunity of meeting his brother officers, and indeed I
  dined at every mess in Meerut. Curiously enough, I found all the officers of
  native regiments confident of the loyalty of their men. General Hewitt, who
  commanded, was one of those who scoffed at the danger, though he had warning
  enough; for, a month or two after I had arrived, and when I had booked my
  passage back to England, and was looking forward to rejoining my wife at
  Wynberg, there occurred an incident which must have been the very writing on
  the wall to any man of common sense.</p>

  <p>One morning I learned that a large number of the native cavalry regiment
  had refused to accept their cartridges, and in the following week, after the
  court-martial&mdash;whereat they were sentenced to ten years' penal
  servitude&mdash;I saw them stripped of their uniform on the public square and
  marched off to gaol. This was on a Saturday, and I had arranged with Harry to
  join him at church on the Sunday evening and to mess with him after the
  service.</p>

  <p>The troops were drawn up on parade without arms, when suddenly, from the
  native lines, came the rapid sound of rifle fire. It grew to a perfect
  torrent of shooting. Presently I saw a figure staggering across the square,
  blood streaming down his face, waving his hands and signalling wildly. By the
  time we reached him he was in a swoon, but we recognized at once that he was
  an officer of one of the native infantry regiments; and when, later, he
  recovered, he told his story.</p>

  <p>The native regiments had shot down their officers to a man, and even now
  were plundering the European dwellings. Fugitives began flocking in to the
  lines; and in this crisis, when a man of resolution and courage might have
  stamped out for ever the great mutiny which was later to paralyse India, we
  found the General commanding paralysed with astonishment, incapable of doing
  anything except waiting for something to happen. The troops were soon armed
  and on the alert, but no effort was made to quell the mutiny, and the
  mutineers streamed, a disordered crowd, towards Delhi, where they were joined
  by the King of Delhi's own soldiers.</p><img src="1306181h-images/TBA3-image-11.gif"

  <p>The little garrison at Delhi made an effort to defend itself, and the
  great magazine was blown up by Lieutenant Willoughby, with himself, and the
  ten soldiers who defended their post to the last.</p>

  <p>In the meantime the electric telegraph enabled us to warn other posts,
  though this communication was soon interrupted; for the whole province was
  now in revolt.</p>

  <p>I had already taken up my residence within the lines. There we were safe,
  for the mutineers had practically abandoned Meerut. Harry came to me on the
  second night of the tragedy, almost weeping in his helpless rage and
  grief.</p>

  <p>"We are sitting here doing nothing," he stormed. "Hewitt will not
  move&mdash;the man is helpless and hopeless! If he were a coward we could
  shoot him, but he's not! He is just stupid, and there is no death penalty for
  stupidity!"</p>

  <p>And indeed this was no more than the fact, for not until a month later did
  the Meerut troops march out to join Bernard, and then we learned for the
  first time the extent of the mutiny. Delhi was in the enemy's hands, and was
  besieged by a small British force, though it is truer to say that it was the
  British who were besieged and not Delhi; until first the Meerut troops, and
  then John Nicholson's forces, joined us&mdash;and the gallant little party
  which occupied the ridge before Delhi.</p>

  <p>It was on September 14th that we made our attack, and strange indeed it
  was to me, a peaceful merchant, to find myself black of face and grimy of
  body, unshaved for a week, rushing forward, rifle in hand, to scramble
  through the Kashmir gate, which two brave engineers had blown up. But there
  were older volunteers than I, for I was fifty-eight at the time, and I
  remember seeing an aged Indian merchant, his long white beard floating to his
  waist, shoot down two of the King of Delhi's soldiers who had killed one of
  our officers. It was after six days' fighting that the town was taken, and
  the King of Delhi was made prisoner, his sons being shot by Hodson, of
  Hodson's Force, without trial, as I understand, though I only know the
  rumours that floated about.</p>

  <p>We had hardly occupied Delhi (where we lost John Nicholson) when the
  terrible story of Cawnpore came to us. Here the garrison had been butchered,
  after being promised safe conduct by Nana Sahib, one of those adopted sons
  whose future had been jeopardized by Lord Dalhousie's scheme. More horrible
  still, the women and children had been murdered and thrown into a well. The
  news roused the soldiers to frenzy, and, but for the magnificent discipline
  which was maintained, we should have marched out to destruction, for although
  we had succeeded in taking the city, we were in a parlous position. Our men
  were calmed when they learned that Sir Henry Havelock was marching to
  Cawnpore to avenge our murdered countrywomen.</p>

  <p>Not till later did we know that Havelock marched two hundred and
  twenty-six miles in nine days, and fought three great actions in the hottest
  season of the year; and if he did not save, at least he avenged the pitiable
  dead.</p>

  <p>Our position in Delhi, though we had gained that city against an
  overwhelming mass of enemies, was by no means a happy one. Indeed, one of our
  commanders advised a retreat, of which our sterner leaders would not
  hear.</p>

  <p>Harry and I occupied a magnificent room in a king's palace, which was
  luxury untold after the hard campaigning we had had before the fall of the
  city. In spite of my age, I think I never felt fitter in my life, and, by the
  mercy of Providence, both Harry and I had come through the thirty actions
  which we had fought before the fall of Delhi without a scratch.</p>

  <p>He was now holding the post of Colonel attached to Neville Chamberlain's
  staff, and through him I learned something of the extent of the mutiny. The
  troops of Allahabad had mutinied and had shot down their officers, whilst the
  native soldiers of Benares had followed suit; though in this case they were
  disarmed before they could do much mischief.</p>

  <p>But in those days our attention and minds were fixed upon Lucknow, the
  capital of Oudh. There had been trouble at Lucknow before the outbreak at
  Meerut; for the Oudh infantry had refused to bite their cartridges and were
  disarmed. Sir Henry Lawrence, that great man, was in command of the post, and
  he recognized from the first that the mutiny was inevitable; and when the
  news came through of our alarming experience, he gathered as many men as he
  could, fortified his residency, so that, when the outbreak came, on May 30th,
  he was in a good position of defence. He had less than a thousand British
  officers and men, and was dependent for his safety upon the loyalty of some
  seven hundred natives who formed part of the force. Our sorrow was great when
  we learned, by a loyal native who had made his way through the lines in
  disguise, that Sir Henry Lawrence had been killed by the bursting of a shell
  in the first day of the siege, and grave doubts were entertained as to
  whether Lucknow, besieged by an immense body of armed mutineers, would hold
  out until Havelock could get back from Cawnpore.</p>

  <p>I have learned since that, by every military test, Lucknow was
  indefensible; and yet this gallant force held on month after month until, on
  September 23rd, the guns of Havelock's army were heard muttering in the
  distance, though we did not know it, and whilst we were speculating upon
  Lucknow's fate, the relief column had already entered the city, Havelock
  being accompanied by Sir James Outram.</p>

  <p>I fear our jubilation at this news was premature, for though Havelock had
  succeeded in relieving the garrison, his force was so small that he was no
  sooner in than he too was besieged. But now Sir Colin Campbell had arrived
  from England and the large force engaged in subduing Delhi was ordered to
  march on Agra. It was not until November 3rd, after a succession of battles,
  in one of which, at Agra, we were nearly defeated, that we marched into
  Lucknow, a mass of soldiers and volunteers, as hard as nails.</p>

  <p>During that last battle on the open plain of Dilkusha, which ended with
  the storming of Sikandra Badh, occurred the most fateful moments of my life.
  For here passed that great soul Harry Avon, the last of that branch of our
  house which we call "the Black."</p>

  <p>Just before the final assault, I saw him bandaging his calf, which had
  been torn by a Sepoy's bullet. I see him now with the light of good humour in
  his eyes, his black beard streaked here and there with white.</p>

  <p>"Go back to the surgeon, Harry," I begged him, but he laughed at the
  thought.</p>

  <p>"Red Avon a lord&mdash;Black Avon a sword!" he quoted. "Brother, this
  smells like Waterloo!" (Though we were cousins, 'brother' was a favourite
  term of address on his part). "And this day is the Waterloo of the rebels,"
  he said, and just then the bugles sounded the rally.</p>

  <p>The last I saw of him he was running ahead of his men, a sword in one
  hand, a revolving pistol in the other...and then, in the whirl and confusion
  of battle, he vanished. Great clouds of smoke obscured the ridge his regiment
  had charged; the air trembled to the thud and clamour of explosions, and
  before I realized what was happening, I too was going forward, bayonets
  glittering to left and right of me...</p>

  <p>The thunder of the guns, the whirl of the bullets, the cries of the
  wounded, the heat, the stench of it all, will remain with me to my dying
  day.</p>

  <p>And when it was all over I found Harry. He lay face upward between two
  dead Sepoys, and, looking down at him, I thought he was asleep.</p>
