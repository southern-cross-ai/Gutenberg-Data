  <h2><a id="chap1"
     name="chap1">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The mist was low-lying. Above it the tops of the telegraph
  poles stuck out into the starlit night, marking the line of the road which
  wound over the desolate fen country. A few isolated houses stood like
  scattered islands in a sea of white cloud&mdash;houses in which the lights
  had long been extinguished, for it was nearing midnight, and the marsh folk
  do not sit up late.</p>

  <p>One house only proved the exception. In size and shape it was just as the
  others&mdash;a typical fenman's cottage. But from one side of it a diffused
  white glow shone faintly towards the line of telegraph posts. Above the mist
  the top room showed black and clear-cut. No light came from that window: the
  illumination came from the sitting-room below.</p>

  <p>In it was seated a very large young man. Between his knees he held a gun,
  whilst on the table in front of him lay the usual cleaning materials, flanked
  on the left by a large hunk of bread and cheese, and on the right by a
  tankard of ale. Behind him, on the hearth-rug, a spaniel lay curled up
  asleep. In front of him, and close to the door which communicated with the
  kitchen, a bulldog in a basket snored majestically: also in front of him, and
  close to the door which led into the diminutive hall, a wire-haired terrier
  hunted ecstatically in his dreams.</p>

  <p>The blind was up: the window, regardless of the mist which drifted
  sluggishly in, was open top and bottom. On the table a lamp was burning, and
  by its light the contents of the room stood revealed. And when those contents
  were compared with the living occupant the result was somewhat
  incongruous.</p>

  <p>Over the mantelpiece hung several illuminated texts. They were of a
  depressing character, which a tasteful colour scheme of yellow beads round
  red letters was powerless to mitigate. Even a wedding group of the early
  'sixties, which filled the place of honour in the centre, seemed unable to
  give that snap to the wall which the proud owner had doubtless intended. And
  the rest of the room was in keeping. A horsehair sofa covered with a red
  counterpane in which were sewn large, round pieces of coloured glass, adorned
  one wall: a table, complete with cloth to match the counterpane, and a
  stuffed weasel under a glass dome, adorned another. And in the window, on a
  small three-legged stool, reposed a Bible of colossal dimensions.</p>

  <p>To the expert the solution was obvious on the spot. This was the parlour;
  that mysterious, unused room which is found in every similar house; that
  room, which, when the door is suddenly opened on the unwary visitor, exudes a
  strange and musty smell strongly reminiscent of a not too recent death behind
  the wainscot: that room which is utterly wasted on the altar of lower class
  respectability.</p>

  <p>On the night when the mist was drifting just ceiling high the room was
  proving false to its traditions. Gone was the stale smell of ancient bones:
  even "Prepare to meet thy God" hung at a more rakish angle. The first was due
  to the open window: the second to the fact that a disreputable cap was slung
  on one end of the text. But the effect was all to the good. And since the
  large young man who at the moment was engaged in filling his pipe was
  presumably responsible for both acts of vandalism, it might be well to turn
  from the room to its occupant.</p>

  <p>His clothes were quite incredibly ancient. Grey flannel trousers: a
  sweater that had once been white, and an old shooting-coat padded with
  leather over the shoulders comprised the outer layer. Underneath, grey socks
  and brown brogues, with a shirt that was open at the neck completed the
  picture, whilst a collar, made of the same material as the shirt, had been
  flung carelessly into the coal-scuttle with a tie inside it.</p>

  <p>After a while he rose and stretched himself, and it was not until he stood
  up that it was possible to realise how very large he was. He stood at least
  six feet in height, and being broad in proportion he seemed almost to fill
  the room. Only the spaniel noticed his movement and opened one liquid brown
  eye&mdash;an eye which followed him as he sauntered over to the window and
  peered out. Then he returned to the table and, picking up his empty tankard,
  he made his way past the snorer to the kitchen. A final pint was indicated
  before turning in.</p>

  <p>It was while he was drawing it that the terrier gave a sudden, sharp,
  staccato bark, and the large young man returned to the parlour to find that
  the kennels were awake. The spaniel was sitting up contemplating the window;
  the bulldog, though still breathing hard, had emerged from his basket, whilst
  the terrier was following up his one bark with a steady stream of bad
  language under his breath.</p>

  <p>"What is it, fellers?" said the large young man genially. "Does some
  varlet approach our domain?"</p>

  <p>Holding his beer in his hand he again went to the window.</p>

  <p>"Shut up, Jock, you ass!" he cried. "How can I hear anything if you're
  making that damn fool noise?"</p>

  <p>The terrier made a valiant effort which was partially successful; and then
  the strain proved too great. And this time his master heard it too. From
  somewhere, not very far away, there came a muffled shout, and Jock proclaimed
  the fact in no uncertain voice&mdash;no just reason, he reflected, for being
  temporarily winded with a shooting-boot.</p>

  <p>The large young man stood motionless, listening intently. The sound was
  not repeated, but it seemed to him that it had not been so much a cry for
  help as a call from one man to another indicating that he had found
  something. But who could be looking for anything at midnight in the fens,
  with a ground mist lying thick?</p>

  <p>The shout had come, so far as he could judge, from the road which passed
  his own front gate ten yards away. And he was on the point of strolling down
  the little garden path to investigate further, when a development occurred
  which was so completely unexpected that for a few moments he could only stare
  foolishly round the room; whilst even Jock, by this time recovered, forgot to
  bark. There came a crash of breaking glass, followed by a further crash of
  still more breaking glass, and the stuffed weasel subsided with a thud on to
  the carpet.</p>

  <p>The large young man had been getting his cap when it happened, otherwise
  the stone which he now perceived was the cause of the outrage would have
  spared the weasel and taken him in the pit of the stomach. For the first
  crash of breaking glass had been the window, which, having been open top and
  bottom, now had both upper and lower panes smashed. Thence the missile,
  missing the lamp by a few inches, had smitten the glass dome of the weasel
  hip and thigh, and ricochetting off the wall had finished up by the bulldog's
  basket.</p>

  <p>"Hi!" shouted the large young man, when he had recovered himself, "what
  the devil do you think you're doing?"</p>

  <p>His momentary amazement had given way to anger: someone had deliberately
  thrown a stone through the window from the road, and it did not strike him as
  being in the slightest degree funny. Some tramp presumably, or a belated
  drunk: in any case, whoever it turned out to be, he was going to be thanked
  in suitable terms in the near future. Indubitably the large young man was not
  amused.</p>

  <p>"Heel! The lot of you."</p>

  <p>He strode down the garden path, and flinging open the little gate stepped
  into the road.</p>

  <p>"Where's the lousy swine who bunged that brick through my window?" he
  called out.</p>

  <p>There was no answer, and for a moment or two he stood undecided, with the
  dogs at his heels. He could hear no sound save the cry of a distant night
  bird, and gradually the difficulty of the position came home to him. The
  mist, if anything, was thicker; he could see the light from the room he had
  just left like a dull yellow square in the surrounding whiteness. But the
  trouble was he had no means of telling which way the stone-thrower had gone
  after he had done the deed. The fog had swallowed him up completely.</p>

  <p>Again he listened intently, and, as he stood there motionless,
  subconsciously he became aware of the strange silence of the three dogs. He
  glanced down at them: in the dim light he could see their heads close
  together over something in the road. He spoke to them and they looked up at
  him. Between them, in the dust, was a dark patch.</p>

  <p>The large young man lit a match and bent down to examine it. And after a
  while he gave a low whistle. For the patch was still wet, and it was
  red&mdash;that unmistakable red which can only be one thing. It was blood,
  and why should a tramp or a belated drunk be bleeding?</p>

  <p>He straightened up and lit a cigarette: the mystery was becoming stranger
  and stranger. That the blood was recent was obvious, otherwise it would have
  dried in the dust. And it therefore seemed fairly conclusive to him that it
  had come from the man who had thrown the stone. But why should an injured
  man, who was so badly hurt that he was bleeding, do what he had done? Why
  hadn't he come up to the cottage and asked for help?</p>

  <p>Suddenly Jock began to growl under his breath, though his master could
  hear nothing suspicious. Until, a few moments later, he heard very faintly in
  the distance the unmistakable hum of an engine. A motor-car was coming along
  the road, and the driver had evidently got into a low gear.</p>

  <p>The large young man hesitated; then, with a quick order to his dogs, he
  stepped back on to the garden path, and, closing the gate, he stood leaning
  over it. He felt instinctively that this car, nosing its way through the fog,
  was connected in some way with the unknown stone-thrower who had come out of
  the night and disappeared into it again, leaving only the ominous red patch
  to mark his passing.</p>

  <p>Gradually the noise of the car grew louder, until with unexpected
  suddenness two headlights loomed up out of the mist. They came abreast the
  gate, and then they halted; the driver had stopped the car. Voices sounded
  over the noise of the engine; then one of the doors opened and shut, and
  footsteps approached the gate.</p>

  <p>The man who had got out had his hand actually on the latch, when the glow
  of a cigarette within a few inches of his face caused him to start
  violently.</p>

  <p>"Good evening," said the large young man pleasantly. "Can I be of any
  assistance?"</p>

  <p>He drew hard at his cigarette, and in the glow he got a quick glimpse of
  the new-comer. The man wore no hat, and his hair was cropped short, whilst
  his features had that square cut, Teutonic look which branded him at once as
  a German, even without the muttered "<i>Gott im Himmel</i>" that he
  ejaculated under his breath at the shock of finding the gate occupied.</p>

  <p>"Have you seen a man?" he began, when once again a door in the car opened
  and shut, and further footsteps approached the gate. But this time the
  visitor carried an electric torch which he flashed on to the large young
  man's face. From there it travelled downwards, pausing for a moment on
  oil-stained hands, and finishing up with the incredibly dirty trousers.</p>

  <p>"Have you been here long, my man?" said the new arrival curtly, and in the
  darkness the large young man smiled. Evidently by his clothes he had been
  judged.</p>

  <p>"Nigh on thirty year coom next cherry-picking," he answered, hoping
  fervently that his attempt at dialect would pass muster. What dialect it was
  supposed to be he had no idea, but to his profound relief it seemed to go
  down.</p>

  <p>"I don't mean that," snapped the other. "Have you been standing by this
  gate for long?"</p>

  <p>He turned and gave a rapid order to the German beside him, who disappeared
  back into the car, and the engine stopped.</p>

  <p>"Maybe five minutes&mdash;maybe more," said the large young man. "Why do
  'ee ask?"</p>

  <p>"Have you seen a man come along the road?"</p>

  <p>"Old Gaffer Sheepshank, he coom along round about seven. He wor
  drunk."</p>

  <p>The other swore under his breath.</p>

  <p>"Just recently, I mean. Within the last few minutes."</p>

  <p>"Noa. I ain't seen no one. What sort of a man do 'ee mean?"</p>

  <p>But a sudden exclamation from the road interrupted their conversation.</p>

  <p>"Emil," called out a harsh voice, "come here at once! Bring your
  torch."</p>

  <p>The large young man thoughtfully ground out with his heel the cigarette he
  was smoking, and wondered what was going to happen next. For the gentleman
  who had called for Emil was now examining with keen interest the patch of
  blood that had happened to show up clearly in the headlights of the car. And
  then, after a few moments' earnest conversation, Emil returned to the
  gate.</p>

  <p>"Now, look here, my man," he said quietly, "I take it this is your
  cottage."</p>

  <p>"'Tis my fayther's."</p>

  <p>"Is your father here?"</p>

  <p>"Not to-night. He be in Norwich."</p>

  <p>"So you're all alone in the house?"</p>

  <p>"That's right, mister."</p>

  <p>"Are you quite sure?" A sinister note had crept into the speaker's
  voice.</p>

  <p>"Course I'm sure. Do 'ee think I'm daft?"</p>

  <p>The torch flashed on again, and by its light the large young man saw that
  he was covered by a revolver.</p>

  <p>"Get indoors," snapped the other. "And get a move on, I'm in a hurry.
  Now," he continued, when they were both standing in the parlour, "what have
  you done with the man who came along this road a few minutes ago?"</p>

  <p>"I tell 'ee I ain't seen no man," was the stubborn answer. "And I reckons
  you'd better put that there toy away or it might go off. A pretty thing
  this&mdash;in a man's own house."</p>

  <p>The large young man sat down in an arm-chair by the hearth-rug ostensibly
  to pat the spaniel, but in reality to smuggle his Free Forester tie from the
  coal-scuttle into his trousers pocket. This man Emil defeated him. His
  English was perfect, without the suspicion of an accent: to look at he might
  have been an Englishman. And yet there was something intangible about him
  that placed him as a foreigner. His clothes were faultless&mdash;perhaps a
  shade too faultless for the country. And on one finger of his left hand he
  wore a ring with a peculiar blue stone in it.</p>

  <p>The tie smuggled successfully into his pocket the young man rose, the
  picture of aggrieved, bucolic indignation.</p>

  <p>"Look 'ee 'ere, mister," he said angrily, "I'm tired of thy fooling.
  Search the house if it gives thee any satisfaction, and then get thee gone.
  I'm fair sick of the sight of thy ugly fiz, and if I knew who it was I'd have
  the law on 'ee to-morrow."</p>

  <p>But the man called Emil took no notice. His revolver had dropped to his
  side: his gaze was riveted on the broken window.</p>

  <p>"When did that happen?" he said slowly.</p>

  <p>"What the 'ell's that to do with thee?"</p>

  <p>"Silence, you fool!"</p>

  <p>His glance wandered to the broken cover of the stuffed weasel, and finally
  rested on the stone itself, which he bent down and picked up. Then, balancing
  it in his hand, he fixed the large young man with a pair of dark, penetrating
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"When did this happen?" he repeated softly.</p>

  <p>"What's that to do with thee?"</p>

  <p>"Who threw this stone through the window?"</p>

  <p>"Danged if I knows, mister."</p>

  <p>"How long ago did it happen?"</p>

  <p>For the fraction of a second the young man hesitated: then he made up his
  mind he would tell the truth. It seemed to him that by doing so he stood a
  better chance of getting some light thrown on a mystery that was growing more
  incomprehensible every minute.</p>

  <p>"Nigh about ten minutes," he said. "T'wor that that took me down to
  gate."</p>

  <p>"So." The other's eyes bored into him. "So. And you did not see the man
  who threw the stone?"</p>

  <p>"Noa."</p>

  <p>"Did he call out to you? Speak to you?"</p>

  <p>"Noa."</p>

  <p>"What did you do after it happened?"</p>

  <p>"Got cap and went to gate with pups."</p>

  <p>"And you saw no sign of him?"</p>

  <p>"Noa."</p>

  <p>The man called Emil crossed to the window and shouted, and his companion
  who had discovered the blood in the road joined him at once. They stood
  conversing in low voices in a tongue which the large young man recognised as
  German. One or two stray phrases came to his ear: "<i>dummer Bauer</i>"
  (imbecile peasant) ... "<i>Zeitvergeudung</i>" (waste of time); remarks which
  he had no difficulty in interpreting. Up to date, at any rate, it was clear
  that he had bluffed them into thinking he was a local product. But what
  infuriated him was that he was still as far off as ever from discovering what
  all the excitement was about. And then suddenly he caught another sentence:
  "<i>sich versichern</i>" (better make sure).</p>

  <p>Better make sure. Sure of what? He was not left long in doubt. The second
  man vaulted through the open window and vanished upstairs. His steps could be
  heard going into each room above: then he came down again and went into the
  kitchen.</p>

  <p>"<i>Nichts</i>" (nothing), he said, reappearing. "Search him," ordered his
  leader, and the large young man recoiled a pace.</p>

  <p>"'Ere&mdash;wot do 'ee think 'ee be a'doing of?" he cried, only to find
  the revolver pointing unwaveringly at his heart.</p>

  <p>"Put your hands above your head!"</p>

  <p>The order was curt, and, after a pause, the large young man obeyed. Not
  that there was anything incriminating in his pockets, except that confounded
  Free Forester tie, and his pulse beat a trifle faster when he saw it
  extracted and thrown on the table. Worse still, it fell in such a position
  that the name of the shop where it had been bought lay uppermost for all to
  see, and Norfolk yokels rarely buy their neckwear from Mr. Black, of Jermyn
  Street. But his luck held; neither man paid any attention to it whatever.
  Evidently they were looking for something else, and the question which began
  to hammer at his brain, even before he was allowed to put his hands down,
  was&mdash;what? Assuming that he was a labourer, as they undoubtedly did,
  what under the sun could they expect to find in his pockets which could
  possibly prove of the slightest interest to them?</p>

  <p>At last the searcher was satisfied, and once again the two men held an
  earnest conversation. But this time their voices were so low that the
  listener could hear nothing. Evidently the man who had searched him was
  urging Emil to do something, and Emil was doubtful. At length, however, he
  seemed convinced, and having nodded his head two or three times, his
  companion returned to the car and re-started the engine, leaving Emil and the
  large young man alone.</p>

  <p>"Can you keep your mouth shut, my man?"</p>

  <p>The rustle of notes came pleasantly to the ear.</p>

  <p>"If so be, mister, that folks make it worth my while."</p>

  <p>"A lunatic has escaped from a private asylum," said Emil, "and he is the
  poor fellow who threw the stone through your window. We are trying to find
  him, but we do not wish it talked about. Here are two pounds which will pay
  for mending the glass."</p>

  <p>He placed the notes on the table, and the large young man eyed them
  greedily.</p>

  <p>"In a day or two," continued the other, "I shall be returning this way,
  and I shall make a point of calling in at the pub. And if I find that no one
  knows anything about this there will be three more to mend the cover of the
  stuffed animal. But if I find that people do know, why then&mdash;God help
  you!"</p>

  <p>He said the last three words very softly, and the large young man stared
  at him thoughtfully. For the moment he had forgotten his role of bucolic
  yokel; he was only conscious that opposite him was standing a very dangerous
  customer. And as his eyes fell on that tell-tale tie lying on the table he
  became conscious also of a profound feeling of relief that his
  <i>vis-à-vis'</i> cricketing education had been neglected.</p>

  <p>"You understand what I say?"</p>

  <p>"Aye, mister. I'll say nowt."</p>

  <p>With a nod the man called Emil left the room and strode down the garden
  path. And it was not until the sound of the engine was getting faint in the
  distance that the large young man stretched himself and lit another
  cigarette.</p>

  <p>"What the devil does it all mean, Jerry?" he said, apostrophising the
  bulldog. "Why does Mr. Emil tell me such a fatuous lie, even if he does think
  I'm a half-wit? Why do people throw bricks through the window, and leave
  pools of blood in the road? Presumably there is some reason, but for the life
  of me I can't see what it is at the moment."</p>

  <p>He glanced at his watch: it was nearly one o'clock, and he gave a
  prodigious yawn.</p>

  <p>"To-morrow we will battle with the enigma," he announced. "To-morrow
  father will bring the grey matter to bear on what is at present shrouded in
  impenetrable gloom. To-night&mdash;bed."</p>

  <p>And even as he spoke, sharp and clear through the stillness there came the
  sound of one solitary shot.</p>

  <p>The dogs stirred; the large young man stiffened abruptly. The noise had
  come from the direction in which the car had gone, and he waited tensely.
  Silence: the sound was not repeated. But there had been no mistaking what it
  was. Someone had fired a revolver.</p>

  <p>"Stay where you are, boys!"</p>

  <p>The front door banged behind him, and the dogs, after one wistful look,
  relapsed once more into slumber, as their master, running with the easy
  stride of a born athlete, followed the car. The mist was still heavy, but as
  he got farther from the cottage, clear pockets began to appear from time to
  time. And it was as he was passing through one of these, that he heard in
  front of him the thrumming of an engine. He had caught up with the car.</p>

  <p>He halted abruptly; then, getting on to the grass verge, he crept forward
  cautiously. The noise of the engine grew louder; he could hear voices ahead.
  And then suddenly, looming out of the fog which had again closed down on the
  road, he saw the red tail light of the car.</p>

  <p>Inch by inch he moved towards it, fearful that at any moment a sudden eddy
  of breeze might clear the mist away and show him up. But he need not have
  worried: he had arrived at the end of the entertainment. He was still two or
  three yards from the back of the car when the driver let in his gear, the red
  light disappeared into the fog, and half a minute later all was silent
  again.</p>

  <p>The large young man stepped out into the road and moved a few paces
  forward. What had they found in that particular spot to fire at? Was it the
  man they were looking for&mdash;the man who had presumably thrown the stone
  through the window? And even as he asked himself the question there came the
  ominous answer. No small patch this time, but a great dark pool stained the
  road at his feet. Blood again, and he grunted savagely.</p>

  <p>"The poor devil must have damned near bled to death," he muttered under
  his breath.</p>

  <p>With the help of a box of matches he searched the surrounding ground, but
  he could find nothing. At one point the grass seemed a little beaten down,
  but whether that had been done by the man in the car or by somebody else
  earlier in the day it was impossible to tell. And at last he gave it up and
  started back to the cottage.</p>

  <p>He walked slowly, his hands in his pockets. Try as he would, he could get
  no possible solution that fitted. There always seemed to be something that
  refused to come into line. If, as appeared obvious, a wounded man was being
  pursued by the occupants of the car&mdash;a wounded man, moreover, who was
  capable of throwing a stone with considerable force, and after doing so of
  walking or crawling over a quarter of a mile&mdash;why had he not come to the
  cottage? Answer&mdash;because he guessed the cottage would be searched. Then
  why throw the stone? What good could it possibly do?</p>

  <p>He opened the gate and turned up the path, vainly racking his brains for a
  solution. The dogs stirred lazily, and for a while he stood in the door
  staring round the room. And then his eyes narrowed. The things on the table
  had been moved. The oil bottle and rag were not in the same position; the gun
  itself was not where he had left it.</p>

  <p>Quietly he walked across, and sitting down in the chair he opened the
  drawer of the table. And there he found proof positive; some papers which had
  been in front were now pushed to one side. Someone had been in the room in
  the last quarter of an hour. The two notes still remained on the cloth: it
  was clearly not the work of a tramp or a passing thief. So there was no doubt
  left in his mind as to whom it was the work of. Somebody had been left behind
  when the car drove away with instructions to watch the cottage, and he had
  seized the opportunity of the owner's absence to search it. The point was
  whether he was still there.</p>

  <p>The large young man's eyes strayed towards the kitchen door: it was as he
  had left it. Unlikely, he reflected, that the man would be in the house, but
  he decided to make sure. He sauntered across and flung the door open; the
  room beyond was empty. Presumably therefore, if his visitor was there at all
  he was outside, hiding somewhere in the little garden.</p>

  <p>There the dogs would come in. Only too well did their master know the
  unfailing courtesy with which they all three welcomed strangers inside the
  house: in all probability they had sat round the man as he searched hoping
  for biscuits. Outside it would be a very different matter.</p>

  <p>"Jock! Jerry!"</p>

  <p>He opened the front door, the terrier and the bulldog beside him.</p>

  <p>"See him off! Good dogs! See him off!"</p>

  <p>And then things happened quickly. Like a streak of lightning the terrier
  shot across a flower bed, barking furiously; his grunting companion at his
  heels. Came a commotion in some shrubs, and a yell of terror followed by
  ominous tearing sounds. Then footsteps going at speed up the road, urged on
  evidently by Jock.</p>

  <p>Not so Jerry. Not for him such violent exercise at these ungodly hours:
  besides, his part of the performance was over. Snorting dispassionately, he
  waddled into sight, and deposited at his master's feet the spoils of war.
  Then he returned to his basket, whilst the large young man examined the
  catch.</p>

  <p>"First blood to us, Jerry," he remarked approvingly. "The seat of his
  pants, or I'm a Dutchman. That'll larn the blighter. For all that, I wish to
  Heaven I could think why we are thus honoured."</p>

  <p>He gave another vast yawn, and went over to the window; whatever the
  solution of the mystery might prove to be, there was nothing more to be done
  that night. The cottage did not boast of a telephone, and the nearest police
  station was five miles away. And since his car was being repaired in
  Sheringham, and would not be back till the following morning, there was no
  possible method of getting there except by walking, the mere thought of which
  caused him to break into a cold sweat.</p>

  <p>Jock had returned, and his master pulled down the lower sash of the
  window. Broken glass fell on the floor, though most of it still remained
  between the two panes&mdash;large, jagged pieces, wickedly dangerous for
  dog's paws. So he raised the top sash carefully, and even as he put out one
  hand to catch the rest, he saw it. In between the fragments lay a piece of
  crumpled paper.</p>

  <p>For a moment or two its significance did not strike him, and he carried
  the handful of glass over to the table. Then he extracted the paper and
  looked at it. In the centre was a frayed hole, and there were two or three
  crimson smears near it. But it was the scrawled words that riveted his
  attention.</p>

  <p><i>Mary Jane. Urgent. G G Pont. A5.</i></p>

  <p>He had the greatest difficulty in making out the words, which had been
  written with a blunt pencil. And when he had deciphered them, they did not
  seem to convey much. But, as he began to reason things out, the piece of
  paper conveyed a great deal. Things, at last, were becoming clearer, and with
  increased lucidity came increased caution. The mist had lifted; the road was
  deserted, but the large young man went to the window and pulled down the
  blind. So this piece of paper was what his visitors had been looking for. The
  writer must have wrapped it round the stone, and thrown it through the
  window. And the glass cutting it, had left the stone free to go on, whilst
  the wrapping had remained between the two panes&mdash;the one place where no
  one had thought of searching.</p>

  <p>Thoughtfully he folded the paper up and put it in his pocket. And had the
  man called Emil seen Hugh Drummond's expression as he blew out the lamp, it
  might have caused him food for thought.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap2"
     name="chap2">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It has been stated somewhere that men can be divided into
  two classes&mdash;those who can and those who can not stop a dog fight. With
  equal justification the classification might be, those who look for trouble
  and those who do not. So that it was a trifle unfortunate for the nocturnal
  motorists that by no possible stretch of imagination could the recipient of
  the brick be placed in the second category.</p>

  <p>Hugh Drummond had come to his old nurse's cottage, during her temporary
  absence, for a few days duck-shooting, but with the arrival of that cryptic
  message out of the fog all ideas of that innocent pastime had at once left
  his head. And when he awoke the next morning to find the sun pouring through
  the window of his bedroom he was still of the same way of thinking.</p>

  <p>That he ought, as a right-minded citizen, to take the message and story to
  the police was obvious. The trouble was that he did not feel in the least
  degree like doing so. A hard-worked body of men: it struck him that it would
  be a crime to overburden them still more. Besides, he felt that the reception
  of his story by the local constable would probably leave much to be desired.
  But for the broken windows of the parlour he himself could almost have
  believed the whole thing to have been a nightmare. What then was the reaction
  of the village guardian of the peace going to be?</p>

  <p>A cheerful rat-tat on the door announced the arrival of the post and
  Drummond put his head out of the window.</p>

  <p>"Morning, Joe. Anything for me?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir," said the postman. "Two for Mrs. Eskdale. Be she coming back
  this morning?"</p>

  <p>"She is, Joe."</p>

  <p>The postman's glance strayed to the parlour window.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord, sir! what have 'ee been doing here?"</p>

  <p>"Got angry with it and bit it, Joe," answered the other with a grin.
  "Chuck the letters through the bottom hole into the parlour."</p>

  <p>The postman did as he was asked, still clearly intrigued beyond measure at
  the broken glass.</p>

  <p>"It was all right yesterday evening, sir," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"Indigestion in the middle of the night, Joe: eating glass is the best
  thing in the world for it."</p>

  <p>"Strikes me a motor-car had indigestion up the road there, too: I never
  did see such a pool of oil. Ten times the size of that there one outside your
  gate."</p>

  <p>"What's that, Joe?"</p>

  <p>Hugh Drummond, who had slipped on a shirt and a pair of flannel trousers,
  appeared at the door.</p>

  <p>"Oil outside the gate? Let's go and have a look at it."</p>

  <p>The dew was still heavy on the grass as the two men strolled down the
  path, with the dogs behind them.</p>

  <p>"B'ain't nothing to pool up further," repeated the postman. "There it
  be."</p>

  <p>"So I see," said the other thoughtfully. "Yes&mdash;that's oil right
  enough."</p>

  <p>"Darned near skidded in other patch, I did." The postman prepared to mount
  his bicycle. "Dratted stinking machines, I calls 'em. Well, good morning,
  sir."</p>

  <p>"Morning, Joe."</p>

  <p>For a moment or two it was on the tip of his tongue to ask this reservoir
  of local gossip if any strangers had been seen in the neighbourhood, but he
  refrained. If they had, he reflected, Joe would have passed it on by now; and
  if they had not it would only whet still more that worthy's insatiable
  curiosity, already strained to bursting point by the broken window.</p>

  <p>He watched the postman cycle away; then he again looked at the pool of
  oil. Nothing very interesting about it, except one thing. It exactly covered
  and obliterated the pool of blood which had been there a few hours
  previously.</p>

  <p>"Interesting," he muttered to himself. "Very interesting. One wonders
  excessively."</p>

  <p>He whistled the dogs to follow him and started up the road. He did not
  wonder at all: he knew what he was going to find, but it was better to make
  certain. And sure enough he had only gone a bare quarter of a mile when he
  saw a large dark patch in the dust in front of him. There was no mistake
  about it: beside it was the beaten-down bit of the verge. This was the place
  where he had overtaken the car.</p>

  <p>For a while he stood there smoking thoughtfully. This oil had not been put
  down at the time&mdash;that he was prepared to swear. Therefore someone had
  been sent back during the night to do it. A clumsy way of covering their
  tracks: oil does not generally flow from a motor-car quite so prolifically.
  Besides, this was new oil, and not old stuff from the sump. At the same time
  it was difficult to see what better method could have been thought of on the
  spur of the moment. And one thing it proved conclusively: Mr. Emil and Co.
  were desperately anxious to blush unseen.</p>

  <p>He strolled back to the cottage, where a loud hissing noise in the kitchen
  announced that the kettle was boiling, and made himself some tea. As a cook
  he did not excel, but having raided the local hen he was proceeding to boil
  the fruit of her labours, when a knock on the front door and a chorus from
  the dogs proclaimed a visitor.</p>

  <p>"Come in," shouted Drummond. "I shan't be long."</p>

  <p>"Will the bulldog bite?" asked a very delightful feminine voice.</p>

  <p>The chef paused in his work. Who the deuce could this be?</p>

  <p>"Jerry&mdash;come here, you blighter!" he cried as he went to the front
  door. "How dare you..."</p>

  <p>He paused again. Confronting him was a charming-looking girl of about
  twenty-five. What she was dressed in his masculine eye somewhat naturally
  failed to notice, except that it seemed the goods. Also it most certainly was
  not the raiment one would expect to see at that hour of the morning in the
  middle of the fen country.</p>

  <p>"Forgive me," he murmured, "I was expecting a dear old lady whose
  dimensions are somewhat similar to those of a steam-roller, and your sudden
  appearance rather shook me. Won't you come in?"</p>

  <p>The girl stared at him in silence for a moment or two, and it seemed to
  him that a look of surprise flashed across her face.</p>

  <p>"My car has broken down," she said at length. "It is just a few yards up
  the road. I wondered if you had a telephone here, so that I could ring up a
  garage."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid that's beyond me," he confessed. "The telephone is a <i>rara
  avis</i> in these parts. But perhaps I might be able to help, and if I can't
  my own car is being brought here shortly by a bloke from a garage. He'll do
  the necessary if it defeats me. Let's go and have a look."</p>

  <p>"So you have a car, have you?" she said. "I should have thought that was
  even more of a <i>rara avis</i> round here than a telephone."</p>

  <p>They were strolling along the road towards a small two-seater, which, with
  its back towards them, was standing motionless a couple of hundred yards
  away.</p>

  <p>"Amongst the inhabitants, you're right," he agreed. "I am only a
  visitor."</p>

  <p>"Are you in that little cottage all by yourself?"</p>

  <p>"Until Nanny comes back," he said with a grin. "She is the steam-roller I
  told you I was expecting."</p>

  <p>She stared at him with a slightly puzzled frown.</p>

  <p>"I don't quite understand," she said. "Where do you live usually?"</p>

  <p>"In London&mdash;where, I trust, I shall have the pleasure of renewing
  your acquaintance."</p>

  <p>"But why on earth do you come to a place like this?"</p>

  <p>"For excitement," he told her, "when London gets too dull. One would never
  find anyone like you on the doorstep along with the morning milk in the old
  metropolis."</p>

  <p>But her frown was still there, though she smiled faintly.</p>

  <p>"You're rather an extraordinary individual," she remarked. "Have you been
  here long?"</p>

  <p>"Two days," he answered. "Now let's have a look at the bus."</p>

  <p>He opened the bonnet, and even as he did so he heard a little gasp. He
  glanced up: the girl, with her eyes closed, was holding on to the door.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" he cried. "Aren't you feeling well?"</p>

  <p>"Would you get me some water?" she muttered. "My head is all
  swimming."</p>

  <p>"Of course I will. I won't be a second. Get into the car and sit
  down."</p>

  <p>He raced back towards the cottage and got a glass of cold water. Pray
  Allah she was not going to throw a faint, he reflected. Hugh Drummond's ideas
  of first aid were most sketchy. But when he got back to the car she seemed to
  have partially recovered, though she sipped the water gratefully.</p>

  <p>"Sorry to be so silly," she said apologetically, "but I have not had any
  breakfast."</p>

  <p>"My dear soul," he cried, "that must be remedied at once. If you can bear
  a boiled egg, or, better still, can do something in the bacon line, we will
  do the trick at my cottage."</p>

  <p>"I ought to be getting on," she answered doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"That's out of the question until you've had some food. Breakfast first;
  then we'll tackle the car."</p>

  <p>She allowed herself to be persuaded, and they walked back to the cottage
  together.</p>

  <p>"Where are you off to that makes a start at such an ungodly hour
  necessary?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"To a house not far from Cambridge," she answered. "My uncle's place. And
  he wanted me there early to get some wretched tennis tournament fixed up for
  this afternoon. Good heavens! What have you been doing to the windows? I
  didn't notice them before."</p>

  <p>"A merry Norfolk pastime," he said with a smile. "Some blighter wished it
  on me last night."</p>

  <p>"What <i>do</i> you mean?" she cried.</p>

  <p>"A fact," he assured her. "Someone threw a brick through the window and
  nearly hit little Willie in the tummy."</p>

  <p>"What on earth did he do that for?"</p>

  <p>"The ways of drunks are passing strange," he answered. "But I don't know
  what the proud owner will say when she sees it."</p>

  <p>It was the story he had decided to tell Mrs. Eskdale, and since the two
  women were likely to overlap it saved bother to spin the same yarn to
  both.</p>

  <p>"Are you expecting her back soon?"</p>

  <p>"At any moment. And then, providing we've got your car right, I'm off to
  London."</p>

  <p>"Country getting too exciting?"</p>

  <p>"That's the idea."</p>

  <p>He poured out the tea and went into the kitchen to get the eggs.</p>

  <p>"Put some milk in mine, like an angel," he called out. "And
  two&mdash;lumps of sugar."</p>

  <p>For the fraction of a second he had paused as he spoke; for the fraction
  of a second he had stood motionless, his eyes glued to the mirror which hung
  above the little range. For in it he had seen the reflection of the girl
  seated at the table. And she was putting something into his tea which most
  certainly was not milk.</p>

  <p>He forced himself to continue speaking mechanically, but his brain was
  racing overtime. He knew his eyes had not deceived him, and the shock was a
  considerable one. It was such a complete surprise. That the girl was anything
  but what she seemed on the surface had never entered his mind for an instant.
  But now as he went on talking he was trying to adjust himself to this new
  development.</p>

  <p>If&mdash;and there was no doubt about it&mdash;she had put dope in his tea
  she must be mixed up with the bunch of last night. And at once the reason for
  the look of surprise on her face when she first saw him was clear. She had
  been expecting a man of the labourer type, and instead she had met him.</p>

  <p>The point to be decided, however, was what to do next. He was convinced
  that she had not the slightest suspicion that he had seen her, and the
  essential thing was that she should continue in the same state of ignorance.
  At the same time the little matter of the tea had to be settled. And so,
  being a direct person, he disposed of it at once. He tackled the loaf and the
  knife slipped. Thence his elbow took the cup: his trousers took the tea, and
  the thing was done save for some mild and suitable blasphemy.</p>

  <p>"I am a clumsy devil," he cried. "And, ye gods! that tea is hot. Will you
  excuse me while I go and remove these garments?"</p>

  <p>"Of course," she said. "You poor man! How it must have hurt."</p>

  <p>She was all anxious commiseration: not by the flicker of an eyelid did she
  show any annoyance at the failure of her scheme. And as he changed he
  wondered what her next move was going to be. Sleep dope&mdash;at least he
  hoped it had been no worse than that; she was such an astoundingly attractive
  filly. Just something to drug him while she once more searched the house for
  that paper. It surely must be important&mdash;that message that had been
  wrapped round the stone&mdash;for them to take all this trouble to find it.
  And they could not be looking for anything else.</p>

  <p>They were thorough, too, sending this girl as a follow up; they left
  nothing to chance. So thorough, in fact, that he removed the paper which he
  had placed for safety in the lining of his hat, and having finally and
  definitely committed it to memory, he put a match to one corner and watched
  it flare away to ashes. Not that he saw any possibility of her getting hold
  of it, but young women who were prepared to dope drink on sight, so to speak,
  wanted watching. And once again he wondered what to expect next.</p>

  <p>The noise of the gate closing made him look out of the window: the girl
  was strolling up the road towards her car. And for a while he watched her
  through narrowed eyes. She walked with a graceful swing which met with his
  entire approval, and the more he thought of the thing, the harder did he find
  it to reconcile her appearance with what had taken place downstairs. In fact,
  he tried to persuade himself that the mirror was distorted and that he had
  made a mistake. Unfortunately the mirror was not distorted, and he knew he
  had not done anything of the sort, but it was a valiant and praiseworthy
  attempt.</p>

  <p>The sound of wheels greeted him as he went downstairs; Mrs. Eskdale was
  descending from the local carrier's cart.</p>

  <p>"Master Hugh," she cried as she saw his clothes, "you're not going
  away?"</p>

  <p>"Afraid I am, my pet," he answered, "but perhaps it will only be for to-
  day. Anyway, I'm leaving the dogs with you."</p>

  <p>She waddled up the path, to pause aghast at the sight of the parlour
  window.</p>

  <p>"An accident, Nannie," he continued, with his arm round her waist, "caused
  by a passing drunk last night, from whom I removed two perfectly good
  Bradburys to repair the damage. And this is a delightful lady whose car has
  broken down, and who has been having breakfast with me."</p>

  <p>The girl had joined them, and the old nurse looked at her suspiciously.
  Delightful ladies in the proximity of her Master Hugh did not fit into her
  scheme of things. But the girl smiled so charmingly that she partly
  relented.</p>

  <p>"It was such a mercy that it happened here: I don't know what I'd have
  done without that cup of tea. And what a sweet cottage you've got."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eskdale relented still more: a sure way to her good graces was
  through her garden or her house. And when, an hour later, Drummond's car drew
  up outside she had quite taken the unexpected visitor to her heart. Moreover,
  the hour had mostly been spent in the cottage. As Drummond unblushingly
  admitted, his knowledge of a car's anatomy was confined to adding petrol
  periodically and oil when he remembered, and a very brief survey of the
  derelict was enough to convince him that the matter was far beyond his
  attainments.</p>

  <p>But not beyond those of the mechanic from Sheringham. Briefly, Drummond
  explained to him what had happened as they walked up the road, and he grunted
  dispassionately.</p>

  <p>"Suddenly conked out, did she? Looks as though she's run out of
  petrol."</p>

  <p>But on that point Drummond was firm; he, personally, with an air of great
  impressiveness, had performed evolutions and had looked in the tank. Shortage
  there, at any rate, was not the cause of the disaster.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;we'll see," said the mechanic, removing his coat and bending
  over the engine. And it was not until half an hour later that the mechanic,
  with a grunt of astonishment, proceeded to scratch his head and gaze at
  something in his hand.</p>

  <p>"You say, sir," he said at length, "that she was going all right and then
  she suddenly stopped?"</p>

  <p>"That's what the lady told me," said Drummond.</p>

  <p>"Most extraordinary thing I've ever known," remarked the man.</p>

  <p>"Can't you find out why she stopped?"</p>

  <p>"I know now why she stopped, sir," said the mechanic. "But what I can't
  make out is how under the sun she ever went. Look here, sir&mdash;this thing
  in my hand is the top of the distributor, the thing what's used in the
  electric circuit."</p>

  <p>"I'll take your word for it," remarked Drummond courteously.</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, in a motor-car everything depends on the contact points being
  clean and dry; otherwise you don't get any connection. Now, if you look at
  these you'll see they're swimming in oil. The whole thing is swimming in oil.
  And what I can't understand is how the oil ever got here."</p>

  <p>"Something must have leaked somewhere." said Drummond vaguely.</p>

  <p>"You couldn't have a sudden leak here, sir; there's no oil pipe anywhere
  near it. Besides, there's no trace of a leak. Now, from what the lady says,
  the car was going all right to start with. Well, if she was firing properly
  this oil couldn't have been here. Stands to reason. Then she stops firing
  because this oil is here. Stands to reason again. But what don't stand to
  reason is how the oil got here. It couldn't have come of itself."</p>

  <p>And with that illuminating phrase light dawned on Drummond. If the oil
  could not have come there by itself, someone must have put it there. That
  sudden faint became clearer. And as he watched the girl playing with the dogs
  outside the cottage a slight smile twitched round his lips.</p>

  <p>"How long will it take you to put it right?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Not very long, sir. I'll just have to take this to pieces and thoroughly
  clean it and dry it."</p>

  <p>Drummond glanced down the road: the girl was coming towards them.</p>

  <p>"Put it back," he said quietly, "and follow my lead. I'll make it worth
  your while. You haven't been able to find out what's the matter. Well, this
  is a black business," he cried as the girl joined them. "Up to date the
  expert has failed."</p>

  <p>"What am I going to do?" she said disconsolately. "Poor old uncle! He'll
  get every handicap wrong, bless his heart."</p>

  <p>"Not on your life," laughed Drummond. "What's the matter with my bus? I
  can easily drop you at your uncle's house on my way to London."</p>

  <p>The girl looked at him doubtfully, whilst the mechanic hurriedly concealed
  a grin. So that was how the land lay.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't think of troubling you," she said. "It's miles out of your
  way."</p>

  <p>"It's nothing of the sort," he answered. "In any case, the day is yet
  young. We will leave this warrior here to delve still deeper into the
  villainies of your machine, and we will push off."</p>

  <p>"Well, if you're quite sure it's not a frightful bother," she said
  gratefully. "It's most awfully good of you."</p>

  <p>"Say no more." Drummond waved a vast hand. "The matter is settled save for
  one trifling detail. Where is he to take the car when he's got it to go? To
  your uncle's house?"</p>

  <p>She hesitated for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Let me think," she said. "I think it would be better if he left it in
  Cambridge. Do you know Cannaby's garage?"</p>

  <p>"I don't, miss, but I can find it."</p>

  <p>"You see," she explained to Drummond, "my uncle has only just gone there,
  and it's difficult to describe where his house is. So leave it at Cannaby's
  garage," she told the mechanic, "and I will ring them up and tell them to pay
  you whatever it comes to."</p>

  <p>He touched his cap.</p>

  <p>"All right, miss. I'll leave her there."</p>

  <p>He watched the two of them as they strolled back to the cottage, and the
  grin was no longer hidden. The exact refinements of the case were beyond his
  ken, but the main basic idea was obvious. And it struck him that the large
  bloke was no bad judge either, an opinion he had no desire to retract when
  Drummond returned alone and gave him a ten-shilling note. To bring the car
  along in an hour or so, and keep his mouth shut at Cannaby's garage were his
  instructions and easy to understand. What was a little harder to follow was
  the meaning of the cryptic telegram he had in his pocket. His orders were to
  send it if the writer had not arrived at the garage by midday.</p>

  <p><i>Darrell. Senior Sports Club, London. Spider, Parlour. Cambridge.
  Hugh.</i></p>

  <p>It did not seem to make sense to him. It was not a racing code, so far as
  he could make out; it had but little to do with love. In fact it defeated
  him. And not the least perplexing part of the matter was that there seemed to
  be no reason to prevent the bloke sending it himself.</p>

     name="chap3">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

  <p class="first">That he was deliberately walking into the parlour and
  playing the part of the fly did not trouble Hugh Drummond in the slightest.
  Too often in the past had he done the same thing for it to worry him. And
  even when the girl asked him to stop in a village so that she could
  ostensibly telephone her uncle to say that she would be late, but in reality
  to warn in about his arrival, he rather welcomed the opportunity for getting
  things straightened out in his mind.</p>

  <p>Her name he had discovered was Venables; and the more he had talked to her
  the more he had wondered at her being mixed up with his visitors of the
  previous evening. So much so that he had once again begun to wonder if his
  eyes had deceived him over the tea-cup incident. Against that however, he had
  to put the matter of the car. If what the mechanic had said was correct, she
  must have deliberately put the oil in herself. She had done it the first
  instant she could after finding out that his over-night guests had made a
  mistake in putting him down as a local product. And as one who was used to
  acting on the spur of the moment himself he could only admire her
  technique.</p>

  <p>Without doubt had he tried the self-starter when he first got to the car
  the engine would have gone perfectly; believing that she had to deal with a
  labourer who knew nothing about motors she would not have troubled to put the
  machine out of commission. And then quite unexpectedly she found out her
  error, and rectified it in a way that showed she was no inexpert driver. But
  with what object? Answer obvious. So that she could dope his tea and again
  search the house for the message. There she had backed a loser, and had taken
  it without turning a hair.</p>

  <p>He lit a cigarette as he sat idly at the wheel; the telephone call was a
  lengthy one. What had been her next move? He recalled her growing anxiety
  over her uncle's tennis party; her apparent impatience to get started. She
  had naturally not suggested it, but was she hoping all along that he would
  take her in his own car? If so it must have seemed to her that he had played
  right into her hands.</p>

  <p>Again, however, came the question: with what object? Why did she want him
  to meet her uncle? And this time the answer was not so obvious. The idea that
  it was anything to do with getting her there quickly because of a tennis
  party he dismissed as absurd. If it was only that, she, having done the
  damage to her own car herself, could very easily and oh! so cleverly have
  discovered it herself. Why then did she want him to go to her uncle's house
  at Cambridge? Could it be possible that certain arrangements were even now
  being made to greet him in a suitable fashion? Could it be possible that such
  an unladylike thing as a rough house was looming in the offing?</p>

  <p>Drummond grinned happily to himself; life seemed astoundingly good. True,
  at the moment, the warfare was blind, but he held one very valuable card. He
  was convinced that the girl had no inkling that he had got her taped. That
  she suspected him was obvious; the mere fact that he had acted the part of a
  yokel the previous night, and had lied about the broken window, was
  sufficient to blot his copy-book.</p>

  <p>"I'm so sorry to have kept you waiting all this time," said the girl when
  she at length appeared. "But my poor old uncle seems terribly worried."</p>

  <p>"That's not so good," answered Drummond. "What's the trouble? Has the
  vicar's wife ratted from the tennis party?"</p>

  <p>But she remained dead serious.</p>

  <p>"Captain Drummond," she said, "I hate to bother you. But would you be an
  absolute dear and take me to Norwich?"</p>

  <p>"Of course," cried Drummond. "Take you anywhere you like, bless your
  heart. And it's very little out of our way. Or do you want me to leave you
  there?"</p>

  <p>"No, no; I've just got to find out something. It won't take me a
  moment."</p>

  <p>"The day is yet young," said Drummond cheerfully. "Take as many moments as
  you like."</p>

  <p>He glanced at her out of the corner of his eye and saw that she was in no
  mood for conversation. She was staring in front of her, and her fingers were
  drumming a tattoo on the arm rest.</p>

  <p>"It's damnable," she burst out once. "Utterly damnable."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure it is," he remarked soothingly. "What's the trouble?"</p>

  <p>But she shook her head.</p>

  <p>"The family skeleton," she said bitterly. "And it's driving my uncle into
  his grave."</p>

  <p>And not another word was spoken until they reached Norwich.</p>

  <p>"Will you wait for me here," she said as the car drew up under the shadow
  of the cathedral. "I'll be as quick as I possibly can."</p>

  <p>"Here you will find me," Drummond assured her, and watched her till she
  was out of sight. The idea of following her had crossed his mind, only to be
  dismissed at once. What significance, if any, was to be attached to this
  unexpected change of route, at the moment was beyond him. But one thing was
  certain. If he was still to retain his one trump he must do nothing to make
  her think he suspected her. And to follow her in the broad light of day, when
  she clearly did not want his company, would be such an outrageous piece of
  bad taste that it would give him away immediately. So there was nothing for
  it but to possess his soul in patience until she returned, and then await
  further developments.</p>

  <p>It was twenty minutes before he saw her coming towards him, and it was
  obvious her mission had not been a success. Without a word she got into the
  car, and he started up the engine.</p>

  <p>"Cambridge?" he asked. "Or is there anything else you have to do
  here?"</p>

  <p>"No, thank you," she said. "I've found out what I wanted to know."</p>

  <p>"I fear the result is not very satisfactory," said Drummond.</p>

  <p>"Satisfactory," she cried. "I don't know how I shall break it to my
  uncle."</p>

  <p>"Look here, Miss Venables," said Drummond quietly. "I don't want to barge
  in, or anything of that sort, but can I be of any assistance? I mean, it's
  clear that something is up."</p>

  <p>For a while she did not answer; then suddenly she seemed to make up her
  mind.</p>

  <p>"Captain Drummond, have you ever heard of <i>Der Schlüsselverein</i>?"</p>

  <p>"The&mdash;whatever you said. Afraid I haven't. What does it mean when
  it's at home?"</p>

  <p>"Actually it means the Key Club."</p>

  <p>"I'm still afraid I haven't," said Drummond. "It sounds pretty
  harmless."</p>

  <p>She gave a short laugh.</p>

  <p>"You may take it from me that the name is the only thing about it that is
  harmless. The Key Club is the most dangerous secret society in Europe to-
  day."</p>

  <p>Drummond negotiated a cow with care.</p>

  <p>"The devil they are," he remarked. "I thought secret societies had gone
  out of fashion some time ago."</p>

  <p>"Then you thought wrong," cried the girl bitterly.</p>

  <p>"Well, well&mdash;one lives and learns. Anyway, what do these birds mean
  in your young life?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing in mine actually," she answered, "but a lot in my uncle's."</p>

  <p>"Is your uncle a foreigner?"</p>

  <p>"Good heavens! no. He's as English as you or I."</p>

  <p>Drummond was thinking hard, though his face expressed polite interest. And
  suddenly it dawned on him that if he still wanted to hold that trump card of
  his he must, after such an opening, allude to his visitors of the previous
  night. To keep silent would be tantamount to admitting that he did not trust
  her.</p>

  <p>"Funny you should talk about foreigners," he said casually. "I had a visit
  from two of them last night. Germans."</p>

  <p>"<i>You</i> had," she cried, and Drummond gave her full marks for
  registering amazement. "What on earth did they want with you?"</p>

  <p>"'Pon my soul, Miss Venables, I don't know. They talked a great deal out
  of their turn, and a gentleman called Emil..."</p>

  <p>"Emil," she gasped. "Was he wearing a ring with a blue stone in it?"</p>

  <p>"That's the cove. Do you know him?"</p>

  <p>"Captain Drummond, he's one of the big men in the Key Club."</p>

  <p>"Is he now? He was throwing his weight about all right last night. Took me
  for a farm labourer, and I did not disillusionise him. He arrived shortly
  after that drunk I told you about had bunged the brick through the window. It
  seemed to interest him quite a lot&mdash;that brick."</p>

  <p>"But I don't understand," she cried. "Why did you let him think you were a
  farm labourer?"</p>

  <p>"Saved bother," answered Drummond casually. "He seemed set on it."</p>

  <p>"I can't get this straight at all," she said. "Why should he worry about a
  brick?"</p>

  <p>"Extraordinary what some people's hobbies are," he remarked. "He seemed
  all hot and bothered about it. Waved a gun in the atmosphere, and frothed at
  the mouth. Of course it may have been a pool of blood in the road outside
  that caused the apoplexy."</p>

  <p>"A pool of blood!" she echoed. "But was somebody hurt?"</p>

  <p>"Presumably. Blood doesn't grow on its own. Though, of course, it may have
  been some animal."</p>

  <p>"Didn't you do anything to find out?" she cried.</p>

  <p>"My dear Miss Venables, the mist was so dense you could hardly see your
  hand in front of your face. Besides, Mr. Emil was occupying my attention. He
  seemed to think I'd got a man concealed about the cottage."</p>

  <p>"You mean he was chasing someone?"</p>

  <p>"That is undoubtedly the impression he gave me."</p>

  <p>"I see," said the girl after a long pause. "Only too clearly,
  unfortunately."</p>

  <p>"I'm delighted to hear it," remarked Drummond. "For I most certainly
  don't. And if you can explain I shall be very grateful."</p>

  <p>"Do you know who it was I went to see in Norwich?" she said, after another
  long pause.</p>

  <p>"Haven't an earthly, bless you. How should I?"</p>

  <p>"The man whose blood was on the road. The man they were chasing."</p>

  <p>"And did you see him?"</p>

  <p>"No. His landlady told me that two foreigners called for him late last
  night, and that he went away with them. They'd found him, and then I suppose
  he somehow escaped from them in the mist. And it was then they came to you.
  Oh! it will break Uncle John's heart."</p>

  <p>Drummond stared at her.</p>

  <p>"What's Uncle John got to do with it?"</p>

  <p>"It was his son; my first cousin Harold."</p>

  <p>Drummond whistled thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Was it, by Jove! And why, if it isn't a rude question, should Mr. Emil
  and Co. be chasing your first cousin Harold?"</p>

  <p>"Captain Drummond," she said suddenly. "I'm going to trust you. Whether
  I'm doing right or not, I don't know, but the whole thing has got on my
  nerves. And now that this has happened, and you have been mixed up in it in
  such an extraordinary way, I feel I just can't stand it any more. Three years
  ago Harold went to Germany..."</p>

  <p>"Just a moment, Miss Venables. What sort of a bloke is Harold?"</p>

  <p>"A nice boy, but weak. His mother died when he was born, and Uncle John,
  though I'm devoted to him, has brought him up very badly. He's spoiled him
  abominably all his life, with the inevitable result that Harold is a waster.
  Well, as I say, he went to Germany three years ago&mdash;his one great gift
  is that he speaks languages perfectly&mdash;and there, in some extraordinary
  way, he got mixed up with that devil Emil and the Key Club. In fact he became
  a member of the society himself."</p>

  <p>"Did he? Seems strange that an Englishman was allowed to join a German
  secret society."</p>

  <p>"So he ought to have realised," she admitted. "But he didn't; until it was
  too late. He looked on the whole thing as a sort of joke, till one fine day
  he discovered his mistake. You'll understand, Captain Drummond, that neither
  my uncle nor I knew about it at the time; we only found it out quite
  recently. And though we noticed he was looking haggard and worried, he
  wouldn't tell us what was the matter. And then one day I got it out of him.
  They were bringing pressure on him to supply them with confidential
  information."</p>

  <p>"Hold hard a minute," cried Drummond. "What confidential information could
  your cousin have access to which would be of any value to them?"</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, Captain Drummond; I'm telling it badly. I forgot to say that
  Harold is in the Foreign Office, and so he frequently has the opportunity of
  seeing important documents."</p>

  <p>"I get you," said Drummond. "Please go on."</p>

  <p>"A fortnight ago it came to a head. I was with my uncle at the time, and
  Harold suddenly arrived one evening in a pitiable condition. And to make
  matters worse he'd been drinking, which, to do him justice, is not a vice of
  his. For a time he was quite incoherent, but at last we got some sort of
  sense out of him. It was terrible, Captain Drummond; terrible. Apparently
  these devils, who had hitherto contented themselves with threatening him by
  letter from Germany, had arrived in this country, and were bringing pressure
  to bear on him in person. There was some document or other they wanted a copy
  of, and unless he got it for them he knew what the result would be."</p>

  <p>"Why didn't he go to the police?"</p>

  <p>"Just what my uncle said to him. And then we heard the ghastly truth; he
  didn't dare to. He had already sent these men certain information which he
  had no business to, though he swore on his Bible oath that it was of no real
  importance. For all that the mere fact that he'd sent anything at all was
  enough to brand him for life. And these brutes knew it, and were bringing the
  screw to bear, over something that really was vital&mdash;something that it
  really was traitorous to give away.</p>

  <p>"He was at his wits' end, Captain Drummond. If he didn't tell them it
  meant death; if he did he felt he would never hold up his head again. And so
  he had taken the only course open to him. Somehow or other he had managed to
  get three weeks leave, and he'd bolted from London. But now arose the
  difficulty. He couldn't stop in my uncle's house, because they could easily
  track him there. So he had to go into hiding. And we decided on the rooms in
  Norwich where I went to-day."</p>

  <p>"But how did you know this had happened last night, Miss Venables?" asked
  Drummond.</p>

  <p>"My uncle told me over the telephone," she said. "You see this tennis
  party has been fixed for weeks, and both my uncle and I agreed it would be
  unwise to postpone it. I've been staying with some friends for a few days,
  and it was when I rang him up to explain why I was late that he told me he
  had 'phoned Harold last night and again this morning, and that the only reply
  he could get was from the landlady to say that Harold's bed had not been
  slept in. The rest you know. Somehow or other they got on his tracks, and
  now..."</p>

  <p>She was rolling her handkerchief into a ball in her hands.</p>

  <p>"Poor old Uncle John! He idolised Harold."</p>

  <p>"I'm very sorry for both of you," said Drummond gravely. "In fact it's the
  devil and all of a business."</p>

  <p>"I suppose I oughtn't to have told you, but somehow or other you look the
  sort of man one can rely on."</p>

  <p>"Deuced kind of you to say so, my dear," cried Drummond genially. "But the
  thing that is worrying my grey matter is why your cousin should have bunged a
  rock through the window."</p>

  <p>"I've been thinking of that, Captain Drummond," she said thoughtfully. "Do
  you think it possible that he wrapped a piece of paper round it: some message
  or other, which he hoped you would get?"</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!" cried Drummond, "that's a darned brainy idea. Now you mention
  it, that's probably why our old friend Emil was so interested in the contents
  of my pockets. And to think I never thought of that!"</p>

  <p>He stole a glance at her: her forehead was puckered in thought. And once
  again he gave her full marks for her acting. How much of the Harold sobstuff
  yarn was true he had no idea: but he had to admit that it was a very
  plausible tale, very plausibly told. Further, that <i>if</i> he had not seen
  what he had seen in the mirror; and <i>if</i> the mechanic had not made his
  illuminating remark about the oil, he would probably have believed it. And if
  he had believed it, there would have been no reason against passing the
  message on to her.</p>

  <p>He was growing more and more intrigued over the whole affair, and
  increasingly anxious to meet Uncle John. The girl by his side was obviously
  English: would her relative prove the same? Was he even her uncle at all? And
  what terms was she really on with the man called Emil? In fact only one
  certainty seemed to him to stand out in the confusion. They had correctly
  surmised what the stone had been used for, but after that they were
  floundering in the dark. Had he received the message, or had he not? And to
  find that out they were obviously prepared to go to considerable lengths.</p>

  <p>He pulled himself together: the girl was speaking again.</p>

  <p>"What's that?" he cried. "See any sign of a piece of paper? Not a trace.
  There was certainly nothing wrapped round the stone when it came into the
  room, so if there was anything there to start with it must have fallen off
  earlier. In which case it might be somewhere in the garden, unless it has
  blown away. Pity you didn't have your brain storm earlier, Miss Venables: we
  could have had a look. For if it comes under Mrs. Eskdale's eagle eye it will
  instantly cease to exist. But in any event I don't see really that it could
  prove of much value. What could your cousin have written which would help
  matters? You've got to remember that so far as he knew the house was occupied
  by a labourer."</p>

  <p>"He might have found out where they were taking him to, Captain Drummond,
  and flung the name as a despairing SOS through the first lighted window he
  saw."</p>

  <p>Drummond gazed at her in admiration.</p>

  <p>"'Pon my soul, Miss Venables," he boomed enthusiastically, "it's a
  pleasure to work with you. Now I should never have thought of that. SOS, by
  Jove! That's the stuff to give the troops."</p>

  <p>"If we're going to save him," she went on, "it's vital we should know
  where they've taken him to as soon as possible. And I know my uncle won't
  want to call in the police."</p>

  <p>"What about sending a wire to Mrs. Eskdale telling her to give the dustbin
  a once over?" said Drummond helpfully. "The old dear will think I've gone
  bughouse, but what matter."</p>

  <p>"It can't do any harm, can it?" cried the girl. "A very good idea, Captain
  Drummond."</p>

  <p>"Splendid. We'll stop at the first post office we come to. Incidentally, I
  suppose she'd better send the answer to your uncle's house. What address
  shall I give her?"</p>

  <p>"Hartley Court is the name of the house. Just Hartley Court, Cambridge, is
  enough."</p>

  <p>"And your uncle's name?"</p>

  <p>"Meredith: he is my mother's brother."</p>

  <p>"Right," cried Drummond. "It shall be attended to. She's a sensible old
  dame, and if she finds the paper and there's anything on it we shall know. Is
  that a post office ahead? It is. I won't be long."</p>

  <p>He pulled up beside the kerb, and leaving the girl sitting in the car he
  went inside. A faint smile was twitching round his lips, and he stood for a
  few moments tapping his teeth with the pencil. Then he suddenly gave a little
  chuckle and seizing a form he began to write quickly. It was a long message,
  and when it was completed he re-read it carefully. It was perfectly clear:
  Mrs. Eskdale could make no mistake. He tore it off the block, removing at the
  same time the two next forms which he rolled into a ball and threw into the
  paper basket.</p>

  <p>"If by any chance," he said to the man behind the counter, "any inquiries
  are made later in the day about this wire by anyone&mdash;it doesn't matter
  who it is&mdash;you'll be careful to say nothing, won't you?"</p>

  <p>"Trust me, sir," said the operator. "The contents of that there telegram
  is a secret. Not even the King of England has the right to ask to see
  it."</p>

  <p>"Quite, quite," cried Drummond soothingly. "But it might be put in such a
  way that it would seem to you that you were doing no harm. But when I tell
  you there's a big bet at stake you'll understand."</p>

  <p>"Think no more about it, sir. I knows my duty, and I does it."</p>

  <p>"The deed is done," said Drummond as he got back into the car. "I've asked
  the old girl to look in the garden for a piece of paper with writing on it,
  and if she finds anything to wire the contents to your uncle. It should be
  through in a couple of hours: there's a post office not far from her
  cottage."</p>

  <p>"Thank you so much," she cried. "It's a shame to give you all this
  trouble."</p>

  <p>"Devil a bit, bless you. But we'd better get a move on, or your uncle will
  pair off the wrong people."</p>

  <p>"He's cancelled the party, so that doesn't matter," she said, "He told me
  so on the telephone: he felt too worried over Harold, so he's put them off.
  For all that I would like to hurry: you see, he doesn't know what we
  know."</p>

  <p>"Of course not," agreed Drummond. "I'll stamp on the juice. I make it that
  we've got about twenty more miles to go to Cambridge itself."</p>

  <p>"The house is about three miles this side," she said: a spot where even at
  that moment an earnest council of war was in progress.</p>

  <p>In an upstairs room stood a grey-haired man of about fifty-five: facing
  him across the table was the German called Emil. And he had only just
  arrived.</p>

  <p>"I don't understand," he was saying harshly. "You say that this farm
  labourer is motoring Doris here."</p>

  <p>"Farm labourer," sneered the other. "Do farm labourers have Rolls Royce
  coupés? He fooled you to the top of his bent, Emil. He's a man called Captain
  Drummond."</p>

  <p>"So," said the German softly. "What was he doing then in that cottage all
  by himself?"</p>

  <p>"He goes there for duck shooting. But a far more important point is why he
  pretended to be a labourer. That's what I can't make out. What was his
  object?"</p>

  <p>The German lit a short and dangerous looking cigar.</p>

  <p>"What was his object?" repeated the grey-haired man. "It looks to me
  definitely as if our friend knew where he was going."</p>

  <p>"In that fog?" The German shook his head. "Not possible, Meredith.
  Besides, he was more dead than alive even then."</p>

  <p>"Then it is a very strange coincidence," cried Meredith. "There
  <i>must</i> have been a message round that stone in view of who it was who
  threw it. He would never have done such a senseless thing as to smash a
  window for fun."</p>

  <p>"Well, I couldn't find it, and from what you say Doris has not succeeded
  either. And don't forget, Meredith, that all that matters is that no one
  should find it. Provided it's lost, we're safe."</p>

  <p>"But is it lost? So long as I thought this man was a labourer I didn't
  mind. Now a totally different complexion is put on things."</p>

  <p>The German shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"We went through his house with a fine tooth comb," he said.</p>

  <p>"What's the good of that?" cried Meredith impatiently. "A message can
  easily be committed to memory."</p>

  <p>"Now look here, Meredith," said the German quietly, "you'd better pull
  yourself together. If what you're getting at is correct, and this man
  Drummond is one of them, why didn't our friend here go up to the cottage? Or
  why didn't he call out for help? It's folly to suppose that he'd have adopted
  the method he did, if he knew who was inside the room. No, no, my dear
  fellow: you're alarming yourself unnecessarily. Knowing that he'd only got a
  short time he took a chance with the first house where he saw the owner was
  still awake. It might have been a genuine labourer: it might have been Jones
  or Smith, but it happened to be this fellow Drummond. Why he should have
  pretended to be a farm hand I can't say: possibly my gun frightened him and
  he thought it was safer."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you're right," said Meredith hopefully. "At any rate we can only
  wait till we see Doris."</p>

  <p>"Which reminds me, Meredith," remarked the German. "There's a question
  I've long been wanting to ask you. What are we going to do with that young
  woman when we've finished?"</p>

  <p>"The same as with the others, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"And you think she'll stand for it? I wonder. I have sometimes thought of
  late that she has become unduly inquisitive."</p>

  <p>He stared at the ash on his cigar.</p>

  <p>"Increasingly desirous, shall we say," continued the German, "of finding
  out what only the Inner Council know. Particularly with regard to the
  whereabouts of our&mdash;how shall I put it&mdash;our head-quarters."</p>

  <p>"Feminine curiosity," said Meredith. "Perfectly natural."</p>

  <p>"It is now my turn to say perhaps you're right," said the German. "Anyway,
  here comes the car. Her wisdom in bringing him here is doubtful, but since
  she has, I, naturally, must not be seen."</p>

  <p>"He is certainly no chicken," remarked Meredith, staring through the
  curtains.</p>

  <p>"He is one of the largest individuals I've ever seen in my life," said the
  German. "Let us hope his brain is not equivalent to his brawn."</p>

  <p>They watched the car drive up to the door and the girl get out. And a few
  moments later she entered the room.</p>

  <p>"Well?" cried both men.</p>

  <p>"He's got no message," she said quietly. "Of that I'm certain. But how on
  earth did you come to make such an idiotic mistake, Herr Veight? I very
  nearly gave the whole show away this morning when I saw him. And I had to
  change my entire plan of campaign on the spot."</p>

  <p>"Was it wise to bring him here?" said Meredith.</p>

  <p>"I had to. First I tried to dope his tea: that failed. Then I had another
  look in the garden whilst he and the mechanic were tinkering with the car up
  the road. But the old woman who owns the cottage was with me and I had to be
  careful. I could see nothing, and so to make perfectly certain I had to
  concoct a scheme. Now listen, Mr. Meredith, because you'll have to go down
  and see him. You're my uncle, and it's your son Harold in the Foreign Office
  who has been abducted by the German gang of <i>Der Schlüsselverein</i>."</p>

  <p>"Great heavens!" cried Emil, "you haven't told him that, have you?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I have. What you don't seem to be able to get into your thick
  head," said the girl angrily, "is that this man is not a farm labourer. He's
  a gentleman even if he is a fool. And do you suppose he's going to keep quiet
  over last night unless something is done about it? The only possible way of
  keeping his mouth shut is to enlist his sympathy. And that's what I've done:
  and this is how I did it."</p>

  <p>"Upon my soul, my dear, I don't think you could have done better on the
  spur of the moment," said Meredith when she had finished. "I'll keep the good
  work going."</p>

  <p>"If there is no answer to his wire we can assume that whatever message
  there was is definitely lost. If there is an answer, well&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She paused significantly.</p>

  <p>"Captain Drummond is certainly entitled to a drink," murmured Meredith,
  and Emil smiled. "And the nature of the drink will depend on the nature of
  the message."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said the girl. "And now come on. He'll think it strange if we
  keep him waiting too long. Don't forget you're the broken-hearted father.
  Incidentally, how much longer have we got to wait?"</p>

  <p>"Three days: four. Certainly a week should do it. He's nearly cracked, so
  I was told this morning."</p>

  <p>"Then for a week at least this man Drummond has got to keep his mouth
  shut."</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't it be far better&mdash;" began Meredith tentatively.</p>

  <p>"No," she said emphatically. "Only as a last resort. He can be traced here
  through Cannaby's garage. Let's go down, dear Uncle John."</p>

  <p>They found Drummond apparently dozing over the wheel.</p>

  <p>"My dear Captain Drummond," said Meredith courteously, "I cannot thank you
  sufficiently for all you have done for my little Doris."</p>

  <p>"Not at all," cried Drummond, getting out of the car and shaking him
  warmly by the hand. "A pleasure, sir: a pleasure."</p>

  <p>"I hear she has told you the whole terrible story."</p>

  <p>"About your poor son, George..."</p>

  <p>"Harold, Captain Drummond," said the girl with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Of course. Stupid of me: I've got a shocking memory for names. Yes, Mr.
  Meredith, your niece has told me, and I can only hope my wire may result in
  something helpful. Though I confess I am not optimistic. There was a bit of a
  breeze this morning, and any loose piece of paper would, I fear, have been
  blown away."</p>

  <p>"Still it is a hope which I cling to. I am an elderly man, Captain
  Drummond, and this affair has shaken me dreadfully: you can understand a
  father's feelings under the circumstances."</p>

  <p>"Only too easily," said Drummond sympathetically.</p>

  <p>"And I was wondering if I might trespass even further on your kindness.
  Are you in a very great hurry to go?"</p>

  <p>"My time is yours, Mr. Meredith. I must be up in London for dinner, but
  until then I am at your disposal."</p>

  <p>"Not so long as that, I assure you," said Meredith with a deprecating
  smile. "But if you would not mind waiting till the answer to your telegram
  comes, it would indeed be a relief to us."</p>

  <p>"Delighted," cried Drummond. "It should not be long now."</p>

  <p>"I gather that my niece has explained to you our difficulty with regard to
  the police, though I cannot believe that Harold has given away anything of
  importance. But even so I would like to keep them out of it. And if, as my
  niece thinks&mdash;and I am inclined to agree with her&mdash;the dear boy
  knew where those devils were taking him to and managed to scribble it down, I
  would so like your advice and help."</p>

  <p>"It's yours for the asking," said Drummond heartily. "And of one thing I
  can assure you. If there is the smallest fragment of paper in her spotless
  garden, Mrs. Eskdale will find it."</p>

  <p>He glanced out of the window.</p>

  <p>"Great Scott! That's pretty quick. Here's a telegraph boy on a bicycle
  coming up the drive. The old lady hasn't wasted any time."</p>

  <p>"Get it, my dear," cried Meredith. "And see what it is. Captain Drummond,"
  he continued, as she left the room, "I'm so nervous I don't know what to
  do."</p>

  <p>"Bite on the old bullet, Mr. Meredith," said Drummond soothingly. "We
  shall know soon. Here comes your niece now."</p>

  <p>The girl came in reading the telegram with a puzzled look on her face.</p>

  <p>"Well, my dear: well?" cried Meredith.</p>

  <p>"It's from Mrs. Eskdale all right," she said. "But it does not seem to
  make sense."</p>

  <p>And for the fraction of a second Drummond's jaw tightened.</p>

  <p>"'Found paper in garden,'" read the girl, "'on it written S B Z ...' Just
  a jumble of letters. They don't make sense. About ten of them. Then signed
  'Eskdale.'"</p>

  <p>Drummond's jaw relaxed, and suddenly the girl gave an excited cry.</p>

  <p>"Uncle John! I've got it. It's Harold's code&mdash;the code he and I used
  to use when we were children. We wrote letters to one another in it. I've got
  it upstairs somewhere."</p>

  <p>She darted out of the room, and Drummond lit a cigarette. Also he glanced
  at Meredith, and having done so suppressed a smile. For Meredith's face was a
  study, and continued as such till the sound of rapid footsteps announced his
  niece's return.</p>

  <p>"I've got it," she cried, waving the form triumphantly. "It <i>is</i> the
  name of a place. How clever of him! Don't you see, Uncle John? Harold saw the
  light in the window and assumed the owner or whoever was there would take the
  message to the police. Then it would have come out in the papers, and though
  no one else would have spotted it, we should."</p>

  <p>"And what is the name of the place, Miss Venables?" asked Drummond with
  interest.</p>

  <p>"Kessingland," she said. "I know I've heard of a place of that name."</p>

  <p>"There is a place called Kessingland a few miles from Lowestoft on the
  coast," said Drummond thoughtfully. "So you think that wire means that your
  cousin has been taken there?"</p>

  <p>"What else can it mean, Captain Drummond? There are probably isolated
  bungalows there and he has been hidden in one of them."</p>

  <p>"My poor boy," said Meredith, passing his hand across his forehead. "What
  shall we do?"</p>

  <p>"Look here," said Drummond after a pause, "can I be of any assistance?
  True, I don't know your son, but I fear we must assume he's been badly hurt.
  Now would you like me to go to Kessingland and make a few careful inquiries?
  I will be most discreet, but it's probably not a very big place and the
  tradesmen or somebody will be sure to know if any foreigners have turned up
  there."</p>

  <p>"But, Captain Drummond, we couldn't think of bothering you. Could we,
  Uncle John?"</p>

  <p>"Of course not. Besides, my dear fellow, you've got to go to London. And
  it may take days."</p>

  <p>"What matter, Mr. Meredith? My dinner party in London can easily be put
  off. And I feel that in a case like this one should sacrifice everything to
  help. It may, as you say, take two or three days&mdash;perhaps more; but that
  is a trifle compared to your son's safety. I will start at once."</p>

  <p>He waved aside their half-hearted protests, and rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"I will keep you posted of anything I find out," he continued. "And all we
  can hope is that I shall not be too late."</p>

  <p>"I wish I could come with you, Captain Drummond," said Meredith, "but I
  fear my health is hardly equal to the strain."</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't hear of it, Mr. Meredith," cried Drummond. "Your place is
  here&mdash;with your niece. I hope that very soon I shall have good news to
  report."</p>

  <p>He pressed the girl's hand gently, and her eyes fell before his.</p>

  <p>"May I do so in person?" he murmured.</p>

  <p>"Of course," she answered. "My uncle and I will be delighted to see you at
  any time."</p>

  <p>"Good-bye, sir." He turned to Meredith. "And don't despair."</p>

  <p>They accompanied him to his car, and as he let in his clutch the girl
  leaned over the side.</p>

  <p>"At any time," she whispered. "I think it is too sweet of you to do this
  for two complete strangers."</p>

  <p>"Strangers?" he said reproachfully. "That's unkind of you, Doris."</p>

  <p>They watched the car till it turned into the main road; then Meredith
  turned to the girl.</p>

  <p>"What the deuce," he spluttered, "is the game? What is this bunk about a
  code?"</p>

  <p>"Don't you realise what this message is?" said the girl quietly as the
  German joined them. "'Found paper in garden. On it written SBZALFTRPTE.
  Eskdale.' Don't you realise it <i>is</i> a code message right enough?"</p>

  <p>"But what?... Why?..." cried Meredith, completely bewildered. "Why
  Kessingland?"</p>

  <p>"Oh! you're dense; you're dense. What did I tell Drummond on the way here?
  That if there was a message it would be the place they were taking Harold to.
  So any town with eleven letters would do, and Kessingland happens to be not
  too near and not too far. It will keep him quiet hunting round the sand
  dunes, whereas if I'd said nothing he would almost certainly have taken this
  up to London. Or else had it repeated from the old woman."</p>

  <p>"Gad! Emil, the girl is quick on the uptake," said Meredith.</p>

  <p>"Extremely," remarked the German, studying the telegram. "I wonder what
  this really does stand for."</p>

  <p>"Not a doubt about it in my mind," said the girl. "It's the address of
  your head-quarters."</p>

  <p>For a moment or two the German stared at her; then he smiled.</p>

  <p>"Well, my dear," he remarked suavely, "if that is so, you've certainly
  done no harm in sending that bovine individual to Kessingland."</p>

  <p>And with the utmost deliberation he tore up the telegram and put the
  pieces in his pocket.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap4"
     name="chap4">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It was at precisely twelve o'clock that Peter Darrell
  entered the lounge of the Royal Hotel, and perceived Drummond with his legs
  stretched out in front of him, and his face buried in a tankard of ale.
  Periodically during the last half-hour the large form of the drinker had been
  shaken with gusts of internal mirth, to the evident alarm of an old lady
  opposite who was knitting some incomprehensible garment. And now, realising
  that a second was approaching, she rose hurriedly and bolted to cover in the
  drawing-room.</p>

  <p>"Come hither, my Peter," boomed Drummond. "Things is 'appening."</p>

  <p>"So I gathered, confound you," cried Darrell. "I was lunching with the
  Marriot filly. Why the dickens aren't you killing ducks?"</p>

  <p>"Draw up, Peter, my boy, and put your nose inside a pint. This is my
  third, and my confidence in myself is even now not restored. There was a
  time," he continued sadly, "when I regarded myself as a pretty ready
  liar&mdash;somewhere round about scratch. This morning, Peter, I have been
  holding converse with a plus two performer."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to say you've brought me down here to tell me that? Who is
  this bloke?"</p>

  <p>"It's a lady, Peter, a beautiful, charming girl with an uncle. And the
  dear child yearned greatly for a message to be sent her by telegram: a
  message doubtless of hope and comfort to cheer her maiden heart. But you look
  bewildered, Peter: let us begin at the beginning."</p>

  <p>He hitched his chair closer to Darrell's, and lit a cigarette. The lounge
  was empty save for the hall porter, and he so far came out of his habitual
  coma as to wonder once or twice what the big man in the corner was talking so
  earnestly about to the owner of the racing car outside. For it was twenty
  minutes later that the owner of the car spoke for the first time.</p>

  <p>"But, damn it, Hugh," he said, "I don't understand about this second
  message. The one they were after, you found in the window. That's clear. What
  is this other one that Mrs. Eskdale found?"</p>

  <p>Drummond grinned.</p>

  <p>"Peter," he remarked, "I have exercised a little story-teller's licence on
  you. Mrs. Eskdale never found a message. When I told you I wired Mrs. Eskdale
  to send a message I did not add that I told her what message to send. And for
  a time I wondered what message I should tell her to send. It had to be
  something mysterious, and yet something that looked genuine.
  Suddenly&mdash;out of the blue, as a gift from the gods&mdash;came the idea.
  A newspaper was lying in the next compartment and I happened to glance at it.
  And my prepaid wire ran as follows:</p>

  <p><i>Wire Meredith Hartley Court Cambridge following message Stop found
  paper in garden on it written SBZALFTRPTE Eskdale.</i>"</p>

  <p>"But what is SBZ and all the rest of it?"</p>

  <p>"Coldspur's cipher nap tip for Lingfield in the <i>Daily Leader</i>," said
  Drummond quietly.</p>

  <p>Darrell stared at him open-mouthed.</p>

  <p>"Then how the deuce has she made Kessingland out of it?" he
  spluttered.</p>

  <p>Once again Drummond grinned.</p>

  <p>"Because, old lad, Miss Doris Venables, as I said at the beginning, is
  definitely rated at plus two and she plays quicker than George Duncan. I take
  off my hat to that wench."</p>

  <p>"More beer," said Darrell decidedly. "This is too obscure for me. I still
  don't see her object."</p>

  <p>"Simple, Peter. To get rid of me. I'm becoming a nuisance: in fact, I
  always have been a nuisance since I appeared in the picture. But it was quick
  of her&mdash;damned quick. Think it over, old boy: look at the matter from
  her point of view. Every single move that the other side has made since Emil
  and his boy friend paid me their visit last night has been directed to one
  end&mdash;to get the message that was wrapped round the brick. And though I
  may not be quite up to her form I flatter myself that I'm sufficiently near
  it to play level. Obviously she believes that I've swallowed her precious
  Harold lock, stock and barrel. And to tell you the truth, Peter, until the
  Kessingland episode I wasn't at all certain that Harold was a myth. Now it's
  plain that he is."</p>

  <p>"I don't exactly see that, old boy."</p>

  <p>Don't be dense, Peter. That's Coldspur's cipher: by no hook or crook can
  you make Kessingland out of it. There ain't such a horse. Therefore all the
  talk about her code with Harold was a lie. Now she thinks that she's got the
  genuine message that they've been hunting for, and so the one urgent thing
  for them to do was to get shot of me. Mark her guile. She believes that I
  think she's got a message from Harold. So she looks up a town with eleven
  letters in it, and if I hadn't suggested going there you can bet your bottom
  dollar she'd have made the suggestion for me. She took care, you see&mdash;in
  the most natural way, I admit&mdash;not to let me see the wire. Otherwise I
  might have wondered why Z and A both stood for S. But as it is she thinks I'm
  taped for Kessingland, and God forbid she should think otherwise!"</p>

  <p>"How are you going to work it?" demanded Darrell.</p>

  <p>"After we've had lunch, Peter, we are going to Kessingland. There, with
  our well-known charm, we will get hold of someone of comparative intelligence
  to whom we will give stamped telegrams&mdash;three or four should be enough.
  We will concoct them later. The first, which can be sent to the lady this
  evening, will merely announce my arrival. To-morrow, in the morning, a hint
  that I am on the track of foreigners; in the evening, still on the track. The
  next day, that the trail has died, but still trying, etc., and so forth. I
  might even go so far as to write a letter to be posted late to-morrow
  evening, which should convince her that little Willie is still safely buried
  in that delectable spot. Then, Peter, having done this, we shall return
  here."</p>

  <p>"And what then?"</p>

  <p>"A closer inspection of Hartley Court by night seems to me to be
  indicated."</p>

  <p>Drummond beckoned a waiter and ordered two Martinis.</p>

  <p>"I can't help feeling, Peter," he continued, "that there are things afoot
  here which are bigger than ordinary common or garden crime."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean political?"</p>

  <p>"That's the notion. I'm inclined to believe that there's something in that
  Key Club business."</p>

  <p>"Mightn't be a bad idea to rope in Ronald Standish," said Darrell
  thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Not at all bad," agreed Drummond. "He'd know, if anybody did. Go and ring
  him up, Peter. Tell him that aught is amiss here in the children's
  kindergarten, and will he kindly report his vile dog's body as soon as
  possible."</p>

  <p>Darrell crossed to the telephone box and Drummond lit a cigarette.
  Definitely a good idea: if his surmise was right, if by a strange freak of
  fate he had blundered into deep waters, there was no one who would pull his
  weight better than Ronald Standish. He knew all the hush-hush men intimately,
  and what was more, they trusted him implicitly. For the more Drummond thought
  things over, the more did he feel convinced that this was going to prove a
  hush-hush job.</p>

  <p>"He'll be down in time for dinner this evening," said Darrell, rejoining
  him.</p>

  <p>"Splendid," cried Drummond. "Let's go and have a spot of food, Peter, and
  then push off. The sooner we lay the Kessingland trail the better."</p>

  <p>And at that delectable East Coast watering-place luck proved to be right
  in. One of the first people they saw was a man they both knew, who was
  staying there for a few days, and who readily agreed to send the wires for
  them.</p>

  <p>"For Heaven's sake, get 'em in the right order, old boy," said Drummond,
  "and don't send 'em all off at once or we are undone. And now, Peter&mdash;to
  horse. I propose to go back via Nannie's cottage to warn the dear old thing
  that I shan't be back for a few days. It's very little out of our way, and
  she'll worry herself sick if I don't turn up.</p>

  <p>"Still there, you see, Peter," he cried as they approached the cottage
  some half-hour later. "There's the trampled-down bit of verge; there's the
  pool of oil. It's dusty now, but you can see the outline clear enough."</p>

  <p>"The poor devil must have bled some," said Darrell.</p>

  <p>"You're right," remarked Drummond gravely. "Gad! Peter, I wish I could get
  to the bottom of this show."</p>

  <p>He drew up outside the cottage.</p>

  <p>"Shan't be a moment," he cried. "The old darling will probably want us to
  stop to tea, but I'll tell her we can't. Nannie," he shouted, opening the
  gate, "where are you?"</p>

  <p>There was no answer, and he walked up the path. His terrier and spaniel
  came bounding to meet him, and he stopped to pat them.</p>

  <p>"Where," he demanded, "is that lazy devil Jerry?"</p>

  <p>And then, on the threshold of the door, he paused, and stood very
  still.</p>

  <p>"Peter," he called softly, "come here."</p>

  <p>Darrell joined him: the reason for Jerry's laziness was clear. For the
  bulldog was lying motionless on the carpet, and it was obvious at a glance
  that he had been shot through the head.</p>

  <p>"By God! old Jerry," muttered Drummond in a voice that shook a little,
  "somebody is going to pay to the uttermost farthing for this. How did it
  happen, boy; how did it happen?"</p>

  <p>His eyes were roving round the room, and suddenly he gave an exclamation
  and stepped to the table. Then he bent down and picked up a pair of leather
  gloves which were lying near.</p>

  <p>"Look at these, Peter," he cried. "See that brown and white stitching
  effect? Can't mistake it. These are the gloves Doris Venables was wearing
  this morning when I motored her to Cambridge."</p>

  <p>"Are you sure, Hugh?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I'm sure. Or they're an identical pair, and that is too amazing
  a coincidence to swallow. What the devil has happened?"</p>

  <p>"She must have been back here."</p>

  <p>"But why, Peter? What did she want to come back for?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps to make certain the wire was genuine," suggested Darrell.</p>

  <p>"But why shoot Jerry?" cried Drummond. "Why, in the name of all that is
  miraculous, shoot the old chap? He made great friends with her this
  morning."</p>

  <p>Darrell made no answer: he was standing by the door listening
  intently.</p>

  <p>"There's someone asleep upstairs, Hugh. I can hear breathing."</p>

  <p>Drummond joined him at the door; there was no doubt about it. Somebody was
  almost snoring in the room above, and they were up the stairs in a flash. And
  there an even more amazing spectacle met their eyes.</p>

  <p>Lying on the bed fully dressed and completely unconscious was the ample
  form of Mrs. Eskdale. Her face was flushed, and every now and then a
  strangled snort convulsed her.</p>

  <p>"If I didn't know her better, Peter," said Drummond after a while, "I'd
  say she was blind drunk. But the old dear never touches a drop of anything
  except an occasional glass of some hell brew of her own. Elderberry wine, or
  something."</p>

  <p>"She's either drunk or drugged, Hugh," said Darrell decidedly. "There's
  not the smallest doubt of that."</p>

  <p>They bent over her, but there was no suspicion of alcohol about her
  breath.</p>

  <p>"That settles it, Peter," said Drummond. "She's been doped."</p>

  <p>He shook her gently by the shoulder, and then not so gently, but it
  produced no result.</p>

  <p>"It may be hours before she awakes," he continued with a frown. "This is
  the devil and all, Peter; I don't like to leave the old lady."</p>

  <p>"It's not that that is worrying me so much," said Darrell. "I'm trying to
  reconstruct the crime as they say. How did she get here? No girl could
  possibly have carried or dragged an unconscious woman of her weight up those
  steep stairs."</p>

  <p>"Therefore," remarked Drummond, "if the girl was alone Mrs. Eskdale must
  have been up here when she was given the dope. No; hold hard a minute. Let's
  suppose she was giving the girl a cup of tea, and that little Doris pulled
  the same stuff on her as she tried to do on me this morning. Then the old
  dear began to feel queer, but still managed to get up here under her own
  steam. How's that?"</p>

  <p>Darrell nodded.</p>

  <p>"It fits. But what about Jerry? If all that happened was that Mrs. Eskdale
  came upstairs more or less normally, why should he get excited? And surely no
  one would shoot a dog just for the fun of the thing."</p>

  <p>"You think the girl was not alone."</p>

  <p>"I don't know what to think, Hugh; the whole thing is baffling. But the
  only solution that seems to fit Jerry having been killed and Mrs. Eskdale
  being up here is that some sort of a rough house took place below. What it
  was about the Lord only knows."</p>

  <p>"She's loyal to the core, is that old dear. It's just possible they wanted
  to see the message itself, and she wouldn't show it to them. And it would
  have been a bit difficult seeing that she hadn't got one to show."</p>

  <p>He broke off abruptly, staring out of the window with narrowed eyes.</p>

  <p>"Do you see that clump of bushes, Peter, one finger left of that stunted
  alder?" he said softly. "There's something just moved in them."</p>

  <p>Darrell picked up the target a hundred and fifty yards away on the other
  side of the road.</p>

  <p>"I'll take your word for it, old boy," he answered. "Your sight is so
  damned uncanny.... No, by Jove! you're right. I saw it myself."</p>

  <p>"It's a man; I can see his face, just to the right of the middle."</p>

  <p>Drummond rubbed his hands gently together.</p>

  <p>"Stay here, Peter; I'm going to stalk that gentleman. And in this flat
  country it'll mean a big <i>détour</i> starting from the back of the cottage.
  But if I can manage to get under cover of that hedge running by the alder,
  I'm home. Show yourself every now and then at the window."</p>

  <p>And then followed for Peter Darrell an interval of pure joy. An ardent
  stalker himself, it was an education to watch Drummond at work. Conditions
  naturally were different, but the principles were the same, and as an object
  lesson in how to make cover where none existed it could not have been beaten.
  He had forgotten Mrs. Eskdale, who still snored placidly on her bed; his
  whole attention was riveted on a blurred white face peering out of the
  undergrowth, and the slinking figure away to the right.</p>

  <p>At last Drummond reached the hedge which was his first objective and
  scrambled through it. Then out of sight of his quarry he straightened up and
  started to run. Nearer and nearer he got, and now he was moving cautiously.
  Ten yards; five yards, and then in a flash it was over. Came a sudden spring;
  a shrill squeal of fear and the next moment Drummond emerged into the open
  field with his prisoner. And his prisoner's gun.</p>

  <p>Darrell met them at the gate, and studied the captive with interest. And
  somewhat to his surprise he saw that he was of a very different type to what
  he had anticipated. The man was well dressed, and on the surface at any rate
  appeared to be a gentleman. He was dark and clean shaven, and his nationality
  was not obvious. But his English when he spoke was perfect.</p>

  <p>"May I ask," he remarked icily, "the reason for this incredible
  outrage?"</p>

  <p>"Get inside," said Drummond curtly. "A pretty weapon this, Peter;
  compressed air. And you will kindly remember, my friend, that any attempt on
  your part to escape would cause it to be used on your right knee. And that's
  a painful wound."</p>

  <p>"I shall have the law on you for this," said the man in a voice that shook
  with rage.</p>

  <p>"By all means," cried Drummond affably. "But just at the moment my friend
  and I are the law."</p>

  <p>The man went slowly up the path, and as he came to the door he paused for
  a second. The sound of Mrs. Eskdale's snores still came rhythmically from
  above, and Darrell watching his face saw a faint look of relief flash for a
  moment across it. Then it became as mask-like as ever.</p>

  <p>"Now, sir," he remarked, "once more I insist on an explanation."</p>

  <p>"Are you the man who did that?" said Drummond quietly, pointing to the
  dead bulldog.</p>

  <p>"I am not," answered the man. "This is the first time I have been in this
  cottage."</p>

  <p>And Jock, his teeth bared, snarled in a corner.</p>

  <p>"You lie," said Drummond softly. "You lie, damn you, and there's the
  proof." He pointed to the terrier. "However for the moment we will leave
  that. Why were you lying up in those bushes watching this house?"</p>

  <p>The man lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"I'll buy it," he remarked with a yawn.</p>

  <p>"I wonder," said Drummond pleasantly, "if you have ever read a book called
  'Stalky and Co.'?"</p>

  <p>The man stared at him in blank surprise.</p>

  <p>"I ask for this reason," continued Drummond. "In that immortal classic
  there is a story which tells of the way Stalky and two low companions of his
  dealt with a pair of bullies at their school. And it is most
  efficacious."</p>

  <p>Once again the man yawned.</p>

  <p>"I suppose your remarks have some point," he said languidly. "But if so I
  fear it has eluded me."</p>

  <p>"Then I will endeavour to make it plainer," said Drummond. "They dealt
  with these bullies in their own coin. They bullied them even worse than the
  bullies had done to their victims. And the result was an unqualified
  success."</p>

  <p>His eyes were boring into the man opposite.</p>

  <p>"Am I getting clearer?" he continued. "At the present moment my friend and
  I represent Stalky and Co.; you represent the bullies. People who shoot my
  dogs, and drug harmless old ladies may be justly regarded as bullies. And
  since you've taken the gloves off I propose to do the same. Ah! would you,
  you swine."</p>

  <p>His arm shot out as the man's hand came out of his pocket, and a knife
  clattered on to the floor.</p>

  <p>"Peter, get me that rubber strap out of the car. And the rope."</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do?" muttered the man, writhing helplessly in
  Drummond's grip.</p>

  <p>"You will see in due course," said Drummond. "It is not a treatment I
  would recommend for the sick and ailing, but that doesn't apply to strong and
  hearty men like you who lie about on wet grass and go big game shooting. Who
  knows&mdash;you might even beat the record."</p>

  <p>"The record," stammered the man. "What record?"</p>

  <p>"Twenty minutes," explained Drummond, "is the longest time known up to
  date that the patient undergoing this treatment has lasted without praying
  for death. Got 'em, Peter? Good. Here's a good stout chair; let's lash him to
  that."</p>

  <p>The man let out a wild shout, and began to struggle desperately, but in
  the hands of two past masters of the art of rough housing he was like a
  child. In half a minute he was trussed up like a fowl, and two scientifically
  arranged handkerchiefs almost prevented his breathing.</p>

  <p>"Now," said Drummond, balancing a piece of rubber belting about eighteen
  inches long in his hand, "before we begin I wish everything to be quite
  clear. What my friend and I are doing now is quite illegal. But as I told you
  before for the time being we have taken the law into our own hands. How long
  we continue to keep it there depends entirely on you. When you have had
  enough, and decide to tell us exactly what happened this afternoon in this
  room, just nod your head."</p>

  <p>The man's eyes, sullen and vindictive, were fixed on Drummond, who had
  raised the strap shoulder high.</p>

  <p>"The essence of this means of persuasion," explained Drummond, "is not to
  hit too hard, and at the same time to leave no part of the area selected
  untouched. In your case I propose to take the right leg from the knee up. So,
  and so, and so."</p>

  <p>Steadily, almost gently the belting rose and fell travelling from the knee
  up to the thigh and then back again.</p>

  <p>"It's been used in the third degree frequently," went on Drummond
  conversationally. "Also in other cases where confession is good for the soul.
  The only time I have actually seen it employed myself was in Australia in a
  mining camp. One of the miners had committed the unforgivable sin of stealing
  another miner's gold. And he'd hidden it. So in order to find out where, they
  tried this method. It succeeded, and then there was no reason to delay
  shooting him any longer."</p>

  <p>The sweat was beginning to pour down the man's face.</p>

  <p>"It's generally about the tenth journey," continued Drummond, "that you
  think your leg is going to burst. About the fifteenth you wish it would, and
  near the twentieth you're sure it has. We've just got to six now, so there's
  still plenty of time to go. And I should like confirmation of those
  figures."</p>

  <p>But the man had had enough; his head was nodding furiously. And at a sign
  from Drummond, Darrell removed the handkerchiefs.</p>

  <p>"So you have decided to speak," said Drummond. "Good. But let me warn you
  of one thing. If I detect you in a lie I'll continue this treatment up to
  thirty."</p>

  <p>"What is it you want to know?" said the man sullenly.</p>

  <p>"What took place here this afternoon. Why has Miss Venables been here? Who
  drugged Mrs. Eskdale? Who shot my bulldog?"</p>

  <p>"I can't answer the first one, and that's straight. A girl was here, and
  her name may have been Venables, but why she was here I don't know. Two of us
  got orders..."</p>

  <p>"Who from?" snapped Drummond.</p>

  <p>The man hesitated, and Drummond half raised the strap.</p>

  <p>"Look here, if I tell you all I know will you promise to let me go?"</p>

  <p>"I won't promise, but I will give it my favourable consideration," said
  Drummond. "I should hate to see more of you than I need. Now, who gave you
  your orders?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know his name; none of us do," said the man. "I've never even
  seen him."</p>

  <p>"How do you get your orders?"</p>

  <p>"Either by telephone, or in a typewritten letter. This time it was by
  telephone."</p>

  <p>"Go on," said Drummond curtly. "What were your orders?"</p>

  <p>"To go to a certain hotel near Cambridge and await further
  instructions."</p>

  <p>"What happened then?"</p>

  <p>"We were joined by a man I'd never seen before, and we got into his car
  and came here. The girl's car was standing outside the door, and the man led
  the way into this room, where she was talking to the old woman upstairs. She
  turned as white as a sheet when she saw him, and clung to the other woman who
  tried to protect her. It was then the bulldog turned nasty and the man shot
  him with that rifle. The girl tried to run away, but the man caught her by
  the gate and brought her back. Then while we held her he gave her an
  injection with a hypodermic syringe in her arm. And the old woman, too. In a
  few seconds they were both unconscious, and we carried one to the car and the
  other upstairs."</p>

  <p>"What a pretty party," said Drummond quietly. "Go on."</p>

  <p>"That's about all," said the man. "My friend drove the girl's car away;
  the man took her at the back of his own. And I was told to lie up in those
  bushes and watch the cottage."</p>

  <p>"With that gun?" remarked Drummond dryly.</p>

  <p>"That had been forgotten, so I took it with me."</p>

  <p>Drummond lit a cigarette and turned to Darrell.</p>

  <p>"What do you make of it, Peter? Do you think this mess is speaking the
  truth?"</p>

  <p>"His story fits, old boy," said Darrell. "But what I would like to know is
  this. Do you usually go round acting blind on the instructions of a man
  you've never seen before, when they entail drugging women and trifles of that
  sort?"</p>

  <p>"My orders were to obey him," answered the man.</p>

  <p>"You mean the orders you received over the telephone from your other boy
  friend," said Drummond. "I should like to hear a little more about him. You
  said none of you knew his name. Am I to understand that there are many bits
  of work like you about the place?"</p>

  <p>"There are several."</p>

  <p>"My God! you shake me to the marrow. Is it a sort of secret society?"</p>

  <p>"We do what we are told," said the man.</p>

  <p>"Charming; charming," remarked Drummond. "You aren't by any chance members
  of the Key Club, are you?"</p>

  <p>The man stared at him blankly.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you are talking about," he said.</p>

  <p>"That's either very good acting, Peter, or it's the truth. And so either
  the Key Club is a further invention of this lovely lady, or we have two
  societies. Aren't we lucky chaps? To return, however, to your own private
  one, my friend. The motives that actuate it are, I take it, entirely
  criminal."</p>

  <p>For the first time a very faint smile flickered round the man's lips.</p>

  <p>"They would hardly stand an appeal to the House of Lords," he said.</p>

  <p>"Excellent. And do you receive adequate remuneration from this man you've
  never seen and who presumably is your Lord High Mukkaduk?"</p>

  <p>"We don't do it for love," remarked the other.</p>

  <p>"You surprise me," said Drummond. "Now there's another question. Could you
  describe the man in whose car you came here, and who drugged the two
  women?"</p>

  <p>"Medium height; dark eyes; rather saturnine face."</p>

  <p>"A description which might fit my visitor of last night, Peter. On the
  other hand it fits numbers of other men. Well&mdash;the mystery increases. If
  it was him it goes to confirm his story to me in the car. However we'll go
  into that later. The first thing to decide is what to do with this
  blighter."</p>

  <p>"For God's sake, gentlemen, don't give me up to the police," cried the man
  earnestly. "I swear that what I've told you is the truth so far as I know it,
  and you half promised you'd let me go if I spoke."</p>

  <p>"And yet the police would be highly edified," said Drummond. "A young army
  of people like you all doing what you're told. And they would let you off
  nice and light if you turned King's Evidence."</p>

  <p>"It isn't what the police would do," answered the man. "If it came out
  that I'd told even you what I have my life wouldn't be worth a moment's
  purchase. But that damned strap would make a deaf mute speak."</p>

  <p>"It is certainly an aid to conversation," agreed Drummond cheerfully.
  "Well&mdash;I'll think about it. You can stop here till I'm sure Mrs Eskdale
  is comfortable, and then we will decide on your immediate future Peter, come
  upstairs with me."</p>

  <p>"Well," he said as they entered the room where the old lady still snored
  peacefully, "what are we going to do with him? My own reaction to the swab is
  that he has been speaking the truth."</p>

  <p>"Same here, Hugh. I don't think anyone could have invented that story on
  the spur of the moment. It accounts for everything that was puzzling me
  before."</p>

  <p>"Except the girl's object in coming over," objected Drummond. "You say to
  confirm the telegram. But what could have made her suspect it in the first
  instance?"</p>

  <p>"We can't positively settle that till Mrs. Eskdale wakes up," said
  Darrell. "And it looks to me as if that wasn't going to be for some
  time."</p>

  <p>"Which raises another small point. What are we going to do with her, poor
  old dear?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing we can do, except cover her up with an eiderdown and leave her to
  sleep it off. Write her a note, Hugh, saying we'll be along to-morrow
  morning, and that until then you don't want her to say anything to
  anybody."</p>

  <p>"Her pulse is normal," said Drummond. "I think she'll be all right
  here."</p>

  <p>"My dear old lad," cried Darrell, "we can't cart an unconscious woman of
  her bulk round the country. If you warn in one of her neighbours to come and
  look after her there's not a single one of her pals who won't believe she's
  not dead drunk. And she'd hate that. Honestly I think she's perfectly safe
  here. She can't be of the smallest importance to the bunch we're up
  against."</p>

  <p>Drummond pulled out his pocket book and began to scribble a note while
  Darrell strolled to the window and looked out.</p>

  <p>"Hullo!" he cried softly. "It would seem that the tall gentleman is in a
  hurry. And he hardly looks like a local resident."</p>

  <p>Drummond joined him, and together they watched a man in a dark suit
  striding rapidly along the road away from the cottage. He was fully a hundred
  yards off, but even at that distance his great height was noticeable. Then he
  disappeared round a corner and the sound of a self-starter came faintly to
  their ears.</p>

  <p>"More motor-cars," said Drummond, pinning the note to the pillow. "They'll
  have to have an A.A. man here soon to regulate the traffic. Well,
  Peter&mdash;let's get on with it. We'll allow this bloke to come with us, and
  we'll drop him somewhere. After all, he's only one of the small fry, and I
  did more or less promise we'd let him go."</p>

  <p>"What about the dogs?"</p>

  <p>"Leave them here. And incidentally that swab below can damn well dig poor
  old Jerry's grave. Go and find a shovel, Peter, and then set him free, while
  I tuck up Nannie."</p>

  <p>And he was just wrapping the eiderdown round her when a wild shout came
  from Darrell.</p>

  <p>"Hugh! For God's sake, come here."</p>

  <p>Drummond dashed downstairs and into the parlour. Lolling forward in the
  chair, and only kept in position by the rope which bound him, was the man.
  And a dagger had been driven up to the hilt in his heart.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap5"
     name="chap5">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

  <p class="first">For a while they stood there too stunned to speak. The thing
  was so utterly unexpected. Not a sound had they heard upstairs, and yet
  during the ten minutes they had been out of the room this unknown man had
  been murdered.</p>

  <p>"Must have been that tall man we saw striding up the road," said Darrell
  at length.</p>

  <p>"Whoever it was he must have struck from behind," remarked Drummond. "This
  fellow would have shouted if he'd seen him."</p>

  <p>He went into the kitchen and looked round. The back door was open; and on
  the stone floor were marks of earth.</p>

  <p>"He must have come over the fields and stood here," continued
  Drummond.</p>

  <p>"Where he heard every word that was said," remarked Darrell.</p>

  <p>"Which confirms the story. There would have been no object in murdering
  that man if he had been lying. At the same time, Peter, there are one or two
  rather rum points about this. The mischief was already done: the beans were
  already spilt. That poor devil could do no more harm, and he certainly wasn't
  going to the police himself. Why then do the one thing which under normal
  circumstances is going to get the whole yarn to the police through us quicker
  than anything else?"</p>

  <p>"Vengeance," suggested Darrell. "The murderer saw his chance and took
  it."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," said Drummond. "But vengeance loses much of its force if the
  victim doesn't know it is coming. And I refuse to believe that any man would
  sit in a chair and let another man stab him without raising Cain."</p>

  <p>"Condign punishment then."</p>

  <p>"Which could be meted out at any time. Why run the appalling risk of
  murdering this man knowing that we were upstairs? Knowing that he might not
  kill instantaneously, and that there might have been a cry which would have
  brought us down? Why take such a chance, unless..."</p>

  <p>"Unless what?"</p>

  <p>"Unless," said Drummond slowly, "the murderer <i>wants</i> us to go to the
  police."</p>

  <p>Darrell stared at him.</p>

  <p>"Wants us to," he echoed. "Why the devil should he want us to?"</p>

  <p>"To force our hands: to find out exactly what we know. It sounds far
  fetched, I know, but if you look into it it's not quite so fanciful as it
  appears at first sight. Supposing this afternoon, either here or at the post
  office down the road they got hold of the actual wire I sent Mrs. Eskdale.
  The instant they read it they realised that I'd been fooling them, didn't
  they?"</p>

  <p>"That's so," agreed Darrell.</p>

  <p>"Step two. If I fooled 'em there, the strong probability is that I fooled
  'em before. In other words I had received the original message. Now if we go
  to the police about this I shall have to tell them the whole story, which
  includes the contents of that original message. And how long do you think it
  will be in a place like this with local constables and hordes of journalists
  before that message is public property?"</p>

  <p>"That's the last thing they're likely to want," objected Darrell.</p>

  <p>"Is it? That's just where you may be wrong, Peter. Having failed to get
  what they really wanted&mdash;namely the message to themselves
  alone&mdash;isn't it possible that the next best thing is to share it? Even
  if they can't prevent A5's message reaching the people it is intended for, at
  any rate they will be wise as to what it is."</p>

  <p>"You think they'd murder a man for that?" said Darrell doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"If they thought the contents of the message were sufficiently
  important&mdash;yes. And judging from their whole line of action they
  <i>do</i> think that."</p>

  <p>"There's something in it," said Darrell. "But what are we going to do, old
  boy? We must report this, or we'll get into the most frightful row."</p>

  <p>"Admittedly, Peter, we must report his death. But is there any necessity
  to report anything else&mdash;anything else, that is to say, that is true? We
  arrived here to find Mrs. Eskdale unconscious, the bulldog dead&mdash;this
  man murdered. The other side will know that is a lie, but they will think we
  are telling it because our own actions when we bound him would hardly bear
  cross examination. In other words that we are frightened of mentioning that
  part. Further, because Joe the postman will certainly do it if I don't, we
  must account for the hole in the window. And, by Gad! Peter, if Coldspur's
  tip for Lingfield has gone wallop, we'll give the blighters another one to
  bite on. There's big stuff on here, old boy, and we've got to take a chance.
  We'll tell the truth in London, but if we tell it down here we're going to be
  detained and the Lord knows what. And what we want to do is to fade away as
  unostentatiously as possible. But if we're going to have a shot at fooling
  these swine again we must do the obvious thing first, and report to the local
  police."</p>

  <p>"What about Mrs. Eskdale?" remarked Darrell.</p>

  <p>"She complicates matters a bit, poor old darling. For now that this has
  happened we certainly can't leave her here. Tell you what, Peter: we'll have
  to get her up to my house in Town. And you must take her and the two dogs.
  We'll wedge her up with cushions in the front of the car, and you can drop me
  at Belmoreton down the road where the nearest police station is. I'll tell
  'em the tale: you go on to London and leave her in charge of Denny. Then come
  back to the Royal at Cambridge."</p>

  <p>Luckily the road was deserted as they carried her down the path, and with
  great difficulty got her into the car. And having removed the note from the
  pillow, and taken one final look round, they left the cottage with its grim
  contents.</p>

  <p>"You'll have the devil of a job to prevent her rolling off the seat,
  Peter," said Drummond, as he got out in Belmoreton. "But if she does she's on
  the floor for keeps, so do your best."</p>

  <p>He stood watching the car till it was out of sight: then he accosted a
  passer-by.</p>

  <p>"Police station," said the man. "Down the street and first on the
  right."</p>

  <p>He found it without difficulty, and with growing amazement the sergeant in
  charge listened to his story. Two constables drifted in and stood gaping: a
  dog fight outside went the full number of rounds unchecked.</p>

  <p>"So there you are, my brave fellow," cried Drummond in conclusion. "Murder
  and sudden death are loose upon your smiling country-side."</p>

  <p>"It's the most amazing story I've ever heard," remarked the sergeant,
  scratching his head. "Have you your car here, sir?"</p>

  <p>"I have not," said Drummond. "My friend has taken Mrs. Eskdale up to
  London in it. So you'll have to raise another."</p>

  <p>The sergeant gave an order to one of the constables, who left the police
  station; and returned five minutes later in a taxi. In some inexplicable way
  the news that something was afoot had filtered round, and a small crowd of
  listeners had collected in the street outside. And the instant Drummond
  appeared a young man, with eagerness shining all over his face, detached
  himself from the others and approached him tendering a card.</p>

  <p style="text-align:center"><small>JOHN SEYMOUR</small><br>
  <small>Eastern News</small></p>

  <p>"I'm a reporter, sir," he whispered excitedly. "Just started. Is there
  anything big on, sir? It will mean a lot to me if I can get in first."</p>

  <p>Drummond regarded him thoughtfully: a pleasant-faced lad quivering with
  keenness.</p>

  <p>"There is something very big on, Mr. Seymour," he said with a smile. "But
  as the matter is now in the sergeant's hands I'm afraid you must ask
  him."</p>

  <p>The boy's face fell.</p>

  <p>"Can't you give me a hint, sir?" he pleaded.</p>

  <p>"Didn't I see you standing by that perfectly good Norton over there?" said
  Drummond.</p>

  <p>"That's mine, sir," cried Seymour.</p>

  <p>"There is your hint," said Drummond. "My knowledge of motor bicycles is
  not profound, but I would hazard a guess that you might be able to keep pace
  with this antiquated box on wheels that we are going to go in. Now,
  sergeant," he added, as that worthy appeared. "Are you ready? Because I want
  to get on as soon as I can."</p>

  <p>It took them about twenty minutes to reach the cottage, and only once
  during the whole drive did Drummond catch a glimpse of the Norton. A point
  which pleased him: evidently John Seymour was not unintelligent. And the
  possibilities of having a tame journalist in his bag had struck him
  immediately.</p>

  <p>The cottage was just as he had left it, and he led the way up the path
  followed by the sergeant and a constable. Then, having flung open the door he
  stood stock still. There lay Jerry as before, but of the man who had been
  stabbed there was no trace. The chair was empty: the man had gone. So had the
  gun and Doris Venables' gloves.</p>

  <p>It was the sergeant who broke the silence.</p>

  <p>"Not much sign of the corpse, sir," he remarked a little
  sarcastically.</p>

  <p>"Very little," agreed Drummond, still looking about the room.</p>

  <p>"And you left the body lashed up in that chair?"</p>

  <p>"I did," said Drummond.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you felt the dead man's pulse?" asked the sergeant mildly.</p>

  <p>Drummond stared at him: so that was his reaction.</p>

  <p>"I did not," he said. "It hardly seemed necessary when he had a dagger
  sticking into his heart. My dear sergeant, do you really imagine that I've
  invented this story?"</p>

  <p>The sergeant lifted his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"No, sir&mdash;not entirely. What I do think is that the man was alive all
  the time and fooled you."</p>

  <p>"In what way was that possible?" demanded Drummond.</p>

  <p>"Well, sir," said the other kindly, "I can think of one way at once.
  Suppose he was just an ordinary sneak thief who came along to see what he
  could steal. You wouldn't believe, sir, the amount of money some of these
  cottage folk keep hidden in their stocking. While he's drugging the old lady,
  the bulldog goes for him: so he shoots it. Then as he's searching the house
  he sees you and your friend arrive, and realises he's caught. So he lashes
  himself up as well as he can, and sticks the dagger sideways through his
  clothes so that it looks as if he was stabbed."</p>

  <p>"A damned ingenious fellow," remarked Drummond enthusiastically. "Though I
  should have thought it would have been simple to do a guy through the back
  door."</p>

  <p>Drummond was thinking hard. Not having done so already, it was impossible
  to tell the sergeant the whole truth, which, of course, put the worthy
  officer's theory out of court.</p>

  <p>"The only other theory is that he was murdered, as you say, and that the
  murderer has since returned and removed the body," continued the sergeant.
  "My objection to that is&mdash;why not have removed it in the first instance?
  Why leave it here at all?"</p>

  <p>"Possibly," suggested Drummond mildly, "he had nothing to remove it
  in."</p>

  <p>The sergeant continued to expound, but Drummond hardly listened. How did
  this new development affect the situation? He <i>knew</i> what had happened:
  he <i>knew</i> the man had been murdered. But was it worth while endeavouring
  to convince the sergeant? Or did it suit his book better to let that officer
  continue to think that he had made a mistake? And the more he thought about
  it, the more did he incline to the latter course. It would save bother and
  prevent any possibility of his being requested to remain at hand in case of
  further developments.</p>

  <p>A shadow fell across the floor: John Seymour was standing by the open
  window.</p>

  <p>"Here's something for your paper, young man," cried the sergeant cheerily.
  "Who killed the bulldog and why? Well, Captain Drummond, I can assure you I
  will not let the matter drop. And should we by any chance catch anyone
  answering to your description of the man we'll get in touch with you for
  identification purposes. Can I give you a lift anywhere?"</p>

  <p>But an idea had been forming in Drummond's mind, and he turned to the
  reporter.</p>

  <p>"Have you got a carrier on your machine?"</p>

  <p>"I have, sir."</p>

  <p>"Then I wonder if you would give me a lift later? I want to bury poor old
  Jerry."</p>

  <p>"Of course; only too delighted," cried Seymour.</p>

  <p>"And possibly," added Drummond, "I might be able to supply you with a
  paragraph for your paper. All about those holes in the window and trifles of
  that sort."</p>

  <p>"Funny you should say that," said the constable, speaking for the first
  time. "Other people seem interested in them 'oles."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" asked Drummond.</p>

  <p>"When I was getting the car, sir," explained the man, "bloke came up to me
  in the garage who seemed to know all about you. Leastwise, he knew you'd been
  here last night, and that a stone had been thrown through your window. 'Funny
  thing to do,' says he. 'Must have had a message wrapped round it.' 'Maybe it
  did, and maybe it didn't,' I answers. 'Anyway, I reckons it ain't no business
  of yours.'"</p>

  <p>"Did he say any more?" demanded the sergeant.</p>

  <p>"He asked me point blank if there was a message," said the constable, "so
  I told him to go to hell."</p>

  <p>"Excellent advice," remarked Drummond. "Well, sergeant, I'm sorry I
  haven't been able to supply you with a corpse. I'll try and do better next
  time. And if you get hold of the blighter I'll come along and give him a
  thick ear."</p>

  <p>"Now, young feller," he said to Seymour when the two policemen had gone,
  "you and I have got to do a job of work."</p>

  <p>"What's that you were saying about a corpse, sir?" cried the reporter,
  open-eyed.</p>

  <p>Drummond laughed.</p>

  <p>"Bad break on my part, wasn't it? If you advertise that you've got a
  corpse about the house it's always advisable to produce it when called on.
  But before we go any farther we'll bury this poor old chap. There are a
  couple of shovels outside."</p>

  <p>It took them half an hour, during which time Seymour earned several medals
  for suppressing his curiosity. But when the ground was finally smoothed over
  he could contain himself no longer.</p>

  <p>"There must be a story here, sir," he cried. "Couldn't you let me have
  it?"</p>

  <p>"Have some beer," said Drummond. "You don't drink! Excellent. Nor do I
  when there is none. Now, Seymour, I've been thinking things over while we
  buried Jerry, and I've come to the conclusion that you may be of considerable
  use to me. Not only that: you may be of considerable use to yourself. In
  other words, if you follow my instructions implicitly I may be able to put
  you in the way of a thundering big scoop."</p>

  <p>The youngster's eyes gleamed.</p>

  <p>"Unless I'm much mistaken, Seymour, there are some very big doings afoot,"
  continued Drummond; "doings which by an extraordinary freak of fate started
  last night when a stone came through the window out of the fog. A message was
  wrapped round the stone&mdash;a message which certain people in this
  neighbourhood are very anxious to get hold of, as you may have gathered from
  what the constable said. That message has been destroyed, but I have it
  memorised in my brain. To keep them quiet, however, this morning I decided to
  fool them. So by methods which I won't go into now I got another message
  through to them&mdash;a false message, which I hoped they would think was the
  real one. Well, whatever they may have thought of it at the time, subsequent
  events have left no doubt in my mind that they know the second message was a
  fake. And so I propose to plant them with a third. Which is where you come
  in, for you are going to do the planting."</p>

  <p>The reporter leaned forward eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Now you've got to get one thing into your head; you will be dealing with
  some very clever and dangerous men&mdash;men whom it is extremely difficult
  to bluff. So the thing must be done in the most natural way possible. And
  this is the way I suggest. Can you get a small paragraph into your paper
  to-night?"</p>

  <p>"If it's worth it, sir&mdash;of course."</p>

  <p>"You must see that the sub-editor does think it's worth it. Head it:
  'Extraordinary Story of Fen Cottage. Message from the Night.' And
  then&mdash;darn it, I can't do journalese. What I want you to imply is that
  this message came, and that you know the contents, but that you're not
  allowed to divulge them as yet."</p>

  <p>"I get you, sir," cried Seymour, scribbling rapidly in a notebook. "How
  does this sound?"</p>

  <p>"'From our special correspondent. Belmoreton.'</p>

  <p>"Your headings are good&mdash;then...</p>

  <p>"'I have just heard a most mysterious story from Captain Drummond of
  London, who has been staying in a small cottage near here...'</p>

  <p>"Why were you staying here, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Duck shooting," said Drummond briefly.</p>

  <p>"'For the duck shooting. The night before last, during a period of dense
  fog, a large stone was flung through his window, with a piece of paper
  wrapped round it. On the paper was written a message. The fog was so thick
  that Captain Drummond was unable to find the man who did it. At first he
  thought it must be a practical joke, but yesterday afternoon, on returning to
  the cottage, he found his favourite bulldog shot dead on the floor. He at
  once got into touch with the police, who are investigating the matter. At
  present I am not at liberty to disclose the nature of the message.'</p>

  <p>"How's that, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Excellent," said Drummond. "Now we come to the next and more important
  point. And here I've got to rely entirely on you. Within an hour of that
  appearing&mdash;or I'll eat my hat&mdash;you will be got into touch with by
  ingratiating gentlemen who will treat you as their long-lost brother. And
  then, young feller, it's up to you. You've got to divulge the contents of
  that message, so that they really believe you're speaking the truth. Register
  outraged indignation to start with at the bare thought of passing it on; then
  weaken gradually and sting 'em for a pony at least. And, above all, don't let
  'em think I told you: pretend you heard it from the police. Get me?"</p>

  <p>"You bet I do," cried Seymour. "And what is the message?"</p>

  <p>"'Rosemary. BJCDOR,'" said Drummond. "That will do as well as
  anything."</p>

  <p>"And what was the real one?"</p>

  <p>"That, perchance, in due course you shall know. But not at present. It
  isn't that I don't trust you, Seymour, but in a case of this sort the fewer
  people there are in the secret the better."</p>

  <p>"And where am I to get in touch with you again?"</p>

  <p>"The Senior Sports Club, St. James's Square, will always find me," said
  Drummond. "Drop me a line there if anything happens. And now get me to
  Norwich as quick as you can. I'll hire a car there to take me to
  Cambridge."</p>

  <p>"Aren't you going back to London, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Not till to-morrow. So if anything happens before lunch, get on to the
  telephone to me at the Royal. Or, better still, come over on your bike and
  see me personally."</p>

  <p>He took a last look round the room; then, having closed the front door, he
  walked down to the gate. The road was apparently deserted, but for a long
  time he stood under cover of the bushes, peering up and down it, while
  Seymour stared at him in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Never forget, young feller," said Drummond, "that there are games in this
  world where one mistake is one too many. And this particular game comes into
  the category. We go to the right, don't we, to get to Norwich? But before we
  finally decide we'll just try a little experiment. If we get the gate open,
  can you start the bike on the path here?"</p>

  <p>"I can," said Seymour.</p>

  <p>"I have a hunch," continued Drummond, "that in a moment or two we are
  going to have some fun. Hold the gate, and I'll get the bike in."</p>

  <p>He was out in the road, and back with the bike in something under a couple
  of seconds, and Seymour gazed at him open-mouthed. For Drummond was smiling
  grimly, and in his eyes was a queer look of excitement.</p>

  <p>"As I thought, Seymour. Was it my sudden appearance that frightened those
  birds in that small tree down the road there, or was it someone who moved on
  the ground underneath them? Moved when he saw me. Now, look here, my lad, are
  you game to take a risk?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I am. But what sort of risk?"</p>

  <p>"The risk of being shot. Because, unless I am much mistaken, you will
  shortly have what is generally alluded to in all romantic literature as your
  baptism of fire."</p>

  <p>"I'm on, sir. What am I to do?"</p>

  <p>"Stout feller. Start your engine, and when I'm up behind you, go out
  through the gate and turn <i>left</i>. Then swerve. Keep on swerving from one
  side of the road to the other till we are round the bend. Then go all out.
  Ready? Let her rip!"</p>

  <p>The bicycle shot into the road, with the two men up on it.</p>

  <p>"Swerve!" shouted Drummond as something spat through the air close to
  their heads. "And again."</p>

  <p>Phit! Phit! Two more bullets pinged past them, and then they were round
  the bend.</p>

  <p>"Now all out," said Drummond quietly. "Well done, boy, well done. There
  aren't many fellows of your age who can say they've been under fire."</p>

  <p>"But this is grand," cried the youngster as the bike touched sixty miles
  an hour. "What next?"</p>

  <p>"See that barn in front of us? Turn in there. We'll wait and see."</p>

  <p>The Norton slowed down, shot through an open gate and into an empty
  barn.</p>

  <p>"Quick!" cried Drummond. "Out of sight, and stop the engine."</p>

  <p>And the instant he had done so they both heard away in the distance the
  roar of a racing engine. It was rapidly coming nearer, and through a chink in
  the wall they both peered out. Rocking from side to side like a thing
  possessed, a long, low, black car hurtled past the barn. The driver was
  crouching over the wheel, and the man behind him seemed to be urging him on
  to even greater speed.</p>

  <p>"Just as well we pulled in," said Drummond calmly. "They've got the legs
  of us. Now back the way we've come, and stamp on her again, Seymour."</p>

  <p>And twenty minutes later Drummond found himself in Norwich for the second
  time that day.</p>

  <p>"Cheery little bunch, aren't they?" he said with a grin. "It's lucky for
  us I had that hunch at the cottage. Otherwise I'm afraid there would have
  been a little advertisement in the paper: For Sale. 1933 Norton. Property of
  the late Mr. John Seymour."</p>

  <p>"How dared they do it, sir? It would have been murder on the high
  road."</p>

  <p>Drummond laughed.</p>

  <p>"You'll see quite a lot of that before you've finished this trip," he
  answered. "But don't forget: no mention of what's happened in the paper."</p>

  <p>When suddenly Seymour gripped his arm.</p>

  <p>"Look, sir, look!" he stuttered; "there's the car itself!"</p>

  <p>Drummond glanced across the square: there was no mistaking that long black
  body. The two occupants were just getting out, and he noted that the one who
  had sat beside the driver was immensely tall, even as the man Peter and he
  had watched striding away from the cottage had been. And at that moment an
  impulse that could not be resisted overcame him. Straight across the square
  toward them he sauntered, and they met in the middle. And meeting, stopped
  dead in their tracks while a man may count thirty. Then Drummond spoke.</p>

  <p>"You exceedingly damnable swine," he drawled. "Unless you'd proved it to
  me I wouldn't have believed it possible that anyone could be such an
  incredibly lousy shot. Do you want a stationary hayrick at five yards?"</p>

  <p>Not a muscle moved in the tall man's face; for all the effect it produced
  the remark might never have been made. He just stared fixedly at Drummond
  with a thoughtful look in his eyes, whilst past them drifted the sleepy
  afternoon traffic. Then, still in absolute silence, he signed to his
  companion and the two of them continued on their way.</p>

  <p>Drummond watched them till they were out of sight, then he lit a
  cigarette. And being perfectly fair with himself he had to admit that that
  round was the tall man's. Though absolutely without nerves himself, there was
  something far more ominous in that complete silence than in any threats he
  might have used. And since he never made the fatal error of underrating an
  opponent, it was in a somewhat contemplative mood that he rejoined
  Seymour.</p>

  <p>"What did he say, sir?" cried the youngster eagerly.</p>

  <p>"He didn't," said Drummond shortly. "I rather wish he had. And you can
  take it from me, young feller, that it's going to be a case of watching your
  step from now on. There's a phrase about sticking at nothing, which is
  generally more metaphorical than literal. In his case it isn't."</p>

  <p>His eyes strayed across the square to the big black car, and he grinned
  faintly.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" he murmured. "Why indeed not? I must now get a taxi&mdash;or
  its equivalent. Follow me in a few minutes towards Cambridge. But wait a bit
  and see if anything happens."</p>

  <p>With fascinated eyes the young reporter followed Drummond as he leisurely
  crossed the square. Saw him approach the black car and glance round. Heard
  the sudden roar of the engine instantly throttled down. And then, to his
  unspeakable and unholy joy, watched it disappear round the corner.</p>

  <p>"Golly! what a nerve!" he muttered ecstatically to himself. "What gorgeous
  brass! And here, as I live, is the ruddy shover."</p>

  <p>The man crossed the square to where he had left the car, and then stared
  about him bewildered. Until what had happened dawned on him, and he retraced
  his steps at a run. The tall man had just appeared and the two met not twenty
  yards from where he was standing. Cautiously he edged closer, only to halt
  abruptly at the sight of the tall man's face. For it was set like a frozen
  mask, but through that mask there gleamed such concentrated rage that it was
  as if the devil himself stood there. Then the look vanished, but the
  youngster was still standing motionless five minutes after the two men had
  disappeared. It seemed to him that he had seen the naked essence of evil.</p>

  <p>After a while he pulled himself together and started his engine. He knew
  the road to Cambridge by heart, and his brain was full of other things as he
  rode along. What an amazing adventure he had blundered into! Sheer luck, too,
  that he had happened to be in Belmoreton that afternoon. What a glorious
  scoop it was going to be! And he had just visualised himself choosing which
  offer from countless London editors he would graciously accept when he saw
  Drummond standing in the road ahead, and pulled up.</p>

  <p>"Had they found out when you left?" asked Drummond.</p>

  <p>"They had. And I've never seen such rage incarnate on a man's face."</p>

  <p>"I don't expect he was pleased," said Drummond happily. "And he'll be even
  less so when he finds the car."</p>

  <p>"Where is it, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Just in there. On top of a nice little disused chalk pit. When we've
  finished it will be at the bottom. Ever seen such a car go over a cliff,
  Seymour? You haven't? Nor have I. I think it ought to be great fun."</p>

  <p>"Won't there be an awful stink about it?"</p>

  <p>"I think not," answered Drummond. "You see, as I view the matter, Mr.
  Longshanks is hardly in a position to raise even the smallest aroma, let
  alone a stink. And so we are quite safe in making his shoot this afternoon as
  expensive as we can. I admit that it rather goes to my heart to smash up such
  a perfectly glorious bus, but in this weary world one can't have
  everything."</p>

  <p>He switched on the engine as he spoke.</p>

  <p>"I'll keep the clutch out with my hand," he continued, "and you get in and
  put her in bottom. Then pop out and we'll let her go."</p>

  <p>The car was standing two yards from the top of the quarry, with a few
  small bushes between it and the edge. It shot forward, seemed to hang in
  space for one dizzy instant, and then with a dreadful rending noise it
  crashed downwards out of sight. Came a last coughing grunt from the engine,
  then silence.</p>

  <p>"That will give some of your fraternity a chance to do a bit of Sherlock
  Holmes work," said Drummond as they walked back. "Though it may be some days
  before it is discovered; you can't see it from the road as you go past."</p>

  <p>"Shall I take you to Cambridge now?" said Seymour.</p>

  <p>"You shall not," remarked Drummond with a grin. "Your girl friends must be
  a deuced sight more adequately protected than I am if they can stand that
  carrier of yours. I've still got partial paralysis of the spine. Run me to
  Thetford and I'll get a car there."</p>

  <p>And it was just on eight o'clock when Drummond, with the pleasurable
  feeling of something accomplished, something done, paid off his driver and
  once again entered the hospitable doors of the Royal to find Peter Darrell
  and Ronald Standish waiting for him.</p>

  <p>"Splendid, old boy," he cried to the latter. "Delighted you could
  come."</p>

  <p>"I brought him along," said Darrell. "I've already told him the main
  points."</p>

  <p>"He has indeed," remarked Standish gravely. "You've bought it this time,
  Hugh, with a vengeance."</p>

  <p>"Do you know anything about these blokes?" asked Drummond eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Enough to assure you that your chances&mdash;and Peter's, too&mdash;of
  celebrating your next birthday were a hundred per cent. better this time
  yesterday than they are at the present moment."</p>

  <p>"Don't 'e talk lovely, Peter?" laughed Drummond. "As a matter of fact," he
  continued seriously, "I realised we were up against a pretty tough lot. You
  remember that good-looking, tall man we saw in the road walking away from the
  cottage?"</p>

  <p>"The fellow who stabbed our bird?"</p>

  <p>"That's the gentleman. He's let drive at me three times already with, I
  should imagine, the actual gun we got hold of. Listen, boys&mdash;for I'm
  telling you."</p>

  <p>"Mad," grinned Standish when he had finished. "Mad as a ruddy hatter."</p>

  <p>"Can you place him, Ronald?"</p>

  <p>"Not at present. Six feet six, you say?"</p>

  <p>"At least. And with a pretty powerful punch I guess if he knows how to put
  'em up."</p>

  <p>"And you pinched his car and dropped it over a precipice. Gorgeous. Maybe
  a trifle crude, but nevertheless definitely creditable."</p>

  <p>"But look here, Ronald, if you don't know the bird, why so morose over
  Peter's and my next birthday cake?"</p>

  <p>"Because I do know the Key Club," said Standish quietly. "Or, at any rate,
  of them."</p>

  <p>"Splendid," said Drummond. "Let us gargle together, and then you have our
  ear."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap6"
     name="chap6">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Ronald Standish glanced round the lounge, then he led the
  way into a small alcove.</p>

  <p>"Not," as he explained, "that I think anyone here is likely to be
  interested in our conversation, but I want to keep you two fellows out of
  sight as much as possible. I don't matter&mdash;yet; but you are known.</p>

  <p>"The Key Club started a few years after the War in Central Europe. The
  members used to wear a tiny key as a badge in the lapels of their coats,
  which was supposed to signify the unlocking of the door leading to a more
  satisfactory world. Things were in a shocking state, especially in Germany
  and Russia, and quite a number of similar societies sprang up, flourished for
  a time, and then they died painlessly of their own utter futility. For some
  reason or other, however, the Key Club survived. Branches began to appear in
  France, and finally in England, and it became, in fact, an international
  organisation. Members were pledged amongst other things to abolish war, and
  so long as it remained at that nobody cared. They talked the hell of a lot
  and there it ended.</p>

  <p>"And then about four years ago there occurred a very startling
  development. At the time I was on a special job which entailed me being for
  the greater part of the day at the War Office. And one morning a
  peculiar-looking bird rolled up and asked to see someone to whom he could
  impart information. He hadn't any appointment; he didn't seem to know anyone
  by name, and so one of the messengers decided to send him to me. He got
  through on the 'phone and I told him to send the man up. All sorts of crazy
  blokes come along with useless schemes, and I was prepared for him to be one
  of them. And when I saw that little key in his buttonhole I was certain of
  it. To my amazement, however, he produced from his pocket the formula of a
  new high explosive which he told me had just been perfected by the French.
  Now, we happened to know that the French had been experimenting on those
  lines, and therefore the information, if true, was of value. But since, so
  far as I was concerned, it might have been the formula for a new baby food, I
  passed the word along for an expert to come and vet it. And his report was
  that, though he could not possibly say what value there was in it without
  practical experiment, it undoubtedly was an explosive of sorts.</p>

  <p>"'How did you get this?' I asked my visitor.</p>

  <p>"'That," he answered, 'is nothing to do with you. There it is, and good
  day to you.'</p>

  <p>"I stared at him open-mouthed.</p>

  <p>"'But look here,' I cried, 'don't you want any payment for it? We shall
  have to make a few inquiries first, of course.'</p>

  <p>Make any inquiries you like,' he said. 'The thing is yours.'</p>

  <p>"And he stalked out of the office, leaving the chemical wallah and me
  gaping at one another. Birds with worthless stuff to sell I had met, but a
  man with valuable information to give was a bit of an eye-opener. And when we
  discovered that it undoubtedly was the genuine formula of this explosive our
  amazement increased. The man had vanished, and I'd been too thunderstruck at
  the time to have him followed. I'd got his card but there was no address on
  it, and at that the matter rested for a few weeks, when the next
  extraordinary development took place.</p>

  <p>"Through devious channels we discovered that Germany, Italy, Japan,
  America&mdash;in fact every Power that counted&mdash;had been presented with
  the same formula, free, gratis and for nothing. Which, as you can imagine,
  caused a positive riot of joy amongst the French military authorities.</p>

  <p>"However, that was their funeral; what was intriguing us was the reason
  for such an apparently pointless thing. That the secret must have been
  obtained by bribing some Frenchman was obvious, but why <i>give</i> it away?
  More than that, why give it to everybody? And at last we were forced to the
  conclusion that the motive underlying it was a sort of perverted idealism.
  These people realised it was impossible to stop research work: that first one
  country and then another would be bound to get hold of something which would
  place that country temporarily at an advantage. Their notion, therefore, was
  that if they could find out what that something was each time and pass it on
  to everybody else, the temporary advantage would be gone and we'd all start
  level again. Crazy&mdash;if you like&mdash;and yet there, staring us in the
  face, was the actual proof of the pudding. The composition of the new French
  high explosive was public property.</p>

  <p>"Now, all this is, of course, stale news. But I think it's rather
  important that you should get hold of things from the beginning. And so we've
  got to the point where the members of this club ceased being a harmless
  hot-air factory and began to act. Still more or less harmless, it is true:
  since everybody was put wise, nobody gained. But a new agency had definitely
  arisen, though no action could be taken against it: it had done nothing wrong
  or criminal. So the powers that be held a watching brief and waited.</p>

  <p>"For two years nothing more happened. Reports came in from time to time
  showing that the members were still holding meetings, but at that it
  remained. And then one day&mdash;I don't know if you remember the case in the
  papers&mdash;a man was found dead in his bunk in the Harwich-Hook of Holland
  boat. At the first glance it looked as if death was due to natural causes,
  but when the steward turned him over he saw to his horror that a dagger had
  been driven up to the hilt in his heart. It was a tiny weapon, but quite
  large enough to kill him."</p>

  <p>"Are we getting a line here, I wonder?" said Drummond thoughtfully. "It
  was quite a small one this afternoon."</p>

  <p>"Quite possibly," said Standish. "To resume, however. The strange thing
  about the man on board was that there was literally nothing by which to
  identify him. There were no letters in his pockets; his passport had
  disappeared. His clothes and underwear were not marked, and beyond the fact
  that his overcoat and hat had both been bought at Harrods there was no
  indication whatever as to who he was, or even as to his nationality. He
  looked English, but that was about all that could be said for it.</p>

  <p>"Naturally there was the devil of a commotion when the boat reached
  Harwich. The murderer was on board, but it was manifestly impossible to
  detain over three hundred people. And so, after the police had taken every
  passenger's name and address, the boat train proceeded to London, and the
  stewards and everyone else on board were put through the hoop.</p>

  <p>"The results were meagre. The cabin steward stated that the man spoke
  English, but was not prepared to say whether he was an Englishman or not. He
  also stated that he was carrying with him an attaché case. Of this he was
  positive; he had seen it lying on the bunk whilst the man had been out of the
  cabin just after leaving the Hook. To the best of his belief the man had
  turned in about half an hour after they sailed, but he couldn't swear to it.
  And more than that he couldn't say.</p>

  <p>"The bar-room attendant was the next man to be questioned. He said that
  the man had ordered a whisky and soda and some ham sandwiches before the boat
  started, and that he had remained in the bar for about twenty minutes. He had
  not actually seen anyone speak to him, but that did not of necessity mean
  that no one had, as several men had been in the bar at the time and he was
  busy serving them. He, too, was not prepared to say if the man was English,
  though he rather thought it.</p>

  <p>"And then a rather significant fact came to light. About a quarter of an
  hour after they had sailed, and so presumably after he'd finished his
  sandwiches, the man had gone to the lavatory to wash his hands. The boy in
  charge was certain of that fact because he had stood beside him holding a
  towel in readiness. And while he was standing there, and the man was leaning
  forward over the basin, the boy noticed that a small key was fixed to the
  back of the lapel of his coat. That key was not found on the dead man.</p>

  <p>"At the time the local police attached no importance to it: they had never
  heard of the Key Club. And it wasn't until the information reached head-
  quarters that its significance was realised. The boy was questioned over
  again and stuck to it, and since it wasn't the sort of thing anyone would be
  likely to invent it was accepted as a fact. The man had been a member of the
  Key Club.</p>

  <p>"The point, however, that occupied us was whether there was any special
  significance in this; did it give a clue to the motive for the murder?
  Robbery was ruled out&mdash;the man's money was intact. If it was revenge, or
  if a woman was at the bottom of it, would the murderer have bothered to
  remove the key? But if there was a connection between the crime and the badge
  it was obvious that he would take it off. It was by the merest chance that
  the key had been seen at all; and but for the boy in the lavatory no one
  could have known anything about it. Had the dead man, therefore, been guilty
  of treachery or something of that sort, for which death was the penalty? The
  trouble was that from what we knew of the Club up to date, it was not an
  institution that patronised murder. It was almost as baffling as if it had
  been the Salvation Army involved.</p>

  <p>"In due course the man was buried, still without any clue to his identity.
  And since the affair had considerable publicity in the English Press, it
  seemed probable that the man was not an Englishman. A full description of him
  had been given, and it was almost incredible that he should have no kith or
  kin. And then one day about a week after came the next development. An
  extraordinary letter was received at Scotland Yard, which the authorities at
  first believed to be a hoax."</p>

  <p>Standish took out his pocket-book.</p>

  <p>"I made a copy of it at the time, and after I'd seen Peter this afternoon
  I looked it out. Here it is."</p>

  <p>He passed a sheet of paper over to Drummond.</p>

  <p><i>With reference to the recent murder in the Harwich boat, why was Mario
  Giuseppi stabbed at the corner of the Strada Marino in Genoa two days before
  it happened? What was in the lost attaché case? The Key Club still maintains
  its ideals, but there is treachery at the top.</i></p>

  <p>"There was no signature," continued Standish, "and the postmark was
  Kensington. The handwriting was an educated one; the paper was the ordinary
  stuff you can buy anywhere in a penny packet. So the police, not thinking
  anything would come of it, got into touch with Genoa, and somewhat to their
  surprise found that a man named Mario Giuseppi had been stabbed at the corner
  of the Strada Marino two days before the murder in the boat. And further
  inquiries elicited the very important fact that Giuseppi was a skilled
  draughtsman in the employ of the Italian Navy who had been working on some
  extremely confidential drawings with regard to their latest submarine.</p>

  <p>"Things were moving, though they were still pretty dark. Had the man who
  was murdered in the boat bought copies of these plans from Giuseppi, and the
  transaction been discovered? Had Giuseppi been killed as a punishment for
  being a traitor to Italy, and the man in the boat been murdered in order to
  get the tracings back? It seemed possible, and the list of passengers was
  scrutinised. There was no Italian in it, though that, of course, didn't prove
  anything.</p>

  <p>"So the Yard advertised and broadcasted for the anonymous writer of the
  letter. They were discreet in what they said, though naturally it was
  necessary to be explicit enough for the man to know whom the advertisement
  was intended for. And that, I fear, is what did it. The morning after the
  broadcast a man was found with his neck broken, lying in some bushes in the
  small garden of a house in Kensington. It transpired that he occupied the
  fourth story of the house, which was let as rooms, and that the preceding
  night he had had visitors who had stayed late. So much the lodger underneath
  him could say, as the visitors were still talking when he had gone to
  bed.</p>

  <p>"The extraordinary thing was that no one seemed to have seen these
  visitors. The landlady had not, but she had been occupied in the basement.
  And, since no one could get in without a latch-key, it seemed clear that the
  dead man, whose name was Johnstone, had brought them in himself. Apparently
  he was a quiet sort of bloke, who went out very little, and his main hobby
  was reading. And at first the sergeant who was called thought it might have
  been an accident, until an examination of certain marks near the window
  convinced him that there had been a struggle. The lodger below had heard
  nothing, but he was a sound sleeper and his bedroom was at the back. At any
  rate, the sergeant 'phoned the Yard, and Inspector McIver went down. And the
  first thing he noticed was that a specimen of the dead man's handwriting on
  his desk corresponded with the writing in the letter.</p>

  <p>"Now they thought they really had something to follow up, but once again
  they were disappointed. The only relatives they could run to earth were two
  elderly female cousins who lived down in the West Country and hadn't seen the
  dead man for ten years, and an uncle who lived up North and hadn't seen him
  for fifteen. Nor did he seem to possess any friends; at least nobody
  volunteered to come forward. There was nothing to help them in his
  correspondence, and the discovery of the familiar small key in a drawer only
  confirmed what they already knew from his letter.</p>

  <p>"In fact&mdash;an <i>impasse</i>, and the Yard authorities were annoyed.
  They dislike unsolved murders, and here were two in the course of a few days.
  That there was a connecting link between them and the death of the Italian in
  Genoa was obvious: that that link was the selling of secret information with
  regard to the new submarine was likely. But beyond that stood a blank wall,
  from which there emerged during the next few weeks only one further bit of
  evidence. It transpired that Giuseppi had been seen during the week before
  his death in the company of two men both of whom had a key suspended to their
  watch-chains. This information came from the proprietor of the small
  restaurant where the draughtsman used to have his lunch, but he could give no
  description of them that would not have fitted a hundred middle-class
  Italians.</p>

  <p>"And so for the time the matter rested. The official theory was that
  Giuseppi had sold information to the Key Club; had been discovered and
  murdered. That the emissary of the Key Club had in his turn been murdered in
  order to obtain that information. And that finally the man Johnstone had been
  done to death too, to prevent him passing on what he knew to the police. But
  as to whether the same criminal or bunch of criminals were responsible for
  all three, or what had happened to the tracings there was no means of
  telling. Certainly no offer was made of them to the British Government as had
  been the case before with the French high explosive.</p>

  <p>"Six months elapsed before anything more was heard. And then a very
  remarkable fact came to our knowledge, which though it bore out in part the
  police theory, also put the activities of the Key Club in a somewhat
  different light. You may remember that the time before they had <i>given</i>
  the secret to <i>all</i> countries; this time they had sold it to one.
  Through devious channels we found that the French had bought for a large sum
  of money the actual submarine details on which Giuseppi had been working at
  the time of his death. Abstract idealism had been replaced by concrete
  realism."</p>

  <p>"There was damned little idealism about my bloke this afternoon," said
  Drummond with a grin.</p>

  <p>"Just so," continued Standish. "I'm getting to that now. When this last
  bit of information came to light we began making some pretty searching
  inquiries. It was all done on the quiet, naturally: there was nothing
  criminal to take hold of. And after a while, by piecing together little bits
  from here and little bits from there, a much more sinister aspect began to
  emerge; an aspect which bore out the letter written by Johnstone. He had
  called it treachery at the top; we called it by another name. For, in short,
  the Key Club had become a criminal organisation, which was all the more
  dangerous in view of the fact that ninety-nine per cent. of the members were
  totally unaware of any change. They were being exploited by a small nucleus
  of international crooks&mdash;crooks who did not stop at murder.</p>

  <p>"At first sight it seemed surprising; at second the only surprising thing
  about it was that we hadn't thought of it before. Here was a society capable
  of getting at times highly confidential information. And this society was
  insane enough to be inspired by ideals. Why, some of the big men must almost
  have fainted with horror at the thought of what they were missing! This milch
  cow already to hand, and nobody doing anything about it. The situation had to
  be remedied, and it was at the trifling cost of three men's lives.</p>

  <p>"When exactly the criminal element got in we couldn't find out, and it was
  immaterial. Obviously some time after the episode of the French high
  explosive, and before the Giuseppi affair. How many were actually posing as
  members of the Key Club we didn't know&mdash;we don't know now. One man in
  the inner councils would be enough to pass on information to his pals
  outside. But what we could do was to throw more light on the Harwich boat
  murder, or at any rate the reasons for it.</p>

  <p>"The man had been killed by some member of the nucleus who knew what he
  was carrying in the attaché case. At the time of his death he was undoubtedly
  on his way to the English Admiralty, from where the same procedure would have
  been followed as before with the explosive. Johnstone had been thrown from
  his window because by some means he had found out more than it was advisable
  for a mere member of the rank and file to know. And Giuseppi had been
  stabbed&mdash;this was only surmise on our part, but it fitted in&mdash;he
  had been stabbed to prevent any possibility of his again passing on the
  information to some other absurd idealist of the Key Club. In fact the cat
  had pulled a very plump chestnut out of the fire for the monkey to sell to
  France."</p>

  <p>"How long ago was all this?" asked Drummond.</p>

  <p>"About eighteen months. Since then, as far as I know, they have done
  nothing. Now it looks as if they were on the warpath again."</p>

  <p>"Any idea what they can be after?"</p>

  <p>"Not an earthly. I chucked the job I was on over a year ago. But I know
  all the boys who are still at it, and if&mdash;which is very
  unlikely&mdash;they are wise to anything, we may be able to help each other
  mutually."</p>

  <p>"Why unlikely?" queried Darrell.</p>

  <p>"If they're still hunting the same line of country, if as they did in the
  case of Giuseppi they've bribed one of our people to give away some secret,
  we shan't know anything about it till it's sold to a foreign Power."</p>

  <p>"Giuseppi was killed," said Drummond thoughtfully. "Do you know if anyone
  who would have been in a position to pass on information of value has gone
  west? There can't be a frightful number of 'em."</p>

  <p>"Not that I know of," answered Standish. "But that can easily be found
  out. In fact I'll do so now."</p>

  <p>He rose and went to the telephone, to return a few minutes later.</p>

  <p>"Definitely no one," he said. "The Yard people were a bit curious as to
  why I asked, but I rode 'em off. I want to be on rather firmer ground before
  bringing them in."</p>

  <p>"Do you think the brick bunger is the Giuseppi of the piece?"</p>

  <p>"It's possible. Though it makes it difficult to follow. They got him back:
  that you saw with your own eyes. So what more did they want?"</p>

  <p>"The message he threw through the window."</p>

  <p>"True, old boy. But why, <i>if</i> he's the Giuseppi this time, should he
  throw a message through the window? If he was the traitor, already badly
  wounded, and trying to get away with his life, why bung a cryptic and
  incomprehensible message into a cottage? Surely on seeing the light his first
  instinct would have been to come to the occupants for sanctuary."</p>

  <p>"But that's what defeats me whoever the bird was," cried Drummond. "In any
  event why didn't he come inside?"</p>

  <p>Standish lit a cigarette thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"The point has been puzzling me ever since I first heard it from Peter,"
  he said. "And I can think of only one solution. We must assume that the man
  was sane: the message, though we can't understand it at present, was not
  gibberish. This man, then, by some means which we don't know escaped from
  Emil and Co., and was wounded in doing so. He knew they were utterly
  unscrupulous and would stick at nothing. And so he reasoned as follows: 'If I
  go into that cottage and am found there they will think nothing of killing
  the occupants of the cottage in order to prevent the smallest chance of those
  occupants passing on the information which they will assume I have told them.
  And there goes my last hope of getting that information through. I will
  therefore throw a message in and go on myself in the hope that it will be
  found by the occupant and not by Emil and his friends.' Which incidentally is
  just what happened."</p>

  <p>Drummond nodded.</p>

  <p>"That's so. Through a sheer fluke."</p>

  <p>Standish shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"One has always got to take a chance," he remarked. "It came off, and
  that's all that matters. And it's not he who worries me most: it's the girl.
  I can't place her. She tries to dope your tea; she makes every endeavour she
  can to get hold of the message. O.K. so far. Nothing inconsistent up to date.
  On the way back she tells you about the Key Club."</p>

  <p>"Reviling the institution good and hearty," put in Drummond.</p>

  <p>"That may or may not mean anything: the point is that she brought up the
  subject. Why? She could have put up her little fairy tale about Harold
  without mentioning the Key Club at all. And if she is on their side..."</p>

  <p>He relapsed into silence and the other two stared at him.</p>

  <p>"Surely she must be," cried Drummond.</p>

  <p>"Something to it, Hugh," said Darrell. "You know what that bird told us
  this afternoon: she was drugged as well as Mrs. Eskdale."</p>

  <p>"It's this way," said Standish. "Her actions to start with don't tally
  with her later ones. To begin with she seems to be on the side of this man
  Emil; subsequently she seems against him."</p>

  <p>"Always provided it was Emil who did the drugging," put in Drummond.</p>

  <p>And at that moment the hall porter put his head round the corner.</p>

  <p>"One of you gentlemen named Captain Drummond?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"What do you want, porter?" said Drummond.</p>

  <p>"Telephone call from London, sir."</p>

  <p>"How the devil does anyone know I'm here?" cried Drummond in surprise.</p>

  <p>"May be Denny, Hugh," said Darrell. "I told him to put a call through in
  case the old lady came round."</p>

  <p>Drummond nodded and went off to the box.</p>

  <p>"It's a puzzler, Peter," remarked Standish. "Why did that girl go back to
  the cottage this afternoon?"</p>

  <p>"All Hugh and I could arrive at was that she wanted to verify the wire,"
  said Darrell.</p>

  <p>"But why? What should have made her suspicious? She must have believed it
  to be genuine when she got it, or she wouldn't have acted as she did. What
  made her change her mind? And stranger still. If she was allowed to receive
  it in the first instance without anyone bothering, why should there be this
  feverish excitement over her getting it repeated?"</p>

  <p>"Ask me another. The whole thing has got me guessing. Where does this tall
  bloke come in? It must have been him who stabbed that wretched devil. Is he
  one of this criminal bunch at the top that you were talking about? Because
  unless that man he killed was the world's best actor I'll swear he'd never
  even heard of the Key Club."</p>

  <p>"It oughtn't to be difficult to get a line on him," said Standish. "What
  was it, Hugh?"</p>

  <p>"Denny right enough," said Drummond, rejoining them. "Nannie has
  recovered. It was the telegram the girl went back about. I've just been
  talking to Nannie herself."</p>

  <p>"How is the old dear?" asked Darrell.</p>

  <p>"She's all right. Still got the twitters a bit. It seems the girl arrived
  about five minutes before the men did. Nannie was upstairs changing her
  dress, and the girl waited in the parlour."</p>

  <p>"Where presumably she read the wire as you sent it to Mrs. Eskdale," said
  Standish.</p>

  <p>"No," answered Drummond. "I specially asked her that. The old lady had
  torn it up. All the girl wanted to see was the original message that had come
  through the window. Which put Nannie, somewhat naturally, in a quandary as
  she hadn't any message. And then, before the old lady realised what was
  happening, the man appeared on the scene, and she remembers nothing
  more."</p>

  <p>Standish started to pace up and down with his hands thrust deep in his
  pockets.</p>

  <p>"This beats me," he said. "Why should the girl have wanted to see the
  original message? If, which is extremely unlikely, she had discovered it was
  Coldspur's tip she would have realised that you had been fooling her, Hugh,
  from the word 'go.' What possible object could there be in that case of her
  going back to the cottage? If, on the other hand, she still believed the wire
  to be genuine, why bother to confirm it? You think, Peter, to make sure there
  was no mistake in it. Perhaps you're right. But then&mdash;why drug her? It
  doesn't make sense to me. She was allowed to handle and read the wire in the
  morning, and she is doped when she tries to see the original in the
  afternoon. By Jove! chaps, there are some mighty rum points about this show.
  Is this man Meredith really the girl's uncle? Where does he stand with regard
  to Emil? Where do both of 'em stand with regard to Hugh's tall friend? Are
  they two separate gangs, and where does the Key Club come in? Is the girl
  with one and against the other, or is she against them both? If so, what is
  her game?"</p>

  <p>"There's another thing, too, that I can't understand," said Drummond. "No
  one is fonder of a thick-ear party than I am, but one doesn't go about
  slaughtering people unless there's a good reason. Why then is that tall swine
  so matey? Particularly with me. If they think..."</p>

  <p>He broke off abruptly.</p>

  <p>"Hullo! young feller, what do you want? Ronald&mdash;this is my friend Mr.
  Seymour of journalistic fame."</p>

  <p>The youngster gave a sheepish grin.</p>

  <p>"Well, sir," he said, "I remembered what you'd said about passing on that
  information. So after I'd handed in the stuff to the sub-editor I went into a
  pub in Belmoreton. And I heard Tom the barman talking about Mrs. Eskdale, and
  saying what a funny thing it was she'd taken to racing. So I pricked up my
  ears and asked a few questions. And it turned out that the man in the post
  office, who always has a bit on every day, had been in there at lunch and had
  remarked on Mrs. Eskdale having sent a wire containing a racing tip. Joe
  wouldn't have thought any more about it but for the fact that a stranger in
  the corner seemed very interested, and asked a lot of questions. The man from
  the post office got suspicious and shut up, but the stranger went straight
  away into the telephone box, and put through a long-distance call. At least
  Joe thought it must have been long-distance owing to the time it took."</p>

  <p>"What time was this, Seymour?" said Drummond.</p>

  <p>"I suppose about midday, sir, or half-past twelve."</p>

  <p>"How do you fit that in, Ronald?"</p>

  <p>"What time did the wire arrive at Hartley Court?" asked Standish.</p>

  <p>"Just about midday too," said Drummond.</p>

  <p>"So that you had left Hartley Court before there was any possibility of
  this telephone message saying the wire was a fake reaching the other
  side."</p>

  <p>He turned to Seymour.</p>

  <p>"Did your friend Tom, the potman, happen to mention any specific question
  the stranger had put?"</p>

  <p>"Apparently he was very anxious to find out whom the wire had been sent
  to."</p>

  <p>"And did the post office man tell him?"</p>

  <p>"I couldn't tell you, sir. But I know that he did say it was a <i>Morning
  Leader</i> tip, and that Coldspur was dead out of form just now."</p>

  <p>Standish rubbed his hands together.</p>

  <p>"Things became a trifle clearer, Hugh," he said. "They saw at once that
  the only person who could possibly have inspired the worthy Mrs. Eskdale to
  send a bogus wire was you yourself. And therefore they realised you had been
  fooling 'em. Hence the target practice this afternoon. What, however, is not
  so clear&mdash;in fact this information has increased the fog&mdash;is their
  treatment of the girl. It's difficult enough to see why they should have
  drugged her when they thought it was all genuine. But why they should do so
  if they knew it was a fake is beyond me. If what Seymour tells us is
  correct&mdash;and from the activity over there this afternoon I'm sure it
  is&mdash;they must have known there was no message at all at the
  cottage."</p>

  <p>"So must the girl," objected Darrell.</p>

  <p>"I wonder," said Standish slowly. "I wonder. Supposing she didn't know
  anything about it: supposing she believed the wire to be genuine. She goes
  back to the cottage to make sure, and for some reason or other that action
  arouses their suspicions. Alternatively, suppose they don't want her to find
  out the message is a dud... I know it's difficult to follow, but when you
  come across an apparently inexplicable fact, you must be prepared to accept
  an equally inexplicable solution. If it fits... In short, have we a parallel
  with the Giuseppi case? Is this girl the counterpart of Johnstone? If
  so..."</p>

  <p>He paused and his face was grave.</p>

  <p>"You mean she may be in danger," said Drummond.</p>

  <p>"Exactly. And I don't like it. Not one little bit. Men who indulge in gun
  practice on an open road are not likely to entertain many scruples over a
  mere girl. Look here, Seymour," he continued, "you'd better get back, and do
  exactly what Captain Drummond told you. You did excellently in bringing us
  this information; it's most valuable."</p>

  <p>The youngster's face flushed with pleasure and Drummond smiled at him.</p>

  <p>"You shall have your scoop, young feller," he said. "Keep your ears open
  and your mouth shut. A good boy," he went on, as the roar of a motor-bicycle
  announced his departure. "He may prove useful. What's the next move,
  sergeant-major? So far as I can see, everything we've done up to date has
  been a waste of time."</p>

  <p>"Let's adjourn to the abode of drink," answered Standish, "where in the
  intervals of lowering a couple we might hear some local gossip."</p>

  <p>The three men crossed the lounge and entered the bar, which was
  deserted.</p>

  <p>"Good evening, bright eyes," said Drummond. "Will you with your own fair
  hands decant some sherry?"</p>

  <p>"Dry or sweet?" asked the barmaid.</p>

  <p>"Dry, darling. Tell me, have you ever in the course of your peregrinations
  round the smiling country-side gone past a house called Hartley Court?"</p>

  <p>"Hartley Court," cried the girl, "belongs to Doctor Belfage."</p>

  <p>"I had an idea that a man called Meredith was living there at present,"
  said Drummond.</p>

  <p>"Very likely. The doctor often lets it to the racing set. Two and six,
  please! At least, I suppose he didn't ought to be called a doctor no
  more."</p>

  <p>"Dear, dear," cried Drummond. "Has he blotted his copy-book?"</p>

  <p>"Not half he hasn't. Got struck off the register about a year ago. Fair
  scandal there was, I can tell you."</p>

  <p>"How very reprehensible," remarked Drummond,</p>

  <p>"Nasty little man he was, too," continued the girl. "I wouldn't have had
  him near me: him and his beastly animals. Had a sort of zoo, he did. Taken
  'em with him to his other house."</p>

  <p>"And where might that be?" asked Drummond idly.</p>

  <p>"Good gracious me," muttered the girl. "Talk of the devil..."</p>

  <p>A short, stout man had entered the bar. His face was round and puffy; his
  appearance oily and smug.</p>

  <p>"Good evening, my dear," he said, washing his hands with invisible soap.
  "I think&mdash;yes, I think&mdash;a little drop of auntie's ruin with some
  Angostura bitters in it. Been a lovely day, gentlemen."</p>

  <p>"Very," answered Drummond curtly, and glanced at Standish, whose face was
  expressionless.</p>

  <p>In the lapel of Doctor Belfage's coat was a small bronze key.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap7"
     name="chap7">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"Funny, isn't it," remarked the barmaid, "that you should
  have been saying... Now then, clumsy, look where you're putting your great
  fat hands."</p>

  <p>"A thousand apologies, my dear," cried Standish, picking up the glass he
  had knocked over. "Let's have the other half. It is strange, sir," he
  continued affably, "that just before you came in we were remarking on the
  fact that outside the Navy one so rarely sees the good homely pink gin being
  drunk. Cocktails, yes: gin and French: sherry."</p>

  <p>He rambled on, and the barmaid after one quick look of surprise took her
  cue.</p>

  <p>"And, by the way, sir," Standish was saying, "if it's not an impertinent
  question on my part, may I ask if that badge you are wearing in your coat has
  any special significance?"</p>

  <p>"It certainly has, sir," answered the other. "It is the badge of a society
  to which I belong, and a meeting of which I am actually attending to-
  night."</p>

  <p>"Indeed," said Standish politely. "Some local organisation, I
  suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Far from it, I assure you. I don't think I am exaggerating when I say
  that its ramifications extend all over the world. The Key Club, sir, so
  called because it symbolises the unlocking of the door into an improved
  world. Many of the undergraduates here belong to it; there is no entrance
  fee, and membership is open to all regardless of social position."</p>

  <p>"Most interesting," remarked Standish. "Some time I must make further
  inquiries about it."</p>

  <p>"Would you care to come to the meeting this evening&mdash;you and your
  friends?" asked the doctor. "There will be no difficulty about it at all.
  Strictly speaking each member is allowed only one guest, but I can easily
  arrange for other people to sponsor two of you."</p>

  <p>"That is very good of you," said Standish. "Where is the meeting being
  held?"</p>

  <p>"At a house of mine called Hartley Court. It is at present let, but the
  tenant is a keen member of the Key Club himself."</p>

  <p>He glanced at his watch.</p>

  <p>"We shall just be in nice time if we start now," he continued. "The house
  is about three miles out of Cambridge."</p>

  <p>He looked at them inquiringly, and Drummond shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I shan't be able to avail myself of your kind offer," he
  remarked. "I've got to be pushing off for London shortly. But why don't you
  two fellows go? It ought to be rather interesting."</p>

  <p>"Peter can't very well," said Standish. "You've got that bloke coming in
  at ten, old boy."</p>

  <p>"So I have," cried Darrell. "Forgotten all about him till you mentioned
  it."</p>

  <p>"But I'd like to come very much," said Standish, lighting a cigarette. "I
  suppose it won't be a very late show?"</p>

  <p>"About eleven o'clock. And then we have an informal talk, with light
  refreshments. Well, good night, gentlemen." He bowed to Drummond and Darrell.
  "I'm sorry you can't come."</p>

  <p>The door closed behind him and Standish, and immediately the barmaid
  became agog with excitement.</p>

  <p>"What's the game?" she cried. "What are you boys up to? Be sports and
  tell. I played up over that pink gin."</p>

  <p>"You did indeed, my dear," said Drummond. "And I'd tell you like a shot
  what we were up to if I knew myself. I mean it, really; I promise you."</p>

  <p>"Tell that to the marines," she scoffed. "Why didn't you want that little
  horror to know you'd been asking me about Hartley Court? Him and his improved
  world! I nearly gave the show away then by laughing. Look here," she said
  shrewdly, "is there something crooked on? Are you guys detectives?"</p>

  <p>"We are not," laughed Drummond. "But..."</p>

  <p>He paused as a page-boy came into the bar with a letter.</p>

  <p>"Given me by a gent, sir, what's just left."</p>

  <p>Drummond opened it, and found a hastily scrawled note from Standish.</p>

  <p><i>Safer neither of you come: even Peter might be recognised. Don't know
  if clumsy trap or pure coincidence. Be on hand outside. Keep that barmaid's
  mouth shut. Am taking Peter's car. R.S.</i></p>

  <p>He read it and handed it to Darrell.</p>

  <p>"No, my dear," he said, "we are not detectives. At the same time, you can
  take it from me that there is a bit more in this than meets the eye. And I
  want you, please, to promise me something. It's really very important. I want
  you to promise that you won't say a word about it to a soul. There's a big
  bet on, and if you keep quiet there's a spot of money in it for me, and a
  fiver in it for you."</p>

  <p>"A fiver! Big boy, for a fiver an oyster would deafen you compared to me.
  For all that, I wish you'd tell."</p>

  <p>"Honest, kid, there's nothing to tell as yet. Thumbs crossed. Later on
  there may be lots, and you're for the front row of the stalls.... A bit rum,
  Peter," he went on thoughtfully, "having a debagged doctor in a moral uplift
  society."</p>

  <p>"Probably joined before he got the bird," said Darrell. "May have been
  useful to him in his practice."</p>

  <p>"I've seen other guys wearing that little key," announced the barmaid.
  "Undergraduates mostly. I thought it was some University club. Pretty pimply-
  looking lot they were."</p>

  <p>"Do you know where that little man lives now?" asked Drummond.</p>

  <p>"I don't," said the girl. "He went right away from this part of the
  country when the trouble took place."</p>

  <p>"And one rather wonders, Peter, what brings him back," remarked Drummond.
  "I can't think that a meeting of his darned club, finishing up with light
  refreshments at eleven, would prove a sufficient inducement.... Give me some
  sandwiches, my pet," he continued, as some men came into the bar. "We will
  get down to 'em in that corner."</p>

  <p>"What's the plan of campaign, Hugh?" said Darrell as they sat down.</p>

  <p>"We'll have to be guided by events," answered Drummond. "Personally, I
  don't think Ronald is likely to find anything out that's going to help us.
  This meeting can't have been arranged to-day, so presumably it's just in the
  ordinary course of affairs: part of the general smoke screen which covers the
  doings behind. In which case those attending it will be perfectly
  harmless."</p>

  <p>He glanced at his watch.</p>

  <p>"No good our starting for at least another hour," he remarked. "I'm going
  to have a spot of shut eye. Wake me if I snore."</p>

  <p>It was one of Drummond's most remarkable traits&mdash;his ability to
  snatch forty winks almost at will, and in a couple of minutes he was sound
  asleep. Darrell, on the other hand, had never felt so wide-awake in his life.
  Vaguely he heard odd remarks from the bunch gathered round the bar, but his
  brain was busy trying to get some semblance of order into the existing chaos.
  What Standish had told them certainly threw some light on the matter, but in
  all conscience light was needed.</p>

  <p>That their trip to Kessingland had been a complete waste of time was
  obvious, but what would have happened if they had not gone back via the
  cottage? Doing so had only been a last-minute decision and could not have
  been anticipated by the other side. And yet they had left a man to watch the
  cottage. Taking no chances evidently.... Even so, to murder him for a
  trifling indiscretion seemed a bit drastic.</p>

  <p>And the attempt on Drummond's life. True, when it was made they knew he
  had fooled them: true, they suspected even if they did not <i>know</i> that
  he had been in possession of the genuine message the whole time. But murder
  seemed out of all proportion when the contents of the message were
  considered. On the other hand, admittedly they could not know what those
  contents were.</p>

  <p><i>Mary Jane. Urgent G G Font. A5.</i></p>

  <p>What the devil did it mean? Could it be that Mary Jane was the girl
  herself&mdash;Doris Venables? A nickname or something of that sort. That the
  message was actually intended for her? In that case she must have known there
  was something badly wrong, when she got Drummond's faked wire. A point; a
  definite point.... <i>Did</i> she know? Was she playing some very deep
  game&mdash;deeper by far than the unfortunate Johnstone in the Giuseppi
  affair? And the more he thought of it, the more did he become convinced that
  if Miss Doris Venables could be found and made to talk, many things would
  become clearer.</p>

  <p>The bar was getting more empty. Drummond was still asleep, and Darrell
  himself was beginning to feel drowsy, when, happening to glance at the door,
  he saw something that instantly made him wide awake. Not that he gave any
  outward sign of it&mdash;Drummond had trained him far too well for
  that&mdash;but every sense was on the alert. Save for a narrow horizontal
  strip at the top the door consisted of frosted glass. And in the centre of
  that strip was the face of a man. He was looking straight at their corner,
  and after a while he turned and spoke to someone who was out of sight. Then
  he disappeared, and Darrell touched Drummond on the arm.</p>

  <p>"Sorry to disturb your slumbers, old boy," he remarked, "but a guy has
  been peering through the top of the door and giving us the once over. He's
  gone now, but in case he comes back you'd better have a look at his
  dial."</p>

  <p>"Sure it was us he was interested in?" asked Drummond.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely. He was looking straight at us."</p>

  <p>They waited a few minutes, but there was no further sign of him. And when
  at length the bar closed and they went into the lounge they could see no one
  about the place who looked even remotely interested in their doings.</p>

  <p>"You can see that corner perfectly," said Darrell, and then he gave a
  sudden exclamation. "Come here, Hugh. I'm six foot, and I can only just see
  over the frosted glass. I saw that bloke's whole face; I saw his chin."</p>

  <p>"Our tall friend?" queried Drummond thoughtfully and beckoned to the hall
  porter. "Has a very tall gentleman been in here recently?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, there has. He went about five minutes ago."</p>

  <p>"Do you know his name?" asked Drummond.</p>

  <p>"No, sir. I ain't never seen him before."</p>

  <p>The page-boy had drawn near and now spoke.</p>

  <p>"Asked for you, sir, he did. Captain Drummond. I said as 'ow you were in
  the bar, and I thought the gentleman had joined you."</p>

  <p>Drummond nodded and turned away.</p>

  <p>"Seems hard to shake 'em off, Peter," he remarked. "Do we perceive in this
  the hand of the unfrocked doctor?"</p>

  <p>"He didn't know your name," said Darrell.</p>

  <p>"No. But with a face like mine I'm not hard to describe. I'm open to a
  small bet, Peter, that there are other activities on at Hartley Court
  to-night, besides that fatuous meeting. And it's on account of these that
  Doctor Belfage has appeared on the scene. It's unfortunate he should have
  chosen to lower his pink gin at this pub, but it can't be helped. Of course
  the instant he arrived at the house he was told about us, and realised he'd
  been talking to the very men who had caused all the commotion. Longshanks was
  there and came down to make sure."</p>

  <p>"I hope old Ronald's all right," said Darrell.</p>

  <p>Drummond laughed.</p>

  <p>"I don't think we need worry our heads about Ronald," he answered. "His
  only danger is the possibility that the light refreshments at eleven may
  prove to be non-alcoholic. No, Peter, it's you and I who have got to watch it
  just at the moment. And what I'm wondering about is their next move.
  Officially I'm going to London, and you're seeing a man about a dog here. But
  do they believe it? If so, are they going to take any steps to alter our
  plans?... Good Lord! Cabbageface, what on earth are you doing here?"</p>

  <p>A tall, somewhat languid man had just entered the hotel, followed by a
  positive lorry-load of suitcases.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, Hugh!" he drawled. "The surprise is mutual. Can one get a
  drink?"</p>

  <p>"If you're staying in the hotel, sir," said the hall porter.</p>

  <p>"Clarence," remarked the new-comer, "I fear you will not rise high in your
  profession. Do you imagine I have taken those bags out of the car merely to
  put them back again?"</p>

  <p>"Peter," said Drummond, "meet Cabbageface, otherwise known as Major
  Humphrey Gregson. This is Darrell."</p>

  <p>The two men shook hands.</p>

  <p>"Often seen you playing at Lord's," said Gregson, "in the intervals of my
  onerous duties at the War House."</p>

  <p>"Are you travelling in underclothes or what, old boy?" demanded Drummond,
  eyeing the pile of suit-cases.</p>

  <p>"Not exactly," said the other with a grin. "But honestly, Hugh, what are
  you fellows doing here?"</p>

  <p>"Investigating a spot of bother, Cabbageface," answered Drummond
  guilelessly.</p>

  <p>Gregson looked at him steadily over the rim of his glass.</p>

  <p>"Ever the same old Hugh," he remarked quietly. "Can it be possible, I
  wonder, that this meeting is not quite so fortuitous as it appeared at first
  sight?"</p>

  <p>"Ronald Standish is here," said Drummond, with apparent irrelevance.</p>

  <p>"The devil he is! When did he come?"</p>

  <p>"This afternoon."</p>

  <p>"Is he in the hotel now?"</p>

  <p>"No, Cabbageface, he is not," said Drummond deliberately. "He is at the
  present moment attending a meeting of a society known as the Key Club."</p>

  <p>Gregson stared at him blankly.</p>

  <p>"Standish at a meeting of the Key Club!" he remarked in amazement. "What
  in the name of all that's marvellous is he doing that for?"</p>

  <p>"He was asked by a nice kind gentleman," said Drummond. "So incidentally
  were we, but Peter and I wouldn't play. By the way, have you ever heard of a
  doctor called Belfage?"</p>

  <p>"No. Why?"</p>

  <p>"Or a man called Meredith?"</p>

  <p>Gregson shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Or a German named Emil?"</p>

  <p>"Emil! Medium height: dark: dangerous-looking customer."</p>

  <p>"The description serves."</p>

  <p>"That might be Emil Veight," said Gregson half to himself. "Hugh," he
  continued, "this is the most amazing affair. Quite obviously we are mixed up
  in the same show. How on earth did you get pushed into it?"</p>

  <p>For a few moments Drummond did not reply. Then:</p>

  <p>"What's your job at the War House, Humphrey?"</p>

  <p>"Intelligence&mdash;though you might not think so."</p>

  <p>"Hush-hush business you mean."</p>

  <p>Gregson nodded.</p>

  <p>"You can call it that if you like."</p>

  <p>"If you were sending a report, or getting a message through, would you
  always sign yourself by your own name?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know that I'm quite prepared to answer that question, Hugh," said
  Gregson. "A bit near the confidential, you know. And we must pretend to be
  hush-hush."</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't perhaps sign yourself A2 or A3 or something like that?"
  pursued Drummond imperturbably.</p>

  <p>Gregson stared at him.</p>

  <p>"Without committing myself," he said quietly, "let us assume for the
  moment that I should."</p>

  <p>"Good," remarked Drummond. "You asked me how I got pushed into this
  performance. The reason was that someone who signed himself A5&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ginger Lovelace!" cried Gregson involuntarily,</p>

  <p>"Bunged a message through the window of a cottage I was staying in last
  night," continued Drummond, ignoring the interruption.</p>

  <p>"But why did he do that?" cried Gregson, utterly bewildered.</p>

  <p>"Because he was wounded unto death," said Drummond gravely, "and Emil and
  his damned bunch were after him."</p>

  <p>"My God!" stammered Gregson. "Ginger wounded! Where is he now?"</p>

  <p>"I can't tell you," said Drummond, "for I don't know. Before I could get
  hold of him he'd vanished into the fog. And then Emil and Co. appeared on the
  scene."</p>

  <p>"What was the message, Hugh?"</p>

  <p>Drummond looked round; there was no one near.</p>

  <p>"'Mary Jane. Urgent. G G Pont. A5,'" he said in a low voice. "Can you make
  head or tail of it?"</p>

  <p>"'Mary Jane,'" repeated Gregson. "'G G Pont.' What the devil was the old
  lad talking about?"</p>

  <p>"It means nothing in your young life then?" said Drummond.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely nix," answered Gregson. "Ginger wounded! Have you been to the
  police?"</p>

  <p>"Yes and no, Humphrey. It's much too long a story to go into now, but
  rightly or wrongly I decided not to last night. The cottage is not on the
  telephone: you couldn't see your hand in front of your face: and I had no
  idea who the bloke was. In fact at the time the whole thing completely
  defeated me. But to-day's doings have produced one certainty. The gentlemen
  on the other side are prepared to go literally to any lengths to get hold of
  the message I've just told you. Now even if that message is beyond you, can't
  you throw some light on things? Why was Lovelace down here? What's brought
  you down here?"</p>

  <p>Gregson lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"One at a time. Lovelace has officially been on leave for a matter of two
  months. And with us, as you may know, that does not mean leave. I'm not clear
  what he's been on: the Chief is a firm believer in not letting the right hand
  know what the left is doing. All I can tell you is that he has been in
  Poland, and until now I thought he was there still. So much for Ginger. Now
  for my show. I was to come here prepared for any eventuality; hence"&mdash;he
  grinned gently and waved a hand at the suitcases&mdash;"a few props in the
  change-of-appearance line. I was to meet a woman round about ten o'clock, and
  after I'd heard what she had to say, I was to act entirely on my own
  initiative. And it being about ten now, the lady may shortly
  materialise."</p>

  <p>"And she may not," said Drummond thoughtfully. "It's beginning to fit a
  little more, Peter. Have you any idea what sort of a woman she is,
  Cabbageface?"</p>

  <p>"Not the slightest, old boy. No more, I gather, had the Chief. In fact he
  was even less communicative than usual. But he did mention the Key Club,
  which proves that we are both chasing the same hare."</p>

  <p>"Do you employ any women on your job?" asked Drummond.</p>

  <p>"Certainly. But none, so far as I'm aware of, actually in England."</p>

  <p>"Your boss would know if this woman you're meeting was one of them?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. But that doesn't mean he'd of necessity tell me."</p>

  <p>He looked at Drummond keenly.</p>

  <p>"From the general tenor of your remarks, Hugh," he said, "you would seem
  to have encountered a lady during the day's toil. Have you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," answered Drummond. "I'll make it as concise as I can, Cabbageface,
  because Peter and I have a date."</p>

  <p>Gregson listened without comment, and it might have been noticed that the
  languid expression had completely disappeared.</p>

  <p>"Doris Venables," he said, when Drummond had finished. "She is a new one
  on me, though that means nothing. And you think it may be she who got in
  touch with the Chief?"</p>

  <p>"It looks possible. She is obviously mixed up in this show, and she's the
  only woman we've butted into up to date."</p>

  <p>"In that case," remarked Gregson thoughtfully, "I doubt if I shall have
  the pleasure of making the lady's acquaintance to-night. They must have found
  her out."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Drummond gravely. "I'm afraid they have. And if that is so,
  from what I've seen of 'em I doubt if you'll ever make her acquaintance.
  Could you possibly get on to the Chief to-night?"</p>

  <p>"Possibly: at his private house. I can try."</p>

  <p>"I wish you would. It won't take you long to get through at this hour. I'd
  like to know before we start."</p>

  <p>"Where are you going?"</p>

  <p>"To the house where the meeting of the Key Club is in progress. Are you
  coming?"</p>

  <p>"I'd like to, but I'll tell you for certain when I've 'phoned the
  Chief."</p>

  <p>"I like it less and less, Peter," said Drummond as Gregson entered the
  telephone box. "I know she tried the dirty on me this morning, but the more I
  think of it the more do I believe that Ronald's right. I believe that girl is
  fighting a lone hand; I believe that even if she's not on our side she's
  against the others. And they've got her&mdash;the swine.... Well,
  Cabbageface?"</p>

  <p>"Got straight through to him," said Gregson, as he joined them. "He does
  not know anyone called Doris Venables. The woman who rang him up gave no
  name. But she mentioned the Key Club and Emil Veight: so I was right there.
  I'm to use my own discretion as to what I do."</p>

  <p>"He didn't happen to say what time she rang him up, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"After lunch."</p>

  <p>"So if it was little Doris, she must have done it on her way to the
  cottage. She went there to confirm the wire by seeing the original: she then
  proposed to pass it on to you to-night and fixed an hour when she knew this
  meeting was taking place, and she could slip away undetected. Is this bird
  Emil Veight well known?"</p>

  <p>"Only to the select few, old boy. High up in the German Secret Service
  during the War, and since then a cosmopolitan spy."</p>

  <p>"Cosmopolitan!" Drummond raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"International, if you prefer it," said Gregson. "If the cash is there he
  is prepared to work for anybody. A thoroughly dangerous customer, but if any
  blood-letting has to be done he generally leaves it to other people."</p>

  <p>"One other point, Cabbageface," remarked Drummond. "I wonder why she rang
  you up, and not Scotland Yard. As a rule you blush unseen so far as the
  outside is concerned."</p>

  <p>"Only the lady herself can tell us that," answered Gregson. "And since it
  is now half-past ten I'm thinking there is not much use waiting for her to do
  so here. How far is this house you've been talking about?"</p>

  <p>"About three miles. Are you coming?"</p>

  <p>"You bet your life I am. I'll address the gathering if you like."</p>

  <p>"Look here, Humphrey, we'd love to have you, but I don't want you to come
  under false pretences. Holding His Majesty's commission and all that sort of
  stuff. It's not the meeting I want to see: it's the other activities&mdash;if
  any. We're going to break into that house, and if we're caught there's going
  to be trouble."</p>

  <p>"My dear Hugh," said Gregson with a faint grin, "if one half of what you
  have told me is correct, I can't quite see the proud proprietors ringing up
  the police whatever we do. So let's get on with it."</p>

  <p>"Good for you," answered Drummond. "But I thought I'd better warn
  you."</p>

  <p>He crossed the lounge to a map that was hanging on the wall.</p>

  <p>"The house is there," he said, "so we'll start in the opposite direction
  and make a <i>détour</i>. The betting is a fiver to an orange pip that this
  hotel is being watched, and it may help to put 'em off. Let's go in your car,
  Humphrey, as it is outside."</p>

  <p>The cinemas were emptying as they left the hotel, so that the street was
  fairly crowded. But they were clear of the town in a few minutes, and Gregson
  let the car out.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to see the type of bird who attends these meetings," said
  Drummond. "I should think Ronald must be having a gorgeous time. Go left
  here, Humphrey."</p>

  <p>They got into a network of smaller roads as they circled round Cambridge,
  and it was Darrell who first noticed that they were being followed.</p>

  <p>"No one who isn't loopy would come this way for fun," he remarked.
  "There's been a car about two hundred yards behind us ever since we
  left."</p>

  <p>Drummond looked up from the map he was studying and turned round.</p>

  <p>"I saw one of those little wasp effects standing near the entrance to the
  hotel garage," he said. "If it's the same you'll never get away from it,
  Cabbageface. I vote we stop and see. We're in plenty of time for the party.
  Pull up round this corner, old boy, and switch off your lights. Stay in the
  middle of the road."</p>

  <p>Gregson did so, and Drummond was out in a flash and into the ditch
  followed by the other two. The car behind them was just approaching the bend,
  and he heard a sudden screech of brakes as the driver realised that the
  headlights he had been following were no longer there. Then it pulled up with
  a jerk some ten yards from the deserted car.</p>

  <p>"Good evening," said Drummond placidly. "I trust we are in fine
  fettle."</p>

  <p>The two occupants swung round, as a torch shone on them from behind. They
  could see nobody, only a vague outline leaning over the back of the car. And
  then suddenly the outline was joined by two more.</p>

  <p>"What the devil is the meaning of this?" spluttered the driver.</p>

  <p>"Motor bandits, my dear boy," remarked Drummond. "And now tell me all that
  is in your heart. Why, for instance, have you been following me all over
  England?"</p>

  <p>"You're mad, sir," cried the driver. "Why should I want to follow
  you?"</p>

  <p>"You're very pimply, Narcissus," said Drummond thoughtfully. "And so is
  your friend. I once cured a man of pimples, but the treatment was too drastic
  and he died. So if you want to retain your pimples, and I can quite realise
  you'd be unrecognisable without them, you will answer my question. Why have
  you been following me?"</p>

  <p>"Go to hell," said the youth furiously. "I've taken the number of your
  car. My friend and I are undergraduates, and you'll hear from the police
  about this. Do you imagine you've bought the blasted road? Why can't we drive
  where we like?"</p>

  <p>"Not on your bath night, Narcissus. I see you are members of the Key
  Club."</p>

  <p>"What's that to do with you?"</p>

  <p>"Strange, isn't it, Peter?" remarked Drummond. "They are certainly a
  peculiar institution. Unfrocked doctors, and half blues for cat's cradle.
  Well, my dear boys, you are shortly going to be the victims of an abominable
  outrage. England will ring with it: questions will be asked in Parliament.
  But I don't like your lights behind me at all. And as your car is undoubtedly
  faster than ours there's nothing else for it. Do you mind my extracting you
  from your seats?"</p>

  <p>Two large hands seized the driver and his companion by the coat collar,
  and drew them out as a cork is drawn from a bottle.</p>

  <p>"Have you any rope in your car, Cabbageface?"</p>

  <p>"I have," said Gregson in a shaking voice.</p>

  <p>"Good. Then we'll just tie these two back to back in the middle of the
  road, and if anyone comes along they can pretend to be perfect strangers. And
  if no one comes along, Narcissus, you can hold converse with one another
  through the small hours on the infinite blessings of peace and disarmament.
  Also the stupidity of following another car quite so closely in a flat
  country. No, no: there's no good in struggling. Your state of fitness might
  just enable you to last for a couple of rounds of spillikins, but you mustn't
  tax yourselves more until you've had your Ovaltine. Finished, Peter?"</p>

  <p>The two youths were almost crying with rage and fury. They were standing
  back to back each with his right wrist lashed to the other's left, whilst
  round their waists ran one strand of rope.</p>

  <p>"Unspeakable cads," spluttered Narcissus.</p>

  <p>"Not at all," said Drummond genially. "Personally, I think we've let you
  off very lightly. You mustn't go following people round the country. And if I
  may give you a word of advice it is this. Don't fall down. If you do, not
  only will the one underneath leave a lot of his face in the road, but you'll
  find it practically impossible to get up again. Come on, chaps: we mustn't
  delay any more. Good night, my little ones."</p>

  <p>"You'll be getting me cashiered, Hugh," said Gregson, still weak with
  laughter, as they drove away. "Of all the outrageous assaults I have ever
  seen perpetrated, that wins in a canter, and the blighters have got my
  number."</p>

  <p>"They won't do anything, old boy," answered Drummond. "They would never
  hear the last of it if they did. Anyway I'm the culprit. But have you ever
  seen such a pair of maggots?"</p>

  <p>"What do you expect from a bunch of crazy pacifists?" cried Gregson. "The
  Lord knows&mdash;I don't suppose any of us three want another war, but we
  don't get hysterical about it. And we know what war is; they don't."</p>

  <p>"I take it there can be no doubt that this is another Giuseppi affair,"
  said Drummond after a while.</p>

  <p>"Not the slightest, I should say, if Veight is mixed up in it."</p>

  <p>"Do you know of anything particularly secret which we've got at the
  moment?"</p>

  <p>"There are always a lot of confidential things knocking around," said
  Gregson. "But I can't say I know of anything that is a super secret. The
  Chief might. And to-morrow I, at any rate, must get to him as quickly as
  possible. Jove! if only one could get a word with Ginger... What was he on
  the track of?"</p>

  <p>"One thing is pretty clear, Humphrey. Whatever the game is, it isn't over
  yet. If they'd already got their information, they wouldn't still be playing
  round here. No one would run the risks they have run to-day without some very
  powerful incentive."</p>

  <p>"That's true," agreed Gregson. "And that's what I don't quite understand.
  You either get information or you don't. If you're going to get it, it
  presupposes that the individual you are getting it from is willing to sell
  it. In which case why the Wild West show?"</p>

  <p>"Supposing the individual wasn't willing to sell it and they want to make
  him?" suggested Drummond.</p>

  <p>"Keeping him a prisoner, you mean. Possibly. But if anyone in a position
  to sell big stuff had disappeared we should know about it. And, so far as I
  know, no one has."</p>

  <p>"It's a teaser, Cabbageface. Anyway, we may discover more to-night. There
  is Hartley Court in front of us, and the party is still going on. Let's leave
  the car here and walk."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap8"
     name="chap8">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A row of cars drawn up in the drive proclaimed that the
  meeting was a popular one. The front of the house was in darkness save for
  the hall, and light on the lawn at the back showed that the Key Club was
  airing its views on that side of the house. Luckily the undergrowth was
  dense, and the three men had no difficulty in finding a spot from which they
  could view the proceedings, which in all conscience were harmless enough.</p>

  <p>A large and somewhat pompous-looking individual was holding the floor at
  the moment. They were too far off to hear what he was saying, but the
  audience, in which there was quite a sprinkling of women, was obviously
  becoming restive. And since it was ten minutes past the time for light
  refreshments the fact was not surprising. At last he sat down and after a
  little perfunctory applause Meredith got up.</p>

  <p>"Evidently the end of a perfect day," whispered Drummond. "That is Uncle
  John. And the little blighter on Ronald's left is Doctor Belfage,
  Humphrey."</p>

  <p>More hearty applause this time and everybody rose to their feet, extending
  their hands palm upwards in front of them.</p>

  <p>"The Key Club!"</p>

  <p>The words came clearly to the listeners through the still air; then there
  was a general buzz of conversation as the party broke up into little
  groups.</p>

  <p>"Here comes Ronald," said Drummond as Standish appeared at the window. He
  was talking to Doctor Belfage, and after a while he stepped out on to the
  lawn, and lit a cigarette. Then he turned round facing the room and they
  could see a small light moving behind his back. He was signalling with a
  torch in Morse.</p>

  <p>"Short: long," muttered Drummond. "Check me, you fellows.
  R.U.T.H.E.R.E.H.O.O.T. 'Are you there? hoot.' Go on, Peter: you're better
  than I am at that game."</p>

  <p>The mournful cry of an owl came from Darrell, and at once the signals
  started again.</p>

  <p>W.A.I.T.W.I.L.L.J.O.I.N.U.</p>

  <p>"'Wait will join you,'" said Drummond. "And something more.
  D.A.N.G.E.R."</p>

  <p>The signalling stopped, and Standish stepped back into the room. The party
  was beginning to break up; from the front of the house came the sounds of
  self-starters.</p>

  <p>"Hope he won't be too long," remarked Drummond. "He'll have to park your
  car somewhere, Peter: he can't leave it in the drive."</p>

  <p>"He's saying his last tender farewells now," said Darrell. "Have you
  blokes noticed that there's not another solitary light in any room in the
  house? There must be some servants surely."</p>

  <p>The last of the guests departed, leaving Doctor Belfage and Meredith
  alone. That some heated argument was in progress was obvious: the ex-doctor
  being excited, while Meredith seemed to be trying to pacify him. And then one
  sentence reached the listeners' ears.</p>

  <p>"Madness! Why wasn't I told?"</p>

  <p>It was almost a shout, and Meredith laid a soothing hand on the little
  man's arm.</p>

  <p>At last the conversation finished and Meredith came over to the windows
  and shut them. Then he drew some wooden shutters across, and there came the
  sound of bolts being pushed home.</p>

  <p>"That's torn it," said Drummond. "No getting in by that room."</p>

  <p>The light still filtered out through the chinks, and Drummond turned to
  the other two.</p>

  <p>"Wait here," he muttered. "I'm going to do a bit of keyhole peeping. If
  Ronald comes give a hoot, Peter."</p>

  <p>He faded into the darkness like a great cat and a few moments later he was
  crouching outside the window peering in. Most of the room was outside his
  range of vision. He could see the table with the drinks and empty glasses,
  and some of the chairs pushed back in disorder just as their late occupants
  had left them. And then Doctor Belfage came into view, walking backwards and
  forwards with a worried look on his face. He was muttering to himself and
  every now and then he shook his fist in the air angrily. Clearly Meredith had
  not succeeded in calming him.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the little man halted. He swung round facing in what Drummond
  knew was the direction of the door, and a shadow fell across the floor. Then
  came a second shadow which materialised a moment later into a dark swarthy
  man with high cheek-bones and a hooked nose, who might have been a Spaniard.
  In his hand he held a small package which he gave to the doctor, who put it
  in his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Well, Doctor," came a deep voice, "how do things progress?"</p>

  <p>It was the unseen man who was speaking.</p>

  <p>"As well as can be expected," answered Belfage. "But I tell you that man
  is a devil: he has a will of iron."</p>

  <p>The dark man smiled evilly.</p>

  <p>"Others have had that will before," he said softly. "It is only a matter
  of time."</p>

  <p>"But we have no time," shrilled the doctor. "This man Drummond, of whom I
  learn for the first time when I arrive here to-night, may know everything. It
  was the act of a lunatic not to have warned me. My God! I actually asked him
  to come here."</p>

  <p>"And what would it have mattered if he had," rejoined the deep voice.
  "True, he might have died of boredom had he attended your ridiculous meeting,
  but that would have saved a lot of bother. Your nerves do not seem to be all
  they might, my dear Doctor."</p>

  <p>"They're shot to hell," cried the other. "I had no idea it would take so
  long. And now, after what happened last night we may be interrupted at any
  moment."</p>

  <p>"Calm yourself, Doctor. It was, I admit, unfortunate that our good friend
  Emil allowed that interfering soldier to give him the slip. It was still more
  unfortunate that he mistook Drummond for a farm labourer. For all that I
  don't think much damage has been done."</p>

  <p>"How can you possibly tell," demanded the doctor. "This man Drummond has
  deliberately fooled us from what Meredith tells me. And what he's done over
  one thing, he may very easily do over another."</p>

  <p>"He is certainly a nuisance," agreed the unseen man. "But, as I said
  before, I don't think we need worry overmuch. Had he discovered anything
  really vital, he would not still have been in Cambridge."</p>

  <p>"That's true," said the doctor. "I hadn't thought of that. But I shall be
  thankful when this is over."</p>

  <p>He lit a cigarette with a hand that shook a little.</p>

  <p>"I frankly admit," he continued, "that this latest development has shaken
  me badly."</p>

  <p>"One can't expect plain sailing all the time," returned the other
  contemptuously.</p>

  <p>And at that moment there came the hoot of an owl from across the lawn:
  Standish had arrived.</p>

  <p>"If only we could find out what Drummond knows," said the doctor.</p>

  <p>"Maybe we shall shortly," answered the other softly. "But from what I
  overheard this afternoon I don't think he knows much."</p>

  <p>The speaker came into sight: it was the tall man, and Drummond studied him
  thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"My God!" he heard a whisper from behind him. "It's Gregoroff."</p>

  <p>Drummond turned round: Standish was peering over his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"The most cold-blooded murderer unhung," muttered Standish. "Russian
  Secret Service: I ought to have thought of him when you mentioned his height.
  May the Lord help you, Hugh, if he ever gets you at his mercy."</p>

  <p>"Tell me the old, old story," whispered Drummond with a grin, as Gregoroff
  helped himself to a drink. "What are we going to do, Ronald?"</p>

  <p>"Wait and listen," answered Standish. "We may learn something."</p>

  <p>"No, I don't think he knows much." Gregoroff was speaking again. "But I
  had to take steps this afternoon to prevent any possibility of his learning
  more. Well, Doctor, there is a good deal to discuss. Shall we adjourn?"</p>

  <p>The light went out: the door closed, and Drummond straightened up.</p>

  <p>"Not going to learn anything more here," he muttered. "What about having a
  council of war?"</p>

  <p>They skirted round the lawn, and joined the other two.</p>

  <p>"You signalled danger, Ronald," said Drummond. "What did you find
  out?"</p>

  <p>"It was by way of being a general warning, old boy," answered Standish,
  "inspired by the personnel of the household. The people who attended the
  meeting were, as I expected, genuine and harmless. I've seldom heard more
  concentrated bilge talked quite so continuously, but that is neither here nor
  there. Mine host, Mr. Meredith, was the first gentleman to attract my
  attention. The last time I saw him he was being sentenced to seven of the
  best at the Old Bailey for forgery, under the name of Ferguson. The two men
  who took our coats and hats are both old lags, and another swine I saw on the
  stairs is a white slave merchant. And so I thought it wise to let you know,
  in case you hadn't realised it already, that the party wasn't entirely hot
  air and elderberry wine."</p>

  <p>"Did any of these blokes recognise you, Ronald?" said Drummond.</p>

  <p>"Not on your life. I blush unseen, so far as gentlemen of that kidney are
  concerned. Now except possibly for Meredith, those are all small fry. But
  there is also Emil Veight, who I didn't see, and now&mdash;Gregoroff."</p>

  <p>"Our tall friend, Peter," explained Drummond.</p>

  <p>"Well, as I was saying to you, Hugh," continued Standish, "if anything
  more was necessary to prove what we're up against, the presence of that devil
  does it. In fact, I can't imagine how he got into the country. It's true that
  so far as I remember he has never done anything criminal actually in England,
  but our people know all about him."</p>

  <p>"What do you make of the whole thing up to date?" said Darrell.</p>

  <p>"Just what I said to you at the hotel. This is a second Giuseppi case. But
  whom they have got hold of: what they have stolen: where the key to the
  mystery lies, I know no more than you. Is it in that house in front of us, or
  is it somewhere else? There are three cars still left in the drive, which
  seems to show that others may be leaving besides that doctor."</p>

  <p>And at that moment a woman's scream, instantly stifled, rang out. It came
  from the house and the four men stiffened.</p>

  <p>"That settles it," said Drummond quietly. "I'm going in. Are you fellows
  on?"</p>

  <p>"Sure," answered Standish. "But we keep together. The strange thing is
  that there's not a single light in any window."</p>

  <p>"There may be an inside room," said Drummond. "Come on. And keep your guns
  handy."</p>

  <p>They crossed the lawn, and began skirting round the walls to find a
  suitable window to break in at. But they were saved the trouble: a small side
  door was unlocked, and a moment later they were all inside the house.</p>

  <p>Absolute silence reigned, and the darkness was intense as they crept
  forward.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to switch on a torch," breathed Drummond. "Stand well away from
  me."</p>

  <p>The beam shone out and circling round picked up the staircase. Then
  darkness again as they felt their way towards it. And now a murmur of voices
  came from above, and a faint light which grew stronger as they advanced. A
  door was ajar on the first floor: it was through it that the light was
  filtering. Then the voices ceased, and they could hear the sound of a woman's
  sobs.</p>

  <p>"The penalty," said a harsh voice suddenly, "is death."</p>

  <p>It was so unexpected that they halted abruptly; then once again they
  tiptoed forward and paused by the room with the light. The sobs were coming
  from inside, and Drummond flung open the door, to stand motionless on the
  threshold. The room was an operating theatre.</p>

  <p>The walls were pure white, so designed that no corners existed to catch
  dust. The light was brilliant without being dazzling, and was thrown from a
  powerful reflector up on to the ceiling. Cases of gleaming instruments stood
  against the wall, and in the centre was the table and various basins.</p>

  <p>For a while it seemed as if the room was empty, and then as their eyes
  grew accustomed to the light they saw a woman lying on the floor on the far
  side of the room. Tears were streaming down her face, but her sobs had
  ceased, and she was staring at them in bewilderment. Young and dark, she was
  obviously a foreigner, and after a while she put her finger to her lips, as
  the sound of voices came from across the passage.</p>

  <p>"Save me," she whispered. "Save me, for the good God's sake."</p>

  <p>"Then get up," muttered Drummond. "We'll save you, but there is no need to
  lie there."</p>

  <p>"But I'm bound," she answered.</p>

  <p>In two strides Drummond was across the room, and had picked her up. Her
  ankles were lashed with rope, but there was no time to free them. At any
  moment the owners of the voices might return, and their situation with a
  helpless woman on their hands was not too good.</p>

  <p>"Hop it, boys," he said tensely. "We can come back later."</p>

  <p>And even as he spoke the door closed with an ominous clang.</p>

  <p>For a space they all stood motionless staring at it; then Drummond
  deposited the woman on the table and crossed the room.</p>

  <p>"Trapped," he said at length. "By all that's holy! What complete, utter,
  congenital fools we are. A steel door with a Yale lock."</p>

  <p>The woman started to whimper again, and with a short laugh Drummond
  returned to her, and taking out his knife he cut her free.</p>

  <p>"Well, my dear," he remarked, "that appears to have torn it for the
  moment. This delightful apartment doesn't seem to go in for windows, and
  nothing short of a ton of dynamite would break down that door."</p>

  <p>"It is terrible," she moaned. "Terrible. This is, how you say, ze doctor's
  room where he do things to people. And ze walls, no noise go through."</p>

  <p>"Sound-proof, is it," said Standish curtly. "Still, there must be some
  ventilation somewhere. By the way, this isn't your pal, is it, Hugh?"</p>

  <p>"Great Scott! no," said Drummond. "What's the trouble, my dear? Why had
  they lashed you up?"</p>

  <p>"Because I find out things zey do not want me to know. Because I say I
  will tell ze policemen."</p>

  <p>"What sort of things?" cried Drummond eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Zey have ze men captured&mdash;<i>prisonniers</i>. But what does it
  mattaire?" she burst out wildly. "We are <i>prisonniers</i> ourselves. And ze
  big man he is a devil. He will kill us all."</p>

  <p>Drummond patted her on the shoulder reassuringly, and produced his
  revolver.</p>

  <p>"We may have something to say about that," he said. "Now listen,
  mam'selle, do you know who these men are who are prisoners?"</p>

  <p>"No, m'sieur, <i>non</i>. I do not know. One, he is old; the other is of
  your age. But I do not know who zey are."</p>

  <p>"Do you know where they are?"</p>

  <p>"In a big house, m'sieur." She passed her hand over her forehead. "A big
  house... M'sieur, I feel so funny."</p>

  <p>"So do I, by gad!" cried Gregson. "I feel as if I was tight."</p>

  <p>Drummond sat down suddenly in a chair; he was feeling tight, too. He
  looked at Standish, and two Standishes were swaying by the wall. Came the
  sound of a fall behind him, and he tried to turn his head. But he could not,
  and even as he made a last desperate effort the two Standishes collapsed and
  lay still.</p>

  <p>His revolver was still within reach, and he tried to pick it up. But his
  arm would not move: it felt as if it was bound to his side with iron bands.
  He tried one leg: the same result. So he gave it up, and just sat there inert
  and helpless.</p>

  <p>He could think, though sluggishly; he could see, though his vision was
  blurred. And after a while he became aware of a very faint, sweet smell. Gas,
  he thought hazily; some sort of paralysing gas.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he realised that a man was bending over Standish, a man with a
  hood over his head. He was doing something to Standish's hands and feet, and
  just then he found he was being attended to also. And the amazing thing was
  that though he could see his hands being lifted and put together, though he
  could see rope being lashed round them, he could feel absolutely nothing. It
  was as if his whole body had gone to sleep.</p>

  <p>The men disappeared and Drummond lost count of time. Like a drunken man he
  stared at Standish lying motionless on the floor, and wondered dully what had
  happened to the other two. And then, starting in his feet and fingers and
  spreading gradually up his legs and arms, the most agonising pins and needles
  set in. It was the return of feeling, but while it lasted he felt as if he
  was going to burst out of his skin. At length it was over; he found he could
  turn his head. But he also found that his ankles had been lashed to the legs
  of the chair, though he had been totally unaware of the fact.</p>

  <p>"Are you all right, Hugh?"</p>

  <p>Standish was regarding him from the floor.</p>

  <p>"I think so," said Drummond. "How are the others?"</p>

  <p>"I'm O.K.," came Darrell's voice from behind his chair. "But Gregson's
  still a bit woozly. The lady appears to have deserted us."</p>

  <p>"They carted her out," said Standish, "after they'd lashed me up. Boys, we
  deserve kicking. We've fallen head foremost into one of the most palpable
  traps I've ever thought of, and if what that woman said is right and this
  room is soundproof, so far as I can see we're likely to remain in it."</p>

  <p>"Do you think she was a wrong 'un?" said Drummond.</p>

  <p>"I'm thinking it doesn't matter much. Right or wrong, she baited the cage
  all right, and when we suckers were nicely inside they shut the door."</p>

  <p>"Where did the damned stuff come from?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. But there's a ventilator high up in the wall behind you,
  and that's presumably where it's gone. And since the air seems clear now
  there must be some inlet. The point is, what the devil are we going to do?
  Can anybody move?"</p>

  <p>"I can't for one," said Drummond. "What's the time? How long were we
  under?"</p>

  <p>"Ask me another," answered Standish. "I should say about half an hour.
  Look out; the door is opening."</p>

  <p>"Put them in a row," came a deep voice that Drummond instantly recognised
  as Gregoroff's. The man who had driven the car the previous afternoon was
  with him, and the Spaniard, and a moment or two later they were joined by
  Emil Veight.</p>

  <p>"That one," said Gregoroff, pointing to Darrell, "was with Drummond this
  afternoon at the cottage. Who are these other two?"</p>

  <p>"I seem to recognise your face," remarked Veight to Standish. "Who are
  you?"</p>

  <p>"That is a matter of supreme indifference to everyone except myself," said
  Standish casually.</p>

  <p>"Been doing any more shooting, Pansyface?" asked Drummond pleasantly.</p>

  <p>For a second Gregoroff's eyes rested on him; then they passed on.</p>

  <p>"And that fourth one, who doesn't seem to have quite recovered. He wasn't
  with them at the hotel. However, it is of no consequence."</p>

  <p>His glance came back to Drummond.</p>

  <p>"It is strange, is it not, how frequently the simplest traps are the most
  efficacious," he remarked. "Though I must confess I hardly thought I should
  bag four of you. By the way, where is the car you stole from me?"</p>

  <p>"I swapped it for some peppermint bull's-eyes," answered Drummond with a
  grin.</p>

  <p>The other's face remained as mask-like as ever, and he lit a cigarette
  with great deliberation.</p>

  <p>"You are an extremely foolish man, Captain Drummond," he said. "I suppose
  you realise that the four of you are completely in our power."</p>

  <p>"At the moment it looks like it," yawned Drummond.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you further realise that you have been annoying me. And I
  dislike being annoyed. However, since, owing to your unbelievable stupidity,
  you have afforded us a very valuable test on a matter we are interested in,
  we have decided to spare your lives under certain conditions. Last night,
  when you were in your cottage, a stone was thrown through your window.
  Wrapped round that stone was a message. What was that message? Your chances
  of life depend entirely on your giving me the correct answer."</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" said Drummond quietly. "Let us get this matter clear.
  Assuming for the moment that there was a message wrapped round the stone, and
  that I tell you its contents, am I to understand that you will release us and
  that we are free to go?"</p>

  <p>"My dear Captain Drummond," said Gregoroff with a pitying smile, "you
  always seem to judge other people's mentality by your own. You must remember
  that your veracity on the subject of messages is under a definite cloud. No;
  you will not be free to go. You are far too much of a nuisance when you're at
  large. And so you will remain here until we have finished what we came over
  to do in this country. It is for you to decide whether your residence in this
  charming room is for that period or for&mdash;perhaps ever is too strong a
  word, but shall we say for some months or even years? I trust I make myself
  quite clear. If you give me the correct message, I will give you my promise
  to notify the authorities where you are to be found. It may not be for some
  days, but you are four strong men and a little fasting will do you no harm.
  In fact, I should think you ought easily to last a fortnight, and I can
  guarantee to have finished by then. If, on the other hand, you do not give me
  the correct message, I shall not notify the authorities, with results that
  may, I fear, prove most unpleasant for you. In fact, as I said, it may be
  months before you are found. You realise, don't you, that this room is to all
  intents and purposes sound-proof. You further realise that it is impossible
  to open that door without the key or suitable tools. And so you see your
  position."</p>

  <p>"You've overlooked one small point," remarked Drummond. "The people at the
  hotel know we're here."</p>

  <p>"Apart from the fact that if that was the truth you certainly wouldn't
  have mentioned it," said Gregoroff, "do you really think that that affects
  matters? Of course you've been here, Captain Drummond, and you've left. One
  of my minions will specially inquire for you at the Royal, and will mention
  that you left here before midnight. I assure you everything has been thought
  of."</p>

  <p>"And so you propose to stop on in this house while we starve in here,"
  said Drummond.</p>

  <p>"Wrong once more," remarked Gregoroff genially. "When we leave you to-
  night, we lock up the house and go&mdash;elsewhere. So you will be all by
  yourselves."</p>

  <p>"Unpleasant for Meredith when we are found."</p>

  <p>"Why? Unknown to him, you must have returned to the house, and in the
  course of your unjustifiable exploration shut yourselves in here by mistake.
  An accident, a terrible accident and a parallel, my dear fellow, to that
  delightful old tale which I seem to remember. Wasn't it called the 'Mistletoe
  Bough'? About a charming girl playing hide-and-seek who popped into a chest,
  and being unable to open it from the inside, remained there so long that she
  died on the rest of the party."</p>

  <p>"With her feet and hands lashed together!" sneered Drummond.</p>

  <p>"Captain Drummond, you positively pain me. Before we desert you we shall
  unloose one of you, who will then perform the same office for the rest. You
  will be perfectly free to move about; to shout, if you wish to, as much as
  you like. In fact, the only point which you have to decide is the duration of
  your visit. Is it to be for a few days only, in which case the ill-effects
  will not be lasting; or do you propose to be foolish?"</p>

  <p>Drummond stared at him thoughtfully; the situation was only too clear. Of
  the four of them, prisoners in that room, there was only one whose
  disappearance was likely to cause any comment&mdash;Humphrey Gregson. As a
  serving soldier his absence would be noticed very quickly, but even if it
  was, what then? He could be traced as far as the Royal; after that the trail
  vanished. Worse still, if the two undergraduates who had followed them did
  complain to the police, and gave the number of Gregson's car, the trail was
  leading directly away from Hartley Court.</p>

  <p>"I cannot afford to wait all night, Captain Drummond." Gregoroff was
  speaking again. "I will give you another two minutes in which to decide. And
  please be under no delusions. If it was not for the fact that I want to know
  the contents of that message, I should leave you here to starve like the rats
  that you are without the smallest compunction. In case, too, that you have
  hopes in another direction, your two cars will not remain where they are at
  present."</p>

  <p>Still Drummond said nothing: his brain was racing feverishly to try and
  see some loophole of escape. His eyes sought Standish, who shrugged his
  shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Seems to me they've got two to one the better of us, Hugh," he said.</p>

  <p>"An excellent judge of odds," remarked Gregoroff.</p>

  <p>"If I do give you the contents of that message," said Drummond, "what
  guarantee have we got that you'll keep your word?"</p>

  <p>"None," answered Gregoroff calmly. "But, then, you're hardly in a position
  to demand guarantees, are you? You've just got to chance it."</p>

  <p>"Very good," said Drummond after a pause. "I will chance it. And I hope
  for your sake that the contents of the message mean more in your young life
  than they do in mine. For none of us has been able to make head or tail of
  it. It runs as follows: 'Rosemary BJCDOR.'"</p>

  <p>"Where was the message when I searched you?" demanded Veight.</p>

  <p>"Where I found it afterwards: between the two window-sashes."</p>

  <p>"And where is it now?"</p>

  <p>"In my head; I burnt it."</p>

  <p>For a few moments the German and Gregoroff conferred together in low
  tones; then the Russian swung round on Drummond.</p>

  <p>"Rosemary BJCDOR," he repeated. "And you don't know what it means?"</p>

  <p>"I do not," said Drummond. "It is presumably a code of some sort."</p>

  <p>Again the two whispered together, and Drummond glanced at Standish. And
  Standish was studying the Spaniard with a thoughtful look in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"You have no idea who the writer is?" said Gregoroff.</p>

  <p>"Not the slightest," answered Drummond.</p>

  <p>"Why did you cause that fake message to be sent?"</p>

  <p>"My merry disposition," said Drummond calmly. "I don't like you or any of
  your friends, so I thought I'd have a spot of fun at your expense."</p>

  <p>"How many other people know of this message?"</p>

  <p>"So far as I know, only the police at Belmoreton. I told them when I
  reported the death of the wretched bloke who was murdered at the
  cottage."</p>

  <p>Gregoroff turned to the chauffeur.</p>

  <p>"Verify that to-morrow," he said curtly. "And now, Captain Drummond, one
  or two more questions. What do you know of the girl Doris Venables?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing at all, except that she's no beginner at telling the tale."</p>

  <p>"I have no doubt in my own mind, Paul," remarked the German, "that her
  story was the truth. What is of more interest is that I have at last
  remembered who that man is."</p>

  <p>He pointed to Standish.</p>

  <p>"You were in the British War Office on the Intelligence side. Your name is
  Standish. How did you get mixed up in this?"</p>

  <p>"That again is a matter of supreme indifference to everyone except me,"
  answered Standish.</p>

  <p>Emil Veight whispered to the Russian, who gave a low whistle of
  surprise.</p>

  <p>"That puts a different complexion on matters," he remarked. "I thought we
  were only dealing with meddling fools. Are you still at the War Office, Mr.
  Standish?"</p>

  <p>"I am not."</p>

  <p>"But you were there a year ago. Things become clearer. So your attendance
  at that meeting to-night, even if not professional, was at any rate inspired
  by inside knowledge."</p>

  <p>"I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about," said Standish. "I
  attended the meeting of the Key Club at the invitation of Doctor
  Belfage."</p>

  <p>"And then remained in the garden spying with your three friends. What did
  you hear at the meeting that caused you to do that?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," remarked Standish. "We heard a woman scream."</p>

  <p>"Twenty minutes after the meeting was over," said the Russian harshly.
  "You lie, damn you! That scream was the bait to catch you, if you were there.
  And I knew you were there. Why? I'll tell you. Because you wanted to find out
  things that don't concern you."</p>

  <p>"My dear Hugh," drawled Standish, "the man is a veritable genius. How does
  he think of it?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know, old lad," answered Drummond. "Must have some asset, I
  suppose, to make up for his ghastly shooting."</p>

  <p>Gregoroff stared at him in silence. And the utter lack of concern in
  Drummond's face seemed suddenly to madden the Russian.</p>

  <p>"You damned Englishman," he said at length. "And you really imagined you
  could come blundering in on my plans with impunity! Well, you've learned your
  lesson." He turned to the Spaniard. "Cortez, pick up that revolver and search
  them all for guns."</p>

  <p>He waited whilst his order was carried out; then he threw back his head
  and laughed.</p>

  <p>"You fools," he cried. "You unutterable fools! And did you really imagine
  you were going to get away? Here you are, and here you remain till you die.
  You won't be able to expedite matters by shooting yourselves; you'll just die
  the slow, agonising death of starvation. Don't sneer at me, damn you."</p>

  <p>With all his strength he struck Drummond in the mouth.</p>

  <p>"You'll die," he shouted. "And my only regret is that I shall not be here
  to see it."</p>

  <p>The man was beside himself with rage. A strange red light was glowing in
  his eyes, and his teeth were bared in a snarl.</p>

  <p>"And now I am going. I shall leave the light on, so that you may watch one
  another growing weaker and weaker. Untie that one."</p>

  <p>He pointed to Gregson, and the Spaniard cut the ropes that bound him.</p>

  <p>"How long to Horsebridge?" he asked Veight.</p>

  <p>"Two hours," answered the German.</p>

  <p>"Good-bye and good luck." Gregoroff from the door bowed ironically. "I
  fear I've spoilt your beauty somewhat, Captain Drummond, but it will be all
  the same in a fortnight or so. And I owed you one for stealing my car. Not
  quite so chatty as usual? Well, well&mdash;it's quite understandable."</p>

  <p>And with one final mocking laugh the door clanged to behind them.</p>

  <p>"One man and one man only has done that to me before." Drummond broke the
  long silence. "And later I killed him. You'd better unlash us,
  Cabbageface."</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you didn't give him the real message, Hugh," said Darrell.</p>

  <p>"I thought you blokes wouldn't mind, and I was certain the swine would
  have crossed us, anyway."</p>

  <p>Drummond rose and stretched himself.</p>

  <p>"Is there any way out, chaps?"</p>

  <p>"If this room is to all intents sound-proof," answered Darrell quietly,
  "and it must be, or he wouldn't have left us here&mdash;none, so far as I can
  see. It will be days before anyone starts looking for us at all, and then
  they won't dream of trying an empty house. What do you say, Ronald?"</p>

  <p>"That I ought to be dropped into boiling oil," answered Standish. "That my
  brain would shame a louse. Who is A5, Humphrey?"</p>

  <p>"Ginger Lovelace. What's stung you, Ronald?"</p>

  <p>"That Spaniard wasn't a Spaniard, but a Mexican," was his unexpected
  answer.</p>

  <p>The other three stared at him in amazement.</p>

  <p>"What the devil has that got to do with it?" cried Drummond.</p>

  <p>"Only that I've solved the real message," cried Standish savagely.</p>

  <p>He got up and shook his fists in the air.</p>

  <p>"Solved it," he muttered. "And we're helpless. Absolutely helpless."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap9"
     name="chap9">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"I trust that everything is to monsieur's satisfaction?"</p>

  <p>The head waiter bowed obsequiously as an underling replaced the gold-foil
  bottle in the ice bucket. The silver gleamed in the shaded light; a big jar
  of caviare shone like black velvet in the centre of the table. From outside
  came the dull roar of the Strand by night; save for that, no sound disturbed
  the occupant of the suite in the Ritz-Carlton.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Henri. All is excellent as usual. Let my friend be shown up
  the instant he arrives."</p>

  <p>"I will see to it personally, m'sieur."</p>

  <p>With another low bow befitting a man whose wealth was reputed to be
  fabulous, and who, unlike some others of the millionaire variety, dispensed
  largesse freely, Henri marshalled his attendants and left the room, leaving
  the diner alone.</p>

  <p>For a while he ate with the quiet deliberation of a man used to feeding by
  himself&mdash;sparingly and yet with the appreciation of the true epicure.
  Every now and then his eyes rested on the ormolu clock which occupied the
  centre of the mantel-piece. They were strange eyes&mdash;almost repellent.
  Very light blue in colour, they protruded slightly, giving the impression of
  a fish. But what was most noticeable about them was their unwavering stare:
  they never seemed to blink. Hypnotic, frightening, eyes to which it would
  take a bold man to lie; eyes which made women turn away with a shudder; eyes
  which had done more than anything else to make Ivor Kalinsky one of the most
  powerful forces in Europe.</p>

  <p>He finished the caviare, and pouring himself out another glass of
  champagne, he lit a cigarette. He smoked as he had eaten, slowly and with
  deliberation, using an amber holder. And after a time he rose and began to
  pace slowly up and down the room. The clanging bell of a passing fire-engine
  grew to a crescendo and died away in the distance, but he scarcely heard it:
  his mind was engrossed in other matters, for Ivor Kalinsky was confronted
  with the biggest problem of his career. On which side should he tip the
  balance&mdash;for or against another European war?</p>

  <p>To the countless thousands hurrying through the streets of London to their
  favourite cinema it would have seemed fantastic that such a thing could be
  possible. Had they been asked to swallow such a situation even in their most
  hectic melodrama, they would have poured scorn upon the mentality of the
  producer of the film. Governments and politicians made wars&mdash;not one
  lone individual pacing to and fro in a dim-lit sitting-room. Who wanted a
  war, anyway? Hadn't the last one been bad enough?</p>

  <p>For or against! For or against! Ceaselessly his brain was working,
  weighing factor against factor, as coldly and analytically as a chemist
  conducting an experiment. To the moral side of the issue he gave no thought;
  it simply did not enter into his calculations. To him the matter was a game
  of chess, and it was imperative that he should not make a false move.</p>

  <p>He drew back the curtains and stared out over the city. As always, his
  room was high up: he preferred it because of the increased airiness. Below
  him lay the river, grey and sombre, with the reflection of countless lights
  gleaming from the Surrey side. A tug went past drawing some barges down to
  the Pool, and he watched it till it was hidden by Waterloo Bridge. For or
  against! That would not be the only bridge that would have to be
  reconstructed if the answer was "For."</p>

  <p>In the distance signs shone and glittered&mdash;red and white and blue.
  One showed a glass of port being filled and emptied; another extolled a boot
  polish. Red and white and blue: was it symbolical? And in imagination Ivor
  Kalinsky saw another scene. The lights were extinguished, save for beams
  piercing the sky like pencils from different directions. The noise of the
  traffic was stilled; another sound had taken its place, and that came from
  overhead. It was the roar of countless aeroplanes, punctuated every few
  seconds by the crash of bursting bombs. And in the streets mobs of screaming
  men and women rushed frenziedly about, trampling, fighting, mad with terror.
  The tube stations were full&mdash;too full; already people were being
  suffocated to death. And on the platforms below those in front were being
  pushed on to the lines unable to withstand the pressure of those behind.</p>

  <p>Still the bombs came in ever-increasing numbers. Great blinding flashes
  stabbed the night as houses crashed in ruins, and then, utterly inadequate,
  came the staccato crack of bursting shrapnel. The anti-aircraft guns at work,
  manned by the few volunteers who had reached them in time. And suddenly, like
  a flaming meteor, one stricken aeroplane shot downwards through the night. A
  pitiful, ragged cheer, and then it crashed, and the bombs it still carried
  burst in a roar so titanic that the aftermath was silence. The droning above
  died away; the raiders had departed, the shambles were left. And war had not
  yet been declared; only a state of tension existed.</p>

  <p>A knock came at the door, and Ivor Kalinsky turned round, letting the
  curtains swing to behind him.</p>

  <p>"Come," he called, and the head waiter entered.</p>

  <p>"Sir James Portrush," he announced, and a portly man of about fifty came
  in. He was dressed in the conventional morning coat, and he carried his
  top-hat and a dispatch-case.</p>

  <p>"Ah! my dear Mr. Kalinsky," he cried, coming forward with outstretched
  hand. "I am delighted to welcome you once more to our shores. You had a good
  crossing, I trust."</p>

  <p>"One or two air pockets, Sir James," said the financier. "Otherwise quite
  comfortable. You will have a glass of wine with me?"</p>

  <p>Sir James held up a protesting hand.</p>

  <p>"Thank you; I never touch it. My digestion, you know. I have to be
  careful&mdash;very careful."</p>

  <p>"A cup of coffee, then?"</p>

  <p>"Again no. Just a little weak whisky and water before I go to bed is all I
  allow myself."</p>

  <p>"Quite a Spartan diet, Sir James," said Kalinsky with a smile. "That will
  do, thank you, Henri, and see that we are not disturbed under any pretext
  whatever."</p>

  <p>"Very good, m'sieur. I will give the necessary instructions."</p>

  <p>The door closed; the two men were alone. And for a space Kalinsky watched
  his visitor as he settled down. The top-hat was placed carefully on a chair,
  the dispatch-case on the table. Then, with trousers slightly hitched up and
  plump legs crossed, Sir James Portrush beamed on his host from his chair. And
  restraining with an effort a strong desire to say, "Now we're all ready for a
  nice cup of tea and a good gossip," Kalinsky sat down too.</p>

  <p>"I am very glad indeed, Mr. Kalinsky," began Sir James urbanely, "to have
  this opportunity of a chat with you so soon after your arrival. Indeed, the
  Prime Minister himself would have liked to be present, but an extremely
  important measure dealing with the totalisator at greyhound racing tracks is
  occupying all his time at the moment. You cannot perhaps realise the great
  volume of public opinion in this country that is opposed to betting in any
  form, and it is very essential to effect some suitable compromise that will
  prove acceptable to all schools of thought."</p>

  <p>The faintest perceptible smile twitched round his listener's lips, but Sir
  James was busy opening his dispatch-case and it escaped his attention.</p>

  <p>"At the same time, my dear sir," he continued, "you must not imagine for
  one moment that our entire attention is centred on these pressing domestic
  problems to the exclusion of other matters. And we should indeed be foolish
  if we were to blind our eyes to the fact that the temper of Europe at the
  present moment leaves much to be desired: much&mdash;ah&mdash;to be desired.
  You agree with me, Mr. Kalinsky?"</p>

  <p>"I do, Sir James."</p>

  <p>"Good. And though we have, of course, our recognised channels of
  information, and are closely in touch with the whole situation, it struck me
  that a little private and confidential chat with you might help matters
  considerably."</p>

  <p>"You flatter me, Sir James."</p>

  <p>"Not at all, not at all. Your interests are world-wide: you have a finger
  on every important pulse. Now, in brief, what is your view of the situation?
  I need hardly say that any remarks you may care to make will be for the ears
  of my colleagues and myself alone."</p>

  <p>"Since you have done me the honour of asking me my opinion, Sir James, I
  presume you want a candid answer."</p>

  <p>"Naturally, naturally."</p>

  <p>"You do not, for instance, want me to prophesy smooth things, so that,
  with an easy conscience, you can return to your legislation for totalisators
  on greyhound tracks."</p>

  <p>Sir James ignored the veiled sarcasm, though it did not escape him.</p>

  <p>"I am sure that anything you may care to say, Mr. Kalinsky," he remarked
  with quiet dignity, "will be of great value."</p>

  <p>"I doubt it," said the financier quietly, "because the gist of what I have
  to say may be summed up in one question. Why have you gone out of your way to
  make another European war inevitable?"</p>

  <p>Sir James sat up with a jerk.</p>

  <p>"Inevitable!" he stuttered. "Inevitable! My dear sir, we have led the way
  in every disarmament conference that has been held."</p>

  <p>"Which would have been quite admirable if any other country had followed
  you. Unfortunately they haven't. They&mdash;forgive my saying so, Sir
  James&mdash;have merely laughed."</p>

  <p>"What else could we have done? It was essential to follow the trend of
  public opinion in this country."</p>

  <p>"Follow! Surely a novel method of regarding your stewardship."</p>

  <p>"You misunderstand me, Mr. Kalinsky. It is essential that leaders should
  sense the temper of those they are called upon to govern. And I say frankly
  that this country would not stand for another war."</p>

  <p>"I can quite believe you. Which is why, as I said to start with, it makes
  it even more unfortunate that they have brought it on themselves. Sir James,
  let us be perfectly frank. You, to day, are in the invidious position of a
  small boy telling two bigger ones not to fight. And the result in that case
  is that he gets kicked in the seat of his pants by both."</p>

  <p>Ivor Kalinsky lit another cigarette, whilst Sir James fidgeted in his
  chair.</p>

  <p>"Unpleasant," continued the financier, "but you asked for the truth.
  Governments to-day can be divided into three categories: dictators, knaves
  and fools. You have no dictator in England, and... Well, what would be the
  result, Sir James, if I offered you half a million down, here and now, if you
  would pursue some line of action dictated by me?"</p>

  <p>"I should be shocked and horrified, sir."</p>

  <p>"Precisely. But there are many other countries where a man in your
  position would be shocked and horrified if that offer was not made. And so we
  are only left with the third category."</p>

  <p>Sir James flushed angrily.</p>

  <p>"You speak bluntly, Mr. Kalinsky."</p>

  <p>"In God's name, why not?" cried the other, thumping the table. "If you'd
  thought bluntly these last few years this situation would never have arisen.
  England would still have been the deciding factor in Europe. As it is, you
  are negligible. And your funny little men who preach pacifism, though they
  have never heard a shot fired in anger in their lives, flatter themselves
  that they deserve well of their country. No one wants war, Sir James, but the
  only way to prevent it is to take the line you have not taken. To stop two
  strong men fighting you must at least be as strong yourself."</p>

  <p>"Come, come, Mr. Kalinsky, there is such a thing as an alliance."</p>

  <p>"Who would deny it? Let us, however, look on your value as an ally. Your
  army is negligible, and there will be no time in the next war to expand it as
  you did in the last. Your navy is still a magnificent striking force, but, to
  be perfectly frank, what is it going to strike against? A few sea forts;
  another fleet? Who cares? The results in the big scheme of things would be
  negligible. And as a means of defence, out of date. Command of the seas is
  still important, but command of the air is infinitely more so. And there you
  simply fade right out of the picture. Just before you arrived, Sir James, I
  was standing in the window looking out over this great city of yours, and in
  my imagination I heard the drone of an attacking air fleet. I saw the
  holocaust below. It was no trumpery raid such as you experienced in the last
  war, and by which, so it would seem to the onlooker, you still set your
  standard. They were up there by their hundreds and the raid itself was the
  actual declaration of war."</p>

  <p>"Really, Mr. Kalinsky, it sounds like an extract from the alarmist press.
  I can hardly believe that you are serious."</p>

  <p>"My dear Sir James, your countrymen never have believed that anything was
  serious until it actually happened. But in the past you have had time to
  repair your mistake, and somehow or other to muddle through. In the future
  you won't have that time."</p>

  <p>"There certainly wouldn't be much time if what you have described took
  place," agreed Sir James tolerantly. "And should any nation be so
  inconceivably barbaric, I don't see how we could prevent them."</p>

  <p>"By one method and one method only: fear of reprisals. And that
  presupposes <i>existing</i> strength in the air as great if not greater than
  they possess themselves. Which is what you have not got."</p>

  <p>"But what good would such a senseless act do, my dear fellow? If London
  was flattened out no other nation would be a penny the better off. Surely the
  utter futility of war as a road to material gain was amply proved by the last
  one."</p>

  <p>"And you think that lesson has been learned? I envy you your complacency,
  Sir James. Further, if that is your considered opinion, why did you come here
  to-night? Our discussion is purely academic."</p>

  <p>"<i>Touché</i>, Mr. Kalinsky, <i>touché</i>. I admit that I fear the
  lesson has not been learned; and I also admit that we have cut down our
  fighting forces to the nearest minimum. But the country simply would not
  stand any large increase in the estimates."</p>

  <p>The millionaire shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"That, of course, is entirely your affair, Sir James, and one on which it
  would be presumption on my part to express an opinion. If you are right there
  is no more to be said."</p>

  <p>"But surely you agree with me that another war on a large scale would be
  an irreparable disaster to the world?"</p>

  <p>"Possibly; possibly not. Who can tell? Just as there was no criterion to
  judge by before the last war, so there is none to-day. For the next war, Sir
  James, will be as different from 1914 as 1914 was from your war in South
  Africa. But in any event, whether it proves an irreparable disaster or not
  has got no bearing whatever on its coming."</p>

  <p>"You seem to have definitely made up your mind that sooner or later it is
  unavoidable."</p>

  <p>For a while the millionaire did not reply; then he nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I think I may safely say that my mind is made up. Sooner or later
  war is inevitable. And the whole point, Sir James, is whether it is to be
  sooner or later."</p>

  <p>Sir James lay back in his chair with a worried look on his face.</p>

  <p>"I must confess, Mr. Kalinsky," he said at length, "that such a very
  definite opinion coming from a man in your position is most disquieting. But
  surely you and the other big financial interests are against such a
  catastrophe."</p>

  <p>"Certainly. But we are not all-powerful. Whether we like it or whether we
  don't, we can't stop it. The irresistible urge is there. At the moment it is
  under control, but believe me that control is very precarious. One spark, and
  the whole of Europe will be a roaring bonfire. And all that we can do is to
  try and control the direction of the flames."</p>

  <p>"Grave words, Mr. Kalinsky."</p>

  <p>"The situation is grave, Sir James. And England's unpreparedness makes it
  all the graver."</p>

  <p>For a while there was silence in the room, then Sir James rose to his
  feet.</p>

  <p>"I must thank you, Mr. Kalinsky," he said quietly, "for the frank way in
  which you have spoken. Needless to say I shall put your opinions before my
  colleagues. And I can only utter a pious hope that you may be wrong. Is there
  no limit to human madness?"</p>

  <p>"If there is I fear I have not plumbed it," answered the millionaire.
  "Good night, Sir James; I hope to see you again before I leave England."</p>

  <p>The door closed behind his visitor, and Ivor Kalinsky sank back in his
  chair. From many points of view the conversation had been a valuable one: it
  had enabled him to crystallise his own thoughts, though it had still not
  solved his problem. He had said nothing that he did not believe to be the
  truth; and if he had not said everything that he might have, that was nothing
  to do with Sir James. One spark would be enough: it was no business of the
  Englishman if his was the hand that kindled it.</p>

  <p>He got up and once again began to pace restlessly up and down the room.
  Was the time ripe? A hundred different factors had to be weighed in the
  balance; a hundred conflicting interests taken into
  consideration&mdash;interests which overlapped and interlaced in a way that
  made their mutual reactions wellnigh incalculable.</p>

  <p>There came another knock on the door, and his second visitor was ushered
  in. It would have been hard to imagine a greater contrast to the one who had
  just left. The new-comer wore a heavy fur coat, though the evening was warm.
  A silk scarf was wrapped round his neck; an opera hat was on his head. His
  face was swarthy; his dark eyes gleamed with vitality. And his hooked nose
  proclaimed his race.</p>

  <p>"Some more wine," said Kalinsky as the other flung his coat in a chair,
  revealing immaculate evening clothes.</p>

  <p>"I see you're a pillar of society, Morgenstein," he continued with a faint
  smile.</p>

  <p>"I've just come from Covent Garden," said the other. "Carmenita was in
  perfect voice, and I waited to hear the Swan Song."</p>

  <p>Again the smile flickered round Kalinsky's lips.</p>

  <p>"I, too, have been listening to a Swan Song," he remarked. "Sung by the
  excellent Sir James Portrush."</p>

  <p>The Jew eyed him keenly, and then murmured some banality as the waiter
  returned with the champagne.</p>

  <p>"Was he in good voice also?" he asked when they were once more alone.</p>

  <p>"He croaked a little towards the end, when he left me to continue vital
  legislation on greyhounds."</p>

  <p>Kalinsky lifted his glass.</p>

  <p>"Well, Morgenstein, and what conclusion have you come to?"</p>

  <p>"I have not as yet come to any. It is a grave issue, Kalinsky."</p>

  <p>"That was the croak in Sir James's Swan Song. He admits, quite frankly,
  that this country is not prepared for war. Of course that fact is well known
  to both of us. At the same time it is illuminating when a man in his position
  says so openly."</p>

  <p>The Jew lit a cigar before replying.</p>

  <p>"Are they contemplating taking any steps to remedy the state of
  affairs?"</p>

  <p>Kalinsky shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"How can you ever tell with these people? I drew him a picture of the air
  raid of the future carried out before war was declared. He merely smiled. And
  yet the man is uneasy."</p>

  <p>"Are you prepared to put your cards on the table, Kalinsky, and give me
  your views of the situation?"</p>

  <p>"I certainly am. And I can express it in a nutshell. Unless England
  increases her fighting forces, war is absolutely inevitable. Nothing can stop
  it. The point, therefore, that we have to decide is whether we precipitate
  the crisis now, or whether we wait. If we wait, it is possible that this
  country may again become the dominating factor in the situation. If we act
  now, Europe as we know it ceases to exist. Which suits our book best?"</p>

  <p>"Absurd though it may sound, I am still frightened of England," said
  Morgenstein. "She has such an astounding way of pulling her weight at the
  last moment."</p>

  <p>"I think it is far from absurd. More, I may be illogical, but I agree with
  you. And I can assure you that that very point has weighed largely in my
  calculations. Could I but find some method of weakening her still more, or
  alternatively of strengthening others whom we need not name, so that the
  disparity of power was greater, I would not hesitate for one moment."</p>

  <p>"You mean you would favour immediate action."</p>

  <p>"Precisely. Would that suit you?"</p>

  <p>"It would. But is there any possibility of such a thing occurring?"</p>

  <p>"That I shall know more about a little later in the evening. Have you to
  return to your guests, or would you care to remain and hear for
  yourself?"</p>

  <p>"I will certainly remain. You are expecting some fresh information?"</p>

  <p>"I am. What its value will prove to be I cannot say: my correspondent was
  guarded in his letter. But hitherto I have found him a most reliable man.
  Emil Veight is his name."</p>

  <p>"I cannot recall it," said Morgenstein. "A good man, is he?"</p>

  <p>"First class."</p>

  <p>Kalinsky smoked in silence for a time; then he changed the conversation
  abruptly.</p>

  <p>"Have you ever come across a peculiar institution known as the Key
  Club?"</p>

  <p>"I have heard of them," said Morgenstein, looking slightly surprised. "Are
  they to be taken seriously?"</p>

  <p>"They take themselves very seriously indeed. Their principal aim is world
  peace, and the brotherhood of man. And though their aims may be idealistic,
  their methods are severely practical. They consist, in short, of buying
  confidential information on armaments from whoever they can bribe and then
  publishing it broadcast so that all the world shall know. And if you think
  into the matter it is quite an efficacious way of preserving equality between
  nations."</p>

  <p>"You amaze me, Kalinsky. Have they done it often?"</p>

  <p>"On two or three occasions to my certain knowledge quite successfully. And
  it was in connection with them that I first met Veight. On that occasion, I
  fear, they were not quite so successful, though they were very useful to me.
  An Italian, whose name I forget, sold to one of their agents the plans of a
  new submarine, and Veight, by some means, heard of it. He acted with
  commendable promptitude. The Italian and the agent, who was returning to
  England with the plans, were both murdered, and Veight brought the tracings
  to me on the chance of my buying. I did, and they came in very useful."</p>

  <p>"Really! Most interesting. But what exactly has your story got to do with
  the present situation?"</p>

  <p>"That we shall know in a few minutes: Veight said he would be here at
  half-past ten. And since he mentioned the Key Club in his letter, I can only
  conclude that something of the same sort has happened."</p>

  <p>"He is a reliable man?"</p>

  <p>"When it pays him to be. As it does with me. And of one thing I am sure.
  He would not waste my time or his own unless he thought it worth while.
  Whether what he has to tell us is sufficiently worth while is for us to
  decide."</p>

  <p>The sound of voices came from the lobby outside and Kalinsky glanced
  up.</p>

  <p>"The man himself, I think. Good evening, Herr Veight," he said affably as
  the door opened. "You are punctuality itself. You know Herr Morgenstein?"</p>

  <p>"By sight and name only," said Veight with a bow, coming into the room. "I
  trust you are well, m'sieur."</p>

  <p>"Quite, thank you. Waiter&mdash;bring another bottle of wine. Now, Herr
  Veight," he continued, as the man left the room, "I gather from your letter
  that you have something of interest to report. You can speak quite freely in
  front of Herr Morgenstein."</p>

  <p>Once again Veight bowed; then he sat down and lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Am I right in supposing, gentlemen," he said, "that the state of tension
  in Europe is acute?"</p>

  <p>"Let us proceed on that assumption," remarked Kalinsky.</p>

  <p>"Am I further right in supposing," continued Veight, "that confidential
  information on military matters would be particularly valuable to-day?"</p>

  <p>"That would be for us to decide," said Kalinsky curtly.</p>

  <p>"Normally, m'sieur, I would agree. In this case, however, I must have
  something a little more definite. Naturally I am not asking you to pledge
  yourselves blindly in any way. But if I guarantee to deliver to you within
  forty-eight hours, or at the utmost seventy-two, the most closely guarded
  military secrets in England, what will it be worth to me? Let me make myself
  quite clear. You remember, m'sieur, the Giuseppi affair?"</p>

  <p>"Giuseppi! That was the name, Morgenstein. Yes, Veight, I do. I was
  discussing it before you came to-night."</p>

  <p>"Good. Well, each of these secrets, gentlemen, is as valuable as those
  submarine plans."</p>

  <p>The two financiers looked at one another.</p>

  <p>"If that is the case," said Kalinsky after a pause, "I think we would be
  prepared to guarantee you twenty-five thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>Veight shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Not enough, gentlemen," he said decisively. "I have to split with a man
  who has been working with me. The risks we have already run are enormous, and
  the greatest are still to come. Will you make it twenty-five thousand
  each?"</p>

  <p>Again Kalinsky glanced at Morgenstein, who gave a barely perceptible
  nod.</p>

  <p>"All right, Veight," said Kalinsky. "Fifty thousand in all. But we must be
  the judges."</p>

  <p>"Of that I have no fear," said Veight quietly. "You will be satisfied with
  your bargain."</p>

  <p>He paused as the waiter re-entered the room, and there was silence till he
  had finally withdrawn.</p>

  <p>"No fear at all, gentlemen," repeated Veight. "Does Herr Morgenstein know
  anything about the Key Club, m'sieur?"</p>

  <p>"I told him a certain amount when discussing your letter," said
  Kalinsky.</p>

  <p>"Then I will not waste time in explaining that part of it to him. Because,
  I fear, gentlemen, a certain amount of explanation is necessary over what has
  happened already. I will make it as short as I possibly can, but it is
  essential that you should understand the situation.</p>

  <p>"The story starts in Warsaw, two months ago, with a man named
  Gregoroff&mdash;Paul Gregoroff&mdash;as the chief character. The business
  which had taken him there was completed, and as he was sitting in the lounge
  of his hotel after dinner, listening to the band, he became aware of two men
  who were talking English at the next table. One was clearly an Englishman,
  the other was a Pole, and both of them were wearing the badge of the Key
  Club. At first he paid but little attention. Their voices were low; their
  general appearance was consistent with the fatuous imbecility which one
  expects in members of that ridiculous organisation. And then one word caught
  his ear very clearly. That word was 'Gas.'</p>

  <p>"He endeavoured to listen more closely, but as luck would have it the band
  was making such an infernal din that it was quite impossible for him to hear
  what they were saying. But bearing in mind the recent activities of their
  society, he deemed it advisable to make some further inquiries. So he squared
  the police to have the Englishman arrested later on some trumped-up charge
  connected with his passport, but to treat him with the utmost consideration.
  Then, wearing a key himself, he went round to the police station.</p>

  <p>"The young man was, of course, overjoyed to meet a fellow-member; and when
  that fellow-member procured his release on the spot, accompanied by voluble
  expressions of regret from the police, his gratitude knew no bounds. In fact
  within half an hour Gregoroff was in possession of the whole story.</p>

  <p>"It transpired that this youth was by way of being a chemist. And he had
  been acting as assistant to a man in England who for some months past had
  been working on a new form of gas. At first Gregoroff was not greatly
  interested: new gases come and go, each one bringing its own antidote. But
  when he began to realise the properties of this particular gas, matters
  assumed a different aspect.</p>

  <p>"It seemed, then, that this young fellow had been experimented on himself,
  not once but many times, by the man he had been assisting. The gas was
  colourless, odourless, and a fraction lighter than air. It was also
  harmless&mdash;after its effects had worn off. But it was the effect that was
  interesting: complete paralysis of the limbs, absolute inability to move or
  speak, though hazily conscious of what was going on around, and finally loss
  of all feeling. According to the amount administered the duration of this
  condition lasted. The dose could be graded so as to produce effect for ten
  minutes or half an hour. But, and this was the vital fact, you were in the
  grip of the gas before you realised you were. And then it was too late to
  save yourself.</p>

  <p>"I will not insult your intelligence, m'sieur," continued Veight after a
  pause, "by stressing the marvellous possibilities which opened out in front
  of Gregoroff if what this man told him was true. Moreover, since it was
  unlikely that he would have come all the way to Poland merely to tell a
  stupid lie, Gregoroff decided to proceed on the assumption that he was
  speaking the truth. And so, still keeping up the role of an enthusiastic
  member of the Key Club, whose aim was universal peace, he proceeded to pump
  him dry.</p>

  <p>"He discovered that the inventor of this gas was a man called Waldron. He
  was a Territorial officer in the English Royal Engineers, and in addition to
  being a chemist he was also a very keen soldier. It was clear, of course,
  that the military value of this gas was great. It could be used alone, or
  mixed with something else, and in either case its presence would not be
  detected until too late. And Waldron, being a patriotic Englishman, proposed
  to place his discovery so soon as it was perfected at the disposal of the
  British military authorities&mdash;an idea abhorrent to his assistant, though
  that was a fact of which Waldron was naturally unaware.</p>

  <p>"He blathered on about ideals&mdash;their common ideals, since he assumed
  Gregoroff thought as he did. And Gregoroff let him talk, though he hardly
  heard what he said. Because, M'sieur Kalinsky"&mdash;the speaker leaned
  forward in his chair&mdash;"his mind was busy with the potentialities of this
  gas apart from its military value. If it was all that this boy claimed for
  it: if it could be manufactured without too elaborate a plant: if&mdash;well,
  there were many ifs, but the germ of a stupendous idea was there. Imagine the
  position if one was able to render a man powerless in a room in an hotel
  without using force, and without the slightest risk of detection from
  outside. No other gas would do it: it would be smelt in the passage. The same
  objection applied to an anaesthetic such as ether. Here, then, was the
  possibility of the ideal weapon. Do I interest you?"</p>

  <p>"Go on," said Kalinsky quietly.</p>

  <p>"So Gregoroff started on the practical details, and the more he heard the
  better it sounded. It was cheap to make, and was easily compressible in steel
  cylinders. These could be of any size desired, from the massive ones suitable
  for work in war to smaller cylinders which could be moved by hand. Moreover,
  the respirator was not at all complicated, and could be carried unnoticed in
  a man's pocket till it was required. In fact, there was only one hitch. This
  miserable youth did not know the formula. A great deal of the process he was
  conversant with, but there were one or two points of which he was ignorant.
  They were known to Waldron <i>and Waldron only</i>. A definite set-back, as
  you will agree, but it had to be faced. Because by now Gregoroff was fully
  determined to go on with the matter.</p>

  <p>"The first problem was the young man himself. He was, so he told
  Gregoroff, in accordance with their custom, and acting on the orders of one
  of the leaders of England, paving the way for the secret of this gas to
  become world-wide. He was arranging for a Key Club representative from every
  country to come to England in a month or so, by which time he would have the
  full details at his finger-tips, and he would then pass the information on to
  them. Fortunately he had started in the east and was working west through
  Europe, so he'd been caught in good time. He had given Gregoroff Waldron's
  address in England, and therefore there seemed no possible object in his
  continued existence. And so he&mdash;er&mdash;fell in front of an express
  train and passed out of the picture."</p>

  <p>A faint smile flickered round Kalinsky's lips.</p>

  <p>"This Gregoroff of whom you speak: whom is he acting for?"</p>

  <p>"Himself, m'sieur," answered Veight promptly.</p>

  <p>"And is he the man you mentioned at the beginning, with whom you have to
  split?"</p>

  <p>"He is," said Veight, and paused, listening intently. Then like a flash he
  crossed the room and flung open the door.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing here?" he snarled.</p>

  <p>"Tidying up, sare," came the aggrieved voice of a waiter.</p>

  <p>"Then get out, damn you. This place is quite tidy already. My apologies,
  gentlemen," he said, coming back into the room, "but in my work one develops
  a sort of sixth sense. And tidying up can cover a multitude of keyholes."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap10"
     name="chap10">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"Such was the situation," continued Veight as he resumed his
  seat, "when Gregoroff got into touch with me. He did that for two reasons.
  First it struck him that it would probably not be a one-man job; and secondly
  because I have worked in England and knew the ropes far better than he did.
  And the instant I heard what he had to tell me I threw over everything else
  on the spot.</p>

  <p>"The problem that confronted us was obvious; the solution was not. This
  man Waldron was a bachelor, living in a small house on the outskirts of
  Surbiton. He had one old woman servant who did all the work of the house.
  Further&mdash;and this was important&mdash;he was of independent means, and
  did no work beyond his chemical research. If, therefore, it became necessary
  to abduct him, there would be no office from which he would be missed and
  which would start a hue and cry. And it seemed to us, when we discussed the
  matter in Amsterdam, that in all probability abduction would be
  necessary.</p>

  <p>"Our reasoning was as follows. Here was a presumably patriotic Englishman,
  since he was serving in their Territorial army, and a man of sufficient
  wealth to do no work. It was therefore very improbable that we should be able
  to bribe him, especially as he would realise that we were both foreigners.
  Moreover, if we attempted to and failed, it would at once put him on his
  guard. And so we decided that our only chance was this. Study the house,
  study his ways, and at a suitable moment visit him with the definite
  intention of knocking him on the head and removing him to some safe place
  where suasion, moral and otherwise, could be brought to bear on him. Which
  necessitated our finding a suitable <i>pied à terre</i>. An hotel or lodgings
  were obviously out of the question: it had to be a private house.</p>

  <p>"And there I came in. During the course of that little job I did for you,
  m'sieur, I had come across a certain Doctor Belfage. He was an unpleasant
  little specimen, but he was a prominent member of the Key Club. And since
  then I had heard that he had got into trouble and had had his name removed
  from the medical register. But what was important from our point of view was
  that he had a house near Cambridge which was most eminently suitable for our
  purpose. It contained a central room which was practically sound-proof, which
  the doctor used as a laboratory, and which would form an admirable prison for
  this man Waldron should he prove obdurate. That settled, we crossed to
  England by a route not usually taken by passengers, and successfully eluded
  the authorities. Gregoroff, in particular, might have had considerable
  difficulty in landing.</p>

  <p>"The first thing to do was to get in touch with Belfage, and I travelled
  up to Cambridge while Gregoroff lay low in London. And there we got our first
  setback: the doctor had let his house and was living elsewhere. But though I
  didn't say anything at the time, I wondered very much who and what this man
  Meredith, who had taken the house, might be. I was tolerably convinced, shall
  we put it, that he had never been a candidate for Holy orders. However, he
  gave me the doctor's address, and I left him.</p>

  <p>"The doctor, I am afraid," continued Veight, "was not overjoyed at seeing
  me. But on my reminding him of a certain incident in his past he decided it
  would be better to overcome his reluctance and give me some of his valuable
  time. And so we adjourned to his study.</p>

  <p>"'Still a member of the Key Club,' I remarked on seeing the badge in his
  coat. 'I hear you've had a little trouble with the medical authorities,
  Doctor.'</p>

  <p>"'Purely professional,' he assured me. 'What can I do for you, Herr
  Veight?'</p>

  <p>"'I wanted the temporary loan of your other house, Doctor,' I said. 'Who
  is that man Meredith who has it?'</p>

  <p>"A glance at his face told me that I had taped Meredith correctly, and we
  both fenced for a while. Then I took the bull by the horns and told him what
  I wanted.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen, I don't think I have ever seen a man look so completely
  dumbfounded. He positively goggled at me.</p>

  <p>"'Waldron!' he stuttered. 'Waldron! What do you know about Waldron?'</p>

  <p>"'Evidently just what you do,' I said. 'I want the secret of that gas, and
  I'm going to have the secret of that gas. Do we work together or do we not?
  Waldron has got to be made to speak. Are you going to help me, or do I work
  on my own?'</p>

  <p>"'What do you propose to do?' he asked at length.</p>

  <p>"'That, at present, is nothing to do with you,' I answered. 'But this much
  I will tell you. I know his address in Surbiton, and he is going to be put
  through the hoop.'</p>

  <p>"'You propose to abduct him?' he said.</p>

  <p>"'Put it that way if you like,' I remarked.</p>

  <p>"'Then there's mighty little good your going to Surbiton,' said the
  doctor.</p>

  <p>"'Why not?' I cried.</p>

  <p>"'Because you won't find him there. He's been abducted already.'</p>

  <p>"'Well, m'sieur, it was my turn to do a bit of goggling now; it was the
  last remark I'd expected. Somebody had got in in front of us. Who was it? I
  dismissed the possibility of his lying; the matter was so very simple to
  verify. So I let him talk, and it soon became obvious he wanted to get rid of
  me.'</p>

  <p>"'I fear, therefore, there is no good your wasting your time, Herr
  Veight,' was the line he took up.</p>

  <p>"'Don't worry about my time, Doctor,' I said. 'I'll look after that end of
  the business myself. Am I to understand that this man Waldron is being held a
  prisoner by the Key Club?'</p>

  <p>"It took some time for him to answer; in fact, gentlemen, everything to
  start with had to be dragged out of him with a corkscrew. But after a while
  he admitted that that was the case. Waldron had been a captive for more than
  ten days.</p>

  <p>"'In order to make him reveal the formula of his gas, or to prevent him
  making any more?' I asked.</p>

  <p>"'In order to get the formula,' said the doctor. 'There is one step in the
  process known only to him.'</p>

  <p>"'And when you have the formula, what is your next move?' I remarked</p>

  <p>"He hesitated and stammered, and finally stated that the next move would
  be what the rules of the Key Club ordered. The secret would be passed on to
  everyone interested.</p>

  <p>"Well, m'sieur, I knew that was their rule, but I also knew my doctor. He
  had pocketed a wad over the Giuseppi affair, and I couldn't see him in the
  role of an altruist. So I tackled him fair and square.</p>

  <p>"'Are you a liar or are you a fool?' I asked. 'For you must be one or the
  other.'</p>

  <p>"He wasn't offended. As you must have guessed by now, he's a pretty poor
  specimen. So when he found I wasn't going to be bluffed he came out with the
  whole thing. And a very pretty little business it was.</p>

  <p>"By some ruse or other Waldron had been decoyed to the house where he was
  now held prisoner. This house belonged to a man called Hoskins who, the
  doctor informed me, was a genuine Key Club idealist, and a man whom no one
  would suspect for an instant of anything crooked. A telegram had been sent to
  the servant saying that he would be away for a few weeks, and during that
  period the secret was to be extracted. Then Waldron would be free to go.</p>

  <p>"What was going to happen to Mr. Hoskins when Waldron went to the police
  about it was entirely Hoskins's affair. And according to the doctor, Hoskins
  was such a complete fanatic that he wouldn't mind.</p>

  <p>"'And where, my dear Doctor,' I remarked at this juncture, 'do you come
  in? You most certainly are not a complete fanatic, and I can't see you going
  to prison for the doubtful pleasure of passing the secret of this gas on to
  the nations at large. Can it be possible that you are hoping somehow or other
  to get away with the formula yourself and pass it on to <i>one</i>
  nation?'</p>

  <p>"And it was obvious that that was exactly what he had been hoping to do.
  He hadn't made any definite plan, but that was what the little rat had in his
  mind.</p>

  <p>"'Excellent,' I said. 'We now know where we stand. And since this thing is
  much too big for you to handle on your own, think how lucky you are that you
  now have me to help you. Is Waldron at that house of yours near
  Cambridge?'</p>

  <p>"No, he was not. He was at a house called Horsebridge, belonging to
  Hoskins.</p>

  <p>"'What,' I demanded, 'is the exact place in the jigsaw filled by the
  Cambridge house?'</p>

  <p>"It was to act as an alternative prison in case Waldron was traced at
  Horsebridge.</p>

  <p>"Who was Meredith?</p>

  <p>"Meredith was a gentleman with a pretty taste in handwriting, who would
  come in useful if any letters had to be written purporting to come from
  Waldron.</p>

  <p>"Did Hoskins know that he was consorting with a forger, amongst other
  people? Hoskins believed Meredith to be truly repentant, and anxious to do
  his bit in the great cause. 'But where and how,' I persisted, 'do you propose
  to double-cross Hoskins? If Waldron is persuaded to tell his secret there is
  only one possible method of doing so. You've got to murder him.'</p>

  <p>"No; a thousand times&mdash;no. Nothing of the sort. He was quite pained
  at the mere thought.</p>

  <p>"'Then what is your idea?' I cried furiously. 'You're not a half-wit.
  Unless you murder Hoskins, how can you prevent him passing on this
  formula?'</p>

  <p>"He looked everywhere except at me, until I could have struck the little
  devil. And finally I issued an ultimatum. I told him that unless he was
  absolutely frank with me, I would send an anonymous communication to Scotland
  Yard giving the whole thing away. It was bluff, of course; if the miserable
  worm had called it I hadn't a leg to stand on. But he didn't.</p>

  <p>"I wonder, m'sieur, if I might have a glass of that excellent wine. Much
  talking is making me dry. And I am now coming to the <i>bonne bouche</i>.
  Thank you a thousand times."</p>

  <p>Veight drained his glass, and replaced it on the table.</p>

  <p>"The <i>bonne bouche</i>, gentlemen. Doctor Belfage was far from being a
  half-wit. I told you, did I not, that I had two military secrets to sell you.
  You have heard the first; I am now coming to the second. Have you ever heard
  of the Graham Caldwell aeroplane?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Kalinsky. "I have not."</p>

  <p>"Nor had I until that day. And very few people have heard of it at all.
  Working in an almost inaccessible part of the Highlands is a young Scotch
  engineer. He is apparently a genius on aeronautical construction, and he has
  been experimenting on a machine of his own which is as much in advance of any
  existing aeroplane as the present-day car is in advance of the previous type.
  His staff consists of two or three fitters and one trusted mechanic. It is a
  private enterprise without Government support, so there are no troops or
  anything of that sort guarding the place. And it was on this spot in Scotland
  that the doctor really had his eye fixed.</p>

  <p>"The information came from one of the fitters, who was a humble member of
  the Key Club. And if one-half of what this man reported was true, the
  performance of the machine was simply incredible. I am no expert in flying,
  but even I was impressed by what I heard. A few final details still remained
  to be perfected; then the plans of the machine would be complete. And the
  doctor was waiting till that was done before striking.</p>

  <p>"'Does Hoskins know of this?' I asked him.</p>

  <p>"He did not.</p>

  <p>"'What, then,' I said to Belfage, 'is your plan?'</p>

  <p>"It was a simple one. When Waldron had been abducted one small cylinder of
  his gas, and only one, had been found in his laboratory. And this had been
  removed, and was in the house at the moment. The doctor's idea was to wait
  till the plans of the aeroplane were finished, and then go to Scotland with
  the cylinder. The fitter would introduce it into Graham Caldwell's office,
  and while the inventor and his mechanic were powerless, Belfage would steal
  the plans. He would then offer them to the highest bidder. If in addition to
  that he could get away with the secret of the gas as well, so much the
  better. But it was clear that he attached far greater value to the
  former."</p>

  <p>"One moment," said Kalinsky. "Did this man Hoskins not realise that this
  cylinder was in existence? Because if he did, since publicity was all he
  desired, all he had to do was to have the gas analysed by an expert, and
  publish the result."</p>

  <p>"Exactly, m'sieur. That point occurred to me. And that is why Doctor
  Belfage had not mentioned the cylinder at all. He had realised how valuable
  it would be to him with Graham Caldwell, and so, fearing Hoskins would do
  just what you said, he had lain low about it."</p>

  <p>"So, Herr Veight," said Morgenstein, "if I understand you aright, the
  situation when you first came into the matter some&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Four weeks ago."</p>

  <p>"Some four weeks ago, was as follows. Waldron was a prisoner in Hoskins's
  house at Horsebridge, where efforts were being made to compel him to reveal
  the secret of this gas. Unknown to Hoskins this doctor had the secret in his
  possession."</p>

  <p>"He had the cylinder, Herr Morgenstein, but he did not know what the
  contents were."</p>

  <p>"Quite; quite. He had the cylinder, but he could not find out what the
  contents were without wasting them. And once they were wasted they could no
  longer be used against Graham Caldwell."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said Veight.</p>

  <p>"Since, however, the final plans of the aeroplane were not yet finished,
  Doctor Belfage in conjunction presumably with that other man you
  mentioned&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Meredith."</p>

  <p>"Meredith was playing a waiting game, until the time was ripe to strike.
  They would then get the plans of the aeroplane which Hoskins knew nothing
  about; and, if they could&mdash;though that was a secondary matter&mdash;get
  the secret of the gas to themselves."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," repeated Veight. "You have given the situation in a
  nutshell."</p>

  <p>"And what, might I ask, Herr Veight, was your reaction to this little
  scheme?"</p>

  <p>"In the words of the homely English idiom, Herr Morgenstein, it struck me
  that it was money for jam. In fact, beyond playing a waiting game there was
  nothing for Gregoroff and me to do. That the worthy doctor's ideas on who
  lived and died might have to be changed a little, was neither here nor there.
  Also it was advisable for him not to know that he was going to get very
  little out of it himself: it might have damped his ardour. He could not, of
  course, give either Gregoroff or me away to the police, without giving
  himself away at the same time. And so I suggested that he should introduce us
  to the imbecile Hoskins as two fanatical members of the Key Club from abroad,
  and that we should take up our residence either at Horsebridge or his house
  near Cambridge.</p>

  <p>"It was to Horsebridge that we finally went. And a few words about the
  house itself would not be out of place. Originally it must have been the
  fortified keep of some medieval baron. Made of thick stone, it was completely
  surrounded by water, and the only means of communication with the shore was
  by way of a drawbridge. The old dungeons still existed, dank and mildewed,
  though they were shut off from the rest of the house, which was warm and
  modernised. And in these dungeons Mr. Hoskins, the idealist, had confined
  Waldron.</p>

  <p>"Well, gentlemen, it takes a good deal to surprise me, but I must confess
  that that man Hoskins had me guessing. We all know that a fanatic in any
  shape or form is capable of refinements of cruelty which would make a savage
  blush. One has only got to remember the crimes that have been committed in
  the name of religion. But Mr. Hoskins won in a canter.</p>

  <p>"In appearance he looks a most saintly creature. His hair is white; his
  features are ascetic. He walks with a slight stoop, and wears pince-nez. In
  short, he looks like the conventional ideal of a country clergyman.</p>

  <p>"He welcomed us effusively; his gullibility was almost incredible.
  Everything that Belfage told him about us he swallowed; we were brothers with
  him in the great faith.</p>

  <p>"'Stay as long as you like,' he said. 'This creature Waldron is stubborn;
  he refuses to speak. In fact I sometimes think that it may be necessary to
  kill him. Better, far better, that one man should die, rather than thousands
  be murdered by his infamous discovery. I have tried to make him see reason; I
  have explained to him our ideals. But he is stiff-necked; he persists in
  harping on the fact that he is an Englishman, and that his vile gas is for
  England's use and hers only. He even has the audacity to call me a traitor.
  But I do not fear the ultimate result; there is no man yet who has ever
  survived the ordeal. The drug is infallible.'</p>

  <p>"'What are you doing, Mr. Hoskins?' I asked, and even as I spoke a swarthy
  black-haired man entered the room.</p>

  <p>"'Tell them, Cortez,' said Hoskins. 'They are of our order. Tell them of
  the drug that breaks the strongest nerve.'</p>

  <p>"The new-comer stared at us suspiciously; there was nothing gullible about
  him. Then he whispered something in the old man's ear, who shook his head
  vehemently.</p>

  <p>"'No; no,' he cried. 'They are of our order. Tell them.'</p>

  <p>"The man called Cortez shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"'Marijuana,' he said in a surly tone. 'A Mexican drug.'</p>

  <p>"And Gregoroff whistled under his breath."</p>

  <p>Veight paused and lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen," he continued, "it was a new one on me, but not on Gregoroff.
  Known to drug addicts as Mary Jane, its effects are literally terrible. As a
  general rule it is made into cigarettes, but it can also be administered
  subcutaneously. And after a while it reduces a man to such a pitiful
  condition of nerves that he ceases to be a man. He becomes a gibbering wreck,
  scared out of his life by the slightest trifle. His brain refuses to act;
  terror of he knows not what holds him in its grip, until in the end he puts a
  bullet through his brain or else ends up in a lunatic asylum. And this was
  the drug that the saintly Mr. Hoskins was administering daily to Waldron.</p>

  <p>"It was in every way an ideal prison. Hoskins was respected and liked in
  the neighbourhood; save for this one strange streak he was a charming old
  gentleman. And so he was the last man who would incur suspicion should a hue
  and cry be raised for Waldron. At the same time every precaution was taken to
  prevent discovery. The drawbridge was raised every night at sunset, and not
  lowered till the following morning; the tradesmen left their goods in the
  courtyard in front of the house. And so far as we could tell, nobody had an
  inkling of what was occurring. Waldron's relatives, if he had any, were
  evidently not worrying; the faked telegram had kept the servants quiet. Which
  left Gregoroff and I plenty of time to arrange our plans.</p>

  <p>"One thing we soon found out: the Mexican, Cortez, had to be reckoned
  with. He was under no delusions concerning us, and he told us so quite
  candidly. A nuisance, but one that could not be helped, and he is one person
  who will have to be squared when the time comes. But he did not affect our
  scheme, which, in brief, was the same as the doctor's. With one or two small
  additions&mdash;additions we did not pass on to Belfage.</p>

  <p>"We proposed to allow him to get the Graham Caldwell plans when the time
  was ripe, by using his cylinder of gas. We intended to accompany him, and if
  by any unfortunate chance a fire should take place while the men were
  powerless in the office, and after the plans had been removed, it would
  doubtless be attributed to natural causes. In fact we proposed that two fires
  should take place, the other being the hangar containing the machine
  itself."</p>

  <p>"Good," said Kalinsky softly. "Very good. And the worthy doctor?"</p>

  <p>Veight smiled faintly.</p>

  <p>"Would not, I think, be missed. They are dangerous roads, m'sieur, and
  lonely roads in that part of Scotland. No, I think the doctor would not be
  missed. Then having got the plans, we proposed to return to
  Horsebridge&mdash;you remember, do you not, that Hoskins knows nothing about
  the aeroplane&mdash;and obtain the secret of the gas if we had not done so
  already. Such, briefly, was our intention."</p>

  <p>"You speak in the past, Veight," said Kalinsky. "Is it not your intention
  now?"</p>

  <p>For a moment or two Veight hesitated. Up till now he knew he had held his
  listeners; it was vital that he should continue to do so.</p>

  <p>"M'sieur&mdash;I am going to be perfectly frank with you," he remarked.
  "Four days ago a most annoying thing happened. You have, of course,
  appreciated the essential importance of keeping Waldron's presence in
  Horsebridge a secret. Judge then of our dismay when Gregoroff while walking
  in the courtyard one evening suddenly recognised a man who was fiddling about
  with the mechanism of the drawbridge as a British Secret Service man, whom he
  had last seen in Warsaw. He acted at once. He is a man of immense physical
  strength, and the road outside was deserted. So he hit the so-called workman
  over the back of the head with a stick he was carrying; stunned him and
  dragged him into the house. Then we held a council of war.</p>

  <p>"What had happened was unfortunately only too obvious. This man, whose
  name is Lovelace and who is an officer in the English Army, must have spotted
  Gregoroff in Warsaw at the time when he was finding out about the gas.
  Suspecting something, he had followed Gregoroff to England, and by some means
  or other had got on his track again. It seemed to us that Lovelace must have
  lost him to start with, otherwise we should have had the police on our heels
  before. In fact we hoped, and as things have since turned out hoped rightly,
  that we had got him in time. Nothing had so far been passed on. But we were
  confronted with the situation of having a British Secret Service man a
  prisoner in the house. Waldron was on the verge of cracking; and we had
  received information from Scotland that another three days would see the
  plans completed. And then this had come out of the blue.</p>

  <p>"The first thing to decide was what to do with Lovelace. To kill him was
  far too dangerous; besides, Hoskins wouldn't hear of it. Moreover, there was
  no place to keep him prisoner, except the dungeon where Waldron was, which
  again did not suit us. And so we decided to take him to the doctor's other
  house, and put him in the central room there.</p>

  <p>"We waited till it was dark; then, having given him something to keep him
  quiet, I started off by car with a fellow-countryman of mine and another man
  as guards. And on the way we ran into dense fog.</p>

  <p>"Well, gentlemen, I will not weary you with a long story. Suffice it to
  say that Lovelace, having partially recovered from the drug, managed to give
  us the slip while we were creeping along through the mist. I had one shot and
  wounded him, but before we finally caught him again he had succeeded in
  throwing a stone with a message wrapped round it through the lighted window
  of a cottage. And that is what has caused the bother. For the message was
  found by the owner of the cottage, a man of the name of Drummond, who
  proceeded to make an unmitigated nuisance of himself."</p>

  <p>"What was the message?" demanded Kalinsky.</p>

  <p>"Gibberish; complete gibberish," said Veight. "In fact I would not have
  bored you with all this, seeing that everything is quite satisfactorily
  settled now, but for one thing. Drummond, as I say, became most troublesome,
  and collected three other men round him. They knew nothing, but they were
  becoming very inquisitive. And so it was necessary to take steps to stop
  them. They were all armed; they were all tough customers. However, by means
  of a simple ruse they were all four inveigled into the central room in the
  doctor's house. And there we had to waste Waldron's gas on them."</p>

  <p>"Why?" said Morgenstein.</p>

  <p>Veight smiled grimly.</p>

  <p>"Because, gentlemen, from my knowledge of human nature, Drummond is a man
  I would prefer not to talk to if he has the full use of his limbs and a gun
  in his pocket. To a lesser degree the same applies to the other three."</p>

  <p>"Did the gas work?" asked Kalinsky.</p>

  <p>"Marvellously; marvellously. It is all Waldron claims for it.
  But&mdash;there is no more. That is the point."</p>

  <p>"My dear Veight," remarked Kalinsky curtly, "that is not our affair. Why
  do you worry us with these details?"</p>

  <p>"Because, m'sieur," said Veight quietly, "I take it that the plans of the
  Graham Caldwell aeroplane will be more valuable to you if England is not in a
  position to have them redrawn."</p>

  <p>"Well?" snapped Kalinsky.</p>

  <p>"While we still had the gas it would have been possible to ensure that
  result, and make it appear an accident. Now that is out of the question. It
  can only be murder plain and unadorned."</p>

  <p>Kalinsky shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I am not increasing my offer," he said.</p>

  <p>"And I am not asking you to, m'sieur," answered Veight. "But I am asking
  for a certain amount on account. I have a very wholesome regard for the
  English police, and I have no wish whatever to give their hangman a job. I
  must have money to make my plans, and ensure a safe get-away."</p>

  <p>"You say this message was gibberish," said Kalinsky. "What do you mean by
  that? Why should anyone take the trouble to send a meaningless message?"</p>

  <p>"It may have been a code, m'sieur. At any rate we could make nothing of
  it."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not. But what about this man Drummond? He may have solved the
  code."</p>

  <p>Veight smiled grimly.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter much if he has. He and his friends have been prisoners
  for three days in the room I told you of. The house is shut up and empty; the
  room is sound-proof. I fear they may be getting a little hungry, but that
  can't be helped."</p>

  <p>"And where is this secret service man you wounded?"</p>

  <p>"At Horsebridge. He is unconscious, and so can be safely left in one of
  the ordinary bedrooms. I can assure you, gentlemen," continued Veight, "that
  everything is exactly as it was before this regrettable <i>contretemps</i>
  occurred, save that we no longer have the gas to help us. It is therefore for
  you to decide. Do you wish there to be no chance of the plans being
  duplicated?"</p>

  <p>At a sign from Kalinsky, Morgenstein rose, and the two financiers withdrew
  to the window, where they conferred in low tones. And Veight watched them
  anxiously, though his face was expressionless. What were they going to
  say?</p>

  <p>He had told them the exact position of affairs quite truthfully. But he
  knew&mdash;none better&mdash;that men of their type did not advance money on
  mere promises. And yet it was essential that he should have some, if he and
  Gregoroff were going to escape from the country.</p>

  <p>He lit a cigarette to soothe himself: the last three days had been trying
  ones. Present always had been the fear that Drummond and his friends had
  found out about Horsebridge, and had handed the information on before they
  were made prisoners. Then as the time passed and the police still left them
  alone, that fear had gradually died. But the atmosphere remained.</p>

  <p>Doctor Belfage had completely lost his nerve: the Drummond episode had
  finished him. Only a ceaseless application to the bottle had kept him going,
  and even then it had been unsafe to leave him alone for fear that he might
  give everything away in a sudden access of terror. And Cortez had been a
  trouble. And Meredith. In fact the whole gang gathered together at
  Horsebridge had been suffering from suspicionitis. Nobody trusted anybody
  else; the only point on which they all combined was in continuing to fool
  Hoskins. After that the trouble started.</p>

  <p>Meredith, in particular, had been showing his teeth. From the first he had
  resented the appearance of two foreigners, though until the <i>affaire</i>
  Drummond he had not shown it openly. But since then he had taken no pains to
  conceal his belief that Gregoroff and Veight himself were playing a double
  game. Which, in view of the fact that it was perfectly true, had not helped
  matters.</p>

  <p>The girl, too, Doris Venables, had proved a complication. Even now he did
  not know where she came in; it had been necessary to keep her permanently
  under the influence of drugs in her room in Horsebridge to prevent any chance
  of her screaming. And it had all increased the nervous tension. Only Hoskins
  himself seemed impervious to it: he was too occupied torturing Waldron to
  bother about anything else.</p>

  <p>He came out of his reverie; Kalinsky was speaking.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you what we have decided, Veight. You will appreciate that we
  have no means whatever of testing what you have told us. We have to rely
  entirely on your word. At the same time, neither Herr Morgenstein nor I think
  it likely that you would be so very foolish as to waste our time with a
  tissue of falsehoods. So we will assume that everything is as you have
  said."</p>

  <p>Veight bowed; this sounded a promising beginning.</p>

  <p>"That being the case," continued Kalinsky, "the whole problem boils down
  to whether or not you can deliver the goods, and further if the goods, when
  delivered, are what you claim for them. Will five thousand pounds be enough
  for your immediate needs?"</p>

  <p>"Ample, m'sieur," said Veight.</p>

  <p>"Good; you shall have it. And that we will regard as over and above the
  rest of the money, and not as a payment on account."</p>

  <p>"You are generous, gentlemen. I thank you."</p>

  <p>"On receipt by us of the tracings of the aeroplane and the formula of the
  gas you will receive ten thousand pounds out of the fifty we have agreed on.
  When we have satisfied ourselves that they are of real value you will receive
  a further fifteen, making twenty-five thousand in all. Do I make myself
  clear?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly, m'sieur," said Veight slowly.</p>

  <p>"The remaining twenty-five thousand, Veight," continued Kalinsky, "will
  not be handed over until we have indisputable proof that we and we alone hold
  those two secrets. There may be duplicate plans of the aeroplane already in
  existence; the formula of the gas may be known to someone else. If so, the
  removal of the people concerned will not avail much&mdash;but that is your
  affair. If, on the contrary, no duplicates already exist, then the removal of
  the people concerned will solve the question. That again is your affair. So
  my offer can be summed up in short. Five thousand for current expenses; ten
  for the delivery of the goods; fifteen when the goods are proved
  satisfactory, and a final twenty-five when it is proved we have a monopoly.
  Do you agree?"</p>

  <p>"There is one point that occurs to me, m'sieur. Supposing we have a
  partial success. Supposing, for instance, the plans of the aeroplane become
  your monopoly, but the formula of the gas is known elsewhere. What then?"</p>

  <p>"You would receive half. In the case you have mentioned, instead of
  receiving the final twenty-five thousand you would receive twelve and a
  half."</p>

  <p>Veight rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen, I accept. In a case of this sort we have to trust one another.
  You are trusting me to the extent of fifteen thousand pounds; I am trusting
  you for the remaining forty, or whatever may be due. You will be here,
  m'sieur, for some days?"</p>

  <p>"In all probability. If not, you know the permanent address in Paris that
  always finds me."</p>

  <p>"Then I will bid you good night, gentlemen. You will hear from me in the
  course of four days at the outside."</p>

  <p>With a bow he left the room and walked along the corridor towards the
  lift. Taking everything into account, he felt well satisfied with his
  evening's work, and his brain was already busy as to the best means of still
  further lining his own pocket. He shrewdly guessed that the two men he had
  just left were planning war at an early date, and inside information of that
  sort could be profitably used.</p>

  <p>For a few moments he stood outside the swing doors watching young London
  arrive to revel. Mere girls and boys&mdash;happy and care-free, with healthy
  appetites and tireless legs. What would they be thinking in a few months'
  time?</p>

  <p>"<i>Ein wunderschöner Abend, Herr Veight</i>," came a voice from behind
  him.</p>

  <p>He swung round as if he had been shot. Who had spoken to him about the
  evening? But all he saw was a superb being in a gorgeous uniform, surrounded
  by bevies of lovely girls and their attendant swains.</p>

  <p>"A taxi, sir?" said the superb being politely.</p>

  <p>"No," snarled Veight. And then, obeying a sudden impulse, he added: "Did
  you hear anyone speak to me in German?"</p>

  <p>The superb being raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"German, sir? Really. Most peculiar, sir."</p>

  <p>With another snarl Emil Veight turned on his heel and strode into the
  Strand. For though the words were German, the accent had been English.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap11"
     name="chap11">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">He hailed a taxi and gave the name of his hotel. But, try as
  he would, he could not get the incident out of his head. Emil Veight was the
  last person in the world to court publicity, and at the moment he was
  particularly anxious to blush unseen. But the fact remained that someone had
  recognised him as he left the Ritz-Carlton. Who could it have been?</p>

  <p>The police he dismissed as unlikely: no one in the group had looked in the
  slightest degree like a plain-clothes man. A secret service agent was a more
  probable solution: he was pretty well known amongst that fraternity. And, if
  so, it would require no great astuteness on the speaker's part to connect his
  visit with Kalinsky.</p>

  <p>He frowned; the whole thing was annoying, coming as it had on top of his
  very successful interview with the two financiers. He felt justifiably
  aggrieved about it. And then an idea struck him, and he peered cautiously
  through the little window at the back of the taxi.</p>

  <p>His hotel was a quiet one north of the Park, and the street behind him was
  deserted. It was an ideal spot from which to see if he was being followed,
  and he signalled to his driver to stop. But though he waited a full minute no
  one came in sight, and at length he told the man to drive on. Whoever it was
  who had spoken to him was evidently no longer interested. And he began to
  wonder if he had not unduly exaggerated the significance of the incident.</p>

  <p>A fast open car was drawn up outside the hotel, and Veight glanced at it
  in some surprise. From what he had seen of his fellow-guests a hearse would
  have seemed a more suitable vehicle, but the mystery was solved as he entered
  the lounge. Seated in an arm-chair was the gigantic figure of Paul Gregoroff.
  And it was obvious at once that the Russian had something important to
  say.</p>

  <p>"Have you got a sitting-room," he asked, "where we shan't be
  disturbed?"</p>

  <p>"It's perfectly safe here," answered Veight. "No one sits up in this place
  after ten. What's brought you up to London?"</p>

  <p>"Have you seen the evening papers?" cried Gregoroff.</p>

  <p>"I have not."</p>

  <p>"Then read that."</p>

  <p>The Russian pointed to a paragraph and Veight ran his eyes down it. Then
  with a whistle of surprise he read it more closely.</p>

  <p style="text-align:center"><small>COUNTRY HOUSE GUTTED BY FIRE</small><br>
  <small>SCARCITY OF WATER HINDERS FIREMEN</small></p>

  <p style="margin-left:25%; margin-right:25%; text-indent:0">From our Special
  Correspondent. Cambridge.</p>

  <p style="margin-left:25%; margin-right:25%; text-indent:0">Yet another
  country house must be added to the list of those that have recently been
  destroyed by fire. Hartley Court, a largish residence standing in its own
  grounds, about three miles from Cambridge, was completely gutted in the early
  hours of this morning. Two fire brigades which were soon on the spot found
  their efforts hindered by the lack of water due to the recent drought.</p>

  <p style="margin-left:25%; margin-right:25%; text-indent:0">The reason of the
  outbreak is obscure, as the house had been empty for some days. And this fact
  also permitted the flames to get such a hold before they were seen from a
  cottage on the other side of the road that, even had the water supply been
  adequate, but little could have been done. There seems no doubt that
  defective electric wiring, resulting in a short circuit, must have been the
  cause of the trouble.</p>

  <p style="margin-left:25%; margin-right:25%; text-indent:0">Some excitement
  was occasioned by the discovery of human bones in the ruins. But it
  transpired that the owner, Doctor Belfage, had some complete skeletons in his
  laboratory which he used for lecturing purposes."</p>

  <p>Veight put the paper down on the table and lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"How does this affect us?" he remarked thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Up to date it hasn't," said Gregoroff; "but that's not saying that it
  won't. Everything depends on how long the yarn about the skeletons holds
  good."</p>

  <p>"Belfage put that up, did he?"</p>

  <p>"On my instigation. The instant I heard about the fire I realised this
  complication would occur, and it is quite natural for a doctor to have some
  in his house."</p>

  <p>"Why shouldn't it continue to hold good?"</p>

  <p>"However fierce the fire, and I gather it was an absolute inferno, there
  are bound to be some traces left besides the actual skeletons. At least I
  should imagine so."</p>

  <p>"Trapped as they were in that room, it seems possible to me that the
  process would be pretty thorough. However, that is beside the point. Let us
  assume that you are right. What then?"</p>

  <p>"To start with, Meredith will undoubtedly split on us if he finds himself
  in any trouble. Up to date he has kept out of the way, and Belfage has done
  the talking. But once the insurance people come on the scene Meredith will
  have to appear."</p>

  <p>"Even if he does, what is he going to say? Unless he is completely insane
  he must stick to our original story and profess entire ignorance of anybody
  having been left in the house. Burglars who inadvertently shut themselves
  into that room would be a plausible theory."</p>

  <p>"Supposing something is found which identifies the bodies, such as a
  cigarette case?"</p>

  <p>"Once again&mdash;entire ignorance. The house was shut up after the
  meeting of the Key Club&mdash;the tradesmen can confirm that&mdash;and he has
  absolutely no idea what has happened since. And there's one thing you can be
  sure of. Any story they may have written down on paper will have been
  destroyed."</p>

  <p>"There's something in what you say," said Gregoroff slowly. "At the same
  time, I wish it had happened after we were clear away. If Meredith can queer
  our pitch he will."</p>

  <p>"On that point I certainly agree with you," said Veight. "He and that
  damned little quitter of a doctor have got to be watched. To say nothing of
  Cortez. And it's on that very matter that you and I have got to come to a
  decision. I've seen Kalinsky; Morgenstein was with him."</p>

  <p>"Satisfactory?"</p>

  <p>"Very. Five thousand for current expenses; fifty when they handle the
  goods, provided&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Provided what?" said Gregoroff softly as the eyes of the two men met.</p>

  <p>"There is no chance of anyone else handling them."</p>

  <p>"Just as we thought," remarked Gregoroff. "Damn Drummond and his friends!
  That gas would have been invaluable."</p>

  <p>"There's no good worrying about that now," said Veight. "What we have got
  to decide on is a plan of campaign, and it's not going to be too easy."</p>

  <p>He pulled up a chair closer to Gregoroff and lowered his voice, though the
  lounge was quite deserted.</p>

  <p>"Let us first of all eliminate the impossible. What I would have liked to
  have done would have been for you and me to have gone on our own to Scotland
  after the aeroplane plans. But there is no object in discussing that. If we
  attempted it Meredith would communicate anonymously with the police. And I
  know Scotland&mdash;particularly the Highlands. I did some work there in
  1914. Those cursed Scotchmen can spot a foreigner a mile off, and they don't
  like us. It is equally impossible for us to let them go on their own. They
  would either bungle the whole thing and put the inventor on his guard, or
  else they would disappear with the plans. So we've got to go together. Do you
  agree?"</p>

  <p>"I do," said Gregoroff.</p>

  <p>"Let us go a bit farther. Meredith is only after the tracings; we, on the
  other hand, want rather more than that. And the point we have to decide is
  the best method of getting rid of Graham Caldwell and his assistants without
  being suspected ourselves."</p>

  <p>"Meredith and the doctor may have to go too," put in Gregoroff.</p>

  <p>"They may, and nothing would please me more than if they did. But we've
  got to think of ourselves, my friend. You can't get away with things in this
  country as easily as on the Continent. And what I am wondering is this: Would
  it be possible to dispose of Graham Caldwell and his man in such a way that
  Meredith and the rest of his precious brood get run for murder?"</p>

  <p>The Russian stared at him.</p>

  <p>"That's a grand idea if it can be worked," he said at length. "But can
  it?"</p>

  <p>"I believe it can," answered Veight. "Always provided one thing&mdash;that
  we get the two of them to Horsebridge."</p>

  <p>"I don't quite follow you," said Gregoroff.</p>

  <p>"While we had the gas, as I explained to Kalinsky, their death up in
  Scotland could be attributed to accident. As you know, our plan was based on
  that. Now it can't be; at least it wouldn't be safe to rely on it. Now we are
  agreed that they have to be killed, and we are agreed that it is necessary
  for us to go there ourselves. Now you, my dear Gregoroff, are not exactly an
  inconspicuous member of the society, and I have already mentioned that I know
  something about the inhabitants of the district. And since it would be out of
  the question for us to avoid being seen, the result is obvious. With one
  accord they would connect you, and through you, me, with any murder, however
  skilfully it was done. The very loneliness of the place doubles the
  difficulties. Within five minutes of the thing being discovered every
  policeman in Scotland would be on the look-out for us. Which would prove
  singularly awkward when the plans of the machine were found in our
  possession."</p>

  <p>"Very true," admitted Gregoroff.</p>

  <p>"I have therefore come to the definite conclusion that by far our best
  chance of success&mdash;I go further, our only chance of success&mdash;lies
  in getting these two men to Horsebridge."</p>

  <p>"And how the devil do you propose to do that, seeing that it is the one
  thing Belfage and Meredith don't want? Their whole idea is to keep that fool
  Hoskins from knowing anything about the aeroplane."</p>

  <p>"They must be made to want it," said Veight calmly. "And it can be done by
  pointing out to them the vital importance of keeping the airman's mouth shut
  while negotiations for selling the plans are in progress. What does it matter
  if Hoskins does know? I admit that before we used the gas we were not going
  to tell him. But now that is all changed. And, as I say, what does it matter
  if he does know? The only plans will be in our possession. Let the old man
  think what he likes. We can pretend to have copies made for distribution to
  every government. That will keep him quiet. To Meredith we can pretend that
  we are only waiting for Waldron to speak, when both secrets can be sold to
  the highest bidder."</p>

  <p>"And then? What then?"</p>

  <p>Veight leaned even closer to the Russian.</p>

  <p>"Have you ever heard of adrenalin?"</p>

  <p>Gregoroff shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Adrenalin," continued Veight, "is used for asthma. I know, because I
  suffer from it at times myself, and I always carry a supply with me. And it
  has one very strange property. Though quite harmless when taken in the proper
  way, it causes death if it is injected into a vein. Now it will be necessary
  to keep the two airmen under the influence of drugs to prevent them raising a
  disturbance, which will be Belfage's job as usual. And my suggestion is quite
  simple. When we have got what we want we will kill both of them and Waldron
  by giving them an injection of adrenalin. The fact that the doctor is more or
  less permanently drunk is all to the good. He will think he has killed them
  by giving them an overdose of morphia. And then, my dear Gregoroff, we will
  fade rapidly out of the picture, leaving the dear doctor and the rest of the
  crowd to explain away three dead men as best they may."</p>

  <p>"But it is a marvellous scheme!" cried the Russian with genuine
  admiration. "It is sheer genius."</p>

  <p>"I flatter myself," said Veight complacently, "that it has a certain
  merit. Small unforeseen details are, of course, bound to crop up, but we must
  deal with them as they arise. In the main, however, I think the scheme is
  workable."</p>

  <p>"Eminently so," said Gregoroff. "I congratulate you most heartily. There
  is, however, one point that occurs to me. How do you propose to get Graham
  Caldwell and his mechanic to Horsebridge? They will have to be drugged, and
  the sight of two unconscious men in a motor-car travelling through the
  country will be apt to cause some comment."</p>

  <p>Veight rubbed his hands together.</p>

  <p>"Once again, my friend, I think I have solved your difficulty. The
  English, as you know, are a peculiar race, and at this time of year many of
  them are in the habit of attaching to the backs of their cars a
  strange-looking contraption on two wheels called a caravan. In this they tour
  the country, eating tinned foods and living in the height of discomfort. But
  what could be better suited to our purpose? In the first place it supplies a
  <i>raison d'être</i> for our going to the Highlands at all. We are
  tourists&mdash;sight-seeing. In the second place, it supplies an admirable
  hiding-place for our prisoners. There are two bunks, and curtains which can
  be drawn, so that one can drive with absolute safety through the largest
  towns, with both of them inside."</p>

  <p>"Upon my word, Veight, it is a pleasure to work with you," cried
  Gregoroff. "So far as I can see, the scheme is as nearly fool-proof as it is
  possible to make it."</p>

  <p>"Two heads are better than one," said Veight. "If you can see any flaws,
  mention them."</p>

  <p>"How do we do our final get-away?"</p>

  <p>"Private machine and fly," answered Veight without hesitation. "There's an
  aerodrome not twenty miles from Horsebridge. We'll deliver the stuff to
  Kalinsky in Paris."</p>

  <p>"I suppose there is no chance of him double-crossing us?"</p>

  <p>Veight shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"All I can say is that I don't think so. He's too big a man to make it
  worth his while. I certainly have never heard of him letting an agent
  down."</p>

  <p>He got up, rubbing his hands together.</p>

  <p>"Don't fear: he will pay up if we give him the goods. And unless something
  entirely unforeseen occurs we can't fail. Drummond and his damned friends are
  dead; Lovelace is helpless, and the Venables girl..." He paused. "That young
  woman is a bit of an enigma. I can't make out where she fits in."</p>

  <p>Gregoroff laughed coarsely.</p>

  <p>"Not for want of trying, from what I've seen of you," he remarked. "And as
  for that fool Meredith, he eats out of her hand."</p>

  <p>Veight looked at him through narrowed eyes.</p>

  <p>"Don't fall into that error, Gregoroff. I have never been in the habit of
  letting a woman interfere with business. And I repeat, I can't make out where
  she comes in. Ostensibly she is an enthusiastic member of the Key Club. But
  what is she really? Was it, as Meredith maintains, just feminine curiosity
  that sent her back to that cottage? Or is she in their secret service?"</p>

  <p>"In either event it doesn't seem to me to matter much," said the Russian.
  "She's safely under the influence of dope and will remain in that condition
  until we are clear of the country. And after that it doesn't matter a kopeck
  who or what she is. What is far more to the point is what happened at your
  interview this evening. I must be going soon, and so far you've only given me
  the barest details."</p>

  <p>For a few moments Veight was silent; then, sinking his voice, he uttered
  one word&mdash;"War."</p>

  <p>"Did they say so definitely?" cried the other eagerly.</p>

  <p>"My dear Gregoroff," said Veight, "the Kalinskys and Morgensteins of this
  world very rarely say things definitely. But I waited a little before
  actually entering their room, and I heard one or two of their remarks. And
  even had I not done so the thing is obvious. We both know quite enough to
  realise how matters stand in Europe to-day. And the only doubtful point was
  what Kalinsky was going to do about it. To-night's interview has answered
  that question. He means war, and I believe he means it soon. And that is
  where you and I can considerably increase that fifty thousand pounds. We may
  only be small men financially, but when a small man has <i>certain</i> inside
  information he can soon become big."</p>

  <p>The Russian nodded.</p>

  <p>"That is true," he said.</p>

  <p>"Kalinsky is not buying our stuff to frame it. Kalinsky isn't insisting on
  having the monopoly of it for nothing. Kalinsky is playing deep, and it is up
  to us to play his tune. And there's one place I shall not be visiting when
  the music starts&mdash;London. There won't be any preliminary orchestra this
  time. No question of ultimatums expiring in twenty-four hours."</p>

  <p>"Which is what these fool English can't believe," remarked Gregoroff.</p>

  <p>"My friend, they are incredible. With London a mass of smoking ruins, they
  would send an indignant note, saying, 'Play the game, you cads: we weren't
  ready.'"</p>

  <p>Gregoroff laughed.</p>

  <p>"At the same time," continued Veight, "since we are playing for big stakes
  ourselves, I would like to be sure that the counters are full value. I don't
  think there can be a possibility of error, but all the same, I would like to
  see that aeroplane in action. Even if it is not <i>all</i> that has been
  claimed for it, and all that I told Kalinsky it was, we can still sell the
  plans to him. But in the jargon of the people who race over here, we shall
  know the true form of the horse. And that will help us in making our
  bet."</p>

  <p>"I gather they try it out every day," said the Russian.</p>

  <p>"Exactly. And I suggest we see it on its trial flights, before we finally
  destroy it. With my caravan idea it should be easy. We can take our hotel
  with us to within a couple of miles of the place."</p>

  <p>"It's a beautiful idea&mdash;that caravan. But you realise Meredith, and
  probably Cortez as well, will insist on coming with us."</p>

  <p>"Of course. Let 'em. I allowed for that. They can do the dirty work," he
  added with an evil laugh. "If you and I, Gregoroff, are not capable of
  dealing with those two miserable specimens we'll give up the game for
  good."</p>

  <p>He glanced at his watch.</p>

  <p>"I think I'll come back with you to-night to Horsebridge. Not expecting
  you, I had intended to sleep here and go up to-morrow, but there's nothing to
  keep me."</p>

  <p>"Where are you going to get this caravan?" asked Gregoroff, as Veight rang
  the bell.</p>

  <p>"You can get them all over the place. I'll hire one locally. Let me have
  my bill," he continued, as a bleary-eyed youth appeared round the corner.</p>

  <p>"Bill! You can't 'ave no bill. H'everybody 'as gone to bed."</p>

  <p>"Then somebody has to get up, or I shall go without paying it."</p>

  <p>"Ho! you would, would yer? Can't go without paying yer bill. Send for the
  perlice, I will, if yer tries them gaimes wiv me."</p>

  <p>Veight turned to the Russian.</p>

  <p>"In some ways I would like to be in London on the date we have been
  discussing," he remarked softly. "You'll send for the police, will you?" he
  continued to the night porter. "Now I've been here one night. I am still
  alive because I have eaten no food here. I will therefore pay you for two
  nights, as it is so late. How much will that be, <i>Schweinehund</i>?"</p>

  <p>"'Oo are yer calling naimes? Mine's 'Orace."</p>

  <p>He hiccoughed loudly.</p>

  <p>"Pardon! 'Ad tripe for me supper. Comes back on one like, don't it? Two
  quid, yer said. Right oh! Suppose it'll be orl right."</p>

  <p>He pocketed the notes and shuffled off into a noisome recess under the
  stairs, from which there emerged a series of devastating explosions, showing
  that the tripe was still active.</p>

  <p>"'Ere's yer receipt," he said, appearing once more. "Shall I get yer
  bag?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Veight. "All you can do is to get out of sight and hearing. I
  won't be a moment, Gregoroff: I've a few things to put in. I'll join you in
  the car."</p>

  <p>He went upstairs, and the Russian, lighting a cigarette, went down the
  steps into the street. It was past two o'clock, and not a soul was in sight.
  An occasional car flashed past the end of the street along the Bayswater
  Road, and in a neighbouring basement an amatory cat made music. There was no
  moon, but in a couple of hours it would be dawn, and it would take him just
  about that time to reach Horsebridge.</p>

  <p>He got into the car and started the engine. It was a fast machine, though
  a good deal slower than the one stolen by Drummond, and as he thought of that
  episode he cursed under his breath. Even the fact that he had struck the
  damned Englishman in the face, and that the swine had since died in agony,
  was not enough. He would have liked to have murdered him personally.</p>

  <p>Unlike Emil Veight, who only killed as an absolutely last resource, Paul
  Gregoroff gloried in it. Beneath a very thin veneer the man was a merciless
  savage. Human life meant less than nothing to him. Willingly would he have
  done in the four men in Hartley Court with his own hands, had he not been
  dissuaded by the others. In fact his readiness to kill was a constant source
  of anxiety to those with whom he worked. He never seemed to realise that what
  might be done with impunity in Russia was a very different matter in Western
  Europe.</p>

  <p>With an effort he dismissed Drummond from his mind, and concentrated on
  the work ahead. He felt a genuine admiration for Veight's scheme, which he
  readily acknowledged as a masterpiece. Try as he would he could see no flaw
  in it. There were difficulties which he could see, and unforeseen ones which
  would almost certainly arise. But in the main the conception was magnificent.
  Particularly the idea of the caravan. It tickled his sense of humour to think
  that they would be able to stop and ask a policeman which way to take the two
  men they were going to murder. And the adrenalin. Very, very good.</p>

  <p>"My dear Veight," he said as the German flung his bag in the car and sat
  down beside him, "once again I congratulate you. I have been thinking it over
  while I waited for you, and I cannot see any possibility of failure."</p>

  <p>"Nor can I," said Veight. "But I'm glad you confirm my opinion. Yes,
  Gregoroff, my friend, I think we shall be able to retire in the near future.
  How long will it take us to get there?"</p>

  <p>"Two hours. One must admit one point in favour of this country: its roads
  are wonderful."</p>

  <p>Save for an occasional lorry there was no traffic at all. Villages loomed
  up in the glare of the headlights and fell away behind them as the car ate up
  the miles. And gradually over the flat country towards the east the dawn
  began to break.</p>

  <p>There was a coolness in the air. Here and there little patches of ground
  mist lay in the fields, and the smell of damp earth came faintly to their
  nostrils. And suddenly Veight spoke.</p>

  <p>"I remember it like this away back behind the line during the last
  war."</p>

  <p>Gregoroff glanced at him quickly, but did not speak.</p>

  <p>"Strange, isn't it," he continued, "that we two are helping to start
  another. Don't think I'm becoming sentimental," he added with a laugh, "but
  at moments like this one cannot help marvelling at the congenital idiocy of
  mankind."</p>

  <p>"All the better for us," said Gregoroff cynically.</p>

  <p>"Agreed. But one can wonder at a state of affairs even while one profits
  by it."</p>

  <p>"You'll be talking about the happy hours you spent at your mother's knee
  soon," sneered Gregoroff, and Veight frowned. Unscrupulous blackguard though
  he was, there was a streak of the genuine artist in him, which at times
  recoiled with disgust from the crude inhumanity of the Russian. But he said
  no more and they drove on in silence.</p>

  <p>At length, just as they reached the last village before their destination,
  the sun rose. The actual house was about a mile farther on, and soon it came
  in sight, standing in its sheet of reed-fringed water. And with it Veight's
  mood vanished: he was once more the man of action.</p>

  <p>"Let's get it clear now, Gregoroff," he said. "We want a few hours' sleep;
  then we must get down to things. The sooner we get up north the better, so
  we'll have a conference with Meredith as early as possible. He or Belfage
  will have to make arrangements for the caravan, and it will be best not to
  bring it to the house. We don't want old Hoskins to know a minute before it
  is necessary. In fact he needn't know until we actually come back with the
  two men. I will fix up the aeroplane for us; if I can't do it in any other
  way I'll buy one and hire a pilot. I shall say that it is wanted for an
  important business deal, and that it must be ready to start at a moment's
  notice."</p>

  <p>"We, of course, say nothing about Kalinsky," said Gregoroff, as he backed
  the car into the garage.</p>

  <p>"Good God! no. Are you mad? We hint at a possible buyer, to whom we will
  go accompanied by Meredith. And it is vital they should know nothing about
  the aeroplane."</p>

  <p>Gregoroff produced a latch-key as they walked over the drawbridge.</p>

  <p>"I follow," he said. "I wonder if that damned man Waldron has cracked
  yet."</p>

  <p>He opened the door, and they stepped into the hall. In front of them the
  staircase led up to a mullioned window through which the sunlight was
  streaming. In the room to their right the remains of a meal littered the
  table, and Gregoroff entering poured himself out a whisky and soda.</p>

  <p>The house was in complete silence as Veight went up the stairs and he
  paused by the window to look out. The whole expanse of the mere lay in front
  of him, and for a while he stood there staring idly across the water. The
  morning was still: in the undergrowth that stretched down to the edge not a
  leaf stirred. And he was on the point of going on up to his bedroom when he
  stiffened. The top of one of the bushes fringing the water had shaken.</p>

  <p>"Gregoroff," he called softly. "Gregoroff&mdash;come here."</p>

  <p>The Russian joined him.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Watch the bank just beyond the water-logged boat," said Veight, and even
  as he spoke the bush shook again.</p>

  <p>"There's somebody hiding there," he continued softly.</p>

  <p>"It might be an animal," said Gregoroff, but Veight shook his head.</p>

  <p>"The undergrowth is far too dense for a sheep or a cow," he said. "And
  only a big animal would make that bush shake. It is a human being. We must go
  and investigate."</p>

  <p>Silently they let themselves out of the front door and crossed the
  drawbridge. Then they followed the narrow path that skirted the pool. They
  were screened from view, but progress was slow. In places the path petered
  out completely and they had to force their way through brambles, but at
  length Veight, who was leading, held up his hand. They were just abreast of
  the boat.</p>

  <p>They paused, listening intently, but save for the bird chorus they could
  hear nothing. Then very cautiously, a step at a time, they pushed forward.
  Suddenly, with an agitated squawk, a moorhen scuttered across the water, and
  Veight cursed under his breath. Then all its friends followed suit, and the
  possibility of surprise was gone.</p>

  <p>"Come on," said Veight. "Damn those birds."</p>

  <p>He pushed forward rapidly, regardless now of noise, with the Russian just
  behind him.</p>

  <p>"Here's the spot," he cried. "It was just beside that coloured shrub. This
  is the actual bush that was shaking. And," he muttered, gripping Gregoroff's
  arm, "animals don't eat sandwiches."</p>

  <p>On the ground at their feet were the remains of a meal, and they both bent
  down to examine them. Some ham and bread; the core of an apple; a piece of
  paper and some string.</p>

  <p>"The devil take it," said Veight softly. "That apple core hasn't turned
  brown yet, so whoever it is he's only just gone."</p>

  <p>Once again they stood and listened, and this time in the far distance they
  heard the noise of someone crashing through the undergrowth; then
  silence.</p>

  <p>"Who the devil can it have been?" said Veight. "Tramps don't eat that sort
  of sandwich, and a tramp wouldn't have bolted. What's the matter?"</p>

  <p>"Look at the house, man; look at the house," Gregoroff was breathing in
  his ear.</p>

  <p>Through an opening in the bushes Veight looked. Leaning out of a top
  window, staring over the water in their direction, was Doris Venables.</p>

  <p>"The girl, by God!" Veight muttered. "This must be dealt with at
  once."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap12"
     name="chap12">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">To all appearances she was fast asleep when they entered the
  room. The door had been locked as usual with the key on the outside; the
  window was wide open.</p>

  <p>"There's no good shamming, young woman," said Gregoroff harshly. "We know
  you're not asleep."</p>

  <p>There was no answer; only the deep-measured breathing of someone under the
  influence of drugs.</p>

  <p>"If you go on pretending," said Veight, bending over her, "I'll rip the
  bedclothes off. I thought that would do the trick," he added with a short
  laugh, as she made an involuntary movement.</p>

  <p>"Now, Miss Doris Venables, are you going to be sensible or shall we have
  to take drastic measures?"</p>

  <p>"How dare you come into my room!" she cried furiously. "Go at once."</p>

  <p>"Shall we cut out the innocent-virgin stuff?" said Veight calmly. "We are
  in your room and we intend to stay here until you've answered a few
  questions, and answered them to our satisfaction."</p>

  <p>He bent over and stared into her eyes.</p>

  <p>"There's no dope in her at all," he remarked to Gregoroff. "Go and get
  that miserable bungler Belfage, and bring him here."</p>

  <p>"It might be as well, Veight, to question her first. We can get hold of
  him afterwards."</p>

  <p>"All right," agreed the German. "Now, my girl, are you going to stop in
  bed, or would you prefer to put on a dressing-gown and get up?"</p>

  <p>"I'll get up if you'll leave the room."</p>

  <p>"We will avert our gaze, Miss Venables," said Veight ironically. "Is this
  what you want?"</p>

  <p>He picked up a wrap lying on a chair, and tossed it on to the bed.</p>

  <p>"Now hurry, please; we have no time to waste."</p>

  <p>He turned his back, and a moment or two later she spoke.</p>

  <p>"What are these questions you want to ask me?"</p>

  <p>"Good," said Veight. "I am glad you are going to see reason. And
  really&mdash;I must compliment you on your appearance. A most enchanting
  picture."</p>

  <p>"Will you kindly ask your questions and go?" she remarked icily. "I find
  your presence in my room quite insufferable."</p>

  <p>"Then the sooner you answer, and the more truthful those answers are, the
  quicker you will be rid of us. What were you doing at the window a few
  minutes ago?"</p>

  <p>"Looking out. I woke up, and seeing it was a lovely morning I got out of
  bed."</p>

  <p>"Who was the man you were looking for?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you are talking about," she said. "I didn't expect to
  see any man. Why should I? I don't even know where I am."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid, Miss Venables, our visit is going to be a long one. If you
  remember, I laid stress on your answers being truthful. You are not being
  truthful. Who was the man who was hiding in the undergrowth on the other side
  of the lake?"</p>

  <p>"I tell you I didn't even know there was a man there, much less who he
  was."</p>

  <p>"I fear, Gregoroff, that we shall have to adopt other measures with this
  young lady; measures, my dear, that you will not appreciate. For the moment,
  however, we will let that question drop, and turn to another. Ever since I
  have had the pleasure of knowing you, you have posed as an ardent member of
  the Key Club. Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because I am one."</p>

  <p>Veight raised protesting hands.</p>

  <p>"You really must not go on in this stupid way. You are no more a member of
  that fatuous institution than I am. What I want to know is why you pretend to
  be."</p>

  <p>"I tell you I am one," she cried. "You can believe it or not as you
  like."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you'll ask me next to believe that you are a friend of
  Meredith's&mdash;a man with a criminal record, who has served a sentence for
  forgery."</p>

  <p>She gave a slight start.</p>

  <p>"I didn't know that," she said.</p>

  <p>"You do now. Why did you go back to Captain Drummond's cottage that
  afternoon?"</p>

  <p>"To make sure the message telegraphed by Mrs. Eskdale was correct."</p>

  <p>"And why did you want to make sure of that? I am waiting for an answer,
  Miss Venables," he added after a pause.</p>

  <p>"I thought she might have made a mistake."</p>

  <p>"Really! And if she had&mdash;what then? You, with a quickness for which I
  congratulate you, got rid of that man Drummond on the pretext that the
  message was a cipher giving the name of the place where your mythical cousin
  Harold had been taken to. You also, and on one of the few times in our
  acquaintance, quite truthfully told me that you thought it was the address of
  our head-quarters in code. Why did you want that address? Whom did you wish
  to trace there?"</p>

  <p>"I tell you, I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Finding things a little difficult to answer, are we? Should I be very
  wide of the mark, Miss Venables, if I suggested to you that in the hurry of
  the moment you had not taken a copy of that wire, and that when I tore it up
  you couldn't remember the contents? And that that was why you went back to
  the cottage? Thank you, you needn't answer. I see I am right."</p>

  <p>For a while he stared at her thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"I must confess you arouse my curiosity, young woman," he said at length.
  "Are you in the service of the British Government?"</p>

  <p>"I am not," she answered promptly.</p>

  <p>"Then if that is the truth you are playing a lone hand. Once again I ask
  you, why?"</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders indifferently.</p>

  <p>"I have already told you, Herr Veight, that you are quite wrong. I really
  cannot go on repeating myself; it's too boring."</p>

  <p>"So," said Veight softly, and at that moment Doctor Belfage entered the
  room, bringing with him a strong odour of spirits. He had pulled on a dirty
  dressing-gown over his pyjamas, and a two days' growth of stubble adorned his
  chin.</p>

  <p>"Thought I heard voices," he muttered foolishly.</p>

  <p>"You drunken swine," snarled Veight. "You were told to keep this girl
  under the influence of morphia, weren't you? Well, look at her."</p>

  <p>"Gave her a shot last night," stammered the doctor.</p>

  <p>"Shot be damned!" cried Veight furiously. "You were too full of whisky to
  know what you were doing. And what's the result? We found her trying to
  signal to somebody outside. And that's your doing, you miserable fool."</p>

  <p>"Signalling? My God! Whom to?"</p>

  <p>"That's what I'm trying to find out. And that's what I'm going to find
  out. Now look here, my girl, I've had enough of this fooling. You were
  anxious to find out where our head-quarters were. Well, you have. They are
  here. And now you are going to sample what goes on in them. Up to date we
  haven't worried about you; you have been kept quiet. Now, entirely owing to
  that wretched bungler, we have got to worry about you."</p>

  <p>The girl rose to her feet, and faced him fearlessly.</p>

  <p>"How long have I been here, you brute?"</p>

  <p>"Three or four days," answered Veight. "A nice rest cure."</p>

  <p>"And what are you going to do with me?"</p>

  <p>"Apply a little suasion. Show you some of the sights of the house. Unless
  you tell us who that was outside."</p>

  <p>"I tell you I don't know," she cried. "And if I did I wouldn't tell you.
  Don't touch me." Her voice rose. "Don't dare to put your beastly hands on
  me." She backed to the window. "I swear I'll jump out if you do."</p>

  <p>And even as she spoke a sudden change came over her face, and she gave a
  little choking cry.</p>

  <p>"Tommy. Tommy darling. What have they done to you?"</p>

  <p>Standing in the doorway was a man with a chalk-white face. A dirty bandage
  was round his head, and he was swaying dangerously on his feet.</p>

  <p>"Doris," he whispered. "I thought I heard your voice, dearest."</p>

  <p>Heedless of the other three she went to him and flung her arms round his
  neck.</p>

  <p>"You devils!" she cried fiercely, as she led him towards the bed. "Sit
  down, darling. You oughtn't to have got up."</p>

  <p>"Things become a little clearer," said Veight with interest. "I see you
  know Captain Lovelace, shall we say&mdash;fairly intimately."</p>

  <p>"I'm engaged to him," cried the girl defiantly.</p>

  <p>"Most romantic." The German lit a cigarette. "At last we are beginning to
  understand things a little better. So it was to help him that you pretended
  to belong to the Key Club."</p>

  <p>"It was," said the soldier weakly. "And if you've got a spark of decency
  or manhood left in you, you'll let her go."</p>

  <p>"Much more clearly," continued Veight. "That's why you wanted the message:
  you guessed he'd be here. It proves one thing, however, Gregoroff. You got
  Lovelace in time; he has passed on nothing. Tell me," he turned to the
  soldier, "as a mere matter of interest, what you meant by that strange
  message you threw through the window of the cottage. 'Rosemary BJCDOR.' It
  doesn't make sense to me, though of course it's a code."</p>

  <p>Ginger Lovelace stared at him.</p>

  <p>"Rosemary," he muttered. "I don't understand. I..." And suddenly he grew
  silent, and passed his hand over his forehead. "I can't remember... It's all
  a sort of dream..."</p>

  <p>"Poor darling," said the girl, putting her arm round his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter," said Veight. "I only asked out of curiosity."</p>

  <p>"Let him go back to bed," she cried.</p>

  <p>"All in good time, Miss Venables," remarked Veight. "It wasn't I who asked
  him to get up, you must remember. And there are one or two things to be
  decided first."</p>

  <p>"Have you still got that poor devil downstairs?" said Lovelace.</p>

  <p>"We have. He is proving a little stubborn. But it won't be much longer
  now. And the quicker it is the better for you."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"My dear Lovelace, I have no personal animosity to you. I can honestly say
  that I am delighted to see you are well enough to get up, and I hope that you
  and this charming lady will enjoy many years of happiness together. But when
  you insisted on butting into our plans you left us no alternative but to keep
  you quiet. And had you not tried to get away in the fog your head would not
  be so painful now."</p>

  <p>"Cut out all that bunk," said the soldier. "What are you going to do with
  us?"</p>

  <p>"Again render you harmless until we have done what we came to do, and then
  you will both be free to do whatever you like."</p>

  <p>"More dope?"</p>

  <p>"More dope."</p>

  <p>"Can't you let Miss Venables go?"</p>

  <p>"Really, Lovelace, you pain me. Let the girl who is engaged to you go! No,
  no, my dear fellow. You will both remain here as the guests of the estimable
  Mr. Hoskins for a few more days, and then let the marriage bells ring
  out."</p>

  <p>"What the devil is all this about?"</p>

  <p>Meredith had entered the room unperceived.</p>

  <p>"Ask that damned doctor," said Gregoroff savagely. "Let's get on with it,
  Veight. I'm sick of this. Fetch a syringe, Belfage."</p>

  <p>"I don't understand," cried Meredith as the doctor shuffled out of the
  room.</p>

  <p>"That swine is so sodden with drink that he doesn't know if he's coming or
  going," said Veight. "He forgot to give the girl an injection last night, and
  we found her looking out of the window. Now then, Belfage, stick it into his
  arm."</p>

  <p>With shaking fingers the doctor inserted the needle, and a few moments
  later Lovelace fell back on the bed unconscious, while the girl watched them
  with eyes like those of a tigress.</p>

  <p>"You brutes!" she kept on muttering. "You brutes!"</p>

  <p>"Quite so, my dear," said Veight calmly. "It may interest you to know,
  Meredith, that these two are engaged to be married, which accounts for much
  that was obscure. However, we needn't go into that now. As I told you, we
  found her looking out of the window, and there was a man hiding in the
  undergrowth on the other side of the lake."</p>

  <p>"What's that?" Meredith gave a violent start.</p>

  <p>"Miss Venables's explanation up to date has not, I regret to say, entirely
  satisfied me. And so I propose to see if we can't get another. I think that
  the spectacle of our friend downstairs might open her mouth."</p>

  <p>"You say there was a man watching the house?" said Meredith uneasily.</p>

  <p>"There was a man hidden in the bushes," answered Veight, "who bolted when
  he heard us coming, and presumably he wasn't bird's-nesting."</p>

  <p>"My God!" muttered Meredith. "Whom can it have been?"</p>

  <p>"That is what I should like to find out. Come along, young woman, and you
  shall see the effects of another drug we keep in the medicine
  cupboard&mdash;one that is specially suitable for people who won't talk."</p>

  <p>"Where are you taking me to?" she cried, shrinking back.</p>

  <p>"Down below. You were so very anxious to find out where this house was
  that you must really see all over it now you are here. Hurry up," he added
  curtly, "you've wasted too much of my time already."</p>

  <p>He took her roughly by the arm and forced her towards the door.</p>

  <p>"You'll find it rather damp and a little gloomy; but don't be
  afraid&mdash;we shall be with you."</p>

  <p>He half dragged, half carried her across the hall to a heavy door studded
  with nails which was fastened with two bolts.</p>

  <p>"The old dungeons, my dear. Perhaps you have heard of Bonivard in Chillon
  Castle. We have a modern edition for you here."</p>

  <p>He drew back the bolts, and the girl gave a little cry as he opened the
  door. Stone stairs led down into the darkness, and a wave of dank, mildewed
  air came up from below and hit her in the face.</p>

  <p>"After you," said Veight with elaborate politeness, and slowly, a step at
  a time, she went down. Water dripped on her head from the ceiling; the walls
  were wringing wet when her hands touched them. At first she could see
  nothing; but at length the place began to take outline in the dim light that
  filtered through a tiny window high up. A big buttress stuck out from the
  wall on one side, and from behind it came a rustling of straw as if an animal
  was moving about.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she screamed; something had run over her bare foot.</p>

  <p>"Only a rat, Miss Venables," said Veight. "There are several, and they are
  big ones. Who was it who was hiding in the bushes?"</p>

  <p>"I tell you I don't know," she cried wildly. "O God, what's that?"</p>

  <p>A strange moaning noise was coming from the other side of the buttress,
  and Veight led her forward.</p>

  <p>"Our Bonivard," he murmured.</p>

  <p>Lying on the ground was a man who gave a cry of fear when he saw them. She
  could just see his face, his twitching lips, his terrified eyes, and his
  hands plucking aimlessly at the air. And then a chain rattled; he was tied up
  to a ring in the wall.</p>

  <p>"The gentleman after whom you used to ask so glibly," said Veight. "When
  would he give way? Do you remember?"</p>

  <p>"What have you done to him?" she asked through dry lips.</p>

  <p>"They're murdering me," came a choking voice. "I'm going mad."</p>

  <p>"No, no, my dear Waldron. Not murder. The very instant you decide to
  speak, all this will stop."</p>

  <p>"You inhuman devil," cried the girl, and Veight laughed.</p>

  <p>"The funny thing, Miss Venables, is that it isn't me at all. The saintly
  owner of the house is responsible for this. And he, I assure you, is an
  Englishman."</p>

  <p>"That drug; what is that ghastly drug?" moaned the prisoner.</p>

  <p>"Haven't they told you?" asked Veight. "It is not a nice one, Waldron, and
  its result in time will be to send you mad. It is, Miss Venables, a Mexican
  drug called Marijuana. You see before you the result. It instils such fear
  into the mind of the taker that he ceases to be a man. He is mad with terror
  over nothing at all; his brain refuses to function; his will power goes. And
  finally he finishes up in a suicide's grave or a lunatic asylum."</p>

  <p>His eyes were boring into her.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Waldron would like a companion here: another soldier. Who was it who
  was hiding in the bushes?"</p>

  <p>"I tell you I don't know," she cried. "I swear I don't."</p>

  <p>"Still obstinate. I think I had better send for Captain Lovelace."</p>

  <p>"No, no," she moaned. "I beg of you don't. I'm telling you the truth, Herr
  Veight."</p>

  <p>"What is all this?" A deep voice came from behind her. "What are you doing
  here?"</p>

  <p>"You have not yet been introduced to your host, have you, Miss Venables?"
  said Veight. "This is Mr. Hoskins, who is responsible for this."</p>

  <p>"You vile brute," said the girl. "Why are you torturing him?"</p>

  <p>"You to say that!" Hoskins's voice shook with rage. "You who belong to our
  order! Are you not aware that this vile man you see before you has invented a
  new and deadly form of gas for use in war. Until he tells me his formula he
  remains where he is."</p>

  <p>He turned on Waldron.</p>

  <p>"Speak, you wretch, speak. What is your gas? Tell me, that all the world
  may know."</p>

  <p>And somewhere, someone laughed. It came from above their heads, and Veight
  swung round tensely.</p>

  <p>"Who was that?" he muttered. "Who was that who laughed?"</p>

  <p>"Aye! Who was that who laughed?" cried Hoskins. "There are men, Herr
  Veight, in this very house who mock at our ideals; who would, if they could,
  use this man's foul secret for their own ends. I have heard them talking, but
  they do not know me. Now, you devil man, will you speak? Or shall I send for
  another injection?"</p>

  <p>"Send and be damned," said Waldron weakly. "You wretched traitor to your
  country."</p>

  <p>"Country! What is country? It is country that produces war. Go, Veight,
  and get the doctor. Tell him this man will still not speak."</p>

  <p>"All right." Veight's voice came from the direction of the staircase.
  "Keep the girl there till I come back."</p>

  <p>Sick and faint with horror of the thing, she was leaning against the
  buttress. In front of her the wild-eyed old owner of the house was muttering
  to himself fanatically; a few feet away Waldron stirred restlessly on his
  straw. And at that moment a hand touched her shoulder. A scream stillborn
  died on her lips, for a voice was whispering in her ear out of the darkness
  behind her.</p>

  <p>"A friend, Doris. Tell Waldron to <i>pretend</i> to give the formula away,
  and gain time."</p>

  <p>Then silence, and her brain working overtime. Who was it who had spoken,
  and how came he there? What she had said to Veight was the literal truth with
  regard to the man outside. She had awakened in a strange room with the light
  pouring in at the window, and had naturally gone to look out; no one could
  have been more genuinely surprised than she had been at his accusation. But
  now she knew there were men on the watch; knew that someone had actually got
  into the house&mdash;someone who knew her name.</p>

  <p>She pulled herself together: she must act, and act quickly. At any moment
  Veight might return: somehow she must get the message through to Waldron
  before then. And suddenly she saw the way. With a little cry she tottered
  forward and collapsed on the straw as if half fainting. Would the old man
  suspect?</p>

  <p>Close beside her Waldron tossed and turned, but her eyes were fixed on
  Hoskins. And to her unspeakable relief he seemed quite oblivious of her at
  all. He was still pacing up and down talking under his breath, and after a
  while he walked half-way across the room towards the stairs as if impatient
  at the delay. She seized the opportunity.</p>

  <p>"Listen," she whispered urgently. "Can you understand me, Mr.
  Waldron?"</p>

  <p>His movements ceased; he lay very still.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" he muttered.</p>

  <p>"A friend," she said in a low voice. "Help is coming. Pretend to give away
  your secret. Do you understand? <i>Pretend</i>. Say you will. Gain time."</p>

  <p>He made no answer; all she could see was the faint outline of his white,
  twitching face close to her. And then came the sound of footsteps on the
  stairs, and she rose quickly to her feet again. Had she succeeded? Had she
  got the message through into that drug-bemused brain?</p>

  <p>Fearfully she peered over her shoulder into the blackness. Of the man who
  had spoken to her she could see no sign, but she knew he must be there,
  hiding somewhere.</p>

  <p>"I can't go on any more."</p>

  <p>Came Waldron's voice, weak and quavering, and a thrill of triumph ran
  through her. He had understood: he was going to do as she had told him.</p>

  <p>"That accursed drug is torture; it's sending me mad."</p>

  <p>He babbled on incoherently for a little while, while Veight and Belfage
  stood beside Hoskins watching him. And then Gregoroff joined them.</p>

  <p>"Are you going to tell us your secret?" said Veight quietly.</p>

  <p>"Secret! The secret of my gas. God! I must have sleep. My brain is
  going."</p>

  <p>Again he rambled on, and Veight said something in a low tone to Gregoroff,
  whilst the girl watched breathlessly.</p>

  <p>"Listen, Waldron," said Veight, stepping forward on to the straw, "you
  shall have all the sleep you want once you have told us your formula."</p>

  <p>"I can't think," muttered the other. "I tell you, I can't think. I must
  have sleep before I can remember it."</p>

  <p>Once more Veight and Gregoroff whispered together, and it was Hoskins who
  spoke next.</p>

  <p>"If we let you sleep will you tell us afterwards?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I will tell you afterwards. But now I must sleep. It is days since I
  have slept." His voice rose to a scream. "Keep the rats away. For God's
  sake&mdash;keep them away! And the horror in the corner. It is waking
  up."</p>

  <p>Doris Venables felt her scalp beginning to tingle: something big was
  stirring on the far side of the dungeon.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry you don't like the doctor's pets," said Veight. "That is only
  a baboon, but he can be very nasty if he slips his collar. Speak now. You can
  remember, Waldron."</p>

  <p>But the only answer was a vague babbling, from which the one word sleep
  continually emerged.</p>

  <p>"It is better perhaps to let him sleep," came the soft voice of Cortez who
  had joined the group. "Marijuana acts this way sometimes. But if when he
  wakes he does not then speak, he shall sleep for good. How say you, Señor
  Hoskins?"</p>

  <p>"I will speak when I wake," said Waldron brokenly. "Only take me from this
  awful place."</p>

  <p>"Give him a shot, Doctor," cried Veight. "We must chance it. And now,
  young woman, we must decide about you."</p>

  <p>The girl shrank back. Subconsciously she watched Belfage bending over the
  man on the ground with a hypodermic syringe in his hand; hazily she wondered
  if the unknown man would again come to her out of the darkness. And then
  suddenly she realised that something had happened to distract their attention
  from her.</p>

  <p>Meredith had appeared, and he was talking excitedly to Veight and
  Gregoroff. His voice was low, and she could not hear what he said, but it was
  evidently news of importance.</p>

  <p>"Good." She heard Veight's curt voice. "We will see this man at once.
  There is no time to be lost. Belfage&mdash;attend to the girl. And if you
  mess things up again, I'll smash you into pulp, you drunken brute."</p>

  <p>She saw the doctor lurching towards her, and gave a little cry of terror.
  Surely the unknown would help her; surely... A hand was clapped over her
  mouth; she felt the prick of a needle in her arm.</p>

  <p>"Carry her upstairs, Gregoroff. We must get down to this at once."</p>

  <p>She felt herself being picked up by the huge Russian; realised she was
  passing through the hall where a strange man was standing. Then wave after
  wave of sleep and oblivion.</p>

  <p>"She'll do," said Veight, who had followed her upstairs. "Now mind you
  don't say the wrong thing, Gregoroff."</p>

  <p>The two men went down into the hall, where Meredith was talking to the
  stranger, while Hoskins with a puzzled look on his face stood by
  listening.</p>

  <p>"It is ferry important that you should come as soon as may be convenient,"
  the stranger was saying in the soft voice of the Highlander. "The plans are
  finished, but for how long Mr. Graham iss intending to remain I cannot tell
  you."</p>

  <p>"What plans?" cried Hoskins. "I don't understand."</p>

  <p>"The plans of the Graham Caldwell aeroplane," explained the stranger in
  some surprise. "Surely you haf heard of it."</p>

  <p>"It's this way, Mr. Hoskins," put in Veight. "We had been intending to
  keep this as a surprise for you, but this man&mdash;by the way, what's your
  name?"</p>

  <p>"MacDonald. Angus MacDonald."</p>

  <p>"But now that MacDonald has come&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You will pardon me&mdash;Mr. MacDonald," said the Highlander.</p>

  <p>Veight bowed ironically.</p>

  <p>"Now that <i>Mister</i> MacDonald has come we can keep it as a surprise no
  longer. Up in the heart of the Highlands, Mr. Hoskins, a man named Graham
  Caldwell has been experimenting with an aeroplane of his own invention. It is
  now perfected, and as an instrument of war it constitutes the most deadly
  advance in flying the world has yet seen."</p>

  <p>"That iss so," agreed the Highlander.</p>

  <p>"It was our intention to give you the plans of this machine as an
  unexpected present." He winked surreptitiously at Meredith. "Now, I fear,
  they will be like the birthday present of more mature years that one chooses
  for oneself."</p>

  <p>"How are you going to get them?" asked Hoskins.</p>

  <p>"That will be ferry simple," said MacDonald. "My cousin, who iss a member
  of the Key Club, will be there on the spot to help you."</p>

  <p>"What is the name of your cousin?" asked Meredith.</p>

  <p>"The ferry same as myself."</p>

  <p>"But the man we have been corresponding with is called MacPherson."</p>

  <p>"Mister MacPherson is there as well. He too iss a cousin."</p>

  <p>"So there are two members of the Key Club there," said Veight.</p>

  <p>"That iss so."</p>

  <p>"And what are you going to do?"</p>

  <p>"I am continuing my journey to London, where I am a student in the
  University. I haf been on my holiday in the Highlands."</p>

  <p>"How did you know of this house?" cried Meredith suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"My cousins told me. I do not know how they knew. And now if you will
  allow me I will be getting along. I am not a member of the Key Club myself,
  but I am in sympathy with its wonderful ideals. I wish you all success,
  gentlemen; it iss a ferry great honour to haf been even such a humble help in
  such a worthy cause."</p>

  <p>He bowed, and a few moments later the roar of a motor bicycle outside
  announced his departure.</p>

  <p>"How the devil did they know of this house?" repeated Meredith. "That sot
  Belfage, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"Don't let's worry our heads over that," cried Veight. "Once those plans
  are in the hands of the British Government we're done. That is to say, Mr.
  Hoskins," he corrected himself hastily, "it is going to be very much harder
  to get hold of them. So there's not a moment to be lost."</p>

  <p>"You are right," cried Hoskins. "What is your idea?"</p>

  <p>"I suggest that Meredith, Gregoroff and I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Cortez is coming too," remarked Meredith quietly, his eyes fixed on
  Veight.</p>

  <p>"As you please," said Veight. "I suggest then that the four of us should
  go at once by car to the north of Scotland and obtain the plans by force if
  necessary. You and Belfage, Mr. Hoskins, will remain here and obtain from
  Waldron his secret when he wakes."</p>

  <p>"Good," said Hoskins. "I agree. I will go and talk to the doctor now."</p>

  <p>"And what do you <i>really</i> propose, Mr. Veight?" sneered Meredith as
  the old man went upstairs.</p>

  <p>"Just what I said&mdash;with one exception. Those plans are going to be of
  twice the value to us if we can keep Graham Caldwell's mouth shut while we
  sell them."</p>

  <p>"How do you suggest doing that?" said Meredith softly.</p>

  <p>"By bringing him and his mechanic here."</p>

  <p>"Here!"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;here. Doped, in a caravan."</p>

  <p>Meredith stared at him, and then whistled under his breath.</p>

  <p>"By God! that's an idea," he said. "In a caravan."</p>

  <p>"When we've got 'em here we can foist off any yarn on the old fool. He'll
  look after them, leaving us free to sell in the best market. We'll stop in
  York or some big place on the way through and hire the machine."</p>

  <p>"I'm on," cried Meredith. "And I'll vouch for Cortez. When do we
  start?"</p>

  <p>"At once," said Veight.</p>

  <p>"I'll get him. But don't forget one thing, Veight: no funny stuff."</p>

  <p>"How the hell can there be any funny stuff, you damned fool? We're all in
  it together, aren't we? I'm not asking you to walk, am I? You're yellow,
  Meredith: plain yellow. Go and get Cortez. If we drive in turn we should be
  there by dark to-night even with the caravan. We'll have to fix the aeroplane
  for ourselves when we come back," he said to Gregoroff, as Meredith
  disappeared scowling. "And if ever I get that scum where he ought to be," he
  added softly, "may the Lord have mercy on his soul."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap13"
     name="chap13">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">For mile after mile the road stretches like a white ribbon
  over the high ground that lies between Lairg and Altnaharra. It is a narrow
  road with passing places every few hundred yards, and save for the inn at
  Crask no house exists. Occasionally a fisherman going north to Tongue passes
  in his car and is gone; once a day the mail van performs its allotted
  task.</p>

  <p>On each side of the road the ground is flat and green. Tiny streams
  intersect it, making big patches of bog. But parts of it are hard and even:
  suitable for the landing of an aeroplane. And it was on such a spot that
  there stood two buildings and a tent. The buildings were obviously
  improvised. One was a small tin shanty and it was erected close to the tent.
  The other was much larger and had been placed some two hundred yards away.
  Beside the tent a dilapidated motorcar was standing, and a rough track
  leading to the road a quarter of a mile away showed how it had got there. On
  the front seat an Aberdeen drowsed peacefully, save for a periodical search
  for an elusive flea. But except for the dog there was no sign of life in the
  little encampment.</p>

  <p>In the short northern night though it was well after ten it was still
  light enough to read. But the man who lay motionless on the small hill that
  rose half-way between the tent and the road was otherwise occupied. His eye
  was glued to a telescope, and the telescope was focused on the place, five
  miles away, where the road going south to Lairg dipped over the horizon and
  disappeared.</p>

  <p>After a while he shifted his position to ease his stiffness, and glancing
  round he frowned. Black clouds were gathering over Ben Kilbreck, and rain
  would not improve his vigil. Not only would it increase his discomfort, but
  it would decrease the visibility during the half-hour of light that still
  remained.</p>

  <p>For two hours nothing had passed. Save for the harsh call of a grouse, and
  the faint murmur of the coffee-brown stream that gurgled softly over the
  stones by the bridge under the road, no sound had broken the stillness. But
  the man, being a Highlander born and bred, was used to such conditions. He
  was in his element, though it would have made a townsman fidget.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he gave a little grunt of satisfaction: coming over the rise was
  a motor-car towing a caravan. His watch was over, and shutting the telescope
  with a snap he rose to his feet. Then, with a final glance at the tent and
  huts, he walked slowly down to the bridge on the road.</p>

  <p>It would be at least ten minutes before the car could get there, and he
  lit a cigarette, his features showing clearly in the light of the match. And
  to a student of physiognomy his face was an interesting one. His eyes were
  very blue, with the network of tiny wrinkles round them which mark an
  open-air life. But their expression betokened the thinker, and the firm mouth
  and chin denoted the man of purpose as well. No dreamer, this, even if he was
  an idealist.</p>

  <p>At last the lights of the car&mdash;for by now darkness had
  fallen&mdash;breasted the rise a few hundred yards away, and throwing away
  his cigarette the man stepped into the road. It was possible, though not
  likely, that this was not the car he was waiting for, but that risk had to be
  taken. It proved groundless. With a grinding of brakes the machine pulled up
  and a voice hailed him.</p>

  <p>"Is that you, MacPherson?"</p>

  <p>"Aye," he answered laconically. "'Tis himself."</p>

  <p>"Your proof?"</p>

  <p>MacPherson fingered the lapel of his coat.</p>

  <p>"The badge of the Key Club," he said. "Any further proof you may be
  needing you'll find in the camp. And who may you be?" he continued as the man
  who had accosted him came into the light. "Are you Doctor Belfage? I was told
  he was a little man."</p>

  <p>"My name is Meredith," said the other, "and I and my friends are acting
  for Doctor Belfage, who is ill. We are all enthusiasts for the cause. By the
  way, MacPherson, how was it your cousin found us at Horsebridge?"</p>

  <p>"Because I told him. Your doctor who is sick said you were there. Come,
  let's be getting on with it. And I'll thank you to give me a lift as far
  south as Inverness."</p>

  <p>He led the way along the path, and a muttered colloquy took place behind
  him.</p>

  <p>"That will be all right," said Meredith at length. "We will take you to
  Inverness. Have you the two men safe?"</p>

  <p>"You'll be seeing for yourself in a minute," answered MacPherson.</p>

  <p>"Because," continued Meredith softly, "you had better remember we are all
  armed. In case, you know, Mr. MacPherson; just in case."</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" said MacPherson quietly. "The grouse are good this year, but
  it is not yet the twelfth."</p>

  <p>"What the devil is the man talking about?" came a harsh voice. "And why is
  he dressed like a damned woman?"</p>

  <p>"Shut up, Gregoroff, you fool," snapped Veight. "Haven't you ever seen a
  kilt before?"</p>

  <p>"Probably not," said MacPherson affably. "Being true to our principles, he
  naturally did not wait to see them during the last war."</p>

  <p>From behind came a chuckle, and Gregoroff snarled angrily.</p>

  <p>"If you laugh at me, you filthy little Dago, I'll bash your head in."</p>

  <p>"I did not laugh," said Cortez venomously. "Keep your hands from me," he
  screamed, "or I knife you!"</p>

  <p>"I didn't touch you, you rat."</p>

  <p>"Then who did? Something&mdash;it brush my face."</p>

  <p>"It would seem, Mr. Meredith, that your friends do not like the spirits of
  the moor," remarked MacPherson gravely. "Perhaps they are right. Strange
  things happen in my country. Maybe you will hear the death dirge if you are
  lucky&mdash;or unlucky."</p>

  <p>"For God's sake let's hurry," said Meredith uneasily. "This place gets on
  my nerves."</p>

  <p>"It is because you are not used to it," answered MacPherson. "But reassure
  yourself. We shall not be long now. The hut is just in front of us. If you
  will wait a moment I will light the lamp."</p>

  <p>He opened the door and struck a match, while the four men crowded in after
  him.</p>

  <p>"There is the inventor, Mr. Graham Caldwell, and that is his
  mechanic."</p>

  <p>Seated on opposite sides of the table and breathing stertorously were the
  two men. Their heads were sunk on their arms; between them stood an empty
  whisky bottle.</p>

  <p>"I put a little something in their whisky," explained MacPherson
  calmly.</p>

  <p>"Good!" cried Meredith. "Where are the plans?"</p>

  <p>"In yonder cupboard," said MacPherson.</p>

  <p>"And they are complete?"</p>

  <p>"They were finished yesterday."</p>

  <p>"You are certain there are no others in existence?" cried Veight, putting
  the tracings on the table in front of him.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely certain," answered MacPherson. "I myself have drawn the
  greater part."</p>

  <p>The four men looked at him.</p>

  <p>"Could you redraw them?" asked Gregoroff.</p>

  <p>"From memory? No, I could not. But why should I be wanting to? You have
  them, and shortly the whole world will have them."</p>

  <p>He spoke indifferently, leaning against the window.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, Veight," said Meredith suddenly. "Not all of them in your
  pocket, if you don't mind. I will take half."</p>

  <p>"Don't be such a suspicious fool," cried Veight angrily. "Anyone would
  think I was trying to double-cross you."</p>

  <p>"Exactly what I do think," answered Meredith calmly. "Hand 'em over."</p>

  <p>"Just so," said Cortez. "We will have half."</p>

  <p>For a few moments there was a tense silence which was broken at last by
  the Scotchman.</p>

  <p>"Are you not then all together in this?" he asked mildly. "What does it
  matter who has the plans?"</p>

  <p>"Of course, of course," said Meredith hurriedly. "Just a little personal
  matter, Mr. MacPherson. Mr. Veight is wanting all the credit himself at head-
  quarters&mdash;aren't you, Veight?"</p>

  <p>"Here are two sheets," remarked the German, pushing them over the table.
  "And what the devil is the matter with you?" he continued to MacPherson.</p>

  <p>For the Highlander, his hand outstretched, was pointing through the
  window.</p>

  <p>"Look!" he whispered. "Look! The dancing light. The light of death!"</p>

  <p>Flickering up and down, moving first this way and then that, was a faint
  blue-white light.</p>

  <p>"It's only a marsh flame," cried Gregoroff harshly, but he crossed
  himself.</p>

  <p>"There is no marsh there," said MacPherson sombrely. "It is the light of
  death. Soon you will hear the dirge."</p>

  <p>"Don't talk rot," shouted Veight. "Are we children, to be frightened with
  such tales?"</p>

  <p>The Scotchman turned and stared at him: stared at him till the German
  shifted uneasily on his feet.</p>

  <p>"You poor ignorant man," said MacPherson slowly. "Do not mock at the
  Powers on the other side, or maybe," his voice rose, "they will strike you
  down. Do ye not ken that this moor is peopled with the dead&mdash;the dead
  who are earth-bound? Listen." He held up his hand for silence. "What did I
  tell you?"</p>

  <p>From far away, clear through the still night air, came a faint wailing
  noise. It rose and fell, sometimes dying away to nothing, then increasing in
  volume, but always the same wailing dirge.</p>

  <p>"Bagpipes," muttered Meredith through dry lips.</p>

  <p>"Aye&mdash;the pipes. But played by no human piper. It's the dead playing
  their own lament. Never have I heard it so clearly."</p>

  <p>"Dead men or no dead men," said Veight angrily, "we're not going till
  we've done what we came for. The machine must be burned. Where is it?"</p>

  <p>"Over yonder," said MacPherson. "The petrol is ready."</p>

  <p>"Then lead the way. That foul noise has stopped; let's be quick before it
  starts again."</p>

  <p>"You will not hear it again to-night," said MacPherson. "They never play
  twice. Follow me."</p>

  <p>They trooped out after him, leaving the two unconscious men still snoring
  at the table.</p>

  <p>"What a hell spot of a place," muttered Gregoroff, stumbling over the
  uneven ground. "How far is it to the shed?"</p>

  <p>"Two hundred yards," answered MacPherson from in front, and even as he
  spoke a bellow of fear came from the Russian.</p>

  <p>"God Almighty!" he yelled. "What was that? Something cold and clammy hit
  my face."</p>

  <p>He thrashed his arms round his head like a madman, uttering the foulest
  imprecations.</p>

  <p>"Blaspheme not," came the quiet voice of the Scotchman, "or maybe they
  that hear will take you at your word. Here is the shed; the aeroplane is
  inside."</p>

  <p>A door creaked in the darkness, and then by the light of a match they
  could see the vague outline of the machine inside.</p>

  <p>"The tins of petrol are against the wall," said MacPherson. "Pour two or
  three over the wings and fuselage. Tip the remainder on the floor, and let
  this invention of the devil be destroyed by the fire that purifieth."</p>

  <p>"I would have liked to have seen it in action," said Veight, "but
  unfortunately that is impossible. The inventor is satisfied, is he?"</p>

  <p>"More than satisfied," answered MacPherson. "There is no existing
  aeroplane that comes within thirty per cent. of it for all-round
  performance."</p>

  <p>The reek of petrol filled the air as they emptied the spirit over the
  machine, and a few minutes later the shed was a raging furnace.</p>

  <p>"So may all such abominations perish," said MacPherson gravely as they
  watched the flames roaring up in the darkness. Fantastic shadows danced over
  the moor, and a heavy cloud of smoke drifted sluggishly away. But at length
  it was over; the blaze died down, and only a few smouldering embers remained
  of the Graham Caldwell aeroplane.</p>

  <p>"Excellent!" cried Veight. "You have deserved well of the cause, Mr.
  MacPherson, and we will see that your name is brought before
  headquarters."</p>

  <p>They were walking back to the hut, where they could see the inventor and
  his mechanic still sprawling over the table. But even with the light from the
  window the darkness seemed the more intense after the fierce bonfire they had
  witnessed. And so, when there came from behind them a thud, followed by a
  bellow of pain and a hideous gurgling noise, they peered backward, unable to
  see what was happening.</p>

  <p>"Murder!" The word was a gurgle. "He murder me."</p>

  <p>"You little devil, Cortez!" Gregoroff's voice was animal in its fury. "Ah-
  h-h! You'd knife me, would you?"</p>

  <p>"Stop it, you two," shouted Veight furiously.</p>

  <p>"I tell you he's smashed my face in," roared the Russian, "and now he's
  stabbed me."</p>

  <p>"I did not touch your face," screamed Cortez. "I touch you not at
  all."</p>

  <p>"For men of peace," murmured MacPherson, "you would seem a little
  excitable. And indeed it appears that Mr. Gregoroff has not only a knife in
  his arm, but that he has lost much of his beauty."</p>

  <p>He had produced an electric torch, which he flashed upon the Russian. And
  in all conscience Paul Gregoroff was a parlous object. His nose was smashed
  and blood was streaming down his face. A knife still quivered in the upper
  part of his arm, and his teeth were bared like those of a snarling dog. He
  had let go of the Mexican, who, crouching vindictively, was watching him.</p>

  <p>"Who did hit me?" mouthed the Russian.</p>

  <p>"Not me," snarled Cortez. "I knife you, yes, because you throttle me. I
  never touch your dam' face."</p>

  <p>"Somebody has," said MacPherson profoundly. "That could not occur on its
  own. Maybe it was one of the more dangerous earth-bound spirits that haunt
  the moor as I have told you. It would be safer to come to the hut, I
  think."</p>

  <p>"To hell with you and your earth-bound spirits," roared the Russian, who
  was beside himself with pain and rage. "If it wasn't Cortez, it must have
  been you, Meredith."</p>

  <p>"I was nowhere near you," cried that gentleman hurriedly. "Let's get
  inside the hut, away from the damned moor."</p>

  <p>"Sensibly spoken, Mr. Meredith," said MacPherson. "For though Mr.
  Gregoroff's face is doubtless very painful, it is fortunate for him that he
  is still alive. It is certain that there is present an influence that does
  not like him: next time it may be his neck and not his nose that is
  broken."</p>

  <p>He entered the hut and the others followed.</p>

  <p>"Do you really mean to say," stammered the Russian, "that ... that it was
  a ghost?"</p>

  <p>The deep-seated superstition of the Slav was asserting itself, and
  MacPherson shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"You may call it a ghost if you wish," he said. "I would prefer to say
  that it was one of the elemental forces that are abroad upon the moor this
  night. You have seen the light; you have heard the pipes: and you have
  escaped with your life. As I said, you are lucky.... What will you be doing
  with the two yonder?"</p>

  <p>"Well, Mr. MacPherson," said Veight, "our idea was to take them south with
  us. We feel it will be safer to have them under restraint while the actual
  plans are being prepared for the various governments. That is the reason for
  the caravan."</p>

  <p>"A grand idea," remarked MacPherson. "They should travel comfortably
  inside it. So if you would care to lift them into the car outside, I will
  drive them to the road."</p>

  <p>"How will you explain their absence?" said Meredith suddenly.</p>

  <p>"There is no one to explain it to," answered MacPherson. "But should any
  questions be asked I shall say they have gone south to the English and more
  than that I do not know. Dear me! and what is that?"</p>

  <p>A sharp yell of pain had come from outside the hut, and Veight entered,
  wringing his hand.</p>

  <p>"Something has bitten me," he cried angrily. "Something in your car."</p>

  <p>"There, now! I'd forgotten her. It's the wee Aberdeen bitch. She does not
  take kindly to strangers. Winkie! Come here, lassie."</p>

  <p>The little dog came trotting in, to receive a vicious kick from the
  infuriated German. And the next moment Veight was lying in the corner nursing
  his jaw, with a blazing-eyed man in a kilt standing over him whom he almost
  failed to recognise as the mild-mannered MacPherson.</p>

  <p>"How dared ye kick my dog?" The voice was soft and incredibly menacing.
  "How dared ye?"</p>

  <p>Veight scrambled to his feet, but a second look at the Scotchman's face
  was enough.</p>

  <p>"Sorry," he mumbled. "Lost my temper, I'm afraid."</p>

  <p>"Then be careful you don't lose it again," continued the soft voice. "Or
  maybe I might lose mine."</p>

  <p>For a space the two men stared at one another; then the German turned
  away, and MacPherson, picking up his dog, made much of her. But though he
  said no more there was tension in the air. Four to one, and armed at that,
  but no one suggested that the Scotchman should help to lift the two bodies
  into the car.</p>

  <p>Gregoroff had roughly bandaged his arm&mdash;the wound was only a flesh
  one&mdash;but his face was still an appalling sight. And just before they
  started MacPherson turned to him.</p>

  <p>"You'll find water in the basin," he said. "I'd use it if I were you. And
  then we'll be moving."</p>

  <p>"What about your car?" asked Meredith.</p>

  <p>"It can bide here," answered MacPherson shortly. "I'll be out by the mail
  from Lairg to-morrow."</p>

  <p>He turned out the light, and they jolted over the track to the road. And
  once again MacPherson was a spectator as they turned the caravan and put the
  unconscious men inside, where they were joined by Meredith and the Russian,
  who heaved a sigh of relief as the door shut behind him.</p>

  <p>"Will you sit in front with me, Mr. MacPherson?" said Veight as he took
  the wheel.</p>

  <p>"I will not," answered MacPherson promptly. "There are some people I
  prefer to be behind, and yon little Dago with the knife is one of them. Come,
  girl."</p>

  <p>The Aberdeen jumped in beside him, and they started off. A few spots of
  rain began to fall, but it was only a passing shower and they did not stop to
  put up the hood. But as a drive it was not a chatty one, and it was not until
  the car stopped on the bridge at Inverness and MacPherson got out that Veight
  spoke again.</p>

  <p>"What was it really that hit Gregoroff?" he said.</p>

  <p>The Scotchman looked at him with an expressionless face.</p>

  <p>"Something verra hard, mon," he remarked, relapsing into a pronounced
  accent. "If it were not impossible I would say a croquet mallet. But I have
  never heard that the elementals play the game. Well, I will say good night,
  Mr. Veight. You have the plans; you have the inventor and his mechanic, and
  your friend's nose should have recovered in a year or so. Heel, Winkie."</p>

  <p>He strode away along the deserted road by the river, and after watching
  him for a while Veight let in his clutch and once more headed south.
  Perfectly correct: they had the plans and the men, there was no doubt on that
  score. But for all that a vague feeling of disquietude possessed him.</p>

  <p>True the Scotch are a peculiar race, and a Scotchman who was also a member
  of the Key Club could not be expected to be anything but most eccentric. But
  the episode which stood out most in his mind, apart from the pain he still
  felt in his jaw, was the kicking of the dog. In an instant a man who up till
  then had seemed an inoffensive lunatic had become a dominant personality.</p>

  <p>That the aggravation had been great he admitted. Not that he cared the
  snap of a finger about dogs himself, but other people did. And if MacPherson
  had merely shown anger or resentment he would not have been in the least
  surprised. But MacPherson had done far more than that: he had cowed Veight,
  which was an extremely novel experience for the German. And the question he
  was asking himself as they drove up the long hill out of Inverness was, which
  was the real MacPherson?</p>

  <p>Of only academic interest, perhaps, but Veight was a keen psychologist.
  Men and their minds were supremely important factors in his profession, and
  he disliked being unable to classify one. And what was it really that had hit
  Gregoroff?</p>

  <p>He believed the little rat beside him, for the very good reason that he
  would never have been such a fool as to attack a man twice his size except
  with a knife. It certainly had not been MacPherson: he had been with him well
  in front. Equally certain it was not an elemental spirit, though&mdash;and
  this was the point&mdash;it was possible that MacPherson really believed it
  was. Highlanders, he knew, were fey: it was quite conceivable that he
  genuinely thought the whole thing was supernatural. Ridiculous, of course, to
  a man like Veight: the light was obviously a will-of-the-wisp, the wailing
  noise some bird.</p>

  <p>It left, therefore, only Meredith. What would have been more easy than for
  him to arm himself with some heavy piece of wood when they were burning the
  aeroplane, and attempt to kill, or at any rate stun the Russian in the
  darkness? It might have been done almost noiselessly, in which case he would
  have been up against Cortez and Meredith by himself, without realising the
  fact.</p>

  <p>A glint came into his eyes: the more he thought of it the more probable
  did this solution seem. And after a while he glanced sideways at his
  companion, whose head was nodding. Both sides could play at that game, and
  with infinite care he put his left hand over the back of the seat and felt
  for the jack which he knew was lying on the floor. He found it, and put it
  between his legs. If the thing was going to be done it would have to be done
  at once.</p>

  <p>Dawn was breaking, and again he glanced at Cortez, who was lolling against
  the side of the car fast asleep. Then he lifted the jack, and brought it down
  on the base of his skull. The Mexican lurched forward and was still.</p>

  <p>Veight still drove on, but fear was clutching him. He had not intended to
  kill the man; had he hit him too hard? He felt for his heart: there was no
  sign of movement. And Veight's own began to go in sickening thumps. Cortez
  was dead: he had murdered him.</p>

  <p>Behind him the caravan bumped along, and instinctively he looked at his
  petrol gauge. It was only a quarter full, and he could not fill up with a
  dead man beside him. Why had he hit him so hard? He had only meant to stun
  him, and then do the same to Meredith. After which he intended to leave them
  both hidden somewhere off the road. But he had killed him.</p>

  <p>Veight thought furiously; the one essential thing was not to lose his
  head. And gradually he grew calmer. A plan was beginning to materialise in
  his mind.</p>

  <p>It would require nerve, but he realised all too clearly that this was no
  time for half-measures. He had not the faintest wish to be hanged by the neck
  till he was dead, and that was the finish that stared him inexorably in the
  face unless he could dispose of the body in such a way as to divert suspicion
  from himself. And to do that it would not be sufficient merely to hide it:
  sooner or later someone would be bound to find it. After which
  identification, and with MacPherson in the neighbourhood the certainty of his
  being implicated.</p>

  <p>The same consideration precluded any possibility of pretending to stage a
  motor accident. Apart from the fact that a car does not hit a man on the
  head, his connection with Cortez would be bound to come out. And why should
  someone who started as a passenger in a car be knocked down by it?</p>

  <p>No: there was only one thing to be done. And having made up his mind
  Veight felt all his customary coolness returning. It was an unfortunate
  complication, but it was not the first time he had been in a tight corner and
  got away with it.</p>

  <p>The first essential was a suitable place, and here fortune was with him.
  The road was running through a fair-sized wood, and as far as he could see
  there was no house within sight. So he stopped the car and putting on a glove
  he took the revolver out of the dead man's pocket. Then he picked up the jack
  and went to the door of the caravan.</p>

  <p>"Puncture," he said briefly, keeping the revolver out of sight. "Give me a
  hand, Meredith; here's the jack."</p>

  <p>Blinking his eyes sleepily, Meredith took it, and as he did so Veight shot
  him from point-blank range through the heart.</p>

  <p>"What the devil are you doing?" stammered Gregoroff. "Are you mad?"</p>

  <p>Veight looked up and down the road: no sign of anyone. Inside the caravan
  the two drugged men still slumbered peacefully.</p>

  <p>"Listen, Gregoroff," he said quietly. "I've had an accident. I meant to
  knock Cortez on the head and stun him. Unfortunately I hit him too hard and
  killed him. You've got to help me stage this show, or we're for it."</p>

  <p>"You mean you are, you damned fool," answered the Russian.</p>

  <p>"You seem to forget the man you killed in Drummond's cottage, my friend.
  Be quick; there's no time to lose. Get hold of his shoulders, and we'll cart
  him into the wood. His hand has tightened on the jack, which is what I hoped
  for, and he's hardly bled at all."</p>

  <p>Between them they lifted the dead man out of the caravan, and carried him
  into the undergrowth for a distance of about thirty yards. Then they laid him
  down where he was screened from anyone passing by.</p>

  <p>"Now, Cortez," cried Veight, and they made the second journey. "We'll
  leave the two bodies together, and with luck they won't be found for days.
  But if by chance they are found sooner, and we are implicated, our story is
  this. We all stopped here and those two began quarrelling. We got bored and
  left them, and know nothing of the affair at all."</p>

  <p>"Pretty thin," said Gregoroff, watching Veight lay the revolver in the
  Mexican's hand.</p>

  <p>"We shan't be in England when they're found," cried Veight. "And with that
  jack clutched in Meredith's hand it isn't by any means so thin as you
  think."</p>

  <p>"What induced you to hit Cortez?" cried the Russian curiously.</p>

  <p>"Because the more I think of it the more do I become convinced that it was
  Meredith who hit you, and that if he'd laid you out he and Cortez would then
  have gone for me," said Veight, taking a final look at the bodies. "That
  seems all right to me," he continued. "The two things took place practically
  simultaneously. Meredith hit Cortez from behind; Cortez spun round and shot
  him as he died. No finger-prints on the gun except any that Cortez may have
  left there himself. In fact, my dear Paul&mdash;well staged. Now all we want
  are the plans from Meredith's pocket, and we will resume our journey."</p>

  <p>He stooped over and extracted the papers, and the two walked back to the
  road.</p>

  <p>"I think," he went on, "that you had better still continue in the caravan.
  Your face is definitely noticeable. Put another quarter grain of morphia
  under both our passengers' tongues. We don't want any chance of them coming
  to and shouting."</p>

  <p>Suddenly he glanced up, listening: in the distance could be heard the
  drone of an aeroplane. It grew rapidly louder, and, flying low over the
  trees, a scarlet monoplane came into sight. It roared overhead, and as it
  passed above them they saw a man leaning out and looking down. Then it was
  gone and the noise of the engine died away in the south.</p>

  <p>"An early flyer," said Gregoroff uneasily. "And he's seen us."</p>

  <p>"What does that matter?" cried Veight irritably. "Your nerves seem pretty
  rocky this morning, Gregoroff. There's nothing unusual, is there, about a
  caravan on a road? And it is ten to one he'll never give it a second thought,
  even when the bodies are found. Get inside; the sooner we're back at
  Horsebridge the better."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap14"
     name="chap14">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">During the long drive south Veight reviewed the situation
  from every angle, for, though he had denied it to Gregoroff, he realised that
  the whole thing was pretty thin. True it was the best that could have been
  done under the circumstances, but he saw only too clearly the dangers of the
  position if the bodies were found before he was out of the country.</p>

  <p>Meredith was known to the police, and through him the line would lead
  direct to Belfage. And with the ex-doctor in his present condition of nerves
  that might mean anything. He would certainly blurt out that Veight had been
  up to Scotland with the caravan, and that would mean a searching
  interrogation by the police.</p>

  <p>Why had Meredith gone into the wood with a jack in his hand? Why, if he
  and Cortez had quarrelled, had they not done so by the roadside? What had
  they quarrelled about? And finally, what had been the object of the whole
  journey? Why go up to the Highlands and return the next day?</p>

  <p>To the first three questions the answer was simple: since the tragedy had
  taken place after the car had gone, he could plead complete ignorance. Why
  had the car gone on, leaving two of its occupants stranded by the roadside?
  That was a bit of a poser. Because he, the driver, was the only one in the
  car. The others had all been in the caravan, and he had driven off believing
  they were inside again. When later he found they were not, he had gone too
  far to turn back, and assumed they would come on by train. That held water,
  and Gregoroff would come in there. He had thought they were in the car, and
  so he had said nothing.</p>

  <p>So far, so good; it was to the last question that, try as he would, he
  could not evolve a satisfactory answer. To pretend that an ex-convict, a dope
  peddler and two men like Gregoroff and himself had gone to Scotland in a
  caravan for fun or to see the view was too farcical for words. In addition to
  that there was MacPherson to take into account. The fact that his own part in
  the performance was not at all creditable might not be enough to prevent him
  speaking if he found out whom the dead men were&mdash;which he certainly
  would, since their names were bound to appear in the papers. That risk,
  however, being outside Veight's control, would have to be ignored. But what
  was he personally to say to account for the trip? And the more he thought it
  over, the more did he come to the conclusion that a half-truth was the only
  possible solution. They had heard of the Graham Caldwell aeroplane, and they
  had gone up to see it. Unfortunately they found the inventor had left for
  England; and even more unfortunately the machine had accidentally caught fire
  while they were there.</p>

  <p>Yes, reflected Veight, that was the only solution, <i>if</i> he was
  interrogated. If! The whole crux lay in that word. With any luck, as he had
  said to Gregoroff, the bodies would not be found for at any rate two or three
  days. And by that time he would be well away, even if it entailed forfeiting
  the secret of the gas.</p>

  <p>Like most men who live by their wits, Veight was an optimist, and as the
  day wore on his spirits rose. Possibly the Cortez episode was the best thing
  that could have happened. He had realised all along that fooling them at the
  last moment was going to prove difficult, and now all need for that had
  disappeared. Belfage and old Hoskins would be child's play, but Meredith had
  had a nasty suspicious mind. And so, by the time he turned the car in over
  the drawbridge, Emil Veight's equanimity was fully restored. His story was
  cut and dried; Gregoroff was word perfect, and he felt that the first
  instalment of Kalinsky's money was already as good as in his pocket.</p>

  <p>There was no one in the hall when he and Gregoroff carried the airman and
  his mechanic in, and the house seemed very silent. But as they laid them down
  on the floor Hoskins appeared from his study brandishing a paper.</p>

  <p>"It is you, is it?" he said. "I thought it might be Belfage. The formula,
  my friends: the formula of that devil Waldron's gas."</p>

  <p>"Excellent," cried Veight. "And here are Graham Caldwell and his mechanic,
  to say nothing of the plans of the machine."</p>

  <p>"A great day, gentlemen: a triumph for the club. But tell me&mdash;where
  are Meredith and Cortez?"</p>

  <p>Veight laughed.</p>

  <p>"A most absurd thing has happened, Mr. Hoskins. We all got out this
  morning just after it was light, and when we drove off again we left them
  behind by mistake. I thought they were in the caravan with Gregoroff, and he
  thought they were in the car with me. They will doubtless come along by
  train."</p>

  <p>"Dear me!" said Hoskins, "how very unfortunate. But what have you been
  doing to your face, Mr. Gregoroff?"</p>

  <p>"I fell down on the moor up there and hit it on a rock," answered the
  Russian.</p>

  <p>"Quite a chapter of accidents," cried the old man. "I wish the doctor
  would return. I want him to see this formula, so as to be quite sure there is
  no mistake. Then by to-night's post, my dear friends, it shall go to every
  government."</p>

  <p>"Just so," said Veight quietly, and his eyes met Gregoroff's. "Just so,
  Mr. Hoskins. Where is the doctor?"</p>

  <p>"He went over to his own house after lunch. Something to do with the
  insurance people and Hartley Court. But he should be back at any moment
  now."</p>

  <p>"Might I see the formula?" asked Veight casually.</p>

  <p>"Of course. Here it is. Waldron only recovered sufficiently a short time
  ago to write it. And even then I had to threaten him with more of the drug.
  Do you know anything of chemistry?"</p>

  <p>"I fear not," said Veight, glancing at the formula he held in his hand.
  "Have you taken any copies of it yet, Mr. Hoskins?"</p>

  <p>"No; I was waiting for the doctor to make certain that devil has not
  deceived me."</p>

  <p>"He is still below in the dungeon?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. And he remains there till the letters are dispatched."</p>

  <p>"And Captain Lovelace and Miss Venables?"</p>

  <p>"Upstairs in their rooms."</p>

  <p>Once again Veight glanced at Gregoroff, who gave the faintest of nods. And
  the next moment they closed in on the old man, who gave one frightened little
  squeal like a snared rabbit and then subsided limply, and his eyes roved from
  one to the other in terrified bewilderment as they forced him into a
  chair.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing to me?" he wailed.</p>

  <p>"Now listen, Mr. Hoskins," said Veight quietly. "And pay very close
  attention to what I am going to say. We shall not do you any harm provided
  you do not give us any trouble. But knowing your strange outlook on life we
  shall have to take certain precautions. Gregoroff and I want this formula,
  which you have been kind enough to give us, and so we propose to keep
  it."</p>

  <p>"But aren't you going to send it to all the governments?" cried Hoskins
  incredulously.</p>

  <p>Veight roared with laughter.</p>

  <p>"We are not, my dear sir. Ah! would you, you old devil?"</p>

  <p>For with a furious shout of rage Hoskins had sprung out of the chair and
  had hurled himself at the German. His eyes blazed with fanatical fury; his
  hands clawed at Veight's pocket, and his frenzied shrieks of "Traitor!" rang
  through the house. And it was not until Gregoroff joined in, and hit the old
  man on the point of the jaw, that he finally sank back in the chair mouthing
  incoherently.</p>

  <p>"You mustn't do that sort of thing, Mr. Hoskins," said Veight quietly, "or
  you may get hurt."</p>

  <p>"You devil! You devil!" muttered the other. "Are you going to sell that
  formula to one of the Powers?"</p>

  <p>"Such, roughly, is our intention, my dear sir," said Veight with an amused
  smile. "You don't really imagine, do you, that we should have wasted our time
  in this depressing hole for nothing?"</p>

  <p>"Never, while I live," cried the old man. "I will get the police... I will
  tell them..."</p>

  <p>"I rather feared that you might try something of that description," said
  Veight calmly. "But I confess I did not imagine you would be quite so
  uncontrolled. So we shall have to take steps accordingly. You're a stupid old
  gentleman, you know; very stupid. Where shall we put him, Paul?"</p>

  <p>"Down in the dungeon with Waldron," said the Russian. "And we'll have to
  gag him."</p>

  <p>"What about the other two?"</p>

  <p>"Put 'em down there too. I want to discuss that part of the show with
  you."</p>

  <p>"All right," said Veight briefly. "I think I know what you're going to
  say, but we'll talk it over."</p>

  <p>They deftly bound and gagged the old man in the chair where he sat, then
  they lifted him up and carried him down the stone steps to the dungeon
  below.</p>

  <p>"Someone to keep you company, Waldron," said Veight amiably. "He tells me
  that you have at last seen reason."</p>

  <p>The engineer officer glared at them in amazement.</p>

  <p>"What have you got the old swine tied up for?" he asked at length. His
  voice was still weak, but the cessation of the diabolical drug was already
  beginning to have its effect.</p>

  <p>"A little difference of opinion, my dear fellow," answered Veight. "We
  have slightly divergent views on what to do with your formula. By the way,"
  he continued, taking the paper from his pocket, "I most earnestly hope for
  your own sake that you haven't been trying any funny stuff. This is the
  correct formula?"</p>

  <p>"Go and try it for yourself," said Waldron indifferently. "Are you going
  to set me free?"</p>

  <p>"All in good time," cried Veight. "You look so attractive where you are.
  But I think I can promise you that in the course of a few days, at any rate,
  your troubles will be over."</p>

  <p>"But that devil Hoskins swore he'd let me go at once," shouted the soldier
  angrily.</p>

  <p>"Quite, quite," said Veight. "But, as you can see for yourself, our friend
  and host is no longer in charge of the situation."</p>

  <p>"Where are the rest of your foul brood?"</p>

  <p>"Getting along nicely, thank you. And now, Waldron, I have something to
  say to you. I am going to have this formula of yours examined by a qualified
  chemist. If he tells me that it is what you say it is&mdash;well and good.
  You will be free to go, and you can have a grand time getting your own back
  on that damned old bore over there. But if I find you've been playing the
  fool, you'll pray for marijuana once again instead of what I'll give
  you."</p>

  <p>Waldron yawned.</p>

  <p>"I wish you'd go and play elsewhere," he said. "I'm infernally
  sleepy."</p>

  <p>"So," continued Veight, "I would strongly advise you, if you have been so
  stupid as to write this down incorrectly, to rectify it <i>now</i>."</p>

  <p>"Do go away," said Waldron irritably. "I've told you to try if for
  yourself. I can't say more than that."</p>

  <p>Veight turned away, and beckoning to Gregoroff, they went back to the
  hall.</p>

  <p>"We'll have to chance it," he remarked. "It might take days to have this
  thing properly tried out."</p>

  <p>"Precisely," said the Russian. "And we aren't going to wait for days. Nor
  hours. We're going to clear at once. Leave those two where they are for the
  time and come in here. I want a drink. But we've got to get this
  straight."</p>

  <p>"You mean you want to quit without..."</p>

  <p>The German paused significantly.</p>

  <p>"I do," said Gregoroff doggedly. "I know what we arranged, and I was
  prepared to risk it if Waldron was still sticking out. But now that you've
  got the gas and the aeroplane plans, I tell you it's madness to stay one
  moment longer than is necessary."</p>

  <p>"But it means dropping twenty-five thousand pounds," cried Veight. "You're
  a fool, Gregoroff."</p>

  <p>"I'm a damned wise man. It's you who were the blasted fool&mdash;killing
  Cortez. Look here, Veight, there's no good our quarrelling. What's done is
  done, and you know that the only reason why I regret the death of those two
  rats is that it's made it dangerous for us."</p>

  <p>"Dangerous," sneered Veight. "Since when has our trade been anything but
  dangerous? If you think I'm going to lose twenty-five thousand pounds you're
  damn well mistaken. The instant Belfage..."</p>

  <p>"Belfage!" shouted Gregoroff. "The drunken little sweep! We'll probably
  never see him again."</p>

  <p>"The instant Belfage," continued Veight imperturbably, "has given those
  three adrenalin we go, and not before. There's a machine waiting for us;
  we've got nothing to do except motor to the aerodrome and get in."</p>

  <p>"And how long do you suggest we should wait for Belfage?" demanded
  Gregoroff.</p>

  <p>"You heard what Hoskins said; he'll be back at any moment. Then we'll make
  him drunk, which won't be difficult, and <i>voilà tout</i>."</p>

  <p>"It's risky," grumbled the Russian. "But I suppose we'll have to chance
  it."</p>

  <p>"It's worth while chancing something for twenty-five thousand apiece,"
  remarked Veight calmly.</p>

  <p>"That's true," admitted Gregoroff grudgingly. "But I confess I'd feel a
  great deal easier in my mind if you hadn't hit Cortez quite so hard."</p>

  <p>He was staring out of the window, and his eyes narrowed suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Who the devil is this crossing the drawbridge?" he cried.</p>

  <p>Veight joined him, and gave a prolonged whistle of astonishment.</p>

  <p>"It's Kalinsky himself. Now, what in the name of all that is marvellous
  has brought him down? You stay here; I'll deal with him."</p>

  <p>He hurried into the hall, and got to the front door just as the limousine
  pulled up outside.</p>

  <p>"This is a most unexpected pleasure, m'sieur," he said.</p>

  <p>"Unexpected!" snapped the financier, who was obviously not in the best of
  tempers. "What do you mean by unexpected? After the urgent message you sent
  me I had no alternative but to come, though it was exceedingly
  inconvenient."</p>

  <p>He entered the house and Veight closed the door in a complete daze.</p>

  <p>"Urgent message, m'sieur? I haven't sent you any urgent message."</p>

  <p>"Then who was that stammering fool who forced himself on me this morning
  in my hotel? Belfage he called himself; the doctor you told me about. Said he
  came from you, and that it was of vital importance I should come here this
  afternoon."</p>

  <p>Veight gave a sigh of relief. The thing was now comprehensible, though why
  Belfage should have done it was beyond him. And then came a sudden stabbing
  doubt. How did Belfage know anything about Kalinsky?</p>

  <p>"Confound it, Veight, have you lost the use of your tongue?" Kalinsky's
  angry voice broke in on his thoughts. "Twice have I asked you who these two
  men are lying about in the hall."</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon, m'sieur." With an effort he pulled himself together.
  Whatever had caused Belfage's action, it could wait. At the moment the vital
  thing was not to let Kalinsky even have an inkling that anything could be
  amiss.</p>

  <p>"To tell you the truth," he continued, "I have had so little sleep during
  the past forty-eight hours that I hardly know what I'm doing. Those two men
  are Graham Caldwell and his mechanic."</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with them?"</p>

  <p>"Doped with morphia. We brought them down from Scotland in that caravan
  you saw outside."</p>

  <p>"And the plans of the machine?"</p>

  <p>"Here in my pocket."</p>

  <p>He handed them to the millionaire, who glanced at them and then threw them
  on the table.</p>

  <p>"They convey nothing to me," he said. "You are sure those are the correct
  ones?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely certain, m'sieur. They were in the safe in Caldwell's office,
  and the man who had actually done some of the drawing himself gave them to
  me."</p>

  <p>"Did you see the machine?"</p>

  <p>"It was dark when we arrived, m'sieur," explained Veight, "and so it was
  impossible to inspect it closely. We burned it."</p>

  <p>"Then you didn't see it in flight?"</p>

  <p>"No, we did not. But the member of the Key Club whom you may remember I
  told you about, and who was responsible for our information in the first
  place, confirmed the fact that its performance is simply amazing."</p>

  <p>The financier lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Well, Veight," he said more cordially, "so far you seem to have done
  well. I may say that I myself through a roundabout source heard only
  yesterday that this machine is a marvel. I also heard that, so far as my
  informant knew, no plans, save these, were in existence. And so I say again
  that I consider you one to be congratulated."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, m'sieur." Veight bowed. "Things have gone very well. Because I
  have here the other thing I promised you&mdash;the formula of the gas."</p>

  <p>With a triumphant flourish he produced the paper from his pocket.</p>

  <p>"This again conveys nothing to me," said Kalinsky. "Have you any proof
  that it is correct?"</p>

  <p>"Frankly, m'sieur&mdash;I have no <i>proof</i>. I am not a chemist myself.
  But the English officer Waldron is below in the dungeon, and he realises that
  if it is not correct it will be even more unpleasant for him in the future
  than it has been in the past. You would perhaps like to see for
  yourself?"</p>

  <p>"Later&mdash;possibly. At present I am rather more interested in the
  future of the two gentlemen I see upon the floor."</p>

  <p>"That, m'sieur, you may safely leave in my hands," said Veight. "And I
  think it would be better for you not to know any more about it. I have
  thought out a scheme, which I flatter myself is not lacking in ingenuity, and
  which is certain to result in Belfage being hanged for the murder of these
  two and Waldron below."</p>

  <p>"And what are your immediate plans?"</p>

  <p>"To leave England at the first possible opportunity," answered Veight.
  "After which I shall report to you in Paris for the balance due."</p>

  <p>"You shall have it," said Kalinsky.</p>

  <p>He took out a bulky pocket-book, and Veight's eyes glistened.</p>

  <p>"You have done well, Herr Veight," he continued. "And though for the life
  of me I can't see quite what was the need for dragging me down here, I am
  glad I came and saw with my own eyes. Here are ten thousand in notes as we
  arranged, and the balance of forty will be handed to you in Paris
  when&mdash;er&mdash;the remaining conditions have been complied with."</p>

  <p>Veight took the notes and bowed.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, m'sieur. I can assure you they will be."</p>

  <p>Now that the first instalment was actually in his pocket he was itching
  for Kalinsky to go. Unfortunately, however, the financier showed no signs of
  so doing; he was inspecting his surroundings with obvious interest.</p>

  <p>"Extraordinary," he said at length. "Most interesting. By the way, where
  is the madman you told me about who owns this house?"</p>

  <p>"Keeping Waldron company in the dungeon," answered Veight. "He became
  quite annoyed when he realised the formula for the gas was not going to be
  used as he intended."</p>

  <p>"Of course; I remember. These strange people send things to everybody,
  don't they? I should very much like to see the dungeon, Veight."</p>

  <p>Concealing his impatience with an effort, the German led the way.</p>

  <p>"Be careful of the steps, m'sieur. They are rather dark."</p>

  <p>"Good gracious me!" said Kalinsky, staring about him. "It is unbelievable.
  And is this the wicked old man who tortured the gallant young inventor?"</p>

  <p>Veight swore under his breath; the great man had evidently quite recovered
  his temper and was pleased to be facetious. Pray Heaven he would be quick
  about it.</p>

  <p>"That is the gentleman," he answered, forcing a laugh.</p>

  <p>"Well, well," said Kalinsky genially, "it takes all sorts to make a world,
  doesn't it? But what a bloodthirsty old ruffian you must be!"</p>

  <p>He lit another cigarette and turned away.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;I think that is quite enough, Veight. I do not find the
  atmosphere of this apartment very much to my liking. I think I will now
  return to London."</p>

  <p>Veight heaved a sigh of relief; then grew suddenly tense as he heard the
  sound of hurried footsteps in the hall above.</p>

  <p>"Veight!" came a hoarse shout. "Veight&mdash;where are you?"</p>

  <p>The German stood very still: it was Belfage's voice.</p>

  <p>"I'm below in the dungeon," he answered. "What do you want?"</p>

  <p>"Who is that?" cried Kalinsky quickly.</p>

  <p>"Doctor Belfage, m'sieur," said Veight, as the doctor, white and sweating,
  clattered down the stairs, to pause for a moment as he saw Kalinsky.</p>

  <p>"Belfage?" snapped the millionaire. "That is not the man I saw this
  morning. What the devil is the meaning of all this?"</p>

  <p>Icy fear was clutching at Veight's heart. He knew now that something had
  gone wrong, but he forced himself to speak calmly.</p>

  <p>"It is quite all right, m'sieur," he said. "Some small
  misunderstanding."</p>

  <p>Already his quick brain was working: at any rate he had ten thousand in
  his pocket. And then he realised Belfage was pouring out some confused jumble
  of words.</p>

  <p>"Skeletons!" roared Kalinsky, now beside himself with rage. "What in God's
  name is this madman talking about?"</p>

  <p>"Pull yourself together, you drunken swine," snarled Veight, shaking
  Belfage like a rat. "What's the matter with you?"</p>

  <p>"The skeletons, Veight. The skeletons at Hartley Court. Two of them were
  females."</p>

  <p>The German's hands dropped to his sides.</p>

  <p>"Females!" he muttered foolishly. "Females! What do you mean,
  females?"</p>

  <p>And from behind him Waldron began to laugh. And the laughter grew till it
  swelled to a mighty chorus. From all round him, from above him were unseen
  people laughing&mdash;just laughing.</p>

  <p>"<i>Ein wunderschöner Abend, Herr Veight.</i>"</p>

  <p>"Pardon! 'Ad tripe for me supper. Comes back on one like, don't it."</p>

  <p>God above! The bleary-eyed youth at his hotel in London. And still that
  laughter went on rising and falling, until, as if it was a drill, it stopped
  abruptly. And the silence was more terrifying than the noise.</p>

  <p>He could hear the heavy thumping of his heart; dazedly, sickly, he
  realised that everything had miscarried. But how? How? Beside him Kalinsky,
  now thoroughly frightened, was clutching his arm convulsively; Belfage in a
  state of collapse had sunk down on the steps. And then came a well-remembered
  voice from above.</p>

  <p>"So we meet again, Herr Veight. Kindly come up into the hall."</p>

  <p>Like a man in a dream the German obeyed Drummond's order. All power of
  connected thought had temporarily left him: the sudden shattering of all his
  plans had numbed his brain. He realised subconsciously that the hall was full
  of men. He saw Standish, and Darrell, and Gregson and a dozen others he did
  not know; he saw Lovelace and Doris Venables standing at the foot of the
  stairs; he saw as a man sees the background of a picture in relation to the
  central figure. And that central figure was the man standing opposite him on
  whose face was no trace of mercy.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Kalinsky gave a cry, and pointed to one of the group.</p>

  <p>"There's the man who came to me this morning and said he was Belfage."</p>

  <p>No one answered; no one spoke, and then Veight heard a voice. It was his
  own.</p>

  <p>"How ... did ... you ... escape?"</p>

  <p>He was still staring, hypnotised, at Drummond.</p>

  <p>"The court will now commence," was the only answer. "Bring forward the
  other prisoner."</p>

  <p>He pointed to Gregoroff, whose nerve had completely gone.</p>

  <p>"You fool!" he screamed at Veight. "I told you we should have got away at
  once."</p>

  <p>"You've never had a chance, Gregoroff," said Drummond. "For the past three
  days you have never been out of our sight."</p>

  <p>"How ... did ... you ... escape?"</p>

  <p>Once more Veight's parched lips mouthed the sentence.</p>

  <p>"Sufficient for you, Veight, that we did."</p>

  <p>"A truce to this play-acting," snarled Kalinsky, who had recovered
  himself. "Do you know who I am, sir?"</p>

  <p>"I have that misfortune," said Drummond dispassionately. "And anything
  that you may care to say in mitigation of your conduct will be carefully
  considered."</p>

  <p>"Mitigation! Conduct!" shouted the millionaire. "This, sir, is an
  outrage."</p>

  <p>"It is," agreed Drummond pleasantly. "And a far worse one will shortly be
  perpetrated upon you. But before that takes place we will converse awhile,
  Kalinsky."</p>

  <p>White with passion, the millionaire strode to the front door. It was
  locked and the key was not there.</p>

  <p>"Open this door, sir." He was stammering with rage. "Open this door at
  once. I insist."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Kalinsky insists. What an epoch-making moment! Ten thousand pounds is
  the sum, I think, you have just paid Veight for the documents in your
  pocket."</p>

  <p>Very slowly the millionaire came back: the seriousness of the situation
  had come home to him. This ring of silent men meant business, and Kalinsky's
  soul grew sick within him. But his voice was steady when he spoke.</p>

  <p>"Who are you, may I ask?"</p>

  <p>"That is quite immaterial," said Drummond. "Shall we say that, at the
  moment, I represent justice? Perhaps a little rough and ready; nevertheless
  justice. What are the documents for which you have just paid Veight ten
  thousand pounds?"</p>

  <p>"That is my concern," answered Kalinsky.</p>

  <p>"Assuredly. Give me those notes, Veight."</p>

  <p>Completely cowed, the German handed them over.</p>

  <p>"Ten thousand pounds!" Drummond balanced the packet in his hand. "A lot of
  money, Kalinsky: they must be very valuable."</p>

  <p>"They are worth it to me," said the millionaire in an off-hand tone.</p>

  <p>And once again a chorus of laughter rose, fell and died away.</p>

  <p>"I am delighted to hear it," said Drummond gravely. "True we all have
  different standards of value; but it is most impressive to realise yours.
  Have you by any chance made Mr. Graham Caldwell's acquaintance?"</p>

  <p>Instinctively Kalinsky looked at the two men who still sprawled
  unconscious on the floor.</p>

  <p>"No, no; the <i>real</i> Graham Caldwell," continued Drummond. "Those two
  were wished on Veight in Scotland. They belong, I believe, to the local
  branch of the Key Club. Here he is."</p>

  <p>A freckle-faced young man with a cheerful grin stepped forward.</p>

  <p>"What are the plans Mr. Kalinsky has got?" asked Drummond.</p>

  <p>"Bits of a Puss Moth and an old Bristol fighter," said Caldwell. "But even
  then there's a lot missing. A wheelbarrow would fly better."</p>

  <p>"I wonder," remarked Drummond pensively, "if any government really wants a
  flying wheelbarrow. You can but try, Kalinsky. And you've always got the gas,
  haven't you? I hope that's all right for him, Waldron."</p>

  <p>"Grand," said the sapper. "I wrote it down in a hurry, but the final
  process should undoubtedly produce a form of cheese mould."</p>

  <p>"Think of it, Kalinsky," cried Drummond enthusiastically. "A wheelbarrow
  with wings, and a spot of gorgonzola. They'll put up a statue to you."</p>

  <p>Kalinsky turned on Veight in a cold fury.</p>

  <p>"So you've double-crossed me, you rat. Hand me back that money."</p>

  <p>"You forget he hasn't got it," said Drummond, still balancing the notes in
  his hand. "And it is really we who have done the crossing&mdash;not Veight.
  So we shall be pleased to keep these for our trouble."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Kalinsky with a sneer. "Plain theft."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no! A little present from Veight. And so that there shall be no
  misunderstanding, Kalinsky, an anonymous present of ten thousand pounds will
  be made to-morrow to the disabled soldiers and sailors fund."</p>

  <p>His eyes bored into the millionaire.</p>

  <p>"You may, if you like, make trouble. I don't somehow think you will. If
  your part in this affair comes out, your name will stink in the nostrils of
  the world. And there is a certain poetic justice, isn't there, in this money
  going to men who fought, in view of what it was really intended for? War:
  another war. More millions in your pocket; more millions mutilated or in
  their graves."</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you're talking about," muttered Kalinsky.</p>

  <p>"Tidying up, sare," quoted Drummond. "Having found out Veight was coming
  to see you, I came first. And as Henri is an old friend of mine, I had no
  difficulty in persuading him to let me act as floor waiter. He thought I was
  doing it for a bet."</p>

  <p>"Confound your impertinence," snarled Kalinsky. "My part in the whole
  affair was perfectly legitimate. I promised this damned fool Veight money for
  certain things. What I proposed to do with them is entirely my own affair. He
  has failed to get them, and that is the end of the matter so far as I am
  concerned."</p>

  <p>"That, I fear, is where we must agree to differ," said Drummond gravely.
  "I heard most of your conversation with Sir James Portrush; I heard your
  delightful bargain with Veight. And neither I nor my friends think you at all
  funny. In fact we think you a profound bore, Kalinsky, a very tedious person.
  Which must be rectified. If you can't make people laugh by fair means, you
  shall make them laugh by foul. Bring that rope, Peter."</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do with me?" cried the now terrified
  millionaire.</p>

  <p>"You'll see," said Drummond as Darrell and Standish passed the rope under
  Kalinsky's arms. "And I would advise you to keep your mouth shut for the next
  few minutes. In with him, boys."</p>

  <p>Gibbering with fright, Kalinsky disappeared through the window, and a loud
  splash proclaimed his destination. Three times was he hauled up; three times
  was he dropped back. Then he reappeared, and again the chorus of laughter was
  heard.</p>

  <p>Dripping wet, with duckweed in his hair, the millionaire stood there
  emitting a powerful odour of stagnant slime, and almost crying with rage and
  mortification.</p>

  <p>"Very funny; very funny indeed," cried Drummond approvingly. "I told you
  you could make people laugh if you tried. But it would be selfish on our part
  to keep you all to ourselves. Good-bye, Kalinsky; they'll be tickled to death
  at the Ritz-Carlton. Run him out, Peter; the swine is an outrage and an
  offence against God and man. Here's the key."</p>

  <p>The front door closed behind him, and silence settled on the room, which
  was broken at length by Drummond.</p>

  <p>"And that brings us to the lesser fry," he said quietly. "Veight;
  Gregoroff; even the egregious Doctor Belfage I see. But where are Meredith
  and Cortez? The party does not seem to be complete. And you were all so matey
  in Scotland, weren't you?"</p>

  <p>"I believe you're the devil himself," muttered the German sullenly. "Were
  you up there too?"</p>

  <p>"Of course. As I told your Russian friend, you haven't been out of my
  sight. By the way, Gregoroff, have you met any more elementals with croquet
  mallets?"</p>

  <p>"It was you, was it?"</p>

  <p>"It was. A ripe and fruity blow, I flatter myself. But, I think, if
  anything, it has improved your appearance."</p>

  <p>"How the devil did you get out of that room?" said Gregoroff with a
  scowl.</p>

  <p>"I don't think you have actually met Mr. Seymour, have you? You did your
  best to shoot him on his motor-bicycle, but that hardly constitutes a formal
  introduction. A rising journalist, Gregoroff, and a lad of sunny disposition
  as you can see. Moreover, it is entirely due to him that you are in your
  present unsatisfactory position."</p>

  <p>The Russian's scowl deepened as he looked at the young reporter.</p>

  <p>"With becoming modesty he maintains that it was a sheer fluke. I, on the
  other hand, consider it was an extremely quick piece of work for which he
  deserves the greatest credit. I had arranged to meet him the day after you so
  kindly locked us up, and somewhat naturally I failed to keep my appointment.
  He waited and waited, and under the inspiration of a ginger ale he fell into
  conversation with that lovely girl who dispenses gin in the bar. They talked
  of this and that, and after a while she mentioned the jolly little party
  overnight when we had met Doctor Belfage. She also mentioned Hartley Court.
  So Seymour decided it could do no harm to call there. I trust I interest
  you."</p>

  <p>"Go on," muttered Gregoroff.</p>

  <p>"Naturally he found the house empty. But the sight of an unlatched window
  downstairs was too much for him and he entered. It was all very still and
  silent, but as he stood on the kitchen stairs wondering whether to explore
  there came from close by his head a little click. He looked up: it was the
  electric-light meter, and subconsciously he noted the reading. Then he went
  all over the house and found nothing. It took some time, and at last he
  decided to go. And then occurred, Gregoroff, one of those little things which
  sometimes alter the fate of nations. As he passed the meter he happened to
  glance at it again: <i>the reading was different</i>. Somewhere in the house
  current was being consumed. Where?"</p>

  <p>"You cursed fool, Gregoroff!" cried Veight. "It was you who insisted on
  leaving the light on."</p>

  <p>"Come, come," said Drummond. "Mutual, I think. But with unerring accuracy,
  Veight, you have spotted what you gave away. To make certain, Seymour
  continued to watch the meter until it changed, again; then, being a
  determined young man, he once more went over the house. And this time, by
  taking a few rough measurements, he realised there was an inner room, the
  existence of which he had not suspected before. The rest was easy. He tapped:
  he heard a faint answer. And four hours later a nice gentleman with a
  blowpipe affair had cut through the door. That is how we got out, Gregoroff,
  and had you and Veight met us then we should assuredly have killed you both.
  We were not amused."</p>

  <p>Drummond lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"But saner counsels prevailed. Mr. Standish had already solved the real
  message which was flung through my window by Captain Lovelace. But you
  haven't seen that one, have you? How stupid of me. There have been so many
  flying round, haven't there? It was in code too&mdash;'Mary Jane. Urgent. G G
  Font.'"</p>

  <p>Sullenly the two foreigners stared at him.</p>

  <p>"In code," Drummond continued quietly, "to minimise the chance, if you
  found it, of your moving poor Waldron elsewhere. Mary Jane, with Cortez
  introducing the Mexican atmosphere, gave us Marijuana: G G&mdash;Horse:
  Pont&mdash;bridge, in French. Not a very clever code, as I am sure Captain
  Lovelace would be the first to admit, but men who are half murdered, Veight,
  are not very clever."</p>

  <p>"He shouldn't have tried to escape," muttered the German.</p>

  <p>"Shouldn't have tried to escape, you rat!" roared Drummond. "A British
  officer from a damned foreign spy! Don't scowl at me, blast you, or I'll give
  you a taste of Gregoroff's medicine. To resume, however," he continued.
  "Fearing you might return to Hartley Court and find the birds had flown, we
  decided to burn the house down. It was a pity that two of the skeletons we
  obtained with great difficulty were those of the fair sex, but they served
  their purpose."</p>

  <p>"What purpose?" said Veight angrily. "Why didn't you strike then instead
  of waiting?"</p>

  <p>"For two good reasons," answered Drummond. "First and foremost in order to
  touch that blackguard Kalinsky for ten thousand pounds. Secondly&mdash;but I
  presume you have never read the immortal 'Stalky'&mdash;we wanted to jape
  with you. And you can't imagine the amount of fun you've given us."</p>

  <p>"And what do you propose to do with us now?" asked the German. "Put us in
  the lake too?"</p>

  <p>"No, Veight: you have a more important role to play which you will
  discover in due course. Doctor Belfage as well, and the incredible old
  gentleman downstairs. I would have liked Meredith and Cortez.... By the way,
  have you any idea where they are?"</p>

  <p>"I have not, and for a very good reason," said Veight quietly. With the
  realisation that the situation was desperate, his self-control had come back.
  "Since you appear to know everything, it is quite refreshing to find that you
  do not. Just after it was light this morning we all got out to stretch our
  legs, and when we started off again I thought they were in the caravan, and
  Gregoroff thought they were in the car. So between us we left them
  behind."</p>

  <p>"What an annoying <i>contretemps</i>!" cried Drummond. "If only I'd known
  that, it would have quite allayed my childish fears. But when I saw you and
  Gregoroff emerging from that wood this morning&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You saw us!" Veight almost screamed.</p>

  <p>"I was in the scarlet monoplane," explained Drummond patiently. "The
  Graham Caldwell machine. You didn't burn it, you know: when we gathered your
  intentions an ancient glider was put inside the shed. To resume, however.
  When I saw you coming out of the wood, and there was no sign of the other
  two, I was filled with unworthy suspicions. So we landed a little later, and
  I communicated those suspicions to the police."</p>

  <p>Veight swallowed twice, and his knuckles gleamed white on the back of the
  chair he was gripping.</p>

  <p>"What a waste of time!" He forced himself to speak calmly. "They should be
  here at any moment now."</p>

  <p>"I fear not," said Drummond sadly. "Veight, you must prepare yourself for
  a shock. The dead bodies of your poor friends were found in the wood."</p>

  <p>The German had again recovered his self-control: his start of amazement
  was admirable.</p>

  <p>"<i>Gott im Himmel!</i>" he cried. "Dead! But how?"</p>

  <p>"Clutched in Meredith's hand was a motor jack; in that of Cortez a
  revolver. Meredith was shot through the heart; Cortez had his skull
  broken."</p>

  <p>"They were quarrelling when we all got out of the car, Gregoroff, if you
  remember," said Veight thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"That is so," assented the Russian.</p>

  <p>"And did you leave them there quarrelling: one armed with a jack and the
  other with a gun?" asked Drummond politely.</p>

  <p>"I have already told you," said Veight, "that it was quite by accident
  they were left behind at all."</p>

  <p>"Of course! Of course! How stupid of me. What were they quarrelling about,
  I wonder? The plans of the wheelbarrow; or can it have been the flying
  cheese? Or perhaps," he added hopefully, "it was just naughty temper at being
  left to walk. Anyway, that is your next role&mdash;the two principal
  witnesses at the inquest on Meredith and Cortez."</p>

  <p>The German's jaw tightened but he said nothing.</p>

  <p>"I don't understand," stammered Veight, after a pause. "If he shot
  Meredith..."</p>

  <p>"Precisely," remarked Drummond. "If! You see, the revolver was in his
  right hand: the fingerprints are those of his left. Playtime is over,"
  continued Drummond. "Serious business begins. And when through the medium of
  a nice double murder the public are put wise to your recent activities, even
  they may begin to realise that this country is living in a fool's paradise
  over armaments."</p>

  <p>The telephone bell started to ring, and he picked up the receiver. And as
  he listened a look of amazement appeared on his face. At length the metallic
  voice ceased, and Drummond very slowly replaced the instrument.</p>

  <p>"The police, Veight," he said gravely. "They want to know if you and
  Gregoroff are here. As you heard, I told them you were. They are coming to
  ask you some questions."</p>

  <p>The German moistened his lips with the tip of his tongue.</p>

  <p>"You will be interested to hear that they have found Cortez's finger-
  prints on his revolver," continued Drummond.</p>

  <p>"Naturally," said Veight. "You told me he shot Meredith, and that the
  revolver was found in his hand."</p>

  <p>"Yes: lying very loosely. And the police want to know how it got
  there."</p>

  <p>For a space in which a man may count five there was silence, while the
  German, his face ashen, swayed on his feet. Then with a roar like a beast
  Gregoroff hurled himself on him.</p>

  <p>"Damn you!" he shouted. "What did you want to kill him for?"</p>

  <p>"So," said Drummond when they were finally separated, "it would seem that
  my unworthy suspicions were justified after all. But I think your message to
  the British public will be even more valuable when it comes from the dock and
  not from the witness-box."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap15"
     name="chap15">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"The Chief wants to see you, Hugh," said Gregson. "You, too,
  Ronald, and Seymour as well. Old Portrush is with him cluckling like an
  agitated hen."</p>

  <p>Drummond grinned faintly, and followed the speaker along the passage to a
  large airy room overlooking Whitehall. Behind a big desk sat a grey-haired
  man with a pair of keen, penetrating eyes, while beside him Sir James
  Portrush clutched the inevitable attaché case.</p>

  <p>"So you are the sinners who have been corrupting my young gentlemen," said
  Colonel Talbot genially. "The tale I have listened to from Gregson is just
  about the most completely immoral recital of utter illegality I have ever
  heard. In fact at a rough guess I should think you have all laid yourselves
  open to at least ten years' penal servitude."</p>

  <p>"At least," agreed Drummond happily. "But we've had a grand time,
  Colonel."</p>

  <p>"What staggers me," cried Sir James, "are these disclosures about
  Kalinsky. I can scarcely credit them. Why, only a few nights ago, I was
  having a long conversation with him on the European situation at the
  Ritz-Carlton."</p>

  <p>"I heard it all," said Drummond, lighting a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"You heard it?" spluttered Sir James. "But we were alone."</p>

  <p>"I heard it through the keyhole," said Drummond calmly, and Colonel Talbot
  hurriedly bent down to pick up a paper. "I was the waiter."</p>

  <p>"Really, Captain Drummond," cried the minister angrily, "that is quite
  inexcusable."</p>

  <p>"If I hadn't," said Drummond, "Kalinsky would now have the Graham Caldwell
  plans. And Morgenstein. He was in it too."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless unpardonable," continued Sir James. "To listen to a private
  conversation! It's ... it's not done."</p>

  <p>"It was that night," laughed Drummond. "'Dictators, knaves, or
  fools'&mdash;do you remember?"</p>

  <p>Sir James flushed scarlet.</p>

  <p>"This is intolerable," he snapped.</p>

  <p>"Come, come, Sir James, be reasonable. You must judge every case on its
  own merits. And in this instance I consider I was justified. I knew Veight
  was coming to see Kalinsky, which by itself was enough to prove he was a
  wrong 'un. But if I may be permitted to say so&mdash;wrong 'un or not, the
  advice he gave you was the goods."</p>

  <p>"I am infinitely obliged to you for your opinion," remarked Sir James
  sarcastically.</p>

  <p>"And," continued Drummond imperturbably, "it will not be through any fault
  of mine if that advice is not broadcast to the country when Veight and
  Gregoroff come up for trial. They'll hang 'em as high as Haman&mdash;both of
  'em, and that always interests the public."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to tell me"&mdash;Sir James appeared to be on the verge of a
  seizure of sorts&mdash;"do you mean to tell me that you have the
  audacity&mdash;the damned audacity&mdash;to pass on a private conversation
  you heard through a keyhole?"</p>

  <p>"Most certainly," answered Drummond. "I won't say it was you, but I'm
  undoubtedly going to tell the public Kalinsky's remarks that night. Wait, Sir
  James!"</p>

  <p>He held up his hand, and after an abortive splutter the minister
  subsided.</p>

  <p>"You did not go through the last war as&mdash;er&mdash;as a combatant. We
  did, and we don't want another, any more than some of the pacifist young
  gentlemen to-day, who have never heard a shot fired in anger. We know the
  horrors of it first-hand; we are all out to prevent it again if we can. But
  we maintain that the present policy of cutting down our fighting forces to
  the extent they have been reduced, is the most certain way of precipitating
  it. Do you realise that if this young feller here had not got us out of that
  house, war <i>would</i> have come? I ask you&mdash;do you realise that? But
  for the tick of an electric-light meter war would have come. As you know,
  they intended to kill Waldron and Graham Caldwell, so that those two secrets
  would have been Kalinsky's sole property. Do you suppose he was going to use
  'em for shaving-paper?"</p>

  <p>"Really, Captain Drummond, I am not accustomed to being hectored in this
  way." Sir James had at last found his voice. "The Government's policy on such
  matters is&mdash;er&mdash;a matter for the Government alone."</p>

  <p>"Well, at any rate, you know Kalinsky's opinion of that policy. And,"
  Drummond added pleasantly, "though he may be a knave, Sir James, he most
  certainly is not a fool."</p>

  <p>With a snort like an angry bull, Sir James snatched up his hat and rose to
  his feet.</p>

  <p>"You, it seems to me, Captain Drummond, combine both qualities. Good
  morning, Colonel Talbot; I am already late for a Cabinet meeting."</p>

  <p>"Totes on greyhound tracks still worrying the old grey matter?" asked
  Drummond anxiously. "But they tell me Flying Fish for the third race at the
  White City to-night is a cinch. Shall I put on a quid for you?"</p>

  <p>"I am not interested in dog-racing, thank you."</p>

  <p>"Great fun, you know. And you could always earn a spot of honest dough as
  a tick-tack man. All you've got to do is to wave your arms and legs about and
  make faces. Just like a Cabinet meeting."</p>

  <p>The door shut with a crash, and then Drummond threw up his hands in
  despair.</p>

  <p>"How long, O Lord, how long?" he cried. "It isn't that his opinion differs
  from mine, but it is that ghastly air of smug self-complacency that gets my
  goat. What's your opinion, Colonel?"</p>

  <p>But that worthy officer was beyond speech. Tears were pouring down his
  face; his shoulders heaved convulsively.</p>

  <p>"Portrush as a tick-tack man!" he gasped at length. "You're a thoroughly
  reprehensible scoundrel, Drummond," he continued in a shaking voice, "and
  your proper fate is to be hanged between Veight and Gregoroff. But at any
  rate you've made me laugh. Now tell me, how many crimes have you committed in
  the course of the last few days?"</p>

  <p>"How many, Ronald?" asked Drummond cheerfully.</p>

  <p>"The only one, Chief, is burning down the house," said Standish. "And a
  few odd trifles against some lower excrescences of the Key Club, which they
  brought on themselves. But with regard to Hartley Court, I do not think there
  will be any trouble. Hugh and I will settle matters with Doctor Belfage."</p>

  <p>"All right. But I don't want to hear anything about it," laughed the
  Colonel. "You're a bunch of miscreants, and the whole thing is hopelessly
  irregular. Get out. And I shall be delighted if you'll all dine with me to-
  night. Cabbageface knows the house, and the port is passing fair.
  Incidentally Ginger and that delightful girl are coming. We must drink their
  health."</p>

  <p>"Bye-bye, Hugh, for the moment," said Standish, as they reached the
  street. "I'm going round to the insurance wallahs now. See you again this
  evening."</p>

  <p>The traffic roared past in a ceaseless stream, and for a space Seymour
  stood staring at it beside a man grown suddenly silent.</p>

  <p>"I can still hardly believe that it has all happened," he said at
  length.</p>

  <p>Drummond turned to him slowly.</p>

  <p>"Make England believe that it will happen, unless..."</p>

  <p>The sentence uncompleted, he strode oft, and Trafalgar Square swallowed
  him up.</p>
