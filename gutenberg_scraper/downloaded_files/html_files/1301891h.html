  <h2><a id="pro"
     name="pro"></a>PROLOGUE</h2>

  <p class="first">HARRY THORNE opened his eyes and gazed about him with a
  startled expression. This was not the tawdry hotel bedroom in which he had
  gone to sleep; it was a small room with bare, concrete walls, a door of
  hardwood planking studded with bolts, and a barred window. The only articles
  of furniture were the cot on which he was lying, a chair, and a small
  table.</p>

  <p>So the sleeping pills didn&rsquo;t finish me off, he thought. Now
  I&rsquo;m in jail for attempted suicide!</p>

  <p>Thorne sat up, then rose unsteadily to his feet and staggered to the
  window. Supporting himself by gripping the thick iron bars, he peered out. It
  was broad daylight and the sun was high in the heavens. Below him stretched a
  deep valley, through which a narrow stream meandered. And as far as he could
  see in all directions there were mountains, though the highest peaks were all
  below the level of his own eyes.</p>

  <p>He turned from the window at the sound of a key grating in a lock. Then
  the heavy door swung inward, and a large man entered the cell, bearing a tray
  of food and a steaming pot of coffee. Behind the man was a still larger
  figure, whose very presence radiated authority. His forehead was high and
  bulged outward over shaggy eyebrows that met above his aquiline nose. He wore
  a pointed, closely cropped Vandyke, black with a slight sprinkling of gray,
  and was dressed in faultlessly tailored evening clothes.</p>

  <p>Thorne got to his feet as his singular visitor closed the door behind him.
  Then, in a booming bass, the man said, &ldquo;At last, Mr. Thorne, I have
  caught up with you. I am Dr. Morgan.&rdquo; He smiled. &ldquo;And, I might
  add, not a moment too soon. You gave us quite a time&mdash;Boyd and I managed
  to get you out of that hotel room and down to the street, passing you off as
  drunk. Don&rsquo;t you remember a knocking at the door? You weren&rsquo;t
  quite out when we came in.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thorne thought for a moment, then nodded. It seemed that there had been a
  pounding somewhere. &ldquo;How did you get in? I thought I locked the
  door.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You did, but I had skeleton keys with me, just in case. We took you
  to my apartment, treated you, and brought you out here.&rdquo; Morgan nodded
  to Boyd, who left the room, then waved his hand invitingly toward the tray.
  &ldquo;I ordered breakfast served in your room. I especially urge you to try
  the coffee. It will counteract the effect of the sedatives I was compelled to
  use in order to save your life and bring you here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve gone to a lot of trouble to save something I
  don&rsquo;t want,&rdquo; Thorne said. &ldquo;May I ask why you are
  interfering in my affairs?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I need you,&rdquo; Morgan replied simply. &ldquo;And I can offer
  you adventure such as only one other man of Earth has known&mdash;possibly
  glory, possibly death. But if death, not the mean sort you were
  seeking.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Harry Thorne frowned. &ldquo;You referred to a man of Earth as if there
  were men not of Earth. Are you suggesting a trip to Mars?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Dr. Morgan laughed. &ldquo;Splendid, Mr. Thorne. But suppose you tackle
  this breakfast. It will put you in a better frame of mind for what I am going
  to tell you. I shall not lock the door as I leave. When you have finished,
  join me in the drawing room&mdash;at the end of the corridor to your
  right.&rdquo; He paused in the doorway. &ldquo;You mentioned a trip to Mars,
  Mr. Thorne. Forgive me if I keep you in suspense for a time, but - although
  it is not exactly what you think those words mean - that is what I am going
  to propose.&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

  <p class="first">&ldquo;YOU have heard of telepathy, of course&mdash;in fact,
  Mr. Thorne, you experimented with it at one time.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How did you know that, doctor?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You wrote a letter about your experiments to the editor of a
  popular magazine. It was published under your own name two months
  ago.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thorne rubbed his brow. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, I did&mdash;been so
  busy I forgot all about it. But my results were negative.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Dr. Morgan nodded. &ldquo;So were mine, for nearly twenty years. It was a
  hobby when I was in practice, but since my retirement, I&rsquo;ve devoted my
  full time to it. Let me brief you on the basics.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Telepathy, the communication of thoughts or ideas from one mind to
  another without the use of any physical medium whatever, is not influenced or
  hampered by either time or space. That is fundamental, but I had to amend it.
  I failed to achieve anything until I succeeded in building a device which
  would pick up and amplify thought waves. And even then I would have failed
  had this machine not caught the waves projected by another machine which
  another man had built to amplify and project them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You mean you can read minds by radio, as it were?&rdquo; Thorne
  asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To a very limited extent. If you had a projector in this room, and
  I had my receiver here, I could pick up any thoughts you sent me, but only
  those you consciously projected. I could not read your mind in the sense of
  picking up anything you did not want me to know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thorne took a cigarette from the box on the table to his right and lit it.
  &ldquo;Interesting,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;but what has this to do with
  Mars?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I made only one amendment to that basic theory, Mr. Thorne. The
  rest of it holds true: the communication of thoughts or-ideas from one mind
  to another is not influenced or hampered by time or space. The man who built
  the thought- projector is on Mars.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Men on Mars - you mean Martians, or human beings like us? Excuse
  me, doctor, but that is spreading it a bit thick. I&rsquo;m well enough up on
  present-day studies of the planets&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&hellip; to know that the existence of a human civilization on Mars
  today is hardly credible,&rdquo; Morgan broke in. &ldquo;You are quite right.
  None such exists.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then how&hellip;?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Space or time. I was incredulous, too, when I got in touch with
  someone who identified himself as a human being, one Lal Vak, a Martian
  scientist and psychologist. And I might add that Lal Vak found the idea of a
  human civilization on Earth a bit thick, too. But the explanation, fantastic
  as it may seem, is quite simple: Lal Vak is speaking to me from the Mars of
  some millions of years ago, when a human civilization did exist
  there.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Morgan raised his hand. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t interrupt now - hear me out.
  From that simple exchange of visual and auditory impressions which marked our
  first communications, we progressed until each one had learned the language
  of the other to a degree that enabled us to exchange abstract as well as
  concrete ideas.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was Lal Vak who suggested that if we could find a man on Earth
  and one on Mars whose bodies were similar enough to be doubles, their brain
  patterns might also be similar enough so that consciousness could be
  transferred between them. Thus, Earth of the 20th Century could be viewed
  through Martian eyes, while the (to us) ancient Mars culture - we cannot yet
  place it in time relative to Earth - could be seen at first hand by a man
  from Earth. First Lal Vak projected to me many thought images of Martians
  willing to make this exchange - so clearly that I was able to draw detailed
  pictures of them. But that was not enough. I could spend the rest of my life
  without finding any counterparts of these Martians here. The second thing Lal
  Vak did was to tell me how to make what we call a mind-compass, and gave me
  the brain- patterns of his volunteers. I followed his directions and fed the
  first brain- pattern into the mind- compass.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thorne leaned forward intently. &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing. The needle rotated aimlessly. This meant that either there
  was no physical counterpart of this Martian now alive on earth, or any such
  double did not have a similar brain-pattern. I fed in the second and third
  patterns with the same result. But with the fourth pattern, the needle swung
  directly to a given point and remained there.&rdquo; Morgan opened a drawer
  in the little table and took out some pencil sketches. &ldquo;Recognize this
  man?&rdquo; he asked, handing a sketch to Thorne.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your assistant - Boyd, you called him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Correct. Under the influence of Lal Vak&rsquo;s thoughts, I drew a
  picture of Frank Boyd. To shorten the story, I found him in an Alaskan mining
  camp. He was interested in the venture I proposed - he is now on
  Mars.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But - I just saw him..</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You saw the body of Frank Boyd, which is now inhabited by Sel Han,
  a Martian. On Mars, Sel Han&rsquo;s body is occupied by Frank Boyd, an
  Earthman. But I made one terrible mistake.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In my eagerness to find a volunteer, I did not investigate Frank
  Boyd. Sel Han has cooperated with Lal Vak and me, but once on Mars, Frank
  Boyd broke contact - and without his cooperation, it could not be maintained.
  I have learned through Lal Vak that Boyd has allied himself with a group of
  Martians who are out to seize power and set up an empire over the entire
  planet. Mars is presently in a state roughly analogous to our middle ages,
  socially, though in some branches of science they are in advance of us. But
  theirs is not a machine civilization, and an adventurer who is also a
  fighting man - or adept at intrigue - can go far there.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Harry Thorne grinned. &ldquo;Let me see if I can guess the rest of the
  story. You&rsquo;ve loosed an unsavory character on Mars and feel
  you&rsquo;ve wronged your friend, Lal Vak, so you want to undo the damage if
  you can. You fed more brain- patterns into the object compass, and eventually
  the brain-pattern of&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&hellip;This man,&rdquo; Morgan agreed, passing him another sketch.
  Thorne took it and saw a drawing of himself in minute detail.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But that was not enough,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t
  want to repeat your error, so you spent some time investigating me
  first.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Dr. Morgan smiled. &ldquo;And the results were most satisfactory - to me.
  You had a good war record in Korea, you&rsquo;ve been on hunting expeditions
  to Africa, and you&rsquo;ve been in business. Your recent difficulties, which
  resulted in the loss of your fiancée and your business - left you a pauper,
  in fact - came out of your refusal to go along with your partner&rsquo;s
  dubious (though legal) manipulations. He wiped you out and took your girl,
  too&hellip; In short, you are a man who might well do what Lal Vak and I
  feared impossible.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Harry Thorne nodded. &ldquo;Assuming that you can send me on this strange
  mission, what would you want me to do?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Only two things. Remain in touch with me, through Lal Vak, as much
  as possible, and, if you can, kill Frank Boyd - the Martian Sel Han.
  Otherwise, your life on Mars will be your own, to live as you choose, or as
  the Martians choose to let you live. If you are able to rise above your
  environment - as I think you will be - you will find opportunities there you
  could never hope for here. You will find a world of romance and adventure
  undreamed of outside of fiction. And if you are not equally quick with sword
  and wits, you will find death. Knowing you to be an expert fencer - yes, I
  found out that you had tried to get a job with a fencing instructor and was
  turned down because you beat him, too easily - I don&rsquo;t think I need
  worry about you on the first count.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The prospect appeals to me,&rdquo; Thorne admitted. &ldquo;But I
  refuse to murder a man I have never seen.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you oppose Sel Han&rsquo;s designs, I assure you that you will
  have to kill him or be killed. There&rsquo;s no question of murder - it will
  be simple and justifiable self-defense&hellip; Then&mdash;you&rsquo;ll
  go?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll at least make the attempt, with your assistance. How
  does this personality-transfer take place?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can only describe it as a sort of phasing of similar vibrations,
  represented by your brain-pattern and that of the Martian volunteer. But
  first I must put you under hypnosis. Then I will contact Lal Vak, and we will
  work together. He will be on hand to meet you when you awake in the body of a
  Martian. Now come over here and lie on the sofa.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thorne did as Dr. Morgan directed, and found that he was looking into a
  mirror painted with alternate circles of red and black. The doctor touched a
  button and the mirror began to rotate slowly. Morgan&rsquo;s voice came to
  him, &ldquo;Now think of that distant world, far off in time and space. Think
  of it beckoning you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thorne obeyed, his eyes fixed on the mirror. He began to feel drowsy, a
  pleasant lassitude stealing over him. The doctor&rsquo;s voice
  faded&hellip;</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

  <p>Thorne opened his eyes and looked up into a cloudless blue-gray sky that
  was like a vault of burnished steel. A diminutive sun blazed down upon him
  but oddly enough, with its heat and light seemingly unimpaired.</p>

  <p>The heat, in fact, was so great that it made him draw back into the
  relatively cold shade of the scaly-trunked conifer that towered above him,
  its crown of needle-like foliage gathered into a bellshaped tuft. Then
  conviction came to him. He was really on Mars! Wide awake, now, he sat bolt
  upright and looked about him. The tree that sheltered him stood alone in a
  small depression, surrounded by a billowing sea of ochre-yellow sand.</p>

  <p>He scrambled to his feet, and as he did so, something clanked at his side.
  Two straight-bladed weapons hung there, both sheathed in a gray metal that
  resembled aluminum. One, he judged, was a Martian dagger, and the other a
  sword. The hilt of the larger weapon was fashioned of a metal of the color of
  brass, the pommel representing a serpent&rsquo;s head, the grip, its body,
  and the guard, the continuation of the body and tail coiled in the form of a
  figure eight. The hilt of the dagger was like that of the sword, but
  smaller.</p>

  <p>Thorne drew the sword from its sheath. The steel blade was slender and
  two-edged, and tapered to a needlelike point. Both edges were armed with tiny
  razor-sharp teeth which he instantly saw would add greatly to its
  effectiveness as a cutting weapon. He tested its balance and found he could
  wield it as easily as any duelling sword he had ever had in his hand.</p>

  <p>Replacing the sword in the sheath, he examined the dagger, and found it
  also edged with tiny teeth. The blade of this weapon was about ten inches in
  length.</p>

  <p>Depending from the belt on the other side, and heavy enough to balance the
  weight of the sword and dagger, was a mace with a short brazen handle and a
  disk-shaped head of steel which was fastened fanwise on the haft, thick at
  the middle and tapering out at the edges to sawlike teeth, much coarser and
  longer than those on sword or dagger.</p>

  <p>Thorne turned his attention to his apparel. He was wearing a breechclout
  of soft leather. Beneath this, and down to the center of his shins, his limbs
  were bare and considerably sunburned. Below this point were the rolled tops
  of a pair of long boots, made from fur and fitted with clasps which were
  obviously for the purpose of attaching them to the bottom of the breechclout
  when they were drawn up.</p>

  <p>Above the waist his sun-tanned body was bare of clothing, but he wore a
  pair of broad metal armlets, a pair of bracelets with long bars attached,
  evidently to protect the forearm from sword cuts, and a jewelled medallion,
  suspended on his chest from a chain around his neck and inscribed with
  strange characters.</p>

  <p>On his head was a bundle of silky material with a short, soft nap, rolled
  much like a turban and held in place by one brass-studded strap that passed
  around his forehead, and another that went beneath his chin.</p>

  <p>Beyond a large sand dune, and not more than a quarter of a mile distant,
  he saw the waving bellshaped crowns of a small grove of trees similar to the
  one that sheltered him. He started toward the clump of conifers.</p>

  <p>As soon as he stepped out into the blaze of the midday sun, Thorne began
  to feel uncomfortably warm. Soon he noted other signs of Martian life.
  Immense, gaudily tinted butterflies, some with wing spreads of more than six
  feet, flew up from the flower patches at his approach. A huge dragon fly
  zoomed past, looking much like a miniature airplane.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he heard an angry hum beside him, and felt a searing pain in his
  left side. Seemingly out of nowhere a fly, yellow and red in color and about
  two feet in length, had darted down upon him and plunged its many-pointed
  proboscis into his flesh. Seizing the sharp bill of his assailant, he
  wrenched it from his side.</p>

  <p>The insect buzzed violently but Thorne, still clinging to its bill,
  reached for his dagger with the other hand and cut off its head. Flinging the
  hideous thing at the body, he caught up a handful of sand to stanch the
  bleeding of his wound. Presently, he started forward once more.</p>

  <p>He was nearing the top of the dune when he saw, coming over the ridge from
  the other side, a most singular figure. At first glance it looked much like a
  walking umbrella. Then it resolved itself into a man wearing a long
  loose-sleeved cloak which covered him from the crown of his head to his
  knees. Below the cloak the end of a scabbard was visible, as were a pair of
  rolled fur boots like those worn by Thorne. The face was covered with a mask
  of flexible transparent material.</p>

  <p>Thorne stopped, and instinctively his hand went to his sword hilt.</p>

  <p>The other halted, also, at a distance of about ten paces, and swept off
  his mask. His face was smooth shaven and his hair and eyebrows were
  white.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have the honor of being the first man to welcome you to Mars.
  Harry Thorne,&rdquo; he said in English, and smilingly added: &ldquo;I am Lal
  Vak.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thorne returned his smile. &ldquo;Thank you, Lal Vak. You speak excellent
  English.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I learned your language from Dr. Morgan, just as he learned mine
  from me. Aural impressions are as readily transmitted by telepathy as visual
  impressions, you know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So the doctor informed me,&rdquo; said Thorne. &ldquo;But where do
  we go from here? I&rsquo;m beginning to feel uncomfortable in this
  sun.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been inexcusably thoughtless,&rdquo; apologized Lal Vak.
  &ldquo;Here, let me show you how to adjust your headcloak.&rdquo; Reaching up
  to Thorne&rsquo;s turban like headpiece, he loosened a strap. The silky
  material instantly fell down about the Earthman, reaching to his knees. A
  flexible, transparent mask also unrolled, and Lal Vak showed him how to draw
  it across his face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This material,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is made from the skin of a
  large moth. The people of Xancibar, the nation of which you are now a
  citizen, use these cloaks much for summer wear, particularly when traveling
  in the desert. They keep out the sun&rsquo;s rays by day, and keep in
  considerable warmth at night. As you will learn, even our summer nights are
  quite cold. The mask is made from the same material, but is treated with oil
  and has the nap scraped off to make it transparent.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I feel better already,&rdquo; said Thorne. &ldquo;Now
  what?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now we will get our mounts, and fly back to the military training
  school, which you, as Borgen Takkor, must continue to attend. At the school I
  am an instructor in tactics.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>As they approached the small clump of trees which Thorne had previously
  noticed, he saw that they surrounded a small pool of water. Splashing about
  in this pool were two immense winged creatures, and Thorne noted with
  astonishment that they were covered with brown fur instead of feathers. They
  had long, sturdy legs, covered with yellow scales. Their wings were
  membranous, and their bills were flat, much like those of ducks, except that
  they had sharp, down-curved hooks at the end. And when one opened its mouth,
  Thorne saw that it was furnished with sharp, triangular teeth, tilted
  backward. These immense beast-birds, whose backs were about seven feet above
  the ground, and whose heads reached to a height of about twelve feet, were
  saddled with seats of gray metal.</p>

  <p>The tips of each creature&rsquo;s wings were perforated, and tethered to
  the saddle by means of snap-hooks and short chains, evidently to prevent
  their taking to the air without their riders.</p>

  <p>Lal Vak made a peculiar sound, a low quavering call. Instantly both of the
  grotesque mounts answered with hoarse honking sounds and came floundering up
  out of the water toward them. One of them, on coming up to Thorne, arched its
  neck then lowered its head and nuzzled him violently with its broad bill.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Scratch his head,&rdquo; said Lal Vak, with an amused smile.
  &ldquo;Borgen made quite a pet of him, and you are now Borgen Takkor to
  him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>After a second prod from the huge beak, Thorne hastily scratched the
  creature&rsquo;s head, whereupon it held still, blinking contentedly, and
  making little guttural noises in its throat. He noticed that there was a
  light strand of twisted leather around its neck, fastened to the end of a
  flexible rod, which in turn was fastened to the ringshaped pommel of the
  saddle.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is that the steering gear?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have guessed right, my friend,&rdquo; replied Lal Vak.
  &ldquo;Pull up on the rod, and the gawr will fly upward. Push down and he
  will descend. A pull to the right or left and he will fly, walk or swim in
  the direction indicated according to whether he is in the air, on the ground,
  or in the water. Pull straight backward, and he will stop or
  hover.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sounds easy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is quite simple. But before we go, let me warn you to speak to
  no one, whether you are spoken to or not. Salute those who greet you,
  thus.&rdquo; He raised his left hand to the level of his forehead, with the
  palm backward. &ldquo;I must get you to your room as quickly as possible.
  There you will feign illness, and I will teach you our language before you
  venture out.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But how can I remember all the friends and acquaintances of
  Borg&mdash;Borgen Takkor. What a name! Suppose something should come
  up&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve provided against all that. Your illness will be blamed
  for your temporary loss of memory. This will give you time to find out
  things, and the right to ask questions rather than answer them. But, come, it
  grows late. Watch me carefully, and do as I do.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lal Vak tugged at a folded wing, and his mount knelt. Then he climbed into
  the saddle and unfastened the snap-hooks which tethered the wings, hooking
  them through two rings in his own belt. Thorne imitated his every movement,
  and was soon in the saddle.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Lal Vak, &ldquo;slap your gawr on the neck and
  pull up on the rod. He&rsquo;ll do the rest.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thorne did as directed, and his mount responded with alacrity. It ran
  swiftly forward for about fifty feet, then with a tremendous flapping of its
  huge, membranous wings, it took off, lurching violently at first, so that the
  Earthman was compelled to seize the saddle pommel in order to keep from
  falling off.</p>

  <p>After he had reached a height of about two thousand feet, Lal Vak relaxed
  the lift on his guiding rod and settled down to a straightaway flight. Thorne
  kept close behind him.</p>

  <p>When they had flown for what Thorne judged was a distance of about
  twenty-five miles, he noticed ahead of them a number of cylindrical buildings
  of various sizes, with perfectly flat roofs, built around a small lake, or
  lagoon. The oasis on which it was situated had a man-made look, as both it
  and the lagoon it encircled were perfectly square. The cylindrical buildings
  and the high wall surrounding the square enclosure shone in the sunlight like
  burnished metal.</p>

  <p>Rising from and descending to the shores of the lagoon were a number of
  riders mounted on gawrs. And as they drew near, there flew up from the
  inclosure a mighty airship.</p>

  <p>No passengers were visible, but a number of small round windows in the
  sides of the body indicated their positions.</p>

  <p>Lal Vak&rsquo;s mount now circled and then volplaned straight toward the
  margin of the lagoon. Thorne&rsquo;s gawr followed. As it alighted with a
  scarcely perceptible jar, an attendant came running up, saluted Thorne by
  raising his hand, palm-inward, to the level of his forehead, and took charge
  of his mount, making it kneel by tugging at one wing.</p>

  <p>Thorne returned the salute and seeing that Lal Vak had dismounted,
  followed his example. As he stood on his feet a sudden dizziness assailed
  him. He braced himself to walk away with Lal Vak as if there were nothing the
  matter.</p>

  <p>The scientist led him toward one of the smaller buildings, which Thorne
  now saw were made of blocks of a translucent material like clouded amber,
  cemented together with some transparent product.</p>

  <p>As they were about to enter the circular door of the building, two men
  came hurrying out, and one lunged heavily against Thorne. Harry suppressed a
  groan with difficulty, for the fellow&rsquo;s elbow had come in violent
  contact with his wound.</p>

  <p>Instantly the man who had jostled him, a huge fellow with a flat nose,
  beetling brows and a prognathous jaw, turned and spoke rapidly to him, his
  hand on his sword hilt.</p>

  <p>Lal Vak whispered in Thorne&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;This is regrettable. The
  fellow claims you purposely jostled him, and challenges you to a duel. You
  must fight, or be forever branded a coward.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Must I fight him here and now?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Here and now. Doctor Morgan told me you were a good swordsman. That
  is fortunate, for this fellow is a notorious killer.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Both men drew their swords simultaneously. Thorne endeavored to raise his
  blade to engage that of his adversary, but found he was without strength. His
  sword dropped from nerveless fingers and clattered to the pavement.</p>

  <p>A sardonic grin came to the face of his opponent. Then he contemptuously
  raised his weapon and slashed the Earthman&rsquo;s cheek with the keen,
  saw-edged blade.</p>

  <p>For an instant Thorne felt that searing pain. Then he pitched forward on
  his face and all went black.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

  <p class="first">THORNE woke to a weirdly beautiful sight. Two full moons
  were shining down on him from a black sky in which the stars sparkled like
  brilliant jewels. He was lying on a bed which was suspended by four chains on
  a single large flexible cable which depended from the ceiling, and had his
  view of the sky through a large circular window.</p>

  <p>He turned on his side, the better to look around him, and as he did so,
  saw Lal Vak seated on a legless chair suspended, like his bed, on a single
  cable which was fastened to the ceiling.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hello, Lal Vak,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I regret to inform you that you are in disgrace. If you had told
  me, before the duel, that you were weak from loss of blood, I could have
  delayed the meeting. It was only after I had brought you here that I
  discovered your wound, and by that time the news had gone about that you were
  afraid - that you had dropped your sword when faced by Sel Han.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sel Han! Why, that&rsquo;s the man Doctor Morgan wanted me to
  kill!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The same. On Earth he was Frank Boyd, a robber of mines and a
  jumper of claims, so the doctor informed me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll challenge Sel Han as soon as I&rsquo;m up and around
  again. That ought to square everything, and if I win, why, the first part of
  my mission will have been accomplished.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Unfortunately,&rdquo; replied the scientist, &ldquo;that will be
  impossible. According to our Martian code, it would be unethical for you,
  under any circumstances, to provoke another duel with Sel Han. He, on the
  other hand, may insult or humiliate you all he likes, so long as he uses no
  physical violence, and does not have to stand challenge from you, for he is
  technically the victor.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then what am I to do?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That will rest with Sheb Takkor. As Borgen Takkor, you are, of
  course, son of Sheb, the Rad of Takkor. If he were to die, your name would
  become Sheb. As it is, you are the Zorad of Takkor. Zorad, in your language,
  might be translated viscount, and Rad, earl. The titles, of course, no longer
  have meaning, except that they denote noble blood, as the Swarm has changed
  all that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Swarm?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lal Vak nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can think of no other English equivalent for our word Kamud. The
  Kamud is the new order of government which took control of Xancibar about ten
  Martian years, or nearly nineteen Earth years ago. At that time, like other
  Martian vilets, or empires, of the present day, we had a Vil, or emperor.
  Although his office was hereditary, he could be deposed at any time by the
  will of the people, and a new Vil elected.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For the most part, our people were satisfied. But there suddenly
  rose into power a man named Irintz Tel. He taught that an ideal community
  could be attained by imitating the communal life of the black bees. Under his
  system the individuals exist for the benefit of the community, not the
  community for the befit of the individuals.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Irintz Tel did not gather many followers, but those who flocked to
  his banner were vociferous and vindictive. At length, they decided to
  establish their form of government by force. Hearing this, Miradon, our Vil,
  abdicated rather than see his people involved in a civil war. He could have
  crushed the upstart, of course, but many lives would have been lost, and he
  preferred the more peaceful way.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;As soon as Miradon Vil was gone, Irintz Tel and his henchmen seized
  the reins of government in Dukor, the capital of Xancibar. After considerable
  fighting, he established the Kamud, which now owns all land, buildings,
  waterways, mines and commercial enterprises within our borders. He promised
  us annual elections, but once he was firmly established as Dixtar of
  Xancibar, this promise was repudiated. Theoretically, like all other
  citizens, Irintz Tel owns nothing except his personal belongings. But
  actually, he owns and controls all of Xancibar in the name of the Kamud, and
  has the absolute power of life and death over every citizen.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What do people think of this arrangement?&rdquo; asked Thorne.
  &ldquo;Do they submit to such tyranny?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They have no choice,&rdquo; replied Lal Vak. &ldquo;Irintz Tel
  rules with an iron hand. His spies are everywhere. And those detected
  speaking against his regime are quickly done away with.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Some are executed, charged with some trumped-up offense, usually
  treason to the Kamud. Men in high places are often challenged and slain by
  Irintz Tel&rsquo;s hired swordsmen. Others are sent to the mines, which means
  that they will not live long. I will leave you, now. You must
  sleep.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My wounds - I had forgotten them.&rdquo; Thorne raised his hand to
  his face where the sword of Sel Han had slashed him. He felt no soreness,
  only a porous pumicelike protrusion traveling the length of the gash. The
  wound in his side was covered with a similar substance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I had them dressed as soon as you were brought here,&rdquo; said
  the scientist. &ldquo;They should not pain you, now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t. And what a strange dressing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is rjembal, a flexible aromatic gum which is antiseptic,
  protects the wound from infection, and is porous enough to absorb seepage.
  Wounds closed with this gum usually heal quickly, painlessly, and without
  leaving scars.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I go now. Sleep well, and tomorrow I will come to give you your
  first lesson in our language.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>* * *</p>

  <p>Early the next morning Thorne was awakened. He saw the white-haired Lal
  Vak smiling down at him. Behind him stood an orderly, who carried a large
  bowl which he placed on a tripod beside the bed. The orderly saluted and
  withdrew.</p>

  <p>The bowl was divided into sections like a scooped-out grapefruit. In one
  section reposed several slices of grilled food. In another was a whole raw
  fruit, purple in color, and cubical in shape. In the third was a hollow cube
  containing an aromatic pink beverage.</p>

  <p>Thorne sampled one of the grilled slices. The flavor baffled him, as it
  did not appear to be either flesh or vegetable. Having finished the strange
  grilled food, he tasted the pink beverage. It was slightly bitter and about
  as acid as a ripe orange. A sip sent an instant glow through his veins.
  &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this stuff?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Puho. A single cup is stimulating, but many are
  intoxicating.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thorne finished the beverage, and Lal Vak instantly set about teaching him
  the things he must know in order to establish himself as Borgen Takkor.</p>

  <p>Although Thorne&rsquo;s wounds healed in a few days, Lal Vak used them as
  a pretense to keep him in his room for about twenty. The Earthman learned the
  language quickly, for stored in the braincells of the Martian body which had
  become his were the recollections of all the sounds and their meanings.</p>

  <p>One day an orderly came to announce that there was a man below calling
  himself Yirl Du, who asked to see Sheb Takkor.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let him come up,&rdquo; said Lal Vak. When the orderly had gone out
  he said to Thorne: &ldquo;You heard what he said? He asked for Sheb
  Takkor.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. What does it mean?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It means that Sheb Takkor, father of Borgen Takkor, is dead. Hence,
  you are Sheb Takkor. This is one of the Takkor retainers who knows you, so
  call him by name when he appears before us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A moment later, a short, stocky man entered the room. His features were
  coarse, but kindly. He raised one huge hand in salute, saying: &ldquo;I
  shield my eyes, my lord Sheb, Rad of Takkor.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thorne smiled and returned his salute. &ldquo;Greetings, Yirl Du. This is
  my instructor, Lal Vak.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shield my eyes, excellency.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You forget that under the Kamud all men are equal,&rdquo; said Lal
  Vak, returning his salute, &ldquo;and one man no longer says to another:
  &lsquo;I shield my eyes,&rsquo; &lsquo;my lord,&rsquo; or
  &lsquo;excellency.&rsquo; &ldquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do not forget that I am hereditary Jen of the Takkor Free
  Swordsmen, nor that Sheb Takkor is my liege. From our isolated position, we
  of Takkor know little of the Kamud. We have submitted to it because our Rad,
  emulating Miradon Vil, saw fit to do so. So long as Takkor Rad rules us,
  though he is only the agent of the Kamud, we are content, and life goes on
  much as usual.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have come to escort your new Rad back to Takkor, I
  presume.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is my purpose, excellency.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then suppose you see about the gawrs while we make ready for the
  journey. I will accompany your Rad, and spend a few days with him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I go, excellency.&rdquo; Yirl Du saluted and withdrew.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Strange,&rdquo; said Thorne, when he had gone. &ldquo;He said
  nothing about the death of Sheb Takkor, the elder.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;His words conveyed the tidings,&rdquo; said Lal Vak. &ldquo;A dead
  man&rsquo;s friends or relatives must not speak of him nor of his death until
  his ashes have been ceremonially scattered.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When will that take place?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Upon your arrival. As his son and successor, you should be present
  at the ceremony. When it is completed, you may talk as freely as you
  like.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>While they were talking both men had belted on their weapons and adjusted
  their head-cloaks. They descended to the courtyard and crossed to the lagoon,
  where Yirl Du waited with three gawrs attended by orderlies.</p>

  <p>Lal Vak edged close to him. Watch Yirl Du and me, and set your course as
  we do,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;You will be supposed to lead but as you
  don&rsquo;t know the way you will have to depend on one or the other of us
  for guidance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In a few moments all was in readiness. The three ungainly mounts trotted
  forward, spread their membranous wings and took to the air.</p>

  <p>By glancing right and left at his two companions, Thorne was easily able
  to gauge their course, and steer his bird-beast accordingly. They set out in
  a direction which he judged was due west.</p>

  <p>Then, far ahead, Thorne saw a straight, high wall which stretched as far
  as he could see to the north and south. It was constructed of black stone,
  and at intervals of about a half mile towers built from the same material
  projected above it. The aqueduct which they were following led straight up to
  and entered this wall. As they drew near it, armed men became visible,
  patrolling the battlements.</p>

  <p>Soon Thorne was able to catch a glimpse of what lay beyond the wall. First
  there was the glint of water in a broad canal, then the rich green of
  luxuriant vegetation, dotted here and there with the gleam of cylindrical
  crystal dwellings, and sloping in a series of terraces to a much wider canal
  than the first. Beyond this in the dim distance another series of terraces
  ascended to another elevated canal as high as the first, flanked by a wall
  like the one over which they were flying.</p>

  <p>Beyond the second wall they encountered desert once more, and for several
  hours continued their flight toward the west. Then the contour of the ground
  beneath them changed abruptly. It was as if they were on the shore of a vast
  ocean from which the water had suddenly evaporated. First they passed over
  rugged cliffs, then a gently sloping beach strewn with sand and boulders.
  This presently dipped sharply to what was now a marshy lowland, a vast
  expanse of shallow water dotted and streaked with patches of green
  vegetation.</p>

  <p>So absorbed was Thorne that he did not notice the menace that had crept
  silently up behind him. A shout from Lal Vak and a backward gesture caused
  him to turn in time to see a cloaked and masked warrior mounted on a swiftly
  flying gawr in the act of hurling a javelin at him. Behind his assailant he
  caught a fleeting glimpse of four more riders. He dodged just in time to
  avoid the barbed weapon. As it whizzed past him he whirled his gawr, then
  seized one of his own javelins and hurled it at his attacker.</p>

  <p>The rider avoided Thorne&rsquo;s shaft with ease, and in a moment more was
  above him with drawn sword. Thorne whipped out his own weapon, parried a
  vicious head- cut, and countered with a swift slash at the neck of his
  assailant. The blow fell true, nearly severing the fellow&rsquo;s head from
  his body.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, Lal Vak and Yirl Du were engaged in a lively conflict.
  Thorne saw the powerful Jen of the Free Swordsmen hurl a javelin with such
  force that it passed completely through the body of his nearest enemy. Lal
  Vak was fighting a sword duel with another of the attackers. The two who
  remained each sought a single encounter, one with Yirl Du and the other with
  Thorne.</p>

  <p>The Earthman&rsquo;s new assailant hurled a javelin which fell short. He
  reached for another, and drew it back for a throw just as Thorne hurled his
  weapon mightily. The fellow tried to throw and dodge at the same time. He
  ducked low, but not low enough. Thorne&rsquo;s javelin struck him in the eye.
  His own weapon flew wide of the mark, but struck a wingjoint of the
  Earthman&rsquo;s mount. A moment later Thorne found himself out of the saddle
  dangling by his safety chains, while his crippled gawr, fluttering futilely
  with its uninjured wing, turned over and over in the air as they hurtled
  swiftly toward the marsh, two thousand feet below.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

  <p class="first">AS his bird-beast turned over and over with him in the air,
  Thorne, swinging at the ends of his safety chains, saw that they were falling
  toward a small lake in the midst of the marsh with fearful velocity. As they
  neared the water the crippled gawr made valiant efforts to right itself, and
  managed to change the last few hundred feet to a glide and a dive. They
  struck the water with an impact that almost robbed Thorne of consciousness.
  Dimly aware that he was being dragged down far below the surface of the lake,
  he held his breath, unhooked his safety chains, unfastened his belt and let
  his weapons sink. Then he fought his way swiftly to the top.</p>

  <p>For some time the Earthman was too busy getting his breath to take note of
  his surroundings. Then he looked around for his mount, and saw it swimming
  directly away from him. Although the gawr was moving at a speed which he
  could not possibly hope to equal, he was about to set out in futile pursuit
  when a huge and terrible reptilian head suddenly reared itself between them,
  a scaly, silver gray head balanced on a thin, spiny neck. The monster looked
  first at the retreating gawr, then at the man, and began gliding swiftly
  toward him.</p>

  <p>It was manifest from the start that he could not hope to outstrip his
  fearful aquatic enemy. As he forged ahead he glanced back from time to time,
  and saw that the monster was swiftly gaining on him.</p>

  <p>With the shore but two hundred feet distant, he felt his last ounce of
  strength ebbing. Then just ahead of him he noticed a tiny ripple in the
  water, and there emerged a pair of jaws like those of a crocodile, but larger
  than those of any crocodile he had ever seen or heard of. There followed a
  broad, flat head, and thick neck, both covered with glossy fur, the head
  black, the neck ringed with a bright yellow band.</p>

  <p>Hemmed thus between the two aquatic monsters, he plunged beneath the
  surface and dived under the oncoming beast, remaining under water until
  compelled to return to the surface for air.</p>

  <p>When he had shaken the water out of his eyes, Thorne saw that the two
  monsters had met, and were engaged in a terrific struggle. The silver-gray
  scales of the one which had been following him flashed in the sun as it
  endeavored to shake off its smaller adversary which had seized it by the
  lower lip.</p>

  <p>Suddenly it reared its head until the black-furred creature was drawn
  completely out of the water, and he saw that the latter was a web-footed
  animal about as large as a full-grown terrestrial lion, with short legs and a
  leathery, paddle-shaped tail which was edged with sharp spines. With the
  exception of the tail and claws, the body was covered with fur.</p>

  <p>Thorne expected to see the smaller creature instantly slain. Instead, with
  a speed his eye could scarcely follow, it avoided the lunge of that terrible
  head, and turning, seized the slender, stalklike neck of its adversary in its
  own relatively large jaws. One powerful crunch, and the battle was over.</p>

  <p>So absorbed had he been in this strange battle that Thorne had momentarily
  forgotten the peril that menaced him. Now, as the victor turned from the
  carcass of its vanquished enemy and swam straight toward him, he struck out
  for the shore, essaying the fast overhand stroke he had previously used on
  the surface, but his weary muscles had reached the limit of their endurance.
  Better death by drowning than in those horrible jaws. He filled his lungs and
  dived. At a depth of about fifteen feet he found a large water plant to which
  he clung with his last remaining strength.</p>

  <p>But it seemed he was not even to be given his choice of deaths. Suddenly
  he became aware of a dark object in the green water above him. Then a huge
  pair of jaws closed around his waist, and with a deft twist, broke his hold
  on the water plant. A moment later he was lifted clear of the water.</p>

  <p>The creature was carrying him swiftly toward the shore. He guessed that
  the monster was taking him to its lair, but on looking up, saw that it was
  heading directly toward the mouth of a narrow bayou. There, to his
  astonishment, he saw a small, flat boat, and standing in the boat a slender
  girl, who cried, &ldquo;Good old Tezzu. Careful! Hold him gently.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thorne&rsquo;s astonishment increased, for it was obvious that the girl
  was talking to the creature that carried him. Moreover, he assumed from her
  speech that she had sent this monster out to save his life.</p>

  <p>The stern of the little craft sloped toward the water, and it was to this
  that the animal brought him. The girl seized a leg and an arm, and her
  efficient beast placed its snout beneath his body and rolled him into the
  boat.</p>

  <p>Thorne essayed to sit up, but fell back weakly. Dimly, as through a haze,
  he saw the girl toss a rope to the beast, then felt the tug as the boat was
  towed ahead. The girl sat down, raised his head from the bottom of the boat
  and propped it in her lap.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who - who are you?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>She seemed surprised. &ldquo;You do not know me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He stared hard. &ldquo;I can scarcely see you. That
  haze&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try. Close your eyes and try to sleep. Later we will
  talk.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was easy for Thorne to obey her. It was good to lie there and relax
  with that gentle hand on his forehead.</p>

  <p>Presently, opening his eyes, he saw that they were gliding through a
  narrow channel in the marsh. Trees hung over the water, their branches so
  interlaced and festooned with moss and lianas that only occasional shafts of
  sunlight penetrated to the surface.</p>

  <p>Thorne glanced up at the girl. By any standard she was unquestionably
  beautiful, with her slightly tip-tilted nose, her glossy black hair, and her
  dark brown eyes shaded by long curling lashes. Though she was small and
  slender she was undoubtedly athletic. Her sole articles of apparel were a
  narrow band of soft leather which incased her small, firm breasts, a cincture
  of the same material about her smooth, tanned thighs, and the belt from which
  her sword, dagger and mace were suspended.</p>

  <p>It was when he caught a glimpse of the clear sky through a rift in the
  branches that Thorne suddenly thought of Lal Vak and Yirl Du. He sat up
  abruptly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; the girl asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I must go back at once.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The girl looked puzzled. &ldquo;Back? How? Where? What do you
  mean?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Back to the lake where I left my friends fighting. If they survived
  they will be searching for me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She shook her head. &ldquo;It is too late. As it is we will barely make
  shelter before sundown. Tomorrow, if you like, I will take you
  back.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But tomorrow will be too late. They will think me dead.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then, Borgen, they will be the more pleasantly surprised when you
  return to Castle Takkor.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not Borgen, Sheb.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>For a moment she regarded him with a look of shocked surprise. Then sudden
  tears swelled in her eyes. &ldquo;Has the ceremony been performed?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. I was on my way to attend it with Lal Vak and Yirl Du when we
  were attacked, and you rescued me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thorne now realized that she must have been very well acquainted with Sheb
  Takkor the elder, and that she undoubtedly knew far more about the man whose
  place he had taken than he did himself. He wondered what her relationship had
  been with Borgen Takkor.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the girl seized a long, barbed spear which lay in the bottom of
  the boat, and lunged at something she saw in the rushes. Then, before Thorne
  could rise to help her, she drew a huge iridescent beetle about three feet
  long into the boat. Plunging the point of the spear into the planking to keep
  it from escaping, she then put an end to the impaled insect&rsquo;s struggles
  by splitting its armored head with her mace. This done, she turned to the
  Earth man with a smile.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We will fare well this evening. Now I can prepare your favorite
  dish.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thorne looked askance at the beetle and began to have misgivings as to
  what his favorite dish would be like.</p>

  <p>At this moment the beast towing the boat ran up on a small island,
  dragging it after him onto a sloping beach that bore the marks of many
  landings.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Enough, Tezzu,&rdquo; called the girl. The creature dropped the
  tow-rope and came cavorting down to the boat like an affectionate dog, to be
  petted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You may bring the anuba, Sheb,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;Tezzu
  will carry the javelins.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thorne judged that the anuba was the beetle. He withdrew the point of the
  spear from the planking while the girl handed the sheaf of javelins to her
  beast, then shouldered the heavy insect and followed her up a narrow path
  that wound through the undergrowth.</p>

  <p>After walking about two hundred feet they came to a small cylindrical hut,
  made from stout posts driven into the ground in a compact circle and chinked
  with clay. The flat roof was made from the same crude materials, and the
  circular door was a thick cross section of an immense log.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember this camp, Sheb?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; Thorne was trying to frame a reply when, to his
  astonishment, the door flew open. A slender, spidery arm shot out and seized
  the girl by the wrist, jerking her through the opening. Then the door slammed
  shut.</p>

  <p>Almost at the same instant a net dropped over the Earthman, jerking him
  backward. As he struggled in its enveloping meshes, he saw Tezzu drop the
  sheaf of javelins and with a roar of rage dash straight at the door where she
  had disappeared.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

  <p class="first">THORNE was still carrying the beetle over his shoulder,
  hanging on the long spear. He thrust upward with the spear. The beetle
  prevented it from slipping through the meshes, and with the long handle he
  was able to raise the net and pitch it back over his head.</p>

  <p>Scarcely had he freed himself when he saw descending from the branches of
  the surrounding trees six grotesque specimens of humanity. Not one of them
  was more than five feet tall. Their skins were bright yellow in color, and
  their spindly arms and legs branched out from bodies that were almost
  globular. Their Mongoloid features were surmounted by queer pagoda-shaped
  helmets of yellow metal and their bodies were protected by armor.</p>

  <p>As they converged on him, shouting wildly, they brandished long, slightly
  curved swords with blunt ends, small oval guards and hilts long enough to be
  grasped in both hands.</p>

  <p>Thorne ran his nearest foe through with the long spear which still held
  the carcass of the anuba beetle. The barbed point stuck, leaving him
  weaponless for the instant. Then he leaped forward, seized the sword dropped
  by his fallen enemy, and came on guard in time to meet the attack of the
  next.</p>

  <p>Swiftly parrying a lightning cut at his legs which would instantly have
  laid him at the mercy of his attackers, he countered with a sudden moulinet
  which sheared down through the left shoulder of his second adversary,
  inflicting a mortal wound.</p>

  <p>The four that remained seemed taken aback by this display of the
  Earthman&rsquo;s swordplay, and now approached him more warily. They were
  closing in on him from all sides when Tezzu gave up his attempts to tear down
  the door of the hut and suddenly rushed to Thorne&rsquo;s assistance.</p>

  <p>A leap, a crunch of those powerful jaws, and one foeman fell with his head
  crushed. At the same time Thorne&rsquo;s sword disemboweled another of his
  antagonists. With shrieks of terror, the two survivors turned and fled. But
  the beast, despite its short legs, pursued them with incredible swiftness.
  One went down with his head between those relentless jaws and the last,
  catching a liana, scampered up for a little way only to be pulled down and as
  swiftly dispatched.</p>

  <p>Thorne now rushed to the door of the hut and flung himself against it, but
  it remained immovable. Inside he heard the sound of clashing blades. A moment
  later he heard the inner bolt slide back and the door was flung open.</p>

  <p>He was about to spring through the opening when he saw the girl framed in
  the doorway, dagger in one hand and sword in the other, both dripping blood.
  Behind her, barely visible in the dim light of the interior, lay one dead and
  one dying foeman.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why - why, I thought&hellip;&rdquo; stammered Thorne, lowering his
  point.</p>

  <p>The girl smiled amusedly and stepped out of the hut. &ldquo;So you
  believed these clumsy Ma Gongi had cut me down. Really, Sheb, I gave you
  credit for a better memory. Have you forgotten the many times Thaine&rsquo;s
  blade has bested yours?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So her name is Thaine, mused Thorne. Aloud he said: &ldquo;Your
  demonstration has been most convincing. Yet I have not lost my ambition to
  improve my swordsmanship, and I should be grateful for further
  instruction.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No better time than now. Still, I have you at a disadvantage, since
  you hold an inferior weapon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is a handicap which a man should accord a girl,&rdquo; Thorne
  replied.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not one this girl requires.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She sheathed her dagger and extended her blade. Thorne engaged it with his
  captured weapon which, though more heavy and clumsy, was smewhat similar to a
  saber.</p>

  <p>He instantly found that he had to deal with the swiftest and most
  dexterous fencer he had ever encountered, and time after time he barely saved
  himself from being touched.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It seems your stay at the military school has improved your
  swordsmanship,&rdquo; said the girl, cutting, thrusting, and parrying easily
  - almost effortlessly. &ldquo;In the old days I would have touched you long
  ere this. Yet, you but prolong the inevitable.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The inevitable,&rdquo; replied Thorne, &ldquo;is sometimes
  perceptible only by deity. For instance, this&rdquo; - beating sharply on her
  blade, then catching it on his with a rotary motion - &ldquo;has often been
  known to end a conflict.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Wrenched from her grasp by his impetuous attack, her sword went spinning
  into the undergrowth.</p>

  <p>Instead of taking her defeat badly, Thaine actually beamed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have developed into a real swordsman, old comrade! I am so glad
  I could almost kiss you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; Thorne answered, recovering her weapon for her,
  &ldquo;is a reward which should fire any man to supreme endeavor.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is evident that you have mastered courtly speech as well as
  fencing. And now I will prepare your favorite dish for you.&rdquo; She called
  the brute. &ldquo;Here, Tezzu,&rdquo; indicating the bodies. &ldquo;Take
  these away.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thorne marveled at its intelligence, when it instantly took up one of the
  corpses.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A smart beast, that,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He is the most intelligent of all my father&rsquo;s dalfs.
  That&rsquo;s why I always take him with me when I hunt.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>While Tezzu carried the bodies away and dropped them into the stream,
  Thaine took her mace and chopped off the two thick hind legs of the beetle.
  From these, she lopped the thighs, and splitting the shells open, extracted
  two cylinders of white meat. With her dagger she sliced these into small,
  round steaks, piling them neatly on a broad leaf, then carried it into the
  hut.</p>

  <p>Thorne followed her in. &ldquo;May I help?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like some water,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Fill the big
  jar, please.&rdquo; She indicated a large square jar which stood beside the
  mud fireplace over which she now bent, placing faggots on a small heap of
  charcoal.</p>

  <p>Thorne picked up the jar, and from its great weight was convinced that it
  was gold. He also noticed that the figures on the sides were of exquisite
  workmanship.</p>

  <p>When he returned with water from the stream, the interior of the hut had
  grown quite dark, but a shaft of moonlight lit up the lithe figure of the
  girl, kneeling before the fireplace. He went in and placed the jar beside
  her.</p>

  <p>Having arranged the faggots to her satisfaction, she took a small bottle
  of sparkling powder from a pouch attached to her belt, and emptied a few
  grains on the wood. Then, dipping a cup into the jar, she poured part of its
  contents on the powder. Thorne was amazed to see the powder and the
  surrounding wood wherever the water had touched it burst into instant
  flame.</p>

  <p>With the fire blazing merrily, the girl now dipped several cupfuls of
  water from the jar into a smaller container, dropped into it a handful of red
  berries taken from another jar, and set the mixture against the blaze. Then
  she arranged the steaks she had cut on a grill made from crossed metal
  rods.</p>

  <p>Tezzu came in, his immense mouth full of faggots, which he dropped beside
  her. Then he touched her elbow with his nose. She turned and patted his head.
  &ldquo;Good boy. Bring more.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Obediently the beast turned and trotted out into the moonlight.</p>

  <p>By the time the steaks were broiled, Tezzu had brought in a considerable
  quantity of wood. After removing her broiler, Thaine threw more fuel on the
  coals. From the vessel into which she had put the red berries she now filled
  two cubical golden cups with a steaming pink liquid. Then, using a wide leaf
  for a platter, she piled it high with the grilled steaks, set two other bits
  of leaf on the floor for plates. &ldquo;Come, Sheb. The banquet is ready for
  the victors.&rdquo; Thorne sat opposite her and took the steaming cup from
  her hand. He had guessed that the beverage it contained was pulcho, and a sip
  confirmed this. Then came the realization that the time had arrived for him
  to simulate a liking for his &ldquo;favorite dish.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is a banquet fit for a mighty conqueror,&rdquo; he said,
  reaching for one of the grilled steaks. He bit out a portion and instantly
  recognized the flavor. It was the same as that of the broiled food which had
  been served him for his first breakfast on Mars.</p>

  <p>He had noted a swift, curious glance on the part of Thaine, when she had
  seen him take up his steak in his hand. Now he saw that she used her dagger
  as a fork to convey a slice to her leaf-plate, and that she cut off a small
  piece which she raised to her mouth with her fingers.</p>

  <p>Obviously he had made a Martian social error.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the girl leaned forward. &ldquo;Just who are you, masquerading as
  Sheb Takkor?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>For a moment Thorne was speechless with surprise. Then he replied,
  &ldquo;Ever since I met you I have been wanting to tell you, but the
  consideration of a duty restrained me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A duty?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. To friends who helped me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And now, am I not&mdash;another friend who has helped
  you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Decidedly! Yet, I wonder if you will believe me. I can scarcely
  believe myself, that I am here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too sure that I would not believe. I know. You are -
  Hahr Ree Thorne, and you were born on the planet, Dhu Gong, which you call
  Earth.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How did you know that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Borgen told me what he was going to do,&rdquo; she replied.
  &ldquo;I did not believe it possible, but now I know. You are so different.
  And you do not understand some of our Martian customs.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For instance, my manner of eating? Pray tell me where I
  erred.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Having a dagger, you would have waited for me to take the first
  morsel,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Lacking it, you would wait for me to hand you
  mine, then use it as I used it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo; I have been a boor.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not at all. One cannot be expected to know the customs of a new
  world without some instruction.&rdquo; When both had eaten all they wanted,
  the remainder was tossed to the waiting dalf. Then the girl rose, closed and
  bolted the door, and selecting two large furs from a pile against the wall,
  gave one to the Earthman and spread the other on the floor before the
  fire.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is time for sleep,&rdquo; she said. Then, without another word,
  she lay down on the fur and drawing its folds about her, closed her eyes.</p>

  <p>As he spread his fur and rolled himself therein, he again mentally
  compared his former fiancée to the girl who slept calmly there beside him,
  and the comparison was overwhelmingly favorable to Thaine.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

  <p class="first">THORNE was awakened by a touch on his brow. He looked up
  into the eyes of Thaine.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We must begin our journey if you would make Castle Takkor by
  midday,&rdquo; she said.</p>

  <p>He threw off his fur and stood up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready,&rdquo; he
  announced.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;First we will eat,&rdquo; she told him.</p>

  <p>When they had finished, the girl began packing the utensils and furs
  together. Thorne helped her to make two large bundles of them, which Tezzu
  carried down to the boat.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Ma Gongi have discovered this camp,&rdquo; she told him,
  &ldquo;so it must be abandoned forever.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But where will you go?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have many better places hidden in the marsh,&rdquo; she replied.
  &ldquo;This was merely an outpost.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They gathered up the weapons and went outside. Then the girl poured a
  small quantity of the sparkling firepowder against the door jamb and dashed a
  cup of water over it. The logs instantly burst into flame, and when they
  reached the boat, Thorne, looking back, saw that a thick column of smoke was
  mounting skyward.</p>

  <p>The morning sun was, by this time, halfway to the zenith. Most of the ice
  had melted in the stream. He noted, also, that many of the leaves where the
  sun had not yet penetrated were coated with hoar-frost that was rapidly
  melting into glistening beads of dew.</p>

  <p>When they had their cargo stowed, and had taken their places, the girl
  tossed the tow-rope to Tezzu and indicated with a wave of her hand the
  direction she wished to go. He plunged into the stream and set off
  rapidly.</p>

  <p>They had only gone a short distance when Thaine cried: &ldquo;Look there!
  The boat of the Ma Gongi!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thorne looked in the direction she was pointing, and saw a flat boat drawn
  up on the bank.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stop, Tezzu,&rdquo; ordered the girl. Then: &ldquo;Bring us that
  boat.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The beast dropped the tow-rope, and swimming in to shore, dragged the boat
  into the water. Then, seizing its rope he towed it out to where they drifted.
  Save for a bundle, wrapped in a silky covering, and a half dozen spade-
  shaped paddles, the boat was empty. Thorne was about to reach for the bundle
  when the girl checked him. &ldquo;That is their food,&rdquo; she said,
  &ldquo;but it will do us no good.&rdquo; Then she called to the dalf.
  &ldquo;Sink it, Tezzu.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Instantly, the beast seized the side of the boat in his huge and powerful
  jaws. A single crunch crushed the heavy planking as if it had been an
  eggshell. Tezzu backed away, spitting out the slivers, and the boat filled
  and sank. Then he took up the tow-rope once more and proceeded on his
  way.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m curious to know more about these Ma Gongi,&rdquo; Thorne
  said, &ldquo;and this strange, forbidden food they eat.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Legend has it that they did not originate on this planet, but, as
  their name indicates, on Ma Gong, the planet which now circles your world,
  but which revolved in an orbit of its own, between your world and mine.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We know that there was once a mighty civilization here on Mars, and
  that it was destroyed in a terrible catastrophe. It is just within my
  lifetime that our scientists have begun to uncover old records - fragments of
  records - and piece them together. We know now that the catastrophe came
  about through an interplanetary war, fought with weapons almost beyond
  imagination. The Ma Gongi had a cold, energy-decreasing interrotating green
  ray. Any substance touched by this ray would contract to less than
  one-hundredth of its normal size, with a corresponding increase in
  density.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The toughest metals, under this ray, would become as brittle as
  glass and more dense than lead. But there is a limit to the contractile
  endurance of all matter, and once that limit is reached the atoms, which have
  been pushed in upon themselves, explode and disintegrate.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And did your scientists have this weapon, too?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We do not know. Ma Gong was shifted from its orbit to where it now
  lies, and it is believed that our two moons came from some aspect of the
  struggle, too. We know that Ma Gong itself was rendered uninhabitable and
  that our own world was greatly damaged. Some of the Ma Gongi must have been
  stranded on Mars when the war ended in mutual ruin.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Remarkable,&rdquo; said Thorne.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Ma Gongi are our enemies still,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;I
  have often seen them. But other than them, my father, the Takkors and Yirl
  Du, I have seen no one except the Little People.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Little People?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They are the friends and allies of my father and me. But the Ma
  Gongi eat them. That is why I told you the food you saw in their boat would
  be useless to us. It was the flesh of one of the Little People.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But who is your father, and why do you two live here in the marsh,
  instead of among your own kind?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My father&rsquo;s name is Miradon. Once he was Vil of Xancibar.
  There was a revolt, led by a man named Irintz Tel. In order to avoid the
  calamity of a civil war, my father abdicated, and fled here with me, aided by
  Sheb Takkor and the Jen of his Free Swordsmen, Yirl Du. These two, alone,
  knew where we had gone. Here my father reared me. We have been constantly
  harassed by the minions of Irintz Tel, and lately by the Ma Gongi as well.
  For three days, now, my father has been absent, and I fear that he has either
  been slain or captured.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then let me help you search for him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, you must return to the castle for the ceremony, or if it has
  been performed, to assume your rightful place. After that, come if you will,
  and bring Yirl Du, but no other. He will know how to find me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>For some time now they had been gliding tortuously through a chain of
  shallow pools connected by narrow, half-hidden channels. Now there suddenly
  came into view a broad lake which mirrored at its far side an immense castle
  of odd and beautiful design, the translucent masonry of which gleamed like
  burnished gold in the sunshine. A short distance from it, and also bordering
  the lake, rose the cylindrical, flat-roofed buildings of a teeming city. A
  large number of gawrs were swimming on the lake and many boats were moored at
  the docks.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This is as far as I dare take you,&rdquo; said Thaine.
  &ldquo;Yonder, beside Takkor City, lies Castle Takkor. You can reach it by
  following the lake shore to the right.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thorne rose and stretched his limbs, cramped from long sitting. Then he
  bent, took her hand and pressed it to his lips. She seemed startled.
  &ldquo;Why did you do that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;On my world it is homage one pays to a lady at greeting or
  parting.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What a queer custom,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;But I rather like
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thorne smiled. &ldquo;Farewell, little comrade,&rdquo; he said.
  &ldquo;Again I thank you for my life, for my entertainment, and most of all
  for the pleasure of having been with you. As soon as I have attended to my
  duties at Castle Takkor I will return with Yirl Du, and together we will
  search for your father.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Deza go with you, and keep you safe from harm. I will be waiting
  for you and be expecting you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Resolutely he turned away and stepped over the side of the boat. He stood
  there in the shallows watching until the little craft vanished around a bend
  in the narrow channel.</p>

  <p>Keeping to the margin of the lake, he eventually reached the docks without
  mishap. Most of its occupants were fishermen, and those whose duty it was to
  tend the gawrs. But he saw a number of warriors standing about, and was
  surprised to note that they wore the insigna of the Kamud. As he made his way
  toward the gate which led to the castle, two of them stopped him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where are you going, fellow?&rdquo; asked one. &ldquo;And whom do
  you seek?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I go to Castle Takkor,&rdquo; replied Thorne, &ldquo;and whom I
  seek is my own affair.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;None of your insolence,&rdquo; growled the other soldier.
  &ldquo;When you speak to us, you address the Kamud.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When you speak to me, you address the Rad of Takkor,&rdquo; Thorne
  retorted. &ldquo;Out of my way!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sharp words call for sharper weapons,&rdquo; said one soldier.
  &ldquo;Throw down your sword, or you die.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>For answer, Thorne came on guard. Then both men attacked him
  simultaneously. While he could easily have bested either of them alone, he
  was sorely put to it to keep the two blades from reaching him. Presently,
  however, one soldier left his head unguarded. Instantly Thorne&rsquo;s sword
  sheared down through his brain.</p>

  <p>For a moment Thorne&rsquo;s blade was held by that cloven skull; then,
  with a desperate jerk, he freed his weapon and easily disarmed his remaining
  foe, who instantly turned and fled, bawling lustily for help.</p>

  <p>At this juncture a big man, resplendent in purple head-cloak and gold
  trappings came down the steps that led from the castle gate, followed by a
  group of lesser officers and a file of soldiers.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this?&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;Must I have
  brawling on the first day of my arrival?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thorne looked up and recognized Sel Han, against whom the Martian code of
  honor now forbade him to raise his weapon. Instantly he was surrounded by
  warriors.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This imposter who murdered Tir Hanus claims to be the Rad of
  Takkor,&rdquo; cried the disarmed soldier, &ldquo;yet we scattered his ashes
  this morning.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sel Han looked at Thorne. &ldquo;You have heard the words of this
  soldier,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Do you still cling to your preposterous
  claim?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You scattered the ashes of Sheb Takkor the elder. Not
  mine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We also scattered the ashes of Sheb Takkor the younger,&rdquo;
  replied Sel Han. &ldquo;His two comrades, Lal Vak and Yirl Du, reported his
  death yesterday. He fell from his gawr, a distance that would crush him to
  pulp, therefore it is impossible that he could be alive today. Word was sent
  to Irintz Tel, and the Dixtar appointed me to administer the estates in the
  name of the Kamud. As we could not obtain the body of the unfortunate Rad,
  who fell in the marsh, we performed the ceremony by proxy, using ashes of the
  aromatic sebolis tree, as is the custom.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Am I to understand from this that I am officially dead?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are to understand from this that the Rad of Takkor is dead.
  Also, the title has been abolished. Hereafter the estates will be strictly
  administered in accordance with the rules of the Kamud. As to who you are,
  that has not been established. You came to us armed with a sword of the Ma
  Gongi, and impersonating the dead Rad. When questioned, you slew a soldier of
  the Kamud. Under the circumstances, it is my duty to arrest you and send you
  to Dukor for trial.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You make yourself absurd by claiming that I am dead.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yield your sword, or you soon will be,&rdquo; promised Sel Han.
  &ldquo;Seize him, men. If he resists, cut him down.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Seeing that resistance against such odds would be foolhardy, Thorne handed
  his sword to the nearest soldier. Another removed the medal that hung around
  his neck. Then he was led away by two warriors. They took him into the castle
  courtyard, where one of the large flying machines he had previously seen
  stood ready to take off. He was hustled up a set of metal steps and into the
  body of the craft, where a score of prisoners, guarded by two armed warriors,
  were chained by metal collars to rings in the wall. A collar was snapped
  around his neck.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

  <p class="first">THORNE&rsquo;S journey was not a pleasant one.</p>

  <p>Like the other prisoners, the Earthman was compelled by the lurching of
  the ship to keep a tight hold on his chain with both hands, and thus ease the
  sudden jerks on his metal collar that would otherwise have choked him.
  Consequently he was thankful when, after more than an hour of riding, he
  sensed that the ship was settling, then felt the shock of its landing.</p>

  <p>A moment later the door was flung open by one of the guards and the
  folding metal steps were dropped. The other guard opened the prisoners&rsquo;
  collars, one by one, with a key he carried, and ordered them out the door.
  Thorne, the third to step out, saw that they were in a large walled inclosure
  in which were several hundred men, some lying on the ground or lolling
  against the walls, others pacing up and down, or conversing in small
  groups.</p>

  <p>At the bottom of the ladder an officer waited, attended by two soldiers,
  one of whom carried a bundle of metal rings. The officer was scanning a paper
  which the first guard had handed him, evidently a list of prisoners. As each
  man descended, he asked his name and checked the list. Then the soldier with
  the rings fastened one about the prisoner&rsquo;s neck and called the number
  engraved on the ring.</p>

  <p>When it came Thorne&rsquo;s turn, the officer asked &ldquo;Your
  name?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sheb Takkor.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is your real name?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have told you,&rdquo; Thorne replied.</p>

  <p>The officer shrugged. &ldquo;It will be so entered, though the report says
  you are an impostor. But that will be a matter for the judges.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He signed to the soldier with the rings, who clamped one about
  Thorne&rsquo;s neck and called the number. The soldier gave him a push that
  sent him stumbling into the yard, and the officer began questioning the next
  prisoner.</p>

  <p>Recovering his balance, the Earthman walked morosely to the center of the
  inclosure. A glance about him at the high walls patrolled by heavily armed
  warriors convinced him that escape would be next to impossible. Beyond the
  walls on all sides he saw the upper stories of many cylindrical, flat-topped
  buildings. He concluded, from this, that he must be in the midst of a large
  and populous city.</p>

  <p>Having completed his inspection of his surroundings, he found a place
  where he could sit and lean against the wall, and think. His case, it seemed,
  was well nigh hopeless.</p>

  <p>As he sat there, Thorne noticed coming toward him a man with a huge chest
  and shoulders, long, ape-like arms, and abnormally short legs. With a start
  of surprise, he recognized the Jen of the Takkor Free Swordsmen.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yirl Du!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shield my eyes, my lord Sheb,&rdquo; said the Jen, &ldquo;and
  thank Deza that you still live. Lal Vak and I thought you dead, and so
  reported at the castle.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What brought you here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My arrest came so suddenly,&rdquo; replied Yirl Du, &ldquo;that I
  am still bewildered. I was sent here this morning charged with inciting the
  Free Swordsmen to revolt against the Kamud.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And should they be able to prove such an absurd charge, what will
  be the penalty?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Death. In what form, I know not. The seven dread judges of the
  Kamud deal out death in many fiendish forms. Their most merciful sentence is
  the stroke of the sword. Then there are the mines. A sentence to the mines is
  really a death sentence, for few men survive their rigors for many
  days.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And what sentence do you think they will pass on me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of what is my lord accused?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I slew a soldier of the Kamud who attacked me. Also I am to be
  charged with impersonating myself, because I am officially dead. Furthermore,
  there is some suspicion attached to me, which I cannot fathom, because I was
  wearing a sword of the Ma Gongi.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Yirl Du groaned. &ldquo;You might have obtained an acquittal on the first
  two counts, but I fear this latter spells your doom. Deza grant that I, Yirl
  Du, Jen of the Takkor Free Swordsmen, may never live to see my Rad die in
  such dishonor.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But why should a sword of the Ma Gongi constitute such damning
  evidence?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is believed,&rdquo; the Jen told him, &ldquo;that the Ma Gongi
  are plotting to overthrow the Old Race - to conquer all Mars. There have been
  persistent rumors that one of the archaeologists has unearthed the secret of
  the deadly green ray.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Although we would not dare to publicly voice our suspicions, there
  are also those among us who suspect Sel Han of plotting with the Ma Gongi. He
  has so wormed himself into the good graces of Irintz Tel that a word breathed
  against him would bring instant disaster to almost any man.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is said, also, that the Dixtar intends to wed his daughter Neva
  to this arch-plotter, and that through marriage with her he will eventually
  succeed to the dixtarship of Xancibar.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is obvious that this Sel Han is indeed a menace to all
  mankind,&rdquo; said Thorne.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have a further suspicion,&rdquo; went on Yirl Du, &ldquo;born
  when you told me of the disappearance of Thaine&rsquo;s father. Miradon Vil,
  a prisoner, would be of inestimable value to Sel Han in his plans for
  conquest. With the Vil in his power, he could hold the royalists as well as
  the Kamud in the hollow of his hand. A colony of the Ma Gongi inhabits a part
  of the marsh not far from Miradon&rsquo;s hiding place. And it may well be
  that they, at the instigation of their ally, Sel Han, have captured the Vil
  and are holding him in some secret hiding place.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thorne was about to reply when a shrill whistle sounded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Yirl Du. &ldquo;That was the food signal, and the
  last ten men in line always go hungry.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They both sprang forward to where a long line of prisoners was forming
  before a table containing some small cakes and cubical cups of pulcho,
  presided over by four orderlies who had already begun to hand a cup and cake
  to each man, under the watchful eyes of the half dozen soldiers with drawn
  swords. Thorne saw, on looking back, that there were exactly ten men behind
  him.</p>

  <p>Shuffling forward with the others, he was surprised to feel a powerful
  hand clapped on his shoulder. Before he could offer the slightest resistance,
  he was spun around, and found himself walking behind the man who had
  previously been just behind him.</p>

  <p>Thorne seized the brawny arm of the man who had supplanted him and swung
  him around. He had a swift glimpse of a glaring face, crisscrossed by a
  frightful pattern of livid scars. Then he drove a smashing right hook to the
  point of the jaw that sent the man reeling backward to the ground.</p>

  <p>In a moment the fellow began to recover from the effect of the blow, and
  sat up looking about him. Suddenly spying Thorne, he shook his bullet head,
  then lurched to his feet, and charged.</p>

  <p>Thorne turned at the sound, and prepared to meet the shock of the attack.
  With both arms outstretched, the man attempted to seize him, but a blow in
  the solar plexus followed by a swift uppercut downed him again.</p>

  <p>Instantly, Yirl Du, who had drained his pulcho cup and was munching his
  cake, tossed the food aside and sprang forward. &ldquo;Let me handle this
  beast, my lord. He is Sur Det, the most dreaded duelist and assassin in all
  Xancibar.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>By this time most of the prisoners were crowding around, talking excitedly
  while they munched and drank.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Swords!&rdquo; some one shouted. &ldquo;Bring swords!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A group of guards came shouldering through the crowd, making way for a
  handsome fellow who wore the purple cloak of an officer of the Kamud.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this, Sur Det?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Fighting
  again?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sur Det scrambled to his feet and saluted. &ldquo;That fellow,&rdquo; he
  said, glaring at Thorne, &ldquo;has twice assaulted me. I ask settlement by
  swords, which is my right according to the prison rules.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The officer turned to Thorne. &ldquo;What say you? Do you, also, desire
  settlement by swords?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; the Earthman replied.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Obviously you have not heard of the prowess of Sur Det,&rdquo; said
  the officer. &ldquo;But on your own head be your decision. Give them swords,
  soldiers, and let a circle be formed.&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

  <p class="first">AS he stood, sword in hand, before his scar-faced opponent,
  Thorne was hooted by the multitude. A few who had heard of his supposed
  cowardice in his duel with Sel Han, quickly spread the word.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t puncture him too quickly, Sur Det,&rdquo; called
  one.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Slice him neatly,&rdquo; shouted another. &ldquo;Let us see how
  good a meat- cutter you are.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They saluted. Then Sur Det, instead of engaging Thorne&rsquo;s extended
  blade as was the custom, avoided it and attacked with a swift lunge. The
  Earthman was barely able to save his life by side-stepping the point.</p>

  <p>But Sur Det had left himself completely uncovered. Thorne now had but to
  extend his point, and the duel would be over. He started the lunge, but
  instead of sending the blade home, with a deft motion of his wrist cut the
  Martian symbol for the digraph &ldquo;sh,&rdquo; a perpendicular line with a
  short hook to the right at the bottom.</p>

  <p>A murmur of surprise went up from the crowd at this, for they knew he had
  his enemy at his mercy. Both men recovered. After a bewildering swirl of
  blades Thorne found a second opening, and instead of piercing the heart of
  his antagonist, slashed two horizontal lines beside the first character, the
  Martian symbol for &ldquo;e.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s writing his name on the killer!&rdquo; cried a
  spectator.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Write him a love letter!&rdquo; yelled another.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Draw us a picture!&rdquo; howled a third.</p>

  <p>When Thorne marked his chest for the second time without inflicting death,
  Sur Det began to realize that this strange young swordsman from Takkor, whom
  he had expected to slay so easily, was only playing with him. With that
  realization, he went berserk with fear.</p>

  <p>Thorne met the attack that followed, merely parrying and sidestepping
  until he felt his opponent&rsquo;s wrist begin to weaken. Then with a
  graceful, easy lunge, he carved the last symbol of his Martian name on that
  barrel chest, the &ldquo;b.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At this, the crowd roared its applause, but Thorne had not yet finished;
  he suddenly beat down his opponent&rsquo;s blade with a sharp blow close to
  the guard - then caught it, bound it with his own blade, and with a sudden
  twirling wrench, sent it flashing away over the heads of the spectators. For
  a moment the bewildered killer stood looking in blank amazement. Then, with a
  shriek of terror, he turned and fled. Thorne followed closely at his heels,
  spanking him loudly - with the flat of his sword until the creature fell down
  and begged for mercy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Puncture the boastful bladder and let out the wind,&rdquo; a
  spectator shouted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Carve your name on his craven heart,&rdquo; cried another.
  Satisfied that the killer had been sufficiently humbled, Thorne returned to
  where the young officer stood, and saluted. &ldquo;I am obliged to you for
  this diversion,&rdquo; he said, tendering the sword.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The obligation is entirely ours,&rdquo; replied the officer, taking
  the weapon. &ldquo;I have never seen such marvelous sword-work, or, I am
  convinced, has any one in all Xancibar. And now, to the victor goes the
  reward. Ho, orderly!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At this a man came up, bearing a steaming jar of pulcho, a cup and a great
  platter heaped with cakes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; asked Thorne.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The prize,&rdquo; smiled the officer, taking the jar from the
  orderly and filling a cup which he handed to the Earthman. &ldquo;I regret
  that so distinguished a swordsman and so gallant a gentleman may not be more
  suitably rewarded. But this, after all is a prison.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To your long life,&rdquo; said Thorne, draining his cup. Then he
  turned to the orderly. &ldquo;Distribute the cakes and the rest of the pulcho
  to the ten who were not served, including my defeated opponent.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At this added evidence of the generosity of their new champion, the
  multitude shouted its approbation. More than a half hour elapsed before
  Thorne was able to get away from his numberous admirers and sit alone once
  more with Yirl Du.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That was a marvelous fight, my lord,&rdquo; said the Jen. &ldquo;It
  will surely remove the stigma attached to your name by that unfortunate
  incident at the military school. The great pity of it is that it comes at a
  time when death by order of the Kamud is almost certain to be your
  lot.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It will be certain enough if Sel Han has his way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We have many good reasons to kill that flat-nosed traitor,&rdquo;
  replied Yirl Du, &ldquo;and there are two which I have not related to you.
  One is, that among the men who attacked us in the air I recognized one of his
  henchmen. So it was he who sent those assassins to slay us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is the other?&rdquo; asked Thorne.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have hesitated to tell you that one, as I would not give you
  needless pain on what may well be your last day of life. Know, then, that
  Sheb Takkor the elder was murdered. I was making my last round of the castle
  before retiring, to see if all was well, when I noticed him seated before the
  fireplace in his great swinging chair, hunched over in a most unnatural
  position. I called to him, but he made no response. I ran to his side, and
  saw that he was dead. A dagger had been driven into his back up to the
  hilt.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you think it was Sel Han who struck the blow?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;More likely one of his hired assassins. He, and no one else, had
  much to gain by the death of our beloved Rad. And he alone profited by
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps there was an enemy with a grudge.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is not likely. The Rad never left Takkor except to hunt in the
  marshes or the desert, or to secretly do what he could for our deposed
  sovereign and his daughter. So he had no opportnity to make enemies in other
  than his own raddek. And I&rsquo;ll swear that there was not a man, woman or
  child among his people who did not love and revere him. Moreover, the dagger
  was of foreign make and delicate workmanship, not the plain sturdy kind our
  Takkor folk are wont to carry. I hid it in the castle, hoping that it might
  some day afford us proof of the identity of the assassin.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At this juncture two guards with drawn swords in their hands stopped
  before Thorne.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you he who calls himself Sheb Takkor?&rdquo; asked one.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; Thorne replied.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Dixtar has sent for you. Come with us.&rdquo; Thorne stood up,
  but as he did so Yirl Du flung himself between the Earthman and the guards.
  &ldquo;Wait! Don&rsquo;t take him! Take me! I am Sheb Takkor!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>One of the guards laughed contemptuously. &ldquo;Out of the way, O great
  oaf, ere I cut you down. My comrade and I sat on the wall and saw this man
  defeat Sur Det, the killer. Do you think you could pass for him? Moreover,
  have we not eyes to read the numbers on your collars?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Yirl Du turned to Thorne. &ldquo;I fear it is the end, my lord,&rdquo; he
  groaned. He saluted. &ldquo;Farewell, my lord. Deza grant you life, yet if
  that be not His will, a brave death.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thorne returned the salute. &ldquo;Farewell, my friend,&rdquo; he
  answered.</p>

  <p>The Earthman was led through a gate into what was obviously one of the
  streets of a large city. It was paved with a tough, resilient material of a
  reddish-brown color, and was thronged with people and strange vehicles of
  many descriptions. There was one thing, however, which the vehicles all had
  in common. They did not travel on wheels, but ran about on multiple sets of
  jointed metal legs shod with balls of the resilient reddish-brown substance.
  The smallest of these odd vehicles had only two pairs of legs, but some of
  the larger ones had so many that they reminded him of gigantic caterpillars,
  moving smoothly and swiftly along the thoroughfare.</p>

  <p>In a moment an open vehicle with twelve pairs of legs drew up before the
  gate and stopped. There were three saddle-shaped seats with high backs, one
  in front and two side by side in the rear. A canopy overhead shaded the
  passengers. The front seat was occupied by a driver in military uniform. In
  one of the rear seats sat the Jen of the Prison Guards.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Dixtar has commanded that I bring you before him,&rdquo; he
  said. &ldquo;Give me your word that you will not attempt to escape while in
  the custody of Kov Lutas, and I will spare you the ignominy of
  chains.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Earthman thought for a moment. If he gave his word, once out of the
  custody of Kov Lutas, he could, with honor, make the attempt.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I give my word that I will not try to escape while in your
  custody.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Jen ordered the guards to remove Thorne&rsquo;s prison collar, and
  when this was done, dismissed them with a wave of his hand. &ldquo;Get
  in,&rdquo; he invited.</p>

  <p>Thorne climbed into the vacant saddle. The driver, who sat holding two
  levers that projected up through the floor at either side of his saddle, now
  slowly moved these forward. At this, the vehicle started silently and was
  soon moving through the traffic at a considerable speed.</p>

  <p>Thorne saw that when the driver wished to turn to the right he advanced
  the left lever and drew back the right, and he reversed the process to turn
  to the left. To increase the speed, he pushed both levers forward, and to
  decrease it drew them backward. When they were drawn back to a certain point,
  the vehicle came to a full stop.</p>

  <p>Having satisfied his curiosity regarding the vehicle, Thorne turned his
  attention to the strange sights about him.</p>

  <p>Noting the Earthman&rsquo;s interest in his surroundings, Kov Lutas said:
  &ldquo;Apparently this is your first visit to Dukor. Perhaps you would like
  to have me explain some of the sights of the city.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I should be grateful,&rdquo; Thorne replied.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dukor is divided into four equal quarters by the intersecting
  triple canals, Zeelan and Corvid. We are now in the northwest quarter of the
  city, and about to cross the Zeelan Canal into the northeast quarter, where
  the palace which formerly belonged to the Vil, but is now occupied by the
  Dixtar, is located.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It must be a tremendous city.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There are approximately five million people residing in each
  quarter,&rdquo; replied Kov Lutas, &ldquo;or twenty million in all. Also, we
  have each day about ten million transients who come on commercial or state
  business, or simply to visit and to see the sights. Dukor is a fair-sized
  city as cities go. Of course it does not seem large in comparison with
  Raliad, capital city of Kalsivar, which commands the intersections of four
  great triple canals, for Raliad is said to have a population of a hundred
  million.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>While he was speaking they came to the approach of a tremendous arched
  bridge, so long they could not see the farther end of it. In a moment they
  were out upon it, and Thorne was looking down upon the surface of the first
  of the three canals which collectively bore the name of Zeelan because they
  occupied the same huge trench. This canal swarmed with craft of many sizes
  and shapes, a large number of which were discharging freight into the dock
  warehouses which lined its banks.</p>

  <p>The huge central canal at the bottom of the great trench, which caught the
  drainage from the two upper irrigating canals, was lined with bathers of all
  ages who wore no clothing whatever.</p>

  <p>The canal passed, they entered a section of the city quite similar to the
  one they had just left. After a drive of about half an hour in this section,
  they drew up before an immense and magnificent edifice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Palace,&rdquo; said Kov Lutas. &ldquo;From this point we
  walk.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>After getting down from the vehicle, they mounted a broad flight of steps
  which led to the vast and ornate portico. Here they were halted and
  questioned by guards, who readily admitted them when shown the order of the
  Dixtar which Kov Lutas carried. Then, after crossing an immense busy foyer
  and traversing a long hallway, they came before a large circular doorway,
  closed by two purple curtains in which was embroidered with gold thread, the
  coat of arms of the Dixtar of Xancibar. Here an officer examined the order
  carried by Kov Lutas.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Dixtar is expecting you,&rdquo; he said. Then he beckoned to
  one of the guards. &ldquo;Announce Kov Lutas, Jen of the Guards of Prison
  Number 67,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and a prisoner.&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN the curtain was drawn aside, Thorne followed Kov Lutas
  through the doorway, and found himself in the presence of Irintz Tel.</p>

  <p>The Dixtar, his hands clasped behind him, was pacing to and fro on a
  plush-padded dais that fronted a luxuriously cushioned throne, which hung on
  four heavy golden chains depending from the ceiling. He was a small man,
  sparely built and quite bald. Thin-lipped, sharp-nosed and beady-eyed, his
  face bore the unmistakable stamp of the zealot and reformer.</p>

  <p>Irintz Tel paced up and down for some time without taking the slightest
  notice of Kov Lutas and his prisoner.</p>

  <p>After a lapse of some minutes, Irintz Tel paused midway in his pacing and,
  swinging on his heel, faced Kov Lutas.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he demanded, in a high-pitched, squeaky voice.</p>

  <p>Kov Lutas raised both hands in salute, holding them before his face.
  &ldquo;I shield my eyes in the glory of your presence, O mighty Dixtar of
  Xancibar and Commander of the Kamud.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thorne was astounded, for he had been told that under the Kamud all
  salutations of this sort had been abolished.</p>

  <p>The Earthman suddenly noticed that Irintz Tel was looking sharply at him,
  evidently expecting him to follow the example of the Jen; but he kept his
  hands down.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who is this ill-mannered lout you have brought into our presence,
  Kov Lutas?&rdquo; demanded the Dixtar.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He is Sheb Takkor, whom I bring in accordance with the
  Dixtar&rsquo;s command,&rdquo; replied Kov Lutas.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;His manners are execrable,&rdquo; said Irintz Tel, &ldquo;but they
  can be mended, and we hear that he is a good swordsman. It may be that we
  will find employment for him. We are both blessed and cursed with a beautiful
  daughter, as you are no doubt aware.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have heard of the great beauty of your excellency&rsquo;s
  daughter,&rdquo; replied Kov Lutas, cautiously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is a fatal beauty that corrupts our most loyal followers and
  makes traitors of our stanchest patriots. And today we are constrained to
  part with two more of our best swordsmen. They were her guardsmen, but they
  chose to let their hearts rule their heads. For such a malady, where our
  daughter is concerned, we have a most effective form of surgery.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is that, excellency?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In order that the heart may no longer rule the head, we separate
  them. A bit drastic, we will admit, but it never fails to cure. We sent for
  you and this prisoner because we must replace the two excellent swordsmen.
  Our daughter, as you know, must be well guarded."</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We will first take the case of the prisoner, here. Word came to us
  today of his defeat of Sur Det, the killer, so we decided to personally
  examine into the charges against him. He is accused, we find, of
  impersonating the dead Rad of Takkor, of wearing a sword of the Ma Gongi, and
  of slaying a soldier of the Kamud, and as evidence there have come to us this
  Takkor family medal,&rdquo; lifting it from a small taboret beside the
  throne, &ldquo;and this sword which he was alleged to have been wearing when
  captured. What say you to these charges, prisoner?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I could not impersonate the Rad of Takkor without impersonating
  myself,&rdquo; replied Thorne. &ldquo;I was reported dead because my crippled
  gawr fell with me after I was attacked. But we fell into a small lake. After
  freeing myself from the safety chains and the weight of my weapons, I swam
  ashore. There I was attacked by a party of Ma Gongi, and after wrestng the
  sword from one of them, beat off the others.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We can well believe that. But why did you slay one of our
  soldiers?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Because he attacked me on my own doorstep. In answer to that charge
  I plead self-defense.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Dixtar paced the dais for some time, chin on chest. Then he suddenly
  turned and looked at Thorne.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We hereby declare you innocent and discharged of all liability on
  all three counts,&rdquo; he said brusquely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And as a recompense for the indignities which you have suffered, we
  raise you to the rank of Jen and appoint you night guard to our daughter
  Neva.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He turned to the Jen of the Prison Guards. &ldquo;You also, my worthy Kov
  Lutas, we have decided to honor. You, henceforth, will guard our daughter by
  day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The face of Kov Lutas went as suddenly pale as if a sentence of death had
  been passed on him.</p>

  <p>Despite Kov Lutas&rsquo;s dismay, he managed to retain control of his
  features. &ldquo;I am deeply grateful that our Dixtar has chosen to
  distinguish me by this honor.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Irintz Tel beckoned Thorne to him and handed him the medal. &ldquo;Take
  back this badge of your ancient race and wear it with honor. We regret that
  we cannot return your title as well, but under the present social order there
  are no more rads. Nor can we make you our deputy, for upon hearing of your
  supposed death we immediately dispatched Sel Han to Takkor to represent us,
  as he knows our wishes and is high in our councils.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Dixtar is most generous,&rdquo; murmured Thorne. Irintz Tel now
  called to the officer at the door. &ldquo;Ho, Dir Hazef, conduct these two to
  the officers&rsquo; quarters and see that they are suitably arrayed as palace
  Jens. On the way you will permit them to witness the fate which overtakes
  those who are unfaithful to their trust, and show them the Hall of Heads. Let
  a sword and dagger decked with the Takkor serpent be brought from the armory
  for the one who is weaponless, as he is entitled to carry them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The two men saluted, and Dir Hazef conducted them to a small balcony which
  overlooked one of the inner courts. In the center of the court stood an
  officer. Dir Hazef signaled to him, and he, in turn, signaled to some one in
  a nearby doorway. A moment later there emerged two soldiers, driving before
  them two young officers with their hands bound behind them. Following the
  soldiers came a tall fellow bearing a long, straight-bladed sword and
  accompanied by a boy who carried a basket.</p>

  <p>The two prisoners were forced to kneel in the center of the courtyard.
  Then the tall man stepped behind them. Once, twice, his long blade flashed in
  the sunlight, and with each blow a head rolled to the pavement, to be
  garnered by the boy with the basket.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Those two,&rdquo; said Dir Hazef, &ldquo;were the guards of Neva,
  daughter of the Dixtar. They had the good taste but the bad judgment to fall
  in love with her and contend for her favors.&rdquo; He turned, and walking to
  a door behind them, opened it. &ldquo;Enter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thorne stepped through the doorway, followed by Kov Lutas and their
  conductor.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said Dir Hazef, &ldquo;is the Hall of Heads, a
  monument to the Dixtar&rsquo;s justice and a warning to those who would
  betray him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They were in a long, narrow room, lined wth shelves on both sides clear to
  the high ceiling. On the shelves stood row after row of crystal jars. Each
  jar was filled with clear liquid, and in the liquid floated a severed human
  head. There were thousands of heads of young men and old; even heads of women
  and children.</p>

  <p>Thorne tore his eyes away from the exhibit with a shudder, and turning,
  saw that Kov Lutas had already preceded him through the doorway.</p>

  <p>After locking the door and leading them down another corridor, Dir Hazef
  conducted them through a room where a number of officers sat in swinging
  chairs, sipping pulcho and conversing, or playing gapun, a game which
  consisted of rolling little engraved pellets of gold or silver at numbered
  holes in a board, the highest number winning all the pellets risked. Although
  he had never before seen Martian money, Thorne recognized at once that these
  pellets must be the medium of exchange.</p>

  <p>A number of apartments opened into this officers&rsquo; club room, and
  into one of these Dir Hazef led them. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave you here to
  bathe and change. Vorz, your orderly, will bring your new uniforms and
  weapons. You, Kov Lutas, are to go on duty at once, and Sheb Takkor will
  relieve you at the time of the evening meal.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The apartment was plainly but comfortably furnished with a swinging bed
  and a swinging chair for each man, a wardrobe and an arms rack. In one corner
  was a metal box about eight feet in height, one side of which stood open. It
  was lined throughout with a gray metal resembling block tin, and this lining
  was perforated with many holes. Beside it was rack on which hung a number of
  wisps of what looked like dry moss.</p>

  <p>As soon as Dir Hazef was gone, Kov Lutas began removing his clothing and
  weapons. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bathe now, if you don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; he
  said, &ldquo;as I must go on duty first.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; replied Thorne. He was puzzled as he saw no sign
  of a tub or bathroom.</p>

  <p>His curiosity was soon satisfied. Kov Lutas stepped into the square metal
  box in the corner and drew the side shut. Immediately there was the sound of
  rushing water, accompanied by much gurgling, blowing and gasping. A few
  moments later the side swung open, and the officer emerged, dripping and
  rubbing the water from his eyes. Then he reached for a bunch of the moss-like
  material and began briskly rubbing himself.</p>

  <p>Thorne, who had meanwhile removed his clothing, now entered the box and
  drew the side shut. As he moved about, he accidentally trod on a round plate
  in the center of the metal floor. Instantly he was surrounded by a swirl of
  warm, scented water which came up to his chin. The water soon receded as
  suddenly as it had risen, and several jets opened overhead, deluging him with
  a fragrant creamy lather.</p>

  <p>After about a minute of this there was a click as of some automatic
  mechanism, the jets ceased to spray, and the swirling water rose once more.
  While it rinsed off the lather this gradually grew cooler until it reached an
  almost icy temperature. Another click, and it drained away automatically. He
  opened the side, sputtering and gasping, and blindly reached for a bundle of
  drying material. As soon as he had the water out of his eyes he saw that an
  orderly had arrived with the new uniforms, and was helping Kov Lutas into
  his.</p>

  <p>Thorne rubbed himself until his skin glowed warmly. Vorz, the orderly,
  then assisted him to don his new uniform and buckle on his weapons. His new
  sword and dagger hilts were fashioned like those he had found himself wearing
  on his first advent on Mars, but were of gold powdered with jewels instead of
  plain brasstemperatur the eyes of the serpents were large rubies.</p>

  <p>The orderly, after bustling in with a three-legged stand on which were a
  pot of pulcho and two cups, hurried out. Kov Lutas filled the cups, and
  handing one to Thorne raised the other. &ldquo;May we die like brave
  soldiers.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thorne joined him. &ldquo;It is a strange toast. Why do you speak of
  death?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Because it is so near. To be appointed as guards to the
  Dixtar&rsquo;s daughter is equivalent to a death sentence.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why,&rdquo; Thorne replied. &ldquo;Certainly -
  every man who guards her isn&rsquo;t going to be so foolish as to lose his
  head over her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To lose his 'head' is indeed an apt expression. More than a hundred
  have already lost their heads, even as those two we saw this afternoon. Neva
  is said to be a heartless flirt, bent on conquest. Her father wants her to
  marry Sel Han, but she will not have him. And it is said that she flirts with
  every eligible male who crosses her path, just to spite them both. She is
  reputed to be irresistible, and her guards, of course, can&rsquo;t run away
  from her. Nor dare they affect to despise her advances, for her anger is
  fully as terrible as that of her father.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At this juncture an officer entered and saluted. &ldquo;Which of you is
  Kov Lutas?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; replied the young Jen, returning his salute.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you are ready you will come with me to relieve the temporary
  guard of the Dixtar&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am ready,&rdquo; Kov Lutas told him. &ldquo;Let us go.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They went out, and Thorne, after pouring himself another cup of pulcho,
  sat down to reflect on the situation. But he had scarcely settled in his
  swinging chair when Vorz came to the door and announced, &ldquo;Salute the
  Deputy Dixtar.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thorne sprang to his feet and raised his hand smartly in salute. Then he
  let it fall to his side as he recognized Sel Han.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Greetings, Sheb Takkor Jen,&rdquo; said the Deputy Dixtar with a
  grin. &ldquo;You seem surprised at seeing me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And to you, greetings, Sel Han,&rdquo; replied Thorne coolly.
  &ldquo;To what do I owe the-er-honor of this unexpected call?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Without replying, Sel Han walked to the taboret and helped himself to a
  cup of pulcho. Then he seated himself in Kov Lutas&rsquo;s chair. For a time,
  he sat there in silence, then spoke suddenly in English. &ldquo;Shut the
  door.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thorne closed the door and returned to his chair.</p>

  <p>Sel Han nodded. &ldquo;I thought so. Understands English.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps when you have finished talking to yourself, you will
  explain your business,&rdquo; Thorne said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get stuffy with me. I can put you on the spot, or I can
  make things good for you. I came to make you a proposition. What do you say,
  Harry Thorne?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I say you&rsquo;re wasting your time, Frank Boyd.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah-I figured you knew. Well, I heard about your run-in with Sur
  Det. Pretty handy with a sword, aren&rsquo;t you? There wasn&rsquo;t another
  man in this country who could have made a monkey out of Sur Det the way you
  did.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He was my teacher when I came here. I saw I needed to be handy with
  a sword, so I picked the best teacher I could find. Since I&rsquo;m younger,
  faster, and have a longer reach, I got so I could beat him. Then I went and
  started to cut my way to the top. And I&rsquo;m pretty close to it
  now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you come to entertain me with this modest little
  sketch?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, I came to get a line on you - and give you a break if
  you&rsquo;re willing to play ball. I can cut you in on something
  big.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Such as what?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be talking out of turn if I told you. First, you do what
  you want to do, then I&rsquo;ll make things right for you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we can talk business, Mr. Boyd.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be an idiot. Get this - you&rsquo;re taking orders,
  I&rsquo;m giving them. Now this girl Neva is supposed to marry me, but she
  doesn&rsquo;t see it yet. Right now, just to spite her father and me,
  she&rsquo;s flirting with every man she meets. She&rsquo;ll probably make a
  pass at you. If you don&rsquo;t play, she&rsquo;ll send you to the lines - if
  you do, her father will have your head. You&rsquo;re on the spot unless you
  listen to me.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What bums me now is that she won&rsquo;t even talk to me - calls
  the guard and has me thrown out every time I drop in to see her. Now
  here&rsquo;s all I want you to do. I&rsquo;m going to drop in to see her
  tonight before I fly to Takkor. She&rsquo;ll probably want you to throw me
  out. If she does, tell her you can&rsquo;t in honor lay a hand on me, because
  I won that duel from you at the military school. That will let you
  out.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At this moment the door opened and an orderly entered with Thorne&rsquo;s
  evening meal. As he arranged the dishes on the taboret he noticed Sel Han.
  &ldquo;May I get the Deputy Dixtar something to eat?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m dining with the Dixtar,&rdquo; replied Sel Han,
  rising. He swung on Thorne. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget I&rsquo;m not asking
  you, I&rsquo;m telling you - and you&rsquo;d better come through.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Without replying or looking up, Thorne drew his jeweled dagger and turned
  his attention to the food on the taboret which the orderly had set before
  him. A moment later he heard Sel Han leave the room. Soon after he finished
  his meal, an officer came in and saluted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is time for you to relieve Kov Lutas in the apartments of the
  Dixtar&rsquo;s daughter,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN Thorne, escorted by the palace officer, reached the
  apartments of Neva, the sun had set, and the luxuriously furnished rooms were
  lighted by the soft amber radiance of the half-hooded baridium globes which
  hung from the ceiling on golden chains. The size and magnificence of the
  suite reserved for the daughter of this apostle of simplicity who would make
  all citizens equal, was astounding.</p>

  <p>The chamber in which he found himself opened onto a broad terrace which
  led to a private garden, separated from the rest of the palace grounds by a
  high wall. Kov Lutas, standing in the circular doorway, smiled at their
  approach.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Greetings, Sheb Takkor,&rdquo; he said, after exchanging salutes
  with the two officers. &ldquo;She whom we guard is resting on the terrace.
  The orders are to stay always within sight and call, and when she sleeps to
  stand guard just outside her chamber door.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thorne took up Kov Lutas&rsquo;s position in the doorway.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to carry out orders. A good dinner and a sound rest to
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And to you a pleasant vigil,&rdquo; replied Kov Lutas.</p>

  <p>Not until both officers had gone out did Thorne steal a glance at the girl
  he was to guard. He was unable to suppress a gasp.</p>

  <p>Her eyes, languorous beneath the fringed curtains of their sleepy lids,
  were liquid pools of lapis lazuli. Her small nose was a most exquisitely
  chiseled bit of sculpture. Her red lips, sightly parted, revealed teeth that
  were matched pearls. And her hair was spun gold and sunbeams.</p>

  <p>For some time she was motionless, gazing pensively out over the garden.
  Presently she crossed the terrace and descended to the garden. Watching her,
  Thorne stood bemused, wondering if it were possible that the scrawny, rat-
  faced Dixtar could be the father of so beautiful a daughter.</p>

  <p>So potent was the spell cast over his senses that he lost sight of her in
  the shrubbery before he remembered his orders, and ran down the steps into
  the garden.</p>

  <p>For some time Thorne hurried blindly about in the garden. Then the nearer
  moon, suddenly blinking above the rooftops to the west, came to his
  assistance. By its pale light he saw Neva not fifty feet from him, seated on
  the rim of a limpid pool in the center of which a fountain babbled.</p>

  <p>Slowly he moved closer and halted at a distance of about twenty feet. As
  he stood there he was recalled to mundane considerations by a burning
  sensation in the region of his knees. Lowering his hand to investigate the
  cause, he discovered that heat rays were emanating from an ornate globe about
  two feet high which stood beside the path.</p>

  <p>He had seen many such globes at various points around the garden and on
  the terrace. Although it had not occurred to him to wonder why the garden had
  not grown cold after nightfall, he now understood the reason.</p>

  <p>In order to escape the discomfort caused by the proximity of the heating
  globe, he moved a few steps nearer the fountain. A dry twig snapped beneath
  his foot, and the girl looked up, a startled expression on her face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have no fear,&rdquo; said Thorne. &ldquo;I am Sheb Takkor, your new
  guard.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;It was the noise that startled
  me. You see, I am expecting some one I am not at all anxious to
  meet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Though he felt quite sure he knew who that some one was, Thorne did not
  venture to say so.</p>

  <p>Heavy footsteps sounded on the garden path. A shadow fell athwart the
  pool. Thorne glanced across to where the shadow began. Behind Neva stood Sel
  Han. &ldquo;The Dixtar&rsquo;s deputy salutes his fair daughter,&rdquo; he
  said.</p>

  <p>Without replying or even turning her head, Neva called to Thorne, &ldquo;A
  trespasser has intruded upon my privacy, guardsman. Remove him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Earthman strode forward and stood facing his enemy. &ldquo;It seems
  you are not wanted,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;I trust that, under the
  circumstances, you will not have the bad taste to remain.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sel Han laughed contemptuously. &ldquo;Out of my way, worm,&rdquo; he
  ordered. &ldquo;You dare not raise a hand against me.&rdquo; He sat down
  familiarly beside Neva. &ldquo;Your guardsman is a spineless coward. Once he
  faced me, sword in hand, but grew so frightened before a blow had been struck
  that he dropped his weapon and fainted.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thorne ground his teeth in impotent rage. He knew that under the Martian
  code he must suffer in silence any abuse which this fellow might choose to
  heap on him, physical violence or an assault with a weapon excepted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I would have you know, Sheb Takkor,&rdquo; Neva said, ignoring the
  presence of Sel Han, &ldquo;that all the details of that unfortunate affair
  of yours at the training school are known to me. It was cowardly of your
  opponent to slash you when you were weakened from loss of blood and numbed by
  the virus of a desert blood-fly. And in full accord with that craven blow is
  his present refusal to again meet you, while he relies on the passivity which
  his technical victory imposes on you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At this, the deputy forced a derisive laugh.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Would it please the Dixtar&rsquo;s daughter to have her guard slain
  before her eyes?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It would please her guard,&rdquo; retorted Thorne, &ldquo;to have
  the opportunity of defending himself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No doubt it would,&rdquo; grinned Sel Han. He moved closer to Neva.
  &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;send away this cowardly guard who is
  powerless to help you. There is something I want to ask you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Familiarly he passed his arm around her shoulders. And when, with blazing
  eyes, she would have leaped away from him, he held her tightly.</p>

  <p>Thorne instantly whipped out his sword. &ldquo;Release her or die,&rdquo;
  he commanded, presenting his point at the deputy&rsquo;s breast.</p>

  <p>The deputy let her go, and stood erect, glaring. &ldquo;Have you abandoned
  your honor?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I might ask you the same,&rdquo; retorted Thorne, sheathing his
  sword, &ldquo;but I know a man is incapable of abandoning that which he has
  never had.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It seems,&rdquo; said Sel Han, a deadly glitter in his eyes,
  &ldquo;that you have forgotten the code - and something else.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am glad you have not forgotten that you are my guardsman, Sheb
  Takkor Jen,&rdquo; interposed Neva. &ldquo;And since you are acting in that
  capacity, and not in your own personal interests, it would seem that you are
  at liberty to treat this trespasser as you would any other.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I had hoped that the Dixtar&rsquo;s daughter would confirm me in
  that belief,&rdquo; relied Thorne. The Earthman&rsquo;s fist shot up in a
  short arc that ended beneath Sel Han&rsquo;s protruding chin. There was a
  tremendous splash as the deputy measured his length in the chilly pool.</p>

  <p>Thorne leaped back and waited tensely, hand on hilt. His enemy came up
  sputtering and cursing luridly in English, then stepped over the rim. He
  bowed low before the girl.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Permit me to congratulate the Dixtar&rsquo;s daughter on the
  singular efficiency of her guardsman. It is only exceeded by his total lack
  of honor.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then he turned, and strode away with water sloshing in his boots and
  dripping from his clothing.</p>

  <p>Thorne&rsquo;s hand fell limply from his sword hilt. He was bitterly
  disappointed, for he had felt certain that Sel Han would come out of that
  enforced bath raging and eager to try conclusions with him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The coward! The miserable, slinking coward!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Neva was speaking to herself, as she gazed after the departing figure. She
  turned and looked up at Thorne.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He is afraid to measure swords with you,&rdquo; she said,
  &ldquo;but he will find some other way to be rid of you. He is cunning, oh,
  so cunning, and treacherous.&rdquo; She laid a slim hand on the
  Earthman&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;The deputy has considerable influence with the
  Dixtar, my father - but for that matter, so have I. And I will help
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In spite of his preconceived dislike of this little beauty, Thorne
  thrilled at her glance and touch.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am honored that the Dixtar&rsquo;s daughter should be interested
  in preserving my worthless life,&rdquo; he replied.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He is a strange and terrible creature, this Sel Han,&rdquo; she
  went on. &ldquo;Did you notice the queer gibberish he used when he came up
  out of the water? Some incantation, perhaps, to a strange god. No doubt he is
  a sorcerer.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Recalling the deputy&rsquo;s lurid English curses, Thorne smiled to
  himself as he replied, &ldquo;I doubt not that he was calling down the wrath
  of some deity on my head.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Neva yawned prettily. &ldquo;I am sleepy,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We will
  go in now, for I must retire. You may walk beside me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Slowly, side by side, stepping in perfect unison, they went up the path
  which led to the house.</p>

  <p>At the steps which led up to the terrace she took his arm. Again he felt
  the thrill of her touch, and fought it with every ounce of will power at his
  command.</p>

  <p>As they entered the doorway a slave girl hurried up to take her
  mistress&rsquo;s cloak. Another moved the lever which uncapped the baridium
  light globes, making the room brilliant as day. And still another hurried in,
  bearing a tray on which was a tiny jeweled cup of steaming pulcho which she
  proffered to Neva.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bring another for the Jen,&rdquo; she said.</p>

  <p>The girl hurried out, and returned a moment later with a larger cup.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I drink to my brave and efficient guardsman,&rdquo; smiled
  Neva.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And I to the lovely and precious jewel which he guards,&rdquo;
  replied Thorne.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

  <p class="first">DURING the early watches of the night, Thorne, standing
  guard before Neva&rsquo;s chamber door, reviewed the doings of the day.
  Before seeing the Dixtar&rsquo;s daughter he had been firmly of the opinion
  that he loved Thaine. And he had resolved not to be overcome by the reputedly
  irresistible charms of Neva. But now her image was ever before him.</p>

  <p>As he stood there, inwardly perturbed by his strangely conflicting
  emotions, he suddenly sensed that all was not as it should be - that some
  sinister, alien presence was quietly watching him.</p>

  <p>Before retiring, one of the slave girls had pulled the levers which hooded
  all of the larger baridium globes, leaving only one tiny light uncovered. It
  shed a pale golden twilight that faintly revealed the outlines of the objects
  in the room.</p>

  <p>Over all these objects Thorne&rsquo;s eyes now roved, yet he could discern
  nothing amiss. The swinging chairs and divans, depending from the ceiling by
  their golden chains, were obviously unoccupied. And the shadows beneath them
  were not so dense as to form a hiding place for a human being. There was a
  tall, shelved case in which many metal cylinders were kept, containing the
  scrolls which on Mars answered for books. But nothing could hide there. And
  other than these, there were only a few large pots of flowers set here and
  there about the room.</p>

  <p>Once more he settled to his former position, but this time he only
  pretended to be preoccupied. For some time nothing happened, yet though his
  face was held straight ahead, he kept eyes turned in the direction where he
  thought he had seen a stealthy movement. Suddenly, he saw it again. And to
  his astonishment, he discovered that it was a large pot of flowers which had
  moved. So far as he could see this pot and its contents were not markedly
  different from any of the others. It was about three and a half feet high and
  three in diameter at its center. And the two large handles projecting from
  sides were of the same angular pattern as the others. Without moving his
  head, he kept his eyes on this singularly mobile pot. Inch by inch it came
  toward him while he watched, fascinated. As it drew closer he examined it
  minutely, meanwhile stealthily loosening his sword in its sheath with his
  left hand. It seemed filled almost to the brim with rich black soil, from
  which the flower stalks projected.</p>

  <p>Closer and closer it came until but a scant five feet separated them. Then
  it suddenly stood erect on two spindly legs and its handles turned into two
  spidery arms, one of which wielded a long, slim dagger. Straight for the
  Earthman it sprang, its weapon poised. But in that instant he had whipped his
  sword from its sheath, and whirling it over his head, brought it down with
  all his might on the amazing pot.</p>

  <p>The hard vitreous shoulder of the pot withstood the blow of his slender
  weapon with ease, but the keen blade glanced downward, shearing off the
  spidery arm that held the dagger. At this there was a muffled shriek of pain
  from inside the pot, and turning, it fled swiftly for the doorway. As he set
  out in pursuit, Thorne shifted his sword to his left hand, and plucking his
  heavy mace from his belt, hurled it straight at the center of the pot.</p>

  <p>The weapon went true to the mark. There was a resounding crash of broken
  crockery, and the spindle legs collapsed, precipitating everything onto the
  floor. Out of the tangle of crumpled flowers there rolled a round-bodied
  yellow man.</p>

  <p>For some time pandemonium held sway in that quarter of the palace.
  Neva&rsquo;s frightened girls and women screamed for help, and a company of
  guards from the outer corridors came clanking into the room. But Neva
  herself, clad in a filmy wrap, came out of her sleeping room, quite
  unperturbed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What has happened, Sheb Takkor Jen?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That attacked me,&rdquo; Thorne replied, indicating the corpse,
  &ldquo;disguised as a pot of flowers.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>By this time the room was filled with soldiers and slave girls, all
  staring curiously at the remains. Some one had unhooded the baridium globe,
  and the resulting light revealed every detail.</p>

  <p>The yellow man&rsquo;s disguise had been well adapted to his rotund body
  and spidery arms. The pot had a false bottom only two inches from the top,
  covered with a thin layer of soil. The flower stalks were set on narrow
  spikes projecting upward from this bottom. There were no handles, but holes
  through which the scrawny arms were thrust. Painted to resemble crockery and
  held akimbo, they had looked exactly like handles in the dim light. And the
  pot, with small holes bored in it for breathing and spying, formed an
  efficient body armor against sword and dagger thrusts.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A diabolical attempt;" said Neva, shuddering. Then to the soldiers,
  &ldquo;Take it away.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Two men caught up the stiffening body and others cleared away the debris.
  Then, at a sign from Neva, all silently left the apartment.</p>

  <p>She looked up into Thorne&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have saved me from abduction, or perhaps assassination,&rdquo;
  she said. &ldquo;I am very grateful.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;it is only myself I have saved.
  The fellow attacked me. And I have reason to believe he was the creature of
  Sel Han.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What reason?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Because the Deputy Dixtar is said to be in league with the Ma
  Gongi.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There may be some truth in that,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;but
  don&rsquo;t let anyone hear you say it. My father has unlimited faith in his
  deputy, and has beheaded two officers who were bold enough to accuse him of
  that very thing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am grateful for your warning,&rdquo; Thorne replied, &ldquo;and
  will be discreet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A slave girl drew back the curtain, and she reentered her sleeping
  room.</p>

  <p>Morning found the Earthman exceedingly weary after a strenuous day and
  night without rest. Soon after he was relieved by Kov Lutas he was sound
  asleep in their apartment. It seemed that he had scarcely closed his eyes
  when the orderly awakened him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your servant is commanded to prepare you to attend the
  Dixtar&rsquo;s daughter at the state function this evening,&rdquo; he said.
  &ldquo;As the preparation will take some time, I was compelled to awaken you
  early.&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

  <p class="first">LIKE most of the women Thorne had known on his own world,
  Neva was a long time about dressing. But when, after he had waited for more
  than an hour before her door, she came forth, the result was most
  entrancing.</p>

  <p>A tiara of pearls and pale blue amethysts woven together in a bizarre
  pattern on the meshwork of golden wires, bound her sun-bright hair. Beads of
  the same materials formed her breast-shields and supported a clinging bodice
  of iridescent blue silk. This vanished in a girdle of pearls and
  amethysts.</p>

  <p>Thorne stood enthralled, and she smiled archly. Then she raised her arms
  and circled gracefully on the tips of her toes. &ldquo;Like it?&rdquo; she
  asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Immensely,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;even as I adore -&rdquo; He
  stopped suddenly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; she urged him, still smiling.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sorry. I said more than I intended. Perhaps you will find it in
  your heart to overlook my presumption.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps I shall if you will finish.&rdquo; Then, &ldquo;Even as I
  adore -&rdquo; she prompted him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;- the star-strewn firmament,&rdquo; he replied.</p>

  <p>She stamped a tiny foot. &ldquo;Must I command you?&rdquo; She moved
  closer - laid a hand on his arm. &ldquo;Where I might command,&rdquo; she
  said, &ldquo;I will only implore.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;- the lovely jewel it adorns,&rdquo; he finished.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah! That is what I wanted to hear you say. And for your reward you
  will escort me to the reception as a gentleman and officer of the Kamud,
  walking at my side.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The reception of Irintz Tel, Dixtar of Xancibar, was a gorgeous affair.
  Held for the purpose of welcoming Lori Thool, the new ambassador from
  Kalsivar, largest and most powerful nation of Mars, it was a model of
  magnificence.</p>

  <p>The function was held in the great central audience chamber of the palace,
  the ceiling of which towered a thousand feet above the heads of the assembled
  guests, its polished surface reflecting the rays of myriads of baridium
  globes, which made the place light as day.</p>

  <p>Irintz Tel was standing with his illustrious guest on a dais in the center
  of the floor, presenting other visiting dignitaries and his chief officers,
  when the silvery notes of a trumpet rose above the hum of conversation.
  Instantly, every voice was hushed as a pompous major-domo announced:
  &ldquo;The Dixtar&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>All eyes were turned toward the doorway as Neva entered, walking beside
  Thorne. And though they lighted with pleasure at sight of the dainty little
  golden-haired beauty who was the first lady of Xancibar, not a few admiring
  glances were cast at the tall, handsome, sun-bronzed young officer.</p>

  <p>Straight to the dais they went, the girl nodding to right and left to her
  many friends and acquaintances. As the little rat-faced Dixtar advanced to
  meet them, accompanied by Lori Thool, Thorne was once more struck by the
  incongruous dissimilarity between father and daughter.</p>

  <p>The ambassador was tall, slender, and slightly under middle age, his hair
  just beginning to gray at the temples. He was quite handsome and elegant in
  his uniform and insignia of a great noble of Kalsivar.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Neva,&rdquo; squeaked the Dixtar in his high-pitched voice,
  &ldquo;this is Lori Thool, the noble ambassador from Kalsivar. Lori Thool, my
  daughter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The ambassador saluted gracefully. &ldquo;My homage to the most beautiful
  of the daughters of Mars. It must be that I have now met every one. Will you
  not join me in a game of gapun? I see they are setting up the
  boards.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In a moment,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;You have not quite met
  every one. This is my friend, Sheb Takkor Jen.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>As he and the resplendent ambassador exchanged dignified salutes, the
  Earthman exulted over the fact that she had said, &ldquo;my
  friend.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Neva had beckoned a pretty little black-haired, brown-eyed
  beauty to her side.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I take it that you have met the ambassador, Trixana,&rdquo; she
  said, &ldquo;but not my friend, Sheb Takkor Jen.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thorne acknowledged with a courtly salute, and a moment later found
  himself walking at the side of the vivacious little brunette, following Neva
  and Lori Thool as they made their way toward the gaming boards. From the
  corner of his eye, he saw Irintz Tel standing, chin on chest and hands
  clasped behind him. And he was quite positive that the Dixtar&rsquo;s look
  was not friendly.</p>

  <p>A moment later he saw Sel Han slip up beside Irintz Tel and, bending,
  whisper some secret communication. The Dixtar nodded, and again flashed a
  look at Thorne.</p>

  <p>Lori Thool and the two girls chanced much gold at the gaming boards, and
  Trixana won quite heavily. But Thorne only looked on. As he was standing,
  watching the game, he felt a touch on his arm, and turning, beheld the sly
  face of the white-haired Lal Vak.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Greetings, Sheb Takkor Jen,&rdquo; he said softly. &ldquo;Turn and
  watch the game, while I deliver a message. We must not seem to be talking
  together.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thorne looked back at the players, and the scientist continued: &ldquo;You
  are in great danger. Sel Han is plotting against your life. He has denounced
  you to the Dixtar as being over-friendly with Neva, and her actions tonight
  in treating you as an equal have seemed to confirm his words. A friend has
  brought me news that Irintz Tel has just promised Sel Han he will turn you
  over to the headsman in the morning.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What can I do about it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Escape. Get away from the palace before morning.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That I had already planned.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Over the garden wall.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Splendid! It is just what we had in mind. I will have a conveyance
  waiting for you. Be there just after the farther moon rises and it may be
  that we can save you. Farewell.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>When the gathering broke up, Lori Thool, after saying a lingering farewell
  to Neva, departed with his suite. Trixana was claimed by her father, a tall,
  handsome soldier in the prime of life, and Neva, left once more with Thorne,
  started toward the door. They had only gone a few steps when Sel Han suddenly
  strode up. He made a sweeping bow before Neva.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;May I have the honor of seeing the Dixtar&rsquo;s daughter safely
  to her apartments?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>She took Thorne&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;The Dixtar&rsquo;s daughter is
  adequately escorted.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sel Han continued to bar her way, smiling cynically. And the Earthman
  noticed that the Dixtar himself was only a few feet away, looking on.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Apparently you have not observed that the Dixtar&rsquo;s daughter
  wishes to pass,&rdquo; said Thorne. &ldquo;Under such circumstances it should
  not be necessary to request any gentleman to stand aside.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At this, the deputy flashed a look at the Dixtar, as much as to say,
  &ldquo;I told you so,&rdquo; and moved out of the way.</p>

  <p>* * *</p>

  <p>Back in the apartments of Neva, as Thorne stood guard before her chamber
  door, his mind was a mass of conflicting emotions. The time slipped by until
  he suddenly realized that the farther moon had risen and the hour had struck
  for his departure. He was about to steal softly away from his post when he
  was startled by a touch on his arm and a whispered, &ldquo;Quiet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Swiftly turning, he was astonished to see Neva standing there before the
  curtain clad in a filmy sleeping garment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Make no noise,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and come with me. I heard
  someone on my balcony, and want you to surprise the prowler.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Softly they entered the sleeping chamber. For a moment Thorne stood there,
  accustoming his eyes to the dim light and taking note of his surroundings.
  Then he silently drew his sword and advanced toward the balcony, listening
  intently.</p>

  <p>Reaching a window without having heard a sound, he cautiously leaned
  forward and peered out. So far as he could see, the balcony was deserted. He
  stepped out and explored. Still no sign of the prowler. Then he reentered the
  room.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you see him?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I saw no one,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Perhaps you were only
  dreaming.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, no! I am positive a man was there a moment ago. Not only did I
  hear him, but I saw his shadow as the moon came up. I&rsquo;m terribly
  frightened.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They were standing very close together. Her eyes, looking up into his,
  were wide with fear. She swayed toward him.</p>

  <p>Solicitously he threw his arms about her - felt that she was trembling.
  Her arms stole about his neck and clung. &ldquo;Hold me tight - tight! In
  your arms I am not afraid.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Now it was the man who trembled; but not with fear. Their lips met.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I love you, love you, love you!&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Say
  again what you said to me this evening.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I love and adore you,&rdquo; he told her, his voice husky with
  emotion. &ldquo;Yet it is madness - a sweet madness.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, dear one?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Because tomorrow&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Suddenly the lights flashed on, and he paused, speechless with
  surprise.</p>

  <p>A dozen armed soldiers rushed into the room, bared blades in their hands.
  At their head was Sel Han, a grin of triumph on his features. And behind them
  came Irintz Tel, Dixtar of Xancibar.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Help! The guard! Release me, you brute!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>For a moment Thorne was in a daze. Then he suddenly realized that it was
  Neva who was speaking - that she was beating upon his breast with her
  clenched hands - hands that had caressed him but a moment before - straining
  to break from his clasp.</p>

  <p>Mechanically he let her go. She ran to the little wizened Dixtar, buried
  her face in his shoulder, and began sobbing bitterly.</p>

  <p>Thorne suddenly came to the full realization of his peril. He whipped out
  his sword and dagger and leaped for the door. Two warriors barred his
  progress.</p>

  <p>A feint, a thrust, and one went down stabbed through the heart. He parried
  the thrust of the other with his dagger. Then he withdrew his blade from the
  heart of the first enemy and sheathed it in the throat of the second.</p>

  <p>Other warriors leaped in close, but he bounded over the bodies of his two
  fallen adversaries and out of the door. Straight across the terrace he
  dashed, then down the steps and into the labyrinth of garden paths.</p>

  <p>A few moments more and Thorne had reached his objective - a tall sebolis
  tree standing near the wall, which he had previously marked for his purpose.
  Pausing only to hurl his sword and dagger into the faces of his pursuers, he
  scrambled up the rough tree trunk, then climbed from branch to branch until
  he was above the level of the wall.</p>

  <p>Walking out on the swaying branch until it sagged dangerously, he leaped.
  His fingers caught the edge of the wall, but it was rounded by a thousand
  years of weathering, and slippery with the night&rsquo;s accumulation of hoar
  frost.</p>

  <p>With a last despairing clutch at the curved, treacherous surface, he fell
  to the ground twenty feet below.</p>

  <p>As soon as he struck, a half dozen soldiers pounced on him. Weaponless, he
  fought them with fists and feet until Sel Han reached over and struck him on
  the head with the flat of his heavy mace. Then his captors, at a sharp
  command from the triumphant deputy, jerked him to his feet and half carried,
  half dragged him back to the palace.</p>

  <p>Neva, attended by two of her slave girls, sat on a divan with a fluffy
  wrap around her shoulders. Irintz Tel was pacing up and down, chin on chest,
  hands clasped behind his back, his brow contracted in a frown and his thin
  lips compressed in a tight line.</p>

  <p>Presently a tall, sad-faced man bearing a great, two-handed sword on his
  shoulder, strode into the room. Behind him walked a sleepy-eyed, frightened
  little boy who carried a basket.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Strike the head from this despicable traitor, Lurgo,&rdquo;
  squeaked Irintz Tel, without looking up.</p>

  <p>Lurgo the headsman lowered his huge weapon and stood leaning on the
  pommel, waiting while two warriors dragged Thorne to the center of the floor
  and forced him to kneel. Then he stepped back, carefully measured the
  distance with his practiced eye, and whirled the great blade over his
  head.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

  <p class="first">&ldquo;NO, no! Lurgo! Wait!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was Neva who had sprung from her couch, and now stood between the
  sad-faced headsman and the kneeling Thorne.</p>

  <p>Lurgo stared sorrowfully down at her, his blade still poised in mid-
  air.</p>

  <p>Irintz Tel ceased his pacing for the first time and looked up.
  &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this, daughter? Can it be that you care for this vile
  miscereant?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Care for him!&rdquo; Neva stamped her foot angrily. &ldquo;I hate
  him for the affront he has put upon me. For much less than this, you have
  caused minor offenders to suffer for days before death was finally granted
  them. Yet this seducer, this ravisher who has dared to lay hands on your own
  daughter is let off with a mere stroke of the headsman&rsquo;s sword. Do you
  hold my honor so lightly as this?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By the wrath of Deza, you are right!&rdquo; exclaimed Irintz Tel.
  &ldquo;I have been too hasty. Let be, Lurgo.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At this, the tall headsman sadly shouldered his sword and trudged away,
  the sleepy-eyed boy with the basket trailing in his wake.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Does it not seem fair, my father,&rdquo; said Neva, &ldquo;that
  since the crime of this malefactor was against me, I should be the one to
  pronounce sentence upon him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It does indeed, daughter. It does indeed,&rdquo; agreed Irintz Tel.
  &ldquo;Suppose you name his fate.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, then, I&rsquo;ll sentence him to labor in the baridium
  mines,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I hear that men are long in dying there, and
  that they suffer much.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; interposed Sel Han, &ldquo;there are
  tortures&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Since when,&rdquo; asked Neva, facing him haughtily, &ldquo;has the
  Dixtar&rsquo;s deputy acquired the right to question the mandates of the
  Dixtar&rsquo;s daughter?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are right, daughter, you are right,&rdquo; interposed Irintz
  Tel. &ldquo;You must not interfere, Sel Han. She has pronounced a fitting
  sentence, and we confirm it. Away with him, warriors.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thorne, still dazed by the blow on his head, dimly comprehended that he
  had been saved from the stroke of the sworder only to be condemned to a worse
  fate.</p>

  <p>As he was dragged away by the warriors, he saw the face of Irintz Tel
  sneering, that of Sel Han grinning malevolently, and those of the warriors
  stern and pitiless. But at Neva he did not look.</p>

  <p>After conducting him through numerous passageways, the soldiers led him
  into a small room at one end of which a hole about three feet in diameter was
  cut in the wall. Into this hole they thrust him feet first, attached a tag to
  his arm marked &ldquo;Baridium Mines,&rdquo; and gave him a violent push.
  With a speed that gave him a peculiar sensation in the pit of his stomach and
  caused a considerable pressure on his eardrums, he shot downward in a dark,
  slanting tube, the inner surface of which was as smooth as glass. Presently
  he glided over a series of rises which slowed his progress, then out into an
  open trough under a long, low shed. At the end of the trough two soldiers
  caught him and stood him erect.</p>

  <p>To his surprise, Thorne now saw that he was in one of the large warehouses
  which lined the banks of the canal over which he had passed. After the
  soldiers had examined his tag he was herded with a group of other prisoners,
  similarly tagged, who were huddled around a large globe-heater on the dock.
  Here he stood, slowly turning like the others, for while the side toward the
  heater was comfortably warm, the one directly away from it was subjected to
  the freezing temperature of the early morning air.</p>

  <p>Presently the sun, heralded only by a brief dawn-light in this tenuous
  atmosphere, popped above the horizon, its blue-white shafts instantly
  dissipating the cold, and swiftly melting the shell of ice which covered the
  canal. Moored at the dock was a low, narrow craft about two hundred feet in
  length. The hull was of brown metal, and the upper structure was roofed over
  with iridescent, amber colored crystal curved like the back of a whale.</p>

  <p>Through one of the doors the prisoners were now driven. As he followed
  along with the others, Thorne noticed the strange propulsive devices used on
  these craft, which were shaped much like the webbed feet and legs of aquatic
  birds, and were fastened at intervals along the sides.</p>

  <p>As soon as the prisoners had been herded on board, the metal door clanged
  shut behind them. Shortly thereafter the craft glided away from the dock,
  propelled smoothly and noiselessly by its artificial webbed feet.</p>

  <p>Thorne presently tired of the sameness of the scenery and entered into a
  conversation with one of his fellow unfortunates - a man who had once been
  high in the councils of the Kamud, but who had dared to oppose Irintz Tel.
  Levri Thornel was a silver-haired man in the late autumn of life. He showed
  no rancor against the Dixtar, but took his sentence as the decree of
  fate.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;At most,&rdquo; he told Thorne, &ldquo;I would have only enjoyed a
  few short years of life. But you are a young man. Your case is sad, indeed,
  as you would have had much to live for.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>For a time silence fell between them. Then Thorne asked, &ldquo;What are
  these baridium mines like? Have you any idea?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There are vast workings, which require much machinery and
  equipment, and the labor of many slaves. The baridium ore, after being
  brought up from deposits far underground, is crushed and cleaned of all
  impurities. Then it is distilled. The liquid which passes over in the still
  is mixed with phosphorus and several other chemicals, and used to fill the
  light globes with which you are familiar. The solid residue left in the
  stills is calcined until it becomes an impalpable powder, fearfully
  water-hungry. Then it is combined with several elements, the most important
  of which is metallic sodium, to make the fire- powder which instantly ignites
  when moistened.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thorne was about to ask him how all this affected the slaves, when the
  boat suddenly slowed down, then stopped beside a dock of black stone which
  jutted from the wall on the outer side of the canal. The metal door was
  thrown open, the prisoners were herded out and Thorne lost track of Levri
  Thornel.</p>

  <p>They were marched through a high archway in the thick black wall, and
  thence into an immense building constructed of the same material. Here they
  formed in line, to be examined by an officer, who assigned them to various
  working groups. Thorne was pleased when he found that Levri Thornel was
  assigned to this group, which numbered about twenty men.</p>

  <p>A guard marched them through a long corridor, lighted by small baridium
  globes, and thence into a broad courtyard which overlooked an immense pit,
  several miles in diameter, the rim of which was circled by a high black wall.
  As soon as they entered this court, the prisoners encountered air laden with
  fine dust and acrid fumes, which smarted their lungs and nostrils and set
  them to coughing and sneezing violently.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the guard urged them onward to the edge of the pit, where he
  turned them over to another guard, whose face, head and body were protected
  by a breathing mask, helmet and air-tight suit.</p>

  <p>This new guard spoke to them through a sound amplifier which projected
  from the top of his helmet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Down the stairway,&rdquo; he ordered, &ldquo;and step lively.
  I&rsquo;ll make the first laggard regret his slothfulness.&rdquo; The deeper
  they descended the more difficult breathing became, until, when they reached
  the bottom of the stairway, the fumes fairly seared their lungs, while the
  fine dust, settling on the skin, made them itch and burn. Merely being in the
  place without a protective suit was torment.</p>

  <p>As these things came to Thorne&rsquo;s attention, he thought again of
  Neva. More sharply than the baridium fumes seared his lungs, the thought of
  her perfidy seared his heart.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

  <p class="first">THE group of slaves was ushered into a large building and
  set at the task of filling and sealing small phials of fire-powder. Here the
  laborers were seated at long benches, above which were suspended large
  hoppers of the powder. This was conveyed down to them by means of tubes with
  small valves at the bottom which could be opened or closed by the operator as
  the phials were filled.</p>

  <p>Stoppers of red, resilient material like that which formed the suits of
  the guards were pressed into the bottles, then held for a moment against hot
  plates, the heat melting them down and sealing them hermetically.</p>

  <p>The labor in this department was the lightest of any in the baridium pit.
  Yet it was the most dreaded of all, as the air was constantly filled with the
  searing powder which attacked skin and lungs alike.</p>

  <p>With a sickening apprehension of the fate in store for him, Thorne
  gradually saw his own skin turning yellow from contact with the fumes and
  powder in the air. And despite the utmost watchfulness he was unable to avoid
  burning his fingers and the backs of his hands by spilling on them small
  quantities of powder which sifted down from the none too efficient valve.</p>

  <p>Whn night came the slaves were herded into a great communal building, the
  only furniture of which consisted of heating globes. Here a coarse porridge
  was doled out to them. They were given water to drink.</p>

  <p>In this building the air was somewhat freer from dust and fumes than
  outside, and therefore offered some slight relief to Thorne and other
  newcomers whose lungs and skin had not, as yet, been badly seared. After
  eating their rations, the slaves flung themselves down on the hard floor
  around the heating globes, many to fall asleep from utter exhaustion.</p>

  <p>Thorne was about to fling himself down like the others when he saw,
  sprawled on the floor at his feet, a sleeping figure that somehow seemed
  familiar. The skin was yellow and mottled with many burns, yet he could not
  mistake Yirl Du, Jen of the Takkor Free Swordsmen.</p>

  <p>Stooping, the Earthman shook his friend. Yirl Du&rsquo;s red-rimmed eyes
  blinked open. An angry snarl died in his throat as sudden recognition came to
  him. He sat up abruptly, saluted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shield my eyes, my lord. I did not dream of seeing you here, and
  at first I did not recognize you with that yellow cast to your
  skin.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You seem to have acquired considerable color yourself, old friend.
  How long have you been here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The seven judges sentenced me the day you were taken before the
  Dixtar,&rdquo; Yirl Du told him. &ldquo;The trial was a farce. There were no
  witnesses, and no evidence was produced against me except a letter from Sel
  Han.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thorne made Yirl Du and the silvery-haired Levri Thornel acquainted, and
  for a time they conversed. Then the baridium globes which lighted the
  building were hooded, and they composed themselves for sleep.</p>

  <p>It seemed, however, that he had scarcely fallen asleep when a small
  baridium hand-torch was flashed in his face, awakening him, and a guard
  prodded him with his foot.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you Sheb Takkor?&rdquo; the fellow asked in a hoarse
  whisper.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; Thorne replied.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where is he who is called Yirl Du?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He sleeps here beside me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It seems you two have a powerful friend at Dukor. My superior
  officer has ordered me to assist you hence. Awaken Yirl Du and follow
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The guard hooded his torch as Thorne shook Yirl Du awake and explained the
  situation to him. Then he thought of Levri Thornel. A touch awakened the old
  man.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come with me,&rdquo; Thorne whispered. &ldquo;It may be that we can
  escape.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then he called to the guard: &ldquo;Ready.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The fellow opened the slide of his torch only wide enough to enable him to
  make his way among the sleeping slaves who sprawled on the floor. Then he
  started toward the nearest doorway, closely followed by Thorne, Yirl Du, and
  Levri Thornel. Once outside the building, the guard hooded his torch, and
  they made their way by the light of the nearer moon, which was dropping
  swiftly toward the eastern horizon. They presently came to a small guardhouse
  near the rim of the pit. Their conductor entered, and motioned them to
  follow.</p>

  <p>Thorne marched in first, and found himself in the presence of an officer
  who sat on the edge of a swinging divan.</p>

  <p>The officer looked up sharply. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this, Hendra Suhn? You
  have brought three of them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The guard seemed dumbfounded. &ldquo;I only awakened Sheb Takkor, and told
  him to bring Yirl Du.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thorne hastened to explain. &ldquo;I am Sheb Takkor. These are my friends
  Yirl Du and Levri Thornel. It is my desire that both accompany me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was only ordered to assist two, yourself and Yirl Du,&rdquo; said
  the officer. &ldquo;Levri Thornel goes back.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If he goes back, then I go with him,&rdquo; said Thorne.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You refuse escape when it is offered you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I decline to attempt it without my friend.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The more fool, you,&rdquo; growled the officer. &ldquo;Yet I have
  my orders to assist you, and I suppose this doddering old derelict must go
  with you.&rdquo; He arose, and stepping into another room brought two bundles
  of warm clothing, and two of weapons. One bundle of each he handed to Thorne
  and the like to Yirl Du. But Thorne instantly passed his bundles to Levri
  Thornel.</p>

  <p>The officer glared for a moment, but checked himself, and went into the
  next room for more clothing and weapons, which he thrust into the hands of
  Thorne with ill grace.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You win,&rdquo; he said angrily. &ldquo;But this old wreck you
  persist in taking with you will yet cause your undoing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Swiftly the three men donned the clothing and belted sword, mace and
  dagger about them. In addition to these, each was provided with a bundle of
  javelins in a quiver that hung by a strap across one shoulder.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;As soon as the nearer moon sets,&rdquo; said the officer,
  &ldquo;and before the farther rises, you will have time to make your way in
  the dark up the side of the pit. The rim is guarded, but one guard has orders
  to pass you. That guard is stationed directly above this building. When you
  have passed the guard, you will proceed out into the desert until you have
  passed five out-cropping rocks. At the northern base of the sixth, which you
  will recognize because it leans as if it were about to fall to the ground,
  you will find supplies left there for you by your friends, because they would
  have been awkward for you to carry up the side of the pit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who are these friends who have been so thoughtful?&rdquo; asked
  Thorne.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I only know that these orders came down to me from my superiors,
  and that they must have had them from some one high in the councils of the
  Kamud.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So swiftly did the nearer moon move across the sky, that only a short time
  elapsed where it dropped below the eastern horizon. Then the three men set
  out.</p>

  <p>Overhead, the stars were blazing jewels of white, red, pale blue and
  yellow, in a sky of jet. Though their combined radiance was too feeble to
  light the path of the three fugitives, they were still of service, for their
  line of disappearance marked the rim of the pit. And one constellation which
  Thorne fixed in his mind served as a guide to the point, directly above the
  house they had just quitted, where they expected to find a friendly
  guard.</p>

  <p>Moving with great caution in order not to start a landslide on that
  steeply sloping bank, they began the ascent. It was a long, difficult climb,
  and they had scarcely reached the summit when the farther moon rose in the
  east close to the point where the nearer moon had vanished a short time
  before. Its light was more dim than that of the nearer and larger orb, but
  bright enough to reveal them to a tall guard who stood looking out over the
  pit. Instantly he raised a javelin and advanced threateningly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sheb Takkor and friends.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The guard stared at him suspiciously. &ldquo;I can pass but two. The third
  must go back.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That order was changed. You will pass three or none,&rdquo; Thorne
  told him. &ldquo;We are going on at once. Raise an alarm now, and we will
  kill you. Raise it later, and there is one high in the councils of the Kamud
  who will see that you are condemned to the powder room.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I crave pardon, Sheb Takkor Jen,&rdquo; he said humbly.
  &ldquo;Pass, and may Deza guard you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And so the three now clambered over the wall, dropped to the other side,
  and marched out into the desert, free men.</p>

  <p>Carefully, now, they counted the outcropping stones of which the officer
  had told them. They had passed the fifth, at a considerable distance from the
  pit, and were just coming up to the sixth when a half dozen warriors suddenly
  broke from a nearby clump of conifers and charged toward them, hurling a
  cloud of javelins.</p>

  <p>Thorne shouted a warning to his companions, both of whom were able to
  dodge the barbed weapons. He called to his two friends to support him on the
  right and left, then dashed straight at the advancing warriors.</p>

  <p>There was another exchange of javelins, in which the skilled Yirl Du
  transfixed an enemy, cutting the attacking party down to five.</p>

  <p>Both sides expended their store of javelins at about the same time. Then
  swords and daggers were drawn and the hand-to-hand fighting began. Thorne
  engaged the blade of the leader of the band, and was instantly beset by
  another warrior on the fellow&rsquo;s right. Over at his left, Yirl Du fought
  alone. Levri Thornel, on his right, was attacked by the remaining two, and
  showed amazing skill with sword and dagger.</p>

  <p>For a time there was only the clash of steel on steel and an occasional
  grunt from one of the wounded contestants. Then Thorne thrust the leader of
  the band through the throat. With his chief opponent out of the way it was
  but child&rsquo;s play for him to quickly dispose of the other. Then, seeing
  that Yirl Du was getting the best of his assailant, he dashed to the
  assistance of Levri Thornel.</p>

  <p>The old man still stood his ground, apparently unhurt, as Thorne came in
  to engage one of his opponents. A clumsy fencer, the fellow quickly
  succumbed. At the same instant Levri Thornel ran his antagonist through the
  heart. Turning, Thorne saw Yirl Du coming toward them, cleansing his blade
  with a bit of fabric cut from the cloak of his fallen adversary.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A glorious victory, my lord. Six enemies stretched out on the sand,
  and we three still live.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was well fought,&rdquo; agreed Thorne. &ldquo;But who could
  these men be? And how came they to be waiting here for us?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I recognized the last fellow I killed,&rdquo; said Yirl Du.
  &ldquo;He was a henchman of Sel Han. The spies of the deputy evidently
  discovered the plot to release us, and he posted these assassins here for the
  purpose of ambushing us. He expected but two, and we were three - enough to
  defeat his cutthroats and upset his scheme.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; agreed Thorne. He turned to Levri Thornel.
  &ldquo;It is you, my friend, who turned the tide. But for you, Yirl Du and I
  would now be stark on the sand in the place of these six assassins. Until I
  am able to express my appreciation more fittingly, permit me to merely thank
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is I who owe you a lasting debt of gratitude,&rdquo; protested
  the old man. &ldquo;But for you I would be down there in the pit, doomed to a
  lingering death. As it is, I - I&hellip;&rdquo; Suddenly he swayed, and
  pitched forward on his face.</p>

  <p>Alarmed, Thorne sprang to his side, and, turning him over asked:
  &ldquo;What is it, my friend? Are you ill?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ill unto death,&rdquo; the old fellow replied. &ldquo;I was wounded
  early in the engagement and have been bleeding freely since. It is the end I
  would have chosen. Farewell, my comrades.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hastily, Thorne undid his cloak, exposing a wound just above the heart.
  For a moment he held his hand there, but felt no pulsations.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Levri Thornel is dead,&rdquo; he solemnly told Yirl Du.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He was a brave man, my lord. And now we must look for that leaning
  stone, and be gone. If the morning sun finds us near the baridium pit, we too
  are dead men.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sadly, silently, they gathered their javelins and moved forward. Presently
  they came to the leaning stone.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was at the north base of the stone we were to look,&rdquo; said
  Thorne, &ldquo;yet there is nothing here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Yirl Du thrust a javelin into the sand. At a depth of about ten inches it
  encountered an obstruction. Swiftly he dropped to his knees and began
  scooping out the sand with his cupped hands.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

  <p class="first">AFTER a few moments of digging, Yirl Du grasped something
  and dragged it up out of the sand. It was a pole about eight feet in length,
  one end of which was inserted in a cylinder six inches in diameter and four
  feet long. Three pairs of straps were fastened to this cylinder and a bit of
  stirrup- shaped metal projected from its lower end.</p>

  <p>At the opposite end of the pole was a cone-shaped cushion of reddish-
  brown resilient material.</p>

  <p>Swiftly the Jen of the Takkor Free Swordsmen unearthed three more objects
  like the first, and two poles about sixteen feet long. Then he dragged out
  two large metal water bottles and two boxes, to all of which carry-straps
  were attached.</p>

  <p>Opening one of the boxes, Thorne discovered food, fire-powder and medical
  supplies. Among these was a bottle of rjembal gum. He heated some of this by
  burning a small quantity of fire-powder. Then he dressed Yirl Du&rsquo;s
  wounds and burns, after which his henchman did the like for him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now, my lord,&rdquo; said Yirl Du, &ldquo;if you will be seated I
  will strap on your desert legs for you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Although Thorne had no idea what the pole and cylinder combinations were
  for, he began to understand when his retainer brought two of them and, after
  inserting his feet in the stirrups, began strapping them to his legs. When
  they were properly fastened in place, he next strapped a box to the
  Earthman&rsquo;s back, slung his javelins in their quiver, and hung his water
  bottle by a strap across his shoulder. Then he handed him one of the
  poles.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now you are ready, my lord,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll
  be on my own desert legs very shortly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It did not take Yirl Du long to do for himself what he had done for
  Thorne. Then, grasping his pole with both hands, he thrust one end into the
  sand beside him, and drew himself up until he stood on his two long stilts.
  Thorne followed his example. With his weight on them the tops of the stilts
  were compressed a little way into the cylinders, which evidently contained
  powerful springs. The resilient, cone-shaped feet kept the stilts from
  sinking into the sand and added to the illusion of floating feather-like
  through space which the springs induced.</p>

  <p>Yirl Du started off, walking toward the northwest. Thorne attempted to
  imitate his gait, but found it quite difficult, much like walking on bed
  springs or an aerial artist&rsquo;s net. At each step his desert legs threw
  him forward like a springboard, so that several times he was compelled to use
  his long pole to keep from falling on his face.</p>

  <p>Presently he got the swing of it, whereupon Yirl Du gradually increased
  the pace until both of them were running. Not until then did the Earthman
  discover the tremendous advantage of traveling with desert legs. At each step
  the stilt now sank deeply into the cylinder, then hurled him upward and
  forward like a catapult.</p>

  <p>The night was cold and frosty, and the exercise just sufficient to make
  him draw in great lungsful of the sweet desert air. What a relief after the
  baridium pit, with its searing, acrid fumes and its deadly clouds of
  corrosive dust!</p>

  <p>As the night wore on and morning approached, the bright nearer moon once
  more popped above the western horizon, and hurtling forward to greet its
  slower, paler companion, made the sand particles and frost crystals glitter
  and sparkle. But long before the two moons could meet in the sky, the sun,
  heralded by a brief flash of silver-gray light, shot above the eastern
  horizon in the full blaze of its glory, and both satellites faded from
  view.</p>

  <p>A few moments later, Yirl Du sighted a clump of conifers, and the two men
  made for it. They found a dry waterhole, but this did not daunt them with
  their full bottles, and the trees offered concealment and shade. Unstrapping
  their desert legs, they gathered firewood, brewed pulcho, and with the hot,
  stimulating beverage, washed down their morning meal of dried meat and hard
  traveler&rsquo;s cakes. Then, after extinguishing their fire with sand, they
  stretched out in the shade to sleep.</p>

  <p>Thorne fell asleep almost immediately. Nor did he awaken until Yirl Du
  shook him soundly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The day is all but sped, my lord,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have
  brewed fresh pulcho and prepared our evening meal. We should eat and be ready
  to start as soon as the sun sets.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What of our enemies? It seems strange that no signs of pursuit have
  developed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But they have developed,&rdquo; replied Yirl Du. &ldquo;I am a
  light sleeper, and several times during the day as I lay awake, I saw bands
  of warriors mounted on gawrs flying overhead. Had they paused to search our
  hiding place we would have been killed or captured long ere this. Fortunately
  they did not.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The sun set just as they finished their meal, and they packed their
  belongings and strapped on their desert legs by the light of the nearer moon.
  Then they set out once more. Yirl Du had estimated that by traveling all
  night and sleeping during the daytime, they would be able to reach the edge
  of the Takkor Marsh in three nights. Here he would know how to find Thaine,
  if she were still alive and uncaptured, and they would be able to fulfill
  Thorne&rsquo;s promise to help her search for her father.</p>

  <p>They made swift progress traveling by the light of the nearer moon, but it
  soon set and as on the night before there was a period of darkness during
  which only the stars and planets glittered overhead. This slowed them down
  considerably, as they were forced to proceed in the dark with extreme
  caution. And so, when the farther moon appeared above the eastern horizon,
  they welcomed it with joy, for it meant that they could set out once more at
  full speed.</p>

  <p>They had traveled for some time by its pale light when Thorne noticed,
  over at his left, an object projecting above the horizon which he at first
  took for a tall, tufted conifer. But he suddenly became aware that it was
  moving; not like a tree swaying in the breeze, but actually traveling over
  the ground and coming with considerable speed in his direction. As the thing
  rapidly drew closer he was able to make out a huge head with a hooked beak, a
  long, scrawny neck, and a large, bird-like body supported by two legs, each
  of which was at least fifteen feet in length. The head of the monster, he
  judged, towered at least thirty feet above the ground.</p>

  <p>He called to his companion. &ldquo;Ho, Yirl Du. Do you see what is coming
  after us?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His henchman looked around. &ldquo;A koree! We must hasten, or we are dead
  men. It is the great man-eating bird of the desert.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They accelerated their pace from a trot to a run. Soon they had lengthened
  their thirty-foot steps to nearly fifty. But the koree kept coming on, and
  despite their utmost exertions, gaining on them.</p>

  <p>Thorne, less skillful with the desert legs than his companion, began to
  fall behind, while the monster, still shortening the distance between them
  soon towered only fifty feet behind. It was a hideous thing - a giant bird
  with a crest of waving plumes, and a huge curved beak that looked fully
  capable of cutting a man in two with a single snap.</p>

  <p>Its long lean neck was bare of feathers and covered with a wrinkled,
  leathery skin. Like the neck, the body was leathery and naked. The wings,
  which were short and obviously useless for flight, were featherless, but
  covered with sharp, horny protuberances which made them quite formidable
  weapons. The long legs were armored with large, rough scales, and the toes
  were equipped with sickle-shaped retractile claws. The monster ran with its
  ugly head projecting far forward and its wings sticking stiffly out from its
  leathery body, as if to prevent its intended victim from suddenly doubling
  back to the right or left.</p>

  <p>In the meantime Yirl Du, noticing that the koree was likely to catch up
  with Thorne at any moment, dropped back beside him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We must separate,&rdquo; Yirl Du told him. &ldquo;The bird will
  follow one of us. The other must then turn and follow it, hurling as many
  javelins into it as possible.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They separated, and the bird followed Thorne. Yirl Du instantly turned and
  pursued it. His first throw struck just behind the left wing, but despite his
  great strength and skill at hurling the javelin, he was only able to drive it
  through that tough skin for a little way. A second, striking below it,
  penetrated to a depth of about a foot. But it was enough to exasperate the
  monster, which turned and rushed at its persistent tormentor.</p>

  <p>Thorne now turned and hurled a javelin. Striking at the point where the
  right leg joined the body it only penetrated deeply enough for the barb to
  hold. He tried a second cast, this time throwing with all his might. The
  javelin passed clear over the body of the bird and struck it in the back of
  the neck. Like the first, however, it only sank in up to the first barb, and
  therefore did not do much damage. It was enough, however, to make the monster
  turn and charge him.</p>

  <p>Instantly the Earthman shot out at right angles to the course he had been
  following. But he made the mistake of watching the bird without looking at
  the ground before him, and ran straight into a tangle of desert sand-flowers.
  First one stilt, then the other, caught in the snarl of tough vines, and he
  plunged, face downward, into the sand about twenty feet beyond.</p>

  <p>He managed to retain his grip on the long pole he carried, although it had
  been split when he fell, and now, after turning on his back, attempted to
  raise himself onto his desert legs once more.</p>

  <p>But he was not quick enough. Already the koree towered above him, its huge
  beak distended for the kill.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

  <p class="first">AS the frightful head of the koree darted down to seize him,
  Thorne, lying where he had fallen, gripped his walking pole with both hands.
  Instinctively he struck at the descending horror with the pole.</p>

  <p>The blow did the creature no injury, but it did distract the
  monster&rsquo;s attention from the man. Evidently taking the pole for a part
  of Thorne&rsquo;s anatomy, it seized it with the immense beak, and, bracing
  its feet like a robin drawing a worm from the ground, pulled upward.</p>

  <p>Thorne, still clinging to the pole, was surprised to find himself standing
  on his desert legs once more, not three feet from the base of that leathery
  neck, which the bird had stretched to the utmost. Still clinging to the pole
  with his left hand, he whipped out his sword with his right. Then he slashed
  at that taut neck; the keen, saw-edged blade sheared through to the vertebral
  column.</p>

  <p>As the blood spurted from the gaping wound, the Earthman let go of the
  pole and sprang away, almost colliding with Yirl Du, who had hurled all his
  remaining javelins in a fruitless effort to distract the monster&rsquo;s
  attention, and was now rushing in with drawn sword. The bird dropped the pole
  and plunged after them. But it had only taken a few steps when it collapsed
  and lay still.</p>

  <p>Cautiously, the two men now approached the fallen giant. Yirl Du let
  himself to the ground, unstrapped his desert legs and set about gathering the
  javelins that still had sound shafts. This done, he recovered Thorne&rsquo;s
  walking pole for him. Then he donned his desert legs once more, and they
  resumed their journey.</p>

  <p>Morning found them in a bleak section of the desert that was devoid of
  vegetation as far as they could see in every direction. As there was no fuel
  available, they washed their dry rations down with plain water instead of
  pulcho. Then they buried their desert legs, poles, boxes and bottles in the
  sand, dug other holes, and covered themselves until nothing showed but their
  transparent masks. Thus, protected from the sun as well as the prying eyes of
  any pursuers who might chance to fly over this spot, they slept.</p>

  <p>As soon as the sun had set they had another cold meal and were off again.
  In the early hours before dawn, when the combined light of both moons made
  everything stand out clearly around them, they reached the top of a rugged
  cliff which somehow looked familiar to Thorne. Then he recalled that a line
  of such cliffs rimmed the ancient ocean bed which the Takkor Marsh lay.</p>

  <p>They paused on the brink and looked over. About a hundred feet below them
  was a broad ledge. At approximately the same distance below that was still
  another. And seventy feet farther down was the sloping, boulder-strewn
  beach.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, to Thorne&rsquo;s consternation, Yirl Du deliberately stepped
  over the edge of the cliff. The Earthman uttered an exclamation of horror as
  he saw his henchman drop straight toward the ledge a hundred feet below. But
  Yirl Du alighted squarely on his desert legs, sank almost to the depth of the
  cylinders, and then shot forward and upward. Soaring over the rim of the
  ledge on which he stood, he dropped to the next, bounced onward again, and
  alighted on the ground below.</p>

  <p>Thorne decided to risk the jump. Accordingly, he stepped over the edge of
  the cliff into empty air.</p>

  <p>There was a vertical rush of wind past his face, then his stilts plunged
  almost to the tops of the cylinders, and he shot upward once more. As he had
  neglected to throw himself far enough forward he bounced twice before he got
  over the rim of the ledge. But when he next alighted he knew how to throw his
  weight to the front so he was catapulted over the rim. A moment later he
  joined Yirl Du, and together they scrambled down the sloping beach until they
  came to a zone of trees, vines and underbrush so thickly entangled that they
  made any further use of the desert legs impossible.</p>

  <p>They let themselves to the ground, and removing these devices, hid them in
  the underbrush together with the poles, and continued their advance
  afoot.</p>

  <p>The rising sun found them on the bank of a little stream at the edge of
  the marsh. Here they brewed pulcho and ate their morning meal. Then they
  flung themselves down for a short rest, lying so that the sun would awaken
  them by mid-morning.</p>

  <p>Thorne awoke first. To his delight, he noticed that the yellow
  discoloration from the baridium fumes had entirely disappeared from Yirl
  Du&rsquo;s skin. He examined his own hands. They, too, had returned to their
  normal color. As he had no mirror in which to view his face, he went down to
  the stream.</p>

  <p>He had knelt on the bank, and was just parting the rushes, when a
  reflection in the water before him made him look up. A huge black bat was
  pursuing what at first glance appeared to be a large butterfly. Apparently
  disabled, the smaller creature fluttered groundward, falling into the rushes
  not ten feet from Thorne.</p>

  <p>In a steep spiral, the bat swooped toward its fallen prey. Leaping to his
  feet, Thorne saw the futile fluttering of a pair of lacy, opalescent wings
  above the rushes, and knew that in a moment more the bat would claim its
  victim. He jerked a javelin from his quiver and hurled it at the descending
  monster. It struck the black, furry neck with such force that the barbed head
  emerged from the other side.</p>

  <p>Now it was the bat which tumbled into the rushes, only a few feet from the
  creature it had struck down.</p>

  <p>Having satisfied himself that the ugly thing was dead, Thorne stepped over
  for a closer look at its intended prey. But as he did so, the lacy wings
  suddenly rose above the bushes, and he stifled a cry of amazement when he saw
  that they were attached to the shoulders of a slender, perfectly formed girl
  about three feet in height.</p>

  <p>Save for a girdle of filmy, pale green material drawn tight at the waist
  by a belt of exquisitely wrought golden mesh and ending in a short skirt, she
  was nude. Her silky skin was a perfect flesh tint, and covered with fine
  down, delicate as peach bloom. Her golden yellow hair was bound by a fillet
  of woven green jade links, circling her forehead just below two delicate,
  feathery antennae, which swept upward and backward like a pair of dainty
  plumes.</p>

  <p>As he stood staring down at her, scarcely believing his eyes, she suddenly
  faded from his view.</p>

  <p>The Earthman blinked and looked again. But where she had stood he now saw
  only the rushes which had been bent downward by the weight of her tiny
  body.</p>

  <p>Faintly he heard the fluttering of wings overhead. He looked up and saw
  only the empty sky. Suddenly a little pixie voice, musical as a silver bell,
  broke the silence.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know you now, man of the Old Race,&rdquo; it said. &ldquo;You are
  Sheb Takkor, the younger. You have saved the life of Eriné, daughter of the
  Vil of the Ulfi, and she is not ungrateful. Hold out your hand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In obedient wonder, he extended his hand. A glittering something dropped
  into his palm. He saw that it was a tiny ring fashioned from platinum and set
  with a sparkling green gem.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you should ever need the Ulfi, rub the jewel and if there is an
  Ulf within scent of the ring he will be yours to command.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very kind of you,&rdquo; said Thorne, &ldquo;but&hellip;&rdquo; He
  suddenly realized that the fluttering had stopped. He was talking to empty
  air.</p>

  <p>Yirl Du had come down the bank and was surveying him quizzically.
  &ldquo;Your pardon, my lord. Were you speaking to me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. No. I was speaking to an Ulf - that is, to an Ulf
  maiden.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Has one of the Little People paid us a visit?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not intentionally, I guess. You see, she was struck down by that
  bat.&rdquo; Thorne indicated the carcass. &ldquo;I saw her fall, thinking her
  only a butterfly, yet I pitied the creature and so slew the bat with a
  javelin. She became invisible and presented me with this.&rdquo; He held out
  the ring.</p>

  <p>Yirl Du exclaimed with astonishment. &ldquo;Why, that is indeed a precious
  thing, my lord, and such a gift as only the Vil of the Ulfi or a member of
  his family might present to a man.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She named herself Eriné, daughter of the Vil.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thorne was brimming over with questions about the Little People, but
  resolved to curb his curiosity until he could talk to Thaine or Lal Vak. Sheb
  Takkor, he reasoned, would be supposed to know these things. To question Yirl
  Du about them would be to make him suspect either that he was not Sheb
  Takkor, or that he had taken leave of his senses.</p>

  <p>He kept silence while they climbed the bank to get their belongings.
  Thorne was about to strap his box to his back when Yirl Du said, &ldquo;Wait.
  Let us first get our water-shoes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Water-shoes! I didn&rsquo;t see any in my box.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Yirl Du opened his box and took out a cylinder of rolled, reddish brown
  material. The Earthman then remembered having seen such a cylinder in his
  box, and extracted it. Unrolling it, he found it consisted of two hollow
  pieces of resilient material, to each of which was attached a small tube with
  a shut- off valve. He observed that Yirl Du had opened the valve on one of
  his and was inflating it by blowing through the tube, so he followed his
  example. Soon each had a pair of buoyant, boat-shaped water-shoes.</p>

  <p>After adjusting their weapons and other paraphernalia, they carried the
  shoes down to the water&rsquo;s edge and donned them by pushing their toes
  under elastic bands designed to cross the arch of the foot. This done, they
  stepped out onto the surface of the stream.</p>

  <p>Yirl Du started off downstream, moving with strokes much like those of a
  skater. Thorne, trying to imitate him, found that water-shoeing was more
  difficult than it looked. At the first attempt, his legs spread so far apart
  he came near to sitting down in midstream. Again and again he tried to glide
  forward as his henchman had done, but it always seemed that both feet were
  very definitely bent on traveling in different directions.</p>

  <p>Observing his efforts, Yirl Du said, &ldquo;I fear we should have rested
  longer, my lord. You have grown weak from your wounds.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, just out of practice,&rdquo; Thorne told him. &ldquo;I
  didn&rsquo;t use any water- shoes while I was at school, you know. I&rsquo;ll
  get back the hang of it, presently.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And at length, by persistent effort, he did get the hang of it. By the
  time the sun had reached the zenith they were moving side by side in perfect
  unison, with long, rhythmic strokes. During this time they had traveled on a
  dozen winding streams, crossed six small lakes, and three times removed their
  water-shoes for short jaunts across the land.</p>

  <p>At present they were gliding across the calm, mirror-like bosom of a lake
  much larger than any they had crossed thus far, when Thorne, chancing to
  notice a shadowy reflection in the placid water at his right, looked upward.
  To his alarm, he saw that a group of about twenty warriors, each mounted on a
  gawr, were gliding down toward them. And the warriors were mail-clad, round-
  bodied yellow men.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look, Yirl Du!&rdquo; he cried, pointing aloft. &ldquo;The Ma
  Gongi!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His companion took one look. &ldquo;Straight toward that point of land,
  quickly! It is our only hope.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They had been making for the mouth of a little stream, beside which the
  point of land projected. Now they turned almost at right angles to their
  course and made for the shore which was about two hundred yards distant.</p>

  <p>But they had traveled only a few strokes toward their objective when a
  large net, hanging on four cables, was dropped by one of their pursuers. In
  an instant it had scooped up Yirl Du. Thorne saw him struggling futilely like
  some captured wild thing - saw him draw his dagger and vainly try to cut the
  metallic meshes.</p>

  <p>Then the Earthman heard a swish in the water behind him, and he, too, was
  scooped up in a huge net.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch17"
     name="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

  <p class="first">AS soon as he felt the net swish under him in the water,
  Thorne instinctively dived forward in an effort to evade it. But it had
  traveled too far beneath him to make such an attempt successful. However, he
  was able to catch hold of the rim with both hands, and clung to this as he
  was borne aloft, so he did not sink into the coils as Yirl Du had done.</p>

  <p>An instant later he was soaring fifty feet above the treetops, and though
  he well knew the risk he ran, decided on a desperate attempt at escape.
  Accordingly, he drew himself up until the edge of the net was on a level with
  his thighs, then turned a somersault and let go, falling feet foremost.</p>

  <p>His feet were still thrust through the bands of his pneumatic water-
  shoes, and these helped, to a considerable extent, in breaking his fall as he
  crashed downward through the branches of a large tree. Straight down through
  the foliage he plunged, and upon striking the ground bounced upward like a
  rubber ball on his resilient water-shoes. After several gradually diminishing
  bounces, he checked himself by clutching a shrub. Then he swiftly removed the
  water-shoes, and, taking them under his arm, dashed away through the thick
  undergrowth.</p>

  <p>So dense was the leafy tangle overhead that Thorne was unable to see his
  enemies, though he heard their shouts and learned that a warrior was landing.
  But this same dense canopy prevented his enemies from seeing him, and for
  this he was thankful.</p>

  <p>He was grieved by the capture of his faithful retainer, but he could not
  possibly help Yirl Du, and would only render his own capture or death
  certain. Moreover, there was his debt to Thaine. Somehow he must contrive to
  escape for her sake.</p>

  <p>It was not long before he came to a narrow stream, almost completely
  concealed from observers in the sky by the branches and lianas which arched
  and interlaced across it.</p>

  <p>The stream, he soon found, had seemingly endless ramifications, and he
  traveled for several hours; in this manner he grew weary, hungry and thirsty,
  and decided to stop for rest and refreshment. Instead of sleeping directly
  out on the bank, he caught hold of a low-hanging liana, by means of this he
  reached another, and swung himself up into a tree. Removing his water-shoes
  and slinging them over his back, he now traveled for some distance by
  swinging from tree to tree before alighting on the ground.</p>

  <p>Wearily he flung himself down on a bed of soft moss beneath the spreading
  branches of an immense, aromatic sebolis tree. Then, after a pull at his
  water flask, he opened his box and removed therefrom a ration of dried meat
  and a cake. These he washed down with copious droughts of cold water. He
  rested there on the moss for a while, then packed up and wandered on.</p>

  <p>As he felt that he had effectively baffled his pursuers, and knew that he
  was hopelessly lost, he saw no great need for haste. And so he wandered on
  through this strange Martian jungle, pausing at times to examine odd flowers
  or fruits, and marveling at its fantastic and often gigantic insect life, as
  well as its many queer beasts, birds and reptiles.</p>

  <p>Part of the time he walked on boggy land from which the water oozed at
  each step, and often he splashed through shallow pools. At other times he was
  compelled to don his water-shoes to cross flooded areas where the trees stood
  in the water.</p>

  <p>There were also considerable stretches of high, dry land, usually quite
  heavily wooded.</p>

  <p>Shortly after he had entered one of these he suddenly sighted a colony of
  pale green caterpillars, the bodies and heads of which were protected by
  sharp yellow spikes. There was a great diversity of size among them, the
  smallest being barely an inch in length, while the largest were more than
  three feet long and proportionately thick. All were browsing on leaves except
  a few of the largest individuals, which were busy spinning cocoons. He
  noticed many finished cocoons hanging from limbs by twisted, rope-like
  fastenings. They were pale green in color, and of a glistening, silky
  texture.</p>

  <p>Presently he came to one hanging directly above his path, its lower tip at
  the height of his head. Curiously, he extended his hand to feel the silky
  covering, and pinched it to test its thickness. But scarcely had he done so
  ere a mournful, wailing cry smote his ears. It sounded much like the cry of a
  new-born human child, and seemed to come from the cocoon he had touched.</p>

  <p>He jerked his hand away, but the wailing continued. Then he was suddenly
  aware of the whirring of a host of invisible wings in the air above him.
  There was a sharp twang, and a tiny arrow embedded itself in the ground at
  his feet. A second whizzed past his ear, and a third grazed his arm.</p>

  <p>He realized that he was being attacked by the Little People, and suddenly
  he thought of the ring. Snatching it from the pouch in which he had placed
  it, he rubbed it briskly on his palm. At this the twanging of the bowstrings
  ceased, and where he had only heard the beating of their wings, he now saw a
  number of Ulf men hovering in the air.</p>

  <p>All of them were slightly larger than Eriné; there was as much diversity
  of appearance among them as there would have been in a similar sized group of
  humans. Their antennae were longer than those of the Ulf girl, and projected
  from shiny metal headpieces, notched at the front to let them through. They
  wore shirts of light chain-mail which reached to their thighs, drawn in at
  the middle by green silk belts from which depended swords and daggers. In
  addition to these weapons, each man carried a small bow in his hand, and a
  quiver of arrows strapped to his thigh.</p>

  <p>One of the tiny warriors alighted on the ground, and advancing, saluted
  Thorne respectfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fleeswin, a Jen of the Ulf Archers, shields his eyes in the light
  of your presence, man of the Old Race and friend of Estabil, the Great
  One,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We regret that we attacked you unknowingly, and
  humbly craving your pardon, place ourselves at your disposal and under your
  command.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My greetings to you and your archers, Fleeswin Jen,&rdquo; Thorne
  answered, returning his salute. &ldquo;Actuated by curiosity I touched this
  cocoon, not meaning to injure it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Our infants are easily frightened by the touch of strangers,&rdquo;
  Fleeswin said, &ldquo;and we who guard them cannot watch them all at one
  time. We would lose many that might otherwise be saved if they did not summon
  us when menaced or interfered with.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then I am fortunate that your marksmanship was no
  better.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Had you been one of the Ma Gongi, you would now be bristling with
  arrows,&rdquo; Fleeswin hastened to inform him. &ldquo;But we saw you were of
  the Old Race, so only shot to drive you away. What would you with us, Bearer
  of the Ring?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you can help me to find Thaine, daughter of Miradon Vil,
  I&rsquo;ll be grateful,&rdquo; Thorne answered. &ldquo;I am the Rad of Takkor
  and her friend.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>As soon as he had announced his title, every member of the little company
  saluted. &ldquo;We are doubly honored,&rdquo; said Fleeswin, &ldquo;that you
  prove to be the Lord of Takkor as well as a Bearer of the Ring. As for
  finding Thaine, if she is anywhere within the Takkor Marsh, our Vil can find
  her for you. Permit me to conduct you to him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>After sending a warrior ahead to announce their coming, and placing
  another in temporary charge of the archers, Fleeswin led the way. Presently,
  above the drone of insects and the songs of birds, Thorne heard a haunting
  exquisite fantasy of sound which seemed to emanate from a carillon of no less
  than a thousand tiny silver-tongued bells. Yet he knew, as he drew closer,
  that it was not bells he heard but a chorus of Ulf voices. Soon he was able
  to distinguish the words of their song, and was surprised to learn that it
  was a paean of welcome for him.</p>

  <p>A moment later he and Fleeswin emerged into a pleasant glen, the
  verdure-clothed sides of which rose steeply at his right and left. The place
  literally swarmed with the Ulfi, both male and female, and all were singing -
  some hanging suspended in the air with fanning wings, some perched in the
  trees or upon outcropping rocks on the hillside, some standing in cave
  mouths, with which the place was honeycombed, and others gathered on the
  mossy ground.</p>

  <p>Fleeswin now kept to the ground, marching as if some great and honorable
  task had been delegated to him. As Thorne came abreast of the first singers,
  these began showering him with tiny, fragrant white blossoms. Then a group of
  two-score pretty Ulf maidens fluttered down and some draped Thorne with
  garlands while others strewed flowers before him.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the music ceased, and Thorne, his body swathed with ropes of
  blossoms, found himself standing before a jovial looking pot-bellied old Ulf
  with a merry twinkle in his eyes. He sat enthroned on the lip of a large
  lily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Greetings, Sheb Takkor Rad,&rdquo; cried the little old fellow on
  the lily throne, returning his salute. &ldquo;Estabil, Vil of the Ulfi, bids
  you welcome to Ulf-land, and desires to publicly thank you for saving the
  life of his precious daughter, Eriné. If there is aught that Estabil can do
  for you, you have but to make known your wishes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wish to find&hellip;&rdquo; Thorne began.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll spare you the trouble of saying more,&rdquo; Estabil
  interrupted. &ldquo;You wish to find Thaine. That we can promise to perform
  for you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He leaped nimbly down from the lily throne, and continued: &ldquo;Now that
  that is done, will you not stay to eat and drink with us?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Thorne assured him, &ldquo;but it is important
  that I find Thaine, quickly. I should prefer to stay only long enough to
  drink a friendly cup with you, though if I were not pressed for time your
  hospitality would be most welcome. I&rsquo;m sure you understand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We do. Indeed we do,&rdquo; Estabil replied. He turned and raised
  his hand, whereupon a little bearded Ulf struck a gong. Then there issued
  from the mouth of a cave in the hillside a figure Thorne instantly
  recognized. It was Eriné. Behind her came an Ulf maiden bearing a golden tray
  on which reposed three tiny platinum cups that sparkled with jewels, and a
  jar.</p>

  <p>Thorne saluted as the Vil&rsquo;s daughter approached, and she smiled up
  at him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hoped I might greet you at the banquet table,&rdquo; she said,
  &ldquo;but since you cannot tarry with us, I bring you the cup of friendship
  and of farewell.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So saying, she filled the three jeweled cups from the jar, handed one to
  Thorne, one to her father, and retained one for herself.</p>

  <p>Estabil raised his cup.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Once there was a Rad of Takkor,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;who,
  wandering through his marshlands saw an Ulf maiden about to be done&rsquo; to
  death by a savage monster of the air. The Rad slew the monster and rescued
  the Ulf maiden, who proved to be the daughter of the Vil of the Ulfi. Every
  Ulf, from the Vil to his lowliest subject, will never forget. And in this cup
  we pledge to the Rad of Takkor our eternal friendship.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He and Eriné both raised their cups to their lips, and Thorne followed
  their example. &ldquo;The Rad of Takkor gratefully accepts the pledge of
  friendship of the Ulfi,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and is deeply sensible of the
  honor thus bestowed upon him. In return, he pledges his lasting friendship to
  Estabil, his lovely daughter, and his loyal subjects.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>As soon as they had emptied their cups, Estabil raised his hand. Behind
  him the gong sounded twice, and a dozen Ulf warriors, flying six on a side,
  emerged from the mouth of a cave high on the hillside, bearing between them a
  rectangle of silken fabric about eight feet long and four wide. They alighted
  in front of the Vil, and saluted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Rad of Takkor is ready to be conveyed to the house of
  Thaine,&rdquo; he said. Then he turned to Thorne. &ldquo;Seat yourself in the
  middle of the cloth, my lord,&rdquo; he invited, &ldquo;and you will be
  carried swiftly and safely to your destination.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Though he was not entirely reassured as to the safety of this fragile
  conveyance, Thorne did as directed.</p>

  <p>The Vil raised his hand. The gong sounded three strokes. Then the wings of
  the twelve Ulf warriors began whirring rapidly, and Thorne felt himself
  rising. All around him the Ulfi burst into song. He waved farewell. A moment
  later he was gliding over the treetops, the Ulf-song swiftly dying in the
  distance.</p>

  <p>Presently they flew out over a lake, in the center of which was an island.
  Straight to the island they took him, and set him down in the midst of it in
  a small clearing.</p>

  <p>One of the Ulf warriors touched his arm and pointed. &ldquo;There is the
  house of Thaine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thorne gazed intently in the direction the little fellow indicated.
  Presently he was able to make out what had entirely escaped his attention
  before - a small, irregularly shaped stone house, camouflaged with vines and
  creepers, and surrounded by trees.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, I see it now. I am beholden to you and your Vil for this favor.
  Please convey my thanks to him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>One of the little warriors rolled the cloth into a bundle and thrust it
  beneath his arm. All twelve of them saluted and swiftly faded from view.</p>

  <p>He crossed the clearing, and entering an opening in the vines, found a
  large circular doorway cut in the stone. The door stood open, revealing a
  large room with several swinging chairs, suspended divans, and a fireplace.
  Three circular doorways cut in the walls led to other rooms.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thaine,&rdquo; he called, then waited expectantly.</p>

  <p>There was no answer.</p>

  <p>He was about to call her a second time when he suddenly heard a low growl
  from one of the rooms beyond. Then, out of that room streaked a huge
  black-haired beast with short legs, webbed feet, a paddle-shaped tail armed
  with spikes, and a cavernous mouth as large as that of a crocodile. He
  instantly recognized it as a dalf.</p>

  <p>There was but one thing to do, and that quickly. Thorne seized the handle
  of the great door of thick planking, and swung it shut. A moment later he
  felt the impact of the heavy beast on the other side. He kept his hand on the
  latch, and it was well that he did so, for he suddenly felt that it was being
  pressed upward from the other side. Recalling the remarkable sagacity of
  these creatures, he was convinced that the beast was trying to open the
  door.</p>

  <p>He was looking around for something with which to brace the latch, when he
  suddenly heard another growl, this time behind him. Turning, he beheld a
  second dalf, black with a ring of bright yellow fur circling its neck,
  swiftly bearing down upon him.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN he saw the second dalf charging toward him, Thorne
  whipped out his sword and raised it to defend himself. But he lowered it
  again. &ldquo;Tezzu!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>At this the demeanor of the beast suddenly changed. Instead of charging,
  it now bounded playfully up to him, then began skipping and leaping around
  him and making little purring noises deep in its throat.</p>

  <p>And now, in the same leafy opening through which the beast had appeared,
  he saw a slender, girlish figure carrying a basket of fish and a trident.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thaine!&rdquo; he cried.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hahr Ree Thorne! It&rsquo;s really you! I&rsquo;m so
  glad!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Dropping basket and trident, she ran forward, flung her arms around his
  neck and, much to his amazement, kissed him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I thought you would never come. I feared they had killed
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They tried hard enough,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;but I got away
  and came as soon as I could.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you did. Let us go inside while I prepare something
  to eat. Why do you stand there holding the latch?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Because one of your dalfs is on the other side, trying to get at
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Neem. He won&rsquo;t molest you, now that I am
  here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thus reassured, Thorne opened the door. Neem, the great black dalf,
  waddled out to meet his mistress, but paid no attention to the Earthman. The
  latter picked up the basket and trident, and they went in.</p>

  <p>Thorne insisted upon helping Thaine prepare the meal, and they soon had
  pulcho brewing, fish grilling, and fresh cakes baking.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;From your floral decorations, I judge that you have been among the
  Little People,&rdquo; said Thaine, as she turned a browned slab of fish.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You judge correctly,&rdquo; Thorne replied. &ldquo;In fact it was a
  dozen of their warriors who brought me here. Then they saluted and
  disappeared. Do you know anything about that strange power of theirs - making
  themselves invisible?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen them do it many times,&rdquo; she told him,
  &ldquo;yet how they do it remains a mystery. Our scientists believe they are
  able to surround themselves with auras of photo-electric force which cause
  light rays to bend around them and anything within the auras, such as their
  weapons and clothing. Since we see objects only by means of light rays
  reflected from them into our eyes, if the rays miss them or bend around them
  they are invisible to us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sounds reasonable enough,&rdquo; said Thorne. &ldquo;But what is
  this force?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;One might as well ask, &lsquo;What is electricity, or magnetism, or
  gravity?&rsquo; We know that when they are very weary, or weakened by wounds
  or illness, they are unable to generate this strange force.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That explains why Eriné was visible when pursued by the bat. She
  must have been exhausted.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The bat?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thorne told her how he had saved the life of the daughter of the Vil of
  the Ulfi, and showed her the ring.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is a precious gift, and one not lightly bestowed,&rdquo; said
  Thaine. &ldquo;I have one like it, and so has my father, but only because he
  once saved the life of the Vil of the Little People.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You remind me, that we were to go in search of your father. Have
  you had any word from him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;None. Even the Ulfi are baffled, and they know almost everything
  that takes place in this marsh. I fear I shall never see him
  again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thorne saw the tears gathering in her eyes. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find your
  father, never fear,&rdquo; he said reassuringly. &ldquo;And now that the food
  is ready, let us eat, and I will tell you of my adventures since I last saw
  you. I owe you an explanation for staying away so long.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>When he had finished, she pounced on that very part of the story which he
  most wished to forget. &ldquo;This Neva, is she very beautiful?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very, even though she is deceitful and cruel.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You love her?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Would you love a person who had tricked you - then condemned you to
  a horrible, lingering death?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Thaine, refilling his pulcho cup for him,
  &ldquo;is not an answer but an evasion.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well then, if you must have it, I wish I had never seen her. But I
  bore you with these troubles of mine. Let us speak no more of
  them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My poor Hahr Ree Thorne,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You do not bore
  me. Your troubles are my troubles, for are we not true friends?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thaine,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are a real friend.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am glad,&rdquo; she said softly, and laid her cheek against his
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>Presently she leaned forward, half turned, and gazed up into his face.
  &ldquo;Look at me, Hahr Ree Thorne. Is this Neva really so much more
  beautiful than I?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What a question!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just like a
  woman to think of a poser like that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Another evasion,&rdquo; she countered, &ldquo;but it tells me what
  I wanted to find out. She is more beautiful.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He studied her smilingly. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say so. &ldquo;She is a
  blonde, you are a brunette. She is a great beauty of her type, and you of
  yours. You and Neva are gems of equal luster, but different.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, then, perhaps I can make you forget this Neva.&rdquo; Before
  he was aware of what she was about, she had turned still more - was lying
  back across his arm. Her eyes were dark wells of enchantment. Her red lips,
  half parted, drew him seductively.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you kiss me?&rdquo; she pouted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You little witch!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Fiercely he bent down - crushed those warm red lips against his own.</p>

  <p>For a moment, she suffered his caress, unresisting. Then, with a little
  frightened gasp she broke from his embrace - returned to her place beside the
  pulcho jar. Mechanically, she filled their cups. Tears trembled on her long,
  dark lashes. Her lips quiverd ever so slightly as she handed him his cup.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, Thaine, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I - I didn&rsquo;t know it would be like that,&rdquo; she
  quavered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t really love me, then?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wish I really knew.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At this juncture there was the noise of huge wings flapping overhead,
  followed by a thud. Thorne knew from the sounds that a gawr had just flown
  over the house and landed in the clearing. Both dalfs sprang up, growling
  ominously, but Thaine silenced them.</p>

  <p>Then, accompanied by Thorne, she ran to the door and peered through the
  leafy screen.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch19"
     name="ch19"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN Thorne looked out through the leafy screen that
  camouflaged the door of Thaine&rsquo;s island home, he saw that a warrior in
  the uniform of an officer of the Kamud had dismounted in the clearing. The
  fellow was leading his gawr beneath the branches of a large, spreading tree,
  where the bird-beast would be concealed from observers flying overhead. The
  newcomer walked with the peculiar, rolling gait of a man whose legs are
  abnormally short in proportion to the rest of his body.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Yirl Du!&rdquo; Thorne exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Keeping cautiously beneath the trees which fringed the clearing, Yirl Du
  circled toward the house. A few moments later he entered the opening in the
  screen. To Thorne he rendered the usual salutation, but to Thaine, the royal
  salute. This surprised the Earthman until he remembered that she was the
  daughter of Miradon Vil, and therefore entitled to the homage due a
  princess.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have news - momentous news,&rdquo; said Yirl Du as he entered the
  hut.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have - have you news of my father?&rdquo; Thaine asked,
  anxiously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ill news,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;His majesty is in the clutches
  of Sel Han, who has imprisoned him in Castle Takkor.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We must find a way to rescue him,&rdquo; exclaimed Thorne.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wait, I have not told you all,&rdquo; Yirl Du said. &ldquo;Perhaps
  I had best begin at the beginning. After I was netted by Sel Han&rsquo;s Ma
  Gongi, they searched a while for you, my lord. But at last they gave up the
  chase and flew with me to Castle Takkor. I found the castle garrisoned
  entirely by Ma Gongi, with Sur Det and a few of his cronies in command. Sur
  Det had been rescued from the prison pen by Sel Han.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It seems that some time ago the yellow scientists rediscovered how
  to generate the deadly green ray used in warfare by their ancestors. Since
  then they have been building large ray projectors, not as yet being able to
  manufacture small hand projectors powerful enough for efficient use. With
  four of these projectors and an army of Ma Gongi mounted on gawrs, Sel Han
  yesterday flew to Dukor, overawed the army and the people with the weapons he
  had brought with him, and took over the government. He captured all the high
  officers of the Kamud, and it is said he intends to proclaim himself Vil of
  Xancibar in a day or two. These officers, among whom are Kov Lutas and Lal
  Vak, together with the Dixtar and his daughter Neva, were sent to Castle
  Takkor, where they are now prisoners, guarded by the Ma Gongi warriors.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Miradon Vil, who had previously been captured by Sel Han&rsquo;s Ma
  Gongi scouts, was at first held in the secret camp where they were making the
  ray projectors. But as soon as the government had been over-thrown, Sel Han
  ordered him brought to Castle Takkor, where he could be guarded with the
  other important prisoners.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sur Det ordered me imprisoned in a room in one of the towers, to
  await the arrival of Sel Han, who would then decide what my fate should be.
  But, unfortunately for his plans, he had me put in a room in which there was
  a hidden panel which communicated with a secret passageway that led to the
  underground cellars, and thence out under the docks.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I lost no time in making use of this means of escape, but ran into
  one of Sel Han&rsquo;s officers. I caught him by the throat before he could
  make a sound, and hung on until he ceased to breathe. Then I donned his
  uniform and weapons, and boldly ascended to the dock. There, by virtue of the
  authority vested in my borrowed uniform, I demanded and received a gawr from
  one of the attendants, and flew away unmolested.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you think it would be possible for you and me to return to the
  castle, enter by way of the secret passage, and rescue Miradon Vil?&rdquo;
  Thorne asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I fear it would not, my lord,&rdquo; Yirl Du answered. &ldquo;His
  majesty is too well guarded. He is an even more important prisoner than
  Irintz Tel. Sel Han holds him as a hostage to prevent any uprising among the
  royalists, just as he holds the Dixtar to keep the loyal Kamudists from
  revolting.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How many ray projectors are left at the castle?&rdquo; Thorne
  asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There are none,&rdquo; Yirl Du told him. &ldquo;All four are in use
  in Dukor. Where Sel Han goes, there go the projectors, also. He will not
  leave them in the hands of his most trusted officers, for they are his very
  lifeblood. Without them he could be easily defeated by a handful of regular
  soldiers. And so far as I know, no others have been completed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, then, perhaps we can take the castle,&rdquo; mused Thorne.
  &ldquo;You told me once that the Free Swordsmen would revolt against the rule
  of any but a rad of the Takkor blood.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure they are loyal, my lord,&rdquo; Yirl Du said.
  &ldquo;You have but to command, and they will fight to the last man to
  recover your castle for you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good. I think it can be done without heavy losses. I have a
  plan.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>* * *</p>

  <p>That afternoon, shortly after Thorne had outlined his plan and given his
  instructions to Yirl Du, the latter flew away in the direction of Takkor
  City.</p>

  <p>Some time later, when the shadows had begun to lengthen, Thorne, who had
  been snatching forty winks on one of Thaine&rsquo;s divans, was awakened by
  her hand on his brow.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The time has come,&rdquo; she said.</p>

  <p>Thorne sat up, drank the cup of freshly brewed pulcho she proffered him,
  and sprang to the floor.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now if you will be so kind as to lend me Tezzu and a boat,&rdquo;
  he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be off.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why do you say lend,&rsquo; &rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;when I am
  going with you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are to remain here. There will be fighting - bloodshed. It is
  too dangerous.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She drew herself up proudly. &ldquo;I am a warrior, and as good a
  swordsman as the man you just sent to rally your followers. If you
  won&rsquo;t take me with you I shall go in a separate boat.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Seeing the impossibility of dissuading her from her resolve, Thorne set
  about making preparations for their journey. They then took Tezzu with them,
  leaving Neem, the other beast, to guard the house, and went down to the
  boat.</p>

  <p>Tezzu, with the tow-rope in his huge mouth, swiftly took them across the
  lake and into a narrow stream where the foliage arching overhead concealed
  them from the sight of flying enemies. After traversing a veritable network
  of these tiny streams and crossing a number of small lakes, they reached the
  shore of Takkor Lake just before sundown.</p>

  <p>At the command of his mistress, Tezzu dragged the boat up out of the
  water, upon which ice crystals were already beginning to form, and into a
  place of concealment, where he was left to guard it. Then the man and girl
  set off along the lake shore, following the same route that Thorne had
  followed upon his first disastrous visit to Castle Takkor, and carefully
  keeping out of sight among the trees.</p>

  <p>They had not traveled far before the sun set, so they were forced to pick
  their way through the undergrowth by the light of the nearer moon. Shortly
  thereafter, Yirl Du appeared in the path before them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Everything is arranged,&rdquo; he said softly. &ldquo;I have been
  waiting to lead you to the rendezvous.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They paused only long enough to draw up their boots and let down their
  head-cloaks for warmth. Then Yirl Du led them away through the glittering,
  frost-coated jungle. Presently they came to a large clearing where several
  hundred warriors, mounted on gawrs, were assembled, and more were arriving
  constantly from all points of the compass, singly and in small groups. There
  was also a group of fifty warriors who were unmounted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In a little while there will be five hundred mounted warriors here,
  my lord,&rdquo; said Yirl Du. &ldquo;My son, Rid Du, has assembled a thousand
  more afoot. They are scattered about in the city, seemingly only amusing
  themselves, but will rally to him at the signal, half to capture the gawrs on
  the wharf and the other half to rush the castle gate.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Shortly thereafter the last flying warrior arrived.</p>

  <p>After a brief final conference with Thorne, Yirl Du led his foot- soldiers
  away. They were picked men, for they were to follow Yirl Du through the
  secret passageway into the castle and then capture and throw open the gates,
  so the soldiers under Rid Du could rush in.</p>

  <p>Thorne was to lead the air attack which was calculated first to draw the
  attention of the defenders from Yirl Du&rsquo;s little party, and later to
  assist in crushing the Ma Gongi guards.</p>

  <p>After he had waited for the length of time agreed upon with Yirl Du,
  Thorne gave the signal to his men, and one by one the great bird-beasts left
  the ground. With the Earthman in the lead, they formed a long line which
  ascended for about two thousand feet, then straightened out to fly directly
  for the castle. Once above his objective, Thorne led the way downward in a
  swift, descending spiral which, as it neared the upper parapets, flattened
  into a great circle that followed the outline of the walls.</p>

  <p>An alarm had been sounded at the first approach of this flying host, and
  now, as they drew nearer, javelins flew up at them, hurled by the defenders
  on the walls. Assisted by the force of gravity, while their enemies were
  impeded by it, the flying warriors were able to reply to good purpose, and
  soon there were many dead and wounded Ma Gongi on the ramparts. But it seemed
  that as fast as they fell more rushed up to take their places.</p>

  <p>At the first alarm, five hundred of Rid Du&rsquo;s warriors had swarmed
  down over the docks where the gawrs were kept. As they were guarded only by a
  few soldiers and orderlies, the bird-beasts were soon captured. In the
  meantime, led by Rid Du, the other half of his little company assembled
  before the gate and began hurling javelins up at the defenders.</p>

  <p>Now was the time for Yirl Du to strike, and Thorne watched tensely.
  Presently he saw the little company emerge from one of the castle doors,
  quickly form a flying wedge with Yirl Du at the apex, and charge across the
  courtyard, cutting down or scattering the surprised Ma Gongi in their way.
  Just before the gate the two wings of the wedge divided, and each column
  ascended into one of the watch towers which guarded the gateway. A moment
  later the gates swung open, and in poured the Free Swordsmen from the town,
  with Rid Du at their head.</p>

  <p>Now Thorne&rsquo;s flying warriors swooped down into the melee, abandoning
  their javelins for fear of injuring their comrades, and fighting at close
  range with sword, mace and dagger. The slaughter was appalling. The Ma Gongi,
  most of whom had been slaves and were unaccustomed to warfare, were no match
  for the disciplined Takkor swordsmen.</p>

  <p>The ramparts and courtyard were thickly strewn with their bodies as
  Thorne, with Yirl Du, Thaine, and a small contingent of Takkor swordsmen, cut
  down the warriors who guarded the entrance, charged into the castle, and
  began their search for the prisoners.</p>

  <p>Yirl Du led the way to the great central tower, then fought their way up
  the winding staircase, the yellow defenders stubbornly contesting each step
  of the way.</p>

  <p>Thorne and Yirl Du were ever in the front as they climbed the stairs, and
  both were soon covered with wounds. When they reached the flight which led to
  the top story, they met with the most desperate resistance they had yet
  encountered. But the swiftly flashing blade of the Earthman backed up the
  swords of Yirl Du and Thaine, and the javelins of the warriors who came
  behind them soon cleared the stairs of living enemies, and the few who
  remained above to contest their way were quickly cut down.</p>

  <p>Thorne tried the door and found it barred on the inside. Reversing his
  bloody sword, he beat upon the panels with the pommel.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; came a cautious call from within.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Rad of Takkor,&rdquo; Thorne replied. &ldquo;Open
  quickly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At this, there was the sound of a sliding bolt, and the door swung open. A
  tall, broad-shouldered man whose shaggy hair and flowing beard gleamed golden
  yellow under the baridium lights stood in the doorway.</p>

  <p>At sight of him, Yirl Du and the other warriors instantly raised both
  hands before their eyes and muttered the royal salutation, while Thaine, with
  an exclamation of joy, ran forward and flung her arms around his neck.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad we found you
  safe.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Gently he took her face between his huge hands, and bending, kissed her
  forehead. &ldquo;Little daughter!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;This was
  man&rsquo;s work. You should not have come.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you not train me to do a man&rsquo;s work? And have I not done
  it well? Ask Sheb Takkor.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thorne, who had instantly sensed that this regal looking personage must be
  Miradon Vil, had only been a shade behind the others in rendering the royal
  salutation. He now stood, respectfully waiting for the Vil to speak.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is a question I need not propound,&rdquo; said Miradon. &ldquo;I
  know you have fought nobly, or you would not be here. But, come, Sheb Takkor
  Rad, and you, Yirl Du Jen. There are those in other apartments who will be
  glad to thank their gallant rescuers.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He led the way down the hall and tapped on a door. From within came a
  little squeaky voice, which Thorne immediately recognized as that of Irintz
  Tel. &ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Miradon Vil with friends who have rescued us. Open.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The bolt slid back, the door swung open, and the little rat-faced Dixtar
  stepped out, followed by Kov Lutas and Lal Vak.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Neva?&rdquo; squeaked Irintz Tel. &ldquo;Have you
  found my daughter?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She should be in one of these apartments,&rdquo; replied Miradon
  Vil.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Open the doors! Break them down!&rdquo; ordered the Dixtar, with a
  wave of his hand. &ldquo;Why do you all stand there, staring?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thorne regarded him coldly. &ldquo;You forget, Irintz Tel,&rdquo; he said,
  &ldquo;that this is my castle and these are my warriors. They take orders
  only from me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At this, the Dixtar turned deathly pale, but Thorne, ignoring him, warmly
  greeted the handsome young Kov Lutas and the white-haired Lal Vak, both of
  whom profusely thanked him for coming to their rescue.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, Miradon Vil had gone on to the next door and rapped.
  Thorne&rsquo;s heart gave a great bound as he heard the voice that answered -
  the voice of Neva.</p>

  <p>Irintz Tel rushed to the door and embraced his daughter as she stepped
  out, followed by two of her slave-girls. Kov Lutas and Lal Vak instantly
  crowded forward to greet her, and the latter ceremoniously introduced Miradon
  Vil.</p>

  <p>Thorne held aloof, watching them, his breast seething with conflicting
  emotions. Despite his resolve to put Neva forever from his thoughts, he now
  found that sight of her had suddenly reawakened all the old longing with
  redoubled intensity.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he realized that Neva had seen him - was coming toward him -
  holding out her arms to him. His heart throbbed wildly. Yet he resolutely
  steeled himself to break the subtle spell she had again cast over him -
  forcing his flagging will to recall her betrayal of him and the hideous death
  to which she had condemned him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sheb, beloved!&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;The time has been so
  long&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Dixtar&rsquo;s daughter,&rdquo; he said with frigid politeness,
  &ldquo;honors the lowly castle of the Rad of Takkor by her charming presence.
  The Takkor retainers will have instructions to do all in their power to make
  her stay a pleasant one.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>With this he saluted stiffly, and walked to where Yirl Du stood awaiting
  his orders. &ldquo;See that these, my honored guests, are given the best the
  castle affords.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, my lord.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>For a moment Neva stood bewildered. Then a sudden flush suffused her
  lovely face. Turning, she reentered her apartment, head held high and eyes
  flashing.</p>

  <p>Without even glancing at the door through which she had vanished, Thorne
  addressed Yirl Du. &ldquo;I understand that the chief officials of the Kamud,
  including the seven judges, are confined here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They are in the west wing, my lord.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have them brought here, Jen,&rdquo; cut in Irintz Tel imperiously.
  &ldquo;We would speak with them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They are to be kept in their quarters, and well guarded,&rdquo;
  continued Thorne. &ldquo;Also, you are to search for Sur Det, and if he still
  lives, bring him to me. I would question him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, my lord.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Earthman now turned to the little Dixtar. &ldquo;I trust it will not
  be necessary to again remind you that my warriors take orders only from
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Irintz Tel shot him a venomous glance. Then he swung on his heel and
  entered Neva&rsquo;s apartment.</p>

  <p>Thorne looked at Miradon Vil with an apologetic smile. &ldquo;I hope that
  your majesty will excuse me, as I have pressing duties. Preparations must be
  made at once, so we can all leave the castle before morning. Sel Han may
  return at any moment with his ray projectors, and if he finds us here our
  case will be desperate, if not entirely hopeless.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Vil returned his smile. &ldquo;I understand. Can I help?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, I thank your majesty.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thorne hurried down the corpse-littered stairs, and out into the
  courtyard. Here he set about making immediate preparations for flight,
  ordering that all available weapons and provisions be brought out and loaded
  onto the gawrs. He planned to leave the Vil and Thaine in their secret hiding
  place, and to find another for Irintz Tel and Neva. Then he would lead his
  warriors far out into the marsh and hide from Sel Han and his fearsome new
  weapons until he could devise some plan for successfully combating him.</p>

  <p>He was overseeing these preparations some time later, when Yirl Du came
  and asked to speak with him aside.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Sur Det cannot be found among
  either the dead or the living.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then he has escaped. We must hasten our preparations, for he has
  undoubtedly gone to Dukor, and will bring Sel Han and his ray projectors down
  upon us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But the words had scarcely left his mouth when a guard called from one of
  the towers: &ldquo;A vast host of warriors mounted on gawrs is approaching.
  Also there are a score of the great metal gawrs.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Instantly, confusion reigned in the castle. A frightened warrior leaped on
  the back of a half-loaded gawr and jerked the guiding rod. The bird- beast
  flapped awkwardly up out of the courtyard. But it had scarcely cleared the
  castle walls when a strange and terrible thing happened. A green ray shot out
  from somewhere beyond the wall - struck the fleeing warrior and his mount.
  For an instant they were visible, bathed in that weird, green light. Then
  they seemed to suddenly shrivel and disintegrate. Where they had been there
  was nothing at all. The ray winked out and consternation settled over the
  courtyard.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch20"
     name="ch20"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

  <p class="first">THORNE knew that Sel Han, with his powerful ray projectors,
  could not only cut off any attempt at flight, but could destroy the castle
  and all in it at his pleasure. Yet he resolved that he, his friends and his
  followers should not succumb without resisting to the utmost. He accordingly
  rallied his panic- stricken warriors to the defense of the walls, then
  mounted to the ramparts to survey the movements of the enemy.</p>

  <p>Sel Han, it seemed, was not disposed immediately to storm the castle. All
  of his flying machines had alighted well out of javelin range of the walls,
  and from the interiors of these, Ma Gongi foot-soldiers were pouring. A ray
  projector had been mounted on the flat roof of a nearby house, and Thorne
  stared at it curiously. It looked much like a large telescope on a conical
  stand. The flying warriors were circling the castle, but the great bulk of
  these were alighting on the ground. Soon only a few remained in the air as
  scouts and observers.</p>

  <p>Glancing out over the lake, the Earthman saw that a second projector was
  mounted there on a large boat. He walked around the walls and descried a
  third on the roof of a building to the landward side, and still farther, a
  fourth, mounted on the ground to command the remaining sector of the
  wall.</p>

  <p>Having completed his inspection of the disposal of the enemy troops and
  projectors, Thorne returned to a parapet beside the gate which opened on the
  dock, and before which Sel Han had massed his chief officers.</p>

  <p>As he stood there on the battlement, watching every movement of the enemy,
  he heard a group of people coming up behind him. Turning, he beheld Miradon
  Vil and Irintz Tel walking side by side. Though they had always been deadly
  enemies it was evident that they had united to make common cause against the
  man who not only threatened them, but all of Mars as well.</p>

  <p>Behind the two ex-rulers of Xancibar came Neva escorted by Lal Vak, and
  Thaine escorted by Kov Lutas. All carried weapons.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We sought you out, Sheb Takkor Rad, hoping that we might be of some
  assistance in the defense,&rdquo; said Miradon Vil.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I fear there is little we can do save surrender or die, your
  majesty, though I have resolved that I, personally, will fight to the death
  rather than surrender to Sel Han.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your resolve coincides with my own,&rdquo; replied Miradon Vil.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And mine! And mine!&rdquo; chorused the others, with the single
  exception of Irintz Tel.</p>

  <p>The ominous silence that followed was suddenly rent by the clarion notes
  of a trumpet. Hurrying to the wall, Thorne saw that a man had detached
  himself from the group around Sel Han, and walked to a point before the gate
  just out of range of a hurled javelin.</p>

  <p>Once again the herald sounded a ringing call on his trumpet. Then, resting
  his instrument on his hip, he cried: &ldquo;His Imperial Majesty, Sel Han the
  Invincible, Vil of Xancibar, Vil of Vils, and Vildus of all Mars, commands
  that Sheb Takkor and his warriors instantly lay down their weapons and come
  forth from the castle gates unarmed. His majesty has it in his power to
  utterly destroy the castle and every soul within it. Witness!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He paused dramatically, and as he paused a pencil of green light stabbed
  out from the projector on the housetop. It flashed to the top of one of the
  lesser towers, and where the ray touched, the crystal blocks and mortar
  shriveled and vanished, leaving a jagged hole in the battlement.</p>

  <p>The ray winked out, and the herald continued: &ldquo;There will be no
  terms of surrender, other than such conditions as the Vildus of Mars shall
  see fit to impose.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>With a farewell flourish of his trumpet, he turned and walked back to
  where Sel Han and his officers stood waiting.</p>

  <p>Thorne turned to an officer who stood near by. &ldquo;Get me a
  herald.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The officer ran to the gate tower and immediately emerged with a youth who
  carried a trumpet. Thorne gave him his instructions, and mounting the wall,
  he blew a ringing flourish. After waiting for a moment, he announced:
  &ldquo;The Lord of Takkor, his warriors and his friends, defy Sel Han of the
  empty titles, and his bandits, who have invaded the Takkor domain. Here is
  Castle Takkor, and here are its defenders unafraid, for Sel Han to come and
  take if he can, or to destroy if he has aught to gain by wanton destruction.
  The Lord of Takkor further states&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The speech of the herald was suddenly cut off, along with his life, by a
  green flash from the ray projector on the housetop.</p>

  <p>A roar of rage went up from the Takkor swordsmen. If Sel Han had thought
  to frighten them by this demonstration he had a poor conception of the
  caliber of these men.</p>

  <p>But though this had made the Takkor warriors more steadfast in their
  purpose, there was at least one occupant of the castle upon whom it had
  worked the opposite effect. Chancing to look toward Irintz Tel, Thorne
  noticed that he was trembling violently.</p>

  <p>Presently there came two more blasts from the trumpet of Sel Han&rsquo;s
  herald.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;His Imperial Majesty, the Vildus of Mars, could destroy the castle
  and all it contains,&rdquo; shouted the herald, &ldquo;yet he is just and
  merciful. He realizes that the warriors of the Takkor Rad and the prisoners
  are respectively under the command - and in the power of a man who is willing
  to sacrifice them all to satisfy his own empty vanity and make good his puny
  defiance of Sel Han, the Invincible.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Therefore, his imperial majesty gives you, each and every one, a
  respite from death, during which you may have time to depose this foolhardy
  leader and save your own lives. And to the man who will bring him the head of
  Sheb Takkor, the Vildus of Mars covenants to present the Raddek of Takkor
  with all its lands. His majesty decrees that your respite from death shall
  last from now until the planet has completed one turn upon its axis. If, by
  that time and at that very moment, you have not obeyed his edict, then will
  the castle and all in it be utterly destroyed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Having said his say, the herald returned to the group of officers.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Looks as if things have quieted down for the present, at
  least,&rdquo; said Thorne, turning to the others. &ldquo;I suggest that we
  all get some much needed sleep.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;One moment, Sheb Takkor,&rdquo; interposed Irintz Tel. &ldquo;I
  suggest that before we retire we hold a council and decide just what we are
  going to do. It is only fair that we should all have some say in the
  matter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I quite agree to that,&rdquo; Thorne replied. &ldquo;Thus far I
  have been acting under the belief that I was carrying out the wishes of the
  majority in defying Sel Han. If I have erred, there is yet time to rectify
  the mistake. Let us go into the castle.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They gathered, a few moments later, in the apartment which Thorne had
  chosen for himself. The Earthman had asked Yirl Du to attend as the
  representative of the Free Swordsmen. The others were Neva, Thaine, Miradon
  Vil, Irintz Tel, Lal Vak, and Kov Lutas.</p>

  <p>Thorne stood at a taboret in the center of the room, filling cups with
  steaming pulcho, a jar of which had just been brought in by Yirl Du. These he
  passed to his assembled guests. Then he said to Irintz Tel, &ldquo;Since it
  was at your suggestion that this council was assembled, I will call upon you
  first to address us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Dixtar took a dainty sip of pulcho, then carefully held the cup before
  him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My good friends and comrades in adversity,&rdquo; he began,
  &ldquo;I, for one, see the hopelessness of our position here, and the
  futility of further resistance to the decree of fate. After all, it is better
  to be live prisoners than dead heroes, blasted into nothingness by the awful
  weapons of the Ma Gongi. I suggest that we surrender to Sel Han while he is
  inclined to be merciful, thus not only saving our own lives, but those of the
  brave Takkor swordsmen who sought to rescue us from the conqueror.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have all heard the suggestion of the Dixtar,&rdquo; said
  Thorne. &ldquo;Will you surrender or resist?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Resist!&rdquo; they cried unanimously.</p>

  <p>Then the Dixtar, who for ten long Martian years had never been gainsaid in
  anything, went suddenly pale. &ldquo;I fear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you
  will all regret this rash decision when regret comes too late.&rdquo; Then he
  turned, clasped his hands behind his back, and with his chin sunk on his
  chest, strode out of the room. The others soon followed to go to their
  several apartments.</p>

  <p>The Earthman, left alone, prepared to retire. One thing kept recurring to
  him as he hooded the baridium globes and crept into bed. It was the fact that
  as Kov Lutas walked out between the two girls, he had seemed more attentive
  to Thaine than to Neva. Yirl Du had told Thorne that the young officer avowed
  undying love for the beautiful daughter of the Dixtar. Thorne was
  puzzled.</p>

  <p>He soon fell asleep, but it seemed to him that he had not slumbered for
  more than a few moments when he was awakened by a sharp tug at his coverlets.
  He looked up sleepily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yirl Du!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have made a startling discovery, my lord,&rdquo; Yirl Du replied,
  &ldquo;else I should not have disturbed your rest.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of that,&rdquo; said Thorne. &ldquo;What is
  it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>For answer, his henchman drew a scroll from beneath his cloak. After
  passing it to the Earthman, he walked to the lever and unhooded the baridium
  globes, flooding the room with light.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch21"
     name="ch21"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

  <p class="first">THORNE glanced curiously over the scroll given him by Yirl
  Du. Then he threw back the covers and leaped out of bed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where did you get this?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Where is Irintz
  Tel?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The traitor is in his own bed, and probably asleep by now,&rdquo;
  replied Yirl Du.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But what of Sel Han? Did Irintz Tel get a message through to him,
  and was there a reply?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He did, and I have the reply also.&rdquo; Yirl Du plucked a second
  scroll from beneath his cloak and handed it to Thorne, who perused it
  carefully, then re-read the other message. The correspondence went in this
  order, the first letter full hasty revisions:</p>

  <p>To Sel Han, Vildus of Mars,</p>

  <p>Salutation and submission:</p>

  <p>With my help you can take Castle Takkor and all in it, sustaining but
  trifling losses. Tomorrow night, in the period of darkness between the
  setting of the nearer moon and the rising of the farther, quietly mass a
  thousand men near the lake gate. Have another group of fifty warriors bring a
  long stout rope, knotted for easy climbing, beneath the point where I stand
  when I hurl this note. I will drop a cord to draw up and make fast the rope
  for them. Then we will cut down the guards and throw open the gates. With a
  thousand of your foot-soldiers in the courtyard and your mounted warriors
  attacking from above, there can be but one outcome. I seek to make no terms,
  but align myself wholeheartedly with your cause, and now await your reply and
  your commands.</p>

  <p>Irintz Tel</p>

  <p>To Irintz Tel, Salutation and greetings:</p>

  <p>Your plan pleases me. As soon as the sky grows dark, lower your cord with
  a muffled weight at the end. When you feel two tugs on the cord draw up the
  rope which we shall tie on the other end, and lash it to a merlon. As soon as
  it is secure, tug twice, and we will do the rest.</p>

  <p>If, through your efforts, we are able to capture the castle, I will make
  you Vil of Xancibar or any other vilet of equal size which you may choose,
  and Neva shall share with me the throne of all Mars.</p>

  <p>Sel Han</p>

  <p>Vildus of Mars.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah! So that&rsquo;s their game. They will capture the towers, throw
  open the gates, and. take us by surprise during the dark interval.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They will unless we prevent Irintz Tel from drawing up their rope
  for them. Shall I place him under arrest?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. Let him sleep. There is nothing he can do before tomorrow
  night, and I already have the glimmerings of a counter plan. In the meantime,
  tell me how you got these documents.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was quite simple, my lord. As you know, I am familiar with every
  secret passageway in this castle. When Irintz Tel left the conference I
  suspected him of some treachery, so I followed. Seeing him enter his
  apartment, I slipped into a hidden passageway which leads to a panel in the
  central room of his suite. There, through a small peep-hole, I spied upon
  him. He seemed quite agitated, and finally went to the writing board and
  composed this letter. He made a copy, probably because, as you see, the
  original is full of corrections and crossed-out words.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Next, he unraveled the silken lining of one of his garments and
  wound the long cord he obtained therefrom into a ball. He thrust the ball of
  cord and the copy of the corrected scroll under his cloak, and went out. On
  the way out he hurled this original letter into the fireplace. Luckily I was
  able to open the panel, run to the fireplace, and rescue it before it caught
  fire.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I read the note, and followed Irintz Tel. I saw him tie the
  cylinder to the end of his silken cord and hurl it out toward the enemy camp
  where it was picked up by a yellow warrior. Some time later Sel Han&rsquo;s
  reply came, and Irintz Tel drew it up on the wall.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;With a false beard and tattered cloak, I disguised myself as a
  castle menial. Again I spied upon Irintz Tel in his room. Presently I saw him
  place Sel Han&rsquo;s answer on the writing board, and resolved to attempt to
  get it without arousing his suspicion. Accordingly, I went into his room with
  a load of wood, managed to upset the writing board, shake the scroll out of
  the cylinder, thrust it into my belt, and hand him the empty cylinder, which
  he immediately tossed into the fire.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Obviously Irintz Tel thinks both of these documents were burned,
  and so imagines himself safe from discovery. That fits in splendidly with my
  plan.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But aren&rsquo;t you going to arrest him and punish him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. I have a more subtle scheme than that. Say nothing about these
  notes or the Dixtar&rsquo;s treachery to anyone. Leave all to me. Tomorrow,
  go about your duties as if nothing is amiss. And now get yourself some rest.
  I&rsquo;m going back to bed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>* * *</p>

  <p>Thorne was up with the sun, and instantly set about his task. First he put
  his men to work cleaning up the place and tending the gawrs. Then,
  accompanied by Yirl Du, he explored the underground chambers of the castle.
  It was not long before he had mapped out a route leading through the largest
  doorways and archways to a point near one of the concealed entrances of the
  secret passageway, through which Yirl Du had previously escaped, and which
  led underneath the docks. After investigating this passageway and the space
  beneath the docks, he returned to the castle cellar.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bring me six skilled masons,&rdquo; he told Yirl Du, &ldquo;and
  have them conceal their tools on the way so there will be no suspicion of
  what we are about to do. I&rsquo;ll wait here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Yirl Du hurried away, and presently returned with six members of the Free
  Swordsmen, carrying tools and mortar concealed in two large food hampers.</p>

  <p>Thorne addressed them. &ldquo;I want you to remove the blocks from the
  wall at this point, until you have made an opening large enough for a gawr to
  pass through. Then wait here with your tools for further orders, which will
  not come until tonight. Food and pulcho will be sent you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Accompanied by Yirl Du, he crossed the room and stepped through the large
  doorway, carefully closing the door after him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Keep this door closed with two guards before it,&rdquo; he said,
  &ldquo;and give them orders to admit nobody but you or me. You, yourself,
  will take food to the workmen at meal-times.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>After the two guards had been posted, Thorne and Yirl Du paid a visit to
  the tower where the officers of the Kamud were imprisoned. These, the
  Earthman ordered transferred to a dungeon in the cellar. When this had been
  accomplished he returned to the battlements to direct the work there, and to
  keep watch over the enemy.</p>

  <p>That afternoon, after Irintz Tel had retired to his apartment, Thorne
  issued secret instructions to his various officers. These, in turn,
  transmitted instructions to the men in their charge.</p>

  <p>Miradon Vil, Kov Lutas, Lal Vak and the two girls were told nothing.
  Thorne did not want the Dixtar&rsquo;s daughter to know of the perfidy of her
  father until his own plans had been carried out.</p>

  <p>Night came at last, with the transient brightness of the nearer moon. It
  was at the setting of this orb that all of Thorne&rsquo;s forces were to go
  into action. In the meantime, a secret watch was kept on Irintz Tel.</p>

  <p>Presently Thorne, standing in the shadow, saw the Dixtar cross the
  courtyard, walking unconcernedly and saluting the officers and men he
  encountered. Leisurely he mounted to the wall and a moment later disappeared
  in the shadow of the tower.</p>

  <p>Thorne softly called to Rid Du, who stood waiting. &ldquo;Start out with
  the gawrs, and warn the men to be careful about making any unusual
  noise.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Led by a man who had been coached for the purpose until he thoroughly knew
  the route through the castle and cellar which had been mapped out by Thorne,
  the great bird-beasts, each carrying a rider, began forming in line and
  marching into the castle.</p>

  <p>* * *</p>

  <p>By the time the moon had set nearly two-thirds of the gawrs had entered
  the castle. At this moment all the warriors on the walls and in the towers
  began silently stealing from their posts, with the exception of the few who
  guarded the towers that controlled the lake gates. These had instructions to
  remain until the first attackers appeared, then flee down the inner stairways
  which led to the cellars, and join the others.</p>

  <p>Thorne kept his post at the doorway until the last huge bird-beast had
  lumbered through. Then he closed and bolted the door on the inside, and ran
  up the steps of the central tower where, one by one, he aroused Neva, Thaine,
  Miradon Vil, Lal Vak and Kov Lutas.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come with me quickly, and make no sound,&rdquo; he told them.
  &ldquo;The enemy is about to attack, and I have a plan to frustrate them. But
  we must be quiet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They followed him down the stairway unquestioningly, Neva escorted by
  Miradon Vil, who seemed strangely solicitous of her safety; Thaine, attended
  by Kov Lutas, and Lal Vak walked with the Earthman. Thorne closed and bolted
  every door after them as they followed the route where the gawrs had walked
  through the castle and descended to the basement. Here, after passing through
  several rooms, and bolting each door behind them, they caught up with the end
  of a line of warriors, among whom Thorne recognized the guards from the gate
  towers. This line was swiftly and silently filing through the hole opened in
  the wall by the masons, who, since all the gawrs had passed, had begun to
  fill it up under the direction of Yirl Du.</p>

  <p>Thorne bolted the last door and told his companions to follow the warriors
  through the opening. Then he approached Yirl Du. &ldquo;Have you shown these
  men the secret passageway?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, my lord. And I have instructed them to completely wall up the
  hole as soon as the last warrior has passed through, then follow by way of
  the passage.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good. Come with me, for we still have the most difficult part of
  our task to perform.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They hurried out to where the men and bird-beasts stood under the dock,
  amid the supporting pilings, and now heard the flapping of many wings above
  and around them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sel Han&rsquo;s flying warriors are attacking the castle. Now is
  our chance, but we must work swiftly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In accordance with his previous orders, a hundred of Thorne&rsquo;s
  warriors had divided themselves into four groups of twenty-five men, each
  under the command of an officer. The members of one of these groups, all
  young fellows under the command of Rid Du, had stripped themselves to their
  loincloths and were plastering each other from head to foot with a thick
  coating of heavy grease, working in the dim light of a small baridium torch
  held by another warrior. Stacked near them was a pile of large crocks made
  from transparent material.</p>

  <p>As soon as they were thoroughly greased, each man sword, mace and dagger
  about him, then took up a crock, inverted it, and lifted it over his head, so
  it rested upon his shoulders. They marched down to the water&rsquo;s edge,
  and Rid Du. who was in the lead, chopped a hole in the thin ice with his
  mace, then stepped into it and disappeared from view, still holding the crock
  over his head. His companions followed him, one by one, until all had dropped
  out of sight.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you think they&rsquo;ll make it?&rdquo; Thorne asked anxiously.
  &ldquo;Looks as if they might run out of air before they reach the
  boat.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, my lord,&rdquo; Yirl Du replied. &ldquo;All are
  trained divers. Every one of them could walk out to the boat and back again
  without danger of suffocating. And when they break through the ice around
  that boat the crew of the ray projector will have short shrift, with the
  exception of the operator whom you ordered kept alive.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hope you are right,&rdquo; said Thorne, &ldquo;and you should
  know if any one does. Now, it is time for us to attack the other projector
  crews. I&rsquo;ll take the one on the west, you the one on the north, and Ven
  Hitus the one to the east. Come!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He leaped into the saddle of a gawr held ready for him, and swiftly led
  the way to the west end of the dock, the great bird-beasts of his twenty-
  five warriors lumbering after him on the frozen ground. At the end of the
  dock a large ramp led up under a warehouse, open toward the lake after the
  manner of a lean-to. He rode out through the front of this and reconnoitered
  for a moment. By now there was a tremendous commotion in the castle. Baridium
  torches were flashing all about, and by their light he could see the warriors
  milling on the walls, while others mounted on gawrs circled the towers and
  battlements.</p>

  <p>But what chiefly concerned him now was the ray projector which he was to
  capture, and which Sel Han had mounted on a house-top. He marked its position
  by the faint glow of the light on its instrument board. Then, with a
  whispered &ldquo;Now!&rdquo; to his fighting men, who had assembled around
  him, he pulled up on the guiding rod, and his bird-beast launched itself into
  the air.</p>

  <p>In a few moments they were soaring above their objective, which was only
  about five hundred yards from the dock. Then they dived downward in a steep
  spiral.</p>

  <p>The crew of the ray projector had paid no attention to the sound of gawrs
  flapping above their heads, evidently taking these to be the mounts of their
  own warriors. And so, when the great bird-beasts alighted on the roof around
  them, and Thorne&rsquo;s fighting men sprang upon them with drawn swords,
  they were taken completely by surprise.</p>

  <p>Thorne made straight for the operator, who leaped up to meet him; the
  Earthman&rsquo;s blade quickly sent his weapon spinning, and he clapped his
  hands over his eyes in token of surrender. The Takkor swordsmen made short
  work of the others.</p>

  <p>Setting two men to guard his prisoner, Thorne raised his baridium torch
  above his head and unhooded it three times in succession. A moment later he
  saw it answered by three flashes from the projector on the north, and knew
  that Yirl Du had succeeded in capturing it. Then came a signal from the one
  on the east, announcing the success of Ven Hitus, and shortly thereafter
  another from the projector on the boat, now under the control of Rid Du.
  Thorne called a warrior to his side.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fly back to the dock,&rdquo; he ordered, &ldquo;and tell them they
  all come out now. Send fifty men to capture the airships, but let them go on
  foot. I want no one in the air except the man who is to carry dry clothing to
  Rid Du and his warriors on the boat. And let him return as soon as
  possible.&rdquo; Thorne turned his attention to the instrument board of the
  ray projector. Though it held a half dozen dials with numbers and pointers on
  them, evidently to tell the operator how much of this or that charge or
  substance the mechanism contained, he was at present concerned only with the
  parts intended for manipulation by the operator.</p>

  <p>These consisted of two small cranks and a lever. One crank, soon found by
  testing it, elevated or lowered the muzzle of the projector, and the other
  turned it to the right or left. He pointed the muzzle upward where it could
  do no damage, and pulled the lever. A green flash shot skyward. He swiftly
  shut it off, and having mastered the weapon without the operator&rsquo;s
  assistance, ordered him bound.</p>

  <p>A moment later the farther moon rose, flooding the scene with its pale
  light. After making sure that his men were in charge of Sel Han&rsquo;s
  airships, and that his warrior had returned from the boat, Thorne turned his
  attention to the castle.</p>

  <p>Evidently Sel Han was still unaware that his projectors had been captured.
  Fully a thousand of his riders still circled above the walls on their
  bird-beasts. Thorne aimed the projector into the thick of these and pulled
  the lever. Instantly the green ray flashed out, cutting a great gap in the
  circle of flyers. And now from the north, south and east, the other
  projectors went into action.</p>

  <p>The panic stricken riders who remained quickly dived for the nearest
  shelter - the castle courtyard. The Earthman instantly shut off his ray, and
  the others followed his example.</p>

  <p>Calling two of his warriors before the instrument board, he instructed
  them in the use of the projector. He told them that if any of Sel Han&rsquo;s
  men should attempt to fly up from the courtyard they should be instantly
  annihilated. And finally he ordered them to watch for him to raise his hand,
  at which signal they were to blast a hole through the base of the castle wall
  directly in front of them, then shut off the ray.</p>

  <p>These instructions completed, he mounted his gawr, and flinging the bound
  Ma Gongi operator across the front of his saddle, flew to the dock where the
  main body of his swordsmen waited.</p>

  <p>Dismounting, he turned his prisoner over to two guards and called an
  officer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Get me a herald,&rdquo; he commanded.</p>

  <p>The officer hurried away, and reappeared in a few moments with a youth who
  carried a trumpet. Thorne gave him his instructions and he walked toward the
  gate.</p>

  <p>As the Earthman stood looking after him he felt a touch on his arm.
  Turning, he beheld Neva, who had just come up behind him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I cannot find my father,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve looked
  for him everywhere. Do you know where he is?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am sorry to say,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;that the Dixtar saw
  fit to open the castle gates to the enemy. I haven&rsquo;t the slightest idea
  where he is - probably with his good friend, Sel Han.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She appeared distinctly shocked. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean - you
  don&rsquo;t mean&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That he could have betrayed us? Why not? It seems to run in the
  family.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She went pale at this, then looked up at him with flashing eyes.
  &ldquo;Sheb Takkor Rad,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;some day you will regret
  those words. There are certain things of which you are ignorant, which I
  hoped you would eventually come to understand. But now - now I don&rsquo;t
  care. I hate you! I never want to see you again!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>As she flung away from him the notes of the herald&rsquo;s trumpet sounded
  before the gate.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Rad of Takkor,&rdquo; cried the herald, &ldquo;calls upon Sel
  Han and his bandits to lay down their arms and march out of the castle. If
  they fail to comply they will be destroyed utterly, and the castle with them.
  As a token of surrender they will immediately throw open the gates.&rdquo;
  Thorne waited for some time, watching the gates expectantly. They remained
  closed. He called to the herald. &ldquo;Continue.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Again the herald sounded his trumpet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Rad of Takkor is inclined to be merciful,&rdquo; he cried,
  &ldquo;yet you try him sorely. Behold!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thorne raised his hand. A green ray flashed out from the house-top,
  drilled through the base of the wall, then winked off, leaving a gaping black
  hole. From within the castle there came the sounds of a mighty tumult -
  shouts, groans, curses, and the clash of weapons. Suddenly the gates swung
  open, and there emerged a rabble of yellow warriors, weaponless, thrusting
  before them two white men whose arms were bound behind them, and carrying on
  their shoulders the bodies of a dozen more. It was obvious that the Ma Gongi,
  facing destruction by their own dread weapons, had mutinied to save their
  lives.</p>

  <p>Leaving his gawr in charge of a warrior, Thorne hurried forward. As he
  drew near the prisoners he recognized the tall, broad-shouldered figure of
  Sel Han, and the wizened, rat-faced Dixtar. The first corpse, borne by four
  yellow warriors, was that of Sur Det.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Surround the Ma Gongi,&rdquo; Thorne shouted to his swordsmen.
  &ldquo;Be on the lookout for treachery. And bring me the two white
  prisoners.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Under the watchful eyes of the Takkor fighting men, the horde of yellow
  warriors continued to pour from the castle until it was emptied of enemies.
  Then, at a command from the Earthman, the swordsmen closed in behind them and
  a small detachment entered the castle to look for stragglers.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bring the prisoners and follow me,&rdquo; Thorne ordered.</p>

  <p>He led the way to where Miradon Vil stood with Neva, Thaine, Lal Vak and
  Kov Lutas.</p>

  <p>Rendering the imperial salute to the Vil, he said, &ldquo;Your majesty, I
  bring you two men who have usurped the throne of your empire, one for a
  generation, the other for a day. They are your prisoners, to do with as you
  will. And since the weapons with which Sel Han set out to conquer Mars are in
  the custody of my swordsmen, you are once more Vil of Xancibar. As for the
  nest of this would-be world conqueror and his fellow conspirators, which is
  said to be somewhere on my estate, every prisoner here knows where it is, and
  I am sure that at least one of them can be persuaded to tell.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sheb Takkor Rad,&rdquo; replied Miradon Vil, his voice shaking with
  emotion, &ldquo;I find it difficult to express&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He got no further, for at this moment there came a sudden and unexpected
  interruption. Thorne&rsquo;s first intimation of it as the sound of a sword
  being whipped from its sheath. He turned in time to see Sel Han, who had
  managed to slip off bonds and snatch the sword of the man who guarded him,
  leap across the space which separated him from the two girls, catch up
  Thaine, fling her over his shoulder, and dash way.</p>

  <p>Drawing his own blade the Earthman was the first to spring after the
  fugitive. Only a short way off stood Thorne&rsquo;s gawr, held by a warrior.
  Sel Han split his head with a blow of the sword and leaped into the
  saddle.</p>

  <p>Still clutching the struggling, kicking Thaine, and holding both her
  wrists with his left hand, he pulled up on the guiding rod with his right.
  The great bird-beast lumbered forward and took off, flapping noisily because
  of the double burden it carried, while Thorne and his companions looked on
  helplessly, not daring to use their javelins for fear of injuring the
  girl.</p>

  <p>The gawr, obedient to the guiding rod, flew swiftly out over the lake.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch22"
     name="ch22"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

  <p class="first">BEFORE the sound of Sel Han&rsquo;s derisive laughter died
  out, Thorne turned and sprinted for the nearest gawr.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Send five hundred swordsmen after me,&rdquo; he ordered as he
  sprang into the saddle. &ldquo;This may lead to an ambush.&rdquo; Then he
  lifted the guiding rod and was off.</p>

  <p>As his bird-beast rose in the air, Thorne saw that Sel Han was already
  halfway across the lake, and circling toward the northeast, a direction that
  would carry him over the heart of the marsh and into a terrain altogether
  strange to the Earthman. A glance behind him showed a horde of his riders
  coming across the lake. Fearing they might not have marked his course, he
  raised his baridium torch over his head and flashed it thrice. His signal was
  answered, almost immediately by three flashes from a rider in the front
  ranks.</p>

  <p>He did not doubt that Sel Han was making for his secret lair, which was
  believed to be somewhere in Takkor Marsh. But league after league of
  marshland unrolled beneath them, with the fugitive showing no signs of
  halting. And gradually, Thorne&rsquo;s swift bird-beast gained on the other.
  The nearer moon rose, its bright rays accentuating the details of the
  scene.</p>

  <p>Presently, when it seemed that the two moons were about to meet, Thorne
  noticed a change in the topography of the country ahead. They were nearing a
  broad, flat-topped mountain with a sloping base of sand and boulders that led
  to rugged, frowning cliffs.</p>

  <p>Sel Han&rsquo;s destination was obviously those frowning cliffs, but as he
  approached them Thorne noticed that his bird-beast had reached the limit of
  its endurance. With its beak almost over the rim, it fell, fluttering weakly
  and pecking ineffectually at the sheer cliff face with its hooked bill in an
  effort to save itself. Fortunately there was a shelf of rock only fifty feet
  below, and on this the creature alighted.</p>

  <p>Thorne arrived on that shelf not five seconds later, but Sel Han had
  already sprung from his saddle, and with Thaine still slung helplessly over
  his shoulder, was sprinting away along that narrow ledge. Whipping out his
  sword, the Earthman leaped down and set out in hot pursuit.</p>

  <p>Abruptly the ledge curved around a sharp bend in the cliff wall, and for a
  moment Thorne lost sight of his quarry. Then, as he rounded the bend, he saw
  them again. They were now in an indentation of the cliff face about an eighth
  of a mile deep, and the cliff opposite him was honeycombed with baridium-
  lighted caverns and terraced with ledges that swarmed with Ma Gongi workmen.
  On the top of the cliff above them a troop of mounted yellow warriors sat on
  guard. This, then, was the hidden nest of the conspirators.</p>

  <p>Though not more than five hundred feet separated Sel Han and his
  followers, he was unable to reach them, for the ledge ended suddenly only a
  short distance farther on. But if he could not cross to his men, he could
  call them to him, and this he did.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ho, warriors! Your Vildus is beset! To me!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Instantly there came a chorus of answering cries, and the flapping of
  their mounts&rsquo; wings as they took off. Almost at the same moment the
  vanguard of the Takkor swordsmen rounded the bend in the wall.</p>

  <p>Though he had noted all these happenings, Thorne had not slackened his
  pace; he turned and called to his men.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Capture those caves,&rdquo; he shouted, pointing across the inlet
  with his sword, &ldquo;and everything in them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Again he turned and dashed forward, then suddenly cried out in
  consternation. Sel Han and his precious burden had disappeared.</p>

  <p>The Takkor swordsmen and the Ma Gongi warriors now clashed in midair, but
  Thorne ran on breathlessly until he reached the very end of the ledge. Then
  he saw the explanation - a circular doorway hewn in the solid rock at his
  left.</p>

  <p>Fearing an ambush, Thorne stepped warily through that opening. He found
  himself in an immense cavern, lighted and ventilated by a hole in the roof
  through which the bright moonlight was streaming. Immediately beneath this
  hole a narrow wooden bridge crossed a wide chasm which split the floor of the
  cave from side to side. At the opposite end of the bridge was Sel Han. He had
  flung Thaine to the floor, and was hacking desperately with his sword at the
  two slender poles which supported the farther end of the bridge.</p>

  <p>Thorne sprang forward, but the wood splintered and the bridge sagged, then
  fell into the chasm.</p>

  <p>Thorne paused on the brink of the chasm. It was fully fifty feet across,
  and about two hundred feet deep, reaching clear to the smooth walls on both
  sides.</p>

  <p>The Earthman glared at his enemy, who laughed mockingly. Behind him, on a
  pedestal at the rear of the cave, was a stone colossus with a sardonic grin
  on its repulsive features, evidently the forgotten god of some vanished race.
  It almost seemed as if the god had laughed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now if you had a pair of wings&hellip;&rdquo; bantered Sel Han,
  grinning maliciously.</p>

  <p>Thorne had no intention of replying, but at this moment he noticed
  something which made him change his mind. Thaine, lying on the floor behind
  his enemy, sat up and opened her eyes, looking about her in bewilderment. She
  still wore her weapons.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sel Han, the mighty swordsman,&rdquo; he mocked. &ldquo;The
  irresistible Vildus of Mars. I am alone, yet you run away. It must be that
  you fear me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am too great a man to engage in a common brawl,&rdquo; Sel Han
  replied. &ldquo;As soon as my warriors have defeated yours, they will come
  and cut you into small pieces. Then&hellip;&rdquo; He paused suddenly, having
  detected a sound behind him. Thaine had sprung to her feet and drawn her
  sword.</p>

  <p>Sel Han still clutched his own weapon. &ldquo;Put down that sword, you
  little fool!&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;Do you think you can beat
  me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>For answer, she extended her blade in a swift lunge that would have
  stretched an ordinary swordsman on the stone floor. But her abductor was no
  ordinary swordsman. He parried with a quick riposte.</p>

  <p>Thorne realized that Sel Han was thoroughly angry and in deadly earnest.
  The thrust he had aimed at Thaine's heart was meant to kill!</p>

  <p>Suddenly, above the clashing of the blades and panting of the contestants,
  Thorne heard the sound of footsteps and the clank of weapons behind. Turning,
  he saw Yirl Du and a dozen Takkor swordsmen.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The traitors&rsquo; nest is captured, my lord,&rdquo; announced
  Yirl Du. Then he saw what was taking place at the other end of the
  cavern&hellip; &ldquo;Why - why!&rdquo; he stammered.</p>

  <p>But on the instant, Thorne had conceived a plan. &ldquo;Follow me!&rdquo;
  he cried. &ldquo;We can do no good here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He ran out of the cave, Yirl Du and the warriors at his heels. Their gawrs
  were perched on the ledge.</p>

  <p>The Earthman leaped into a saddle and pulled up the guiding rod.
  &ldquo;Come with me, and bring ten men,&rdquo; he told Yirl Du.</p>

  <p>Thorne guided the bird-beast up over the rim of the cliff and came down
  beside the hole in the roof of the cavern. Unhooking the two safety chains
  from the saddle, he fastened them together. Yirl Du and his ten men alighted
  around him a moment later.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bring me all your safety chains,&rdquo; Thorne ordered.</p>

  <p>They brought them, and he swiftly fastened them together, end to end,
  until he had a chain nearly a hundred feet in length. He hooked one end of
  this in his belt ring.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now let me down that hole and swing me toward the ledge on which
  they are fighting.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They seized the chain and let him down swiftly. He was directly above the
  appalling depth of the chasm.</p>

  <p>Leaning down over the rim of the hole, Yirl Du set the chain in motion - a
  pendulum with a slender linked shaft and a human weight.</p>

  <p>Nearer and nearer Thorne swung toward his objective, and Sel Han, who had
  heard the rattle of the chain, broke away from Thaine for a moment, to try to
  impale the Earthman as he spun helplessly at the end. But Thaine, seeing
  Thorne&rsquo;s danger, instantly went to his rescue, attacking her abductor
  so furiously that he was forced to devote all his attention to her.</p>

  <p>At last Thorne&rsquo;s feet touched the ledge. The chain slackened, and he
  reached around to unhook it from his belt ring. This done, he looked up just
  in time to see a sight that drove him berserk with rage and grief. Two feet
  of Sel Han&rsquo;s steel were projecting from Thaine&rsquo;s back. With an
  agonized gasp, Thaine crumpled to the floor.</p>

  <p>Thorne sprang furiously to the attack, but rage and grief are poor allies
  in a contest with swords. The Earthman, fighting his opponent, and little
  caring what happened to himself, constantly risked desperate lunges which
  left him dangerously exposed to counter thrusts.</p>

  <p>Only when he was bleeding from no less than a score of wounds and felt
  himself growing weaker did his common sense reassert itself. Resolutely,
  purposefully, Thorne now began to fence.</p>

  <p>Sel Han instantly noticed the change in his antagonist&rsquo;s
  swordsmanship, and a look of fear came over his flat features. Yet he fought
  savagely.</p>

  <p>Thorne was fencing coolly now, thrusting and parrying with ease and
  precision. So lightly did he hold the skill of his opponent that on hearing
  the clank of weapons he took time to glance across the chasm to see who had
  entered the cave. With a start of surprise he recognized Neva, Miradon Vil,
  Kov Lutas and Lal Vak. Miradon Vil, he saw, was reaching out for the end of
  the chain which Yirl Du was swinging toward him. But it was Neva, beside the
  Vil, who grasped the chain and swung across the chasm.</p>

  <p>Thorne was so surprised that he was not quite quick enough in parrying a
  cut for his head. Sel Han&rsquo;s blade parted his head-strap and bit through
  into his skull.</p>

  <p>He saw a myriad dancing stars, then the blood spurted down into his eyes,
  half blinding him.</p>

  <p>But for all that, he sprang to the attack, forcing his opponent back,
  back, until he stood on the very edge of the chasm. Again Sel Han tried that
  headcut which had worked so well before, but this time Thorne saw it coming.
  He parried, then countered with a sweeping moulinet to the neck - a drawing
  cut that sheared off the still-grinning head. It fell at his feet, and the
  body toppled backward into the chasm.</p>

  <p>Staggering drunkenly, Thorne kicked the leering head after the body. Then
  he lurched forward&hellip;</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch23"
     name="ch23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

  <p class="first">THORNE opened his eyes slowly, blinked, then opened them
  again and stared in astonishment. He was looking up at a frescoed ceiling on
  which was depicted a Martian battle scene - a beleaguered city fighting off
  the attack of a vast army. Four golden chains depended from the ceiling,
  supporting the divan on which he lay beneath silken covers of peacock blue
  embroidered with a design in gold. Swiftly he glanced around, and saw that he
  was in a luxuriously furnished chamber, lighted by three large circular
  windows through which the bright sunlight streamed, their crystal segments
  opened like flower petals to admit the crisp morning air.</p>

  <p>Seated in a swinging chair nearby, a man with white hair was poring over
  the contents of a large scroll. &ldquo;Lal Vak!&rdquo; Thorne exclaimed.</p>

  <p>The old scientist turned and smiled. &ldquo;Ah, you know me at
  last,&rdquo; he said. He put down his scroll and walked over to the
  divan.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; Thorne asked him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, in the palace, of course.&rdquo; He pointed to the silken
  cover and the embroidered design. &ldquo;These are the colors, and this the
  design of the royal family of Xancibar.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t understand. The last I remember, I was in that
  cave.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Precisely. Neva pulled you back from the brink of the chasm. You
  had lost a deal of blood and fainted in her arms. Yirl Du left guards at the
  captured nest of the conspirators. Then we picked up five hundred more of
  your Takkor swordsmen at the castle and flew here. They easily cleared the
  palace of Sel Han&rsquo;s followers, and Miradon Vil was received and
  acclaimed by the people with great rejoicing. They were heartily sick of the
  atrocities of Irintz Tel and the Kamud. But all that took place six days ago.
  You have been delirious since. Yesterday the royal physician removed the
  rjembal from your wounds and pronounced them healed. And last night you fell
  into a deep, healthful sleep which he believed would restore you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thorne raised his hand, and felt the scar on his head reflectively. Again
  he saw the horror of the struggle in the cave&hellip; &ldquo;Poor
  Thaine,&rdquo; he murmured.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But Thaine is better,&rdquo; said Lal Vak. &ldquo;The physician
  says she can be up and around in a day or two.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What! I thought her dead.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The wound was highly painful, but not dangerous.&rdquo; Thorne
  threw back the covers and swung his legs over the edge of the bed. His head
  reeled dizzily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To Thaine,&rdquo; Thorne replied.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t get up yet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thorne stood erect, swaying uncertainly. His legs were very weak and he
  felt light-headed. A jar of pulcho and several cups stood on a near-by stand.
  Lal Vak filled a cup and handed it to him. He drank it off at a gulp and
  called for another. Then he staggered to the bath box, declining the
  assistance of his white-haired friend. Stepping out of his sleeping garment,
  he entered, closed the door, and trod on the plate. A few moments later he
  emerged, dripping and brushing the water from his eyes. When he opened them
  he saw a familiar figure standing before him with two great wisps of dry
  moss.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Vorz!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The same, my lord,&rdquo; replied the little orderly, and proceeded
  to give him a brisk rub-down. &ldquo;His majesty granted me leave to serve
  you, and I trust you will not send me away.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; Thorne replied. &ldquo;If his majesty permits,
  I&rsquo;ll take you back to Takkor with me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank you, my lord.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vorz had laid out his clothing and weapons for him, and these he now
  proceeded to don. There was a magnificent cloak of orange trimmed with black,
  the colors of nobility. Then there was the Takkor medallion to hang about his
  neck. And a jeweled sword and dagger with Takkor serpent hilts.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do I look all right to go calling on a lady, Vorz?&rdquo; he
  asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Magnificent, my lord,&rdquo; was the reply. And Thorne thought of
  the last time Vorz had groomed him, the night of Irintz Tel&rsquo;s
  reception, when he and Neva had plighted their troth and she, when they were
  discovered, had condemned him to the baridium mines. But now there was
  another picture to add which puzzled and somehow comforted him. It was the
  memory of Neva swinging across the chasm at the risk of her own life and
  drawing him back from the brink just in time to save him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said, taking the arm of his old friend. &ldquo;Let
  us find the apartment of Thaine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They strode through the hallways in silence for a time. Then Thorne
  thought of Irintz Tel. &ldquo;What has become of the Dixtar?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you,&rdquo; replied Lal Vak.</p>

  <p>Presently they came to a door; the scientist drew a large key from his
  belt, unlocked the door, and threw it open. &ldquo;Enter,&rdquo; he
  invited.</p>

  <p>Thorne stepped inside and recognized the Hall of Heads. There were the
  shelves, reaching to the ceiling, with their thousands of grisly relics. Then
  he saw that a pedestal had been set up in the center of the hall. On the
  pedestal was a jar; a pair of small, beady eyes, glazed with the film of
  death, looked out at him sightlessly from a wizened, ratlike face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Irintz Tel!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Well I can&rsquo;t say that
  I blame Miradon Vil.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You wrong his majesty,&rdquo; said Lal Vak. &ldquo;The Vil had
  nothing to do with this. In fact he had granted the Dixtar full pardon, and
  bestowed on him a magnificent estate on the Zeelan Canal. But the next day
  Irintz Tel disappeared. An anonymous note was received that night suggesting
  that we look here. And we found this. We think it was the work of relatives
  of some of his victims. But no search is being conducted. The thing is done,
  and cannot be remedied. After all, they were certainly justified.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They quitted that place of horrors and came to the apartment of Thaine. A
  guard saluted and admitted them; a slave girl bade them be seated while she
  went in to announce them to her mistress.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait here for you,&rdquo; said Lal Vak, &ldquo;since I
  have already paid my respects to the young lady this morning.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thorne went in alone. On a luxurious divan beneath fluffy blue silk
  coverlets lay Thaine.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hahr Ree Thorne!&rdquo; she cried a trifle faintly, and held up
  both arms to him. He bent, and the arms went around his neck - drew his face
  to hers. Their lips met.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You should not be up,&rdquo; she said reprovingly, &ldquo;for you
  were worse injured than I.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My scratches have healed,&rdquo; he laughed, &ldquo;and now
  I&rsquo;m ready to leave - to go back to Takkor. I don&rsquo;t care for
  cities - or palaces.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; she told him. &ldquo;This is such a big lonesome
  place. Already I am homesick for the marsh - for the hunting and fishing, and
  the blazing log fires in the evenings.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It suddenly occurred to Thorne that, since he had put Neva forever from
  his mind, life would be far more worth the living with Thaine by his
  side.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thaine,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do you remember that day in your
  father&rsquo;s cabin when you tried a certain experiment?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She smiled up at him. &ldquo;How could I forget?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you said you must have time to think.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Since then I have thought - much. I was so inexperienced - I
  thought love was a thing which might be cultivated, little knowing that it is
  a flower which springs up spontaneously in the heart.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thaine! You can&rsquo;t mean that at last&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Hahr Ree Thorne. At last I have found true love. It came to me
  so unexpectedly, when I met Kov Lutas, that it left me weak and
  breathless.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Kov Lutas!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, yes. We are to be wed as soon as I am well. Hadn&rsquo;t you
  heard?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thorne achieved a smile, but in his heart there was a feeling of emptiness
  - of desolation. He forced his lips to say the conventional things, to wish
  her joy and to proclaim Kov Lutas the luckiest man on Mars. But to himself he
  thought: First Sylvia, then Neva, and now Thaine! It is my destiny to be
  alone and loveless.</p>

  <p>Rising, he said: &ldquo;I must go now and prepare for my journey.
  Farewell, and Deza grant you much happiness.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Once outside her door, however, he could dissemble no longer. Lal Vak
  remarked his woebegone expression.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why so sad?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I trust you found the lady
  well.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perfectly,&rdquo; Thorne replied. Then added: &ldquo;Old friend,
  I&rsquo;m a fool ever to have anything to do with women. From now on,
  I&rsquo;m through, and I mean it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; asked the scientist. &ldquo;Do you
  fall in love with every woman you meet?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, not exactly that. But since Neva betrayed
  me&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Betrayed you! What talk is this? Why she has twice saved your life!
  What are you talking about, boy?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You should know as well as I,&rdquo; Thorne said bitterly.
  &ldquo;Was it not she who sent me to the baridium mines?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lal Vak looked at him quizzically for the moment. &ldquo;You are a greater
  fool than I thought, my boy. She sent you to the baridium mines to save you
  from the headsman. And who do you think it was who aided you to escape from
  the mines? There were only three people in Xancibar with the power to do so.
  The other two were Irintz Tel and Sel Han. Do you think they did
  it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why I thought it was you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I had a small part,&rdquo; Lal Vak admitted, &ldquo;but it was she
  who engineered everything - who pulled the strings and moved the officials in
  high places, so the thing could be accomplished. You should have seen her,
  tearful and apprehensive that next day, as she connived with Kov Lutas and me
  to win your freedom. And after the thing had been done, she was beside
  herself with worry for fear you would be captured. Every day she besought me
  to try to obtain news of you. You should know, also, that the tales of her
  heartless flirtations were utterly false, invented by Sel Han and spread by
  his henchmen to keep off powerful rivals. She was no more a murderous siren
  than our little Thaine. That I can attest, and I have known her all her
  life.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thorne was stunned. &ldquo;I have done her a great wrong, old
  friend,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and not only in my heart. I openly cut her
  when she held out her arms to me that night in Takkor Castle. I have lost the
  only woman I ever really loved through my own lack of faith.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She saved your life in the cave at the risk of her own,&rdquo; Lal
  Vak reminded him. &ldquo;Is that the act of one who has ceased to
  care?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; groaned Thorne. &ldquo;The more I see of
  women the less I understand them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;At least, you should call on her and apologize.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That I will do. Let us go to her apartment.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>As they approached the door of Neva&rsquo;s apartment, two guards saluted
  smartly and stood aside for them to enter. In the reception room a slave girl
  met them. &ldquo;Tell your mistress Sheb Takkor is calling,&rdquo; Thorne
  told her.</p>

  <p>The slave girl returned almost immediately. &ldquo;My mistress is not
  receiving callers, my lord,&rdquo; she said.</p>

  <p>Thorne turned to Lal Vak. &ldquo;You see, I was right,&rdquo; he said.
  &ldquo;But it is no more than I deserve for my little faith. Come. Let us go
  back to my apartment. I must prepare for my journey.&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch24"
     name="ch24"></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

  <p class="first">BACK in his apartment with Lal Vak, Thorne notified Vorz
  that they were leaving. Then he went to the writing board, spread a scroll,
  and composed a letter. Then he rolled it, placed it in a wooden tube, and
  handed it to Lal Vak.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Give this to Neva after I am gone,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I
  shall be grateful to you. I have apologized for my boorish conduct and
  thanked her for having twice saved my life - a life that has become empty and
  purposeless without her. But it is, as you have said, the least I can do, and
  unfortunately, the most I can do, as well.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lal Vak thrust the cylinder under his belt. &ldquo;Ill be glad to deliver
  this for you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll go out and arrange for
  your transportation.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Presently he returned. &ldquo;A flying machine awaits you on the
  roof,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and his majesty is ready to receive you.&rdquo;
  Thorne emptied his pulcho cup and arose. The scientist conducted him to a
  reception room where Miradon Vil, resplendent in his royal cloak of peacock
  blue trimmed with gold, was standing on the dais before the throne addressing
  a number of his nobles. But when the Rad of Takkor was announced, he
  dismissed them all and stepped down to receive his guest.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My boy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am happy to see you well, and with
  your memory and reason restored.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; replied Thorne, &ldquo;am equally happy to see your
  majesty restored to the throne of your ancestors; but no happier, I am sure,
  than every citizen, high and low, in Xancibar.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Some time ago,&rdquo; said Miradon, &ldquo;I rendered you the empty
  thanks of a deposed Vil. Today I am in a position to show my gratitude more
  tangibly and practically. First, I free you and Takkor from all allegiance to
  Xancibar. This makes you the supreme ruler of the raddek, and the collector
  and dispenser of all Takkor revenues.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Second, I have conferred with the Vils of the other great powers of
  Mars, and we have decided that you shall be the arbiter of our destinies. You
  captured the weapons and the laboratory with which Sel Han sought to conquer
  Mars. In unscrupulous hands they could do much harm. But we have faith in
  you. We want you to keep them, to protect us against any other ambitious
  plotters who may arise, so that we may fight our wars and settle our
  differences with the weapons of honor and chivalry we have always used. So,
  in effect, we make you the custodian of our liberty.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>From a taboret which stood beside the dais, he took a golden medal, set
  with sparkling jewels and hung on a heavy golden chain. &ldquo;This
  commemorates our resolution, and is the badge of your high office.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Inscribed on the medal Thorne read:</p>

  <p>SHEB TAKKOR</p>

  <p>Supreme Arbiter of Destiny</p>

  <p>and</p>

  <p>Custodian of Liberty</p>

  <p>by the will of the Associated Vilets</p>

  <p>of Mars</p>

  <p>The Vil snapped the chain around Thorne&rsquo;s neck, so the new medal
  flashed and scintillated on his chest just above the Takkor medallion.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am overwhelmed, your majesty,&rdquo; said Thorne. &ldquo;The
  nations of Mars have placed too high a value on my poor services.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Miradon smiled and stroked his silky golden beard. &ldquo;There is but one
  more thing, and I will give you leave to go.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He raised his hand, and a flourish of trumpets sounded from the doorway.
  Two heralds entered, trumpets resting on hips. Behind them came six pages,
  carrying a gold-embroidered cloak of peacock blue like that worn by the Vil.
  Following the pages was another, bearing a jar of pulcho and a gem- encrusted
  golden cup.</p>

  <p>The heralds separated, and stood, one at each side of the dais. The pages
  held the cloak spread before the Vil.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Permit me,&rdquo; said Miradon, unfastening Thorne&rsquo;s head
  straps and removing his cloak of orange and black. He handed the cloak to a
  slave, and taking the one which the pages had brought, fastened its jeweled
  straps about Thorne&rsquo;s head. Then the last page came up with the pulcho
  and the cup.</p>

  <p>Filling the cup, the Vil drank half its contents, then passed it to
  Thorne. &ldquo;Drink,&rdquo; he commanded.</p>

  <p>Thorne drained the cup and returned it to the tray.</p>

  <p>The Vil raised both hands before his face. &ldquo;I shield my eyes to the
  Zovil of Xancibar,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>Thorne raised his hands and responded to the salutation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is all,&rdquo; said Miradon. &ldquo;And now, since you insist
  on leaving us so soon, Lal Vak will conduct you to the roof. I will be there
  to see you off in a few moments.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In the company of the scientist Thorne left the presence, and climbed the
  stairs toward the roof.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell me something, Lal Vak,&rdquo; said Thorne. &ldquo;What is the
  significance of this cloak? And what is a zovil?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A zovil,&rdquo; replied the scientist, &ldquo;is a vil&rsquo;s son,
  just as a zorad is a rad&rsquo;s son. The cloak, and the ceremony that went
  with it, made you a prince of the imperial house of Xancibar.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I seem to have gotten almost everything on this planet but the one
  I want the most,&rdquo; said Thorne morosely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I presume that you refer to Neva,&rdquo; said Lal Vak. &ldquo;Well,
  don&rsquo;t consider her totally lost to you, yet. Women have been known to
  change their minds, you know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>* * *</p>

  <p>On the roof of the palace a great metal flying machine stood waiting.
  Standing around it was a group of the most exalted nobles and officials of
  Xancibar.</p>

  <p>A moment later the leonine head of Miradon Vil appeared above the top of
  the stairway. As he stepped out on the roof the courtiers again rendered the
  imperial salute. He walked up to Thorne and placed his huge hands on his
  shoulders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Farewell, my son,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and take good care of that
  which I have entrusted to you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>As he spoke, it seemed to Thorne that his voice broke slightly, and there
  was a suspicion of tears in his eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Farewell, your majesty,&rdquo; Thorne replied.</p>

  <p>The warrior went up to the forward cab with Vorz and the pilot, and closed
  the door after him. Thorne turned to select a seat. Then he gasped in
  amazement.</p>

  <p>Seated near a window was Neva, clad in a most becoming costume of peacock
  blue, embroidered with gold. She smiled up at Thorne as he hurried to her
  side and bent over her. &ldquo;You!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
  believe my eyes!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lal Vak brought me your note,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;After I had
  read it I decided to forgive you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But - but, how came you here, and wearing the colors of
  royalty?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Since I am the only daughter of Miradon Vil, there is no one who
  has a better right to these colors.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But what of Thaine?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thaine,&rdquo; replied Neva, &ldquo;is the daughter of Irintz Tel.
  Miradon Vil - my father - when he went into exile, was determined to insure
  my safety, and to give me the advantages which were rightfully mine. So he
  exchanged me for Thaine when we were babies. Thaine doesn&rsquo;t know, yet,
  and I only learned the truth five days ago.&rdquo; &ldquo;</p>

  <p>Looking at her, Thorne decided that he must have been blind not to realize
  the resemblance between the fair-haired Vil and this girl before.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then - then his majesty, your father, knows you have come with
  me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course. Why else should he have performed the ceremony that made
  you Zovil of Xancibar?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Because, stupid, he could only make you a prince of his house by
  making you my husband. There is no other way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Full realization suddenly came to him. He caught her in his arms, sought
  and found her yielding lips. &ldquo;Neva, beloved!&rdquo; he murmured.
  &ldquo;Are you really my wife?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Unto death, Deza help you!&rdquo; she replied archly.</p>

  <p>But there was a starry light in her glorious eyes which he could not fail
  to understand.</p>
