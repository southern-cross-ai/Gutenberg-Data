  <p class="first">CAPTAIN HARRISON of the <i>Ares</i> expedition turned away
  from the little telescope in the bow of the rocket. "Two weeks more, at the
  most," he remarked. "Mars only retogrades for seventy days in all, relative
  to the earth, and we've got to be homeward bound during that period, or wait
  a year and a half for old Mother Earth to go around the sun and catch up with
  us again. How'd you like to spend a winter here?"</p>

  <p>Dick Jarvis, chemist of the party, shivered as he looked up from his
  notebook. "I'd just as soon spend it in a liquid air tank!" he averred.
  "These eighty-below-zero summer nights are plenty for me."</p>

  <p>"Well," mused the captain, "the first successful Martian expedition ought
  to be home long before then."</p>

  <p>"Successful if we get home," corrected Jarvis. "I don't trust these cranky
  rockets&mdash;not since the auxiliary dumped me in the middle of Thyle last
  week. Walking back from a rocket ride is a new sensation to me."</p>

  <p>"Which reminds me," returned Harrison, "that we've got to recover your
  films. They're important if we're to pull this trip out of the red. Remember
  how the public mobbed the first moon pictures? Our shots ought to pack 'em to
  the doors. And the broadcast rights, too; we might show a profit for the
  Academy."</p>

  <p>"What interests me," countered Jarvis, "is a personal profit. A book, for
  instance; exploration books are always popular. <i>Martian Deserts</i>
  &mdash;how's that for a title?"</p>

  <p>"Lousy!" grunted the captain. "Sounds like a cookbook for desserts. You'd
  have to call it 'Love Life of a Martian,' or something like that."</p>

  <p>Jarvis chuckled. "Anyway," he said, "if we once get back home, I'm going
  to grab what profit there is, and never, never, get any farther from the
  earth than a good stratosphere plane'll take me. I've learned to appreciate
  the planet after plowing over this dried-up pill we're on now."</p>

  <p>"I'll lay you odds you'll be back here year after next," grinned the
  Captain. "You'll want to visit your pal&mdash;that trick ostrich."</p>

  <p>"Tweel?" The other's tone sobered. "I wish I hadn't lost him, at that. He
  was a good scout. I'd never have survived the dream-beast but for him. And
  that battle with the pushcart things&mdash;I never even had a chance to thank
  him."</p>

  <p>"A pair of lunatics, you two," observed Harrison. He squinted through the
  port at the gray gloom of the Mare Cimmerium. "There comes the sun." He
  paused. "Listen, Dick&mdash;you and Leroy take the other auxiliary rocket and
  go out and salvage those films."</p>

  <p>Jarvis stared. "Me and Leroy?" he echoed ungrammatically. "Why not me and
  Putz? An engineer would have some chance of getting us there and back if the
  rocket goes bad on us."</p>

  <p>The captain nodded toward the stem, whence issued at that moment a medley
  of blows and guttural expletives. "Putz is going over the insides of the
  <i>Ares</i>," he announced. "He'll have his hands full until we leave,
  because I want every bolt inspected. It's too late for repairs once we cast
  off."</p>

  <p>"And if Leroy and I crack up? That's our last auxiliary."</p>

  <p>"Pick up another ostrich and walk back," suggested Harrison gruffly. Then
  he smiled. "If you have trouble, we'll hunt you out in the <i>Ares</i>," he
  finished. "Those films are important." He turned. "Leroy!"</p>

  <p>The dapper little biologist appeared, his face questioning.</p>

  <p>"You and Jarvis are off to salvage the auxiliary," the Captain said.
  "Everything's ready and you'd better start now. Call back at half-hour
  intervals; I'll be listening."</p>

  <p>Leroy's eyes glistened. "Perhaps we land for specimens&mdash;no?" he
  queried.</p>

  <p>"Land if you want to. This golf ball seems safe enough."</p>

  <p>"Except for the dream-beast," muttered Jarvis with a faint shudder. He
  frowned suddenly. "Say, as long as we're going that way, suppose I have a
  look for Tweel's home! He must live off there somewhere, and he's the most
  important thing we've seen on Mars."</p>

  <p>Harrison hesitated. "If I thought you could keep out of trouble," he
  muttered. "All right," he decided. "Have a look. There's food and water
  aboard the auxiliary; you can take a couple of days. But keep in touch with
  me, you saps!"</p>

  <p>Jarvis and Leroy went through the airlock out to the gray plain. The thin
  air, still scarcely warmed by the rising sun, bit flesh and lung like
  needles, and they gasped with a sense of suffocation. They dropped to a
  sitting posture, waiting for their bodies, trained by months in
  acclimatization chambers back on earth, to accommodate themselves to the
  tenuous air. Leroy's face, as always, turned a smothered blue, and Jarvis
  heard his own breath rasping and rattling in his throat. But in five minutes,
  the discomfort passed; they rose and entered the little auxiliary rocket that
  rested beside the black hull of the <i>Ares</i>.</p>

  <p>The under-jets roared out their fiery atomic blast; dirt and bits of
  shattered biopods spun away in a cloud as the rocket rose. Harrison watched
  the projectile trail its flaming way into the south, then turned back to his
  work.</p>

  <p>It was four days before he saw the rocket again. Just at evening, as the
  sun dropped behind the horizon with the suddenness of a candle falling into
  the sea, the auxiliary flashed out of the southern heavens, easing gently
  down on the flaming wings of the under-jets. Jarvis and Leroy emerged, passed
  through the swiftly gathering dusk, and faced him in the light of the
  <i>Ares</i>. He surveyed the two; Jarvis was tattered and scratched, but
  apparently in better condition than Leroy, whose dapperness was completely
  lost. The little biologist was pale as the nearer moon that glowed outside;
  one arm was bandaged in thermo-skin and his clothes hung in veritable rags.
  But it was his eyes that struck Harrison most strangely; to one who lived
  these many weary days with the diminutive Frenchman, there was something
  queer about them. They were frightened, plainly enough, and that was odd,
  since Leroy was no coward or he'd never have been one of the four chosen by
  the Academy for the first Martian expedition. But the fear in his eyes was
  more understandable than that other expression, that queer fixity of gaze
  like one in a trance, or like a person in an ecstasy. "Like a chap who's seen
  Heaven and Hell together," Harrison expressed it to himself. He was yet to
  discover how right he was.</p>

  <p>He assumed a gruffness as the weary pair sat down. "You're a fine looking
  couple!" he growled. "I should've known better than to let you wander off
  alone." He paused. "Is your arm all right, Leroy? Need any treatment?"</p>

  <p>Jarvis answered. "It's all right&mdash;just gashed. No danger of infection
  here, I guess; Leroy says there aren't any microbes on Mars."</p>

  <p>"Well," exploded the Captain, "Let's hear it, then! Your radio reports
  sounded screwy. 'Escaped from Paradise!' Huh!"</p>

  <p>"I didn't want to give details on the radio," said Jarvis soberly. "You'd
  have thought we'd gone loony."</p>

  <p>"I think so, anyway."</p>

  <p>"<i>Moi aussi!</i>" muttered Leroy. "I too!"</p>

  <p>"Shall I begin at the beginning?" queried the chemist. "Our early reports
  were pretty nearly complete." He stared at Putz, who had come in silently,
  his face and hands blackened with carbon, and seated himself beside
  Harrison.</p>

  <p>"At the beginning," the Captain decided.</p>

  <p>"Well," began Jarvis, "we got started all right, and flew due south along
  the meridian of the <i>Ares</i>, same course I'd followed last week. I was
  getting used to this narrow horizon, so I didn't feel so much like being
  cooped under a big bowl, but one does keep overestimating distances.
  Something four miles away looks eight when you're used to terrestrial
  curvature, and that makes you guess its size just four times too large. A
  little hill looks like a mountain until you're almost over it."</p>

  <p>"I know that," grunted Harrison.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but Leroy didn't, and I spent our first couple of hours trying to
  explain it to him. By the time he understood (if he does yet) we were past
  Cimmerium and over that Xanthus, desert, and then we crossed the canal with
  the mud city and the barrel-shaped citizens and the place where Tweel had
  shot the dream-beast. And nothing would do for Pierre here but that we put
  down so he could practice his biology on the remains. So we did.</p>

  <p>"The thing was still there. No sign of decay; couldn't be, of course,
  without bacterial forms of life, and Leroy says that Mars is as sterile as an
  operating table."</p>

  <p>"<i>Comme le coeur d'une fileuse</i>," corrected the little biologist, who
  was beginning to regain a trace of his usual energy. "Like an old maid's
  heart!"</p>

  <p>"However," resumed Jarvis, "about a hundred of the little gray-green
  biopods had fastened onto the thing and were growing and branching. Leroy
  found a stick and knocked 'em off, and each branch broke away and became a
  biopod crawling around with the others. So he poked around at the creature,
  while I looked away from it; even dead, that rope-armed devil gave me the
  creeps. And then came the surprise; the thing was part plant!"</p>

  <p>"<i>C'est vrai!</i>" confirmed the biologist. "It's true!"</p>

  <p>"It was a big cousin of the biopods," continued Jarvis. "Leroy was quite
  excited; he figures that all Martian life is of that sort&mdash;neither plant
  nor animal. Life here never differentiated, he says; everything has both
  natures in it, even the barrel-creatures&mdash;even Tweel! I think he's
  right, especially when I recall how Tweel rested, sticking his beak in the
  ground and staying that way all night. I never saw him eat or drink, either;
  perhaps his beak was more in the nature of a root, and he got his nourishment
  that way."</p>

  <p>"Sounds nutty to me," observed Harrison.</p>

  <p>"Well," continued Jarvis, "we broke up a few of the other growths and they
  acted the same way&mdash;the pieces crawled around, only much slower than the
  biopods, and then stuck themselves in the ground. Then Leroy had to catch a
  sample of the walking grass, and we were ready to leave when a parade of the
  barrel creatures rushed by with their pushcarts. They hadn't forgotten me,
  either; they all drummed out, 'We are v-r-r-iends&mdash;ouch!' just as they
  had before. Leroy wanted to shoot one and cut it up, but I remembered the
  battle Tweel and I had had with them, and vetoed the idea. But he did hit on
  a possible explanation as to what they did with all the rubbish they
  gathered."</p>

  <p>"Made mud-pies, I guess," grunted the captain.</p>

  <p>"More or less," agreed Jarvis. "They use it for food, Leroy thinks. If
  they're part vegetable, you see, that's what they'd want&mdash;soil with
  organic remains in it to make it fertile. That's why they ground up sand and
  biopods and other growths all together. See?"</p>

  <p>"Dimly," countered Harrison. "How about the suicides?"</p>

  <p>"Leroy had a hunch there, too. The suicides jump into the grinder when the
  mixture has too much sand and gravel; they throw themselves in to adjust the
  proportions."</p>

  <p>"Rats!" said Harrison disgustedly. "Why couldn't they bring in some extra
  branches from outside?"</p>

  <p>"Because suicide is easier. You've got to remember that these creatures
  can't be judged by earthly standards; they probably don't feel pain, and they
  haven't got what we'd call individuality. Any intelligence they have is the
  property of the whole community&mdash;like an ant-heap. That's it! Ants are
  willing to die for their ant-hill; so are these creatures."</p>

  <p>"So are men," observed the captain, "if it comes to that."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but men aren't exactly eager. It takes some emotion like patriotism
  to work 'em to the point of dying for their country; these things do it all
  in the day's work." He paused.</p>

  <p>"Well, we took some pictures of the dream-beast and the barrel-creatures,
  and then we started along. We sailed over Xanthus, keeping as close to the
  meridian of the <i>Ares</i> as we could, and pretty soon we crossed the trail
  of the pyramidbuilder. So we circled back to let Leroy take a look at it, and
  when we found it, we landed. The thing had completed just two rows of bricks
  since Tweel and I left it, and there it was, breathing in silicon and
  breathing out bricks as if it had eternity to do it in&mdash;which it has.
  Leroy wanted to dissect it with a Boland explosive bullet, but I thought that
  anything that had lived for ten million years was entitled to the respect due
  to old age, so I talked him out of it. He peeped into the hole on top of it
  and nearly got beaned by the arm coming up with a brick, and then he chipped
  off a few pieces of it, which didn't disturb the creature a bit. He found the
  place I'd chipped, tried to see if there was any sign of healing, and decided
  he could tell better in two or three thousand years. So we took a few shots
  of it and sailed on.</p>

  <p>"Mid-afternoon we located the wreck of my rocket. Not a thing disturbed;
  we picked up my films and tried to decide what next. I wanted to find Tweel
  if possible; I figured from the fact of his pointing south that he lived
  somewhere near Thyle. We plotted our route and judged that the desert we were
  in now was Thyle II; Thyle I should be east of us. So, on a hunch, we decided
  to have a look at Thyle I, and away we buzzed."</p>

  <p>"<i>Der</i> motors?" queried Putz, breaking his long silence.</p>

  <p>"For a wonder, we had no trouble, Karl. Your blast worked perfectly. So we
  bummed along, pretty high to get a wider view, I'd say about fifty thousand
  feet. Thyle II spread out like an orange carpet, and after a while we came to
  the gray branch of the Mare Chronium that bounded it. That was narrow; we
  crossed it in half an hour, and there was Thyle I&mdash;same orange-hued
  desert as its mate. We veered south, toward the Mare Australe, and followed
  the edge of the desert. And toward sunset we spotted it."</p>

  <p>"Shpotted?" echoed Putz. "Vot vas shpotted?"</p>

  <p>"The desert was spotted&mdash;with buildings! Not one of the mud cities of
  the canals, although a canal went through it. From the map we figured the
  canal was a continuation of the one Schiaparelli called Ascanius.</p>

  <p>"We were probably too high to be visible to any inhabitants of the city,
  but also too high for a good look at it, even with the glasses. However, it
  was nearly sunset, anyway, so we didn't plan on dropping in. We circled the
  place; the canal went out into the Mare Australe, and there, glittering in
  the south, was the melting polar ice-cap! The canal drained it; we could
  distinguish the sparkle of water in it. Off to the southeast, just at the
  edge of the Mare Australe, was a valley&mdash;the first irregularity I'd seen
  on Mars except the cliffs that bounded Xanthus and Thyle II. We flew over the
  valley&mdash;" Jarvis paused suddenly and shuddered; Leroy, whose color had
  begun to return, seemed to pale. The chemist resumed, "Well, the valley
  looked all right&mdash;then! Just a gray waste, probably full of crawlers
  like the others.</p>

  <p>"We circled back over the city; say, I want to tell you that place was
  &mdash;well, gigantic! It was colossal; at first I thought the size was due
  to that illusion I spoke of&mdash;you know, the nearness of the horizon
  &mdash;but it wasn't that. We sailed right over it, and you've never seen
  anything like it!</p>

  <p>"But the sun dropped out of sight right then. I knew we were pretty far
  south&mdash;latitude 60&mdash;but I didn't know just how much night we'd
  have."</p>

  <p>Harrison glanced at a Schiaparelli chart. "About 60&mdash;eh?" he said.
  "Close to what corresponds to the Antarctic Circle. You'd have about four
  hours of night at this season. Three months from now you'd have none at
  all."</p>

  <p>"Three months!" echoed Jarvis, surprised. Then he grinned. "Right! I
  forget the seasons here are twice as long as ours. Well, we sailed out into
  the desert about twenty miles, which put the city below the horizon in case
  we overslept, and there we spent the night.</p>

  <p>"You're right about the length of it. We had about four hours of darkness
  which left us fairly rested. We ate breakfast, called our location to you,
  and started over to have a look at the city.</p>

  <p>"We sailed toward it from the east and it loomed up ahead of us like a
  range of mountains. Lord, what a city! Not that New York mightn't have higher
  buildings, or Chicago cover more ground, but for sheer mass, those structures
  were in a class by themselves. Gargantuan!</p>

  <p>"There was a queer look about the place, though. You know how a
  terrestrial city sprawls out, a nimbus of suburbs, a ring of residential
  sections, factory districts, parks, highways, There was none of that here;
  the city rose out of the desert as abruptly as a cliff. Only a few little
  sand mounds marked the division, and then the walls of those gigantic
  structures.</p>

  <p>"The architecture was strange, too. There were lots of devices that are
  impossible back home, such as set-backs in reverse, so that a building with a
  small base could spread out as it rose. That would be a valuable trick in New
  York, where land is almost priceless, but to do it, you'd have to transfer
  Martian gravitation there!</p>

  <p>"Well, since you can't very well land a rocket in a city street, we put
  down right next to the canal side of the city, took our small cameras and
  revolvers, and started for a gap in the wall of masonry. We weren't ten feet
  from the rocket when we both saw the explanation for a lot of the
  queerness.</p>

  <p>"The city was in ruin! Abandoned, deserted, dead as Babylon! Or at least,
  so it looked to us then, with its empty streets which, if they <i>had</i>
  been paved, were now deep under sand."</p>

  <p>"A ruin, eh?" commented Harrison. "How old?"</p>

  <p>"How could we tell?" countered Jarvis. "The next expedition to this golf
  ball ought to carry an archeologist&mdash;and a philologist, too, as we found
  out later. But it's a devil of a job to estimate the age of anything here;
  things weather so slowly that most of the buildings might have been put up
  yesterday. No rainfall, no earthquakes, no vegetation is here to spread
  cracks with its roots&mdash;nothing. The only aging factors here are the
  erosion of the wind&mdash;and that's negligible in this atmosphere&mdash;and
  the cracks caused by changing temperature. And one other agent&mdash;
  meteorites. They must crash down occasionally on the city, judging from the
  thinness of the air, and the fact that we've seen four strike ground right
  here near the <i>Ares</i>."</p>

  <p>"Seven," corrected the captain. "Three dropped while you were gone."</p>

  <p>"Well, damage by meteorites must be slow, anyway. Big ones would be as
  rare here as on earth, because big ones get through in spite of the
  atmosphere, and those buildings could sustain a lot of little ones. My guess
  at the city's age&mdash;and it may be wrong by a big percentage&mdash;would
  be fifteen thousand years. Even that's thousands of years older than any
  human civilization; fifteen thousand years ago was the Late Stone Age in the
  history of mankind.</p>

  <p>"So Leroy and I crept up to those tremendous buildings feeling like
  pygmies, sort of awe-struck, and talking in whispers. I tell you, it was
  ghostly walking down that dead and deserted street, and every time we passed
  through a shadow, we shivered, and not just because shadows are cold on Mars.
  We felt like intruders, as if the great race that had built the place might
  resent our presence even across a hundred and fifty centuries. The place was
  as quiet as a grave, but we kept imagining things and peeping down the dark
  lanes between buildings and looking over our shoulders. Most of the
  structures were windowless, but when we did see an opening in those vast
  walls, we couldn't look away, expecting to see some horror peering out of
  it.</p>

  <p>"Then we passed an edifice with an open arch; the doors were there, but
  blocked open by sand. I got up nerve enough to take a look inside, and then,
  of course, we discovered we'd forgotten to take our flashes. But we eased a
  few feet into the darkness and the passage debauched into a colossal hall.
  Far above us a little crack let in a pallid ray of daylight, not nearly
  enough to light the place; I couldn't even see if the hall rose clear to the
  distant roof. But I know the place was enormous; I said something to Leroy
  and a million thin echoes came clipping back to us out of the darkness. And
  after that, we began to hear other sounds&mdash;slithering rustling noises,
  and whispers, and sounds like suppressed breathing&mdash;and something black
  and silent passed between us and that far-away crevice of light.</p>

  <p>"Then we saw three little greenish spots of luminosity in the dusk to our
  left. We stood staring at them, and suddenly they all shifted at once. Leroy
  yelled '<i>Ce sont des yeux!</i>' and they were! They were eyes! Well, we
  stood frozen for a moment, while Leroy's yell reverberated back and forth
  between the distant walls, and the echoes repeated the words in queer, thin
  voices. There were mumblings and mutterings and whisperings and sounds like
  strange soft laughter, and then the three-eyed thing moved again. Then we
  broke for the door!</p>

  <p>"We felt better out in the sunlight; we looked at each other sheepishly,
  but neither of us suggested another look at the buildings inside&mdash;
  though we <i>did</i> see the place later, and that was queer, too&mdash;but
  you'll hear about it when I come to it. We just loosened our revolvers and
  crept on along that ghostly street.</p>

  <p>"The street curved and twisted and subdivided. I kept careful note of our
  directions, since we couldn't risk getting lost in that gigantic maze.
  Without our thermo-skin bags, night would finish us, even if what lurked in
  the ruins didn't. By and by, I noticed that we were veering back toward the
  canal, the buildings ended and there were only a few dozen ragged stone huts
  which looked as though they might have been built of debris from the city. I
  was just beginning to feel a bit disappointed at finding no trace of Tweel's
  people here when we rounded a corner and there he was!</p>

  <p>"I yelled 'Tweel!' but he just stared, and then I realized that he wasn't
  Tweel, but another Martian of his sort. Tweel's feathery appendages were more
  orange hued and he stood several inches taller than this one. Leroy was
  sputtering in excitement, and the Martian kept his vicious beak directed at
  us, so I stepped forward as peace-maker.</p>

  <p>"I said 'Tweel?' very questioningly, but there was no result. I tried it a
  dozen times, and we finally had to give it up; we couldn't connect.</p>

  <p>"Leroy and I walked toward the huts, and the Martian followed us. Twice he
  was joined by others, and each time I tried yelling 'Tweel' at them but they
  just stared at us. So we ambled on with the three trailing us, and then it
  suddenly occurred to me that my Martian accent might be at fault. I faced the
  group and tried trilling it out the way Tweel himself did:
  'T-r-r-rweee-r-rl!' Like that.</p>

  <p>"And that worked! One of them spun his head around a full ninety degrees,
  and screeched 'T-r-r-rweee-r-rl!' and a moment later, like an arrow from a
  bow, Tweel came sailing over the nearer huts to land on his beak in front of
  me!</p>

  <p>"Man, we were glad to see each other! Tweel set up a twittering and
  chirping like a farm in summer and went sailing up and coming down on his
  beak, and I would have grabbed his hands, only he wouldn't keep still long
  enough.</p>

  <p>"The other Martians and Leroy just stared, and after a while, Tweel
  stopped bouncing, and there we were. We couldn't talk to each other any more
  than we could before, so after I'd said 'Tweel' a couple of times and he'd
  said 'Tick,' we were more or less helpless. However, it was only midmorning,
  and it seemed important to learn all we could about Tweel and the city, so I
  suggested that he guide us around the place if he weren't busy. I put over
  the idea by pointing back at the buildings and then at him and us.</p>

  <p>"Well, apparently he wasn't too busy, for he set off with us, leading the
  way with one of his hundred and fifty-foot nosedives that set Leroy gasping.
  When we caught up, he said something like 'one, one, two&mdash;two, two,
  four&mdash;no, no&mdash;yes, yes&mdash;rock&mdash;no breet!' That didn't seem
  to mean anything; perhaps he was just letting Leroy know that he could speak
  English, or perhaps he was merely running over his vocabulary to refresh his
  memory.</p>

  <p>"Anyway, he showed us around. He had a light of sorts in his black pouch,
  good enough for small rooms, but simply lost in some of the colossal caverns
  we went through. Nine out of ten buildings meant absolutely nothing to us
  &mdash;just vast empty chambers, full of shadows and rustlings and echoes. I
  couldn't imagine their use; they didn't seem suitable for living quarters, or
  even for commercial purposes&mdash;trade and so forth; they might have been
  all right as power-houses, but what could have been the purpose of a whole
  city full? And where were the remains of the machinery?</p>

  <p>"The place was a mystery. Sometimes Tweel would show us through a hall
  that would have housed an ocean-liner, and he'd seem to swell with pride
  &mdash;and we couldn't make a damn thing of it! As a display of architectural
  power, the city was colossal; as anything else it was just nutty!</p>

  <p>"But we did see one thing that registered. We came to that same building
  Leroy and I had entered earlier&mdash;the one with the three eyes in it.
  Well, we were a little shaky about going in there, but Tweel twittered and
  trilled and kept saying, 'Yes, yes, yes!' so we followed him, staring
  nervously about for the thing that had watched us. However, that hall was
  just like the others, full of murmurs and slithering noises and shadowy
  things slipping away into corners. If the three-eyed creature were still
  there, it must have slunk away with the others.</p>

  <p>"Tweel led us along the wall; his light showed a series of little alcoves,
  and in the first of these we ran into a puzzling thing&mdash;a very weird
  thing. As the light flashed into the alcove, I saw first just an empty space,
  and then, squatting on the floor, I saw&mdash;it! A little creature about as
  big as a large rat, it was, gray and huddled and evidently startled by our
  appearance. It had the queerest, most devilish little face!&mdash;pointed
  ears or horns and satanic eyes that seemed to sparkle with a sort of fiendish
  intelligence.</p>

  <p>"Tweel saw it, too, and let out a screech of anger, and the creature rose
  on two pencil-thin legs and scuttled off with a half-terrified, half-defiant
  squeak. It darted past us into the darkness too quickly even for Tweel, and
  as it ran, something waved on its body like the fluttering of a cape. Tweel
  screeched angrily at it and set up a shrill hullabaloo that sounded like
  genuine rage.</p>

  <p>"But the thing was gone, and then I noticed the weirdest of imaginable
  details. Where it had squatted on the floor was&mdash;a book! It had been
  hunched over a book!</p>

  <p>"I took a step forward; sure enough, there was some sort of inscription on
  the pages&mdash;wavy white lines like a seismograph record on black sheets
  like the material of Tweel's pouch. Tweel fumed and whistled in wrath, picked
  up the volume and slammed it into place on a shelf full of others. Leroy and
  I stared dumbfounded at each other.</p>

  <p>"Had the little thing with the fiendish face been reading? Or was it
  simply eating the pages, getting physical nourishment rather than mental? Or
  had the whole thing been accidental?</p>

  <p>"If the creature were some rat-like pest that destroyed books, Tweel's
  rage was understandable, but why should he try to prevent an intelligent
  being, even though of an alien race, from <i>reading</i>&mdash;if it
  <i>was</i>reading. I don't know; I did notice that the book was entirely
  undamaged, nor did I see a damaged book among any that we handled. But I have
  an odd hunch that if we knew the secret of the little cape-clothed imp, we'd
  know the mystery of the vast abandoned city and of the decay of Martian
  culture.</p>

  <p>"Well, Tweel quieted down after a while and led us completely around that
  tremendous hall. It had been a library, I think; at least, there were
  thousands upon thousands of those queer black-paged volumes printed in wavy
  lines of white. There were pictures, too, in some; and some of these showed
  Tweel's people. That's a point, of course; it indicated that his race built
  the city and printed the books. I don't think the greatest philologist on
  earth will ever translate one line of those records; they were made by minds
  too different from ours.</p>

  <p>"Tweel could read them, naturally. He twittered off a few lines, and then
  I took a few of the books, with his permission; he said 'no, no!' to some and
  'yes, yes!' to others. Perhaps he kept back the ones his people needed, or
  perhaps he let me take the ones he thought we'd understand most easily. I
  don't know; the books are outside there in the rocket.</p>

  <p>"Then he held that dim torch of his toward the walls, and they were
  pictured. Lord, what pictures! They stretched up and up into the blackness of
  the roof, mysterious and gigantic. I couldn't make much of the first wall; it
  seemed to be a portrayal of a great assembly of Tweel's people. Perhaps it
  was meant to symbolize Society or Government. But the next wall was more
  obvious; it showed creatures at work on a colossal machine of some sort, and
  that would be Industry or Science. The back wall had corroded away in part,
  from what we could see, I suspected the scene was meant to portray Art, but
  it was on the fourth wall that we got a shock that nearly dazed us.</p>

  <p>"I think the symbol was Exploration or Discovery. This wall was a little
  plainer, because the moving beam of daylight from that crack lit up the
  higher surface and Tweel's torch illuminated the lower. We made out a giant
  seated figure, one of the beaked Martians like Tweel, but with every limb
  suggesting heaviness, weariness. The arms dropped inertly on the chair, the
  thin neck bent and the beak rested on the body, as if the creature could
  scarcely bear its own weight. And before it was a queer kneeling figure, and
  at sight of it, Leroy and I almost reeled against each other. It was,
  apparently, a man!"</p>

  <p>"A man!" bellowed Harrison. "A man you say?"</p>

  <p>"I said apparently," retorted Jarvis. "The artist had exaggerated the nose
  almost to the length of Tweel's beak, but the figure had black
  shoulder-length hair, and instead of the Martian four, there were
  <i>five</i>fingers on its outstretched hand! It was kneeling as if in worship
  of the Martian, and on the ground was what looked like a pottery bowl full of
  some food as an offering. Well! Leroy and I thought we'd gone screwy!"</p>

  <p>"And Putz and I think so, too!" roared the captain.</p>

  <p>"Maybe we all have," replied Jarvis, with a faint grin at the pale face of
  the little Frenchman, who returned it in silence. "Anyway," he continued,
  "Tweel was squeaking and pointing at the figure, and saying 'Tick! Tick!' so
  he recognized the resemblance&mdash;and never mind any cracks about my nose!"
  he warned the captain. "It was Leroy who made the important comment; he
  looked at the Martian and said 'Thoth! The god Thoth!'"</p>

  <p>"<i>Oui!</i>" confirmed the biologist. "<i>Comme l'Egypte!</i>"</p>

  <p>"Yeah," said Jarvis. "Like the Egyptian ibis-headed god&mdash;the one with
  the beak. Well, no sooner did Tweel hear the name Thoth than he set up a
  clamor of twittering and squeaking. He pointed at himself and said 'Thoth!
  Thoth!' and then waved his arm all around and repeated it. Of course he often
  did queer things, but we both thought we understood what he meant. He was
  trying to tell us that his race called themselves Thoth. Do you see what I'm
  getting at?"</p>

  <p>"I see, all right," said Harrison. "You think the Martians paid a visit to
  the earth, and the Egyptians remembered it in their mythology. Well, you're
  off, then; there wasn't any Egyptian civilization fifteen thousand years
  ago."</p>

  <p>"Wrong!" grinned Jarvis. "It's too bad we haven't an archeologist with us,
  but Leroy tells me that there was a stone-age culture in Egypt then, the
  pre-dynastic civilization."</p>

  <p>"Well, even so, what of it?"</p>

  <p>"Plenty! Everything in that picture proves my point. The attitude of the
  Martian, heavy and weary&mdash;that's the unnatural strain of terrestrial
  gravitation. The name Thoth; Leroy tells me Thoth was the Egyptian god of
  philosophy and the inventor of writing! Get that? They must have picked up
  the idea from watching the Martian take notes. It's too much for coincidence
  that Thoth should be beaked and ibis-headed, and that the beaked Martians
  call themselves Thoth."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll be hanged! But what about the nose on the Egyptian? Do you
  mean to tell me that stone-age Egyptians had longer noses than ordinary
  men?"</p>

  <p>"Of course not! It's just that the Martians very naturally cast their
  paintings in Martianized form. Don't human beings tend to relate everything
  to themselves? That's why dugongs and manatees started the mermaid myths
  &mdash;sailors thought they saw human features on the beasts. So the Martian
  artist, drawing either from descriptions or imperfect photographs, naturally
  exaggerated the size of the human nose to a degree that looked normal to him.
  Or anyway, that's my theory."</p>

  <p>"Well, it'll do as a theory," grunted Harrison. "What I want to hear is
  why you two got back here looking like a couple of year-before-last bird's
  nests."</p>

  <p>Jarvis shuddered again, and cast another glance at Leroy. The little
  biologist was recovering some of his accustomed poise, but he returned the
  glance with an echo of the chemist's shudder.</p>

  <p>"We'll get to that," resumed the latter. "Meanwhile I'll stick to Tweel
  and his people. We spent the better part of three days with them, as you
  know. I can't give every detail, but I'll summarize the important facts and
  give our conclusions, which may not be worth an inflated franc. It's hard to
  judge this dried-up world by earthly standards.</p>

  <p>"We took pictures of everything possible; I even tried to photograph that
  gigantic mural in the library, but unless Tweel's lamp was unusually rich in
  actinic rays, I don't suppose it'll show. And that's a pity, since it's
  undoubtedly the most interesting object we've found on Mars, at least from a
  human viewpoint.</p>

  <p>"Tweel was a very courteous host. He took us to all the points of interest
  &mdash;even the new water-works."</p>

  <p>Putz's eyes brightened at the word. "Vater-vorks?" he echoed. "For
  vot?"</p>

  <p>"For the canal, naturally. They have to build up a head of water to drive
  it through; that's obvious." He looked at the captain. "You told me yourself
  that to drive water from the polar caps of Mars to the equator was equivalent
  to forcing it up a twenty-mile hill, because Mars is flattened at the poles
  and bulges at the equator just like the earth."</p>

  <p>"That's true," agreed Harrison.</p>

  <p>"Well," resumed Jarvis, "this city was one of the relay stations to boost
  the flow. Their power plant was the only one of the giant buildings that
  seemed to serve any useful purpose, and that was worth seeing. I wish you'd
  seen it, Karl; you'll have to make what you can from our pictures. It's a
  sun-power plant!"</p>

  <p>Harrison and Putz stared. "Sun-power!" grunted the captain. "That's
  primitive!" And the engineer added an emphatic "<i>Ja!</i>" of agreement.</p>

  <p>"Not as primitive as all that," corrected Jarvis. "The sunlight focused on
  a queer cylinder in the center of a big concave mirror, and they drew an
  electric current from it. The juice worked the pumps."</p>

  <p>"A t'ermocouple" ejaculated Putz.</p>

  <p>"That sounds reasonable; you can judge by the pictures. But the power
  plant had some queer things about it. The queerest was that the machinery was
  tended, not by Tweel's people, but by some of the barrel-shaped creatures
  like the ones in Xanthus!" He gazed around at the faces of his auditors;
  there was no comment.</p>

  <p>"Get it?" he resumed. At their silence, he proceeded, "I see you don't.
  Leroy figured it out, but whether rightly or wrongly, I don't know. He thinks
  that the barrels and Tweel's race have a reciprocal arrangement like&mdash;
  well, like bees and flowers on earth. The flowers give honey for the bees;
  the bees carry the pollen for the flowers. See? The barrels tend the works
  and Tweel's people build the canal system. The Xanthus city must have been a
  boosting station; that explains the mysterious machines I saw. And Leroy
  believes further that it isn't an intelligent arrangement&mdash;not on the
  part of the barrels, at least&mdash;but that it's been done for so many
  thousands of generations that it's become instinctive a tropism&mdash;just
  like the actions of ants and bees. The creatures have been bred to it!"</p>

  <p>"Nuts!" observed Harrison. "Let's hear you explain the reason for that big
  empty city, then."</p>

  <p>"Sure. Tweel's civilization is decadent, that's the reason. It's a dying
  race, and out of all the millions that must once have lived there, Tweel's
  couple of hundred companions are the remnant. They're an outpost, left to
  tend the source of the water at the polar cap; probably there are still a few
  respectable cities left somewhere on the canal system, most likely near the
  tropics. It's the last gasp of a race&mdash;and a race that reached a higher
  peak of culture than Man!"</p>

  <p>"Huh?" said Harrison. "Then why are they dying? Lack of water?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think so," responded the chemist. "If my guess at the city's age
  is right, fifteen thousand years wouldn't make enough difference in the water
  supply&mdash;nor a hundred thousand for that matter. It's something else,
  though the water's doubtless a factor."</p>

  <p>"<i>Das wasser</i>," cut in Putz. "Vere goes dot?"</p>

  <p>"Even a chemist knows that!" scoffed Jarvis. "At least on earth. Here I'm
  not so sure, but on earth, every time there's a lightning flash, it
  electrolyzes some water vapor into hydrogen and oxygen, and then the hydrogen
  escapes into space, because terrestrial gravitation won't hold it
  permanently. And every time there's an earthquake, some water is lost to the
  interior. Slow&mdash;but damned certain." He turned to Harrison. "Right,
  Cap?"</p>

  <p>"Right," conceded the captain. "But here, of course&mdash;no earthquakes,
  no thunderstorms&mdash;the loss must be very slow. Then why is the race
  dying?"</p>

  <p>"The sunpower plant answers that," countered Jarvis. "Lack of fuel! Lack
  of power! No oil left, no coal left&mdash;if Mars ever had a Carboniferous
  Age&mdash;and no water-power&mdash;just the driblets of energy they can get
  from the sun. That's why they're dying."</p>

  <p>"With the limitless energy of the atom?" exploded Harrison.</p>

  <p>"They don't know about atomic energy. Probably never did. Must have used
  some other principle in their space-ship."</p>

  <p>"Then," snapped the captain, "what makes you rate their intelligence above
  the human? <i>We've</i> finally cracked open the atom!"</p>

  <p>"Sure we have. We had a clue, didn't we? Radium and uranium. Do you think
  we'd ever have learned how without those elements? We'd never even have
  suspected that atomic energy existed!"</p>

  <p>"Well? Haven't they&mdash;</p>

  <p>"No, they haven't. You've told me yourself that Mars has only 73 percent
  of the earth's density. Even a chemist can see that that means a lack of
  heavy metals&mdash;no osmium, no uranium, no radium. They didn't have the
  clue."</p>

  <p>"Even so, that doesn't prove they're more advanced than we are. If they
  were <i>more</i> advanced, they'd have discovered it anyway."</p>

  <p>"Maybe," conceded Jarvis. "I'm not claiming that we don't surpass them in
  some ways. But in others, they're far ahead of us."</p>

  <p>"In what, for instance?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;Socially, for one thing."</p>

  <p>"Huh? How do you mean?"</p>

  <p>Jarvis glanced in turn at each of the three that faced him. He hesitated.
  "I wonder how you chaps will take this," he muttered. "Naturally, everybody
  likes his own system best." He frowned. "Look here&mdash;on the earth we have
  three types of society, haven't we? And there's a member of each type right
  here. Putz lives under a dictatorship&mdash;an autocracy. Leroy's a citizen
  of the Sixth Commune in France. Harrison and I are Americans, members of a
  democracy. There you are&mdash;autocracy, democracy, communism&mdash;the
  three types of terrestrial societies. Tweel's people have a different system
  from any of us."</p>

  <p>"Different? What is it?"</p>

  <p>"The one no earthly nation has tried. Anarchy!"</p>

  <p>"Anarchy!" the captain and Putz burst out together.</p>

  <p>"That's right."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;" Harrison was sputtering. "What do you mean, they're ahead of
  us? Anarchy! Bah!"</p>

  <p>"All right&mdash;bah!" retorted Jarvis. "I'm not saying it would work for
  us, or for any race of men. But it works for them."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;anarchy!" The captain was indignant.</p>

  <p>"Well, when you come right down to it," argued Jarvis defensively,
  "anarchy is the ideal form of government, if it works. Emerson said that the
  best government was that which governs least, and so did Wendell Phillips,
  and I think George Washington. And you can't have any form of government
  which governs less than anarchy, which is no government at all!"</p>

  <p>The captain was sputtering. "But&mdash;it's unnatural! Even savage tribes
  have their chiefs! Even a pack of wolves has its leader!"</p>

  <p>"Well," retorted Jarvis defiantly, "that only proves that government is a
  primitive device, doesn't it? With a perfect race you wouldn't need it at
  all; government is a confession of weakness, isn't it? It's a confession that
  part of the people won't cooperate with the rest and that you need laws to
  restrain those individuals which a psychologist calls anti-social. If there
  were no anti-social persons&mdash;criminals and such&mdash;you wouldn't need
  laws or police, would you?"</p>

  <p>"But government! You'd need government! How about public works&mdash;
  wars&mdash;taxes?"</p>

  <p>"No wars on Mars, in spite of being named after the War God. No point in
  wars here; the population is too thin and too scattered, and besides, it
  takes the help of every single community to keep the canal system
  functioning. No taxes because apparently all individuals cooperate in
  building public works. No competition to cause trouble, because anybody can
  help himself to anything. As I said, with a perfect race government is
  entirely unnecessary."</p>

  <p>"And do you consider the Martians a perfect race?" asked the captain
  grimly.</p>

  <p>"Not at all! But they've existed so much longer than man that they're
  evolved, socially at least, to the point where they don't need government.
  They work together, that's all." Jarvis paused. "Queer, isn't it&mdash;as if
  Mother Nature were carrying on two experiments, one at home and one on Mars.
  On earth it's the trial of an emotional, highly competitive race in a world
  of plenty; here it's the trial of a quiet, friendly race on a desert,
  unproductive, and inhospitable world. Everything here makes for cooperation.
  Why, there isn't even the factor that causes so much trouble at home&mdash;
  sex!"</p>

  <p>"Huh?"</p>

  <p>"Yeah: Tweel's people reproduce just like the barrels in the mud cities;
  two individuals grow a third one between them. Another proof of Leroy's
  theory that Martian life is neither animal nor vegetable. Besides, Tweel was
  a good enough host to let him poke down his beak and twiddle his feathers,
  and the examination convinced Leroy."</p>

  <p>"Oui," confirmed the biologist. "It is true."</p>

  <p>"But anarchy!" grumbled Harrison disgustedly. "It would show up on a
  dizzy, half-dead pill like Mars!"</p>

  <p>"It'll be a good many centuries before you'll have to worry about it on
  earth," grinned Jarvis. He resumed his narrative.</p>

  <p>"Well, we wandered through that sepulchral city, taking pictures of
  everything. And then&mdash;" Jarvis paused and shuddered&mdash;"then I took a
  notion to have a look at that valley we'd spotted from the rocket. I don't
  know why. But when we tried to steer Tweel in that direction, he set up such
  a squawking and screeching that I thought he'd gone batty."</p>

  <p>"If possible!" jeered Harrison.</p>

  <p>"So we started over there without him; he kept wailing and screaming, 'No
  &mdash;no&mdash;no! Tick!' but that made us the more curious. He sailed over
  our heads and stuck on his beak, and went through a dozen other antics, but
  we ploughed on, and finally he gave up and trudged disconsolately along with
  us.</p>

  <p>"The valley wasn't more than a mile southeast of the city. Tweel could
  have covered the distance in twenty jumps, but he lagged and loitered and
  kept pointing back at the city and wailing 'No&mdash;no&mdash;no!' Then he'd
  sail up into the air and zip down on his beak directly in front of us, and
  we'd have to walk around him. I'd seen him do lots of crazy things before, of
  course; I was used to them, but it was as plain as print that he didn't want
  us to see that valley."</p>

  <p>"Why?" queried Harrison.</p>

  <p>"You asked why we came back like tramps," said Jarvis with a faint
  shudder. "You'll learn. We plugged along up a low rocky hill that bounded it,
  and as we neared the top, Tweel said, 'No breet, Tick! No breet!' Well, those
  were the words he used to describe the silicon monster; they were also the
  words he had used to tell me that the image of Fancy Long, the one that had
  almost lured me to the dream-beast, wasn't real. I remembered that, but it
  meant nothing to me then!</p>

  <p>"Right after that, Tweel said, 'You one&mdash;one&mdash;two, he one
  &mdash;one&mdash;two,' and then I began to see. That was the phrase he had
  used to explain the dream-beast to tell me that what I thought, the creature
  thought&mdash;to tell me how the thing lured its victims by their own
  desires. So I warned Leroy; it seemed to me that even the dream-beast
  couldn't be dangerous if we were warned and expecting it. Well, I was
  wrong!</p>

  <p>"As we reached the crest, Tweel spun his head completely around, so his
  feet were forward but his eyes looked backward, as if he feared to gaze into
  the valley. Leroy and I stared out over it, just a gray waste like this
  around us, with the gleam of the south polar cap far beyond its southern rim.
  That's what it was one second; the next it was&mdash;Paradise!"</p>

  <p>"What?" exclaimed the captain.</p>

  <p>Jarvis turned to Leroy. "Can you describe it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The biologist waved helpless hands, "<i>C'est impossible!</i>" he
  whispered. "<i>Il me rend muet!</i>"</p>

  <p>"It strikes me dumb, too," muttered Jarvis. "I don't know how to tell it;
  I'm a chemist, not a poet. Paradise is as good a word as I can think of, and
  that's not at all right. It was Paradise and Hell in one!"</p>

  <p>"Will you talk sense?" growled Harrison.</p>

  <p>"As much of it as makes sense. I tell you, one moment we were looking at a
  gray valley covered with blobby plants, and the next&mdash;Lord! You can't
  imagine that next moment! How I would you like to see all your dreams made
  real? Every desire you'd ever had gratified? Everything you'd ever wanted
  there for the taking?"</p>

  <p>"I'd like it fine!" said the captain.</p>

  <p>"You're welcome, then!&mdash;not only your noble desires, remember! Every
  good impulse, yes&mdash;but also every nasty little wish, every vicious
  thought, everything you'd ever desired, good or bad! The dream-beasts are
  marvelous salesmen, but they lack the moral sense!"</p>

  <p>"The dream-beasts?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. It was a valley of them. Hundreds, I suppose, maybe thousands.
  Enough, at any rate, to spread out a complete picture of your desires, even
  all the forgotten ones that must have been out of the subconscious. A
  Paradise&mdash;of sorts. I saw a dozen Fancy Longs, in every costume I'd ever
  admired on her, and some I must have imagined. I saw every beautiful woman
  I've ever known, and all of them pleading for my attention. I saw every
  lovely place I'd ever wanted to be, all packed queerly into that little
  valley. And I saw other things." He shook his head soberly. "It wasn't all
  exactly pretty. Lord! How much of the beast is left in us! I suppose if every
  man alive could have one look at that weird valley, and could see just once
  what nastiness is hidden in him&mdash;well, the world might gain by it. I
  thanked heaven afterwards that Leroy&mdash;and even Tweel&mdash;saw their own
  pictures and not mine!"</p>

  <p>Jarvis paused again, then resumed, "I turned dizzy with a sort of ecstasy.
  I closed my eyes&mdash;and with eyes closed, I still saw the whole thing!
  That beautiful, evil, devilish panorama was in my mind, not my eyes. That's
  how those fiends work&mdash;through the mind. I knew it was the dream-beasts;
  I didn't need Tweel's wail of 'No breet!' No breet!' But &mdash;<i>I couldn't
  keep away!</i> I knew it was death beckoning, but it was worth it for one
  moment with the vision."</p>

  <p>"Which particular vision?" asked Harrison dryly.</p>

  <p>Jarvis flushed. "No matter," he said. "But beside me I heard Leroy's cry
  of 'Yvonne! Yvonne!' and I knew he was trapped like myself. I fought for
  sanity; I kept telling myself to stop, and all the time I was rushing
  headlong into the snare!</p>

  <p>"Then something tripped me. Tweel! He had come leaping from behind; as I
  crashed down I saw him flash over me straight toward&mdash;toward what I'd
  been running to, with his vicious beak pointed right at her heart!"</p>

  <p>"Oh!" nodded the captain. "<i>Her heart!</i>"</p>

  <p>"Never mind that. When I scrambled up, that particular image was gone, and
  Tweel was in a twist of black ropey arms, just as when I first saw him. He'd
  missed a vital point in the beast's anatomy, but was jabbing away desperately
  with his beak.</p>

  <p>"Somehow, the spell had lifted, or partially lifted. I wasn't five feet
  from Tweel, and it took a terrific struggle, but I managed to raise my
  revolver and put a Boland shell into the beast. Out came a spurt of horrible
  black corruption, drenching Tweel and me&mdash;and I guess the sickening
  smell of it helped to destroy the illusion of that valley of beauty. Anyway,
  we managed to get Leroy away from the devil that had him, and the three of us
  staggered to the ridge and over. I had presence of mind enough to raise my
  camera over the crest and take a shot of the valley, but I'll bet it shows
  nothing but gray waste and writhing horrors. What we saw was with our minds,
  not our eyes."</p>

  <p>Jarvis paused and shuddered. "The brute half poisoned Leroy," he
  continued. "We dragged ourselves back to the auxiliary, called you, and did
  what we could to treat ourselves. Leroy took a long dose of the cognac that
  we had with us; we didn't dare try anything of Tweel's because his metabolism
  is so different from ours that what cured him might kill us. But the cognac
  seemed to work, and so, after I'd done one other thing I wanted to do, we
  came back here&mdash;and that's all."</p>

  <p>"All, is it?" queried Harrison. "So you've solved all the mysteries of
  Mars, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Not by a damned sight!" retorted Jarvis. "Plenty of unanswered questions
  are left."</p>

  <p>"<i>Ja!</i>" snapped Putz. "Der evaporation&mdash;dot iss shtopped
  how?"</p>

  <p>"In the canals? I wondered about that, too; in those thousands of miles,
  and against this low air pressure, you'd think they'd lose a lot. But the
  answer's simple; they float a skin of oil on the water."</p>

  <p>Putz nodded, but Harrison cut in. "Here's a puzzler. With only coal and
  oil&mdash;just combustion or electric power&mdash;where'd they get the energy
  to build a planet-wide canal system, thousands and thousands of miles of 'em?
  Think of the job we had cutting the Panama Canal to sea level, and then
  answer that!"</p>

  <p>"Easy!" grinned Jarvis. "Martian gravity and Martian air&mdash;that's the
  answer. Figure it out: First, the dirt they dug only weighed a third its
  earth-weight. Second, a steam engine here expands against ten pounds per
  square inch less air pressure than on earth. Third, they could build the
  engine three times as large here with no greater internal weight. And fourth,
  the whole planet's nearly level. Right, Putz?"</p>

  <p>The engineer nodded. "<i>Ja!</i> Der shteam-engine&mdash;it <i>iss
  siebenund-zwanzig</i>&mdash;twenty-seven times so effective here."</p>

  <p>"Well, there, does go the last mystery then," mused Harrison.</p>

  <p>"Yeah?" queried Jarvis sardonically. "You answer these, then. What was the
  nature of that vast empty city? Why do the Martians <i>need</i> canals, since
  we never saw them eat or drink? Did they really visit the earth before the
  dawn of history, and, if not atomic energy, what powered their ship? Since
  Tweel's race seems to need little or no water, are they merely operating the
  canals for some higher creature that does? Are there other intelligences on
  Mars? If not, what was the demon-faced imp we saw with the book? There are a
  few mysteries for you!"</p>

  <p>"I know one or two more!" growled Harrison, glaring suddenly at little
  Leroy. "You and your visions! 'Yvonne!' eh? Your wife's name is Marie, isn't
  it?"</p>

  <p>The little biologist turned crimson. "<i>Oui</i>," he admitted unhappily.
  He turned pleading eyes on the captain. "Please," he said. "In Paris <i>tout
  le monde</i>&mdash;everybody he think differently of those things&mdash;no?"
  He twisted uncomfortably. "Please you will not tell Marie, <i>n'est-ce
  pas?</i>"</p>

  <p>Harrison chuckled. "None of my business," he said. "One more question,
  Jarvis. What was the one other thing you did before returning here?"</p>

  <p>Jarvis looked diffident. "Oh&mdash;that." He hesitated. "Well I sort of
  felt we owed Tweel a lot, so after some trouble, we coaxed him into the
  rocket and sailed him out to the wreck of the first one, over on Thyle II.
  Then," he finished apologetically, "I showed him the atomic blast, got it
  working&mdash;and gave it to him!"</p>

  <p>"You <i>what?</i>" roared the Captain. "You turned something as powerful
  as that over to an alien race&mdash;maybe some day an enemy race?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I did," said Jarvis. "Look here," he argued defensively. "This
  lousy, dried-up pill of a desert called Mars'll never support much human
  population. The Sahara desert is just as good a field for imperialism, and a
  lot closer to home. So we'll never find Tweel's race enemies. The only value
  we'll find here is commercial trade with the Martians. Then why shouldn't I
  give Tweel a chance for survival? With atomic energy, they can run their
  canal system a hundred per cent instead of only one out of five, as Putz's
  observations showed. They can repopulate those ghostly cities; they can
  resume their arts and industries; they can trade with the nations of the
  earth&mdash;and I'll bet they can teach us a few things," he paused, "if they
  can figure out the atomic blast, and I'll lay odds they can. They're no
  fools, Tweel and his ostrich-faced Martians!"</p>
