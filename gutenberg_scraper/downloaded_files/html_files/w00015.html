<p>Several letters were handed into my study, where I sat at work among
my books.</p>

<p>I was then pastor of a Church in the city of Hamilton. Showers of
blessing had been descending upon us, and over a hundred and forty new
members had but recently been received into the Church. I had availed
myself of the Christmas holidays by getting married, and now was back
again with my beloved, when these letters were handed in. With only one
of them have we at present anything to do. As near as I can remember, it
read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><br>
 &ldquo;Mission Rooms, Toronto, 1868.<br>
<br>
 &ldquo;Rev. Egerton R. Young.<br>
<br>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Brother, &mdash; At a large and influential meeting of the
Missionary Committee, held yesterday, it was unanimously decided to ask
you to go as a missionary to the Indian tribes at Norway House, and in
the North-West Territories north of Lake Winnipeg. An early answer
signifying your acceptance of this will much oblige,</p>

<br>
 &ldquo;Yours affectionately,<br>
<br>
 &ldquo;E. Wood,<br>
<br>
 &ldquo;L. Taylor.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
</blockquote>

<p>I read the letter, and then handed it, without comment, across the
table to Mrs Young &mdash; the bride of but a few days &mdash; for her
perusal. She read it over carefully, and then, after a quiet moment, as
was quite natural, asked, &ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; &ldquo;I can
hardly tell,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;but it is evident that it means a
good deal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you volunteered to go as a missionary to that far-off
land?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, no. Much as I love, and deeply interested as I have ever
been in the missionary work of our Church, I have not made the first move
in this direction. Years ago I used to think I would love to go to a
foreign field, but lately, as the Lord has been so blessing us here in
the home work, and has given us such a glorious revival, I should have
thought it like running away from duty to have volunteered for any other
field.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, here is this letter; what are you going to do about
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is just what I would like to know,&rdquo; was my
answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is one thing we can do,&rdquo; she said quietly; and we
bowed ourselves in prayer, and &ldquo;spread the letter before the
Lord,&rdquo; and asked for wisdom to guide us aright in this important
matter which had so suddenly come upon us, and which, if carried out,
would completely change all the plans and purposes which we, the young
married couple, in all the joyousness of our honeymoon, had just been
marking out. We earnestly prayed for Divine light and guidance to be so
clearly revealed that we could not be mistaken as to our duty.</p>

<p>As we arose from our knees, I quietly said to Mrs Young, &ldquo;Have
you any impression on your mind as to our duty in this matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her eyes were suffused in tears, but the voice, though low, was firm,
as she replied, &ldquo;The call has come very unexpectedly, but I think
it is from God, and we will go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My Church and its kind officials strongly opposed my leaving them,
especially at such a time as this, when, they said, so many new converts,
through my instrumentality, had been brought into the Church.</p>

<p>I consulted my beloved ministerial brethren in the city, and with but
one exception the reply was, &ldquo;Remain at your present station, where
God has so abundantly blessed your labours.&rdquo; The answer of the one
brother who did not join in with the others has never been forgotten. As
it may do good, I will put it on record. When I showed him the letter,
and asked what I should do in reference to it, he, much to my surprise,
became deeply agitated, and wept like a child. When he could control his
emotions, he said, &ldquo;For my answer let me give you a little of my
history.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Years ago, I was very happily situated in the ministry in the
Old Land. I loved my work, my home, and my wife passionately. I had the
confidence and esteem of my people, and thought I was as happy as I could
be this side (of) heaven. One day there came a letter from the Wesleyan
Mission Rooms in London, asking if I would go out as a missionary to the
West Indies. Without consideration, and without making it a matter of
prayer, I at once sent back a positive refusal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From that day,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;everything went
wrong with me. Heaven's smile seemed to have left me. I lost my grip upon
my people. My influence for good over them left me, I could not tell how.
My once happy home was blasted, and in all my trouble I got no sympathy
from my Church or in the community. I had to resign my position, and
leave the place. I fell into darkness, and lost my hold upon God. A few
years ago I came out to this country. God has restored me to the light of
His countenance. The Church has been very sympathetic and indulgent. For
years I have been permitted to labour in her fold, and for this I
rejoice. But,&rdquo; he added, with emphasis, &ldquo;I long ago came to
the resolve that if ever the Church asked me to go to the West Indies, or
to any other Mission field, I would be careful about sending back an
abrupt refusal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I pondered over his words and his experience, and talked about them
with my good wife, and we decided to go. Our loving friends were startled
at our resolve, but soon gave us their benedictions, united to tangible
evidences of their regard. A blessed peace filled our souls, and we
longed to be away and at work in the new field which had so suddenly
opened before us.</p>

<blockquote><br>
 &ldquo;Yes, we will go. We may no longer doubt<br>
 To give up friends, and home, and every tie,<br>
 That binds our heart to thee, our country.<br>
                                                 Henceforth, then,<br>
 It matters not if storms or sunshine be<br>
 Our earthly lot, bitter or sweet our cup.<br>
 We only pray, God fit us for the work,<br>
 God make us holy, and our spirits nerve<br>
 For the stern hour of strife. Let us but know<br>
 There is an Arm unseen that holds us up,<br>
 An Eye that kindly watches all our path,<br>
 Till we our weary pilgrimage have done.<br>
 Let us but know we have a Friend that waits<br>
 To welcome us to glory, and we joy<br>
 To tread that drear and northern wilderness.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
</blockquote>

<p>The grand valedictory services were held in the old Richmond Street
Church, Toronto, Thursday, May 7th, 1868. The church was crowded, and the
enthusiasm was very great. The honoured President of the Conference for
that year, the Rev. James Elliott, who presided, was the one who had
ordained me a few months before. Many were the speakers. Among them was
the Rev. George McDougall, who already had had a varied experience of
missionary life. He had something to talk about, to which it was worth
listening. The Rev. George Young, also, had much that was interesting to
say, as he was there bidding farewell to his own Church and to the
people, of whom he had long been the beloved pastor. Dr. Punshon, who had
just arrived from England, was present, and gave one of his inimitable
magnetic addresses. The memory of his loving, cheering words abode with
us for many a day.</p>

<p>It was also a great joy to us that my honoured father, the Rev.
William Young, was with us on the platform at this impressive farewell
service. For many years he had been one of that heroic band of pioneer
ministers in Canada who had laid so grandly and well the foundations of
the Church which, with others, had contributed so much to the spiritual
development of the country. His benedictions and blessings were among the
prized favours in these eventful hours in our new career.</p>

<p>My father had been intimately acquainted with William Case and James
Evans, and at times had been partially associated with them in Indian
evangelisation. He had faith in the power of the Gospel to save even
Indians, and now rejoiced that he had a son and daughter who had
consecrated themselves to this work.</p>

<p>As a long journey of many hundreds of miles would have to be made by
us after getting beyond cars or steamboats in the Western States, it was
decided that we should take our own horses and canvas-covered waggons
from Ontario with us. We arranged to make Hamilton our starting-point;
and on Monday, the 11th of May, 1868, our little company filed out of
that city towards St. Catherine's, where we were to take passage in a
&ldquo;propeller&rdquo; for Milwaukee. Thus our adventurous journey was
begun.</p>

<p>The following was our party. First, the Rev. George McDougall, who for
years had been successfully doing the work of a faithful missionary among
the Indians in the distant Saskatchewan country, a thousand miles
north-west of the Red River country. He had come down to Canada for
reinforcements for the work, and had not failed in his efforts to secure
them. As he was an old, experienced Western traveller, he was the guide
of the party.</p>

<p>Next was the Rev. George Young, with his wife and son. Dr. Young had
consented to go and begin the work in the Red River Settlement, a place
where Methodism had never before had a footing. Grandly and well did he
succeed in his efforts.</p>

<p>Next came the genial Rev. Peter Campbell, who, with his brave wife and
two little girls, relinquished a pleasant Circuit to go to the distant
Mission field among the Indians of the North-West prairies. We had also
with us two Messrs. Snyders, brothers of Mrs Campbell, who had
consecrated themselves to the work as teachers among the distant Indian
tribes. Several other young men were in our party, and in Dacota we were
joined by &ldquo;Joe&rdquo; and &ldquo;Job,&rdquo; a couple of young
Indians.</p>

<p>These, with the writer and his wife, constituted our party of fifteen
or twenty. At St. Catherine's on the Welland Canal we shipped our outfit,
and took passage on board the steamer <i>Empire</i> for Milwaukee.</p>

<p>The vessel was very much crowded, and there was a good deal of
discomfort. In passing through Lake Michigan we encountered rough
weather, and, as a natural result, sea-sickness assailed the great
majority of our party.</p>

<p>We reached Milwaukee on Sabbath, the 17th of May. We found it then a
lively, wide-awake Americo-German city. There did not seem to be, on the
part of the multitudes whom we met, much respect for the Sabbath.
Business was in full blast in many of the streets, and there were but few
evidences that it was the day of rest. Doubtless there were many who had
not defiled their garments and had not profaned the day, but we weary
travellers had not then time to find them out.</p>

<p>Although we had taken the precaution to bond everything through to the
North-West, and had the American Consular certificate to the effect that
every regulation had been complied with, we were subjected to many
vexatious delays and expenses by the Custom House officials. So delayed
were we that we had to telegraph to head-quarters at Washington about the
matter and soon there came the orders to the over-officious officials to
at once allow us to proceed. Two valuable days, however, had been lost by
their obstructiveness. Why cannot Canada and the United States, lying
side by side, from the Atlantic to the Pacific, devise some mutually
advantageous scheme of reciprocity, by which the vexatious delays and
annoyances and expense of these Custom Houses can be done away with?</p>

<p>We left Milwaukee for La Crosse on the Mississippi on Tuesday evening
at eight o'clock. At La Crosse we embarked on the steamer<i>Milwaukee</i>
for St. Paul's. These large flat-bottomed steamers are quite an
institution on these western rivers. Drawing but a few inches of water,
they glide over sandbars where the water is very shallow, and, swinging
in against the shore, land and receive passengers and freight where
wharves are unknown, or where, if they existed, they would be liable to
be swept away in the great spring freshets.</p>

<p>The scenery in many places along the upper Mississippi is very fine.
High bold bluffs rise up in wondrous variety and picturesque beauty. In
some places they are composed of naked rock. Others are covered to their
very summit with the richest green. Here, a few years ago, the war-whoop
of the Indians sounded, and the buffalo swarmed around these Buttes, and
quenched their thirst in these waters. Now the shrill whistle of the
steamer disturbs the solitudes, and echoes and re-echoes with wondrous
distinctness among the high bluffs and fertile vales.</p>

<blockquote><br>
 &ldquo;Westward the Star of Empire takes its way.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
</blockquote>

<p>We arrived at St. Paul's on Thursday forenoon and found it to be a
stirring city, beautifully situated on the eastern side of the
Mississippi. We had several hours of good hard work in getting our
caravan in order, purchasing supplies, and making all final arrangements
for the long journey that was before us. For beyond this the iron horse
had not yet penetrated, and the great surging waves of immigration, which
soon after rolled over into those fertile territories, had as yet been
only little ripples.</p>

<p>Our splendid horses, which had been cooped up in the holds of vessels,
or cramped up in uncomfortable freight cars, were now to have an
opportunity for exercising their limbs, and showing of what mettle they
were made. At 4 p.m. we filed out of the city. The recollection of that
first ride on the prairie will live on as long as memory holds her
throne. The day was one of those gloriously perfect ones that are but
rarely given us, as if to show what earth must have been before the Fall.
The sky, the air, the landscape &mdash; everything seemed in such harmony
and so perfect, that involuntarily I exclaimed, &ldquo;If God's footstool
is so glorious, what will the throne be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>We journeyed a few miles, then encamped for the night. We were all in
the best of spirits, and seemed to rejoice that we were getting away from
civilisation, and more and more out into the wilderness, although for
days we were in the vicinity of frontier villages and settlements, which,
however, as we journeyed on, were rapidly diminishing in number.</p>

<p>After several days' travelling we encamped on the western side of the
Mississippi, near where the thriving town of Clear Water now stands. As
some of our carts and travelling equipage had begun to show signs of
weakness, it was thought prudent to give everything a thorough
overhauling ere we pushed out from this point, as beyond this there was
no place where assistance could be obtained. We had in our encampment
eight tents, fourteen horses, and from fifteen to twenty persons,
counting big and little, whites and Indians. Whenever we camped our
horses were turned loose in the luxuriant prairie grass, the only
precaution taken being to &ldquo;hobble&rdquo; them, as the work of tying
their forefeet together is called. It seemed a little cruel at first, and
some of our spirited horses resented it, and struggled a good deal
against it as an infringement on their liberties. But they soon became
used to it, and it served the good purpose we had in view &mdash; namely,
that of keeping them from straying far away from the camp during the
night.</p>

<p>At one place, where we were obliged to stop for a few days to repair
broken axle-trees, I passed through an adventure that will not soon be
forgotten. Some friendly settlers came to our camp, and gave us the
unpleasant information, that a number of notorious horse-thieves were
prowling around, and it would be advisable for us to keep a sharp
look-out on our splendid Canadian horses. As there was an isolated barn
about half a mile or so from the camp, that had been put up by a settler
who would not require it until harvest, we obtained permission to use it
as a place in which to keep our horses during the nights while we were
detained in the settlement. Two of our party were detailed each night to
act as a guard. One evening, as Dr. Young's son George and I, who had
been selected for this duty, were about starting from the camp for our
post, I overheard our old veteran guide, the Rev. George McDougall, say,
in a bantering sort of way, &ldquo;Pretty guards they are! Why, some of
my Indian boys could go and steal every horse from them without the
slightest trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stung to the quick by the remark, I replied, &ldquo;Mr McDougall, I
think I have the best horse in the company; but if you or any of your
Indians can steal him out of that barn between sundown and sunrise, you
may keep him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>We tethered the horses in a line, and fastened securely all the doors
but the large front one. We arranged our seats where we were partially
concealed, but where we could see our horses, and could command every
door with our rifles. In quiet tones we chatted about various things,
until about one o'clock, when all became hushed and still. The novelty of
the situation impressed me, and, sitting there in the darkness, I could
not help contrasting my present position with the one I had occupied a
few weeks before. Then the pastor of a city Church, in the midst of a
blessed revival, surrounded by all the comforts of civilisation; now out
here in Minnesota, in this barn, sitting on a bundle of prairie grass
through the long hours of night with a breech-loading rifle in hand,
guarding a number of horses from a band of horse-thieves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush! what is that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A hand is surely on the door feeling for the wooden latch. We mentally
say, &ldquo;You have made too much noise, Mr Thief, for your purpose, and
you are discovered.&rdquo; Soon the door opened a little. As it was a
beautiful starlight night, the form of a tall man was plainly visible in
the opening. Covering him with my rifle, and about to fire, quick as a
flash came the thought, &ldquo;Better be sure that that man is a
horse-thief, or is intent on evil, ere you fire; for it is at any time a
serious thing to send a soul so suddenly into eternity.&rdquo; So keeping
my rifle to my shoulder, I shouted out, &ldquo;Who's there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it's only your friend Matthew,&rdquo; said our tall
friend, as he came stumbling along in the darkness; &ldquo;queer if you
don't know me by this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the thought came to me of how near I had been to sending him into
the other world, a strange feeling of faintness came over me, and,
flinging my rifle from me, I sank back trembling like a leaf.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the good-natured fellow, little knowing the risk he had run,
and not seeing the effect his thoughtless action had produced on me,
talked on, saying that as it was so hot and close over at the tents that
he could not sleep there, he thought he would come over and stop with us
in the barn.</p>

<p>There was considerable excitement, and some strong words were uttered
at the camp next morning at his breach of orders and narrow escape, since
instructions had been given to all that none should, under any
consideration, go near the barn while it was being guarded.</p>

<p>At another place in Minnesota we came across a party who were
restoring their homes, and &ldquo;building up their waste places&rdquo;
desolated by the terrible Sioux wars of but a short time before. As they
had nearly all of them suffered by that fearful struggle, they were very
bitter in their feelings towards the Indians, completely ignoring the
fact that the whites were to blame for that last sanguinary outbreak, in
which nine hundred lives were lost, and a section of country larger than
some of the New England States was laid desolate. It is now an undisputed
fact that the greed and dishonesty of the Indian agents of the United
States caused that terrible war of 1863. The principal agent received
$600,000 in gold from the Government, which belonged to the Indians, and
was to be paid to Little Crow and the other chiefs and members of the
tribe. The agent took advantage of the premium on gold, which in those
days was very high, and exchanged the gold for greenbacks, and with these
paid the Indians, putting the enormous difference in his own pocket. When
the payments began, Little Crow, who knew what he had a right to
according to the Treaty, said, &ldquo;Gold dollars worth more than paper
dollars. You pay us gold.&rdquo; The agent refused, and the war followed.
This is only one instance out of scores, in which the greed and
selfishness of a few have plunged the country into war, causing the loss
of hundreds of lives and millions of treasure.</p>

<p>In addition to this, these same unprincipled agents, with their hired
accomplices and subsidised press, in order to hide the enormity of their
crimes, and to divert attention from themselves and their crookedness,
systematically and incessantly misrepresent and vilify the Indian
character.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay and be our minister,&rdquo; said some of these settlers to
me in one place. &ldquo;We'll secure for you a good location, and will
help you get in some crops, and will do the best we can to make you
comfortable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When they saw we were all proof against their appeals, they changed
their tactics, and one exclaimed, &ldquo;You'll never get through the
Indian country north with those fine horses and all that fine truck you
have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O yes, we will,&rdquo; said Mr McDougall; &ldquo;we have a
little flag that will carry us in safety through any Indian tribe in
America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They doubted the assertion very much, but we found it to be literally
true, at all events as regarded the Sioux; for when, a few days later, we
met them, our Union Jack fluttering from the whip-stalk caused them to
fling their guns in the grass, and come crowding round us with extended
hands, saying, through those who understood their language, that they
were glad to see and shake hands with the subjects of the &ldquo;Great
Mother&rdquo; across the waters.</p>

<p>When we, in our journey north, reached their country, and saw them
coming down upon us, at Mr McDougall's orders we stowed away our rifles
and revolvers inside of our waggons, and met them as friends, unarmed and
fearless. They smoked the pipe of peace with those of our party who could
use the weed, and others drank tea with the rest of us. As we were in
profound ignorance of their language, and they of ours, some of us had
not much conversation with them beyond what could be carried on by a few
signs. But, through Mr McDougall and our own Indians, they assured us of
their friendship.</p>

<p>We pitched our tents, hobbled our horses and turned them loose, as
usual. We cooked our evening meals, said our prayers, unrolled our
camp-beds, and lay down to rest without earthly sentinels or guards
around us, although the camp-fires of these so-called &ldquo;treacherous
and bloodthirsty&rdquo; Sioux could be seen in the distance, and we knew
their sharp eyes were upon us. Yet we lay down and slept in peace, and
arose in safety. Nothing was disturbed or stolen.</p>

<p>So much for a clean record of honourable dealing with a people who,
while quick to resent when provoked, are mindful of kindnesses received,
and are as faithful to their promises and treaty obligations, as are any
other of the races of the world.</p>

<p>We were thirty days in making the trip from St. Paul's to the Red
River settlement. We had to ford a large number of bridgeless streams.
Some of them took us three or four days to get our whole party across. We
not unfrequently had some of our waggons stuck in the quicksands, or so
sunk in the quagmires that the combined strength of all the men of our
party was required to get them out. Often the ladies of our company, with
shoes and stockings off, would be seen bravely wading across wide
streams, where now in luxurious comfort, in parlour cars, travellers are
whirled along at the rate of forty miles an hour. They were a cheerful,
brave band of pioneers.</p>

<p>The weather, on the whole, was pleasant, but we had some drenching
rain-storms; and then the spirits of some of the party went down, and
they wondered whatever possessed them to leave their happy homes for such
exile and wretchedness as this. There was one fearful, tornado-like storm
that assailed us when we were encamped for the night on the western bank
of Red River. Tents were instantly blown down. Heavy waggons were driven
before it, and for a time confusion reigned supreme. Fortunately nobody
was hurt, and most of the things blown away were recovered the next
day.</p>

<p>Our Sabbaths were days of quiet rest and delightful communion with
God. Together we worshipped Him Who dwelleth not in temples made with
hands. Many were the precious communions we had with Him Who had been our
Comforter and our Refuge under other circumstances, and Who, having now
called us to this new work and novel life, was sweetly fulfilling in us
the blessed promise: &ldquo;Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of
the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At Fort Garry in the Red River settlement, now the flourishing city of
Winnipeg, our party, which had so long travelled together, broke up with
mutual regrets. The Rev. George Young and his family remained to commence
the first Methodist Mission in that place. Many were his discouragements
and difficulties, but glorious have been his successes. More to him than
to any other man is due the prominent position which the Methodist Church
now occupies in the North-West. His station was one calling for rare tact
and ability. The Riel Rebellion, and the disaffection of the Half-breed
population, made his position at times one of danger and insecurity; but
he proved himself to be equal to every emergency. In addition to the many
duties devolving upon him in the establishment of the Church amidst so
many discordant elements, a great many extra cares were imposed upon him
by the isolated missionaries in the interior, who looked to him for the
purchasing and sending out to them, as best he could, of their
much-needed supplies. His kindly laborious efforts for their comfort can
never be forgotten.</p>

<p>The Revs. George McDougall and Peter Campbell, with the teachers and
other members of the party, pushed on, with their horses, waggons, and
carts, for the still farther North-West, the great North Saskatchewan
River, twelve hundred miles farther into the interior.</p>

<p>During the first part of their journey over the fertile but then
unbroken prairies, the only inhabitants they met were the roving Indians
and Half-breeds, whose rude wigwams and uncouth noisy carts have long
since disappeared, and have been replaced by the comfortable habitations
of energetic settlers, and the swiftly moving trains of the
railroads.</p>

<p>From Fort Garry Mrs Young and myself performed the rest of our journey
by water, going down the Red River to its mouth, and then along the whole
length of the stormy Lake Winnipeg, and beyond, to our own far-off
northern home. The trip was made in what is called &ldquo;the Hudson's
Bay inland boat.&rdquo; These boats are constructed like large skiffs,
only each end is sharp. They have neither deck nor cabin. They are
furnished with a mast and a large square sail, both of which are stowed
away when the wind is not favourable for sailing. They are manned by six
or eight oarsmen, and are supposed to carry about four tons of
merchandise. They can stand a rough sea, and weather very severe gales,
as we found out during our years of adventurous trips in them. When there
is no favourable wind for sailing, the stalwart boatmen push out their
heavy oars, and, bending their sturdy backs to the work, and keeping the
most perfect time, are often able to make their sixty miles a day. But
this toiling at the oar is slavish work, and the favouring gale, even if
it develops into a fierce storm, is always preferable to a dead calm.
These northern Indians make capital sailors, and in the sudden squalls
and fierce gales to which these great lakes are subject, they display
much courage and judgment.</p>

<p>Our place in the boat was in the hinder part near the steersman, a
pure Indian, whose name was Thomas Mamanowatum, familiarly known as
&ldquo;Big Tom,&rdquo; on account of his almost gigantic size. He was one
of Nature's noblemen, a grand, true man, and of him we shall have more to
say hereafter. Honoured indeed was the missionary who led such a man from
Paganism to Christianity.</p>

<p>We journeyed on pleasantly for twenty miles down the Red River to
Lower Fort Garry, where we found that we should have to wait for several
days ere the outfit for the boats would be ready. We were, however, very
courteously entertained by the Hudson's Bay officials, who showed us no
little kindness.</p>

<p>This Lower Fort Garry, or &ldquo;the Stone Fort,&rdquo; as it is
called in the country, is an extensive affair, having a massive stone
wall all around it, with the Company's buildings in the centre. It was
built in stormy times, when rival trading parties existed, and hostile
bands were ever on the war path. It is capable of resisting almost any
force that could be brought against it, unaided by artillery. We were a
little amused and very much pleased with the old-time and almost courtly
etiquette which abounded at this and the other establishments of this
flourishing Company. In those days the law of precedents was in full
force. When the bell rang, no clerk of fourteen years' standing would
think of entering before one who had been fifteen years in the service,
or of sitting above him at the table. Such a thing would have brought
down upon him the severe reproof of the senior officer in charge. Irksome
and even frivolous as some of these laws seemed, doubtless they served a
good purpose, and prevented many misunderstandings which might have
occurred.</p>

<p>Another singular custom, which we did not like, was the fact that
there were two dining-rooms in these establishments, one for the ladies,
and the other for the gentlemen of the service. It appeared to us very
odd to see the gentlemen with the greatest politeness escort the ladies
into the hall which ran between the two dining-rooms, and then gravely
turn to the left, while the ladies all filed off into the room on the
right. As the arrangement was so contrary to all our ideas and education
on the subject, we presumed to question it; but the only satisfaction we
could get in reference to it was, that it was one of their old customs,
and had worked well. One old crusty bachelor official said, &ldquo;We do
not want the women around us when we are discussing our business matters,
which we wish to keep to ourselves. If they were present, all our schemes
and plans would soon be known to all, and our trade might be much
injured.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Throughout this vast country, until very lately, the adventurous
traveller, whose courage or curiosity was sufficient to enable him to
brave the hardships or run the risks of exploring these enormous
territories, was entirely dependent upon the goodwill and hospitality of
the officials of the Hudson's Bay Company. They were uniformly treated
with courtesy and hospitably entertained.</p>

<p>Very isolated are some of these inland posts, and quite expatriated
are the inmates for years at a time. These lonely establishments are to
be found scattered all over the upper half of this great American
Continent. They have each a population of from five to sixty human
beings. These are, if possible, placed in favourable localities for fish
or game, but often from one to five hundred miles apart. The only object
of their erection and occupancy is to exchange the products of
civilisation for the rich and valuable furs which are to be obtained here
as nowhere else in the world. In many instances the inmates hear from the
outside world but twice, and at times but once, in twelve months. Then
the arrival of the packet is the great event of the year.</p>

<p>We spent a very pleasant Sabbath at Lower Fort Garry, and I preached
in the largest dining-room to a very attentive congregation, composed of
the officials and servants of the Company, with several visitors, and
also some Half-breeds and Indians who happened to be at the fort at that
time.</p>

<p>The next day two boats were ready, and we embarked on our adventurous
journey for our far-off, isolated home beyond the northern end of Lake
Winnipeg. The trip down Red River was very pleasant. We passed through
the flourishing Indian Settlement, where the Church of England has a
successful Mission among the Indians. We admired their substantial church
and comfortable homes, and saw in them, and in the farms, tangible
evidence of the power of Christian Missions to elevate and bless those
who come under their ennobling influences. The cosy residence of the
Venerable Archdeacon Cowley was pointed out to us, beautifully embowered
among the trees. He was a man beloved of all; a life-long friend of the
Indians, and one who was as an angel of mercy to us in after years when
our Nellie died, while Mrs Young was making an adventurous journey in an
open boat on the stormy, treacherous Lake Winnipeg.</p>

<p>This sad event occurred when, after five years' residence among the
Crees at Norway House, we had instructions from our missionary
authorities to go and open up a new Indian Mission among the then pagan
Salteaux. I had orders to remain at Norway House until my successor
arrived; and as but one opportunity was offered for Mrs Young and the
children to travel in those days of limited opportunities, they started
on several weeks ahead in an open skiff manned by a few Indians, leaving
me to follow in a birch canoe. So terrible was the heat that hot July, in
that open boat with no deck or awning, that the beautiful child sickened
and died of brain-fever. Mrs Young found herself with her dying child on
the banks of Red River, all alone among her sorrowing Indian boatmen,
&ldquo;a stranger in a strange land;&rdquo; no home to which to go; no
friends to sympathise with her. Fortunately for her, the Hudson's Bay
officials at Lower Fort Garry were made aware of her sorrows, and
received her into one of their homes ere the child died. The Rev. Mr
Cowley also came and prayed for her, and sympathised with her on the loss
of her beautiful child.</p>

<p>As I was far away when Nellie died, Mrs Young knew not what to do with
our precious dead. A temporary grave was made, and in it the body was
laid until I could be communicated with, and arrangements could be made
for its permanent interment. I wrote at once by an Indian to the
Venerable Archdeacon Cowley, asking permission to bury our dead in his
graveyard; and there came promptly back, by the canoe, a very brotherly,
sympathetic letter, ending up with, &ldquo;Our graveyards are open before
you; 'in the choicest of our sepulchres bury thy dead.'&ldquo; A few
weeks after, when I had handed over my Mission to Brother Ruttan, I
hurried on to the settlement, and with a few sympathising friends, mostly
Indians, we took up the little body from its temporary resting-place, and
buried it in the St. Peter's Church graveyard, the dear archdeacon
himself being present, and reading the beautiful Burial Service of his
Church. That land to us has been doubly precious since it has become the
repository of our darling child.</p>

<p>As we floated down the current, or were propelled along by the oars of
our Indian boatmen, on that first journey, little did we imagine that
this sad episode in our lives would happen in that very spot a few years
after. When we were near the end of the Indian Settlement, as it is
called, we saw several Indians on the bank, holding on to a couple of
oxen. Our boats were immediately turned in to the shore near them, and,
to our great astonishment, we found out that each boat was to have an
addition to its passenger list in the shape of one of these big fellows.
The getting of these animals shipped was no easy matter, as there was no
wharf or gangway; but after a good deal of pulling and pushing, and
lifting up of one leg, and then another, the patient brutes were embarked
on the frail crafts, to be our companions during the voyage to Norway
House. The position assigned to the one in our boat was just in front of
us, &ldquo;broadside on,&rdquo; as the sailors would say; his head often
hanging over one side of the boat, and his tail over the other side. The
only partition there was between him and us was a single board a few
inches wide. Such close proximity to this animal for fourteen days was
not very agreeable; but as it could not be helped it had to be
endured.</p>

<p>At times, during the first few days, the ox made some desperate
efforts to break loose; and it seemed as though he would either smash our
boat to pieces or upset it; but, finding his efforts unsuccessful, he
gracefully accepted the situation, and behaved himself admirably. When
storms arose he quietly lay down, and served as so much ballast to steady
the boat. &ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; the guide, kept him well supplied with food
from the rich nutritious grasses which grew abundantly along the shore at
our different camping-places.</p>

<p>Winnipeg is considered one of the stormiest lakes on the American
Continent. It is about three hundred miles long, and varies from eighty
to but a few miles in width. It is indented with innumerable bays, and is
dangerous to navigators, on account of its many shoals and hidden rocks.
<i>Winnipeg</i>, or <i>Wenip&aacute;k</i>, as some Indians pronounce it,
means &ldquo;the sea,&rdquo; and <i>Keche Wenip&aacute;k</i> means
&ldquo;the ocean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The trip across Lake Winnipeg was one that at the present day would be
considered a great hardship, taking into consideration the style of the
boat and the way we travelled.</p>

<p>Our method of procedure was about as follows. We were aroused very
early in the morning by the guide's cry of <i>Koos koos kwa</i>!
&ldquo;Wake up!&rdquo; Everybody was expected to obey promptly, as there
was always a good deal of rivalry between the boats as to which could get
away first. A hasty breakfast was prepared on the rocks; after which a
morning hymn was sung, and an earnest prayer was offered up to Him Who
holds the winds and waves under His control.</p>

<p>Then &ldquo;All aboard&rdquo; was the cry, and soon tents, kettles,
axes, and all the other things were hurriedly gathered up and placed on
board. If the wind was favourable, the mast was put up, the sail hoisted,
and we were soon rapidly speeding on our way. If the oars had to be used,
there was not half the alacrity displayed by the poor fellows, who well
knew how wearisome their task would be. When we had a favourable wind, we
generally dined as well as we could in the boat, to save time, as the
rowers well knew how much more pleasant it was to glide along with the
favouring breeze than to be obliged to work at the heavy oars. Often
during whole nights we sailed on, although at considerable risks in that
treacherous lake, rather than lose the fair wind. For, if there ever was,
in this world of uncertainties, one route of more uncertainty than
another, the palm must be conceded to the voyages on Lake Winnipeg in
those Hudson's Bay Company's inland boats. You might make the trip in
four days, or even a few hours less; and you might be thirty days, and a
few hours over.</p>

<p>Once, in after years, I was detained for six days on a little rocky
islet by a fierce northern gale, which at times blew with such force that
we could not keep up a tent or even stand upright against its fury; and
as there was not sufficient soil in which to drive a tent pin, we, with
all our bedding and supplies, were drenched by the pitiless sleet and
rain. Often in these later years, when I have heard people, sitting in
the comfortable waiting-room of a railway station, bitterly complaining
because a train was an hour or two late, memory has carried me back to
some of those long detentions amidst the most disagreeable surroundings,
and I have wondered at the trifles which can upset the equanimity of some
or cause them to show such fretfulness.</p>

<p>When the weather was fine, the camping on the shore was very
enjoyable. Our tent was quickly erected by willing hands; the camp fire
was kindled, and glowed with increasing brightness as the shadows of
night fell around us. The evening meal was soon prepared, and an hour or
two would sometimes be spent in pleasant converse with our dusky friends,
who were most delightful travelling companions. Our days always began and
closed with a religious service. All of our Indian companions in the two
boats on this first trip were Christians, in the best and truest sense of
the word. They were the converts of the earlier missionaries of our
Church. At first they were a little reserved, and acted as though they
imagined we expected them to be very sedate and dignified. For, like some
white folks, they imagined the &ldquo;black-coat&rdquo; and his wife did
not believe in laughter or pleasantry. However, we soon disabused their
minds of those erroneous ideas, and before we reached Norway House we
were on the best of terms with each other. We knew but little of their
language, but some of them had a good idea of English, and, using these
as our interpreters, we got along finely.</p>

<p>They were well furnished with Testaments and hymn-books, printed in
the beautiful syllabic characters; and they used them well. This
worshipping with a people who used to us an unknown tongue was at first
rather novel; but it attracted and charmed us at once. We were forcibly
struck with the reverential manner in which they conducted their
devotions. No levity or indifference marred the solemnity of their
religious services. They listened very attentively while one of their
number read to them from the sacred Word, and gave the closest attention
to what I had to say, through an interpreter.</p>

<p>Very sweetly and soothingly sounded the hymns of praise and adoration
that welled up from their musical voices; and though we understood them
not, yet in their earnest prayers there seemed to be so much that was
real and genuine, as in pathetic tones they offered up their petitions,
that we felt it to be a great privilege and a source of much blessing,
when with them we bowed at the mercy-seat of our great loving Father, to
Whom all languages of earth are known, and before Whom all hearts are
open.</p>

<p>Very helpful at times to devout worship were our surroundings. As in
the ancient days, when the vast multitudes gathered around Him on the
seaside and were comforted and cheered by His presence, so we felt on
these quiet shores of the lake that we were worshipping Him Who is always
the same. At times delightful and suggestive were our environments. With
Winnipeg's sunlit waves before us, the blue sky above us, the dark, deep,
primeval forest as our background, and the massive granite rocks beneath
us, we often felt a nearness of access to Him, the Sovereign of the
universe, Who &ldquo;dwelleth not in temples made with hands,&rdquo;
&mdash; but &ldquo;Who covereth Himself with light as with a garment; Who
stretcheth out the heavens like a curtain; Who layeth the beams of His
chambers in the waters; Who maketh the clouds his chariot; Who walketh
upon the wings of the wind; Who laid the foundations of the earth, that
it should not be removed for ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our Sabbaths were days of rest. The Christian Indians had been taught
by their faithful missionaries the fourth commandment, and they kept it
well. Although far from their homes and their beloved sanctuary, they
respected the day. When they camped on Saturday night, all the necessary
preparations were made for a quiet, restful Sabbath. All the wood that
would be needed to cook the day's supplies was secured, and the food that
required cooking was prepared. Guns were stowed away, and although
sometimes ducks or other game would come near, they were not disturbed.
Generally two religious services were held and enjoyed. The Testaments
and hymn-books were well used throughout the day, and an atmosphere of
&ldquo;Paradise Regained&rdquo; seemed to pervade the place.</p>

<p>At first, long years ago, the Hudson's Bay Company's officials
bitterly opposed the observance of the Sabbath by their boatmen and
tripmen; but the missionaries were true and firm, and although
persecution for a time abounded, eventually right and truth prevailed,
and our Christian Indians were left to keep the day without molestation.
And, as has always been found to be the case in such instances, there was
no loss, but rather gain. Our Christian Indians, who rested the Sabbath
day, were never behindhand. On the long trips into the interior or down
to York Factory or Hudson Bay, these Indian canoe brigades used to make
better time, have better health, and bring up their boats and cargoes in
better shape, than the Catholic Half-breeds or pagan Indians, who pushed
on without any day of rest. Years of studying this question, judging from
the standpoint of the work accomplished and its effects on men's physical
constitution, apart altogether from its moral and religious aspect, most
conclusively taught me that the institution of the one day in seven as a
day of rest is for man's highest good.</p>

<p>Thus we journeyed on, meeting with various adventures by the way. One
evening, rather than lose the advantage of a good wind, our party
resolved to sail on throughout the night. We had no compass or chart, no
moon or fickle Auroras lit up the watery waste. Clouds, dark and heavy,
flitted by, obscuring the dim starlight, and adding to the risk and
danger of our proceeding. On account of the gloom part of the crew were
kept on the watch continually. The bowsman, with a long pole in his
hands, sat in the prow of the boat, alert and watchful. For a long time I
sat with the steersman in the stern of our little craft, enjoying this
weird way of travelling. Out of the darkness behind us into the vague
blackness before us we plunged. Sometimes through the darkness came the
sullen roar and dash of waves against the rocky isles or dangerous shore
near at hand, reminding us of the risks we were running, and what need
there was of the greatest care.</p>

<p>Our camp bed had been spread on some boards in the hinder part of our
little boat; and here Mrs Young, who for a time had enjoyed the exciting
voyage, was now fast asleep. I remained up with &ldquo;Big Tom" until
after midnight; and then, having exhausted my stock of Indian words in
conversation with him, and becoming weary, I wrapped a blanket around
myself and lay down to rest. Hardly had I reached the land of dreams,
when I was suddenly awakened by being most unceremoniously thrown, with
wife, bedding, bales, boxes, and some drowsy Indians, on one side of the
boat. We scrambled up as well as we could, and endeavoured to take in our
situation. The darkness was intense, but we could easily make out the
fact that our boat was stuck fast. The wind whistled around us, and bore
with such power upon our big sail that the wonder was that it did not
snap the mast or ropes. The sail was quickly lowered, a lantern was lit,
but its flickering light showed no land in view.</p>

<p>We had run upon a submerged rock, and there we were held fast. In vain
the Indians, using their big oars as poles, endeavoured to push the boat
back into deep water. Finding this impossible, some of them sprang out
into the water which threatened to engulf them; but, with the precarious
footing the submerged rock gave them, they pushed and shouted, when,
being aided by a giant wave, the boat at last was pushed over into the
deep water beyond. At considerable risk and thoroughly drenched, the
brave fellows scrambled on board; the sail was again hoisted, and away we
sped through the gloom and darkness.</p>

<p>We reached Norway House on the afternoon of the 29th of July, 1868,
and received a very cordial welcome from James Stewart, Esq., the
gentleman in charge of this Hudson's Bay post. This is one of the most
important establishments of this wealthy fur-trading Company. For many
years it was the capital, at which the different officers and other
officials from the different districts of this vast country were in the
habit of meeting annually for the purpose of arranging the various
matters in connection with their prosecution of the fur trade. Here Sir
George Simpson, for many years the energetic and despotic Governor, used
to come to meet these officials, travelling by birch canoe, manned by his
matchless crew of Iroquois Indians, all the way from Montreal, a distance
of several thousand miles. Here immense quantities of furs were collected
from the different trading posts, and then shipped to England by way of
Hudson's Bay.</p>

<p>The sight of this well-kept establishment, and the courtesy and
cordial welcome extended to us, were very pleasing after our long
toilsome voyage up Lake Winnipeg. But still we were two miles and a half
from our Indian Mission, and so we were full of anxiety to reach the end
of our journey. Mr Stewart, however, insisted on our remaining to tea
with him, and then took us over to the Indian village in his own
row-boat, manned by four sturdy Highlanders. Ere we reached the shore,
sweet sounds of melody fell upon our ears. The Wednesday evening service
was being held, and songs of praise were being sung by the Indian
congregation, the notes of which reached us as we neared the margin and
landed upon the rocky beach. We welcomed this as a pleasing omen, and
rejoiced at it as one of the grand evidences of the Gospel's power to
change. Not many years ago the horrid yells of the conjurer, and the
whoops of the savage Indians, were here the only familiar sounds. Now the
sweet songs of Zion are heard, and God's praises are sung by a people
whose lives attest the genuineness of the work accomplished.</p>

<p>We were cordially welcomed by Mrs Stringfellow in the Mission house,
and were soon afterwards joined by her husband, who had been conducting
the religious services in the church. Very thankful were we that after
our long and adventurous journeyings for two months and eighteen days, by
land and water, through the good providence of God we had reached our
field of toil among the Cree Indians, where for years we were to be
permitted to labour.</p>

<p>Mr and Mrs Stringfellow remained with us for a few days ere they set
out on their return trip to the province of Ontario. We took sweet
counsel together, and I received a great deal of valuable information in
reference to the prosecution of our work among these Red men. For eleven
years the missionary and his wife had toiled and suffered in this
northern land. A goodly degree of success had attended their efforts, and
we were much pleased with the state in which we found everything
connected with the Mission.</p>

<p>While we were at family prayers the first evening after our arrival,
there came up one of the most terrific thunderstorms we ever experienced.
The heavy Mission house, although built of logs, and well mudded and
clap-boarded, shook so much while we were on our knees that several large
pictures fell from the walls; one of which, tumbling on Brother
Stringfellow's head, put a very sudden termination to his evening
devotions.</p>

<p>Rossville Mission, Norway House, was commenced by the Rev. James Evans
in the year 1840. It has been, and still is, one of the most successful
Indian Missions in America. Here Mr Evans invented the syllabic
characters, by which an intelligent Indian can learn to read the Word of
God in ten days or two weeks. Earnestly desirous to devise some method by
which the wandering Indians could acquire the art of reading in a more
expeditious manner than by the use of the English alphabet, he invented
these characters, each of which stands for a syllable. He carved his
first type with his pocket-knife, and procured the lead for the purpose
from the tea-chests of the Hudson's Bay Company's post. His first ink he
made out of the soot from the chimney, and his first paper was birch
bark. Great was the excitement among the Indians when he had perfected
his invention, and had begun printing in their own language. The
conjurers, and other pagan Indians, were very much alarmed, when, as they
expressed it, they found the &ldquo;bark of the tree was beginning to
talk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The English Wesleyan Missionary Society was early impressed with the
advantage of this wonderful invention, and the great help it would be in
carrying on the blessed work. At great expense they sent out a printing
press, with a large quantity of type, which they had had specially cast.
Abundance of paper, and everything else essential, were furnished. For
years portions of the Word of God, and a goodly number of hymns
translated into the Cree language, were printed, and incalculable good
resulted.</p>

<p>Other missionary organisations at work in the country quickly saw the
advantage of using these syllabic characters, and were not slow to avail
themselves of them. While all lovers of Missions rejoice at this, it is
to be regretted that some, from whom better things might have been
expected, were anxious to take the credit of the invention, instead of
giving it to its rightful claimant, the Rev. James Evans. It is a
remarkable fact, that so perfectly did Mr Evans do his work, that no
improvement has been made as regards the use of these characters among
the Cree Indians.</p>

<p>Other missionaries have introduced them among other tribes, with
additions to meet the sounds used in those tribes which are not found
among the Crees. They have even been successfully utilised by the
Moravians among the Esquimaux.</p>

<p>On our arrival at Rossville the Indians crowded in to see the new
missionary and his wife, and were very cordial in their greetings. Even
some pagan Indians, dressed up in their wild picturesque costumes, came
to see us, and were very friendly.</p>

<p>As quickly as possible we settled down to our work, and tried to grasp
its possibilities. We saw many pleasing evidences of what had been
accomplished by faithful predecessors, and were soon convinced of the
greatness of the work yet to be done. For, while from our church, and the
houses of our Christian people, the songs of Zion were heard, our eyes
were saluted by the shouts and yells of old Indian conjurers and
medicine-men, added to the monotonous sounds of their drums, which came
to us nightly from almost every point in the compass, from islands and
headlands not far away.</p>

<p>Our first Sabbath was naturally a very interesting day. Our own
curiosity to see our people was doubtless equalled by that of the people
to see their new missionary. Pagans flocked in with Christians, until the
church was crowded. We were very much pleased with their respectful
demeanour in the house of God. There was no laughing or frivolity in the
sanctuary. With their moccasined feet and cat-like tread, several hundred
Indians did not make one quarter the noise often heard in Christian
lands, made by audiences one-tenth the size. We were much delighted with
their singing. There is a peculiar plaintive sweetness about Indian
singing that has for me a special attractiveness. Scores of them brought
their Bibles to the church. When I announced the lessons for the day, the
quickness with which they found the places showed their familiarity with
the sacred volume. During prayers they were old-fashioned Methodists
enough to kneel down while the Sovereign of the universe was being
addressed. They sincerely and literally entered into the spirit of the
Psalmist when he said: &ldquo;O come, let us worship and bow down: let us
kneel before the Lord our Maker.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was fortunate in securing for my interpreter a thoroughly good
Indian by the name of Timothy Bear. He was of an emotional nature, and
rendered good service to the cause of Christ. Sometimes, when
interpreting for me the blessed truths of the Gospel, his heart would get
fired up, and he would become so absorbed in his theme that he would in a
most eloquent way beseech and plead with the people to accept this
wonderful salvation.</p>

<p>As the days rolled by, and we went in and out among them, and
contrasted the pagan with the Christian Indian, we saw many evidences
that the Gospel is still the power of God unto salvation, and that,
whenever accepted in its fulness, it brings not only peace and joy to the
heart, but is attended by the secondary blessings of civilisation. The
Christian Indians could easily be picked out by the improved appearance
of their homes, as well as by the marvellous change in their lives and
actions.</p>

<p>We found out, before we had been there many days, that we had much to
learn about Indian customs and habits and modes of thought. For example:
the day after Mr and Mrs Stringfellow had left us, a poor woman came in,
and by the sign language let Mrs Young know that she was very hungry. On
the table were a large loaf of bread, a large piece of corned beef, and a
dish of vegetables, left over from our boat supplies. My good wife's
sympathies were aroused at the poor woman's story, and, cutting off a
generous supply of meat and bread, and adding thereto a large quantity of
the vegetables and a quart of tea, she seated the woman at the table
before the hearty meal. Without any trouble the guest disposed of the
whole, and then, to our amazement, began pulling up the skirt of her
dress at the side till she had formed a capacious pocket. Reaching over,
she seized the meat, and put it in this large receptacle, the loaf of
bread quickly followed, and lastly, the dish of vegetables. Then, getting
up from her chair, she turned towards us, saying,
&ldquo;Na-nas-koo-moo-wi-nah,&rdquo; which is the Cree for thanksgiving.
She gracefully backed out of the dining-room, holding carefully onto her
supplies. Mrs Young and I looked in astonishment, but said nothing till
she had gone out. We could not help laughing at the queer sight, although
the food which had disappeared in this unexpected way was what was to
have been our principal support for two or three days, until our supplies
should have arrived. Afterwards, when expressing our astonishment at what
looked like the greediness of this woman, we learned that she had only
complied with the strict etiquette of her tribe. It seems it is their
habit, when they make a feast for anybody, or give them a dinner, if
fortunate enough to have abundance of food, to put a large quantity
before them. The invited guest is expected to eat all he can, and then to
carry the rest away. This was exactly what the poor woman did. From this
lesson of experience we learnt just to place before them what we felt our
limited abilities enabled us to give at the time.</p>

<p>One day a fine-looking Indian came in with a couple of fat ducks. As
our supplies were low, we were glad to see them; and in taking them I
asked him what I should give him for them. His answer was, &ldquo;O,
nothing; they are a <i>present</i> for the missionary and his
wife.&rdquo; Of course I was delighted at this exhibition of generosity
on the part of this entire stranger to us so soon after our arrival in
this wild land. The Indian at once made himself at home with us, and kept
us busy answering questions and explaining to him everything that excited
his curiosity. Mrs Young had to leave her work to play for his
edification on the little melodeon. He remained to dinner, and ate one of
the ducks, while Mrs Young and I had the other. He hung around all the
afternoon, and did ample justice to a supper out of our supplies. He
tarried with us until near the hour for retiring, when I gently hinted to
him that I thought it was about time he went to see if his wigwam was
where he left it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I am only waiting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Waiting?&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;for what are you
waiting?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am waiting for the <i>present</i> you are going to give me
for the <i>present</i> I gave you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I at once took in the situation, and went off and got him something
worth half-a-dozen times as much as his ducks, and he went off very
happy.</p>

<p>When he was gone, my good wife and I sat down, and we said,
&ldquo;Here is lesson number <i>two</i>. Perhaps, after we have been here
a while, we shall know something about the Indians.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After that we accepted of no presents from them, but insisted on
paying a reasonable price for everything we needed which they had to
sell.</p>

<p>Our Sunday's work began with the Sunday School at nine o'clock. All
the boys and girls attended, and often there were present many of the
adults. The children were attentive and respectful, and many of them were
able to repeat large portions of Scripture from memory. A goodly number
studied the Catechism translated into their own Language. They sang the
hymns sweetly, and joined with us in repeating the Lord's Prayer.</p>

<p>The public service followed at half-past ten o'clock. This morning
service was always in English, although the hymns, lessons, and text
would be announced in the two languages. The Hudson's Bay officials who
might be at the Fort two miles away, and all their
<i>employ&eacute;s</i>, regularly attended this morning service. Then, as
many of the Indians understood English, and our object was ever to get
them all to know more and more about it, this service usually was largely
attended by the people. The great Indian service was held in the
afternoon. It was all their own, and was very much prized by them. At the
morning service they were very dignified and reserved; at the afternoon
they sang with an enthusiasm that was delightful, and were not afraid, if
their hearts prompted them to it, to come out with a glad
&ldquo;Amen!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They bring with them to the sanctuary their Bibles, and very sweet to
my ears was the rustle of many leaves as they rapidly turned to the
Lessons of the day in the Old or New Testament. Sermons were never
considered too long. Very quietly and reverently did the people come into
the house of God, and with equal respect for the place, and for Him Whom
there they had worshipped, did they depart. Dr. Taylor, one of our
missionary secretaries, when visiting us, said at the close of one of
these hallowed afternoon services, &ldquo;Mr Young, if the good people
who help us to support Missions and missionaries could see what my eyes
have beheld to-day, they would most cheerfully and gladly give us ten
thousand dollars a year more for our Indian Missions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Every Sunday evening I went over to the Fort, by canoe in summer, and
dog-train in winter, and held service there. A little chapel had been
specially fitted up for these evening services. Another service was also
held in the church at the Mission by the Indians themselves. There were
among them several who could preach very acceptable sermons, and others
who, with a burning eloquence, could tell, like Paul, the story of their
own conversion, and beseech others to be likewise reconciled to God.</p>

<p>We were surprised at times by seeing companies of pagan Indians stalk
into the church during the services, not always acting in a way becoming
to the house or day. At first it was a matter of surprise to me that our
Christian Indians put up with some of these irregularities. I was very
much astounded one day by the entrance of an old Indian called
Tapastonum, who, rattling his ornaments, and crying, &ldquo;Ho!
Ho!&rdquo; came into the church in a sort of trot, and gravely kissed
several of the men and women. As my Christian Indians seemed to stand the
interruption, I felt that I could. Soon he sat down, at the invitation of
Big Tom, and listened to me. He was grotesquely dressed, and had a
good-sized looking-glass hanging on his breast, kept in its place by a
string hung around his neck. To aid himself in listening, he lit his big
pipe and smoked through the rest of the service. When I spoke to the
people afterwards about the conduct of this man, so opposite to their
quiet, respectful demeanour in the house of God, their expressive,
charitable answer was: &ldquo;Such were we once, as ignorant as
Tapastonum is now. Let us have patience with him, and perhaps he, too,
will soon decide to give his heart to God. Let him come; he will get
quiet when he gets the light.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The week evenings were nearly all filled up with services of one kind
or another, and were well attended, or otherwise, according as the
Indians might be present at the village, or away hunting, or fishing, or
&ldquo;tripping&rdquo; for the Hudson's Bay Company. What pleased us very
much was the fact that in the homes of the people there were so many
family altars. It was very delightful to take a quiet walk in the
gloaming through the village, and hear from so many little homes the
voice of the head of the family reading the precious volume, or the
sounds of prayer and praise. Those were times when in every professed
Christian home in the village there was a family altar.</p>

Wondrous changes produced by Christianity &mdash; Illustrations &mdash;
New Year's Day Christian Festival &mdash; The aged and feeble ones first
remembered &mdash; Closing Thanksgiving services.</a></h3>

<p>We found ourselves in a Christian village surrounded by paganism. The
contrast between the two classes was very evident.</p>

<p>Our Christians, as fast as they were able to build, were living in
comfortable houses, and earnestly endeavouring to lift themselves up in
the social circle. Their personal appearance was better, and cleanliness
was accepted as next to godliness. On the Sabbaths they were well
dressed, and presented such a respectable and devout appearance in the
sanctuary as to win the admiration of all who visited us. The great
majority of those who made a profession of faith lived honest, sober, and
consistent lives, and thus showed the genuineness of the change wrought
in them by the glorious Gospel of the Son of God.</p>

<p>One of the most delightful and tangible evidences of the thoroughness
and genuineness of the change was seen in the improvement in the family
life. Such a thing as genuine home life, with mutual love and sympathy
existing among the different members of the family, was unknown in their
pagan state. The men, and even boys, considered it a sign of courage and
manliness to despise and shamefully treat their mothers, wives, or
sisters. Christianity changed all this; and we were constant witnesses of
the genuineness of the change wrought in the hearts and lives of this
people by the preaching of the Gospel, by seeing how woman was uplifted
from her degraded position to her true place in the household.</p>

<p>My heart was often pained at what I saw among some of the wild savage
bands around us. When, by canoe in summer, or dog-train in winter, I have
visited these wild men, I have seen the proud, lazy hunter come stalking
into the camp with his gun on his shoulder, and in loud, imperative tones
shout out to his poor wife, who was busily engaged in cutting wood,
&ldquo;Get up there, you dog, my squaw, and go back on my tracks in the
woods, and bring in the deer I have shot; and hurry, for I want my
food!&rdquo; To quicken her steps, although she was hurrying as rapidly
as possible, a stick was thrown at her, which fortunately she was able to
dodge.</p>

<p>Seizing the long carrying strap, which is a piece of leather several
feet in length, and wide at the middle, where it rests against the
forehead when in use, she rapidly glides away on the trail made by her
husband's snow-shoes, it may be for miles, to the spot where lies the
deer he has shot. Fastening one end of the strap to the haunches of the
deer, and the other around its neck, after a good deal of effort and
ingenuity, she succeeds at length in getting the animal, which may weigh
from a hundred and fifty to two hundred pounds, upon her back, supported
by the strap across her forehead. Panting with fatigue, she comes in with
her heavy burden, and as she throws it down she is met with a sharp stern
command from the lips of the despot called her husband, who has thought
it beneath his dignity to carry in the deer himself, but who imagines it
to be a sign of his being a great brave thus to treat his wife. The gun
was enough for him to carry. Without giving the poor tired creature a
moment's rest, he shouts out again for her to hurry up and be quick; he
is hungry, and wants his dinner.</p>

<p>The poor woman, although almost exhausted, knows full well, by the
bitter experiences of the past, that to delay an instant would bring upon
herself severe punishment, and so she quickly seizes the scalping knife
and deftly skins the animal, and fills a pot with the savoury venison,
which is soon boiled and placed before his highness. While he, and the
men and boys whom he may choose to invite to eat with him, are rapidly
devouring the venison, the poor woman has her first moments of rest. She
goes and seats herself down where women and girls and dogs are
congregated, and there women and dogs struggle for the half-picked bones
which the men, with derisive laughter, throw among them!</p>

<p>This was one of the sad aspects of paganism which I often had to
witness as I travelled among those bands that had not, up to that time,
accepted the Gospel. When these poor women get old and feeble, very sad
and deplorable is their condition. When able to toil and slave, they are
tolerated as necessary evils. When aged and weak, they are shamefully
neglected, and, often, put out of existence.</p>

<p>One of the missionaries, on visiting a pagan band, preached from those
blessed words of the Saviour: &ldquo;Come unto Me, all ye that labour and
are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.&rdquo; In his sermon he spoke
about life's toils and burdens, and how all men had to work and labour.
The men of the congregation were very angry at him; and at an indignation
meeting which they held, they said, &ldquo;Let him go to the squaws with
that kind of talk. They have to carry all the heavy burdens, and do the
hard work. Such stuff as that is not for us men, but for the
women.&rdquo; So they were offended at him.</p>

<p>At a small Indian settlement on the north-eastern shores of Lake
Winnipeg lived a chief by the name of Moo-koo-woo-soo, who deliberately
strangled his mother, and then burnt her body to ashes. When questioned
about the horrid deed, he coolly and heartlessly said that as she had
become too old to snare rabbits or catch fish, he was not going to be
bothered with keeping her, and so he deliberately put her to death. Such
instances could be multiplied many times. Truly &ldquo;the tender mercies
of the wicked are cruel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In delightful contrast to these sad sights among the degraded savages
around us, were the kindly ways and happy homes of our converted Indians.
Among them a woman occupied her true position, and was well and lovingly
treated. The aged and infirm, who but for the Gospel would have been
dealt with as Moo-koo-woo-soo dealt with his mother, had the warmest
place in the little home and the daintiest morsel on the table. I have
seen the sexton of the church throw wide open the door of the sanctuary,
that two stalwart young men might easily enter, carrying in their arms
their invalid mother, who had expressed a desire to come to the house of
God. Tenderly they supported her until the service ended, and then they
lovingly carried her home again. But for the Gospel's blessed influences
on their haughty natures they would have died ere doing such a thing for
a woman, even though she were their own mother.</p>

<p>Life for the women was not now all slavery. They had their happy
hours, and knew well how to enjoy them. Nothing, however, seemed so to
delight them as to be gliding about in the glorious summer time in their
light canoes. And sometimes, combining pleasure with profit, many a duck
was shot by these young Indian maidens.</p>

<p>This changed feeling towards the aged and afflicted ones we have seen
manifested in a very expressive and blessed way at the great annual New
Year's Feast. It was customary for the Indians, long before they became
Christians, to have a great feast at the beginning of the New Year. In
the old times, the principal article of food at these horrid feasts was
dogs, the eating of which was accompanied by many revolting ceremonies.
The missionaries, instead of abolishing the feast, turned it into a
religious festival. I carried out the methods of my worthy predecessors
at Norway House, and so we had a feast every New Year's Day.</p>

<p>The Crees call this day &ldquo;Ooche-me-gou Kesigow,&rdquo; which
literally means &ldquo;the kissing day,&rdquo; as on this day the men
claim the right to kiss every woman they meet; and, strange to say, every
woman expects to be kissed. It used to amuse me very much to see thirty
or forty Indians, dressed up in their finest apparel, come quietly
marching into the Mission House, and gravely kiss Mrs Young on her cheek.
When I used to rally her over this strange phase of unexpected missionary
experience, she would laughingly retort, &ldquo;O, you need not laugh at
me. See that crowd of women out there in the yard, expecting you to go
out and kiss them!&rdquo; It was surprising how much work that day kept
me shut in my study; or if that expedient would not avail, I used to
select a dear old sweet-faced, white-haired grandma, the mother of the
chief, and say, &ldquo;Now I am going to kiss grandma; and as I kiss her
you must all consider yourselves kissed.&rdquo; This institution is more
ancient among them than shaking hands, about which they knew nothing
until it was introduced by the whites.</p>

<p>For weeks before New Year's Day great preparations were made for the
feast. A council would be called, and the men would have recorded what
they were willing to give towards it. Some, who were good deer-hunters,
promised venison. Others promised so many beavers. Perhaps there were
those who knew where bears had made their winter dens, and they agreed to
go and kill them for the feast. Others, who were good fur-hunters, stated
their willingness to exchange some of the furs they would catch for flour
and tea and sugar at the trading post.</p>

<p>Thus the business went on, until enough was promised, with the liberal
supplies given by the Hudson's Bay Company's officials and the
missionary, to make the affair a great success. An outbuilding of the
Mission, called &ldquo;the fish house,&rdquo; was the place where all
these various things, as they were obtained, were stored. Months were
sometimes consumed in collecting the meat. But Jack Frost is a good
preservative, and so nothing spoiled. A few days before the feast, Mrs
Young would select several of the Indian women, and under her
superintendency the various supplies would be cooked. Very clever were
these willing helpers; and in a short time a quantity of food would be
piled up, sufficient for all, although it is well known that Indians have
good appetites.</p>

<p>When the great day arrived, the men quickly removed the seats out of
the church, and there put up long tables. Great boilers of tea were made
ready, and every preparation was completed for a good time. But, before a
mouthful was eaten by any of the eight hundred or thousand persons
present, the chief used to ask me for a pencil and a piece of writing
paper; and then, standing up on a box or bench, he would shout out,
&ldquo;How many of our people are aged, or sick, or afflicted, and cannot
be with us to-day!&rdquo; As one name after another was mentioned, he
rapidly wrote them down. Then he read over the list, and said, &ldquo;Let
us not forget any one.&rdquo; Somebody shouted out, &ldquo;There is an
old woman ten miles up the river towards the old Fort.&rdquo; Somebody
else said, &ldquo;Have you the name of that boy who was accidentally shot
in the leg?&rdquo; Their names were both put down. Then somebody says,
&ldquo;There are two or three left behind in the tent of the pagans,
while the rest have come to the feast.&rdquo; &ldquo;Let us feed those
who have come, and send something with our kind greetings to the
others,&rdquo; is the unanimous response.</p>

<p>When it was certain that none had been overlooked, request was made to
me for all the old newspapers and packing paper I could give them, and
soon loving hands were busily engaged in cutting off large pieces of
different kinds of meat and arranging them with the large flat cakes in
generous bundles. To these were added little packages of tea and sugar.
In this way as many large bundles &mdash; each containing an assortment
of everything at the feast &mdash; would be made up as there were names
on the paper. Then the chief would call in, from where the young men were
busily engaged in playing football, as many of the fleet runners as there
were bundles, and giving each his load, would indicate the person to whom
he was to give it, and also would add, &ldquo;Give them our New Year's
greetings and sympathy, and tell them we are sorry they cannot be with us
to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Very delightful were these sights to us. Such things paid us a
thousandfold for our hardships and sufferings. Here, before a mouthful
was eaten by the healthy and vigorous ones, large generous bundles, that
would last for days, were sent off to the aged and infirm or wounded
ones, who in all probability, but for the blessed influences of the
Gospel, if not quickly and cruelly put out of existence, would have been
allowed to linger on in neglect and wretchedness.</p>

<p>Even the young runners seemed to consider that it was an honour to be
permitted to carry these bundles, with the loving messages, to the
distant homes or wigwams where the afflicted ones were. It was quite
amusing to watch them tighten up their belts and dash off like deers.
Some of them had several miles to go; but what cared they on this glad
day?</p>

<p>According to seniority the tables were filled, and the feast began as
soon as the &ldquo;Grace before Meat&rdquo; had been sung. Mrs Young had
her own long table, and to it she invited not only the Hudson's Bay
Company's people, but as many of the aged and worthy from among the poor
Indians as we wished specially to honour. Sometimes we filled one table
with wild pagans who had come in from some distant forest home, attracted
by the reports of the coming great feast. Through their stomachs we
sometimes reached their hearts, and won them to Christ.</p>

<p>Thus for hours the feast continued, until all had been supplied. None
were neglected, and everybody was happy. Then with a glad heart they
sang:</p>

<blockquote><br>
 &ldquo;Praise God, from Whom all blessings flow.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
</blockquote>

<p>When all the guests were satisfied, what was left was carried off by
the needy ones, among whom it was generously divided; the tables were
quickly taken down by the men, and the church was speedily swept clean by
some active women. The seats and pews were replaced, and every
arrangement was made for the great annual New Year's Meeting. The church
was lit up; and when the audience had gathered, a chairman was appointed,
and, after singing and prayer, speeches were made by several of the
Indians.</p>

<p>Many pleasant and many sensible things were said. Some of the
sober-minded ones reviewed the year just gone, with all its blessings and
mercies, and expressed the hope that the one on which they had entered
would be crowned with blessings. Some of the speeches referred to Treaty
matters with the Government, and others were in reference to their
huntings and fisheries. Some were bright and witty, and were received
with laughter and applause. Others were of a serious, religious
character, and were equally welcome, and touched responsive hearts. With
pleasure I noticed that in them all the most frequent word was
&ldquo;Na-nas-koomoo-win-ah,&rdquo; which means
&ldquo;Thanksgiving,&rdquo; and for this my heart rejoiced. Thus ended,
with the Doxology and Benediction, these happy days, in which we saw so
many evidences that the preaching of the Gospel had not been in vain.</p>

<p>I had received instructions from the Missionary Secretaries to visit
Oxford Mission as soon as possible, and to do all I could for its
upbuilding. This Mission had had a good measure of success in years gone
by. A church and Mission house had been built at Jackson's Bay, and many
of the Indians had been converted. But the village was too far from the
Hudson's Bay Company's Post, where the Indians traded, and where
naturally they gathered. For several years the work had been left in
charge of a native teacher. The people regretted the absence of an
ordained Missionary, and the place suffered accordingly. Making all the
arrangements I could for the successful prosecution of the work in my
absence, I left Norway House in a small canoe, manned by two of my
Christian Indians, one of whom was my interpreter. With this wonderful
little boat I was now to make my first intimate acquaintance. For this
wild land of broad lakes and rapid rivers and winding creeks, the
birch-bark canoe is the boat of all others most admirably fitted. It is
to the Indian denizen here what the horse is to his more warlike red
brother on the great prairies, or what the camel is to those who live and
wander amidst Arabian deserts. The canoe is absolutely essential to these
natives in this land, where there are no other roads than the intricate
devious water routes. It is the frailest of all boats, yet it can be
loaded down to the water's edge, and, under the skilful guidance of these
Indians, who are unquestionably the finest canoe men in the world, it can
be made to respond to the sweep of their paddles, so that it seems almost
instinct with life and reason. What they can do in it, and with it,
appeared to me at times perfectly marvellous. Yet when we remember that
for about five months of every year some of the hunters almost live in
it, this may not seem so very wonderful. It carries them by day, and in
it, or under it, they often sleep by night. At the many portages which
have to be made in this land, where the rivers are so full of falls and
rapids, one man can easily carry it on his head to the smooth water
beyond. In it we have travelled thousands of miles, while going from
place to place with the blessed tidings of salvation to these wandering
bands scattered over my immense Circuit. Down the wild rapids we have
rushed for miles together, and then out into great Winnipeg, or other
lakes, so far from shore that the distant headlands were scarce visible.
Foam-crested waves have often seemed as though about to overwhelm us, and
treacherous gales to swamp us, yet my faithful, well-trained canoe men
were always equal to every emergency, and by the accuracy of their
judgment, and the quickness of their movements, appeared ever to do
exactly the right thing at the right moment. As the result, I came at
length to feel as much at home in a canoe as anywhere else, and with
God's blessing was permitted to make many long trips to those who could
not be reached in any other way, except by dog-trains in winter.</p>

<p>Good canoe-makers are not many, and so really good canoes are always
in demand.</p>

<p>Frail and light as this Indian craft may be, there is a great deal of
skill and ingenuity required in its construction.</p>

<p>Great care is requisite in taking the bark from the tree. A long
incision is first made longitudinally in the trunk of the tree. Then,
from this cut, the Indian begins, and with his keen knife gradually peels
off the whole of the bark, as high up as his incision went, in one large
piece or sheet. And even now that he has safely got it off the tree, the
greatest care is necessary in handling it, as it will split or crack very
easily. Cedar is preferred for the woodwork, and when it can possibly be
obtained, is always used. But in the section of the country where I
lived, as we were north of the cedar limit, the canoe-makers used pieces
of the spruce tree, split very thin, as the best substitute for cedar
that our country afforded.</p>

<p>All the sewing of the pieces of birch bark together, and the fastening
of the whole to the outer frame, is done with the long slender roots of
the balsam or larch trees, which are soaked and rubbed until they are as
flexible as narrow strips of leather. When all the sewing is done, the
many narrow limber pieces of spruce are crowded into their places, giving
the whole canoe its requisite proportions and strength. Then the seams
and weak spots are well covered over with melted pitch, which the Indians
obtain from the spruce and balsam trees.</p>

<p>Great care is taken to make the canoe watertight. To accomplish this,
the boat is often swung between trees and filled with water. Every place
where the slightest leak is discovered is marked, and, when the canoe is
emptied, is carefully attended to.</p>

<p>Canoes vary in style and size. Each tribe using them has its own
patterns, and it was to me an ever interesting sight, to observe how
admirably suited to the character of the lakes and rivers were the canoes
of each tribe or district.</p>

<p>The finest and largest canoes were those formerly made by the Lake
Superior Indians. Living on the shores of that great inland sea, they
required canoes of great size and strength. These &ldquo;great north
canoes,&rdquo; as they were called, could easily carry from a dozen to a
score of paddlers, with a cargo of a couple of tons of goods. In the old
days of the rival fur-traders, these great canoes played a very prominent
part. Before steam or even large sailing vessels had penetrated into
those northern lakes, these canoes were extensively used, loaded with the
rich furs of those wild forests, they used to come down into the Ottawa,
and thence on down that great stream, often even as far as to
Montreal.</p>

<p>Sir George Simpson, the energetic but despotic and unprincipled
governor of the Hudson's Bay Company for many years, used to travel in
one of these birch canoes all the way from Montreal up the Ottawa on
through Lake Nipissing into Georgian Bay; from thence into Lake Superior,
on to Thunder Bay. From this place, with indomitable pluck, he pushed on
back into the interior, through the Lake of the Woods, down the tortuous
river Winnipeg into the lake of the same name. Along the whole length of
this lake he annually travelled, in spite of its treacherous storms and
annoying head winds, to preside over the Council and attend to the
business of the wealthiest fur-trading company that ever existed, over
which he watched with eagle eye, and in every department of which his
distinct personality was felt. His famous Iroquois crew are still talked
about, and marvellous are the stories in circulation about many a
northern camp fire of their endurance and skill.</p>

<p>How rapid the changes which are taking place in this world of ours! It
seems almost incredible, in these days of mighty steamships going almost
everywhere on our great waters, to think that there are hundreds of
people still living who distinctly remember when the annual trips of a
great governor were made from Montreal to Winnipeg in a birch-bark Canoe,
manned by Indians.</p>

<p>Of this light Indian craft Longfellow wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><br>
 &ldquo;Give me of your bark, O Birch tree!<br>
 Of your yellow bark, O Birch tree!<br>
 Growing by the rushing river,<br>
 Tall and stately in the valley!<br>
 I a light canoe will build me,<br>
 Build a swift canoe for sailing.<br>
<br>
 . . . .<br>
<br>
 &ldquo;Thus the Birch canoe was builded<br>
 In the valley, by the river,<br>
 In the bosom of the forest;<br>
 All its mystery and its magic,<br>
 All the brightness of the birch tree,<br>
 All the toughness of the cedar,<br>
 All the larch trees supple sinews;<br>
 And it floated on the river<br>
 Like a yellow leaf in autumn,<br>
 Like a yellow water-lily.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
</blockquote>

<p>We left for Oxford Mission on the 8th of September. The distance is
over two hundred miles, through the wildest country imaginable. We did
not see a house &mdash; with the exception of those built by the beavers
&mdash; from the time we left our Mission home until we reached our
destination. We paddled through a bewildering variety of picturesque
lakes, rivers, and creeks. When no storms or fierce head-winds impeded
us, we were able to make fifty or sixty miles a day. When night overtook
us, we camped on the shore. Sometimes it was very pleasant and romantic.
At other times, when storms raged and we were drenched with the rain so
thoroughly that for days we had not a dry stitch upon us, it was not
quite so agreeable.</p>

<p>We generally began our day's journey very early in the morning, if the
weather was at all favourable, and paddled on as rapidly as possible,
since we knew not when head-winds might arise and stop our progress. The
Oxford route is a very diversified one. There are lakes, large and small,
across which we had to paddle. In some of them, when the wind was
favourable, our Indians improvised a sail out of one of our blankets.
Lashing it to a couple of oars, they lifted it up in the favouring wind,
and thus very rapidly did we speed on our way.</p>

<p>At times we were in broad beautiful rivers, and then paddling along in
little narrow creeks amidst the reeds and rushes. We passed over, or, as
they say in that country, &ldquo;made&rdquo; nine portages around
picturesque falls or rapids. In these portages one of the Indians carried
the canoe on his head. The other made a great load of the bedding and
provisions, all of which he carried on his back. My load consisted of the
two guns, ammunition, two kettles, the bag containing my changes of
raiment, and a package of books for the Indians we were to visit. How the
Indians could run so quickly through the portages was to me a marvel.
Often the path was but a narrow ledge of rock against the side of the
great granite cliff. At other times it was through the quaking bog or
treacherous muskeg. To them it seemed to make no difference. On they went
with their heavy loads at that swinging Indian stride which soon left me
far behind. On some of my canoe trips the portages were several miles
long, and through regions so wild that there was nothing to indicate to
me the right direction. When we were making them, I used to follow on as
long as I knew I was in the right way. When I lost the trail, I at once
stopped and patiently waited until one of my faithful men, having carried
his load safely to the end, would come back for me. Quickly picking up my
load, he would hurry off, and even then, unencumbered as I was, it was
often as much as I could do to keep up with him.</p>

<p>Oxford Lake is one of the most beautiful and picturesque lakes I ever
saw. It is between twenty and thirty miles long and several miles wide.
It is studded with islands of every imaginable variety. Its waters are
almost as transparent as the clear, fresh air above it. When no breath
ripples its surface, one can look down into its crystal depths and see,
many feet below, the great fish quietly moving about.</p>

<p>To visit the Indians who fish in its waters, and hunt upon its shores,
I once brought one of our Missionary Secretaries, the eloquent Rev.
Lachlin Taylor, D.D. The trip down had not been one of the most pleasant.
The rains had drenched him, and the mosquitoes had plagued him with such
persistency, that he loudly bemoaned his lot in being found in a country
that was cursed with such abominable animals.</p>

<p>One night I heard him muttering between his efforts to get them out of
his tent, where he declared they were attacking him in
battalions:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><br>
 &ldquo;They throng the air, and darken heaven,<br>
         And curse this Western land.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
</blockquote>

<p>However, when we reached Oxford Lake, the mosquitoes left us for a
time. The sun came out in splendour, and we had some days of rarest
beauty. The good doctor regained his spirits, and laughed when I rallied
him on some of his strong expressions about the country, and told him
that I hoped, as the result of his experience, he, as all Missionary
Secretaries ought, would have a good deal of sympathy for the
Missionaries who live in such regions for years together.</p>

<p>We camped for the night on one of the most picturesque points. We had
two canoes, and to man them four Indians from our Norway House Mission.
As the doctor was an enthusiastic fisherman, he decided that we must stop
there during the forenoon, while he tried his hand. His first haul was a
splendid pike over two feet long. Great was his excitement as his success
was assured. Eloquence poured from him; we were flooded with it. The
Indians looked on in amazement while he talked of the beauties of the
lake and islands, of the water and the sky.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a moment, doctor,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I can add to the
wild beauty of the place something that will please your artistic
eye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I requested two fine-looking Indians to launch one of the canoes, and
to quietly paddle out to the edge of an island which abruptly rose from
the deep, clear waters before us, the top of which had on it a number of
splendid spruce and balsams, massed together in natural beauty. I
directed the men to drop over the side of the canoe a long fishing line,
and then, posing them in striking attitudes in harmony with the place, I
asked them to keep perfectly still until every ripple made by their canoe
had died away.</p>

<p>I confess I was entranced by the loveliness of the sight. The
reflections of the canoe and men, and of the islands and rocks, were as
vivid as the actual realities. So clear and transparent was the water,
that where it and the air met there seemed but a narrow thread between
the two elements. Not a breath of air stirred, not a ripple moved. It was
one of those sights which come to us but seldom in a lifetime, where
everything is in perfect unison, and God gives us glimpses of what this
world, His footstool, must have been before sin entered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; I said quietly, for my heart was full of the
Doxology, &ldquo;tell me what you think of that vision.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Standing up, with a great rock beneath his feet, in a voice of
suppressed emotion he began. Quietly at first he spoke, but soon he was
carried away with his own eloquence:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know well the lochs of my own beloved Scotland, for in many
of them I have rowed and fished. I have visited all the famed lakes of
Ireland, and have rowed on those in the Lake counties of England. I have
travelled far and oft on our great American lakes, and have seen Tahoe,
in all its crystal beauty. I have rowed on the Bosphorus, and travelled
in a felucca on the Nile. I have lingered in the gondola on the canals of
Venice, and have traced Rob Roy's canoe in the Sea of Galilee, and on the
old historic Jordan. I have seen, in my wanderings in many lands, places
of rarest beauty, but the equal of this mine eyes have never gazed
upon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Never after did I see the lake as we saw it that day.</p>

<p>On it we have had to battle against fierce storms, where the angry
waves seemed determined to engulf us. Once, in speeding along as well as
we could from island to island, keeping in the lee as much as possible,
we ran upon a sharp rock and stove a hole in our canoe. We had to use our
paddles desperately to reach the shore, and when we had done so, we found
our canoe half-full of water, in which our bedding and food were soaked.
We hurriedly built a fire, melted some pitch, and mended our canoe, and
hurried on.</p>

<p>On this lake, which can give us such pictures of wondrous beauty, I
have encountered some of the greatest gales and tempests against which I
have ever had to contend, even in this land of storms and blizzards. Then
in winter, upon its frozen surface it used to seem to me that the Frost
King held high carnival. Terrible were the sufferings of both dogs and
men on some of those trips. One winter, in spite of all the wraps I could
put around me, making it possible for me to run &mdash; for riding was
out of the question, so intense was the cold &mdash; every part of my
face exposed to the pitiless blast was frozen. My nose, cheeks, eyebrows,
and even lips, were badly frozen, and for days after I suffered. Cuffy,
the best of my Newfoundland dogs, had all of her feet frozen, and even
Jack's were sore for many a day after. My loyal Indians suffered also,
and we all declared Oxford Lake to be a cold place in winter, and its
storms worse than the summer mosquitoes.</p>

<p>The Indians of Oxford Lake were among the finest in all the great
North-West. It was ever a joy to meet them as I used to do once in summer
by canoe trip, and then again in winter by dog-train. God blessed my
visits to them. The old members were cheered and comforted as the Gospel
was preached to them, and the Sacraments administered. Some pagans were
induced to renounce their old lives, and the cause of religion was more
and more established. The Rev. Mr Brooking, and, later, the studious and
devoted Rev. Orrin German, did blessed service in that lonely Mission. At
the present time the Rev. Edward Papanekis is the acceptable Missionary
there.</p>

<p>Long years ago I found Edward a careless, sinful young man. Once he
rushed into the Mission house under the influence of liquor, and
threatened to strike me. But the blessed truth reached his heart, and it
was my joy to see him a humble suppliant at the Cross. His heart's desire
was realised. God has blessedly led him on, and now he is faithfully
preaching that same blessed Gospel to his countrymen at Oxford
Mission.</p>

<p>In responding to the many Macedonian cries my Circuit kept so
enlarging that I had to be &ldquo;in journeyings often.&rdquo; My canoes
were sometimes launched in spring, ere the great floating ice-fields had
disappeared, and through tortuous open channels we carefully paddled our
way, often exposed to great danger.</p>

<p>On one of these early trips we came to a place where for many miles
the moving ice fields stretched out before us. One narrow channel of open
water only was before us. Anxious to get on, we dashed into it, and
rapidly paddled ourselves along. I had two experienced Indians, and so
had no fear, but expected some novel adventures &mdash; and had them with
interest.</p>

<p>Our hopes were that the wind would widen the channel, and thus let us
into open water. But, to our disappointment, when we had got along a mile
or so in this narrow open space, we found the ice was quietly but surely
closing in upon us. As it was from four to six feet thick, and of vast
extent, there was power enough in it to crush a good-sized ship; so it
seemed that our frail birch-bark canoe would have but a poor chance.</p>

<p>I saw there was a reasonable possibility that when the crash came we
could spring on to the floating ice. But what should we do then? was the
question, with canoe destroyed and us on floating ice far from land.</p>

<p>However, as my Indians kept perfectly cool, I said nothing, but
paddled away and watched for the development of events. Nearer and nearer
came the ice; soon our channel was not fifty feet wide. Already behind us
the floes had met, and we could hear the ice grinding and breaking as the
enormous masses met in opposite directions. Now it was only about twenty
feet from side to side. Still the men paddled on, and I kept paddling in
unison with them. When the ice was so close that we could easily touch it
on either side with our paddles, one of the Indians quietly said,
&ldquo;Missionary, will you please give me your paddle?&rdquo; I quickly
handed it to him, when he immediately thrust it with his own into the
water, holding down the ends of them so low horizontally under the canoe
that the blade end was out of water on the other side of the boat. The
other Indian held his paddle in the same position, although from the
other side of the canoe. Almost immediately after the ice crowded in upon
us. But as the points of the paddles were higher than the ice, of course
they rested upon it for an instant. This was what my cool-headed, clever
men wanted. They had a fulcrum for their paddles, and so they pulled
carefully on the handle ends of them, and, the canoe sliding up as the
ice closed in and met with a crash under us, we found ourselves seated in
it on the top of the ice. The craft, although only a frail birch-bark
canoe, was not in the least injured.</p>

<p>As we quickly sprang out of our canoe, and carried it away from where
the ice had met and was being ground into pieces by the momentum with
which it met, I could not but express my admiration to my men at the
clever feat.</p>

<p>After some exciting work we reached the shore, and there patiently
waited until the wind and sun cleared away the ice, and we could venture
on. My plan was to spend at least a week in each Indian village or
encampment, preaching three times a day, and either holding school with
the children, or by personal entreaty beseeching men and women to be
reconciled to God. When returning from the visit, which was a very
successful one, we had to experience some of the inconveniences of
travelling in such a frail bark as a birch canoe on such a stormy lake as
Winnipeg.</p>

<p>The weather had been very unsettled, and so we had cautiously paddled
from point to point. We had dinner at what the Indians call Montreal
Point, and then started for the long crossing to Old Norway House Point,
as it was then called. It is a very long open traverse, and as lowering
clouds threatened us we pulled on as rapidly as our three paddles could
propel us. When out a few miles from land the storm broke upon us, the
wind rose rapidly, and soon we were riding over great white-crested
billows. My men were very skilful, and we had no fear; but the most
skilful management was necessary to safely ride the waves, which soon in
size were rivalling those of the ocean. A canoe is a peculiar craft, and
requires an experienced hand in these great storms.</p>

<p>We were getting on all right, and were successfully climbing the big
waves in quick succession, alert and watchful that no sudden erratic move
should catch us off our guard and overturn us. At length we met a wave of
unusual height, and succeeded in climbing up into its foaming crest all
right. Then down its side our little craft shot with the apparent
velocity of a sled down a toboggan slide. When we reached the bottom of
this trough of the sea, our canoe slapped so violently upon the water
that the birch bark on the bottom split from side to side. Of course the
water rushed in upon us with uncomfortable rapidity. The more we paddled
the worse the water entered, as the exertion strained the boat and opened
the rent. Quickly folding up a blanket, I carefully placed it over the
long rent, and kneeled down upon it to keep it in place. The man in the
front of the canoe put down his paddle, and, taking up the kettle, baled
as rapidly as he could, while the Indian in the stern, and myself in the
middle, plied our paddles for dear life. We turned towards the Spider
Islands, which were over a mile away, and by vigorous work succeeded in
reaching one of them, although our canoe was half full of water. Then
could we enter into David's words, as for life we struggled, and our
little craft was tossed on the cross sea in our efforts to reach a place
of safety: &ldquo;They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man,
and are at their wit's end. Then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble,
and He bringeth them out of their distresses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We paddled up as far as we could on a smooth granite rock that came
out gradually in the water. Then out we sprang, and strong hands dragged
our little canoe up beyond the reach of the waves. We hastily pulled out
our dripping blankets and soaked food and other things, and then,
overturning the canoe, emptied it of water; and as we saw the large break
in the bottom, we realised as we had not before the danger we had been
in, and the providential escape which had been ours. So, with glad
hearts, we said, &ldquo;We do 'praise the Lord for His goodness, and for
His wonderful works to the children of men.'&ldquo;</p>

<p>We quickly built a fire, and melted some pitch, a quantity of which is
always carried ready for such emergencies. The long rent was covered over
with a piece of cloth well saturated in the boiling pitch, a quantity
more was poured over, and the whole was carefully smoothed out over the
weak place. Soon it cooled and hardened, and the work was done. We ate a
little food, and then launched our frail craft and pushed on. No serious
accidents again troubled us, and we ended this long canoe trip, as we had
done many others, thankful that we had such blessed opportunities to go
to the remote places as heralds of the Cross, and doubly thankful when we
were safe at home again.</p>

<p>On one of my canoe trips, when looking after pagan bands in the remote
Nelson River District, I had some singular experiences, and learned some
important lessons about the craving of the pagan heart after God.</p>

<p>We had been journeying on for ten or twelve days when one night we
camped on the shore of a lake-like river. While my men were busily
employed in gathering wood and cooking the supper, I wandered off and
ascended to the top of a well wooded hill which I saw in the distance.
Very great indeed was my surprise, when I reached the top, to find myself
in the presence of the most startling evidences of a degraded
paganism.</p>

<p>The hill had once been densely covered with trees, but about every
third one had been cut down, and the stumps, which had been left from
four to ten feet high, had been carved into rude representations of the
human form. Scattered around were the dog-ovens, which were nothing but
holes dug in the ground and lined with stones, in which at certain
seasons, as part of their religious ceremonies, some of their favourite
dogs &mdash; white ones were always preferred &mdash; were roasted, and
then devoured by the excited crowd. Here and there were the tents of the
old conjurers and medicine men, who, combining some knowledge of disease
and medicine with a great deal of superstitious abominations, held
despotic sway over the people. The power of these old conjurers over the
deluded Indians was very great. They were generally lazy old fellows, but
succeeded nevertheless in getting the best that was going, as they held
other Indians in such terror of their power, that gifts in the shape of
fish and game were constantly flowing in upon them. They have the secret
art among themselves of concocting some poisons so deadly that a little
put in the food of a person who has excited their displeasure will cause
death almost as soon as a dose of strychnine. They have other poisons
which, while not immediately causing death to the unfortunate victims,
yet so affect and disfigure them that, until death releases them, their
sufferings are intense and their appearance frightful.</p>

<p>Here on this hill top were all these sad evidences of the degraded
condition of the people. I wandered around and examined the idols, most
of which had in front of them, and in some instances on their flat heads,
offerings of tobacco, food, red cotton, and other things. My heart was
sad at these evidences of such degrading idolatry, and I was deeply
impressed with my need of wisdom and aid from on high, so that when I met
the people who here worshipped these idols I might so preach Christ and
Him crucified that they would be constrained to accept Him as their
all-sufficient Saviour.</p>

<p>While there I lingered, and mused, and prayed, the shadows of the
night fell on me, and I was shrouded in gloom. Then the full moon rose up
in the East, and as her silvery beams shone through the trees and lit up
these grotesque idols, the scene presented a strange weird appearance. My
faithful Indians, becoming alarmed at my long absence &mdash; for the
country was infested by wild animals &mdash; were on the search for me,
when I returned to the camp fire. We ate our evening meal, sang a hymn,
and bowed in prayer. Then we wrapped ourselves up in our blankets, and
lay down on the granite rocks to rest. Although our bed was hard and
there was no roof above us, we slept sweetly, for the day had been one of
hard work and strange adventure.</p>

<p>After paddling about forty miles the next day we reached the Indians
of that section of the country, and remained several weeks among them.
With the exception of the old conjurers, they all received me very
cordially. These old conjurers had the same feelings toward me as those
who made silver shrines for Diana of Ephesus had toward the first
preachers of Christianity in their city. They trembled for their
occupation. They well knew that if I succeeded in inducing the people to
become Christians their occupation would be gone, and they would have to
settle down to work for their own living, like other people, or starve. I
visited them as I did the rest of the encampment, but they had enmity in
their hearts toward me. Of all their efforts to injure or destroy me of
course I knew not. That their threats were many I well understood; but He
Who had said, &ldquo;Lo, I am with you alway,&rdquo; mercifully watched
over me and shielded me from their evil deeds. My two Indian attendants
also watched as well as prayed, with a vigilance that seemed untiring.
Very pleasant, indeed, are my memories of my faithful Indian comrades on
those long journeys. Their loyalty and devotion could not be excelled.
Everything that they could do for my safety and happiness was cheerfully
done.</p>

<p>We held three religious services every day, and between these services
taught the people to read in the Syllabic characters. One day, in
conversing with an old fine-looking Indian, I said to him, &ldquo;What is
your religion? If you have any clear idea of a religion, tell me in what
you believe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His answer was; &ldquo;We believe in a good Spirit and in a bad
spirit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, then,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;do you not worship the good
Spirit? I came through your sacred grounds, and I saw where you had cut
down some trees. Part you had used as fuel with which to cook your bear
or deer meat; out of the rest you had made an idol, which you worship.
How is one part more sacred than the other? Why do you make and worship
idols?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I can never forget his answer, or the impressive and almost passionate
way in which the old man replied:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Missionary, the Indian's mind is dark, and he cannot grasp the
unseen. He hears the great Spirit's voice in the thunder and storms. He
sees the evidences of His existence all around, but neither he nor his
fathers have ever seen the great Spirit, or any one who has; and so he
does not know what He looks like. But man is the highest creature that he
knows of, and so he makes his idols like a man, and calls it his
'Manito.' We only worship them because we do not know what the great
Spirit looks like, but these we can understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly there flashed into my mind the request of Philip to the Lord
Jesus: &ldquo;Show us the Father, and it sufficeth us;&rdquo; and the
wonderful answer: &ldquo;Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast
thou not known Me, Philip? He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father; and
how sayest thou then, Show us the Father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I opened my Indian Bible at that wonderful chapter of disinterested
love, the fourteenth of John, and preached unto them Jesus, in His two
natures, Divine and human. While emphasising the redemptive work of the
Son of God, I referred to His various offices and purposes of love and
compassion, His willingness to meet us and to save us from perplexity and
doubt, as well as from sin. I spoke about Him as our elder Brother, so
intimately allied to us, and still retaining His human form as He pleads
for us at the throne of God. I dwelt upon these delightful truths, and
showed how Christ's love had so brought him to us, that with the eye of
faith we could see Him, and in Him all of God for which our hearts
craved. &ldquo;Whom having not seen, we love; in Whom, though now we see
Him not, yet believing, we rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of
glory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For many days I needed no other themes. They listened attentively, and
the holy Spirit applied these truths to their hearts and consciences so
effectively that they gladly received them. A few more visits effectually
settled them in the truth. They have cut down their idols, filled up the
dog-ovens, torn away the conjurers' tents, cleared the forest, and
banished every vestige of the old life. And there, at what is called
&ldquo;the Meeting of the Three Rivers,&rdquo; on that very spot where
idols were worshipped amidst horrid orgies, and where the yells, rattles,
and drums of the old conjurers and medicine men were heard continuously
for days and nights, there is now a little church, where these same
Indians, transformed by the glorious Gospel of the Son of God, are
&ldquo;clothed and in their right mind, sitting at the feet of
Jesus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My visits to Nelson River so impressed me with the fact of the
necessity of some zealous missionary going down there and living among
the people, that, in response to appeals made, the Rev. John Semmens,
whose heart God had filled with missionary zeal, and who had come out to
assist me at Norway House, nobly resolved to undertake the work. He was
admirably fitted for the arduous and responsible task. But no language of
mine can describe what he had to suffer. His record is on high. The
Master has it all, and He will reward. Great were his successes, and
signal his triumphs.</p>

<p>At that place, where I found the stumps carved into idols, which
Brother Semmens has so graphically described, the church, mainly through
his instrumentality and personal efforts, has been erected. In the last
letter which I have received from that land, the writer says: &ldquo;The
Indians now all profess themselves to be Christians. Scores of them by
their lives and testimonies assure us of the blessed consciousness that
the Lord Jesus is indeed their own loving Saviour. Every conjuring drum
has ceased. All vestiges of the old heathenish life are gone, we believe
for ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them,
and the desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grandly has this prophecy been fulfilled, and dwarfs into
insignificance all the sufferings and hardships endured in the pioneer
work which I had in beginning this Mission. With a glad heart I rejoice
that &ldquo;unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this
grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable
riches of Christ.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So destitute are these wild north lands of roads that there are really
no distinct words in the languages of these northern tribes to represent
land vehicles. In translating such words as &ldquo;waggon&rdquo; or
&ldquo;chariot&rdquo; into the Cree language, a word similar to that for
&ldquo;dog-sled" had to be used.</p>

<p>No surveyor, up to the years about which I am writing, had visited
those regions, and there were literally no roads as understood in
civilised lands.</p>

<p>So numerous are the lakes and rivers that roads are unnecessary to the
Indian in the summer time. With his light birch canoe he can go almost
everywhere he desires. If obstructions block up his passage, all he has
to do is to put his little canoe on his head, and a short run will take
him across the portage, or around the cataracts or falls, or over the
height of land to some other lake or stream, where he quickly embarks and
continues his journey.</p>

<p>All summer travelling is done along the water routes. Naturally the
various trading posts and Indian villages or encampments are located on
the edges of the lakes or rivers, or very near them, so as to be most
conveniently reached in this way. So short are the summers that there are
only about five months of open water to be depended upon in these high
latitudes. During the other seven months the dog sled is the only
conveyance for purposes of travelling. So rough and wild is the country
that we know of no vehicle that could take its place, and no animals that
could do the work of the dogs.</p>

<p>As the years of toil rolled on, my Mission field or Circuit so
enlarged that it extended irregularly north and south over five hundred
miles, with a width in some places of over three hundred. In summer I
travelled over it in a birch canoe, and in winter with my dog-trains.</p>

<p>At first it seemed very novel, and almost like child's play, to be
dragged along by dogs, and there was almost a feeling of rebellion
against what seemed such frivolous work. But we soon found out that we
had travelled in worse conveyances and with poorer steeds than in a good
dog sled, when whirled along by a train of first-class dogs.</p>

<p>The dogs generally used are of the Esquimaux breed, although in many
places they have become so mixed up with other varieties as to be almost
unrecognisable. The pure Esquimaux sled dogs are well-built, compact
animals, weighing from eighty to a hundred and twenty pounds. They are of
various colours, and have a close, warm, furry coat of hair. They have
sharp-pointed ears and very bushy, curly tails. They are the most
notorious thieves. I never could completely break an Esquimaux dog of
this propensity. It seemed ingrained in their very natures. I have
purchased young puppies of this breed from the natives, have fed them
well, and have faithfully endeavoured to bring them up in the way in
which they ought to go, but I never could get them to stay there. Steal
they would, and did, whenever they had an opportunity.</p>

<p>This serious defect may have been the result of the constant and
unremitting neglect with which Indians generally treat their dogs. They
are fond of them in a way, and are unwilling to part with them, except at
a good price; yet, except when working them, they very seldom feed them.
The dogs are generally left to steal their living, and some of them
become very clever at it, as more than once I found to my sorrow. When
the fisheries are successful, or many deer have been killed, the dogs,
like their owners, are fat and flourishing. When food is scarce, the
dogs' allowance is the first cut off. We could always tell at a glance,
when a band of wild, wandering pagan Indians came in to visit our village
from their distant hunting grounds, how they had prospered. If they and
their dogs were fat and good-natured, they had had abundance of food. If,
while the people looked fairly well, the dogs were thin and wolfish, we
knew they had fared but moderately. If the dogs were all gone and the
people looked gaunt and famine-stricken, we knew they had had hard times,
and, as a last resort, had eaten their poor dogs to keep themselves
alive.</p>

<p>Some of the Indians who make a pretence to feed their dogs in winter
never think of doing so in summer. The result is that, as they have to
steal, hunt, or starve, they become adepts in one or the other.
Everything that is eatable, and many things apparently uneatable, are
devoured by them. They fairly howled with delight when they found access
to such things as old leather moccasins, dog harness, whips, fur caps,
mitts, and similar things. They greedily devoured all they could, and
then most cunningly buried the rest. Many of them go off in summer-time
on long fishing excursions. I once, when away on a canoe trip, met a pack
of them up a great river over a hundred miles from their home. When we
first saw them at a long distance, we mistook them for wolves, and began
to prepare for battle. The quick eyes of my Indian canoe men soon saw
what they were, and putting down our guns, we spent a little time in
watching them. To my great surprise I found out that they were fishing on
their own account. This was something new to me, and so I watched them
with much interest.</p>

<p>On the side of the river on which they were was a shallow, reedy
marsh, where the water was from a few inches to a foot in depth. In these
shallow waters, at certain seasons of the year, different varieties of
fish are to be found. The principal is the Jack fish, or pike, some of
which are over three feet long. As they crowd along in these shallows,
often with their back fins out of the water, they are observed by the
dogs, who quietly wade out, often to a distance of many yards, and seize
them with such a grip that, in spite of their struggles, they are carried
in triumph to the shore, and there speedily devoured. Sometimes the dogs
will remain away for weeks together on these fishing excursions, and will
return in much better condition than when they left.</p>

<p>During the winter of the first Riel Rebellion, when all our supplies
had been cut off, my good wife and I got tired of dining twenty-one times
a week on fish diet, varied only by a pot of boiled musk rats, or a roast
hind-quarter of a wild cat. To improve our bill of fare, the next summer,
when I went into the Red River Settlement, I bought a sheep, which I
carefully took out with me in a little open boat. I succeeded in getting
it safely home, and put it in a yard that had a heavy stockade fence
twelve feet high around it. In some way the dogs got in and devoured my
sheep.</p>

<p>The next summer, I took out a couple of pigs, and put them into a
little log stable with a two-inch spruce plank door. To my great disgust,
one night the dogs ate a hole through the door and devoured my pigs.</p>

<p>There seemed to be a good deal of the wolf in their nature. Many of
them never manifested much affection for their masters, and never could
be fully depended upon. Still I always found that even with Esquimaux
dogs patience and kindness went farther than anything else in teaching
them to know what was required of them, and in inducing them to accept
the situation. Some of them are naturally lazy, and some of them are
incorrigible shirks; and so there is in dog-driving a capital opportunity
for the exercise of the cardinal virtue of patience.</p>

<p>As my Mission increased in size, and new appointments were taken up, I
found I should have to be on the move nearly all the winter if those who
longed for the Word of Life were to be visited. Do the best I could,
there were some bands so remote that I could only visit them twice a
year. In summer I went by canoe, and in winter by dog-train. After a few
wretched experiences with native dogs, where I suffered most intensely,
as much on account of their inferior powers as anything else, I began to
think of the many splendid St. Bernard and Newfoundland dogs I had seen
in civilised lands, doing nothing in return for the care and affection
lavished upon them. These thoughts, which came to me while far from home,
were promptly followed by action as soon as that terrible trip was ended,
in which every part of my face exposed to the intense cold had been
frozen, even to my eyebrows and lips.</p>

<p>Missionary Secretaries were amused at the requisition for dogs, and
had their laugh at what they called &ldquo;my unique request,&rdquo; and
wrote me to that effect. Thanks, however, to the kindness of such men as
the Hon. Mr Sanford, of Hamilton, the Hon. Mr Ferrier, of Montreal, and
other friends, I had in my possession some splendid dogs before the next
season opened, and then the work went on with increasing interest and
satisfaction. With splendid, well-trained dogs, I could so shorten the
time of the three hundred miles' trip, that, instead of shivering seven
or eight nights in a hole dug in the snow, we could reduce the number to
four or five.</p>

<p>Those who have experienced the sufferings and hardships of camping out
in the forest with the temperature ranging from thirty to sixty degrees
below zero, will agree that to escape two or three nights of it meant a
good deal.</p>

<p>I found by years of experience that the St. Bernard and Newfoundland
dogs had all the good qualities, and none of the defects, of the
Esquimaux. By kindness and firmness they were easily broken in, and then
a whip was only an ornamental appendage of the driver's picturesque
costume. Of these splendid dogs I often had in my possession, counting
old and young, as many as twenty at a time. The largest and best of them
all was Jack, a noble St. Bernard. He was black as jet, and stood over
thirty-three inches high at his fore shoulder. When in good working trim,
he weighed about a hundred and sixty pounds. He had no equal in all that
northern land. Several times he saved my life, as we shall see further
on. No whip ever ruffled his glossy coat; no danger ever deterred him
from his work, when he with his marvellous intelligence once got to know
what was expected of him. No blizzard storm, no matter how fickle and
changeful, could lead him off from the desired camping place, even if the
courage of other dogs failed them, and even though the guides gave up in
despair.</p>

<p>The distance we could travel with dogs depended of course very much on
the character of the trail or route. On the frozen surface of Lake
Winnipeg, when no blinding gales opposed us, and our dogs were good and
loads not too heavy, we have made from seventy to ninety miles a day. One
winter I accomplished the journey from Fort Garry to Norway House in five
days and a half &mdash; a distance of nearly four hundred miles. When we
were toiling along in the dense forests, where the snow lay deep and the
obstructions were many, and the country was broken with hills and
ravines, we often did not make more than a third of that distance, and
then suffered much more than when we had made much greater journeys under
more favourable auspices.</p>

<p>The dog sleds are made of two oak or birch boards, about twelve feet
long, eight or nine inches wide, and from half an inch to an inch thick.
These two boards are fastened securely together, edge to edge, by
crossbars. Then one of the ends is planed down thin, and so thoroughly
steamed or soaked in hot water that it can easily be bent or curved up to
form what is called the head of the sled. It is then planed smooth, and
fitted out with side loops. The front ones are those to which the traces
of the dogs are attached, and the others along the sides are used to
fasten the load securely. When finished, allowing two or three feet for
the curled-up head, a good dog sled is nine or ten feet long, and from
sixteen to eighteen inches wide.</p>

<p>Sometimes they are fitted with parchment sides and a comfortable back.
Then they are called carioles. When the dogs were strong enough, or the
trail was a well beaten one, or we were travelling on the great frozen
lakes, I was able to ride the greater part of the time. Then it was not
unpleasant or toilsome work. But as many of my winter trails led me
through the primeval forests, where the snow was often very deep, and the
hills were steep, and the fallen trees many, and the standing ones
thickly clustered together, on such journeys there was but little riding.
One had to strap on his snow shoes, and help his faithful Indians to
tramp down the deep snow in the trail, that the poor dogs might drag the
heavily loaded sleds along.</p>

<p>Four dogs constitute a train. They are harnessed in tandem style, as
all this vast country north of the fertile prairies is a region of
forests. The Esquimaux style of giving each dog a separate trace, thus
letting them spread out in a fan-like form, would never do in this land
of trees and dense under-bush.</p>

<p>The harness, which is made of moose skin, is often decorated with
ribbons and little musical bells. Singular as it may appear, the dogs
were very fond of the bells, and always seemed to travel better and be in
greater spirits when they could dash along in unison with their tinkling.
Some dogs could not be more severely punished than by taking the bells
off their harness.</p>

<p>The head dog of the train is called &ldquo;the leader.&rdquo; Upon him
depends a great deal of the comfort and success, and at times the safety,
of the whole party. A really good leader is a very valuable animal. Some
of them are so intelligent that they do not require a guide to run ahead
of them, except in the most dense and unbeaten forest trails. I had a
long-legged white dog, of mixed breed, that ever seemed to consider a
guide a nuisance, when once he had got into his big head an idea of what
I wanted him to do. Outside of his harness Old Voyager, as we called him,
was a morose, sullen, unsociable brute. So hard to approach was he that
generally a rope about sixty feet long, with one end fastened around his
neck, trailed out behind him. When we wanted to catch him, we generally
had to start off in the opposite direction from him, for he was as
cunning as a fox, and ever objected to being caught. In zigzag ways we
moved about until he was thrown off his guard, and then by-and-by it was
possible to come near enough to get hold of the long rope and haul him
in. When once the collar was on his neck, and he had taken his place at
the head of the party, he was the unrivalled leader. No matter how many
trains might happen to be travelling together, no one thought of taking
first place while Old Voyager was at hand.</p>

<p>Lake Winnipeg is very much indented with deep, wide bays. The
headlands are from five to thirty miles apart. When dog-travelling on
that great lake in winter, the general plan is to travel from headland to
headland. When leaving one where perhaps we had slept or dined, all we
had to do was to turn Old Voyager's head in the right direction, and show
him the distant point to which we wished to go; and although it might be
many miles away, a surveyor's line could not be much straighter than the
trail our sleds would make under his unerring guidance.</p>

<p>I have gone into these details about this mode of travelling, because
there is so little known about it in the outside world. Doubtless it will
soon become a thing of the past, as the Indians are settling down in
their Reservations, and, each tribe or band having a resident Missionary,
these long, toilsome journeys will not be essential.</p>

<p>The companions of my long trips were the far-famed Indian runners of
the north. The principal one of our party was called &ldquo;the
guide.&rdquo; To him was committed the responsibility of leading us by
the quickest and safest route to the band of Indians we wished to visit
with the good news of a Saviour's love. His place was in front of the
dogs, unless the way happened to lead us for a time over frozen lakes or
well-beaten trails, where the dogs were able to go on alone, cheered by
the voice of their drivers behind. When the trail was of this
description, the guide generally strode along in company with one of the
drivers.</p>

<p>As the greater part of my work was in the wild forest regions, there
were many trips when the guide was always at the front. Marvellously
gifted were some of these men. The reader must bear in mind the fact that
there were no roads or vestiges of a path. Often the whole distance we
wished to go was through the dense unbroken forest. The snow, some
winters, was from two to four feet deep. Often the trees were clustered
so closely together that it was at times difficult to find them standing
far enough apart to get our sleds, narrow as they were, between them. In
many places the under-brush was so dense that it was laborious work to
force our way through it. Yet the guide on his large snowshoes was
expected to push on through all obstructions, and open the way where it
was possible for the dog-sleds to follow. His chief work was to mark out
the trail, along which the rest of us travelled as rapidly as our loaded
sleds, or wearied limbs, and often bleeding feet, would allow.</p>

<p>Wonderfully clever and active were these guides in this difficult and
trying work. To them it made but little difference whether the sun shone
brightly, or clouds obscured the sky. On and on they pushed without
hesitancy or delay. There were times when the sun's rays were reflected
with such splendour from the snowy wastes, that our eyes became so
affected by the glare, that it was impossible to travel by sunlight. The
black eyes of the Indians seemed very susceptible to this disease, which
they call &ldquo;snow blindness.&rdquo; It is very painful, as I know by
sad experience. The sensation is like that of having red-hot sand thrown
on the eyeballs. Often my faithful dog-drivers used to suffer so from it
that, stoical as they naturally are, I have known them to groan and
almost cry out like children in the camp.</p>

<p>Once, in travelling near Oxford Lake, we came across a couple of
Indians who were stone-blind from this disease. Fortunately they had been
able to reach the woods and make a camp and get some food ready ere total
blindness came upon them. We went out of our course to guide them to
their friends.</p>

<p>To guard against the attack of this disease, which seldom occurs
except in the months of March and April, when the increasing brightness
of the sun, in those lengthening days, makes its rays so powerful, we
often travelled only during the night-time, and rested in the sheltered
camps during the hours of sunshine. On some of our long trips we have
travelled eight nights continuously in this way. We generally left our
camp about sundown. At midnight we groped about as well as we could,
aided by the light of the stars or the brilliant auroras, and found some
dry wood and birch bark, with which we made a fire and cooked a midnight
dinner. Then on we went until the morning light came. Then a regular camp
was prepared, and breakfast cooked and eaten, and the dogs were fed,
instead of at night. Prayers said, and ourselves wrapped up in our
blankets and robes, we slept until the hours of brilliant sunshine were
over, when on we went.</p>

<p>It always seemed to me that the work of the guides would be much more
difficult at night than during the daytime. They, however, did not think
so. With unerring accuracy they pushed on. It made no matter to them
whether the stars shone out in all the beauty and brilliancy of the
Arctic sky, or whether clouds arose and obscured them all. On the guide
pushed through tangled underwood or dense gloomy forest, where there were
not to be seen, for days, or rather nights, together, any other tracks
than those made by the wild beasts of the forest.</p>

<p>Sometimes the wondrous auroras blazed out, flashing and scintillating
with a splendour indescribable. At times the whole heavens seemed aglow
with their fickle, inconstant beauty, and then various portions of the
sky were illumined in succession by their ever-changing bars, or columns
of coloured light. Man's mightiest pyrotechnic displays dwarfed into
insignificance in the presence of these celestial visions. For hours at a
time have I been entranced amidst their glories. So bewildering were they
at times to me that I have lost all ideas of location, and knew not which
was north or south.</p>

<p>But to the experienced guide, although, like many of the Indians, he
had a keen appreciation of the beauties of nature, so intent was he on
his duties that these changing auroras made no difference, and caused him
no bewilderment in his work. This, to me, was often a matter of surprise.
They are very susceptible in their natures, and their souls are full of
poetry, as many of their expressive and beautiful names indicate. To
them, in their pagan state, those scintillating bars of coloured light
were the spirits of their forefathers, rank after rank, rushing out to
battle. Yet, while on our long trips I have had Indians as guides who
became intensely interested in these wondrous visions of the night, I
never knew them to lose the trail or become confused as to the proper
route.</p>

<p>Very pleasant are my memories of different guides and dog-drivers.
With very few exceptions they served me loyally and well. Most of them
were devoted Christian men. With me they rejoiced to go on these long
journeys to their countrymen who were still groping in the darkness, but
most of them longing for the light. Many of them were capable of giving
exhortations or addresses; and if not able to do this, they could,
Paul-like, tell the story of their conversion, and how they had found the
Saviour.</p>

<p>My heart warms to those faithful men, my companions in many a storm,
my bed-fellows in many a cold wintry camp. Memory brings up many
incidents where they risked their lives for me, and where, when food was
about exhausted, and the possibilities of obtaining additional supplies
for days were very poor, they quietly and unostentatiously put themselves
on quarter rations, for days together, that their beloved missionary
might not starve.</p>

<p>Some of them have finished their course. Up the shining trail,
following the unerring Guide, they have gone beyond the auroras and
beyond the stars right to the throne of God.</p>

trail.</a></h3>

<p>In January, 1869, I started on my first winter trip to Nelson River,
to visit a band of Indians there, who had never yet seen a missionary or
heard the glad tidings of salvation. Their principal gatherings were at
the little trading post on the Burntwood River. Their hunting grounds
extended so very far north that they bordered on those of the Esquimaux,
with whom, however, the Indians have no dealings. Between these two
races, the Indian and the Esquimaux, there is no affinity whatever. They
differ very materially in appearance, language, customs, and beliefs.
Though they will seldom engage in open hostilities, yet they are very
rarely at peace with each other, and generally strive to keep as far
apart as possible.</p>

<p>The weather was bitterly cold, as the temperature ranged from
thirty-five to fifty-five below zero. Our course was due north all the
way. The road we made, for there was none ahead of the snow-shoe tracks
of our guide, was a rugged, unbroken forest path. As the country through
which we passed is rich in fur-bearing animals, we saw many evidences of
their presence, and occasionally crossed a hunter's trail. We passed over
twenty little lakes, averaging from one to thirty miles in diameter. Over
these our dogs drew us very fast, and we could indulge in the luxury of a
ride; but in the portages and wood-roads our progress was very slow, and
generally all of us, with our snow-shoes on, and at times with axes in
hand, had to tramp on ahead and pack the deep snow down, and occasionally
cut out an obstructing log, that our dogs might be able to drag our
heavily laden sleds along. Sometimes the trees were so thickly clustered
together that it was almost impossible to get our sleds through them. At
times we were testing our agility by climbing over fallen trees, and then
on our hands and knees had to crawl under reclining ones. Our faces were
often bleeding, and our feet bruised. There were times when the strap of
my snowshoes so frayed and lacerated my feet that the blood soaked
through the moccasins and webbing of the snowshoes, and occasionally the
trail was marked with blood. We always travelled in Indian file. At the
head ran or walked the guide, as the roads would permit. On these trips,
when I got to understand dog-driving, I generally followed next; and
behind me were three other dog-trains, each with an Indian driver.</p>

<p>Sometimes the snow was so deep that the four dog-drivers went ahead of
the dogs, immediately behind the guide, and, keeping in line with him,
industriously packed down the snow, that the dogs might the more easily
drag the heavy sleds along. The reason why our loads were so heavy was
this. We were not in a country where, when night overtook us, we could
find some hospitable home to welcome us. Neither were we where there were
hotels or houses in which for money we could secure lodgings. We were in
one of the most desolate and thinly inhabited parts of the world, where
those who travel long distances see no human beings, except the Indian
hunters, and these but rarely. Hence, in spite of all our efforts to make
our loads as light as possible, they would be heavy, although we were
only carrying what was considered absolutely essential. We had to take
our provisions, fish for our dogs, kettles, tin dishes, axes, bedding,
guns, extra clothing, and various other things, to meet emergencies that
might arise.</p>

<p>The heaviest item on our sleds was the fish for the dogs. Each dog was
fed once a day, and then received two good white fishes, each weighing
from four to six pounds. So that if the daily allowance for each dog
averaged five pounds, the fish alone on each sled would weigh one hundred
and twenty pounds, when we began a trip of a week's duration. Then the
bitter cold and the vigorous exercise gave both the drivers and the
missionary good appetites, and so the food provided for them was of no
insignificant weight.</p>

<p>We generally stopped about half an hour before sundown in order to
have time, ere darkness enshrouded us, to prepare our camp. As we
journeyed on we had observed that the guide who had been running along in
front had been, for the last half hour or so, carefully scanning the
forest to the right and left. At length he stopped, and as we came up to
him we said, &ldquo;Well, Tom, what is the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>His answer is, &ldquo;Here is a capital place for our camp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you think so?&rdquo; we ask.</p>

<p>He replies, &ldquo;Do you see those balsams? They will furnish us with
a bed, and this cluster of dry, dead small trees will give us the wood we
need for our fire.&rdquo; So we quickly set to work to prepare for our
all-night stay in the woods.</p>

<p>The dogs were soon unharnessed, and seemed thankful to get their heads
out of their collars. They were never tied up, neither did they ever
desert us, or take the back track for home. Some of the younger ones
often organised a rabbit hunt on their own responsibility, and had some
sport. The older and wiser ones looked around for the most cosy and
sheltered spots, and there began to prepare their resting-places for the
night. They would carefully scrape away the snow until they came to the
ground, and there, with teeth and paws, would make the spot as smooth and
even as possible. They would then curl themselves up, and patiently wait
until they were called to supper. After unharnessing our dogs, our next
work was with our axes, and there was a good sharp one for the
Missionary, to cut down some of the green balsams and dry dead trees.
Then using our snowshoes as shovels, from the place selected for our camp
we soon scraped away the snow, piling it up as well as we could to the
right, left, and in rear of where we were to sleep. On the ground thus
cleared of snow we spread out a layer of the balsam boughs, and in front,
where the wind would blow the smoke from us, we made up a large fire with
the small dry trees which we had cut down.</p>

<p>On this blazing log fire we put our two kettles, which we had filled
with snow. When it melted down, we refilled the kettles, until enough
water was secured. In the large kettle we boiled a piece of fat meat, of
goodly size, and in the other we made our tea.</p>

<p>On my first trip I carried with me a tin basin, a towel, and a cake of
soap. At our first camp-fire, when the snow had been melted in our
kettle, I asked the guide to give me a little of the water in my basin.
Suspecting the purpose for which I wanted it, he said, &ldquo;What are
you going to do with it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wash my face and hands,&rdquo; I replied.</p>

<p>Very earnestly he answered, &ldquo;Please, Missionary, do not do
so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was longing for a good wash, for I felt like a chimney-sweep. We had
been travelling for hours through a region of country where, in the
previous summer, great forest fires had raged, leaving many of the trunks
of the trees charred and black. Against some of them we had often rubbed,
and to some of them, or their branches, we had had to cling as we went
dashing down some of the ravines. The result of these weary hours of toil
amidst charred trunks was very visible, and I rejoiced that an
opportunity had arrived when I could wash off the sooty stuff. Great
indeed was my surprise to hear this strong protest on the part of my
guide against my doing anything of the kind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should I not wash?&rdquo; I said, holding up my blackened
hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must not let water touch you out in the open air, when it
is so very cold as it is to-day,&rdquo; was his answer.</p>

<p>I was very inexperienced then, and not willing to lose my wash, which
I so much needed, I did not heed the warning. Having a blazing fire
before me and a good dry towel, I ventured to take the wash, and for a
minute or two after felt much better. Soon, however, there were strange
prickling sensations on the tops of my hands, and then they began to chap
and bleed, and they became very sore, and did not get well for weeks. The
one experiment of washing in the open air with the temperature in the
fifties below zero was quite enough. In the following years I left the
soap at home and only carried the towel. When very much in need of a
wash, I had to be content with a dry rub with the towel. Mrs Young used
to say, when I returned from some of these trips, that I looked like old
mahogany. The bath was then considered a much-needed luxury.</p>

<p>For our food, when travelling in such cold weather, we preferred the
fattest meat we could obtain. From personal experience I can endorse the
statements of Arctic explorers about the value of fat or oil and blubber
as articles of food, and the natural craving of the system for them.
Nothing else seemed to supply the same amount of internal heat. As the
result of experience, we carried the fattest kind of meat.</p>

<p>As soon as the snow was melted down in the larger of our kettles, meat
sufficient for our party was soon put on and boiled. While it was
cooking, we thawed out the frozen fish for our dogs. Such is the effect
of the frost that they were as hard as stone, and it would have been
cruel to have given them in that state to the noble animals that served
us so well. Our plan was to put down a small log in front of the fire, so
close to it that when the fish were placed against it, the intensity of
the heat would soon thaw them out. The hungry dogs were ever sharp enough
to know when their supper was being prepared; and as it was the only meal
of the day for them, they crowded around us and were impatient at times,
and had to be restrained.</p>

<p>Sometimes, in their eagerness and anxiety for their food &mdash; for
it often required a long time for the fire to thaw the fishes
sufficiently for us to bend them &mdash; the dogs in crowding one before
the other would get into a fight, and then there would be trouble. Two
dogs of the same train very seldom fought with each other. Yoke-fellows
in toil, they were too wise to try to injure each other in needless
conflict. So, when a battle began, the dogs quickly ranged themselves on
the sides of their own comrades, and soon it was a conflict of train
against train. At first I thought it cruel not to feed them more
frequently, but I found, as all experienced dog-drivers had told me, that
one good meal a day was the best for them. So great were my sympathies
for them that sometimes I would give them a good breakfast in the
morning; but it did not turn out to be of any real benefit. The
additional meal made them sluggish and short-winded, and they did not
seem to thrive so well. Good white fish was the best food we could give
them, and on this diet they could thrive and work as on no other.</p>

<p>A goodly number of <i>dog-shoes</i> were very necessary on these wild,
rough trips. Dogs' feet are tender, and are liable to injury from various
causes. On the smooth glare ice the pads of the feet would sometimes wear
so thin that they bled a good deal. Then on the rough roads there was
always the danger of their breaking off a claw or running a sliver
through the webbing between the toes. Many of the wise old dogs that had
become accustomed to these shoes, and thus knew their value, would
suddenly stop the whole train, and by holding up an injured foot very
eloquently, if mutely, tell the reason why they had done so.</p>

<p>The dog-shoes are like heavy woollen mits without the thumbs, made in
different sizes. When a foot is injured, the mit is drawn on and securely
tied with a piece of soft deer-skin. Then the grateful dog, which perhaps
had refused to move before, springs to his work, often giving out his
joyous barks of gratitude. So fond do some of the dogs become of these
warm woollen shoes that instances are known where they have come into the
camp from their cold resting-places in the snow, and would not be content
until the men got up and put shoes on all of their feet. Then, with every
demonstration of gratitude, they have gone back to their holes in the
snow.</p>

<p>Our dogs having been fed, we next make our simple arrangements for our
own supper.</p>

<p>A number of balsam boughs are spread over the spot near the fires,
from which the snow has been scraped away by our snowshoes. On these is
laid our table-cloth, which was generally an empty flour bag, cut down
the side. Our dishes, all of tin, are placed in order, and around we
gather with vigorous appetites. It is fortunate that they are so good, as
otherwise our homely fare would not be much prized. The large piece of
fat meat is served up in a tin pan, and our pint cups are filled up with
hot tea. If we are fortunate enough to have some bread, which was far
from being always the case, we thaw it out and eat it with our meat.
Vegetables were unknown on these trips. Our great staple was fat meat,
and the fatter the better; morning, noon, and night, and often between
times did we stop and eat fat meat. If we did vary the <i>menu</i>, it
would be by making a raid on the dogs' supply, and in the evening camp
cooking ourselves a good kettle of fish.</p>

<p>As we dared not wash our hands or faces, of course such a thing as
washing dishes was unknown. When supper was in progress, Jack Frost made
us busy in keeping ourselves and provisions warm. I have seen the large
piece of meat put back into the pot three times during the one meal, to
warm it up. I have seen the ice gather on the top of the cup of tea that
a few minutes before was boiling vigorously in the kettle.</p>

<p>After supper wood was cut, to be in readiness for the morning's fire;
and every break in clothes or harness was repaired, that there might be
no delay in making a good start. Then the guide, who always had charge of
all these things, when satisfied that all was arranged, would say,
&ldquo;Missionary, we are ready for prayers.&rdquo; The Bible and
Hymn-book were brought out, and the Indians gathered round me, and there
together we offered up our evening devotions. Would that our readers
could have seen us! The background is of dense balsam trees, whose great
drooping branches, partially covered with snow, sweep the ground. Above
us are the bright stars, and, it may be, the flashing auroras. In front
of us is the blazing fire, and scattered around us, in picturesque
confusion, are our dog-sleds, snow-shoes, harness, and the other
essentials of our outfit. A few of the dogs generally insisted on
remaining up until their masters had retired, and they were now to be
seen in various postures around us. With uncovered heads, no matter how
intense the cold, my Christian Indians listened reverently, while in
their own language I read from the precious volume which they have
learned to love so well. Then together we sang a hymn. Frequently it
would be the Evening Hymn, the first verse of which in their beautiful
Cree language is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><br>
 &ldquo;Ne mahmechemon ne muntome<br>
 Kahke wastanahmahweyan,<br>
 Kah nah way yemin Kechabyah<br>
 Ah kwah-nahtahtah-kwahnaoon.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
</blockquote>

<p>After singing we bow in prayer. There is there, as there should be
everywhere, a consciousness of our dependence upon the great Helper for
protection and support, and so the prayer we sang:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><br>
 &ldquo;Keep me, O keep me, King of Kings,<br>
 Beneath Thine own Almighty wings.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
</blockquote>

<p>is indeed our heart's desire.</p>

<p>Sometimes we are a hundred and fifty miles from the nearest human
habitation. We are camping out in the woods in a hole dug in the snow. We
have no walls around us but the snow thrown out of the place in which we
are huddled, with perhaps the addition of some balsam boughs. We have no
roof above us but the stars. There in that place we are going to lie down
and try to sleep during that bitter cold night. The light fire will soon
go out. A foot of snow may fall upon us, and its coming will be welcomed,
as its warmth will lessen our shivering. Prowling grey wolves may come
near us, but the terrible Frost King is more to be feared than they.</p>

<p>Does anybody, who knows the efficacy of prayer, wonder that, as we
draw near to God, &ldquo;by prayer and supplication, with
thanksgiving,&rdquo; we crave the assurance of His favour and smile, and
that He, Who never slumbers or sleeps, will be our Guardian and our
Friend?</p>

<p>After prayers we soon <i>retire to rest</i>. The guide's familiar
words soon after prayers used to be, &ldquo;Now, Missionary, I will make
your bed.&rdquo; This was his work, and he was an adept at it. He first
spread out a layer of evergreen boughs, and then on these he laid a large
buffalo robe, and upon this a heavy blanket. Then, placing my pillow so
that my head would be farthest away from the fire, he would say to me,
&ldquo;Now, if you will get into bed, I will cover you up and tuck you
in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such a thing as disrobing out there in a wintry camp is unknown,
unless, as the result of the violent exercise of running all day, a
person's underclothing has become very damp by perspiration, and it is
not safe to sleep in it in that condition.</p>

<p>Some travellers sleep in a fur bag, in which they manage to insert
themselves, and then have it tightened around their necks. Then a large
fur hood over the usual head-gear completes their sleeping apparel. I
used to wrap myself up in a heavy overcoat over my usual apparel, and
then putting on long buffalo-skin boots, fur mits, cap, cape, and big
mufflers, considered myself rigged up for retiring. When thus wrapped, I
used to have some difficulty in getting down into the bed, although it
was only on the ground. When in position, the guide would throw over me
another heavy blanket and fur robe. Then very skilfully, and in a way
most motherly, he would begin at my feet and carefully tuck me in.
Rapidly and deftly did he proceed with his work, and almost before I was
aware of what he was doing, he had reached my head, which he began to
cover completely up with the heavy robe which he seemed to be crowding
down under my back and shoulders.</p>

<p>The first time he packed me in in this manner I was only able to stand
it for a minute or two, as I thought I should be smothered. So I very
suddenly threw up my arms and sent the whole upper covering off in a
hurry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you wish to smother me, man?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I cannot
live with my head covered up like that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without any annoyance at my having so quickly undone his work, he
replied very kindly, &ldquo;I know it must be hard work for you white
people to sleep with your heads completely covered up, but you will have
to do it here, or you will freeze to death. You must be very careful, for
this seems to be a very cold night indeed.&rdquo; Then he called my
attention to the distant thunder-like sounds which we had been hearing
occasionally during the evening. That, he told me, was the ice, from four
to six feet thick, on the great lake, cracking in the bitter cold.
&ldquo;Look at the smoke,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;See how it keeps very
near the ground. It does that in the bitter cold nights.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From the trees around us we heard occasionally a sharp pistol-like
report, loud enough at times to make a nervous person fancy that lurking
enemies were firing at us.</p>

<p>The observant Indians say these loud reports are burstings in the
trees caused by the freezing of the sap.</p>

<p>Admiring his cleverness and kindness, I told him that I had been
taught that every person requires so many cubic feet of fresh air; and,
cold or no cold, how did he think I could get my share with my head
covered up as he desired? &ldquo;You must do with less out here,&rdquo;
he said, as he proceeded to cover me up again, while I tried to arrange
myself so that I could at least have a small portion of air. Kindly and
patiently he humoured me, and then, when he had finished tucking me in,
he said, &ldquo;Now, Missionary, good-night; but don't stir. If you do,
you may disarrange your coverings while you sleep, and you may freeze to
death without waking up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't stir!&rdquo; What a command, I thought, to give a tired
traveller whose bones ache from his long snow-shoe tramping in the woods,
whose nerves and muscles are unstrung, and who, like others when thus
fatigued, has even found it helpful to his rest and comfort to turn
occasionally and stretch his limbs!</p>

<p>In this frame of mind, and under this order, which, after all, I felt
must be obeyed for fear of the dire results that might follow, I at
length managed to fall asleep, for I was very weary. After a while I woke
up to a state of semi-consciousness, and found myself tugging and pulling
at what I thought in my dreamy condition was the end of an axe handle.
The vague impression on my mind was, that some careless Indian had left
his axe just behind my head, and in the night the handle had fallen
across my face, and I had now got hold of the end of it. Fortunately for
me, I very quickly after this woke fully up, and then found out that what
I had imagined to be the end of an axe handle was my own nose; and a
badly frozen one it was, and both of my ears were about in the same
condition.</p>

<p>With the guide's last orders in my ears, I think I must have gone to
sleep all right, but I suppose, from the unusual smothering sensation,
unconsciously I must have pushed down the robes from my face, and
uncovered my head and my hand, and then gradually returned to
consciousness with the above results. However, after a few nights of this
severe kind of discipline, I at length became as able to sleep with my
head covered up as an Indian.</p>

<p>When a foot or eighteen inches of snow fell upon us, we rejoiced, for
it added to our comfort, and caused us to sleep the better. Under this
additional covering we generally rested a couple of hours longer than
usual, often to make up for the loss of sleep of the previous nights,
when we had found it impossible, or had considered it dangerous, to go to
sleep.</p>

<p>The hardest work and the most disagreeable is the getting up from such
a bed in such a place. Often, in spite of the intense cold, we are in a
kind of a clammy perspiration, on account of the many wraps and coverings
about us. As we throw off these outer garments, and spring up in our
camp, Jack Frost instantly assails us in a way that makes us shiver, and
often some are almost compelled to cry out in bitter anguish.</p>

<p>Fortunately the wood is always prepared the night before, and so, as
quickly as possible, a great roaring fire is built up, and our breakfast
of strong tea and fat meat is prepared and eaten with all speed.</p>

<p>There were times when the morning outlook was gloomy indeed, and our
position was not an enviable one. On one of my trips, of only a hundred
and eighty miles, in order to save expense, I only took with me one
companion, and he was a young Indian lad of about sixteen years of age.
We each had our own train of dogs, and as Old Voyager was leader we
guided him by voice alone, and he did not disappoint us. One morning,
when we sprang up from our wintry camp-bed, we found that several inches
of snow had fallen upon us during the night. As soon as possible we
arranged our wood in order and endeavoured to kindle our fire. We had
been late the previous evening in reaching this camping place, and so had
to grope around in the rapidly increasing darkness for our wood. It was
of very inferior quality, but as we had succeeded in cooking our suppers
with part of it, we had not anticipated any trouble with the rest. The
snow which had fallen upon it had not improved it, and so, as we lighted
match after match, we were at first disgusted, and then alarmed, at
finding that the poor stuff persistently refused to ignite. Of course we
had to take our hands out of our big fur mits when trying to light the
matches. Before we had succeeded in our attempts to start the fire our
hands began to chill, and soon they were so powerless that we were not
able to hold a match in our fingers. Very naturally we became alarmed,
but we persevered as long as possible. I remember that, taking one of the
matches between my teeth and holding up an axe before me, I tried to jerk
my head quick enough to light it in that way, but the experiment was not
a success.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came the consciousness that we were not far from
perishing if we could not make a fire. I quickly turned to my young
comrade, and saw by the look in his face that he also grasped the
situation, and was terrified at the outlook.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alec,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;this is a serious thing for
us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Missionary,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I am afraid we die
here. If we can make no fire and have no breakfast, I am afraid we will
freeze to death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so bad as that yet, Alec,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;God is our
refuge and help. He has given us other ways by which we can get warm. As
quickly as possible get on your snow-shoes, and up with your hood and on
with your mits, and I will do likewise, and now see if you can catch
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In much less time than I have taken to describe it, we were rigged up
for rapid snow-shoe running, and were off. Away I rushed through the
woods as rapidly as I could on my snow-shoes. The lad followed me, and
thus we ran chasing and catching each other alternately as though we were
a couple of boisterous schoolboys instead of a Missionary and his Indian
companion striving to save themselves from freezing to death.</p>

<p>After about half an hour of this most vigorous exercise, we felt the
warmth coming back to our bodies, and then the hot blood began working
its way out to our benumbed hands, and by-and-by we could bend our
fingers again. When we felt the comfortable glow of warmth over our whole
bodies, we rushed back again to the camp, and, gathering a quantity of
birch bark which we found loosely hanging from the trees, and which is
very inflammable, we soon had a good fire and then our hot breakfast. At
our morning devotions which followed there was a good deal of
thanksgiving, and the grateful spirit continued in our hearts as we
packed up our loads, harnessed up our dogs, and sped on our way. It was a
very narrow escape. The King of Terrors looked us both in the face that
cold morning, and very nearly chilled us into death by the icy fingers of
the Frost King.</p>

<p>As the hours of daylight in the winter months in these high latitudes
are so few, we generally roused ourselves up several hours before
daylight. Often my kind-hearted men endeavoured to get up first, and have
a rousing fire made and breakfast cooked, before I would awake. This,
however, did not occur very often, as such a bed was not conducive to
sleep; so, generally, after about four or five hours in such a state of
suffocation, I was thankful to get up the instant I heard any one
stirring. I would rather freeze to death than be suffocated.</p>

<p>There were times not a few when I was the first to get up, and kindle
the fire and cook the breakfast before I called my faithful wearied
companions, who, long accustomed to such hardships, could sleep on
soundly, where for me it was an absolute impossibility. Sometimes my men,
when thus aroused, would look up at the stars and say &ldquo;Assam
weputch,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;Very early.&rdquo; All I had to do
was to look gravely at my watch, and this satisfied them that it was all
right. The breakfast was quickly eaten, our prayers were said, our sleds
loaded, dogs captured and harnessed &mdash; with the Esquimaux ones this
was not always an easy task &mdash; and we were ready to start.</p>

<p>Before starting we generally threw the evergreen brush on which we had
slept on the fire, and by its ruddy, cheerful light began our day's
journey. When some mornings we made from twenty-five to forty miles
before sunrise, the Indians began to think the stars were about right
after all, and the Missionary's watch very fast. However, they were just
as willing to get on rapidly as I was, and so did not find fault with the
way in which I endeavoured to hurry our party along. I paid them extra
whenever the record of a trip was broken, and we could lessen the number
of nights in those open-air camps in the snow.</p>

<p>We were six days in making our first winter trip to Nelson River. In
after years we reduced it to four days. The trail is through one of the
finest fur-producing regions of the North-West. Here the wandering Indian
hunters make their living by trapping such animals as the black and
silver foxes, as well as the more common varieties of that animal. Here
are to be found otters, minks, martens, beavers, ermines, bears, wolves,
and many other kinds of the fur-bearing animals. Here the black bears are
very numerous. On one canoe trip one summer we saw no less than seven of
them, one of which we shot and lived on for several days.</p>

<p>Here come the adventurous fur traders to purchase these valuable
skins, and great fortunes have been made in the business. If, merely to
make money and get rich, men are willing to come and put up with the
hardships and privations of the country, what a disgrace to us if, for
their souls' sake, we are afraid to follow in these hunters' trail, or,
if need be, show them the way, that we may go with the glad story of a
Saviour's love!</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_9">Chapter Eight. Nelson River &mdash; A
demonstrative welcome &mdash; First religious service &mdash; A four
hours' sermon &mdash; The chief's eloquent reply &mdash; The old man with
grandchildren in his wigwam &mdash; &ldquo;Our Father&rdquo; &mdash;
&ldquo;Then we are brothers&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; &mdash;
&ldquo;Then why is the white brother so long time in coming with the
Gospel to his red brother?&rdquo; &mdash; Glorious successes.</a></h3>

<p>It was at my second visit to Nelson River that the work really
commenced. Through some unforeseen difficulty at the first visit, many of
the natives were away. Hunting is even at the best a precarious mode of
obtaining a livelihood. Then, as the movements of the herds of deer, upon
the flesh of which many of these Indians subsist for the greater part of
the year, are very erratic, it is often difficult to arrange for a place
of meeting, where food can be obtained in sufficient abundance while the
religious services are being held.</p>

<p>It used to be very discouraging, after having travelled for several
days together, either by canoe in summer, or dog-trains in winter, to
reach a certain place which had been arranged for meeting, and find very
few present. The deer, and other animals on which they had expected to
live, had gone in another direction, and the Indians had been obliged to
follow them.</p>

<p>Everything, however, favoured us on our second visit. We found over
fifty families camped at the place of meeting, and full of curiosity to
see the Missionary. They had all sorts of strange notions in their minds.
When Mr Rundle, of the English Wesleyan Church, first went among some of
the wild tribes of the great Saskatchewan country, with his open Bible,
preaching the wonderful Gospel truths, great was the excitement of the
people to know where this strange man had come from. So a great council
was summoned, and the conjurers were ordered to find out all about it.
After a great deal of drumming and dreaming and conjuring, they gravely
reported that this strange man with his wonderful book had been wrapped
up in an envelope, and had come down from the Great Spirit on a
rainbow!</p>

<p>The Nelson River Indians welcomed me very cordially, and were much
more demonstrative in their greetings than were any of the other tribes I
had visited, although I had had my share of strange welcomes. Here the
custom of handshaking was but little known, but the more ancient one of
kissing prevailed. Great indeed was my amazement when I found myself
surrounded by two hundred and fifty or three hundred wild Indians, men,
women, and children, whose faces seemed in blissful ignorance of soap and
water, but all waiting to kiss me. I felt unable to stand the ordeal, and
so I managed to put them off with a shake of the hand, and a kind word or
two.</p>

<p>At eight o'clock the next morning we called the Indians together for
the first public religious service which most of them had ever attended.
They were intensely interested. My Christian Indians from Norway House
aided me in the opening services, and, being sweet singers, added very
much to the interest. We sang several hymns, read a couple of lessons
from the Bible, and engaged in prayer. At about nine o'clock I read as my
text those sublime words: &ldquo;For God so loved the world, that He gave
His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish,
but have everlasting life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They listened with the most enrapt attention, while for four hours I
talked to them of some of the truths of this glorious verse. They had
never heard a sermon before; they were ignorant of the simplest truths of
our blessed Christianity; and so I had to make everything plain and clear
as I went along. I could not take anything for granted with that
audience. So I had to take them back to the Creation and Fall. Then I
spoke of God's love in providence and grace; and of His greatest act of
love, the gift of His only begotten beloved Son, the Lord Jesus Christ,
Who died that we might live. I dwelt on the benefits which come to us
from the personal acceptance of this Saviour. I tried hard to show how
we, who had wandered so far away, were invited back to actual adoption
into God's great family, as a conscious reality. I spoke of the
universality and impartiality of God's love; of His willingness to
receive all, to fill our hearts with joy and peace, to comfort us all
through life, to sustain us in death, and then to take us to everlasting
life in a world of light and glory.</p>

<p>The ever-blessed Spirit most graciously applied the truth, as I tried,
in the simplest and plainest way, to bring it down to their
comprehension. The attention they gave showed that my words were being
understood. Their, bright eyes glistened and at times were suffused with
tears, and as I closed the long-pent-up silence gave place to loud
exclamations of delight.</p>

<p>Then we translated into their language and sang part of the good old
hymn:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><br>
 &ldquo;O for a thousand tongues to sing<br>
         My great Redeemer's praise,<br>
 The glories of my God and King,<br>
         The triumphs of His grace!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
</blockquote>

<p>Again we bowed in prayer, and, at my request, they repeated after me
all the petitions which in short easy sentences we offered up to Him Who
is the Hearer and Answerer of prayer. A spirit of awe and solemnity
seemed to rest upon us. It was the first time the great majority had ever
attempted to pray in the Name of Jesus, and I felt a sweet assurance that
those simple petitions, from the hearts and lips of those poor Indians,
were not despised by Him Whose great heart of love beats so true to all.
After prayer I requested them all to again seat themselves on the ground,
as I wished to hear from them about these great truths which I had come
so far to tell them of. I wanted to know what were their wishes and
determinations about becoming Christians. When I had finished, every eye
turned towards the principal chief, as these Indians, like the other
tribes, have their unwritten laws of precedence. He rose up from his
place among his people, and, coming near me on my right hand, he made one
of the most thrilling addresses I ever heard. Years have passed away
since that hour, and yet the memory of that tall, straight, impassioned
Indian is as vivid as ever. His actions were many, but all were graceful.
His voice was particularly fine and full of pathos, for he spoke from his
heart. Here is the bare outline of his speech, as, with my interpreter to
aid me, I shortly afterwards wrote it down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Missionary, I have long lost faith in our old paganism.&rdquo;
Then pointing down to the outer edge of the audience, where some old
conjurers and medicine men were seated, he said, &ldquo;They know I have
not cared for our old religion. I have neglected it. And I will tell you,
Missionary, why I have not believed in our old paganism for a long time.
I hear God in the thunder, in the tempest, and in the storm; I see His
power in the lightning that shivers the tree into kindling wood; I see
His goodness in giving us the moose, the reindeer, the beaver, and the
bear; I see His loving-kindness in giving us, when the south winds blow,
the ducks and geese; and when the snow and ice melt away, and our lakes
and rivers are open again, I see how He fills them with fish. I have
watched these things for years, and I see how during every moon of the
year He gives us something; and so He has arranged it, that if we are
only industrious and careful, we can always have something to eat. So
thinking about these things which I had observed, I made up my mind years
ago, that this Great Spirit, so kind and so watchful and so loving, did
not care for the beating of the conjurer's drum, or the shaking of the
rattle of the medicine man. So I for years have had no
religion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then turning towards me and looking me in the face, he said, in tones
that thrilled me, &ldquo;Missionary, what you have said to-day fills up
my heart and satisfies all its longings. It is just what I have been
expecting to hear about the Great Spirit. I am so glad you have come with
this wonderful story. Stay as long as you can; and when you have to go
away, do not forget us, but come again as soon as you can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loud expressions of approval greeted these words of the chief. When he
had finished, I said, &ldquo;I want to hear from others, and I want your
own views on these important things.&rdquo; Many responded to my request,
and, with the exception of an old conjurer or two, who feared for their
occupation, all spoke in the same strain as did the head chief. The last
to speak was an old man with grizzly hair, and wild, excited movements.
He was a queer, savage-looking man, and came from the rear of the company
to the front with strange springy movements. His hair was braided, and
reached to his knees. Threading his way through the audience, he came up
close to me, and then, pushing his fingers into his hair as far as its
braided condition would allow, he exclaimed in a tone full of
earnestness, &ldquo;Missionary, once my hair was as black as a crow's
wing, now it is getting white. Grey hairs here, and grandchildren in the
wigwam, tell me that I am getting to be an old man; and yet I never
before heard such things as you have told us to-day. I am so glad I did
not die before I heard this wonderful story. Yet I am getting old. Grey
hairs here, and grandchildren yonder, tell the story. Stay as long as you
can, Missionary, tell us much of these things, and when you have to go
away, come back soon, for I have grandchildren, and I have grey hairs,
and may not live many winters more. Do come back soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned as though he would go back to his place and sit down; but he
only went a step or two ere he turned round and faced me, and said,
&ldquo;Missionary, may I say more?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Talk on,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I am here now to
listen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You said just now, 'Notawenan.'&ldquo; (&ldquo;Our
Father.&rdquo;)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I did say, 'Our Father.'&ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is very new and sweet to us,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We
never thought of the Great Spirit as Father: we heard Him in the thunder,
and saw Him in the lightning, and tempest; and blizzard, and we were
afraid. So, when you tell us of the Great Spirit as Father, that is very
beautiful to us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hesitating a moment, he stood there, a wild, picturesque Indian, yet
my heart had strangely gone out in loving interest and sympathy to
him.</p>

<p>Lifting up his eyes to mine, again he said, &ldquo;May I say
more?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;say on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You say, 'Notawenan'.&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>Our</i> Father").
&ldquo;He is your Father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, He is my Father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he said, while his eyes and voice yearned for the answer,
&ldquo;Does it mean He is my Father &mdash; poor Indian's
Father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, O yes!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;He is your Father
too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Father &mdash; missionary's Father, and Indian's Father,
too!&rdquo; he repeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is true,&rdquo; I answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we are brothers?&rdquo; he almost shouted out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we are brothers,&rdquo; I replied. The excitement in the
audience had become something wonderful. When our conversation with the
old man had reached this point, and in such an unexpected, and yet
dramatic manner, had so clearly brought out, not only the Fatherhood of
God, but the oneness of the human family, the people could hardly
restrain their expressions of delight. The old man, however, had not yet
finished, and so, quietly restraining the most demonstrative ones, he
again turned to me, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I say more?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, say on; say all that is in your heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Never can I forget his answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I do not want to be rude, but it does seem to me that
you, my white brother, have been a long time in coming with that great
Book and its wonderful story, to tell it to your red brothers in the
woods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This question thrilled me, and I found it hard to answer. This is the
question that millions of weary, longing, waiting souls, dissatisfied
with their false religions, and craving for that soul rest which only can
be found in the hearty acceptance of the glorious Gospel of the Son of
God, are asking. I tried to apologise for the slowness of the advancement
of the Redeemer's kingdom, and the apathy of those who, while
acknowledging the brotherhood of humanity, so often forget that they are
their brother's keeper.</p>

<p>We closed the service for a brief period, and then, as soon as a
hurried dinner had been eaten, we all assembled again for the afternoon
service. This second service lasted for five hours. After singing and
prayer, I read the beautiful story of the Ethiopian eunuch, and the
Baptismal Service. I endeavoured to explain what we meant by becoming
Christians, and stated that I was willing to baptize all who would
renounce their paganism, with its polygamy, conjuring, gambling, and
other vices, and from that time begin to worship the true God. Polygamy
was the greatest stumbling-block among them, as some of them had three or
four wives. Intemperance here is but little known, on account perhaps of
the great difficulty of importing liquor into a region so remote from
civilisation.</p>

<p>After I had spent a long time in making clear the doctrines or the
blessed Book, and had answered many questions, I invited all who were
willing to comply with these conditions, and desired baptism, to come to
the front of the audience, where I was standing.</p>

<p>About forty men and women immediately responded, and came forward and
seated themselves at my feet. Some were trembling, others were weeping:
all seemed deeply moved. Then I read the beautiful Scripture lessons in
connection with the baptismal service for children, and dwelt upon the
love of Jesus for children, and His willingness to receive them. I
invited the parents to consecrate their children to God, even if they
themselves were as yet undecided. We had a solemn and impressive
time.</p>

<p>All desired new names, and for the great majority I had to make the
selection. While baptizing them and selecting Christian names as
additions to their generally poetic and expressive Indian names, my
constant prayer was, that they might &ldquo;see His face, and His
name&rdquo; be Written &ldquo;in their foreheads.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still there was some opposition. Satan would not thus easily be
dispossessed or driven out. Old conjurers and medicine men, faithful
followers of the enemy, quickly began their opposition. Their selfish
natures were aroused. They were shrewd enough to see that if I succeeded,
as I was likely to do, they, like Demetrius, the shrine-maker of Diana,
would soon be without an occupation. So at this afternoon gathering they
were there to oppose. But they were in such a helpless minority that they
dared do no worse than storm and threaten. One savage old conjurer rushed
up to me, just as I was about to baptize his wife, who, with many others,
had come for this sign and seal of her acceptance of Christ. Before I had
perceived his purpose, or had power to stop him, he seized and shook her
roughly, and, looking at me, in his impotent wrath, said in an insulting
manner,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Call her Atim.&rdquo; (&ldquo;dog").</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said, looking kindly at the poor trembling woman,
&ldquo;I will do nothing of the kind; but I will give her the sweetest
name ever borne by woman, for it was the name of the mother of
Jesus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So I baptized her Mary.</p>

<p>We spent several days in giving lessons in the Syllabic characters
between the religious services, three of which we endeavoured to hold
each day. Sometimes we assembled all the people together, and, with these
characters marked on the side of a rock with a burnt stick, we taught
them as best we could. At other times we went from tent to tent, and gave
them lessons, and had religious conversation and prayer.</p>

<p>It was on one of these rounds of wigwam visitations that I came across
Pe-pe-qua-na-pua, or Sandy Harte, the story of whose life and conversion
has been so widely circulated. Several acquired such a knowledge of these
characters that, by persevering for a few weeks, they were able to read
very nicely in the blessed Book.</p>

<p>I left with them several dozen copies of the New Testament,
Hymn-books, and Catechisms, in their own language.</p>

<p>So great was their anxiety for religious instruction, that many of
them remained for three days after they had eaten all of their
provisions. When I first heard this, I could hardly credit it, but found
out by personal investigation that it was the actual fact. With tears in
their eyes they bade me farewell, and said, that on account of their
famishing children they must start off for their fishing and hunting
grounds. But they added, &ldquo;What we have heard from you will make us
glad and thankful all the time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With my faithful travelling companions, I made a trip out from Nelson
River to another small band about thirty miles away. We spent the Sabbath
in a miserable wigwam, where the snow and sleet dashed in upon us, making
us shiver in spite of all we could do. Still, as the poor Indians were
anxious to hear the Gospel, we soon forgot our physical discomforts in
the joy of preaching this great salvation. Nineteen of them accepted
Christ as their Saviour, and were baptized. We held a meeting for the
purpose of hearing them tell of their wishes as to this blessed religion.
Many very interesting things were said. We here record only one.</p>

<p>A fine-looking man said, &ldquo;What has fully decided me to endeavour
to be a good Christian all my days is this. The Missionary has told us
many reasons, all sufficient to decide us; but the one that came very
near to my heart was, that all the little children who have died have
been taken to that better land, and there they are with the loving
Saviour in heaven. My little ones have passed away, leaving my heart sore
and bleeding. I yearn after them; I long to meet them again. So I want so
to live that when I die Jesus will permit me to embrace them, and never
be separated from them again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On this trip, we found at another small encampment a young girl, about
twelve years of age, dying of consumption. I talked to her of Jesus and
heaven, and prayed with her several times. When the closing scene drew
near, she said to her sorrowing mother, &ldquo;I am glad the praying man
has told me such words of comfort. I have lost that dread of death I had.
I believe that dear Jesus will take me to that better land; but, mother,
when you come, will you look for me until you find me? for I do wish to
see you again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Is it any wonder that I became deeply attached to these Nelson River
Indians? I visited them twice a year, and by pen and voice pleaded for
them until my heart's desire was obtained, and a brother beloved
volunteered to go and live among them. Of him with joy I write.</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_10">Chapter Nine. A welcome accession
&mdash; The Rev. John Semmens &mdash; A devoted young missionary &mdash;
First to reside At Nelson River &mdash; In labours and in perils oft
&mdash; In journeyings oft by dog-trains together &mdash; The centenarian
old Christian &mdash; William Papanekis &mdash; His godly life and
wondrous translation.</a></h3>

<p>One cold wintry morning we were gladdened by the arrival of a dear
brother and colleague in the work, the Rev. John Semmens, who had left a
comfortable charge in Ontario, and had come out to help me in the
prosecution of the blessed work. Brother Semmens had to taste, early in
his missionary work among the Indians, some of the dangers incident to
such a life. He came to us at Norway House in the depth of the winter,
and suffered much from the intense cold and blizzard storms. One night,
while trying to rest in the camp in the woods on his way out, a fierce
storm blew down a large tree, which fell very close to him.
Providentially no one was hurt.</p>

<p>He soon became very popular among the Indians, for whom he
subsequently gave many years of successful, self-denying toil. His
presence with us in our home was a great joy. None but those who have
been deprived of the pleasure of the society and fellowship of kindred
spirits can realise what a benediction this sweet-spirited and devoted
young brother was in our home. With one great object before us, that of
doing the greatest possible good we could to the Indians among whom we
were called to labour, and fortunately seeing &ldquo;eye to eye&rdquo; as
to the methods of our work, we spent some months and broken years in
harmony in doing what we could.</p>

<p>Brother Semmens' name will ever be associated with the Nelson River
Mission, as he was the first missionary to go and live in that region of
country and among those wandering Aborigines, who had received me with
such expressions of joy when on my visits, so few, alas! and far between.
Very many indeed were Mr Semmens' hardships. Their wandering life made
his work slow and at times discouraging. He had not at first a knowledge
of their language, and could not always get an interpreter. However, as
the love of Christ was the constraining motive, he persevered, and great
indeed was his success among them.</p>

<p>We will not here insert any of the many thrilling incidents of his
romantic pioneer work among them. We hope that from his fluent pen will
come his own record, which will be a very valuable addition to missionary
literature. Often did we, like the early ones sent out by the Master in
pairs, go together on some long and difficult exploring tours. At many a
camp-fire and in many a wigwam have we talked and pleaded with the
wandering Indians, and have besought them to be reconciled to God.
Hundreds of miles have we tramped on together, until our limbs were
cramped and our feet were bleeding; and then, in the cold camp after
supper and prayers, have we crowded in close together under the same
robes and tried to sleep. Will either of us ever forget the trip in to
District Meeting at Winnipeg, where on the great Lake we got separated
from the rest of our party, but by rapid travelling reached the
comfortable home and cordial welcome of our beloved Chairman, the Rev.
George Young, thus escaping the terrible blizzard in which so many
suffered? Then the return trip was equally exciting and perilous. We left
Winnipeg on the Saturday afternoon with our heavily loaded dog sleds. At
Mr Sifton's, near Selkirk, we were cordially welcomed, and here we
remained in quiet rest and joyous worship during the Sabbath day. When
the clock struck the hour of midnight, we exchanged our black clothes for
our leather suits. We harnessed up our dogs, and then, after eating a
midnight meal, we bade our host and hostess farewell, and pushed out
under the stars on our long journey to the far North. Mr Semmens' journey
would not be finished until he was six or seven hundred miles nearer the
North Pole.</p>

<p>Mr Sifton told me in after years, that they could only sit there and
weep as they thought of our starting off in the bitter cold and gloom of
that midnight hour on such a journey. Missionary work to them from that
hour took on itself additional interest, and ever after much greater, if
possible, was their love for those who for His sake were willing to
endure hardness in extending the knowledge of His Name.</p>

<p>Ere the sun rose, we were near the Willow Islands, and there we had
our breakfast. It was getting late in the winter season, and so the
reflection of the brilliant rays of the sun on the dazzlingly white snowy
waste of Winnipeg gave us both a touch of snow-blindness. Still, as we
could see a little, we only stopped when it was necessary, and rapidly
hurried on. When about twenty miles from Beren's River night came down
upon us; but I could not bear the idea of having again to sleep in a
miserable camp when home was so near, for at this time I was in charge of
the new work among the Saulteaux. So I said to Brother Semmens, and to
our two well-disciplined dog-drivers, &ldquo;Courage, men, a little
longer; let us not stop here in the bitter cold when our homes are so
near.&rdquo; The Indians responded with a will, and rejoiced that we were
to go on. But my beloved Brother Semmens was completely tired out, and my
heart was filled with sorrow as I saw how utterly exhausted he was.
Throwing himself down on the cold, icy surface of the lake, he said,
&ldquo;Throw me out a blanket and a piece of pemmican, and leave me here.
I cannot go a step further. The rest of you have wives and children to
lure you on to your homes; I have none. I can go no farther. My feet are
bleeding from the straps of my snowshoes. I will stay here. Never mind
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus the dear fellow talked, for he was exhausted and discouraged. I
did not feel much better, but I tried to put a bold face on the matter,
and I said, &ldquo;No, indeed, we will not leave you here. We are going
on, and we are going to take you with us; and a good supper under a roof,
and then a warm bed, are to be yours before morning comes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of my dogs, called Muff, a magnificent but over-ambitious St.
Bernard, the gift of Mrs Andrew Allen, of Montreal, had broken her
collar-bone during this trip. The plan generally adopted, when such an
accident happens to one of the dogs, was to kill it at once, and then
push on with the diminished train. However, as Muff was such a valuable
dog, and there was a possibility of her recovering, I decided to carry
her home, although we were a long distance from it. I so arranged my sled
that she could ride upon it, and she soon became quite reconciled to her
place. But it meant a good deal of hard running for me. Before the
accident occurred, I could ride a great part of the time, although we had
over six hundred pounds weight upon the sled. However, as Jack was one of
the train, I was able to ride when the ice was good. Now, however, with
one dog less in the train, and that one as so much additional weight on
the sled, it meant the end of my riding for that trip.</p>

<p>Very quickly did I decide how to act in order to help my dear
companion in tribulation. With our axes my Indians and myself chopped a
hole in the solidly packed snow and ice near the shore of the lake. In
this we spread out a buffalo robe, and on it we placed the injured dog.
Then around her we placed the greater part of the load of the dog-sled,
and then covered all up as well as we could with the large deer-skin
sleigh wrapper. Giving the dog orders to guard well the supplies from
prowling wild animals, and making a large number of tracks as an
additional precaution, we left Muff there with her goods.</p>

<p>Then we drove the dogs over to the spot where Mr Semmens lay, and,
wrapping him well up in robes and putting a little pillow under his head,
we tied him on the sled, and started off on the last stage of our
journey. We were all so weary that we made but slow progress, and it was
after midnight ere the welcome Mission House was reached, and we were
within the walls of home.</p>

<p>Mr Semmens had fortunately slept most of the way. A good supper, after
a warm bath, and then a long, sweet, dreamless sleep, that lasted until
nearly noon of the next day, wonderfully refreshed his spirits, and as he
came down and greeted us, his first words were, &ldquo;O Egerton, I am so
glad you did not leave me there to perish on the ice!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still in his prime, with a noble wife and precious children around
him, he is in that land doing good service for the Master. From him we
yet expect to hear good tidings, for in physical strength and mental
equipment and thorough consecration to his work he is the peer of any who
there toil.</p>

<h5>The Centenarian.</h5>

<p>One of the first Indians to attract our attention at Norway House was
a venerable-looking old man of more than usual height. His appearance was
quite patriarchal. His welcome had been most cordial, and his words
seemed to us like a loving benediction. He called us his children, and
welcomed us to our home and work in the name of the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p>As he was very aged, and had to come a long distance from his home to
the Sunday morning service, we invited him, on the first Sunday after our
arrival at the Mission, to dine with us. He was very grateful, and said
this would enable him to remain for the afternoon native service, which
he dearly prized. He was not only a blessed Christian, but a natural
gentleman. We were so drawn towards him that we invited him to dine with
us, and then rest awhile, each Sabbath between the services.</p>

<p>Like all the old Indians, his age was unknown, but it must have been
over a century, as men above fifty said he was called an old man when
they were boys. The fact that his name had been on the Hudson's Bay
Company's book for eighty years, as a skilful hunter, makes it quite safe
to class him as a centenarian.</p>

<p>His testimony to the blessedness of the Gospel was very clear and
delightful. He &ldquo;knew Whom he had believed,&rdquo; and ever rejoiced
in the blessed assurance that he would have grace given to keep him to
the end. He was one of the first converts of the early Missionaries, and
had remained true and steadfast. He had been a successful Class Leader
for many years, and faithfully and well did he attend to his duties. If
any of his members were not at the meeting, he knew the reason why before
the next evening, if they were within five or six miles of his home.</p>

<p>As he lived a couple of years after we reached the Mission, we got to
be very well acquainted, and it was ever a blessing to talk to him of
spiritual things. I had a very convincing evidence one day of the
thoroughness with which he had renounced his old pagan life and its
sinful practices. We had been talking on various subjects, and the matter
of different kinds of beliefs came up. As he had a very retentive memory,
and I had been told that he was the best authority on old Indian
religions and superstitions, I took out of my pocket a note-book and
pencil, and said, &ldquo;Mismis&rdquo; (English, &ldquo;Grandfather"),
&ldquo;I want you to tell me some things about your old conjurings and
religions. I may want to write a book some time, and put some of these
things in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dear old man's face became clouded, and he shook his head and
remained silent.</p>

<p>I urged my request, saying I felt certain he, from his great age, must
have much to talk about. For his answer, he sat down in his chair, and,
putting his elbows on his knees, buried his face in his hands, and seemed
lost in a kind of reverie.</p>

<p>I waited for a few minutes, for all was hushed and still. His family
had heard my question, and they had become intensely interested. The
silence became almost painful, and so I said in a cheery strain,
&ldquo;Come, grandfather, I am waiting to write down what you have to
say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly he sprang up in a way that startled us all, and, stretching
out his hand like an orator, he began:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Missionary! the old wicked life is like a nightmare, like a bad
dream, like a terrible sickness that made us cry out with pain. I am
trying to banish it, to forget it, to wipe it out of my memory. Please do
not ask me to talk about it, or to bring it up. I could not sleep; I
should be miserable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course I put up my book and pencil, and did not further trouble the
dear old man, who seemed so loth to talk about his old belief.</p>

<p>The next Sunday after this interview we had a Fellowship Meeting in
the church. One of the first to speak was this venerable grandfather. He
said, &ldquo;The Missionary wanted me to talk to him about my old
religion. I could not do it. It was my enemy. It only made me miserable.
The more I followed it, the more unhappy I was. So I have cast it out of
my life, and from my heart. Would that I could wash it out of my
memory!&rdquo; Then he added, &ldquo;But perhaps the memory of it helps
to make me love my Saviour better, as I can remember from what He has
saved me. I was so far from him, and so dark and sinful He reached down
His strong arm and lifted me out of the dark place, and put me into the
light. O, I am so thankful Jesus saves me, and I love to talk about
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he did talk about it, and our hearts rejoiced with him.</p>

<p>Of him it could be truthfully said, &ldquo;What he once loved he now
hates, and does it so thoroughly that he does not even wish to talk about
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While writing these pleasant memories, perhaps I cannot do better than
here record the remarkable closing scenes of the life of this venerable
old man, the patriarch of the village. His family was a large one. He had
several sons. Worthy, excellent men they were. About some of them we
shall have interesting things to say. The youngest, Edward, it was my joy
to lead into the sweet assurance that his sins were all forgiven. In
July, 1889, he was ordained, in Winnipeg, to the office and work of the
Christian ministry.</p>

<p>Martin, another of his sons, was one of my most loved and trusted
guides, and my companion, for thousands of miles, in birch canoe by
summer, and dog-trains by winter. We have looked death in the face
together many times, but I never knew him to flinch or play a coward's
part. Supplies might fail, and storms and head-winds delay us, until
starvation stared us in the face, and even the Missionary himself began
to question the wisdom of taking these wild journeys where the chances
were largely against our return, when from Martin, or one of the others,
would come the apt quotation from the Sacred Word, or from their musical
voices the cheering hymn which said,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><br>
 &ldquo;Give to the winds thy fears;<br>
         Hope, and be undismayed:<br>
 God hears thy sighs, and counts thy tears,<br>
         God shall lift up thy head.<br>
<br>
<br>
 &ldquo;Through waves and clouds and storms<br>
         He gently clears thy way:<br>
 Wait thou His time, so shall this night<br>
         Soon end in joyous day.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
</blockquote>

<p>Very precious and very real were many of the blessed promises, and
their fulfilment, to us in those times of peril and danger, when death
seemed to be so near, and we so helpless and dependent upon the Almighty
arm.</p>

<p>Another son of this old saint was Samuel, the courageous guide and
modest, unassuming Christian. He was the one who guided his well-loaded
brigade up the mighty Saskatchewan river to the rescue of the whites
there, and having safely and grandly done his work, &ldquo;holding on to
God,&rdquo; went up the shining way so triumphantly that there lingered
behind on his once pallid face some radiance of the glory like that into
which he had entered; and some seeing it were smitten with a longing to
have it as their portion, and so, then and there, they gave themselves to
God. Of him we shall hear more farther on.</p>

<p>One day when the venerable father met his class, he told his members
that his work was nearly done, and very soon indeed he expected to pass
over to the better land. Although as well as he had been for months, yet
he had a premonition that the end of his life was near. Very lovingly and
faithfully did he talk to them, and exhorted them to be faithful to the
end.</p>

<p>The next day he sent for me, and requested me to appoint one of his
sons as leader of his class, if I thought him worthy of the place.</p>

<p>I said, &ldquo;We do not want to lose you. Your class members all love
you. Why resign your position?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A strange look in his face told me that he had set his heart on
joining another company, and that it seemed as though he were only
postponing his departure until his little affairs on earth were set in
order.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going very soon now, and I want to have everything settled
before I go; and I shall be so glad to see my son William leader of my
class, if you think it best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the son was a most excellent man the appointment was made, much to
the aged father's delight.</p>

<p>The next day he had assembled all the old members who had renounced
paganism and become Christians at the same time as he did, over thirty
years before. There were enough of them to fill his house, and all came
who possibly could. They sang and prayed together, and then he stood up
before them and addressed them in loving and affectionate words.</p>

<p>As I sat there and looked upon the scene, while, for about an hour, he
was reviewing the past, and talking of God's goodness in bringing them
out of paganism, and conferring so many blessings upon them, I thought of
Joshua's memorable gathering of the elder people at Shechem to hear his
dying charge. At his request I administered to them all, and those of his
many relations who were worthy, the sacrament of the Lord's Supper. It
was a most impressive time. He Whose dying we celebrated seemed in Spirit
very blessedly near.</p>

<p>Then perhaps another hour was spent, at his desire, in singing his
favourite hymns and in prayer. He entered with great spirit into the
devotions, and many said afterwards, &ldquo;Heaven seemed very
near.&rdquo; I shook hands with him and said, &ldquo;Goodbye,&rdquo; and
returned to my home. With the exception of a little weariness on account
of the exciting services through which he had passed, I saw no change in
him. His voice was just as cheery, his eye as bright, his grip as firm as
usual, and I saw no reason why he should not live a good while yet.</p>

<p>About an hour after, while talking the matter over with Mrs Young, and
giving her some of the specially interesting incidents of the memorable
services with our dear old friend, there was a sudden call for me by an
Indian, who, rushing in without any ceremony, exclaimed, &ldquo;Come
quickly; grandfather is dead!&rdquo; I hurriedly returned with him, and
found that the aged patriarch had indeed passed away.</p>

<p>They told me that after I had left them he continued for a time to
speak loving words of counsel and advice to them. Then, as had been his
habit, he lay down on his bed, and drew his blanket around him, as though
prepared for rest. As they knew he must be weary, they kept very still,
so as not to disturb him. Not hearing him breathe, one of them touched
him, and found that he had fallen into that sleep which here knows no
waking. He was not, for God had taken him.</p>

<p>It was a remarkable death. The great difficulty among us seemed to be,
to realise the presence of death at all. He suffered from no disease, and
never complained of pain. His mind was unclouded till the last. In his
humble position he had done his work, and done it well; and so now, with
all the confidence of a loving child resting in the arms of a mother, he
laid his head down on the bosom of his Lord.</p>

<p>With rejoicings, rather than weepings, we laid in the little graveyard
all that was mortal of William Papanekis. We missed him very much, for
his presence was like the sunshine, and his prayers were benedictions
upon us all.</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_11">Chapter Ten. Rev. James Evans, the
peerless missionary &mdash; His journeys by canoe and dog-train &mdash;

Accidental shooting of his interpreter &mdash; Surrendering himself to

<p>Without any question, the Rev. James Evans was the grandest and most
successful of all our Indian Missionaries. Of him it can be said most
emphatically, &ldquo;While others have done well, he excelled them
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In burning zeal, in heroic efforts, in journeyings oft, in tact that
never failed in many a trying hour, in success most marvellous, in a
vivacity and sprightliness that never succumbed to discouragement, in a
faith that never faltered, and in a solicitude for the spread of our
blessed Christianity that never grew less, James Evans stands among us
without a peer.</p>

<p>If full accounts of his long journeys in the wilds of the great
North-West could be written, they would equal in thrilling interest
anything of the kind known in modern missionary annals. There is hardly
an Indian Mission of any prominence to-day in the whole of the vast
North-West, whether belonging to the Church of England, the Roman
Catholic, or the Methodist Church, that James Evans did not commence; and
the reason why the Methodist Church to-day does not hold them all is,
because the apathetic Church did not respond to his thrilling appeals,
and send in men to take possession and hold the fields as fast as they
were successfully opened up by him.</p>

<p>From the northern shores of Lake Superior away to the <i>ultima
Thule</i> that lies beyond the waters of Athabasca and Slave Lakes, where
the Aurora Borealis holds high carnival; from the beautiful prairies of
the Bow and Saskatchewan Rivers to the muskegs and sterile regions of
Hudson's Bay; from the fair and fertile domains of Red and Assinaboia
Rivers, to the foot-hills of the Rocky Mountains, enduring footprints of
James Evans may still be seen.</p>

<p>At many a camp-fire, and in many a lonely wigwam, old Indians yet
linger, whose eyes brighten and whose tongues wax eloquent as they recall
that man whose deeds live on, and whose converts from a degrading
paganism are still to be counted by scores. Many a weary hour has been
charmed away, as I have listened to Papanekis the elder, or Henry Budd,
or some other old Indian guide or dog-driver, or canoe-man, while they
rehearsed the thrilling adventures, the narrow escapes, the wonderful
deliverances, and also some of the tragic events, through which they
passed in company with the &ldquo;Nistum Ayumeaookemou,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;first Missionary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dog-drivers loved to talk about Mr Evans' wonderful train of half
dogs, half wolves, with which for years he travelled. With great
enthusiasm they would talk of their marvellous speed and endurance, of
their fierceness and sagacity; of how, when the nights in the wintry
camps were unusually cold &mdash; say fifty or sixty degrees below zero
&mdash; these fierce animals would crowd into the camp, and, lying on
their backs, would hold up both their fore and hind feet, and thus mutely
beg for some one to have compassion upon them and put on the warm woollen
dog-shoes.</p>

<p>His canoe trips were often of many weeks' duration, and extended for
thousands of miles. No river seemed too rapid, and no lake too stormy, to
deter him in his untiring zeal to find out the Indian in his solitudes,
and preach to him the ever-blessed Gospel. Ever on the look-out for
improvements to aid him in more rapid transit through the country, Mr
Evans constructed a canoe out of sheet tin. This the Indians called the
&ldquo;Island of light,&rdquo; on account of its flashing back the sun's
rays as it glided along propelled by the strong paddles in the hands of
the well trained crew. With them they carried in this novel craft solder
and soldering-iron, and when they had the misfortune to run upon a rock
they went ashore and quickly repaired the injured place.</p>

<p>Mr Evans had been for years a Minister and Missionary in the Canadian
Methodist Church. With the Rev. William Case he had been very
successfully employed among the Indians in the Province of Ontario. When
the English Wesleyan Society decided to begin work among the neglected
tribes in the Hudson's Bay Territories, the Rev. James Evans was the man
appointed to be the leader of the devoted band. In order to reach Norway
House, which was to be his first principal Mission, his household effects
had to be shipped from Toronto to England, and thence reshipped to York
Factory on the Hudson Bay. From this place they had to be taken up by
boats to Norway House in the interior, a distance of five hundred miles.
Seventy times had they to be lifted out of these inland boats and carried
along the portages around falls and cataracts ere they reached their
destination.</p>

<p>Mr Evans himself went by boat from Toronto. The trip from Thunder Bay
in Lake Superior to Norway House was performed in a birch bark canoe.
Hundreds of Indians listened to his burning messages, and great good was
done by him and his faithful companions in arms, among them being the
heroic Mr Barnley, and Mr Rundle, of the English Wesleyan Church.</p>

<p>The great work of Mr Evans' life, and that with which his name will be
ever associated, was undoubtedly the invention and perfecting of what is
now so widely known as the Cree Syllabic Characters. What first led him
to this invention was the difficulty he and others had in teaching the
Indians to read in the ordinary way. They are hunters, and so are very
much on the move, like the animals they seek. To-day their tents are
pitched where there is good fishing, and perhaps in two weeks they are
far away in the deep forests, where roam the reindeer, or on the banks of
streams where the beavers build their wonderful dams and curious homes.
The constant thought in this master Missionary's mind was, &ldquo;Can I
possibly devise a plan by which these wandering people can learn to read
more easily?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The principle of the characters which he adopted is phonetic. There
are no silent letters. Each character represents a syllable; hence no
spelling is required. As soon as the alphabet is mastered, and a few
additional secondary signs, some of which represent consonants, and some
aspirates, and some partially change the sound of the main character, the
Indian student, be he a man or woman of eighty, or a child of six years,
can commence at the first chapter of Genesis and read on, slowly of
course at first, but in a few days with surprising ease and accuracy.</p>

<p>Many were Mr Evans' difficulties in perfecting this invention and
putting it in practical use, even after he had got the scheme clear and
distinct in his own mind. He was hundreds of miles away from
civilisation. Very little indeed had he with which to work. Yet with him
there was no such word as failure. Obtaining, as a great favour, the thin
sheets of lead that were around the tea-chests of the fur traders, he
melted these down into little bars, and from them cut out his first
types. His ink was made out of the soot of the chimneys, and his first
paper was birch bark. After a good deal of effort, and the exercise of
much ingenuity, he made a press, and then the work began.</p>

<p>Great indeed was the amazement and delight of the Indians. The fact
that the bark could &ldquo;talk&rdquo; was to them most wonderful.
Portions of the Gospels were first printed, and then some of the
beautiful hymns. The story of this invention reached the Wesleyan home
Society. Generous help was afforded. A good supply of these types was
cast in London, and, with a good press and all the essential requisites,
including a large quantity of paper, was sent out to that Mission, and
for years it was the great point from which considerable portions of the
Word of God were scattered among the wandering tribes, conferring
unnumbered blessings upon them. In later years the noble British and
Foreign Bible Society has taken charge of the work; and now, thanks to
their generosity, the Indians have the blessed Word scattered among them,
and thousands can read its glorious truths.</p>

<p>All the Churches having Missions in that great land have availed
themselves, more or less, of Mr Evans' invention. To suit other tribes
speaking different languages, the characters have been modified or have
had additions to them, to correspond with sounds in those languages which
were not in the Cree. Even in Greenland the Moravian Missionaries are now
using Evans' Syllabic Characters with great success among the
Esquimaux.</p>

<p>When Lord Dufferin was Governor-General of the Dominion of Canada,
hearing that a couple of Missionaries from the Indian tribes were in
Ottawa, where he resided, he sent a courteous request for us to call upon
him. With two or three friends, Mr Crosby, our successful and energetic
Missionary from British Columbia, and I, obeyed the summons.</p>

<p>The interview was a very pleasant and profitable one. Lord Dufferin
questioned Mr Crosby about British Columbia and his work, and was pleased
to hear of his great success. After a bright and earnest conversation
with me in reference to the Indians of the North-West Territories, in
which his Excellency expressed his solicitude for the welfare and
happiness of the aboriginal tribes of red men, he made some inquiries in
reference to missionary work among them, and seemed much pleased with the
answers I was able to give. In mentioning the help I had in my work, I
showed him my Cree Indian Testament printed in Evans' Syllabic
Characters, and explained the invention to him. At once his curiosity was
excited, and, jumping up, he hurried off for pen and ink, and got me to
write out the whole alphabet for him; and then, with that glee and
vivacity for which his lordship was so noted, he constituted me his
teacher, and commenced at once to master them.</p>

<p>As their simplicity, and yet wonderful adaptation for their designed
work, became evident to him &mdash; for in a short time he was able to
read a portion of the Lord's Prayer &mdash; Lord Dufferin was much
excited, and, getting up from his chair and holding up the Testament in
his hand, exclaimed, &ldquo;Why, Mr Young, what a blessing to humanity
the man was who invented that alphabet!&rdquo; Then he added, &ldquo;I
profess to be a kind of a literary man myself, and try to keep posted up
in my reading of what is going on, but I never heard of this before. The
fact is, the nation has given many a man a title, and a pension, and then
a resting-place and a monument in Westminster Abbey, who never did half
so much for his fellow-creatures.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then again he asked, &ldquo;Who did you say was the author or inventor
of these characters?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Rev. James Evans,&rdquo; I replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, why is it I never heard of him before, I
wonder?&rdquo;</p>

<p>My reply was, &ldquo;My lord, perhaps the reason why you never heard
of him before was because he was a humble, modest Methodist
preacher.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a laugh he replied, &ldquo;That may have been it,&rdquo; and then
the conversation changed.</p>

<p>Mr Evans was ever anxious that the Indian converts should at once be
made to understand all the duties and responsibilities of the new life on
which they were entering, he was a fearless man, and boldly declared unto
them the whole counsel of God. Knowing the blighting, destroying
influences of the &ldquo;fire water&rdquo; upon the poor Indian race, he
made the Church a total abstinence society, and, as all missionaries
should, he set them the example of his own life. Then, as regards the
keeping of the Sabbath, he took his stand on the Word of God, and
preached the absolute necessity of the one day's rest in seven. In after
years we saw the good results of the scriptural lessons which he and his
worthy successors taught in reference to the holy day.</p>

<p>Many and severe were the trials, and mysterious some of the
persecutions, which this glorious man had to bear. Because of his
unswerving loyalty to truth, and his conscientious and fearless teaching
of all the commandments of God's Word, some in high authority, who at
first were supposed to be friendly, turned against him, and became his
unprincipled foes. The trouble first seemed to begin when Mr Evans taught
the Indians to &ldquo;Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy.&rdquo; At
his request, they, when hunting or fishing or tripping in the months of
open water, rested on the Lord's day. Short-sighted employers,
unconscious of the fact, so often demonstrated, that they who rest the
one day in seven can do more work in the other six, opposed this
teaching, and, when they could not stop it, assailed the Missionary in a
way that must have caused a jubilee in hell. I shall not go into
particulars. Most of the principal actors are in the presence of the
Judge of all the earth. He Who suffered for a time the name of this
devoted servant of His to be so shamefully clouded has cleared all the
mists away; and like the silver refined by the furnace, so has it been in
this case.</p>

<p>But persecutions, and even these bitter assaults upon his character,
could not turn him from the most intense activity in his blessed
life-work. Like an Apostle Paul in primitive times, or like a Coke or
Asbury in the early years of this century, so travelled James Evans. When
we say he travelled thousands of miles each year on his almost
semi-continental journeys, we must remember that these were not performed
by coach or railroad, or even with horse and carriage, or in the saddle
or sailing vessel, but by canoe and dog-train. How much of hardship and
suffering that means, we are thankful but few of our readers will ever
know. There are a few of us who do know something of these things, and
this fellowship of his suffering knits our hearts in loving memory to him
who excelled us all, and the fragrance of whose name and unselfish
devotion to his work met us almost everywhere, although years had passed
away since James Evans had entered into his rest. &ldquo;He being dead
yet speaketh.&rdquo; To write about him and his work is a labour of love.
Would that the pen of some ready writer might give us a biography of this
Missionary of such versatility of gifts, and such marvellous success in
his work!</p>

<p>Room only have I here, in addition to what has already been written,
to give some account of the sad event of his life, the accidental
shooting of his interpreter, Joseph Hasselton, and the after
consequences.</p>

<p>Word reached Mr Evans one year, that the priests were endeavouring to
crowd up into the Athabasca and Mackenzie River country, and get a
foothold among some very interesting Indians whom Mr Evans had visited
and found very anxious for the truth. Desirous that they should not be
led away from the simplicity of the Gospel, he felt that the best plan
was for him to hurry up by light canoe and get into that country and
among his Indians before the priests arrived. They had gone the usual
route up the Saskatchewan, and from thence were to go over the height of
land, and then by boat down the streams which from those regions run
towards the Arctic Ocean.</p>

<p>Mr Evans' plan was to take what is called &ldquo;the back
route,&rdquo; that was, to go partly down the Nelson River, and then,
turning westward through an almost endless succession of lakes and rivers
and portages, arrive before the other parties, although several weeks of
severest toil would be passed in making the long journey. With his
beloved interpreter, who was one of the most remarkable Indians of his
day, a man who could talk almost every Indian language spoken by the
natives of the land, and, what was better, a devoted Christian, full of
zeal and enthusiasm for the work, and with another reliable native from
whom I received my information as to what occurred, the long journey was
commenced. For several days they made good progress, and were rejoicing
at the prospect of success. One morning, very early, while they were
paddling along in the great Nelson River, Hasselton, the interpreter, who
was in the front of the canoe, said, &ldquo;I see some ducks in those
reeds near the shore. Hand me the gun.&rdquo; In these small canoes the
guns are generally kept in the stern with the muzzles pointing back, so
as to prevent accidents. The man who was in the stern quickly picked up
the gun, and foolishly drew back the trigger. With the muzzle pointing
forward he passed the gun to Mr Evans, who did not turn his head, as he
was earnestly looking if he also could see the ducks. As Mr Evans took
the gun passed to him he unfortunately let the trigger, which had no
guard around it, strike against the thaft of the canoe. Instantly it went
off, and the contents were discharged into the head of the poor man in
front. He turned his dying eyes upon Mr Evans, and then fell over, a
corpse. It was an awful accident, and doubly painful on account of the
unfortunate surroundings. Here the two survivors were, about two hundred
miles from any habitation. They could not take the body back with them.
For days they would meet none to whom they could tell their story. They
went ashore, and, when their first paroxysm of grief was over, they had
to dig, as best they could, a grave in the wilderness, and there bury
their dead.</p>

<p>They turned their faces homeward, and very sorrowful indeed was the
journey. Great was the grief at the village, and greater still the
consternation when it was discovered what Mr Evans had resolved to do.
His, interpreter was the only Christian among his relatives. The rest of
them were wild pagans with bad records. Life for life was their motto,
and many had been their deeds of cruelty and bloodshed in seeking that
revenge which occupies so large a place in the savage Indian's heart.
They lived several hundred miles away, and Mr Evans resolved to go and
surrender himself to them, tell them what he had done, and take all the
consequences. Many friends, knowing how quick the Indian is to act when
aroused by the news of the death of a relative &mdash; for often before
he hears all the circumstances does he strike the fatal blow &mdash;
urged him not to go himself, but to send a mediator.</p>

<p>To this suggestion he turned a deaf ear, and, having made his will and
left all instructions as to the work if he should never return, and
bidden farewell to his stricken family, who never expected to see him
alive again, he started off on his strange and perilous journey.</p>

<p>Reaching the distant village, he walked into the tent of the parents
of his interpreter, and told them that his heart was broken, and why.
Angry words were uttered, and tomahawks and guns were freely handled,
while he described the tragic scene. Feeling so utterly miserable that he
little cared whether they killed him or let him live, there he sat down
on the ground in their midst, and awaited their decision. Some of the
hot-headed spirits were for killing him at once; but wiser counsels
prevailed, and it was decided that he must be adopted into the family
from which he had shot the son, and be all to them, as far as possible,
that their son had been. This had been a good deal. Becoming a Christian
had made him kind and loving, and so all that he could spare of his
wages, earned while interpreting for Mr Evans, had been faithfully sent
to his parents. The ceremony of adoption lasted several days. Mr Evans
assumed as his Indian name that of this family, and a good son indeed
they found in him.</p>

<p>When he left to return to his Mission they kissed him, and acted
towards him with as much affection as such people can show. Many were the
gifts which were sent them by their adopted son, who took good care of
them as long as he lived.</p>

<p>But while this difficulty was thus tided over, the memory of it never
faded away from Mr Evans. He was never the same man after. Yet he did not
allow it to deter him from the most vigorous prosecution of his work:
indeed, it seemed to his people as though he tried to bury his sorrow in
incessant toil, and labours so abundant, that but few even of the Indians
&ldquo;in journeyings oft&rdquo; could equal him.</p>

<p>To aid the further prosecution of his labours, and to excite greater
interest in the well-being of the Red Indians of British North America,
Mr Evans went to England to speak about his work and its needs. His story
of marvellous incidents and varied experiences in this land of which so
little was known, produced a deep impression, and great crowds came out
to hear him, and insisted on his continuing at great length his wonderful
descriptions of travelling by canoe and dog-train, and the longing desire
there was in the hearts of the Indians for the Gospel.</p>

<p>On November 23rd, 1846, after having spoken at Keelby in Lincolnshire,
he returned with his wife, who was in every respect a devoted helpmate
for such a work, to the home of the gentleman and lady with whom they
were stopping. While chatting on various subjects, Mrs Evans turned to
her husband, who was comfortably seated in a large arm-chair, and said,
&ldquo;My dear, I have had such a strange presentiment &mdash; that we
shall never sec Norway House and our faithful Indians again.&rdquo; He
turned to her and said, with something of his old enthusiasm, &ldquo;Why
should that thought trouble you, my dear? Heaven is just as near from
England as from America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two ladies said, &ldquo;Good night!&rdquo; and retired, leaving Mr
Evans and the gentleman of the house to chat together a little longer.
Shortly after the gentleman said something to Mr Evans, and, receiving no
answer, he turned from the fire and looked at him. At first he thought he
had fallen asleep, but this was only for an instant. Springing up and
going to him, he found that the immortal spirit had so quietly and gently
flitted away, that there had not been the slightest sob or cry. The noble
Indian Missionary was dead. The eloquent tongue was hushed for ever. For
his return hundreds of anxious weeping Indians in those northern wilds
would long and wait, but wait in vain. He had been conveyed by angel
bands to that innumerable company of redeemed, blood-washed saints around
the throne of God, which even then had received many happy converted
Indians, who, brought to God by his instrumentality, had finished their
course with joy, and before him had entered in through the gates into the
city, and were there to welcome him.</p>

<p>Hundreds, since then, of his spiritual children have had the
&ldquo;abundant entrance ministered unto&rdquo; them, and they have
joined him in that rapidly increasing throng. And although many years
have passed away since he preached to them his last sermon, at many a
camp-fire, and in many a wigwam, still linger old men, and women too,
whose eyes glisten and then become bedimmed with tears as they think of
him who so long ago went on before. But while they weep, they also
rejoice that that salvation, which, as the result of his preaching, they
accepted, is still their solace and their joy, and, clinging to it and
its great Author, they shall by-and-by meet their Missionary and loved
ones who have finished their course and gained the eternal shores.</p>

<p>On the previous page are the Syllabic Characters, as invented by Mr
Evans; and on this we give the Lord's Prayer in Cree, as printed in
them.</p>

<p>Perhaps the following explanations will help the student who may have
a wish to master this wonderful invention.</p>

<p>In the Alphabet the first line of characters, the equilateral triangle
in four positions, reads as follows, &auml; e oo ah.</p>

<p>The addition of the little dot, as seen in the second line, adds to
any character after which it is placed the sound of w. So this second
line reads w&auml;, we, woo, wah.</p>

<p>The following lines read thus: p&auml; pe poo pah; t&auml; te too tah;
k&auml; ke koo kah; ch&auml; che choo chah; m&auml; mee moo mah; n&auml;
ne noo nah; s&auml; se soo sah; y&auml; ye yoo yah.</p>

<p>With a little patience the Lord's Prayer can be read even without a
teacher.</p>

<p>I have gone to a pagan band far away in the northern wilderness, and
after they have become willing to receive the truth, I have commenced to
teach them to read the Word of God. Very limited indeed were our
appliances, for we were hundreds of miles from the nearest school house.
But from the camp-fire, where we had cooked our bear's meat or beaver, I
would take a burnt stick, and with it make these Syllabic Characters on
the side of a rock, and then patiently repeat them over and over again
with my school of often three generations of Indians together, until they
had some idea of them. Then I would give them the copies of the Bible I
had brought, and at the first verse of Genesis we would begin. It paid
for the hardships of the trip a thousandfold to see the looks of joy and
delight on their faces as they themselves were able to read that
wonderful verse.</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_12">Chapter Eleven. Sowing and reaping
&mdash; Beautiful incident &mdash; &ldquo;Help me to be a
Christian!&rdquo; &mdash; Thirty years between the sowing and the reaping
&mdash; Sorrowing, yet stubborn, Indians induced to yield by the
expression, &ldquo;I know where your children are!&rdquo;</a></h3>

<p>While in our every-day missionary life there were dark hours, and
times when our faith was severely tried, there was, on the other hand,
much to encourage us to persevere in the blessed work among these Cree
Indians.</p>

<p>An incident that occurred to us brought up very forcibly to our minds
the couplet:</p>

<blockquote><br>
 &ldquo;Whate'er may die and be forgot,<br>
         Work done for God, it dieth not.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
</blockquote>

<p>I was sitting, one pleasant day in June, in my study at Norway House,
absorbed in my work, when I was startled by a loud &ldquo;Ahem!&rdquo;
behind me. I quickly sprang up, and, turning round, discovered that the
man who had thus suddenly interrupted me in my thoughts was a big,
stalwart Indian. He had come into the room in that catlike way in which
nearly all of the Indians move. Their moccasined feet make no sound, and
so it is quite possible for even scores of them to come into the house
unheard. Then, as Indians have a great dislike to knocking, they
generally omit it altogether, and unceremoniously enter, as this man had
done, and as quietly as possible.</p>

<p>My first glance at him told me that he was an entire stranger,
although I had by this time become acquainted with some hundreds of the
natives. I shook hands with him and said a few commonplace things to him,
to which I thought he paid but little heed.</p>

<p>I pointed to a chair, and asked him to be seated; but, instead of
doing so, he came up close to me and said with great earnestness:
&ldquo;Missionary, will you help me to be a Christian?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Surprised and pleased by this abrupt question, I replied,
&ldquo;Certainly I will; that is my business here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you help my wife and children also to become
Christians?&rdquo; he added with equal emphasis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I will,&rdquo; I answered again. &ldquo;It was for
just such work as that my good wife and I came from our far-away home to
live in this land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Naturally I had already become very much interested in this big,
bronzed Indian; and so I said to him, &ldquo;Tell me who you are, and
from what place you have come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I made him sit down before me, and he told me the following remarkable
story. I wish I could put into the narrative his pathos and his dramatic
action. He did not keep his seat very long after he began talking, but
moved around, and at times was very much excited. He said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Many years ago, when I was a little boy, I was kindly cared for
by the first Missionary, Mr Evans. I was a poor orphan. My father and
mother had died, leaving none to care for me; so the good Missionary took
me to his own house and was very kind to me. 'Tis true I had some
relatives, but they were not Christians and so there was not much love in
their hearts towards a poor orphan boy. So Mr Evans took me to his house,
and was very kind to me. He gave me clothes and food, and a home. He
taught me to read the new letters he had made for our people, and told me
much about the Great Spirit and His Son Jesus. He taught me and other
children to pray to God, and he often talked to us about Him, and how
kind and good He was. He kept me with him two or three years, and I was
very well off indeed in having such a home and such a friend, if I had
only known it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One summer, among the many Indians who came to trade their furs
at the Company's store, was one family who lived very far away. They
seemed to take a liking to me, and often would talk to me. They had no
little boy, they said, in their wigwam, and they told me a lot of foolish
stuff about how much happier I would be, if I lived with them, than I was
here, where I had to obey the white man. Like the foolish child that I
was, I listened to this nonsense, and one night, when they had got
everything ready to start, I slipped quietly out of the house and joined
them. We paddled hard most of the night, for we felt that we had done
wrong, and did not know but we should be followed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After travelling many days we reached their hunting grounds and
wigwams. I did not find it as pleasant as they had told me it would be.
Often they were very cruel to me, and sometimes we did not have much to
eat. But I dared not run away, for there was no place to which I could
go, except to other wicked Indians; and they would only make things
worse. They were all very bad Indians, and very much afraid of the
medicine men. All the worship they did was to the bad spirit. They were
afraid of him, and so they worshipped him, so that he might not do them
much harm. I became as bad as any of them. I tried to forget all that the
good Missionary had told me. I tried to wipe all his teachings and
prayers from my memory. All he had told me about the Good Spirit and His
Son I tried to forget.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I grew up to be a man. I had become a wicked pagan; but I was a
good hunter, and one of the men sold me one of his daughters to be my
wife. We have quite a family. Because I had seen, when I was a little
boy, how Christian Indian men treat the women better than the pagan
Indians treat theirs, I treated my wife and children well. I was never
cruel to them. I love my wife and children.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Last winter, you remember, the snow was very deep. I had taken
my family and gone out into the region of deer and other animals, and
there had made my hunting lodge for the winter. There we set our traps
for the fur-bearing animals. We took a good many of the smaller animals
that have got furs, but the larger ones, that are good for food, were
very few. We had a hard time, as food was very scarce. I could not find
any deer to shoot, and we had come far from the great lakes and rivers,
and so had no fish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At length it seemed as though we must starve. I tried hard to
get something, but I seemed to fail every time. Sometimes, when I did
manage to get within range of the moose or reindeer, and I fired, my gun,
which is only a flintlock, would only flash the powder in the pan, and so
the charge would not go off. The noise, however, had so frightened the
deer that he had rushed away before I could get ready to fire again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At length it got so bad with us that I became completely
discouraged, and I said, 'I will only try once more; and if I do not
succeed in shooting a deer, I will shoot myself.' So I took up my gun and
hurried into the forest away from my half-starved family. I cautiously
tramped along on my snowshoes all the first day, and did not see even a
track. I made a little camp and lay down cold and hungry. I hunted all
the next day and only got a rabbit. This I ate in the little camp I made
the second night in the snow. On the third day I hunted until about noon.
Then feeling very weak and hungry, I got so discouraged that I said, as I
sat down on a log covered with snow, 'I will die here. I am weak with
hunger, I can go no further.' I was cross and angry, and I said, as I
talked to myself, 'No use trying any more.' Then I loaded my gun with a
heavy charge of powder and two bullets, and, drawing back the trigger, my
plan was to put the muzzle of the gun against the side of my head, and
then press on the trigger with my big toe, which you know moves easily in
the moccasin. Just as I was getting ready thus to kill myself, something
seemed to speak to me, 'William!' I pushed the gun away, for I was
frightened. I looked all around, but could not see anybody. Then I found
that the voice was in me, and it began to talk to me out of my heart; and
as I listened it seemed to say, 'William, do you not remember what the
Missionary told you long ago about the Great Spirit? He said He was kind
and forgiving, and that even if we did wander far away from him, if we
became sorry and would come back, He would forgive. Do you not remember,
William, he said that if we ever got into great trouble, the Great Spirit
was the best Friend to Whom to go to help us out? You are in great
trouble, William. Don't you think you had better come back to him?'</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I trembled and hesitated, for I was ashamed to come. I
thought over my life, how I had run away from the kind Missionary who had
taken me, a poor orphan boy, into his home, and fed and clothed me, and
taught me so much about the true way. Then I remembered so well how I had
tried to wipe out from my memory all I had learned about the Great Spirit
and His Son, and the good Book. I had denied to the pagan people that I
knew anything about the white man's religion. I had been very bad, and
had got very far away; how could I come back? Still all the answer I got
was, 'You had better come back.'</p>

<p>&ldquo;There I sat and trembled, and I felt I was too mean to come
back. But all the answer I got was, 'It is meaner to stay away, if what
the Missionary said is true.' While I was hesitating what to do, and all
trembling in the cold, I seemed to hear my wife and children in the
wigwam far away crying for food. This decided me. So I turned round, and
kneeled down in the snow by the log, and began to pray. I hardly know
what I said, but I do remember I asked the Great Spirit to forgive the
poor Indian who had got so far away from Him, and had been so wicked, and
had tried to wipe Him out of his memory. I told him I was sorry, and
wanted to do better; and there in the snow I promised, if He would
forgive and help me in my trouble, and give something for my wife and
children to eat, I would, just as soon as the snow and ice left the
rivers and lakes, go and find the Missionary, and ask him to help me to
be a Christian.</p>

<p>&ldquo;While I prayed I felt better; I seemed to feel in my heart that
help was coming. I got up from my knees, and it seemed as though that
prayer had strengthened me like food. I forgot I was cold and hungry. I
took up my gun with a glad heart, and away I started; and I had not gone
far before a large reindeer came dashing along. I fired and killed him. I
was very glad. I quickly skinned him, and I soon made a fire and cooked
some of the meat. Then I pulled down a small tree, and fastened part of
the meat into the top of it, and let it swing up again, so as to keep it
from the wolves and wolverines. Then I took the rest on my back and
hurried home to my hungry wife and children. Soon after I went back for
the rest of the venison, and found it all right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since that hour we have always had something. I have hunted
hard, and have had success. None of us have been hungry since. The Great
Spirit has been all that the Missionary said He would be to us. He has
cared for us, and given us all that we have needed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not forgotten my promise made while kneeling in the snow
beside the log in the woods. The snow has gone, and the ice has left the
lakes and rivers. I have launched my canoe, and have come with my wife
and children to ask you to help us to be Christians.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We were very much pleased to hear such a wonderful experience, which
was thus leading him back to God; and we told him so. When we learned
that all this time he had been talking his wife and children were
patiently sitting in the canoe outside at the shore, we hurried out with
him and brought them into the Mission House.</p>

<p>Mrs Young, and one or two others, attracted by William's earnest
words, had come into my study, and had heard most of his story, and of
course were also deeply interested. Out of our scant supplies we gave the
whole family a good hearty meal, and we both did what we could by words
and actions to make them feel that we were their friends, and would do
all we could to help them to be Christians. We were delighted to find
that since that memorable day when at the snow-covered log in the forest
William had bowed in prayer, he had been diligent in teaching his family
all that he could remember of the blessed truths of the Gospel. They had
gladly received it and were eager for more.</p>

<p>I called together some of the head men of the village, and told them
the story of this family, and what William had said about his early life.
A few of the older people remembered the circumstance of his adoption by
Mr Evans after the death of his parents, whom they remembered well. Happy
Christians themselves, and anxious that others should enjoy the same
blessedness, they rejoiced at William's return, and especially with such
a desire in his heart. So they at once gave the exile a place among
themselves, and some needed help. Thorough and genuine were the changes
wrought in the hearts of that family by Divine grace, and they have
remained firm and true. In their house was a family altar, and from the
church services they were never absent, unless far off in distant hunting
grounds.</p>

<p>Various were the arguments which the Good Spirit gave us to use in
persuading men and women to be reconciled to God. Here is a beautiful
illustration:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i><b>Where Are Our Children</b></i>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the banks of a wild river, about sixty miles from Beaver Lake, I
visited a band of pagan Indians, who seemed determined to resist every
appeal or entreaty I could make to induce them to listen to my words.
They were so dead and indifferent that I was for a time quite
disheartened. The journey to reach them had taken about eight days from
home through the dreary wilderness, where we had not met a single human
being. My two faithful canoemen and I had suffered much from the
character of the route, and the absence of game, which had caused us more
than once to wrap ourselves up in our blankets and lie down supperless
upon the granite rocks and try to sleep. The rain had fallen upon us so
persistently that for days the water had been dripping from us, and we
had longed for the sunshine that we might get dry again.</p>

<p>We had met with some strange adventures, and I had had another
opportunity for observing the intelligence and shrewdness of my men, and
their quickness in arriving at right conclusions from very little data.
Many think of the Indians as savages and uncivilised, yet in some
respects they are highly educated, and are gifted with a quickness of
perception not excelled by any other people in the world. We had the
following illustration of it on this trip.</p>

<p>As most of the Indians had gone away in the brigades to York Factory,
to carry down the furs and to freight up the goods for the next winter's
trade, I could not find any canoemen who were acquainted with the route
to the pagan band which I wished to visit. The best I could do was to
secure the services of a man as a guide who had only been as far as
Beaver Lake. He was willing to go and run the risk of finding the Indian
band, if possible, although so far beyond the most northern point he had
ever gone before. As I could do no better I hired him and another Indian,
and away we went.</p>

<p>After several days of hard work &mdash; for the portages around the
falls and rapids were many, and several times we had to wade through
muskegs or morasses up to our knees for miles together, carrying all our
load on our heads or backs &mdash; we at length reached Beaver Lake. Here
we camped for the night and talked over our future movements. We had come
two hundred and forty miles through these northern wilds, and yet had
about sixty miles to go ere we expected to see human beings, and were all
absolutely ignorant of the direction in which to go.</p>

<p>We spent the night on the shore of the lake, and slept comfortably on
the smooth rocks. Early the next morning we began to look out for signs
to guide us on our way. There were several high hills in the vicinity,
and it was decided that we should each ascend one of these, and see if
from these elevated positions the curling smoke from some distant Indian
camp-fire, or other signs of human beings, could be observed.</p>

<p>Seizing my rifle, I started off to ascend the high hill which had been
assigned me, while my Indians went off in other directions. This hill was
perhaps half a mile from our camp-fire, and I was soon at its foot, ready
to push my way up through the tangled underbrush that grew so densely on
its sides. To my surprise I came almost suddenly upon a creek of rare
crystal beauty, on the banks of which were many impressions of hoofs,
large and small, as though a herd of cattle had there been drinking.
Thoughtlessly, for I seemed to have forgotten where we were, I came to
the conclusion that as the herd of cattle had there quenched their
thirst, they and their owner must be near. So I hurried back to the camp,
and signalled to the men to return, and told them what I had seen. There
was an amused look on their faces, but they were very polite and
courteous men, and so they accompanied me to the creek, where, with a
good deal of pride, I pointed out to them the footprints of cattle, and
stated that I thought that they and their owners could not be far off.
They listened to me patiently, and then made me feel extremely foolish by
uttering the word &ldquo;Moose.&rdquo; I had mistaken the footprints of a
herd of moose for a drove of cattle, much to their quiet amusement.</p>

<p>We looked around for a time, and, getting no clue, we embarked in our
canoe, and started to explore the different streams that flowed into or
out of this picturesque lake. After several hours of unsuccessful work we
entered into the mouth of quite a fine river, and began paddling up it,
keeping close to one of its sandy shores. Suddenly one of my Indians
sprang up in the canoe, and began carefully examining some small tracks
on the shore. A few hasty words were uttered by the men, and then we
landed.</p>

<p>They closely inspected these little footprints, and then exclaimed,
&ldquo;We have got it now, Missionary; we can take you soon to the
Indians!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have you discovered?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I see nothing
to tel me where the Indians are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We see it very plain,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;You sent
word that you were coming to meet them this moon. They have been
scattered hunting, but are gathering at the place appointed, and a canoe
of them went up this river yesterday, and the dog ran along the shore,
and these are his tracks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I examined these impressions in the sand, and said, &ldquo;The country
is full of wild animals; these may be the tracks of a wolf or wolverine
or some other beast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They only laughed at me, and said, &ldquo;We can see a great
difference between these tracks and those made by the wild
animals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our canoe was soon afloat again, and, using our paddles vigorously, we
sped rapidly along the river. With no other clue than those little
footprints in the sand my men confidently pushed along. After paddling
for about twenty miles we came to the camp-fire, still smouldering, where
the Indians had slept the night before. Here we cooked our dinner, and
then hurried on, still guided by the little tracks along the shore.
Towards evening we reached the encampment, just as my canoemen had
intimated we should.</p>

<p>The welcome we received was not very cordial. The Indians were soured
and saddened by having lost many of their number, principally children,
by scarlet fever, which for the first time had visited their country, and
which had been undoubtedly brought into their land by some free-traders
the year before. With the exception of an old conjurer or two, none
openly opposed me, but the sullen apathy of the people made it very
discouraging work to try to preach or teach. However, we did the best we
could, and were resolved that having come so far, and suffered so many
hardships to reach them, we would faithfully deliver the message, and
leave the results to Him Who had permitted us to be the first who had
ever visited that Land to tell the story of redeeming love.</p>

<p>One cold, rainy day a large number of us were crowded into the largest
wigwam for a talk about the truths in the great Book. My two faithful
Christian companions aided me all they could by giving personal testimony
to the blessedness of this great salvation. But all seemed in vain. There
the people sat and smoked in sullen indifference. When questioned as to
their wishes and determinations, all I could get from them was, &ldquo;As
our fathers lived and died, so will we.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tired out and sad of heart, I sat down in quiet communion with the
Blessed Spirit, and breathed up a prayer for guidance and help in this
hour of sore perplexity. In my extremity the needed assistance came so
consciously that I almost exulted in the assurance of coming victory.
Springing up, I shouted out, &ldquo;I know where all your children are,
who are not among the living! I know, yes, I do know most certainly where
all the children are, whom Death has taken in his cold grasp from among
us, the children of the good and of the bad, of the whites and of the
Indians, I know where all the children are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Great indeed was the excitement among them. Some of them had had their
faces well shrouded in their blankets as they sat like upright mummies in
the crowded wigwam. But when I uttered these words, they quickly
uncovered their faces, and manifested the most intense interest. Seeing
that I had at length got their attention, I went on with my words:
&ldquo;Yes, I know where all the children are. They have gone from your
camp-fires and wigwams. The hammocks are empty, and the little bows and
arrows lie idle. Many of your hearts are sad, as you mourn for those
little ones whose voices you hear not, and who come not at your call. I
am so glad that the Great Spirit gives me authority to tell you that you
may meet your children again, and be happy with them for ever. But you
must listen to His words, which I bring to you from His great Book, and
give Him your hearts, and love and serve Him. There is only one way to
that beautiful land, where Jesus, the Son of the Great Spirit, has gone,
and into which He takes all the children who have died; and now that you
have heard His message and seen His Book, you too must come this way, if
you would be happy and there enter in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While I was thus speaking, a big, stalwart man from the other side of
the tent sprang up, and rushed towards me. Beating on his breast, he
said, &ldquo;Missionary, my heart is empty, and I mourn much, for none of
my children are left among the living; very lonely is my wigwam. I long
to see my children again, and to clasp them in my arms. Tell me,
Missionary, what must, I do to please the Great Spirit, that I may get to
that beautiful land, that I may meet my children again?&rdquo; Then he
sank at my feet upon the ground, his eyes suffused with tears, and was
quickly joined by others, who, like him, were broken down with grief, and
were anxious now for religious instruction.</p>

<p>To the blessed Book we went, and after reading what Jesus had said
about little children, and giving them some glimpses of His great love
for them, we told them &ldquo;the old, old story,&rdquo; as simply and
lovingly as we could. There was no more scoffing or indifference. Every
word was heard and pondered over, and from that hour a blessed work
began, which resulted in the great majority of them deciding to give
their hearts to God; and they have been true to their vows.</p>

Narrow Escape of Jack &mdash; Joyous Welcome &mdash; Society formed
&mdash; Benjamin Cameron, once a cannibal, now a lay helper &mdash;
Plum-pudding &mdash; A striking instance of honesty.</a></h3>

<p>In December, 1877, I made a journey to the Indians living at Sandy
Bar. As there were some experiences quite different from those of other
trips, they shall here be recorded.</p>

<p>Sandy Bar, or White Mud, as some call it, is over a hundred miles
south of Beren's River, where we then resided. We made the usual
preparations for our journey, getting sleds loaded with supplies for
ourselves and fish for our dogs, with all the cooking arrangements
necessary for a month's absence from home.</p>

<p>As the people among whom we were going were poor, we ever felt that,
Paul-like, for the furtherance of the Gospel, the wisest course among
those bands who had not fully accepted salvation was to keep ourselves as
far as possible from being burdensome unto them. So my good wife cooked a
generous supply of meat and buns, made as rich with fat as possible.
Fortunate indeed were we in having supplies sufficient for this to be
done. It was not always so. At this very Mission, all we had one morning
for breakfast was a hind-quarter of a wild cat!</p>

<p>All our preparations were completed, and we were ready to start at one
o'clock in the morning. To our great regret a fierce storm arose, and so
we were obliged to wait until the day dawned, ere we could harness our
dogs and venture out. When we had gone about twenty miles, the storm
swept with such power over the great Lake Winnipeg, driving the recently
fallen snow before it, with such a stinging, blinding effect, that we
were forced to give up the struggle, and run into the forest and
camp.</p>

<p>We cleared away the snow from a space about eight feet square. At one
side of this we built up our fire, and over the rest of the cleared space
we spread some evergreen boughs, on which we placed our beds. We
unharnessed our dogs, and thawed out for them some frozen fish. As this
was one of my short trips, I had with me but two dog-trains and two good
Indians. We melted snow in our kettles, and made tea, and cooked some
meat. This, with the bread, of which we were on this trip the happy
possessors, constituted our meals. About sundown we had prayers, and
then, as we had been up most of the previous night, we wrapped ourselves
in our robes and blankets, and went to sleep to the lullaby of the
howling tempest.</p>

<p>About ten o'clock that night I woke up, and, uncovering my head, found
that the storm had ceased. I sprang up and kindled the fire, but my
fingers ached and my body shivered ere I succeeded in getting it to blaze
brightly. I filled the tea-kettle with snow, and while it was melting I
called up my two travelling companions, and also a couple of young
natives, who, with their dog-trains, had joined us. The Indians can tell
with marvellous accuracy the hour of the night by the position of the
Great Bear in the heavens. This is their night clock. I saw by their
puzzled looks, as they gazed at the stars, that they wanted to tell me I
had made a great mistake, if I thought it was near morning. But I did not
give them the opportunity, and only hurried up the breakfast. After
prayers we harnessed our dogs, tied up our loads of bedding, food,
kettles, and other things; and then, throwing the boughs on which we had
slept on the fire, by the light which it afforded us, we wended our way
out through the forest gloom to the frozen lake.</p>

<p>Taking the lead with my own splendid dogs, we travelled at such a rate
that, ere the sun rose up to cheer us, over forty miles of Winnipeg's icy
expanse lay between us and the snowy bed where we had sought shelter and
slept during the raging storm. After stopping at Dog's Head, where were a
few Indians, under the eccentric chief, Thickfoot, onward we travelled,
crossing the lake to what is called Bull's Head, where we camped for the
night. The face of the cliff is here so steep that we could not get our
heavy loads up into the forest above, so we were obliged to make our fire
and bed in the snowdrift at the base of the cliff. It was a poor place
indeed. The snow, from the constant drifting in from the lake, was very
deep. There was no shelter or screen from the fierce cold wind, which,
changing during the night, blew upon us. We tried to build up the fire,
but, owing to our peculiar position, could not change it. In the woods,
at our camps, we build the fire where the smoke will be driven from us.
If the wind changes, we change our fires. Here at the base of this cliff
we could do nothing of the kind; the result was, we were either shivering
in the bitter cold, or blinded by the smoke.</p>

<p>While in this uncomfortable plight, and trying to arrange our camp
beds on the snow, for we could not get any balsam boughs here to put
under us, we were joined by several wild Indians, who, coming down the
lake, saw our camp-fire. They had a number of thin, wild, wolfish,
half-starved Esquimaux dogs with them. They made a great fuss over me,
which here meant so much tea and food. I treated them kindly, and,
fearing for our supplies, and even our dog harness, and the other things
for which the terrible Esquimaux dog has such an appetite, I politely
informed them that I thought they would be more comfortable if they
travelled on a little further. This hint was met with loud protestations
that they could not, under any circumstances, think of denying themselves
the pleasure of at least stopping one night in the camp of the
Missionary, about whom they had heard so much as the great friend of the
Indian.</p>

<p>Of course I could not go back on my record, or resist such diplomacy;
but I saw trouble ahead, and I was not disappointed. In order to save
something, I gave to their wolfish dogs all the fish I had, which was
sufficient for my eight for several days. These the Esquimaux speedily
devoured. I made the men bring the dog harness into the camp, and with
the sleds, to save the straps and lashings, they built a little barricade
against the wind.</p>

<p>In addition to the food supplies for the trip, I had a bag of meat,
and another of buns, for my use when I should reach the village, where I
was going to preach and to teach. I gathered a pile of clubs, which I cut
from the driftwood on the shore, from which we had also obtained that for
our fire. Then, putting the bag of meat, which was frozen hard, under my
pillow, and giving the bag of buns to one of my Indians, with orders to
guard it carefully, I lay down and tried to go to sleep. Vain effort
indeed was it for a long time. No sooner were we down than in upon us
swarmed the dogs. They fought for the honour of cleaning, in dog fashion,
our meat kettle, and then began seeking for something more. Over us they
walked, and soon, by their gathering around my head, I knew they had
scented the meat. Up I sprang, and, vigorously using my clubs, a number
of which I sent among them, I soon drove them out into the darkness of
the lake. Then under my robes again I got, but not to sleep. In less than
ten minutes there was an <i>encore</i>, which was repeated several times.
At length my supply of clubs gave out. My only consolation was that the
dogs had received so many of them that they acted as though they were
ready to cry quits and behave themselves. As it looked as though they
were settling down to rest, I gladly did the same. Vain hope, indeed! I
went to sleep very quickly, for I was very weary, but I woke up in the
morning to find that there was not an ounce of meat left in the bag under
my head, nor a single bun left in the bag which the Indian had orders so
carefully to guard.</p>

<p>Our condition the next morning was not a very pleasant one. The
outlook was somewhat gloomy. Our camp was in an exposed snow-drift. We
had no roof over us. The fire was a poor one, as the drift-wood with
which it was made was wretched stuff, giving out more smoke than heat,
which, persisting in going the wrong way, often filled our eyes with
blinding tears. Our generous supply of meat, that we so much require in
this cold climate, and our rich buns, so highly prized, were devoured by
the dogs which, with the most innocent looks imaginable, sat around us in
the snow and watched our movements. Fortunately one of the Indians had
put a few plain biscuits in a small bag, which he was taking, as a great
gift, to a friend. These were brought out, and with our tea and sugar
were all we had, or could get, until we were sixty miles further south.
No time for grumbling, so we prepared ourselves for the race against the
march of hunger, which we well knew, by some bitter experiences, would,
after a few hours, rapidly gain upon us.</p>

<p>After the light breakfast we knelt down in the snow and said our
prayers, and then hurried off. My gallant dogs responded to my call upon
them so nobly that ere that short wintry day in December had fled away,
and the lake was shrouded in darkness, the flying sparks from the tops of
the little cabins of the friendly Indians told us we had conquered in the
race, although not without some narrow escapes and scars.</p>

<p>While crossing a long traverse of at least twenty-five miles, my
largest dog, Jack, went through a crack in the ice up to his collar.
These ice cracks are dangerous things. The ice, which may be several feet
thick, often bursts open with a loud report, making a fissure which may
be from a few inches to several feet wide. Up this fissure the water
rushes until it is level with the top. Of course, as the cold is so
intense, it soon freezes over, but it is very dangerous for travellers to
come along soon after the fissure has been made. I have seen the guide
get in more than once, and have had some very narrow escapes myself. On
this occasion I was riding on the sled; the two foremost dogs of the
train got across the thinly frozen ice all right, but Jack, who was
third, broke though into the cold water below. The head dogs kept pulling
ahead, and the sled dog did his work admirably, and so we saved the noble
St. Bernard from drowning, and soon got him out. The cold was so intense
that in a few minutes his glossy black coat was covered with a coat of
icy mail. He seemed to know the danger he was in; and so, the instant I
got the sled across the ice crack, he started off direct for the distant
forest at such a rate that he seemed to drag the other dogs as well as
myself most of the time. We were about twelve miles from the shore, but
in a little more than an hour the land was reached, and as there was
abundance of dry wood here, a good fire was soon kindled, before which,
on a buffalo skin, I placed my ice-covered companion. He turned himself
around when necessary, and, ere the other sled arrived, Jack was himself
again. As two of the Indians behind us had fallen into this same fissure,
we were delayed for some time in getting them dry again.</p>

<p>We boiled our kettle and had some more tea, and then on we hurried. I
met with a very warm welcome from the people. The greater part of them
were Indians I had met in other years. Many were from Norway House. To
this place they had come, attracted by the stories of its valuable
fisheries and productive soil. So rapidly had the Mission at Norway House
increased that fish and game were beginning to fail. Hence a large number
emigrated to this and other places.</p>

<p>To this place they had come late in the summer, and so the little
houses they had built were small and cold. Then, to make matters worse,
the fisheries had not proved to be what they had been represented. They
crowded round me as I drove into their village, and told me of their
&ldquo;hungerings oft,&rdquo; and other hardships. As some sleds were
ready to start for Manitoba, I hurried into one of the little homes to
pencil a note to my Chairman, the Rev. George Young, but found it to be
almost an impossibility, as the four fingers of my right hand were
frozen. These, and a frozen nose, reminded me for several days of that
sixty miles' run on short rations.</p>

<p>I found, in addition to the Christian Indians, quite a number of
others who had been attracted to this place. I spent eight days among
them. They had about a dozen little houses, in addition to a large number
of wigwams. For their supplies they were depending on their rabbit
snares, and their nets for fish, which were obtained in but limited
quantities. As my food had been stolen from me by the dogs, I had nothing
but what they gave me; but of their best they supplied me most
cheerfully, and so I breakfasted, dined, and supped on rabbit or fish,
and fared well.</p>

<p>I preached, as was my custom, three times a day, and kept school
between the services. I organised a class or society of thirty-five
members, ten of whom for the first time now decided for Christ, and
resolved henceforth to be His loyal followers. It was a great joy to be
gathering in those decided ones, as the result of the seed sown amidst
the discouragements of earlier years. I was very fortunate in securing a
good leader, or spiritual overseer, for this little flock in the
wilderness. Benjamin Cameron was his name. He had had a strange career.
He had been a cannibal in his day, but Divine Grace had gone down into
the depths of sin into which he had sunk, and had lifted him out, and put
his feet upon the Rock, and filled his lips with singing, and his heart
with praise. He was emphatically &ldquo;a good man, and full of the Holy
Ghost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hours I spent with the children were very pleasant and profitable.
I was pleased to hear the elder children read so well, and was especially
delighted with their knowledge of the Catechism in both Cree and English.
I distributed a fresh supply of books which I had brought them, and also
gave to the needy ones some warm, comfortable garments sent by loving
friends from Montreal.</p>

<p>If the dear friends, into whose hearts the good desire to send these
very comfortable garments had been put, could only have seen how much
misery was relieved, and happiness conferred, they would have felt amply
rewarded for their gifts.</p>

<p>In connection with one of the Sunday services I administered the
Sacrament of the Lord's Supper. We had a most solemn and impressive yet
delightful time. The Loving Saviour seemed very near, and fresh vows and
covenants were entered into by all, that to Him they would be true.</p>

<p>I spent Christmas among them, and as one of them had succeeded in
getting some minks in his traps, and for the skins had obtained from some
passing &ldquo;free-traders&rdquo; some flour and plums, they got up in
honour of my visit a plum-pudding. It haunts me yet, and so I will not
here describe it.</p>

<p>As beautiful weather favoured us on our return, we took the straight
route home, and arrived there in two days, rejoicing that the trip, as
regarded its spiritual aspects, had been a great success.</p>

<p>One day an Indian came into my house and threw down a fine haunch of
venison upon the table. As we were poorly off for food, I was very much
pleased, and said to him, &ldquo;What shall I give you for this
meat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;it belongs to
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must be mistaken,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I never had any
dealings with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I had with you,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;And so this meat
is yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Being unacquainted with the man, I asked him to tell me who he was,
and how he made it out that this meat belonged to me.</p>

<p>Said he, &ldquo;Did you not go to Nelson River with dogs and Indians
about two moons ago?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I was out hunting deer, but I did not have much luck. The
snow was deep, the deer were very shy, and I had no success. One day,
when very hungry, for I had only taken a little dried rabbit meat with me
from my wigwam, I came across your trail, and I found where your Indians
had made a <i>cache</i>, that is, a big bundle of provisions and other
things had been tied up in a blanket, and then a small tree had been bent
down by your men, and the bundle fastened on the top, and let spring up
again to keep it from the wolves. I saw your bundle hanging there, and as
I was very hungry I thought, 'Now if the kind-hearted Missionary only
knew the poor Indian hunter was here looking at his bundle of food, he
would say, &ldquo;Help yourself;"' and that was what I did. I bent down
the tree, and found the large piece of pemmican. I cut off a piece big
enough to make me a good dinner, then I tied up the bundle again, and let
it swing up as you had it. And now I have brought you this venison in
place of what I took.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was pleased with his honesty, and had in the incident another
example of the Indian quickness to read much where the white man sees
nothing.</p>

<p>The reason why we had made the <i>cache</i> which the Indian had
discovered was, that we had taken a large quantity of pemmican for our
food, as the people we wore going to see were poor, and we did not wish
to be a burden to them; but we had been caught in a terrible storm, and
as the snow was very deep, making the travelling heavy, we were obliged
to lighten our loads as soon as possible. So we left a portion, as the
Indian has described, on the way.</p>

<p>When we returned to the <i>cache</i>, and my men pulled it down and
opened the bundle, one of them quickly cried out, &ldquo;Somebody has
been at our <i>cache</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;nobody would disturb it. And
then there were no tracks around when we reached here
to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Looking at the largest piece of pemmican, the Indians said,
&ldquo;Missionary, somebody has taken down our bundle and cut off a piece
just here. That there are no tracks, is because there have been so many
snow-storms lately. All tracks made a few days ago are covered
up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As I knew they were so much quicker along these lines of education
than white men, I did not argue any more with them. The coming of the old
hunter with the venison was the proof of the cleverness of my men, and
also a very honourable act on his part. I kept the old man to dinner, and
among other things I asked him how he knew it was the Missionary's party
that passed that way. He quickly replied, &ldquo;By your tracks in the
snow. Indians' toes turn in when they walk, white men's toes turn
out.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_14">Chapter Thirteen. An Indian Lovefeast
&mdash; Many witnesses &mdash; Sweet songs of Zion &mdash; The Lord's
Supper &mdash; Memoir of William Memotas, the devoted Christian.</a></h3>

<p>Our Lovefeasts and sacramental services were always well attended, if
it were within the range of possibility for the Indians to be present. To
come in on Saturday from their distant hunting grounds sixty miles away,
that they might enjoy the services of the Lord's house on His own day,
was no unusual thing. Then on Monday morning we have seen them again
strap on their snowshoes, and with glad hearts and renewed zeal start off
to return to their lonely hunting camps in the distant forests.</p>

<p>They are able to express themselves clearly, and often quite
eloquently. When their hearts are full of the love of God, and they are
rejoicing in the blessed assurance of the Divine favour, they are willing
to speak about it.</p>

<blockquote><br>
 &ldquo;What they have felt and seen<br>
         With confidence they tell.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
</blockquote>

<p>Here are some of their testimonies. Those are the living words of men
and women who were once the slaves of a debasing paganism. But on their
hearts the blessed Spirit shone, and to His pleading voice they
responded, and now, happy in the consciousness that they are the children
of God, they love to talk about what wonderful things have been done for
them and wrought in them. Timothy Bear said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is such a joy to me, that I can tell you of great things
done for me. Great is the joy I have in my heart to-day. I rest in the
consciousness that He is my own reconciled Heavenly Father, and so I feel
it good to be here in the Lord's house, and with those that love Him. The
good Spirit gives me to see how good and kind my heavenly Father is; and
so I can say that the greatest anxiety of my heart and life is to serve
God better and better as I grow older. To do this I have found out that I
must have Divine help. But He is my Helper for everything, and so I need
not fail. So I am encouraged that I shall love God more and more, and,
with that, I want to love His cause and people, and those who have not
yet become His people, that they may soon do so, more and more. For the
conversion of the unsaved, let us, who feel that Jesus saves us, pray
more earnestly than over, and may God help us to live our religion, that
the heathen around us may see in our lives what a wonderful thing it
is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Timothy's burning words produced a deep impression, and some one began
to sing:</p>

<blockquote><br>
 &ldquo;Ayume-oo-we-nah,&rdquo;<br>
<br>
 &ldquo;The praying Spirit breathe.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
</blockquote>

<p>Half a dozen were on their feet when the verses were sung, but Thomas
Walker spoke first. He said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I first heard the Gospel long winters ago, as brought to
us by Mr Evans, I was soon convinced that I was a sinner and needed
forgiveness. I found I could not of myself get rid of my sins, so I
believed in Christ, and found that He had power to forgive. I was very
wretched before I was forgiven. I was afraid I should be lost for ever. I
mourned and wept before God on account of my sins. In the woods alone, I
cried in my troubles, and was in deep distress. But I heard of the love
and power, and willingness to save, of this Jesus of the great Book, and
so I exercised a living faith in Him; and as I believed, God's voice was
heard, saying, 'My son, I have forgiven your sins; I have blotted them
out. Go in peace.' I am sure I was not mistaken; I felt filled with peace
and joy. I felt that I, Thomas Walker, was cleansed from my many sins,
and clothed with the garments of salvation. That was a blessed day when
the Spirit of God shone into my heart and drove out the darkness. Since
then, my way in Him has been like the sunlight on the waters. The more
waves, the more sunshine. I am happy in His love to-day. I am confident
that, because He aids me, I am growing in grace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I rejoice at being spared to come to another celebration of the
Lord's Supper; and in view of partaking of the emblems of the dying,
loving Jesus, I feel that my soul is feeding on Christ, the true Bread of
Life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Earnest yet suppressed words of praise and adoration quietly dropped
from many lips as Thomas ended. Then dear old Henry Budd succeeded in
getting a hearing. Henry was Mr Evans' marvellous dog-driver over
twenty-five years before the date of this blessed lovefeast. He had had
many wonderful adventures and some narrow escapes. Once, when running
ahead on a treacherous river, where in places the current was very rapid,
and consequently the ice was thin, he broke through into the current
underneath. He quickly caught hold of the edge of the ice, but it was so
weak it would not hold him up. His only comrade could not get very near
him as the ice was so bad, and so had to run about a mile for a rope.
When he returned, so intense was the cold that both of Henry's hands,
with which he had been holding on to the ice, were frozen. He was utterly
unable to close them on the rope. George shouted to him to open his
mouth. The rope was then thrown, lasso-like, so skilfully, that the poor
half-frozen man seized it in his teeth, and was thus dragged out, and
rushed off to the nearest wigwam. He was literally saved by the
&ldquo;skin of his teeth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus Henry Budd had, like many others, much for which to praise God.
He spoke on this occasion as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I rejoice in God my Saviour, Who has done such wonderful things
for me. I feel very happy. I am His child. He is my reconciled Father.
How can I help being happy?</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I first began to get my poor blind eyes opened, and there
came to me a desire to seek God, and to obtain salvation for my soul, I
was troubled on account of my sins. My many transgressions rose up before
me like a cloud. I was ignorant, and so my mind was full of doubts and
fears. Yet with all my doubts there was the anxious desire to be saved.
But the victory came at last. I was enabled to hear enough about the
Almighty Friend, and so, as I had confidence in His power and love, and
believed in Him, I was at last enabled to rejoice in the knowledge of
sins forgiven through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. From those sad
doubts and fears I am now happily delivered. I feel I love God, and that
God loves me. I am growing in grace, and in the knowledge of God my
Saviour. My hopes are brightening all the time. I am getting old, but not
unhappy, for I am cheered with the blessed assurance of one day meeting,
in my Father's house in heaven, with many who are safely there, and many
more who, like me, will soon enter in. That this may be a blessed
certainty, I desire to be faithful unto the end, that no man take my
crown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Henry sat down, before another one could be heard, the large
congregation were singing:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><br>
 &ldquo;Pe teh-na-mah-me cha-te yak<br>
         Ke ehe ne-ka-mo-yak,&rdquo; etc.<br>
<br>
 &ldquo;O for a thousand tongues to sing<br>
         My great Redeemer's praise.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
</blockquote>

<p>The next to get the floor was one of the sweetest, purest Christians
it was ever my lot to become acquainted with in any land. His name was
William Memotas. He was a very happy Christian. As he was a Local
Preacher and a Class Leader, I was much in his society, and I can say, as
many others have said, that William since the day of his conversion was
never heard to utter an unkind word about any one, or do anything that
could give the enemies of the Lord Jesus an opportunity to scoff at his
profession of loving the Lord with all his heart. He was never a very
strong man physically while we knew him, and so was unable to go on the
long tripping or hunting expeditions with him more vigorous comrades. He
suffered much from inward pain, but was ever bright and hopeful. When he
stood up to add his testimony, the sick, pallid face caused a wave of
sympathy to pass over the audience, but his cheery words quickly lifted
the cloud, and we seemed to look through the open door into the celestial
city, into which he was so soon to enter. His obituary, which I wrote at
the time of his death, is added at the close of this chapter. He
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For many years I have now been walking in this way, and proving
this great salvation. It is a blessed way, and it is getting more
delightful all the time. Every day on it is a day's walk nearer Jesus. It
is not like the trails in our country, sometimes rocks, and then more
often muskegs and quaking bogs; but it is the solid rock all the time,
and on it we may always be sure of our footing, and it leads us up to Him
Who is the Rock of Ages. I am not now a strong man, as you know I once
was. This poor weak body is like the old wigwam. It is breaking up. As
each storm tears fresh rents in the old wigwam, so each attack of disease
seems to tear me, and bring me nearer the time when what is immortal of
me shall slip away from the worn body into the everlasting brightness of
that land where the happy people never say, 'I am sick.' I am very glad
and happy in the service of this Jesus, and will serve Him as long as He
lends me health. But I do want to go home. I cannot do much more here.
Our Missionary, Mr Young, said to me, 'William, don't talk so much about
leaving us. How can we spare you?' I thank him for his love and
friendship, but there is another Friend I am getting such a longing in my
heart to see, and that is Jesus, my Saviour, my Redeemer. I am praying
for patience, but by-and-by I shall be with Him, with him for evermore.
There I shall have no pain, and I will praise my Jesus for evermore. So,
while waiting, I ask God to be with me here, and to let me serve Him in
some way every day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With suppressed emotion, for many eyes were full of tears, the people
sang&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><br>
 &ldquo;Tapwa meyoo ootaskewuk,<br>
         Ispemik ayahchik,&rdquo; etc.<br>
<br>
 &ldquo;There is a land of pure delight,<br>
         Where saints immortal reign.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
</blockquote>

<p>William was a sweet singer, and joined heartily with the rest in
singing several verses of that grand old hymn. We had a presentiment that
the end was not far off, but we little thought, as we looked into his
radiant face, and heard his clear scriptural testimony, and his longings
for rest and heaven, that this was to be the last Lovefeast in which our
dear brother was to be with us. Ere another similar service was held,
William Memotas had gone sweeping through the gates, washed in the blood
of the Lamb.</p>

<p>James Cochrane, a Class Leader, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have great reason to bless God for the privileges and mercies
I have had from him. I am so glad to be with you to-day in his house. I
try to arrange all my huntings and journeys so as to be present at all of
these lovefeasts and sacraments. Since I decided, many years ago, to give
up paganism and become a Christian, I have never missed one of these
meetings, though sometimes I have had to take several days and travel
hundreds of miles to get here. I only had to travel sixty miles on my
snow-shoes to be here to-day. It has paid me well to come. I rejoice that
God has enabled me to be faithful all these years since I started in His
service. When I first began, I had a great many doubts and fears. The way
seemed very long ahead of me. I felt so weak and so prone to sin. It
seemed impossible that such a weak, unworthy creature as I could stand
true and faithful; but trusting in God, and constantly endeavouring to
exercise a living faith in Christ, I have been kept to this day, and I
can say I realise a daily growth in grace. I ask God to give me His Holy
Spirit to help me to follow Christ's example and to keep all of God's
commandments. May I, too, prove faithful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary Cook, a very old woman, who has had to endure persecution for
Christ's sake, spoke next. She said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very glad to be here once more. I have many pagan
relatives who have no feeling of friendship towards me, because I am a
follower of Jesus. But He is my Friend, so it is all right. I have been
very sick, and thought that God was going to take me home to heaven. That
thought made me very happy in my sickness. My poor little room often
seemed light with the presence of my Lord. I love to dwell with God's
people. It is my chief joy. I refused to go and live with my relatives in
the woods, even though I should be better off, because I love the house
of God, and because I so love to worship with God's people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary Oig said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very happy do I feel in my heart to-day. My heart is filled
with his love. I knew I love Him and his people; and His service is to me
a great delight. Once, like many others, I was in the great darkness,
wandering in sin; but God sought me by His Holy Spirit, and convinced me
of my lost condition, and shewed me Himself as my only Hope, and enabled
me to rejoice in his pardoning mercy through faith in the Atonement. May
God keep me faithful, that with you I may join around the Throne
above.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thomas Mamanowatum, generally known as &ldquo;Big Tom,&rdquo; on
account of his almost gigantic size, was the next to speak. He is one of
the best of men. I have used him to help me a good deal, and have ever
found him one of the worthiest and truest assistants. His people all love
and trust him. He is perhaps the most influential Indian in the village.
Tom said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I, too, desire to express my gratitude to God for His great
blessings and mercies to me. I am like David, who said, 'Come, all ye who
fear the Lord, and I will tell you what He hath done for my soul.' He has
taken me out of the pit of sin, and set me on the rock. So I rejoice, for
I have felt and tasted of His love. When I think of what he has done for
me, and then think of what I have been, I feel that I am not worthy even
to stand up in such a place as this. But He is worthy, and so I must
praise Him. I have a comfortable assurance that He, my good Father, is
contented with me. But it is only because the grace of God is sufficient
to keep me. I am growing in grace, and I desire more than ever to glorify
God in all I think, or speak, or do. I have been helping our Missionary
at Beren's River in the good work among the people there. I often felt
happy while endeavouring to point my heathen brethren to Jesus Christ,
Who takes away the sins of the world. My first consecration was of
myself, when converted to Christ. My second was of my family to Him. My
third is of my class. I am often very happy while trying to lead them on
in the way to heaven. To-day I renew my vows of consecration. I offer the
sacrifice of thanksgiving, for He is my God and my portion for ever. As
He is the Source of Love and Light and Safety, I want to be continually
drawing nearer to Him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Very appropriate was the hymn which was next sung,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><br>
 &ldquo;Ke-se-wog-ne-man-toom<br>
         Ke-nah-te-tin,&rdquo; etc.,<br>
<br>
 &ldquo;Nearer, my God, to Thee.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
</blockquote>

<p>After three verses of this beautiful hymn were sung, we had a large
number of short testimonies. Some of the people beautifully expressed
themselves by quoting passages from their Indian Bibles. For example, one
said: &ldquo;The joy of the Lord is my portion.&rdquo; Another:
&ldquo;The Lord is my Shepherd; I shall not want.&rdquo; Another:
&ldquo;Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear
what we shall be: but we know that, when He shall appear, we shall be
like Him; for we shall see him as He is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus delightfully passed away two hours. Perhaps fifty or sixty gave
their testimonies, or quoted passages of Scripture. The speaking was up
to the average of a similar gathering among white people, as these
examples we have given would indicate. They were faithfully translated by
two of our best interpreters, and then compared. And yet many of the
beautiful Indian images are lost in the translation into English.</p>

<p>The best of all has also to be left out. The Divine power, the holy
emotions, the shining faces, the atmosphere of heaven, cannot be put down
on paper. Many of my readers know what I mean as thus I write, for they
have been in those hallowed gatherings where &ldquo;they that feared the
Lord spake often one to another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then followed the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper. To the Christian
Indians this service is, as it ever should be, the most solemn and
impressive in the Church. Our custom was to hold four Communion services
during the year. In addition, we sometimes gave a dying devoted member
this sacrament, if so desired. Here there were a few other very important
occasions, when we celebrated in this way the dying of the Lord Jesus.
As, for example, when several scores of our people were going off on a
dangerous trip in a plague-infected district with but very poor prospects
of all returning home again.</p>

<h5>William Memotas.</h5>

<p>William Memotas was converted from the darkness of paganism to the
light of the Gospel soon after the introduction of the glad tidings of
salvation among the Cree Indians by that most useful and godly man, the
Rev. James Evans. William's conversion was so clear and positive that he
never had any doubts about it. His progress in the Divine life was marked
and intelligent, and soon he became a useful and acceptable worker in the
Church. He was a Class Leader and Local Preacher of great power and
acceptability.</p>

<p>He was pre-eminently a happy Christian. His face seemed full of
sunshine. There was a genial sweetness about him that caused his very
presence to act as a charm. His coming into our Mission home was like the
sunshine, in which even our little ones basked with great delight. He was
an every-day Christian. Although I was often in his company, and was
thrown in contact with him on some occasions calculated to severely test
him, yet I never heard from him an improper word, or heard of his having
in any way gone contrary to his Christian profession during the thirty
years that he had professed to be a follower of the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p>His greatest aim in life seemed to be to get to heaven; and next to
that he strove to induce others to follow in the same course.</p>

<p>When some of the Indians were getting excited about their lands, and
the treaties which were soon to be made with the Government, William, in
writing to a friend, said: &ldquo;I care for none of these things; they
will all come right. My only desire is to love Jesus more and more, so as
to see Him by-and-by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was a useful Christian, possessing a good knowledge of the roots
and herbs of his native forests, and also having had some instruction
given him in reference to some of the simpler medicines of the whites, he
was often styled our &ldquo;village doctor.&rdquo; Although seldom
remunerated for his services, he was always ready to listen to the calls
of the afflicted, and, with Heaven's blessing, was instrumental in
accomplishing some marvellous cures. He believed in using a good deal of
prayer with his medicines. His skill in dressing and curing gun-shot
wounds could not be excelled.</p>

<p>Yet, while doing all he could to cure others, his own health was very
poor for several years. He suffered frequently from violent headaches
that caused intense pain. Yet he was never heard to murmur or complain,
but would say to us, when we tried to sympathise with him, &ldquo;Never
mind, by-and-by I shall get home, and when I see Jesus I shall have no
more pain.&rdquo; About nine days before his departure he caught a severe
cold that settled upon his lungs, which seemed to have been diseased for
a long time. He had from the beginning a presentiment that his sickness
was &ldquo;unto death,&rdquo; and never did a weary toiler welcome his
bed of rest with greater delight than did William the grave. The prospect
of getting to heaven seemed so fully to absorb his thoughts that he
appeared dead to everything earthly. In life he had been a most loving
and affectionate husband and father, but now, with a strong belief in
God's promises of protection and care over the widow and fatherless, he
resigned his family into the Lord's hands, and then seemed almost to
banish them from his thoughts.</p>

<p>Being very poor on account of his long-continued ill health, which had
incapacitated him for work, he had, when his severe illness began,
nothing to eat but fish. We cheerfully supplied him with what things our
limited means would allow, to alleviate his sorrows and poverty. One day,
when my beloved Brother Semmens and I had visited him, we had prayer and
a blessed talk with him. As we were leaving him, after giving him some
tangible evidences of our love, Brother Semmens said, &ldquo;Now, Brother
William, can we do anything else for you? Do you want anything
more?&rdquo; The poor sick man turned his radiant face towards us and
said, &ldquo;O no, I want nothing now, but more of Christ.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He often conversed with us about his glorious prospects and the joy
and happiness he felt as the pearly gates of the Golden City seemed to be
opening before him. Here are some of his dying words whispered either to
my beloved colleague or to myself. Would that we could portray the scene,
or describe the happy, shining face of the dying man, lying there on a
bed of blankets and rabbit skins in his little dwelling!</p>

<p>He said, &ldquo;While my body is getting weaker, my faith is getting
stronger, and I am very happy in Jesus' love. Very glad am I that I
responded to Mr Evans' invitations, and gave my heart to Him Who has
saved me and kept me so happy in His love. I am so glad I was permitted
to do some little work for Jesus. He used to help me when I tried to talk
about His love and recommend Him to others. I used to get very happy in
my own soul when thus working for Him. I am happier now than ever before.
I am resting in His love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus would the happy man talk on as long as his strength permitted. It
was ever a blessing to visit him. It wonderfully encouraged and
strengthened us in our work. One day, as we came from one of these
blessed visits, Brother Semmens burst out in almost ecstatic
delight,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><br>
 &ldquo;O may I triumph so<br>
 When all my warfare's past!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
</blockquote>

<p>When we administered to him the emblems of the broken body and spilt
blood of the Redeemer, he was much affected, and exclaimed, &ldquo;My
precious Saviour! I shall soon see Him. 'That will be joy for
evermore.'&ldquo;</p>

<p>Once, when conversing with him, I happened to say, &ldquo;I hope you
will not leave us. We want you to remain with us. We need you to help us
to preach. We need you in the Sunday School and in the Prayer Meetings.
Your sixty class members are full of sorrow at your sickness. They think
they cannot spare you. Do not be in a hurry to leave us, William. We want
your presence, your example, your prayers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He listened patiently while I talked, and then he looked up at me so
chidingly, like a weary, home-sick child, and exclaimed, in a voice that
showed that earth had lost all its charms, &ldquo;Why do you wish to
detain me? You know I want to go home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shortly after, his heart's desire was his in actual possession.
Triumphantly he went home. While we felt that our Mission was much the
loser by his departure, we knew it was better for him, and an accession
to heaven's glorious company of one who was worthy to mingle with the
white-robed throng around the throne of God.</p>

<p>There is nothing that more roots and grounds us in this blessed
Gospel, and more stimulates us to labour on even amidst hardships and
sufferings, than the consistent lives and triumphant deaths of our Indian
converts.</p>

<p>Ignorant as many of them are of the non-essentials of our religion,
yet possessing by the Spirit's influence a vivid knowledge of their state
by nature, and of the Saviour's love for them, they cling to Him with a
faith so strong and abiding, that the blessed assurance of His favour
abides with them as a conscious reality through life; and when the end
draws near, sustained by His presence, even the Valley of the Shadow of
Death is entered with delight.</p>

<p>The Missions among the Indians of North America have not been
failures. The thousands converted from different tribes, and now before
the throne of God, and the many true and steadfast ones following after,
tell us that although many of the toilers among them, as they went with
the seed, literally went forth weeping, yet the harvest has been an
abundant one, and has more than compensated for the tears and toils of
the sewers.</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_15">Chapter Fourteen. Varied duties

<p>Very diversified were our duties among these Indians. Not only were
there those that in all places are associated with ministerial or
pastoral work, but there were also many others, peculiar to this kind of
missionary toil. Following closely on the acceptance of the spiritual
blessings of the Gospel came the desire for temporal progress and
development. Christianity must ever precede a real and genuine
civilisation. To reverse this order of proceedings has always resulted in
humiliating failure among the North American Indians.</p>

<p>Sir Francis Bond Head, one of the early Governors of Canada, took a
great interest in the Indians. He zealously endeavoured to improve them,
and honestly worked for their advancement. He gathered together a large
number of them at one of their settlements, and held a great council with
them. Oxen were killed, and flour and tea and tobacco were provided in
large quantities. The Indians feasted and smoked, and listened
attentively to this great man who represented the Queen, and who, having
also supplied them with food for the great feast, was worthy of all
attention.</p>

<p>The Governor told them that the great object of his coming to see
them, and thus feasting them, was to show his kindness to them, and
interest in their welfare. Then, with much emphasis he told them how the
game was disappearing, and the fish also would soon not be so plentiful,
and, unless they settled down and cultivated the soil, they would suffer
from hunger, and perhaps starve to death. He got them to promise that
they would begin this new way of life. As they were feeling very
comfortable while feasting on his bounties, they were in the humour of
promising everything he desired. Very much delighted at their docility,
he said he would send them axes to clear more of their land, and oxen and
ploughs to prepare it for seed; and when all was ready he would send them
seed grain. Great were their rejoicings at these words, and with stately
ceremony the council broke up.</p>

<p>In a few days along came the ploughs, oxen, and axes. It was in the
pleasant springtime, but instead of going to work and ploughing up what
land there was cleared in their village, and beginning with their axes to
get more ready, they held a council among themselves. These were their
conclusions: &ldquo;These axes are bright and shine like glass. If we use
them to cut down trees, they will lose their fine appearance. Let us keep
them as ornaments. These oxen now are fat and good. If we fasten them up
to these heavy ploughs, and make them drag them through the ground, they
will soon get poor and not fit for food. Let us make a great
feast.&rdquo; So they killed the oxen, and invited all of the surrounding
Indians to join them, and as long as a piece of meat was left the pots
were kept boiling.</p>

<p>Thus ended, just as many other efforts of the kind have ended, this
effort to civilise the Indians before Christianising them.</p>

<p>We found that almost in proportion to the genuineness of the Indian's
acceptance of the Gospel was his desire to improve his temporal
circumstances. Of course there were some places where the Indians could
not cultivate the land. We were four hundred miles north of the fertile
prairies of the great western part of the Dominion of Canada, where
perhaps a hundred millions of people will yet find happy times. From
these wondrously fertile regions my Nelson River Indians were at least
six hundred miles north. As hunters and fishermen these men, and those at
Oxford Mission, and indeed nearly all in those high latitudes, must live.
But where there was land to cultivate the Indians had their gardens and
little fields.</p>

<p>I carried out with me four potatoes. I did not get them in the ground
until the 6th of August. Yet in the short season left I succeeded in
raising a few little ones. These I carefully packed in cotton wool and
kept safe from the frost. The next year I got from them a pailful. The
yield the third year was six bushels, and the fourth year one hundred and
twenty-five bushels; and before I left the Indians were raising thousands
of bushels from those four potatoes. They had had some before, but there
had been some neglect, and they had run out.</p>

<p>One summer I carried out, in a little open boat from Red River, a good
Scotch iron beam plough. The next winter, when I came in to the District
Meeting, I bought a bag of wheat containing two bushels and a half; and I
got also thirty-two iron harrow teeth. I dragged these things, with many
others, including quite an assortment of garden seeds, on my dog-trains,
all the way to Norway House. I harnessed eight dogs to my plough, and
ploughed up my little fields; and, after making a harrow, I harrowed in
my wheat with the dogs. The first year I had thirty bushels of beautiful
wheat. This I cut with a sickle, and then thrashed it with a flail. Mrs
Young sewed several sheets together, and one day, when there was a
steady, gentle breeze blowing, we winnowed the chaff from the wheat in
the wind. There were no mills within hundreds of miles of us; so we
merely cracked the wheat in a hand coffee-mill, and used some of it for
porridge, and gave the rest to the Indians, who made use of it in their
soups.</p>

<p>Thus we laboured with them and for them, and were more and more
encouraged, as the years rolled on, at seeing how resolved they were to
improve their temporal circumstances, which at the best were not to be
envied.</p>

<p>The principal article of food was fish. The nets were in the water
from the time the ice disappeared in May until it returned in October;
and often were holes cut in the ice, and nets placed under it, for this
staple article of food.</p>

<p>The great fall fisheries were times of activity and anxiety, as the
winter's supply of food depended very much upon the numbers caught. So
steady and severe is the frost at Norway House, and at all the Missions
north of it, that the fish caught in October and the early part of
November, keep frozen solid until April. The principal fish is the white
fish, although many other varieties abound.</p>

<p>Each Indian family endeavoured to secure from three to five thousand
fish, each fall, for the winter's supply. For my own family use, and more
especially for my numerous dogs, which were required for my long winter
trips to the out Mission appointments, I used to endeavour to secure not
less than ten thousand fish. It is fortunate that those lakes and rivers
so abound in splendid varieties of fish. If it were not so, the Indians
could not exist. But, providentially,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><br>
 &ldquo;The teeming sea supplies<br>
 The food the niggard soil denies.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
</blockquote>

<p>Deer of several varieties abound, and also other animals, the flesh of
which furnishes nutritious food. But all supplies of food thus obtained
are insignificant in comparison with the fish, which the Indians are able
to obtain except in the severest weather.</p>

<p>As with the natives, so it was with the Missionaries; the principal
article of food upon their tables was fish. During the first Riel
Rebellion, when all communication with the interior was cut off, and our
supplies could not as usual be sent out to us from Red River, my good
wife and I lived on fish twenty-one times a week, for nearly six months.
Of course there were times when we had on the table, in addition to the
fish, a cooked rabbit, or it may be a piece of venison or bear's meat.
However, the great &ldquo;stand-by,&rdquo; as they say out in that land,
was the fish.</p>

<p>Every summer hundreds of Indians from other places visited us. Some
came in their small canoes, and others with the Brigades, which in those
days travelled vast distances with their loads of rich furs, which were
sent down to York Factory on the Hudson Bay, to be shipped thence to
England. Sometimes they remained several weeks between the trading post
and the Mission. Very frequent were the conversations we had with these
wandering red men about the Great Spirit and the Great Book.</p>

<p>Some, full of mischief, and at times unfortunately full of rum, used
to come to annoy and disturb us. One summer a band of Athabasca Indians
so attacked our Mission House that for three days and nights we were as
in a state of siege. Unfortunately for us our own loyal able-bodied
Indian men were all away as trip men, and the few at the Mission village
were powerless to help. Our lives were in jeopardy, and they came very
near burning down the premises.</p>

<p>Shortly after these Athabasca Indians had left us I saw a large
boatload of men coming across the lake towards our village. Imagining
them to be some of these same disturbers, I hastily rallied all the old
men I could, and went down to the shore, to keep them, if possible, from
landing. Very agreeable indeed was my surprise to find that they were a
band of earnest seekers after the Great Light, who had come a long
distance to see and talk with me. Gladly did I lead them to the Mission
House, and until midnight I endeavoured to preach to them Jesus. They
came a distance of over three hundred miles; but in that far-off district
had met in their wanderings some of our Christian Indians from Norway
House, who, always carrying their Bibles with them, had, by reading to
them and praying with them, under the good Spirit's influence, implanted
in their hearts longing desires after the great salvation. They were
literally hungering and thirsting after salvation. Before they left for
their homes, they were all baptized. Their importunate request to me on
leaving was the same as that of many others:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do come and visit us in our own land, and tell us and our
families more of these blessed truths.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From God's Lake, which is sixty miles from Oxford Lake, a deputation
of eleven Indians came to see me. They had travelled the whole distance
of two hundred and sixty miles in order that they might hear the Gospel,
and get from me a supply of Bibles, Hymn-books, and Catechisms. One of
them had been baptized and taught years ago by the Rev. H. Brooking. His
life and teachings had made the others eager for this blessed way, and so
he brought these hungry sheep in the wilderness that long distance that
they might have the truth explained to them more perfectly, and be
baptised. As it had been with the others who came from a different
direction, so it was with these. Their earnest, oft-repeated entreaty
was, &ldquo;Come and visit us and ours in our far-away homes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A few weeks after, another boatload of men called to have a talk with
me. They seated themselves on the grass in front of the Mission House,
and at first acted as though they expected me to begin the conversation.
I found out very soon that they were Saulteaux, and had come from Beren's
River, about a hundred and fifty miles away. After a few words as to
their health and families had passed between us, an old man, who seemed
to be the spokesman of the party, said, &ldquo;Well, Ayumeaookemou&rdquo;
(&ldquo;praying master,&rdquo; the Missionary's name), &ldquo;do you
remember your words of three summers ago?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What were my words of three summers ago?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;your words were that you would
write to the Keche-ayumeaookemou&rdquo; (the great praying masters, the
Missionary Secretaries) &ldquo;for a Missionary for us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When I first passed through their country, they with tears in their
eyes had begged for a Missionary. I had been much moved by their appeals,
and had written to the Mission House about them and for them, but all in
vain. None had come to labour among them.</p>

<p>For my answer to this old man's words I translated a copy of my
letter, which had been published, and in which I had strongly urged their
claims for a Missionary. They all listened attentively to the end, and
then the old man sprang up and said, &ldquo;We all thank you for sending
that word, but <i>where is the Missionary</i>?&rdquo; I was lost for an
answer, for I felt that I was being asked by this hungering soul the most
important question that can be heard by the Christian Church, to whom God
has committed the great work of the world's evangelisation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i><b>Where is the Missionary</b></i>?&rdquo; The question
thrilled me, and I went down before it like the reed before the storm. I
could only weep and say, &ldquo;Lord, have mercy upon me and on the
apathetic Christian world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was the hardest question a human being ever asked me. To tell him
of a want of men, or a lack of money, to carry the glad tidings of
salvation to him and his people, would only have filled his mind with
doubts as to the genuineness of the religion enjoyed by a people so
numerous and rich as he knew the whites were. So I tried to give them
some idea of the world's population, and the vast number yet unconverted
to Christianity. I told him the Churches were at work in many places and
among many nations, but that many years would pass away before all the
world would be supplied with Missionaries.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How many winters will pass by before that time comes?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A great many, I fear,&rdquo; was my answer.</p>

<p>He put his hands through his long hair, once as black as a raven's
wing, but now becoming silvered, and replied: &ldquo;These white hairs
show that I have lived many winters, and am getting old. My countrymen at
Red River on the south of us, and here at Norway House on the north of
us, have Missionaries, and churches, and schools; and we have none. I do
not wish to die until we have a church and a school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The story of this old man's appeal woke up the good people of the
Churches, and something was soon done for these Indians. I visited them
twice a year by canoe and dog-train, and found them anxious for religious
instruction and progress.</p>

<p>At first I sent to live among them my faithful interpreter, Timothy
Bear. He worked faithfully and did good service. He was not a strong man
physically, and could not stand much exposure. To live in, he had my
large leather tent, which was made of the prepared skins of the buffalo.
One night a great tornado swept over the country, and Timothy's tent was
carried away, and then the drenching rains fell upon him and his. A
severe cold resulted, and when word reached me several weeks after at
Norway House, it was that my trusted friend was hopelessly ill, but was
still endeavouring to keep at his duties.</p>

<p>So great was my anxiety to go and comfort him that I started out with
my dog-trains so soon after the winter set in that that trip very nearly
proved to be my last. The greater part of that journey was performed upon
Lake Winnipeg. Very frequently on the northern end of that lake the ice,
which there forms first, is broken up by the fierce winds from the
southern end, which, being three hundred miles further south, remains
open several days longer. I had with me two Indians, &mdash; one was an
old experienced man, named William Cochran; the other a splendid specimen
of physical manhood, named Felix.</p>

<p>When we reached Lake Winnipeg, as far as we could judge by the
appearance of the ice, it must have formed three times, and then have
been broken up by the storms. The broken masses were piled up in
picturesque ridges along the shore, or frozen together in vast fields
extending for many miles. Over these rough ice-fields, where great pieces
of ice, from five to twenty feet high, were thrown at every angle, and
then frozen solid, we travelled for two days. Both men and dogs suffered
a great deal from falls and bruises. Our feet at times were bruised and
bleeding. Just about daybreak, on our third day, as we pushed out from
our camp in the woods where we had passed the night, when we had got a
considerable distance from the shore, Felix was delighted to find smooth
ice. He was guiding at the time. He put on his skates and bounded off
quickly, and was soon followed by the dogs, who seemed as delighted as he
that the rough ice had all been passed, and now there was a possibility
of getting on with speed and comfort.</p>

<p>Just as I was congratulating myself on the fact of our having reached
good ice, and that now there was a prospect of soon reaching my sick
Indian brother, a cry of terror came from William, the experienced Indian
who was driving our provision sled behind mine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This ice is bad, and we are sinking,&rdquo; he shouted.</p>

<p>Thinking the best way for me was to stop I checked my dogs, and at
once began to sink.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep moving, but make for the shore,&rdquo; was the instant cry
of the man behind.</p>

<p>I shouted to my splendid, well-trained dogs, and they at once
responded to the command given, and bounded towards the shore.
Fortunately the ice was strong enough to hold the dogs up, although under
the sled it bent and cracked, and in some places broke through.</p>

<p>Very grateful were we when we got back to the rough strong ice near
the shore. In quiet tones we spoke a few words of congratulation to each
other, and lifted up our hearts in gratitude to our great Preserver, and
then hurried on. If we had broken in, we could have received no earthly
aid, as there was not even a wigwam within a day's journey of us.</p>

<p>That night at the camp-fire I overheard William saying to Felix,
&ldquo;I am ashamed of ourselves for not having taken better care of our
Missionary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We found Timothy very sick indeed. We ministered to his comfort, and
had it then in our power so to arrange that, while the work should not
suffer, he could have rest and quiet. His success had been very marked,
and the old Saulteaux rejoiced that he and the rest of them were to be
neglected no longer. He had made such diligent progress himself in
spiritual things that I gladly baptized him and his household.</p>

<p>There were times when our supplies ran very short, and hunger and
suffering had to be endured. During the first Riel Rebellion, when we
were cut off from access to the outside world, we were entirely dependent
upon our nets and guns for a long time. Our artist has tried to tell a
story in three pictures.</p>

<p>At the breakfast table we had nothing to eat but the hind-quarter of a
wild cat. It was very tough and tasteless; and while we were trying to
make our breakfast from it, Mrs Young said, &ldquo;My dear, unless you
shoot something for dinner, I am afraid there will be none.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So I took down my rifle, and tied on my snow-shoes, and started off
looking for game. See Picture I. Pictures II. and III. tell the rest of
the story.</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_16">Chapter Fifteen. Small-pox pestilence
&mdash; Heroic conduct of Christian Indians &mdash; Whites supplied with
provisions by Red men &mdash; The guide Samuel Papanekis &mdash; His
triumphant death &mdash; Nancy, the happy widow &mdash; In poverty, yet
rejoicing.</a></h3>

<p>We were very much shocked, during the early spring, to hear that that
terrible disease, the small-pox, had broken out among the Indians on the
great plains of the Saskatchewan.</p>

<p>It seems to have been brought into the country by some white traders
coming up from the State of Montana. When once it had got amongst them,
it spread with amazing rapidity and fatality. To make matters worse, one
of the tribes of Indians, being at war with another, secretly carried
some of the infected clothing, which had been worn by their own dead
friends, into the territory of those with whom they were at war, and left
it where it could be easily found and carried off. In this way the
disease was communicated to this second tribe, and thousands of them died
from it.</p>

<p>Every possible precaution against the spread of this terrible
destroyer was taken by the Missionaries, Messrs. McDougall and Campbell,
aided by their Christian people. But, in spite of all their efforts, it
continued cutting down both whites and Indians. To save some of his
people Mr McDougall got the Indians of his Victoria Mission to leave
their homes and scatter themselves over the great prairies, where, he
hoped, they would, by being isolated, escape the contagion. The pagan
Indians, rendered desperate under the terrible scourge which was so
rapidly cutting them off, and being powerless to check it, resolved to
wreak their vengeance upon the defenceless whites. So they sent a band of
warriors to destroy every white person in the country. The first place
they reached, where dwelt any of the pale-faces, was the Victoria Mission
on the Saskatchewan River. Indian-like, they did not openly attack, but,
leaving the greater number of their warriors in ambush in the long grass,
a few of them sauntered into the Mission House. Here, to their surprise,
they found that the small-pox had entered, and some of the inmates of the
home had died. Quickly and quietly they glided away, and told their
comrades what they had seen. A hasty consultation was held, and they
decided that it could not have been the Missionary who had control of the
disease; for, if he had, he would not have allowed it to have killed his
own. They then decided it must have been the fur-traders, and so they
started for the trading post. Here they pursued the same tactics, and
found to their surprise that a Mr Clarke, the gentleman in charge of that
place, had fallen a victim. Another hasty council made them think that
they had been mistaken, and so they quickly returned to their own country
without having injured any one.</p>

<p>But the Missionary and his family were surrounded by perils. The
Indians were excited and unsettled, and their old pagan conjurers were
ever ready to incite them to deeds of violence. The restraining power of
God alone saved them from massacre. Once the Missionary's wife and some
of the family were at work in the garden, while secreted in the long
grass not a hundred yards from them lay eleven Blackfeet, who had come to
murder and pillage the place, but, as they afterwards acknowledged, were
strangely restrained from firing. At another time some of the fierce
warriors of this same bloodthirsty tribe crawled through a field of
barley, and for a long time watched the movements of the family, and then
noiselessly retired, doing no harm to any one. To hear the ping of a
bullet as it passed in close proximity to the head was no very rare event
in the lives of several of the early Missionaries among the excited
pagans.</p>

<p>While the small-pox was raging in the Great Saskatchewan country,
strenuous efforts were made to prevent it spreading to other districts.
Manitoba had now been formed into a province, and was filling up with
white settlers. The old name, Fort Garry, had been changed to Winnipeg,
and this place was rapidly growing into a prosperous town. From Fort
Garry long trains of Red River carts had been in the habit of going for
years with the supplies needed in the far-off Saskatchewan country. These
carts were made without having in their construction a single piece of
iron. The Half-breeds or Indian drivers never oiled or greased them, and
the result was they could be heard about as far as seen, even on the
level prairies. Each cart was drawn by one ox, and was supposed to carry
from eight to twelve hundred pounds of supplies, in addition to the food
and outfit of the driver, who was always expected to walk. This
freighting by carts on the prairies is the counterpart of transporting
goods by open boats or canoes in the northern rivers, to which we have
elsewhere referred. The arrival of the brigade of carts with the
supplies, and the news from the outside world, was the great event of the
year in the early times at those lonely prairie settlements.</p>

<p>But stern measures had to be adopted in this year of the small-pox
plague. A proclamation was issued by the Governor of the Province of
Manitoba, absolutely prohibiting any trade or communication in any way
with the infected district. Not a single cart or traveller was permitted
to go on the trail. This meant a good deal of suffering and many
privations for the isolated Missionaries and traders and other whites
who, for purposes of settlement or adventure, had gone into that remote
interior country.</p>

<p>As it was, only twice a year in many places did the lonely
Missionaries hear from the outside world. Then the mail-carrier was very
welcome, whether he came by canoe or dog-train.</p>

<p>Although there were still plenty of buffalo on the plains, it was well
known that the ammunition was about exhausted, as well as all other
supplies, including medicines, now so much needed. Some interested
parties vainly urged the Governor to relent and allow some supplies to be
sent in. But, conscious of the risks that would be run of the pestilence
reaching the province over which he governed, he remained firm, while he
felt for those who necessarily must suffer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can be done to aid those unfortunate ones, who, in
addition to their sorrows and troubles incident to the ravages of the
small-pox among them, are now to be exposed to pinching famine and
want?&rdquo; was the question that sympathising friends were asking each
other. As a last resort it was decided to appeal to the Norway House
Christian Indians, and ask them to form a brigade of boats, and take the
much-needed supplies up the mighty Saskatchewan River, where they could
be reached by those needing them.</p>

<p>To me, as Missionary of these Indians, Mr Stewart, the highest
official of the Hudson's Bay Company, came; and we talked the matter
over, and the risks which the Indians, not one of whom had been
vaccinated, must run in going on such a perilous journey. They would have
to go hundreds of miles through the disease-stricken land where hundreds
had died. But it seemed essential that something must be done, and there
were possibilities that the Indians, by acting very wisely, could escape
infection: so we decided to call them together, and see what they would
do in this emergency.</p>

<p>When the church bell was rung, and the people had assembled together
in their Council house, wondering what was the matter, I described the
sad circumstances to them, and then presented the request, that one
hundred and sixty of them should take twenty boats loaded with supplies,
and go up the Saskatchewan, to save these white people from starving. I
said to these converted Indians, my own people:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know your race on this continent has not always been fairly
treated; but never mind that. Here is a grand opportunity for you to do a
glorious act, and to show to the world and to the good Lord, Whose
children you are, that you can make sacrifices and run risks when duty
calls, as well as the whites can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We told them that there was a possibility that they, by keeping in the
middle of the great river all the time, and <i>never</i> going ashore,
might all escape. They would be provided with abundance of food; so they
need not go ashore to hunt. Then we asked, &ldquo;Are you willing to run
the risk, and avail yourselves of this chance to do a glorious
act?&rdquo; Turning to one of the most trusted guides in the country, one
of my best Class-Leaders, I said: &ldquo;Samuel Papanekis, you are to be
the guide and leader of this party.&rdquo; He was a son of the old
centenarian, and brother of the Rev. Edward Papanekis, now our Missionary
at Oxford House Mission.</p>

<p>He seemed at first a little startled by the responsibility of the
position, and after a moment's thought quietly said: &ldquo;Will you give
us a little time to talk it over?&rdquo; So we left them to discuss the
matter among themselves. When they sent us word that they had their
answer ready, we returned, and he said: &ldquo;Missionary, we have talked
it over, and have decided to go to take the supplies to our suffering
white brothers and their families. But will you let us have one more
Sunday at the church, and will you give us the Sacrament of the Lord's
Supper, ere we start upon the dangerous journey?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;it will take several days to get
your loads and boats ready, and so we will have another blessed day of
rest and hallowed worship together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a memorable Sabbath. Every man, woman, and child who could come
to church, seemed to be there. Some of the women wept as they thought of
the risks their husbands, or brothers, or sons were running. Others of
them seemed to catch the spirit of the men, and felt proud that those
they loved were willing to undertake so brave and noble a work.</p>

<p>At the close of the morning service we had the Sacrament of the Lord's
Supper. It was very solemn and impressive. As they came forward and
partook of the emblems of their dear Lord's dying love, the recollection
of His self-sacrifice and disinterested kindness seemed to come very
vividly before us all, and there was in many hearts a kind of exultant
joy that they were counted worthy to run some risks for the sake of doing
good.</p>

<p>No foolish boastfulness, or desire to seek for sympathy, characterised
their utterances at the afternoon service, at which we met again in a
Testimony or Fellowship Meeting. Some made no reference at all to the
work before them; others asked for our prayers for them; and others, well
taught in the Word of God, with the hallowed influences of the morning
sacramental service still resting upon them, thought that they ought to
rejoice when there were chances for getting into this spirit, so as to be
partakers of Christ's sufferings, or companions in tribulation with such
a Friend, so that when His glory should be revealed, they also might
rejoice, as He has taught us: &ldquo;If we suffer with Him,&rdquo; we
shall &ldquo;also be glorified together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two or three days after this they started on their long, dangerous
journey. They had twenty beats well loaded with supplies, each manned by
eight Indians, and all under the guidance of Samuel Papanekis, whom they
were expected to implicitly. obey. They went up the fine river that
passes by Norway House, until they entered into Lake Winnipeg. From this
place they skirted around the north-western shore of this great lake,
until they reached the mouth of the Saskatchewan River. Up this great
river they had to row their beats against the current for many hundreds
of miles. That summer was an exceedingly hot one, yet for weeks together
these gallant fellows tugged away at their heavy oars. For a few short
hours of rest during the night they anchored their boats in mid-stream,
and then at first blush of morning they continued their journey. Wild
beasts were sometimes seen walking on the shores or quenching their
thirst in the river. The hunting instincts of the younger Indian boatmen
were so strong that they begged to be allowed to fire; but Samuel, ever
on the alert, and seeing the danger, always positively refused.</p>

<p>When the Sabbaths came they anchored their boats as close together as
possible near the middle of the river on some shoal or shallow spot, such
as abound in this great river of shifting sand bars. Here they spent
their quiet, restful days, having prayers and a couple of religious
services each Sunday.</p>

<p>Ere they reached the place where they were to deliver their precious
cargoes, the river passed through many miles of the plague-stricken
country. They could see on the shores the deserted wigwams, in which all
the inmates had fallen victims to the fell destroyer, or had,
panic-stricken, fled away.</p>

<p>Very long seemed that summer, and great indeed was our solicitude, and
many were our prayers for these noble men, from whom we did not hear a
single word during the whole time of their absence. After being away for
about ten weeks, they came back amidst a doxology of thanksgiving and
gratitude. All of them were happy and in vigorous health, with the
exception of the guide. The strain and anxiety upon him had been too
much, and he was never the same man after. The others said, &ldquo;Samuel
seemed to be everywhere, and to watch every movement with almost
sleepless vigilance.&rdquo; Realising how great the responsibilities were
upon him, he determined, if untiring devotion to his work would enable
him to rescue those suffering whites, and then return with his large
brigade uncontaminated by the disease, it should be done.</p>

<p>He succeeded, but at the price of his own life, for he only came home
to linger a while and then to die. His indomitable will-power kept him up
until he saw the last boat safely moored in our quiet harbour, and
witnessed the loving greetings between his stalwart crews and their happy
families. He joined with us all in the blessed thanksgiving service in
our overflowing sanctuary, where with glad hearts we sang together:</p>

<blockquote><br>
         &ldquo;And are we yet alive,<br>
         And see each other's face?<br>
 Glory and praise to Jesus give<br>
         For His redeeming grace:<br>
         Preserved by power Divine<br>
         To full salvation here,<br>
 Again in Jesu's praise we join,<br>
         And in His sight appear.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
</blockquote>

<p>Then he began to droop and wither, and in spite of all that we, or the
kind Hudson's Bay officials, who were very much attached to him, could do
for him, he seemed almost visibly to slip away from us.</p>

<p>By-and-by the end drew near. It was a beautiful day, and as he had
some difficulty in breathing, at his own request a wigwam was prepared,
and he was well wrapped up and gently lifted out of his house and placed
upon a bed of balsam boughs covered with robes. He seemed grateful for
the change, and appeared a little easier for a time. We talked of Jesus,
and heaven, and &ldquo;the abundant entrance,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the
exceeding great and precious promises.&rdquo; Then he dropped off in a
quiet slumber. Soon after, he awoke with a consciousness that the time of
his departure had come, and laid himself out to die. Bending over him, I
said, &ldquo;Samuel, this is death that has come for you I Tell me how it
is with you.&rdquo; his hearing had partly left him, and so he did not
understand me. Speaking more loudly I said, &ldquo;Samuel, my brother,
you are in the Valley of the Shadow of Death; how is it with
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>His eye brightened, and his look told me he had understood my
question. He lifted up his thin, emaciated arm, and, seeming to clasp
hold of something, he said, &ldquo;Missionary, I am holding on to God; He
is my all of joy and hope and happiness.&rdquo; Then the arm fell
nerveless, and my triumphant Indian brother was in the Better Land.</p>

<p>Perhaps I cannot find a better place than here to refer to Samuel's
widow and children, and an interview I had with them.</p>

<p>They moved away, shortly after his death, from his house in the
Mission village, and took up their abode with several other families up
the river beyond the Fort, several miles from the village. We had visited
them and substantially aided them up to the time of their moving away,
but for a while I had not met them, except at the services, and so did
not know how they were prospering. When the cold winter set in, I
arranged with my good Brother Semmens that we would take our dog-trains
and go and make pastoral visits among all the Indian families on the
outskirts, and find out how they were prospering, temporally and
spiritually. It was ever a great joy to them when we visited them, and by
our inquiries about their fishing and hunting, and other simple affairs,
showed we were interested in these things, and rejoiced with them when
they could tell of success, and sympathised with them when they had met
with loss or disaster. Then they listened reverently when we read from
the blessed Word, and prayed with them in their humble homes.</p>

<p>One bitterly cold day towards evening we drove up to a very poor
little house. We knocked at the door, and in answer to a cheery
&ldquo;Astum,&rdquo; &mdash; the Indian for &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo;
&mdash; we entered the little abode. Our hearts sank within us at the
evidences of the poverty of the inmates. The little building was made of
poplar logs, the interstices of which were filled up with moss and clay.
The floor was of the native earth, and there was not a piece of furniture
in the abode, not a table, chair, or bedstead. In one corner of the room
was an earthen fireplace, and, huddled around a poor fire in it, there
sat a widow with a large family of children, one of whom was a
cripple.</p>

<p>We said a few words of kindly greeting to the family, and then,
looking round on the destitute home, I said sorrowfully, &ldquo;Nancy,
you seem to be very poor; you don't seem to have anything to make you
happy and comfortable.&rdquo; Very quickly came the response, &mdash; and
it was in a very much more cheery strain than my words had
been,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not got much, but I am not unhappy,
Missionary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You poor creature,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;you don't seem to
have anything to make you comfortable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have but little,&rdquo; she said quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you any venison?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you any flour?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you any tea?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you any potatoes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>When this last question of mine was uttered, the poor woman looked up
at me, for she was the widow of Samuel Papanekis, and this was her
answer: &ldquo;I have no potatoes, for, don't you remember, at the time
of potato planting Samuel took charge of the brigade that went up with
provisions to save the poor white people? And Samuel is not here to shoot
deer, that I may have venison; and Samuel is not here to catch mink and
marten and beaver and other things to exchange for flour and
tea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have you got, poor woman?&rdquo; I said with my heart full
of sorrow.</p>

<p>She replied, &ldquo;I have got a couple of fish-nets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you do when it was too stormy to visit the
nets?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes some of the men from the other houses visited them
for me, and would bring me the fish. Then we sometimes get some by
fishing through the ice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about when it was too stormy for any one to go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She quietly said, &ldquo;If nothing were left, we go without
anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As I looked at her and her large family of fatherless children, and
then thought of her husband's triumphant death, and his glorious transfer
to that blest abode, where &ldquo;they shall hunger no more, neither
thirst any more,&rdquo; and where &ldquo;God shall wipe away all tears
from their eyes,&rdquo; the contrast between the husband and father in
his felicity, and the sorrow of the widow and children in their poverty,
so affected me that, to hide my emotion and keep back my tears, I hurried
out of the room, following my loving Brother Semmens, who was, if
possible, more deeply moved than I was. We had gone into that house to
pray, but we could not. There must be tangible sympathy given ere we
could look to a higher source.</p>

<p>My brother had reached the cariole, which was a few yards away, and I
was not far behind, when the word, &ldquo;Ayumeaookemou,&rdquo;
(&ldquo;Praying master,&rdquo;) arrested my hurrying steps. I turned
back, and there, just outside of the door, was Nancy. With a woman's
quick intuition to read the feelings of the heart from the face and
voice, she had followed me out, and her words, as nearly as I can recall
them, were these:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Missionary, I do not want you to feel so badly for me; it is
true I am very poor; it is true, since Samuel died, we have often been
hungry and have often suffered from the bitter cold; but,
Missionary,&rdquo; and her face had no trace of sorrow upon it,
&ldquo;you have heard me say that as Samuel gave his heart to God, so
have I given God my heart, and He Who comforted Samuel and helped him, so
that he died so happily, is my Saviour; and where Samuel has gone,
by-and-by I am going too; and that thought makes me happy all the day
long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There came a blessed exultation into my soul, but I could find no
answer then. So I hurried on and joined my weeping brother, and shouting,
&ldquo;Marchez!&rdquo; to our dogs, we were soon rapidly speeding over
the icy trail to our Mission home.</p>

<p>That night our bed was a blanket thinner, and on our limited supplies
there was a heavy drain. I told the Indians who were better off about her
straitened condition, and she and hers were made more comfortable. Many
of them gave very generously indeed to help her. The grace of liberality
abounds largely among these poor Christian Indians, and they will give to
the necessities of those who are poorer than themselves until it seems at
times as though they had about reached the same level.</p>

<p>The triumphant death of Samuel, and then Nancy's brave words, very
much encouraged us in our work. We could not but more than rejoice at the
Gospel's power, still so consciously manifested to save in the Valley of
the Shadow of Death, and also to make a humble log-cabin a little heaven
below. We pitied her in her poverty, and yet soon after, when we had
thought it all over in the light of eternity, we could only rejoice with
her, and in our spirits say, &ldquo;Happy woman! Better live in a log hut
without a chair or table or bedstead, without flour or tea or potatoes,
entirely dependent upon the nets in the lake for food, if the Lord Jesus
is a constant Guest, than in a mansion of a millionaire, surrounded by
every luxury, but destitute of His presence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is a matter of great thankfulness that not only spiritually but
temporally thousands of the Indians in different parts of Canada are
improving grandly. The accompanying picture (p. 209) is from a photograph
taken at the Scugog Lake Indian Mission. The fine barn, well filled with
wheat, as well as all the surrounding vehicles and agricultural
implements, belong to one of the Christian Indians.</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_17">Chapter Sixteen. A race for life in a
blizzard storm &mdash; Saved by the marvellous intelligence of Jack
&mdash; &ldquo;Where is the old man, whose head was like the
snow-drift?&rdquo;</a></h3>

<p>Blizzard storms sometimes assailed us, as on the long winter trails,
with our gallant dogs and faithful companions, we wandered over those
regions of magnificent distances.</p>

<p>To persons who have not actually made the acquaintance of the blizzard
storms of the North-Western Territories, or Wild North Land, it is almost
impossible to give a satisfactory description. One peculiarity about
them, causing them to differ from other storms, is that the wind seems to
be ever coming in little whirls or eddies, which keep the air full of
snow, and make it almost impossible to tell the direction from which the
wind really comes. With it apparently striking you in the face, you turn
your back to it, and are amazed at finding that it still faces you. Once,
when on Lake Winnipeg, we saw one coming down upon us. Its appearance was
that of a dense fog blowing in from the sea. Very few indeed are they who
can steer their course correctly in a blizzard storm. Most people, when
so unfortunate as to be caught in one, soon get bewildered, and almost
blinded by the fine, dry, hard particles of snow which so pitilessly beat
upon them, filling eyes, nose, and even ears and mouth, if at all
exposed.</p>

<p>Once, when crossing Lake Winnipeg, to visit some wild Indians, whom we
found on our arrival in the midst of the hideous ceremonies of a dog
feast, I got caught in a terrible storm. My men had gone on ahead with
all the dogs, to have dinner ready in the camp on the distant shore,
leaving me miles behind, tramping along on snow-shoes. Down from the
north, with terrific fury, came the gale. I tramped on as rapidly as
possible, until I got bewildered. Then I took off one of my snow-shoes,
and, fastening it in a hole cut in the ice, I got ready to tramp in a
small circle around it to keep from freezing to death, when fortunately I
heard the welcome whooping of my Indians, who, seeing my danger, had
quickly turned round, and risking their own lives for mine, for they
could have reached the woods and shelter, aided by the dogs, had
fortunately reached me. There we stopped for hours, until the blizzard
had spent its fury, and then on we went.</p>

<p>I had a remarkable experience in a blizzard, which I will more fully
describe, as our escape was under Providence so much indebted to my
wonderful dog Jack.</p>

<p>I had started on one of my long winter trips to visit the few little
bands of Indians who were struggling for an existence on the Eastern
coast of Lake Winnipeg, and who were always glad to welcome the
Missionary, and to hear from him of the love of the Great Spirit, and of
His Son Jesus Christ. Their country is very wild and rough, very
different from the beautiful prairie regions of the North-West. To keep
down expenses, which in those Northern Missions are very heavy, I had
started out on this long trip with only this young Indian lad as my
companion. But as he was good and true, I thought we could succeed, since
I had been several years in the country, and had faced many a wintry
storm, and slept many nights in the snow.</p>

<p>We had with us two splendid trains of dogs. My leader was a lively,
cunning Esquimaux dog, as white as snow. His name was Koona, which is the
Indian word for &ldquo;snow&rdquo;; and he was well named. The other
three dogs of my train were my favourites from Ontario. Two of them were
gifts from Senator Sanford, of hamilton; the other was kindly sent to me
by Dr. Mark, of Ottawa. The other train, driven by Alec, was composed of
some sagacious St. Bernards obtained for me by the kindness of Mr
Ferrier, of Montreal. The largest and most enduring of the eight was Jack
from Hamilton, whose place was second in my train, and who is to be the
hero of this adventure.</p>

<p>We had left our camp-fire in the woods early in the morning, and,
turning our faces towards the north, had hoped that ere the shadows of
night had fallen around us, at least sixty miles of the frozen surface of
Lake Winnipeg would have been travelled over. For a time we were able to
push on very rapidly, keeping the distant points of headlands well in
view for our guidance. Lake Winnipeg is very much indented with bays, and
in travelling we do not follow the coast line, but strike directly across
these bays from point to point. Some of them run back for many miles into
the land, and several of them are from ten to thirty miles wide. The dogs
get so accustomed to these long trips and to their work, that they
require no guide to run on ahead, but will, with wonderful intelligence,
push on from point to point with great exactness.</p>

<p>On and on we had travelled for hours; the cold was very great, but we
could easily jump off from our dog-sleds and run until we felt the glow
and warmth of such vigorous exercise. After a while, we noticed that the
strong wind which had arisen was filling the air with fine dry snow, and
making travelling very difficult and unpleasant. Soon it increased to a
gale, and we found ourselves in a real North-West blizzard on stormy Lake
Winnipeg, many miles from shore.</p>

<p>Perhaps our wisest plan would have been, at the commencement of the
storm, to have turned sharply to the east, and got into the shelter of
the forest as quickly as possible. But the bay we were crossing was a
very deep one, and the headland before us seemed as near as the other end
of the bay; and so we thought it best to run the risk and push on. That
we might not get separated from each other, I fastened what we call the
tail rope of my sled to the collar of the head dog of Alec's train.</p>

<p>After Alec and I had travelled on for several hours, no sign of any
land appearing, we began to think that the fickle blizzard was playing us
one of its tricks, and that we had wandered far out into the lake. We
stopped our dogs out there in the blinding, bewildering storm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alec!&rdquo; I shouted, &ldquo;I am afraid we are
lost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Missionary,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;we are surely
lost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We talked about our position, and both had to confess that we did not
really know where we were or which way we ought to go.</p>

<p>The result of our deliberation was that we could do no better than
trust in the good Providence above us, and in our dogs before us.</p>

<p>As it was now after midday, and the vigorous exercise of the last few
hours had made us very hungry, we opened our provision bag, and, taking
out some frozen food, made a fairly good attempt to satisfy the keen
demands of appetite. We missed very much the good cup of hot black tea we
should have had if we had been fortunate enough to reach the shore, and
find some wood with which to make a fire.</p>

<p>After our hasty meal we held a short consultation, in which the fact
became more and more evident to us, that our position was a very perilous
one, as we were becoming blinded by the driving particles of fine snow
that stung our eyeballs and added much to our bewilderment. We found that
we did not know east from west, or north from south, and would have to
leave the dogs to decide on their own course, and let them go in any
direction they pleased.</p>

<p>I had a good deal of confidence in my dogs, as I had proved their
sagacity. To Jack, the noblest of them all, I looked to lead us out of
our difficulty; and he did not disappoint our expectations. I suppose I
acted and talked to my dog in a way that some folks would have considered
very foolish. When travelling regularly, the dogs are only fed once a
day, and that when the day's work is done. However, it was different that
day, as in the blinding gale Alec and I tried to eat our dinner. As Jack
and the others crowded around us, they were not neglected, and with them
we shared the food we had, as there was a great uncertainty whether
another meal would ever be required by any one of us.</p>

<p>As usual in such emergencies, Jack had come up close to me, and so,
while he and Alec and I, and the rest of us, men and dogs, were eating
our dinners, I had a talk with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jack, my noble fellow,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;do you know that
we are lost, and that it is very doubtful whether we shall ever see the
Mission House again? The prospect is that the snow will soon be our
winding sheet, and that loving eyes will look in vain for our return. The
chances are against your ever having the opportunity of stretching
yourself out on the wolf rug before the study fire. Rouse up yourself,
old dog, for in your intelligence we are going to trust to lead us to a
place of safety.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The few arrangements necessary for the race were soon made. Alec
wrapped himself up as comfortably as possible in his rabbit-skin robe,
and I helped him to ensconce himself securely on his dog-sled. I tied a
rope from the end of my sled to the collar of his leader dog, so that our
trains might not get separated. Then I straightened out the trains, and,
wrapping myself up as well as I could on my sled, I shouted
&ldquo;Marchez!&rdquo; to the dogs.</p>

<p>I had as leader dog the intelligent white Esquimaux,
&ldquo;Koona.&rdquo; As I shouted the word for &ldquo;Go,&rdquo; Koona
turned his head and looked at me, as though bewildered, and seemed to be
waiting for &ldquo;Chaw&rdquo; or &ldquo;Yee,&rdquo; the words for
&ldquo;right&rdquo; and &ldquo;left.&rdquo; As I did not know myself, I
shouted to Jack, who was second in the train, &ldquo;Go on, Jack,
whichever way you like, and do the best you can, for I do not know
anything about it.&rdquo; As Koona still hesitated, Jack, with all the
confidence imaginable, dashed off in a certain direction, and Koona with
slackened traces ran beside him, very willing in such an emergency to
give him all the honour of leadership.</p>

<p>For hours the dogs kept bravely to their work. The storm raged and
howled around us, but not for one moment did Jack hesitate or seem to be
at fault. Koona had nothing to do but run beside him; but the other two
splendid dogs in the traces behind Jack seemed to catch his spirit, and
nobly aided him by their untiring efforts and courage. The cold was so
intense that I had grave fears that we should freeze to death. We were
obliged so to wrap ourselves up that it was impossible with so much on us
to run with any comfort, or to keep up with the dogs whilst going at such
a rapid rate. Frequently would I shout back to my comrade, &ldquo;Alec!
don't go to sleep. Alec, if you do, you may never wake up until the
Judgment morning.&rdquo; Back would come his response, &ldquo;All right,
sir; then I'll try to keep awake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus on we travelled through that wintry storm. How cold, how
relentless, how bitter were the continuous blasts of the north wind!
After a while the shadows of night fell upon us, and we were enshrouded
in the darkness. Not a pleasant position was that in which we were
situated; but there was no help for it, nor any use in giving way to
despondency or despair. A sweet peace filled my soul, and in a blessed
restfulness of spirit my heart was kept stayed upon God. While there is
life there is hope; and so, with an occasional shout of warning to Alec
to keep awake, and a cheering call to the dogs, who required no special
urging, so gallantly were they doing their work, we patiently hung on to
our sleds and awaited the result. We were now in the gloom of night,
dashing along I knew not where, and not even able at times to see the
dogs before us.</p>

<p>About three hours after dark the dogs quickened their pace into a
gallop, and showed by their excitement that they had detected evidences
of nearness to the shore and safety, of which as yet I knew nothing. Soon
after they dragged us over a large pile of broken ice and snow, the
accumulations of ice cut out of the holes in the lake, where the Indian
families had for months obtained their supply of water for cooking and
other purposes. Turning sharply on the trail towards the shore, our dogs
dashed along for a couple of hundred yards more; then they dragged us up
a steep bank into the forest, and, after a few minutes more of rapid
travelling, we found ourselves in the midst of a little collection of
wigwams, and among a band of friendly Indians, who gave us a cordial
welcome, and rejoiced with us at our escape from the storm, which was the
severest of the year.</p>

<p>We had three days of religious services with them, and then went on
our way from encampment to encampment. Very glad were the poor people to
see us, and with avidity did they receive the word preached.</p>

<p>I felt that it was very slow work. My Circuit or Mission-field was
larger than all England. I was the only Missionary of any Church in this
large field. By canoe or dog-train I could only get around to all my
appointments or out-stations twice a year. Six months the poor souls had
to wait for the messenger and the message.</p>

<p>At one of these Indian encampments on one of these visits I had the
following sad experience. Before I closed the first service I asked,
&ldquo;Where is the old man whose head was like the snow-drift?&rdquo;
for I had missed a white-haired old man, who had ever been at all the
services, and had from the time of his conversion manifested the greatest
anxiety to hear and learn all he could about this great salvation. At
first he had opposed me, and was annoyed at my coming among his people.
Ultimately, however, he became convinced of the error of his ways, and
was an earnest, decided Christian. When I arrived at his village, whether
by canoe in summer, or dog-train in winter, I was always received by this
venerable old man with great delight. Not satisfied with attending all
the services held, and being at hand whenever I taught the Syllabic
Characters, that the Indians might be able to read the blessed Word, he
used to follow me like my shadow, and listen very attentively to all I
had to say. It was rather startling, indeed, when one night, after a hard
day of preaching and teaching and counselling, I kneeled down to pray,
ere I wrapped myself up in my camp-bed to get a little rest, to hear
whispered in quiet tones beside me, &ldquo;Missionary, pray in Indian,
and so loud that I can hear you.&rdquo; In the morning he was there
again, and as I bowed to say my quiet morning prayers there came into my
ears from this old man the pleading words again, &ldquo;Missionary,
please pray in Indian, and pray out loud, so that I may hear what you
say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Is it any wonder that I became very much attached to my old friend
with the snow-white hair, who was so hungering and thirsting for the
teachings of the Word? Only twice a year could I then visit him and his
people. I used to remain a few days at each of these visits, and very
busy ones indeed they were. For six months these poor sheep in the
wilderness had been without the Gospel, and as soon as I left they would
have to get along as well as they could on what they had heard. Now that
they had, under the good Spirit's influence, a longing desire to receive
the truth, can any one wonder at their anxiety to learn all they could
from the Missionary during his short stay among them? This intense desire
on their part filled my heart with thankfulness, and amply compensated
for all the sufferings and hardships of the long, cold, dangerous
journeys.</p>

<p>On my arrival at this place, as usual, the Indians had crowded around
to welcome me. I was disappointed at not seeing my old friend. So it was
that at our first meeting, held as soon as possible after my arrival, I
asked the question, &ldquo;Where is the old man whose head was like the
snow-drift?&rdquo;</p>

<p>To my question there was no response, but every head was bowed as in
grief and sorrow.</p>

<p>Again I asked: &ldquo;Tell me, what have you done with the old man
with the snow-white hair?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then there was a little whispering among them, and one of them,
speaking out softly, said in the Cree language, &ldquo;Non
pimmatissit;&rdquo; the English of which is, &ldquo;He is not among the
living.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The poor Indians, who have not as yet come to understand that death is
a conquered foe, never like to use the word; and so, when speaking of
those who have gone, they say they are &ldquo;not among the
living.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When in this expressive way I learned that my old friend was dead, my
heart was filled with sorrow, as I saw also were theirs. After a little
pause I said, &ldquo;Tell me how he died.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At first there was a great deal of reluctance to answer this question;
but when they saw I was not only anxious but resolved to know all about
it, they took me into a wigwam where most of his relatives were, and
there a young man, a grandson, got up and told me this pathetic
story.</p>

<p>He said: &ldquo;Missionary, you had not been long gone with your canoe
last summer before Mismis&rdquo; (the Indian word for
&ldquo;grandfather") &ldquo;got very sick, and after some weeks he seemed
to know that he was going to leave us. So he called us all around him,
and said a great many things to us. I cannot remember them all, as he
spoke many times; but I do remember that he said, 'how I wish the
Missionary would soon come again to talk to me and comfort me! But he is
far away, and my memory is bad, and I have forgotten what he used to say
to me. My body is breaking up, and so also is my memory getting bad. Tell
him his coming was like the sunlight on the waters; but it was so seldom
that he came that all in my mind has got so dark, and my memory is so
bad, that I have forgotten all he used to say to me. The good things he
used to tell us about the Good Spirit and His Son, and what we ought to
do, have slipped away from me. O that he were here to help me! Tell him,
as long as I was able; I used to go up to the point of land that runs out
into the lake, and watch if I could see his canoe returning. But it came
not. Tell him I have, since the winter set in, listened for the sound of
the bells on his dog-trains. But I have not heard them. O that he were
here to help me! He is far away; so get me my old drum and medicine bag,
and let me die as did my fathers. But you, young people, with good
memories, who can remember all the Missionary has said to you, listen to
his words, and worship the Great Spirit and His Son, as he tells you, and
do not do as I am doing!'</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, as we saw his mind was weak, or he would not have asked
for his old things, we got him the old drum, and put it before him where
he was sitting upon the ground. We also hung up a medicine bag before him
in the wigwam, and he drummed. As he drummed he fell, and as he fell he
died. But his last words were to the young people with good memories to
be sure and listen to the Missionary, and to give up all their old Indian
sinful paganism.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the young man ceased and sat down again, a deep silence fell upon
us all, as there we were huddled that cold, stormy day in that little
bark tent. An occasional sob from some sorrowing relative was the only
sound heard for several minutes.</p>

<p>My own heart was deeply affected when they told me these and other
things, which I cannot now call up, about the old Indian's death. After a
while I broke the silence by saying, &ldquo;Where have you buried
him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They showed me the place. It was where his wigwam had stood. So
terrible is the power of the Frost King in that land in winter, that to
dig a grave out in the open places is like cutting through a granite
rock. And so in his tent, where burned his fire, thus keeping the ground
unfrozen, there they dug his grave and buried him. The wigwam was
removed, and soon the fierce storms swept over the place, and the snow
fell deeply upon it, and there was nothing to indicate that there, so
shortly before, had been a human habitation.</p>

<p>When they had pointed out the place where, underneath the snow-drift,
rested all that was mortal of my old friend, I lingered until the Indians
had sought the shelter of their wigwams from the bitter cold, and then
all alone, except with Him Who hears His people's cry, I knelt down in
the snow and prayed, or tried to pray. But I could only weep out my
sorrow as I thought of this old man's precious soul passing into eternity
under such strange circumstances. With his waning strength he exhorted
his loved ones to be Christians, and yet he himself was performing some
of the foolish and unmeaning rites of paganism, not because he had much
faith in them, but because there was no Missionary or teacher to keep in
his memory the story of Jesus and His wondrous love!</p>

<p>Never before did the wants and woes of the weary, waiting, wailing
millions of earth's perishing ones rise up so vividly as I knelt there in
the snow. Before me, through my blinding tears, I seemed to see them pass
in dense array, &mdash; a dark world, to be illumined; an enslaved world,
to be set free; a sinful world, to be made holy; a redeemed world, to be
saved.</p>

<p>In a spirit that perhaps savoured too much of unbelief I cried out,
&ldquo;How long, O Lord, how long? Why do Thy chariot wheels
delay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Saving me from further gloom, came some of the sweet promises of the
Word: and so I prayed for their speedy fulfilment. Earnestly did my
feeble petitions ascend, that the time would soon come when not only all
the poor Indians of the great North-West, but also all the unnumbered
millions of earth's inhabitants who are going down from the darkness of
paganism and superstition to the darkness of the grave, might soon have
faithful teachers to whisper in their ears the story of the Cross, and
point them to the world's Redeemer.</p>

<p>Making all the visits we had arranged for that trip, we returned home.
Months after, when the packet arrived from Manitoba, the sad news, that
had so filled the Church with sorrow, of the death of the heroic George
McDougall reached us. Out on the wild prairies he had been caught in a
blizzard storm. Horse and man seem to have become bewildered, and there
the noble Missionary to the Indians on the great plains laid himself down
to die, and his frozen body was not found until after fourteen days of
diligent search. After my dear wife and I had read the story, and talked
and wept about his death, so sad, so mysterious, so inscrutable, she said
to me, &ldquo;Where were you during that week?&rdquo; The journal was
searched, and we were not a little startled at finding that the race for
life we have in this chapter described was in all probability on the same
day as that on which the Rev. George McDougall perished.</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_18">Chapter Seventeen. Work outside the
pulpit &mdash; Polygamy and its evils &mdash; Family re-arrangements
&mdash; Dangerous work at times &mdash; Practical pastoral duties &mdash;
A fish sermon &mdash; Five men won to Christ.</a></h3>

<p>While the blessed work of preaching &ldquo;the glorious Gospel of the
Son of God&rdquo; was ever recognised as the most important of our
duties, and we were permitted to rejoice that, as in Paul's time, still
&ldquo;it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that
believe,&rdquo; yet there was a great deal to be done outside of the
pulpit ere these Indians could shake off the fetters of a degrading
paganism with its attendant evils.</p>

<p>The slavish fear of the old conjurers deterred some from openly
avowing themselves as willing to accept the truths of Christianity.
Others were polygamists, and were unwilling to comply with the Scriptural
requirements. To have several wives is considered a great honour in some
of the tribes. For a man to separate from all but one is to expose
himself to ridicule from his pagan friends, and also to the danger of
incurring the hostility of the relations of the discarded wives. Some of
the most perplexing and trying duties of my missionary life have been in
connection with this matter of re-organising, on a Christian basis, the
families of once heathen polygamists, who, desirous to do what was right,
have left the matter entirely in my hands. At first my convictions and
views were that the first wife should always be the one to remain with
the man, and the others should go away. Like all the other Missionaries
in the country, I had to modify these ideas, and decide differently in
some peculiar cases.</p>

<p>For example, a man came to me who was much impressed by the truth, and
desired to be a Christian. I questioned him closely, and found him very
sincere and earnest in his resolves. The Spirit was undoubtedly working
in his heart and conscience. He told us he had two wives, but was willing
to put one away. Which one should go, he said he would leave to the
Missionary to decide. His first wife was much the older woman, but she
had no children, while the younger wife had quite a family of little ones
around her. So poor are they in this cold northern land that it is hard
for the best of them at times to get along. Very sad is the condition of
the widow, or those women who have no able-bodied men as husbands,
fathers, or sons, to hunt and work for them. Worse still is it if they
have helpless little children to be cared for. So the decision we came to
was, that the wife with the family of little ones should remain with the
man, and the one who had no children should leave him.</p>

<p>We tried to arrange that a certain quantity of help should be rendered
to the wife, or wives, put away by the husband. But we found that there
was a certain amount of danger in this, the nature of which will be
evident to the reader; and so, while we insisted on the one or more who
left receiving as large a share as possible of the man's &ldquo;worldly
goods,&rdquo; we endeavoured to make the separation complete and final.
To help those who for conscience sake thus acted was often a very heavy
tax upon our limited means.</p>

<p>Often the women themselves were the first to insist on a change from
the old polygamous style, which, they were quick to see very soon after
the Gospel was proclaimed to them, was antagonistic to its teachings.</p>

<p>There was one most thrilling case that moved our hearts, and yet
caused us to rejoice, for it showed us the depth of the religious
convictions which impelled them to have the matter set right, even though
one must be cast out and exposed to the ridicule of her heathen friends,
and to the loss of a fairly good-natured husband, considering his pagan
surroundings.</p>

<p>Two women came to our Mission House, and asked to have a talk with my
good wife and myself. After talking about different things, at length
they told us, with much trepidation, that they had attended our services,
and had a great desire in their hearts to become Christians. We found
they were the two wives of an Indian whose wigwam had been pitched in our
vicinity a few weeks before. These women and others had quietly come to
our services at the church, and their hearts and consciences had been
touched by the truth.</p>

<p>We had had some experiences on these lines, and so with entire
strangers we had learned to be a little cautious. In that country, as
well as in civilised lands, it is sometimes a dangerous matter to
interfere in the domestic affairs of other people. So we questioned them
closely, and found that they were resolved to have the matter settled. I
asked them if they had spoken to their husband about it, and they
answered in the affirmative; also that he had left it to them to settle
which should go, as he likewise had begun to think they ought to live as
the Christian Indians did. We asked them what they wanted us to do, and
they said that they had decided that they would leave the matter to the
Missionary and his wife, and whichever we thought ought to leave, would
go away, and try to get her own living.</p>

<p>They returned to their wigwam, and with the consent of their husband
made an equal division of the few things which constituted their
possessions, such as nets, traps, blankets, kettles, and axes. Then,
accompanied by their children, they came again to our house, and sat down
apart from each other, and patiently awaited our decision. My wife and I
deeply felt the responsibility of deciding; yet, as it had come to us
because of the awakening of their hearts to desire a better life, we
could not do otherwise than accept the situation, and do the best we
could.</p>

<p>We had talked the matter over, and had asked Divine guidance; and so
now, when summoned to give our decision, we quickly but kindly said to
the woman with five children, &ldquo;You are to stay with your
husband;&rdquo; and to the other woman, who had four children, we said,
&ldquo;You are not to return to the wigwam, but must be from this hour as
an entire stranger to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The first woman sprang up, her eyes flashing with joy, and gathering
her children and property around her she uttered her hasty words of
farewell, and was gone. For a few moments the other woman, who had drawn
her blanket over her head, remained perfectly still, with the exception
of a suppressed sob, which seemed to make the whole body quiver. Soon,
with that wonderful will-power which these Indian women, as well as the
men, possess, she appeared to have obtained the mastery over herself
again, and, uncovering her head, she began to make preparations for
leaving. As she turned her large black eyes dimmed with tears towards us,
while there was no malice in them, there was a despairing sorrow that
pierced us like a knife. She seemed to see the lonely, neglected,
contemned, suffering life before her; but she had counted the cost, and
had taken the step for conscience' sake, and she would not flinch now. We
entered into conversation with her, and it seemed almost cruel that we,
who had given a decision that had shut up against her the only home she
had, should begin to talk to her about where she would go and what she
would do.</p>

<p>She told us she did not know where to go or what to do. Her husband
had bought her from her father, but he was dead; and as her girlhood home
was far away, and she had not been there since her husband took her away,
she knew nothing about any of her relatives. But even if she did, and
could find some of them, it was very likely they would treat her with
contempt, and perhaps persecute her. So she had not the slightest idea as
to the future.</p>

<p>Need I write that our hearts were full of sorrow, and we saw that this
was a case which must have help, no matter how straitened might be our
financial circumstances!</p>

<p>We had but lately read the story of the little oil in the cruse, and
the handful of meal in the barrel; and so this woman and her children
must be helped. While Mrs Young fed them and talked kindly to them, I
went out and got some of my Christian Indians together, and we talked the
matter over, and then took off our coats and went to work, and made her a
wigwam for the present, as it was in the pleasant summer-time. A canoe
was obtained for her, and her nets were set where white fish could be
caught readily. She was an industrious woman, willing to do everything
she could; and so, with the help we gave her and the tangible sympathy
manifested by the Christian Indians, she took heart and got along very
well, and became a good Christian woman.</p>

<p>As the result of the looseness of the marriage tie in their old sinful
lives, we found many strange complicated tangles, some of which it was
impossible to straighten. To deal with some of them would have caused
endless difficulty, without any possibility of improving matters. To
refuse to interfere gave offence to some, who, I am afraid, were more
pharisaical than wise. Here, for example, was one case. A couple had been
married years ago. After living together for several years and having
three children, the man went off to Red River as a boatman for the
Hudson's Bay Company. Delayed there for a time, he married a wife in the
Indian settlement, and made that place his home, only returning with his
second family about the time I went there. His first wife, a year or two
after he left, not hearing from him, married another man, who supposed
she was a widow, and they had several bright, interesting children. As
the result of the faithful preaching of the Word, these families were
converted, and became good Christians. They felt keenly their position,
but, after pondering it over and listening to many solutions, I gave it
up; and as the two families were living happily, I left them as I had
found them. Paganism, not Christianity, was responsible for the
difficulty.</p>

<p>At Nelson River I was accosted one day by an old man, who said he had
listened carefully to what I had said, and wanted to become a Christian
and be baptized. I was very much pleased with his talk, but, suspecting
him to be a polygamist, I asked him as to the number of his wives. His
answer was that he had four. I had a long conversation with him as to our
views, and explained to him the teachings of God's Word, and candidly
told him that I could not baptize him until he put three of them
away.</p>

<p>He seemed grieved at my decision, and said that he did want to be a
Christian, but he and his wives were getting old, and they had got along
fairly well; and now if he went and told them what he would have to do,
he was afraid there would be trouble. As I saw the man was really in
earnest, and it was evident that the good Spirit was working upon his
heart, I encouraged him to make the effort, and I told him everything
would work out all right.</p>

<p>He went to his large tent, and, getting his large family around him,
&mdash; for three of these wives had stalwart sons, &mdash; he told them
of his desire to become a Christian, and what he would have to do before
the Missionary would consent to baptize him. At once there was a
&ldquo;row.&rdquo; The women began to wail, and the sons, who generally
treated their mothers with neglect and indifference, now declared, with a
good deal of emphasis, that their mothers should not be sent away, and
thus degraded in the eyes of the people. From what I afterwards learned,
there must have been a rough time.</p>

<p>At length one of the sons spoke up and said, &ldquo;Who is causing us
all this trouble?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The answer was, &ldquo;Why, it is the Missionary, whom we have all
heard, and who refuses to baptize our father unless he puts away all of
his wives but one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us go for that Missionary,&rdquo; said several of them, and
seizing their arms, they came for me.</p>

<p>Fortunately for me I was outside of the trading post on the green, and
saw them coming, and, not liking their suspicious movements, and
imagining the cause, I speedily decided on my course of action. Calling
one of my reliable Christian Indians, I went quickly towards them, and,
ignoring their angry looks, I began talking to them as though we were the
best of friends. Something like the following were my words to
them:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Men, you have heard me talk to you out of the great Book. You
have listened attentively. You are thinking about what I have said to
you. I wish we could do something, or find out some way, by which you and
your mothers and father could all resolve together to give up the old bad
life, and accept the new one, and become Christians together. I have been
thinking it over since I had a little talk with your father, and I have a
plan that I think will work well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While I went on in this way, they listened attentively; and when I
came to mention a plan by which the difficulty could be overcome, the
wicked looks began to fade from their eyes, for they were not anxious to
kill me if any other solution of the difficulty could be found.</p>

<p>They were eager to know what I had to suggest, and listened very
attentively when I told them it would not be humiliating to any one. I
told them I was pleased to find some young men who were willing to stand
up for their mothers, while the great majority treated them worse than
they did their dogs. My suggestion was, that the sons of each mother
should form a wigwam of their own, and take their own mother with them
and care for her. They were good hunters and strong men, and could do
well. Then I added, &ldquo;Let your father remain with the wife who has
no children, no strong sons or daughters. Do this, and the Great Spirit
will be pleased, and when you are further instructed there will be
nothing to prevent you all being baptized and becoming Christians
together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were much pleased with the suggestion, and went away to talk it
over. I did not succeed in getting the scheme immediately carried out,
but my successor, the devoted and heroic Rev. John Semmens, was so
successful in following up the work thus begun, that these Indians, with
many scores of others, have become sincere, consistent Christians.</p>

<p>Various were the plans adopted by my zealous, devoted wife and myself
to help the people up to a better and happier life. In their old ways
there were but few efforts made by the women to keep their homes neat and
tidy, and their children or themselves clean. They had no encouragements
to do anything of the kind. Kicked and cuffed and despised, there was
left in them no ambition to do anything more than would save them from
the rough treatment of those who considered themselves their lords and
masters. The result was, when they became Christians, there was a great
deal to learn ere their simple little homes could be kept decently, and
in order. Fortunately, with a great many of them there was a desire to
learn. A novel plan that we adopted, as one among many that did much
good, was occasionally to go and dine with some of them. Our method was
something like this. On the Sabbath from the pulpit I would announce that
on Monday, if all was well, Mrs Young and I would dine with such a
family, mentioning the name. On Tuesday we would dine with some one else,
and on Wednesday with some other family, and so on for the week. This
was, of course, the first intimation any of these families had received
that, without waiting for an invitation, the Missionary and his wife were
coming to dine with them.</p>

<p>After service they waited to ask us if they could believe their own
ears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, certainly,&rdquo; I replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, we have nothing to set before you but fish,&rdquo; they
would say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind if you have but little; we will see to the food. All
we are anxious for you to do is to have your little house as clean as you
can possibly make it, and yourselves and children as clean and nice as
possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In this way we would talk to the half-frightened women, who were at
first really alarmed at the prospect of having to entertain us; however,
our words comforted them, and they went off delighted.</p>

<p>Our plan was generally as follows. I would start off after breakfast
and make several pastoral visits, or attend to some other matters, and so
arrange my forenoon work that I should be able to reach the Indian home,
where that day we had announced to dine, about noon. Mrs Young would have
her own train of dogs harnessed up about ten o'clock. In her cariole she
would put dishes, tablecloth, and provisions, with everything else
requisite for a comfortable dinner considering our limited circumstances.
A faithful young Indian acted as her dog-driver, and soon she and her
load were at the home of the expectant family, who were all excitement at
the coming of the Missionary and his wife.</p>

<p>Very clean and tidy looked the little house and family. The floor had
been scrubbed and rubbed until it could not be made whiter, and
everything else was similarly polished up. As but very few of the houses
had tables in those days, the floor was ever used as the substitute. On
it the tablecloth was spread, and the dishes and knives and forks were
arranged in order, and the dinner prepared. If the family had fish and
potatoes, some of them would be cooked; but if not, sufficient was always
taken in the cariole. We ever found it best to let them contribute to the
dinner if they had abundance of either fish or potatoes.</p>

<p>About the time I arrived dinner would be ready, and after cheering
words of greeting to all, even to the fat papoose in the board cradle, we
sat down, picnic style, on the floor to dinner. It would be called in
civilised lands a plain dinner, and so it was; yet it was a feast to
them, a banquet to us. Cheery conversation added to our enjoyment, and a
very happy hour was thus spent. Then the Bible and hymn-books were
brought out, and together we sang and read and talked about the blessed
truths of that glorious Book. Then together we kneeled down, and
&ldquo;by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving&rdquo; made our
requests known to God; and to us came the sweet fulfilment, &ldquo;the
peace of God, which passeth all understanding,&rdquo; filled our
hearts.</p>

<p>I generally hurried off to other duties. Mrs Young directed in the
washing of the dishes and in putting them away, and then helped the woman
of the house in some things about which she was longing for assistance.
Perhaps it was a dress to be cut out for herself, or some garments fitted
on some of the girls, or other similar things too intricate or difficult
for my obtuse mind to be able to grasp.</p>

<p>Thus from house to house we would go, and by our presence and cheery
words encourage them to become more industrious and tidy. Those families
never forgot these visits. With many of them there was a marked change in
their homes, and with many also there was a marked improvement in their
religious life.</p>

<p>Once, in preaching from the text, &ldquo;Behold, I stand at the door,
and knock: if any man hear My voice, and open the door, I will come
in,&rdquo; I tried to describe the blessed Redeemer coming to our hearts
and knocking for admittance. I told them, all He wanted was a welcome to
come in. As they made their little houses so clean, and gave the
Missionary and his wife such a welcome, so the Saviour asked us to drive
all sin out, and give Him all the place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some of you said, 'We cannot entertain the Missionary; we have
no food, so there will be no dinner.' But the Missionary and his wife
brought abundance, and there was a good dinner. Better far is it when
Jesus comes. He spreads out the feast, and He invites us to sit down and
feast with Him. O let Him in!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such talks as these, after practical illustrations, opened many hearts
to the Heavenly Guest.</p>

<p>So many and importunate had been the pleading calls for visits to
different places, to tell the wonderful story of the Great Spirit and his
Son, and to teach the people to read His Book, that one year my canoe
trip to Oxford House Mission had to be delayed until the summer was
nearly ended. But my comrades were splendid fellows, and we started off
in good spirits, anticipating a successful visit; and we were not
disappointed.</p>

<p>We preached several times to the Indians, and baptized a large number
of children; some young couples were married, and we had a solemn and
blessed time when celebrating the dying of the Lord Jesus. The Sacrament
of the Lord's Supper is very much prized by the Indians, and the greatest
reverence is always manifested during the service. The fellowship meeting
was a very good one, and some of the testimonies given by the men and
women, so happily rescued by the Gospel's power, were of great
interest.</p>

<p>When travelling, if the weather was good, we generally rose with the
first blush of morn, and so were often on the way by four o'clock.
Sometimes our route was across fine lakes, or along majestic rivers; and
then we were in narrow, sluggish streams, that were destitute of beauty
or interest. One morning our way was down a large river, on the shores of
which the fog had settled, completely hiding us from land. The early
morning air was invigorating, and so in unison we were plying our paddles
vigorously, and rapidly speeding along. We had seen no signs of human
beings for days, and so were surprised and startled when several reports
of firearms in quick succession sounded sharp and clear through the fog
on our right. Nothing was visible through the gloom, but we quickly hove
to, and turned our canoe in the direction from which the
<i>feu-de-joie</i> had sounded. As we approached the shore human forms
began to appear in ghostly outline, more and more distinct, until they
resolved themselves into a company of Indians, who were delighted to see
us, and had been on the look-out for days. They had come sixty miles from
the interior, and had camped on that point jutting out into the river,
for the purpose of having a visit from us as we passed.</p>

<p>The fact that they detected us as we were passing was another evidence
of the marvellous education, in certain lines, of these Indians. It was
very early in the morning; our canoe was some hundreds of yards from the
shore; a dense fog hid us completely from each other. All the noise we
made was the dip of our paddles in the water. Yet these wide-awake, alert
Indians heard that sound, and by the rapid firing of the guns drew us to
them.</p>

<p>We shared their hospitality, as they had abundance of game. We had
service with them, married a young couple, baptized several children, and
had a pleasant time. Then on we hurried, since the time of open
navigation was drawing to a close, and we did not wish to be caught in
the ice, and have to walk perhaps scores of miles with our bedding,
provisions, kettles, axes, and other things strapped on our backs.</p>

<p>We made the greater part of the return trip all right, had reached
Harry Lake early in the forenoon, and were rapidly paddling out of the
river which entered into it, when again we heard the report of guns. So
anxious were we to get on that we hesitated about stopping. It was now
later in the season than often in some other years. Fierce storms had
raged, and the ice had formed on the lake and rivers. We were dreading
these fierce fall storms, which come down very suddenly, and stir up
those northern lakes, so that in a very short time where all was calm and
still, great foam-crested waves go rushing madly by.</p>

<p>The lake before us, into which we had just entered and which was
several miles in diameter, was now as placid as a pond.</p>

<p>To cross it now, as in wondrous beauty it spread before us, would be
but a pleasure jaunt. The poetry of motion is to be found in the Indian's
birch canoe, when the water is calm and the sky is clear. Cold-hearted
prudence said, &ldquo;Go on, and never mind those Indians' signals for
you to land.&rdquo; Our better natures said, &ldquo;They may be in need,
and have good reason for asking you to stop. Perhaps you can do them
good.&rdquo; So we turned the head of our canoe to the shore, and were
soon alongside the rock on which we saw them standing. They were five
hunters. Without getting out of the canoe, we asked why they had
signalled to us to come ashore. Their answer was one we had often heard
before. They were hungry, and wanted help. Finding they had only been a
few days away from the Fort, where they had got supplies, I asked how it
was that they were so badly off. Their reply was that they had
unfortunately left their powder, which they were carrying in a canvas
bag, out on the rock a few nights before. While they slept the rain came
down upon them and ruined it, and so they could not shoot anything. I
quickly said to one of my men, &ldquo;How much food have we?&rdquo; He
examined our limited supply, and then said there was about one square
meal.</p>

<p>We found these men were pagan Indians, whom I had met before, and had
talked with about becoming Christians; but all I could get from them was
the characteristic Indian shrug of the shoulders, and the words,
&ldquo;As our fathers lived, so will we.&rdquo; Our dinner was the last
of a bear we had shot a few days before. While it was cooking the storm
which we feared began to gather, and ere our dinner was finished the lake
looked very different from what it was an hour before, if we had not
stopped, we could have easily got across it. As it was now, it would have
been madness to have ventured out upon it. So we had to pull up our
canoe, and there, as contentedly as possible, wait for the storm to
cease. It raged furiously all that day and the next. The third day it
began to moderate. What made it worse for us was the scarcity, or rather
the entire absence, of food. We were unfortunately storm-bound in about
the worst part of that country for game. It was so late in the season
that the ducks and geese had gone south, the beaver and musk-rats were in
their houses, and we could find nothing. On some of our trips we carried
fishing-tackle, but this time we had nothing of the kind. Fortunately we
had some tea and sugar.</p>

<p>Without breakfast, dinner, or supper, we had to live on as best we
could. Before we lay down to sleep there had to be a considerable
tightening of the belts, or there would be no sleep at all, so keen were
the gnawings of hunger. I found it helpful to sleep to roll up my towel
as hard as possible, and then crowd it under my tight belt over the pit
of my stomach. Nearly three days without food was no pleasant ordeal even
in missionary work.</p>

<p>We held several religious services, even though our congregation was a
small one. We also found out that it was not at all helpful to piety to
try to worship on an empty stomach, and have been ever since in great
sympathy with these who would feed the poor first, and then preach to
them.</p>

<p>The third day one of the Indians, while walking along the shore, found
the old bleached shoulder-blade of a bear. With his knife he carved out a
rude fish-hook, and, taking the strings of his moccasins and others', he
formed a line. A piece of red flannel was used as bait, and a small stone
served as a sinker. With this primitive arrangement he began fishing. His
method was to stand on a rock and throw the hook out as far as his line
would permit, and then draw it in rapidly, like trolling.</p>

<p>Strange to say, with this rude appliance he caught a fish. It was a
pike weighing six or eight pounds. Very quickly was it scaled, cleaned,
and put in the pot. When cooked, about a third of it was put on my tin
plate, and placed before me with these words: &ldquo;Please, Missionary,
eat.&rdquo; I looked at the hungry men around me and said, &ldquo;No,
that is not the way.&rdquo; And then I put back the third of the fish
with the rest, and, taking out my hunting knife, I counted the company,
and then cut the fish into eight pieces, and gave each man his eighth,
and took an equal portion myself. It was right that I should thus act,
and it seemed to be a little thing to do, but it was a sermon that led
those five men to become Christians. As soon as they had finished their
portions they lit their pipes, and as they smoked they talked; and as
near as I and my men could make out, here is what they said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must listen with both ears to that Missionary. He is here
without food, suffering from hunger, because he stopped to share with us
his last meal. We caught a fish, and when we offered him a large piece he
refused it, and divided equally with us all. He has been anxious to do us
good and to have us to listen to his words. He has not once scolded us
for asking him to stop, although he could have got across the lake before
the storm arose, and, as the rest of the way is in the river, he could
have gone on home. He has shown himself to be our friend, and we must
listen to what he has to say.&rdquo; Thus they went on, and I must
confess I paid but little attention to what they were saying. After a few
hours more the storm went down, and we gladly embarked that evening in
our canoe and pushed on.</p>

<p>The next day we reached the Mission village of Rossville, making our
last portage at Sea River Falls, near Norway House; and as we saw the
fish and venison hanging on the stagings around the houses of the people,
my patient fellows cried out, &ldquo;We should like to laugh at the sight
of food, but we are too empty altogether.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We paddled the last mile as quickly as we had any other, and kept up
our courage until we were home. As I entered the house, a strange
faintness came over me, and all the welcome words I could give to my
loved ones were, &ldquo;My dear, we are starving; please get us some
food.&rdquo; Then I sank down exhausted. Loving care from one of the best
and bravest of wives quickly brought me round again, and I was soon ready
to be off on another trip.</p>

<p>The long winter passed away, and the welcome summer came at last. We
have really very little of spring in that northern land. The transition
from winter to summer is very rapid. With the disappearance of the ice
from the lakes and rivers came the Indians in their birch canoes, from
various quarters where they had spent the winter in trapping the
fur-bearing animals. As usual they came to see the Missionary in goodly
numbers. Among those who thus honoured us were five big men, who, after a
few words of greeting, said, &ldquo;We hope you have not forgotten the
fish; we have not, and we want to have a talk with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fish?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Why, we have fish twenty-one times
a week, boiled, baked, fried, salt, dried, &mdash; good, bad, and
indifferent. I have seen so many fishes, I cannot think of any one in
particular.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then they told me about the long delay by the storm, when I had
stopped and fed them, at the time when they had not kept their powder
dry; and how, when one of them caught a fish and offered me a good-sized
piece, I divided it equally among them. As they brought the incident back
to my memory, for there were so many strange adventures occurring in the
wild life that this one had partly faded, I said: &ldquo;Yes, I now
remember there did happen something of the kind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Very earnestly spoke up one of them and said: &ldquo;We have never
forgotten it, and all through the moons of the winter we have talked
about it and your lessons out of the great Book. And while up to that
time we had decided not to be Christians, but to die as did our fathers,
we have changed our minds since that time you divided the fish, and we
want you to teach us more and more of this good way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were intensely in earnest and fully decided for Christ. So five
more families settled down in the Christian village, and are giving
evidence by their lives and conversation that the change wrought in them
was real and abiding. Their conversion in this peculiar way was very
cheering to us, and it was another lesson to be &ldquo;instant in season,
out of season.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_19">Chapter Eighteen. Exploring new
fields &mdash; The Gospel before treaties &mdash; Big Tom's noble spirit
of self-sacrifice.</a></h3>

<p>In 1873 I received a most urgent request from a deputation of Indians
to go and visit a band of their countrymen who lived on the western side
of Lake Winnipeg at a place called Jack Head. They were getting unsettled
and uneasy in their minds in reference to their lands. Treaties were
being made with other tribes, but nothing as yet had been done for them;
and as surveyors and other white men had been seen in their country, they
were suspicious, and wanted to know what they had better do.</p>

<p>So, after many councils among themselves, they decided to send over
into the land of the Crees and Salteaux for their Missionary to come and
give them advice, in order that they too might make a treaty with the
Government of the Queen.</p>

<p>I felt much pleased on receiving this deputation; and as it would give
me a grand opportunity to preach the Gospel to a people who had not as
yet heard it, I consented to go. With two dog-trains, and accompanied by
a couple of trusty Indians, we left the Eastern side of the great Lake
Winnipeg about sunrise. We dug a hole in the snow at Pigeon Point, and
there made a fire of some dry young willows, and enjoyed our breakfast.
From that point we struck out in a south-west direction across the great
lake. The day, although cold, was a very bright one. The ice was good,
and our dogs were magnificent fellows; and so we sped along at a rapid
rate. We reached a chain of little islands out in the middle of the lake
early in the afternoon. On the shore of one of them we gathered some dry
wood, cleared away the snow, made a fire, melted some snow, and made
ourselves a good kettle of tea. This, with some pemmican and flat cakes,
made us a capital dinner.</p>

<p>From this island the western shore of the lake was just visible, over
thirty miles away. Towards it we pushed as rapidly as possible,
considering that one of our Indians was quite an old man. When within
about three miles of the shore, the report of fire-arms reached our ears,
telling us that the Indians had observed our coming. Our noble dogs
seemed to rejoice at the sound as much as ourselves, and, well knowing
that their day's journey of over sixty miles was nearly ended, changed
their swinging trot into a gallop; and very soon we were at Jack head,
and among its plumed and painted inhabitants, by whom we were received in
a most extraordinary manner.</p>

<p>At some other places where I have gone as the first Missionary who
ever visited them, I have had two or three hundred men, women, and
children trying to see who could be the first to kiss me; but here the
reception was very different. Night was just falling upon us as we drew
near the shore, but there was light enough to observe that the narrow
trail, up from the lake into the dark recesses of the forest, along which
we must pass with our dog-trains, was lined with men armed with guns.</p>

<p>When we were about a hundred yards from them, the foremost ones began
firing. This <i>feu-de-joie</i> continued until we had reached them and
had dashed through the lines of fire, for they continued loading and
firing as rapidly as possible. Our ears were almost deafened with the
continuous reports, and our nerves were somewhat tried, as the younger
braves especially consider it great fun to fire off their heavy charges
of powder as close to their visitors' heads as possible. But a
well-singed fur cap was the only evidence of harm having been done.</p>

<p>To increase the welcome, they courteously brought out for our special
benefit the few English and French words of which they were masters. Some
of them were most ludicrously out of place. It did require a good deal of
nerve to keep my face straight when a grave and dignified chief, who
wished to inquire politely as to my health, for the moment dropped his
own language, and in good English said, &ldquo;Does your mother know
you're out?&rdquo; I found out afterwards that a roguish fur-trader had
taught him the expression, as a very polite one to use to distinguished
strangers.</p>

<p>We quickly unharnessed and fed our faithful dogs. We hung up in the
trees our sleds and harness beyond the reach of the wolfish curs, which
in large numbers prowled around. If they could get the opportunity, they
would make short work of the deer-skin and raw-hide fastenings of the
sleds, and the harness would entirely disappear, with perhaps the
exception of the buckles. We waited until our big dogs had given a few of
the most impudent and saucy of these brutes a good thrashing, so that
there was some prospect of peace; and then, feeling that our outside work
was attended to, and that the Indians had had time to get arranged in
their council room, we went to the door, and were ceremoniously ushered
in. The council house was a large square log building of much better
construction than I had expected to see. It was without partitions, and
was lighted by the brilliant council fire, and a number of fish oil lamps
hanging from the walls. At the places of honour were seated the chiefs of
the band. Their &ldquo;thrones of state" were curiously woven mats of
rushes made by the Indian women. Their head-dresses were gorgeous masses
of feathers, and their costume was very picturesque. Some of them had not
yet adopted the pantaloons of civilisation, but wore instead the scant
leggings of native manufacture.</p>

<p>From the chiefs on either side and extending around the room in
circles, were the old men and warriors and hunters, ranged according to
their rank and standing. Behind these were the young men and boys. All
were seated on the ground, and all were silent, as I entered. The chiefs
were fine-looking men, and there was that indescribable<i>hauteur</i> now
so rarely seen among this interesting people. Crowded out behind the men
and boys, and in many places packed against the walls of the house, were
the women and girls. While the men were in many instances well and often
brilliantly dressed in their finery, the women and girls were wretchedly
clothed, and miserable in appearance.</p>

<p>The house was filled, with the exception of a small space reserved at
the right hand of the principal chief for the visitors. With a good deal
of ceremony we were escorted to our seats. For me they had obtained a
little box, on which a fur robe was placed, as they said afterwards, that
they had heard that white men cannot sit comfortably on the ground. On
this I seated myself next to the chief, and my attendant Indians ranged
themselves beside me. During the profound silence that lasted for several
minutes after our entrance, I had a good opportunity to grasp the
situation. I breathed an earnest prayer to God for the much-needed
wisdom, and that I might here preach the Gospel in such a way that it
might be understood and accepted by this people, the majority of whom had
not as yet heard the glad tidings of salvation.</p>

<p>Then I rose up and, addressing the chief, I said: &ldquo;I have come
at your request from across the great Winnipeg, to visit you and to meet
you at your council fire. I will preach to you and discuss treaty matters
with you, and will help you all I can with the Government. I want to find
out your views about giving up your old paganism and becoming Christians.
I also want to know how many children you have among you, and if you
desire a school for them. So I am here for these reasons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When I sat down, the calumet, the pipe of peace, was gravely lit, and
after the chief had puffed away at it, he handed it to me. As I have not
as yet acquired the art of smoking, I adopted the plan of taking hold of
the long stem, which is over a yard in length, by the middle. The result
was that when my hand was near my mouth, the mouthpiece of the pipe was a
foot or so behind my head. As previously arranged, one of my obliging
Indians was always on hand to do my smoking.</p>

<p>After the pipe ceremony was over, the chief began his address of
welcome. He said a good many kind things, and told me of their anxieties
as to their future and that of their children. The fire-canoe (the
steamboat) was rushing through the waters, destroying their fisheries.
The white hunters, with their fire guns and steel traps, were fast
killing off the game. The surveyor was driving his lines of stakes into
the ground, and the white people, more numerous than mosquitoes, were
crowding in on the prairies. They had nothing but peace in their hearts,
but still he could not help thinking that a treaty ought to be made with
them before the fire canoe or the surveyor came. They were powerless
themselves to speak before the Queen's representative, the Governor. They
had heard of the Missionary's love for the Indian, and so they had sent
across the great Winnipeg for him, and their hearts were glad that he had
come. With their right hands they had fired off their guns, which all
said, &ldquo;Welcome!&rdquo; With his left hand he had handed the pipe of
peace, which also from the heart again said, &ldquo;Welcome I&rdquo;
Their hearts were all glad that with their eyes they saw the Missionary
among them. Their ears were now open to hear what he had to say about
their future, and what he thought the Queen's men would do for them.</p>

<p>Then he sat down on his mat, and I rose up and in reply said:
&ldquo;Before I dare talk to you about treaties, and lands, and your
future for this life, and that of your children, I must speak about
something more important.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This seemed to astonish them, and they said: &ldquo;What has he got to
talk about that is more important than the treaty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;I have something more important
than the treaty, and something to say about One greater than the Queen,
or the Governor she sends; for I must first talk about our great God,
Whom the Queen and we all must love if we would be happy. The Great
Spirit, our good Father in heaven, wants to make a treaty with us; and if
we will be willing to comply with His conditions, it will be the best
treaty ever made, for it will bring us joy and happiness for this life
and the life to come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loud were their words of approval that I should thus speak to them;
and so I preached to them, making use of my trusted and careful
interpreter, Timothy Bear, who is as thorough a master of the Saulteaux
language as he is of the Cree. Considering that it was the first sermon
they had ever heard, and that their ideas of our worship were very crude,
they behaved remarkably well, seeing they were a crowd of plumed and
painted savages, and Saulteaux besides. They kept up a constant smoking
through all the service, except when we were singing or at prayer. Men,
women, and children were all at it, and it seemed as though they were
always at it.</p>

<p>Before I got through my sermon I was almost suffocated by the smoke.
The cloud, not that for which we had prayed, overwhelmed us, blinded us,
and nearly smothered us. It was the cloud of their vile weeds and
tobacco. As well as I could I talked to them of God and his love, and of
the way of salvation, and the blessings which would come to them if they
would cheerfully and heartily accept Him. We then sang the Jubilee
hymn,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><br>
 &ldquo;Blow ye the trumpet, blow.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
</blockquote>

<p>This hymn has been translated into their language. The tune we used
was &ldquo;Lennox,&rdquo; and I urged them to help us to sing. I gave out
the hymn verse by verse, and said, &ldquo;Sing as well as you can.&rdquo;
Some followed very well, and others, while trying to follow the words,
seemed to have substituted for the tune one of their Indian lilts. After
the religious service was over, we hastily boiled our kettles, made tea,
and had our suppers, for we had travelled far, and were very hungry. The
Indians had nothing themselves but tea, fish, and tobacco. I never saw
such smokers. Even little unweaned children were adepts in the use of the
pipe.</p>

<p>After tea the ceremonious speeches were delivered. The head chief was
of course the first to speak again. His address was very complimentary.
He said he had been gazing all day long across the great lake watching
for my coming. Although it was several moons since, I had promised that
in this one, if possible, I would be on hand. My coming just at the time
I did, showed that I was a man of my word, and could be depended
upon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We feel,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that we Indians are but
children in the presence of the whites. Great changes are taking place.
The buffalo and deer once so abundant are fast disappearing. Our fathers
told us long ago that the buffalo was the special gift of the Great
Spirit to the Indian, and that when it disappeared the Indian must go
also. But in your words you tell us good things about the Great Spirit,
and we are thankful that you have come. We wish you could live among us
and thus talk to us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus he and others talked for a long time.</p>

<p>We went over the business of the approaching treaty, and I told them
all I knew about the matter, and assured them that they need have no fear
or alarm. The Dominion Government would treat them honourably and fairly.
More tobacco was smoked, and extra kettles of tea were made and drunk,
and then I was told that as an additional mark of their thankfulness to
me for thus coming with these assuring and quieting words, they now
wished to give me the tribal ceremony of the greatest welcome, which was
only given at rare intervals, and then only when the best of news came to
them.</p>

<p>The room was quickly rearranged for the ceremony. The crowd in the
centre of the room was moved back, much to the discomfort of the women
and girls, some of whom were roughly ejected to make room for their
tyrants and masters. Then some drums were brought in, and between twenty
and thirty of the most active and agile young men, dressed, or rather
undressed, in their picturesque way, seated themselves closely around the
men who were to act as drummers. The first part of the ceremony was
supposed to be a kind of a concert, part musical and part pantomime.</p>

<p>To describe it with its monotonous drumming and shrill songs, which
they said were words of welcome, is altogether beyond my powers. At
certain places in the songs, ten or twenty of the young men would spring
up in their places, and without moving their feet from the ground would
go through such strong, undulating, graceful motions, and yet all in such
perfect unison with each other and with the music, that I was almost
fascinated by the strange weird beauty of the scene.</p>

<p>Then their programme changed, and rapidly they glided around in simple
and intricate movements, but all in perfect time to the songs and
drums.</p>

<p>Not satisfied with giving me the welcome of their own tribe, they also
gave me the still more exciting Sioux welcome, and also that of the wild
Crees in the Saskatchewan. Until long after midnight these scenes were
being enacted. Then word was passed round that the supply of tobacco
devoted to the welcome ceremonies was exhausted, for through all of these
scenes the pipes were only out of the mouths of the performers. All the
rest of the crowd smoked without apparent cessation.</p>

<p>This intimation of the exhaustion of the supply of tobacco abruptly
closed the ceremony. Such is their custom. Some more tea was made and
drunk by the chiefs. Then the Missionary's hand was shaken, and the
people quickly flitted away to their wigwams. A supper, consisting of
beautiful fish, called &ldquo;gold eyes,&rdquo; which are caught by the
young Indians in the rapid river at the foot of the Rude Water Slide, was
then much enjoyed.</p>

<p>One of my faithful Indians brought in my camp bed, and unrolled it
near the council fire. I rolled myself up in a blanket and buffalo robe,
and there on the ground I soon fell asleep, for I was very weary. At
daybreak we arose, and had our breakfast cooked at the council fire.
While eating it, many of the Indians crowded in to see us ere we left for
our home across Lake Winnipeg. With them we held another religious
service. I talked kindly and faithfully to them, and urged them to decide
speedily to forsake their old pagan habits and become Christians; telling
them that now, as they were making treaties and entering upon a new way
of obtaining a living, they should adopt the religion of the great
Book.</p>

<p>With them we sang a hymn, and then kneeled down and prayed. Devoutly
and reverently did they bow with us at the Mercy-seat. When we rose up
from our knees, a young man spoke up on behalf of the young people. He
said they were glad I had come, and hoped I would come again. Their minds
were dark; would I soon come back and bring in the light?</p>

<p>I said all I could to encourage them to seek after the great Light,
and promised to come again. We harnessed up our dogs, and, in company
with my attendant Indians, I started for home. A wild blizzard storm came
down upon us from the north when we were far out from land. We toiled on
through it as well as we could, although at times unable to see a dozen
feet ahead of us. Often we got bewildered by its fury, as it seemed to
circle and eddy around us; but Jack was in the foremost train, and so we
safely reached the other shore, and did not for many a day cease to think
about some of the strange features of this adventurous trip, in which in
after years we found much real good had been done.</p>

<p>As we have been referring to treaties and the excitement there was in
the minds of the Indians in reference to the new relationship in which
they would stand to the Government, it may be well here to put upon
record the noble spirit of one of our Indians, on whom honours were
desired to be conferred by his people.</p>

<p>When the Dominion Government of Canada took possession of the
territories so long held by the Hudson's Bay Company, they began to make
arrangements for treaties with all the Indian tribes. Word came out to us
at Rossville Mission House, that the Government wished the Indians to
elect one of their number as chief, with whom they could make a treaty,
and whom they could confer with if difficulties arose in the future. They
wished the people to select a wise, judicious man, in whom all confidence
could be placed.</p>

<p>Naturally the Indians were very much excited at this new order of
things, and so there were many councils and much speech-making. A good
deal of curiosity was expressed to know what benefits would result, and
how much money would be received by each of them. While there was still
much uncertainty about these things, it had become well known that the
one selected to be chief would fare very well. He would have more money
and presents than any other. He would be presented with a silver medal
with the face of the &ldquo;Great Mother,&rdquo; the Queen, upon it, and
would be honoured with the personal friendship of the Governor, and with
other honours naturally dear to the Indian.</p>

<p>After many councils the people came to the almost unanimous conclusion
that Big Tom should be their chief. In a full council, with much
ceremony, they offered him the position. Instead of seizing the proffered
honours with avidity, his face became very grave, and it was evident he
was full of suppressed emotion. When he arose, as all supposed, to
indicate his acceptance of the position, and to express his thanks, they
were very much surprised to hear him quietly say that he could not answer
fully now, but desired a day to think it over. So he asked the council to
adjourn until the following morning.</p>

<p>Of course this request was complied with, and, full of curiosity, the
people thronged the building the next day. I had naturally taken a deep
interest in the matter, as, next to their spiritual interests, I was
anxious to do all I could for their temporal welfare. So I attended many
of their meetings. The council was opened in due form, and then Big Tom
arose to give, his answer. He began quietly and slowly, but warmed up a
good deal before he ended.</p>

<p>He spoke, in substance, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Long ago, when the Missionaries came and preached to us, for a
time we refused to listen to them, and would not become Christians. Then,
after a while, many of us who had been in the darkness began to feel in
our hearts that what they told us was for our good; and so we accepted of
these things, and they have done us good. When I got the assurance in my
heart that I was a child of God, and had a soul that should live for
ever, I found that in working out its salvation I had something great to
live for. To do this was the great object of my life. By-and-by I
married, and then, as my family increased and began to grow up around me,
I found I had another object for which to live. To help them along in the
way to heaven, as well as to work for their comfort here, was my second
great work. Then, after a while, the Missionary gave me the charge of a
class. I was to meet with them, and we were to talk together about our
souls and God's love to us, and to do all we could to help each other on
to the better land. To do my duty as the leader was a great and important
work. While attending to these duties, I found I had another object for
which to live. These three things, &mdash; 1. My own soul's salvation; 2.
The salvation of my family; and 3. To do all I can to help and encourage
the members of my class to be true and faithful to Him Who died for us,
that we may see him by-and-by, &mdash; are the uppermost things in my
heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am thankful for your confidence in me in asking me to be your
chief. I know it is a great honour, but I see it will have many
responsibilities, and that whoever has the position will have to attend
to many other things than those which I have my mind set upon. So you
must appoint some one else, for with those three things I cannot let
anything else interfere. I thank you, my brothers, and love you
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In this strain he went on for a long while, and then sat down. No one
thought any the less of the noble Christian man; and David Bundle, who
was appointed, ever found in Big Tom a wise and judicious counsellor and
friend. I was thrilled by the address and the spirit manifested. How few
white men in like circumstances would have had grace and self-denial
enough to have acted in a similar manner!</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_20">Chapter Nineteen. The mission among
the Saulteaux established &mdash; Nelly's death &mdash; Missionary
anniversaries attended &mdash; Rev. Thomas Crosby &mdash; Travelling
adventures &mdash; More working with dogs &mdash; Our new home &mdash;
Visit from a chieftainess &mdash; Closing words.</a></h3>

<p>After a great deal of correspondence it was decided that I should
begin the work at Beren's River among the Saulteaux Indians who lived
there, and in little bands scattered along the eastern shores of that
great lake, and in the interior, most of them in extreme poverty and
superstitious degradation. A few of them, as the result of acquaintance
with our Christian Indians of other places, were groping after the great
Light, and trying to lift themselves up socially in life.</p>

<p>The Rev. John H. Ruttan was appointed to Norway House, the Rev. Orrin
German to Oxford House, and I was put down for Beren's River.</p>

<p>As it was advisable that I should remain at Norway House until my
successor, Brother Ruttan, arrived, and as there was only one opportunity
for a long time for Mrs Young and the children to return to Red River,
they availed themselves of it, poor and miserable as it was.</p>

<p>With loving &ldquo;farewells&rdquo; I wished them success on their
journey, and saw them off. Sandy Harte, our adopted Indian lad, and I
sailed down to the old Norway House, about twenty miles from our home,
and there saying &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; we returned to our lonely
home.</p>

<p>Mrs Young had with her our three darling children, Eddie, Lilian, and
Nelly. All were well and full of the best of spirits as the sail was
hoisted, and we saw them glide away before the favouring gale. Precious
Nelly we never saw again. So terrible was the heat, and so miserable were
the accommodations in that little open boat, without deck or awning or
cabin, that the child sickened and died.</p>

<p>As we have referred to this sad event in an earlier chapter, we need
not dwell upon it here. What the poor mother felt and suffered as, sick
herself, she saw her beautiful child attacked by brain fever, and then
droop and die amidst surroundings so sad and trying, can be realised by
but few. God knows all about it. As mentioned, the venerable Archdeacon
Cowley's sympathy did much to raise up Mrs Young's crushed spirits and
dry her bitter tears.</p>

<p>I remained at Norway House until Brothers Ruttan and German arrived;
and then, after having spent a Sabbath with them, and seen Mr Ruttan and
his noble young wife cheerfully and hopefully entered upon their blessed
work among the people, to whom I had become very much attached, I started
off for Beren's River. Sandy Harte, the Nelson River lad, went with me as
far as my first camping place, and spent the night with me. We read the
sacred Word together, and then, after singing a Hymn, we bowed in prayer.
We lay down together, but we had so much to say, that hours passed away
ere we slept.</p>

<p>Early the next morning we were aroused from our slumbers by the cry of
&ldquo;Fair wind,&rdquo; and so no time must be lost. I was very much
surprised to find that during the night some scores of Indians had come
on in their canoes from the Mission, although it was many miles away, to
shake hands with their Missionary once more, and say a final
&ldquo;Farewell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alter a hasty breakfast we assembled on the shore for prayers. We sang
in Cree a favourite hymn:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><br>
 &ldquo;Jesus, my All, to heaven is gone,<br>
 He Whom I fix my hopes upon.<br>
 His path I see, and I'll pursue<br>
 The narrow way till Him I view.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
</blockquote>

<p>We closed by singing the Doxology, and then, after prayers, I sadly
said &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; and shook hands again with them all. I found
it hard to break away from them. Many of them were in tears, who seldom
wept before. Coming to my beloved Sandy last, I put my arm around his
neck and kissed him as there he stood, weeping as though his heart would
break. With a &ldquo;God bless you all,&rdquo; I sprang into the boat,
which was quickly pushed off from the shore, and then the long journey to
the land of the Saulteaux was begun.</p>

<p>After some of the usual incidents of travel I reached Beren's River,
and was most enthusiastically received by the Indians. The man who had
said, &ldquo;Our eyes were dim from long watching,&rdquo; now said that
they were dim with tears of joy that he had lived to see the day when a
Missionary of their own lived among them. As I was to leave before the
lake froze up, every day was precious. I pitched a canvas tent, and in it
lived for several weeks. All assembled once every week-day for religious
worship, and then, when that was over, the Missionary and men took off
their coats and went to work. The spot for the Mission was decided upon,
and then acre after acre of the forest from this place, and also from
where each Indian had decided to build, was rapidly being cleared of the
forest trees. We held three services every Lord's day, and saw that the
school for the children was faithfully kept up.</p>

<p>Getting everything in good shape, and leaving Martin Papanekis, a
devout and trusty Christian Indian from the Norway House Mission, in
charge, I started in a birch canoe, with Big Tom as principal canoe-man,
for Red River.</p>

<p>Of our adventures and dangers I need not write, although there were
several on that long journey in such a frail craft. One complete upset
chilled me most thoroughly, as the water was about down to freezing
point. At one place, where we tried to push on all night, we were
tantalised by some most brilliant &ldquo;Will-o'-the-wisp&rdquo; lights,
which our experienced Indians thought were decoy signals put out by
wicked Indians to bewilder or injure us. Canoe travelling on this great
lake is risky business. The storms come up with surprising rapidity, and
the waves rise up like those of the ocean. However, we had a good canoe,
and Big Tom was in charge; and He Who holds the winds and the waves in
His fists was our Father and our Friend.</p>

<p>At Red River I called on the Rev. Archdeacon Cowley at his Indian
Mission home. Very cordial and sympathetic was he, as I introduced
myself, and told him I had come to accept of his kind offer, and seek in
some part of the quiet graveyard of his Mission Church a little place
where I could bury the body of my darling child. He at once went with me
and showed me all kindness and help, as also did Mr Flett and his family,
of the Hudson's Bay Company's Service. As we laid away the beautiful
child, and the solemn words, &ldquo;Earth to earth, dust to dust,&rdquo;
were uttered, we felt that there was now an additional tie holding us to
that country and work.</p>

<p>In due time I reached Toronto, and there met the Missionary
Secretaries, and obtained from them an outline of the work before me.
Here it was my great joy to meet for the first time the Rev. Thomas
Crosby, the energetic and successful Missionary from British Columbia,
who has been wonderfully owned of God in his glorious work. Uncalled by
any Church, but impelled by the good Spirit, shortly after his conversion
he made his way to British Columbia at his own expense, and offered
himself to one of the Missionaries there as a volunteer teacher among the
poor, neglected Indians, who, uncared for by any one, were prowling
around the cities and towns of that new Province, living lives of shame
and sin. Great indeed was his success.</p>

<p>He has also established flourishing Missions at Fort Simpson and
elsewhere in the north of that land, and through his labours a blessed
work began among the Indians in Alaska. Some of them, hearing wonderful
stories about the black-coated man and his mysterious Book, came hundreds
of miles, that they might have their curiosity satisfied. They returned
with more than they anticipated. They reached the Mission, and from Mr
Crosby, and also from some of their own tribes who lived there, they
heard the &ldquo;old, old story&rdquo; for the first time in their lives.
It was indeed wonderful news to them, but they accepted it with a simple
faith that was pleasing to God, and brought into their hearts the
consciousness of His smile and benediction. Rejoicing in this new-found
treasure they returned to their own land, and there they published the
glad tidings of God's love, and added the testimony of their own personal
experience that they had a new joy in their hearts, the result of their
having accepted this Saviour. Great indeed was the excitement among the
people. Some mocked, and some opposed and tried to persecute, but many
were affected by what their companions had brought them, and believing
their testimony entered into their joy.</p>

<p>Of course the new converts could give but little instruction; and so,
as the work proceeded, it was decided that a deputation must go for the
Missionary and bring him into their land. Mr Crosby responded, and went
over to Alaska, and spent some time among them. God blessed his labours,
and many of the Indians gave up their paganism and became Christians.
Convinced that a grand opening was here for Missionary triumph, Mr Crosby
wrote to the Methodist Episcopal Mission Rooms, New York, urging the
officials there to enter this open door and begin work here. The answer
was that it was impossible; that their other fields absorbed all their
income, and so there was no prospect of their being able to respond to
his appeal.</p>

<p>Not to be discouraged very easily, Mr Crosby next wrote to the
Presbyterian Board at Philadelphia, and told of these poor sheep in the
wilderness; and here, thank God, he met with success, and there was a
glad response; and the successful Presbyterian Missions and Indian
Schools in that land to-day are the outgrowth of that work.</p>

<p>In company with this heroic Brother Crosby, who had so much to tell, I
spent several months in attending Missionary Meetings. We had blessed
times. Immense crowds came out to hear us, and, if I am not mistaken, the
increase in the Missionary income that year was the greatest in its
history. In all, we attended eighty-nine Missionary Anniversary Services
in different Canadian towns and cities between Sarnia and Quebec.</p>

<p>A very happy week was spent with my family at &ldquo;Oaklands,&rdquo;
Toronto, the beautiful residence of the Honourable Senator Macdonald, the
Lay Treasurer of our Missionary Society. Of Senator Macdonald's great
kindness, and tangible evidences of sympathy, neither few nor slight, if
I should here write, I should only be mentioning what scores of Ministers
and Missionaries could say had been their own fortunate experiences with
this large-hearted philanthropist. Eternity alone will be able to reveal
the full measure of what, with a glad heart, he has been constantly and
unostentatiously doing for many of Christ's ambassadors, and among the
different Churches.</p>

<p>As soon as the season for holding Missionary Meetings ended, I
returned to my Indian work. I left the Province of Ontario on the 6th of
April, and reached Beren's River after twenty-three days of continuous
travelling. On the railroads in Minnesota and Dacota we were detained by
snowdrifts, which so blocked up our way that we had some very unpleasant
experiences. After leaving the railroad I had to travel two hundred and
fifty miles in a stage on runners over the snowy prairies. We had some
blizzards to encounter, and one night, when we were fortunate enough to
have reached one of the stopping places, the storm raged like a
hurricane. The house was built of logs, and not well finished, and the
snow sifted in through the wide cracks between these logs and on to our
beds. My experiences in wintry camps served me a good purpose now, and so
pulling up the hood of my overcoat, and then completely covering myself
up under the bedclothes, I slept soundly through the raging storm and
driving snow. When we were called up to eat a hasty breakfast and resume
our journey, I found several inches of snow on the top of my bed, but I
had suffered no inconvenience from it. With my travelling companions in
the other beds it was very different. The upper storey, in which our beds
were placed, was all one room, and so the snow had equally assailed us
all. But, not being able to sleep with their heads completely covered up,
they had suffered much, and were in anything but an amiable mood when we
resumed our journey.</p>

<p>At Winnipeg I was cordially welcomed by my beloved Chairman, the Rev.
George Young, who had ever taken the deepest interest in my work, and
done all he could to add to our comfort and efficiency in its
prosecution. Fortunate indeed were we, poor Missionaries in the interior,
whether it was north or west, that we had such a man to look after our
supplies, and see that we were not cheated or swindled by those who once
a year sent them out to the poor toilers in their lonely fields. For
years we had no money in our northern Missions. Our plan was, once a year
to receive from Winnipeg all that our salary would purchase for us in the
shape of supplies that were needed in our own home, and also with which
to pay teacher, interpreter, guides, canoe-men, dog-drivers, and others
who might be employed in the prosecution of the work.</p>

<p>As all the work of purchasing and packing these things depended very
much upon the Chairman, fortunate indeed did all of us, who had Dr. Young
as our Chairman, consider ourselves to be.</p>

<p>My dogs and Indians were waiting for me, having come down from the
north to meet me, as arranged months before. We purchased our supplies,
loaded our sleds, and away we started by dog-train on the last part of
the long journey. We had left Toronto in a splendid railroad carriage; we
ended the trip of over twenty days' duration with dog sleds.</p>

<p>Very quickly did I come back to the wild life of the North after the
six months of incessant pleading the cause of the Indians before the
large and enthusiastic audiences in our towns and cities. The days of
hard and rapid travelling over the frozen surface of Lake Winnipeg,
&mdash; the bitter cold that often made us shiver in spite of the violent
exercise of running, &mdash; the intense and almost unbearable pain
caused by the reflection of the brilliant rays of the sun upon the snowy
waste, &mdash; the bed in the hole in the snow with no roof above us but
the star-decked vault of heaven, &mdash; were all cheerfully endured
again and successfully passed through.</p>

<p>Very cordial was my welcome by the Saulteaux at my new field. I was
very much gratified to find that they had had a successful winter, and
that those left in charge had worked faithfully and well. A little log
house, twelve by twenty-four feet, had been put up, and in one end of it
I was installed as my present home. My apartment was just twelve feet
square, but to me it was all-sufficient. It was kitchen, bedroom,
dining-room, study, reception-room, and everything else. Two of my
grandest dogs, Jack and Cuffy, shared it with me for months, and we had a
happy and busy time. With several hard-working Indians, two of them being
Big Tom and Martin Papanekis from Norway House, we toiled hard at getting
out the timber and logs for our new church, school-house, and parsonage.
We had to go a distance of twelve or fourteen miles over the frozen lake
ere we reached the large island on which we found timber sufficiently
large for our purpose. Here we worked as hard as possible. Often we had
to go in miles from the shore to find what we wanted. To make our work
more difficult, we found but few large trees growing close together. So,
for nearly every large stick of timber, we had to make a new trail
through the deep snow to the lake. The snow was from three to four feet
deep. The under-brush was thick, and the fallen trees were numerous. Yet
under these discouragements we worked. We cut down the trees, measured
them, squared them, and got them ready for their places. Then we hitched
one end on a strong dog sled, and attached one dog to this heavy load.
How four dogs could drag these heavy sticks of timber was indeed
surprising. The principal pieces were thirty-six feet long and ten inches
square. Yet my gallant St. Bernards and Newfoundlands would take these
heavy loads along at a rate that was astounding. We had thirty-two dogs
at work, and rapidly did our piles of timber and logs accumulate.</p>

<p>Dressed as one of the natives, with them I toiled incessantly for the
material upbuilding of the Mission. We had delightful services every
Sabbath. Nearly every Indian within some miles of the place attended, and
good results were continually cheering our hearts. Although it was so
late in the season when I arrived, yet there was not, for weeks after,
any sign of the spring, except in the lengthening days and increasingly
brilliant sun. For a long time the vast snowy wastes remained crisp and
hard. Very glorious was the atmosphere, for there were no fogs, no mists,
no damps. The sky seemed always cloudless, the air was always clear.</p>

<p>Nearly every morning during those weeks of hard toil we were treated
to the strange sights which the beautiful and vivid mirage brought to us.
Islands and headlands, scores of miles away, were lifted up from below
the horizon, and shown to us as distinctly as though close at hand. With
but few exceptions our nights also were very glorious, especially when
the Northern Lights, taking this vast Lake Winnipeg as their field of
action, held one of their grand carnivals. Generally beginning in the far
north, with majestic sweep they came marching on, filling the very
heavens with their coloured bars, or flashing, ever-changing, yet always
beautiful clouds of brightness and glory. Sometimes they would form a
magnificent corona at the zenith, and from its dazzling splendour would
shoot out long columns of different coloured lights, which rested upon
the far-off frozen shores. Often have I seen a cloud of light flit
swiftly across these tinted bars, as if a hand were sweeping the strings
of some grand harp. So startling was the resemblance, that there was an
instinctive listening for the sound that we used to think ought to come.
Sometimes I have suddenly stopped my dogs and men, when we have been
travelling amidst these fascinating and almost bewildering glories of the
heavens above us, and we have listened for that rustling sound of
celestial harmony which some Arctic travellers have affirmed they have
heard, and which it seemed to me so evident that we ought to hear. But
although for years I have watched and listened, amidst the death
stillness of these snowy wastes, no sounds have I ever heard. Amidst all
their flashing and changing glories these resplendent beauties ever
seemed to me as voiceless as the stars above them.</p>

<p>When spring arrived, and with its open water came our first boats, we
brought out from Red River a quantity of building material and two
experienced carpenters. Then actively went on the work of building a
Mission House, and also a large school-house, which for a time was to
serve as a church also. We called it &ldquo;the Tabernacle,&rdquo; and
for a good while it served its double purpose admirably.</p>

<p>Leaving the carpenters and Indians at work, I went into the then small
village of Winnipeg for Mrs Young and our two little children, who were
now returning from Ontario, where they had remained among friends, until
I, who had so long preceded them, should have some kind of a habitation
prepared for them in the wilderness. For weeks we had to live in my
little twelve-by-twelve log-cabin. It was all right in cold or dry
weather, but as its construction was peculiar, it failed us most signally
in times of rain and wet. The roof was made of poplar logs, laid up
against the roof pole, and then covered very thickly with clay. When this
hardened and dried, it was a capital roof against the cold; but when
incessant rains softened it, and the mud in great pieces fell through
upon bed, or table, or stove, or floor, it was not luxurious or even
comfortable living. One morning we found that during the night a mass,
weighing over five pounds, had fallen at the feet of our youngest child,
as she, unconscious of danger, slept in a little bed near us. However,
after a while, we got into our new house, and great were our rejoicings
to find ourselves comfortably settled, and ready for undivided attention
to the blessed work of evangelisation.</p>

<p>While there was a measure of prosperity, yet the Mission did not
advance as rapidly as I had hoped it would. My hopes had been that the
surplus population at Norway House would have settled there, and that
many from the interior directly east would, as they had stated, come out
and help to build up the Mission.</p>

<p>Opposition in various quarters arose, and the Norway House Crees
preferred to go farther south; and finally seventy families preferred
that place, and there they have formed a flourishing additional Mission.
Thus the work advanced, although not all along the lines which some of us
had marked out. With patient endurance my noble wife and I toiled on.
There was room for the exercise of the graces of courage, and hope, and
faith, and patience; but a measure of success was ever ours, and we saw
signs of progress, and had every now and then some clear and remarkable
cases of conversion from the vilest degradation and superstition into a
clear and conscious assurance of Heaven's favour and smile.</p>

<p>One summer there came from the east to visit us a chieftainess with
several of her followers. Her husband had been the chief of his people,
and when he died she assumed his position, and maintained it well. Her
home was several days' journey away in the interior, but she had heard of
the Missionary who had come to live among the Saulteaux and teach them
out of the great Book. Was not she a Saulteaux, and had not she a right
to know of this new way, about which so much was being said? With these
thoughts in her mind she came to see us. When she came to the Mission, we
saw very quickly that here was an interesting woman. We had several
interviews, and Mrs Young and myself did all we could to lead this
candid, inquiring mind into the right way. Before she left I gave her a
sheet of foolscap paper, and a long lead pencil, and showed her how to
keep her reckoning as to the Sabbath day. I had, among many other
lessons, described the Sabbath as one day in seven for rest and worship;
and she had become very much interested, and promised to try to keep
it.</p>

<p>As she pushed out in her canoe from our shore, her last importunate
request was, that as soon as possible I would visit her and her people in
their own land. So many were my engagements that I could not take up this
additional one until about the middle of the winter following. When, with
a couple of Indian attendants, with our dog-trains, we dashed into her
village, great indeed was her joy at seeing us, and very demonstrative
was the welcome given. She had put up on a staging outside in the cold a
couple of reindeer heads, keeping them there preserved by the frost until
I should arrive. Very quickly were they taken down to cook. The hair was
singed off, and then they were cut up with an axe into pieces weighing
about two pounds each. Soon they were in the pot, boiling for our dinner.
I furnished some tea, and while everything was being got ready by a few,
the rest of us sat down and talked.</p>

<p>They were indeed anxious for instruction in spiritual things. I read
and, through my interpreter, explained truth after truth, to which they
gave the most earnest attention. Then we stopped a little while, that we
might have dinner. As I and my men were the guests of this chieftainess I
did not get out my tin plates, and cups, and knives and forks, but sat
down beside her in her wigwam with the rest of the people, completing a
circle around the big wooden dish, in which the large pieces of cooked
reindeer heads had been thrown. I asked a blessing on the food, and then
dinner began. The plan was for each person to help himself or herself to
a piece of the meat, holding it in the hand, and using hunting knife or
teeth, or both together, to get off the pieces and eat them.</p>

<p>I am sorry to say my lady friend on the right, this chieftainess, had
very dirty-looking hands, and long, strong, brilliant teeth. She took her
piece of meat, and, turning it over and over in her hands, began tearing
and cutting at it in a way that was not very dainty, but extremely
otherwise. After biting off a few mouthfuls, she threw it down on the
dirty ground of the wigwam before her, and, inserting one of her greasy
hands in the bosom of her dress, she pulled out a large piece of soiled
paper, and, unfolding it before me, she began in excited tones to tell me
how she had kept the tally of the &ldquo;praying days,&rdquo; for thus
they style the Sabbath. Greatly interested in her story, and in her wild
joyous way of describing her efforts to keep her record correct, I
stopped eating and looked over her paper, as she talked away. Imagine my
great delight to find that through the long months which had passed since
I had given her that paper and pencil, she had not once missed her
record. This day was Thursday, and thus she had marked it. Her plan had
been to make six short marks, and then a longer one for Sunday.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Missionary,&rdquo; she said very earnestly, &ldquo;sometimes it
seemed as though I would fail. There were times when the ducks or geese
came very near, and I felt like taking my gun and firing. Then I
remembered that it was the praying day, and so I only put down the long
mark and rested. I have not set a net, or caught a fish, or fired a gun,
on the praying day since I heard about it at your house so far
away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course I was delighted at all this, and said some kind words of
encouragement. Then we resumed our dinner. I had my piece of meat in one
hand, and with the knife in the other was endeavouring to cut off the
pieces and eat them. The good woman replaced the precious paper and
pencil in her bosom, and then picked up her piece of meat from the dirty
ground, and, after turning it over and over in her hands, began with her
strong teeth to tear off the large mouthfuls. All at once she stopped
eating, and, looking intently at my piece, she said, &ldquo;Your piece is
not a very good one, mine is very fine,&rdquo; and before I could
protest, or say a word, she quickly exchanged the pieces; and from her
portion, which she put in my hand, I had to finish my dinner. As what she
did is considered an act of great kindness, of course I would not grieve
her by showing any annoyance. So I quietly smothered any little
squeamishness that might naturally have arisen, and finished my dinner,
and then resumed the religious service. Soon after, she became a decided
Christian.</p>

<p>The following extracts are from the last letter which I sent to the
Mission Rooms, ere, owing to the failure of Mrs Young's health, we left
the land of the Saulteaux for work in the Master's Vineyard elsewhere.
The Mission had now been fully established, a comfortable parsonage built
and well furnished. A large school-house had been erected, which answered
also for the religious services until the church should be finished. Many
had been our trials and hardships, and there had been a great deal of
opposition, much of it from places not expected. But to be enabled to
send such tidings from such a place, where I had gone as the first
Missionary, and among such a wicked and degraded tribe as were these
Saulteaux, so different from the more peaceful Crees, caused my heart to
rejoice, that He Who had permitted me to go and sow the seed had also
given me the honour of seeing some golden sheaves gathered in for the
heavenly garner:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Last Sabbath was perhaps the most interesting and encouraging
one we have spent on the Mission. Our place of worship was crowded, and
many had to remain outside. Some of the old Indians who, in spite of our
pleadings, had clung to their paganism, renounced it on that day in a
most emphatic manner. Seven of them, after being questioned as to their
thorough renunciation of their old superstitions, and as to their present
faith in Christ, were then and there baptized.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the afternoon service several more were baptized; among them
an old man, perhaps seventy years of age, with his wife and grandchild.
He had never been inside a Christian sanctuary before. He had just
arrived from the vast interior eastward of this place, the country I
visited under so many difficulties last April.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The old man brought down with him the Bible and hymn-book which
I had given him months ago. He stated that although he could not read
them very well, yet he kept them close to him by day, and under his
pillow by night, and tried to keep in his memory all he had heard of what
was written in them, as I had told him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been teaching the school myself for months, as my
faithful teacher, Timothy Bear, is poorly. Among the scholars I have none
more attentive than the old man and his wife. Seated on the ground with
the Rev. James Evans' Syllabic Characters marked out with a pen on a
piece of paper in their hands, and the open Bible on the grass before
them, they are striving hard to read fluently in their own language the
wonderful works of God.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If this old man had presented himself for baptism a little
better clothed, we should have been pleased. All he had on was a dirty
cotton shirt and a pair of deer-skin leggings. However, as such fashions
occur here, his appearance created no remark, but all were deeply moved
at his coming forward and so emphatically renouncing his old
paganism.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Sacrament of the Lord's Supper on the same day was also a
service of great interest, as several new members, baptized a few months
ago, were admitted to the Lord's Table for the first time. In two
instances the decided stand for Christ taken by the women has led to the
conversion of their husbands. Until lately they were careless, reckless
men; but they have now come and declared that they are convinced that the
religion of their wives is better than the old, and they desire to have
it too. Thus the work goes on; but how slowly! When shall the time arrive
when 'nations shall be born in a day'? Haste, happy day!&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote><br>
 &ldquo;We are toiling through the darkness, but our eyes behold the
light<br>
 That is mounting up the eastern sky and beating back the night.<br>
<p>Soon with joy we'll hail the morning when our Lord will come in
might,</p>

        For Truth is marching on.<br>
<br>
 &ldquo;He will come in glorious majesty to sweep away all wrong;<br>
 He will heal the broken-hearted and will make His people strong;<br>
<p>He will teach our souls His righteousness, our hearts a glad new
song,</p>

        For Truth is marching on.<br>
<br>
 &ldquo;He is calling on His people to be faithful, prompt, and
brave,<br>
 To uplift again the fallen, and to help from sin to save,<br>
 To devote themselves for others, as Himself for them He gave,<br>
         For Truth is marching on.<br>
<br>
 &ldquo;Let us fight against the evils with our faces towards the
light;<br>
 God is looking through the darkness, and He watches o'er the fight<br>
 And His joy will be our recompense, His triumph crown the right,<br>
         For Truth is marching on.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
</blockquote>
